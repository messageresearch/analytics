[24:53] put in over 15 hours uh the rest of the
[24:56] week was actually fairly easy um a
[25:00] couple of days in the rain weren't very
[25:02] much fun but uh got soak and wet for a
[25:06] couple of days and working out the rain
[25:07] but um the Lord bless Wednesday the sun
[25:10] came out it was beautiful for three days
[25:12] but Friday was a little rough uh and
[25:15] actually both my knees are swollen today

[28:25] so he got so bad they took him to the
[28:27] Hospital Emergency Care uh found out he
[28:30] had
[28:31] appendicitis so they were supposed to
[28:33] take him in that night I believe it was
[28:35] Thursday night uh for
[28:38] surgery uh but they didn't get into the
[28:40] doctor until the next morning uh and I
[28:44] guess they had the surgery I believe

[28:48] lot better now uh Sonia told me
[28:52] yesterday that she said he's going to uh
[28:55] Jennifer his mother said he's going to
[28:56] be back to eating his favorite
[28:58] Chick-fil-A so uh hopefully he doesn't
[29:01] feel like eating Chick-fil-A today
[29:03] because it's not open today unless they
[29:05] took some and put in the fridge uh but
[29:09] uh he's doing really good like I said uh
[29:11] he's the one thing the one thing I guess
[29:15] he was looking forward to is being able
[29:16] to eat his Chick-fil-A again so thank
[29:19] the Lord for that God bless I mean we've

[29:59] really weren't Baptists and they
[30:01] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:03] and I mean you talk to them and you'd
[30:05] think they were in the message but they

[32:03] quite what they've had to do in the past
[32:05] oh amen amen I know sometimes they've
[32:08] had to go really deep down in there and
[32:12] just going to believe it do not going to
[32:13] be that way this
[32:15] time praise the Lord amen so God is
[32:20] mindful God is good he knows our every
[32:24] need amen praise the Lord
[32:27] I know uh when me and my wife were
[32:30] married um my wife's family parents paid
[32:35] for the wedding so we had it in their
[32:37] Church which was a Methodist Church at
[32:39] uh Fort LOL
[32:41] and uh Campbell on Campbell was a
[32:44] Methodist Church but the one thing my
[32:47] dad told him uh he went to the minister
[32:50] and said I want you to marry them in the
[32:52] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you can do
[32:55] the father son the Holy Ghost whatever
[32:57] you do through the ceremony and the P
[32:59] circumstance but when you join them in
[33:01] holy matrimony you you join them in the
[33:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh you
[33:07] know I guess the father of the groom
[33:11] pays the minister so I guess uh whatever
[33:14] my dad slipped him he was more than
[33:16] willing to say in the name of the Lord
[33:18] Jesus Christ so even though we were
[33:20] married in the Methodist Church by a
[33:21] Methodist Minister we were joined
[33:24] together in God's name in the name of
[33:26] the Lord Jesus Christ in a Methodist
[33:29] Church I'm sure people probably sat
[33:31] there and thought what in the world's he

[38:54] the words Lord thank you God to to know
[38:56] that you are still a a miracle working
[38:59] God you are still a Healer Lord it seems
[39:02] like sometimes we get so arrogant and
[39:05] pompous and our own righteousness as
[39:08] message Believers that God we just shut
[39:11] everything and everybody else out Lord
[39:13] but God we know that you are working you
[39:15] are working in everyone who is yours
[39:18] lives God and we trust and believe Lord
[39:21] that whoever that is Father we want to

[41:18] we thank you we praise you Lord we just
[41:20] pray God again that your full full
[41:23] anointing fall fresh once again Lord
[41:25] through this word that is spoken God let
[41:28] it be we commit it to you Lord now in
[41:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[41:32] pray
[41:34] amen amen Matthew 11:25 and at that time
[41:38] Jesus answered and said I thank the old
[41:40] father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[41:43] thou has hid these things from the wise
[41:44] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[41:46] babes you could be seated if you'd like
[41:50] amen now I want to continue on with kind
[41:52] of where we left off last week now I
[41:54] know a little of it's been a little
[41:55] jumpy and of course we had three weeks
[41:57] of separation between some of them as
[41:59] well but I want to go back to Revelation
[42:02] chapter
[42:05] 6 amen we kind of left off from there
[42:08] last week uh I'm not going to bring the
[42:10] board back over again this week but we
[42:12] went through the church ages uh we
[42:15] talked about the uh and went through the
[42:18] the anointings uh of each age the
[42:21] anointing that's on this age the
[42:23] anointing that's on us the anointing in
[42:25] that that anointing is what brings that
[42:28] word that Revelation to our hearts
[42:30] reveals it to us God uses that anointing
[42:33] to bring that word to our hearts that's
[42:36] why this last day it had to be an eagle
[42:39] just like the Revelation that was
[42:40] brought to many of those in the
[42:41] Philadelphia Sardis Philadelphia Church
[42:44] Age The Man Age the wisdom to bring
[42:46] those things that was needed if God does
[42:48] it to bring about what this bride needs
[42:50] because he brings each of these bride
[42:52] the bride members through each of these
[42:54] Church ages had to be that Eagle
[42:56] anointing for this last day it's that
[42:58] same anointing that brings again still
[43:01] that Revelation to us and it will until
[43:03] we leave this place it will until this
[43:06] body is changed and we go in a Rapture
[43:09] it'll still be that same anointing and
[43:12] when that and when this bride leaves in
[43:14] its Earnest uh in a Rapture then that
[43:17] anointing goes with it we read last week
[43:20] that the world goes into apostasy uh the
[43:23] church age Church age as it were in and
[43:27] the world goes into apostasy and this
[43:29] fourth this fourth horse rider this tail
[43:33] horse rider rides straight on into
[43:35] predition God's anointing goes from the
[43:38] Gentiles and goes over and begins to
[43:40] deal with the Jews we found out that
[43:42] that tribulation period which I want to
[43:45] read a little bit today uh the purpose
[43:47] of that tribulation period the re that
[43:50] God has it there and that the church the
[43:52] bride raptures the church goes to there
[43:55] the biggest reason the difference
[43:57] between the bride and the church is the
[43:58] Holy Spirit the bride's born again the
[44:01] church is not the church has a simple
[44:02] anointing on them an oil but not a
[44:06] sustaining oil not not born again not in
[44:08] their soul maybe on their flesh maybe
[44:10] even on their Spirit but don't have what
[44:13] it takes to be able to complete the
[44:15] journey to bring them to that place of a
[44:18] Rapture amen uh they go through the
[44:21] tribulation they have to give their
[44:23] lives in marment they have to seal their
[44:25] testimony with with their own blood as
[44:26] brother Brandon puts it that way sealing
[44:29] their own testimony with their blood
[44:30] through that tribulation period which
[44:33] proves and shows that this bride since
[44:36] there is not a necessity for this bride
[44:38] to go through a Rapture proves that she
[44:41] is sinless before God proves that she is
[44:45] she is undefiled she is pure she is Holy
[44:48] she is righteous because of his
[44:51] righteousness she is clothed in his
[44:52] righteousness she is as righteous as
[44:54] Jesus Christ is righteous there's not a
[44:57] sin about her as we read that quote
[44:59] brother Bram said there's not even a
[45:01] smell of it on the bride amen perfectly
[45:05] sinless before Jesus Christ before God
[45:08] perfectly sinless so there's no reason
[45:10] for the bride to go through the
[45:12] tribulation for she is purged she has
[45:15] already been purged by the Holy Spirit
[45:17] coming and taking its life in you and
[45:19] that seed that remaineth in you is a
[45:22] perfect seed because it's the seed of
[45:24] God Amen how can the Soul that is with
[45:28] how can the Soul that is in that that is
[45:31] Eng Gulf taken over by God sin it can't
[45:36] amen God can't dwell where there's sin
[45:38] God can't dwell where there's there's
[45:40] death uh every time Jesus went to a
[45:43] funeral the man came back to life of the
[45:45] person amen uh nor can he sin the only
[45:48] reason that God could even dwell on this
[45:50] Earth is through the human body of Jesus
[45:53] Christ amen so
[45:56] uh I want to go back and as we finished
[45:58] off with those Church ages uh I want to
[46:01] start with the fist seal like we said uh
[46:04] like I said last week weot many times we
[46:06] preach on the seals we preach on the
[46:08] part that brings us uh through the
[46:11] church ages but then a lot of times uh
[46:14] it doesn't get mentioned very often and
[46:15] I don't have a lot of notes commentary
[46:18] for the remaining couple of uh seals but
[46:21] I did want to go through them again
[46:22] because it brings us to actually the
[46:25] point that I want to get to today the
[46:27] subtitle or the the uh the point of the
[46:31] scripture that I wanted to get to today
[46:32] so we're going back to Revelation uh
[46:34] chapter
[46:36] 6 uh and I want to start after this
[46:39] after the church ages ending here is if
[46:41] you will they
[46:45] um as it overlaps we talked
[46:50] about of this last Church age and start
[46:53] with the ninth verse ninth verse is the
[46:57] fifth seal now we've gone through 1 two
[46:59] 3 4 gone from the White Horse red horse
[47:02] black horse Pale Horse uh now to the to
[47:05] the fifth seal fifth seal and when he
[47:08] had opened the fifth seal I saw under
[47:11] the altar The Souls of them that were
[47:13] slain for the word of God and for the
[47:17] testimony which they
[47:19] held and they cried with a loud voice
[47:23] saying how long oh Lord holy and true
[47:27] Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood
[47:30] on them that dwell on the
[47:33] earth white robes were given unto every
[47:35] one of them and it was said unto them
[47:37] that they should rest for a little while
[47:39] or for a little season until their
[47:41] fellow servants also and their Brethren
[47:44] that should be killed as they were
[47:46] should be fulfilled now uh it was and it
[47:50] probably still is with many churches
[47:52] thought of that that was a gentile
[47:55] people people the souls under the altar
[47:58] but as brother random Explains It Go
[48:01] through the seal book uh as the Holy
[48:04] Spirit came and revealed it and showed
[48:06] it to brother brandham and as you read
[48:08] it it becomes a lot clearer to
[48:10] understand these are not Gentiles these
[48:13] are Jews those that would die in Christ
[48:17] have a testimony of Jesus Christ that is
[48:22] our testimony our live alive or dead I
[48:27] know a lot of people that have gone on
[48:29] that that were Christians my family my
[48:31] parents they had a testimony their
[48:34] testimony was of Jesus Christ that was
[48:37] their testimony because we died under
[48:39] the shed blood believing uh as as the
[48:43] human human life gave out uh that that
[48:47] that life that they lived was a life of
[48:50] Jesus Christ so that testimony that they
[48:53] had was Jesus Christ but you see nowhere
[48:55] in the scripture reading here that these
[48:58] had a testimony of Jesus Christ they
[49:01] don't have a testimony of Jesus Christ
[49:03] they have a testimony of the word look
[49:07] now uh they were slain for the word of
[49:10] God and for the testimony which they
[49:12] held they cried with a loud voice saying
[49:15] now they didn't have now those that died
[49:19] as Gentiles had the testimony of Christ
[49:22] the Jews do not have that
[49:24] testimony amen they don't have the
[49:26] testimony of Jesus Christ they've gone
[49:27] through I mean the Jews are the one that
[49:29] said let his blood be on us and on our
[49:31] children they don't have the testimony
[49:33] of Jesus Christ now we know some of the
[49:35] Jews have come out and accepted and
[49:37] believed Christ but the Jews and the
[49:40] true Orthodox Jew they don't have a
[49:42] testimony of Jesus Christ they still
[49:43] don't see or know or believe that Jesus
[49:46] Christ was the Messiah they will by the
[49:50] grace of God through the word we know
[49:51] they will but as of now they still don't
[49:54] they still have it and obviously those
[49:56] that have been slain for the word's sake
[50:00] not for the testimony of Jesus Christ
[50:02] but for the word's sake they will and
[50:04] did as you read here receive white robes
[50:07] hallelujah amen which we'll go into just
[50:10] a little bit in a
[50:12] minute uh and then the second part as
[50:15] you read the scripture tells very
[50:17] plainly that these are not Gentiles
[50:20] these are Jews
[50:21] look white 11 verse again white robes
[50:24] were given unto every every one of them
[50:27] and it was said unto them that they
[50:28] should rest for a little season until
[50:31] their fellow
[50:34] servants amen fellow servants also and
[50:38] their Brethren that should be killed as
[50:40] they were should be fulfilled fellow
[50:42] servants now who are the servants
[50:44] Gentiles weren't servants the Jews are
[50:47] God's servants not the Gentile so
[50:50] actually even the Revelation because
[50:52] brother randam explains it he there it
[50:55] was the time he preached believed that
[50:57] those were Gentiles too but as the Holy
[50:59] Spirit revealed it to him and as you go
[51:00] and you read it uh it actually becomes
[51:03] very plain to realize these are not
[51:06] Gentiles these are Jews those Souls that
[51:09] are under the altar there crying Lord
[51:12] how long are Jews not
[51:14] Gentiles fellow servants which again
[51:17] we'll get to that in just a minute
[51:19] fellow servants how long should it be
[51:22] those Jews Under The Altar and they're
[51:24] still there today is still waiting amen
[51:28] still trusting but by the grace of God
[51:30] now they still receive white robes white
[51:34] robes given unto every one of them amen
[51:38] see God doesn't forget his people never
[51:41] would how high how far how wide amen you
[51:45] can't reach it you can't measure it how
[51:47] could I ever forget my people God never
[51:49] will never could those that have gone on
[51:52] they're setting there amen God doesn't
[51:54] just dis discount them yeah we know we
[51:56] have the 144,000 but God doesn't
[51:58] discount anyone any of his people even
[52:02] though we have a Rapture here amen at
[52:05] the end God's got bride in every Church
[52:07] age those dead in Christ will rise first
[52:11] and we which Rive and remain be caught
[52:13] up to meet the Lord in the air with them
[52:16] amen so God doesn't discount all those
[52:19] back there he brings them all along too
[52:22] Jew and Gentile the Jews are just is
[52:25] still sitting there under the altar
[52:27] waiting Lord how long amen how long
[52:30] shall there be Vengeance now see the
[52:32] bride doesn't cry for vengeance
[52:36] amen the the the bride the Gentile bride
[52:39] doesn't cry for vengeance but the Jew
[52:42] does if you go back and you read the
[52:44] Torah Old Testament look through it and
[52:46] see uh that's what it was all about it
[52:48] was eye for ey to for two they didn't
[52:51] see Jesus They didn't accept that
[52:53] message of Jesus Christ so they didn't
[52:55] believe him to be the Messiah so their
[52:57] whole thing is Judgment amen Vengeance
[53:01] Justice the bride she cries Grace yeah
[53:05] amen Grace amen Grace that's her that's
[53:09] her Battle Cry not Justice amen but
[53:12] Grace praise the Lord because she
[53:14] realizes through that message of Jesus
[53:16] Christ it's all about the grace of God
[53:19] Amen so they're not looking for
[53:20] vengeance the Gentile wasn't looking for
[53:23] vengeance we're not now looking for
[53:24] venance Vengeance amen the Bible says
[53:28] vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord amen
[53:31] we look for God's grace Lord let your
[53:34] mercy amen continue to Reign Over Us
[53:38] have mercy have Grace on others as you
[53:40] have had on me for if not for the grace
[53:43] of God there go I yes amen praise the
[53:48] Lord let's move on now and the 12th
[53:51] verse and I beheld when he had opened
[53:54] the six seed
[53:55] that's the fifth seal now Sixth Seal and
[53:58] lo there was a great earthquake and the
[54:01] sun became black sack cloth of hair and
[54:04] the moon became as blood you can
[54:07] really as we just began the reading of
[54:11] this six seal can pretty much already
[54:14] recognize this is the Tribulation
[54:17] seal the six seal is the Great
[54:20] Tribulation let me just put it that way
[54:23] because I think a lot of times people
[54:24] get get tribulation mixed up to to
[54:28] understand say if you will
[54:31] pre-tribulation or or uh types of
[54:35] persecution that is not the Great
[54:38] Tribulation and don't conflate the two
[54:40] that's amen they are separate entities
[54:42] they are separate times they are
[54:44] separate purposes for that Great
[54:47] Tribulation amen so remember this six
[54:51] seal is the Great Tribulation this is
[54:54] that that sets in on the earth after the
[54:58] bride is gone after the Rapture the
[55:01] Great Tribulation sets in amen and you
[55:04] can read and see how it even begins
[55:07] reading that this really looks like a
[55:10] time of Great Tribulation let's read it
[55:12] again it opened the sixel though there
[55:15] was a great
[55:16] earthquake amen is that the earthquake
[55:19] that s California La don't know amen we
[55:24] don't none of us know remember now the
[55:27] curse though is not on
[55:29] California the the prophecy of curse is
[55:32] not on California it's on La you go back
[55:36] and listen when brother B when God
[55:38] speaks through brother bam and that
[55:40] prophecy comes forth It's specifically
[55:43] about Los Angeles the city that calls
[55:46] ourself after the name of the Angels
[55:49] amen specifically about that not to say
[55:52] that the whole state or a huge chunk of
[55:54] the state's going to go in I'm not
[55:55] saying that but the curse specifically
[55:58] of what brother random what God spoke
[55:59] through brother random was on La yes was
[56:02] on Los
[56:03] Angeles amen now great earthquake is it
[56:07] that earthquake I don't know different
[56:09] people have had different opinions uh
[56:14] some uh would make common sense I guess
[56:17] you would say uh some probably to me
[56:20] don't uh you can have your own opinion
[56:23] if you'd like that's up to you
[56:25] uh brother Brown never specifies that
[56:27] I've ever found I've never had any other
[56:29] minister anybody I know of come and give
[56:32] me a quote where brother Ram
[56:33] specifically said X Y and Z I know
[56:36] brother green was strictly I mean
[56:41] dogmatically against anybody going to
[56:44] California uh when when I took the the
[56:47] school kids on a field trip to uh to to
[56:51] where did we
[56:52] go uh Six Flags and
[56:55] uh we did some education stuff we went
[56:58] to Santa Monica we did you know uh we
[57:00] had an end the year fun field trip if
[57:03] you will oh and I came back brother
[57:05] green he he did not like that at all uh
[57:09] he was he was all over me and I and and
[57:14] and we had a discussion about it
[57:16] although he was so mad at me it wasn't a
[57:18] very much of a just it was more of a
[57:19] one-sided discussion but um but I but
[57:24] when when things begin to calm down I
[57:26] started asking him well brother green
[57:28] what makes you feel that way and it was
[57:31] his personal opinion it wasn't scripture
[57:33] it wasn't anything brother brother
[57:35] brandham had told him because I want to
[57:36] know see brother brandham told Brother
[57:39] green things you won't that brother
[57:41] green told us that you'll never hear on
[57:43] tape and you just have to take brother
[57:45] Green's word for it and I loved him
[57:47] enough and I believed him enough and and
[57:50] I could see as sister Pat was talking
[57:52] about I could see in brother Green's
[57:53] face in his eyes he was telling me the
[57:55] truth amen you heard all these things
[57:58] you hear uh behind the pull pit and all
[58:00] but I'm talking about sitting in his
[58:02] office across that desk that's in there
[58:03] now in my in my my desk now sitting at
[58:06] that desk across from him I can see in
[58:08] his eyes I can see in his face he's
[58:10] telling the truth so I believed him but
[58:14] there's some of those things you just
[58:15] you just have to believe because you
[58:17] don't hear it on tape um just like
[58:20] people have to believe Billy Paul's
[58:22] testimony about being in front of the
[58:24] May Company I believe him I I I've had
[58:27] brother Billy Paul give me that
[58:28] testimony in person I've seen it two or
[58:31] three times uh uh in in a congregation
[58:35] setting when he's behind the platform
[58:37] pull pit and I've heard it on
[58:40] tape and I've had like I said I've had
[58:42] him tell me personally I believe it when
[58:44] he tells me uh that testimony I believed
[58:47] it absolutely I believe what brother
[58:49] green tells me so I asked brother green
[58:52] uh is there anything you know why do you
[58:54] say that brother why do you feel that
[58:56] way it was just a personal feeling it
[58:58] wasn't anything brother brandham told
[59:00] him personally wasn't anything he could
[59:02] point to specifically in the scripture
[59:04] or even even a quote outside of the fact
[59:07] that La is under judgment but this point
[59:11] in life what country what town what city
[59:14] what state isn't under judgment I mean
[59:18] I'm over there in LA this week working
[59:22] and all the rain they've been getting
[59:24] parts of the
[59:26] interstate fell caved in Interstate 10
[59:30] so I was told I looked on my maps I said
[59:33] wow why is Interstate 10 closed here and
[59:35] here and here and somebody said well it
[59:37] sunk whole Interstate sunk in I said
[59:41] well it's just getting ready to all go
[59:42] in the ocean anyway and you know person
[59:45] just looked at me and you know well yeah
[59:48] or something you know just kind of throw
[59:50] off this yeah God's prepar it's all
[59:52] getting ready to go in anyway but but
[59:54] what isn't what is under what what part
[59:56] of where we this whole country's under
[59:58] judgment FR SE we know border to border
[1:00:00] Coast to Coast she's going to get a a
[1:00:02] fiery baptism she's going to be burned
[1:00:04] over we know it's all under judgment
[1:00:07] amen so uh I know La specifically
[1:00:11] because God used brother bradam to say
[1:00:14] specifically you're going beneath the
[1:00:16] ocean and we know that's going to happen
[1:00:18] is this that earthquake I don't know
[1:00:21] again you can have your own opinion
[1:00:22] there's nothing wrong with that I I I I
[1:00:26] see I hope you know me well enough to
[1:00:28] know now I've been around a lot of
[1:00:29] people I've been a lot around around a
[1:00:31] lot of churches uh charismatic churches
[1:00:34] dogmatic churches uh uh churches who
[1:00:39] felt like that uh you know it was there
[1:00:42] and no more I've been a lot I've been a
[1:00:44] lot of places across the country been a
[1:00:46] lot of churches vote for a lot of people
[1:00:47] vote a lot of minutes and the thing that
[1:00:50] I probably one of the things I despise
[1:00:52] the most is for someone to come and tell
[1:00:54] me their opinion as
[1:00:57] fact I I don't want I am more than
[1:01:00] willing to hear your opinion but don't
[1:01:02] try to present it to me like fact like
[1:01:04] if I have a different opinion I'm going
[1:01:06] to hell uh I I I don't like that Spirit
[1:01:09] at all I don't like it I I don't want to
[1:01:13] have
[1:01:13] it I hope I don't or or get it from
[1:01:17] anybody else because you can't point and
[1:01:20] show in the scripture or or a quote by
[1:01:23] Brother brand to substantiate then it's
[1:01:26] just your opinion right amen
[1:01:29] so we all have opinions and there's
[1:01:31] nothing wrong with that I have my own
[1:01:33] personal opinion about California when
[1:01:35] it might sink the earthquake and all
[1:01:37] that uh and if I give it to you it's
[1:01:40] simply going to be my opinion because I
[1:01:42] don't have any any like I said any quote
[1:01:45] or anything to substantiate it so uh I
[1:01:47] can point to things that brother Ram
[1:01:50] said I can point to things that the
[1:01:52] scripture says and just draw my own
[1:01:54] conclusion just like anybody else would
[1:01:57] but I don't
[1:01:59] know another thing you probably don't
[1:02:01] hear very much from ministers but I
[1:02:04] don't if I don't have any concrete thing
[1:02:06] that brother Ram said or this then all I
[1:02:09] know is what I feel God's revealed to me
[1:02:12] and that's all I can say that's what I
[1:02:14] can go by amen I personally think the
[1:02:16] earthquake is going to be
[1:02:18] simultaneous in my opinion California's
[1:02:21] going to go the bride's going to go uh
[1:02:24] there there's going to be so many people
[1:02:27] missing and they won't know anything
[1:02:28] about it and it's well it you know maybe
[1:02:31] they got washed away maybe they got sunk
[1:02:33] under maybe this happened maybe that
[1:02:35] happened a lot of chaos is going to go
[1:02:37] on uh when this happens because it's not
[1:02:40] just going to affect California I I I've
[1:02:43] I've also had so many people joke about
[1:02:45] Arizona being beast fun property you you
[1:02:48] think you're going to stand here in
[1:02:50] Arizona and there's just going to be a
[1:02:51] little bump and then you're all of a
[1:02:53] sudden going to have the ocean it it's
[1:02:55] not going to happen like that a huge how
[1:02:59] many trillions of tons of Earth is going
[1:03:02] to go and displace all that water what
[1:03:05] do you think's going to
[1:03:06] happen it's going to be catastrophic all
[1:03:09] over the world yes uh
[1:03:13] so you you can't just say oh boom oh
[1:03:16] there it was California's gone oh we got
[1:03:18] nice now my property's worth a million
[1:03:20] dollars it doesn't work like that it's
[1:03:23] not going to be that way Saints um but
[1:03:26] earthquake
[1:03:28] now the first thing let off in
[1:03:31] Tribulation is earthquake open the six
[1:03:34] seal and there was a great
[1:03:36] earthquake boom seal open earthquake
[1:03:40] there it is
[1:03:43] amen and the sun became black as
[1:03:46] sackcloth of hair the moon became as
[1:03:49] blood the stars of the heaven fell upon
[1:03:51] the Earth even as a fig tree cast their
[1:03:54] under untimely figs when it when she is
[1:03:56] shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven
[1:03:58] departed as a scroll when it was when it
[1:04:01] is rolled together and every mountain
[1:04:03] and Island were moved out of their
[1:04:06] places says I do not want to be here
[1:04:10] during that time God have mercy on
[1:04:13] anybody that is and that's probably a
[1:04:16] you can't even say that because there
[1:04:17] will be no mercy here like I said during
[1:04:20] the tribulation there will be no
[1:04:22] anointing here am mean God's just be
[1:04:25] dealing with the Jews that's it amen so
[1:04:28] you say God have mercy there won't be
[1:04:30] any they just have to live and deal with
[1:04:34] whatever H whatever Satan unleashes on
[1:04:36] this place we see it scripturally every
[1:04:40] Mountain Island moved out of their
[1:04:43] places goodness the kings of the earth
[1:04:46] and great men and the rich man and the
[1:04:49] chief captains and the Mighty Man and
[1:04:51] every bondman every free man hid them
[1:04:54] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[1:04:56] of the
[1:04:57] mountains said unto the mount and said
[1:05:00] to the mountains and rocks fall on us
[1:05:03] and hide us from the face of him that
[1:05:05] set us on the throne from the Wrath of
[1:05:07] the lamb for the great day of his wrath
[1:05:10] is come and who shall be able to stand
[1:05:13] now to me that'll be a period of time I
[1:05:16] to me that that's where uh I think in
[1:05:19] people's imaginations or maybe even a
[1:05:22] gift of vision have seen these zombie
[1:05:24] type
[1:05:25] people they will they will be to the
[1:05:28] place that they cry for the rocks to to
[1:05:31] kill them to to fall on us kill us hide
[1:05:34] us get us away somehow so that we're not
[1:05:37] in the face of this judgment there's
[1:05:39] there's going to be no way of Escape
[1:05:42] there's going to be no way to get away
[1:05:44] from it I can imagine people probably
[1:05:47] try to blow their heads off and uh uh
[1:05:50] blow half their face and and still live
[1:05:54] could you imagine the things that these
[1:05:57] that that these people imagine or bring
[1:05:59] up today they called zombies or the
[1:06:02] living dead they're dead but they're
[1:06:05] alive
[1:06:07] goodness blood to the hores bridled it's
[1:06:11] going to be a horrible horrible time
[1:06:13] friend that this earth goes through and
[1:06:15] it's purging Humanity in its purging the
[1:06:19] Judgment that falls on this Earth the
[1:06:21] purging for those for the church the
[1:06:23] judge judgement for those who didn't
[1:06:25] believe who rejected uh the word
[1:06:28] rejected Christ F feel the full brunt of
[1:06:32] what this tribulation is going to me to
[1:06:34] this world it's going to mean to its
[1:06:36] people oh they think they can go with it
[1:06:38] for a little while they'll continue on
[1:06:40] they've had tragedy here and catastrophe
[1:06:43] here they've dealt with this and they've
[1:06:44] dealt with that but there'll be nothing
[1:06:46] even remotely close to what's about to
[1:06:48] hit this earth when this bride leaves
[1:06:52] and it's Unleashed the fullness and the
[1:06:55] full Fury of that pale horse rider
[1:06:57] continuing to ride through the predition
[1:07:00] is going to
[1:07:01] unleash unimaginable things upon this
[1:07:04] Earth during that tribulation
[1:07:07] period during that tribulation period as
[1:07:10] we read last week not only will the
[1:07:13] church be purged but the Jew will be
[1:07:17] purged that brings us now to the seventh
[1:07:21] chapter so let's read the seventh
[1:07:23] chapter we haven't got to the we haven't
[1:07:25] got to the seventh
[1:07:28] seal but and and I wasn't really going
[1:07:31] to talk a whole lot about the seventh
[1:07:33] seal but there's a specific thing about
[1:07:35] it that I did want to
[1:07:37] mention the Bible says I'll read it real
[1:07:41] quick the Bible say when he opened the
[1:07:42] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[1:07:44] about space half an hour now understand
[1:07:47] that to
[1:07:50] me that
[1:07:52] scripture
[1:07:54] I don't know brother Ram said this the
[1:07:56] coming of the Lord and so on so forth uh
[1:07:58] never specified we believe to be the
[1:08:00] second coming could be the third coming
[1:08:03] as as brother green had mentioned before
[1:08:06] this runs in continuity together in
[1:08:10] chronological order that would mean that
[1:08:12] this coming is after the
[1:08:15] tribulation but look what it
[1:08:18] says the thing that that I want to get
[1:08:21] to in the study of this message God in
[1:08:24] Simplicity what is our opening scripture
[1:08:27] that we've read every every uh part of
[1:08:30] this I thank thee old father Lord of
[1:08:32] Heaven and Earth because I has hid these
[1:08:34] things from the wise and TR prudent
[1:08:36] revealed him to B such as would learn
[1:08:38] look what he says when he had open the
[1:08:40] seven sear that was silence in heaven
[1:08:42] about the space half
[1:08:43] hour there's
[1:08:45] things what let me go here even what did
[1:08:49] Brother brandham tell what did God tell
[1:08:51] brother brandham about the pulls in his
[1:08:56] life first first pull signs in the hand
[1:08:59] second pull discernment of the heart
[1:09:01] third pull speaking of the word what did
[1:09:04] Brother random what did God tell brother
[1:09:06] random remember he talked about the
[1:09:08] shoelaces being so big trying to fit
[1:09:11] through a the shoelace being you know
[1:09:14] the size of a finger if you will going
[1:09:16] through the the hole of a pinhole right
[1:09:18] trying to fit that in and he said you
[1:09:21] can't teach super uh Pentecostal baby
[1:09:24] Supernatural things remember that yes
[1:09:26] I'm sorry I didn't get these quotes down
[1:09:28] to read them to you but uh this is all
[1:09:30] those things God is trying to tell
[1:09:32] brother Brandon he said now you've tried
[1:09:35] to explain the first and the second
[1:09:37] polls he said but the third one there's
[1:09:41] there there was to be nothing Satan was
[1:09:45] to know nothing about it even you Daniel
[1:09:49] Revelation 10 hide those things seal up
[1:09:53] those things until the right time notice
[1:09:56] there's only there are there are some
[1:09:59] things that God has just for the
[1:10:04] bride there is no one else that's
[1:10:07] supposed to know it no one else that is
[1:10:09] to speak it it is a direct Revelation
[1:10:13] from God to his bride and as God brings
[1:10:17] it and reveals it to us that is exactly
[1:10:20] what this what this bride is going to
[1:10:23] need that's what we we we have need of
[1:10:28] Amen silence what is it it's something
[1:10:32] unspoken it's not supposed to be
[1:10:34] something spoken it's supposed to be
[1:10:37] just a revelation at Revelation between
[1:10:41] God our maker and us his
[1:10:44] creation that's all not spoken amen
[1:10:48] simply revealed I thank thee father thou
[1:10:52] H that thou has hid these things from
[1:10:56] the wise and prudent but what did he do
[1:10:58] to the babes what did he do for the
[1:11:00] bride he's reveal them to you it is for
[1:11:04] you and you only to know you and you
[1:11:08] only to hear or have revealed to amen
[1:11:13] but now that we've come out let's go
[1:11:14] back over to the seventh chapter now so
[1:11:17] now as we' come back out of uh the
[1:11:20] tribulation period let's look uh chapter
[1:11:26] 7 which was really the main part of what
[1:11:28] I wanted to get to
[1:11:30] today Revelation 7 verse one and after
[1:11:34] these
[1:11:35] things I saw four Angels standing on the
[1:11:39] four corners of the earth now
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:44] translation
[1:11:45] caused early
[1:11:49] people to believe that the the world was
[1:11:52] flat and it had Four Corners to it but
[1:11:56] if you if you go back to the
[1:11:59] direct Revelation or interpretation of
[1:12:02] it it really simply means quarters or a
[1:12:07] quarter split up into quarters like like
[1:12:10] a hemisphere I could draw it but uh you
[1:12:13] got if you got a ball and you cut it
[1:12:15] down the middle and you C it cut it
[1:12:16] Crossways you got four quarters of the
[1:12:19] earth
[1:12:21] amen Four Angels standing on the four
[1:12:24] corners of the Earth holding the Four
[1:12:27] Winds of the earth and winds is
[1:12:29] disturbance amen we know scripturally
[1:12:32] winds denotes disturbance of the earth
[1:12:34] that the winds should not blow on the
[1:12:37] earth nor on the sea nor on any tree so
[1:12:41] no substance and no
[1:12:44] person and I saw another Angel ascending
[1:12:47] from the East having the Seal of the
[1:12:49] Living God and he cried with a loud
[1:12:52] voice to the four angel angels to whom
[1:12:54] it was given to hurt the Earth and sea
[1:12:56] saying hurt not the Earth neither the
[1:12:59] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[1:13:02] the Servants of our God in their
[1:13:04] forehead the Gentiles are gone amen the
[1:13:08] anointing goes back to the Jews this
[1:13:12] tribulation creates great
[1:13:14] disturbance and these four Angels on the
[1:13:17] four corns of the
[1:13:20] earth ready to unleash on on this Earth
[1:13:24] the complete and final judgment that it
[1:13:27] will
[1:13:27] receive but this marking Angel comes up
[1:13:31] that we find him in in Isaiah we find
[1:13:34] him again here remember he had the the
[1:13:37] the the writing instrument the eorn
[1:13:40] going around and marking those who s and
[1:13:42] CED
[1:13:44] Abominations amen now look that marking
[1:13:48] Angel another Angel ascending from the
[1:13:51] East having the Seal of the Living God
[1:13:54] which is a mark amen no remember the the
[1:13:58] the song We Sing I Mark Mark Mark I am
[1:14:03] Mark now Wherever I Go Mark marking
[1:14:07] Angel the seal the Seal of the Living
[1:14:10] God he cowed with a loud voice to those
[1:14:13] four angels that was about to
[1:14:15] unleash uh a complete disaster
[1:14:19] destruction on this Earth it was given
[1:14:21] to them to do so
[1:14:23] to hurt the Earth but this marking Angel
[1:14:27] says hold back stop wait don't hurt the
[1:14:32] Earth don't hurt the sea or the people
[1:14:37] the trees till we have sealed the
[1:14:40] Servants of our
[1:14:42] gods of our God
[1:14:45] where in their
[1:14:47] foreheads now what did Brother brandom
[1:14:50] tell us about the mark of the beast
[1:14:54] what did he tell us about the revelation
[1:14:56] of the
[1:14:57] word the marking in the forehead is your
[1:15:02] belief it's the Revelation it's what you
[1:15:05] it's what you uh uh believe give
[1:15:08] yourself over to your thoughts not not
[1:15:11] just your thoughts but but of of
[1:15:14] spiritual the the word of of of of
[1:15:17] Revelation the ceiling of the of the
[1:15:21] forehead is is what you
[1:15:24] receive into yourself as as scriptural
[1:15:28] Truth Or Not amen that's why those have
[1:15:31] the seal in their heads and on their
[1:15:34] hands you get the seal in your forehead
[1:15:37] because it's the Dogma or whatever you
[1:15:39] believe whatever you've received
[1:15:41] spiritually and your hand is what you do
[1:15:44] about
[1:15:45] it it's the right hand of Fellowship is
[1:15:48] the accepting and believing of of those
[1:15:51] dogmas of that doctrine of of that
[1:15:53] church or whatever it is and what you do
[1:15:56] about it the Revelation here what you do
[1:15:59] about it is here right now that now when
[1:16:03] when
[1:16:04] when when this marking Angel tells the
[1:16:08] Angels that's going to destroy it
[1:16:09] because when it's destroyed all of
[1:16:12] humans are destroyed when it's
[1:16:15] destroyed he's saying hold it back
[1:16:19] because I've got to seal the Servants of
[1:16:21] our God amen not the children uh not the
[1:16:25] not the bride of Christ but the Servants
[1:16:29] of our God we know who are they yes amen
[1:16:31] we just found over here under this under
[1:16:34] the altar the fellow servants as the
[1:16:36] Jews servants are always Jews to seal
[1:16:39] the servants where in their foreheads
[1:16:41] why because they have not received the
[1:16:44] message what's the
[1:16:47] message Jesus
[1:16:49] Christ it's not William brandom amen
[1:16:52] it's not word for word we say we have
[1:16:55] Christ mystery God revealed invisible
[1:16:57] Union and all but it's the message is
[1:17:00] Jesus Christ they received the message
[1:17:03] of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is God Bell
[1:17:07] in flesh their very Messiah that they
[1:17:10] crucified they receive it that marking
[1:17:14] Angel goes and what is delivered to the
[1:17:17] Jews at this
[1:17:19] time revelation
[1:17:22] reation
[1:17:23] praise the lord it's got to be
[1:17:26] Revelation it's not a human knowledge
[1:17:29] it's not an educational understanding
[1:17:32] it's a revelation of God showing it to
[1:17:35] his bride amen praise the Lord where is
[1:17:38] it it is here amen amen they receive it
[1:17:43] they understand they they they believe
[1:17:47] now he was their Messiah so before it
[1:17:51] all can be destroyed before all can be
[1:17:53] wiped away they had to be sealed they
[1:17:56] had to receive that truth they had to
[1:17:58] receive that word there had to be in
[1:18:02] Daniel 70 week a finish of the
[1:18:05] transgression praise godj they receive
[1:18:09] it now he goes on to talk about this who
[1:18:13] the servants were I heard the number of
[1:18:16] them that which were
[1:18:17] sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of
[1:18:22] all the tribes of the children of Israel
[1:18:25] 144,000 of all the tribes were sealed
[1:18:29] sealed with what the same thing that you
[1:18:31] were sealed with from Ephesians
[1:18:34] 1 amen grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:18:38] whereby ye are sealed amen amenallah
[1:18:43] they received the same
[1:18:44] seal glory to God by
[1:18:48] Revelation 144,000 of the tribes of the
[1:18:51] children of Israel and he goes down and
[1:18:54] we can read it real
[1:18:55] quick of the tribe of Judah were seal

[1:19:33] uh of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed
[1:19:36] 12,000 12,000 of 12 tribes is
[1:19:39] 144,000 that were sealed now before the
[1:19:43] complete unleashing amen and destruction
[1:19:47] of this Earth God had to seal the Jews
[1:19:51] now now we see the Fulfillment or
[1:19:55] portion of the Fulfillment of of of the
[1:19:57] fifth seal when the Jews are under the
[1:20:00] altar crying how long here it is they
[1:20:03] received that Revelation oh yes praise
[1:20:05] the Lord and to them vengence is met
[1:20:10] judgment has been has been executed and
[1:20:15] now they was they meet the same fate
[1:20:19] praise the Lord those the 144,000 those
[1:20:22] Souls out of the altar now we've got the
[1:20:25] Jews completed amen there's a whole
[1:20:28] another discrepancy of the 12 tribes I
[1:20:31] wasn't going to go into that today we've
[1:20:32] talked about that before in the past
[1:20:34] amen but um but to know 144,000
[1:20:40] fulfillment portion at least of the
[1:20:42] fifth seal where they reive now now
[1:20:45] we've got the
[1:20:46] Jews they're done there's only one more
[1:20:50] group left that went into the
[1:20:52] tribulation period out outside of the of
[1:20:56] the Judgment of the tribulation uh that
[1:20:59] that group of people God just puts on
[1:21:01] their left hand and casts into
[1:21:02] Everlasting fire amen uh not Eternal uh
[1:21:06] but Everlasting see that that's a group
[1:21:09] obviously that goes but we're not
[1:21:11] talking about them we're talking about
[1:21:13] uh the Bride of Jesus Christ and the
[1:21:15] church that's we're in part three the
[1:21:18] bride and the church we throw the Jews
[1:21:20] in there because they're a part of this
[1:21:22] as well well amen but now notice see so
[1:21:26] we now we finished the Jews we come
[1:21:28] through uh uh
[1:21:31] completed uh what their situation is
[1:21:34] what God does for them where God brings
[1:21:36] them through and two now we've got one
[1:21:38] other group only left and that's the
[1:21:40] church that's the foolish virgin where
[1:21:43] did the foolish virgin come up cuz we
[1:21:45] got here let's go over real quick and
[1:21:48] read
[1:21:48] this the fifth the fifth chapter of
[1:21:51] Revelation
[1:21:56] the fifth chapter of re
[1:22:01] Revelation verses 9 and
[1:22:05] 10 and they sung a new song saying Thou
[1:22:08] Art Worthy to take the book and to open
[1:22:10] the seals thereof for thou was slain and
[1:22:13] Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[1:22:17] of every
[1:22:19] Kindred uh and tongue and people and
[1:22:21] Nation and has made us unto our God
[1:22:25] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[1:22:29] the earth now that's the
[1:22:31] bride now let's go back to uh the
[1:22:34] seventh chapter and look at the ninth
[1:22:37] verse
[1:22:40] here because we've got another
[1:22:43] group after this I beheld and lo a great
[1:22:46] multitude which no man could number of
[1:22:49] all Nations kindreds and people and
[1:22:51] tongue stood Before the Throne and
[1:22:54] before the lamb clothed with white robes
[1:22:56] and Palms in their hands now we've now
[1:22:59] we've we have a
[1:23:02] discrepancy if which a lot of people do
[1:23:06] if you consider this group of all
[1:23:09] Nations that could not be numbered of
[1:23:12] all Nations Kindred people and tongues
[1:23:15] if this is the bride then we have a
[1:23:18] scriptural
[1:23:20] contradiction because it goes on to say
[1:23:23] they stood Before the Throne yeah amen
[1:23:27] but the bride does not stand Before the
[1:23:30] Throne Hallelujah she is in the throne
[1:23:33] Hallelujah as wife as bride of Christ
[1:23:38] her
[1:23:39] husband amen she's not Before the Throne
[1:23:42] you stand Before the Throne in
[1:23:45] judgment amen because when they come up
[1:23:48] to the white Throne judgment they
[1:23:50] everyone the the bride and Christ set in
[1:23:53] the throne and each one comes up for
[1:23:55] their own judgment he puts some on his
[1:23:57] left hand and some on his right hand
[1:23:59] this group is a group he put on his
[1:24:01] right hand this is not the bride this
[1:24:04] cannot be the bride because if it is it
[1:24:06] contradicts other scripture that says
[1:24:08] the bride will sit with him in his
[1:24:10] throne to judge not be judge but to
[1:24:13] judge do you not know that you shall
[1:24:17] judge the Earth amen amen that's the
[1:24:21] bride but look this fruit is Before the
[1:24:24] Throne before the lamb yes they're
[1:24:27] clothed with white robes with Palms in
[1:24:29] their hands but they are given white
[1:24:30] robes just like the Jews who did not
[1:24:34] believe in Christ for uh most of all of
[1:24:39] this time till the very end did not even
[1:24:41] believe they also believed they had
[1:24:44] white were given white robes Souls under
[1:24:47] the altar white robes were given unto
[1:24:50] them well sure you said well they had to
[1:24:52] be bride they were giving white rubs no
[1:24:54] no no no no no they they they uh there's
[1:24:58] too much scriptural contradiction to try
[1:25:00] to make this bride to try to make them
[1:25:02] bride no the bride is over in Revelation
[1:25:06] five when the book is
[1:25:08] open and the names are revealed the
[1:25:11] names in that L's Book of Life are the
[1:25:13] names of the Bride amen and when Jesus
[1:25:17] prevails and comes forth and opens that
[1:25:19] book those names reveal who who it was
[1:25:22] that was his bride amen amen not not Jew
[1:25:27] not foolish virgin but God's bride
[1:25:31] that's Revelation five not six not seven
[1:25:34] not Souls under the altar not seventh uh
[1:25:37] the seventh chapter these have to be a
[1:25:40] whole another group and what group is
[1:25:43] that look now and he cried with a loud
[1:25:46] voice saying salvation to our god which
[1:25:48] sth upon the throne and and unto the
[1:25:51] lamb and all the Angels stood round
[1:25:54] about the throne and about the elders
[1:25:56] the four beasts and fell Before the
[1:25:58] Throne on their faces and worship God
[1:26:01] Amen of
[1:26:03] course saying
[1:26:05] amen oh let me see here saying amen
[1:26:08] blessing Glory wisdom and Thanksgiving
[1:26:10] and honor and power and might be unto
[1:26:12] our God forever and ever amen this is
[1:26:15] not the bride cannot be it's the foolish
[1:26:18] virgin that's standing before God yes
[1:26:20] they have received white rose because
[1:26:22] remember re we didn't finish reading or
[1:26:26] complete that reading in Matthew 25 but
[1:26:29] we find in Matthew 25 when they come
[1:26:31] before him he puts a group on his right
[1:26:33] hand and he says enter into the joy of
[1:26:36] the Lord uh let's see if we can find it
[1:26:40] real quick if I can get back to
[1:26:42] it Matthew 25 and 31 when the son of man
[1:26:48] shall come in his glory and all the Holy
[1:26:50] Angels with him then shall he set upon
[1:26:53] the throne of his glory and before him
[1:26:56] shall be gathered all nations and
[1:26:58] remember now the bride is with him and
[1:27:00] in in the throne with him at this time
[1:27:02] they have to be when he's sitting there
[1:27:04] in that place of judgment is there their
[1:27:07] husband and wife amen and their judgment
[1:27:10] is is is uh the same together they're uh
[1:27:16] can't think of the word I'm trying to
[1:27:17] say but their judgment's the same
[1:27:20] because they're likeminded
[1:27:22] remember the the bride has taken on the
[1:27:24] mind of Christ she does that now so even
[1:27:28] when we get there she's taken on the
[1:27:29] mind of
[1:27:31] Christ his judgment's her judgment
[1:27:34] they're the same they look at things the
[1:27:36] same they believe the same why because
[1:27:38] he's the word she's become the word
[1:27:40] she's his bride she's sitting there the
[1:27:43] Judgment with him shall come up Shall
[1:27:46] Set upon the throne of his GL and be and
[1:27:48] before him shall be gathered all nations
[1:27:51] and he shall separate them one from
[1:27:53] another as a sheep divide uh as a
[1:27:56] Shepherd divideth his sheep from the
[1:27:57] goats now that can't be the bride cannot
[1:28:00] be a part of one of those two
[1:28:02] groups amen and notice it did not say
[1:28:08] that this group was his
[1:28:10] sheep it says that he divides them or
[1:28:14] separates them as a Shepherd would
[1:28:18] divide his sheep from the goats he
[1:28:20] didn't call them sheep he just said the
[1:28:23] dividing process of separating them is
[1:28:28] as what a Shepherd would do yes he
[1:28:31] didn't call the group on his right hand
[1:28:33] sheep because the sheep or his bride yes
[1:28:36] amen he just said the separation process
[1:28:39] is what a Shepherd would do it's the
[1:28:41] same process I'm going to take this and
[1:28:44] I'm going to put them here and I'm going
[1:28:45] to take this and I'm GNA put them there
[1:28:48] he didn't say there were Sheep amen and
[1:28:52] the bride cannot be either one of these
[1:28:54] two
[1:28:56] groups because she's on the throne she's
[1:29:00] not coming up to be judged why would she
[1:29:02] be coming up to be judged again when
[1:29:04] she's pure when she's sinless when she's
[1:29:09] righteous and holy why would there be a
[1:29:11] point of judgment when there's nothing
[1:29:14] to judge her
[1:29:16] for oh saints that just takes us back
[1:29:18] our whole last message last week she
[1:29:22] doesn't come before the throne to be
[1:29:24] judged she's judged
[1:29:27] now when you were judged and found not
[1:29:31] guilty God put his life in you that's
[1:29:34] right amen and that sealed it amen that
[1:29:38] finished it that that is
[1:29:42] doneall nothing else to your final
[1:29:46] destination amen you're done then you're
[1:29:49] finished you're innocent
[1:29:52] completely perfectly sinless before God
[1:29:56] not even a smell of sin
[1:29:59] hallelujah amen so how can this be the
[1:30:02] bride it
[1:30:04] cannot she has no reason to come before
[1:30:07] the throne praise the
[1:30:11] Lord as a Shepherd divideth his sheep
[1:30:14] from The Ghost and he shall set the
[1:30:17] sheep on his right hand but the goats on
[1:30:21] the left again he's not calling them
[1:30:23] sheep it's just the dividing process
[1:30:27] okay I know it says these sheep so if
[1:30:31] anybody's thinking that that came in my
[1:30:33] head if anybody's thinking that no it's
[1:30:35] just a continuation of the explanation
[1:30:38] of the dividing process he doesn't say
[1:30:42] you're not going to say you're not going
[1:30:44] to give an analogy and say it's like
[1:30:46] this and then use completely different
[1:30:49] characters if you say the proph
[1:30:51] processes like this then you're going to
[1:30:53] use the same characters to continue your
[1:30:56] your analogy that's right it's as a
[1:31:00] Shepherd so he says the Sheep here and
[1:31:02] the goats here it's that simple
[1:31:05] again not calling them Sheep amen okay I
[1:31:11] don't know if anybody was thinking that
[1:31:12] but I felt I had to explain that on the
[1:31:15] left and he and then shall the king say
[1:31:18] unto them on his right hand Come Ye
[1:31:20] blessed of my father inherit inherit the
[1:31:23] Kingdom prepared for you from the
[1:31:25] foundation of the world for I was in
[1:31:27] hunger and you gave me meat and went
[1:31:29] through all the process of well how did
[1:31:31] they get to this point we know that in
[1:31:33] the beginning of Matthew 25 they were
[1:31:36] virtuous had not deviled themselves with
[1:31:39] any man with any Doctrine they were
[1:31:40] spiritually
[1:31:42] virtuous stranger you took me in naked
[1:31:45] you clothed me I was sick you visit me
[1:31:47] in prison uh or visited me I was in
[1:31:50] prison you came un to me then shall the
[1:31:53] righteous answer him
[1:31:55] Lord saying Lord when saw thee uh saw we
[1:32:00] thee and hungered and fed thee or
[1:32:01] thirsty and gave thee
[1:32:03] drink when saw uh we thee a stranger and
[1:32:07] took thee in or naked and clothed thee
[1:32:09] or when saw we thee sick or in prison
[1:32:11] and came unto thee and the King shall
[1:32:13] answer and say unto them verily I say
[1:32:16] unto you in so much ye as ye have done
[1:32:18] it unto the least of these my brethren
[1:32:21] theast of these I I can imagine he's
[1:32:23] probably pointing to us on the throne at
[1:32:25] that time you have done it unto
[1:32:28] me when you did that to them you were
[1:32:32] doing it to
[1:32:34] me that's that's how I see this
[1:32:36] happening he would tell them when you
[1:32:39] did this to them he made point right at
[1:32:44] me he made point right at you when you
[1:32:47] did it to them you did it to me praise
[1:32:50] the Lord
[1:32:53] beautiful then shall he say also to them
[1:32:55] on the left hand depart from me ye
[1:32:57] cursed and everlasting fire prepared uh
[1:33:00] for the devil and his angels now look
[1:33:03] notice as this process
[1:33:06] unfolds He said Come Ye blessed of my
[1:33:09] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[1:33:12] you now look after uh back to revelation
[1:33:16] 7:9 after this behold l a great
[1:33:19] multitude which no man could number of
[1:33:20] all Nations Ed people and tongues stood

[1:35:44] witnesses and they shall prophesy that
[1:35:47] 1,23 score days clothed in sackcloth
[1:35:50] these are the the two olive trees two
[1:35:52] candlesticks standing before God of the
[1:35:54] earth and and if any man will hurt them
[1:35:57] fire Pro fire proceedeth out of their
[1:35:59] mouth and devour your enemies If any man
[1:36:01] will hurt them he must be in this manner
[1:36:04] uh these have power look what these
[1:36:06] Witnesses have power to do now power to
[1:36:09] shut Heaven that it rain not in the days
[1:36:11] of their prophecy now who did that in
[1:36:12] the
[1:36:14] scripture man called
[1:36:17] Elijah walked up in the face of Ahab and
[1:36:20] said there won't be a drop of rain or
[1:36:22] dfall till I call for it that is exactly
[1:36:25] what the scripture says there won't be a
[1:36:28] drop of rain not saying I'm quoting it
[1:36:30] exactly there won't be a drop of rain or
[1:36:33] dwall until I call for it amen now who
[1:36:37] is this witness over here doing the
[1:36:40] exact same thing shut up Heaven that it
[1:36:42] rain not the days of their prophecy and
[1:36:46] they will have power over Waters to turn
[1:36:48] them to blood and to Smite the Earth
[1:36:50] with all legs as often as they will now
[1:36:52] who did
[1:36:54] that Moes what happened when the water
[1:36:58] turned to
[1:36:59] blood Moses what was it when the plagues
[1:37:02] of the earth hit in that manner it's
[1:37:05] Moses amen so these two witnesses could
[1:37:08] be no one other than Elijah and
[1:37:13] Moses praise the Lord but they're the
[1:37:15] witnesses to the Jews for this last day
[1:37:19] now the Church also has two witnesses
[1:37:23] now I don't have scripture on this other
[1:37:27] than what brother random said brother
[1:37:29] brandham gives the church nominal two
[1:37:33] witnesses brother brandom brother green

[1:38:12] now both of those men are gone yes now
[1:38:15] where are we at how late of the hour are
[1:38:17] we living Saints praise the Lord think
[1:38:20] about now what do we have for this last
[1:38:23] day what do we have for the
[1:38:25] bride if God's going to send witnesses
[1:38:28] to the Jews Moses and Elijah if he's
[1:38:31] going to send witnesses to the church
[1:38:32] surely he's going to send witnesses to
[1:38:34] the
[1:38:35] bride
[1:38:37] amen those Witnesses we got well one of
[1:38:39] them's on the board there I didn't put
[1:38:41] brother Brown because I ran out of
[1:38:43] room but God sent us brother Brown God
[1:38:46] sent us William Mary and Bram a prophet
[1:38:48] to this last day amen to help bring that
[1:38:52] word we know I could give you all of the
[1:38:53] adjectives and all the things we know
[1:38:55] all over again but you know the purpose
[1:38:57] the Reason God sent us brother brandom
[1:39:00] as a messenger as a messenger Prophet to
[1:39:03] this last day to help us understand now
[1:39:07] I'll leave with
[1:39:08] this brother brandham uh let's go back
[1:39:12] scripture John the
[1:39:14] Baptist when John the Baptist ministry
[1:39:17] had re had had had begun
[1:39:22] and then it it reached his Pinnacle
[1:39:24] remember when it began or when it began
[1:39:27] to I guess diminish if you
[1:39:32] will John the Baptist told all those
[1:39:35] people that were there his
[1:39:38] followers he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:39:42] God follow ye him now there were people
[1:39:46] that continued to follow John the
[1:39:47] Baptist because we find out later on
[1:39:50] that when John's in prison he sends his
[1:39:52] disciples to go ask Jesus if he is the
[1:39:56] one you know brother Ram said his eagle
[1:39:58] eyes that got dimmed over and all amen
[1:40:01] is he the one or not John still had
[1:40:04] disciples I mean got the same thing
[1:40:07] today
[1:40:08] Saints there are still people that
[1:40:11] forgive me I I hope I don't say this
[1:40:13] wrong and I don't mean to degrate those
[1:40:16] people any but there's people that
[1:40:18] follow brother
[1:40:19] Brown amen

[1:40:24] Bram I believe this message I believe
[1:40:27] this word I thank God that brother Bram
[1:40:29] that uh that God sent brother brandham
[1:40:31] to us as a prophet Messenger to bring us
[1:40:34] this word amen but I'm a follower of
[1:40:37] Jesus Christ amen not a follower because
[1:40:41] just like John the Baptist when Christ
[1:40:44] came up he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:40:47] follow him brother Ram did the exact
[1:40:50] same thing yes amen amen when brother
[1:40:53] Ram's Ministry was
[1:40:55] was being completed if you will and
[1:40:59] brother brandham I mean was a young man
[1:41:01] when God took him it was finished
[1:41:04] brother branham's exclamation was he's
[1:41:06] here follow him but what do a lot of
[1:41:10] people still do they still follow
[1:41:12] brother Brown amen I'm not a follower
[1:41:15] brother BR I'm a follower of Jesus
[1:41:16] Christ amenl I'm not a bromite I'm a
[1:41:19] Christian amen I believe myself to be a
[1:41:22] Christian I mean brother Pat brings up a
[1:41:24] good a good analogy other people should
[1:41:26] call you Christians instead of yourself
[1:41:28] and I agree with that too but I do
[1:41:30] believe that I am a Christian amen uh
[1:41:33] and I believe others I hope and pray
[1:41:35] others witness that in my life but I'm a
[1:41:38] Christian first and foremost do I
[1:41:40] believe this message with all my heart
[1:41:42] do I thank God for brother Ram
[1:41:44] absolutely with all I've got within me
[1:41:47] do I listen to his message absolutely do
[1:41:49] I believe it yes yes 100% yes but I'm
[1:41:53] not a follower of William Brown amen I'm
[1:41:56] a follower of Jesus Christ cuz brother
[1:41:58] Bram did the exact same thing John the
[1:42:00] Baptist did I must decrease so that he
[1:42:05] increase oh Saints Let Jesus increase in
[1:42:09] all of our lives every day Let Jesus

[1:42:56] ones but God has his group God has his
[1:43:00] people God has his bride and God has his
[1:43:03] church and God has the Jews and we're
[1:43:05] not discounting any of those of of us of
[1:43:10] being his people we're a part of his
[1:43:13] people I'm one of them
[1:43:17] amen and I thank God he's given me that
[1:43:20] revelation
[1:43:21] to know who I am and who I belong
[1:43:23] to

[1:43:43] the truth too amen God sent a prophet to
[1:43:47] us amen not not that we would follow the
[1:43:51] prophet but that we would believe his
[1:43:53] word and follow Christ as a result amen

[1:44:01] us
