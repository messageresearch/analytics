[44:36] one now I Paul myself beseech you by the
[44:39] mer uh by the meekness and gentleness of
[44:41] Christ who in presence and base among
[44:44] you but being absent and bold toward you
[44:47] but I beseech you that I may not be bo
[44:50] that I may not be bold when I am present
[44:52] with that confidence wherewith I think
[44:55] to be bold against some which think of
[44:58] us as if we walk according to the flesh
[45:01] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[45:04] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[45:07] of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[45:12] through God to the pulling down of
[45:15] strongholds amen casting down
[45:18] imaginations casting down imaginations
[45:22] and every High thing that exalteth
[45:25] itself against the knowledge of God
[45:27] and bringing into captivity every
[45:30] thought to The Obedience of Christ the
[45:34] word amen you could be seated if you'd
[45:37] like amen I felt uh few months ago to
[45:41] start on a little series uh about the
[45:43] Mind amen we're going to do that today
[45:46] Lord willing start on uh series about
[45:49] the mind uh I'm tiing it the Gateway
[45:53] amen the Gateway the mind being the
[45:55] gateway to the soul with mind being the
[45:58] gateway to the spirit being the gateway
[46:00] to the soul because remember the soul is
[46:02] the nature of the spirit the spirit is
[46:04] the life of the body the body is flesh
[46:06] which is mind is flesh is a part of our
[46:08] body which is the Gateway the entrance
[46:11] way the C taste F smell here that we
[46:13] have that are inless to our human body
[46:16] go into the mind everything we feel
[46:19] everything we touch everything we hear
[46:22] everything we see uh all these
[46:24] everything we taste and smell all these
[46:26] things go straight to our minds straight
[46:28] to our brains amen and our minds and uh
[46:32] and that's the Gateway if you will
[46:35] that's the place of of decision that's
[46:37] the place that's the battle amen that's
[46:40] the battle that gets fought so many
[46:41] times in all of our Lives I don't care
[46:44] who you are I don't care how old you are
[46:46] how young you are uh I don't care how
[46:48] long you've been a Christian I don't
[46:49] care uh what faith you have what belief
[46:52] you have if you're a human being you
[46:54] have this battle every one of us do in
[46:57] mind that thing that comes all the time
[46:59] that bombardment of things and things
[47:01] that we probably a lot of times should
[47:04] not have we have good thoughts of course
[47:06] and we have thoughts that come in that
[47:07] we uh that we entertain that we like
[47:09] that are that are pleasurable thoughts
[47:11] that are good thoughts that uh we
[47:13] entertain those there are other thoughts
[47:15] that aren't so much A lot of times we
[47:17] have decisions to make we have things
[47:19] that we have to decide to do which way
[47:21] we're going to go which way we're going
[47:22] to turn some things are very nominal
[47:24] they don't mean much you know if you
[47:26] come to a a fork in the road and you're
[47:28] like well I want to go to this certain
[47:30] place but I'm not sure which Fork to
[47:31] take you got to make a decision you're
[47:33] GNA go to the right or you're gonna go
[47:34] to the left uh well if you go to the
[47:36] right and it's not down there you can
[47:38] always turn around come back and go to
[47:39] the left so some decisions that aren't
[47:42] as catastrophic but there are some
[47:43] decisions that are very important in our
[47:46] life one of the biggest decisions any of
[47:48] us made was to accept the Lord as our
[47:50] savior amen that's the biggest decision
[47:53] anybody could ever make is to receive
[47:55] the Lord as their Savior and and that
[47:57] that is a very important decision amen
[48:00] but always these things that Contin to
[48:02] come in our minds is the Battleground
[48:05] it's the place of the Battleground now
[48:07] remember the first Battleground there
[48:09] ever was the first battle that ever took
[48:11] place according to the scripture was in
[48:13] heaven Revelation 12 first battle that
[48:16] ever took place was in heaven and Satan
[48:18] and his followers were cast out into the
[48:20] Earth and and that battle didn't end
[48:24] when they were cast out on Earth that
[48:25] battle continued it just continued in a
[48:28] different venue and it continues today
[48:30] in each one of us that battle for that
[48:33] Gateway amen the battle for that gateway
[48:36] to come in to the the from the Mind into
[48:39] the heart into the soul of man is
[48:41] continually that same battle that's
[48:43] going on today just because it happened
[48:46] there or took or started there it
[48:48] continues in us today you can see the
[48:50] continuation of it when you get to the
[48:52] Garden of Eden you can see the continu
[48:54] continuation of it through all through
[48:56] through our lives you can see the
[48:58] continuation of it in your life yes amen
[49:00] that battle that Gateway that continues
[49:02] to to press on but the thing I want to
[49:05] get to now is uh I want to read this
[49:09] Adam Covenant confirmed uh
[49:14] 1961 list this now going back in that in
[49:17] that Garden at that time that that
[49:19] introduction on the earth now I didn't I
[49:22] didn't dwell delve into it as much as
[49:25] maybe I proba would like to have today
[49:28] but but this is going to be several
[49:30] parts so uh much of what I probably
[49:33] would say to introduce this subject to
[49:35] you uh is going to be said all
[49:37] throughout uh the time that we that we
[49:40] carry this through so sermon after
[49:42] sermon uh those introductory thoughts
[49:46] will continue to be brought into uh what
[49:48] we speak on today next Sunday so on so
[49:52] forth so but this I want to get to today
[49:56] uh I didn't want to I I don't want to
[49:58] feel rushed I didn't want to feel pushed
[50:00] I left the service at 10:30 knowing it
[50:02] would probably be close but cut the song
[50:05] service a little shorter and uh but I do
[50:08] want to deliver what's on my heart today
[50:10] so am um if he can keep an airplane for
[50:13] brother random he can keep an airplane
[50:14] for me so uh I plan on using wisdom and
[50:18] I plan on being there all time but the
[50:20] Lord willing uh I I want to deliver
[50:23] what's on my heart now look at this says
[50:25] and as I said the other night in the
[50:26] guard of Eden the devil chose his part
[50:30] of a man and God chose His part amen the
[50:35] devil chose his part of the man and God
[50:37] chose His part of the man uh God chose
[50:41] the man's heart the devil chose the
[50:44] man's intellect his mind amen now you
[50:48] you begin to realize or to haven't
[50:50] already realize why that is such a great
[50:53] battle that's the place that the devil
[50:56] chose and God allowed him to take that
[50:59] as his place as his place of battle amen
[51:03] remember he said he's got that punch
[51:05] coming at you and brother Ram said he
[51:07] has a right to that punch yes you know
[51:10] we hear it all the time when people say
[51:12] that punch is coming but you know
[51:14] brother brandom said that he has a right
[51:17] to that punch amen amen he chose the
[51:20] mind so where do you think the punch is
[51:22] going to come to it's not going to come
[51:25] to your heart especially if you're born
[51:26] again it's not going to come to the
[51:28] heart cuz that's the place God chose
[51:30] it's going to come to the mind that's
[51:31] right it's going to come to that
[51:33] Battleground that place where he thinks
[51:35] he can gain some ground on you to try to
[51:38] convince you you're not a child of God
[51:40] to try to convince you you are not who
[51:43] God says that you are to try to convince
[51:45] you you're less or lower to try to
[51:47] convince you oh you'll never be a child
[51:49] of God you'll never make it there's no
[51:52] way you can get there look at how
[51:54] horrible you are look at the things
[51:55] you've done that's a devil that's a
[51:57] that's a battleground of the devil
[51:59] trying to defeat you that's why he chose
[52:01] the mind to try to defeat you out of
[52:04] that to try to get you thinking
[52:06] something thinking something that is not
[52:10] true how many times does the devil put a
[52:14] thought in your mind and we entertain
[52:16] that thought and before long you
[52:18] thinking that that thought was yours it
[52:19] wasn't yours to begin with that's why
[52:22] the Bible says to cast down imagination
[52:25] yes cast down down reasonings and bring
[52:29] captive Captivate every thought every
[52:34] thought now that's that's a strange I
[52:36] the one thing I didn't look up is how
[52:37] many thoughts we have in a minute but
[52:39] it's a lot I know the number's High I
[52:42] don't remember the number but I know the
[52:44] number's High I forgot to look that up
[52:46] but it's a lot a lot of thought but the
[52:48] Bible says to bring every thought into
[52:52] captivity amen I I've used this analogy
[52:55] for years ago I started though when I
[52:57] was preaching the Lord just inspired me
[52:59] brought it it's like a
[53:01] computer when a computer virus comes
[53:03] into there the computer starts acting up
[53:06] and saying wait there's something wrong
[53:09] here something foreign has entered here
[53:12] that's not supposed to be there I didn't
[53:15] do it is what the computer is saying the
[53:18] computer is saying I'm not the one that
[53:20] generated this this came from an outside
[53:23] Source but it's trying to infiltrate my
[53:26] mind
[53:26] which is the hard drive it's trying to
[53:29] infiltrate my intelligence that's what
[53:31] the computer's trying to tell you now
[53:33] what do you want me to do do you want me
[53:35] to take that and bring it and what I and
[53:37] the computer will tell you uh I know I'm
[53:40] being very Elementary about this but
[53:44] it's kind of the bottom line of it the
[53:46] computer asks you then do you want me to
[53:48] take that form material that's come in
[53:51] that doesn't belong here that's trying
[53:54] to make you think that it's a part of
[53:56] this computer when it's really not do
[53:58] you want me to take that material and
[54:01] isolate it and put it into uh trash bin
[54:05] or whatever Captivate it and not let it
[54:08] hurt your computer you got a choice do
[54:11] we say yes or no well you know who's
[54:13] going to say no no I want to I want my
[54:16] computer corrupted with a virus so
[54:18] please send it
[54:19] Forward who's going to do that but yet
[54:22] we do that how many times we do that
[54:24] with our actual thoughts in our mind yes
[54:27] that we do that it's a foreign object a
[54:30] foreign substance that's coming to your
[54:32] mind your computer and it comes in there
[54:36] and and you have the choice a science
[54:39] says science says you have 17 seconds to
[54:44] make a decision are you going to
[54:46] entertain that thought are you going to
[54:48] reject that thought or are you going to
[54:51] replace that thought you have 17 seconds
[54:54] that's what they say Amen if you you can
[54:56] replace that thought then that thing
[54:59] goes away amen so who is going to press
[55:02] no and say Yes I want my mind my body my
[55:06] being corrupted with this thought the
[55:08] devil just put in my mind sure bring it
[55:10] on devil I I don't I don't mind who's
[55:13] going to do that but we do how many
[55:16] times do we do that though yes you
[55:18] wouldn't do that with your computer your
[55:20] computer comes and says do you want this
[55:22] virus or not how he's gonna say yes
[55:24] please bring on the virus
[55:27] I I have an extra $33,000 I need to
[55:30] spend on a new computer so please yeah
[55:32] just tear that one up I mean nobody does
[55:36] that but what you're doing is you're
[55:39] telling your computer to take that for
[55:42] material Captivate it and put it over to
[55:45] the side or get rid of it delete it
[55:47] annihilate it amen that's what you do
[55:50] with your brain bring every thought
[55:53] captive to what The Obedience of Christ
[55:56] who's Christ Christ is the word bring
[55:59] every thought to obedience to the word
[56:03] amen in obedience to the word obedience
[56:06] is better than sacrifice right amen
[56:09] every thought I know it's a lot I know
[56:11] we have a lot of thoughts but that's
[56:13] what the word says every thought to The
[56:15] Obedience captive bring it captive and
[56:19] if it's a form material that's from an
[56:21] outside source that doesn't belong there
[56:23] get rid of it replace it with something
[56:26] something else reject it amen and start
[56:30] I don't know sing A Hymn yeah uh quote
[56:34] uh
[56:35] scripture uh whatever you can do to
[56:38] change
[56:39] that you're in the room with your spouse
[56:41] turn around and say I love you honey
[56:43] that'll change it in heartbeat amen sure
[56:46] it will or your children or
[56:48] grandchildren turn and say I love you
[56:50] give him a hug or thought or something
[56:52] that'll change it just like that
[56:54] whatever it is amen amen
[56:57] the the the idol you ever heard this I'm
[56:59] sure you probably heard the idle mind is
[57:01] the devil's workshop yeah it gives him
[57:03] something that he can work in gives him
[57:06] something he can work on praise the Lord
[57:08] and and and he's entitled to that punch
[57:12] he's entitled to that because that's the
[57:14] part he chose here he chose the mind he
[57:17] chose that Battleground because he knew
[57:19] that that would be the place that he
[57:21] could work on the most to get to you the
[57:24] best knowing is God God's right-and man
[57:27] knowing that at at at some point if you
[57:30] become born again when individuals
[57:32] become born again he has no access to
[57:35] your heart at all anymore anyway
[57:37] Hallelujah why would he if you knew this
[57:40] and knowing this choose your heart when
[57:43] he knew that he would be shut out from
[57:45] that anyway no he chose the Gateway he
[57:48] chose the Battleground gateway to get to
[57:51] your heart amen but thank God it was God
[57:54] who chose the heart amen and God chose a
[57:57] way so that you could seal that devil
[57:59] out so that even when that comes in
[58:01] there it just remains a thought you cast
[58:03] it down amen cast that thought down to
[58:07] The Obedience of Christ the devil chose
[58:10] the intellect now today the church the
[58:15] church nominal Church depends on
[58:19] everything upon their intellect never
[58:23] thinking of the heart and that's the
[58:25] only only thing you can see see he says
[58:28] well a man says well I just can't see it
[58:31] that way brother said well you don't see
[58:34] with your eyes anyway yeah most people
[58:38] think you see with your eyes no you
[58:40] don't see with your eyes look you look
[58:44] with your eyes you look with your eyes
[58:46] but you see with your heart because the
[58:49] heart's the seat of understanding the
[58:52] the heart is the place where it's
[58:54] received acted upon
[58:57] received and and and and brought to life
[59:00] amen that's why the Bible says a man who
[59:02] looks on a woman to lust after her has
[59:05] committed adultery already in his heart
[59:09] right amen where did it start well it
[59:11] start because he looked on he saw and
[59:15] entertained and when he entertained the
[59:17] ACT literally there took place they
[59:21] never touched them but the man that
[59:23] looks on her to lust after her has
[59:26] committed that act in his heart amen and
[59:30] that's where it matters in the heart
[59:32] praise the Lord in the heart is where it
[59:34] matters because that's the place that
[59:36] God chose you look with your eyes you
[59:38] see with your heart it's the place of
[59:40] understanding you look at anything I
[59:42] don't see it you're looking at it but
[59:45] you don't see it means you don't
[59:47] understand it amen to say I don't see it
[59:49] means I don't understand it your
[59:52] understanding comes from your heart now
[59:54] that's where it is now he does doesn't
[59:56] understand it with his mind how is that
[59:59] uh how how is he going to do it his
[1:00:02] intellects would tell him that's his
[1:00:05] reasoning but the Bible said we cast
[1:00:08] down
[1:00:10] reasonings cast them away from us amen
[1:00:14] says how are you going to
[1:00:16] do uh how well are you going to do when
[1:00:18] the doctor says I've done all that I can
[1:00:21] do see a point of a point of
[1:00:24] battleground a point of
[1:00:27] decision do we believe what the doctor
[1:00:30] says or do we believe what God's word
[1:00:33] says amen and I'm not negating doctors
[1:00:36] you know me better than that I'm not I'm
[1:00:38] not saying the doctors do a great thing
[1:00:40] they do a great job in intelligent smart
[1:00:43] people uh that that are mostly I would
[1:00:46] say there probably some that aren't so
[1:00:48] much but mostly good at their jobs I
[1:00:51] believe most are honest I believe most
[1:00:53] adhere to the hypocritic oath and uh
[1:00:56] they're good people and want to just
[1:00:57] help other people there's some that
[1:00:59] aren't but uh but but that but God
[1:01:03] transcends that amen God God goes beyond
[1:01:08] that he's our great position and if the
[1:01:11] doctor says that you're dying and
[1:01:13] there's no hope for you and I've done
[1:01:14] all I can do what does the word say Amen
[1:01:18] what does God say that's what we care
[1:01:21] about that's what means the most amen I
[1:01:24] could have gone to the doctor said said
[1:01:26] your knees are all torn apart but God
[1:01:28] said no just have this boy your grandson
[1:01:30] come and lay hands on you he did praise
[1:01:34] the Lord x-ray is negative God's good I
[1:01:37] mean how how can you compare to that
[1:01:40] doctor can say one thing but what does
[1:01:42] God say it's like that story I've told
[1:01:44] about that uh that girl that that little
[1:01:47] daughter that was in the hospital dying
[1:01:49] and doctors come in and nurses come in
[1:01:51] and the doctor last time he come in he

[1:05:54] can do what they can do and thank God
[1:05:55] for them but it takes God to bring the
[1:05:57] healing that's right so who we going to
[1:05:59] believe who are we going to trust it
[1:06:01] takes God we have to bring now every
[1:06:04] thought in the Captivity to The
[1:06:07] Obedience of Jesus Christ amen the
[1:06:10] acceptance or rejecting belongs in our
[1:06:14] minds the Battleground the Gateway
[1:06:16] belongs in our minds are we going to
[1:06:18] accept it are we going to rejected how
[1:06:20] many times have you heard the phrase how

[1:06:35] of acceptance or rejecting what are they
[1:06:37] going to believe what are they going to
[1:06:38] accept which way are they going to go
[1:06:40] what are they going to do amen and
[1:06:42] there's so many different outside
[1:06:45] influences that would uh that would
[1:06:48] cause the decision to be one way or the
[1:06:50] other amen how many things happen to
[1:06:53] decide well if I if I do this or if I do
[1:06:56] it this way this is going to happen

[1:07:09] to happen if I don't do this this is
[1:07:11] going to happen or this won't happen or
[1:07:13] decisions this is going to make and how
[1:07:15] many times you heard his testimony how
[1:07:17] many times you heard my testimony how
[1:07:18] many testimonies have you had personally
[1:07:21] where you said that God came on the
[1:07:23] scene and said well this is the way you
[1:07:25] do this
[1:07:26] this how you do that and this is how
[1:07:28] amen reminds me uh too of what brother
[1:07:33] Pat gave his testimony about when he was
[1:07:35] working on his job and uh fixing
[1:07:38] Machinery I think at Hughes and uh
[1:07:41] something would break down on the
[1:07:42] machine he go up to the machine I have a
[1:07:45] clue I I know the machine but I don't
[1:07:47] know what's wrong with it I don't know
[1:07:48] how to fix it I don't know what to do
[1:07:49] about it but then God comes on and he
[1:07:52] says do this and this and whatever have
[1:07:54] it work to him and and he goes does what
[1:07:57] the Lord puts on his mind on his heart
[1:07:58] he does it machine
[1:08:01] fixed praise the Lord amen I I I've done
[1:08:05] that before and just pray over it and
[1:08:08] and it just start working that's right
[1:08:10] not not a machine or you know uh
[1:08:12] whatever the circumstance was and it
[1:08:14] just happened am and well it just
[1:08:17] happened so praise the Lord I don't know
[1:08:19] what I did but it
[1:08:21] works amen well see a lot of people put
[1:08:24] that off I don't put things like that
[1:08:26] off see I serve a living God I serve a
[1:08:29] real God I serve a God that's alive I
[1:08:32] serve a God who who uh wants to do for
[1:08:35] me most times more than I want him to do
[1:08:39] right and he's sitting there just
[1:08:40] waiting just ask amen just ask just come
[1:08:44] before me just talk to me amen that's
[1:08:46] all he's looking for we though bring
[1:08:50] every thought into captivity amen we
[1:08:53] can't be
[1:08:56] allow those things to continue to
[1:08:58] pulsate in us before we recognize now
[1:09:01] let's go over to First
[1:09:03] Peter amen first Peter I I I will tell
[1:09:07] you I plan on delivering all is on my
[1:09:08] heart today uh the main point I wanted
[1:09:11] to make to us today was the
[1:09:13] understanding that uh that that brother
[1:09:15] Rand made that Satan chose the
[1:09:18] intellects amen God chose the heart
[1:09:21] Satan chose the intellect and the
[1:09:22] intellect is that Gateway the intellect
[1:09:25] is that Battleground the intellect is
[1:09:27] that place that we fight all the time
[1:09:30] amen all the time that's where Satan
[1:09:32] comes to you that's where Satan tries to
[1:09:35] deceive you that's where Satan tries to
[1:09:37] talk to you and make you think that
[1:09:39] you're something that you're not or or
[1:09:40] vice versa or uh put things in your mind
[1:09:43] and thoughts he'll have you Satan will
[1:09:45] have you apologizing repenting for
[1:09:47] thoughts he put there that weren't even
[1:09:48] your thoughts to begin with they were
[1:09:49] his that's right and he saying I'm sorry
[1:09:52] Lord sorry for what it's his thought not
[1:09:53] yours yes that's right but we have the
[1:09:56] responsibility to cast that thought down
[1:09:59] we have the responsibility to bring that
[1:10:01] thought captive Amen to The Obedience of
[1:10:05] Christ the word not act upon it but
[1:10:07] bring it captive praise the Lord first
[1:10:10] Peter now chapter uh chapter
[1:10:12] 1 verse
[1:10:17] 13 but as I said I was going to I wanted
[1:10:21] to deliver what was on my heart today I
[1:10:23] I did more or less cut out a song in the
[1:10:26] song service and uh maybe shorten this a
[1:10:28] little bit and it was a little easier
[1:10:30] because uh we'll pick up next week where
[1:10:32] we left off today if there is a next
[1:10:34] week so First Peter chapter 1 Let's uh
[1:10:38] let's begin with verse
[1:10:41] 13 uh 1 Peter
[1:10:44] 13 wherefore now listen to this
[1:10:47] wherefore gir up your loin G up the
[1:10:50] loins of your mind G up the loins and
[1:10:54] now we don't talk like that today right
[1:10:57] that's not the kind of bacular we use
[1:10:59] normally in our everyday conversation so
[1:11:02] what is he talking about let's let's
[1:11:04] move on or continue to read we'll come
[1:11:06] back wherefore gir up the loins of your
[1:11:09] mind be sober and hope to the end for
[1:11:14] the grace that is to be brought to you
[1:11:15] at the revelation of Jesus Christ as
[1:11:19] obedient children not fashioning
[1:11:22] yourselves according to the former lust
[1:11:24] in your ignorance but as he which has
[1:11:28] called you is Holy so be ye holy in all
[1:11:33] manner of conversation how do we do that
[1:11:35] by bringing every thought captive right
[1:11:38] amen bringing every thought captive it's
[1:11:41] easy too especially if you're out in the
[1:11:43] world or have a secular job like I do
[1:11:46] that the thoughts will come you you work
[1:11:48] I I work with
[1:11:51] with for lack of better phraseology
[1:11:53] sinners
[1:11:55] I I I I work with guys that don't know
[1:11:58] what we know aren't aren't born again um
[1:12:01] that say things and do things and and
[1:12:04] and the devil always especially bring
[1:12:06] back from maybe your old life and
[1:12:09] something is said you got to bring that
[1:12:11] thing captive amen because our manner of
[1:12:15] life is a holy life our manner of
[1:12:19] conversation is a holy conversation
[1:12:21] hallelujah amen because it is written be
[1:12:25] holy for I am Holy what is that now
[1:12:27] bring every thought captive look at this
[1:12:30] let's go back to the 13th verse
[1:12:32] wherefore gird up that is the Cinch that
[1:12:36] is like a belt uh to keep my pants from
[1:12:39] falling down I gird them up with my belt
[1:12:43] amen it's also good for a microphone
[1:12:45] holder but I GD them up amen and it says
[1:12:50] G up CCH up uh that means M maintain
[1:12:54] control control over uh keep in uh in
[1:12:59] contact together uh don't lose control
[1:13:03] over which I would lose control of my
[1:13:05] pants if my belt was on don't lose
[1:13:08] control over gir up amen wherefore gird
[1:13:12] up the loins the loins is the place of
[1:13:16] reproduction amen your loin area is the
[1:13:18] place of reproduction the Bible speaks
[1:13:20] of it many times about the protection
[1:13:22] you go back to Ephesians 6 talks about
[1:13:25] the protection of the loins there's a
[1:13:27] reason for that it's the reproductive
[1:13:30] part naturally the reproductive part of
[1:13:33] a physical being is in the loin area
[1:13:37] amen the loin area of your mind is the
[1:13:41] reproductive area so we are to gir up or
[1:13:44] cinch or control keep control over gir
[1:13:49] up the loins of your
[1:13:51] mind the reproductive part of your mind
[1:13:55] what does that do that that helps us be
[1:13:58] able to control what we do yes and how
[1:14:01] we act and how we speak and what we look
[1:14:05] at amen all the things the sea taste
[1:14:08] feel smell here even amen
[1:14:12] um one of the guys last week they we
[1:14:15] were uh at a restaurant eating and the
[1:14:17] rest it was a very good food and I had a
[1:14:20] root beer and of course they drink but
[1:14:22] uh they had uh they had uh shots of
[1:14:26] tequila I think after anyway and and the
[1:14:29] one guy kept picking on me here you know
[1:14:32] I I it'd be something to see him I said
[1:14:34] well um it'd be something to see a pig
[1:14:37] fly over this restaurant too but that's
[1:14:38] not going to happen either
[1:14:42] so you you can think or wish or whatever
[1:14:45] all you want but it's not going to
[1:14:47] happen and it does see the tastes even
[1:14:51] part of it see uh
[1:14:55] so many those things those endless come
[1:14:57] into play that's why the Bible says to
[1:15:00] grow but where does it start starts in
[1:15:02] the mind doesn't start with your nose I
[1:15:04] mean that's where it comes in or with
[1:15:06] your eyes that's that's an inlet that's
[1:15:08] how we look but but it starts with your
[1:15:11] mind the battle doesn't start with your
[1:15:13] eyes it starts with your mind because
[1:15:14] the mind is processing what it's seeing
[1:15:17] and if it's seeing something that's to
[1:15:18] the lust of the flesh it becomes a
[1:15:20] desirable thing to the mind but then
[1:15:24] with the heart but when your heart takes
[1:15:26] over and and you as a as a as a
[1:15:30] Christian you as a as a Godly person
[1:15:34] decide that is not what you want to
[1:15:38] entertain uh or to become a part of your
[1:15:41] your your intellect you're a part of
[1:15:43] your being you reject that now it's easy
[1:15:46] sometimes maybe if you're looking at
[1:15:48] something all you got to do is close
[1:15:49] your eyes and turn away that's why
[1:15:50] brother Brandon put a cross in his car
[1:15:52] Amen brother green talked about that
[1:15:54] lady just stared at it going across the
[1:15:56] street said now see that's what we have
[1:15:57] to we have to be careful of Amen put a
[1:16:00] cross in his car so when something like
[1:16:02] that happens he looks to the Cross amen
[1:16:06] simple seems like all those things those
[1:16:08] are those that that is a process of
[1:16:11] girting up your loin the reaper so when
[1:16:14] it hits the mind it doesn't replicate
[1:16:17] itself Hallelujah because see that's
[1:16:19] what a virus on a computer will do uh
[1:16:22] it'll put a virus in there and it'll
[1:16:23] start replicating itself and as it does
[1:16:26] that it starts eating away at the good
[1:16:28] stuff in your computer right amen and
[1:16:30] replicating and replicating uh that's
[1:16:34] the thing we want to avoid it to be
[1:16:36] replicated that's why it says G up the
[1:16:39] reproductive take control over the
[1:16:41] reproductive part of your mind so it
[1:16:43] doesn't come out as an act in your flesh
[1:16:46] or so it doesn't come out as a word in
[1:16:48] your through your mouth or or something
[1:16:51] that you entertain you get rid of it you
[1:16:54] control it you take uh uh you take
[1:16:57] control over it so it doesn't become a
[1:16:59] part of what you do or what you say or
[1:17:01] how you act that's why we control it
[1:17:05] that's why the the spirit of God is in
[1:17:07] us to keep control over that but see
[1:17:09] that is our responsibility too because
[1:17:12] we are free moral agents we are free
[1:17:14] moral agents to the point of acceptance
[1:17:17] or rejecting we can do it if we want to
[1:17:20] if you want to accept it you can accept
[1:17:23] it right if you want to reject it you
[1:17:26] can reject it amen and that many times
[1:17:29] that boils down to how much Victory you
[1:17:31] got in life right how close you living
[1:17:34] to the Lord yes amen that boils down to
[1:17:38] am am I in the position am I in that
[1:17:41] place that I receive that or do I reject
[1:17:44] that because we all have the decision to
[1:17:46] make if we're going to or not amen amen
[1:17:49] if we're going to if we're going to
[1:17:51] receive it then it's something that
[1:17:53] becomes a part of us
[1:17:56] amen obviously something you can repent
[1:17:58] for but we don't even want to entertain
[1:18:00] it we don't even want that to be a part
[1:18:02] of us amen we want to reject that and
[1:18:05] get rid of that not let that be a part
[1:18:06] of our Lives that's why it says G up I
[1:18:09] know it's not language we used today but
[1:18:11] G up that reproductive part of your mind
[1:18:15] amen that that reproductive part of your
[1:18:18] mind so that it does not reproduce
[1:18:20] something that's
[1:18:22] ungodly amen we want our lives to be
[1:18:24] lived as holy that's why it goes on to
[1:18:27] talk about controlling our conversation
[1:18:29] letting our conversation be holy letting
[1:18:31] Our Lives be holy be ye therefore holy
[1:18:34] as he is Holy amen amen everything about
[1:18:37] it being according to Christ and the
[1:18:39] word yes now I want to go over uh to
[1:18:43] Proverbs I want to finish here read just
[1:18:46] read one verse of
[1:18:51] scripture one verse of scripture
[1:18:57] amen Proverbs chapter
[1:18:59] 3 we'll read one verse of
[1:19:03] scripture and then we'll
[1:19:06] close Proverbs
[1:19:13] 3:5 they must have hit something up
[1:19:15] there they had that fixed Proverbs 3:5
[1:19:18] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[1:19:22] amen a mind heart trust in the Lord with
[1:19:26] all thine heart the place God
[1:19:30] chose the man's
[1:19:32] heart trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:19:35] heart and lean not unto thine own
[1:19:39] understanding we don't lean on our own
[1:19:42] understanding we lean on his amen we
[1:19:45] don't lean on our own words we lean on
[1:19:47] his we don't lean on our own ways we
[1:19:50] lean on his amen everything about it is
[1:19:53] Godly
[1:19:55] everything about our lives is Godly but
[1:19:58] when the devil if I leave you with this
[1:20:00] today the Devil comes to try to bring
[1:20:03] that thought something you know it's a
