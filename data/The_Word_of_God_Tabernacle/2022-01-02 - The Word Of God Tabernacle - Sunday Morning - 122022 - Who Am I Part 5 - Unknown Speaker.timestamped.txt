[20:29] right brother dennis but we do want to
[20:30] remember sister leah in prayer lord
[20:32] would just touch her that you know when
[20:34] you do something all your life and it
[20:37] just becomes routine a part of life when
[20:39] that part changes kind of throws you for
[20:41] a loop a little bit so just pray the
[20:43] lord and some people don't adjust to
[20:45] that well
[20:46] some people would retire or force
[20:49] retired or whatever and they just don't
[20:50] adjust to that very well i was working
[20:52] for an old client and
[20:55] sonya works a little bit for her now
[20:57] mary
[20:58] and
[20:58] her son doesn't want her to work anymore
[21:00] i said well what do you want to do
[21:02] i said you need to do what makes you
[21:04] happy
[21:05] if working makes you happy then go to
[21:07] work
[21:08] forget about him if that's what makes
[21:10] you happy if that's what you want to do
[21:12] do that
[21:13] if you want to sit around and play cards
[21:15] or bingo or something or go socialize
[21:17] and spend time with your friends go to
[21:19] senior center and all that then do that
[21:20] that's fine that's kind of what he wants
[21:22] her to do but i said but if you want to
[21:24] work and that's what
[21:26] gives you pleasure do that work

[34:30] um he's
[34:31] almost back to the same old jewel he was
[34:33] before

[44:01] of this lord this service now as we
[44:03] committed to you and ask your blessings
[44:05] upon it in the name of the lord jesus
[44:07] christ we pray amen amen amen genesis
[44:10] chapter 1
[44:12] we'll begin reading with verse 1 in the
[44:14] beginning
[44:15] god created the heaven and the earth and
[44:18] the earth was without form and void
[44:20] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[44:22] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[44:25] face of the waters you could be seated
[44:27] if you'd like
[44:30] and god created the heaven and the earth
[44:31] of course the bible says in the
[44:33] beginning we've been dealing on the who
[44:35] am i
[44:36] uh not really sure what we're going to
[44:39] title this today but we've been dealing
[44:40] with who am i and my intention and my
[44:43] study yesterday was to kind of finish
[44:45] that up today uh but after this morning
[44:47] and in my prayer
[44:50] i kind of felt something different a
[44:51] little bit and then when i started
[44:53] looking at it i thought well lord you
[44:54] can we can just bring these two together
[44:56] because it kind of run congruently so
[44:59] again
[45:00] we'll just see whatever the lord has in
[45:02] store and where he wants to take it from
[45:04] here so we look at the bible it says in
[45:07] the beginning now we know in the
[45:08] beginning god
[45:10] god created the heavenly earth so many
[45:12] times again we have to use the verbiage
[45:14] in the beginning because
[45:15] you know our
[45:17] little human pee brains can't even begin
[45:19] to fathom what eternity is and the fact
[45:21] that they're never really in here was
[45:22] the beginning but
[45:24] for scripture purposes and for our
[45:26] purposes we look at in the beginning god
[45:29] created the heaven and the earth the
[45:30] earth was without form and void and
[45:34] darkness was upon the face of the water
[45:36] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[45:38] face of the water now we know the
[45:40] transition period that made the
[45:42] difference here was the fact that god
[45:45] spoke and when god's word came out and
[45:47] understanding here that the spirit of
[45:50] god moved upon the face of the waters
[45:53] that when that when that logos came out
[45:55] of god and began to brood over the earth
[45:58] it was that word it was that presence it
[46:01] was that thought as we know the the
[46:03] logos that thought or concept that came
[46:05] out of god
[46:07] uh basically
[46:08] god's intellectual property like we've
[46:10] been talking about through this series
[46:12] the thought of god the logos of god that
[46:15] came out of him that was expressed forth
[46:18] from god that brewed upon this earth
[46:21] that that changed this earth because it
[46:24] was without form and void and darkness
[46:27] covered everything friend that sounded
[46:28] like me before i became a christian
[46:31] i was void i was worthless i was
[46:34] wasteland i was nothing but total
[46:37] darkness but then the spirit of god come
[46:40] and moved on me and you and that's why
[46:43] we're here today and when the spirit of
[46:44] god moved it changed us
[46:46] it developed and come into something
[46:49] that was be pleasing to the lord
[46:51] something that was beautiful in the eyes
[46:53] of the lord and that was his purpose but
[46:55] we have to be continually willing in
[46:58] this new year willing to be molded and
[47:00] shaped into the image of god yes we know
[47:03] we've talked about that seed that's
[47:05] inside but you know we also understand
[47:08] that in this life and fulfilling the
[47:10] purpose of god in our lives through that
[47:12] adoption that that we have that purpose
[47:15] in our own body in our own flesh to be
[47:18] able to fulfill jesus came god that
[47:20] logos came down and manifested itself in
[47:24] the body of jesus christ so that it
[47:26] might fulfill the purpose of what that
[47:28] body came to do well if it was to
[47:30] fulfill the purpose that that body came
[47:33] to do then can't we allow it and even
[47:36] more this year to allow it that that
[47:38] that logos would continue to come and
[47:40] brood through us and fulfill that
[47:43] purpose that he called for me and for
[47:45] you to do
[47:46] that's the whole point to make it
[47:48] more than what it seems more than what
[47:51] the world would say or more than what
[47:53] the world would determine but what god
[47:55] almighty has determined when god before
[47:58] the foundation the world put your name
[48:00] in the lamb's book of life he had a
[48:02] purpose for you he had a reason for you
[48:05] and like i said when we first opened the
[48:07] service here you know we're in a new
[48:09] year
[48:10] and if the lord doesn't come this year i
[48:12] agree with brother tom's prayer and i'm
[48:14] looking for him this year but if he
[48:17] doesn't come this year i want to do one
[48:19] thing and that's to become closer to him
[48:22] i want to become more like the lord
[48:24] jesus i don't want this to be just a
[48:26] wasted void dark year i want it to be a
[48:30] year of of joy and of happiness and of
[48:33] and of growing closer to god
[48:36] fulfilling god's purpose in my life
[48:38] letting him take full control but now
[48:41] with that spirit let's look at this now
[48:43] with that spirit that logos came out of
[48:45] god and began to move upon the earth it
[48:48] began to brood over the earth it reached
[48:50] the place through the light and through
[48:52] the heavens and through the earth and
[48:54] through the seas and the firmaments and
[48:57] all god come to the 26th verse and he
[49:00] said let us make man
[49:03] in our image
[49:04] after our likeness and let them have
[49:07] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[49:10] over the fowl of the air and over the
[49:11] cattle and over all the earth and over
[49:13] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[49:15] the earth god made us in his own image
[49:18] he purposely made us that way now that
[49:21] was spirit man that god originally made
[49:23] because god is a spirit and he made us
[49:26] that spirit well what was that that was
[49:29] nothing more than god himself coming in
[49:31] and producing the result that he desired
[49:34] to see when he made us man woman
[49:38] he made us in his mind that's what he
[49:40] desired to see so that's what he
[49:42] produced that's what he spoke
[49:44] and when he spoke it it came to pass
[49:47] but he made us in that image you can
[49:49] understand even
[49:52] even all
[49:53] humans not just christians are made in
[49:55] the image of god
[49:57] everyone
[49:58] by that spirit man that god had formed
[50:01] in the beginning
[50:03] so god created man
[50:05] in his own image
[50:07] praise the lord
[50:08] i thank god that i am in his own image
[50:11] in his own likeness
[50:13] that helps me to understand that
[50:16] i can get closer to him you know brother
[50:18] bannon said
[50:20] if you want more of god
[50:23] all that proves if there's more of god
[50:26] for you to have yes amen and if there's
[50:29] more of god for us to have friends why
[50:32] would we want it
[50:34] it's so sad
[50:36] and i'm sorry but it just burns my heart
[50:38] so much when i see a person or you see
[50:42] it a situation
[50:44] where people it's almost like they
[50:46] become content to the point or not
[50:49] content we're supposed to be content but
[50:52] complacent that everything is okay
[50:56] it's like people sometimes feel like
[50:58] they've reached that pinnacle and i'll
[51:01] just coast my way into heaven it doesn't
[51:04] work that way
[51:06] we must continue to press and fight the
[51:08] good fight of faith
[51:10] to press this battle and to obey god's
[51:13] word and you know brother adam said if
[51:15] you want to get closer to god we know
[51:16] what the formula is
[51:19] read your bible and pray every day right
[51:21] you want to get closer to god so in my
[51:24] exclamation this morning and my desire
[51:27] to be closer to him comes with a recipe
[51:31] yes and that is to get closer to him by
[51:33] reading my bible and praying every day
[51:36] that's the prescription
[51:38] that's the recipe if you go to make a
[51:40] cake and you look and it says two pounds
[51:42] of sugar and you put two pounds of salt
[51:44] that cake's not gonna be fifteen
[51:47] amen
[51:48] you gotta do it the way it says to do it
[51:51] right you got to follow the recipe the
[51:53] way that it's laid out yes if you put in
[51:56] the ingredients you think well i think
[51:58] we should have six eggs instead of two
[52:01] i i think we should have uh 10 pounds of
[52:04] flour instead of a half a pound or or we
[52:06] should have a
[52:07] two cups of salt or pepper let's just
[52:10] put some habanero in there that's going
[52:12] to be the nastiest cake you ever tried
[52:13] to put in your mouth
[52:15] yes
[52:16] but if you follow the recipe
[52:18] if you follow the prescription see and
[52:20] that's god is molding us and making us
[52:23] and shaping us into his own image the
[52:25] way he wants us to be he is the potter
[52:28] we are the clay we are to die to
[52:30] ourselves that god can be allowed to
[52:33] mold us the way he wants us and this new
[52:36] year friend if there's ever a revolution
[52:39] or resolution that we should have it is
[52:41] that
[52:42] god mold me more this year help me to
[52:45] get closer to you i don't want to become
[52:48] complacent
[52:49] i don't want to get eased in zion i
[52:52] don't want to get to the place that i
[52:54] feel like i'm comfortable and i'm okay
[52:56] god i'm good you can leave me alone now
[52:59] no i don't want that right
[53:02] sometimes it takes a a mountain
[53:06] sometimes it takes a a cutting
[53:10] sometimes it takes a shaping or a
[53:12] molding and it doesn't feel good
[53:15] but god does it for our own good
[53:18] because that's just his way of showing
[53:20] me he loves me
[53:22] because he wants me going down the right
[53:24] path
[53:25] if he knows this is going to cause me to
[53:26] go down the wrong path he's going to do
[53:29] something to cause me to go down the
[53:30] right path
[53:32] amen because he knows down the road what
[53:34] it's going to end up being
[53:36] but i don't want to become complacent i
[53:38] was oh i'm in the message who cares okay
[53:41] fine
[53:42] what does that mean right
[53:44] i mean you know i i
[53:46] i don't mean this sacrilegious friend
[53:48] but some people come and that's their
[53:50] whole moniker right right it's like
[53:52] brother adam asked those people are you
[53:54] a christian oh i light a candle every
[53:56] night
[53:58] well what's that got to do with it right
[53:59] i ask another lady are you a christian
[54:01] oh i'm methodist
[54:03] like what has that got to do with being
[54:05] a christian it's almost today he goes oh
[54:08] i'm in the message that's not what i
[54:10] wanted to know right right are you a
[54:12] christian that's what i want to know
[54:15] amen amen now i believe if you're a true
[54:17] godly christian fuel the holy ghost
[54:19] it'll lead you into that word
[54:22] right into that message which is christ
[54:24] but people use it as a moniker of
[54:28] of some kind of covering like a religion
[54:31] friend
[54:32] if we're not getting closer to christ
[54:35] every day we're losing ground every day
[54:37] that's right
[54:38] we should be working and and striving to
[54:42] get more like him every single day he
[54:44] made us in his own image he created us
[54:46] in his own likeness male and female
[54:49] created he them
[54:52] male infant male and feminist spirit he
[54:55] created us so what is our responsibility
[54:58] this continued to press forward and and
[55:00] that that gods give us to do we we we
[55:03] went through this chart that we had last
[55:05] week ephesians how paul laid this out
[55:09] from before the foundation of the world
[55:11] and in the mind of god and predestinated
[55:14] coming to this earth and god redeeming
[55:17] us back to himself revealing himself and
[55:19] his word to us so we can grow in grace
[55:21] and then bringing us to an end to an
[55:23] inheritance back to him again amen
[55:26] hallelujah praise the lord
[55:29] all this god's taken care of but what
[55:31] about this part here in the middle that
[55:34] we're responsible for we're responsible
[55:37] for this part here yes amen god did the
[55:41] redemptive plan we have to receive it
[55:44] and accept it and become it
[55:46] so that that revelation of the word
[55:48] could come and reveal itself to you that
[55:51] you can grow in grace in the knowledge
[55:53] of the lord jesus
[55:55] that's how we grow that that word is
[55:57] revealed it becomes a part of us
[56:00] it comes to that place where brother
[56:01] adam said god didn't just have a human
[56:04] cell and then a pig sell and then a dog
[56:06] sell and then a cat sell and then a crow
[56:09] sail no no it's a human cell and sell
[56:12] themselves
[56:14] if it's god it's cell on cell and so
[56:16] when god's creating in the womb of a
[56:18] woman he's creating a human being it's a
[56:22] human cell on top of a human cell on top
[56:24] of a human cell
[56:26] well he's doing the same thing with
[56:28] us i'll praise the lord
[56:31] it's got to be word on top of a word on
[56:33] top of word for it to be a word body
[56:36] right yes to be a word individual
[56:40] and the growth stops
[56:42] when we're horizontal
[56:44] amen or god takes us from this earth in
[56:46] a rapture right which is what i'm
[56:48] looking forward to first and foremost
[56:51] god may choose me to take the other way
[56:52] and that's his choice and i'm okay with
[56:54] that but i sure would like to see that
[56:57] rapture i sure would like to be a part
[57:00] of that alive and remain group right but
[57:02] if it's not his will that's okay but i
[57:04] want to grow and grow and grow and be
[57:06] into the place that i get so close to
[57:08] god that people can't tell the
[57:10] difference between me and him
[57:14] you know what happens when they can't
[57:15] tell the difference between you and
[57:17] christ
[57:18] that's when they start to really
[57:20] persecute you right that's when they
[57:22] really start to hate you
[57:24] amen that's when they get him right the
[57:28] more christ lived his life
[57:30] and the more in the image of his father
[57:32] he became and the more of the works of
[57:35] god he did people begin to
[57:38] hate him more and more and more till it
[57:41] led them to a crucifixion
[57:44] amen
[57:45] you get to that place friend people are
[57:47] going to hate you more and more and more
[57:49] let's go to let's go to
[57:52] saint john chapter one
[57:59] this is not a resolution or a rev um
[58:02] a new year's resolution
[58:04] i'm trying to straighten my grammar a
[58:07] little better
[58:09] i personally don't like hearing people
[58:11] say i'm going to
[58:14] i am going to
[58:16] go to you here people who are supposed
[58:17] to be professional speakers and i'm
[58:19] going to
[58:20] if you're getting 250 000 a year to talk
[58:24] at least talk right
[58:26] if i gotta listen to you at least say it
[58:28] correctly so i'm trying my best i know
[58:30] i'm as guilty as anybody but i'm trying
[58:33] my best go to
[58:35] not go to
[58:36] yeah but you know i was raised in a home
[58:38] where
[58:39] when you walk through the when you walk
[58:41] through the door your sister would say
[58:43] cut on the light
[58:44] right
[58:46] you got a knife
[58:48] if you got a knife i'll cut it on
[58:51] so
[58:53] so give me a little bit of slack
[58:55] uh sometimes
[58:57] you you got to grow out of certain
[58:59] things so i'm trying to not say those
[59:02] things that way so we're going to
[59:04] saint john chapter one
[59:06] saint john chapter one i know i'll fall
[59:08] many times so forgive me if i do
[59:11] but i'll try to correct it if i do
[59:13] saint john 1 1. in the beginning
[59:16] was the word that's the logos
[59:19] it meant the word
[59:20] the logos it came out of god that
[59:22] intellectual property that came out of
[59:24] god
[59:25] the word
[59:27] and the word was with god and the word
[59:29] was god people say i wonder who them
[59:31] them was well it's god
[59:34] amen that's that's all the them is
[59:36] people want to go back to the scripture
[59:39] we read in genesis as justifying the
[59:41] trinity and saying see there he said
[59:43] them
[59:44] who do you think god is
[59:47] that's who he is amen
[59:50] but without a revelation you you won't
[59:52] see it
[59:53] can't see it
[59:54] the word the logos was with god and the
[59:57] logos the word was god
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:02] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:00:06] that same that logos that word because
[1:00:08] it is god
[1:00:09] it is him it is with him it is him doing
[1:00:14] it it's all him amen so that logos but
[1:00:18] that logos was just that intellectual
[1:00:20] property that that that part of god that
[1:00:23] came out of god yes and and again brood
[1:00:26] over the earth
[1:00:28] this logos became manifest when he stood
[1:00:31] in the flesh of melchizedek
[1:00:34] it manifested itself when it when it
[1:00:36] stood in the flesh of the the one that
[1:00:39] came to abraham
[1:00:41] uh it visited us when it came in the
[1:00:43] form of uh
[1:00:45] uh jesus christ of course now it took on
[1:00:48] many other forms uh it used to lead the
[1:00:51] children of israel a cloud by day and a
[1:00:53] pillar of fire by night
[1:00:55] same one
[1:00:57] it's still god still low god still god
[1:00:59] leading his children it came when paul
[1:01:02] was struck down on the road and and he
[1:01:04] said why persecutest thou me he said who
[1:01:07] are you great like i am jesus
[1:01:11] who you persecute yeah in the beginning
[1:01:13] was the word the logos came out of god
[1:01:16] it's the same god it brewed over the
[1:01:18] earth changed all the earth to what we
[1:01:20] live in today it's doing the same thing
[1:01:23] now it's shining his light look at this
[1:01:26] all things were made by him which we
[1:01:29] read over in ephesians and and
[1:01:32] i haven't read colossians but
[1:01:34] uh all things were made by him and
[1:01:36] without him was not anything made that
[1:01:38] was made
[1:01:39] in him was life
[1:01:41] now brother adam tells us that life is
[1:01:43] zoe of course you go look at the greek
[1:01:46] you see z-o-e zoe i think it's
[1:01:48] pronounced a little differently in the
[1:01:50] hebrew but i'll say it the way he said
[1:01:53] zoe which is as he taught us the literal
[1:01:57] life of god
[1:02:00] the literal life of god not figurative
[1:02:03] this is not an allegory this is literal
[1:02:06] zoe the literal life of god in him was
[1:02:09] that life and the life was what the
[1:02:12] light
[1:02:13] of man amen that light that come to
[1:02:16] shine upon our pathway the same life
[1:02:19] that led the children of israel the same
[1:02:21] life that struck paul down the same
[1:02:24] light that came to you and i the same
[1:02:26] light that's in the pictures with
[1:02:27] brother branham over his head and on his
[1:02:29] shoulders the same light same light that
[1:02:31] came on the day of pentecost the same
[1:02:33] light that comes in our services friend
[1:02:35] whether you can visibly see it or not it
[1:02:38] is here amen
[1:02:39] it's that light
[1:02:41] that light is the light of men
[1:02:43] that light lights up our pathway and
[1:02:46] even if it's just a step at a time that
[1:02:48] light lights up our pathway it brings us
[1:02:51] to that place now that light
[1:02:54] is to shine or make manifest now what
[1:02:58] does the world hate
[1:03:00] the most light
[1:03:04] people of the world ungodly
[1:03:06] heathen demonic spirits
[1:03:09] people hate light more than anything
[1:03:12] right because it exposes their deeds
[1:03:15] their deeds that are wicked and evil it
[1:03:18] exposes them so when you are that light
[1:03:21] which is the life
[1:03:23] and you become brighter and your life
[1:03:26] becomes more like god and that light
[1:03:28] shines through you do you think the
[1:03:30] world is going to enjoy when their deeds
[1:03:33] are exposed by you
[1:03:38] look i i i gotta say this
[1:03:43] and i i'm just
[1:03:45] i'm just saying what the lord puts on my
[1:03:46] heart amen
[1:03:48] yes
[1:03:50] but that's why
[1:03:53] and this man by no means
[1:03:55] was
[1:03:57] uh
[1:03:59] a saint
[1:04:01] but that's why they hated donald trump
[1:04:04] so much
[1:04:05] because what he did was uncover a lot of
[1:04:09] the darkness that we already knew was
[1:04:11] there i mean you know the politics i
[1:04:14] mean
[1:04:15] for years and years and years politics
[1:04:17] is just as crooked as a three dollar
[1:04:19] bill on the dolphin leg it's always been
[1:04:22] crooked we know that
[1:04:24] it's just getting worse because the
[1:04:26] spirit of darkness is infiltrating in
[1:04:28] this earth even more but they hated him
[1:04:30] because he exposed that right he he
[1:04:33] brought light on that
[1:04:35] and that little bit of light that i
[1:04:37] believe god allowed to be shot on that
[1:04:40] corrupt stuff
[1:04:42] was the biggest reason they hated the
[1:04:44] man so much
[1:04:46] amen good bad you like him not like him
[1:04:50] a great president bad president good
[1:04:52] policies bad policies whatever you want
[1:04:54] to think about the man he brought light
[1:04:57] upon all the darkness up in that swamp
[1:05:00] yes
[1:05:01] and they hated him for it
[1:05:03] and they'll hate you the same way yes
[1:05:05] you've become more like the light you
[1:05:07] become more like god
[1:05:10] you know brother bran
[1:05:11] don't don't take this wrong but you know
[1:05:13] brother branham said it
[1:05:16] that about people worshiping him and
[1:05:18] baptizing in his name which we know is
[1:05:21] heathenism
[1:05:23] that brother random fought his entire
[1:05:24] life for the snake he cut the head off
[1:05:27] the snake and it wiggled into into water
[1:05:29] remember the vision yes
[1:05:31] cut the head off it wiggled it into
[1:05:33] water what's water it's multitudes of
[1:05:34] people
[1:05:35] so that just went into the people so
[1:05:38] these people still do that
[1:05:40] but you know what he said
[1:05:42] he said if if that wasn't going on i'd
[1:05:44] have to repent for my ministry
[1:05:47] sure he said i wouldn't consider myself
[1:05:50] living as close to jesus christ as i
[1:05:52] should be if people didn't miss
[1:05:55] if people did not mistake me for him
[1:05:59] he would not be fulfilling the ministry
[1:06:02] god gave him right
[1:06:05] that's pretty close friend
[1:06:08] amen what
[1:06:09] better thing for any of us to aspire to
[1:06:12] now i hope you understand
[1:06:15] what i'm talking about we're not calling
[1:06:17] brother brown of god by no means neither
[1:06:18] was he doing that in himself
[1:06:20] but he's helping us understand that the
[1:06:22] calling in his life was to bring him to
[1:06:25] a place that he would manifest christ so
[1:06:28] closely
[1:06:29] that people could see christ not brother
[1:06:31] brown
[1:06:32] that's why brother random all the time
[1:06:34] was continuously pointing us to christ
[1:06:38] every bit every chance he could people
[1:06:40] say oh he considered him no he didn't
[1:06:43] if you ever listen to those tapes you'll
[1:06:45] see how hard brother branham fought that
[1:06:47] spirit and how much he tried to turn the
[1:06:49] hearts of the people to christ
[1:06:51] not himself
[1:06:53] john the baptist did the same thing to
[1:06:55] the point john said i'm going to
[1:06:57] decrease so that he increases yes
[1:07:00] i'm the i i was i was praying yesterday
[1:07:03] i said got it i don't know how many more
[1:07:05] years he's got for me or maybe it was
[1:07:07] this morning
[1:07:09] and but i feel like brother brown did
[1:07:12] brother random got up in 40
[1:07:15] 44 45 and he's passed when he's 56
[1:07:18] is that right did he diamond he's 56
[1:07:20] i've just turned 56
[1:07:22] and i thought lord i feel kind of like
[1:07:24] he just said you if you're going to do
[1:07:26] anything for god to better get busy
[1:07:28] right but i thought what better thing to
[1:07:30] do than just continue to grow closer to
[1:07:32] him and more like him and that way he'll
[1:07:33] lead me and lead us and the place that
[1:07:35] he wants us to be and what he wants us
[1:07:37] to do
[1:07:38] amen we can't manufacture anything
[1:07:40] brother brown couldn't manufacture
[1:07:41] anything he couldn't make anything
[1:07:43] happen we just do it as god leads us
[1:07:46] into doing it as the holy spirit brings
[1:07:49] us in the position of being able to
[1:07:51] fulfill that
[1:07:52] that's our only position that's what we
[1:07:54] do because that's who we are by the
[1:07:56] grace of god but that light that lights
[1:07:59] our path that light that is the life of
[1:08:01] men that illuminates from each one that
[1:08:04] is born again of the spirit of god
[1:08:06] reflects jesus christ
[1:08:09] now i know a lot of times some of the
[1:08:11] things that we say or do or the
[1:08:13] attitudes we take or spirits that we
[1:08:15] project or sometimes a little uh a
[1:08:18] temper or something it's far from that
[1:08:20] but god help us to continue to be molded
[1:08:23] to get away from that right not excuse
[1:08:26] it see that's the thing some time that
[1:08:28] you hear people they want to excuse well
[1:08:30] my mama well my daddy no no no i'm not
[1:08:33] i'm not concerned about your mom and
[1:08:34] daddy what i'm concerned about is your
[1:08:36] daddy the lord jesus christ god almighty
[1:08:39] that's who i'm concerned about your life
[1:08:42] oh my daddy had a temper so yeah so
[1:08:46] amen we we have broke that to come
[1:08:49] through to to reflect christ
[1:08:53] and even when they spit in his face and
[1:08:56] he hit him upside the head
[1:08:58] and ridiculed and scored him and
[1:09:01] embarrassed him
[1:09:02] he did not fight back
[1:09:05] he held his peace right amen
[1:09:08] god help us
[1:09:09] amen there's a time to fight there's a
[1:09:11] time to hold your peace
[1:09:12] amen but help me to grow to be more like
[1:09:16] him so that we don't get into our flesh
[1:09:18] so much we don't get into our spirit so
[1:09:22] much but we allow that seed that
[1:09:24] germatized seed that's down on the
[1:09:26] inside of the inside to to grow and
[1:09:28] continue to grow and take control over
[1:09:31] our lives to take precedent in our lives
[1:09:33] so that we grow to the place that god is
[1:09:36] pleased with what we're doing
[1:09:38] it's that zoe life
[1:09:41] that literal life of god
[1:09:43] that
[1:09:45] that was made that life that light that
[1:09:48] was in us the light shineth in the
[1:09:50] darkness the darkness comprehended that
[1:09:52] not right amen they don't want to have
[1:09:54] anything to do with it
[1:09:56] 11th verse he came unto his own now
[1:09:59] saying saint john 1 11 he came unto his
[1:10:02] own his own received him not but as many
[1:10:05] as received him to them gave ye power to
[1:10:08] become the sons of god even to them that
[1:10:11] believe on his name now many people
[1:10:14] think that believing jesus is saying i
[1:10:17] believe
[1:10:19] well the devil believes
[1:10:21] what else you got for me
[1:10:23] but that's what a lot of people hang
[1:10:25] their eternal salvation on oh i believe
[1:10:28] jesus so does the devil
[1:10:30] what do you do about it you know how to
[1:10:32] receive christ is by receiving his word
[1:10:35] yes you know who you know how to believe
[1:10:38] he who has sent him is by believing
[1:10:40] those whom he has sent
[1:10:43] amen and do you believe that
[1:10:46] that would be the question do you
[1:10:47] believe that or do you not
[1:10:50] yes do you believe god sent a prophet in
[1:10:52] this last day or do you not
[1:10:55] do you believe jesus christ came to
[1:10:58] fulfill all the word or do you not
[1:11:01] well if he did then to receive him is to
[1:11:04] receive this word

[1:11:07] i don't care how many times how much you
[1:11:10] express it with your lips that you
[1:11:11] believe jesus you are not a recipient of
[1:11:14] that spirit
[1:11:16] you cannot be if you're disobeying the
[1:11:18] word

[1:11:22] the word
[1:11:23] to receive him as to receive him whom he
[1:11:26] has sent right amen
[1:11:29] thank god because that puts us in a
[1:11:31] position of being able to to be a
[1:11:33] recipient
[1:11:34] as many as received him
[1:11:37] notice it didn't say believed him it

[1:11:56] where you go in there and
[1:12:00] you you're scared to death to sit down

[1:12:27] you you sit down like you're in a museum
[1:12:29] you can't budge
[1:12:31] because you don't feel welcome right and
[1:12:33] that's
[1:12:34] and that's what christ is in a lot of
[1:12:36] people's lives he's not welcome oh they
[1:12:38] said oh come in lord and he'll come in
[1:12:42] brother said he'll go anywhere he's

[1:12:47] jesus with dirty feet
[1:12:49] am i amen he was invited and he went
[1:12:53] he accepted the invitation and showed up
[1:12:55] even knowing that he wasn't going to be
[1:12:57] made welcome and he wasn't set up in the
[1:12:59] corner jesus dirty feet all the
[1:13:01] dignitaries and the rich and smart men
[1:13:03] standing there and flaunting their
[1:13:05] wealth and all and he's sitting over
[1:13:07] there in the corner god almighty with
[1:13:09] dirty feet and nobody to wash them
[1:13:13] hey man
[1:13:14] if i've been there
[1:13:15] been a different story
[1:13:17] but you know friend we've got the
[1:13:18] opportunity today
[1:13:20] to wash his feet
[1:13:22] when the world dirties them up when the
[1:13:24] world don't seem to care when they flop
[1:13:25] in front of you all of the wealth and
[1:13:27] the wisdom and all the things that the
[1:13:29] world has to offer we sat there humbled
[1:13:32] and contrited the feet of christ
[1:13:35] washing his feet
[1:13:38] amen
[1:13:39] believing and knowing that god is going
[1:13:41] to honor that
[1:13:43] because he does
[1:13:45] he honors that in our lives and and
[1:13:47] makes sure that we recognize that
[1:13:49] position so it was easy welcome
[1:13:52] and that's what we want to make sure
[1:13:54] today is he welcome right is he welcome
[1:13:57] in our lives is he welcome in our hearts
[1:14:01] are we welcoming him with the word are
[1:14:03] we welcoming him with his spirit are we
[1:14:06] welcoming him of everything that we do
[1:14:08] in our lives
[1:14:09] to make sure that we don't do anything
[1:14:11] to displease him or cause that spirit
[1:14:14] that anointing to take its flight
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:19] but make sure that the lord stays
[1:14:20] present with us
[1:14:22] amen he is always there
[1:14:25] many has received him that's receiving
[1:14:28] praise the lord that's different than
[1:14:29] believing
[1:14:30] and believing will bring you to
[1:14:32] receiving but receiving is actually
[1:14:34] taking him into your home and him
[1:14:36] feeling welcome
[1:14:38] to them
[1:14:40] gave he power to become the sons of god
[1:14:42] even to them that believe on his name
[1:14:45] which were born not of blood nor the
[1:14:47] will of the flesh nor the will of man
[1:14:49] but of god
[1:14:50] and the word praise the lord that word
[1:14:53] that logos now has come and it was made
[1:14:56] flesh and it dwelt among us we beheld
[1:14:59] his glory the glory is of the only
[1:15:01] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:15:04] truth that word that logos
[1:15:07] came into flesh
[1:15:09] human flesh not melchizedek flesh
[1:15:12] not that came to abraham flesh
[1:15:15] but in the flesh of kinfolk to you and
[1:15:18] me through the womb of a woman
[1:15:20] he placed his spirit in there
[1:15:23] the only way he could do it to redeem
[1:15:26] us back to him
[1:15:27] was to become one of us to become like
[1:15:30] us to become kinfolk the only way
[1:15:32] redemption can happen in the old
[1:15:34] testament is to go is for it to be a
[1:15:38] kinsmen redeemer
[1:15:40] only way
[1:15:41] god's plan of redemption the only way he
[1:15:44] had to become a kinfolk to you and me he
[1:15:47] had to be one of us he had to be like us
[1:15:49] in in
[1:15:50] us
[1:15:51] forming into that very image
[1:15:54] oh praise the lord look at this modern
[1:15:56] events made clear by prophecy
[1:16:00] december 6 1965. now notice
[1:16:03] brother branham made a specific title to
[1:16:05] this
[1:16:07] modern events made clear by prophecy not
[1:16:10] prophecy made clear by modern events
[1:16:13] a lot of times especially these modern
[1:16:15] day prophets they do just the opposite
[1:16:18] of what a true god called word prophet
[1:16:21] does right oh god called word prophet
[1:16:24] has the modern events become clear by
[1:16:27] prophecy not the other way around yes
[1:16:29] prophecy does not become clear by modern
[1:16:32] events but modern events are made clear
[1:16:34] about prophecy that's why he titled it
[1:16:37] as such there's a difference amen listen
[1:16:40] now for uh for you're a gene of your
[1:16:43] father
[1:16:44] you were in your father yet you had no
[1:16:47] fellowship with it because uh you was in
[1:16:49] there but you
[1:16:51] but you knew it not and he knew it not
[1:16:54] but you was manifested
[1:16:56] made known brought forth that you might
[1:16:58] that he might
[1:17:00] fellowship with you and you being born
[1:17:03] again you're born of eternal life look
[1:17:06] at this now
[1:17:08] born of eternal life and that's the only
[1:17:11] one form of eternal life that's god's
[1:17:14] life remember we got into the eternal
[1:17:17] life that eternal life what is that
[1:17:18] eternal life god's life
[1:17:21] the only form of eternity there is is
[1:17:23] god
[1:17:24] so that that eternity that uh that god
[1:17:28] is that life that zoey
[1:17:30] he says you are born of that eternal
[1:17:33] life
[1:17:34] not born into that eternal life because
[1:17:37] that's contrary you can't do that a
[1:17:39] birth denotes a beginning
[1:17:42] a beginning has an end but you are born
[1:17:45] of that eternity
[1:17:48] like we said the the great sphere of
[1:17:51] eternity
[1:17:52] going around in its eternal circle as
[1:17:55] god continues to unfold through it and
[1:17:57] then down on this little corner a blip
[1:17:59] comes out that's time
[1:18:01] and it comes off of that eternity well
[1:18:04] that he turned that time will blend
[1:18:05] right back into that eternity again
[1:18:08] but where we are is of that eternity yes
[1:18:12] we're down in this uh time element life
[1:18:15] but it's from or of that eternal life
[1:18:19] you
[1:18:20] we me
[1:18:21] oh we are of that eternal life amen
[1:18:25] and that's the only one form of eternal
[1:18:28] life that's god's life zoe the greek
[1:18:30] word zoe only one form of eternal life
[1:18:34] then if you are a son of god or a
[1:18:37] daughter of god you are in god all the
[1:18:40] time
[1:18:42] praise the lord in him all the time
[1:18:45] that's how he could be manifested
[1:18:48] through us
[1:18:49] now where do we get to okay
[1:18:52] now we've got to the place that we're at
[1:18:54] this we're at this end of time
[1:18:57] end of time for me end of time for time
[1:19:00] end of time for uh the rapture whatever
[1:19:03] that might be fulfilled in our lives
[1:19:05] because the end of time for me might be
[1:19:07] different than you
[1:19:08] might be all together it might be we're
[1:19:10] all going to rapture together that end
[1:19:12] might come at that time for us now it's
[1:19:14] not the end of time time it's just the
[1:19:16] end of time for you
[1:19:17] amen because time continues on even
[1:19:20] after armageddon
[1:19:21] even after the millennium is a period of
[1:19:23] time brother graham teaches it's a
[1:19:25] thousand years right it's a period of
[1:19:26] time
[1:19:27] so that time element continues to unfold
[1:19:30] so that time will continue that's what
[1:19:33] disturbs me sometimes when people get
[1:19:35] certain revelations especially like
[1:19:36] revelation 10 and the end of time and
[1:19:39] you got to know what you're talking
[1:19:40] about right see because if you if you
[1:19:42] try to make that the coming of the lord
[1:19:44] and the rapture
[1:19:45] that's not the ending of time right
[1:19:48] time continues on after the wedding
[1:19:50] supper after the uh armageddon after the
[1:19:53] millennium time continues on even to
[1:19:55] that point where it does eventually
[1:19:58] blend back into eternity again
[1:20:01] amen will we go into that new city the
[1:20:04] new city jerusalem the new jerusalem
[1:20:07] amen
[1:20:09] it all blends in together
[1:20:11] amen us and him perfect together again
[1:20:15] amen christ in mystery god revealed
[1:20:18] he said look
[1:20:20] god in his body
[1:20:22] christ in his body
[1:20:25] amen
[1:20:27] let's read that real quick colossians
[1:20:29] chapter
[1:20:30] 2. colossians chapter 2 verse 8.
[1:20:34] i've been meaning to read this and every
[1:20:36] time i get long and i'm not able to
[1:20:38] finish it colossians chapter 2 verse 8.
[1:20:49] praise the lord
[1:20:53] now colossians 1 19 says for it please
[1:20:56] the father
[1:20:57] that in him christ should all fullness
[1:21:01] dwell all a double l that's all
[1:21:04] inclusive that's everything nothing
[1:21:05] missing nothing left out complete
[1:21:08] amen all complete
[1:21:10] i've said many times
[1:21:12] whoever named that detergent all had a
[1:21:15] real revelation
[1:21:17] i mean that man should hopefully be a
[1:21:18] billionaire by now because that was
[1:21:20] smart to call his detergent all right
[1:21:23] which insinuates that everything that
[1:21:26] that larger detergent touches on your
[1:21:28] clothes is going to come clean
[1:21:31] right all
[1:21:32] right
[1:21:33] nothing left out all yeah so all it
[1:21:36] police the father in him all fullness
[1:21:39] dwell
[1:21:40] nothing left out all fullness
[1:21:42] now
[1:21:43] 2 8 beware
[1:21:46] lest any man spoil you through
[1:21:48] philosophy and vain deceit
[1:21:51] after tradition of men after the
[1:21:53] rudiments of the world and not after
[1:21:55] christ
[1:21:57] now they they disguise it with in this
[1:22:01] in the disguise of christ they make it
[1:22:03] look like him reminds me of the story
[1:22:05] brother branham talked about when the
[1:22:08] back when he was alive when people come
[1:22:09] forth and they had these scars and they
[1:22:11] had blood coming out and all this and
[1:22:12] oil and stuff and they're like
[1:22:15] and
[1:22:16] come follow me i'm christ and come
[1:22:18] follow this and that and they have all
[1:22:20] these signs and stuff and people flock
[1:22:22] to it when he says that's not even
[1:22:25] scriptural
[1:22:27] right that's against the bible
[1:22:29] how can you be against the word and be
[1:22:32] and be the literal christ
[1:22:34] it doesn't work and but see that's
[1:22:36] that's how people do through philosophy
[1:22:39] or vein deceit now today it's just money
[1:22:41] that's that's what the whole world's
[1:22:43] motivated by money the love of money has
[1:22:45] absolutely eaten up this world yes this
[1:22:49] country
[1:22:50] and you hardly see anything done that
[1:22:52] people do today outside of god's people
[1:22:54] that's not done because of the love of
[1:22:56] money not for money
[1:22:58] there's nothing wrong with money it's
[1:22:59] the love of money that's the problem you
[1:23:02] fill this room with 100 bills
[1:23:04] it's not going to hurt a soul it's not
[1:23:06] going to bother one single person it
[1:23:08] could be 10 billion dollars in this room
[1:23:10] and not hurt a single person not cause a
[1:23:13] single problem not hurt anybody in any
[1:23:16] way but just let one person find out
[1:23:18] about it right just let one serpent see
[1:23:20] one human one person tell the next
[1:23:22] person all of a sudden it's on the news
[1:23:24] it's on the internet it's on social
[1:23:26] media it's everywhere you can find it
[1:23:28] people are killing each other to get
[1:23:30] their little portion of whatever money
[1:23:31] is in this room right
[1:23:33] that love is what destroys it yes yes
[1:23:36] but it's motivated obviously
[1:23:39] the end result is that love of money
[1:23:42] amen but it's out after the ruins of the
[1:23:45] world not after christ for in him in
[1:23:47] christ dwelleth all the fullness of the
[1:23:51] godhead bodily oh we just read that amen
[1:23:54] accentuated the all
[1:23:57] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[1:24:00] ye
[1:24:01] you
[1:24:03] are complete in him
[1:24:05] which is the head
[1:24:07] of all principality and power you are
[1:24:10] complete well that's just the same thing
[1:24:12] he's saying over here about christ
[1:24:15] amen now obviously christ was in a
[1:24:17] different a position of sonship and
[1:24:20] and was and was perfect and sinless and
[1:24:23] we were born in sin shaped and equally
[1:24:24] come the world speaking lines but as far
[1:24:27] as
[1:24:28] the word goes god poured all he had all
[1:24:33] that fullness into one body jesus christ
[1:24:37] but when christ was crucified and his
[1:24:39] blood was shed and that spirit was
[1:24:42] released
[1:24:43] that spirit then came back and lit upon
[1:24:48] 120 people and now thousands
[1:24:51] sins
[1:24:52] thousands tens of thousands through the
[1:24:55] ages hundreds of thousands millions
[1:24:58] have tasted of that eternal gift
[1:25:01] that that that that is god's life
[1:25:04] god's spirit
[1:25:05] and that spirit that came is now
[1:25:08] complete
[1:25:09] in us
[1:25:11] once it was contained into one man jesus
[1:25:14] christ all the fullness of the godhead
[1:25:15] bodily but now brother graham said it's
[1:25:17] look god in his body christ
[1:25:20] and christ in his body the bride
[1:25:25] that bride she's gonna take on his image
[1:25:28] she's gonna take on his life just
[1:25:30] because she's become who he is you know
[1:25:33] the more time you spend together the
[1:25:34] more you begin to look like each other
[1:25:38] amen
[1:25:39] now sisters and especially my wife uh
[1:25:42] you're gonna hate to hear this but
[1:25:43] you're starting to look like us men more
[1:25:45] and more all the time
[1:25:47] it's a horrible thing to say i know
[1:25:49] because we're such ugly bugs sitting
[1:25:51] here but the truth of it is the more
[1:25:53] time you spend together the more you
[1:25:55] begin to start to look like each other
[1:25:58] that's just a fact
[1:25:59] the more time you spend with jesus
[1:26:01] christ the more in his image you're
[1:26:03] going to become yes the more his
[1:26:05] likeness you're going to become to where
[1:26:08] you hopefully we get to the place in
[1:26:10] this life the world we get so much like
[1:26:13] him that the world can't tell us apart
[1:26:16] now of course they're in such darkness
[1:26:20] they don't know one from the other you
[1:26:22] know you you you can
[1:26:25] the world is so dark you can flick a
[1:26:27] match and they'll think a spotlight is
[1:26:29] shining
[1:26:31] because it's so dark right
[1:26:34] but i want it to be that spotlight that
[1:26:36] that light of life that is shining forth
[1:26:39] through us
[1:26:40] through me
[1:26:41] that we let that work and the way to do
[1:26:43] that is to die die to ourselves yes paul
[1:26:46] said i die daily we should die daily
[1:26:48] every day amen he made the statement of
[1:26:51] course i died that he might live but
[1:26:53] then he said but i died daily it's not
[1:26:56] just the one time it's not just the new
[1:26:58] birth but it's a continual dying out to
[1:27:01] the lord jesus
[1:27:03] and to our own flesh so that he can have
[1:27:06] more preeminence in us
[1:27:07] through us that his life would do but
[1:27:10] we're complete now we're complete in him
[1:27:14] praise the lord
[1:27:15] christ in his body the bride all mine
[1:27:19] god made manifest in christ
[1:27:21] christ made manifest in the bride
[1:27:25] you believe your bride
[1:27:26] you say you're bright i believe i am i
[1:27:29] am amen i am i just say i'm not going to
[1:27:32] say i believe i am right i am a part of
[1:27:34] god's pride i am a part of that mystical
[1:27:37] body
[1:27:38] i am a part of that body that has
[1:27:39] brothers and sisters around the world
[1:27:41] i'm a part of that body i'm a part of
[1:27:43] that body that's gone on from the first
[1:27:44] church age when that 120 had received
[1:27:46] that spirit in the upper room a part of
[1:27:48] that body this went from that from the
[1:27:50] first church age and the first messenger
[1:27:52] paul all the way down to this day in
[1:27:54] this time that we live i'm a part of
[1:27:55] that yes amen i'm a part of that because
[1:27:58] it's part of me yeah christ manifested
[1:28:01] in his bride what does that manifest
[1:28:03] that's to take the cover off
[1:28:05] that's to make known to reveal
[1:28:09] reveal what bride
[1:28:11] well what is she she is him amen amen
[1:28:15] praise the lord she is him
[1:28:18] i heard a sad commentary the other day i
[1:28:20] won't say who said it
[1:28:21] but it was in the message
[1:28:23] and somebody said that's that that's
[1:28:25] like this world transgender stuff i said
[1:28:28] oh my
[1:28:29] what are we talking about with people
[1:28:33] the ungodly filth of the world like that
[1:28:35] has nothing to do
[1:28:37] with christ and his word
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:41] but the bride
[1:28:43] is him
[1:28:44] she's becoming more like him all the
[1:28:46] time
[1:28:47] who is he he is the word yes amen he is
[1:28:50] the word manifested the cry christ made
[1:28:53] manifested in the bride
[1:28:56] and god took from the body of adam the
[1:28:59] woman
[1:29:00] she failed
[1:29:01] then god took from the body of christ
[1:29:04] his flesh his body which is his word
[1:29:07] that logos
[1:29:09] and it's bringing a bride out
[1:29:12] and you say you're part of that bride
[1:29:14] you say you're part of that bride i'm
[1:29:16] hoping you're at home saying you're part
[1:29:17] of that writer wherever you're streaming
[1:29:19] this
[1:29:21] his body which is his word and bringing
[1:29:24] a bride out
[1:29:26] that won't fall
[1:29:29] praise the lord
[1:29:31] won't fall by denomination or creed
[1:29:35] praise the lord
[1:29:37] this bride will not fail yes
[1:29:40] this bride cannot fail
[1:29:42] it is impossible for
[1:29:45] this bride
[1:29:47] now i'll say from the first church age
[1:29:48] until now we're a part of this last day
[1:29:50] brian
[1:29:51] cannot fail
[1:29:54] she cannot fall any more than
[1:29:57] he can fall
[1:29:59] because she's become him
[1:30:01] she's become the word that logos
[1:30:04] that intellectual property
[1:30:06] that god come and and place before the
[1:30:08] foundation world now but placed in the
[1:30:11] literal sense of each one of us in you
[1:30:14] before you were even born
[1:30:16] that seed come forth
[1:30:18] it brought life that seed of first john
[1:30:21] 3 came forth brought life and remains
[1:30:25] amen remains in you but now because of
[1:30:28] the birth it's not dormant
[1:30:30] it's brought life
[1:30:32] a seed can set dormant but when life
[1:30:34] hits that seed the seed is going to
[1:30:35] bring forth what what it is of what it's
[1:30:38] made of
[1:30:39] it's going to produce the light that's
[1:30:41] in it
[1:30:42] and when that light struck your path and
[1:30:44] that holy spirit came into you that seed
[1:30:47] brought forth life
[1:30:49] amen amen
[1:30:50] that life is the light of men
[1:30:53] that logos
[1:30:55] that intellectual property that part
[1:30:57] that was that who god is is now who you
[1:31:00] are we believe that it's who we are
[1:31:04] but lord help us
[1:31:06] help us that
[1:31:08] we died this thing
[1:31:10] this this this time element thing that
[1:31:13] we're trapped in
[1:31:15] amen no wonder brother abraham said i'm
[1:31:16] glad there's that open door called death
[1:31:19] amen but
[1:31:20] again though i'm not in a hurry to open
[1:31:22] that door but
[1:31:24] that this time body that we're trapped
[1:31:27] in
[1:31:29] god is give us another year saints yes
[1:31:32] what are we going to do with it right
[1:31:34] amen

[1:31:41] but this gods give us a new year you're
[1:31:44] alive

[1:31:48] standing here
[1:31:50] we got a new year what are we going to
[1:31:52] do with
[1:31:54] what is our plan
[1:31:55] buy a new
[1:31:56] car buy a new house
[1:31:59] which
[1:32:00] i probably shouldn't say because we are
[1:32:02] going to try to buy a house uh i'm not
[1:32:04] going to pay a
[1:32:05] king's ransom for one but uh
[1:32:08] we'd like me and my wife would like to
[1:32:10] buy a house this year buy a car buy a
[1:32:12] house
[1:32:13] have a bigger bank account
[1:32:18] live to see next year
[1:32:19] get healthier
[1:32:21] it's stronger
[1:32:24] i mean what do we plant what do we
[1:32:26] intend to do with this year people go
[1:32:28] through and
[1:32:29] into a new year and they have minds and
[1:32:32] hearts full of stuff right a lot of
[1:32:34] people will go and they'll tell you what
[1:32:36] their resolutions are
[1:32:38] as well usually a resolution is just
[1:32:41] a proclamation of failure usually
[1:32:46] i i've seen
[1:32:48] i've seen people when i was especially
[1:32:49] in business back east and people come in
[1:32:51] my office say i'm gonna i'm gonna lose a
[1:32:53] hundred pounds they come in my office
[1:32:55] beginning of the next year they're 50
[1:32:56] pounds heavier
[1:32:58] i'm gonna uh i i'm gonna get uh a
[1:33:02] stronger i'm gonna get healthier or you
[1:33:05] know
[1:33:06] work out go to the gym that kind of
[1:33:07] thing
[1:33:09] you come back and you spend a thousand
[1:33:10] dollars on something that's rusting and
[1:33:13] rotting
[1:33:15] amen i'm gonna i'm gonna buy the
[1:33:17] latest state of art

[1:33:26] beginning of the next year it's on
[1:33:28] mccary or craigslist
[1:33:31] because it sat in the corner
[1:33:33] i had to clean it and dust it off just
[1:33:35] to get it on the
[1:33:36] resolutions forget them all right
[1:33:39] there's one thing i want to do that's
[1:33:40] put god first yes
[1:33:43] because if i put god first
[1:33:45] then he'll add all these other things to
[1:33:47] me right
[1:33:48] he'll add all these other things to our
[1:33:50] lives whatever it might be
[1:33:52] maybe it will be a new car maybe it will
[1:33:54] be a new house might not be a mansion
[1:33:57] might not be a mercedes but it'd be a
[1:33:59] car that you can drive a nice vehicle
[1:34:01] you can get around in or a nice house
[1:34:02] you can live in whatever it might be
[1:34:05] maybe you will have a little bit more
[1:34:06] money maybe you will be able to be
[1:34:09] able to provide more i just think i
[1:34:11] thank god me and brother roger talk
[1:34:13] about this all the time
[1:34:15] almost weekly
[1:34:19] he's 68 i'm 56 i've never done
[1:34:22] labor work like that i mostly enjoy it
[1:34:25] except when it's 100 degrees
[1:34:27] i like to go up in show law and work
[1:34:29] when it's june july and august but uh
[1:34:33] so it's not always easy
[1:34:35] but
[1:34:36] if you can just do something for god
[1:34:38] amen
[1:34:40] i i thank the lord
[1:34:44] and i'm just going to get personal
[1:34:47] as i close here
[1:34:50] but i thank god
[1:34:54] that
[1:34:55] he put it on brother roger's heart to
[1:34:56] ask me to help him
[1:34:58] because being able to make the finances
[1:35:00] with him is being able to help us
[1:35:02] provide for this place
[1:35:05] it's been able to help provide for me
[1:35:06] and my family
[1:35:10] i
[1:35:11] now this may sound crazy
[1:35:14] but i've seen
[1:35:16] one good thing
[1:35:17] to me
[1:35:19] one good thing come out of kobe
[1:35:22] it kicked us out of that place that i
[1:35:24] had gotten my little nest down in and
[1:35:27] was comfortable at
[1:35:29] it's cheap it's a nice place
[1:35:32] i was frustrated almost every sunday
[1:35:34] because
[1:35:35] people hanging out and talking in the
[1:35:37] sanctuary and going on and couldn't set
[1:35:39] up and do all these things it was
[1:35:41] frustrating a lot of times but it was
[1:35:43] easy it was comfortable
[1:35:46] amen and when that eagle god stirs that
[1:35:49] nest
[1:35:51] you know you sit down and he said
[1:35:54] time to get out
[1:35:56] time to go
[1:35:58] you know god creates circumstances to
[1:36:00] move us in directions that we need to go
[1:36:02] for him yes amen he'll create sometimes
[1:36:05] very uncomfortable circumstances to
[1:36:08] bring us to where we should be in him
[1:36:10] god help me i don't like those
[1:36:12] uncomfortable circumstances i don't want
[1:36:14] any more of them but you know how i can
[1:36:16] avoid them just obey him
[1:36:19] when he comes when he says when he talks
[1:36:21] to you just obey him right amen
[1:36:24] but at least it got us out of there and
[1:36:26] in here and i thank god
[1:36:28] gives me a brother to work with
[1:36:30] a fellowship with which i'm joy very
[1:36:33] much
[1:36:36] god is good
[1:36:38] amen and i appreciate it we don't have
[1:36:40] any great bank account we don't have any
[1:36:42] money we live
[1:36:44] we live day to day by the grace of god
[1:36:47] right uh we don't i mean god provides
[1:36:49] you have a nice card place to live we
[1:36:51] thank god for that but we don't have any
[1:36:52] uh
[1:36:54] you know but god takes care of us and
[1:36:56] that's that's the whole thing
[1:36:58] amen
[1:37:00] my son and my daughter are grown and
[1:37:02] they become self-sufficient and they
[1:37:04] serve the lord and they trust the lord
[1:37:07] and and and all and and i i'm assuming
[1:37:10] if time would continue to tarry they are
[1:37:12] of the assumption that uh
[1:37:14] mine their mother will not leave them a
[1:37:16] dime
[1:37:18] because there's probably not going to be
[1:37:19] a time to leave
[1:37:21] i don't know but it doesn't matter but
[1:37:24] god will provide right
[1:37:26] and that's what that that's what i look
[1:37:28] to that's what i trust the lord
[1:37:30] amen
[1:37:31] you know i'll say this as i close cause
[1:37:33] i just forgive me i'm just being
[1:37:35] personal reflecting a little bit i can
[1:37:37] talk to you because you're a captive
[1:37:38] audience and uh anyway but brother
[1:37:42] branham uh brother greene
[1:37:44] i think he may have said this behind the
[1:37:45] pulpit but i know he told me this
[1:37:47] personally
[1:37:48] brother branham had this
[1:37:51] standing
[1:37:52] understanding
[1:37:54] that if this certain bank account that
[1:37:56] they had got to a certain amount brother
[1:37:58] brown emptied it out
[1:38:01] he said don't this this account is not
[1:38:03] to get over a certain amount of money on
[1:38:05] ten thousand dollars or something not a
[1:38:07] great deal of money of course it may
[1:38:08] have been in the 60s but if it got to
[1:38:10] this brother green told me if that if
[1:38:12] this account got to this certain amount
[1:38:14] of money
[1:38:15] empty it out put it in the mission field
[1:38:18] do something for the lord with it don't
[1:38:20] let it sit there
[1:38:21] don't let it
[1:38:22] we're not worried about building
[1:38:24] kingdoms and accruing all this do
[1:38:26] something with it
[1:38:27] for the lord and that was his attitude
[1:38:29] that was his feeling about it get rid of
[1:38:31] it empty it out
[1:38:32] so he was telling me i think that
[1:38:34] because brother green had privy
[1:38:36] information to that account it was like
[1:38:38] two million dollars before brother green
[1:38:39] died but he's like brother green brother
[1:38:42] brown would have never agreed to that
[1:38:43] right because he said when he gets to
[1:38:45] this amount he said empty it put it in
[1:38:47] the mission field do something with it
[1:38:48] for the lord
[1:38:50] and i just think that's just like a good
[1:38:52] attitude right because god's going to
[1:38:54] take care of us isn't he yes he always
[1:38:56] has
[1:38:58] even in the darkest time even in some of
[1:39:00] the hardest times even in some of the
[1:39:02] roughest times even the times where it
[1:39:04] didn't seem like he had two nickels to
[1:39:06] rub
[1:39:07] god still took care of us
[1:39:09] we didn't go hungry amen had a place to
[1:39:11] live
[1:39:12] god provided amen and i believe he's
[1:39:15] going to do the same thing this year so
[1:39:17] what are we going to do with this year
[1:39:19] amen it's up to you as an individual but
[1:39:22] i'm going to do my best to grow closer
[1:39:24] to him amen
[1:39:26] let's stand if we could
[1:39:37] praise the lord
[1:39:44] saints he is our portion
[1:39:46] yes he is
[1:39:53] forgive amen i'm just trying to see
[1:39:54] maybe what the lord would want
[1:39:59] amen let's sing this course
[1:40:04] he put this on my heart yesterday so
[1:40:06] there's a reason for it number 316 in
[1:40:09] the song book uh we do have it on the
[1:40:12] oh we probably all know it by heart i've
[1:40:14] sang this song so many times here

[1:40:18] existence
[1:40:26] i want to sing it all of our hearts

[1:44:21] from our very first time being in church
[1:44:24] a little boy
[1:44:28] i think you know

[1:44:32] sometimes we need to be doing
[1:44:35] amen that's right
[1:44:36] god make me more like you god says i'm
[1:44:39] trying to
[1:44:40] but you won't let me

[1:44:48] let me
