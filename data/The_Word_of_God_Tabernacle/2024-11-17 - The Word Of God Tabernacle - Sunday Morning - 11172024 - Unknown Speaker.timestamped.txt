[39:39] that the Lord came and directed things

[40:28] think where would I have been what God
[40:32] has did the turn here and the change
[40:35] here and the foring the road there and
[40:37] the crossroad and which way do I go what
[40:40] do I do and God always makes it work
[40:43] amen regardless of uh of any of our
[40:46] failures and mistakes and any of it he
[40:48] makes a way for us all toess this batt I
[40:51] can't even imagine I think back when I
[40:53] was just Joel's age we first came in
[40:55] this message and truth and I knew in my
[40:57] heart it was always something it always
[41:00] right I knew it was right I knew Jesus
[41:02] Christ I worshiping and serving God was
[41:05] right I always knew that and it wasn't
[41:08] because of the house I grew up in either
[41:10] uh that helped me I'm thankful for that
[41:13] am but I know I know now that that was
[41:16] already in me amen before the foundation
[41:19] of the world God placed that seat in me
[41:22] I knew it already we knew it and I you
[41:24] know and I say that because I know that
[41:27] identifies and witnesses to you all as
[41:29] well prise amen and U some it may have
[41:33] took a little longer but I knew my whole
[41:35] life and I just I knew I didn't serve it
[41:38] didn't want to serve it my flesh riled
[41:41] against it many times but in me I knew
[41:44] it was right always knew it was right
[41:47] amen never expected to preach uh could
[41:49] have seen a look on my wife's face when
[41:51] that happened uh she's like I never I
[41:55] never I never bargained to marry a
[41:58] preacher I wasn't bargaining to preach
[42:01] so we're kind of in the same boat here
[42:03] but we do what we can for the glory of
[42:05] the Lord and what he puts in our lives
[42:07] and what he has us to do that's what we
[42:09] can do amen yes praise the Lord I'm
[42:12] thankful God is good
[42:27] like like a
[42:29] bad but I just have a little and I'm
[42:33] fine amen praise the Lord thank you
[42:37] Jesus well Joel if you weren't if you
[42:39] didn't have some bumps and bruises I
[42:40] wouldn't think you were a boy I mean
[42:44] that does that come in the
[42:46] territory bumps and bruises come in the
[42:48] territory when you're a little boy amen
[42:51] sometimes when you're little girls too
[42:53] buten mostly when you rambun as little
[42:56] boy they just come they come of the
[42:58] territory amen so let's stand to our

[43:34] things will come to pass amen amen some
[43:37] things may come to pass after we're gone

[46:21] amen amen amen now First Kings chapter
[46:25] 21 we'll begin with verse 17 and the
[46:28] word of the Lord came to Elijah the
[46:30] tishbite saying arise go down to me Ahab
[46:33] king of Israel which is in Samaria
[46:36] behold he uh behold he is in the
[46:38] vineyard of nabal Wither he is gone down
[46:41] to possess it Thou shalt speak unto him
[46:45] saying thus sayeth the Lord hast thou
[46:48] killed and also taken possession and
[46:52] thou shalt speak unto him saying thus
[46:54] sayeth the Lord in the place where dogs
[46:58] lick the blood of nabal shall dogs lick
[47:01] thy blood even thine and Ahab said to
[47:04] Elijah hast thou Found Me Oh My Enemy
[47:08] and he answered I have found thee
[47:10] because thou has sold thyself to work
[47:13] evil in the sight of the Lord behold I
[47:16] will bring evil upon thee and will take
[47:19] away thy posterity and will cut off from
[47:22] Ahab him that pisseth against the wall
[47:24] and him that shut uh shut up and uh and
[47:28] left in
[47:30] Israel and will make thine house like
[47:32] the house of jeroboam the son of nabat
[47:35] and like the house of Bop the house of
[47:38] ahaja for for the provocation wherewith
[47:41] thou has provoked me to anger and made
[47:44] Israel to sin and of Jezebel also spake
[47:48] the Lord saying the dogs shall eat
[47:51] Jezebel by the wall of jezrael and you
[47:54] could be seated if you'd like
[47:57] want to start back with this story we
[47:59] all probably know it heard it read it
[48:03] um heard it ministered on a little bit
[48:06] but I want particularly to recognize uh
[48:10] sort of a an extension of what we talked
[48:13] about the other day couple of services
[48:15] and even brother no hit on it a little
[48:17] bit to recognize that uh first of all we
[48:21] know everybody plays their part yes amen
[48:23] everybody in the world plays their part
[48:25] whether it's uh a a part that is less
[48:28] pleasurable whether it's a part that
[48:31] puts ones to death whether it's a part
[48:34] that uh uh uh puts uh uh puts you under
[48:39] persecution whatever we all have our
[48:41] part to play whether it's a part uh that
[48:44] is detrimental to the gospel if it's a
[48:48] part that is a church or a Ministry that
[48:50] is harmful to the message everyone has
[48:54] their part to play yes everybody amen
[48:57] brother bam said Hitler had a part to
[48:59] play he said Stalin had a part to play
[49:02] amen and God did not stop those men
[49:05] until they were done with what God
[49:06] needed to be done yes amen and we know
[49:09] the fulfilling the Fulfillment of the
[49:11] scripture that was brought about in that
[49:15] uh uh uh in what the Lord did there amen
[49:19] we know what scripture had to be brought
[49:21] about and Israel had to be driv back to
[49:23] their Homeland and all that God did to
[49:25] bring it about for the script scripture
[49:27] to be fulfilled amen and the scripture
[49:29] will be fulfilled every letter of it
[49:32] every word of it it will be F if it has
[49:35] not it will be fulfilled there's not one
[49:38] word in here that will go unfulfilled it
[49:42] will happen amen and this that God is
[49:45] sending Elijah down to prophesy and as
[49:49] we read this part of the of the
[49:51] instruction that God gave to uh to
[49:53] Elijah in two specific separate places
[49:57] he God says Elijah you tell him Ahab
[50:02] thus saith the Lord amen amen now that's
[50:06] not a man it better not be uh that's not
[50:09] a human that's not a man if it is that
[50:13] man needs to make his heart right
[50:15] because he's a liar he's Satan possessed
[50:18] and needs to come to the altar but when
[50:20] you say thus sayith the Lord thus sayith
[50:22] the Lord you speak in the name of the
[50:24] Lord that is coming from the Throne of
[50:27] God that is God using you as his
[50:30] instrument to speak and he told him
[50:33] twice in this specific instance you tell
[50:35] him thus sayith the Lord this is going
[50:38] to happen thus sayith the Lord this is
[50:40] going to happen that's why you saw
[50:42] brother brandom the word prophet of
[50:44] today a true Prophet a true prophet's
[50:48] word a word prophet's true word come to
[50:53] pass amen trust me California will sink
[50:58] yes amen I know the curse was on LA
[51:02] California will sink brother brandom
[51:03] talks about the West Coast even
[51:06] California will sink we know the things
[51:08] that have come to pass in the prophecy
[51:10] and the things that's been spoken God
[51:13] never promised brother brandom
[51:14] specifically that these things would
[51:16] happen while he was here thankfully of
[51:19] the encouragement that God gave to
[51:21] brother brandom several of the things
[51:23] that the lord gave him did happen
[51:26] several of even the Sevenfold Vision
[51:28] that God gave brother B actually came to
[51:30] pass amen we know that and we know that
[51:34] California is going to sink we know the
[51:36] things that that God has done and Prov
[51:39] and shown those things will happen this
[51:43] will
[51:44] happen God told Elijah go tell Ahab this
[51:48] is going to happen what was it thus
[51:50] sayith the Lord the dogs are going to
[51:53] lick your blood where you killed and
[51:56] allowed nabos blood to be to be spilled
[51:59] amen the dogs will lick your blood in
[52:02] that exact same place amen and thus
[52:06] sayth the Lord for your Jezebel wife she
[52:10] will be eaten by the
[52:12] dogs by the wall of jezrael thus sayeth
[52:16] the Lord now that's going to happen amen
[52:21] speaking inside the story we know it's
[52:23] already happened but speaking inside the
[52:26] story at that specific time we know as
[52:29] Elijah spoke that to Ahab it was going
[52:31] to happen period now Ahab didn't think
[52:34] anything about it apparently he just
[52:37] called see you notice how he addressed
[52:39] Elijah he said uh hast thou Found Me Oh
[52:44] My Enemy well if you weren't an enemy of
[52:46] God you wouldn't be an enemy of God's
[52:48] people
[52:50] right if you weren't an enemy of God you
[52:53] would not be an enemy of God's prophet
[52:56] right if you're a if you are a friend of
[52:59] God's Prophet then you would be a friend
[53:01] of God you notice the difference he but
[53:04] see he couldn't differentiate the two
[53:08] he's he's thinking I'm in good standing
[53:11] with God but he hates God's man
[53:14] Elijah who spoke only what God Said
[53:17] speak amen amen praise the Lord there's
[53:21] another one we know we'll talk about
[53:22] again in a minute but look at the story
[53:25] as we go through it you see uh um I I I
[53:30] I I can read through it I can preface it
[53:33] but or I could paraphrase it but the
[53:37] Story begins back at the first verse
[53:40] 21st chapter of course the story starts
[53:42] for this specific thing and it came to
[53:46] pass verse uh 21 and one now and it came
[53:50] to pass after these things that naboth
[53:53] the jezreelite had a Vineyard which was
[53:56] in jezrael hard by the place of Ahab
[53:58] king of
[53:59] Syria and uh or Samaria excuse me and
[54:03] Ahab spake unto nabal saying give me thy
[54:07] Vineyard that I may have it for a garden
[54:09] of herbs because it is near un my house
[54:12] and I will give for uh give thee for it
[54:15] a better Vineyard than it or if it seem
[54:18] Good To Thee I will give Thee the worth
[54:20] of it in money well that sounds fair
[54:24] amen but it wasn't it it wasn't ahab's
[54:28] to buy it was nabos to sell it's not up
[54:32] to Ahab it's up to nabal and nabal said
[54:37] to Ahab the Lord forbid it me the Lord
[54:40] forbid it me that I should give the
[54:43] inheritance my posterity she or my
[54:46] inheritance of my fathers to be even
[54:49] unto a posterity the inheritance of my
[54:52] fathers unto
[54:54] thee and Ahab anybody that was a Godly
[54:57] person at that time knew Ahab was
[54:59] crooked yes and knew that he had caused
[55:02] all Israel to fall into sin but there
[55:04] were godly people as there always are
[55:07] amen just in this leodan church age that
[55:11] has fallen into the disarray and of
[55:13] course the scripture the ne the the
[55:15] lukewarmness that has fallen into even
[55:18] though that last Circle that brother
[55:21] random drew that God said was that that
[55:24] it was completely black out there was
[55:27] still a little sliver of light in there
[55:29] because there's still going to be some
[55:31] of God's people in there amen so even
[55:35] though all of Israel had blackened out
[55:37] there were still some people that were
[55:39] in there that were godly people people
[55:42] of Integrity people that had a a a a
[55:46] grasp on understanding their Heritage
[55:48] and where they came from and and and
[55:51] what their inheritance was it meant
[55:53] something to them it wasn't just a train
[55:57] it wasn't just something that you go uh
[55:59] like brother Tom does to the to the gym
[56:02] show or something and buy and trade and
[56:04] like Mah does buy and trade gems and and
[56:06] this and and horse trade and bargain and
[56:09] sell a little this for this to try to
[56:10] get this maybe make a little money off
[56:12] this there was no bargaining here this
[56:15] was his inheritance this belonged to his
[56:18] family this belonged to his father and
[56:21] God forbade if you will forbade uh nabbo
[56:27] from selling that thing to s that
[56:29] Vineyard his inheritance to such a
[56:31] wicked man as Ahab amen so so Ahab so NE
[56:36] said God has forbidden me to sell you my
[56:41] Vineyard and the fourth verse and Ahab
[56:43] came out of his house heavy and
[56:45] displeased because of the word which
[56:48] nabot the jezreelite had spoken to him
[56:51] for he had said I will give I will not
[56:53] give Thee the inheritance of my fathers
[56:55] and he laid him down upon his bed turned
[56:59] his away his face and would not eat no
[57:02] bread now that's pretty much what I did
[57:05] when I was six right and didn't get my
[57:08] way right when I was a little child and
[57:11] didn't get my way I would throw a temper
[57:15] tantrum amen I didn't specifically but I
[57:19] know as a child we would get all upset
[57:22] didn't get my way so I'm going to pout
[57:24] I'm going to go lay on my bed in a ball
[57:27] and stare at the wall like a
[57:29] child I'm not going to even eat dinner I
[57:32] refuse my dinner no bread no water I'm
[57:35] just going to ball up in a ball here and
[57:37] I'm just going to be a little baby and
[57:39] I'm going to Suk as the king of Israel
[57:42] I'm an assault over the fact that nabbo
[57:44] won't sell me his Vineyard what a baby
[57:47] what a child right what a horrible
[57:50] example of a leader in the situation the
[57:53] person the man that was over all of
[57:55] Israel
[57:57] uh was so infantile to to walk away and
[58:01] not get his way so much that he I'm not
[58:05] eating and suck over the fact that nebot
[58:09] wouldn't sell him his Vineyard
[58:12] I it's a pretty pitiful it kind of
[58:15] explains the rest of what's going on too
[58:18] cuz you know what you got
[58:20] here in Ahab you got to spoil brat
[58:24] that's what you got it needss a good
[58:26] whooping yes I mean might get trouble
[58:29] that's the truth though he just needs a
[58:31] good whooping amen uh probably maybe a
[58:36] little too late now and then he married
[58:39] then he doubled it up and he married a
[58:41] spoiled brat who always got her way who
[58:46] needed probably more than a whoop um and
[58:49] the two of them made a marriage and the
[58:52] two of of them now over the Kingdom of
[58:54] Israel right a horrible sight but he
[58:58] amen deserving of a whooping decided to
[59:01] go and lay in the bed turn his face
[59:04] against the wall and refuse to eat
[59:07] anything so Jezebel comes to him fifth
[59:10] chapter fifth verse but Jezebel his wife
[59:13] came to him and we know the kind of
[59:15] woman Jezebel was amen we know the kind
[59:18] of person that she was she did the
[59:20] things she did because of her character
[59:24] notice that a lot of people talk about
[59:25] making and all this stuff and calling
[59:28] Jezebel makeup and I know what brother
[59:29] brandham said but I want you to get to
[59:31] the root to understand what brother
[59:32] brandham said Absolut amen a jezebel is
[59:36] a dominating female Spirit that's what a
[59:39] jezebel is Right amen she did what she
[59:42] did because of her because of her
[59:44] character amen she lived the way she
[59:47] lived and produced herself because she
[59:50] was uh she was that type of woman amen
[59:53] that's why she did it she's a jezebel
[59:56] and you say a jezebel it doesn't mean
[59:58] that she wears jeans or cuts her hair or
[1:00:00] whatever I mean those can be attributes
[1:00:03] of it uh but paint her face all up that
[1:00:06] can be attributes of it but uh but a
[1:00:09] jezebel is a dominating female Spirit
[1:00:12] that's what a jezebel is amen so this so
[1:00:16] it it characterizes her in this story
[1:00:19] better his wife came to him Jezebel said
[1:00:22] unto him why is thy spirit so sad and
[1:00:25] thou eatest no bread and he said unto
[1:00:28] her because I uh spake unto nabo the
[1:00:32] jezreelite and said unto him give me my
[1:00:35] give me thy Vineyard for money or else
[1:00:38] if it please Thee I will give thee
[1:00:40] another Vineyard for it and he answered
[1:00:42] I will not give thee my Vineyard now can
[1:00:44] you imagine the suling and the Weeping
[1:00:47] and the clearing of the throat and the
[1:00:50] whole he wouldn't give me my V wanted
[1:00:54] the vineyard he wouldn't give me you can
[1:00:56] only imagine what the story is like amen
[1:00:59] but Jezebel now seventh verse Jezebel's
[1:01:03] wife said to him does thou now govern
[1:01:06] the Kingdom of Israel in other words
[1:01:08] you're the king of Israel you can take
[1:01:09] whatever you want right amen by proper
[1:01:12] means by legal means by ethical means or
[1:01:17] Not by ethical means or moral means but
[1:01:21] the bottom line is you're the king you
[1:01:23] can do whatever you want
[1:01:26] there you go that that's that's exactly
[1:01:29] the mentality of a spoiled brat you can
[1:01:33] do whatever you want no you
[1:01:36] can't you re you really can't uh I know
[1:01:39] that flies in the face of a lot of
[1:01:41] modern day thinking but you really can't
[1:01:43] not not with God Amen not get away with
[1:01:47] it amen people say
[1:01:50] well well if you can do whatever you
[1:01:52] want then you just go in the jewelry
[1:01:53] store here at the mall just take
[1:01:55] everything you got walk out and go
[1:01:57] home P it on eBay or wherever you want
[1:02:00] to make a ton of money build a big house
[1:02:02] have a big car and you just do whatever
[1:02:04] you can't do whatever you want right
[1:02:07] amen but when you're in this position
[1:02:09] like this as a childish mentality who a
[1:02:13] spoiled brat now in power you talk about
[1:02:18] you talk about uh Power without
[1:02:20] character being
[1:02:22] satanic I mean this is pretty much the
[1:02:24] epitome of having having power without
[1:02:27] character to rule it with
[1:02:30] amen are you
[1:02:32] not the go the governor of all the
[1:02:35] Kingdom of
[1:02:36] Israel arise and eat bread and let thy
[1:02:39] heart be married I will give the The
[1:02:42] Vineyard of nabbo the jezreelite now
[1:02:45] look who's responsible amen right amen
[1:02:49] look who's responsible it's his wife
[1:02:50] it's ahab's wife mean Jezebel is ahab's
[1:02:54] wife I mean I know she's a separate
[1:02:56] individual but he god holds Ahab
[1:02:59] responsible for her actions right
[1:03:03] amen so eth verse so she wrote letter
[1:03:06] now she
[1:03:07] wrote letters I'm going I'll say Ahab
[1:03:10] actually but now again who's responsible
[1:03:13] see but she wrote letters in ahab's name
[1:03:17] sealed them with his seal and sent the
[1:03:19] letters unto the Elders of the no and
[1:03:21] the Nobles that were in the city
[1:03:23] dwelling with nabal and she wrote in the
[1:03:25] letter saying proclaim a fast and set
[1:03:27] naboth on high among the people and and
[1:03:31] set two men sons of Bal yeah it tells
[1:03:34] you we've already gone over what the
[1:03:36] sons of bilar was and the the the uh the
[1:03:40] uh Antichrist or anti the
[1:03:43] anti-god uh uh godlessness of Bilo amen
[1:03:49] so we know what kind of men she's asking
[1:03:52] to be set up as judges
[1:03:56] set up sons of Bilal before him to Bear
[1:03:59] witness against him saying thou didst
[1:04:02] blaspheme God and the king and then
[1:04:05] carry him out and stone him that he may
[1:04:08] die that is Jezebel's
[1:04:11] instructions there there's there's
[1:04:13] nothing righteous to this there's
[1:04:16] there's nothing that nabo has done to
[1:04:20] hold him guilty of this he has not done
[1:04:23] this he's Guiltless of this
[1:04:26] crime but yet she's sending forth
[1:04:29] through again illegal immoral unethical
[1:04:33] means to murder this man right to Murder
[1:04:38] She didn't throw a stone but she
[1:04:39] murdered him Ahab didn't throw a stone
[1:04:43] but he murdered him through his
[1:04:47] wife
[1:04:49] amen carry him out that he may die Stone
[1:04:52] him that he may
[1:04:54] die 11 verse and the men of and the men
[1:04:57] of his City even the elders and the
[1:04:59] Nobles who were the inhabitants in this
[1:05:02] in his city did as Jezebel had sent them
[1:05:05] sent unto them and as it was written in
[1:05:08] the letters which she had sent unto them
[1:05:10] and they proclaimed a fast amen and set
[1:05:14] naboth on high among the people you
[1:05:17] notice just setting a fast or you you
[1:05:21] can see how the things that God had set
[1:05:23] in place to be a a a a religious a
[1:05:28] spiritual
[1:05:30] experience needful for the people and to
[1:05:33] reach God the festivals and and and the
[1:05:38] sacrifices and and the fasts all those
[1:05:42] things were set in place by God so that
[1:05:44] it would it would help try to bring God
[1:05:47] and his people together and in in more
[1:05:50] of a celebration and unity together this
[1:05:52] fast was meant to be a spiritual thing
[1:05:56] not it wasn't meant to be placed in a
[1:05:59] position of a facade if you will to make
[1:06:02] it put on an air like we are performing
[1:06:06] the actual spiritual ritual uh that that
[1:06:10] God had set forth through
[1:06:13] Moses we're going to perform that to to
[1:06:17] try to
[1:06:18] legitimize the Cracker Jack court that
[1:06:21] they're about to hold against
[1:06:23] Neal and there is no Court here because
[1:06:27] the man is Innocent but they're going to
[1:06:30] kill him anyway so there is no court
[1:06:34] there is no truth there is no justice
[1:06:38] but they're figing a religious symbol of
[1:06:41] holding a fast to make it look like
[1:06:44] something that's
[1:06:46] Godly you notice how that is so rampant
[1:06:49] anymore Saints to make it try to look
[1:06:52] like or symbolize is something that God
[1:06:55] is pleased with when it couldn't be is a
[1:06:58] billion miles from
[1:07:00] God nothing even resembling close to
[1:07:04] something that's godliness but let's
[1:07:06] just do this let's hold this fast we'll
[1:07:09] make it look to the people like it's
[1:07:12] legitimate like it's something that's a
[1:07:14] religious uh ordinance is taking place
[1:07:16] no it's
[1:07:18] not it's it's two men by the instruction
[1:07:22] of a jezebel to go and wrongfully murder
[1:07:25] Mur a man who has done nothing
[1:07:28] wrong just to take his
[1:07:31] property amen now you think that you
[1:07:34] think that sets quite right in God's
[1:07:36] core you think that sets quite right in
[1:07:39] God's mind but you see a lot of the same
[1:07:42] thing happening today oh it must be of
[1:07:44] God because of so and so well this must
[1:07:47] be God we held a
[1:07:50] fast this this is happening has got to
[1:07:54] be the will of the Lord because we had
[1:07:56] prayer meeting every Wednesday night oh
[1:07:58] that's that's a nice and I have nothing
[1:08:01] is prayer meeting but when you come
[1:08:03] across just trying to make something
[1:08:05] look like a symbol of something so that
[1:08:07] it's going to present itself uh in it's
[1:08:11] in its front form like it's something
[1:08:14] that's
[1:08:17] Godly what
[1:08:21] what amen you can't make something look
[1:08:27] by like it's God by putting a religious
[1:08:29] symbol on it amen and then call it God
[1:08:33] that's right and saying it's Godly or
[1:08:36] saying it's the will of God it doesn't
[1:08:39] work that
[1:08:41] way tell Ahab later in the story as we
[1:08:44] get to it that amen because he found out
[1:08:48] real quick as we already know what his
[1:08:50] Pro we already know what his Doom is
[1:08:51] because it's been prophesied we already
[1:08:53] read that part but you you ask him and
[1:08:56] see if he had not preferred listening to
[1:08:59] a a a Godly Man and being a friend of
[1:09:03] God instead of an enemy of God but you
[1:09:05] notice they put it's a fast so that that
[1:09:09] legitimizes it that legitimizes an
[1:09:12] innocent man's murder because they hold
[1:09:15] a fast because it looks Godly now this
[1:09:18] is the ritual right that we're supposed
[1:09:20] to take to make it look like it's it's
[1:09:22] on the up and up oh God
[1:09:25] amen
[1:09:27] hypocrisy in its rawest form but it's
[1:09:31] true and it happens so much Saints and
[1:09:35] people hold forth things and say oh this
[1:09:37] is this is
[1:09:40] godliness my mind help us
[1:09:44] Lord I'm going to move on from that amen
[1:09:47] they proclaimed a fast and set nth on
[1:09:51] high among the people and there came
[1:09:55] and there came in two men children of
[1:09:57] Bal sat down before him and the men of
[1:10:00] Bilo witnessed against him even against
[1:10:02] nabo in the presence of the people
[1:10:05] saying saying Nebo did blaspheme God and
[1:10:08] the King Then They Carried him forth out
[1:10:11] of the city and stone him with stones
[1:10:13] till that he
[1:10:15] died just because of the witness of
[1:10:17] those two
[1:10:18] men because of the witness of those
[1:10:21] ungodly men amen those devil worshippers
[1:10:25] those Satan possessed individuals
[1:10:28] because of the witness of to a a good
[1:10:31] Godly honest man was put to death
[1:10:35] because of that for doing nothing wrong
[1:10:39] nothing wrong now they put him to death
[1:10:43] now people think oh I get away with it
[1:10:45] it's okay nothing's happened to me amen
[1:10:49] but look who does God hold
[1:10:52] responsible he didn't say anything about
[1:10:54] in his even in his uh uh prophecies God
[1:10:59] didn't say anything about these two
[1:11:01] men he didn't say anything about the
[1:11:03] city he didn't say anything about them
[1:11:06] the fast setting Nebo he didn't say
[1:11:09] anything about
[1:11:10] that he said you tell Ahab thus sayth
[1:11:14] the Lord you don't go to the town you
[1:11:17] don't go to those men don't even go to
[1:11:19] Jezebel you tell Ahab it's his
[1:11:24] responsibility he's the one in charge
[1:11:26] he's the one responsible you tell Ahab
[1:11:30] tell him thus sayith the Lord because
[1:11:32] you did this I'm
[1:11:35] I then they sent to Jezebel saying
[1:11:38] naboth is stoned and is dead and he came
[1:11:41] to pass when uh Jezebel heard that nabbo
[1:11:44] was
[1:11:45] stoned and that he was dead that Jezebel
[1:11:48] said to Ahab arise take possession of
[1:11:50] the vineyard of Nebo the Israelite which
[1:11:53] he refused to give thee for money for
[1:11:55] naboth is not de alive but dead and it
[1:11:59] came to pass when Ahab heard that naboth
[1:12:01] was dead that Ahab rose up to go down to
[1:12:04] the vineyard of nabbo the jezreelite to
[1:12:07] take possession of it it's like the kid
[1:12:09] who had his face against the wall and
[1:12:11] somehow sulking in the little in this
[1:12:14] little fetal position that he finally
[1:12:16] comes out and he and Jezebel here say
[1:12:19] here's a sucker yay I got a
[1:12:23] sucker or or or somebody ice cream I get
[1:12:26] some ice cream I I have now he comes out
[1:12:29] and he's all happy cuz he's got his
[1:12:33] possession amen did he ask how it
[1:12:36] happened well it doesn't say so in the
[1:12:39] scripture does he even question
[1:12:42] Jezebel doesn't say in the scripture
[1:12:45] right all he cares is he's got his
[1:12:47] sucker he's got his lollipop now he's
[1:12:49] got his fullow of ice cream he's good
[1:12:52] now he can come out of the fetal
[1:12:54] position with his face against the wall
[1:12:56] and try to act like some semblance of a
[1:12:59] man
[1:13:01] again he's finally got his pricee he's
[1:13:04] got his Vineyard but at what
[1:13:07] price at what
[1:13:09] price God told Elijah thus say the Lord
[1:13:14] Ahab the dogs will lick your blood where
[1:13:18] nabos was amen thus sayith the Lord look
[1:13:21] for it's going to happen yes it it might
[1:13:24] not be in five minutes might not be in 5
[1:13:26] days might not be in 5 years but it's
[1:13:27] going to happen yes it is because the
[1:13:29] prophet spoke because the word Prophet
[1:13:32] Elijah spoke and it's going to happen
[1:13:34] amen it will happen praise the Lord
[1:13:37] let's go over to uh the 22nd verse or
[1:13:40] 22nd
[1:13:43] chapter 22nd chapter let's start at the
[1:13:46] sixth verse now they've got a time this
[1:13:50] is three years later I think three
[1:13:53] years it says three years of peace
[1:13:55] between Syria and Israel so I'm I'm
[1:13:58] assuming in that time is that transition
[1:14:01] time it's about a threeyear period now
[1:14:02] it's gone by and josphat goes down to
[1:14:05] Israel the king of uh uh the the king of
[1:14:08] Judah josphat goes down to C Ahab king
[1:14:11] of Israel and while they're talking
[1:14:13] Elijah Ahab says uh you know rou Gilead
[1:14:18] that belonged us that's part of our land
[1:14:22] and Syria is holding on to it wrongfully
[1:14:25] it doesn't belong to them belongs to us
[1:14:26] you know what he was
[1:14:28] right Ahab was actually right that
[1:14:32] property that piece it actually did
[1:14:35] belong to Palestine it belonged to
[1:14:37] Israel it was their possession it was a
[1:14:39] part of the land that God gave them he
[1:14:41] is right it's
[1:14:43] true he said but Syria sets up there
[1:14:46] enjoying the land that is our
[1:14:48] inheritance now look friend you can't
[1:14:51] have it both
[1:14:53] ways you can't have it and say well you
[1:14:56] know this is God's word but I don't like
[1:14:59] this and I don't like this and I don't
[1:15:01] like this and I don't like this and you
[1:15:03] just start ripping Pages or you start
[1:15:05] blacking out it doesn't work like that
[1:15:08] Ahab is willing to take nabos Vineyard
[1:15:12] by uh
[1:15:14] by
[1:15:17] death he's he's willing to cause Israel
[1:15:21] to uh to sin and to C commit adultery
[1:15:25] against
[1:15:26] God but yet when it comes to the
[1:15:29] righteousness the truth which is true
[1:15:32] and right he says but now that's our
[1:15:35] land yes it's true and if you were in
[1:15:38] the right position and if you were the
[1:15:40] right man and if this was the right time
[1:15:42] God would send you forth to go get
[1:15:45] it but Ahab looks at Jehosaphat he says
[1:15:51] that's
[1:15:52] ours I'll go get it if you'll come with
[1:15:56] me jles says absolutely I'm with you my
[1:16:01] men are your men my horses are your
[1:16:02] horses let's go but shouldn't we inquire
[1:16:06] with God about
[1:16:08] this because God didn't give him
[1:16:10] instruction to go God didn't tell them
[1:16:13] yeah it belongs to them but God didn't
[1:16:16] say ramoth Gilead has been in the hands
[1:16:18] of the syrians long enough it's time you
[1:16:20] go gu guys go get it he didn't say that
[1:16:23] he didn't send Elijah down there to say

[1:16:47] Ahab again the spoil brat thinks he can
[1:16:50] have anything he wants Now understand it
[1:16:52] does belong to them but he wants to do
[1:16:55] it on his own ability he wants to do it
[1:16:58] out of his own pride and he doesn't care
[1:17:01] whose life it costs he doesn't care what
[1:17:03] happens to his men or to jehoshaphat's
[1:17:05] men let's go get it at the instruction
[1:17:08] of me or the instruction of God and jeat

[1:19:47] Ahab he's always speaking evil against
[1:19:49] me well why is he doing that
[1:19:52] Ahab because everything you do is
[1:19:55] against God and everything this man says
[1:19:58] is PR
[1:19:59] God so of course everything that he says
[1:20:03] is against you because everything you do
[1:20:05] is against God right hello amen you
[1:20:08] think someone eventually would wake up
[1:20:11] and smell the roses smell the coffee
[1:20:15] smell
[1:20:16] something cuz there's something the fair
[1:20:18] is going on if one man who always spoke
[1:20:22] in the name of the Lord that actually
[1:20:24] came to pass and what came to pass was
[1:20:27] against
[1:20:28] me I would I would start to maybe a
[1:20:31] little common sense and say well maybe
[1:20:32] God's against me and if God's against me
[1:20:36] why I want to find out I don't only want
[1:20:39] to find out I want to change it I want
[1:20:41] to fix it I want to make things right
[1:20:43] with God no see but there's so many
[1:20:46] people out there that don't and a
[1:20:48] prideful person is the hardest nut to
[1:20:50] crack right a prideful spoiled brat is
[1:20:54] the hardest nut to crack you can't
[1:20:56] hardly ever get that person to see that
[1:20:59] they need to repent be humble and give
[1:21:02] their heart to God Amen they're too
[1:21:05] entitled that's right they think they
[1:21:07] can they think they own deserv and
[1:21:10] should get
[1:21:11] everything and everybody else should bow
[1:21:14] down around
[1:21:15] them but isn't there just one more I
[1:21:18] yeah there's one more but I hate him Jos
[1:21:22] fat oh don't say so can you go get get
[1:21:24] it the king called night first the king
[1:21:27] of Israel called an officer said hasten
[1:21:31] hither Micah the son of emblem oh you're
[1:21:33] in for it
[1:21:35] now king of Judah uh the king of Israel
[1:21:38] and Jehosaphat the king of Judah set
[1:21:40] each on his throne having put on their
[1:21:43] robes the void place the entrance of the
[1:21:45] gates of Samaria and all the prophets
[1:21:47] prophesied before them zedekiah even the
[1:21:50] head Prophet the head hirling come up
[1:21:53] and said the son of Chan made his horns
[1:21:57] of iron and said it actually a symbols
[1:21:59] of the Prophet see horns of iron this is
[1:22:02] another religious symbol what does this
[1:22:03] do it's again to fool you into thinking
[1:22:05] this is some Godly
[1:22:08] Expedition God is not in this outside of
[1:22:12] the fact that he's orchestrating
[1:22:13] everything around to make sure that all
[1:22:16] the stuff that happens all around you
[1:22:19] comes and brings you right back to the
[1:22:22] place that you die and the dogs Leck
[1:22:24] your your blood not just lick your blood
[1:22:27] but the exact same spot that they did
[1:22:30] NEOS because that's the prophecy amen
[1:22:34] amen wow every bit of the circumstance
[1:22:37] has to be worked out to bring it that's
[1:22:39] the only part God is playing in this he
[1:22:40] is not what they have amen go up now
[1:22:44] zedi the son of the the son of Chan had
[1:22:48] those ORS of iron iron he said thus said
[1:22:51] now zedekiah says
[1:22:56] thus sayith the
[1:22:58] Lord you are a
[1:23:01] liar you want me to tell you where Liars
[1:23:06] go Liars find their place in hell that's
[1:23:11] where Liars go
[1:23:13] amen I I I'm probably a bit dramatic
[1:23:17] about that but I get so sick of the
[1:23:19] lying that goes on around the world
[1:23:21] today yes people don't think anything
[1:23:23] about lying anymore
[1:23:25] they care nothing they lot you used to
[1:23:28] be I think you used to be put on a l I
[1:23:30] think half the people in this world
[1:23:32] would pass the lighter Tech test today
[1:23:34] because that doesn't mean anything to
[1:23:35] them anymore used to mean something so
[1:23:38] when it means something I know I'm
[1:23:39] getting down a rabbit holes here but I
[1:23:41] got something to say you know used to be
[1:23:44] when when uh uh you you a person would
[1:23:47] lie they would they knew it was wrong
[1:23:50] and their body would react and it would
[1:23:53] and it would react on this machine and
[1:23:55] tell them said that person is lying I I
[1:23:57] bet you probably half the people in this
[1:23:58] world today could lie and not even not
[1:24:00] even trip a a li T right because it
[1:24:04] doesn't mean it's second nature anymore
[1:24:06] they don't care it doesn't matter to
[1:24:08] them in fact I wonder if a lot of people
[1:24:10] even recognize you're even lying right
[1:24:13] and if there's anything even wrong with
[1:24:15] it people of God where they justify
[1:24:18] actions so readily that it doesn't
[1:24:20] matter what they do anymore it's
[1:24:22] Justified
[1:24:24] oh they're just stealing a $1,000 worth
[1:24:27] it's okay it's Justified because they've
[1:24:30] been
[1:24:32] oppressed
[1:24:35] really let's see how
[1:24:38] oppressed when I'll just say personally
[1:24:41] when I'm slaving myself out on a job
[1:24:44] working to make a little money to pay
[1:24:45] some rent and pay the power bill and put
[1:24:47] a little food in my
[1:24:49] tummy how about you come do that yeah oh
[1:24:53] no too enti for that I shouldn't have to
[1:24:56] do that I just go into the store and
[1:24:59] steal everything and then every and
[1:25:01] everybody make excuses well they lied
[1:25:04] well what's the excuse for that you know
[1:25:07] and of
[1:25:09] course politics is the epitome I I
[1:25:13] mean politics is I I know there's
[1:25:16] probably some good people there friends
[1:25:18] but politics is a place where most
[1:25:20] people go to uh enhance their lying
[1:25:26] skills I I just think the greater far
[1:25:30] majority uh most of are just and the
[1:25:33] weird part of it is this side is calling
[1:25:36] them a bunch of liars and this side's
[1:25:38] calling them a bunch of
[1:25:41] liars
[1:25:43] that's you want to talk about the you
[1:25:46] want to talk about the epitome of a pot
[1:25:48] calling a kettle black yeah right it's
[1:25:51] just it it's like I said the other day
[1:25:54] look usually usually when someone's
[1:25:57] harping and pounding on something you
[1:25:59] know why cuz they're usually the ones
[1:26:00] guilty of it great amen that's usually
[1:26:05] true amen that's the way of the devil
[1:26:08] though see because he he knows
[1:26:10] especially you as Christians you keep
[1:26:12] your front door guarded but he wants to
[1:26:13] try to sneak in that back if he can just
[1:26:15] get a wedge on the back door and try to
[1:26:17] come in that way amen that's that's
[1:26:20] exactly what he tries to do bring that
[1:26:22] to bring that spirit in there
[1:26:24] right amen but zedekiah friend zedekiah
[1:26:27] is just flat out liar right you know
[1:26:29] what brother random said about those men
[1:26:31] who try to prophesy or come forth in the
[1:26:33] name of the Lord say thus sayith the
[1:26:34] Lord it doesn't happen he said they need
[1:26:36] to go get prayed for because they've got
[1:26:38] a devil on them amen that's pretty Stark
[1:26:42] but it's the truth he said thus sayth
[1:26:45] the Lord he's lying God hasn't told him
[1:26:49] anything but he said it thus sayith the
[1:26:51] Lord anybody can say it
[1:26:54] thus sayith the Lord with thee shalt
[1:26:56] thou push the syrians until thou have
[1:26:59] consumed them and all the prophets
[1:27:01] prophesied so saying go up to G rth
[1:27:04] Gilead and prosper for the Lord shall
[1:27:06] deliver into the king's hand and the
[1:27:09] messenger that was gone to call Michael
[1:27:12] spake unto him saying behold now the
[1:27:15] words of the prophets declare good unto
[1:27:18] the king with one mouth let Thy word I
[1:27:21] pray thee be like the word of one of
[1:27:23] them and speak that which is good now
[1:27:28] look uh this messenger first of all my
[1:27:34] all these 400 prophets Micah they've all
[1:27:36] they've all spoke good they've all spoke
[1:27:38] good of the king and we want you to
[1:27:41] speak exactly the same way speak only
[1:27:44] what is good you know what that's
[1:27:46] exactly what he did to most people the
[1:27:50] word good is a relative
[1:27:52] term because what's good to you might
[1:27:55] not be good to me Micah like Micah
[1:27:58] thinks Sushi is good I don't amen so
[1:28:03] that's a relative term he might say
[1:28:05] let's go get something good I say yeah
[1:28:07] that's great he pulls into a sushi
[1:28:09] restaurant I'm like I thought you said
[1:28:12] good see it's relative but in truth the
[1:28:16] word God good is not a relative term
[1:28:19] because the only one that is good is God
[1:28:23] amen amen God is the good standard there
[1:28:26] is no other standard for good and if
[1:28:29] it's anything other than God it's not
[1:28:32] good so when he says say something good
[1:28:35] that's exactly what Micah did he said
[1:28:38] what God Said right and God's the one
[1:28:40] that's good so he said what God said he
[1:28:44] said that which was good it might not
[1:28:46] have been good to Ahab it might not have
[1:28:49] been good to zedekiah those four under
[1:28:51] prophets but what Ahab but what Micah
[1:28:53] said was absolutely good because it's
[1:28:55] what God Said Amen praise the Lord Micah
[1:28:59] said as the Lord liveth what the Lord
[1:29:02] saith unto me that will I do I can
[1:29:05] imagine the
[1:29:07] reverberation around the world today is
[1:29:10] still happening from this messenger's
[1:29:13] eye
[1:29:14] roll you can imagine when Micah said I'm
[1:29:19] only going to say what God Said that
[1:29:21] messenger iroll must have been so atic
[1:29:24] you can probably still feel it
[1:29:26] today oh here we go
[1:29:29] again yeah there you go again you know
[1:29:33] why because you got a guy that's only
[1:29:37] going to say what God says you have a
[1:29:39] prophet that only going to say what God
[1:29:42] says you got a man who was murdered that
[1:29:45] wanted to honor his leg Legacy his
[1:29:50] Heritage by God by refusing to sell the
[1:29:54] The Inheritance to an ungodly
[1:29:56] man amen so you got a couple that are in
[1:29:59] there and Micah just happens to be one
[1:30:01] of them but again I can only imagine
[1:30:04] that messenger is probably thinking oh
[1:30:06] my we in for it now amen did you feel I
[1:30:09] felt his eye rolled again just then
[1:30:12] still rolling his eyes are still rolling
[1:30:15] Micah said as the Lord liveth what the
[1:30:17] Lord say to me that will I speak so he
[1:30:19] came to the king now look I I I I love
[1:30:23] this part you just got to read the Bible
[1:30:25] see this is this isn't a cartoon friend
[1:30:28] it's not fictional this it's not
[1:30:30] something that's dramatic or this is
[1:30:32] this is a story of events that actually
[1:30:34] took place from Witnesses he said and he
[1:30:38] came to the king and the King said unto
[1:30:41] him Micah shall we go up against ram of
[1:30:43] Gilead to battle battle or should we
[1:30:46] forbear and look what Micah said and he
[1:30:49] answered him go and prosper for for the
[1:30:54] Lord shall deliver into the hands of the
[1:30:57] king he said the exact same thing the
[1:31:00] other 400
[1:31:02] said but but look what Ahab he could not
[1:31:07] have said it in the same context because
[1:31:10] look what Ahab said the king said unto
[1:31:12] him how many times shall iure thee that
[1:31:16] thou tell me nothing but that which is
[1:31:18] true in the name of the Lord mik's like
[1:31:20] okay you want me to tell you the
[1:31:22] truth so you can imagine what mik is
[1:31:25] probably telling him said he probably
[1:31:27] did the exact same thing that all the
[1:31:30] 400 went up he said and he answered go
[1:31:32] and prosper the Lord shall deliver into
[1:31:35] the hands of the king yeah is that what
[1:31:37] you wanted to
[1:31:38] hear if I fulfill money is that what is
[1:31:41] that what you wanted me to say is that
[1:31:43] what you were looking to hear go yeah go
[1:31:45] go do it God God will be with you you'll
[1:31:48] take it go yeah whatever and then ahab's
[1:31:50] like you know what Micah you're just
[1:31:52] playing with me right right right
[1:31:54] you've always just told me what was
[1:31:56] right in the name of the Lord he said
[1:31:57] okay you want me to tell you what's
[1:31:58] right in the name of the Lord I'll tell
[1:31:59] you amen I'll tell you he said I saw all
[1:32:03] Israel scattered upon the hills of sheep
[1:32:05] that have no Shepherd you want to know
[1:32:08] the truth that's the truth am praise God
[1:32:11] you are not going to take it you are not
[1:32:13] going to conquer it you are not going to
[1:32:15] overcome it it is not going to be
[1:32:18] yours you are going to die in battle if
[1:32:23] you go up there you are going to be a
[1:32:25] dead man because God showed me Israel
[1:32:29] like sheep on the Hills having no
[1:32:31] Shepherd you're a dead man Ahab if you
[1:32:34] go you're a dead
[1:32:36] man and the Lord said these have no
[1:32:39] master let them return every man man to
[1:32:41] his house in peace no master dead the
[1:32:44] king of Israel said unto hos did I not
[1:32:46] tell thee that he would pry no good
[1:32:48] concerning me but evil now he's calling
[1:32:52] God evil
[1:32:53] that's what God
[1:32:56] said if God is speaking evil of what
[1:32:58] you're doing then what you're doing is
[1:33:01] evil amen if God is speaking evil of
[1:33:05] what you are doing then what you are
[1:33:07] doing is
[1:33:08] evil amen amen okay and he said hear
[1:33:12] thou therefore the word of the Lord I
[1:33:14] Saw the Lord sitting on his throne and
[1:33:16] all the hosts of Heaven standing around
[1:33:18] I love this is such a great story Heaven
[1:33:21] standing by him on the right hand and on
[1:33:23] his left the Lord said who shall
[1:33:25] persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall
[1:33:27] at Ram of Gilead because see notice what
[1:33:30] is God doing he's working all these
[1:33:32] circumstances right all this has that
[1:33:34] God's even called a counsel up in heaven
[1:33:36] of all the evil of all the evil spirits
[1:33:38] to come up and try to find out which one
[1:33:40] is going to be able to convince Ahab
[1:33:42] because ahab's got to go to Ramo
[1:33:44] Gilead amen he's got to go to Ramo
[1:33:47] Gilead so what do we
[1:33:50] do and one said on this manner the other
[1:33:52] said on that manner and there came forth
[1:33:54] a spirit that stood before the Lord and
[1:33:56] said uh that stood before the Lord and
[1:33:58] said I will persuade him a spirit a
[1:34:02] spirit yes and the Lord said unto him
[1:34:05] wherewith he said I will go forth and I
[1:34:08] will be a lying spirit in the mouth of
[1:34:10] All His prophets and he said Thou shalt
[1:34:14] persuade him and Prevail also go forth
[1:34:16] and do
[1:34:17] so because the prophecy of Elijah from
[1:34:20] years before is about to be fulfilled
[1:34:24] and I need someone I need a lying Spirit
[1:34:27] to go down or I need a spirit
[1:34:30] need a lying Spirit came forth I will go
[1:34:34] down as a lying spirit and I will put a
[1:34:37] lie in the mouth of all those 400
[1:34:40] prophets you say now how would you call
[1:34:41] a zedekiah a liar because the word calls
[1:34:44] him a liar amen amen not only do he know
[1:34:47] he did not hear from God but we know
[1:34:50] right here that God sent forth a li
[1:34:54] spirit in every one of Elijah's uh
[1:34:56] ahab's prophets and zedekiah was one of
[1:34:59] them he's a liar I will put a lying
[1:35:03] Spirit Thou shalt persuade go and do so
[1:35:06] now therefore behold the Lord ha put a
[1:35:08] lying spirit in the mouth of all these
[1:35:10] prophets you imagine one lone man he's
[1:35:13] got the king of uh of of Judah josphat
[1:35:17] he's got the king of Israel Ahab he's
[1:35:19] got the seriousness of this entire
[1:35:22] Israel going up to to uh to Syria to try
[1:35:25] to go to battle to take rou Gad he's got
[1:35:28] 400 prophets sitting here that he's
[1:35:31] flying in the face of and
[1:35:34] Micah by himself amen this is how we
[1:35:39] know when Micah got so stubborn didn't
[1:35:41] realize that part but Micah stood there
[1:35:45] bull stubborn in the face of all of that
[1:35:48] in those 400 prophecies that every one
[1:35:50] of you is a liar amen
[1:35:54] that that's not easy
[1:35:57] friend that doesn't just happen just
[1:35:59] because you have a passing relationship
[1:36:02] with the Lord amen you've got to have
[1:36:05] something yes to be able to stand there
[1:36:10] and call it out to Ahab like it is the
[1:36:13] king of Israel who could put you to
[1:36:14] death with you know just with one single
[1:36:17] action say take him out son but he's
[1:36:20] calling all 400 of those prophets those
[1:36:22] men those
[1:36:24] all four of them I mean basically he's
[1:36:27] standing there looking over and said all
[1:36:29] 400 of you guys are liars you're all a
[1:36:31] bunch of
[1:36:32] liars God showed me that a Spirit came
[1:36:37] before him and that Spirit left him and
[1:36:40] went in all 400 of you to lie
[1:36:45] right now that that took God Amen people
[1:36:49] might say something like that took
[1:36:51] gumption or something to know that took
[1:36:53] God to have a man stand there like that
[1:36:57] and call all 400 of those men you're a
[1:37:00] bunch of
[1:37:02] liars but that's the truth
[1:37:06] amen had to be
[1:37:08] done amen now therefore behold the Lord
[1:37:10] put a lying spirit in the mouth of all
[1:37:12] these Prophets The Lord has spoken evil
[1:37:15] concerning them but get but zedekiah the
[1:37:17] son of
[1:37:18] chenana the chief
[1:37:20] liar went near and smoked Michael on the
[1:37:23] cheek and said which way the spirit of
[1:37:25] the Lord uh depart from me to speak unto
[1:37:28] thee Micah said behold I'll see one day
[1:37:30] you'll find out one day when thou shalt
[1:37:33] go into thy inner chamber to hide
[1:37:35] thyself you
[1:37:37] liar and the king of Israel said take
[1:37:40] Micah carry him uh back to the uh uh
[1:37:44] back unto Amon the governor of the city
[1:37:46] of joash this King's son and said uh uh
[1:37:50] thus thus sayith the king put this
[1:37:53] fellow in the prison feed him bread of
[1:37:54] Affliction water Affliction until I come
[1:37:57] in peace and look what Micah's last
[1:37:59] parting Micah said if you return at all
[1:38:03] in peace God hadn't spoke to me praise
[1:38:07] the Lord God hasn't spoke by me and said
[1:38:10] and then he turned around with his last
[1:38:13] breath and he said all you people
[1:38:17] listen so they could bear witness to
[1:38:19] what's about to happen that what God
[1:38:22] spoke through that man was the truth
[1:38:25] that was his last word oh hearken old
[1:38:28] people every one of you listen what I've
[1:38:31] told you is the truth that's thus sayith
[1:38:33] the Lord that is God speaking today you
[1:38:36] will be witness of it because your
[1:38:37] King's about to die had l a little bit
[1:38:41] amen he's about to die now what did God
[1:38:44] have to do God sent them to battle and
[1:38:47] even even Ahab tried to disguise him I'm
[1:38:49] going to condense it now a little bit go
[1:38:51] Ahab tried to tried to to uh uh disguise
[1:38:55] himself to make himself not look like
[1:38:57] the actual King oh that's so and they
[1:38:59] went through and they started chasing
[1:39:01] Jos because he had the robes the King on
[1:39:04] and he screamed out and they realized no
[1:39:06] that's not Ahab we're going after Ahab
[1:39:09] and so one looked at him and Drew bow
[1:39:13] and shot him the arrow he died right
[1:39:16] there in the Chariot amen battle raised
[1:39:19] around he died right there in the chot
[1:39:21] of course they did not at that time take
[1:39:23] ramoth Gilead they run scared and
[1:39:26] Scattered because it wasn't thus sayeth
[1:39:28] the Lord right they ran scared they got
[1:39:31] it later absolutely yeah but not then
[1:39:35] they ran scared and Scattered and Ahab
[1:39:38] died right there and they took him uh
[1:39:42] they took him
[1:39:43] off but what but look look at the
[1:39:46] specific prophecy
[1:39:48] here let me see if I can find it because
[1:39:51] I'm trying to move this along
[1:39:55] they shot him with an arrow the joints
[1:39:58] of the
[1:39:59] harness which is a miracle shot really
[1:40:02] you got it's like it's almost like
[1:40:04] David's slingshot with Goliath there's
[1:40:06] like that big of a spot in his entire
[1:40:07] body you can shoot and it would kill him
[1:40:10] the arrows shot him there he said take
[1:40:12] me out for I'm wounded 35th verse the
[1:40:15] battle increased that day the king
[1:40:16] stayed up by The Chariot against the
[1:40:18] syrians and died at even and the blood
[1:40:21] ran out in uh out of the wound into the
[1:40:23] midst of The Chariot but that's not the
[1:40:25] prophecy what was the prophecy the
[1:40:28] prophecy was the dogs will lick your
[1:40:31] blood where it licked nabos that's the
[1:40:36] prophecy there went out a proclamation
[1:40:38] about the host going down in the sun
[1:40:40] saying every man to his City
[1:40:43] exactly what Micah said right exactly
[1:40:46] what God showed Michael Amen to the sing
[1:40:50] every man to his City every man to his
[1:40:52] own country so the king died and was
[1:40:54] brought to Samaria and they buried the
[1:40:57] king in
[1:40:58] Samaria but that's not the
[1:41:01] prophecy now comes the pro the
[1:41:03] Fulfillment of Prophecy and one washed
[1:41:06] the Chariot in the pool of Samaria so
[1:41:10] they took him and they took him aside
[1:41:13] and they buried him but then a
[1:41:16] caretaker a nobody a footwash flunky
[1:41:20] took the Chariot that was full of blood
[1:41:24] to uh to the pool of Samaria and washed
[1:41:28] the Blood Out Of The Chariot and as he
[1:41:31] washed the Blood Out Of The Chariot the
[1:41:33] dogs LIF up his blood yes at the exact
[1:41:37] same spot that they stoned nebar the
[1:41:41] exact same spot that the dogs licked his
[1:41:44] blood is the exact same spot that they
[1:41:47] licked his blood he was never he wasn't
[1:41:50] even
[1:41:51] there Ahab never never even went to that
[1:41:54] part to that point but the Chariot did
[1:41:58] and along with the Chariot came his
[1:41:59] blood when they washed the blood out the
[1:42:02] dogs licked up his
[1:42:04] blood exact same spot amen you said how
[1:42:08] is that going to be and a person you say
[1:42:11] well there's a prophecy I know that that
[1:42:14] my dogs my blood's going to be licked up
[1:42:16] by dogs amen and and I know where nabbo
[1:42:20] was killed I know where the dogs s his
[1:42:21] blood you know what I'll just never go
[1:42:23] over there didn't have
[1:42:26] to he didn't have to go I'll avoid that
[1:42:28] prophecy by not going over there no no
[1:42:31] that doesn't work that way amen uh he
[1:42:35] never went over there but his blood did
[1:42:37] yes the Chariot did the blood did and
[1:42:40] they and and this nobody washed the
[1:42:43] blood out for the dogs to lick his blood
[1:42:45] fulfilling the prophecy that Elijah had
[1:42:48] given amen what was the other prophecy
[1:42:54] that the dogs would eat Jezebel yes not
[1:42:56] lick up her blood but eat her yes by the
[1:43:00] wall of jezel y That's the prophecy yes
[1:43:04] amen you know how to try to avoid that
[1:43:07] don't go to jezrael
[1:43:09] Jezebel but we already found that
[1:43:11] doesn't
[1:43:12] work if the prophecy is the prophecy and
[1:43:15] it's a true prophecy by a true word
[1:43:17] Propet it's going to come to
[1:43:19] pass no matter whether you don't go to
[1:43:21] jel or not if if at the wall in jezel
[1:43:24] the dogs are going to eat your body you
[1:43:26] don't have you just might as well take
[1:43:28] sleeping pill and just go lay down it's
[1:43:30] over done I mean you might have more
[1:43:32] time than that but I mean the bottom
[1:43:35] line is it's going to happen and there's
[1:43:38] nothing you can do about it amen I
[1:43:42] mean it would be nice if there was some
[1:43:45] repentance maybe maybe the Lord would
[1:43:47] have been I don't know but uh the
[1:43:49] prophecy came forth that was it it was
[1:43:51] going to happen now but in Second Kings
[1:43:54] I want to get this and I'm closing I had
[1:43:57] some other scripture but uh you remember
[1:44:00] you remember brother random called
[1:44:01] Elijah Jezebel's
[1:44:04] Pastor amen he did go look it up brother
[1:44:07] randam called Elijah Jezebel's pastor
[1:44:10] but in the second Kings uh the ninth
[1:44:15] chapter we want to fulfill this other
[1:44:18] scripture this other
[1:44:21] prophecy second Kings 9 let's just start
[1:44:24] with verse 30 and when juu was come to
[1:44:29] jezrael jezrael heard it this is a man
[1:44:33] of God obviously the army of
[1:44:36] Israel and Jezebel heard of of of jiu
[1:44:41] coming to
[1:44:43] jezrael and she painted her
[1:44:46] face she tired her head and looked out
[1:44:50] at the window that just made she made
[1:44:51] herself pretty she made her herself look
[1:44:54] uh young or as young as she could or um
[1:44:59] vibrant uh if you will her face uh she
[1:45:02] didn't look all tired and washed out
[1:45:04] that's what that's what it means she
[1:45:06] when she tired her head it means she
[1:45:08] made her try to make herself more alive
[1:45:10] and more vivacious looking uh uh with
[1:45:14] with the painted face and and she looked
[1:45:17] out uh out of the window and ju entered
[1:45:20] in at the gate she he said had zerai
[1:45:24] peace who slew his
[1:45:27] master and he lifted up his face to the
[1:45:30] window and said who is on my side who in
[1:45:35] other words who's on the side of the
[1:45:36] Lord yes who's on God's side amen
[1:45:40] because I'm on God's side and if you're
[1:45:41] on my side we're on God's side who's on
[1:45:44] my side
[1:45:45] who and there and they looked out to him
[1:45:49] two or three
[1:45:51] units and he said thr her down so they
[1:45:54] threw her down and some of her blood was
[1:45:58] sprinkled on the wall and on the horses
[1:46:01] and he troed under her her
[1:46:05] underfoot he just rode over
[1:46:08] her amen and when and when uh when he
[1:46:12] was com in he did eat and drink and said
[1:46:15] go see now this cursed woman and bury
[1:46:19] her for she is a King's Daughter so he
[1:46:22] commanded Ed them to throw her off the
[1:46:24] roof to her death by the wall of
[1:46:29] Jezreel amen King's Daughter in in a
[1:46:32] pronounced place and that was the most
[1:46:36] pronounced place you could be especially
[1:46:38] as royalty at the wall in the wall
[1:46:41] through all out the window at the wall
[1:46:44] of jezrael bam she's done he runs over
[1:46:47] her and he goes in after running over
[1:46:50] her body he goes in and eats has lunch
[1:46:53] pretty good P trami
[1:46:55] sandwich wash it down with a little
[1:46:57] water hey you guys go go see about that
[1:47:00] jeze she was the King's Daughter anyway
[1:47:03] least go out there and bury her they go
[1:47:05] out there and when they went to bury her
[1:47:07] 3 35th
[1:47:09] verse they went to bury her but they
[1:47:11] found no more of her than the skull the
[1:47:15] feet and the palms of her
[1:47:18] hands the dogs that ate her right where
[1:47:22] by the wall of jezel exactly what
[1:47:26] brother what uh brother exactly what
[1:47:29] Elijah prophesied right she
[1:47:32] became a dog's
[1:47:35] exr
[1:47:39] Jezebel it it it's hard to enunciate
[1:47:42] such a descriptive word to understand
[1:47:46] the kind of woman Jezebel
[1:47:48] was but you can understand of the
[1:47:51] character of woman she was by the fact
[1:47:54] that God allowed her to be eaten and
[1:47:59] defecated by a
[1:48:01] dog that I'll tell you all you need to
[1:48:03] know about how what kind of woman
[1:48:06] Jezebel
[1:48:07] was and there's probably a lot
[1:48:10] of uh nothing left but her skull feet
[1:48:13] and hands the palm of her hand therefore
[1:48:16] they came again and told him and he said
[1:48:19] this is the word of the Lord which uh
[1:48:21] which he spake by his servant Elijah the
[1:48:24] uh Elijah the tishbite saying in the
[1:48:26] portion of jezel shall dogs eat the
[1:48:28] Flesh of Jezebel that's exactly right
[1:48:32] the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dumb
[1:48:35] upon the face uh face of the field and
[1:48:38] the portion of jezrael uh uh so that
[1:48:41] they shall not say this is Jezebel no
[1:48:45] Remnant in other words there's not it's
[1:48:47] just going to be scattered out in the
[1:48:48] dung of the field there's not going to
[1:48:50] be a grave to say here Jezebel no
[1:48:54] there's part of her there's part of her
[1:48:57] right amen there's not going to be
[1:48:59] anything left over her that that ought
[1:49:01] to tell y'all you need to know the kind
[1:49:02] of character that woman was right people
[1:49:05] think I get away with it I can do
[1:49:08] anything I want just go heab don't worry
[1:49:11] about it we'll just make sure and get
[1:49:13] some Liars over here we'll get some
[1:49:15] false Witnesses I I'm sure none of us
[1:49:17] have ever had false Witnesses against us
[1:49:20] I'm sure nobody's ever come against any
[1:49:22] body here to say something wrong about
[1:49:24] you make others look and look at you in
[1:49:27] a different yeah know denn is shaking
[1:49:29] his head um yeah I'm sure that's never
[1:49:33] happened to anybody here see it's the
[1:49:34] same thing it's it's the same Spirit yes
[1:49:38] amen same thing happens today yeah you
[1:49:40] say oh curse that person or you can say
[1:49:43] God help that person right you have a
[1:49:45] choice yeah amen my choice is not God
[1:49:48] killed them God not and I don't think
[1:49:50] that was that was anything that would
[1:49:52] have been said Neo probably even though
[1:49:54] it cost him his life probably wouldn't
[1:49:55] said that but this was God's judgment
[1:49:58] yes this was God's judgment among upon
[1:50:01] them amen and it was his to be met out
[1:50:04] now when this when God sent the prophet
[1:50:07] to prophesy it was going to happen even
[1:50:10] if he had to bring this one over here
[1:50:12] and had to do this one over here he had
[1:50:14] to it had to come on it had to come on
[1:50:17] ahab's heart to feel like he wanted to
[1:50:19] go to Ramo Gilead he had to have je uh
[1:50:22] Jehoshaphat there he wouldn't have gone
[1:50:24] by
[1:50:26] himself he wouldn't have gone if
[1:50:27] Jehoshaphat would withheld his men and
[1:50:30] his horses he wouldn't have done it he
[1:50:32] wouldn't have gone if there hadn't been
[1:50:33] the lying mouth and the and the M the
[1:50:36] lying spirit in the mouth of all those
[1:50:38] prophets he wouldn't have gone all those
[1:50:40] things happen God manufactured all that
[1:50:42] to happen just so the prophecy of Elijah
[1:50:45] could be brought
[1:50:46] forth shot with an arrow bleeding in the
[1:50:50] Chariot buried in Samaria but did not
[1:50:54] lick the blood until the pool of Samaria
[1:50:56] which Ahab was never at but his blood
[1:51:00] was amen amen God brings his word to
[1:51:03] pass it may not be the way we think it's
[1:51:06] going to be it may not happen the way we
[1:51:08] have it conceived in our minds but God
[1:51:11] is going to bring it to pass Amen in his
[1:51:14] way in his time the right way the right
[1:51:16] person God's going to do it praise the
[1:51:19] Lorden the best thing we can do is just
[1:51:21] continue to pray trust the Lord and have
[1:51:24] faith amen faith and
[1:51:26] patience sometimes it takes time faith
[1:51:29] and patience amen sometimes it seems
[1:51:32] like three years is forever sometimes it
[1:51:34] seems like it was two days yes amen but
[1:51:37] it will happen yes it took almost 7 was
[1:51:40] it 700 years 800 years for when Isaiah
[1:51:43] said a virgin shall conceive right amen
[1:51:46] before it actually happened it's been
[1:51:48] how it's been 196 since we've been uh uh
[1:51:53] I can't even add 60
[1:51:56] years since brother BR almost 60 years
[1:51:59] since brother Bram said that California
[1:52:00] was going under right he's gone on been
[1:52:04] gone for how many years I imagine
[1:52:06] probably most if not all the people in
[1:52:08] that service that stood there and and
[1:52:10] listened to it live or gone men that we
[1:52:13] know like brother green brother McHugh
[1:52:15] brother Billy Paul they're all
[1:52:18] gone but you know what it will sink yes
[1:52:23] it don't matter if I'm still here or
[1:52:25] you're still here or not it will yes
[1:52:27] period amen amen there's nothing anybody
[1:52:31] can do about it yes they could try to
[1:52:34] bring the most stable cords they can and
[1:52:38] fly helicopters or airplanes all
[1:52:40] whatever hover all day long and try to
[1:52:42] hang that thing it won't happen right
[1:52:45] it's going to break off it's goty you
[1:52:47] know what becomes more real to me too
[1:52:50] because every time I fly over that salt
[1:52:53] and sea I think about it and we fly
[1:52:56] right coming back from Riverside
[1:52:58] California area we fly right over the
[1:53:00] salt and sea I took pictures of it I
[1:53:02] remember what brother ramam said about
[1:53:03] it right amen Plum back to the salt and
[1:53:07] sea it'll break
[1:53:09] off all that just comes flooding back to
[1:53:12] understand it's going to happen yes amen
[1:53:16] we might have things things you pray for
[1:53:19] things you ask God for it may not come
[1:53:22] exactly like you think it's going to but
[1:53:25] it will come it will happen God will
[1:53:27] bring to pass he
[1:53:28] will he gives us the things that we have
[1:53:31] need of Amen we just have faith patience
[1:53:34] believe it God will continue to do it
[1:53:37] amen a true word prophit his words will
[1:53:40] happen it will come to pass yes amen we
[1:53:43] know it we've seen so much of it happen
[1:53:45] so far people can be critical of it they
[1:53:48] can write I hear this uh I hear this
[1:53:50] news I'm sorry to keep you but I hear
[1:53:52] this new new story that's coming out
[1:53:53] supposed to be like a
[1:53:54] Tarter now I don't know if you've all
[1:53:56] heard about it's a 10 a Tarter thing is
[1:54:00] sounds like it's mostly against the
[1:54:01] message and uh how stuff has happened in
[1:54:04] the message and stuff that pastors knew
[1:54:07] about or or brother brandom or something
[1:54:09] or
[1:54:10] uh that people in the 1960s oh imagine
[1:54:15] this somebody in the 1960s whipped
[1:54:18] somebody with a
[1:54:19] belt did you did y'all know that
[1:54:22] happened
[1:54:24] it's just it's it's just it's
[1:54:26] foolishness Saints it's
[1:54:28] ridiculous you could go down pretty much
[1:54:31] any house in America any middle uh
[1:54:34] middle americ neighborhood and the
[1:54:35] child's being whipped with a
[1:54:37] Bel not abused but uh but corrected
[1:54:41] should be probably there was some abuse
[1:54:44] but they're still Abus anyway they don't
[1:54:46] use it the other it's probably more
[1:54:48] mental abuse now today than it was yeah
[1:54:51] I thought
[1:54:52] what kind of a revelation is that a man
[1:54:56] spanked a kid with his belt in
[1:55:00] 1960
[1:55:03] anyway it it seems like these kind of
[1:55:06] people they get such a hatred but
[1:55:08] there's this there's a spirit there you
[1:55:09] know and God's in control of all this so
[1:55:12] amen whatever's coming Lord let it come
[1:55:14] if it's our time let us we're ready to
[1:55:16] go I I'm I'm I feel we had a little more
[1:55:20] grace maybe with this colonel election
[1:55:22] and uh and all but anyway that may just
[1:55:26] be the may turn out to be just the
[1:55:28] opposite right uh but either way God's
[1:55:30] in control of it yes right uh I I like
[1:55:34] the way michah said it michah said I
[1:55:36] vote who I vote I know who I'm voting
[1:55:37] for I know who I want he said but
[1:55:39] ultimately God's in charge whoever God
[1:55:42] says is going to happen amen and that's
[1:55:44] the truth and that's what matters
[1:55:47] doesn't mean we don't engage doesn't
[1:55:49] mean we don't do something me it's like
[1:55:51] saying well you know I I'm a born again
[1:55:54] Christian I know I'm going to heaven so
[1:55:55] what's the point in going to church
[1:55:57] that's right I mean you all are
[1:55:59] believers I don't need to preach to you
[1:56:01] anymore I just go
[1:56:03] home amen but no we still get engaged we
[1:56:07] still plant our potatoes we still as I
[1:56:10] did I voted we still we still plant our
[1:56:13] potatoes amen but this guy he's like a
[1:56:16] lot of the others they all they he he's
[1:56:19] he's dubbed it the message
[1:56:23] if you've not seen it he's dubbed it the
[1:56:25] message we call it the message we use we
[1:56:29] we use words is if you go to any message
[1:56:31] Church you'll hear words used like the
[1:56:34] bride yes oh the end times oh my the
[1:56:40] Seven Seals this is horrible stuff there
[1:56:43] should be such an outcry we use the word
[1:56:46] the term the bride in any message church
[1:56:51] but then you see how notices where he
[1:56:53] goes over and finds I know there's
[1:56:55] things that's happened I know there's
[1:56:56] churches even in this town has done
[1:56:58] things that's
[1:57:00] actually okay things that have been done
[1:57:04] wrong uh but it's just it's like me
[1:57:07] saying okay well that's you know every
[1:57:10] message believer is like this okay well
[1:57:12] then every reporter is a ball liar how
[1:57:16] about that right every every every
