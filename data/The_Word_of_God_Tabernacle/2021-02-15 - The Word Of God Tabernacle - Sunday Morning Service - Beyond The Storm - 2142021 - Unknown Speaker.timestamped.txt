[48:35] part of this service in the name of the
[48:37] lord jesus christ we pray
[48:39] amen amen amen praise the lord
[48:44] will uh i'll just read one verse of
[48:46] scripture and then we'll let you be
[48:47] seated
[48:48] and before we uh and then come back and
[48:51] read the whole thing
[48:53] um let's just read the 32nd verse
[48:57] 30 set matthew chapter 14 verse 32 says
[49:00] and when they were coming to the ship
[49:02] the wind ceased
[49:03] and you could be seated if you like but
[49:05] i do want to jump back over as you're
[49:07] having your seats
[49:08] i do want to jump back over to the 22nd
[49:10] verse just not leave you standing so
[49:12] long but the 22nd verse
[49:14] and and capture this entire story uh
[49:17] as it's given to us here is matthew's
[49:19] account of it now there's
[49:21] matt there's accounts of it mark and
[49:22] luth too but it doesn't go into the
[49:24] account of peter
[49:25] and peter's the one that i wanted to
[49:27] talk about at this point here today
[49:30] uh as of a couple of weeks ago uh i was
[49:33] in the position
[49:34] where uh i thought i was done with a
[49:36] certain scripture and then
[49:37] before i could get home the lord gave me
[49:39] uh more to go on that scripture
[49:42] kind of the same thing happened not
[49:44] exactly
[49:45] but it gave me the fault of uh
[49:49] even though i was looking at something
[49:51] else and starting a different series
[49:53] on after the storm last week we talked
[49:56] about
[49:57] the present storm and the storm that
[49:59] we're going through and what's happening
[50:00] in our lives what's happening in the
[50:01] world today
[50:02] uh and and the thought came to me of
[50:05] after the storm but then when i started
[50:07] studying it
[50:07] and i started looking at it and
[50:09] recognizing the day that we live
[50:12] there won't be now we all have of course
[50:14] our personal
[50:15] storms that we go through in life i'm
[50:16] not talking about that of course that
[50:18] can be coupled in with this
[50:20] but the storm i'm talking about of
[50:21] course is the overall storm that's
[50:23] happening in the world
[50:24] and what's happening in christianity and
[50:26] what's happening to god's bride
[50:27] internationally
[50:28] that's the main thing i want to focus on
[50:30] today so in focusing on that
[50:32] each one of our personal storms of
[50:34] course we know the lord blesses us and
[50:36] helps us we walk through them
[50:38] we see the light at the end of the
[50:39] tunnel god blesses us to reach that
[50:41] uh the end of that tunnel that into that
[50:43] storm and
[50:44] and there's nice calm sunshine it's
[50:46] beautiful on the other side but when i
[50:47] started thinking about the overall
[50:49] picture of this and what we're looking
[50:51] at in the world today
[50:53] there's not going to be an end to this
[50:55] storm uh there's not going to be and
[50:57] after the storm
[50:58] not here anyway so my focus became well
[51:02] then where do we go from there if
[51:03] there's not going to be an after the
[51:04] storm
[51:05] here because this world is going to end
[51:07] up in armageddon and burned
[51:09] in this nation as we know burn border
[51:10] border coast goes so
[51:12] that's that's where this is ending up in
[51:14] apostasy so
[51:15] there won't be that into that storm or
[51:17] the after the storm
[51:19] so what i look at then when the lord
[51:21] gave me the thought then
[51:22] is beyond the storm beyond the storm not
[51:26] necessarily after the storm but beyond
[51:28] the storm
[51:28] because even in the middle of the storm
[51:30] we still live
[51:31] beyond the storm amen so that's what i
[51:34] want to get into today
[51:36] is uh you might understand with this
[51:38] story of peter walking on the water but
[51:39] again let's go back to the 22nd verse
[51:42] and and begin reading there and again my
[51:44] subject today is beyond the storm
[51:46] beyond the storm last week we were in
[51:48] the present day storm we're beyond
[51:50] the storm we talked we want to talk
[51:51] about and straightway
[51:53] now this is of course after jesus fed
[51:54] the 5 000
[51:56] and uh with the two loaves the five
[51:59] loaves and two fishes
[52:02] and uh and jesus straightway constrained
[52:04] his disciples to get into his ship and
[52:06] to go before him
[52:07] unto the other side while he sent the
[52:10] multitudes away
[52:11] and when he had uh sent the multitudes
[52:13] away he went up into a mountain apart
[52:16] away from everybody else to pray and
[52:19] when the evening was come the evening
[52:21] was come he was there alone
[52:23] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[52:25] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[52:28] contrary and in the fourth watch of the
[52:31] night jesus went unto them
[52:33] walking on the sea now
[52:36] you notice that while jesus entered into
[52:39] his prayer
[52:40] by the time that he got to the place of
[52:42] a completion of his prayer or his conver
[52:45] his conversation uh
[52:48] as we have that we spend time with the
[52:50] lord uh
[52:51] he went toward the ship he went to go in
[52:54] the ship
[52:55] but it was the fourth watch now fourth
[52:57] watch if you know scripturally is the
[52:59] last watch of the night
[53:01] they break the watch up of a knight into
[53:03] four different watches
[53:05] and the and the last watch the is the
[53:07] fourth watch
[53:08] so this was at the time again like we
[53:11] talked about last week
[53:12] before the breaking of day where that
[53:15] fourth watch is
[53:16] is when it is the darkest it is the
[53:18] darkest uh before the dawn of course so
[53:21] this fourth watch is that darkest time
[53:23] it's that darkest
[53:25] point now jesus having just prayed
[53:28] went to the was going to the ship
[53:31] but of course god always has a way of
[53:33] doing things and god always has a reason
[53:35] for doing things
[53:37] and he sent them ahead i believe for
[53:39] this very purpose
[53:40] right as he comes walking now
[53:43] if you go look at i can't remember if
[53:45] it's mark or luke's account one of them
[53:47] it talks about how many furlongs they
[53:50] were out in the sea
[53:52] if you and i did a little uh math on
[53:54] that yesterday and if you map
[53:56] it out it was about three miles
[53:58] according to what the bible says
[54:00] in furlongs the ship had gone and it was
[54:02] about three miles off the shore they had
[54:05] rode three miles
[54:06] into now the bible says this matthew's
[54:09] account says they were in the midst of
[54:10] the sea
[54:12] but according to i saw that again that
[54:14] matthew was about three miles out
[54:16] but jesus comes walking on the water
[54:19] up to the boat now a lot of times you'll
[54:22] see depictions of walking on water
[54:25] as it just as nice and calm as the
[54:27] concrete that we're standing on
[54:29] but i want you know that's not what the
[54:30] bible says right the bible says the
[54:33] waves were
[54:34] were whipping because the wind was
[54:36] contrary the wind was blowing the waves
[54:38] and the ship was being tossed back and
[54:40] forth
[54:41] so jesus wasn't walking on water like we
[54:43] look at a floor that's just flat
[54:45] he was walking on the top of the waves
[54:48] he was walking on top of the tumultuous
[54:50] water
[54:51] that was that was white capping so that
[54:53] it was coming over the boat
[54:55] that's the water jesus was walking on he
[54:57] wasn't walking on cold water friend
[54:59] he was walking on stormy water amen amen
[55:03] you understand what i'm saying he's
[55:05] walking on stormy water not just flat
[55:07] plain
[55:08] peaceful water everybody you know when
[55:10] everything's nice and peaceful and
[55:12] everybody's a christian and everything
[55:14] is good and everybody's happy and
[55:16] everything's pleasant good
[55:17] no it's in the middle of the storm that
[55:19] we look at jesus walking on the water
[55:22] when jesus comes to you in the middle of
[55:24] that storm
[55:25] he was coming to them at the darkest
[55:27] time
[55:28] he was coming to them at the at the
[55:30] worst time
[55:32] but he comes walking in a supernatural
[55:34] way amen
[55:35] how many times he come to you in a
[55:36] supernatural way
[55:38] you look and think how could this ever
[55:40] happen how could it go from here to here
[55:42] how could this ever
[55:43] uh be done or fixed or healed or
[55:45] whatever it is
[55:46] god comes in the darkest of times and
[55:48] walks the crests of the waste
[55:50] to make sure he gets to your boat right
[55:53] to make sure that you're taken care of
[55:56] in the fourth watch now he's coming to
[55:58] them
[55:59] walking on the sea and when the
[56:02] disciples saw him walking on the sea
[56:04] they were trouble seeing it as a spirit
[56:06] and they cried out for fear now notice
[56:09] these were fishermen
[56:11] and this is not the first time they had
[56:13] been on a boat
[56:15] in the middle of the sea that was
[56:16] tossing them and about to sink them
[56:18] right you go back to matthew 8 of course
[56:20] is accounted also in other
[56:22] uh uh books of the bible luke matthew
[56:26] luke mark but in matthew 8 they had
[56:28] already been in the storm
[56:30] but jesus had told them let's go to the
[56:32] other side
[56:34] jesus had told him that let's go to the
[56:36] other side
[56:37] well friend there wasn't enough waves
[56:39] there wasn't enough wind
[56:41] there wasn't enough water lightning
[56:43] thunder there wasn't enough
[56:44] devils could pour out of hell to stop
[56:46] that boat from getting to the other side
[56:48] you know why because jesus said
[56:50] something right
[56:51] and when jesus said so that made it
[56:53] possible that made it happen
[56:55] period whether they were on the other
[56:57] side yet or not he had already spoken it
[57:00] right and there wasn't nothing going to
[57:02] stop that boat from getting to the other
[57:03] side
[57:04] but they became fearful they became
[57:07] afraid
[57:08] because the winds were tossed in the
[57:09] boat about and it was
[57:11] up and down the wind the water was
[57:12] coming into the boat and
[57:14] guess who was sleeping in the boat
[57:18] jesus amen they are out there with tubs
[57:21] and
[57:21] dumping water out and they're scared to
[57:23] death and they're yelling and screaming
[57:25] and somebody's like
[57:26] go get jesus and they go down there and
[57:29] he's asleep
[57:30] right they have to wake him up can you
[57:34] imagine being in a boat he ever been in
[57:35] a boat like that
[57:37] anybody ever been in a boat that's
[57:39] that's uh
[57:40] got some waves going and is tossing or
[57:42] at least rocking
[57:44] you ever been out in the ocean on a boat
[57:46] i've been deep sea fishing i've been out
[57:48] on the ocean boat i
[57:49] i don't do that because it's not very
[57:52] i'm
[57:53] not very kind to me um
[57:57] i i tend not to keep my breakfast
[58:00] if i go out like that so i i tend not to
[58:02] do that
[58:03] i love to do it but give me a pond or a
[58:07] lake any day where it's flat like the
[58:08] concrete
[58:09] but when i get out in the ocean and
[58:11] those waves and
[58:13] you know it doesn't take long and i'm
[58:14] done so
[58:16] but but jesus is asleep
[58:20] and the waves are tossing the boat back
[58:22] and forth the waves are coming into the
[58:24] boat and he's sleeping so they have to
[58:26] go wake him up
[58:27] said jesus and he said oh my why you
[58:29] such little
[58:30] faith where is your faith now he doesn't
[58:33] say this scripture doesn't record this
[58:35] but could you just imagine he probably
[58:36] stand there say that
[58:37] look i just told you we're going to the
[58:39] other side
[58:40] did you not believe what i told you did
[58:43] you not trust me at my word
[58:45] i said we're going to the other side
[58:47] that's what's going to happen
[58:48] it doesn't matter how many waves there
[58:50] are it doesn't how much water comes into
[58:52] the boat
[58:53] we're going to the other side amen
[58:55] that's it
[58:56] and so jesus he comes up on the bow of
[58:58] the boat because of their lack of faith
[59:00] and he says
[59:01] when be still and the storm stops
[59:05] right the water comes wind goes away
[59:08] maybe the sun comes out
[59:10] and they're nice and calm then
[59:11] everything is fine and that's exactly
[59:14] what it is for people in their lives
[59:16] they just everything becomes calm and
[59:17] they're like oh okay good i can go to
[59:19] church again
[59:20] oh well you should have been going to
[59:21] church whole time space that's the you
[59:23] know it seems like the time that people
[59:24] quit going it's the time they should be
[59:26] going the most
[59:26] amen when the troubles of life strike
[59:29] and when things get hard
[59:31] the first thing you want to do is start
[59:32] coming i think that's that's when you
[59:34] should come
[59:36] you know let's pray for you lay hands on
[59:38] you something that's the best time to
[59:40] come
[59:40] it's when the waters are are tumultuous
[59:43] right right
[59:44] and and and the storm stopped
[59:47] well here now they're afraid it doesn't
[59:50] say they're afraid because of the storm
[59:53] it says they're afraid because they saw
[59:55] jesus and thought it was a spirit
[59:58] that that's what made them afraid
[1:00:00] according to this scripture
[1:00:01] they were troubled saying it's the
[1:00:03] spirit and cried out with fear
[1:00:05] just because they thought this is a
[1:00:07] spirit come walking on the water
[1:00:08] well in all fairness it does pretty much
[1:00:12] defy
[1:00:13] logic for anybody to walk on water right
[1:00:15] yeah
[1:00:16] that just i mean i've heard of it
[1:00:18] happening outside of this scripture
[1:00:20] of people individuals needing to an
[1:00:23] emergency situation get from one end of
[1:00:25] the lake to another and they walk across
[1:00:27] the lake
[1:00:28] i believe that's true anybody if you had
[1:00:31] the need and the situation rose and you
[1:00:33] had the faith
[1:00:34] you'd be able to do this exact same
[1:00:35] thing yeah amen i believe that
[1:00:38] but see they were afraid because of what
[1:00:40] they saw
[1:00:42] now these were fishermen i can't imagine
[1:00:45] as they went out of their boat on the
[1:00:47] sea every day that they
[1:00:49] didn't run into storms before that they
[1:00:51] didn't run into
[1:00:52] waves and the rockiness of the storm
[1:00:55] but the fear came because of the unknown
[1:00:59] the unknown fear that's and that's what
[1:01:01] gets a lot of people
[1:01:02] the unknown is what people are scared of
[1:01:05] a lot of people are scared to die
[1:01:07] when i was a little kid at one point i
[1:01:10] didn't want to die i was afraid to die i
[1:01:11] want my
[1:01:12] parents and family and i because it was
[1:01:15] something that's of the unknown
[1:01:16] right and a lot of people still today it
[1:01:19] is something of the unknown
[1:01:21] they don't know even christians sometime
[1:01:23] will come and say
[1:01:24] they don't know that it's of the unknown
[1:01:27] so the unknown is what they're afraid of
[1:01:29] not necessarily the death or the process
[1:01:31] of death or losing a loved one
[1:01:33] it's the unknown but i praise the lord
[1:01:36] jesus that today we've had a prophet of
[1:01:38] god that's gone beyond the curtain of
[1:01:39] time
[1:01:40] and told us exactly what it's like so
[1:01:42] it's not unknown anymore
[1:01:44] amen you can't fear what you know
[1:01:46] because you know it's there because
[1:01:48] jesus
[1:01:48] has already prepared a place for us yeah
[1:01:51] and we had a prophet go and
[1:01:52] and and record say it was like this and
[1:01:54] this and we can know exactly
[1:01:56] praise the lord there's no unknown but
[1:01:58] the world doesn't know that
[1:02:00] right how much of today is of the
[1:02:02] uncertainty
[1:02:04] as of the unknown the world today they
[1:02:07] think they have all the answers but the
[1:02:09] truth is they have
[1:02:10] no answers right they go from one point
[1:02:13] to the next point and it just
[1:02:14] just keeps getting darker and darker but
[1:02:17] why does it keep getting darker and
[1:02:18] darker with every decision to make
[1:02:20] with every election we'll say and it
[1:02:22] comes along and all the laws they pass
[1:02:25] and the mandates and
[1:02:26] all the things they do it just keeps
[1:02:27] getting darker and darker but why is it
[1:02:29] getting darker
[1:02:31] it's getting darker because this is the
[1:02:33] time of the finality of this world's
[1:02:35] history right it's also getting darker
[1:02:37] because they're not basing their
[1:02:39] decisions on scripture
[1:02:41] on the word they're basing their
[1:02:42] decisions on what they think is the
[1:02:45] right thing to do
[1:02:46] and what they think might get it from
[1:02:48] this point to this point
[1:02:49] and make it all better right the other
[1:02:51] reason it's getting darker is the
[1:02:53] motives
[1:02:54] the motives behind people is not for the
[1:02:57] people anymore
[1:02:58] the elected officials leaders people
[1:03:00] that are in
[1:03:02] a great big business have tons of money
[1:03:04] the motive is not for the little guy
[1:03:06] like you and me
[1:03:07] the motive is for how are they going to
[1:03:09] get richer
[1:03:10] how are they going to be able to sustain
[1:03:13] how are they going to be able to rise
[1:03:15] above this and get better that's what
[1:03:16] they care about
[1:03:17] it's my for and no more right a lot of
[1:03:20] times it's what it's become
[1:03:21] unfortunate in this world like i talked
[1:03:23] about the other day the love of money
[1:03:25] greed popularity power people out there
[1:03:29] today hungry for power
[1:03:31] they want power so much and this
[1:03:34] climate change situation has taken over
[1:03:37] in a lot of those venues where people
[1:03:40] have indoctrinated themselves i'm
[1:03:42] surprised
[1:03:43] that i don't drive around tucson today
[1:03:45] now i've seen certain churches in
[1:03:46] certain it says it's the church that
[1:03:48] church of tamra is actually right down
[1:03:50] here on the corner i have no clue what
[1:03:52] that even is
[1:03:53] but it's called the church of tamara i
[1:03:54] don't i don't know what that is but down
[1:03:56] here on floyd wells
[1:03:57] you just you go down country club turn
[1:03:59] left on flowing wells it's right there
[1:04:00] on the left
[1:04:01] church of tamra i don't know what that
[1:04:02] is there's another one over here on
[1:04:04] pima's got all kinds of gold stuff and
[1:04:06] emblems and stuff all over it uh between
[1:04:09] uh will mountain
[1:04:10] and croft on pima there's a some kind of
[1:04:13] church it says it's some
[1:04:14] religious organization but i'm i'm
[1:04:17] actually surprised
[1:04:18] and maybe there is i just haven't passed
[1:04:20] it that there's not a church out here
[1:04:22] today that says the church of the
[1:04:23] climate change
[1:04:25] it's become such a religion to people
[1:04:27] amen the church of climate change
[1:04:30] and that's they go to worship their
[1:04:32] climate change they bow down to their
[1:04:34] wind or wave or whatever they i don't
[1:04:36] know al gore
[1:04:37] maybe that's terrible i'm not sure maybe
[1:04:39] that's their person
[1:04:40] but anyway i'm surprised it's not but
[1:04:43] you you understand the power that's
[1:04:45] behind that i mean a lot of religious
[1:04:47] leaders
[1:04:49] it got me to thinking about a quote i
[1:04:51] read last week and i want to read it
[1:04:53] again
[1:04:54] that it talked about and brother branham
[1:04:56] said in many places
[1:04:58] about germ warfare and diseases and
[1:05:01] things that would hit this earth that
[1:05:03] the skin would melt off the people and
[1:05:04] the doctors would know nothing about
[1:05:06] but you know there's people out there
[1:05:08] today wealthy people
[1:05:09] powerful peoples those of whom i
[1:05:12] might know or have heard but i will not
[1:05:15] say on streaming
[1:05:17] but very powerful people they believe
[1:05:19] that this world should only have a half
[1:05:21] a billion
[1:05:22] people that means you've got to kill off
[1:05:25] six and a half billion people why are
[1:05:28] you going to do it
[1:05:29] yeah well you could start with covent
[1:05:32] amen you could start with coven but look
[1:05:35] at this
[1:05:36] brother madam said the oncoming storm we
[1:05:38] see the newspapers on coming storm when
[1:05:40] you go home tonight do me a favor read
[1:05:42] revelation 8 chapter you see the
[1:05:44] oncoming plagues and storms
[1:05:46] that's to hit this earth you know a lot
[1:05:47] of times we think uh
[1:05:49] we think things are just something that
[1:05:52] god just snaps his finger and all of a
[1:05:53] sudden supernatural gets there
[1:05:56] but you know god allows and manipulates
[1:05:58] the devil to be able to get into people
[1:06:00] to cause these things to happen
[1:06:02] sometimes
[1:06:03] because you know bible said brother
[1:06:04] brown said man will destroy themselves
[1:06:07] right man will destroy themselves
[1:06:10] and he said god will destroy those who
[1:06:12] destroys the earth
[1:06:14] so you think about scripturally now
[1:06:17] these things are about to hit the earth
[1:06:19] the plagues the storms as they hit the
[1:06:21] earth thunder's light
[1:06:22] is going to shake the heaven woes are
[1:06:24] going to pass
[1:06:25] over the nation men will rot in their
[1:06:28] flesh
[1:06:29] diseases will strike them the doctors
[1:06:31] know nothing about
[1:06:32] what is the best way that these people
[1:06:35] out here
[1:06:36] have in their minds to try to eradicate
[1:06:38] six billion people
[1:06:40] i'll just sneak out a little something
[1:06:42] here kill a little bit they call it
[1:06:44] population control
[1:06:46] you know unless you're in a third world
[1:06:47] country then they call it genocide
[1:06:50] but you know if we're civilized people
[1:06:52] we call it population control
[1:06:55] sterilize people in a way that they
[1:06:57] can't have children ovulate
[1:06:58] and kind of kill off some of the others
[1:07:00] that they you know they're not going to
[1:07:02] be worth much
[1:07:03] anyway like courses cloven has killed
[1:07:05] off a lot of the older people
[1:07:07] you know because they become expendable
[1:07:08] they're not important anymore you know
[1:07:10] reach a certain age and uh you know we
[1:07:13] don't need you anymore
[1:07:14] well i beg to differ but that's a whole
[1:07:16] nother subject
[1:07:17] but this whole thing is is is is the
[1:07:20] darkness
[1:07:21] that's driving it that the storm that's
[1:07:24] taking over
[1:07:26] that men are destroying themselves
[1:07:29] men people are causing these things to
[1:07:32] happen
[1:07:33] and they're killing all people on
[1:07:35] purpose
[1:07:37] to try to control they are so
[1:07:39] indoctrinated with this thing
[1:07:40] that they they they're killing people
[1:07:43] off
[1:07:44] and of course you get away with it
[1:07:45] because you know
[1:07:48] uh joe blow scientists over here might
[1:07:50] know about it but all a certain guy has
[1:07:51] to do is
[1:07:52] you know stick a couple meal in his bank
[1:07:54] account and
[1:07:56] dr joe blows my mouth gets shut you know
[1:07:58] oh i'm set for life now so whatever else
[1:08:01] happens
[1:08:02] you know of course the next one that
[1:08:04] might get it might be his daughter
[1:08:05] right or his father or whatever but you
[1:08:09] know
[1:08:09] i think if these people really want to
[1:08:11] do population control they should begin
[1:08:13] with themselves
[1:08:15] they don't want to do that though see
[1:08:17] that's a whole other thing
[1:08:21] they're not willing they're not that
[1:08:22] committed
[1:08:24] jesus was so committed to us into this
[1:08:28] uh we won't call it religion but uh
[1:08:31] to us that he gave himself
[1:08:34] right he died himself he was the one
[1:08:37] that was willing to because of what he
[1:08:40] because of who we were to to to die
[1:08:43] to bring us to himself to
[1:08:46] uh anoint and to bring this
[1:08:49] uh this move this this word to a place
[1:08:52] of putting it into the hearts of the
[1:08:54] people that we've become so
[1:08:57] uh filled with his spirit that we will
[1:08:59] do what he tells us to do
[1:09:01] amen amen it's not ethical uh unethical
[1:09:04] it's not immoral it's not unrighteous
[1:09:07] it's in the righteousness and truth of
[1:09:09] god's word
[1:09:10] so you see the contrast you see the
[1:09:12] waves capping
[1:09:14] jesus walking on the water now jesus is
[1:09:17] walking on the water
[1:09:18] then what is the next thing to happen
[1:09:22] is to calm everything down right amen
[1:09:25] that's what jesus does amen once the
[1:09:28] once the waves have come and the
[1:09:30] and the the appointed purpose has taken
[1:09:32] place then it comes right back down to
[1:09:34] where it was supposed to be
[1:09:36] but look what it says here
[1:09:39] when they were when they were afraid
[1:09:42] 27th
[1:09:43] verse now straightway jesus spake unto
[1:09:45] them saying
[1:09:46] be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
[1:09:50] amen and peter remember big now peter
[1:09:53] amen peter's always uh got something to
[1:09:56] say
[1:09:57] good bad and different peter's always
[1:09:58] got something to say remember that's why
[1:10:00] he became the spokesman of the group
[1:10:02] there that's why on the day of pentecost
[1:10:04] god used
[1:10:05] what uh peter's mouth would get him in
[1:10:08] trouble sometimes but god used that
[1:10:10] on the day of pentecost he was the
[1:10:11] spokesman and stood out there and told
[1:10:13] exactly what was going on behind him
[1:10:15] right
[1:10:16] what was happening with the moving and
[1:10:18] the feeling of the holy ghost he
[1:10:19] explained it to the people
[1:10:20] and said you can have it too right be
[1:10:23] baptized
[1:10:24] repent be baptized in the name of the
[1:10:26] lord jesus christ and you shall have
[1:10:28] what they've got amen
[1:10:30] amen and it's just what the scripture
[1:10:32] said
[1:10:33] it's just what joel taught us it's just
[1:10:36] a fulfillment of that
[1:10:37] if you know the bible you know exactly
[1:10:39] what uh what what was going to take
[1:10:41] place well friend
[1:10:42] if we know the bible we know exactly
[1:10:44] what's taking place now
[1:10:46] what's going to take place today but
[1:10:48] look what
[1:10:49] jesus did jesus lived
[1:10:53] beyond the storm and i say that even
[1:10:56] though he was in the middle of the storm
[1:10:58] he lived beyond the storm because his
[1:11:01] wall was defiant to all of the elements
[1:11:04] that was going on around him
[1:11:06] he was walking on the water he was
[1:11:09] walking through the wind
[1:11:10] the waves the the uh
[1:11:13] the storm and everything that was going
[1:11:15] on around him oblivious to that
[1:11:17] just walking or cresting the waves going
[1:11:19] across so he was living
[1:11:21] walking above or beyond the storm
[1:11:24] right he was in it amen okay i hope you
[1:11:26] understand what i'm trying to say
[1:11:28] he was in it but he was beyond it
[1:11:31] because the elements weren't affecting
[1:11:34] him
[1:11:34] it may have been blowing his his uh coat
[1:11:37] or mantle
[1:11:38] uh and things like that he may have been
[1:11:40] getting wet probably was i'm sure he was
[1:11:43] so he was feeling the effects of it but
[1:11:45] he was living beyond it
[1:11:47] amen that's what the bride is to do
[1:11:49] today
[1:11:50] is to be in a place to live in a place
[1:11:52] to where you're living beyond
[1:11:54] the storm you're living beyond what's
[1:11:57] going on
[1:11:57] yes laodicea is going on yes we feel the
[1:12:01] effects of what's going on in this
[1:12:02] country and
[1:12:03] in our lives and in in the situations we
[1:12:06] feel the effects of all that
[1:12:08] but we live beyond that yeah yes amen
[1:12:12] we live beyond that hope under that
[1:12:15] makes sense
[1:12:15] now when jesus was there
[1:12:19] and he was living beyond the storm amen
[1:12:22] you like my our audition amen uh
[1:12:26] brother brother dennis donated a hoffman
[1:12:28] head to us
[1:12:30] and um we were going to get it reframed
[1:12:33] and sonia decided to fix the frame
[1:12:35] but i was tired of it being a blank wall
[1:12:37] so i just bought ours over
[1:12:39] so this is our pick this is actually
[1:12:41] ours that hung in our home and sonia's
[1:12:42] going to fix the other one
[1:12:44] to put up here so anyway amen i like it
[1:12:47] too so i'm glad you like it
[1:12:49] but now as jesus jesus is walking beyond
[1:12:53] the storm when he's
[1:12:54] uh living beyond the storm he's showing
[1:12:57] to the disciples
[1:12:59] how they should live and because
[1:13:02] we have to understand we look in the
[1:13:05] bible
[1:13:05] and we see the life of jesus we look in
[1:13:08] the message and we see what brother
[1:13:10] branham did and how he lived
[1:13:12] and and we think okay that was great
[1:13:15] that was jesus oh that was great that
[1:13:17] was brother branham
[1:13:18] jesus didn't live this to be for him
[1:13:22] only right brother branham was not an
[1:13:24] example by jesus christ
[1:13:27] for him to do that alone right those
[1:13:30] lives were examples that we were
[1:13:33] supposed to emulate
[1:13:35] if jesus lived it we can live it if
[1:13:38] jesus did it
[1:13:39] we can do it if jesus said it we can say
[1:13:43] it
[1:13:43] because god christ came so that he would
[1:13:46] be our example
[1:13:48] and as he's walking on the water to the
[1:13:50] boat he's doing it as an example to
[1:13:52] those that were in the boat
[1:13:55] all things are possible to you that's
[1:13:58] exactly what he told them
[1:14:00] nothing shall be impossible unto you
[1:14:03] well if he did that then what does that
[1:14:05] tell us today
[1:14:06] then that tells us that nothing is
[1:14:07] impossible to you
[1:14:09] nothing is impossible to me so what did
[1:14:12] peter do
[1:14:13] peter answered him and said lord if
[1:14:17] be thou bid me come unto thee on the
[1:14:19] water and he said come
[1:14:22] that's the whole point he probably could
[1:14:24] have stood there and said how about the
[1:14:25] rest of you
[1:14:28] is peter the only one that's going to do
[1:14:30] it
[1:14:31] is peter the only one that has the faith
[1:14:33] now
[1:14:36] you know i have a scofield bible my
[1:14:38] school feel bible says jesus walks on
[1:14:40] the water and peter's little faith
[1:14:41] excuse
[1:14:42] me i'm sorry but it takes a lot more
[1:14:45] than just a little faith to walk on the
[1:14:47] water
[1:14:49] and that's exactly what peter did yes i
[1:14:52] know he began to sink
[1:14:54] but he walked on the water from the boat
[1:14:57] to where jesus was
[1:14:58] right that's what it says jesus just
[1:15:01] said come
[1:15:03] and he probably said where's the rest of
[1:15:04] you well i'm the rest of you come out
[1:15:06] here and meet me
[1:15:08] the ball will take care of itself right
[1:15:10] we'll take care it's all going to be
[1:15:12] fine
[1:15:12] why don't you just all come out here in
[1:15:14] the middle of the waves and let's just
[1:15:15] have a nice revival
[1:15:18] but see there was only one that could do
[1:15:20] it only one that had the faith
[1:15:22] the confidence to be able to step off
[1:15:25] that boat and walk on the water to where
[1:15:27] jesus was standing
[1:15:28] and that was peter so jesus said come
[1:15:32] and when peter was come down out of the
[1:15:33] ship he walked on the water to go to
[1:15:36] jesus amen
[1:15:39] notice the water had not calmed yet
[1:15:42] so the water that peter was walking on
[1:15:44] was the exact same water that jesus was
[1:15:46] walking on
[1:15:47] and it wasn't like the concrete it
[1:15:49] wasn't like a flat surface
[1:15:50] this was waves and wind and it was a
[1:15:54] tumultuous time that he's walking and
[1:15:56] cresting the waves just to try to get to
[1:15:58] jesus
[1:15:59] amen amen the man just like you and i oh
[1:16:02] that was peter well what about
[1:16:04] us right amen aren't you a human too
[1:16:08] aren't you a believer too aren't you one
[1:16:10] of god's chosen aren't you
[1:16:12] uh one of god's children don't you have
[1:16:14] faith to believe
[1:16:15] then what about us now understand
[1:16:18] i'm not going to go out to silverbell
[1:16:20] lake and just try to walk across it
[1:16:22] that's not how it works but i believe if
[1:16:25] i was there and there was a need for me
[1:16:26] to have to get across their emergency or
[1:16:28] something
[1:16:29] i absolutely believe that be just like
[1:16:32] concrete
[1:16:33] yes just walk across it amen amen
[1:16:36] by faith believe what would jesus do if
[1:16:39] he was standing out there oh come on
[1:16:42] come on amen just come on
[1:16:45] and she and then peter got out of the
[1:16:47] boat and he walked up jesus
[1:16:49] right amen amen so that's not little
[1:16:52] faith to me
[1:16:53] so i i have an issue with schofield of
[1:16:55] course i have an issue with several
[1:16:57] notes of scofields in here but that one
[1:16:59] is another one
[1:17:00] peter's little faith no no peter walked
[1:17:02] on the waterfront it takes more than a
[1:17:04] little faith to walk from the water
[1:17:06] uh see we went to jesus but when peter
[1:17:09] got his eyes and saw the the blind
[1:17:13] bolsters he was afraid and beginning to
[1:17:17] sink
[1:17:17] he cried saying lord save me now we've
[1:17:20] all been there
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:22] and immediately jesus stretched forth
[1:17:24] his hand caught him and said unto him
[1:17:26] and we've all been there too
[1:17:28] oh thou of little faith wherefore didest
[1:17:31] thou
[1:17:32] didst thou doubt where did you doubt
[1:17:35] what
[1:17:36] what came into this life jesus peter
[1:17:39] walked on the water
[1:17:40] but when as he began to sink jesus
[1:17:42] grabbed him and said you
[1:17:43] have little faith well what was that
[1:17:45] faith it was the lack of faith to
[1:17:47] continue on with what he was doing
[1:17:50] to continue on to walk just like jesus
[1:17:52] was walking
[1:17:53] now there's no account in here and of
[1:17:56] course
[1:17:56] mark and luke don't even account peter
[1:17:59] but there's no accounting here of how
[1:18:00] the two of them got to the boat
[1:18:03] some people say jesus carried peter some
[1:18:06] people believe peter walked on the water
[1:18:08] with jesus back to the boat
[1:18:10] we don't know i'd rather believe that he
[1:18:13] that when jesus
[1:18:15] picked him up and said where's your
[1:18:16] faith that he probably walked back with
[1:18:18] him and the two of them together walked
[1:18:19] back to the boat but that's just my
[1:18:21] opinion
[1:18:21] you can have your opinion that's okay
[1:18:23] because even if jesus carried him it's
[1:18:26] like the
[1:18:26] footprints in the sands of time you know
[1:18:30] there's two sets of footprints all of a
[1:18:31] sudden there's only one and you look
[1:18:33] back in life say well that was the
[1:18:34] hardest trial i had in my life and
[1:18:36] you've only one set of footprints why
[1:18:38] did you abandon me and the ones that
[1:18:40] said no that's my footprints i was
[1:18:43] carrying you
[1:18:44] amen amen could have been that too and
[1:18:46] that's fine
[1:18:47] if that's what happened that's okay but
[1:18:50] when they were coming to the ship i want
[1:18:52] you to see now when they came into the
[1:18:53] ship
[1:18:54] the wind ceased when they came into the
[1:18:57] boat
[1:18:58] it ended amen when jesus got there
[1:19:01] the wind ceased it stopped i also
[1:19:04] understand
[1:19:05] what peter was doing was even before the
[1:19:07] holy ghost had been given
[1:19:09] peter's faith and what peter was doing
[1:19:11] there was even before the holy ghost had
[1:19:14] fallen and come on to the people
[1:19:15] he still had the faith to believe at
[1:19:17] that time which shows you saints
[1:19:19] every man has dealt the measure of faith
[1:19:21] right people out here today
[1:19:23] they get healed how do they get healed
[1:19:24] if they're unbelievers or atheists
[1:19:26] and god's the one that's the healer
[1:19:28] because they have faith
[1:19:30] right they believe if they have belief
[1:19:32] whatever it is
[1:19:33] they have faith whatever it is that god
[1:19:36] uh that
[1:19:37] and god heals them because all healings
[1:19:39] of god
[1:19:40] they have to have faith when they come
[1:19:42] into the boat the wind ceased
[1:19:44] the storm stopped amen the storm stopped
[1:19:48] and then all of a sudden they're sitting
[1:19:50] there together then they were in the
[1:19:52] ship
[1:19:52] came and worshipped him saying of a
[1:19:54] truth thou art the son of god
[1:19:57] when they were gone over they came to
[1:19:58] the land of ganesha
[1:20:00] and when the men of that place had
[1:20:02] knowledge of him they sent out unto
[1:20:04] all the country round about brought unto
[1:20:06] him all that were
[1:20:07] diseased and besought him that they
[1:20:11] might only touch the hymn of his garment
[1:20:13] and as many as
[1:20:14] touched were made perfectly whole praise
[1:20:17] the
[1:20:18] lord perfectly whole so even if it was
[1:20:21] just for the briefest
[1:20:22] moment of time peter lived beyond the
[1:20:25] storm
[1:20:26] he walked on the water negating all the
[1:20:30] elements
[1:20:30] everything that was going on around the
[1:20:32] fact that it was on water which is
[1:20:34] impossible for humans to do outside of
[1:20:36] course supernatural
[1:20:38] he neglected all that forgot about all
[1:20:41] that
[1:20:41] kept his eyes on christ and he was able
[1:20:43] to walk on the water in the middle of
[1:20:45] all the elements
[1:20:46] the storm the way everything else that
[1:20:47] was going on beside the quota
[1:20:49] or the the uh thing that i told you last
[1:20:52] week mike had sent to me and says
[1:20:54] jesus was there the big storm going on
[1:20:56] behind him it says if you long as your
[1:20:57] eyes on me you can't see the storm
[1:21:00] don't keep your eyes on the storm keep
[1:21:01] your eyes on me amen that's a refocus
[1:21:04] and that's exactly what god wants us to
[1:21:06] do refocus
[1:21:07] to forget about and to look beyond i'm
[1:21:10] not saying forget i shouldn't use that
[1:21:12] i'm not saying forget about it because
[1:21:13] we're still here friends we're still a
[1:21:15] part of this world we still have a
[1:21:16] responsibility to it i'm not saying
[1:21:18] forgive but
[1:21:18] but live beyond the storm that's going
[1:21:21] on amen
[1:21:22] we feel the effects of it you say well
[1:21:25] how do i feel the effects of it well did
[1:21:27] they send you a stimulus check
[1:21:28] did you get it i see a fax
[1:21:33] uh tax time's up uh it's here
[1:21:36] are they gonna take money taxes out of
[1:21:38] your pay or
[1:21:39] you're gonna have to pay taxes that's
[1:21:41] the effects right and that's just
[1:21:43] simple uh dollars and cents that are a
[1:21:46] part of that
[1:21:47] uh scenario but it's still true it's
[1:21:50] that's
[1:21:51] part of the effects uh when they open up
[1:21:54] the board a bunch of
[1:21:55] illegals or whatever you're going to
[1:21:56] feel the effects
[1:21:58] people feel the effects i mean even if
[1:22:00] they're good people they take a lot of
[1:22:01] jobs
[1:22:02] and people feel the effects because they
[1:22:04] can't find a job i mean it's just
[1:22:06] that that's a whole other scenario but
[1:22:08] you understand you feel the effects of
[1:22:10] it
[1:22:11] regardless but we have but we're
[1:22:13] supposed to live
[1:22:14] beyond it right am i be beyond it amen
[1:22:18] i mean you you we're all here born again
[1:22:20] christians i believe we are
[1:22:22] trust we are for not i wouldn't leave
[1:22:23] this building until you got the holy
[1:22:25] ghost today
[1:22:26] that's exactly the hour that we're
[1:22:27] living friend you better be born again
[1:22:29] or it's not good news right
[1:22:33] but i trust you all have the holy ghost
[1:22:35] now holy ghost brings us into a
[1:22:37] different position
[1:22:38] with christ brings us into a different
[1:22:40] place
[1:22:41] with the word now look what brother
[1:22:43] branham said here in revelation chapter
[1:22:45] five
[1:22:45] uh it's number one june 61 he said but
[1:22:49] you see now
[1:22:50] we have by the holy spirit okay so
[1:22:53] our confession is we have the holy
[1:22:55] spirit all right well then this
[1:22:57] if we do this pertains to us
[1:23:01] by the holy spirit the earnest of our
[1:23:03] inheritance
[1:23:04] because we have been lifted up from the
[1:23:06] things of the world
[1:23:09] we have borne again been lifted up
[1:23:12] from the things of the world so you see
[1:23:15] where
[1:23:15] this is when you're when you're born
[1:23:17] again to have the holy ghost
[1:23:19] where you are living where we are
[1:23:22] supposed to live
[1:23:24] it's not out of the storm beyond the
[1:23:27] storm
[1:23:28] because there's not going to be an after
[1:23:30] right the after is when we're
[1:23:32] raptured gone home yes
[1:23:35] either uh death kisses us or
[1:23:38] or a body changing a rapture that's the
[1:23:40] end of our that's the end of that
[1:23:42] part of that storm for us but brother
[1:23:44] man said because we've been lifted up
[1:23:46] from the things of the world
[1:23:48] and we ride right along with the world
[1:23:50] but we're above the world
[1:23:53] you see what he said we ride along right
[1:23:56] with the world
[1:23:57] because we live here we eat drink and we
[1:24:00] live in the society in all of
[1:24:02] uh but we are above the world
[1:24:05] the bride those that are born again
[1:24:07] filled with the holy spirit are above
[1:24:08] the world
[1:24:10] beyond you know how to use that verbiage
[1:24:12] again beyond the world
[1:24:13] amen beyond the storm that's where our
[1:24:16] lives should be
[1:24:18] past that pe we get so engrossed in all
[1:24:21] the things that's going on sometimes we
[1:24:23] fail to remember
[1:24:24] who we are and where we came from right
[1:24:28] and that's not in this we're pilgrims
[1:24:30] and strangers here this that is not of
[1:24:32] this world we are not of this world
[1:24:34] if you're born again and have the holy
[1:24:36] spirit brother adam said we are above
[1:24:38] the world
[1:24:38] beyond the world what did we read that
[1:24:40] quote last week he talked about
[1:24:42] his wife said well we're americans these
[1:24:44] old man no we're not americans
[1:24:46] amen we're christians we're pilgrims and
[1:24:49] strangers in a strange land
[1:24:53] we live and ride along with it my
[1:24:56] birthright as far as a human
[1:24:58] is a as an american as a united states
[1:25:01] citizen and that right can will never be
[1:25:05] taken from me
[1:25:06] but but as a citizen of above
[1:25:10] i have a different home i have a
[1:25:12] different place
[1:25:14] that i'm going to something that it it
[1:25:16] that anoints me that's beyond the world
[1:25:19] right beyond this mortal reach beyond
[1:25:21] this uh
[1:25:22] beyond this cosmos see that's where we
[1:25:25] live
[1:25:26] beyond the world amen that's what our
[1:25:28] life should be that's exactly
[1:25:30] where god wants us to be beyond the
[1:25:32] storm above it all
[1:25:33] now brother
[1:25:36] dennis mentioned this in his prayer and
[1:25:39] i had this
[1:25:40] down as a scripture i wanted to read to
[1:25:41] you second peter chapter three
[1:25:48] brother dennis quoted just a small
[1:25:50] portion of second peter
[1:25:52] chapter three but i want to read the
[1:25:54] whole i want to read the whole chapter
[1:25:56] amen second peter chapter 3.
[1:26:04] now we can talk for the next 10 15
[1:26:06] minutes and
[1:26:08] and hit highlights of things that we all
[1:26:11] know
[1:26:12] but bringing to our remembrance then
[1:26:15] what our
[1:26:16] beyond this is and and if you will even
[1:26:20] even we'll say after that after the
[1:26:22] storm after the storm
[1:26:23] that is affecting us that where we go to
[1:26:27] where
[1:26:27] what's happening to to this bride the
[1:26:30] second epistle
[1:26:31] beloved now i write unto you in both
[1:26:33] which i stir up your pure minds by the
[1:26:35] way of remembrance
[1:26:37] that you may be mindful of the words
[1:26:39] which were spoken before by the holy
[1:26:41] prophets and of the commandment of us
[1:26:42] the apostles
[1:26:44] of the lord and savior knowing this
[1:26:46] first that there shall
[1:26:48] come in the last day scoffers walking
[1:26:51] after their own lusts
[1:26:54] in this now he puts a first to this
[1:26:57] but then he said first in the last days
[1:27:00] first in the last days they'll be
[1:27:01] scoffers
[1:27:02] walking after their own lusts trying to
[1:27:06] develop lead uh produce
[1:27:09] something from their own mind from their
[1:27:11] own lust
[1:27:13] it's their own desires it's their own
[1:27:15] feelings
[1:27:16] well this is what i want to happen this
[1:27:18] is what i think should happen
[1:27:20] but the truth of it is in the grand
[1:27:24] scheme of thing
[1:27:25] in humanity they may be right
[1:27:29] you got conservatives and liberals and
[1:27:31] they have completely
[1:27:32] poor opposites of what their ideals are
[1:27:35] of what this nation should be like
[1:27:38] but our polar opposite even beyond that
[1:27:43] is the whole thing is satan's eating
[1:27:47] right and our world
[1:27:50] has no resemblance to this world at all
[1:27:55] because what it really should be is not
[1:27:58] after what i think it should be or what
[1:28:00] my opinion of it should be or what i
[1:28:02] would like for it to be
[1:28:04] of my humanity but what does the word
[1:28:07] say
[1:28:09] what does jesus say what does his word
[1:28:12] say
[1:28:12] that's all that matters that's all that
[1:28:14] it boils down to is all that it matters
[1:28:17] is is that word what christ what the
[1:28:19] mind of christ
[1:28:20] what he wants for it that that's that's
[1:28:23] the whole thing see
[1:28:24] all these cities and buildings and stuff
[1:28:26] we've become so uh
[1:28:28] citified around to see all these huge
[1:28:30] cities everywhere
[1:28:31] everybody's moved into the cities used
[1:28:33] to be all spread out and people
[1:28:34] uh enjoyed the land and lived on the
[1:28:36] land now everybody's just coming in
[1:28:38] and conglomerate one of these big huge
[1:28:40] cities everywhere you just got a big
[1:28:42] pocket of people here and a big pocket
[1:28:43] of people there and a big pocket of
[1:28:45] people there
[1:28:45] you got all this land people there where
[1:28:47] nobody hardly lives
[1:28:49] because everybody wants to be in these
[1:28:51] big huge pockets
[1:28:52] these big cities and god never did
[1:28:54] ordain those
[1:28:57] cities began to be built by cain not by
[1:29:00] god's lineage
[1:29:01] not by adam not by seth cities were
[1:29:05] being were built or built off the
[1:29:06] lineage of
[1:29:07] of cain right that's when they built
[1:29:11] cities
[1:29:12] cess lineage adam gods is when they
[1:29:15] begin to call on the name of the lord
[1:29:17] that's his lineage what does that do
[1:29:20] well calling on him leads us into his
[1:29:22] path
[1:29:22] right what does he want we know this was
[1:29:25] created by him and for him
[1:29:26] or if it's created for him and he's a
[1:29:28] creator of it then lord what would you
[1:29:30] want
[1:29:32] what would you want my part of it here
[1:29:34] to be right
[1:29:36] because that's what matters to me what
[1:29:38] is my part of it
[1:29:39] what is your part of it that's what you
[1:29:42] ask the lord every day
[1:29:43] what is my part of it here today lord
[1:29:45] what do you want me to do today
[1:29:46] where would you send me the people
[1:29:49] scoffers
[1:29:50] walking after their own lust saying
[1:29:51] where is the promise of his coming
[1:29:53] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:29:55] things continue as they were from the
[1:29:57] beginning of the creation
[1:29:58] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[1:30:01] that by the word of god the heavens were
[1:30:03] of old and the earth standing out of the
[1:30:05] water and in the water
[1:30:06] whereby the world that was then that
[1:30:09] then was
[1:30:10] being overflowed with water perished
[1:30:13] but the heavens and the earth which are
[1:30:15] now by the same water kept in store
[1:30:17] reserved unto fire against the day of
[1:30:19] judgment
[1:30:20] and perdition of ungodly men so we know
[1:30:22] what's going to happen to the current
[1:30:23] world
[1:30:24] right he's telling us what happened to
[1:30:26] the andaluvian world
[1:30:27] he's telling us what's going to be the
[1:30:29] end result of this world
[1:30:31] so what is the result
[1:30:34] it's to be reserved
[1:30:38] unto fire against the day of judgment to
[1:30:41] judge
[1:30:41] and uh and perdition of ungodly men
[1:30:44] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:30:46] thing that one day as the lord is a
[1:30:49] thousand years a thousand years is one
[1:30:50] day
[1:30:51] the lord is not slack concerning his
[1:30:53] promise as some men count slackness
[1:30:55] but is long-suffering to us we're not
[1:30:57] willing that any should perish but that
[1:30:59] all
[1:31:00] should come to repentance but the day
[1:31:02] and
[1:31:03] and merciful as it is amen
[1:31:06] merciful as it is seeing then
[1:31:11] uh excuse me but the day of the lord
[1:31:14] will not come
[1:31:15] but the day of the lord will come as a
[1:31:18] thief in the night in the which the
[1:31:19] heavens shall pass away with a great
[1:31:21] noise
[1:31:22] and the element shall melt with fervent
[1:31:24] heat the earth also
[1:31:25] and the works that are therein shall be
[1:31:27] burned up seeing then that all these
[1:31:29] things
[1:31:30] shall be dissolved what manner of
[1:31:32] persons
[1:31:33] ought we to be in all holy conversation
[1:31:36] and godliness
[1:31:38] for for if the sinner and the ungodly
[1:31:41] if the righteous scarcely be saved what
[1:31:43] are the sin and ungodly appear
[1:31:46] the righteous scarcely be saved amen
[1:31:49] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[1:31:51] of the day of god
[1:31:52] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[1:31:54] be dissolved the elements shall melt
[1:31:55] with fervent heat
[1:31:56] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:31:58] look for new heavens
[1:32:00] amen there we go amen that's that's
[1:32:02] where we're going beyond this
[1:32:04] after this we look for new heavens and
[1:32:07] new earth
[1:32:08] amen amen that's what we're looking for
[1:32:10] amen praise the lord
[1:32:13] wherein dwelleth righteousness
[1:32:16] so we can't be talking about here
[1:32:18] because there's no righteousness here
[1:32:19] right
[1:32:20] it's outside the bride anyway there's no
[1:32:22] righteousness in the world there's no
[1:32:23] righteousness in this world system
[1:32:24] cosmos there's no righteousness to it
[1:32:27] says obviously talk about
[1:32:28] a new heaven and a new earth a new place
[1:32:30] where righteousness is
[1:32:32] wherefore beloved seeing that we look
[1:32:35] for such things be diligent that you may
[1:32:37] be found in
[1:32:38] of him in peace without spot and
[1:32:41] blameless
[1:32:42] and account that the longsuffering of
[1:32:44] our lord is salvation
[1:32:45] even as our beloved brother paul also
[1:32:48] according to the wisdom given unto him
[1:32:50] hath written unto you as also in all his
[1:32:53] epistles speaking in them of these
[1:32:55] things in which we
[1:32:57] uh uh in which are some things hard to
[1:32:59] be understood
[1:33:00] which they that are unlearned and
[1:33:02] unstable rest and they do
[1:33:04] also the other scriptures unto their own
[1:33:06] destruction
[1:33:07] ye therefore beloved seeing ye know
[1:33:09] these things before
[1:33:11] beware lest ye also being led away with
[1:33:14] the error of the wicked
[1:33:15] fall from your own steadfastness but
[1:33:18] grow in grace and in the knowledge of
[1:33:20] our lord and savior jesus christ to him
[1:33:22] be glory
[1:33:23] both now and forever amen amen praise
[1:33:26] the lord
[1:33:27] so he talked about what the andaluvian
[1:33:28] world talked about the current world
[1:33:31] and then he talked about what we're
[1:33:32] looking forward to as we still
[1:33:34] living in this world right beyond
[1:33:38] the storm looking at what we know
[1:33:40] scripturally
[1:33:41] a new heavens and a new earth amen well
[1:33:44] how are we going to be able to live in
[1:33:45] that new heaven and new earth well we
[1:33:46] got to have a new body
[1:33:47] right we got we got to be new people we
[1:33:49] got to be new creations
[1:33:51] new creatures in christ jesus first
[1:33:53] corinthians 15
[1:33:55] 51 says behold i show you a mystery
[1:33:58] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[1:34:01] be
[1:34:01] changed it can't be talking about the
[1:34:04] unbeliever because the unbelievers
[1:34:06] aren't going to be changed
[1:34:07] that's right he's talking about all well
[1:34:09] what is that
[1:34:10] all believer all christian all spirit
[1:34:13] filled
[1:34:14] we shall all be changed in the moment
[1:34:16] and twinkling of an eye
[1:34:18] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:34:20] say the sound the dead in christ shall
[1:34:22] rise
[1:34:23] incorruptible and shall be changed for
[1:34:26] this corruptible must put on
[1:34:27] incorruption in this mortal must put on
[1:34:30] immortality
[1:34:31] beyond beyond friend amen
[1:34:35] amen so when this corruptible shall put

[1:35:46] you've heard the story about when he's
[1:35:47] on uh
[1:35:49] hurricane mountain i believe if i
[1:35:51] remember it's called colorado
[1:35:53] he that is in you i could be that i
[1:35:55] could have those details mixed up but
[1:35:57] the story he that is he tells the story
[1:35:59] several places
[1:36:00] but i wanted to read it to you amen
[1:36:04] he that is in you how many experiences
[1:36:07] have i had
[1:36:08] i pointed out out to the brothers
[1:36:10] brother palmer in them places
[1:36:12] where the eagle you know i've seen them
[1:36:13] rise up that day you know
[1:36:15] that the places where it all taken place
[1:36:18] in there
[1:36:19] it's a temporal a temperamental thing to
[1:36:21] me and there
[1:36:22] i've had so many great experiences with
[1:36:24] my lord up in those mountains
[1:36:27] so you just can't go there without
[1:36:28] seeing him he's just
[1:36:30] everywhere amen i set there then the
[1:36:32] sleet started
[1:36:34] the wind twisting like that and i said
[1:36:37] well
[1:36:38] i know the way down but i better get off
[1:36:40] of here right now
[1:36:42] so i looked down i couldn't even see the
[1:36:44] bottoms no more than clouds just
[1:36:46] whirling twisting
[1:36:47] sneak sleep blowing there it was the
[1:36:49] blizzard that was forecast for several
[1:36:52] days that a big blizzard was coming
[1:36:55] brother tom here not this tom tom
[1:36:59] simpson
[1:37:00] brother tom here brother tom simpson
[1:37:02] coming down from canada heard the
[1:37:03] forecast
[1:37:04] and he was advised not to go down to
[1:37:06] this part of the country
[1:37:08] because the forecast said it's going to
[1:37:09] be a blizzard where your brother tommy
[1:37:11] says i think that
[1:37:13] he said the blizzard was coming
[1:37:16] everybody
[1:37:16] had done set in for it well i put my gun
[1:37:19] under
[1:37:20] my shirt like this my red shirt like
[1:37:22] walking down the mountain
[1:37:23] i started i got about a half a mile from
[1:37:25] the saddle and oh my then big drops of
[1:37:27] snow like that
[1:37:29] wind twisting up in the mountain blowing
[1:37:31] i couldn't see the bottom no more i
[1:37:33] could see about 20 feet maybe 30 in
[1:37:35] front of me
[1:37:36] i know to come right down to this little
[1:37:38] what we call a little hog back
[1:37:41] little ridge should come off the creek
[1:37:42] and then i know to follow the creek
[1:37:44] and where to go if it got real bad and
[1:37:47] so then i started down and got about
[1:37:49] half the way down
[1:37:50] there was something said to me just as
[1:37:53] plain as you hear me
[1:37:55] stop and go back well i thought
[1:37:59] what was i thinking about maybe it's
[1:38:01] just my mind and i couldn't
[1:38:03] i couldn't mix it up another step
[1:38:05] forward david
[1:38:07] had fixed me a sandwich that morning and
[1:38:09] i tried i think he tried to even
[1:38:12] uh even with me for fixing his dad one
[1:38:14] one time of onion and honey
[1:38:16] ever had an onion honey salad i haven't
[1:38:19] either
[1:38:20] i don't plan to i guess if you're hungry
[1:38:23] and
[1:38:24] that's what you got that's what you do
[1:38:26] i've had onion and tomato
[1:38:28] marinated but never onion honey that's
[1:38:30] that's a new one
[1:38:31] that's all we had he said so he fixed me
[1:38:33] a baloney
[1:38:34] and i don't know what it was wrapped in
[1:38:37] there had it in my shirt a dunk on
[1:38:39] wet through my shirt i thought i'll just
[1:38:41] stop and eat this
[1:38:42] and it'll be all right then so i pulled
[1:38:44] out the sandwich about 10 o'clock and i
[1:38:45] started eating the sandwich
[1:38:47] and as i eat the sandwich i thought now
[1:38:49] i'll be all right
[1:38:50] and i started to move on but something
[1:38:52] said go back
[1:38:53] where you came from now again
[1:38:57] defying all logic defying all
[1:39:00] sensibility obeying a voice
[1:39:03] obeying a voice that's beyond our human
[1:39:05] understanding
[1:39:06] to go back into the teeth of the storm
[1:39:10] where he's trying to get out of right
[1:39:12] trying to come away from
[1:39:15] there on the boat screaming let's get
[1:39:18] out of this place
[1:39:19] and they see jesus coming in this and
[1:39:22] and peter decides he wants to get into
[1:39:24] the middle of the storm go right in
[1:39:26] where jesus
[1:39:27] is well the voice told brother branham
[1:39:30] go back
[1:39:31] well there's got to be a purpose to that
[1:39:34] what would be the purpose of
[1:39:36] of calling a prophet of god to go right
[1:39:39] back into the storm that was that would
[1:39:41] have killed him
[1:39:42] i mean legitimately i mean
[1:39:45] he talks about here we'll get into it
[1:39:48] just in the
[1:39:49] half hour or so it's no three inches
[1:39:52] i mean it's pouring snow a blizzard
[1:39:55] bring two three four
[1:39:56] five six feet of snow i mean he's a dead
[1:39:58] man
[1:39:59] to go back up there but the voice said
[1:40:01] go back
[1:40:02] right yeah that's living beyond the
[1:40:04] storm
[1:40:05] you're in the storm he's in the middle
[1:40:07] of the storm he said he's soaking wet
[1:40:10] he has to cover his gun to keep it from
[1:40:13] getting all wet
[1:40:15] and he's in the storm but he's living
[1:40:17] beyond the storm because the voice comes
[1:40:20] go back where you come from go back to
[1:40:23] that storm a half mile or more back up
[1:40:25] in the mountain
[1:40:25] into the dark timber where you can
[1:40:28] hardly see as far as that uh
[1:40:30] organ uh i don't know organ piano
[1:40:34] he's trying to make a comparison there
[1:40:35] which is kind of a hard one for us to do
[1:40:37] today but if you've been to the branham
[1:40:39] tabernacle you see the pulpit in the
[1:40:40] organ
[1:40:40] i had five feet six feet we'll say
[1:40:45] he said uh you could hardly see as far
[1:40:47] as that organ five six feet
[1:40:48] but i'm going to be an old man and i've
[1:40:51] been a christian now
[1:40:52] 35 years and i know no matter what how
[1:40:54] ridiculous it seems
[1:40:56] the mind of the lord do what the lord
[1:40:58] says yes
[1:41:00] amen that's that's the whole point of
[1:41:03] today's service
[1:41:04] amen living beyond this storm that's the
[1:41:06] whole point
[1:41:07] living beyond the storm is doing what
[1:41:10] jesus said
[1:41:11] living by the dictates of his word and
[1:41:14] if he speaks something to you personally
[1:41:17] amen do what the lord says and i turned
[1:41:21] and went back to the saddle feeling my
[1:41:23] way back all the sleep getting harder
[1:41:24] and harder getting darker and darker
[1:41:27] i sit down there and just put my coat up
[1:41:29] like this or my shirt over the scope
[1:41:31] again sit down
[1:41:32] i thought what am i doing here why would
[1:41:34] i come back
[1:41:35] up here and any normal human thinking
[1:41:38] person would think that
[1:41:40] any of us would if any of us even
[1:41:42] started going back up there
[1:41:45] but it'd have to be by faith amen and
[1:41:48] just by faith just like you think well
[1:41:49] why would peter call crawl off the bow
[1:41:51] of that boat
[1:41:52] because he had faith to believe he could
[1:41:53] walk to jesus right
[1:41:56] brother man i've heard that voice before
[1:41:58] that voice had talked to him many many
[1:42:00] many times and he knew when that voice
[1:42:02] spoke but you know how your mind is you
[1:42:04] know how the devil is
[1:42:05] the devil's in the middle of the storm
[1:42:07] too friend you have to understand the
[1:42:09] devil's in the middle of that storm too
[1:42:10] and he'll tell you all kinds of things
[1:42:11] to get you out
[1:42:12] away from what god's trying to get you
[1:42:14] to do right
[1:42:16] amen he said what am i doing up here
[1:42:20] i just have i just waited a few minutes
[1:42:23] and i started to get up again
[1:42:24] and just as plain as i'd ever want to
[1:42:26] hear a voice said i am the creator of
[1:42:29] heaven and earth
[1:42:30] i make the winds and the rain he said i
[1:42:33] took off my hat
[1:42:33] amen he said
[1:42:37] i said great jehovah is that you
[1:42:40] he said i was the one who made the winds
[1:42:42] to cease upon the sea
[1:42:44] amen i was the one who made the waves go
[1:42:48] down
[1:42:48] i created heaven and earth was not i the
[1:42:51] one
[1:42:52] that told you to speak those squirrels
[1:42:54] and they come into existence
[1:42:56] i am god now when a voice speaks to you
[1:43:00] listen now very closely now when a voice
[1:43:03] speaks to you
[1:43:04] watch the scripture if it's not
[1:43:06] scriptural
[1:43:08] leave it alone that's right he said i
[1:43:11] don't care how plain it is or what it
[1:43:13] says
[1:43:13] you stay away from it right amen
[1:43:17] that's that's the that's the guidewire
[1:43:20] that's the guideline
[1:43:21] is it scriptural right he said if it's
[1:43:23] not in the scripture
[1:43:25] leave it alone
[1:43:28] i said yes lord he said speak to those
[1:43:31] winds and storm and it'll go away
[1:43:34] now this bible lays before me which my
[1:43:36] life is in that i raised up i said i do
[1:43:39] not doubt your voice
[1:43:40] lord i said clouds snow
[1:43:43] rain sleet i rescind you your coming
[1:43:46] in the name of jesus christ go to your
[1:43:49] places
[1:43:51] and i said and i said that the sun must
[1:43:54] come out immediately
[1:43:56] and shine for four days till our
[1:43:58] brother's hunting trip
[1:43:59] is over and i'll leave with my brethren
[1:44:02] amen praise the lord i know a brother
[1:44:06] that was there
[1:44:07] at the time he's passed on since but he
[1:44:10] was a good brother good friend
[1:44:12] we stayed at their uh uh well in their
[1:44:15] yard
[1:44:16] in a travel trailer when we first moved
[1:44:17] to tucson arizona
[1:44:20] he still had the truck and camper that
[1:44:22] he used when he went up there hunting
[1:44:24] at this time with brother branham amen
[1:44:26] and he told me exactly the story too
[1:44:28] and he said now we brothers said all
[1:44:30] come down he said and they are all
[1:44:32] thinking man brother branham is just
[1:44:34] doomed up there
[1:44:35] because the whole mountain's just
[1:44:36] covered in the wind and snow and he's
[1:44:38] just pouring and it's piling up
[1:44:40] and then he said all of a sudden it just
[1:44:42] stopped the clouds went this way and
[1:44:45] this way and the sun came out and was
[1:44:47] out for four days solid
[1:44:50] amen amen now those brothers are going
[1:44:52] away
[1:44:53] and as those brothers go away others
[1:44:56] coughers come up
[1:44:57] right scoffers rise up and say oh this
[1:44:59] didn't happen
[1:45:01] oh this didn't happen that way oh look
[1:45:02] what brother branham said he contradicts
[1:45:04] himself
[1:45:06] amen scoffers
[1:45:10] i believe what he said even if i didn't
[1:45:13] have the eyewitness that i know
[1:45:14] personally i talked to was there
[1:45:16] and told me and he was very graphic and
[1:45:19] he was very emotional about it too
[1:45:22] he said it did exactly what brother
[1:45:24] brown said
[1:45:26] amen i was just gushing with the the
[1:45:29] wind was just gushing whoosh
[1:45:30] like that it started going whoosh whoosh
[1:45:33] and then it went few few and it
[1:45:34] stopped i can't uh
[1:45:39] give the graphics like brethren
[1:45:42] can but i try i stood still real still
[1:45:45] my brother uh up there and wondering
[1:45:47] what was happening the sleet rain
[1:45:49] stopped there come a wind whirling down
[1:45:51] through the mountains
[1:45:52] lifted up the clouds and one and one
[1:45:54] went this way
[1:45:55] east north west south and within a few
[1:45:57] minutes the sun was shining nice and
[1:46:00] warm he said that's the truth and god
[1:46:01] knows it's the truth
[1:46:03] i stood there just looking around my hat
[1:46:05] off
[1:46:06] i got numb all over i thought the very
[1:46:08] god of creation
[1:46:10] is all in his hands what he's telling me
[1:46:14] he said i picked up my gun wiped off the
[1:46:16] scope went and walked back down the hill
[1:46:18] and something said to me why don't you
[1:46:19] just stroll with me
[1:46:21] through this wilderness for a while amen
[1:46:23] just walk with me
[1:46:25] see god has a purpose yes god has a
[1:46:27] reason
[1:46:28] he'll stop all of nature just to perform
[1:46:32] what he wants to be done amen amen a
[1:46:35] blizzard that was gonna that would have
[1:46:36] destroyed them all
[1:46:38] stopped right there amen
[1:46:41] all of a sudden he said walk with me i
[1:46:44] said
[1:46:45] lord with all my heart that would be one
[1:46:47] of the greatest things i could do would
[1:46:49] be to walk with you
[1:46:50] so i put my gun on my shoulder i started
[1:46:52] walking through that never an axe laid
[1:46:54] to a tree in that virgin timber walking
[1:46:56] through there
[1:46:57] as i did i walked along down the game
[1:46:59] trails the goes on and tell the story
[1:47:01] but it's getting a little long if you
[1:47:03] want to go back and read it for yourself
[1:47:04] if you'd like to
[1:47:05] but i want to get to the end of this
[1:47:06] here he says even to uh when i come out
[1:47:09] of the mountains i stopped at filling
[1:47:11] stations and i said beautiful day
[1:47:13] three days later it never rained in that
[1:47:17] part of the country until the four days
[1:47:18] was over
[1:47:19] the sun shined every day
[1:47:23] is that right brethren he says they said
[1:47:25] amen
[1:47:27] not a cloud in the sky and i come out of
[1:47:29] the filling station
[1:47:30] i said sure beautiful day man says yes
[1:47:33] it is
[1:47:34] i said been awful dry said it the man
[1:47:37] said
[1:47:37] it's a strange thing the attendant said
[1:47:41] you know they told us it was going to be
[1:47:42] a great big glitch and all of a sudden
[1:47:44] it just stopped
[1:47:46] i come all down on new mexico line billy
[1:47:49] my uh
[1:47:50] and i my son went into a little place
[1:47:52] there that got some
[1:47:54] uh this morning left i said sure pretty
[1:47:57] day
[1:47:57] yes it is i said look uh look like
[1:48:00] you've been pretty dry yes it's been
[1:48:02] i said are you from here said no i'm
[1:48:04] from wisconsin somewhere
[1:48:06] said i've been out here about 20 years
[1:48:08] so i guess you could call it home
[1:48:10] i said uh you're a native then i guess
[1:48:13] so i said yes sir
[1:48:15] i said like looks like it's been awful
[1:48:18] dusty
[1:48:19] said you know the man said now the the
[1:48:22] attendant now god
[1:48:23] man says you know the strangest thing
[1:48:25] happened so we had a forecast that we
[1:48:28] was going to get a big blizzard a lot of
[1:48:30] snow
[1:48:30] and it actually started and then it just
[1:48:32] quit
[1:48:34] brother brown says you don't say
[1:48:38] you don't say just modest humble
[1:48:42] amen could have been somebody said well
[1:48:44] i did that right
[1:48:45] i called that to stop i called the storm
[1:48:47] to stop and cease
[1:48:48] you know that's what a lot of people try
[1:48:50] to do today yes self-promotion
[1:48:52] oh i'm the one that did i'm the one they
[1:48:54] call that what are they doing they're
[1:48:55] building themselves a platform
[1:48:57] they're not building jesus one they're
[1:48:59] leading people to themselves not to
[1:49:00] jesus but that wasn't brother branham
[1:49:02] brother branson said oh you don't say so
[1:49:05] really is that exactly how it happened
[1:49:07] amen but it happened exactly the way he
[1:49:10] said it would
[1:49:11] now the difference here you say well
[1:49:14] that's the example that was left
[1:49:16] what did brother branham do he just
[1:49:17] followed the example just like peter did
[1:49:20] brother branham wasn't jesus christ he
[1:49:22] just followed the example
[1:49:24] amen amen well is it that same example
[1:49:26] for us today yes
[1:49:28] when when jesus stood up he said storm
[1:49:31] stop
[1:49:32] when brother brown stood up he said in
[1:49:34] the name of jesus christ start to stop
[1:49:37] there's a difference there yes but he's
[1:49:39] just following the example
[1:49:41] brother adam was living beyond that
[1:49:44] actually
[1:49:44] tangible physical storm
[1:49:48] four days they stood there they lived
[1:49:50] there hunted
[1:49:52] in the beautiful sunshine four days
[1:49:55] brother adam got to walk with jesus
[1:49:57] amen we get to every day
[1:50:01] yes amen every day walk with him
[1:50:05] so when all this is going on friend we
[1:50:07] live beyond the storm
[1:50:09] our lives are beyond the storm beyond
[1:50:11] the storm we're looking for a new
[1:50:13] heavens and new earth that's our focus
[1:50:15] our focus is looking to a new heavens
[1:50:17] and a new earth amen
[1:50:18] not how pretty we can make this one but
[1:50:21] looking to a new heavens and new earth
[1:50:23] not the great kingdoms that we can build
[1:50:24] up here
