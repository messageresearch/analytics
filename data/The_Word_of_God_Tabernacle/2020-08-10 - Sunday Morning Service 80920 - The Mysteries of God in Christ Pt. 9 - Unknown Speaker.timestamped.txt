[11:40] may we play our part in it lord as we
[11:42] commit it to you and ask these blessings
[11:44] in these
[11:45] requests in the name of the lord jesus
[11:47] christ we pray
[11:48] amen amen god bless you today
[11:52] amen again welcome to our streaming
[11:54] service
[11:55] as you all know or as those most of you
[11:58] would know
[11:58] uh that we've been on the topic of the
[12:01] mysteries of god in christ
[12:03] uh we've been through part eight last
[12:05] week and of course we went through like
[12:07] four parts five parts i forget
[12:09] of god revealing himself to his people
[12:11] remember these three parts that we're
[12:13] going
[12:14] into now that brother brannan brought to
[12:16] us in christ the mystery of god revealed
[12:18] and the first thing
[12:19] was that god could reveal himself to his
[12:21] people and condemn sinned down from his
[12:24] almighty omnipotence into a way that we
[12:26] could receive him and
[12:28] he could come and live in us and and
[12:30] that second part of that now that we're
[12:32] getting into
[12:33] that we want to start today we'll start
[12:35] today
[12:36] maybe hit some of the highlights and get
[12:37] some of the foundation laid to really
[12:39] get into some of it lord willing
[12:41] the next couple of weeks but the next
[12:43] part of part two
[12:44] is god having the preeminence in his
[12:48] people
[12:48] and his bride uh you know the bible
[12:52] says that jesus came to uh to save his
[12:55] people
[12:56] uh and i believe that his people are
[12:58] here to be
[13:00] uh to do his will and to do his purpose
[13:02] and to do his bidding
[13:04] and that's the purpose of the
[13:05] preeminence that god put himself
[13:07] in our lives so this is uh god having
[13:11] the preeminence in his people this will
[13:13] be part one but this is the mysteries of
[13:15] god in christ
[13:16] part nine so as we go to the bible again
[13:19] we'll go back to revelation 10
[13:20] 7. read this as we understand this to be
[13:24] a latter day
[13:25] a scripture for us to read and
[13:29] was fulfilled or is being fulfilled
[13:32] through the prophet
[13:33] revelation 10 7 but in the days of the
[13:35] voice of the seventh angel
[13:37] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[13:40] of god
[13:41] should be finished as he had declared to
[13:43] his servants
[13:44] the prophets so we see in amos that the
[13:47] lord god surely does nothing except he
[13:49] revealed to his servants the prophets
[13:51] we see revelation 10 7 that this mystery
[13:54] would be finished
[13:55] that mystery that would be finished as
[13:58] he declared
[13:59] past tense to his servants prophets
[14:02] he'll do nothing less
[14:03] revealed to his prophet so that prophet
[14:05] then brings that word to a people
[14:08] that god could then reveal it to them we
[14:10] can't go
[14:11] on the misnomer which unfortunately
[14:13] seems a lot of people do
[14:15] that because brother branham preached
[14:17] something it's revealed
[14:18] it's only revealed to you when god
[14:20] reveals it to you
[14:22] now i believe that brother branham
[14:23] preached the truth and the revelation of
[14:25] it but it takes
[14:26] god to come and reveal it just because
[14:28] you've listened to a tape
[14:29] or read a book or got some kind of an
[14:31] understanding
[14:32] doesn't mean god's revealed something to
[14:35] you so that revelation is that in
[14:37] product of god
[14:39] showing himself to you see that
[14:41] three-step process of of uh
[14:45] repent be baptized and receive in the
[14:47] holy spirit
[14:48] uh that holy spirit brings us into that
[14:51] relationship
[14:51] and communion fellowship with the lord
[14:53] jesus talked a little bit about last
[14:55] week
[14:56] that we come into that fellowship in
[14:58] communion with the lord that god
[15:00] revealed himself to us
[15:02] well the prophets bring that truth that
[15:04] truth comes to us because remember faith
[15:06] comes by hearing
[15:08] and hearing the word of god so that word
[15:10] comes and we hear it
[15:12] but we don't just hear it with our ear
[15:14] those that receive the revelation it
[15:15] comes into our spirit into our soul
[15:18] and god reveals it to us in there what
[15:20] he'd have us to see and know
[15:22] it says things in the scripture we know
[15:24] that god just doesn't come out and say
[15:27] x y z black white god reveals it to his
[15:30] people god unfolds it god
[15:32] has mysteries in the bible how many
[15:34] times have been talked about mysteries
[15:36] through the scripture and mysteries
[15:38] being revealed this is just
[15:40] one of them but again this part here of
[15:43] the mystery of god now again we want to
[15:46] reiterate that
[15:48] mystery is jesus christ and who
[15:51] he is the godhead of god
[15:54] not some trinity not some second person
[15:57] the truth of the godhead and
[15:59] jesus in that godhead the son of god and
[16:02] god revealing himself the only way that
[16:05] god
[16:06] conned and sent down to live in us
[16:10] to bring a kinsmen redeemer so that it
[16:12] would bring the perfect sacrifice of
[16:14] kinmanship
[16:16] to annihilate sin away from us not just
[16:19] to cover it
[16:20] but to completely annihilate sin and to
[16:23] do away with it
[16:25] jesus come to take our place so that we
[16:28] could take his place
[16:30] so that we could be robed in his
[16:32] righteousness the word
[16:34] and that we would have no spot wrinkle
[16:36] or blemish
[16:37] there is no spot if you have your
[16:38] garment on it's got spots it's got
[16:40] wrinkles and blemishes if i have my
[16:42] garment
[16:43] it's all spotted wrinkled and blemished
[16:44] but if we have his
[16:46] garment this garment the word garment
[16:49] then that garment
[16:50] is without spot it's without wrinkle
[16:52] it's without blemish
[16:53] that's the purpose god having
[16:55] preeminence in his children now i want
[16:57] to read
[16:58] the scripture brother branham read and
[17:00] of course the one place that is in the
[17:02] new testament
[17:03] that brings this word to life so let's
[17:06] go to colossians
[17:07] i'm going to read the first chapter same
[17:10] place we had read
[17:12] in god unfolding himself because again
[17:14] i've mentioned this to you before
[17:16] that there's things that are all that
[17:18] overlap there's things that
[17:20] uh that bring the complete revelation of
[17:24] something and
[17:24] sometimes you hit that in those in in
[17:27] that series and in that
[17:29] part but it actually lats over into
[17:33] another part which then will lap over
[17:35] into another part which
[17:36] we'll do here um the second part of god
[17:39] having preeminence laughs right over
[17:42] into god restoring that kingdom back to
[17:44] his children
[17:45] amen because it couldn't have been
[17:46] restored unless that uh couldn't that
[17:48] kingdom had couldn't have been restored
[17:50] unless his children
[17:51] had received the preeminence of him so
[17:54] it every bit goes together but we read
[17:56] this scripture want to read it again
[17:58] we got into the preeminence and told you
[18:00] when we get back to this
[18:01] that we will read it in that part as
[18:03] well so
[18:05] we're starting first colossians chapter
[18:07] 1 verse 12.
[18:09] colossians chapter 1 verse 12. giving
[18:11] thanks unto the father which i hope that
[18:15] background there a little bit kind of
[18:16] helps refresh things to you
[18:19] but let's go on giving thanks unto the
[18:21] father which has made us
[18:23] meet to be partakers of the inheritance
[18:25] of the saints in light the inheritance
[18:28] of the saints
[18:30] i understand what is that inheritancy uh
[18:33] we might not get into the inheritance
[18:35] part today but that all plays a part in
[18:37] understanding
[18:38] who we are and that preeminence of
[18:40] christ in us see
[18:42] who hath delivered us this is beautiful
[18:44] see now who had delivered
[18:46] us from the power of darkness satan
[18:49] who's delivered us from satan's eden who
[18:52] has delivered us from all the devices of
[18:54] satan
[18:55] who has delivered us from all the
[18:57] diseases and the germs and the
[18:59] afflictions of satan
[19:00] can you say amen praise the lord
[19:04] delivered us what a time we live friend
[19:06] see
[19:07] delivered us from the power of darkness
[19:09] covet
[19:10] is a power of darkness that god has
[19:12] delivered us from
[19:14] amen and had translated us
[19:18] into the kingdom of his dear son now
[19:21] that translated means he has
[19:23] placed us from one place to another
[19:26] he has taken us from this place the born
[19:29] and sin shaped naked become the world
[19:30] speaking lives
[19:31] into a place of the light of the gospel
[19:34] of jesus christ or as he said here
[19:37] inheritance of the saint into the
[19:40] kingdom
[19:41] of his dear son praise the lord into
[19:44] that kingdom so
[19:45] we've been transferred from the power of
[19:48] darkness from this
[19:49] dark world into the light of jesus
[19:52] christ
[19:53] into the kingdom which we may probably
[19:56] read this scripture again when we get
[19:58] into the restoration of the kingdom
[20:00] and the kingdom of his dear son so where
[20:03] does his
[20:03] children where does god people set today
[20:08] you know we're earthly beings of course
[20:10] in this body but where do we sit
[20:13] you go back and read ephesians 2 it
[20:14] tells us that we are sitting in heavenly
[20:17] places
[20:18] in christ brother brown tells us that
[20:20] heavenly places
[20:21] is knowing your place in christ or the
[20:23] adoption
[20:24] the placement of god putting us in that
[20:28] body where we belong see that kingdom
[20:31] where we belong in a body there's every
[20:35] part that has to play
[20:36] we'll get into the body when we might
[20:38] get to the body today
[20:40] that body every part of it has a part to
[20:42] play in the body the ear has a part the
[20:45] eye has a part the toe has a part the
[20:46] finger has a part every
[20:48] every bit of the body has a part see and
[20:51] they all have their part to play and
[20:52] they're all important
[20:53] see they're all important so they all
[20:55] have that part when there's a kingdom
[20:58] you think about a king a king or a queen
[21:01] and a kingdom that king has
[21:04] uh a servants or that kingdom has has
[21:08] parts that get played in that kingdom
[21:10] see
[21:11] there there's there's different things
[21:12] there's there's cooks and there's
[21:14] servants
[21:15] there's people that watch after there's
[21:17] guards there's there's
[21:18] there's all the parts that have to be
[21:20] played see so that
[21:21] placement now is just it's just the
[21:24] simple father
[21:25] understanding of the adoption of god
[21:27] putting us in the body
[21:29] in his body in the kingdom of his dear
[21:32] son
[21:33] in whom in whom who his son
[21:37] jesus christ in whom we have redemption
[21:40] through his blood amen through his blood
[21:43] even the forgiveness of sins the blood
[21:46] now what was that blood
[21:47] that wasn't the blood of joseph it
[21:49] wasn't the blood of mary it wasn't the
[21:51] hemoglobin of a human
[21:52] it was the blood of god it was god's
[21:55] blood
[21:56] it was the blood of god coursing through
[21:58] the veins of his son jesus christ so
[22:01] that when that blood was shed
[22:03] the power of that blood to break the
[22:05] blood cell
[22:06] down to release god back to the people
[22:09] again
[22:10] to release that spirit to release
[22:14] god almighty jesus christ coming back
[22:17] into his children
[22:18] not just an anointing not just a spirit
[22:21] that falls on the people
[22:23] but an actual indwelling an actual
[22:26] spirit an actual literal jesus
[22:29] christ coming into the believer
[22:32] see it has to be that through that blood
[22:36] so he's redeemed us already talked about
[22:40] that redeemed
[22:41] from the power of darkness and
[22:44] translated or
[22:45] moved us from that power
[22:48] of satan's eden and darkness into
[22:51] the kingdom of his dear son now we've
[22:54] been placed in that kingdom
[22:56] play the part that god give us by the
[22:58] redemption
[22:59] through his blood the forgiveness of sin
[23:02] the forgiveness of sin no longer
[23:04] covering of sin but a forgiveness of sin
[23:05] an
[23:06] annihilation of sin blessed is the man
[23:09] to whom god
[23:10] does not impute sin god does not hold
[23:14] accountable
[23:15] that sin praise the lord so that's the
[23:19] that's the fulfillment of god allowing
[23:22] bringing that
[23:23] to pass in our lives the blood the
[23:26] forgiveness of sins
[23:29] who is jesus the image
[23:32] of the invisible god or the expression
[23:35] jesus we said that we went through that
[23:37] now
[23:38] the expression of the invisible god the
[23:41] firstborn of every creature
[23:43] for by him were all things created that
[23:46] are in heaven and within
[23:48] earth visible invisible whether it be
[23:50] thrones dominions principalities powers
[23:52] all things were created by him and for
[23:56] him
[23:56] again we described that went through
[23:58] that with god
[24:00] unfolding himself to his people
[24:02] revealing himself to his people
[24:04] see and he is jesus is
[24:07] before all things and by him all
[24:10] things stand i know it says consist you
[24:14] look in the greek
[24:15] same thing stand all those things stand
[24:18] today
[24:19] by the word of god by the power of god
[24:21] by the power of the spoken word through
[24:23] faith
[24:24] those things stand today just like they
[24:27] did when they were created
[24:29] amen and he is now listen we get to this
[24:32] now
[24:33] he is jesus is the head of the body
[24:38] the church the bride amen
[24:41] not a nominal church not just a
[24:45] church nominal or a church
[24:48] just uh uh that that believe
[24:51] on uh the the the things that are
[24:55] of the nominal world or the church world
[24:58] will just say the church world
[25:00] christendom
[25:02] would you say but a bride a bride a
[25:05] bride that god has
[25:06] that god has called to be his wife that
[25:10] god
[25:10] literally took out of the sight of jesus
[25:13] christ
[25:15] and the feminist into her to become the
[25:18] bride
[25:19] to jesus christ he is the head of that
[25:22] body
[25:24] the church who is the beginning again we
[25:26] go back to revelation 3 14 the beginning
[25:29] of the creation of god
[25:30] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[25:33] things
[25:34] he jesus might have the preeminence now
[25:38] remember
[25:39] what is this mystery of god this mystery
[25:42] that contains
[25:42] all the mysteries is jesus christ
[25:46] amen jesus christ that in all things
[25:50] amen all things he jesus
[25:53] might have the preeminence now that's
[25:56] only
[25:56] one place in the new testament that word
[25:58] is used preeminence
[26:00] you go and look in the greek it explains
[26:02] what it is very
[26:04] short detail because it's somewhat
[26:06] explained self-explanatory although
[26:08] we'll go into it in just a minute but
[26:09] it's the only place
[26:10] in the new testament that that is
[26:12] referred to or the only place in the
[26:14] greek that it's even
[26:16] referenced is that word right there
[26:18] preeminence
[26:20] all things he jesus might have the
[26:22] preeminence for it please the father
[26:25] that
[26:25] in him jesus should all the fullness
[26:29] dwell all the fullness of what not the
[26:31] fullness of me or you but the fullness
[26:33] of the godhead
[26:35] god almighty the fullness of the godhead
[26:37] dwelling in him
[26:39] amen once he was in moses once he was in
[26:43] enoch once he was in uh noah once he was
[26:46] in
[26:47] the different ones paul and down through
[26:49] the ages brother ham once he was in
[26:50] but through jesus christ he's
[26:53] come in the fullness the fullness of the
[26:56] godhead
[26:57] in jesus christ in him who
[27:00] is the head of the body and
[27:04] has the preeminence in all things
[27:08] all things now remember our topic here
[27:11] our topic or our sub topic if you will
[27:13] is
[27:14] having the preeminence in his believers
[27:17] in his people god having the preeminence
[27:20] in his bride
[27:22] see that's the whole thing here uh let
[27:24] me just read it to you
[27:25] can we just read it here out of christ
[27:27] the mystery of god revealed
[27:28] remember the first purpose now first
[27:31] purpose
[27:32] was that god wanted to reveal himself to
[27:35] his people
[27:36] amen right here christ in mystery god
[27:38] revealed
[27:39] secondly to have the preeminence
[27:43] in his body of believers amen
[27:46] that is his bride his bride
[27:50] his believers his bride secondly to have
[27:53] the preeminence in his body of believers
[27:56] that is
[27:56] his bride that he might live in his
[27:59] people
[28:00] now he could do that adam and eve but
[28:02] sin separated them so now there's
[28:04] a way to get back oh my he said let's
[28:06] talk about getting rich now see that
[28:08] second part though
[28:09] to have that preeminence in his body of
[28:12] believers so remember
[28:13] again the subtitle the subtopic we have
[28:16] here god having the preeminence
[28:18] in his body of believers so let's look
[28:20] at that word for a moment since it's
[28:22] only once in the new testament
[28:24] let's just look at it because it's not a
[28:26] word that people on an everyday basis
[28:28] usually use
[28:30] uh i i don't use it um
[28:33] but it it ha it's it's a root word and a
[28:36] prefix
[28:37] and you see the prefix is literally the
[28:39] word pre
[28:40] uh pre eminence we may know the the the
[28:43] two together the the two separate but
[28:45] the two together
[28:46] what they make up and the understanding
[28:48] of the definition of it
[28:50] um you would use let's just look at this
[28:53] pre
[28:55] the the prefix pre is to mean earlier
[28:59] prior to or before prior to
[29:02] earlier or before pre means before
[29:06] so if it's before then who was that
[29:09] that is before not just putting
[29:12] something
[29:13] uh to say before something else
[29:17] no no he was before period
[29:21] not a before this or before this time or
[29:24] before that no
[29:26] he is the before he's the alpha
[29:29] the beginning see alpha omega beginning
[29:32] ending
[29:32] he is the alpha so that beginning that
[29:35] pre
[29:36] we would say is the before we always say
[29:39] beginning he never had a beginning
[29:41] elo himself existing so he had never had
[29:44] a beginning
[29:44] but this is this pre is before so he's
[29:47] before
[29:49] all things by him all
[29:52] things consist and in all things he is
[29:56] to have the
[29:56] preeminence pre before amen
[30:00] so he's free now eminence is
[30:05] famed famed or recognized
[30:09] superiority famed
[30:12] which is you know broadly knowledged
[30:14] among people
[30:16] famed or recognized superiority
[30:20] in other words someone that is superior
[30:23] to you
[30:23] or someone who is superior to everyone
[30:26] else or someone who is superior
[30:28] to everything all things botany life
[30:32] animal life human life superior that's
[30:34] what this
[30:35] is fame will recognize superiority
[30:38] now you've probably heard the phrase and
[30:41] uh you've probably heard it used you
[30:43] probably never used it
[30:44] but people use the phrase when they get
[30:46] to someone like a
[30:47] king or even the pope they say your
[30:50] eminence
[30:51] or even someone even a cardinal or
[30:54] something in the catholic church
[30:55] something
[30:56] someone of a hierarchy in that church
[30:58] would would refer to that person as your
[31:00] imminence
[31:01] even if it's a higher position in a
[31:03] local
[31:05] church there catholic church they would
[31:08] refer to that person as your
[31:09] imminence see your imminence or someone
[31:12] who's feigned
[31:14] uh recognized superiority you are
[31:17] superior to me
[31:19] and that eminence is placing that person
[31:22] in a position that's
[31:23] above the rest of the people see that's
[31:26] why we never use that word
[31:28] that's why that word doesn't exist in
[31:30] our vocabulary especially when it comes
[31:32] to church
[31:32] because there is no such thing as
[31:35] imminence
[31:36] or your imminence the only imminent one
[31:39] that
[31:39] has imminence over or superiority over
[31:42] is god
[31:44] no no minister no pastor no preacher i
[31:46] don't care how well known he is i don't
[31:48] care how big his church is or how much
[31:50] money they get in
[31:51] there is no one that is over or above or
[31:54] superior
[31:54] to the other we are all a part of this
[31:57] in together as the body of christ
[32:00] amen as the body of christ he's the head
[32:03] we're the body remember the head he's
[32:05] the we just read
[32:06] him being the head he's the head we're
[32:08] the body
[32:09] so that body has its own position in
[32:12] place now you say well
[32:13] take the heart out you die and cut the
[32:15] peeky off and live that is true
[32:17] but the pinky plays a very important
[32:19] role god wouldn't put it there
[32:21] the pinky toe or or whatever part of the
[32:23] body it might be
[32:24] every bit of it but that doesn't mean
[32:27] that the
[32:28] that the heart is more imminent than the
[32:31] toe
[32:31] the toes part of the body just like the
[32:33] heart is
[32:34] just like any other vital organ the
[32:36] liver or whatever lungs
[32:38] their vital organs are called vital
[32:40] because we need them to live but
[32:42] we don't need the pinky toe to lift but
[32:44] it's still a part of the body
[32:45] it's not a lesser part of the body it's
[32:47] just much a part of the body
[32:50] let's just say this without the pinky
[32:52] toe yeah you can live but is your body
[32:54] complete
[32:55] body's not complete without the pinky
[32:57] toe it's not complete without the pinky
[32:59] finger
[33:00] and we're not jesus christ isn't coming
[33:02] for a deformed body
[33:05] so how important is it that the pinky
[33:07] toe be the pinky toe
[33:08] and be right where it is to serve its
[33:10] purpose it's just as important as
[33:12] anything
[33:14] because if god's coming back for this
[33:16] body he's coming back for an entire
[33:18] complete
[33:20] body one complete unit not something
[33:23] that's deformed
[33:24] not something that's missing this that
[33:25] or the other no so that makes
[33:27] so if the pinky's not there where it's
[33:29] supposed to be he's not coming to get
[33:31] the body
[33:32] so now how important is it it's it's of
[33:35] the most important so there's no
[33:37] imminence there's no one that has the
[33:39] superiority
[33:40] but you hear that word you may have
[33:42] heard it or used as your imminence
[33:44] before there's no your imminence but if
[33:47] you look at the word imminence
[33:49] and you see the superiority part you
[33:51] understand there's one that
[33:53] is superior and that is god god is the
[33:57] only superior one
[33:58] so when you put preeminence together as
[34:01] this word is
[34:02] it says before
[34:05] superiority he is before all things
[34:09] and he is superior to all things and
[34:13] in that god will have number one
[34:16] place or not at all in all things
[34:20] he is to have humanists animal life
[34:22] bought me life now human life
[34:24] we have a soul so we have a choice we
[34:27] have a decision
[34:28] we decide animal life doesn't body life
[34:31] doesn't they are just what they are as
[34:32] god has created them but
[34:34] humans we have thinking we have
[34:36] expression we have free will we have
[34:38] decision
[34:39] making and our decisions shape
[34:43] who we are and what we are so that
[34:45] decision that we choose
[34:47] him as our preeminence makes the
[34:50] difference in what god is looking for
[34:53] god's not looking for the body life that
[34:55] just obeys him and does whatever he says
[34:57] with the animal life but he's looking
[34:58] for someone of their own free will
[35:02] god wants someone of their own desire of
[35:04] their own free will of their own
[35:06] choosing to choose him as their
[35:10] preeminent superiority over them
[35:13] and anything else in the world or
[35:15] anybody else in the world
[35:18] he is number one he's going to be number
[35:20] one
[35:21] before all things superior to all things
[35:24] he is the preeminent
[35:26] notice preeminence if you want to look
[35:29] it up in the greek now
[35:30] together is superiority or to be
[35:34] first preeminence to be first
[35:37] or hold now i like the way this was
[35:40] worded so listen this real close
[35:42] at first i thought well that's a strange
[35:43] way to say that but then when i said it
[35:45] a couple of times to myself
[35:46] i thought that's perfect and what it
[35:49] says is
[35:50] hold the first place that sounded
[35:53] strange to me at first you think well
[35:55] hold the
[35:56] whole first place you think well they
[35:57] hold first place now
[35:59] hold the first place
[36:02] you say it a couple of times or as my
[36:04] expressiveness come to you you can see
[36:07] what a difference that makes with that
[36:08] little three letter v in there
[36:10] it says hold the first place i even put
[36:14] it in
[36:15] uh higher case letters so that it stand
[36:18] out even to me as i'm reading this to
[36:20] you hold
[36:21] the first place so you understand
[36:24] there's not a
[36:25] this person's first this person's first
[36:27] note he holds
[36:28] the first place in your life that's the
[36:30] preeminence in
[36:31] all things he to have that
[36:34] preeminence that the first place
[36:38] not a first place the first place
[36:41] because without that
[36:43] and everything else is is uh subject to
[36:46] that
[36:47] everything else is below that he is
[36:50] before
[36:50] superior and has the preeminence as the
[36:53] head
[36:54] the head of the body the preeminence in
[36:57] the bride
[36:58] now that's where god wants to be that's
[37:00] where god's going to be in the bride
[37:02] because that's the only place that he's
[37:04] going to be see is that preeminent that
[37:06] first place
[37:07] i don't believe honestly that if
[37:10] if you know we're baptized and baptism
[37:13] is good we need to be baptized that's
[37:15] fine but that doesn't save you baptism
[37:17] does not save you
[37:18] but when that's just showing the world
[37:20] and your expression to the world and to
[37:22] god
[37:23] that you've accepted him as your savior
[37:25] as your personal savior that's
[37:26] you say i choose you lord but see the
[37:30] heart has to be right that's just an
[37:31] action that you can do
[37:33] see if if the repentance isn't sincere
[37:36] and if your heart is not in the right
[37:38] place
[37:39] to have him first then you're just going
[37:42] down a
[37:42] drive center and coming up a wet one
[37:44] it's not making any difference
[37:46] but see once that preeminence in your
[37:49] heart is coming
[37:50] god recognizes that not just by baptism
[37:53] but he recognizes that by you and your
[37:56] life and your spirit
[37:57] and and your heart because god judges
[37:59] the man by the heart
[38:01] so when he sees that heart and he
[38:02] recognizes that
[38:04] preeminent position that you put him in
[38:07] in your life
[38:08] that to me is when that spirit comes and
[38:10] lives in you
[38:12] that's when you are born again that's
[38:14] when the person of jesus christ comes
[38:17] and sets your soul is his residence
[38:21] at that time because god knows
[38:24] god knows your heart not just because of
[38:25] an outward expression
[38:27] that's just a part of it not because of
[38:29] that but because in your heart you've
[38:31] made that decision or that placement
[38:34] that you're going to put god first in
[38:37] everything
[38:38] in everything of your life and
[38:40] everything about you
[38:42] he is going to have the preeminence amen
[38:45] how many places in the bible jesus talks
[38:47] about
[38:48] unless you neglect father mother sister
[38:50] brother family all this
[38:52] and take up your cross and follow me
[38:53] you're not worthy
[38:55] to be called my disciple because she's
[38:57] gonna have preeminence
[38:59] now that's not to say that you're gonna
[39:01] hate your mom or daddy
[39:02] literally hate them or your wife your
[39:04] spouse or your
[39:05] brother sister siblings whatever no he's
[39:08] not saying that but he's saying he's
[39:09] gonna be first or he's not gonna be at
[39:11] all
[39:12] see that's the preeminence now that
[39:14] preeminence is
[39:15] there so that god could then begin to
[39:18] express
[39:19] himself in ways that he never was able
[39:22] to do
[39:22] through the generations of time from the
[39:24] time
[39:26] in the garden of eden and we can we
[39:28] could go right back to the garden of
[39:29] eden now
[39:30] and you go right back to the garden of
[39:32] eden and you see the preeminence that
[39:34] god had in adam
[39:36] the preeminence that god had in all
[39:38] nature
[39:39] in the body life and animal life all
[39:41] nature because remember it's going to be
[39:42] all things not just the bride
[39:44] but in all things because all the
[39:47] fullness of the godhead dwell in him
[39:49] in jesus christ so when you go back to
[39:52] that and you see that expression
[39:54] that god had now jesus came as the
[39:57] expression of the invisible god
[39:59] but he came that way because fall in the
[40:01] garden of eden there hadn't been never
[40:02] been a fall that expression
[40:04] would have continued to unfold and exist
[40:06] in each one of us
[40:08] through adam down through the spoken
[40:10] word being of god's creation
[40:12] of his people upon this planet to live
[40:15] in the harmony and the perfection that
[40:17] god created the garden of eden
[40:19] that was god's purpose that was his plan
[40:21] that's the way it was supposed to be
[40:23] but see when paul entered in and sin
[40:25] entered in the camp
[40:26] then there had to be a substitute there
[40:29] had to be a a way to
[40:30] circumvent that and come back around to
[40:33] where
[40:34] god can begin to then express himself in
[40:37] the way that he had intended through
[40:39] down to the generations of time now you
[40:42] can see in the scripture
[40:45] if god reveals his word to you you can
[40:47] see in the scripture we've gone through
[40:49] some of it
[40:50] and you can you can find those pockets
[40:52] of things in there where god
[40:54] expressed himself the best he could to
[40:56] those men and women of those
[40:58] of that day but it could not be any
[41:01] fullness until jesus christ come god
[41:05] in the womb of a woman to express
[41:07] himself through that
[41:09] one man to where he can place his
[41:11] entirety of the godhead into
[41:14] that one jesus christ not a second
[41:16] person of a trinity but
[41:18] the almighty almighty god you want to
[41:22] question whether he was the almighty god
[41:23] go ask isaiah 9 and see if he tells you
[41:26] whether he's almighty god
[41:28] see the scriptures got to run in perfect
[41:30] continuity all that had to come together
[41:32] so now he can have the preeminence
[41:35] and live in his people to express that
[41:38] so the expression of that could come
[41:41] forth
[41:42] now there was a time see when when
[41:45] when we know and i've read the quote i
[41:48] won't read it again today
[41:50] where where brother brown talks about
[41:52] when eve
[41:53] left her mate adam she left the word
[41:58] when she left the words she got in
[42:00] trouble
[42:01] she got into the place that she could be
[42:04] uh
[42:05] manipulated and she could get to
[42:08] to begin to doubt and when that
[42:12] when that doubt came in and she fell
[42:15] into that doubt
[42:17] and then she of course brought her
[42:18] husband in which uh which he partook of
[42:21] again expressing the life of christ
[42:23] going to get his bride going into sin to
[42:26] get his bride
[42:27] then that creation that god had created
[42:29] there fell now not just adam and evil
[42:32] but all of creation
[42:33] fell why because adam was a minor
[42:37] amateur god of this earth he could speak
[42:39] names say he could do whatever he wanted
[42:41] to do see
[42:42] so if he was in control of this and by
[42:45] him
[42:46] the head at that time of this world fell
[42:48] then
[42:49] everything under him fell oh my
[42:53] just think about that i read something
[42:54] this morning let me just give you this
[42:56] little tidbit i read something this
[42:57] morning
[42:59] and it was outstanding i thought of it
[43:01] from time to time but never expressed to
[43:03] me quite in this way but
[43:04] uh someone had said um
[43:07] someone had said or i read it they said
[43:10] you know
[43:11] years and years ago and it's been many
[43:13] years i didn't research it or have time
[43:14] to look it up but many years ago
[43:17] they took bible and prayer out of our
[43:19] schools
[43:20] many years ago i don't know 50 60 70 i
[43:22] don't remember how it's been a long time
[43:25] and you know back in the day and even as
[43:27] i was coming up as a young man
[43:30] they begin to say and talk among
[43:32] themselves and christians
[43:34] begin to question what is going to
[43:36] become of our nation now what is going
[43:38] to happen
[43:38] to our youth how is our educational
[43:41] system going to come
[43:42] forth now now that god has been rejected
[43:46] out of our children's lives in education
[43:48] what's going to happen to this country
[43:52] well i think we can look up today and
[43:55] look at everything that's going on and
[43:56] get the answer they might not have known
[43:59] 50 60 70 years ago whenever it was
[44:02] and when they took it out what was going
[44:03] to happen but you can look at this
[44:05] nation today and you can find out and
[44:07] see exactly
[44:08] what has happened see when that one
[44:11] thing was removed
[44:13] everything else crumbled beneath it
[44:16] because it had no foundation it had no
[44:18] stability
[44:19] it had nothing to hold it then when adam
[44:21] fell
[44:22] everything else fell with it everything
[44:26] else come into that same
[44:27] fallen condition it was never a a
[44:31] lion never ate a an animal or a lamb or
[44:35] something
[44:36] those things didn't happen they loved
[44:38] each other the the the lion and the lamb
[44:40] laid down together
[44:42] but see when the fall came then then all
[44:44] that went with
[44:45] it everything else fell with it see it
[44:48] was that one thing but now when she
[44:50] but let's get back to this point when
[44:52] she the woman
[44:54] left adam she left her mate she left the
[44:57] word
[44:58] when she left the word that's when she
[45:00] fell now he talked about
[45:02] you know the church denomination or when
[45:05] you leave the word
[45:07] you lead jesus christ you leave jesus
[45:09] christ the word
[45:10] then your foundation is gone that's what
[45:14] happened to even that's what happened in
[45:15] the beginning
[45:17] but i want you to understand something
[45:18] now that this eve this second eve this
[45:21] bride this last day when she has
[45:24] come up and risen up to the point that
[45:27] she
[45:28] not only uh is the bride of jesus christ
[45:32] as
[45:33] eve was the bride to adam but she has
[45:37] literally because of christ's coming and
[45:39] the condescension of him revealing
[45:41] himself to his people
[45:43] coming and having the preeminence in her
[45:46] she
[45:46] is now cannot fall she cannot leave the
[45:50] word
[45:51] because she has become the word she has
[45:54] become the word
[45:56] because she was literally taken from the
[45:58] side of jesus christ
[46:00] who is the word and now lives
[46:03] in her the word so now she
[46:06] is the word and she cannot fall from the
[46:08] word because that's who she is
[46:11] so this bride this last day will
[46:14] accomplish
[46:15] and become and be the expression that
[46:18] jesus christ
[46:19] through him that god has always wanted
[46:22] to express
[46:23] because of the preeminence that god has
[46:25] in her
[46:26] she the word that expression
[46:30] is now expressing through her through
[46:33] her
[46:34] god manifesting himself through her
[46:36] friend if we can't understand
[46:38] see the part that we play of what god's
[46:40] doing in this last day
[46:41] that we really need to be born again
[46:44] well we really need a revelation of this
[46:47] word of
[46:48] of this word in us and who we are in it
[46:51] remember we read philippians last week
[46:54] chapter 2 that god morphed himself
[46:57] god changing his mask god plain from one
[47:01] part to the next part to the next part
[47:03] but the same god
[47:04] all the time well what do you think he
[47:07] does to us
[47:08] see that form of changing
[47:11] that form of putting on a different mass
[47:14] just helps us
[47:16] evolve into the place that we're at and
[47:18] who we understand
[47:19] that he took upon himself the form of a
[47:22] servant who are we
[47:23] that we morph from the person that we
[47:27] were
[47:27] what we were born as into the glorious
[47:30] light of jesus christ in the kingdom of
[47:32] god
[47:33] in his kingdom we read saint john
[47:36] chapter 1 verse 12
[47:37] or 14 that that we that he is give us
[47:41] the power
[47:42] to become sons and daughters of god why
[47:45] did he give us the power to become sons
[47:48] and daughters of god so he could have
[47:49] the preeminence
[47:51] in us to have the first place
[47:54] in us to come and live in us
[47:57] so that he could express himself through
[48:00] us to the rest of this world amen
[48:04] through the rest to the rest of this
[48:05] world that's what our prayer
[48:07] that's a part of the purpose that we
[48:08] have here our only purpose is to express
[48:11] jesus christ how can you express jesus
[48:14] christ if you don't know who jesus
[48:16] christ
[48:16] is that's why he is the mysteries or the
[48:20] mystery of
[48:20] god that is finished because in him is
[48:23] the expression of those mysteries
[48:25] the word that come forth the word that
[48:28] literally
[48:29] uh expresses itself through the body of
[48:32] believers today called lebron
[48:34] that's who we are in him we are that
[48:37] bride
[48:38] look here now christ the mystery of god
[48:42] revealed
[48:43] he said where once we mention this
[48:45] briefly see he said now where once moses
[48:48] had him partly david had him
[48:51] but here amen here
[48:54] as we express him today to you and as we
[48:57] see in the word
[48:59] he is manifested in the fullness
[49:03] praise the lord how could he express
[49:05] himself in the
[49:06] fullness being only a part of that
[49:10] trinity
[49:13] can't do it so what have you done now
[49:16] if you believe there's three gods you've
[49:18] completely taken
[49:20] the bible out of context it doesn't work
[49:23] anymore
[49:24] because for him to have the fullness he
[49:27] has to be the fullness
[49:29] and for him to be the fullness he has to
[49:31] be god
[49:33] because god is the fullness if you only
[49:35] have part of him here or part of him
[49:37] here a part of him here
[49:38] or he's part of him is in the holy ghost
[49:40] or part of him is in the father or part
[49:42] of
[49:43] then then you just chop god up and
[49:45] there's no where does that fullness come
[49:47] the fullness comes because he's one
[49:50] jesus christ the fullness he is
[49:52] manifested
[49:54] in the fullness deity himself standing
[49:57] on the earth
[49:59] god in his fullness to die for the sin
[50:01] of the people that he might bring to his
[50:04] church
[50:04] a sanctified life that he might have the
[50:08] preeminence
[50:09] in fullness in his church
[50:12] his bride to manifest listen now
[50:16] to manifest is our part he's talking
[50:19] about us here now so
[50:21] listen to what he who what we're doing
[50:24] now
[50:24] to manifest every promise
[50:28] in these last days that he promised
[50:31] for these last days who is he doing it
[50:34] through
[50:35] you say oh brother branham yeah yeah it
[50:38] it part of it came through brother
[50:39] brandon brother
[50:40] brown did his part brother bannon was
[50:42] adopted into the family and he did
[50:43] exactly the part that god told him to do
[50:46] when he was done god took him what about
[50:48] your part
[50:50] do you not think your part is as
[50:52] important as brother brown's part
[50:54] do you not think you're as important in
[50:55] the body of christ as he
[50:57] is do you not think in the sonship of
[51:00] jesus christ
[51:00] you mean as much to god as brother
[51:02] branham did
[51:04] well if you don't think you do friend
[51:06] then you again
[51:08] you need a revelation because that's
[51:11] just the part of it
[51:12] the fullness of that is in the body of
[51:15] believers
[51:16] the bride we are all a part of the body
[51:20] we all make up the body brother adam is
[51:22] a part of that body
[51:23] he makes up a part of that body just
[51:25] like you make up a part of that body
[51:27] and god is here to have and manifest
[51:31] to have the fullness to manifest
[51:34] every promise in these last days that he
[51:37] promised for these last days
[51:39] praise the lord god using his bride
[51:43] revealing through his bride who he is so
[51:45] that in this
[51:46] last day he manifests himself see
[51:50] he i hope you see now world these
[51:52] mysteries of plural
[51:53] are the mysteries remember our title is
[51:56] the mysteries
[51:58] of god in christ they're in christ i
[52:00] hope you see now for these mysteries
[52:03] plural come from not just
[52:06] revelation 10 7 the mystery of god the
[52:09] mystery of god finished jesus christ
[52:11] in jesus christ is these mysteries oh i
[52:14] hope that helps us understand now
[52:16] and and the placement of who we are in
[52:18] that
[52:19] let's read this description here real
[52:21] quick just two just two
[52:23] uh verses we'll close here in just a
[52:25] minute but colossians chapter two now
[52:27] so i have to go far we're just in
[52:28] colossians one go to colossians 2.
[52:31] we already read colossians 1 uh 19
[52:34] it said for it please the father that in
[52:36] him christ should
[52:38] all fullness dwell in colossians 2
[52:41] 9 it says for in him jesus christ
[52:45] dwelleth
[52:46] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[52:51] now again i've told you before i love
[52:52] that word all it's all inclusive it's
[52:55] it it covers every bit of it all means
[52:58] all it doesn't mean that the little
[53:00] piece is hanging out here or a little
[53:01] part out here that's not
[53:03] or something like that not all is all if
[53:05] it's all it's all it means everything so
[53:08] every bit of the godhead
[53:12] bodily was in jesus christ all the
[53:15] fullness
[53:16] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[53:19] now look what the tenth verse says
[53:21] though now and you
[53:23] ye are complete
[53:27] in him i'll praise the lord which is the
[53:29] head of all principality and power now
[53:31] what is complete
[53:33] what does it mean to be complete when
[53:35] something's complete
[53:37] let's you know this just kind of my mind
[53:40] my mom used to love doing puzzles
[53:42] and you know she put those puzzles
[53:44] together and i mean she can do
[53:46] thousands of pieces of puzzle and put
[53:49] that puzzle together
[53:51] and as you're doing the puzzle the
[53:52] picture starts coming
[53:54] clearer and clearer and you can look at
[53:56] the box but you're not really something
[53:58] when you look at the box but
[53:59] when that puzzle because piece by piece
[54:02] you're putting it together
[54:04] and as you put each piece in it becomes
[54:07] clearer and clearer and you look at it
[54:08] you think mine is looking more and more
[54:10] like the box
[54:11] it's looking more more like the picture
[54:13] on the box and and you keep putting
[54:15] pieces in you keep putting pieces in
[54:17] and pretty soon you put that last piece
[54:19] in and it completes the entire picture
[54:22] the entire picture then comes in plain
[54:25] view
[54:26] because you took every piece and you
[54:29] place it in together
[54:31] now the picture is complete
[54:34] if you're missing one piece the
[54:37] picture's not complete
[54:39] i mean there might be a little bird in
[54:40] that in that piece you're missing
[54:43] there might be a little tractor or there
[54:45] might be a
[54:46] a some food or something on a table
[54:50] there might be some very important in
[54:52] that one piece so you understand it
[54:54] might just be a leaf
[54:55] but the picture is not complete
[54:58] until every single piece is in its place
[55:02] and when every piece is in its place
[55:04] it's complete
[55:06] well if you take that word complete and
[55:09] and
[55:10] and you go back to understanding when
[55:12] when
[55:13] jesus talks about us being perfect
[55:16] he doesn't mean sinless but he means
[55:18] complete
[55:20] he means a full age grown up
[55:23] mature or again complete
[55:27] well how are we complete we're complete
[55:30] because we are in him
[55:34] let me read it again ye are complete
[55:38] in him amen
[55:41] not just him and me but me in him
[55:44] i'm complete in him which is the head
[55:47] again
[55:48] the head of all principality and power
[55:52] all things he has the preeminence
[55:55] in him dwelleth all the
[55:58] fullness of the godhead bodily and now
[56:01] we are complete
[56:03] we are complete in him the picture has
[56:06] been
[56:07] filled the last piece has been placed
[56:10] the puzzle now matches the picture
[56:14] the vision has now come into plain view
[56:17] and you can see what it was meant to be
[56:19] the whole time
[56:21] now i set up my lighting in here so
[56:22] there's no shadowing so it's pretty hard
[56:24] to do hers understand this
[56:26] but if you got a shadow and you come
[56:28] closer and closer you can see where the
[56:30] light comes in
[56:31] and when the shadow you just look and
[56:33] see well that's just a shadow you don't
[56:35] know for sure but you think it looks
[56:36] like a hand
[56:37] but the closer you get to it the more it
[56:39] comes into plain view then you realize
[56:41] wow that is a hand or when the picture
[56:44] when the picture comes into plain view
[56:48] and it's complete then you can see what
[56:50] it really is
[56:52] and what it really is is nothing more
[56:54] than him
[56:55] it's nothing more than him it's us in
[56:58] him the only way it can be that way
[57:02] is if he has the preeminence in us
[57:06] he lives in us he has
[57:09] a rule and reign over our lives one more
[57:13] point i want to make
[57:15] uh maybe i read this scripture or this
[57:17] quote uh
[57:18] here i had one more quote i was going to
[57:20] read
[57:22] um but we'll see how did you really get
[57:26] to that part we'll do that next time
[57:27] lord willing
[57:28] but i want to take one more moment
[57:32] because people today churches are full
[57:35] people call themselves christians the
[57:37] word christian the
[57:39] the office or the the
[57:42] denotation or designation of christian
[57:48] is used very widely today
[57:51] a lot of people claim to be christians
[57:53] and i'm not going to claim
[57:54] their experiences wrong that's their
[57:56] experience that's up to them
[57:58] if they if they are really christians
[58:00] and it'll bear itself
[58:02] out that there will really be christians
[58:03] but it's it's quite a word that's being
[58:05] used
[58:07] but when when we accept let's look at
[58:10] this a minute
[58:11] we'll go back to the imminence
[58:13] preeminence
[58:14] superiority when you think about
[58:17] someone having superiority over you when
[58:20] you think about there being
[58:23] uh god will say the the deity
[58:26] the almighty the omnipotent the elohim
[58:30] superiority preeminence over
[58:33] body believers that places that body of
[58:37] believers in a certain position
[58:40] that position i believe is the place
[58:42] where brother branham said
[58:43] this project gets to understand that
[58:45] that this rapture will take place
[58:47] don't think with that far away from that
[58:50] uh
[58:50] sometimes it looks like we're a million
[58:52] miles from it but the truth of it is i
[58:54] believe
[58:55] we're very close to that we see time
[58:56] winding up as we see things happening
[58:58] but
[58:59] nevertheless but the thing is not just
[59:02] to say i'm a christian it's not just to
[59:04] say i've accepted jesus as my savior
[59:07] when you say that you've accepted jesus
[59:10] as your savior
[59:11] there's a word that a lot of times
[59:13] people don't bring
[59:15] into that that helps understand what
[59:18] that means
[59:19] and that word is l-o-r-d
[59:22] lord he is our lord
[59:25] and savior he's not just our savior
[59:28] people say well i accept him as my
[59:29] savior that's fine
[59:30] but is he your lord see a bigger thing
[59:34] in life
[59:34] is not just saying he's my savior but is
[59:37] he your lord
[59:38] if he's your lord then that means he has
[59:42] preeminence over you that means he is
[59:45] lord over you he is lord
[59:48] over your life he is lord over your
[59:51] direction
[59:52] over your actions over everything you do
[59:54] say where you go
[59:56] everything about you that's why god
[59:58] calls and demands for
[1:00:00] holiness from his children because he is
[1:00:03] our
[1:00:03] lord he lords over us
[1:00:07] amen he's our lord if he's not your lord
[1:00:10] then he's not anything to you amen you
[1:00:13] say he's my savior but he's not going to
[1:00:15] be your savior
[1:00:17] unless he is your lord unless he has
[1:00:20] that preeminence
[1:00:21] unless he has that first place he's not
[1:00:24] going to be your lord
[1:00:25] and people walk around and live and act
[1:00:28] and do any way they want to
[1:00:30] and say that he's their lord disobey the
[1:00:34] word
[1:00:35] live act and dress up in indifference
[1:00:38] to god's word and say he's your lord
[1:00:42] talk and go places and do things that
[1:00:44] that's
[1:00:45] that you know is just pleasing or you
[1:00:47] don't realize it maybe but
[1:00:49] is against god's word if that's the
[1:00:52] truth and he's not your lord
[1:00:55] if he's your lord then every part of
[1:00:57] this
[1:00:58] is who you are you are because remember
[1:01:01] we are the word
[1:01:02] you are the word every part of that has
[1:01:04] become you
[1:01:06] and every part of you wants to obey that
[1:01:10] and every bit of that that you obey
[1:01:12] shows that he's your lord
[1:01:15] because you obey him you obey his word
[1:01:17] you obey everything about it
[1:01:20] because he's your lord he's over you he
[1:01:24] is your
[1:01:24] owner he is your ruler he is your
[1:01:28] lord so he's not just savior friend
[1:01:32] he is my lord and savior
[1:01:35] he's my lord i'm gonna live by the
[1:01:38] dictates of his word
[1:01:39] his word tells me his word tells me
[1:01:42] right here
[1:01:43] what that is his word come to a prophet
[1:01:46] for this last day
[1:01:48] bringing about that word that places us
[1:01:51] the
[1:01:52] bride in its position to understand who
[1:01:55] she
[1:01:56] is that he is our lord amen
[1:01:59] he is our lord and savior praise the
[1:02:02] lord
[1:02:03] so i will stop there but lord willing
[1:02:06] uh we'll see what happens next week the
[1:02:08] lord willing we'll get on to the next
