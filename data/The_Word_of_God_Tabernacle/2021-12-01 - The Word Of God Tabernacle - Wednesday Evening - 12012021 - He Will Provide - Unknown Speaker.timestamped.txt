[14:44] back in north carolina and different
[14:45] places he's a minister has a little
[14:47] church in sierra vista
[14:49] uh but uh he's got a tremendous uh
[14:53] voice
[14:54] and i think last
[14:57] obviously wouldn't have
[14:58] harmony last year but the last harmony
[15:01] he sang
[15:02] um i forgot i told you he said
[15:05] oh what a savior he sees that and
[15:09] it just he really belts it
[15:11] song anyway brother swanson
[15:14] has contracted covet
[15:16] his daughter has contracted covet his
[15:19] son-in-law has contracted covet and his
[15:22] son-in-law i believe is supposed to be
[15:25] was supposed to be put on a ventilator

[15:31] or something
[15:34] the information i'm getting is
[15:37] by all medical standards and human
[15:40] standards uh bleak
[15:42] but we know one better than all human
[15:44] medical standards amen so
[15:47] uh so let's remember brother jim i know
[15:49] his daughter's faith i'm not sure of his
[15:51] son-in-law's name
[15:54] let's remember brother jim swanson in

[16:31] brother daniel's been a precious brother
[16:32] he's come to a service or two here with
[16:34] us and uh and he voluntarily and
[16:37] wouldn't take any money for making this
[16:39] pull fit for us and uh i really
[16:42] appreciate it it's been a blessing so
[16:44] let's remember him in prayer if we could

[16:50] family brother
[16:53] as i sent out to you brother dave green
[16:55] passed away
[16:56] yesterday i believe it was yesterday
[16:59] uh so
[17:00] sister chris his wife and of course
[17:02] chrissy and joy and angela
[17:05] need prayer and the family
[17:07] so let's please remember them in prayer
[17:09] brother god
[17:11] i always felt like brother david was a
[17:13] hezekiah
[17:16] god gave him a second lease on life he
[17:18] was he was dead over at northwest
[17:20] hospital for 20 minutes uh back
[17:23] 10 12 years ago whenever it was been a
[17:26] while back the lord blessed him with
[17:27] another uh 10 plus whatever years it was
[17:30] i guess i lose track
[17:33] but the lord really touched him
[17:35] brought him back in his sound mind and
[17:38] healthy heart and
[17:39] but you know it just comes that time and
[17:41] the lord took him yesterday
[17:43] so
[17:45] it just keeps happening saints it's like
[17:47] we said a few weeks back a couple months
[17:49] back
[17:50] uh it just it
[17:52] there's just something going on in the
[17:54] spirit world there's something happening
[17:58] i have my own opinions and thoughts
[17:59] about it obviously but uh
[18:02] there's something significant going on
[18:04] with all of these saints going on and
[18:06] it's not all copen uh you know
[18:10] brother roger's dad just passed away he
[18:12] didn't have coven steve just passed away

[18:30] just on and on
[18:31] uh but
[18:33] my brother angel jr of course
[18:35] so
[18:36] let's just remember the green family and
[18:38] those
[18:39] families extended family in prayer if we
[18:42] would brother dave was a
[18:44] was a fine brother
[18:46] i really would
[18:47] appreciate the opportunity if i could to
[18:49] go to his funeral to his memorial
[18:51] service he was very good to me when we
[18:53] first moved to tucson
[18:55] through brother john and joy yarborough
[18:59] brother
[19:00] he was always a blessing to me always
[19:02] encouragement always helpful
[19:04] one time
[19:06] i'll give this little testimony one time
[19:08] he uh we were somewhere i forgot where
[19:11] we were
[19:12] um but then this was back in no 203
[19:15] something like that i forgot where being
[19:17] dave were somewhere with other people
[19:19] and he said you want to go get a steak
[19:21] and i said man i never turned out a
[19:23] steak and so we drove over and we went
[19:26] to little abner's on silver bell
[19:28] and he ordered two the porterhouse two
[19:31] of the most expensive steaks
[19:33] steaks
[19:34] and i said wow that's more and i was
[19:37] bit off more like a chew
[19:40] pun intended but um
[19:42] we got about a third of the way half the
[19:44] way done with our meal and he said uh or
[19:46] maybe it was when he was paying i can't
[19:48] remember he's and he put out a hundred
[19:50] dollar bill he said that's my last
[19:51] hundred dollars
[19:53] you have any more money
[19:55] bro
[19:56] uh he said literally this is my last
[19:58] hundred dollars
[19:59] he was just that kind of man
[20:01] he was the kind of man that would spend
[20:03] his last dollar because he knew and
[20:05] believed in the promise of god
[20:07] he gave
[20:08] and when you gave you can't out give god
[20:11] amen amen we all know that we've
[20:13] experienced it you can't outgive god
[20:16] he gave his last hundred bucks and of
[20:18] course uh well long after that we moved
[20:21] the mountains but god blessed him after
[20:22] that he became a multi-millionaire after
[20:25] that again
[20:27] amen i'm not saying it's as a result of
[20:29] him buying me a state but uh god said to
[20:33] return it a hundredfold so how who are
[20:35] you argue with that that's right amen
[20:37] but that's just kind of man he was i
[20:39] knew he gave a house to somebody one
[20:40] time he just was acting when he and when
[20:42] he became wealthy he bought people cars
[20:45] and
[20:45] uh he just he just was that kind of
[20:47] person but he didn't just give when he
[20:50] was rich he gave when he had nothing
[20:53] i like i said he gave his last hundred
[20:56] dollars to buy me a meal
[20:58] and i appreciated it then and uh i
[21:01] believe he was an example to me to a lot
[21:03] of people um of the promises that god
[21:06] gives amen so
[21:09] pray for the family
[21:10] uh
[21:11] another giant has gone home another
[21:13] saint has gone home to be with the lord

[33:50] [Applause]
[33:52] so true
[33:54] and can't ask too much
[33:56] i think it's an outstanding
[33:59] amen that uh mike is saying that
[34:02] i can i can vouch for the fact that that
[34:04] was dave green that was one of dave
[34:06] green's favorite scripture favorite
[34:09] songs
[34:10] and his girls i know they sang it so
[34:12] many times
[34:14] i remember
[34:17] especially after
[34:19] the incident where he died in the
[34:21] hospital and
[34:23] the lord blessed him and touched him
[34:24] can't ask too much of god
[34:28] as one of two songs i remember dave
[34:30] green singing the most yes
[34:33] praise the lord
[34:34] wonderful anybody else yeah dominic's
[34:37] father just passed away
[34:40] and i've been chewing on something that
[34:41] he said
[34:43] he said
[34:44] well he said grandma when there was a
[34:47] family relative that died
[34:50] they um a friend of grandmas
[34:53] said you know god just told me he died
[34:56] prematurely
[34:58] and she said let's let's uh god wants me
[35:01] to listen wants him to live again
[35:04] and so
[35:05] they went out and they got a shovel and
[35:08] they dug him up
[35:09] and he lived another um he
[35:12] at the time of the telling
[35:14] uh
[35:14] i don't know how many years ago this was
[35:16] he was still an active member in the
[35:17] church
[35:19] so you know it got me to thinking about
[35:21] and they were a very
[35:23] very
[35:24] feverish pentecostal group
[35:27] and
[35:28] right here in tucson and i've got to it
[35:30] got me to thinking about how many of us
[35:33] have cast on prematurely that weren't
[35:36] quite ready to go
[35:37] because we know satan's going about as a
[35:39] roaring lion right now
[35:41] i have not asked god to remind anybody
[35:45] and i because i thought you know they're
[35:47] in a better place right
[35:48] but
[35:49] we don't you know that's kind of a
[35:51] judgmental
[35:53] i don't i don't know that
[35:55] and and um and and maybe they were it
[35:58] was premature for some of these people
[36:01] and so
[36:02] um i'm going to start asking god to
[36:05] start reviving these people if it's not
[36:07] their time yet well the key phrase you
[36:09] put there was the lord spoke to her and
[36:12] said that was it
[36:13] i'm not going to a graveyard and try to
[36:15] talk to people
[36:16] yeah yeah but i believe if the lord
[36:19] spoke to someone and said
[36:21] thus and thus then it was a death
[36:24] brother it's like brother branham said
[36:25] if god told him to go raise george
[36:27] washington he'd invite the whole world
[36:28] to come see
[36:29] and he would go right out to george
[36:31] washington's grave and he would
[36:33] he would be raised from the dead amen
[36:36] praise the lord but in the hospitals
[36:38] it's easier you know
[36:41] probably yeah but
[36:43] we're trusting the lord in all things so
[36:46] thankful for that let's stand if we
[36:47] could tonight first kings turn our
[36:50] bibles to first kings chapter 17.
[36:57] as we normally do on our wednesday night
[36:59] we don't take too much time
[37:02] by leaving the lord and
[37:07] just a simple thought tonight that went
[37:09] along with the songs with testimonies
[37:11] with so many things that were done and
[37:13] said here
[37:14] so we're just trusting the lord that uh
[37:16] it's his perfect will
[37:18] amen
[37:19] first kings chapter 17.
[37:22] we'll read the first three verses but
[37:24] before we do can we just bow our heads
[37:26] for another word of prayer
[37:27] lord jesus
[37:29] we're indeed grateful again lord for
[37:31] feeling your presence and knowing you
[37:33] here real the same yesterday today and
[37:35] forever
[37:36] we thank you lord for this word that
[37:38] we've opened the pages loved lord
[37:40] tonight and understand and recognize
[37:42] that this word was given to us lord for
[37:44] inspiration for revelation for you lord
[37:48] to speak to us through and we thank you
[37:50] for it lord it helps us understand who
[37:53] you are god
[37:54] and and the way you do things and the
[37:57] things that you're pleased with lord and
[37:59] and all those things are important to us
[38:01] in living our lives for what we could do
[38:03] to be pleasing to you so we pray god
[38:06] that this uh this time of fellowship we
[38:08] have now lord and as we change all of
[38:11] this service that you would speak to us
[38:13] from this word lord that eternal thought
[38:16] and process that you had preordained
[38:18] before the foundation of the world
[38:20] for us tonight for this little group for
[38:22] those who may be streaming or watch it
[38:24] later we just pray god that you would
[38:26] minister to our hearts to our needs to
[38:28] our lives speak through these lips ear
[38:30] hear through our ears lord as we give
[38:33] you the praise and glory for all the
[38:35] testimonies
[38:36] lord believing that you're already
[38:37] working and moving on the prayer
[38:39] requests because you already know what
[38:40] we have need of lord and god we do
[38:43] believe that you can do anything we
[38:46] committed to you now in the name of the
[38:47] lord jesus christ we pray amen
[38:51] first kings 17 1
[38:54] elijah the tishbite who was of the
[38:56] inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as
[38:58] the lord god of israel liveth before
[39:00] whom i stand there shall not be do nor
[39:03] rain these years but according to my
[39:05] word
[39:06] the word of the lord came unto him
[39:08] saying get thee hints and turn thee
[39:09] eastward and hide thyself by the broke
[39:12] cherith that is before jordan you could
[39:14] be seated if you'd like
[39:17] amen i just want to take a little simple
[39:19] thought if the lord willing tonight on
[39:21] he will provide yes amen he will provide
[39:25] so now may he be listening to and
[39:27] hearing that the uh the title of the
[39:29] thought that was on my heart that uh
[39:31] would help make a little more sense of a
[39:34] lot of the testimonies and the things
[39:35] that's been sung and said here tonight
[39:38] amen and the encouragement that we have
[39:39] you know uh when you listen to a lot of
[39:42] times
[39:43] messages brother branham the tapes you
[39:45] put on and you know when brother branham
[39:47] is at a place where he's going to have a
[39:48] prayer line afterwards he usually takes
[39:51] a subject a scripture and an
[39:53] attitude towards building the faith of
[39:56] the people getting the people into a
[39:58] place of receiving
[40:00] by faith receiving that healing or
[40:03] receiving that that they've come up for
[40:05] prayer for
[40:06] and that whole the whole
[40:08] 30 45 minute hour or whatever just build
[40:10] up to that is for that purpose to bring
[40:13] it to that now of course the scripture
[40:14] is spoken the scripture is preached in
[40:16] the scripture and the hearing of the
[40:18] word brings faith but that whole motive
[40:21] of that brother ram says that many times
[40:23] is to bring it to that place and it kind
[40:26] of reminded me of that tonight and the
[40:27] songs and the things that was said and
[40:29] done to bring it to that place of night
[40:32] to this to this climax of the uh of the
[40:35] title is he will provide he will provide
[40:39] now that statement stands alone of its
[40:42] of its own
[40:44] he will provide there's not a might
[40:46] there's not a could be there's not a
[40:48] possibly
[40:49] there's not a he can't
[40:51] no
[40:52] he will provide i'm not here to tell you
[40:55] he can provide we know he can provide
[40:58] i'm here to tell you tonight he will
[41:01] provide amen has he ever met a time that
[41:04] he hasn't provided
[41:06] for us
[41:07] i i would stand here and say tonight to
[41:10] me in my personal testimony there has
[41:12] never been a time where god hasn't
[41:15] provided for us now it isn't always when
[41:18] we wanted it to be it wasn't always how
[41:20] he wanted it to be but god has always
[41:23] provided and he always will because
[41:26] that's the promise of his word even when
[41:28] elijah was standing here and declaring
[41:31] the curse that was upon israel when he
[41:34] was telling uh ahab that there won't be
[41:37] any rain or no dewfall till i call for
[41:40] it according to
[41:41] my word there'll be none
[41:44] even in the midst of that curse
[41:47] elijah was a part of that land
[41:51] elijah was in the midst of that curse
[41:54] the curse that he
[41:56] by god proclaimed upon the land he was
[42:00] in the midst of it now he but the big
[42:03] part of it he wasn't a part of the curse
[42:07] he was in the midst of the curse but he
[42:09] wasn't a part of the curse the curse
[42:11] didn't include him because god provided
[42:15] for elijah
[42:17] that's the next part of this he says go
[42:19] to the broke chair then i will feed you
[42:21] there god provided for elijah but god
[42:25] provided for elijah
[42:27] after the curse because you notice here
[42:31] the first verse
[42:33] is when elijah pronounced the curse
[42:36] there won't be any rain and no do till
[42:39] according to my word so that was a was a
[42:42] statement
[42:43] settled and finished before he come out
[42:46] from ahab
[42:48] now god says now the word of the lord
[42:51] come unto him and said now do this
[42:54] so my point is when when elijah uh
[42:57] pronounced that curse and him being in
[43:00] the midst of that curse
[43:02] uh
[43:04] he didn't know what god was gonna do for
[43:06] him
[43:07] it didn't say
[43:08] god doesn't tell him to go to the brook
[43:10] cherith until after he pronounced the
[43:13] curse
[43:14] you understand but i believe of course
[43:16] this prophet elijah
[43:18] had enough and knew enough of god to
[43:20] knew that if god told him to do
[43:22] something god was going to provide for
[43:23] him
[43:24] god was going to take care of him and
[43:26] how many times even in our ignorance
[43:29] even in you know
[43:31] this may sound a little crude but even
[43:33] in our stupidity sometimes god still
[43:35] provides yes so it still takes care of
[43:38] us
[43:38] how did you get yourself down in that
[43:40] ditch i don't know lord i made a wrong
[43:42] turn somewhere
[43:44] i'll provide for you just come on
[43:47] amen i'll take care of you just come on
[43:50] you're down there again i know lord i
[43:52] made the wrong turn again we get
[43:54] ourselves in trouble make stupid
[43:56] decisions do wrong things and god says
[43:58] i'm dead i'm there i'll provide for you
[44:00] i'll still take care of you you're
[44:02] belong to me
[44:04] you're my child i'm going to take care
[44:06] of you and that's what god does he
[44:08] provides for his own even though elijah
[44:11] was in the midst of the curse he wasn't
[44:13] a part of the curse god gave him a word
[44:16] now that was afterwards but god told him
[44:18] now now you go to the brook chair i'll
[44:21] take care of you there and of course god
[44:23] sent the ravens bringing bringing him
[44:26] meat in the morning and bringing him
[44:27] meat in the afternoon and he drank by
[44:29] the
[44:30] drank the water from the broke god
[44:32] provided for him and we know as we've
[44:35] studied before
[44:36] the word cherith here means cutting
[44:39] amen god was doing a little surgery on
[44:43] spiritual surgery on elijah cutting on
[44:46] elijah a little bit because elijah was
[44:48] about to come to one of the greatest
[44:51] showdowns in scriptural history
[44:55] not just for his life
[44:57] but one of the greatest showdowns in
[44:59] scriptural history was about to take
[45:02] place elijah facing off with all of
[45:05] ahab's prophets
[45:06] on mount carmel
[45:08] the mount carmel showdown
[45:11] so god had to tune
[45:13] if you will elijah up a little bit god
[45:16] had to cut him a little bit god had to
[45:18] take away some certain things and get
[45:20] elijah in the place that he was going to
[45:22] be in the position of faith to be able
[45:25] to do what he needed to do on mount
[45:27] carmel now a lot of times people come
[45:30] and they they face these uh they they
[45:33] face these adversities head on and they
[45:35] fall flat on their faces
[45:38] because they have nothing to sustain
[45:40] them there well first of all probably
[45:42] wasn't a directive of the lord because
[45:44] if you felt fight on your face it surely
[45:46] wasn't a directive of the lord because
[45:48] god would take care of that person but
[45:51] how many times head on and but they have
[45:54] no authority to do so
[45:56] they have no they got inspiration they
[45:58] got enthusiasm they got emotion but then
[46:01] they fall flat on their face because it
[46:03] wasn't of god
[46:04] it wasn't the will of the lord look at
[46:06] david and brother and i'm doing trying
[46:08] to do a god of service without his will
[46:10] fell flat on his face a man of god a man
[46:13] after god's own heart fell flat on his
[46:15] face
[46:16] bro brought curses upon the people
[46:19] because of his decision
[46:21] and fell flat because it wasn't of the
[46:23] lord
[46:24] but now god had to get elijah ready god
[46:27] had to prepare elijah so this this curse
[46:31] had to come
[46:32] that was also a judgment on israel but
[46:35] it was also something to help elijah
[46:38] tune himself up and get himself ready
[46:41] for the faith that he needed to to be
[46:43] able to attack them on this showdown on
[46:46] mount carmel
[46:48] had to be some cutting take place
[46:51] some people
[46:52] worry
[46:54] that god won't provide now this worry is
[46:57] many times secretive people won't
[46:59] normally tell you that they might in a
[47:02] roundabout way
[47:04] but their fear overcomes their faith
[47:06] and they and they and they don't have
[47:08] anything to hold on to at that point
[47:10] so they don't so they worry that god
[47:13] won't provide
[47:14] but if you understand the scripture and
[47:16] have the faith to believe what jesus has
[47:18] done always done always will do in the
[47:21] promise of his word you know he's going
[47:23] to provide
[47:25] as he did
[47:26] then he'll do now if god done it one way
[47:29] one time he'll do it that way all the
[47:31] way through and we can't doubt that
[47:34] god will provide always has some people
[47:37] worry about it but you
[47:38] you can't worry i mean you can't let you
[47:42] can't let doubt and fear enter in
[47:44] because god will take care of his own
[47:46] amen now we notice that elijah after he
[47:49] left the cherith and the brook dried up
[47:51] god sent him down to zaraphat
[47:54] and zarephath uh
[47:56] means in the hebrew means refinery
[47:59] so first of all just like god does to us
[48:02] so many times amen we get us in the
[48:04] position we need to be in god has to cut
[48:07] on us a little bit
[48:08] get certain things away and tune certain
[48:11] things up and make certain things right
[48:13] or build that faith to a place and then
[48:15] there's got to be a refinery that takes
[48:17] place it's kind of kind of like the
[48:19] potter in the clay
[48:21] amen where the clay he's the potter
[48:23] sometimes he takes that clay and it's
[48:25] just a big ugly lump and that's exactly
[48:27] what i was a big ugly woman but god put
[48:30] us on the refining wheel and he began to
[48:33] cut here and he began to take tools and
[48:35] cut this off and cut that off and shape
[48:36] it here and shape it there but then
[48:38] there come a time where it started to
[48:40] get into a certain image
[48:42] when he got into that image of what he
[48:44] had in his mind sort of like
[48:45] michelangelo and the and
[48:47] uh moses you know we had in his mind you
[48:51] know
[48:52] it was asked to michelangelo what well
[48:54] how are you able to chip moses out of
[48:57] this he said oh that was easy i just
[48:59] chipped everything
[49:00] all the stuff away that wasn't moses
[49:03] i say it sounds easy to you
[49:05] i don't know easy to me but uh easy to
[49:08] you but yeah he he said all i did was
[49:11] knock away everything that wasn't moses
[49:14] and see that's exactly what god does to
[49:16] us that's what god was trying to do with
[49:18] elijah was cutting and he had to come to
[49:20] a refining place
[49:22] god wants to cut everything away that's
[49:24] not him
[49:26] everything
[49:27] everything of our lives is not him god
[49:29] wants to cut that away but then when you
[49:31] get to that uh image when it starts to
[49:34] resemble what you want it to be
[49:36] let's just say a cup or something on the
[49:38] pottery wheel it gets to the place that
[49:41] it begins to resemble
[49:43] uh what what you want it to be what the
[49:45] what's in your mind then there's just
[49:47] little fine tunings that go on you put
[49:50] away the cutting tool
[49:52] you put away the the the uh the things
[49:55] that that take big gouges and you you
[49:58] start refining it you just put little
[50:00] fine tunes to it then to make it exactly
[50:02] the way you want it to be i used to do
[50:04] that woodworking
[50:05] when i was woodworking in high school i
[50:08] really loved that making stuff i could
[50:09] make something like this you know a
[50:10] heartbeat but then you get to the place
[50:12] where you cut all the wood and you put
[50:14] it all into place you look at it and you
[50:15] say well that looks pretty crude and
[50:17] rough but then you get to refining it
[50:19] and you smooth off the edges and you
[50:21] sand it down and then it just starts
[50:23] coming into a beautiful piece of
[50:25] furniture
[50:26] that's the way god wants it to be that's
[50:28] the way god had to do with elijah he had
[50:30] to refine him he had to get elijah to
[50:32] the place that uh
[50:34] that that god could use him for that
[50:37] position on mount carmel now so many
[50:40] times
[50:41] people also have in their minds the
[50:43] doubt comes in but people also
[50:47] a lot of times think well god's
[50:48] provision is is is miraculous
[50:52] well god's provision isn't always
[50:54] miraculous friend in fact most of the
[50:56] time if you look in the scripture
[50:59] the miracles that god does he does by
[51:01] the hands of other people
[51:04] amen now he god is a miracle worker
[51:08] uh
[51:09] he can make the sun come out right now
[51:11] if you wanted to right i mean he can do
[51:13] we know he can do uh miracles and make
[51:16] something out of nothing he's the only
[51:18] one that can do that of course that
[51:20] spoken word that god
[51:22] did in the beginning he's the same god
[51:24] today i know that but if you look at the
[51:26] scripture most of the time the miracles
[51:28] that take place were at the hands of
[51:30] other people
[51:33] think about it and so many times god is
[51:36] looking to provide for us but a lot of
[51:39] times the provision that god wants to
[51:41] make for us comes by the work of our
[51:43] hands
[51:45] it's like sister mati said
[51:47] the sacrifice i don't give what kind of
[51:49] sacrifice if it isn't if there's nothing
[51:52] that takes from me
[51:54] if it's simple if it's easy if there's
[51:56] no stretch if there's no hardship if
[51:59] there's no struggle or if there's no
[52:01] push or pull then what what's the
[52:02] sacrifice
[52:04] and that's the way the sacrifices became
[52:06] uh to israel they became just a common
[52:09] thing that meant nothing to them it's
[52:11] just you know take the take the lamb and
[52:14] go down and kill him and and
[52:16] do do the dating then go back home
[52:18] that's all it became to him and that's
[52:20] the way it is for a lot of people but
[52:22] what kind of sacrifice it is
[52:24] isn't something that is sacrificial
[52:27] that is sometimes hard
[52:29] sometimes
[52:30] it it takes you your very energy and
[52:34] effort that's a lot of times that's what
[52:36] god provides
[52:38] but he provides by the work of our hands
[52:43] that's that's the provision you got some
[52:45] people said well i don't want that well
[52:47] then you don't want to be provided for
[52:51] because god wants to provide for you but
[52:53] sometimes it comes a lot of times it
[52:55] comes by the sweat of the brow
[52:57] sometimes it comes by the strength of
[52:59] the hand
[53:00] the provision that god wants to make
[53:02] there's effort that's put into it
[53:04] there's there's sacrifices put into it
[53:07] to be able to to gain the provision that
[53:10] god's looking for
[53:12] now we're going in the story
[53:14] elijah doesn't only god doesn't only
[53:17] provide for elijah chairman a cherith
[53:20] and zeraphat
[53:22] he also as god sends him to this widow
[53:24] woman god also then provides for the
[53:26] widow amen she was obedient
[53:29] by the work of her hand god provided for
[53:32] her and her son
[53:36] god you say well uh that
[53:39] god
[53:41] let's go back to this
[53:43] god didn't
[53:46] put a cake on their table every day
[53:49] god didn't do that right all he did was
[53:52] make sure that the crews didn't run dry
[53:55] the mill didn't go dry right that's all
[53:57] god did
[53:58] it was her choice it was her hand and
[54:02] her work that caused the to get into the
[54:04] oil to get into the grain to do
[54:06] everything to make the case and to bake
[54:08] what was needed to sustain their lives
[54:11] she had to do her part and work toward
[54:14] through the provision that god had made
[54:16] yes it was a miracle
[54:18] that
[54:19] the loaves and the fishes yes it was a
[54:21] miracle that the crews didn't go dry and
[54:24] the barrel didn't go empty yeah it was a
[54:26] miracle but it took her hand god didn't
[54:28] just put the cake there
[54:31] god didn't say well exactly how would
[54:33] you like your t-bone now can god do that
[54:37] he said well god i prefer a rib eye
[54:39] well tough
[54:42] no i'd rather it be
[54:43] but
[54:45] you understand
[54:46] sometimes it takes most of the time it
[54:49] takes the work of our hand that god
[54:51] provides that god blesses
[54:53] because that's his word
[54:55] so many people so many times want it the
[54:58] simple way but
[55:00] most of the time friend it doesn't come
[55:02] the simple way right look at this
[55:04] now we know these stories but
[55:06] deuteronomy uh
[55:07] excuse me genesis
[55:12] let's go to genesis chapter 22.
[55:23] praise the lord
[55:24] so the fact that elijah was obedient
[55:28] and god provided for elijah
[55:31] also was able to sustain this widow
[55:34] woman and her son
[55:36] praise the lord
[55:37] see what so many times our decisions
[55:40] have repercussions
[55:43] good or bad
[55:44] they they reverberate out to the people
[55:47] around us
[55:49] maybe not even people that we know
[55:53] it's amazing that they talk today and
[55:55] there's this big debate now
[55:57] uh going on the supreme court about
[55:59] abortion
[56:01] well it should never have been a debate
[56:03] it should have always been declared
[56:05] abortions murder period if you do it
[56:07] we're gonna put you in jail
[56:10] that should be the end of that
[56:12] because it is but
[56:14] there's a big debate now
[56:16] this state's got a new law that should
[56:19] are they going to uphold the law are
[56:20] they going to throw it out is it against
[56:21] roe versus wade is the federal
[56:23] government going to dictate is the state
[56:25] government during the dictate people out
[56:27] there screaming and yelling my body my
[56:29] choice and all these things and i'm
[56:31] thinking yeah well you know people are
[56:33] doing the same about the about the
[56:35] coleman uh shot yeah i almost said
[56:38] vaccines not a vaccine
[56:40] the covet shock they're doing the same
[56:41] thing
[56:42] my body my choice
[56:44] and i agree with them to that point but
[56:46] then the others will come and say yeah
[56:49] but your choice is affecting other
[56:51] people and i'm saying yours doesn't
[56:54] yeah
[56:55] first of all you're murdering a child
[56:59] second of all who knows what that child
[57:01] is going to grow up to be right
[57:03] that child could have been the president
[57:05] of the united states one day that person
[57:08] could have been a minister of the gospel
[57:09] that person could have affected hundreds
[57:12] or thousands of lives millions of lives
[57:16] you don't know
[57:17] you say well it doesn't affect anybody
[57:19] else oh yes it does
[57:21] our lives affect other people every day
[57:24] i just debate with that same guy
[57:27] uh
[57:28] the job we were looking at
[57:30] and
[57:31] he's gone on and on and on and at the
[57:34] end of it or this ended it by the way
[57:36] anyway we were talking about uh abortion
[57:39] and he said well you know israel has
[57:41] abortion i said i don't care
[57:43] that's up to israel i said it's still
[57:45] wrong i don't care who does it or don't
[57:47] do it
[57:48] it's still wrong
[57:49] and and he went on i said well i'll just
[57:51] tell you this i said i sure am glad my
[57:53] mama didn't decide to have an abortion
[57:57] that ended it
[57:59] he was he was done talking at that point
[58:01] but it's the truth yeah see and how many
[58:04] people
[58:05] are affected not only by the actual
[58:08] literal act
[58:10] but the residual effects of ending and
[58:12] terminating that life of what it could
[58:14] have been to the world
[58:16] people all over the world they say oh it
[58:18] doesn't affect anybody else yes it does
[58:21] oh yes it does
[58:22] our and our lives affect other people's
[58:24] lives every day
[58:26] every day
[58:27] now
[58:28] genesis chapter 22 let's look at uh
[58:31] beginning with verse five
[58:33] this question abraham was taking isaac
[58:36] up to be sacrificed to offer up and
[58:38] abraham said unto his young men
[58:41] abide here with the ass as i and the lad
[58:43] will go yonder worship and come again to
[58:45] you now that's a statement of faith
[58:48] that in itself right because god had
[58:50] already told him take your son your only
[58:52] son up there and sacrifice him
[58:55] so for and that's all he knew
[58:57] just like elijah all elijah knew was
[59:01] go tell him no rain or do and that's
[59:03] exactly what it is
[59:05] i mean there's
[59:07] could there been a private conversation
[59:08] with god elijah sure there could have
[59:10] been it's not written in the scripture
[59:11] elijah could have said well god what
[59:13] about me
[59:14] you know a lot of times that's the way
[59:16] we get don't we oh i'm so selfish
[59:19] sometimes self-centered that's the way
[59:21] of the world today right yeah selfish
[59:23] self-centered me number one no not just
[59:26] number one me only really people like it
[59:28] that way they'd rather just be the only
[59:30] ones but i don't know i just said what
[59:32] about me lord a lot of people what about
[59:34] me lord
[59:35] but i i you know i'm gonna say that
[59:37] didn't take place i don't know but it's
[59:39] not in the scripture
[59:41] that's our that's our absolute
[59:43] so it's not in the scripture
[59:45] elijah said
[59:47] went and told ahab exactly what even
[59:49] though he was a part of it well abraham
[59:51] did the same thing
[59:52] he knew that god told him to go take
[59:55] isaac and sacrifice him that was all he
[59:57] knew that was what god had told him this
[59:58] is what you need to do this is where you
[1:00:00] need to do it so when abraham told his
[1:00:03] uh the young lads there that they would
[1:00:05] go worship and come back
[1:00:08] that was a statement of faith yes amen
[1:00:12] abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:00:14] offering laid it upon his uh upon isaac
[1:00:16] his son just like god did to his sons
[1:00:19] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[1:00:21] knife and they were uh they went both of
[1:00:23] them together and isaac speaking to
[1:00:25] abraham's father said my father he said
[1:00:27] here i am my son
[1:00:29] he said behold the fire and the wood but
[1:00:31] where is the lamb for the burnt offering
[1:00:33] abraham said my son
[1:00:35] god will provide himself a lamb praise
[1:00:38] the lord right for a burnt offering so
[1:00:40] they went both of them together god will
[1:00:42] provide yes amen
[1:00:45] and they came to the place which god had
[1:00:47] told them of
[1:00:49] and abraham built an altar there laid
[1:00:51] the wooded order bound isaac his son and
[1:00:53] laid him upon laid him on the altar upon
[1:00:56] the wood
[1:00:57] abraham stretched forth his hand took
[1:01:00] his night to slay his sons because
[1:01:03] that's what god asked him to do
[1:01:05] amen abraham was faithful to the point
[1:01:08] of death
[1:01:12] you know
[1:01:13] sometimes god provision isn't always
[1:01:16] when we want it to be
[1:01:18] a lot of times or all the time god's
[1:01:20] provision is going to be when he wants
[1:01:22] it and how he wants it yeah what we need
[1:01:25] to do is to get into his spirit so that
[1:01:28] we understand through his spirit what
[1:01:31] that and when that is going to be
[1:01:34] sometimes god waits till the last minute
[1:01:37] yes he does oh god uh we we don't have
[1:01:40] any food fill up our cabinets with food
[1:01:43] god doesn't normally work that way great
[1:01:45] but he'll give you what you need when
[1:01:47] you need it
[1:01:48] we've heard the story who was it that
[1:01:50] repeated it here not long ago about the
[1:01:52] man that sat there had the orphanage or
[1:01:54] something set there they had no food
[1:01:56] they said let's just get around like
[1:01:58] we're getting ready to eat set the table
[1:02:00] get everything ready just like we
[1:02:01] normally do we have food to eat
[1:02:03] everybody sit down and we pray and we
[1:02:04] ask god and thank god for the food yes
[1:02:07] and get halfway down with the prayer and
[1:02:09] the knock comes to the door so we had
[1:02:11] all this food our truck broke down or
[1:02:12] something whatever it was truck broke
[1:02:14] down we got all this food uh we we need
[1:02:16] uh we need somebody to eat consume we
[1:02:18] need to get rid of
[1:02:20] top table full of kids
[1:02:23] now they got food yes from a truck
[1:02:26] god pre-ordained to bring them food yes
[1:02:30] maybe at the last second right but god
[1:02:34] still does it may not be in the way that
[1:02:35] we expect it to be
[1:02:37] but god will still do it
[1:02:39] amen
[1:02:40] because he does it when and how he wants
[1:02:42] to do it
[1:02:43] it's his choice
[1:02:45] sometimes it's a sometimes it's a step
[1:02:47] at a time
[1:02:48] sometimes what we need and what we're
[1:02:50] looking for in provision is is uh is
[1:02:54] taken a step at a time
[1:02:56] just like healing
[1:02:58] healing most of the time
[1:03:00] is a step at a time it's a process
[1:03:03] problem said it's a process of time
[1:03:06] that all the time we want a miracle any
[1:03:09] people they all want a miracle we're
[1:03:11] sick god heal me this very second
[1:03:13] and then that hinders our faith from
[1:03:15] actually receiving healing amen
[1:03:19] because we expect instantaneous
[1:03:21] deliverance from this
[1:03:23] but sometimes it's a step at a time
[1:03:25] right you know brother ram talked about
[1:03:26] that story that man
[1:03:28] he was talking about god and you believe
[1:03:30] in god his infidel and and brother
[1:03:32] branham was telling them so well where's
[1:03:33] jehoma it's over the hill he said how do
[1:03:35] you get there there was this path that
[1:03:36] run over here he said hey you know
[1:03:38] there's a path he said well i've been
[1:03:39] there before he said well you can't see
[1:03:40] it now he said well i got this ladder he
[1:03:43] said yeah but the latter will only show
[1:03:44] you one step at a time
[1:03:47] one step at a time
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:51] one day at a time sweet jesus
[1:03:54] sometimes it's only a step at a time
[1:03:56] we want it now god we want it
[1:03:59] instantaneously we want a miracle and
[1:04:02] sometimes it's just a step at a time
[1:04:04] it's it's a progress
[1:04:06] it's a it's a progression
[1:04:08] and we just
[1:04:09] we just expect god to do well just like
[1:04:11] elijah elijah's was a step at a time
[1:04:15] he went to the and obey god first step
[1:04:17] was no reign or do
[1:04:19] second step was go to the brook chair
[1:04:22] third step was go to the uh uh
[1:04:27] the next uh
[1:04:29] forgot the name of it now the next one
[1:04:31] that he went to and then the widow woman
[1:04:32] it was all a step at a time
[1:04:35] amen it's all a step at a time well god
[1:04:38] uh we've exhausted that what's next well
[1:04:41] when it comes time god will show you
[1:04:43] god will provide it god will make a way
[1:04:46] yes it's coming in the most i don't know
[1:04:47] how i'm gonna pay the bills god will
[1:04:48] provide amen yes
[1:04:50] he will provide
[1:04:52] it's his it's his uh uh responsibility
[1:04:55] to provide god this this is god's house
[1:04:58] he'll provide for it right amen he'll
[1:05:01] take care of it he always does now
[1:05:04] again most his provision that he gives i
[1:05:07] haven't i haven't found a twelve hundred
[1:05:10] dollar tree yet to go plug the money off
[1:05:13] of to pay the rent for the building it
[1:05:15] comes by the work of our hands right
[1:05:17] amen the church the giving and uh it all
[1:05:20] comes with the work of our hands yet he
[1:05:23] provides but he provides through us
[1:05:26] amen
[1:05:27] praise the lord so god's providing for
[1:05:30] abraham
[1:05:31] as abraham tells his son god will
[1:05:33] provide us a sacrifice he's got his hand
[1:05:35] up to take his own son's life just like
[1:05:38] god said
[1:05:39] eleventh first the angel of the lord
[1:05:41] called out un unto him out of heaven and
[1:05:43] said abraham abraham he said here am i
[1:05:47] he said lay not thine hand upon the lad
[1:05:50] neither do thou anything unto him for
[1:05:52] now i know that thou fearest god seeing
[1:05:54] that thou has not withheld thy son thy
[1:05:56] only son for me
[1:05:58] abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:06:00] and behold behind him in a behind him a
[1:06:04] ram caught in a thicket by the horns
[1:06:07] abraham went went and took the ramp
[1:06:09] offered him up for a burnt offering
[1:06:11] instead of his son and abraham called
[1:06:13] the name of that place jehovah jirei it
[1:06:15] is said to this day in the mount of the
[1:06:18] lord it shall be seen jehovah jireh
[1:06:22] god shall provide himself
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:25] god will provide
[1:06:28] no if
[1:06:29] ands but think about the think about the
[1:06:32] children of israel how many times
[1:06:35] did god provide and miracles
[1:06:38] miraculous things over and over and over
[1:06:42] and over again for them
[1:06:44] yes god made a way in every situation
[1:06:47] every time even in the midst of their
[1:06:50] burmering and they're complaining even
[1:06:52] when they got themselves in the deepest
[1:06:54] ditches
[1:06:55] even when they made uh so many horrible
[1:06:58] fatal errors god still took care of them
[1:07:02] so much so look at deuteronomy
[1:07:05] we're going to close here in just a
[1:07:06] minute deuteronomy
[1:07:09] uh
[1:07:10] i was going to read more than this verse
[1:07:12] 5. deuteronomy 29 5
[1:07:17] and i have led you 40 years in the
[1:07:20] wilderness your clothes are not waxing
[1:07:22] old upon you and thy shoe is not waxing
[1:07:26] old upon my foot right
[1:07:29] 40
[1:07:30] years
[1:07:32] and they weren't 40 years sitting in an
[1:07:34] easy chair with their feet up right
[1:07:37] these were 40 hard years of sojourning
[1:07:41] and walking and travailing around that
[1:07:44] desert for 40 years right
[1:07:47] but their clothes didn't get old and
[1:07:50] their shoes didn't fall off their feet
[1:07:52] right anybody anybody in here got
[1:07:54] anything you had 40 years ago
[1:07:58] nobody
[1:08:00] i might but
[1:08:02] don't fit anymore
[1:08:04] i don't think i have anything that 40
[1:08:06] years that was before me and my wife got
[1:08:08] married 40 years ago
[1:08:11] i don't have anything 40 years ago that
[1:08:13] i even own anymore much less it would
[1:08:15] fit me
[1:08:18] but not one thing
[1:08:20] their
[1:08:21] clothes shoes
[1:08:23] god provided for them
[1:08:25] and everything they did
[1:08:27] and all the murmuring and all the
[1:08:28] complaining even the miracles
[1:08:32] the provision god did god
[1:08:34] they were screaming and yelling about
[1:08:36] food god gave them fresh manna every
[1:08:39] single day
[1:08:40] miraculously
[1:08:42] they just had to go out and get it
[1:08:44] right amen then he told him well now on
[1:08:47] the sixth day take enough for yourself
[1:08:49] for the seventh day because you're not
[1:08:50] going to gather on that day it's a day
[1:08:52] of rest and some people still try to do
[1:08:54] it
[1:08:55] you know what happened to them
[1:08:57] and of course even if they got for
[1:08:59] even if they went out on the seventh day
[1:09:01] it brought it anyway it was no good
[1:09:05] so
[1:09:05] it
[1:09:06] didn't help you
[1:09:08] obey the lord but god provided for them
[1:09:10] then they're like well we're sick of
[1:09:12] this light bread god sends them quails
[1:09:14] they go get the quails grab them up we
[1:09:17] got food we got me and they got tired of
[1:09:19] that
[1:09:20] just one thing after the other amen
[1:09:24] but god continued to to provide for them
[1:09:27] left and right always god still does the
[1:09:29] same thing for us today
[1:09:31] amen god provides for us
[1:09:34] every way every time
[1:09:37] god provides
[1:09:40] let's go to one more scripture
[1:09:44] philippians chapter 4.
[1:09:49] amen philippians chapter 4
[1:09:58] amen
[1:10:00] verse 19.
[1:10:03] philippians 4 19 but my god
[1:10:06] shall supply all
[1:10:10] all
[1:10:11] your need
[1:10:13] according to his riches
[1:10:16] in glory
[1:10:18] by christ jesus
[1:10:20] he god
[1:10:22] will provide
[1:10:24] supply
[1:10:26] not some
[1:10:28] not most
[1:10:30] all
[1:10:31] your needs
[1:10:33] all my needs right
[1:10:36] if i was a good
[1:10:37] televangelist i'd tell you to say it to
[1:10:40] yourself now
[1:10:41] but you know that you know who you are i
[1:10:45] don't need to tell you to say it
[1:10:48] but
[1:10:51] he will supply
[1:10:53] all
[1:10:55] my needs
[1:10:57] now how is he going to do this he's
[1:10:59] going to do it
[1:11:00] with his provisions right
[1:11:04] with his riches
[1:11:07] in glory
[1:11:09] oh my well now you've tapped an
[1:11:11] inexhaustible supply of riches
[1:11:14] an inexhaustible supply of
[1:11:18] of provisions god-giving
[1:11:21] now we've tapped into something that's
[1:11:23] eternal
[1:11:24] so our needs are not just supplied say
[1:11:27] people will look for the next check or
[1:11:29] people look for the name the government
[1:11:31] this and and the the job that and and
[1:11:34] all all the things swirling all around
[1:11:36] us look at this and you know god
[1:11:38] supplies it now the tapping in
[1:11:41] i know the federal government especially
[1:11:43] nowadays seems to believe that they have
[1:11:45] an exhaustible supply of print they can
[1:11:48] print money left and right and
[1:11:51] everything's going crazy expensive now
[1:11:53] but they think they can just go and just
[1:11:55] print money
[1:11:56] but if you do that in your garage
[1:11:58] they'll put you in jail
[1:12:00] but they can do it
[1:12:02] it's okay for them to do it
[1:12:04] trillions of dollars trillions i can't
[1:12:06] even fathom what is a trillion how many
[1:12:09] zeros is in a trillion just one
[1:12:12] people say they're gonna they're gonna
[1:12:14] tax the billionaires you could take
[1:12:16] every money from all the billionaires in
[1:12:18] the world and it won't touch half of our
[1:12:20] bud of our deficit
[1:12:23] yeah
[1:12:24] that's a lot
[1:12:26] so now you think
[1:12:27] but god's
[1:12:29] inexhaustible riches
[1:12:31] come from glory
[1:12:33] come from him
[1:12:36] owns the cattle one thousand uh a
[1:12:39] thousand heels he's the same god today
[1:12:42] he supplies our needs he provides our
[1:12:46] need
[1:12:47] we
[1:12:49] the worry fret concern sometimes we get
[1:12:52] concerned concerned not i get that worry
[1:12:56] worry will put you in a heart attack
[1:12:58] yes worry will put you in a physical
[1:13:00] state that you don't want yourself to be
[1:13:02] in
[1:13:03] but we can believe and have faith that
[1:13:05] god's going to provide
[1:13:07] i know sometimes that
[1:13:09] i've i've in my own mind
[1:13:12] and and come across
[1:13:14] things situations
[1:13:16] circumstances that it looked bleak
[1:13:19] things didn't look like they were going
[1:13:21] to work out very well
[1:13:24] and then you go to talk to the lord
[1:13:26] about it
[1:13:28] and god will remind you didn't i do this
[1:13:32] didn't i do this
[1:13:34] weren't you in this kind of
[1:13:35] situation here over here and i did this
[1:13:39] and i took care of this over here
[1:13:41] and i provided for that there i took
[1:13:44] care of you over here and then as you
[1:13:46] start enveloping yourself in the
[1:13:48] presence of the lord and remembering the
[1:13:50] things that god had done for you it just
[1:13:52] takes away all the worry yeah amen
[1:13:55] it takes away all the stress
[1:13:57] it takes away all the bitterness takes
[1:13:59] away all
[1:14:00] all those things that that work to
[1:14:03] destroy the spirit and the connection of
[1:14:05] god but unfortunately a lot of times
[1:14:07] that's the last place people go is to
[1:14:10] god
[1:14:11] and say god ask him
[1:14:14] amen you send god today
[1:14:18] he will provide
[1:14:20] he never see the righteous forsaken or
[1:14:22] receive begging bread right
[1:14:24] because he provides yes amen many times
[1:14:28] we we work hard for those provisions
[1:14:31] sometimes in our lives and our bodies
[1:14:33] and the strength that we give but it's
[1:14:35] god's provision it doesn't make it any
[1:14:37] less god's provision
[1:14:39] it's like the scripture said oh i i
[1:14:42] gained i gained this wealth of myself no
[1:14:44] you didn't
[1:14:46] if you did if there wasn't a god to give
[1:14:48] you your next breath you couldn't do
[1:14:50] anything right amen if there wasn't a
[1:14:52] god to take to put the next beat in your
[1:14:55] heart you would be a dead man
[1:14:57] if you didn't have the strength in your
[1:14:59] back or the intelligence in your mind
[1:15:02] you're worthless
[1:15:03] you're done you can't provide anything
[1:15:07] but god provides
[1:15:09] amen
[1:15:10] god provides god takes care of the
[1:15:12] ability for us to be able to do what we
[1:15:14] need to do
[1:15:15] to his honor and glory right
[1:15:18] amen it's all for his honor and glory
[1:15:21] amen let's stand if we could
[1:15:30] praise the lord
[1:15:35] god our provider
[1:15:39] always provides
[1:15:41] he will continue to provide
[1:15:44] and he is no respecter of person
[1:15:48] and like micah said
[1:15:50] we can't ask too much of him
[1:15:52] it's impossible to ask too much of it
[1:15:55] it's his riches and glory he's supplying
[1:15:57] it with is that inexhaustible
[1:16:03] amen
[1:16:05] praise the lord listening this little
[1:16:06] course tonight
[1:16:10] jehovah

[1:16:14] he makes a way where there seems to be
[1:16:16] no way
[1:16:18] we believe it faith trust and he's going
[1:16:20] to continue to do so
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:24] oh i made such a big mistake god's going
[1:16:26] to no no no
[1:16:28] no he's not
