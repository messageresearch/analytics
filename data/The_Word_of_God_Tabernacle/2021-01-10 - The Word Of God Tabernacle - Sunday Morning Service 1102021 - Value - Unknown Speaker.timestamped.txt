[0:02] hello everyone
[0:03] god bless you today i hope uh this is
[0:06] coming through okay
[0:07] i've had a few little difficulties here
[0:09] getting it started back from
[0:11] remembering how to do this from last
[0:12] time and signing on to youtube and
[0:15] everything we have to do to try to get
[0:16] this rolling so it feels kind of weird
[0:18] again
[0:19] because it's been a while since i've
[0:21] done this and uh
[0:22] sorry that we have to be under these
[0:23] circumstances but i'm very thankful the
[0:26] lord gives
[0:27] us the opportunity to be able to do this
[0:29] and under these circumstances felt it
[0:30] would probably be best this way so
[0:33] i just pray it just be a blessing to you
[0:35] and help you today
[0:36] i really didn't feel led when i woke up
[0:38] this morning and
[0:39] as tabitha gave me the news about joel
[0:42] that
[0:43] i really didn't feel led to do what i
[0:45] had give god given on my heart
[0:47] uh over this streaming uh
[0:50] so lord willing will do that next week
[0:53] but
[0:53] uh then they're pretty directly you
[0:57] give me something i thought of yesterday
[0:58] and uh
[1:00] and put a couple scriptures together and
[1:03] the things that the lord just put
[1:04] together so
[1:05] and it and it leads right into next week
[1:08] so
[1:08] lord willing this uh this should work
[1:10] out uh hopefully by the will of the lord
[1:13] um this will work out okay i'm not sure
[1:15] if it's gonna stream right or not
[1:17] um it's just saying it's not receiving
[1:20] enough
[1:21] video um we're just gonna try and see
[1:24] what happens so
[1:25] i'm not sure what else to do but we'll
[1:27] go to the lord in prayer now
[1:28] uh there's obviously prayer requests i
[1:30] haven't gotten any this morning with all
[1:32] the
[1:33] chaos and things that's been going on
[1:34] and the uncertainty of what was
[1:36] happening but i'm sure all of us have
[1:38] needs we all have
[1:40] situations in our lives and prayer
[1:41] requests that we have on our hearts
[1:43] uh obviously appreciate your prayers for
[1:46] our family
[1:47] all of us are doing just fine uh i can
[1:49] imagine joel's reaction when he was told
[1:51] he was positive
[1:52] what i didn't i feel fine
[1:56] so uh he probably as surprised as the
[1:59] rest of us
[2:00] uh thought it was just a formality and i
[2:02] honestly uh honestly in my heart of
[2:05] hearts i still honestly believe that
[2:07] this was a
[2:08] false positive we've already heard of so
[2:11] many times where people have false
[2:13] positives and
[2:14] i think i even mentioned church one time
[2:16] the tesla owner elon musk went
[2:18] had a few little cold symptoms and went
[2:20] and got tested four times
[2:22] in one day two tests came back positive
[2:24] two tests came back negative
[2:26] uh so in this world there's only one
[2:30] certainty and that's jesus christ that's
[2:33] god in his word that is the only
[2:34] uncertainty
[2:36] it seems strange too because yesterday
[2:38] uh when i was
[2:39] uh finishing up what the lord had put on
[2:42] my heart for today
[2:43] uh being a in a live service that
[2:48] many of the two or three of the
[2:50] scriptures i went to and i think maybe
[2:51] even the quote i pulled up
[2:53] is from uncertain sound oh it seemed
[2:56] kind of appropriate
[2:58] uh from the messages that i went through
[3:00] yesterday and
[3:02] uh what's happening today everything is
[3:04] just so uncertain but
[3:06] i truly believe we're all well we're all
[3:08] fine sonja's sitting right there she's
[3:09] doing fine i'm doing fine
[3:11] and i thought well if i can figure this
[3:13] out and get this right the lord put
[3:15] something on my heart to give for you
[3:16] today
[3:17] it will take a few minutes in this
[3:19] streaming so again
[3:20] appreciate your prayers for joel and
[3:22] their families act tabitha you know
[3:24] enough of course us uh they can't
[3:27] for the life of them figure maybe where
[3:29] they got it because tabitha joel and
[3:31] emma stay home almost all the time
[3:33] uh they go out once in a while but they
[3:35] went out friday to get tested when they
[3:37] got tested over here close to us they
[3:39] came over and spent the day with sonia
[3:41] and i came home from work and
[3:42] uh spent the rest of the day with them
[3:44] so we were together and
[3:46] uh we're fine i don't
[3:49] i really truly in my heart of hearts
[3:51] don't believe that there's any coven
[3:53] but anyway uh again just to be safe
[3:56] precautious
[3:57] and appreciate your indulgence and your
[3:59] prayers um
[4:01] also very dear friend of mine uh this
[4:03] past week
[4:04] um his little their little boy
[4:08] uh went out in the snow to play uh with
[4:10] his mother and
[4:13] i remember holding his mother in my arms
[4:15] right after she was born
[4:16] and uh anyway she uh she has her own
[4:19] child now
[4:20] and they went out in the snow to play at
[4:22] snowdon north carolina for a little bit
[4:24] and they went outside to play in the
[4:25] snow and they came back in
[4:27] taking his boots off somehow he got away
[4:30] slip
[4:30] fell landed wrong and broke his leg uh
[4:34] i he's a little over a year i think i
[4:36] don't think he's a year and a half yet
[4:37] but he's very young but we sure
[4:39] appreciate your prayers
[4:40] his name is austin their last name is
[4:42] smith so
[4:44] you could remember them in prayer i know
[4:45] they would appreciate it he had to go
[4:47] through
[4:47] fortunately by the grace of god he
[4:49] didn't have to have surgery but they do
[4:50] have a cast on him from his waist down
[4:53] and a little fellow's really active so
[4:56] just please pray for them if you would
[4:57] it just just god would touch it heal it
[4:59] and
[5:00] it would be healed perfectly and quickly
[5:03] so
[5:03] i appreciate your prayer for that again
[5:05] all of us i know we have prayer requests
[5:07] so

[6:01] this opportunity
[6:03] once again lord just to speak something
[6:05] from your word just to open the pages of

[7:17] that's upon the hearts of your people
[7:19] here today
[7:20] we give you thanks and praise for all in
[7:21] the name of the lord jesus christ
[7:23] amen amen god bless you we'll probably
[7:27] not be
[7:27] very long today uh
[7:30] but again just a couple of thoughts that
[7:32] uh i thought the lord gave me
[7:34] i want to talk about the just the simple
[7:37] thought of the word value
[7:39] uh value it it came to my mind my heart
[7:42] yesterday
[7:43] and um it it's quite a
[7:46] thought to think with everything that's
[7:48] going on today and as i said
[7:50] i'm not going to spoil it but it's a
[7:52] it'll be a good segue into next week's
[7:55] sermon too but
[7:56] the the word value came to me and and
[7:59] what do people value today
[8:01] what what do people put value on
[8:04] what is valuable to people today you
[8:08] know we have
[8:08] wholesale values we have values that are
[8:11] important to
[8:13] the population in general but once you
[8:15] boil it down to individuals those
[8:18] individuals have their own personal
[8:20] values that they put on things
[8:22] and it seems like to me that the
[8:24] devaluation of the human
[8:26] the devaluation of the human soul and
[8:29] the devaluation of the importance of
[8:31] having jesus
[8:32] christ is has gotten to quite a
[8:36] a place in a country that we call a
[8:38] christian nation
[8:39] um we still call it that i guess we do
[8:42] i'm not sure that that's
[8:43] actually accurate anymore but um we live
[8:46] in it and we still have
[8:47] the religious freedoms that many
[8:49] countries don't have and i'm very
[8:51] thankful to the lord for that
[8:53] but the value that's put on things and
[8:55] the devaluation of things
[8:57] but um with that thought in mind let's
[9:00] read our first scripture here
[9:02] it's matthew chapter 10 and you've read
[9:05] it many times but again it's just a
[9:07] simple thought i guess
[9:08] uh in this little minutes a few minutes
[9:10] that the lord gives to put together
[9:12] and uh just trust it be a help and a
[9:14] blessing to you today
[9:15] but let's begin with matthew 10 verse 26
[9:19] matthew 10 verse 26 jesus says
[9:22] fear them not therefore for there is
[9:25] nothing
[9:25] covered that shall not be revealed now
[9:28] if that's not a prominent
[9:29] scripture of the day i don't know what
[9:32] and hid
[9:33] that shall not be known what i tell you
[9:36] in darkness that speak ye
[9:38] in light and what you hear in the ear
[9:40] that preachy upon the housetops
[9:43] and fear not them which can kill the
[9:45] body
[9:46] but are not able to kill the soul but
[9:49] rather fear him
[9:50] who is able to destroy both soul and
[9:53] body
[9:54] in hell now that puts a great
[9:56] perspective on a lot of the fear that
[9:58] goes on today
[9:59] a lot of the fear that people are under
[10:01] today a lot of the fear that we're
[10:03] finding
[10:03] from last week's sermon from the
[10:05] government and from the media
[10:07] from the medical world and from the
[10:08] scientific world and from all those
[10:10] things
[10:11] i didn't mean to devalue medicine i
[10:14] didn't mean to devalue the doctor
[10:17] but we'll talk about that maybe the lord
[10:19] would next week i got home i'll just be
[10:21] honest i got home last week
[10:22] thinking that uh i'd covered revelation
[10:25] 13 uh
[10:26] appropriately or thoroughly and
[10:29] apparently i did
[10:30] because the lord began to speak to me
[10:31] about some other things so
[10:33] but again i didn't want to do that over
[10:34] the stream here today so
[10:36] lord willing we'll do that next week but
[10:38] the value but i thought this was
[10:40] quite outstanding especially when it
[10:41] spoke about the fear it spoke about the
[10:44] things that are being hid today
[10:46] the things that are under cover uh
[10:48] that's going to be revealed
[10:50] it's going to be made known amen this
[10:53] country the way it's going
[10:55] is only going to be revealed however at
[10:58] a time
[10:59] when it's not relevant because this
[11:02] country this world is going to an
[11:04] apostasy it's going into
[11:06] armageddon so it's not going to be
[11:08] relevant once those things come to light
[11:10] they will not be relevant anymore of
[11:12] course during the tribulation and
[11:14] armageddon the bride's going to be gone
[11:15] we're not going to care
[11:17] so now we know that when will they be
[11:19] made light those things that'll be
[11:21] relevant when they're made light
[11:22] is when they're relevant at the judgment
[11:25] seat at the white throne judgment that's
[11:27] when they'll be
[11:28] relevant in all darkness all hidden
[11:30] things will come out
[11:32] and be made known those things are not
[11:33] under the blood amen things that are on
[11:35] the blood
[11:36] will never be remembered by god anymore
[11:38] period but those that are not and the
[11:40] shyster and the sinister things that go
[11:43] on
[11:44] in the world today they will be they
[11:45] will be made known and what he's saying
[11:47] here is don't fear that
[11:48] don't fear that don't fear those that
[11:50] can even kill you or put your body in a
[11:52] grave
[11:53] but fear him now notice he says here he
[11:56] says what i um
[11:58] hear them not fear them not therefore
[12:02] amen which can kill the body fear
[12:05] them feel not fear not them that are
[12:07] able to kill a body but
[12:08] are not able to kill the soul but rather
[12:11] fear
[12:12] him i notice he said first he said don't
[12:14] fear
[12:15] them but he said fear him well it goes
[12:18] from them to him
[12:20] well who are them those are those around
[12:22] you or
[12:23] satan and all of his minions but who is
[12:25] him that is god
[12:26] amen fear him fear god reverence god
[12:29] which they will destroy both
[12:30] soul and body and hell are not two
[12:33] sparrows sold for a farthing
[12:35] and one of them excuse me here
[12:38] and a farthing just to tell you is just
[12:41] worth a couple of cent
[12:42] basically the bible one one to two
[12:44] pennies something like that
[12:46] um is is a farthing and two sparrows
[12:49] sold for
[12:50] one barley two sparrows one farley
[12:54] and one of them shall not fall on the
[12:56] ground one not two
[12:57] without your father so god cares about
[13:01] that
[13:01] very sparrow even though two sparrows
[13:03] won't bring but a farthie
[13:05] so we're finding out here that the value
[13:08] that
[13:08] that people put on things is not the
[13:10] same value that
[13:12] god puts on things or the things that
[13:14] are put value upon by humans are not the
[13:17] things that god
[13:18] puts that value on amen notice that that
[13:21] variance here he's telling us
[13:23] see the the world would not care much
[13:26] for the sparrow
[13:28] so much so that two of them would be
[13:30] sold for a penny or two
[13:32] but god values him so much that when one
[13:35] sparrow falls
[13:36] he knows about it it's important to him
[13:39] all of life is important to him we'll
[13:42] get to that in a minute let's finish
[13:43] this
[13:45] he said but the very hairs of your head
[13:48] are old numbers so even the hair is
[13:49] valuable
[13:51] to god i think a lot of us feel that way
[13:54] too but
[13:56] even the hair is valuable to god you
[13:58] haven't lost one praise the lord fear ye
[14:00] not therefore
[14:01] year of more value than many sparrows
[14:05] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[14:07] before men
[14:08] him will i confess also before my father
[14:11] which is in heaven now we found a value
[14:15] god put a value jesus speaking here puts
[14:18] a value
[14:19] on a farthing on a sparrow he puts that
[14:22] on there
[14:23] realizing and trying to contrast that
[14:26] the man
[14:26] says the sparrow's only worth this but i
[14:29] say the sparrow is worth this
[14:31] so then where does it equal out or where
[14:34] does it matter where does the
[14:36] determination of a human draw value from
[14:40] where do they decide um
[14:43] why is the diamond worth millions of
[14:46] dollars
[14:47] and the rock in my backyard is not worth
[14:48] picking up
[14:50] it's not even worth bending over for uh
[14:53] why is uh certain elements in the world
[14:56] so much more value but because
[14:58] people put value on those things but the
[15:01] value that i'm talking about is not the
[15:03] value that
[15:04] people put on things but the value that
[15:06] god puts on things
[15:08] the thing that matters the most is what
[15:10] god looks at the most
[15:12] now again the value that people have of
[15:15] jesus in their lives a godly life for
[15:17] living a god in life and
[15:18] and i understand and it's good people
[15:21] say they want to accept jesus as their
[15:22] savior and they should and that's
[15:24] that's wonderful we should lead in
[15:27] anybody and everybody that we can to
[15:28] jesus christ
[15:30] uh that's important but the most
[15:32] important thing is
[15:33] has god accepted you that's the most
[15:35] important thing
[15:36] the value that we put on it now the
[15:38] acceptance that we have of jesus christ
[15:41] is going to depend on our actions
[15:42] towards him
[15:43] we say we believe in jesus we say we
[15:46] accept jesus
[15:47] but in that do we actually live the life
[15:50] that jesus would call us to live do we
[15:52] actually
[15:52] live the life and produce the fruits
[15:54] that the bible calls for us to produce
[15:57] that'll show whether or not you've
[15:58] accepted jesus it'll show whether or not
[16:00] he's accepted you
[16:02] because on your own you can't produce
[16:04] that but your
[16:05] your effort your your desire to want to
[16:08] live that way is there
[16:09] and that's the people that god calls so
[16:11] that value
[16:12] is placed in there uh on the individual
[16:16] what does life come to be valued at
[16:19] today you know the united states is one
[16:21] of the few countries
[16:22] in the world that really holds or used
[16:24] to at least
[16:25] hold the human life in such tremendous
[16:28] value
[16:29] you look at some of these rogue nations
[16:31] and some of these rogue religions and
[16:34] those that are very militant and
[16:37] and and violent uh they can lose a
[16:39] hundred
[16:40] soldiers and they don't seem to really
[16:42] care but they capture
[16:44] one american and it turns the whole
[16:46] country upside down
[16:47] if it gets on television or if it gets
[16:50] in the news
[16:51] and you see this one person and of
[16:53] course it happened a lot in the last
[16:54] administration and all you knew is this
[16:56] this rogue group was cutting off
[16:59] americans heads and things like that and
[17:01] but they know that they know how how
[17:05] we value that human life how we value
[17:08] someone that's that's in this world not
[17:10] just an american but in this world we
[17:12] value that person's life and how much it
[17:15] means
[17:16] because it's still a christian nation
[17:19] supposed to be
[17:20] but that that part of it is still there
[17:23] that value is still there
[17:25] these people don't value that they could
[17:28] lose a hundred of theirs to gain
[17:30] one of ours and they don't seem to care
[17:34] weak it seems like a lot of times
[17:36] americans care more about that life
[17:38] than they do of course you know i they
[17:41] believe that
[17:42] in their religion that when they die
[17:44] they're going to paradise in a lap of
[17:46] so many virgins whatever their thought
[17:48] of it is i
[17:49] i'm not relevant to me but anyway
[17:52] uh so they feel like that's that i mean
[17:55] uh
[17:55] and and you know paul said in our
[17:57] religion to
[17:58] to live as christ to die is gain so
[18:02] uh when we go we know it's gain but we
[18:04] we don't lose the value
[18:06] of that life and how much that life
[18:08] means to us
[18:09] how much it means to each uh a a
[18:12] christian an individual and how
[18:15] important and how precious it is but
[18:17] what do people
[18:17] think are important today what is
[18:20] important today what is
[18:22] important to you uh whoever you are
[18:24] watching this today
[18:25] you may stream it now you may archive it
[18:28] later what's important to you
[18:29] what matters to you uh what matters to
[18:33] you
[18:33] should be what matters to god if you're
[18:35] a christian what matters to you should
[18:36] be what matters to god
[18:38] but what value people put on things
[18:40] today people put value
[18:42] on their homes people put great value on
[18:44] their cars people
[18:45] people strive and struggle and and kill
[18:48] themselves to make an extra buck
[18:51] um so what's that value what is the
[18:54] value of a dollar
[18:55] well the dollar can change in value
[18:59] you can look up today what the value of
[19:02] gold is
[19:02] you can look it up tomorrow and it'll
[19:04] probably differ silver
[19:06] precious metals you can look them up
[19:08] today look them up tomorrow they'll be
[19:09] different
[19:10] um eight years ago six seven eight years
[19:14] ago copper was so valuable
[19:17] by the market values of our country that
[19:19] in the world that
[19:20] that people were stealing copper out of
[19:23] air conditioning
[19:24] systems all around the city just to take
[19:27] them and get
[19:27] get an extra dollar or two but now
[19:30] copper's not that
[19:31] valuable anymore and all the thefts quit
[19:33] because it wasn't worth it
[19:35] uh so it's the so what is that what is
[19:38] the importance of value people put
[19:40] value on their spouses on their families
[19:43] uh on their uh relatives and friends
[19:48] they put value on some people put value
[19:50] on um their their jobs and
[19:53] uh their next meal or their next
[19:56] paycheck
[19:56] or or whatever but but the value the
[19:59] point of the value is
[20:01] um what the way god sees that value and
[20:05] the way the human
[20:06] sees that value is totally different
[20:10] the things that we value so much a lot
[20:12] of times in life is really irrelevant to
[20:14] god in a lot of cases
[20:15] it really is not important but
[20:18] we understand through the bible what is
[20:21] important to god
[20:22] look at one of the most important things
[20:24] and seems to be one of the things that's
[20:26] lost
[20:27] a lot in today's society one of the
[20:29] things that god puts
[20:31] a great importance on staying in matthew
[20:34] chapter 16 let's go to verse 24.
[20:39] again very familiar scripture but uh
[20:42] let's read here
[20:44] 24-28 then jesus said unto his disciples
[20:47] this any man will come after me let him
[20:49] deny himself
[20:51] take up his cross and follow me now what
[20:54] value is god putting to that sentence
[20:57] deny yourself take up his cross
[21:01] and follow him amen where's the value
[21:04] god's putting on it now what did these
[21:08] disciples think that they were going to
[21:10] get by following jesus
[21:12] what does anybody think they're going to
[21:13] get from following jesus
[21:15] why do people accept jesus as their
[21:17] savior why do people accept jesus go why
[21:20] do people go to church
[21:21] what do they expect to get from it is it
[21:23] something that they're
[21:24] they're doing because they're expecting
[21:26] something in return
[21:28] are they doing this because they're
[21:30] expecting uh
[21:31] prosperity or blessings well what
[21:34] happens when those prosperity
[21:36] blessings don't come or they don't come
[21:38] in the way you think they should
[21:39] or the the opposite happens and
[21:41] something happens in your life or your
[21:43] family
[21:44] but if you lose a loved one or something
[21:45] god tests us
[21:47] to see so why do people even follow
[21:50] jesus
[21:51] what's the point are we expecting him
[21:54] to take uh and make our lives a
[21:57] bunch of uh puppy dog tales and
[22:00] and smooth paths of rose petals and
[22:05] that's that's not the way it is that's
[22:06] why he said take up your cross
[22:09] and follow me we know what that cross is
[22:11] that crosses death
[22:12] self-denial and follow jesus so what's
[22:15] the value
[22:19] 25th verse for whosoever will save his
[22:21] life shall lose it
[22:23] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[22:26] shall find it
[22:27] well that speaks so tremendous to today
[22:30] you lose your life for
[22:31] his sake you'll find it
[22:34] if you find your life or hold your life
[22:36] there and deny christ
[22:38] you'll lose your life so doing for
[22:41] christ
[22:42] is what's the important thing that's
[22:44] where the value should be placed
[22:46] even above your own life the value of
[22:49] serving
[22:49] jesus christ should even be above your
[22:52] own
[22:53] life because he says if you lose it
[22:56] in finding me you will find it where is
[22:59] that
[23:00] on the other side so even if you do that
[23:02] in him
[23:03] you still find it 26 first for what is a
[23:08] man profited
[23:09] if he shall gain the whole world and
[23:12] lose his own soul
[23:14] there we go now god's putting another
[23:16] value on something
[23:18] this value he's putting on a man's soul
[23:21] he's putting
[23:22] on a man's soul the weight of the entire
[23:24] world
[23:25] the entire value of the world of course
[23:28] what is the world worth the world
[23:31] cosmos is not worth a penny in about it
[23:36] the world that we're standing on created
[23:38] by god
[23:39] is is of great value
[23:42] it's a creation of god all of god's
[23:45] creation is of value
[23:47] but notice the monetary value that god
[23:50] is putting
[23:51] jesus again speaking putting on a human
[23:54] soul now as much as people want to
[23:57] discard someone
[23:59] or discredit them or put their opinion
[24:02] or their
[24:02] their voice aside everybody has a soul
[24:07] and brother branham tells us now even
[24:09] jesus is saying here what would a man
[24:11] gain
[24:12] what would a man profit if he gained the
[24:14] whole world and lose his own soul or
[24:16] what shall a man give in exchange
[24:18] for his soul unfortunately it seems like
[24:21] a lot of people are selling their
[24:22] birthrights their soul
[24:24] out for very little today brother graham
[24:26] said
[24:27] elvis sold his for a fleet of cadillacs
[24:30] uh i think he said that in um
[24:32] an exclamation we don't know that that's
[24:35] absolutely true but
[24:36] uh that's what he said uh
[24:39] but people are selling their souls for a
[24:41] lot less today
[24:43] a lot less even a soul that god put
[24:47] as worth the entire value of the world
[24:50] brother brown tells us the soul is worth
[24:52] 10 million worlds
[24:54] he says 10 000 some places he says 10
[24:56] million some places i say 10 million
[24:59] because i think the whole point of the
[25:00] subject is that your soul is invaluable
[25:04] you cannot put a price on it now you
[25:06] can't put a price on the harvest down
[25:08] the street you can't put a price on the
[25:10] thief that robbed somebody last night
[25:11] you can't put a price on the president's
[25:14] you can't put a price on anybody's
[25:16] every human soul is worth 10 million
[25:19] worlds not just yours
[25:21] not just your family not just your
[25:23] church every soul
[25:25] every soul is worth 10 minutes worth
[25:27] every life
[25:28] is precious to god now why is life
[25:31] precious people are exchanging their
[25:34] selves
[25:36] uh for this people don't value
[25:39] themselves
[25:40] or value even their time i i find a lot
[25:43] of times people don't even value their
[25:45] time
[25:46] because people will say well
[25:50] it it it only it only cost you this much
[25:54] effort to do something
[25:55] about how much time did it cost how much
[25:58] of your life
[25:59] went out of your body to pay for that
[26:03] that's a value that's a great value to
[26:06] god that's why
[26:07] every life that's born god writes their
[26:10] name on the book of life
[26:11] not the lamb's book of life but the book
[26:13] of life every life
[26:15] born whether it's from an adulterous
[26:18] parents or whether it's from uh
[26:21] drunkards or or drug addicts no matter
[26:25] what
[26:26] that life is precious to god whether
[26:29] it's born in this right mind or not
[26:31] whether it's born with a horrible
[26:33] disease or not whether it's born
[26:35] where whatever it's precious to god
[26:39] every moment of that life is precious to
[26:42] god and it should be precious to us
[26:44] when i was driving i used to tell people
[26:46] that
[26:48] you know sometimes i drop people short
[26:50] distances long distances and would have
[26:52] conversations and
[26:54] and and the conversation like that would
[26:56] come up and i say
[26:58] but you know your time is worth
[26:59] something when you say well i only have
[27:02] to drive here to get this or so long
[27:04] but but how much time are you spending
[27:06] to do it
[27:07] because your time is worth money your
[27:10] time is
[27:10] valuable so all that time matters that
[27:13] life
[27:14] matters it matters to god if it matters
[27:17] to god it should matter to us
[27:19] every one of them no matter who they are
[27:21] everyone's opinion
[27:22] everyone's uh um
[27:26] that's i believe that's why the founding
[27:27] fathers put the first amendment in our
[27:29] constitution
[27:30] the first amendment to amend the
[27:32] constitution to say that we all have a
[27:34] right
[27:35] to express our opinions peacefully all
[27:37] of us do
[27:38] it doesn't happen that way very much
[27:40] anymore because
[27:42] if you're of a certain opinion or you're
[27:45] of a certain
[27:46] uh group i'll just say it without
[27:48] getting political today
[27:50] if you're of a certain group they don't
[27:52] want to hear your voice
[27:53] if you don't say what they want you to
[27:55] want you to say what they want to hear
[27:57] your opinion is nothing well what that
[28:00] does is that devalues that person's life
[28:04] in that person's eyes that other
[28:06] person's life is devalued
[28:09] because their thoughts and opinions
[28:11] don't matter
[28:13] well that's where you get slavery from
[28:15] that's where you get communism from
[28:17] that's where you get oppression from is
[28:20] from
[28:20] people who don't believe another group
[28:23] of people's opinions
[28:24] matter because when your opinion doesn't
[28:27] matter
[28:28] when your thoughts and feelings don't
[28:30] matter
[28:31] then you know you're you're of no value
[28:33] to that person
[28:34] and you're so human at that point
[28:38] that's sad but it seems to be that's
[28:40] exactly
[28:41] where this place is headed or this
[28:43] country where this world is headed
[28:45] to a devaluation of a person's life
[28:49] a devaluation of a person's soul
[28:53] that's of the utmost importance god said
[28:56] what would a man exchange
[28:58] for his soul what is worth this world
[29:02] going to hell for what
[29:05] now i imagine if you told that question
[29:07] to a thousand people a thousand people
[29:09] would probably tell you nothing
[29:10] and they would go live their lives just
[29:12] exactly the way they lived them before
[29:14] sending their souls right directly to
[29:16] hell they're exchanging that
[29:18] for what a lot of people it's not worth
[29:22] 10 million it's more valuable than 10
[29:24] million worlds
[29:25] jesus said the entire wealth of the
[29:27] world
[29:28] but at the point of that that jesus
[29:30] making it's the same point brother
[29:31] branham made brother branham's not
[29:33] crossing the word
[29:34] he's just saying the same thing jesus
[29:35] said jesus saying it's invaluable
[29:38] that's the whole point jesus is making
[29:40] it's like he told peter
[29:42] when peter said how many times should i
[29:43] forgive my brother
[29:47] [Music]
[29:49] seven times a day seven times how many
[29:51] times should i forgive my brother
[29:52] jesus said not seven but seventy times
[29:55] seven
[29:56] four hundred and ninety if you wanna do
[29:58] the math a day
[30:00] that's a lot of forgiveness for one
[30:02] person to another person
[30:03] in a day 490 times how many times
[30:07] are we willing to forgive uh forgiveness
[30:10] of the great importance not just
[30:11] first your fear giving but for you too
[30:13] but again that's a
[30:14] that's in my book that's a whole another
[30:16] subject but the point of that is
[30:18] the value that's placed on it people
[30:21] don't put
[30:22] value on that because they don't see it
[30:24] as important
[30:25] they think that their car that they
[30:27] drive is more important than that the
[30:30] house they live in
[30:31] is more important that the amount of
[30:32] money they make the biggest
[30:34] the the size of their bank account is
[30:36] more important than that
[30:38] friend there's nothing more important
[30:40] than your soul
[30:42] and your standing with jesus christ
[30:44] there's nothing more important
[30:46] than looking at the person next to you
[30:48] to looking at the person across the
[30:50] street to looking at the person at your
[30:52] job
[30:52] at the supermarket on the begging on the
[30:55] corner wherever you go
[30:56] that that person has a soul worth 10
[30:59] million worlds
[31:01] now they may not value it to the point
[31:03] that you do
[31:04] but their opinion of themselves should
[31:07] not shape your opinion of them
[31:09] your opinion should be molded by the by
[31:12] christ in the word
[31:13] not by them or anybody else the world
[31:17] might devalue them
[31:18] but they're not of less value they're
[31:21] just as important as any of the rest
[31:23] and that value is just as important so
[31:26] the exchange rate
[31:28] um you talk about exchange and exchange
[31:31] rate
[31:32] of going from one country to a next from
[31:34] a from a ruby to a dollar or from the
[31:36] uh the euro to the dollar the canadian
[31:39] whatever
[31:40] the exchange rate the peso to the dollar
[31:43] my goodness is what 16 000 pesos to a
[31:45] dollar or something today i don't know
[31:47] it's crazy amount uh because their
[31:49] dollar their peso is so devalued in
[31:51] mexico
[31:52] but that exchange rate isn't isn't a
[31:56] very profitable deal
[31:57] but what about the exchange rate of
[31:59] losing your soul
[32:01] the exchanging of your soul going to
[32:04] hell
[32:05] the exchanging of your soul for anything
[32:07] that you can have in this world
[32:09] for anything that you could obtain for
[32:11] anything that you could work for
[32:12] fight for count of value we all live in
[32:15] this world
[32:16] we all eat we all have well most of us
[32:19] have a place to live
[32:21] most of us eat we have to eat or die
[32:24] we all have the things of life that we
[32:26] have and that's
[32:28] okay and there's nothing wrong sweat of
[32:29] our brows we work we earn money we
[32:31] provide for ourselves our families
[32:33] that's absolutely godly uh that's right
[32:36] that's righteous but when you start
[32:38] putting a greater value on that and what
[32:40] it really is
[32:42] then it becomes a detriment of your
[32:44] relationship with jesus christ because
[32:46] then you're placing that in a
[32:48] in a place that's above him now anything
[32:51] that's above him like we said last week
[32:54] in the scripture in revelations talks
[32:56] about names of blasphemy any
[32:58] blasphemous name is something that
[33:00] removes jesus christ or devalues
[33:03] jesus christ we look at these people
[33:06] that are around the world today and
[33:08] don't think nothing about killing
[33:10] another human
[33:11] or don't think anything about talking
[33:13] bad about that person which is murder
[33:16] hating one another which is murder
[33:19] or devaluing or something as simple as
[33:22] devaluing that person's feelings or
[33:24] opinions
[33:25] it's the same thing it's the same
[33:27] opinion you're devaluing that person
[33:29] down to a place that is less than human
[33:32] because you're saying they don't have a
[33:33] right to speak because they're not
[33:35] saying what i want them to say
[33:38] when you date you when you do devalue
[33:40] that
[33:41] you bring them down as a human again
[33:43] that's the beginning of slavery
[33:45] you think someone is less of a human
[33:47] than you are
[33:48] to where they're worthy to be enslaved
[33:51] it's the same thing
[33:53] it's just verbage instead of physical
[33:55] whips and
[33:56] and and physical action
[33:59] but it's the same it's the same
[34:00] principle dominating
[34:03] communism dominating uh nicolaitanism in
[34:06] the spiritual world
[34:08] dominating one person over the other
[34:10] person because that person has been
[34:12] devalued
[34:13] to where they don't have the
[34:15] intelligence
[34:16] or or the spiritual relevance to be able
[34:19] to
[34:20] get god or understand god or follow god
[34:22] or live for god or read his word or be a
[34:25] christian
[34:26] you have to do it because somebody else
[34:28] says they are
[34:29] well friend you only are if god says you
[34:31] are
[34:32] and that's what that's what he values
[34:34] and that's the value that he places on
[34:36] it
[34:37] which is the most important thing to us
[34:40] the world looks at something called
[34:41] supply and demand
[34:43] i'm gonna read one more scripture here
[34:44] we'll close in a minute but they put uh
[34:48] a terminology on the things that we
[34:50] value and place and value
[34:52] uh it's called supply and demand the
[34:54] more somebody wants something
[34:56] the more it tends to be worth when
[34:59] you're a child
[35:00] your your your principles and your
[35:03] values
[35:04] change uh from an infant to a grown
[35:07] adult
[35:09] in most cases young kids don't really
[35:12] care
[35:12] about where the money comes from or how
[35:15] hard mom or daddy works to earn it
[35:18] they just want a new bike or they just
[35:20] want a new toy or they just
[35:21] want to make sure they have food and a
[35:22] place to live that's all they care about
[35:25] the values change drastically but in our
[35:28] supply and demand
[35:30] economy our demand
[35:33] is what uh well the supply to but the
[35:35] demand
[35:36] the supply can be one but if nobody
[35:38] wants that one then that one is
[35:40] worthless
[35:41] now you could have a million of them and
[35:43] nobody wants them
[35:44] that millions worth nothing uh you could
[35:47] have
[35:47] a trillion of them but if two trillion
[35:50] people want it
[35:51] uh is worth twice what somebody the
[35:54] value somebody would put on it because
[35:56] twice as many people wanted as what
[35:57] their hours
[35:58] exist so it's the supply and demand
[36:01] that supply and demand puts that value i
[36:04] used to collect why i still have them my
[36:05] baseball cards
[36:07] from when i was a kid played baseball
[36:09] and a little kid and uh
[36:11] these little pieces of cardboard with a
[36:13] picture on it
[36:14] may be signed maybe not uh depending on
[36:17] how many there are and how many people
[36:18] want them
[36:19] a little bitty square piece of cardboard
[36:21] can be worth thousands of dollars to
[36:23] people
[36:24] thousands of dollars for a little square
[36:26] piece of cardboard
[36:28] but as long as the cardboard's not worth
[36:29] that you take it to a recycle they
[36:31] wouldn't give you a penny for it
[36:33] probably because this piece of cardboard
[36:34] is not worth recycling we recycle for
[36:36] free
[36:37] we give everybody plastic paper and uh
[36:40] glass for free you couldn't get a penny
[36:42] for that little square piece but you put
[36:44] a
[36:44] certain picture on it and you have a lot
[36:46] of people want it
[36:48] it becomes invaluable at that point it
[36:50] works thousands of dollars
[36:51] people pay for it it's
[36:55] kind of strange to me when you really
[36:56] think about it but that that's the value
[36:59] that
[36:59] somebody's willing to place on it so if
[37:01] god values your soul
[37:03] as worth the entire world we'll just say
[37:06] what the bible says
[37:07] the entire value of the world if he
[37:09] places your soul in the entire value of
[37:11] the world
[37:13] then how precious is that to him
[37:17] what does that mean to him see
[37:21] maybe not to other people but to him and
[37:24] that's the value that we look
[37:25] for and value that we want to talk about
[37:28] look at this in micah the book of micah
[37:32] chapter 6
[37:34] the book of micah chapter six uh verse
[37:37] six will start at
[37:38] you got your bibles there and you want
[37:40] to read just take a moment but
[37:42] in micah chapter six some people may not
[37:44] know where mike gets one of those
[37:45] uh latter prophets right before you get
[37:47] to the new testament
[37:50] um and we'll read from the
[37:53] chapter six actually the book of micah
[37:55] has a lot of good teachings in it but
[37:57] uh the verse six now it says wherewith
[38:01] shall i come before the lord and bow
[38:03] myself
[38:04] before the high god now this is all
[38:06] questions it's all questions mike is
[38:08] asking
[38:08] very very um he read the book of micah
[38:12] uh it's it's just it's really incredibly
[38:15] i want to say intelligent very spiritual
[38:18] uh intelligent person a very astute
[38:21] and had a lot of very poignant questions
[38:25] answers wisdom
[38:26] wisdom but the questions here he's
[38:29] asking questions
[38:30] wherewith shall i come before the lord
[38:32] and bow myself before them
[38:34] before the high god shall i come before
[38:37] him with burnt offerings with calves of
[38:39] a year old
[38:41] will the lord be pleased with thousands
[38:44] of rams
[38:45] or with ten thousands of rivers of oil
[38:48] shall i give him my firstborn for my
[38:51] transgression
[38:52] the fruit of my body for the sin of my
[38:55] soul
[38:56] he has showed me old man what is good
[39:00] and what does the lord require of thee
[39:03] but to do justly and to love
[39:07] mercy and to walk humbly
[39:10] with thy god oh that's a
[39:13] that's just wisdom to me like i said
[39:15] micah and the wisdom that he had here in
[39:17] this statement
[39:19] something of course that was lost in
[39:20] saul uh
[39:23] saw thought that the sacrifices and and
[39:25] the burnt offerings meant more to god
[39:27] than his obedience
[39:29] uh well micah is certainly correct in
[39:32] that
[39:32] say well i could give rivers of oil i
[39:36] could give
[39:36] ten thousands of animals and sacrifices
[39:39] i could give my firstborn
[39:41] of the fruit of my body for the sin of
[39:43] my soul
[39:45] but what does god require what is the
[39:48] requirement of god
[39:49] it was a great thing back in the
[39:52] in the early church ages in the dark
[39:54] ages and
[39:56] people would do their pentance and crawl
[39:58] on their knees and glass and beat
[39:59] themselves with cat of ninetales
[40:02] and all the things that they would do
[40:03] but that wasn't required by god
[40:06] that's required by man man set that up
[40:09] not as a scriptural
[40:10] godly requirement but a man's
[40:12] requirement god doesn't require that
[40:15] god's not looking for human sacrifice
[40:18] understand jesus christ gave his life
[40:20] and shed his blood
[40:22] that we all might be redeemed and come
[40:25] to him
[40:26] as pure holy righteous what does god
[40:29] require
[40:30] like it the old testament again let's
[40:32] read
[40:33] he has shown me o man what is good
[40:36] and what does the lord require thee to
[40:39] do justly
[40:41] to do justly to be just honest
[40:44] reputable before men before people
[40:48] it doesn't mean you're going to be
[40:49] perfect it doesn't mean you're going to
[40:50] do everything right
[40:51] but you're going to be honest about it
[40:53] you're going to be just about it you're
[40:54] going to be
[40:55] truthful about it you know brother brown
[40:57] said when he
[40:58] uh couldn't pay for this medicine from
[41:00] this doctor he said doctor i need this
[41:02] medicine real bad but i don't have the
[41:03] money to pay of course a whole nother
[41:04] day
[41:06] uh doctors and people were different
[41:07] back then the doctors so that's okay
[41:10] uh billy no problem and but he said but
[41:14] you know brother brown supply i owe the
[41:16] debts i'll pay if it's a quarter week
[41:18] i'll pay if i can't pay i'll tell you
[41:20] see it's just being honest it's just
[41:23] being reputable seeing
[41:24] and being just about the about those
[41:27] things
[41:28] live justly and do uh
[41:31] and to love mercy to walk humbly with
[41:34] god
[41:35] love mercy and walk humbly with god now
[41:38] that seems to be one of the greatest
[41:40] things missing today is humility but
[41:42] uh it's still relevant it's still
[41:44] prevalent it's
[41:45] it's still important and meaningful it's
[41:48] still scriptural
[41:49] to be humble to live humbly kind of hard
[41:52] to forgive somebody when you're not
[41:54] humble
[41:54] kind of hard to it's all really easy to
[41:57] hold a grudge when you're not humble
[41:59] it's really easy to get sick when you're
[42:01] not humble too because you're holding
[42:03] all this
[42:03] and mustang and it's all it is really
[42:07] easy to get sick
[42:08] but god says to walk humbly before him
[42:11] that's the things god requires
[42:13] that's not requiring your big mansion
[42:15] god's not requiring your huge bank
[42:17] account god's not requiring your fancy
[42:19] cards or
[42:20] or or anything else he's requiring of
[42:23] those that live
[42:24] justly to love mercy to
[42:27] to to live humbly before him
[42:30] we do those things he'll lead you and
[42:33] guide you into all truth
[42:34] he'll lead you and guide you the way he
[42:36] wants you to live the way he wants to
[42:37] walk
[42:38] things he wants you to do that's the
[42:40] value that god puts on
[42:41] i believe that's the value we should put
[42:43] on it the requirement of god's value
[42:45] see a value has a requirement
[42:49] if you put a value on something there's
[42:50] a requirement to that value
[42:52] well the value god has put on your soul
[42:54] is a whole
[42:56] world the entire monetary value of the
[43:00] world
[43:01] so what's that requirement requirement
[43:04] of that
[43:05] is to live humbly before him to love
[43:08] mercy
[43:09] and to live justly that covers
[43:12] people it covers you and it covers him
[43:17] that trifecta amen most importantly him
[43:21] but us too and other people live justly
[43:25] that's the things that god requires so
[43:27] the requirement that god puts on that
[43:29] value
[43:30] is very simple it's not hard it's not
[43:32] complicated
[43:33] it's not something you have to you have
[43:35] to kill yourself to obtain or earn
[43:37] it's something that god gives it does
[43:39] that is of the greatest
[43:41] value amen that is of the greatest value
[43:44] that gets
[43:45] what what do people think
[43:48] what are people's opinions what is the
[43:51] value that people put on things today
[43:54] people will fill up a sports arena by
[43:56] the tens of thousands
[43:59] and yet um hard to even get a handful of
[44:02] chirps sometimes
[44:04] they'll fill up
[44:07] political events or or restaurants by
[44:11] the hundreds and thousands and tens and
[44:13] hundreds of thousands
[44:15] and where's the value when it comes to
[44:18] the soul
[44:19] it's more important to make sure and
[44:21] catch the football game on sunday
[44:23] than it is to go to church to put god
[44:26] first
[44:27] what is the greatest value what is going
[44:30] to get you to the place that god's
[44:31] requiring
[44:33] amen that's the requirement that god
[44:35] wants based on the value that he's put
[44:37] on you
[44:38] the value that god's put on your life
[44:39] the value that god's put on your
[44:41] soul people want to devalue it
[44:45] but it's no it's of no less value today
[44:48] than it was when god spoke adam into
[44:50] existence
[44:52] everybody's life no matter who they are
[44:54] bride or not
[44:55] they're of all great value that value
[44:59] that'll that hopefully will get to uh
[45:04] get to next week find a
[45:08] segway in the next week we can
[45:11] understand
[45:12] so when we see these things happening
[45:14] it's very subtle how the enemy does
[45:17] but it's very real it's very subtle you
[45:19] think well
[45:20] it's not it's not that big a deal
[45:22] because uh people won't let this person
[45:25] speak or won't hear their opinion or
[45:27] or whatever but it is of great value
[45:30] it is a tremendous uh loss
[45:34] in our society when people uh
[45:37] won't be near to someone else whatever
[45:40] it is you might end them at it
[45:42] you might uh um
[45:46] disagree fully wholeheartedly disagree
[45:50] but that's okay there's nothing wrong
[45:52] with disagreeing
[45:54] what's wrong is not listening that's
[45:56] what's wrong
[45:58] and that's why this is becoming so
[46:00] tilted in one direction
[46:02] this country especially becoming so
[46:04] tilted in one direction
[46:06] and uh and again lord willem maybe we'll
[46:08] talk about that
[46:09] some more next week but i pray that
[46:12] something was said today
[46:13] to apply to our lives to help us uh on
[46:16] our daily journey
[46:18] um and god god would bless us all with
[46:21] it
[46:22] it makes it makes a difference when we
[46:24] really
[46:25] break it down and understand and really
[46:28] take a moment to think about
[46:29] what really is important and what do
[46:32] i hold a value in my life what is
[46:35] important to me see it makes a
[46:39] difference so
[46:40] i pray the lord bless you somehow pray
[46:42] something was said to bless you
[46:44] in a special way and lord willing i have
[46:46] every intention

[47:11] important
[47:13] the world will try to put value on
[47:15] things that really are
[47:17] unvaluable to you lord they're not
[47:20] valuable to us
[47:22] lord many times of quite insignificance
[47:25] but lord um we know what is the most
[47:28] valuable thing that you've placed and
[47:31] on this earth today the human the human
[47:33] life
[47:34] the human soul lord is of greater value
[47:37] than we could ever

[47:43] and what you speak to us
[47:45] from your word and what you require of
[47:47] us lord through your word

[47:52] not something that you just

[48:00] for it lord so accept us lord again
