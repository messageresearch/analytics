[0:03] good morning Saints god bless you
[0:06] welcome to this beautiful day reach in
[0:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I have
[0:12] you mother's days now you precious
[0:13] mothers out there on you godly mothers
[0:15] that raise your children and the nurture
[0:17] and admonition of God we celebrate this
[0:20] day for for that purpose although every
[0:24] day in my opinion should be a Mother's
[0:26] Day I believe brother Branham even said
[0:27] that and I think most of us would agree
[0:29] every day should be a Mother's Day but
[0:32] it's a day that we set aside in this
[0:33] country for a specific celebration of
[0:36] Mother's Day so happy Mother's Day to
[0:38] you all we love you appreciate you in my
[0:41] opinion that's what keeps the everything
[0:44] together to me the glue of a family as a
[0:47] mother so happy Mother's Day to you
[0:50] today and welcome to the live streaming
[0:52] service again looks like things are
[0:55] starting to loose up a little bit more
[0:56] with the restrictions and the
[0:58] stay-at-home orders so I will see where
[1:02] the Lord goes from here and what happens
[1:04] from this time I still haven't heard
[1:05] from the pastor of the church we went
[1:07] from Pete so just remember that in
[1:10] prayer so sings God's hands God's work
[1:13] he put us there so if we're moving on
[1:15] someplace else and he's got a place for
[1:17] us so I'm not too worried about it but
[1:20] would certainly like to get back to
[1:22] meeting together in person and miss
[1:24] y'all very much and hopefully it'll be
[1:27] very soon as you know we usually have a
[1:30] little trinket or something for the
[1:32] mothers on Mother's Day and the mothers
[1:34] to be even so we're not able to do that
[1:37] today but we love you let we want to let
[1:39] you know how much we really do love you
[1:41] and appreciate you being a part of our
[1:43] church sorry for things going a little
[1:46] bit late today but appreciate you
[1:48] patience and staying with us kind of one
[1:52] of the little things I had there I had
[1:53] sent that in the text was please stand
[1:56] by it just reminded me for a moment
[1:59] my grandmother not my mom but my
[2:01] grandmother my dad said when TV's first
[2:04] came out and they had a TV first one
[2:08] they got they had a lot of problems you
[2:10] know and also many times
[2:12] he would come up and there would go
[2:14] blank or something it's a technical
[2:15] difficulties please stand by and my dad
[2:19] said my mother my grandmother would get
[2:21] up and go stand next to the television
[2:22] because she said please stand by so this
[2:25] is what she would to
[2:27] so hopefully you stood by and hopefully
[2:29] about the grace of God would be a good
[2:33] service to be a blessing to you today so
[2:35] appreciate you being involved in being
[2:37] here with us today we had a few prayer
[2:39] requests to make you known of brother
[2:42] Dennis and text me and wanted us to
[2:45] continue and remember his wife Leah
[2:48] earned her doctor boss are still seeing
[2:51] patients and a couple of those patients
[2:53] have actually tested positive for kovin
[2:55] so please remember continue remember him
[2:57] and her in prayer the Lord would just
[3:01] continue to keep her protected and he
[3:04] also asked a request for peach the lady
[3:07] that he had asked several times the past
[3:09] four it has cancer we got to meet a
[3:12] couple of us brothers got to meet her
[3:14] when we help move some of her furniture
[3:15] and she's in pretty bad state she's
[3:19] going through chemo now but brother
[3:22] Dennis just asked if we could just
[3:24] continue to remember her in prayer who
[3:25] would also continue remember if you
[3:28] would I haven't had a recent update from
[3:30] brother Jewell for name last time I
[3:32] heard he was doing really well remember
[3:34] that in prayer also for brother Dana
[3:36] Thornhill teen you remember that
[3:38] unspoken request if you would and
[3:40] brother Johnny green of course I'm just
[3:42] trusting he's doing well as well I heard
[3:44] anything recently but we're just
[3:47] believing that the Lord is mindful of
[3:48] all of our needs if Tina remembers
[3:50] sister she Lee's brother Harlan and
[3:52] prayer and last week we had the request
[3:55] for sister Priscilla's brother Tony amen
[3:58] so we haven't done distrust in the Lord
[4:00] is mindful of every request and every
[4:01] need so remember those continue to hold
[4:05] them up before you before the Lord in
[4:07] your prayers the effectual fervent
[4:09] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[4:11] so we're just believing that if you have
[4:13] a request on your heart today just keep
[4:16] that on your heart now as we approach
[4:18] the author of the word and just ask him
[4:21] to move upon these requests and bless
[4:23] service today precious Jesus father
[4:27] again we're thankful to be here thankful
[4:30] to have the opportunity Lord even if
[4:31] we're not able to get together in the
[4:33] flesh Lord that we're able to get
[4:35] together in spirit and through this new
[4:39] mechanism this intelligence of man
[4:42] that's created a way to be able to
[4:44] stream or live stream and Lord we can
[4:47] kind of be together that way and I'm so
[4:49] thankful Lord that you helped us to be
[4:52] able to do that Lord we just thank you
[4:54] God for being with us and for helping us
[4:56] through the week and for blessing this
[4:58] day this beautiful day Lord here in
[5:00] Tucson Arizona and another Resurrection

[5:04] Day god I pray that you bless all the
[5:07] precious godly mothers raising their
[5:09] children in the nurture and admonition
[5:10] of God or have raised them in the
[5:12] nurture and admonition of God in the
[5:15] heart of a mother Lord for their
[5:16] children believing in trusting that your
[5:18] hand is upon them and the Lord one day
[5:20] God when all the dust has settled and
[5:23] all the things are done and Lord as
[5:25] brother Brad said the Bibles are stacked
[5:27] the arms are folded Lord will come up to
[5:29] be with you Lord and we'll all be
[5:30] together as a grand family father we
[5:34] thank you God for each one Lord and I
[5:36] pray that your Holy Spirit would move
[5:38] upon every quest and every need Lord I
[5:41] believe probably Lord that hasn't been
[5:44] said but all the mothers have tremendous
[5:47] prayer requests on the hearts for their
[5:48] children and just believing God that
[5:51] your hand this upon them lord I pray
[5:53] that you continue to help the requests
[5:55] and the needs Lord that was mentioned

[5:59] her and God just keep her safe and head
[6:02] your about Lord and protect her from all
[6:04] the germs diseases there are dr. boss
[6:06] Lord we just pray that you granted Lord
[6:09] and again brother Dennis requests for
[6:10] her friend pshh Lord if you don't
[6:13] intervene father it's a pretty dire
[6:15] situation with her this cancer God but
[6:18] knowing that you're still a miracle
[6:20] working God that would perform a miracle
[6:22] even for her right now and Lord every
[6:25] heart in every life and every need and
[6:27] every hand and whatever God may have
[6:29] been upon the hearts of your people
[6:30] today we pray that you would go
[6:33] to every house every living room every
[6:35] place Lord Word this is being played
[6:38] Lord God you would bless them and then
[6:40] your holy anointing would fall fresh
[6:42] even now Lord even where their City God
[6:45] let it move upon each one Lord and just
[6:48] draw us until you Lord make me feel your
[6:51] presence so strong God in the anointing
[6:53] Lord not just here but everywhere a god
[6:56] that anointing would just saturate every
[6:59] one of us and that you would reveal to
[7:01] us today in this word what you'd have us
[7:04] to know God I pray for the people Lord
[7:07] and pray God for our circumstances in
[7:10] situation Lord we believe God that
[7:12] you're mindful of us and that you have a
[7:14] place for us to worship and we're just
[7:16] bonding together believing in faith that
[7:18] you would show and reveal to us where
[7:20] that would be God according to your
[7:22] perfect wheel we thank you for all that
[7:24] you do for us Lord and we commit this
[7:26] remaining part of this service in your
[7:28] hands and pray that you would speak to
[7:30] us now as we committed to you in the
[7:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[7:34] amen amen
[7:37] god bless you I mean we want to go to
[7:39] revivals now and obviously I may have
[7:44] taken a shorter service or something
[7:46] during the week but I wanted to speak on
[7:48] a Mother's Day or give a little
[7:49] follow-up Mother's Day and something
[7:52] crossed my heart and I thought I would
[7:55] share it with you today and so I want to
[7:59] begin in the book of Samuel first samuel
[8:01] chapter one first samuel 1 and 1 i want
[8:04] to talk about hannah and Samuel today
[8:08] and I want to title this so the title
[8:11] that came on my heart for this today was
[8:13] three kinds of mothers three kinds of
[8:17] mothers seem strange but those of you
[8:19] recognize you know the brother branham's
[8:21] title of three types of believers or
[8:23] three kinds of believers they kind of
[8:25] cross my mind now it's sort of a play on
[8:27] words friends I'm not saying that there
[8:29] is absolutely three kinds but I kind of
[8:32] categorized in that way in myself and my
[8:34] mind and heart and looking out in the
[8:37] world and seeing the things that's going
[8:38] on you know there's from what I can see
[8:41] they're really
[8:42] are in my opinion there really are three
[8:45] types of mothers there's there's a good
[8:48] mother the bad mother and the godly
[8:50] mothers you got the good the bad the and
[8:52] the godly there's those that raise your
[8:56] kids and they're good parents and
[8:58] they're there for their children but
[9:00] they don't raise them in the nurture and
[9:02] admonition of God but they raise them to
[9:04] be successful and they raise them to be
[9:06] good people and honest and moral and
[9:08] things like that and that's good it's
[9:10] good that we have good mothers that
[9:12] raise their children that way and we
[9:13] have some that are bad some that just
[9:16] seem like their children are nuisance to
[9:18] them and don't really want to take care
[9:20] of them and don't want to help nurture
[9:22] them and the thing that really makes up
[9:24] a mother what a mother really is and the
[9:28] core of a mother the god-given nature of
[9:31] a mother they just are so lost in the
[9:36] the spirit of the world or the spirit of
[9:39] Satan whatever it is that they just they
[9:40] just seem to lose or don't have that
[9:44] that really God given nature mothering
[9:48] nature although it's still there because
[9:51] I believe it's there God created the
[9:53] woman being separated the feminist part
[9:55] put it in the woman and making me help
[9:57] her I help meet for Adam and you know
[9:59] that was the beginning and that that
[10:01] part of who God is he put into that
[10:03] woman and you see that God Himself is
[10:06] that type of nurturing and and every
[10:09] attribute that you see of that it is in
[10:11] him as well but it seems to void in in a
[10:15] lot of women too where they just they're
[10:17] just not good they're not good mothers
[10:19] sometimes they're caught up in drugs or
[10:22] alcohol or righteous living and and they
[10:26] seem to think that their own pleasure
[10:28] and their own goodness or whatever they
[10:30] want to do is more important than their
[10:32] children and raising their children
[10:33] right I mean the nurture and admonition
[10:35] of God yes but just raising their
[10:37] children right so and then you've got
[10:39] the godly mothers you got the mothers
[10:41] that that truly are raising their kids
[10:44] and the nurture and admonition of God
[10:46] and they love their children they want
[10:47] their children to be successful in and
[10:49] to be godly children and they want to
[10:51] make sure that
[10:52] they get the holy ghost and they want to
[10:53] make sure that when this is all over and
[10:56] the dust is settled in them and we're on
[10:58] the other side that we're all together
[10:59] and we're together with our children and
[11:02] with our families and and all those
[11:04] things it's it's very important to the
[11:06] heart of a godly mother it's it's real
[11:10] important to understand that that that
[11:12] there are those today and it seems to be
[11:15] getting fewer that really take the time
[11:18] and the effort and they love their
[11:19] children even more than their own bodies
[11:21] because the children came from their
[11:23] bodies and and that they love them but I
[11:26] want to get it and want to get into this
[11:28] scripture reading before it gets kind of
[11:32] gets past us here but let's look at
[11:34] First Samuel chapter 1 and I'll probably
[11:37] know the story of Hannah will be too
[11:39] long
[11:39] but just just the thought that came on
[11:43] my heart of what a real mother what a
[11:45] real godly mother representation of the
[11:48] scripture now look at this first samuel
[11:50] chapter 1 verse 1 now a pardon on some
[11:54] of these words i might butcher them a
[11:57] little bit but we'll do the best you can
[11:58] now there was a certain man of raynathan
[12:02] zopim of mount ephraim and his name was
[12:06] Al Qaeda and the son he was the son of
[12:09] Jarrow hem the son of Allah who the son
[12:12] of tobu and the son of zuf and an ephah
[12:16] might be for a night and he had two
[12:18] wives the name of the one was Hannah the
[12:21] name of the other was Opena and Penna
[12:24] had children but hannah had no children
[12:27] and this man went up out of his City
[12:30] yearly to yearly to worship and to
[12:33] sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in
[12:35] Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hophni
[12:39] and Phinehas the priests of the Lord
[12:42] were there and when the time was that
[12:45] Elkin al keine offered he gave to pen a
[12:49] pen on his wife and all her sons and her
[12:51] daughters portions but unto Hannah he
[12:54] gave a worthy portion for he loved
[12:56] Hannah but the Lord
[12:59] her womb now think of that it's hard to
[13:02] understand sometimes or fathom the
[13:04] Lord's will and why God does certain
[13:07] things the way does them but look at the
[13:09] result we might not understand that we
[13:12] don't have to understand it we're not
[13:13] we're not required to understand it
[13:16] we're just required to believe it and
[13:17] trust God but in this it's hard to
[13:21] understand at this time of course at
[13:23] this time it was it was a reproach for a
[13:26] woman not to have children it was a
[13:28] reproach it was considered a curse of
[13:31] God for a woman not to have a baby you
[13:33] think this woman was bad or something or
[13:36] of a bad character of a bad family or
[13:38] something and curses upon them and God
[13:40] shut up their womb and it was a curse
[13:42] man unfortunately today it seems almost
[13:45] like to some women it's a curse to have
[13:47] a child but in this day it was a curse
[13:50] for them not to have children and God
[13:52] according to the scripture God purposely
[13:55] shut up Hannah's wound shut her wound so
[13:58] that she would not have any children and
[14:02] he gave to Hannah
[14:03] Levi who gave to Hannah a worthy portion
[14:06] for he loved Hannah but the Lord had
[14:08] shut up her wound
[14:09] and her adversary also look at the
[14:12] reproach now her adversary also provoked
[14:17] her sword that's to make her angry to
[14:19] get her upset for to make her fret
[14:23] because the Lord had shut up her wound
[14:26] see this woman was bullying her and was
[14:29] making her mad and was and was provoking
[14:31] her to the point of anger because the
[14:34] Lord had shut up her womb and as he did
[14:37] so
[14:38] year by year when she went up to the
[14:39] house of the Lord so she provoked her
[14:42] therefore she wept and did not eat so
[14:46] Hannah's now provoked to the point that
[14:49] she's weeping I would say bitterly
[14:51] although I don't mean to add a
[14:52] description but it says she wept
[14:53] I would imagine bitterly at this point
[14:55] because she did not eat so she's fasting
[14:59] she's fasting now and she's she's
[15:02] stopping to eat but I'll come Oh kind of
[15:05] excuse me her husband to her then said
[15:10] O'Connor
[15:11] to her Hannah why weepest thou and ye
[15:14] this down not and why is thy heart
[15:17] grieved and not i better to be than ten
[15:20] sons and that's true and i'm sure he was
[15:24] very good to her but it's not the same
[15:26] thing it wasn't a substitute having a
[15:29] wonderful husband it was a great thing
[15:31] imagined for him of course but it's not
[15:34] the same thing it's not a substitute of
[15:36] being able to give that husband some
[15:37] children some sons and daughters so it
[15:40] wasn't quite the same thing but he's
[15:41] like ever not better than ten sons so
[15:44] Hannah rose up after they had eaten in
[15:47] Shiloh and after they had drunk now Eli
[15:50] the priest sat upon a seat by post of
[15:53] the temple of the Lord and and she was
[15:57] in bitterness of soul and prayed unto
[15:59] the Lord and wet sore and she vowed a
[16:03] vow think of this now she vowed about
[16:06] and said Oh Lord of Hosts if thou will
[16:08] indeed look on the affliction of might
[16:10] of thine handmaid and remember me and
[16:14] not forget thy handmaid but will give
[16:16] unto thy handmaid a man-child then I
[16:19] will give him unto the Lord all the days
[16:22] of his life and there shall no razor
[16:24] come upon his head now look God has
[16:27] caused this woman's wound this wonderful
[16:30] pure woman this righteous woman who L
[16:35] kind of loved desperately shut up her
[16:38] womb purposely to get her to this place
[16:41] of desperation hannah has come to a
[16:44] place of desperation because the
[16:47] nurturing part of the woman in her just
[16:51] wanted a child so bad her body her womb
[16:55] ur her her breast longed to have a child
[16:58] and and she was so desperate that she
[17:01] began to fast and pray and seek God and
[17:04] and promise God God if you'll give me a
[17:07] child if you'll give me a man child I'll
[17:10] turn him over to you and you can use him
[17:12] he'll be yours all the days of his life
[17:15] I'll give him unto you and a note and no
[17:17] razor become a
[17:18] his head so look at the results see if
[17:21] we don't always understand why God does
[17:23] things the way he does them why and when
[17:26] and how you know that's why we're not to
[17:28] question God sometimes we want to know
[17:30] why and it's not us to know why
[17:32] sometimes we want to you know say God I
[17:37] think he could have been better this way
[17:38] or I would appreciated it better but God
[17:41] knows and and Hannah had gotten to such
[17:44] a desperation fasting praying asking
[17:48] desperate for a man-child that she would
[17:51] give him back to the Lord all the days
[17:53] of his life
[17:54] no God was using Ana he was giving her
[17:58] because God uses the righteousness I
[18:00] mean he doesn't use the devil women he
[18:03] uses a righteous woman and this was a
[18:05] righteous woman and this woman was
[18:06] thinking why am i cursed like this being
[18:08] a good person I'm a righteous person why
[18:11] am I so cursed but see she wasn't cursed
[18:15] God was using it for the better game and
[18:18] you know we look at those things and we
[18:22] don't understand them and we think why
[18:24] is this the way it is and I do what I'm
[18:27] supposed to do and I live the life was
[18:29] supposed to live and be the first I'm
[18:30] supposed to be and and and I feel like
[18:32] I'm a good person a godly person I love
[18:35] the Lord and yet this happened or this
[18:37] happened you know God puts us on paths
[18:40] he puts us on road said that he desires
[18:44] for us to go down but God doesn't always
[18:47] intend for us to continuously for the
[18:50] rest of our lives go down to one
[18:51] specific Road he may get us to that down
[18:54] that road and when it comes to a time to
[18:56] take a left and it's time to take a left
[18:58] and then he'll put people in our lives
[19:00] he'll cause things to happen to make
[19:03] sure that we turn to the left and get
[19:05] off that road because that road has come
[19:07] to an end in our lives it was good the
[19:10] way it was but if God were to come let's
[19:14] just take him if God were to come what
[19:16] I'm trying to say if God were to come to
[19:18] him God would have come to you and say
[19:20] Hannah I want to come out of your womb
[19:23] one of the greatest men to ever live a
[19:26] man that I'm gonna put in my Hall of
[19:29] Fame of faith Hebrews 11
[19:31] a man that's going to be a prophet
[19:34] that's going to be a judge and to his
[19:36] people he's going to be a godly man and
[19:38] he's only gonna follow me and speak my
[19:41] words and say I'm going to use you Hanna
[19:44] to do that but you have to go through
[19:46] this this this this and this to get to
[19:48] that point do you think Hanna would have
[19:51] said okay Lord be it unto me that's fine
[19:54] with me Lord I'll suffer the reproach
[19:56] I'll put up with the with the naysayers
[19:59] and and and I'll and I'll put up with
[20:02] because I want to do your will do you
[20:05] think Hannah would have chose that would
[20:06] you have would you choose that if
[20:08] nobody's gonna say I'm gonna do this and
[20:10] this is what I want but this is what's
[20:12] gonna happen you'd say yes Lord that's
[20:13] fine but then when we don't understand
[20:16] or we try to but we can't figure out
[20:18] Lord why is this going on don't worry
[20:21] about it don't don't fret over it say
[20:24] Lord there's got to be a reason why this
[20:26] has happened there's got to be a reason
[20:28] why you caused me to have to turn left
[20:29] or right or go a different direction or
[20:32] do a different thing
[20:33] there's got to be a reason and God and
[20:36] this was God's reason for Hannah God
[20:38] shut her womb up so she would get so
[20:41] desperate that she would bring forth to
[20:43] Samuel and turn him over to God that
[20:46] Samuel would become the man that he'd
[20:48] become I believe if Hannah had the
[20:50] choice ahead of time and God were to
[20:51] come and explain it to her she would
[20:53] have chose yes that's fine Lord be it
[20:56] unto me
[20:56] I believe any of us would do that but we
[20:58] don't always know that God's ways are
[21:01] mysterious his ways are above our ways
[21:04] his thinking is above our thinking he
[21:06] works and operates in mysterious ways
[21:08] his wonders to perform
[21:10] so who are we to say well this is in
[21:13] Hannah's life and God was using that
[21:15] mother nature in her that motherly a
[21:19] part of her to to want her to get to
[21:23] that place of desperation when she got
[21:25] to that place of desperation then God
[21:27] could use her and and she said I want to
[21:31] do this and and then of course there
[21:33] comes Samuel because God wanted to use
[21:36] her to do that
[21:37] remember God doesn't do that to the
[21:39] ungodly God not God's not operating in
[21:41] the ungodly
[21:42] bad mothers or or maybe even good
[21:45] mothers he's operating in those godly
[21:47] mothers and those mothers that want the
[21:50] best for their children
[21:51] in accordance to the word into God's
[21:54] will so let's move on now she got to
[21:57] that place of desperation she's offered
[21:59] a child to God and he came to pass as
[22:02] she continued praying before the Lord 12
[22:05] first now that Eli marked her mouth he
[22:07] couldn't hear her now Hannah's she
[22:10] spoken her heart only a spoke in her
[22:13] heart only her lips moved but her voice
[22:16] was not heard therefore Eli thought she
[22:19] was drunk and Eli said unto her how long
[22:23] wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine
[22:26] from thee and Hannah answered and said
[22:29] no my lord I am a woman of son of a
[22:33] sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither
[22:36] wine nor strong drink but have poured
[22:38] out my soul before the Lord and that's
[22:42] when you get results friend even that's
[22:44] when the results come count not by an
[22:47] handmaid for a daughter of Belial for
[22:50] out of the abundance of my complaint and
[22:52] grief have I spoken hitherto in Elan
[22:55] answered and said go in peace and the
[22:58] God of Israel grant thee by petition
[23:00] that thou that has asked of him and she
[23:04] said let thine handmaid find grace in
[23:07] thy sight so the woman went her way and
[23:10] did eat and her countenance was no more
[23:13] sad so she didn't she had faith she was
[23:17] she was sad she got in desperation she
[23:22] fasted she prayed she sought the Lord
[23:26] she trusted the Lord heard her and was
[23:30] answering her prayer that was obviously
[23:33] confirmed by Eli telling her that the
[23:36] Lord answered and grant your request and
[23:39] now she's living in faith she's living
[23:42] in faith I know that we're talking about
[23:45] mothers and I know that we're talking
[23:46] about Hannah as a mother and God using
[23:48] that mother nature in her to bring about
[23:51] the
[23:52] of Samuel in in the world in their lives
[23:56] that day maybe in the world continually
[23:59] we go back and we had Samuel we can read
[24:01] it's just phenomenal what God does
[24:04] but now she's living by faith think
[24:08] about it she's not pregnant yet she's
[24:12] not conceived she's not showing she has
[24:16] no doctor to go and and do a pregnancy
[24:19] test but she's no longer sad
[24:22] why is she no longer said because she's
[24:25] got faith she's believing that what she
[24:28] cried out to God for and fasted and
[24:31] prayed in a desperation and Uihlein
[24:33] confirmed to her the Lord grant to you
[24:35] your request she believed was going to
[24:38] happen now let's see even though we're
[24:41] talking about mothers it's it's quite a
[24:44] story to understand her or not not
[24:47] really a story but but our lives and
[24:49] this is a microcosm of our lives and and
[24:53] how we should prepare an act and do
[24:56] before the Lord when it's all said and
[24:58] done and we've gone to the Lord we
[25:00] fasted we prayed we asked God then we
[25:02] look to God for answer we look to God to
[25:05] move we look to God for for either
[25:08] telling us yes or no whatever the
[25:10] entrance of the question is but we have
[25:14] faith then we don't continue to operate
[25:18] in desperation or continue to operate
[25:21] I'm not saying it's wrong you to do but
[25:23] what I'm saying is there's faith there
[25:26] that says I believe God heard my request
[25:29] and the answers on the way period that's
[25:33] it
[25:33] so now Hannah's no more sad because she
[25:36] believes she's no more sad and they rose
[25:40] up early in the in the morning early and
[25:42] worship before the Lord and returned and
[25:45] came back to their house to Rhema and
[25:47] Alcott Elkanah knew
[25:50] and his wife and the Lord remembered her
[25:52] praise the Lord
[25:54] faith brings results I believe God had
[25:57] answered a request but faith brings
[25:59] results we believe that God that that
[26:02] she that she believed what she said was
[26:05] going to happen let's just read the rest
[26:07] of the story can we do that was just a
[26:08] few more verses here 20th verse
[26:11] wherefore it came to pass when the time
[26:14] was come about after Hannah had
[26:17] conceived that she bear his son and
[26:19] called his name Samuel saying because I
[26:22] have asked him of the Lord and the mount
[26:25] al-qaida and all his house went up to
[26:27] offering to the Lord the yearly
[26:29] sacrifice in his vow but Hannah went not
[26:32] up for she said unto her husband I will
[26:34] not go up until the child be weaned and
[26:37] then I will bring him that he may appear
[26:40] before the Lord and there abide forever
[26:43] now she's telling al Qaeda that we know
[26:46] spiritually for the first time the
[26:48] father of the son she's telling him for
[26:51] the first time that we know of
[26:52] scripturally that she's gonna take
[26:54] Samuel and she's going to give him to
[26:56] the Lord to the temple there with Eli
[26:58] for good he's not coming home he's going
[27:02] there for good now again the heart of a
[27:06] mother my that's just but but the heart
[27:10] of a mother for the goodness of God and
[27:12] the work of the Lord you can think about
[27:16] Moses mother doing the same thing and
[27:17] how many others that do that and they do
[27:21] it out of self-sacrifice but the greater
[27:25] love is to the Lord their mother nature
[27:28] yes the the nature they have in them to
[27:30] be a mother is powerful probably one of
[27:33] the most powerful forces in humanity in
[27:35] my opinion you just think for a moment -
[27:38] in my opinion I don't believe that
[27:41] there's any more prayer that prevails
[27:44] before God then the fervent righteous
[27:47] prayer of a godly mother those prayers
[27:50] still if you had a mother that prayed
[27:53] for you and she's gone on those prayers
[27:55] still prevail before God can you imagine
[27:59] the heart of a godly
[28:01] coming before the Lord in prayer and
[28:03] desperation fervently praying for their
[28:06] child I just don't see any more prayer
[28:09] prevailing before God any more if you
[28:12] think about the woman and that was in
[28:14] the scripture several places but the
[28:15] woman Jesus called a dog
[28:17] she said yeah but the dog eater the
[28:20] crumbs she had to Humble herself so her
[28:22] child could be healed her child could be
[28:25] well she humbled herself to even be
[28:27] called a dog and God honored her faith
[28:30] God blessed it because in her was to be
[28:33] a mother even though he approached him
[28:36] wrongly and wasn't cheating come for her
[28:38] he come for the house of Israel children
[28:41] of house of Israel and she wasn't she
[28:44] was a Gentile but God said be it unto
[28:45] you
[28:46] she got what she wanted because it
[28:48] prevailed before God now Ana is just now
[28:51] telling her husband can you imagine I
[28:53] mean when I was rereading this the other
[28:56] day getting this prepared
[28:58] oh if what about wife had done this the
[29:02] sun's gonna be born and we're gonna take
[29:04] him over here we're leavin there that
[29:07] would have been tough now that would
[29:09] have been a rough one for me but that's
[29:12] exactly what she did and now she's
[29:13] telling him she said that he may appear
[29:16] before the Lord and there abide forever
[29:19] now kinda her husband said unto her do
[29:22] what seemeth the good a man that's
[29:26] wonderful tarry until thou have waned
[29:29] him only the Lord established his word
[29:32] so the woman abode and gave her son suck
[29:35] until she weaned him and when she had
[29:38] weaned him she took him up with her with
[29:41] three bullocks and one F of flour and a
[29:44] with three bullocks
[29:46] and a one fo flour and a bottle of wine
[29:49] and brought him onto the
[29:50] unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh and
[29:52] the child was young and they slew a
[29:55] bollocking brought the child to Eli and
[29:58] she said o my Lord is thy soul liveth my
[30:00] lord I am the woman that stood by the
[30:03] year praying unto the Lord for this
[30:05] child I prayed and the LORD hath given
[30:08] me my petition which I asked of him
[30:11] therefore also I have lent him to see
[30:15] this for the lead gift to the Catholics
[30:18] get the Lynn from I have lent him to the
[30:20] Lord as long as he liveth he shall be
[30:22] lent to the Lord and he worshiped the
[30:25] Lord there now think of the sacrifice
[30:29] that she made she finally got a son and
[30:32] she did not have a promise of getting
[30:34] any other children there was no request
[30:37] there was no promise of God that God was
[30:40] going to give her any more children this
[30:41] may have been her only child but she was
[30:44] so desperate and she loved the Lord so
[30:47] much she was willing to offer this child
[30:49] to the Lord and say God here he's yours
[30:51] for service to you use him as you will
[30:54] drawing up and and and and bring him
[30:57] forth to be a mighty soldier for you and
[30:59] that's exactly what Samuel did now
[31:01] Hannah did not look after it that's not
[31:05] it's in the scripture but not in our
[31:06] reading we'll just quit the reading
[31:08] there but but if you read on you'll find
[31:11] out that after God performed what he was
[31:15] performing to bring about Sabbath Samuel
[31:18] into the world through hannah and
[31:22] elkanah think about after he did that
[31:25] then God opened her wound she had three
[31:27] more sons and two more daughters I
[31:29] believe it was she had five more
[31:30] children after that so she was no more
[31:33] barren even after samuel was born see
[31:36] ones once god has got his purpose
[31:38] fulfilled then she moved on life as
[31:42] normal it just continued on after that
[31:44] because God had blessed her and brought
[31:46] her to that point now I want to read you
[31:48] this this one quote that kind of struck
[31:52] me is as I was looking at this and it is
[31:56] from desperations in September 1st 1963
[32:00] ham
[32:01] a barren woman in the Bible she wanted a
[32:04] son and she got to fasting for him think
[32:08] about this now this is of course the
[32:10] heart of a mother but think about this
[32:11] as also the things that you desire
[32:15] before the Lord and for your children
[32:17] maybe your children aren't serving the
[32:19] Lord maybe the army
[32:20] haven't give their heart floor maybe
[32:22] they've gone astray or something but
[32:24] remember this that prayer that fervent
[32:27] prayer before the Lord prevails much in
[32:31] my opinion probably prevails as much
[32:34] more than any other prayer fervently
[32:37] burning passionately that's what fervent
[32:40] means before the Lord and and remembered
[32:44] that desperation she wanted a son as she
[32:48] went to fasting for him and she fasted
[32:51] and prayed until evening until even the
[32:54] priest at the temple thought she was
[32:56] drunk she was in such desperation think
[32:59] about my she was in such desperation the
[33:01] priest thought she was drunk with the
[33:03] rest of the women watching what kind of
[33:05] a bonnet the other one had to wear and
[33:07] you know what how it goes and the other
[33:09] ones seeing what kind of clothes they
[33:10] had on and talking about the things and
[33:12] going on on the farm but not him she
[33:16] stepped right through the whole crowd
[33:18] and went to the altar she had been
[33:20] fasting she wanted her reproach taken
[33:23] away what a difference it is today it's
[33:27] almost a reproach to have a child then
[33:30] it was a reproach not to have a child
[33:33] she got her her needs and she never
[33:36] noticed the dignity of the temple she
[33:37] never noticed the dignified priests as
[33:39] they walked down she was in such
[33:41] distress till their tears rolling down
[33:43] her cheeks she was crying
[33:44] in desperation oh lord give me that son
[33:48] and she did that and God honored that to
[33:52] bring her to the place that Samuel could
[33:54] be born nowadays you got almost anything
[33:58] that goes you know even brother Branham
[34:02] talked about and I don't know that it
[34:04] was prophetic I didn't hear brother
[34:05] madam say thus saith the Lord but you
[34:07] know he made statements like she'll show
[34:10] mother a dog or a cat or
[34:12] something and you think 5060 years ago
[34:15] what that was like
[34:16] but think about what you see going on
[34:18] today I've never seen the like of my
[34:22] life
[34:22] Brendan just nothing in the world wrong
[34:24] with you having a pet there's nothing in
[34:26] the world having a dog or a cat or
[34:27] whatever but look at the way that's done
[34:30] today there's they're sitting at the
[34:33] dinner table they're they're going into
[34:36] the grocery stores and the restaurants
[34:37] with them and it's service animals fine
[34:40] seeing-eye dogs fine but the dogs of
[34:43] this just people I see bumper stickers
[34:46] now Arden them little magnets or
[34:49] something on the back my grandchildren
[34:51] have four paws I I'm sorry but that's
[34:54] just a disgrace to me that's more I want
[34:57] to get one that says my grandchildren
[34:59] have two feet and ten toes I saw the
[35:04] news the other day they're actually
[35:05] having a dog's mom day what is that how
[35:12] many human women have you seen birth
[35:14] dogs but see it's in them that they're
[35:19] mothering something they treat him like
[35:23] like human beings
[35:25] PETA folks they're animals I we've had
[35:29] we've had pets that I've loved dearly
[35:31] but never treat them like a human they
[35:34] weren't human I believe I believe that
[35:36] all that we love is gonna be there I
[35:38] believe they're gonna be there but we
[35:41] didn't treat them like humans that they
[35:43] weren't like our children we didn't
[35:46] clothe them and put mittens on her feet
[35:49] and honestly the dogs are probably
[35:53] miserable like that they probably hate
[35:55] it
[35:56] I love the affection but you've never
[35:57] seen the like the way it is today it's
[36:01] just it's just going crazy how much it's
[36:04] it's happened that way with the dogs but
[36:08] it's it's kind of prophetic see because
[36:10] it's gotten to the place that they that
[36:13] they got a mother something they got a
[36:15] mother something you got a lot the
[36:19] reproach that brings sometimes today and
[36:22] and
[36:23] women that don't want to have children
[36:25] the hound children you know one of the
[36:28] probably one of the greatest
[36:29] babysitter's or mothers there is being
[36:31] used today is a TV or a video game I go
[36:36] into restaurants and it a little kid
[36:37] sitting there watching a cartoon or
[36:39] playing a little game or something at
[36:41] the table I know I'm old-fashioned I'm
[36:45] old-school but you took your hat off and
[36:48] you said respectfully you didn't sit
[36:49] there watching a movie or a game but
[36:52] that's become the babysitter's that's
[36:54] become the mother to these children how
[36:57] dare the women allow Hollywood to be
[37:01] their mothers their children's mother
[37:04] but that's what it's gotten to be and
[37:06] that's what's got to be bad mothers
[37:09] people that raise their children and
[37:11] what he expects gonna happen what he
[37:14] expects gonna take place when this when
[37:16] this is how these children are being
[37:17] raised and you see each generation is
[37:20] more reprobate than the other each
[37:22] generation is worse than the one before
[37:24] it people don't want to admit it they
[37:26] sell a while you know it was it was like
[37:29] that in our day no it wasn't it was not
[37:32] that way in our day if the way things
[37:34] are now wasn't that way in my day it's
[37:37] changed so drastically but the true
[37:41] godly mothers still stand and they
[37:43] should be honored they should be
[37:45] respected there's because there's the
[37:47] good and the bad you think about the bad
[37:50] ones think about how bad this is in
[37:53] Revelation chapter 17 I mean outside of
[38:00] the over 50 million human lives that
[38:05] have been murdered and destroyed as a
[38:08] result of the legalization of abortion
[38:10] and women doing what they shouldn't to
[38:17] abort least you to murder these children
[38:21] don't want to have the child so bad
[38:23] they're willing to kill them I mean
[38:26] people go crazy over murders all the
[38:29] time and rightfully so but half this
[38:33] you don't live tonight a highbrow when
[38:36] you hear about abortions government
[38:39] funded abortions it's just it's the
[38:42] murder of children is just it's sad
[38:45] women having to buy books to be a mother
[38:49] go to the book store and and there's
[38:52] books how to be a mother I tell you the
[38:55] best book to learn how to how to be a
[38:56] mother this one right here this Bible is
[38:59] the best book you can read to try to
[39:01] find out how to be a good mother and
[39:02] raise your children in the nurture and
[39:05] admonition of God that's how you become
[39:07] a big a good mother you just pray and
[39:09] ask God will eat you it's it's it's in
[39:12] them to do it's not in the library it's
[39:15] not in the bookstore god it's God's in a
[39:19] given right to a woman to be a mother to
[39:21] know how to raise her children right and
[39:24] to be a mother to those children it's in
[39:27] them to do but in this horribleness
[39:30] of nature revelation 17 you know there
[39:36] came out one of the seven angels which
[39:37] had the seven vials talked to me saying
[39:40] unto me come hither I will show unto
[39:42] thee the judgment of the great
[39:44] that's a woman of course that sitteth
[39:47] upon many waters that's a lot of people
[39:50] with whom the kings of the earth have
[39:52] committed fornication
[39:54] of course fornication ones she's an
[39:56] illegitimate woman so a or so of
[39:59] course she's gonna be committing
[40:00] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[40:03] earth have been made drunk with the wine
[40:04] of her fornication so he carried me away
[40:07] in the spirit of the lewdness and I saw
[40:09] a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured
[40:11] Beast full of names of blasphemy which
[40:13] have yet seven heads ten horns of course
[40:15] we know that's blasphemous names
[40:18] denomination names and the woman was
[40:21] arrayed in purple scarlet color decked
[40:24] with gold precious stones pearls having
[40:26] a golden cup owner and hadn't followed
[40:28] the abominations and filthiness of her
[40:30] fornication remember she's a she's
[40:33] a she's a an illegitimate woman she's
[40:37] prostituting herself with any and all oh
[40:40] yes she's beautiful
[40:41] oh she's decked out in the scarlet color
[40:44] gold precious
[40:45] pearls having a golden cup in her hand
[40:47] but it's the filthiness an abomination
[40:50] horrible filthiness of this woman and
[40:55] upon her forehead was a name written
[40:57] Mystery Babylon the Great the mother of
[41:01] harlots and abominations of the earth
[41:04] well no wonder she's the mother of
[41:05] harlots look at what she is and her
[41:08] children come forth that's their example
[41:11] what do you think they're gonna be how
[41:13] do you think they're gonna be race what
[41:14] kind of people do you think are gonna
[41:15] come from a mother like that
[41:17] when she of herself is illegitimate what
[41:20] do you think her children are gonna be
[41:21] what do you think her daughters are
[41:23] gonna be they're following all the same
[41:26] lines they're being the same type of way
[41:29] because their mother is that way that's
[41:31] the importance of understanding how how
[41:35] much a mother means to the raising of
[41:37] children the father's there he's a nice
[41:40] disciplinarian and all but you know what
[41:43] most of the time now I know it's
[41:45] different sometimes in some families and
[41:47] some families are broke up and one
[41:49] parent home and stuff but most of the
[41:51] time when you got children and they bump
[41:54] their head or they scratch their knee
[41:55] what do they go they climb up mother as
[41:57] fast as they can I mean they'll love you
[42:00] to death but when they scrape their knee
[42:02] they're going straight to mother I could
[42:04] grab them all along but they don't want
[42:06] me they want mama they're gonna if I
[42:09] pick them up they're gonna bellow louder
[42:11] than they did before why because I'm not
[42:13] mama
[42:13] they won't mama mom was the one that
[42:16] they can crawl into their arms and and
[42:18] hold up to their bosom and that's the
[42:20] love and the nurture and the and that
[42:23] comes from that mother and from that
[42:25] mother nature you think about again and
[42:29] going back back to Hannah and how she
[42:31] was she would have to go year after year
[42:34] after year to see her son there but what
[42:38] godly mother doesn't want their child
[42:41] I mean success in the world is fine
[42:43] riches wealth doctors whatever that's
[42:46] fine that's nice
[42:48] there's nothing wrong with being a
[42:49] successful person that's great a mother
[42:51] a family should want their children the
[42:54] mom and dad should want their children
[42:56] to be successful and to be prosperous
[42:58] and to be blessed but what more
[43:00] important thing is there them for that
[43:02] child to serve the Lord and to live for
[43:04] God to be born again and the Holy Ghost
[43:06] field and dedicating and consecrating
[43:09] their lives to the Lord you know you can
[43:12] do you can be successful and still serve
[43:14] the Lord you can still have a nice job
[43:17] and serve the public and serve the Lord
[43:20] God's hands in all of it if if it's by
[43:23] his children is by his chosen his hand
[43:26] is upon it and his hand is upon it then
[43:29] the thing that we that we desire the
[43:31] most is to make sure that in her desires
[43:36] to make sure that they're dedicated to
[43:38] the Lord and that then that they had put
[43:41] their feet on the right path and that's
[43:44] that that's what their their job their
[43:47] duty is I think about my own family and
[43:50] I think about my own life and I've done
[43:53] I would say I've done fairly well today
[43:57] I thought about my mom quite a bit but I
[44:01] haven't shed a tear yet fortunately my
[44:04] son's here and my daughter and
[44:06] son-in-law and grandchildren are coming
[44:08] over and I have my wife and I have
[44:10] people around me to help me remember the
[44:13] best things of good times but you know I
[44:16] I think I've mentioned you know brother
[44:19] Ram talked about his dad and his bad dad
[44:21] being big and having muscles and
[44:23] carrying 200-pound logs or sacks or
[44:25] whatever every charm and things like
[44:28] that and thought man that man has just
[44:30] built him he's a towering he's a pillar
[44:32] he'll never decay or go away and but of
[44:37] course they come the time where his dad
[44:39] did dad decayed his dad fade away and
[44:42] his dad passed away and I can actually
[44:45] over all the time and everything they
[44:47] could gone and I'd almost just got to
[44:49] the place that I felt that way about my
[44:51] mom
[44:52] I didn't even get really serious when
[44:57] when
[44:58] you know they were telling me that you
[45:01] know back he says you know she was doing
[45:03] bad and she was going downhill and I
[45:05] thought while his mom you know she's
[45:07] she's gonna bounce back she's gonna come
[45:09] back
[45:09] even when I was there I felt like when I
[45:13] saw her there laying it I thought why
[45:15] does she just she's just gonna you know
[45:17] have a nice sleep tonight and I'll see
[45:21] her tomorrow and but you know it was the
[45:24] Lord's choice the next morning to take
[45:26] her and I just didn't think that would
[45:28] ever happen it it almost shocked me
[45:33] without being shocking cuz I looked at
[45:36] my mom that way thought she would be
[45:38] here for forever but it's a spiritualism
[45:45] commune with the dead and I can't call
[45:48] my mom on that phone anymore and wish
[45:49] her a Happy Mother's Day today but I
[45:52] know she knows I love her mister and I
[45:56] think it should be that way with all of
[45:58] us whether we have them with us still or
[46:00] not if you do take every advantage you
[46:04] have first Mother's Day in my life I've
[46:06] ever had without my mom take every
[46:08] advantage you have of spending the time
[46:11] and showing them how much you love them
[46:13] and appreciate them especially those
[46:15] godly mothers that put your feet on the
[46:18] right path and showed you the right way
[46:20] and took you to church and read you the
[46:23] Bible and made their home a place where
[46:27] the Holy Spirit could come and be an
[46:29] influence to children and bring them to
[46:31] that place of knowledge they're to be
[46:34] revered respected loved it's hard to put
[46:41] into words sometimes but I believe
[46:45] that's just a small port of portion of
[46:51] what it really does mean and what it
[46:54] really is it's harder today it's very
[46:57] hard raising children it's a mother's
[47:02] job as 24/7 365 never ends never stops
[47:08] hardest job you go without sleep you go
[47:12] about food you have a baby hanging on
[47:16] you all the time or nursing on you or
[47:18] something it's it's that something I'll
[47:22] never know or experience but I can only
[47:26] imagine how wonderful it is to have the
[47:29] opportunity to be able to raise children
[47:31] and to raise those children unto the
[47:33] Lord in the nurture and admonition of
[47:35] God I miss my mom very dearly and I
[47:39] trust that y'all spend the time that you
[47:41] can today letting your mother know how
[47:43] much you love them and how much you
[47:45] appreciate them one day the Lord tarries
[47:48] their flower will fade but while we're
[47:53] here and while we have the chance we
[47:55] honor them and love them again I believe
[47:58] that those prayers even if your mom has
[48:01] gone those prayers are still prevailing
[48:03] before the Lord for you the thing that
[48:06] helps and keeps us so remember them love
[48:09] them remember and love even that part of
[48:14] God who he is
[48:15] feminist part of the Lord who he is and
[48:18] that part that he shows to us and that
[48:21] motherhood and nurturing that he gives
[48:24] to us it's all a part of the same come
[48:26] from the same gun because he is the same
[48:30] so just remember that and keep it in
[48:35] your heart god bless you for being here
[48:40] today and for listening didn't want to
[48:43] be too long today but I wanted to say
[48:46] something to honor the mothers the good
[48:48] mothers are good and that's fine and
[48:51] that's nice and the world needs them and
[48:53] the world means those people to raise
[48:56] and become doctors and and whatever you
[49:01] know mechanics and think doctors today
[49:02] because of the medical field and
[49:04] everything is going on but but all the
[49:07] things you raised are true it's good to
[49:09] have a good mother
[49:11] learn ethics and morals and hard work
[49:14] and that's all very important but my
[49:18] when when it comes to the time that that
[49:20] that godly mother that one that is
[49:24] raising their children in the nurture
[49:26] and admonition of God it's very
[49:28] important that we understand and
[49:30] recognize how important that is so wish
[49:33] we were with you today but we celebrate
[49:36] together with you and just trust in the
[49:38] Lord bless you mighty couldn't even had
[49:40] a meal today together but we will again
[49:43] very soon I will keep you updated and
[49:45] posted me and brother Roger has some
[49:48] things we've been thinking on praying
[49:50] about and looking to and seeing maybe
[49:52] what the Lord might do next so just
[49:55] trusting them to you keep us in your
[49:57] prayers and then the Lord help and bless
[49:59] you and just remember that we do what we
[50:06] can to be a help for each one of you and
[50:08] to the glory of the Lord so let's bow
[50:11] our heads for prayer now as as we get
[50:13] ready to dismiss Lord Jesus father I'm
[50:17] so thankful God that you've blessed us
[50:20] with godly mother's words can't even
[50:23] express Lord what it means to us to have
[50:26] had a godly mother and to and to give
[50:29] you the thanks Lord and the
[50:31] representation we see in this little
[50:33] story ever met about Hannah and Lord how
[50:36] you moved in her life and how her
[50:39] desperation brought her to the point
[50:41] that you're able to bring Samuel for is
[50:43] one of the greatest men a menu even a
[50:46] man you even put into your Hall of Fame
[50:49] of faith in Hebrews 11 a great man Lord
[50:53] had came through this precious humble
[50:55] woman and Lord I'm so thankful God Lord
[50:59] of me certainly can't claim to or attain
[51:01] to any kind of Samuel Lord but I'm
[51:04] thankful to have had a godly mother that
[51:07] raised me in the nurture and admonition
[51:09] of God and put my feet on the path of
[51:12] righteousness and continued to press
[51:14] forward Lord I know her prayers for me
[51:17] continue to prevail before you even
[51:19] today
[51:20] lord I love her so much and Lord I'm so
[51:23] thankful God that you give us this time
[51:25] is this commercialization time that we
[51:28] have in this country but God I do
[51:30] believe it's a very important time that
[51:32] we take to to celebrate and honor these
[51:35] wonderful godly mothers that we have
[51:37] today Lord they seem to be in short
[51:39] supply more than they used to be but God
[51:43] we know that they're still here and as
[51:45] we come to this endtime still bringing
[51:48] forth children in the nurture and
[51:50] admonition of God for your glory and
[51:53] honor honor them lord I pray today and
[51:56] may your hand be upon and bless them we
[51:59] thank you God for all that you do for us
[52:01] and give to us and we just give you
[52:03] glory and praise and honor thank you
[52:05] Lord for that the nature of the nurture
[52:08] that you have as that mother nature in
[52:10] you Lord to share with us so many people
[52:14] in the world today say mother nature
[52:17] they don't realize they're talking about
[52:19] you but Lord we want to thank you God
[52:22] because we know Lord will just give you
[52:24] glory and honor praise Lord may you
[52:27] bless the people god bless them through
[52:28] the week we commit them to you now in
[52:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[52:33] now I got a before we close go here I
[52:36] got a flyer in the mail from the Living
[52:41] Word Church up and living board
[52:43] fellowship I think it is but is for a
[52:46] northern northern Arizona family camp
[52:49] they're doing at the end of July July
[52:50] 22nd through the 26th carpenter families
[52:53] really in taking care of this they're
[52:56] gonna have services seven o'clock every
[53:00] night Thursday Friday Saturday night at
[53:02] 7:00 and Sunday morning at 10:00 a.m.
[53:04] dinner will be provided Thursday Friday
[53:07] Saturday and lunch on Sunday there RV
[53:11] hookups and there's dorms to stay in and
[53:13] things like that if you want to do that
[53:15] activities during the day and all so if
[53:18] you want to think you want to be a part
[53:20] of that notice
[53:21] more than two months away but I wanted
[53:24] to let you know about that so if you
[53:25] want to plan I think being in northern
[53:29] Arizona and the end of July out of
[53:31] Tucson when it's 110 might not be a
[53:33] horrible idea but I'm sure they have
[53:35] don't have Luther ministering our but
[53:37] that's okay as long as God's ministering
[53:40] that's all that matters but if you'd
[53:42] like to go and you want some more
[53:43] details or something you can contact me
[53:45] let me know and be happy to share that
[53:47] with you so appreciate you love you
[53:49] today again we'll be in contact during
[53:52] the week with the what the furthest of
[53:54] the Lord is going forward as we as this

[54:03] just trust God's keeping us and blessing
[54:06] us and God bless you through the week
