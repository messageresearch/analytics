Satan in Jesus Christ what better place to have your soul anchored in than in Jesus Christ yes people have anchors in the government people have anchors in their medicine and then their doctors and their bank accounts and their jobs and their cars and their homes but my anchor is in Jesus Christ it's the only one that'll hold things when all the other stuff is gone and destructed even if a person lives their whole life with billions of dollars in mansions and cars everywhere when they draw that last breath the only thing that's going to matter is were they Anchored In Jesus amen that's the only thing that's going to make a difference at that time praise the Lord amen so thankful we're anchored in him today amen thank you Lord we have a couple prayer requests to bring to your attention today um one sister Shelia texted me this morning said she got hold of sister Joy Huckabee yesterday and sister Joy is still not feeling well uh she's in a lot of pain she's having vein surgeries she's got four more I think you told me to go and she really sincerely covets our prayers so please continue to remember Sister joy hakami in prayer I've been praying for her for Faithfully for a while now since we first found out about her infirmity so we want to continue to remember her in prayer also sister Lydia's family sister Lydia and sister Lydia family not doing well they've been sick sick since last week since religious started getting better or the Ralph's starting to get it now one of the granddaughters Marissa just tested positive for strep so that whole family just kind of it's just kind of like the Hot Potato you know you try to get rid of the potato before it goes before it goes off so they just keep passing it around so please remember Sister Lydia and the family Lord would just touching them also got a text from Sister Sharia right before church started Arts back is still bothering him the strength he's got a very laborous job that he does he needs strength in his back he has to do his job so as police remember him in prayer as well also micro rights request here says please remember me in your prayers regarding leadership of the Lord for what he wants me to do or what he has for me the other day I felt some sense of urgency towards changing jobs but I want to make sure that pull is from him and not from any other source amen absolutely most certainly you definitely want to make sure that amen before you go on because the Lord has blessed you so well in that so if it is time to move on you know a lot of times people think well the Lord's blessed me in this I'll be this forever no no they uh this means the Lord has put you somewhere and he's blessed you where he put you and if there comes a time or when there Comes A Time and maybe they'll never come a time but if it does then it's time to move then you move as he moves praise the Lord that's what uh children of Israel did yeah popular Fire by Night filler Cloud by day and when the Lord stayed there they stayed there whether it was a day or a year they stayed there when he moved they moved if it was a few hours later they moved it was a few years later they moved they didn't move till he moved but when he moved they moved that's what we are supposed to be doing amen by the leadership of the holy spirit in our life so we just trust the Lord we just bless Micah with the leadership to know the right thing to do here Amen brother Danny um this is a prayer request uh brother Danny writes a prayer request hoping that the government comes to a positive decision pertaining to the debt ceiling which at this point is a matter of days if not it could affect social security Medicare military pay also would have a global effect on the negative financial crisis that is true very very true brother Danny but if it does God will take care of us amen take care of his own in this world completely falls apart God will still take care of his own amen praise the Lord so if there's not a check in your mailbox or in your bank account there will God will put it there there's no food on the table God put it on the table amen he'll take care of us praise the Lord so uh appreciate that prayer request to know the Lord is mindful of us and his hand is always honest amen praise the Lord have an unspoken request on your heart today a little less than to our feet if we could we have quite a bit to be thankful for and why do men to still look to the Lord for and ask for and Trust for his Deliverance amen praise the Lord Brother Dennis would you take these two little ones Lord Jesus we come before you Thanksgiving and yes Jesus you're mindful of your own children thank you Jesus Lord first of all we need to check out where we stand with you Lord I just heard the prophets say that if your word comes forth and will refuse to cope with it to accept it or to obey it says that that spirit is not of you father yes it's another Spirit oh God take over amen a religious spirit that's the prophet said it's the most deceiving Spirit on the face of this Earth it's even fighting and playing into followers of your great message you have said through yourself Jesus to get a bride ready for a rapture and Lord this is the eagle age where the eagle can see higher in the skies than any other bird and lowered by your grace you have opened up our eyes our spiritual eyesight our spiritual understanding yes Jesus your word and oh dear we are eagles your English father Yes said by your grace you have called to walk in the life of the review revealed truth of this hour Hallelujah Lord thank you Lord anything for granted it's already been mentioned by our pastor it's time to obey your word obedience is better than sacrifice yes Lord you line up to the simple things it's not the the algebra on the greater things that will fail you it's the little things we leave undone yes and father help us to climb up to those ABCs that all the other things will fall in place and bring us into the fullness of the statue of Jesus Christ yes and father we are needing we had compassion as the prophet said is doing the will of the father and living our life for others is looking heaven in the face Jesus and father yes we should be more compassion to pray and be concerned about the lives of our loved ones the lives of The Sinner that unless they accept you as the Lord and savior of their lives they'll be lost and father we have compassion we have love for the needs of the people this morning may you come unto sea and Grant them their heart's desire may your healing touch be out to the ones that needed for father you are a great physician yes Lord yes Jesus that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with yourselves we are healed Hallelujah mother we are more Victorious we are victorious in you father it's time that as Paul said I died daily how much more should we die to ourselves amen and let your Holy Spirit have full control full preeminence and all other requests that brother Micah needs your leadership your guidance yes uh footsteps of the righteous of order of the Lord then they're led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so our brother what he needs to do is he waits on you they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount on wings of eagles and father all the other prayer requests you you know what they are maybe I can't remember them all but you know what the hearts desire from your people yes Jesus when they raise their hands father may you grant them their heart's desire may always be a daily strive to draw closer to you to always seek your will amen live our life for others yes Lord to put you first Lord if you're not Lord of all you're not Lord at all if I'll make it real in our lives we might have days we might have weeks we might have years but father let us always be ready yes bless our brothers he brings forth your word father give him strength you know he's just re getting over another week's worth of work give him strength he's tired but lord it's not our brother that speaks it's you for us thank you let our hearts be open to receive your word to become stronger and better Christians in your name we pray name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord Jesus she could be seated if you'd like amen thank the Lord knows everything amen and I stand here always we take a prayer request always forget to mention myself uh but uh Thursday I kind of I must have twisted or wrenched my knee or something I don't know what happened but um worked out today got into the hotel Thursday night I knew it one time when I got down on one knee was working uh that it felt a little funny but I didn't think anything about it um it's kind but when I got to Maroon Thursday night it was a balloon so and it was pretty tender and so I went in Friday and I told boss he said well you take it easy today just sweep or something you know because going up and down a ladder what I was doing uh was causing me to have to go up down the ladder land up down up down down I said I could probably stand or walk but get nothing down a ladder and I spent 15 minutes I think helping kind of showing the other guy that I'm kind of teaching on how what I was doing and I just I just couldn't take it anymore so I just started working I just I can't stand and watch I have to work so I was back up and down the ladder all day again um but but during the night the swelling had gone down some and yesterday it was okay but and this morning the swelling was probably the least that it's been but I'm still like a flamingo I'm I'm kind of on one leg so all day Friday my my right leg just got so sore because I was standing on it the whole time and not and when I was going up it was with my right foot so it's still not normal yet I think it's I don't know it probably goes back to Old skiing injury that I had up we lived up in the mountains and twisted it and then it did that and I didn't have any money doctors and the Lord touched it and it's been fine ever since so I guess I must have Twisted it or something I don't know going up down in a hurry and landing on it and you know going out or something I don't know but no but just a devil trying to mess me up but and I said well well I'm going to stop me this morning so but I do appreciate your prayers all that being said and I appreciate your prayers you want to come up for a week it's up to you okay Mike has a song for us he wants to sing so uh last week I was it was over 72 hours too so it was I got about maybe six hours of sleep a line five to six four the first night so I was pretty tired yesterday when I got home and Friday night found out at dinner they canceled my flight Saturday morning so I had to go through all that to get flight rearranged and done all over again and uh but thank God the Lord blessed it and is it this one yeah so yeah he has the words on here so yeah um give me in your prayers too just for I double hates what I've seen so Tuesday I woke up with a really really sore throat and I could tell it wasn't strep I've had strep so many times like intelligent friends it was more like viral but it really only lasted two stages it was almost completely gone and I was almost back to normal I just need to rebuild my stream so I went back to work Thursday Friday so I don't I can't tell if it's allergies because I've never really had allergies if it's just something lingering from Tuesday on the same nonetheless amen this was on my heart earlier this week and then

amen and just get into the little message just one the lord gave me but on my hearts to bring I'm going to go over to Matthew chapter 6 chapter 7. amen read our first scripture here so glad that he showed me his way Amanda praise the Lord God where would we be without it Saints where would we be without it amen thank you Jesus Saint Matthew Chapter 7 we're going to begin with verse 21. amen but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of Prayer gracious Lord Jesus father we're so very thankful again for another beautiful day for your grace your blessings your love your mercy thank you Lord for the songs that were sung the spirit that was felt Lord and for these people that have come Lord to bring their link of fire into this place expecting Lord of raging Inferno father to happen in this place once again today to move upon every heart and every life and to strengthen Us by your spirit and to draw us closer to you Lord and to absolve us from all wrong doing and yet Lord to show us God that way to continue Lord to press this battle regardless of what negativity regardless of what uh obstacles Satan may try to put in our way father you have given us the overcoming power to press beyond all that Satan tries to come in like a flood with Lord you raise that standard you continually to raise that standard Lord understanding our Humanity Lord understanding our carnality understanding Lord that we fall short so many times times the father we belong to you and it proves in our heart of how much we love you Lord and obey your word and Lord live for you God and strive to do all that we can to to be a blessing Lord to others and obey your word and Lord all that we do according to your word father Lord we are lost without it we are nothing without it yes we strive Lord to enter into that Straight Gate God that you put before us Lord yes we continue to do so bless us Lord as your people God may you continue to move Upon Us in this service have your will away in it God speak to us from it may you show to us in here what you'd have us to see and know forgive all of our sins iniquities Lord draw them Lord and put them under the blood and back on the head of Satan where they'll lay to the day of judgment we rebuke every demonic spirit and try to hurt inward infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we thank you Lord for this time up for your word for this message may you speak it to us now God as you would Lord in a powerful and a supernatural way once again and accomplish that that you sent it forth for Lord we've come in obedience to your word expecting great things today Lord and you never disappoint so we commit it to you Lord and ask again your your Eternal blessings onto the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Saint Matthew chapter 7. and we'll begin reading verse 21. Matthew 7 21 21 amen not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven may he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me on that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful words and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity you could be seated if you like amen is a very powerful scripture the Lord give us a a couple weeks ago a thought to bring here we brought something along these lines before and uh for some reason the Lord put it on my heart and entered a couple of weeks ago to bring it back again to our remembrance today but how uh how this scripture being so full of a message that speaks to the world and speaks to humanity because it does speak to the believer it does speak to the unbeliever and it does speak to the make-believer uh if we read it and understand it in that context but um and I don't want to title this today the the disappointed because a lot of times in life we can just start with the carnal a lot of times in life we are disappointed uh the one person that has never disappointed us is God if we feel like God has disappointed us it's because the expectation you have was beyond his will or his word right that's when a lot of people get disappointed they get disappointed because they go to a place in their minds and I've said this many times a lot of times and brother Branham referred to it of course uh is something as simple as our prayer life in our prayer life and talking to God and communicating with the Lord and expecting things we take up these prayer requests and we know that the Lord moves in Supernatural ways but we also know that the Lord moves in mysterious ways in ways that we can't understand uh and a lot of times when we pray something we get it built in our mind that it's going to be x y z that's just that we we pray it this way we're believing it this way so this has got to be the way that God does it but that's not always the way it is in fact most of us have lived long enough and been Christians long enough that we already realize that many times when the Lord answers our prayer he answers them in a completely different way than we thought he was going to everybody amen and and in the the way he answers it may actually be in a way contrary to what we thought right and that's what brings a disappointment we had uh that we feel in our minds that God has disappointed us we have uh things in our life that disappoint us people in our lives that disappoint us situations in our lives that disappoint us uh life and it is as they said full of disappointments uh the problem that we have a lot of times is though that we fixate moral the disappointments than we do on the achievements amen we fixate more on the things that have gone wrong and on the negative than on the positive and on the good amen one little thing comes up or one little thing happens or one little thing is a skewed and all of a sudden our disappointment outweighs the hundred things that were positive and and good and right and and then we end up going the wrong direction with this one disappointment and it puts us in a bad place in a place that we shouldn't be sometimes those disappointments come in some are big disappointments and some are small disappointments some are great and some aren't some of us some you can kind of roll roll over like a like a little Pebble and some are like a huge mountain in front of you but regardless there's always the overcoming ability that the Lord has given us to get beyond that regardless of where it might have come from or where it might have been now brother Branham gives a very good example of this uh when he talks about marriage uh I want to read this uh little quote that he uh that he gave here in the Statue of a perfect man as we probably all read or heard that message but he's talking about marriage and look what he says here he says a young man asked me the other day said you think I ought to get married brother Bradham to such and such a girl and I said how much do you think of her and he said oh my I just love her now as a young person or excuse me as an older person we realize as we look back what love meant to us as a young person when we were and our teens our early 20s we understand the separation the difference of what we saw and thought of as being loved then and as we realize it know it's me today right so when brother randoms referring so I say that because he doesn't say it but as a seasoned more mature person we can look back and understand that when brother random is talking about a young man what he is picturing from this young man and what the young man is actually saying so when the young man says oh I just love her you know I how many times have you been infatuated but you thought you were in love how many times have you and let's just put this how many times have you been in lust really getting carnal now and not in love and you thought oh this is love that really isn't love you have a great Affinity you've got some kind of infatuation or something or maybe even as Carl as lust but not really in love that this boy say oh I just love her you understand what we're saying you understand what brother Brandon's point is here amen the man the the boy says oh my I just love her I said well if you're not going to live without her you've buried man you better marry her then but if you can live without her you better not that's yes that's a pretty simple way of saying it you know I went to Brother green one time and asked for the green on and I was just trying to Garner some information from Brother green and his personal conversations with brother Brown and you know how brother green is so don't get mad I'm just going to tell you just exactly the way he said it and the context he said it you know him as well as I do I said brother Brown uh brother Green in your conversations with brother Brown not on not okay I I know I think 95 plus percent of what brother Brown said about marriage and divorce on tape I've heard it read it but you personally and your conversation that brother Branham ever give you any kind of insight into marriage and divorce that you could share with me it was just me sitting there with him there was no other brother since nobody else uh and he just looked at me he reached I believe if I remember right he leaned over his Destiny he says all I can tell you is if you don't want to get divorced don't get married I said okay brother what's on the docket for today what else do we got what the about I just tell you it exists exactly the way he said it at this exactly that was that was his answer if you don't want to get divorced don't get married brother random and and I thought about after a while after the after the height of the conversation settled a little bit and and I've had time to think about that which has been years that was years ago I asked in that and looking at what brother random said they're basically saying the same thing what brother green told me and what brother Brown told this young man are basically the same thing brother Brown was a brother Breen was a little uh more forward about it but but this is basically the same thing he said if you if you don't want to get divorced don't get married brother Ram's telling this young man if you can't live without her then you better marry her but if you can live without her you better not marry her that's that's kind of a bottom line to it they're kind of the same thing when you when you when you peel it out and um he said if you you better not marry but it but if it's going to kill you you better go ahead and get married I said and so uh what I was trying to get to him was this if you love her so much now right now before you're married everything is just fine and dandy amen I can't get attached to that but after you get married then the toils and trials of Life come in Amen brother Brown that's when you've got to be so in love that you understand one another when you're disappointed in her or she's disappointed in you you still love and understand one another amen amen that's where death comes in that's not where that transcends infatuation yeah that transcends a lust or just some sort of uh affinity for someone when you when you get down to what the tools and trials of Life are happening and the disappointments coming we have these great expectations of what life is going to be and what marriage is going to be and what having children is going to be and all of a sudden life smacks you right right across the jaws and and you're like oh wait uh what are you gonna do with that disappointment what are you going to do when that person didn't turn out to be quite to the expectation you thought they were and people get disappointed all the time unfortunately a lot of people when they reach that point they just call it quits and but but the worst problem of that is that the next person they come across is going to be the exact same way that's why you hear people getting married two three four six eight ten twelve times amen because you can't find somebody that's not going to disappoint them the problem with that is uh in in congruent to that is the the pro the worst problem the worst problem listen to me that I have the worst problem that Newton Bennett has the worst problem I have is me it's not my wife it's not my children the disappointment of things Oh I thought it was going to be like this it's never like you thought it was going to be like that this person they're never going to be like that be marriage is not going to be that Pie in the Sky having children is just going to be the absolute it it there's it's full of toils it's full of trousers full of disappointments the thing is do you love that person so much that you're willing to Crest every one of those waves right right amen and continue to love them and continue to support them because they put up with me and that is that is a big ask amen my wife we're putting Tuesday a week could be 38 years she's put up with me as married now but I knew her four or five years before that so we're in our 40-plus years of putting up with me so uh that that's quite a that's quite an accomplishment she deserves a medal amen and more but Christy every one of those disciplines and I hope you understand I'm bringing all this carnality into this all this uh Humanity into this equation so that we when we start evolving over into the spiritual part of it we understand where we're coming from amen you've got to love that person so much as brother Branham said here that it's going to Crest every wave it's going to continue to press forward in Beyond every circumstance and Beyond every obstacle and Beyond every toll and trial is going to bring uh a greater maturity is going to bring a a a a greater relationship a close relationship together now obviously if you're not like-minded to the point that uh one person's a a Christian the other one isn't and coming against it there's whole different scenarios there I'm just talking about in the regular normal situation there's those disappointments and everything and in every way we get disappointed all the time the reason we're disappointed is because because of us we get ourselves built up to a place that we think something's going to be a certain way or somebody's going to be a certain way and we do the exact same thing with God so many times amen that that we get disappointed but it's not God that has disappointed us it is the expectation that we have that that brings us down and that draws us down to to feeling disappointed and that's a reason a lot of time people leave leave church that they leave God that they don't serve the Lord anymore serve the message anymore because as Jesus said about the the parable of the sower uh if there's nothing there to gain root if there's nothing there when those Trials come that wind blows it's just going to blow that seed and whatever it had just right off that rock that's right it's got nothing to hold it it's got nothing to keep it stable or grounded into and so that that disappointment makes it just blow away remember and I've gone to the scripture so many times Roman 8 28. amen God makes all things work together for those that love him yeah do you love him or not that comes the bottom line can you do without him a lot of people say they can't but yet they do they live their lives without him they go beyond it's like the children of Israel we said earlier what were the children of Israel have been if the cloud was there but Moses Gossman said oh I see the cloud but you know we're we're more mature we we know what we can do let's just keep on going we've seen this place up here let's go uh go up there that'd be a lot better place to Camp than back here and leave the cloud behind you you can't do that yeah yeah you'll end up in disaster as brother Ram said you rack up you make a mistake see that's what people do they say oh I can't live without them but yet they go on about their daily lives without him right yeah they live their own lives they do it their own ways and when trials and tribulations and things come and they're disappointed and they blame God for that right and they're blaming God for something that they created that they started that they themselves manufactured and yet they blame God for it how can you blame God for something that you did yourself disappointed to God and a lot of people leave because they don't really love God if they really loved God they would do what he told them to do they would obey his word now past the carnal part of it let's talk about the scripture not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven now do you think that those people are going to be disappointed of course look but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven what is the will of the father the will of the father is the word amen amen the will of God is his word and those that are following the will of God are following his word because he says he that doeth the will of my father and how do they do that by the spirit they do it by the spirit of God according to his word that's how they show how much of even Jesus is if you love me do what keep my Commandments that's what Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments do my word if people aren't doing it it just shows they don't love him right amen if you're obeying the word if you're living the word I'm not talking about not not ever making mistake or slipping up or something like that we all make mistakes we all venture down as we shouldn't go or doing things or speaking up or saying something which I mean we're human sometimes the human emotion takes over uh I got frustrated on the job the other day and um I'll probably hit the uh oh that's I'm trying to explain it so you'd understand it uh that you you drill a hole in the concrete and you have to drive up uh it looks like a bolt in the ground to hold the equipment that's in anything that's out here that's in concrete you you drill a hole and you have to drive that in and I probably hit it really hard because I forgot I got frustrated or something and and Chris my big friend I told you about diabetes he looked at me says man I thought you were going to cuss I said what the world would make you so what about me would ever make you think that I would have done that he said that was probably the closest I've ever seen I said I was just frustrated because I forgot what it was it wasn't even that was important but it was funny that he even told the other guys later he said man I thought you was going to cuss today I said were you disappointed he said no he said but I just you had gotten so frustrated with that thing I said well you know I'm human I make mistakes because it was almost like um and and rightfully so that they expect you to be a certain person and I am but I told him I said but I'm a human too I'm a flesh and blood I might make mistakes you might see me do things I shouldn't amen I thankfully by the grace of God I do hold my tongue about things like that but um I I get frustrated I get upset I'm a human being so if if I make a mistake as a human don't look down on me or think less of me because I'm just a human see but the problem a lot of people have especially with church or nominal churches and even sometimes in the message they they get themselves built up to such a place in Preachers and pastors and ministers they build themselves such platforms that people have to get a crick in the neck just to look up to speak to them I said I'm just a human I'm just a man like you are right I I I I I have no desire to be on any kind of pedestal yeah I I just happened to be a a a Son of God a flesh and blood man that God put the gift of ministry in that's I there's nothing beyond that right so I make mistakes just like you and get them to understand that yeah amen get them to understand that I think the the biggest problem a lot of people have with trying to become a Christian is everybody thinks well I got to quit doing this and I got to quit going there I gotta stop doing this and I gotta stop doing that and I try to tell people no you don't right you don't have to stop drinking you don't have to stop smoking you don't have to stop doing this or going here or doing that you don't have to stop doing that I said but if you really get Christ in your heart you're going to want to right yeah amen I said now you get Christ in your heart and then we'll see what happens but she had just try to get people to understand that I say because it all becomes carnal oh I quit I can't quit doing this well then don't quit amen don't quit doing it it's like brother random uh uh trying to remember the story of a brother was in the hospital brother man was going to go pray for him and the man just couldn't quit smoking he just he just couldn't quit him brother Brandon didn't tell him to quit smoking right and and brother ran them asked another brother he said go get a carton of cigarettes and take them to this man and tell them they're for me he said now I can't take God's money and buy something as filthy as a cigarette he said but if you take your money you've earned and go and buy them and take it but just tell them it's for me tell them that I've given them to you to give them to him he said he and tell them these are brother Adam he said that man went up there and he went up and prayed for him and he said here's the carton of cigarettes for you uh from Brother Brown and he said I'm over on the table he said the man never smoked another cigarette the rest of his life amen yeah you understand that that's the whole point you don't have to stop quit smoking but when God gets you in your heart you're gonna quit yeah because you don't want to do it anymore you don't have to quit drinking would you get Jesus in your heart you're not going to want to drink anymore because you know it's displeasing doing amen see and when those that are obeying his word by the spirit of God those are the sons of God what did Brother random tell us was the was the evidence of the Holy Ghost now not in this early Ministry because he tied with different things like love and such but when the Holy Spirit spoke to brother Brown now that's why sometimes I get and I don't mean this wrong because the early messages are just as important as the later ones but you got to be careful with some of the earlier a message quotes because there are things that brother Branham taught earlier in the 50s that he changed later yeah amen so you just got to be careful about that the he didn't change it the Lord changed him it's his as his ministry evolved and moved forward God showed him different things and revealed brother random even preached the seals wrong the first time right back in the 50s 50. he preached it wrong but when the Holy Spirit he was going to preach it wrong again but when the Holy Spirit came and straightened him out that changed the whole thing right there was no more brother random it was God speaking through that man to bring a true word to a bride of Christ yes and when brother and when God did that to brother Brown then it showed how how his ministry evolved and how his ministry changed over time amen that was some things he didn't change but uh but or there were some things he did there's a lot of things he did is very uh uh very important but brother random himself said that when when the seals were open it made the Bible a new book to him amen so how could you think how could you think things would not change amen because they do change uh and and they changed for by Revelation the word that speaks to us yes but what did he tell us earlier it and he talked about love and all he talked to Lee Vale about it and Lee Vale says Ah you know I think she got love that's probably about the greatest evidence and you know as well as I do you go out here and you see people that they you go to a a Buddhist temple or a uh uh uh a visit where monks are and I mean those people they're just the Tibetans and all they probably produce more love than a dozen of us uh just just from just sheer tolerance and and and uh and love projected and all and and in their humility and things uh but that's that's just a human way of training the body to act a certain way that's not having the Holy Ghost holding the Holy Ghost and obeying God's word is is two totally different things and just training yourself to live a certain way right to talk a certain way or to act a certain way amen but later on brother Branham says the Holy Spirit straight him out and told him it was not love and it was not this other he said it was receiving the word for your day am I the best evidence of the Holy Ghost or the evidence of the Holy Ghost was receiving the word for your day amen and what does that mean that means when you receive the word you take him the word you become the word and you live the word amen that's exactly what it means when you're living the word it's not just a makeup or put on it's the holy spirit that has brought that word into your heart if there's that twinge when people and I've talked to people people that's left and all that and and and they would admit to me they've had this twinge that you know maybe it was wrong here brother Branham was wrong here the scripture was wrong here or something they already interjected their own thoughts they had already interjected their own beliefs and own ways that's not the love of God that is absolutely contrary to the evidence of the Holy Spirit which says punctuates every word with an amen amen it punctuates every word with an amen Jesus is telling them he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven those are the ones those are the ones that he believed that he loved and that loved him look now many though many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name well gifts of the Spirit is you don't even have to be saved to have a gift of the spirit we know Romans tells us that yes amen yep and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name have done many wonderful works well when Jesus sent them out uh in in Matthew 10 and told him to go and cast out devils and do Miracles and lay hands on the sick and pray for him judas's Chariot was standing right there he was one of them when all these Miracles and all these gifts were manifested all these things were taking place Judas is carried the man that sold out Jesus Christ was standing right there doing the exact same things with the rest of them yeah amen but what was his downfall his downfall was he could not go on and receive the Holy Spirit there was something always in his heart that doubted always had to be amen had to be something that was there that doubted that doubted that that was the truth that Jesus even that Jesus was the Messiah even that that his word was the truth in obedience to his word there had to be something there to think oh there's a different way there's a better way there's something else there's uh this whatever it is reaching into the carnal into the mind that Satan has perverted to thinking things that that word is not correct and Jesus said you'll do this we did this and this and this and Jesus said then will I profess unto them I never knew you right depart from me ye that work iniquity people think they do this in Jesus name they do this and well actually they don't do very much in Jesus name anymore it's all in the fall of it's on the Holy Ghost they don't do very much in Jesus name but they'll come and say we did this in thine age oh we baptized in your name Jesus no you didn't negative you go back and God will play that back across that great canvas and say look here father son Holy Ghost that's not a name right amen and that's something very simple they cross themselves as something that's a hedonistic tradition in the scripture do you know that yeah Crossing yourself in the Bible is a hedonistic trait yes yes I can show you amen but people do it they think that's like the most religious act that you can perform is when they cross themselves they even gotten a discussion uh at lunch the brothers at lunch uh the the workers my co-workers at lunch talking about Crossing themselves and I looked I said well is there actually a a right way to do it oh yeah there's the right way and they numb I mean they grew up in Catholic school or went to Catholic church or something but none of them professes anything but y'all yeah there's the right way you do this this and this and I said well what difference does that made and see nobody could answer it because they don't know any more than that and I and I almost I came so close but I didn't want I felt like I felt checked in my spirit that it would have been of offensive right uh to say well you know it's a hedonistic treat trait to do that in the scripture but I held uh I felt checked to do it so the Lord showed me there but people will say we did this and we did this and we he said depart for me that work iniquity I never knew You Now understand that never knew you means I never had relation with you we never were together we uh uh I I I have never known you because see people say well how could he be Almighty God's no beginning for men and not know these people well you can think intellectually is one thing but knowing his relationship is something totally different knowing you as a person and yet having a relationship with you is two different things I know a lot of people in my life but there's only one person I've ever known in my entire life that I've known in the fashion that I know my wife she's the only one ever amen only one my by the grace of God I ever will amen it's the only one I ever knew in that way see so you can say well I knew them but that's not what Jesus is saying Jesus is saying this in a in a relationship capacity I never knew you means that I we never had relations amen God knew they were going to be born because he's almighty God he's omnipotent knows all things but having that relationship absolutely not oh we did this in my name we did this in our name you think those people are going to be disappointed after they feel like that they've done all these things that they say that they've done and yet Jesus looks at them and said I never knew you we never had relations you think you think oh absolutely most definitely those people are going to be disappointed look at this look at this he said in questions and answers uh let's see if this is the one that I wanted to read to you amen uncertain sound let's let's go to that uncertain sound he said there there's where so many people today is going to be terribly disappointed at the day of judgment to know that they've lived in church to know that they've done good deeds do Deeds get you into heaven relationship amen relationship we've already read that Deeds don't get you in heaven because they said we did this we did this these don't get you there UE never had relation relation is what gets you there being born again yes amen done good deeds to know that they have treated their neighbor right to know that they have been loyal to the people loyal to the church and in their minds have be in their minds have believed that Jesus Christ the son of God and be condemned at the day of their lives if you go back and and see the life the life would dictate to them to understand that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is obeying the word amen obey the word now are they going to be disappointed sure they're going to be disappointing amen they're absolutely going to be disappointed he said there's uh straight As the gate there's going to be some great disappointment at the Judgment he said The Bootlegger he knows where he's going to go so does The Beer Hound uh so does the prostitute know where she'll stand so does the Gambler knows where he is standing so does the drunkard where he'll stand they'll not be disappointed they know where they are they know what their expectations are in fact a lot of people today are more vocal about their desire to go to hell than anything anyway right they think hell is going to be a funner place than Heaven yeah yeah a lot of people I've heard uh people voice that yeah yeah that they they want to go there that that that's their desire if there's not going to be any beer in heaven I don't want to go if there's not going to be any smoking or pot in heaven I don't want to go if there's not going to be any rightist living gambling and all this I don't want to go and they'd rather go to hell they're not going to be just appointed now they might get surprised when they're in hell and it's nothing like they thought it was going to be right very much like it's going to be a bunch of beer joints gambling joints and uh prostitution and they think it's going to be all like that they're going to be vastly disappointed in fact brother Brandon when God showed him hell he just fell and fell and fell and fell and fell he called for Mama there's no mama called for Daddy there's no Daddy called for God there's no God he said a literal burning hell would have been a more of a pleasure than what he was going through right than just falling and falling and falling and nothing and nobody there he said a literal burning hell would have been better than that now they might get surprised at what they find when they get there but are they going to be disappointed no they wanted to go there they knew they were going to go there the one that gets disappointed is going to be are those whose fault they were right that's where the disappointment is they thought they were right this group here oh we did this in that name we did this in that name we did this in that name but did you obey my word you have the Holy Ghost did you did you obey the word that I sent I sent a prophet to just talk about the last I sent a prophet did you obey his word did you live by the dictates of the word that came forth in the day of uh of Luther were were you living a life of justification and it's Wesley's life of sanctification and see those are very important attributes that we must attain to Saints we talked about the other day the justification and the sanctification are extremely important things nobody seems to ever want to talk about because we've gone so far beyond that into the Holy Ghost which is true but if you try to go into the Holy Ghost without the justification without the sanctification you'll never get there you can't get to the Holy Ghost unless you are first Justified and Sanctified so there's got to be those that come along but if you get to those points just like Judas did amen Judas was justified he was Sanctified uh John 10 10 Jesus said Sanctified them by their by the by Thy word Lord and Judas was standing right there with him amen Justified thanks bud but when it came to going up to the to receiving the Holy Ghost he sold his Lord out for 30 pieces of silver and hung himself right amen killed himself we'll just say it that way amen committed suicide so then what happens to Judas is he disappointed look the people that know are the ones that are not going to be they're not going to be disappointed but the ones that don't know see and that's the most dangerous place a person can be in today so many times people come right up right up through justification right up into sanctification they received they received that uh uh cleansing and they they become uh cleansed and clean up their lives and uh they they look like a Christian and play that part but they just don't seem to be able to go into receiving the Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit is going to lead them and guide them into all truth that Holy Spirit is going to be what anchors them and keeps them and the evidence of that Holy Spirit is obeying God's word amen becoming that word and living that word amen and when you do you know who you are amen the sin question is obliterated because you know who you are because the word says who you are forget about mistakes forget about wrongdoings amen what is the love that you have in your heart does that love lead you to obedience in God's word amen or does it lead you to doubting God's word if you doubt God's word that's a whole different thing oh well I doubt what brother Brown said here I doubt what the Bible says here I'm not sure if this is exactly the way it should be you don't have the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit punctuates every word with an amen amen amen amen every word with the name in that punctuation every word for amen you've been ticketed for your journey you have the ticket you have the token amen that will take you to where you need to go look that most dangerous spot brother Brown says in Jubilee year 1954 one of the older ones in Jubilee year he said so if you are lukewarm brother that's a dangerous place that you could stand is in a lukewarm condition Jesus said either be hot or cold either before me or all your with all your heart or against me if you just live a pretty good life that'll never count your self-righteous Rags will never stand at the day of judgment amen amen never stand questions and answers he said I hope you don't get angry with me but this is going to choke you he said now look ASA I'm gonna say this anyhow he said again he said I hope you don't get angry with me he said there's a people that believe in justification by faith see and they live a good clean holy life they believe in sanctification too look at Judas is carry it Genesis carry was justified when he believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and accept him as his personal savior Judas is scared you see I got the scripture wrong here Genesis carrot was Sanctified in Saint John 17 17. I think I said 10 10. uh if I was wrong forgive me but it's Saint John 17 17. he was Sanctified Saint John 17 17 and was given power in Matthew 10 To Go On cast out devils and Genesis Karen come back after he healed the sick he cast out Devils he came back rejoicing shouting just as much as any good holy roll you've ever seen he said the Bible said so but when he come to Pentecost he showed his colors when it come to Pentecost he showed his colors it got right up to that point when it come to receiving the Holy Ghost it showed us colors how many people today they go through life and I I'm afraid that a lot of times and I'm going to say this I hope nobody gets angry with me but even at the Tabernacle that people were treating baptism like it was their salvation that's right and I said oh baptism is essential absolutely it's one of the ordinances that God left us but it's the it's the next step to receiving the Holy Ghost right I said that that just shows that you want to prove to the rest of the world that you've accepted Jesus as your savior but it has not as of yet shown that Jesus has received you as his son or daughter that is where you realize you've got something when Jesus fills you with his Spirit that's his proving to the world that he's received you amen you can receive him all you want millions of people say they received Jesus but has Jesus received you and so they go on in life and they live their life and they fall into this group of people amen even the make-believer falls into that group of people we know Matthew chapter 25 let's read it here real quick Matthew 25 uh we'll start with verse 10. even the make-believer the foolish virgin will say look while they were while they went to buy the bridegroom King and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying the Lord Lord open to us now remember they were virtuous they were all 10 virtuous they had never been defiled by any man's idea right yet they just had not received the Holy Ghost the answered and said they say Lord Lord open us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for ye for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh but go back to the 12th verse Jesus told them I know you not now that's a different I know the word no is the same as it was that we just read in Matthew 7. but if you go look it up in the Greek you'll find that it actually has two different meanings and this no means that I am ignoring you it's it doesn't mean that we didn't have relation it doesn't mean that I never I never knew you he's just saying I know you're not or I'm ignoring you right now I'm putting you off if you will the door's shut and when the door's shut nobody gets in nobody gets out we learned that from Noah's Ark when God shut the door nobody can get in the ark nobody can get out of the Ark Noah couldn't even open the door to any of his relatives friends neighbors or anybody God shut the door that was it when God shuts the door that's it they're on the outside and they're knocking again in he says I I don't hear you I'm not listening to you amen now what are those people gonna have to go through judgment right they're going to have to go through judgment and and seal their testimony that they had of Jesus Christ with their own blood whereas the bride she goes in the Rapture and she sets the marriage supper of the Lamb right while the foolish Virgin Goes to the tribulation now how many of them doesn't say Amen but let's go over to Saint Luke because I won't be much longer Saint Luke chapter 13. and let's read beginning with verse 23. then said one unto him Lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them and you can imagine how many of you would have thought that if you were one of the ten even if you were Judas if you were one of the 10 and you were following along with Jesus for about three years now and you're sitting there thinking well Jesus and maybe in your mind maybe audibly Jesus we we've been going around everywhere for three years and we've not added one single person to our congregation it's still the same 10 people that was here when you called us you called us one right after the other and every one of us all 10 of us have followed you ever since we've been gone three years now we haven't added one single person you imagine that would cross their minds it will cross my mind amen this has been one more person added to this church Jesus and you're God Almighty of Heaven and Earth and don't have but one don't haven't added one more follower to your congregation yeah is that the truth when he was crucified he only had nine that believed it because Judas has already killed himself amen so hadn't had one so you can imagine their thoughts went to a certain place well they're asking him now Lord are there only going to be a few saved there's only 10 of us are there only going to be a few say he said unto them strive to enter in at the Straight Gate for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able now these are a group of people that are seeking it but are not able to get in well there's a lot of people that seek it this churches will throw excuse me churches were full this morning of people all around the world that claim they're seeking amen but Jesus here says that they will seek to enter in and shall not be able well what was it what were the five foolish virgins the five foolish were seeking to get in they just didn't have the Holy Ghost amen amen amen when Once the Master of the House is risen up and has shut the door ye begins to stand without him uh to knock at the door saying Lord Lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you I know you I know you not when she are now that he's talking to the same place that Noah is the same one that was in Matthew 25. amen I'm ignoring you he's stepped forward the door has been shut the the bride didn't shut it the five wise didn't shut it amen God shut it God shut the door on Noah's Ark God shut that door and there's a time that that door will be shut saying there will be a time where that door will be shut and we'll still be here and there will be nobody else saved beyond that point right or born again yes amen there won't be one beyond that point because the door will be shut and we'll still be here now I don't believe will be my opinion I don't believe we'll be here very long uh the Bible doesn't specify for the brown never specified or gave a time or a number of days but in my opinion I don't think it's going to be very long that's my opinion but there will be a time and and Jesus said here they will say Lord Lord open unto us and he shall say unto you I know not which ye are amen amen because when God shuts the door the door is shut there's no more can come in there's no more can get can go out amen what was the one thing the foolish virgins were lacking the Holy Ghost now what did Jesus go on and say okay that's that's one uh a parable of the Bible that he's referring to now he goes on and he said then then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou has taught in our streets but he shall say I tell you I know you not when she are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity it's a different there shall be weeping gnashing of teeth and ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust out you think they're going to be disappointed absolutely they were thinking brother random said you'll be surprised at the ones that'll make it you'll be very surprised at the ones who don't make it right amen I just believe I'm one that will make it amen you have to believe the exact same thing because you know who you are you know who your redeemer is you don't fall in this category that says oh we thought we you obey the word your whole heart's desire is is in obeying this message and obeying this word and living that life and it is that way because it is listen to me it is that way because you have been born again your desires are that way because you've been born again you have the Holy Ghost if you did not have the Holy Ghost your desire would not be for that amen it might be 99 of that but there's going to be one thing out there that's going to have a doubt and that's exactly where uh Eve was she believed the word but when Satan came with just that one word that Twisted it and and that doubt was there and all of a sudden he was able to sow a seed and that so is that that seed sown the king king as strangely enough another discussion we had at lunch I I can't remember it was the same day or the next day that we started talking about Adam and Eve and so and and what I'm talking about an apple I said you know it wasn't an apple right and the manager of the group he said oh yeah I knew that a long time ago the Catholic the one that's a that was went to Catholics they sell he said that took me a long time to figure that out but I found that out a long time ago but I said well yeah it could have been an apple because it produced cane That's Right amen and they actually strangely enough all these guys and don't know and have no affiliation degree you you go tell some scholar in the scripture or some denominational that they'll think you're crazy amen you get a uh you get a table full of people that don't really claim to believe anything and they understand it yeah yeah it's amazing though isn't it how it goes just the way it is with people but it's true amen these will be these will be disappointed amen this group will be disappointed they shall come from the east or the west from the North and the South sit down in the kingdom of God and behold there are the last which shall be first and they're the first which shall be last there's that that same group of people amen it shows it proves that there's something in you you can look at the Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young Ruler was probably one of the most Pious individuals in the scripture even so even to the point that the Bible says that Jesus looked on the man and loved him amen he was that good of a person he was that humble or that Pious or whatever you want to say about it the Bible says and there aren't many places he's Jesus looked on him and loved him but in the end he had he had to say depart you work of iniquity yeah because he turned Jesus down Jesus gave him the way we'll do this this and this this oh well I've done that since I was a boy I can that's no problem sell all you got and give it to the poor oh he couldn't do that amen there's the difference there's the difference if you love me do what do what I tell you keep my Commandments what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost obeying the word what was that to the Rich Young Ruler that was the word that was the word to him and he couldn't obey it so what did I tell you he didn't have Goods he didn't have what it took and we know where his eyes lifted up where he ended up in the scripture but it's good to manage probably you ever want to find him again to the point that Jesus loved him he and and the evidence in his life was that after he turned Christ down he got richer he got more famous he built more barns he got he had to buy he had to build more barns just to put more of his stuff in a boat a jet ski a a a a pontoon boat one boat wasn't good enough he had to have a pontoon too you know he had to have six more cars because the one he had wasn't sufficient and I had to build more barns just and so you look and say well Mike he must really be blessed of God look at how God has blessed him and he's prospering no he turned God down yeah yeah so what did all of that do for him yeah once he ended up in hell in in the grave in a place of where he was lost a place where he was lost disappointed I could only imagine I Can Only Imagine amen one more quote I'm going to close friends tonight this is uh we have found him 1953. oh one two friends tonight I believe if any man will come in this day tonight reverently before God say now I'm not going to take any of my thoughts there you go dime to self I'm not going to take any of my thoughts I'm just going to open my heart to you God you reveal yourself to me I want to see I believe God will reveal himself to the people to the people that wants to find him he has never disappointed anyone amen amen it's the ones that get it built up and expect it a certain way and they don't get it well then I just don't believe God then because it didn't come exactly the way you thought it was it's like the boy brother man talked about the boy throwing the prayer book in the trash or in the fire because his mom didn't get healed she died anyway well I just forget the whole thing then what you said start with but if you believe God you know that this is bringing about the work of the Lord and his good pleasure and that's what we're here for yes that is what we're here for we're here for his good pleasure whatever that is send me lead me show me help me reveal to me whatever it is amen we're obedient to you Lord whatever it might be will I Stumble sure will I make mistakes absolutely right well well I come to uh uh disappoint myself all the time but God will never discipline amen and he knows and I'm gonna say this is the last thing my opinion we never disappoint him because he knows us amen do we make mistakes absolutely do we disappoint one another yeah because of our expectations but God's expectations aren't up there his expectations are worth he knows who you are he knows who all of us are amen you see everybody preaches about how the devil knows our weaknesses well God knows them too God knows what those free God knows where you need help God knows where you need fortification God knows your strengths he knows everything about you when something comes up or
