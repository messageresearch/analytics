[37:26] I'm going speak on missing the Mark

[39:48] us fulfill that purpose Lord we commit
[39:51] it to you Lord ask your blessings now in
[39:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[39:55] pray amen amen
[39:58] amen Romans chapter 3 we'll begin
[40:01] reading with verse 19 Romans
[40:05] 3:19 amen now listen Clos here now we
[40:07] know that what things soever the law say
[40:11] it say to them who are under the law
[40:14] that every mouth may be stopped and all
[40:17] the world may become guilty before God
[40:20] therefore by the Deeds of the law there
[40:22] shall no flesh be justified in his sight
[40:26] for by by the law is the knowledge of
[40:29] sin but now the righteousness of God
[40:32] without the law is Manifest being
[40:35] witnessed by the law and the prophets
[40:38] even the righteousness of God which is
[40:41] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
[40:44] upon all them that believeth for there
[40:46] is no difference for all have sinned and
[40:50] come short of the glory of God you could
[40:52] be seated if you'd
[40:55] like looking at that word s today as
[40:57] some of you may have already gathered by
[40:59] the title missing the mark looking at
[41:02] that word sin has been mentioned here a
[41:04] couple of times as Paul did to the
[41:06] Romans in this letter mentioned the word
[41:08] sin a couple of times sin is the word
[41:10] that means to well one of the uh things
[41:13] that it means is to miss the mark amen
[41:17] sin is to miss the mark uh to to do
[41:21] wrong to
[41:22] transgress uh an overstepping of the law
[41:26] uh the law is set because that was God's
[41:29] mind that was God's thought that was
[41:31] that's the things that we know that that
[41:34] was laid down in the scripture for us to
[41:37] follow uh for them back in the Old
[41:40] Testament to follow was to be the law it
[41:44] came apparent very quickly as God
[41:45] already knew obviously that humans
[41:48] cannot follow the law right it's just
[41:50] not possible we we fall we fail we make
[41:54] mistakes all the time we're born in sin
[41:56] shap become the world speaking Li so we
[41:58] fall short of that Mark continually we
[42:02] fall short of that of that Target see
[42:04] that Target is is that if you will that
[42:07] Target is that law amen that's the
[42:09] Target that we all shoot for that Target
[42:12] is is what we know that God laid out is
[42:16] uh Thou shalt not Thou shalt not uh that
[42:19] we know that God has put forth that's
[42:21] the mark That's the Target that we're
[42:23] shooting for and we all still uh shoot
[42:26] in that direction amen a lot of people
[42:28] think that when Jesus Christ came and
[42:30] shed his blood that it did away with the
[42:32] law not realizing that what he did was
[42:35] magnify the law he brought the L he
[42:37] brought a greater light onto the law
[42:40] because once there was uh a Grace given
[42:43] to the law then it helped us understand
[42:46] really what the consequences of the law
[42:49] was right but when the grace came it
[42:51] came even more boldly to understand that
[42:55] we are to live uh a Godly life A Life
[42:59] That's pleasing to the Lord uh to to sin
[43:02] is to transgress or to overstep the mark
[43:06] to miss the mark amen but the thing is
[43:09] today that I'd like to get to and I want
[43:11] to read back through this scripture
[43:13] again but the thing I want to get to
[43:15] today is that the world uh doesn't seem
[43:21] to care about missing the mark amen the
[43:24] only the only ones that really care
[43:27] about missing the mark missing uh the
[43:32] Target that God has set the only ones
[43:34] that really seem to care those that are
[43:36] Christians right amen the world doesn't
[43:40] seem to care uh they think
[43:43] that because they missed the mark uh
[43:47] they can just move the mark amen you
[43:49] can't move the mark you don't move the
[43:51] target amen if there's something wrong
[43:54] with shooting at the Target you got to
[43:56] fix the problem
[43:57] and the problem's not the target the
[43:59] target is just there as a stationary
[44:01] item for you to aim at you don't move
[44:03] the target but everybody thinks that the
[44:05] way to solve the problem is to move the
[44:09] Target right amen well uh I I I can't I
[44:12] can't hit this Mark so I'm going to move
[44:15] the target to make it fit doesn't work
[44:17] that way if you miss the mark you don't
[44:19] move the target you fix the problem the
[44:22] problem is me yes the problem is us the
[44:25] problem is Humanity not the mark not
[44:27] what God set as the target for us that's
[44:30] not the problem amen the problem is us
[44:33] and we miss that Mark but now look uh
[44:37] it's very poignant that he writes out
[44:40] here that we know that the things going
[44:42] back to the 19th verse again now now we
[44:44] know that the things which there uh
[44:46] things soever the law saith it sayth to
[44:50] them that are under the law amen
[44:52] whatever the whatever is saying is
[44:54] saying to those that are under the law
[44:56] amen now now if you're going down Oracle
[44:59] the speed limit is 45 if you're going
[45:02] down Oracle you're under that law right
[45:05] you're not under the law of the speed
[45:07] limit of Oracle if you're driving down
[45:10] river amen right you're not under Oracle
[45:14] law you're under River law right amen
[45:17] and River I'm not sure what it is
[45:19] probably still 45 but let's just say
[45:20] it's 30 if you get on River the river
[45:23] the River Road is 30 for example it's
[45:25] not I think it's 45 but
[45:27] uh just speaking hypotheticals the law
[45:29] that you have that you're under when
[45:31] you're under writing down Oracle you're
[45:33] under that law but once you turn on the
[45:35] river you're no longer under the law of
[45:37] Oracle you're under the law of river
[45:40] amen now you see when when you come out
[45:43] from under that
[45:44] law only those that are under that is
[45:48] the law speaking to the cop cannot stop
[45:52] you going down river and say the speed
[45:54] liement on Oracle
[45:55] 45 he can't do that that's that that is
[45:59] not a righteous way to judge a person by
[46:03] some other standard the only standard
[46:06] that you have when you're driving down
[46:07] river is what's what is on river right
[46:10] not what is on Oracle yes amen what is
[46:13] on Oracle now when the law speaks is
[46:16] speaking to those that are under it amen
[46:19] not those that aren't under it so
[46:21] understand those that are under the law
[46:24] as it speaks those things that the law
[46:27] law says it's saying to them that are
[46:29] under that law amen not to those that
[46:32] are not under the law now when you're
[46:35] going through
[46:36] life and you're under and and and you
[46:40] haven't accepted Christ you mean we're
[46:42] all under that law amen you're you're
[46:45] under the law to live by that to live by
[46:47] those rules and regulations and and
[46:50] anybody that wants to decide to reject
[46:52] Jesus Christ then you're sitting under
[46:54] that law but once you go in life and you
[46:56] recognize that Christ is the way Christ
[46:59] is the truth he's the way he's the life
[47:02] when you realize that and you turn that
[47:04] corner and you start going a different
[47:07] path and that's the path of
[47:08] righteousness the path of godliness the
[47:11] path that Jesus Christ would send you
[47:12] down you're no longer on this path
[47:15] you've turned the corner you're going
[47:16] down a different Road you're you're
[47:19] going down the path of of of Jesus
[47:22] Christ you you you've
[47:24] left not left uh but you you've turned a
[47:29] corner from strict law to being under
[47:32] grace yes amen now that doesn't mean
[47:36] that we don't obey the law that doesn't
[47:38] mean that the law loses effect doesn't
[47:40] have any effect but you're not under the
[47:44] law because the because the law has no
[47:47] effect on you anymore now you go down
[47:50] Oracle I hope I'm making sense with this
[47:53] if you go down the Oracle and you go
[47:56] under the speed limit the law has no
[47:59] effect on you amen amen none cop can't
[48:03] stop you nobody can give you a ticket
[48:07] nobody can write you up for doing
[48:08] anything wrong and if you're under this
[48:11] speed liit if you're if you're obeying
[48:13] the law the law doesn't apply to
[48:15] you amen amen it only applies if you're
[48:19] breaking it if you're going over it if
[48:21] you're transgressing it if you're
[48:22] missing the mark That's when a cop can
[48:25] stop you right amen but now when you go
[48:28] and you turn the corner and you go down
[48:31] the way of Christ the blood grace mercy
[48:34] love forgiveness uh sins gone amen what
[48:39] are you under you're not under that law
[48:41] amen you're under grace yes now that
[48:44] doesn't mean that we just sin willfully
[48:49] because we can oh God will forgive me no
[48:53] we don't take the grace of God and make
[48:55] a disgrace out of it because what does
[48:57] it do now look let's continue
[48:59] on it is only a law to those who are
[49:02] under the law that every mouth may be
[49:05] stopped and all the world may become
[49:07] guilty before God so that just stops all
[49:10] the discussion that stops all the
[49:12] chatter it stops all the excuses well I
[49:15] got an excuse for this and I got an
[49:17] excuse for that and whatever else and
[49:20] you know the world's full of excuses
[49:21] today and unfortunately we become a
[49:24] society that accepts excuses in instead
[49:26] of holding people accountable to what
[49:28] their actions are uh which is a very sad
[49:32] thing but it stops all the mouth it
[49:34] stops all the Talking it stops all the
[49:36] reasoning all that's gone because you're
[49:39] under the law the law says if you go 46
[49:41] and a 45 you're
[49:44] guilty Amen
[49:46] period you're guilty
[49:49] okay therefore by the Deeds by the Deeds
[49:53] of the law there shall no flesh be
[49:57] justified in his sight because you
[50:00] cannot be justified by a law you cannot
[50:03] be made as though you never did it amen
[50:08] which is
[50:10] Justified in the sight of God by simple
[50:14] law amen amen if the cop gives you a
[50:18] ticket that's on your
[50:20] record they might not you might can go
[50:22] to traffic court and not get any points
[50:24] on your license or no points on on
[50:26] insurance they
[50:28] may give you a little Grace if you will
[50:33] Grace for breaking the law amen traffic
[50:36] court is Grace for breaking the law it
[50:40] says I'm not I'm going to I'm going to
[50:41] charge you a penalty but I'm not going
[50:43] to do this and I'm not going to do this
[50:45] I'm going to let it I'm going to let it
[50:46] slide if you will but you got to go to
[50:48] traffic court whatever they even do that
[50:49] anymore I don't even know if they do
[50:51] anymore Anyway by the grace of God I
[50:53] haven't gotten a ticket in a long time
[50:55] thank the Lord uh but you but but the
[50:58] law does not justify you amen because
[51:02] then it says but it still goes on your
[51:04] record to say you did it amen
[51:07] justification says you never did it
[51:11] praise the Lord so under the
[51:13] understanding the Deeds of the law there
[51:15] can no flesh be
[51:17] justified amen because it'll always be
[51:19] there that you did it
[51:22] amen and justified in his sight for by
[51:25] the law is the knowledge of sin amen
[51:28] without without the law without God
[51:31] saying don't do this we didn't know it
[51:34] was wrong to do
[51:36] that right amen how would you know it's
[51:39] wrong to do something if there's isn't
[51:41] something there that says don't do it
[51:43] amen When God says don't do it then you
[51:45] understand that's something that you
[51:48] shouldn't do to please the Lord amen so
[51:51] you know that that's something and that
[51:54] knowledge brings about a
[51:57] transgression if there's not a knowledge
[51:59] of it there's no transgression there's
[52:01] no law if there's nothing there that God
[52:03] says don't do this then how can you
[52:06] transgress something that doesn't exist
[52:08] right it has to exist so the knowledge
[52:12] brought the the law brought a knowledge
[52:15] of sin don't understand that if you if
[52:19] you if that law is there and you miss
[52:22] that and you transgress it you've missed
[52:25] the mark you you sinned you've done
[52:28] wrong in the eyes of God you've done
[52:31] wrong in the in in the eyes of the law
[52:34] uh and in this case in the eyes of God
[52:36] you've done wrong amen when you've done
[52:39] wrong then you've missed the Mark when
[52:41] you missed the mark you don't go dig up
[52:44] the the speed liit
[52:46] sign and say Excuse me sir I think this
[52:48] should be 55 and just dig up the speed
[52:51] limit sign and and or or or take a piece
[52:53] of black tape and change the four to a
[52:55] five and say well 55
[52:57] now amen that's what the world does
[53:00] though right you don't take black paint
[53:03] and try to paint over the four and make
[53:05] it a five and say okay speed limit now
[53:07] is 55 I didn't break the law yes you did
[53:10] because your mouth is shut remember you
[53:13] don't have a thought the law is 45 I
[53:16] don't care if you change the sign or not
[53:18] it's still 45 right amen but that's what
[53:22] people try to do they try to tape over
[53:24] the sign or bait the sign and make it
[53:26] fit their lives amen just saying that
[53:29] you can't live it doesn't make it not a
[53:32] effect right amen a lot of people say
[53:36] that but that's the truth amen you you
[53:40] can't change the speed limit simply
[53:42] because you can't drive
[53:44] it you can't you don't change the speed
[53:47] limit just because you can't drive it
[53:49] you don't change the scripture just
[53:51] because you can't live it right I've
[53:54] heard so many times people say well
[53:56] believe it I just can't live
[53:58] it then you don't believe it that that's
[54:01] my opinion yes amen if you believe it
[54:04] you're going to live it because to to
[54:06] believe something to have a revelation
[54:07] of something is is to be a part of you
[54:10] of who you are amen that's that that's
[54:12] like me saying I can't live the life of
[54:14] a white
[54:16] man I I I don't know the life of a white
[54:19] man I that that's just foolishness I
[54:22] live the life of a white man because I'm
[54:23] a white man amen right if if you're a
[54:28] Christian you believe it you know it's
[54:30] the truth and and and can't live it
[54:33] can't drive
[54:34] it then you're a transgressor of the law
[54:38] right God's not going to move that Mark
[54:40] for you psych story I think I told y'all
[54:44] one time about a sales consultant a man
[54:46] who used to call on us at at uh when I
[54:48] worked in business in Charlotte and was
[54:50] puring manager he' come in and talk to
[54:52] the old purchasing manager after I had
[54:53] got hired and he was talking to him
[54:55] about trying to start go to church he
[54:57] said church is like a glove you just
[54:59] find one that fits you I said man what a
[55:01] lie of the devil that is yes amen amen I
[55:04] don't go somewhere to try to find
[55:05] something that's going to fit me right
[55:08] amen I go somewhere that I'm going to
[55:10] change to fit him amen I want to be the
[55:14] one to change I want to be the one to be
[55:16] molded Into His Image I don't want his
[55:19] image to be molded to me oh my what a
[55:22] mess that would be right amen I I want
[55:26] to go go someplace that I'm going to be
[55:27] molded where the words preach that I'm
[55:30] going to be molded not something that's
[55:31] a glove that fit on a hand just go with
[55:33] whatever fits you doesn't work that way
[55:36] amen this is the
[55:38] glove amen put it on it doesn't fit
[55:42] change your life to where it will fit
[55:44] amen cuz that's the only thing that's
[55:46] going to be acceptable to God anything
[55:48] else is missing the mark right amen any
[55:51] other way you've missed the mark amen
[55:54] it's got to be God's way or it's or it's
[55:56] or it's no way so without without a
[55:59] knowledge of the law there is no sin
[56:02] there's no
[56:03] transgress if there's not something to
[56:06] say don't do it amen now let's go 21
[56:09] 21st verse but now but now look now
[56:12] we're getting ready to we're getting
[56:14] ready to make that turn on the river but
[56:17] now the righteousness of God without the
[56:20] law is manifested praise the lord it's
[56:23] been uncovered it's been revealed it's
[56:26] been made known that the righteousness
[56:29] of God is with without the law is
[56:34] manifested praise the Lord what is the
[56:36] righteousness of God it's a pure
[56:39] existence of who God is amen it's not
[56:44] even necessarily an attribute of God it
[56:47] is it is just who God is amen and when
[56:51] you come into that place through the
[56:53] grace of God Amen through the blood of
[56:56] of Jesus Christ and through the grace of
[56:58] God and you come into that place of
[57:02] righteousness then there is
[57:04] nothing praise the Lord there's
[57:07] absolutely nothing that can be held
[57:10] guilty to your charge nothing the grace
[57:14] of God and the and the and the and the
[57:17] blood the of the annihilating of sin

[57:30] the first place amen praise God you've
[57:33] turned a corner now amen and that corner
[57:36] has brought you onto the street of
[57:38] righteousness and that righteousness of
[57:41] God now that is without the law why is

[57:50] no effect on you amen yes you're living
[57:54] the life of God the law has no effect on
[57:57] you why because you don't steal because

[58:20] on you what is that now that is the
[58:22] righteousness of God right now what
[58:24] happens now if if we do happen to
[58:27] transgress in some way because of our

[58:34] of Jesus Christ is there and you and you
[58:37] just ask God for forgiveness right amen

[58:43] just and faithful to forgive praise the
[58:46] Lord amen and now the right it doesn't

[1:00:13] there's too many people I know that do
[1:00:15] live it amen and to say you can't live
[1:00:17] it when so many other people do live it
[1:00:20] it doesn't hold water with me amen you

[1:00:50] moment you have brought yourself outside
[1:00:53] of the economy of God yes right amen

[1:00:58] cony of God yes instead of making
[1:01:02] excuses just own up to it amen I I I
[1:01:06] know I truly believe as I speak as a man
[1:01:10] I truly believe God will respect that
[1:01:12] more than he would the other the excuses
[1:01:14] let's go over to St
[1:01:17] Luke let's read a very familiar story
[1:01:28] amen Luke
[1:01:29] chapter
[1:01:31] 15 Luke chapter 15 verse 17 about
[1:01:35] prodical son of course very familiar
[1:01:37] scripture
[1:01:39] read
[1:01:41] amen chapter
[1:01:43] 15 has so many wonderful lessons in here
[1:01:46] and when he look now and when he the
[1:01:49] prodical son came to himself I just love
[1:01:52] that
[1:01:53] part amen when he comes to realize who
[1:01:56] he was amen he wasn't a popper he wasn't
[1:02:00] a beggar he wasn't a street uh uh urant
[1:02:05] whatever they
[1:02:07] call he was the son of a king amen amen
[1:02:11] and when he come to realize he wasn't a
[1:02:13] pig with his head in the SLO he he he
[1:02:17] wasn't
[1:02:18] a a beggar
[1:02:20] poer he come to realize he was the son
[1:02:23] of a king yes amen he knew he was the
[1:02:26] son of the king amen amen and when he
[1:02:29] come to realize that when he come to
[1:02:32] himself when he came to himself because
[1:02:35] himself was always according to his
[1:02:40] Birthright that's who himself was
[1:02:42] himself was always and there's and you
[1:02:46] cannot change it amen no matter how much
[1:02:50] uh uh my parents might have wanted to
[1:02:52] disown me they could not do it amen
[1:02:55] impossible POS all you need today is a
[1:02:57] simple DNA test that could tell that
[1:03:00] George Jim Bennett Jr was my papa
[1:03:02] there's no denying it amen could change
[1:03:05] my name they could change Theirs
[1:03:07] Whatever but there's no way you could
[1:03:09] deny my
[1:03:11] DNA said that I was his son can't change
[1:03:14] it myself that's who I am himself
[1:03:18] himself when he came to himself himself
[1:03:21] was according to his Birthright amen and
[1:03:24] his Birthright was he was the son of
[1:03:26] this King this man yes amen I don't know
[1:03:29] if he was a king but he was the son of
[1:03:31] this rich man and there's no way that
[1:03:34] that could be changed no matter what he
[1:03:35] did no matter where he went no matter
[1:03:37] what he said no matter how hard he
[1:03:38] wanted to distance himself no matter how
[1:03:40] much he sinned no matter how hard he
[1:03:42] sinned no matter how deep he went into
[1:03:44] sin didn't matter didn't change his
[1:03:47] Birthright at all so when he came to
[1:03:50] himself himself was always he was the
[1:03:55] son of the this man this rich man amen
[1:03:58] so when he came to himself he
[1:04:00] realized he said how many hired Servants
[1:04:03] of my fathers have bread enough to spare
[1:04:06] and I perish with
[1:04:08] Hunger I will arise and go to my father
[1:04:11] and I will say to him

[1:07:11] servants he arose came to his father but
[1:07:14] when he was yet a great way off his
[1:07:16] father saw him had compassion and ran
[1:07:19] and fell on his neck and kissed
[1:07:21] him I just that's just my vision of what
[1:07:26] I saw Jesus did for me when I came to
[1:07:29] him yes
[1:07:30] amen he knew I was coming and ran and
[1:07:34] fell on my neck and I felt such a warm
[1:07:36] presence amen amen praise the Lord Jesus
[1:07:41] putting himself that Spirit coming in
[1:07:43] you Amen to me brother brandom talked
[1:07:46] about a rain pelting experience to me it
[1:07:48] was like the the sun itself had come
[1:07:52] into my into my
[1:07:54] body it it was like something
[1:07:57] Indescribable right it just like the
[1:08:00] entire Sun that hangs out in the sky
[1:08:02] here came right into my body right
[1:08:04] that's just what it felt
[1:08:06] like praise the Lord kissed him and the
[1:08:09] son said as he rear said the son said
[1:08:12] unto him father I have sinned against
[1:08:15] Heaven I've missed the mark against
[1:08:17] heaven and in thy sight and am no more
[1:08:19] worthy to be called thy son amen but
[1:08:24] what the man didn't understand
[1:08:25] understand and what sometimes we don't
[1:08:28] understand is you don't have to be
[1:08:31] worthy to be the Son of God if you're a
[1:08:34] Son of God you're a Son of God this man
[1:08:37] was he was the son of this man he was
[1:08:39] the son of this rich man amen worthiness
[1:08:43] had nothing to do with it
[1:08:46] amen I could have been the worst son
[1:08:50] ever on the planet but my worthiness had
[1:08:53] nothing to do with my d D in my
[1:08:58] Birthright my father being George inett
[1:09:00] Jr had nothing to do with it worthiness
[1:09:04] had nothing to do with the position I
[1:09:06] have in Jesus Christ right God praise
[1:09:10] God now we desire to live a life that's
[1:09:13] worthy of the Gospel obviously but your
[1:09:16] sunship your Birthright your position in
[1:09:19] Christ has nothing to do with your
[1:09:21] worthiness right it's not about us
[1:09:24] anyway about him it's not about what
[1:09:27] I've done it's about what he's done it's
[1:09:29] not about who I am it's about who he is
[1:09:32] that's right praise God then what does
[1:09:34] it matter my worthiness is filthy rags
[1:09:37] anyway like brother Dennis prayed any of
[1:09:40] the best good righteous great Deeds I
[1:09:42] can ever try to offer to God is filthy
[1:09:45] rags in his side amen just nothing I
[1:09:48] could do
[1:09:49] anyway so many places so many people so
[1:09:52] many religions it's about what they do
[1:09:54] it's not about what I do it's about what
[1:09:56] he's done thank you Lord praise God it's
[1:10:00] about what Christ has already done for
[1:10:03] me amen that makes me who I am not my
[1:10:07] worthiness because my worthiness is
[1:10:10] nothing it's not my righteousness my
[1:10:12] righteousness is nothing it's all about
[1:10:15] him his righteousness his righteousness
[1:10:19] that has become you that now has turned
[1:10:21] the corner going down river and you're
[1:10:23] right there in line
[1:10:26] the grace of God is riding right along
[1:10:28] with youall amen and that grace of God
[1:10:32] is keeping you in line with the word of
[1:10:35] God staying with every bit and when we
[1:10:37] do transgress when we do maybe miss that
[1:10:40] Mark a little bit God forgive me we do
[1:10:43] like the prodical son and say I'm sorry
[1:10:46] Lord forgive me amen repent make it
[1:10:50] right if you got to go somebody else if
[1:10:52] your transgression you see he said
[1:10:54] against heaven and against you
[1:10:55] you he repented for that if it's a
[1:10:59] transgression against somebody go to
[1:11:01] that person right ask forgiveness I'm
[1:11:04] sorry I didn't mean to offend you amen a
[1:11:08] lot of times a person offends somebody
[1:11:10] don't even know they offended them but
[1:11:12] if you do go to them if they tell you go
[1:11:15] to them tell them I'm sorry just repent
[1:11:19] just be sorrowful our our horrible human
[1:11:22] pride is one of the worst hindrance we
[1:11:25] have in life because it it it prevents
[1:11:27] us so many times from telling the truth
[1:11:30] and just repenting yes and just being
[1:11:32] sorrowful and asking for forgiveness
[1:11:36] amen yes they may not forgive you
[1:11:39] Humanity a person's Humanity they may
[1:11:42] not forgive you but that's not on you
[1:11:46] that's on them now right mean you've
[1:11:48] done your part to forgive the good thing
[1:11:50] is God is just and faithful to forgive
[1:11:54] praise the Lord so when you ask
[1:11:55] forgiveness of him you repent it's made
[1:11:58] right amen you become into the
[1:12:01] righteousness of God now the father 22nd
[1:12:03] verse the father said to his servants
[1:12:06] bring forth the best robe put it on him
[1:12:08] put a ring on his hand shoes on his feet
[1:12:10] bring Heather the fatty calf and kill it
[1:12:13] let us eat and be married for my son was
[1:12:15] dead and is alive again he was lost and
[1:12:18] his found and they began to be married
[1:12:22] praise the Lord amen
[1:12:25] something just as simple as repentance
[1:12:27] he didn't try to move the mark he didn't
[1:12:30] try to move the target he didn't try to
[1:12:32] make it a different thing that that uh
[1:12:35] that that was unattainable no or or or
[1:12:38] easier if you will In the Flesh no just
[1:12:42] he fixed what what was wrong what was
[1:12:45] wrong wasn't the target so many times
[1:12:48] people try to rewrite the scripture
[1:12:49] because they think the word is wrong
[1:12:51] this isn't wrong right
[1:12:54] amen it's me that's wrong right praise
[1:12:57] the Lord let me read this key to the
[1:13:00] door 196 October 1962 Hebrews the 12th
[1:13:04] chapter says seeing we are compassed
[1:13:06] about with such a great cloud of
[1:13:08] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:13:12] every weight and the unbelief that does
[1:13:14] so easily easily beset us it says Sin
[1:13:19] Sin which is
[1:13:21] unbelief only one sin and that's
[1:13:23] unbelief right amen and sin means to
[1:13:27] miss the mark he says now he gives this
[1:13:31] analogy like you're shooting you missed
[1:13:34] the mark he said you better adjust your
[1:13:38] gun not move the Mark if I put my tri uh
[1:13:43] sight right on the bullseye and it
[1:13:45] shoots over to or three Ines if I move
[1:13:48] the target over and I put it on the
[1:13:49] bullseye again what's it going to do
[1:13:52] it's going to miss
[1:13:53] again am
[1:13:55] I I don't I don't take and then aim it
[1:13:58] down two or three inches to try to hit
[1:14:00] the center no just fix the gun just fix
[1:14:03] the problem Amen brother says you better
[1:14:06] adjust your gun fix the fix the gun amen
[1:14:11] fix this make it right repent do like
[1:14:14] the prodical son I'm sorry make it right
[1:14:17] yes amen then you can hit that Mark and
[1:14:20] you can hit that uh uh uh Mark that was
[1:14:24] put there for you see because there's
[1:14:26] something wrong you've missed the
[1:14:28] mark come back try over it means to turn
[1:14:32] around you've missed the mark make it
[1:14:35] right turn around when you want to be a
[1:14:36] Christian you go to joining Church go to
[1:14:39] join a church to be a Christian he says
[1:14:41] you've missed the mark you want to be
[1:14:43] Christian and be sprinkled in the name
[1:14:45] of Father Son and Holy Ghost you've
[1:14:47] missed the mark amen amen why because
[1:14:49] that's not the scripture right amen
[1:14:52] praise the Lord there's only one thing
[1:14:55] you can hold that it's perfect in line
[1:14:56] and that's the scripture the Bible the
[1:14:58] word for heavens and earth will pass
[1:15:00] away but God's word will never pass away
[1:15:03] yes amen holds it in perfect in perfect
[1:15:07] stead amen now Romans uh Romans chapter
[1:15:13] 6 Romans chapter
[1:15:21] 6 I'm going to close in a few minutes
[1:15:24] here but let's go Roman Romans chapter
[1:15:26] 6 what uh verse one Romans
[1:15:31] 61 what shall we say then shall we
[1:15:34] continue in
[1:15:37] sin that Grace May
[1:15:40] abound God
[1:15:42] forbid amen Grace is only there to cover
[1:15:47] because of the understanding that humans
[1:15:50] cannot live the law by the letter if a
[1:15:54] person person wants to shun Christ and
[1:15:56] the blood and Grace and try to live
[1:15:59] under the law then they're under the law
[1:16:02] amen everything about it they have to
[1:16:04] live that law they have to live it right
[1:16:06] they have to live it to a team
[1:16:09] amen but it says
[1:16:11] now shall we continue in sin that Grace
[1:16:14] May abound God forbid how shall we that
[1:16:18] are dead to sin dead to sin live any
[1:16:21] longer therein see if you're dead to sin
[1:16:26] are you under the
[1:16:28] law because of righteousness are we
[1:16:30] under the law because the the
[1:16:33] righteousness of God is now manifested
[1:16:35] without the law right amen for ye know
[1:16:39] that so many of us were baptized into
[1:16:42] Jesus Christ we're baptized into his
[1:16:44] death therefore we are buried with him
[1:16:47] by baptism into death that like as
[1:16:51] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:16:53] the glory of the father even so we also
[1:16:56] walk in newness of light praise the Lord
[1:17:01] by the blood of Jesus Christ and if we
[1:17:04] walk in newness of life in the
[1:17:06] righteousness that is God if we walk in
[1:17:09] that righteousness what desire do you
[1:17:12] have to continue to
[1:17:14] sin the question was shall we continue
[1:17:17] to sin
[1:17:19] that excuse me that Grace May
[1:17:22] abound well if you're walking in the
[1:17:24] right righteousness of Jesus Christ you
[1:17:26] don't want to miss the mark amen you
[1:17:29] don't want to sin there is no abounding
[1:17:32] of sin you don't want to sin anymore
[1:17:35] that's the whole
[1:17:36] point amen for if we have been planted
[1:17:39] together in the likeness of his death we
[1:17:41] shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:17:43] resurrection knowing this that our old
[1:17:45] man is crucified with him that the body
[1:17:48] of sin might be destroyed that
[1:17:49] henceforth we should not not serve sin
[1:17:53] amen amen
[1:17:55] for he that is dead is freed from sin
[1:17:59] now if we now now if we be dead with
[1:18:01] Christ we believe that we shall also
[1:18:03] live with him knowing that Christ being
[1:18:06] raised from the dead dieth no more death
[1:18:09] has no more dominion over him praise the
[1:18:14] Lord God which is perfect in line to
[1:18:18] understand what the law and Grace is
[1:18:20] about amen a lot of times we do it like
[1:18:25] it's a competition there's not
[1:18:26] competition between law and Grace right
[1:18:29] there is no
[1:18:30] competition amen
[1:18:33] amen knowing that Christ being raised
[1:18:36] from the dead dieth no more he's not
[1:18:40] dying
[1:18:42] again it it's like I had a brother we
[1:18:45] spent a lot of time with good friend and
[1:18:48] uh it was told that he was a different
[1:18:52] understanding of the message
[1:18:57] and we kind of pushed it to the side for
[1:19:00] a long time just had Fellowship as
[1:19:02] brothers and then he calls me up one
[1:19:05] night I guess this is probably probably
[1:19:07] the last time I ever talked to him
[1:19:08] actually and he was trying to bring that
[1:19:11] in I guess this was kind of his make or
[1:19:13] break moment is either newon was going
[1:19:15] to believe this or we were going to set
[1:19:17] part ways that's his decision not mine
[1:19:20] CU I don't believe that right if you're
[1:19:22] my brother you're my brother I don't
[1:19:23] care this that and the other I may
[1:19:25] differ with you but you're still my
[1:19:27] brother as far as I'm concerned amen
[1:19:30] someone wants depart from you that's
[1:19:32] their decision but he brought up this
[1:19:35] quote or this thing that brother random
[1:19:37] said about a woman that saw him being
[1:19:39] shot in the parking
[1:19:42] lot this brother actually believed that
[1:19:45] brother Brown was going to raise from
[1:19:46] the dead and be shot by a woman in the
[1:19:48] parking lot I said okay so uh this
[1:19:51] accident happens he passes away work
[1:19:53] finished passes away so he's going to
[1:19:55] eventually 60 years later now as of now
[1:20:00] he's going to raise back from the dead
[1:20:02] just so he can go to a uh I think it was
[1:20:04] Kmart we don't even have Kmarts anymore
[1:20:06] anyway parking lot and get shot and die
[1:20:10] again and you know no answer I it just
[1:20:15] some of the reasoning just baffles me
[1:20:17] but I I wasn't cond hope I pray I wasn't
[1:20:20] condescending I wasn't any of that just
[1:20:22] wanted to understand uh
[1:20:25] do you really believe this well the
[1:20:28] scripture says knowing Christ being
[1:20:30] raised from the dead dieth no more he
[1:20:33] died and raised from the dead was he
[1:20:34] going to die again raise again die again
[1:20:37] raise again I
[1:20:39] mean it it comes to a point to where
[1:20:42] even human common sense is compromised
[1:20:46] right it it it just doesn't ring true
[1:20:49] doesn't forgive me but it just doesn't
[1:20:52] make any sense anyway so knowing that
[1:20:54] Christ see being raised from the dead
[1:20:56] dieth no more death has because death
[1:20:58] now then has no more dominion over him
[1:21:02] praise the Lord that's amen it seems
[1:21:05] plain to me but I guess it just isn't
[1:21:07] always plain to everybody right my wife
[1:21:09] has to remind me of that all the time
[1:21:12] for in that he died he died unto sin
[1:21:15] once but in that he liveth he liveth
[1:21:17] unto God likewise reckon ye also
[1:21:19] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[1:21:23] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:21:25] Our Lord now he preached that a lot even
[1:21:27] to the Ephesian Church which is just
[1:21:31] wonderful we spoke a little bit the
[1:21:32] other day let not sin therefore reain in
[1:21:36] your mortal body that you should obey it
[1:21:38] the lust
[1:21:40] thereof you don't want to that's the
[1:21:43] whole point of it see neither yield ye
[1:21:46] your members as instruments of
[1:21:47] unrighteousness Unto sin but yield
[1:21:49] yourselves unto God as those that are
[1:21:51] alive from the dead and your members as
[1:21:54] instruments of righteousness unto God
[1:21:57] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:22:01] for ye are not for ye are sin missing
[1:22:06] the Mark has no dominion over you for ye
[1:22:09] are not under the law but under grace
[1:22:13] amen praise the
[1:22:15] Lord What then shall we sin because we
[1:22:19] are not under the law but under grace
[1:22:22] God forbid it's making it very clear to
[1:22:25] say well to me it's very clear amen the
[1:22:29] understanding of say are you are you
[1:22:31] under the law no we're not under the law
[1:22:33] because of Grace right then it says well
[1:22:36] shall we continue to sin to let grace
[1:22:38] abound how can you sin if you're no
[1:22:40] longer under the
[1:22:43] law that's like going down Oracle with
[1:22:45] no speed limit if the city has not
[1:22:47] declared or sign put a signage that
[1:22:50] there's no speed limit on Oracle you can
[1:22:52] go as fast as you want there's no law
[1:22:54] nobody give you a ticket nobody can hold
[1:22:56] you accountable
[1:22:58] guilty there because there's nothing
[1:23:00] there so you you see where Paul's trying
[1:23:04] to bring it around to help them
[1:23:07] understand and I hope that makes sense
[1:23:09] here this morning What then shall we sin
[1:23:12] because we are not under the
[1:23:14] law but under grace God forbid know ye
[1:23:17] not that to whom ye yield yourself
[1:23:20] servants to obey his servants ye are to
[1:23:23] whom you obey
[1:23:25] that's the whole point whether of sin
[1:23:26] unto death or of obedience unto
[1:23:30] righteousness if your desire is to do
[1:23:33] something then yeah you can say well I
[1:23:35] believe it but I I I just don't want to
[1:23:37] live it well you just want to live how
[1:23:38] you want to live amen it it that's your
[1:23:43] choice you can you can do however you
[1:23:45] want to but don't just say you know I I
[1:23:47] can't do something you know you can you
[1:23:50] just don't want to amen those who yield
[1:23:53] their s refer you know see y yield
[1:23:55] yourselves your members uh yield
[1:23:58] yourselves to O servants to obey uh his
[1:24:01] servants ye are to whom you
[1:24:03] obey amen if it's to obey sin and lust
[1:24:08] and well then you just you you fall
[1:24:11] right under that law right amen and if
[1:24:14] you're going to try to fall under the
[1:24:16] one you fall under all of it you can't
[1:24:18] just you can't just yield into one and
[1:24:20] say well I'm going to go under it for
[1:24:22] this one no the Bible says say you go
[1:24:25] under one you're guilty of one you're
[1:24:27] guilty of all right you can't just go
[1:24:29] and say well I'm just going to nullify
[1:24:31] this one and just go under here and it
[1:24:33] just be this no you can't do just that
[1:24:35] if you're under that one you're under
[1:24:36] all of it amen because you have you have
[1:24:41] rejected the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:24:44] the grace that he gives right and once
[1:24:46] you've rejected that you have nothing
[1:24:47] left but law you have nothing left but
[1:24:50] judgment amen that's all that's left at
[1:24:52] that point see you've come under the
[1:24:55] place to where there is uh uh there is
[1:24:58] no Grace anymore once you're rejected
[1:25:00] right under the law to miss the mark
[1:25:03] amen don't move the mark don't change
[1:25:05] the mark don't change the don't change
[1:25:07] the speed
[1:25:09] limit it is what it is God said
[1:25:13] it God said it amen and if God said it
[1:25:17] then that's the way it is amen you don't
[1:25:20] change it it is the way he said iten
[1:25:23] that's the whole problem we have with
[1:25:25] some other uh uh well
[1:25:29] religions uh they they they want to go
[1:25:32] by a pope that says well uh we know the
[1:25:36] Bible says this but the Pope says this I
[1:25:38] don't care what the Pope says right yeah
[1:25:41] couldn't care less I want to know what
[1:25:43] God Said Amen and this is what God says
[1:25:47] amen not the pope not a fallible man
[1:25:51] who's influenced by we know don't know
[1:25:54] what who or where his influence comes
[1:25:57] from I don't care what he says if it's
[1:25:59] against this he's wrong right right amen
[1:26:03] this is the mark amen that's what we
[1:26:07] always shoot for we don't move it we
[1:26:10] don't change it I don't I don't have a
[1:26:12] bottle of white out in my desk that I
[1:26:15] that I white stuff out and Mark over I
[1:26:17] don't I don't own white out for my
[1:26:20] Bible I don't have a bottle of white out
[1:26:22] at my study desk no it is what it is it
[1:26:25] says what it says and it says what it
[1:26:27] means and that's what we obey amen
[1:26:30] praise the Lord let's stand if we
[1:26:38] could amen help us Lord not to miss that
[1:26:43] Mark to stay on the straight narrow you
[1:26:46] make that mistake amen do we
[1:26:51] repent God I'm sorry yes no excuse
[1:26:55] amen no blaming it on somebody
[1:26:58] else amen I don't you don't blame don't
