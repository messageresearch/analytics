supposed to take place on friday and here it is like sunday and i was supposed to pick the books up on monday so i asked god to step into the timeline that had already passed and if he would just stop the printing of that book and so i walked in on monday morning i said have you printed the books he said no i was able to get it printed that brings me up to today i heard something last night i never thought of using this for my family like this father who wishes his son would be acknowledge him for his father my children they've gradually come back i got three of them now out of five that's

wanted i want him to step into my timeline and go back and fix that be present in that area where whatever happened in his life that i don't know that caused him to want to separate from me i had a vision of this when i was pregnant with him i never knew what it was and up to the time that it faded out i didn't know what it was so i guess i'm not supposed to know but anyway i am so i woke up this morning around 4 30 um out of a dream in which my son and i were gonna laugh we're playing with the hose and the water i was trying to get it from um soaking me because it was getting out of

saints right we just look around and see more than that though we feel the pull on our hearts right amen spirit pulling in our spirits saying his time has come amen was reading the scripture this morning and and first thessalonians 5 says it will not be left in the dark that's right amen we may not know the time or the day or the hour right but we will not be left in the dark because we're children of the light praise the lord jesus amen well i'm so honored and thankful to have brother wilson and sister marlene he'd been with us today sister marlene said i'm surprised you let me in the

ministering him him and like brother aaron hunnicutt and they're on the east coast they were brothers i didn't even call to preach i that was not they were they were i don't want to say this they were untouchable so they weren't people you called to go and minister a fledgling little minister just started out and i i've always had a tremendous amount of respect for brother wilson and brother aaron i just named those two but uh always had a tremendous about her so i'm honored to have y'all here amen with us today so thank you got the fravos coming in praise the lord amen but we're also very honored to have brother noel with us today sister shirley amen i text brother nolan because he hadn't said anything about shirley he said i'll be i'll be i'll be and i and the last text i sent him i said well is shirley coming he just said always that's the way it's supposed to be amen so i'm very thankful for that so we're very honored to have brother uh noel and sister shirley with us and appreciate brother wilson and sister marley being here today and put it on your heart to be here thankfully the lord's blessed us so amen and appreciate brother angel and his family with us today amen we'll give you some announcement at the end of church service for brother angel junior's funeral arrangements uh memorial service if you will but a couple things to mention to you but let's stand to our feet again we want to get brother knowles going down to the sierra vista this afternoon so i'm going to give him plenty of time to preach what's on his heart and maybe have a bite to eat and head down oh i guess it's up actually when you go to sierra vista to sierra vista so let's just sing this only believes brother noel johnson comes give us what's on his heart today amen praise the lord [Music] oh [Music] all things are possible [Music] i want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ my privilege to be amongst you this morning amen um while you're standing if you open your bibles to romans the fifth chapter read verses one and two and i'd like to com the topic is faith comes as a result of trust amen and that'll make some sense i think as we get we get into the service the romans the fifth chapter will read verses one and two amen so therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god so our lord jesus christ by whom we have also access by faith unto this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god amen let's just pray our most gracious and loving heavenly father it is always our privilege to gather ourselves together around your word and then lord to sit at your feet and receive what you have for us amen follow my law lord to stand before the purpose of your blood lord i realize the responsibility but lord they haven't come to hear me lord but they've come to hear from you yes yes lord take me as your servant this morning move me aside guide my thoughts lord in the words which are spoken yes the lord the people might be blessed through your word i ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen amen you can be seated the bath have prefaced a little bit of this a couple of years ago i did a study in habakkuk africa it's only three chapters in length but havoc changed my whole concept of faith what is faith how does it operate and and then just just the workings within our lives we read here in romans it talks about being justified by faith and the reference here when you in my bible anyway it references back into havoc and so it took in this and began to study habakkuk but it we have we have to begin to understand faith is not believing in believing for something but it's being able to believe in someone amen because we have the faith to believe in god i mean really truly believe in him and who he is and what he is yes then that changes our whole concept because if you actually believe him and you believe his words then whatever you request from him because of your faith in him you expect him to fulfill his word amen so it says being justified by faith brother branham says justified is as if you never sinned right right and most of the the christians that i talk with there's a struggle that we have because we're still living in temples of clay and we always make mistakes we have we struggled i mean that that's maybe you don't but i do yeah but we've been good we have to come to the concert we have to come to the understanding of how god views us right because if we can understand that god views us as if we had never sinned we are as righteous as god himself is righteous we are as pure and holy as god himself as holy because that's how god views us it doesn't matter what you think about yourself it doesn't matter how you view yourself amen it matters how god views you right because if god views you as righteous if god views you as totally justified if god views you as as pure as he is pure he said then the stroke then then the struggle with for believing in god becomes less yes amen amen um it talks about you therefore being justified by faith that says we have peace it talks about arrest it talks about being able to enter into a relationship with god where we rest in him amen where we no longer struggle within ourselves and yet we all make mistakes you're getting one guy he was praying in the morning he said lord he says i haven't said a bad word i haven't had a bad thought he says i haven't i haven't done anything to any evil to anybody else but i'm going to get out of bed in a couple of minutes i need all the help i can get yes because this is our struggle as long as we live in temples of clay but there should be a we should become we should come to a relationship with god where we rest in him amen well we rest in how he views us he views us as sinless because what does he do he's looking at the sacrifice what did god do in the garden of eden he took adam and eve they had sinned and he said the day you eat thereof the day you died amen okay and so that's what they were expecting all of a sudden they would be spoken out of existence or whatever the thing was so what did god do he went and he performed the sacrifice he took an animal he killed the animals he took the skins and he gave it to adam and eve whenever god looked at adam and eve what did he do he looked at the sacrifice amen whenever god looks at us he looks at the sacrifice right it's the sacrifices because of what god did for us at calvary that is what makes us pure in his sight amen because brother madam says he hears our voice speaking through the blood amen he doesn't view you he views himself amen amen so if we can come to this understanding it it i know for myself all of a sudden it makes it so i i do not struggle in my relationship with god i struggle with myself i struggle with my flesh i struggle with my shortcomings sure but when i go to before god i know how he views me amen and therefore i know i have an audience with him whenever i whenever i bow my head talk to him yes yes praise the lord but in havoc of two and four it talks about that which where this reference comes back to he says behold the soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith and so i studied that because i was curious with how you know the wording in some ways it didn't make a whole lot of sense but it talks about in the first part of me says he's he says the soul who's lifted up behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in other words the way that it talks about there the man who relies upon himself right he says god will not even view him in fact it talks about that he said in referencing and the studies that i've done he says the man who relies totally upon themselves is god i don't need your help god i don't i don't need to take care of me i don't need to watch over elf for me i don't need i don't need your assistance at all amen i can handle this by myself yeah well god says you think you can go for it i'll leave you alone and too many people too often that's how we approach things right yes true it really is we're living in a time now where judgments is striking this world yes yes our nation is under judgment i mean if you don't believe it look at the east coast look at the west coast look at the hurricanes look at the tornado look at our government right yeah that should do it yeah but i mean we have to come to the realization the judgment has started yes we will not be in we will not go through the tribulation period brother ramsey the bride will get out of here amen but we are seeing all the preliminary steps to this we are saying to god's judgment upon this nation why do we have the the government do we have god allowed it sure right god puts in who he wants god takes out who he doesn't want and so he has placed our government to have and they have something to fulfill brother brown says this nation must fall right they're doing an excellent job at accomplishing what god has has has said but it comes to the it's something let's see often when it talks about the person who relies upon himself too often we apply this to our relationship with god well lord you know i make mistakes and we look at our mistakes we look at our shortcomings and that hinders our faith into to believe god for the thing brother branham says if you go to god in prayer and you have doubt in your heart he says he says that hinders your your prayers your prayers approaching god yes right and but often we look at ourselves and we try to well i have to do this i remember my mother uh many many years ago obviously and she said oh yeah she did something wrong she didn't tell me what it was so after one week of just being miserable she said well now i basically i've done my penance and so now i can go back to god well you don't earn it right you do not earn a relationship with god if you don't earn salvation you there in fact there's nothing that you can do to ever earn anything from god amen amen amen um jesus christ in a parable in luke he says about two people went into the temple to pray he said one was republican one was a pharisee pharisee pharisees were the righteous of the righteous they they lived the law so to speak and and the republican on the other hand he was the tax collector he was a man who had sold himself to the roman government he collected tax money from his own people lived off of the excess that he accumulated and basically he was a traitor to his own nation and so the jewish people had no respect for them for the public simply because they viewed him as a traitor but in the parable that jesus christ goes on there he says the pharisee uh the pharisees stood up and prayed within himself oh i thank you that i'm not as other people extortioners unjust adulterers and even as this republican over here i fast twice in a week you're tired of all that i possess that i imagine the list kept going on and on and on and on and on because see in the jewish religion justification came by keeping law yeah that's right that is how they viewed it but the public and he going to go in there and he and the public and standing a far off would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven but smote upon his breath saying god be merciful to me a sinner remember jesus said i tell you i tell you this man went down to his justified rather than the other for everyone that exalts themselves should be a bit in in the schofield bible it has a footnote down there and the publicans prayer could be the lord be toward me as that as when you look us upon the atoning blood don't look on me because i have nothing to offer you amen don't look upon me because i i be because i i'm a sinner amen but he says look at me as you look upon the blood that's sitting on the mercy seat amen because that's the only hope that he had amen but see in reality that's the only hope we have sure i cannot rely upon myself yeah we've gone to india for last 15 years with missionaries we've done things you know to help build the kingdom of god and stuff but that doesn't mean anything i did you people that work um what do you do you go to work because you perform so many hours of labor or something like that then okay you're expecting be paid well i go to my going to india was god's calling so that's my obligation that's my quote unquote that was my job right so that doesn't earn me any brownie points i was just doing what i was obligated felt obligated to do right and so whenever i whenever i approach god i always go through the blood amen i always head for the cross yes i said lord is because of what you have done there at the cross you have made you have justified me because of what you had did at the cross now you have covered my sins amen forced them all away and it's in that that i rest praise the lord it's in that and i've come to the place where it says lord i have nothing to offer you brother branham even himself when you listen to his prayer third he said i'm you know i'm just i'm just a miserable sinner and stuff like that and i'm just standing here in need of you and yes it's just i don't approach you on my own merits i don't approach you because i'm a prophet no i approach you because of the shed blood i approach it to you because of what you have done for me at calgary yes and we can rest in calvary if we can learn to come to the realization that it's in christ in christ alone yes that's all of our salvation amen if you have need of healing he already paid for it at the cross if you can believe it the stripes on his back have already healed you amen but you have to believe that praise the lord if you have need of peace he already paid for our peace you know if you need salvation he's already paid for your salvation but it all goes back to the cross and all goes back to what god did for us at calvary man but we have to learn to rest in that yes amen faith is not believing an intellectual thing faith is not all of us said oh yeah you know i got this marvelous revelation or this intellectual knowledge about faith no faith is a relationship right like i said i studied in havoc faith is a relationship between between the creature and the creator yes where the creature has total reliance upon god literally for everything amen amen how many got up this morning amen amen i was a few minutes okay that's good yeah why did you get up because god woke you up he didn't have to wake you up right there's a lot of people today didn't wake up a lot of people would go with this pandemic and all this stuff yeah they went to bed last night figuring they'd be they would wake up and in the morning all they never did right a lot of people i mean i i minister to andy and i keep track of what's going on there there are days they don't have any food but god provided you food yes you've all eaten amen you all have houses to live in you all you're you know are taken care of in that regard but then who provided it right you say well i got i have a job i i work for a living i make money fine who gave you the job who gave you the job amen who gave you the job that you presently have if you if you uh if you think you did it on your own merits no you didn't it's god who did that amen amen it's god who blessed you with the dog it's god who blessed you with your home it's god who blessed you with the cards you drive and it all comes from god god is the source yes i mean i can live back in my life and yeah well there were times that my wife and i yeah we struggled right we had time to there wasn't any i didn't have a job there was times when we were short on cash one incident came to mind we we lived in switzerland for a year i i was working for the university of lausanne doing microbiology they pay you in the middle of the month assuming you're going to finish the whole month that's that's how they do it well shirley and i when we landed in switzerland didn't come with a whole lot of cash and all we were down to not enough to buy anything really and so and i didn't tell francois i didn't bother i didn't want to burden him with you know if you're well lord you'll provide somehow right and during after service a couple of brothers came up and here god bled this upon my heart to give you this amen amen another brother came by here god laid up my heart to give you this right they provide just enough money to get us to why got paid amen right wasn't that excess but it was just enough god god directed us god led us and god supplied it amen it wasn't me going to the pastor and demanding him i got a prayer request i'm broke i need some cash no no but see god himself came and laid it on other people's hearts to go and to give me what we had made up because we felt we were in his will doing what we were doing amen and here again it comes to the place do you rely upon god if it's like there's a book that um reads how the intercessor um god says i want you to go to a certain city he said well i don't have any money well if you had money what would you do well i'd get in line to go buy my ticket he said well okay so he gets in line and he still didn't have any money finally as he steps up to the window to go ahead and buy the ticket um he says i need a ticket to go here you know and all of a sudden somebody go here oh i'm sorry i'm a little late here god told me to give you this amen it was just enough for him to pay for this ticket to go where god was directing him to go amen so you have to begin to understand it's all god's doing amen it's all god's leading but so you have to have the faith to believe that what god has said god would perform yes absolutely amen brother and ministry explained brother ramsey seven says said how did divine healing is does it last all the time he says it lasts just as long as faith laughs and salvation lasts the same way just as long as faith left in other words as long as you believe you're saved when you doubt your salvation when all of us and you say no i'm a miserable wretched i can't make it and i'm you know i'm i'm i'm you know i no longer say brother says at that point then you no longer are that's right amen it's learning to rest yes it's learning to look beyond yourself it's learning to look beyond your shortcoming look beyond your fault and says why am i safe brother brad i'm in another place he said i'm not safe today because i can shout i'm not saying because i feel like i'm saved i'm saved because i met god's condition of the bible jesus says he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation with fasting he says i believe that that's right and on them conditions i am saved because god said so amen amen brother branson let me like with my feelings i don't rely upon my office i don't realize on anything else i rely upon the fact that i have accepted god's provision for me and on the basis of the word and the word only he said that is the basis of my salvation but here again so often we begin to look at ourselves we begin to think i have to earn something we begin to think that i have to do something in order in order to merit god's grace or god's mercy no you don't no right god's mercy and god's god's love and god loved you before you ever came into into existence amen he knew what you would be like as a child he knew all the mistakes you'd make of as you're a teenager right he knew all the mistakes in all your shortcomings and everything all the things that you would do wrong but he loved you anyway amen and then and then the gospel came by your path you accepted it as you accepted him as your savior and then you began a walk in your life it'd be a change in your in your life but see god also knows what you're going to do tomorrow right amen he knows every mistake that you're that you've made in the past he knows every mistake you'll make from here until the rapture that's right but he loved you and that's why he died on the cross for you amen and if you can accept this it gives you up of the ability to rest amen gives you the ability to go and say well lord i'm not perfect you're myself i'm relying upon what you have done for me at the cross and because of that he says i rest in my relationship with you i i rest because you have said that you love me for god so loved the world he gave his only son amen right yes why so he could redeem you that's right he could take it the bible is the story of of of of of of redemption redemption is restoring back into its original condition yes amen we were sons and daughters of god from the beginning yes sir when you were born you were son and daughter of god you just didn't know it yes right but in the process of time the gospel came across you you accepted it and so and so you've gone from a sinner saved by grace and when i was in the baptist church the emphasis was always on sinner you're a sinner say my grace but say in the message it tells me something different than that right it tells me i am a son of god that has been fully restored to my rightful position with my father i can go to my father and i because i am his son i can go to my father and brother branham says god would would rather hear you talk to him than he would the archangels that's right you have more power and authority with god than the archangels right because you're his son you're a part of him you were a part of him from the beginning amen and it's coming to this realization you know we look in the we we go through the church ages the church ages is talking about two different groups the true vine and the false vine but when you get into when you get into the ladies in church age it just talks about the false fire because they're lukewarm have need of nothing and all this other stuff and so god had to send a prophet to us to tell you no you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ amen that is who you are yes you are not lady osea you are not lukewarm you are not you know you're not although it tends to affect our attitudes and some of the things we do but we god views us as the pure virtuous bride of jesus christ that is what we are in his sight praise the lord and he wants that relationship yes it's like i talked to the people when i was when i was in india um and that they have their marriages are arranged which has good points bad points um it would never go in the states i know that but anyway so somebody gets married and uh so one lives in delhi and one lives in in in chennai and uh so that you know they call each other up once a week say hi how are you doing i'm doing fine good okay i'll call you next week and too often that's our relationship with god yes oh yeah we come to church sunday oh hey god i'm here oh thank you for your blessings i'll call you next week when i when i have time you know but see if that's not a relationship amen no the relationship is when they move into the same house and they live in the same and they go to the bedroom and they they feast together they talk together um yeah you know we every married couple has adjustment time adjustment periods okay i'm she bends your way you bend her away hopefully and then you know things but anyway the relationship has been it's a mutual thing but see with us in jesus christ what is it all of a sudden he comes and lives inside of us amen and when he lives inside of us he's beginning to change us from the inside out right he's trying to mold us into the character that he wants us to be yes the bible says god has predestinated us to be into the adoption of children where he has predestined us to be conformed in the image of his son amen that is our destiny right we will come into the very image of jesus christ because god is already predetermined amen well how is that going to happen he says god's going to work in you to willing to do of his good pleasure it's god taking you and molding you from the inside out brother brown says when you accept jesus christ as your savior and the holy spirit comes in he says it comes in about the size of a button or your fingernail whatever but as you feed on the word he says it pushes out all the unbelief it pushes all the sin it pushes out all the corruption and puts out all the things of the world until eventually slowly and slowly slowly over time you begin to come into that very image you begin to think like you like jesus christ you begin to act like jesus christ the attributes of jesus christ but see it's all coming from the inside right under the law of men tried to adjust men tried by themselves to save themselves well the law says i can't well therefore i can't but i sure would like to but i can't do that because if i do that then you know the priest is going to come by and read me the riot act then i got to take a lamb i got to take it to him oh you know it's a bloody mess and i really want to go through all of that yeah but it's them trying by themselves yes but see with christ he says he takes his law and write it in our hearts and in our mind where literally it becomes a part of us yes we live the law because now it's our nature to live that law it's our nature to love our brothers because because the nature of god dwells in us amen my initially you know that all mine by this shall only know you are my disciples because you love each other amen right yeah well there's some people i i didn't but i'm learning too um you don't have that problem i i know that you know right but here but it's a change of a nature it's something inside of you that all of a sudden goes and and begins to conform you to the very image of jesus christ amen amen i i have eight daughters and one of my daughters brought this thing home and uh i mean he he took a bath maybe once a month he was a redneck he go out and shoot something and bled all over him and just nasty him drug addict at all and i figured i mean i treated the guy like trash and then god spoke to me and said you have to love him i says that's not an option i said there's no me love him and and him trying to have a relationship with my daughter and no that is not an option and he so god spoke to me says will you let me love him through you amen amen and i debated that and i finally said well well lord okay i will let you do that i was shocked at how i treated that guy next few times he came eventually he got tired of me and i could anyway he never came back and my opinion of him never changed but yet i learned something there that if i can yield myself to god yes god can do something through me that i and myself cannot do amen hallelujah and so i've had i've learned that down through other other resources and relationships i've had with other people yes but it comes out you know when we look at the people that in the bible that talks about the people that have faith from hebrew 11 chapter it talks an awful lot about abraham but you see if you study the life of abraham you'll find out that god appeared to abraham and we don't know in what form told him you leave your land of your nativity and all your friends and all your relations and stuff and go to a land i'm going to direct you to god didn't tell him where he was going abraham just had to follow so his dad moved up to heron and uh so abraham moved along with him and then god had to take abraham's father so abraham would actually go where god was sending him so then he goes down there's a migration from what i understand from heron down into palestine and there as they entered palestine god says this is the land i'm giving you but it was in it was time of a drought well this isn't much to brag about so he continued on down into egypt well egypt talks about self-reliance egypt is the world he i mean it talks it talks about us relying upon ourselves amen so god created circumstances to force abraham to go back into the land and over the period of time in abraham's life god began to mold him and get in and develop a relationship between abraham and god where abraham would believe god amen yes and finally i mean god told abraham he says you're going to have a have a son by your wife sarah and at 75 i mean that would have been difficult at 100 it's even more difficult right but yet it tells us in romans romans 4 says in being not weak in faith he considered not his own body no dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness or sarah's will he's tagging out the promise of god through unbelief what was strong in faith giving glory to god having and and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform amen right he believed that the god had given him the promise god had the ability to bring it to pass yes amen but see that's what comes in our lives by his rights you are healed amen do you do you believe that god has the ability to bring that promise to pass amen yes yes sir if you believe that god has the ability to heal you if you believe that god has the ability to bring to pass that which he promised unto you then at that point you just say well lord i thank you for my healing and you walk on amen well the symptoms are still there well are you looking at the symptoms are you looking at the promise amen because see this is where this is the battle that we have in our mind well but i still have the symptoms well i still don't feel good well i still well abraham didn't look he looked at his in his body and he looked at the body of his wife in 25 for 25 years he had to wait well so maybe you have to wait a week maybe you have to wait a month right right but see god made a promise right and so it's in the promise you learn how to rest amen lord you promised it thank you i cannot heal it i cannot bring it to path but since you made the promise to me i am accepting that promise even you know we say oh the lord heals well that's good but until you make it a personal thing to a personal promise to you it really doesn't take effect right you say lord you have you you say by his stripes i am healed well if you say i am healed then i am healed yes and now i'm waiting for you to manifest it in my body it doesn't matter if it takes a week a month a year whatever it takes no you have promised and therefore i might you have obligated yourself by your word to heal me amen amen and then you rest in that amen this wouldn't be the struggle anymore you just rest in that amen thank you lord it's like brother branham gives the example he said there was a lady that came by a lady i think in her neighbor they were in prayer line and so they came by and brother branham says the lady had a stomach ailment i think the other lady had a goiter or something on her neck and so they went home and uh the lady was climbing it and her husband kept after a while he says he said how are you making a reproach you know everybody looks at you like you're crazy you still can't eat there's no there's nothing in your body that nothing has changed but she said i stood before a man who did not know who i was he told me my name he told me the address where i was living he told me the condition i had if god could through him speak to me and tell me those things i have faith in that god that god will bring it to the past amen and i don't know a week or a month or whatever the time framing was went by and all of a sudden god visited that neighborhood right and then she sat down and had a cup of coffee and burnt toast or toast anyway or something like that and she was waiting you know for her stomach to all of a sudden give it all back out and all of a sudden she said well no god's healed me amen because even our pastor was was giving you know reading of the right what are you doing with this i mean you're you're testifying you're healing and look at you you can't even eat yet thank you she said but she had faith in the god that had made the promise amen if she had begun to doubt no it wouldn't he would never would have had her healing right but yes he continued to confess it god honored that and god brought it to pass yes amen we look at another man named david david was a man he was out there minding his own business or and taking care of his dead sheep a lion came in and he had to go to he had to go out and take and kill the lion to rescue the lamb yeah a little while later a bear came in he had to go and he had to rescue that lamb god was training him yes because there was a day he was going to have to face goliath amen right and so what did he do he said when all of a sudden uh when when he stood before saul because goliath had made the challenge and david related to saul says as god delivered the lion and the bear into my hands he's going to deliver that man into my hand yes he had faith amen and so he went out believing that god was going to deliver goliath into his hand if he did if he went like the other soldiers well i don't know if i can you know if this is wrong or this will work no but he had faith to believe because he had a relationship with god praise the lord but there was a time david was out there minding his own business and and his father sent a runner out to where he was at and and he said hey your dad wants to see you so he goes walking back into the house and there's this crazy old man had a horn with some oil in it and and and and anyway i think it was samuel anyway and he looked at david he said ah you're the next king of israel yes pops the cork on the horn of oil and dumps it all over david's head so david's standing there dripping with his oil i'm going to be what you're the next king of israel oh yeah uh-huh yeah uh-huh so what did david do did he run to saul say hey i'm going to be the next king to teach me how to be a king no he went back to the sheep but then god brought circumstances to pass in his life where he would sit in saul's court and he would see how how it worked yeah he would see how the governing worked amen but then saul became mad at him and so saul tried to kill him yeah but see all the time that david was running for his life there was something in his head that says i god has told me i will be the next king so god will have to sustain me god will have to watch over me god will have to protect me right but god is going to have to make the way he said i'm not going to kill king saul no god has to bring it to the right amen amen but here again but the constant knowledge that god himself had promised that he was to be the next king it is on that promise that he relied god was going to bring it to pass yes but see it comes in all of our lives with the things which we do sure we have no guarantee for tomorrow i mean our illustrious president can sit there and drive oh yeah we're having this pandemic we're going to sit the whole country down for the next six months and everything would shut down your businesses and everything would go your bank accounts would go everything would go what do we rely on amen we have to rely on the promise god has given us yes right amen amen we go and i i look at brother brown's i studied a couple of years back i i studied his life i i've managed to read all the sermons i didn't listen to all of them but i managed to read them because i was interesting how did god deal with brother branham over time brother branham when he was born he was a prophet when he was born he was born to be the prophet to this generation and he was to be the mouthpiece of god to this generation amen i mean the angel visited him a couple times you know when you be a whirlwind in a tree you know don't eat or drink and defy your body there's a work for you when you get older but he had to get saved first he was a renegade he was he was a rough character um he refused to he refused to accept christ until god got him down to his deathbed and finally got brother brown healed he said okay if you if you will let me live he says that i'll serve you after that then he then god began to deal with him more in the visions and stuff like that and he had faith in the visions because every vision he had always came to pass amen later on in his life he began to go through the scriptures and he look at how god was dealing with him through visions and stuff he says well this is how god deals with with with prophets then he acknowledged he was the pr he was a prophet [Music] and then when the discernments began to come then all of a sudden he really he went to the script the scripture was brother absolute amen hallelujah it wasn't something he conjured up in his mind this revelation or that no everything had to go back to the word everything had to be found in the pages of this book yes that's right so when all of a sudden the discernment came he said oh well this is how god dealt with with abraham and sarah then he would turn his back to the people so you see see that god is here and he's doing the same thing through me that he did through that angel that visited abraham and sarah and so he he began to acknowledge he began to to to relate to that he always believed that billy graham was the messenger to this age he did that until 63. because in 62 we had nixon you know kennedy got elected president and then he looked at his visions book and said well he says you know the women's vote he said put this man in he said so where where are we at in time that's when he preached the church ages and after he preached the church ages then the angel spoke to him now you go read malachi 4. and then became the awareness no i'm the messenger to this age and that changed but then it wasn't until the opening of the seals he said because he texted about you know when the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished he said he said the angel didn't begin to sound until the opening of the seals and then he says there has been a message committed to me i have to be obedient to amen amen so there was a progression in all of his life he had he had to go from just being a baptist preacher and he had to go through acknowledging he was a prophet he had to acknowledge that god was working in him the same way he appeared in the neighborhood to abraham and sarah but see when you were born you were sons and daughters of god we are to be the final voice of the final age amen brother brown talks about that but it takes more than just a mental conception it takes a relationship amen brother brown over his time he developed a relationship with god it was that relationship with god that sustained him through all the trials and troubles that he went through in his ministry and you know their brother branham relates one story he said he was he was flying i think he was flying home and all of a sudden either there was a weather pattern something or the engine car that the plane developed the problem anyway it had to land in nashville and they put him in a hotel and the next day they will come get you and you know we'll get you home so he gets down he was going to go out there and mail a letter i think it was or something like that and god just told him keep walking right he says but they're gonna he says no walk where am i going no walk so he walked he did not know where he was going he had no clue what what god was intending for him to do but he knew to be obedient because of the relationship he had with amen so he's walking down into the poor section of town and there's this lady sitting there colored woman and uh she said morning parson he said well how do you know i was a person well god showed me you were coming amen i've been here you know since what however early in the morning it was oh by the way where's i think is this hat or very briefcase one of the other my memory doesn't serve me that well all the time but see she had a relationship with god amen she did not know he was a prophet she did not know the mystery of the seven seals he didn't know the mystery of the church age right right she did not know any she didn't know anything about him his ministry or anything that he was doing she was interested in the salvation of her son amen but she had a relationship such that she could pray and god would stop that plane bring it unto them brother branham could go minister to right but see when i look at people in in the message i keep wondering what is our relationship like come on do we have the same relationship that sister had right do we have the same relationship where we could pray and all of a sudden god would ground the plane so some minister can come by and minister to our needs amen do we have the same relationship that she had because it's going to take that in our lives in order to be able to sustain what's coming yes sir amen it's interesting when i look going back to looking at habakkuk habitat had to come to a relationship with god where he trusted god literally for everything amen in in havoc 3 and 16 it says when i heard my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottnest entered into my bones and i trembled in myself that i might rest in the day of trouble when he when he cometh up unto the people he will invade them with his troops this man was scared because he did not know that when when the assyrians came if he would survive when they when the syrians would go in there they would they they killed because they like to kill yeah they like to torture people and havoc in my opinion he was scared for his own life but yet he goes on and because his relationship with god he goes although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall the fruit be in the vines the labor of the olives will fade on the fields shall you'll know me right the flocks will be cut off from the foal and there shall be no no hurt in the stalls there will be total utter devastation he says yet i will rejoice in the lord i will joy and the god of my salvation amen when the pandemic hit i this was the first sermon or part of them like this i preached to those in india i says you have to come to a place in your relationship with god that havoca came in his relationship with his god that if you have nothing it will not change your relationship with you amen right you will still worship him yes and the wording here in in heaven it's not just like you know i will rejoice in the door no i will shout i will dance i will rejoice i will i will i will uh i will do all the all the emotions and all the other things that you can possibly imagine yes with his whole body he would rejoice and he will praise his brother amen even though he had nothing amen that's right and that was the thing i try to tell him in india even though you have nothing even though you come down to the place there's no food for your plate even though they're you know you have total devastation i said you have to develop the relationship with god that habakkuk has yes because that is the only thing that will sustain you amen and i look at what's going on in our country the only thing that's going to sustain us and what's coming we have to have this kind of a relationship amen we have to come to the place where we have so much faith in god that it doesn't matter if there's anything on the table or or whatever there happens to be and he will still believe and trust god yes going back and and the result of the intercessor the guy had an orphanage and uh people would bring food by and stuff like that you know to feed the orphan and that that morning there was nothing i mean the cupboard was bare and literally there was nothing to put before the kids and god spoken and says well if you had the food what would you do well we'd bless it well so they began to pray and thank god for the food that they're about to partake of and there was nothing on the table and thank god for the for the food that's on the table and all the other types of stuff and he said amen about that time there was a knock on the door a bread truck had just broke down in front of his of his of the orphanage yeah and the guy had to unload all the bread because he couldn't deliver it because they only had fresh bed back then yeah and so all of a sudden all the bread that was in that truck all of a sudden got given to the orphanage and that was the food for the people right but god already knew what was going to happen and god says well he says why don't you you know there's nothing on the table fine why don't you bless the food why don't you pray for it why don't you give thanks for it amen so they did and they said amen and all of a sudden god opened you know provided but it has to come in our life what is god going to do for us we live in troubled times we live in times where there's absolutely no guarantee for tomorrow amen we don't know about our jobs we don't know about our income we don't know about our government we don't have no idea what's coming yes but yet if we we have to have this relationship we have to come to the place where we have such a faith in god that regardless of what comes it we will still rejoice in our god we will steal joy and the god of ours amen praise the lord brother branham says says in the fundamental fundamental foundations of faith he says faith with you actually it's something that's unconscious it's something you don't really know that you have he talks about in another swear by himself he talks about jesus christ he says but faith is unconscious you've got faith and don't even know it that's why she's jesus christ no matter if he was in the storm and the gale's knocking the boat from one side to the other or it was standing the face of a mass of demons or if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be wife he was simply unconscious of fear of anything that was around him amen because he knew god was in control yes amen praise the lord do we understand god is in control yes amen because if we can put if we if we can transition ourselves to the place where we actually believe that god is in control then we don't know what tomorrow will bring i know i had my i had my schedule all laid out before we landed in tucson right after we landed all of a sudden my i took that that itinerary and scrapped it up threw it away and made another one um the next day i had to throw that one away and make another one right we got to we went up to uh prescott and had to take my itinerary and scrap that up and throw it away and so it for since we landed about which is what a week ago now a little over that i've had to rearrange my schedule about every other day so i said well lord you have obviously you have something else planned right so you lead me today where you want me to go today yes you take care of me you know i'm at your disposal you just you just let me know what you want me to do amen but i i had i've had if if if i was stuck to my schedule i would have been frustrated i would have been nervous well what are we going to do now what are we going to do today oh man you know what this is then the other no it's a well lord okay um we woke up today that's always a good sign well lord what do you want me to do today and so okay and he guided he directed he provides the way and but i have learned i have had to learn to rest in this right i have learned to sit there and take my life and commit it to god amen this is god whatever you're wanting to do you just you just let me know praise the lord right right and the bomb in gilead brother battle talks about the one thing that we have to move up to now with supreme faith and you talk about oh man supreme fake i mean he said some places people don't even have faith to believe for toothache but then he goes on and he begins to clarify what does he mean by supreme faith he said you you just walked well i'm going home i'm going to go out and start the car he said that's all an act of faith tomorrow i meet you there at a certain place he says that's all an act of faith you've just done it so much it's just a regular routine right amen so i mean you go out you take a car you're assuming it's going to start there's no question put the key in the ignition or now you push the button or however they work it but it's happening all the time and so yeah it's going to start it always starts you know right you walk into a dark room the first thing you reach for is the light switch you flip the switch you expect light yeah right because there's no question amen but see that's supreme faith but see that has to come to our relationship with god what is supreme faith well god has always done it god's healed me in the past i expect him to heal me and amen so you just walk on believing yes if you believe it god will bring it to pass right i mean it talks of a relationship abraham had to come to the belief in the fact that god had made a promise and he believed in the god that had made the promise that god had the ability to bring it to pass amen but see we have to come down to the same relationship we have to come down to having the same faith that abraham had to believe that whatever god had promised us god will perform it because he promised it praise the lord it's not it's not we promised it ourselves no god himself promises yes and he said that's the way the things of god are after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just a regular routine and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plan of god amen in other words you will develop such a relationship between you and your god that you have absolute faith and trust in him and and all of a sudden it will come time for the rapture and because you have walked with him and trusted him yes oh yeah now it's the time for the changing of my body for it and all of a sudden i'm looking for that i'm looking for amen i'm losing about 60 pounds in about 60 years all at once you know amen but i mean but i believe god will do it yes i have no question i cannot perform it i cannot change my body believe me if i could i would yeah but i cannot do it but i believe in the god that has made the promise yeah he changed mine amen because he told me he was right amen why did god send the prophet to give us the faith to believe in the god that and the god that had made the promises right why did god have why did god had to send moses in to end egypt because god to them was a god of history the god of abraham isaac and jacob fine that was 400 years ago well what is this god what is the god of my fathers what does he do what can you what can he do we're in slavery so god sent moses they performed miracles they came to mount horeb and what did they do all of a sudden lightnings and thunderings and earthquake they became aware that this god that had called them and chosen them and delivered them from egypt this god had power and almighty to be able to do anything yes but they never were able to grasp hold of the fact that that god would do it for them right hmm but see too many christians it's the same oh yeah we saw it in brother branham oh yeah we saw god do this we saw god do that but will he do it through me will he do it through you um i don't think my wife would mind this she worked in labor and delivery for a while and uh i don't know how many births she was involved in but but all of a sudden a woman would come in and she would be having difficulties maybe not the one she was with but there was another one because you're hearing the nurses talk and so she heard about the problem this lady was having and all of a sudden things changed my wife began to pray and there is to combine you've been praying haven't you yeah yeah right and everything changed amen she was acting as an intercessor [Music] okay can you amen do you have the faith to believe that if you pray to god god will hear you yes yes amen if you believe god will hear your prayer then don't you expect to have a response don't you expect the answer amen i mean it's that simple we make we make christianity so difficult but it's not right right right it's simple the whole gospel is simple yes believe in the lord jesus christ and your house will be saved you have to believe that yes okay by his rights i'm healed okay amen you say i am therefore i am now i just wait for the manifestation it's that simple yes the problem we have is what we dwell in right and satan keeps telling you oh no you're not oh no you're not symptoms are still there see you're not healed yeah i am because god said i was that's right okay amen true who's rich in mercy brother brown goes on and says i'm not only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to strain it out that we might get away from this fear and the scare you don't know who you are in other words you're afraid to acknowledge the fact that you are a son and a daughter of god amen you're afraid to step into the office or the position that god has called you to be in yes you always were sons and daughters amen but it's time for us to not just look at our flesh and look at our shortcomings and look at our fault but it's time to believe no god said i am a son of god amen i was a son of god when i was born i have come into i've accepted christ as my savior god has sent a prophet to me and that prophet to me told me am the virtue of sin was bride of jesus christ and because i am that he says now i'm i want i'm i i need to step into the position god has called me to be amen brother brown had to do that down through his ministry he had to step into the office of a prophet he had to step into the discernment he had to step in to be acknowledging he was the messenger he had to step into being the seventh amen he had to step into those offices and and once he stepped into him then god could use him in that capacity yes but until you are willing to acknowledge you are sons and daughters of god and and quit looking looking past yourself and your shortcomings and your faults and your failures and begin to say no god said this is what i am because he said this is what i am now i'm supposed to step into that because i am to manifest jesus christ that's exciting i have to be the final voice of the final age i read the final manifestation of god to this world before god takes me home amen true and true amen and that's what we have to step into thank you lord to acknowledge that and accept it right you are not going to be see you are not going to be but now you are the sons of god so you always were sons of god when god had you in his thinking in the beginning and brother in the seven church ages he knows that the people can get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army amen so we are but you have to believe it right you have to believe in the god that has called you amen yes it's not you overcoming it's god overcoming through you amen it's not you performing miracles it's god performing miracles through you that's right amen jesus christ never performed a miracle he says it's not it's not me it's just the father that dwells in me he does them right brother branham says i always just happened to be in the water when all of a sudden the angel came down in 30 right yeah i was just standing there when all of a sudden god used my voice to speak to somebody yes i was just standing there when this happened i was just happy to be standing there when this happened he never took it to himself right he never said i did this and i did this no he said i just happened to be there and god did this and god did this and god did that amen but see we but we have to begin we have to come to the place where god can lead us and guide us to the place that's no longer us and it's no longer us struggling and striving to produce something but it's us dying out to ourselves something god could live his life through god yes amen that is christianity right he does not expect you to live a christian life he expects you to die to yourself so he can live his life through you amen right amen yes lord and that's the secret of being a christian hallelujah it's not you striving to obtain it's you're dying out so he can live his life through you amen right one last thought in here my wife and i when we went to india in 2020 i think it was yeah before this government hit i was just sitting in a week or i don't know maybe a month before that i was just opening my bible you know be quiet in church and settle your subtle mind down getting ready for the word amen i turn isaiah 31 i said where are them to go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel and neither seek the lord i read that in another in verse three it says now the egyptians are men and not god the horses are flesh and not spirit and i i got to thinking about that yeah that that why do i always go back to myself why do i always rely upon myself why do i always rely upon my abilities and then we were flying into into india we left london and we're flying into hyderabad which i think is about 10 or 12 hour flight and the food's not what it used to be in the airlines but food is food and so i was eating mine and i noticed shirley wasn't eating any of hers and i figured well what's wrong so i asked her she's i got this severe headache oh okay so i figured well okay four or five hours we'll land in hyder bed we got pills and they're you know checked in in the belly of the beast so to speak and uh yeah then you'll go to bed and sleep and you know a couple days you'll feel fine and then god reminded me of this verse why do you always go to egypt right why do you always turn to yourself right why do you always turn to your abilities why do you always think you can handle it right yeah oh so i repented and says lord we're going here because we feel led to go we here we believe we are we were going because of of your leadership and your guidance believing and trying to fulfill your will but satan has harassed my wife and she has such a severe headache really she can't she can't eat and so i says lord i want i ask you to heal her and a couple hours later headache was gone amen god was trying me and there's a couple things happening in india where god here again took me to this i mean we we hit a dip in the road and they were going too fast and uh her head hit this even with the seat belt on her head hit the ceiling of the car and gave her a concussion i figured lord i need you now right because i mean we were out in the boonies yeah so i said lord please undertake the lord did amen and since that time and like even getting home it says well lord i'm not going to rely upon me to do what i'm doing i i need your guidance amen we have a guy like orders you know him he worked for duke power and uh he would he was in charge of his son he worked for 40 years i think some ridiculous number of years anyway he was in charge of a substation they called him and says we have a problem with the power or something like that and he went into the well i don't know if they have dials or switches or what they've got in there but he said lord you have to show me where the problem is because nothing here makes everything looks fine right and god directed him to an area ah that's where the problem is then he called up the whoever does switching power grids yeah you got to turn off this this power grid that'll affect 5 000 people he says i don't care shut it off no i can't fix it until you do so she's the lady or whatever through the sweat he went in there fixed the thing in 10 minutes later power was restored but here again he didn't be he had been working for there for 30 years probably by that point he did not rely upon his knowledge as an electrician he relied upon god to show him what was wrong amen amen but see too often in myself yeah i trust in myself i mean i you know i'm old enough to learn a few things in my life but i've come to the place to realize no it's not about me and what i can do you know it's about god and what he can do yes yes because we're coming to i believe in my opinion i believe we're coming to a time where we have to rely on god amen relying on yourself relying upon your job relying upon the government relying upon other sources won't work amen we have to come to the place where we have a relationship with god yes where we literally trust him for everything that's just how we're right there heavenly father we're our heads and we thank the lord you've given us this time together even though the words have been kind of choppy lord and maybe not make fully sense but lord you can put it together and help us to understand we have to come to a relationship with you that's second to none where lord you literally become supreme in our lives and we have total reliance upon you literally for everything that we do it's coming to that time i believe lord and soon the lord we're going to have to come to that relationship like that yes the sister had there in in in knoxville you know i think in nashville so lord help us today help us to grasp hold of what is what what faith is and help us realize faith is a relationship in you with you where literally we trust you for all things yes grant this lord for i ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen amen say amen to that amen praise the lord jesus so thankful the lord knows exactly what to put on a person's heart time that we need it the most yes amen i just read that scripture it's been on the rapture for about three or four months i don't remember how long and i read that scripture last week about saint luke 17 26 through 30 where the the days of lot they builded and sold and planted and all that and i always baffled me because i thought well we we build we buy we sell we trade we live our lives but it doesn't mean that and dig into it a little deeper like brother noah was talking about with with habakkuk it means that they became self-reliant they became reliant on themselves they did everything themselves were like the rich young ruler right it was all him it was all them it was all what they could do and that's exactly the world that we're living in today it's exactly the country we're living in today they don't want god don't need god put god outside and the only thing they care about is they can do it and they're gonna do it they're gonna do it the way they want when they want how they want they don't care what you think about it anymore right as corrupt as it is they're in your face with it and they just don't care right but that's the world that we live in today amen it's all self-reliant but friend i want to tell you i am not in any way self-reliant my whole faith trust confidence is in the lord jesus christ that's all i have i've said this many times i've put all of my eggs in the proverbial basket and that basket is jesus christ uh if this turns out to be a failure which it's not of course uh i'm done because that's all i've got that's all i know amen amen you know you you people dabbled in the stock market and they they have a diversified portfolio where they have a little this and they have a little of that and they have some over here in this industry in that industry and this company and that company because if this one goes down they still got all this you know friend if that ends up being nothing i'm done because that's all i he's all i got amen the good part is he's all i want amen the better part is he's all i need right praise the lord jesus amen let's sing that if we could amen he's all i need [Music] jesus is all i need yes he's all i [Music] is all your heart now oh yes [Music] jesus [Music] is amen praise the lord jesus he's so wonderful to us amen i always appreciate brother noel when he comes to speak for us i appreciate brother nolan and sister shirley's commitment to india and the and the missionary work they do over there and just pray the lord bless them as they continue that that's one big reason i enjoy having brother noel but it seems like every time brother knowles come and ministered for us ever since we've had the church open on cortero here he's always had the lord has always worked through him in the channels of things that we've already been talking about amen and it just it just always is such a confirmation to me that the holy spirit is moving in his bride and his people and he's doing it exactly the way he wants to do it and i i appreciate that so much brother noel of having you know it's something that preaching on a rapture like i said [Music] you won't have rapturing faith unless you exercise what he preached today amen unless we live and practice what brother noel preached today from the scripture we will not go in a rapture amen there will be a rapture but if you're not practicing that you won't be in it but by the grace of god amen i believe that every one of us got to give us that capacity amen if again he could like he said if we just get ourselves out of the way amen praise the lord and i i could be wrong but i think it was memphis that could be i could sister shirley's nodding so we're getting it wrong and i really like your secret on the giving part back and forth in the relationship i really like the secret on that one there i know sister shirley's got a great heart in my mind give a little more maybe than i have but i'm thankful that god's caused us to have that relationship with him because that's what it's all about amen it's not a relationship with a denomination it's not a relationship with brother branham it's a relationship with jesus christ amen it's not you brother branham and him it's you and him right amen nor was it brother branham you and him it was brother random and him it's you and him it's not you and him then something's wrong right amen you got to get all the other stuff out amen it's all him praise the lord a couple things before we go today uh i i i mean i feel a strong anointing and the lord's been so good to us and i appreciate that but brother a couple things i want to mention though before you go and let brother noel and sister shirley get a bite to go preach brother roger collins down in sierra vista tonight brother noel had a couple books that they had made up for indian trips and he gave me two copies i got one on my desk the other one's back there don't anybody take it if you'd like to take it or sign it out or something i want it to belong to the church so everybody can have an opportunity to look at it and see what your missionary offerings and all that we have given to brother noel over the years have gone to uh the furtherance of the gospel there and the work that they do in india it's in that book so you can read it look at it and let it be a blessing to you uh and and what you do there the lord willing uh we're gonna have brother noel next sunday okay you're talking about rolling up your things all right i hope you want to make sure that one as it is right now yeah okay praise the lord as well so as far as we know now brother noah will be with us again next sunday uh lord willing so look forward to that the lord will allow that to happen and uh god to bless that and he's talking about the miracles you know it seems like when you don't have a whole lot we got one car that's a nice good car and the engine light stays off but we always have well we seem to have one that is on the other side of the fence there and uh then i always have to lay hands on that vehicle to get it through emissions i had to do the same thing yesterday uh the maxima we have is that the engine light's been on for two years and i knew what it was so it wasn't like well brother knew you're going up on the side of the road now i knew what the issue was so it wasn't something that was going to keep me on the side of the road but it was something that would keep you from going through emissions so i put some cataclean through it uh didn't turn the thing off but i reset the codes and i just laid hands on it and i said jesus this is going to pass the mission and i drove down there drove through you passed sir have a good day and i drove off so good for two more years brother wilson in that car anyway so thankful just a great testimony uh you know my struggle sometimes with the with emissions remember last time was taken michael was selling his car that audi and it had the engine light on and knew what it was again it wasn't going to fix itself but i got the engine light off and i drove it and got it down there and the guy looked at the car because you have to you had to turn it off and you had to turn it on and prove so the light was still off when i got there and he looked at it and he said okay the engine light is off so he said now turn it off and make sure the engine light's working so i turn it off and you turn it back you turn it without cranking it so you can see the engine light comes on well then i cranked it well after i cranked it the engine light never went back off it just stayed on but the guy never looked again never looked at the light never paid attention to it again it stayed on the whole time he did emissions you pass have a good day amen you know praise the lord just little testimonies like that you're thankful that god blesses you amen he's mindful all the deep in the little things um remember tomorrow night if you can and if you'd like to the tucson tabernacle having sister ruth's memorial service tomorrow night at tucson tabernacle at seven o'clock so if you'd like to go and be a part of that that will be there the

cup which we've always had uh the one big cut for communion with all the stuff going on the covet and everything if it was if it made you feel uncomfortable or something i did buy the little cups we'll have it there for that sunday so um and also remember before you go if you can um you can give an offering as unto the lord for brother noel uh for the offer for the service today and uh and next sunday as well but if you have an offer and you'd like to give it to unto the lord just put in the box over there make sure every penny all the cash that goes in the box goes to brother noel uh
