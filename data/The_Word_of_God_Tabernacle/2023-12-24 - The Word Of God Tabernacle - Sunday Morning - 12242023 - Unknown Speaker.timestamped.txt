[32:26] for today we'll commit it all into your
[32:28] hands and ask your blessings upon the
[32:30] remaining part of it in the name of the
[32:32] Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[32:35] amen amen Matthew chapter 1 I want to
[32:38] begin with Verse
[32:39] 18 Matthew
[32:42] 1:18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was
[32:45] on this wise when as his mother Mary was
[32:49] espoused to Joseph before they came
[32:52] together she was found with child of the
[32:54] Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being
[32:57] a just man and not willing to make her a
[32:59] public example was minded to put her
[33:01] away privately but while he thought on
[33:04] these things behold the angel of the
[33:06] Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying
[33:09] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[33:13] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[33:15] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[33:18] Ghost and she shall bring forth the son
[33:22] and thou shalt call his name Jesus for
[33:25] he shall save his people from their sins
[33:28] Jesus Jehovah Savior and now all all
[33:32] this was done that it might be fulfilled
[33:34] which is spoken of the Lord by the
[33:36] prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be
[33:38] with child and shall bring forth a son
[33:41] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[33:44] which being interpreted is god with us
[33:47] then Joseph being raised from sleep did
[33:50] as the angel of the Lord had bidden him
[33:52] and took unto him his wife and knew her
[33:55] not till she had brought forth her
[33:57] firstborn son and he called his name
[34:00] Jesus amen you could be seated if you'd
[34:04] like amen they called his name
[34:08] Jesus what a precious name Saints no
[34:12] name given under heaven where men could
[34:14] be saved with the name of Jesus now I
[34:16] want to take just a small subject today
[34:19] uh the thought that came to me the other
[34:21] day was uh well I had a different I had
[34:24] a different title till yesterday but uh
[34:27] just want to title this Jesus birth in
[34:29] me amen Jesus birth in me and we talk
[34:33] about the birth of Jesus Christ in the
[34:35] scripture here the birth of Jesus Christ
[34:37] being on this wise and we know the birth
[34:40] of Jesus Christ was because that God put
[34:43] a seed in Mary that was conceived by the
[34:45] Holy Ghost amen and understanding this
[34:49] is what brings this into a greater
[34:51] perspective for us because you know that
[34:53] the comforter that we know of as being
[34:55] the comforter which is what comes and
[34:58] lives in us the Holy Ghost had not been
[35:01] instituted to the people uh to be filled
[35:05] with the Holy Ghost at this time it did
[35:08] not come until after Jesus birth and
[35:10] burial and resurrection and his coming
[35:13] and sending that comforter he said the
[35:16] Holy Spirit down upon us to not only be
[35:19] with us but live in US amen Jesus birth
[35:24] in us and but but here we know that as
[35:28] God existed as God existed the Holy
[35:32] Spirit existed because God is one they
[35:35] want to chop him up into three pieces
[35:37] into three Gods but I want you to
[35:40] understand this is still just the one
[35:42] living God it's not three it's one God
[35:46] and to understand that if you take in
[35:49] perspective that the Holy Ghost only
[35:52] came to be after Jesus death then that
[35:56] that would uh that would take the
[35:59] scripture out of context the Holy Ghost
[36:02] was in existence because God was in
[36:05] existence it's just a manifestation of
[36:08] God that's all the Holy Ghost is Jesus
[36:11] Christ was simply a manifestation of God
[36:14] the Holy Ghost is just a manifestation
[36:16] of God all the attributes of who God is
[36:19] do we just major these three of course
[36:21] the scripture but all of who God is was
[36:24] a part of God before the foundation of
[36:26] the world and is still God today none of
[36:29] it's changed none of it's gone away it's
[36:31] all God in the beginning was God the
[36:34] logos Amen in the beginning was him and
[36:38] it is God and the Holy Ghost then came
[36:41] now if I I if we say and We Know by
[36:45] scripture that God is the father of
[36:48] Jesus Christ that's what that's what the
[36:51] scripture says amen the people didn't
[36:53] try to chop them up into three pieces
[36:56] but if you chop him into three pieces
[36:58] then who becomes Jesus father at that
[37:02] point everybody wants to say God is his
[37:05] father but what about the Holy Ghost
[37:08] because the Bible here says that that je
[37:11] that M Mary was uh conceived in her womb
[37:15] a seed by the Holy Ghost so now is he by
[37:19] the holy ghost or is he by God because
[37:22] if they're two different gods then you
[37:24] make Jesus illegitimate God
[37:27] he can't only be one because they're one
[37:29] and the same amen just different
[37:32] applications just different ways of
[37:35] expressing himself just like I don't
[37:37] express myself as husband to my wife the
[37:40] same way I express myself to my son as
[37:44] father I don't express myself to him the
[37:46] same way I express myself to her I don't
[37:49] express myself to you the same way I do
[37:52] it to my son or to my daughter or to my
[37:55] to my wife I don't I don't
[37:57] uh Our Lives aren't expressed to one
[37:59] another in the same venue to each person
[38:02] it depends on the the application the
[38:05] time that we are that we are living the
[38:07] place that we need to accomplish what do
[38:10] we need to do what does God need to do
[38:12] uh in a certain instance so he sends the
[38:15] Holy Spirit uh with the seed to plant in
[38:18] Mary so that Mary would conceive of the
[38:21] seed so that Jesus Christ would be would
[38:24] be formed in her womb and come forth
[38:26] this human flesh it's just a different
[38:29] application same God Amen same God God's
[38:32] not a different God God hasn't changed
[38:34] he's the same God he's the same God now
[38:37] as he has always been amen now let's go
[38:39] over to St John chapter
[38:42] 18 St John chapter 18 I just want to
[38:45] read one verse of scripture
[38:50] here St John chapter
[38:53] 18 and just read this one verse of
[38:55] scripture verse 37 now Jesus comes
[38:58] before Pilate of course in this
[39:01] situation with
[39:03] pilate and pilate of course is speaking
[39:06] to him uh talking back and forth and and
[39:10] uh pilate sees it there there's not what
[39:14] uh uh these people are crying about
[39:17] about Jesus they're making all sorts of
[39:20] false accusations against Jesus but they
[39:23] don't want to acknowledge it amen but
[39:26] but P but uh but pilate knows pilate
[39:30] just standing here just for the few
[39:32] minutes he was standing there recognized
[39:35] their accusations against him were false
[39:38] they recognized and knew that those
[39:41] accusations weren't true just by
[39:44] standing there talking to the man just
[39:47] by standing there and being in his
[39:48] presence they recognized and knew that
[39:52] uh that that their accusations were
[39:54] false so Jesus so pilate comes and uh
[39:58] gives him one of these accusations he
[40:00] said pilate therefore said unto him art
[40:05] thou a king
[40:06] then Jesus answered thou sayest that I
[40:11] am a king amen but that's what all the
[40:14] others were claiming that he was say
[40:18] Amen you go look and say Jesus never
[40:21] said that that was other people's
[40:24] acclamation that they said about him he
[40:26] was claiming to be something he wasn't
[40:29] amen thou art a king thou sayest that I
[40:33] am a king but look now he says to this
[40:38] end look it wasn't to be king but there
[40:42] was a purpose there that God had amen
[40:46] there was a purpose recognized here that
[40:49] God had for sending Jesus Christ on this
[40:52] Earth Jesus recognizing that purpose
[40:55] Jesus acknowledging that purpose and
[40:58] Jesus giving that purpose to pilate to
[41:01] understand for this cause or to this end
[41:05] was I born and for this cause came I
[41:08] into the world that I should bear
[41:11] witness unto the truth amen praise the
[41:14] Lord that's the first thing that Jesus
[41:17] Christ was here to Bear witness to the
[41:21] truth to Bear witness of the
[41:23] truth and doesn't say and but there's a
[41:27] period there everyone that is of the
[41:30] truth heareth my voice so now what does
[41:33] that mean that means that those who are
[41:36] not of the truth cannot hear his voice
[41:39] but those who are of the truth because
[41:42] Jesus came to bear witness of the truth
[41:44] those that are of the truth bear witness
[41:47] of who he is amen because those are the
[41:51] ones that recognize now this is not Jew
[41:54] this is not Gentile this is not uh
[41:57] Heathen this is not this is whoever
[42:01] believes whoever believes the truth
[42:04] whoever is of the truth hears The Voice
[42:08] of Truth praise the Lord that voice
[42:11] speaks and as that voice speaks that
[42:14] Spirit begins to multiply itself in your
[42:17] life amen or grow if you will amen the
[42:20] scripture says multiply when it says
[42:22] multiply it just means it's growing it
[42:25] doesn't mean there's two or three or six
[42:26] or eight or 10 12 of them it just means
[42:29] it's growing it's multiplying it's
[42:31] growing and as it grows in each one of
[42:33] us there had to been a a a a birth to
[42:38] come forth to bring us to the place that
[42:42] we are new creatures that brings us to
[42:45] the place to receive of the truth and of
[42:48] the truth the new birth of the truth is
[42:50] to bring a new birth into our lives it's
[42:53] wonderful that Jesus was born naturally
[42:57] uh we thank God we celebrate this the
[42:59] time of year that we celebrate that even
[43:00] though we we know he wasn't born uh
[43:03] December 25th we celebrate that birth
[43:06] praise the Lord uh and as long as we
[43:08] celebrate it we celebrate Jesus Christ
[43:11] not all the things that go with
[43:12] Christmas and everything else and what
[43:14] it has become but we celebrate Jesus
[43:18] amen that's the whole point of it to
[43:20] celebrate Jesus amen and when we
[43:23] celebrate Jesus we are thankful that God
[43:26] send him in a natural human flesh and a
[43:31] natural birth in human flesh we thank
[43:35] God he did that
[43:36] but the reason he did that was it was it
[43:41] so he could go away and come back and be
[43:44] birthed in
[43:46] you the more important thing the the
[43:49] greater aspect here is it Jesus's
[43:53] natural birth we thank God for that
[43:56] it's the spiritual birth that he's
[43:58] birthed forth in each one of our Lives
[44:01] that's the most important thing amen the
[44:04] most important thing to us every single
[44:07] aspect of what God did and every single
[44:09] way that Jesus lived it was for you it
[44:13] was for me it was for us it was for his
[44:16] people it was to Bear witness of the
[44:19] truth amen and all those that are of the
[44:21] truth will hear it praise God we hear
[44:25] that
[44:26] because it speaks to us we thank God for
[44:29] the natural birth friend but what about
[44:31] the spiritual birth in each one of us
[44:34] that life that's birthed forth in in Us
[44:37] Praise the Lord where would we be
[44:38] without
[44:40] that people celebrate his natural birth
[44:43] that have no clue about what a spiritual
[44:45] birth is that have never experienced it
[44:49] that don't know anything about it
[44:51] there's a lot of people that are
[44:52] celebrating Christmas Eve tomorrow
[44:54] Christmas because because uh because
[44:57] it's it's an event that people celebrate
[45:00] it's it's something of a holiday and and
[45:02] and a giving and a time of being
[45:04] together with family friends and uh of
[45:07] giving and and it become so
[45:09] commercialized though the and the the
[45:12] reciprocity and uh I I saw a thing the
[45:15] other day uh a guy went through uh this
[45:18] he said he'd never do Secret s at work
[45:20] again CU he went through all this thing
[45:22] and he he did all this he went through
[45:24] and got a thoughtful gift and wrapped it
[45:28] and all this and his the Splendor and
[45:30] everything it went with it and he was so
[45:31] proud of his gift to give and he got a
[45:35] box of leftover chocolates from
[45:37] Halloween oh my that was just barely had
[45:40] a bow on it and he was mad I like why
[45:44] would you be so upset because what he
[45:47] got wasn't at least close to equivalent
[45:50] to what he gave but that's not at all
[45:53] what Christmas is about Christmas is
[45:55] about giving
[45:57] Jesus gave Everything Jesus gave none of
[46:01] it was taking it was all to give and
[46:04] what he gave far surpassed anything that
[46:08] we could ever hope to try to give to him
[46:11] praise the Lord I I don't think he's
[46:13] quite that mad amen because it's not
[46:16] about reciprocity it's about giving it's
[46:19] about in your heart having a free will
[46:22] this even actually goes back to our
[46:24] Thanksgiving message of of Free Will
[46:27] giving it's something in your heart that
[46:29] you want to do right you want to give
[46:32] but you do that but see how much it
[46:34] means to those that have had Jesus born
[46:37] in
[46:38] them when Jesus is born in you it
[46:41] changes everything change your life
[46:44] everything about life and perspectives
[46:46] and none of those things don't matter
[46:49] anymore amen I remember when I was a boy
[46:53] uh when I was a little kid uh Emma and
[46:55] Joel's age uh I I my grandmother gave me
[47:00] socks every year and I couldn't stand
[47:03] it I I think I may have asked my dad one
[47:05] time I says does gran not know how to
[47:08] give anything other than orange sockes
[47:10] or or or yellow socks I I I every year
[47:16] uh socks that I never wore uh that I
[47:19] didn't like every year but that was just
[47:22] the selfish thought of of of a little
[47:25] boy
[47:26] you know who who wanted a toy or
[47:28] something I didn't want an old nasty
[47:29] pair of socks I wanted a toy or
[47:32] something but every year uh my my dad's
[47:36] mom gave me a pair of socks every year
[47:38] and I uh but now you understand more you
[47:42] get older and grow up it's not about
[47:44] what you get it's what you can give amen
[47:48] I I am much more happier about what I
[47:51] can give than anything that I could get
[47:54] in fact
[47:56] honestly uh in my family sitting here I
[47:59] don't I don't care if I ever got one
[48:01] gift wouldn't matter to
[48:03] me I I I don't care it's it's not a
[48:07] significant I appreciate them and I
[48:09] thank God for them but the greatest gift
[48:11] that we could ever get was Jesus Christ
[48:14] and he did everything and and gave
[48:17] everything amen that we could have life
[48:20] uh a couple of scriptures like I said I
[48:22] won't be long today St John chapter 16
[48:30] amen we're thankful that one of our
[48:32] prayers worked very
[48:34] quickly we had prayer for sister Norma
[48:36] during prayer and she show and she comes
[48:38] through the door that's pretty
[48:40] quick Lord answers prayer fast sometimes
[48:43] doesn't
[48:45] he amen so good to see sister Norman St
[48:49] John 16:7 one verse of scripture here
[48:53] Jesus said nevertheless I tell you the
[48:56] truth the truth see going back to the
[48:59] truth what is the truth that was
[49:02] pilate's question we didn't read that
[49:05] but the next verse down below was uh
[49:07] pilate said what is truth amen truth is
[49:10] standing right there truth is not
[49:12] something you tell amen truth is a
[49:15] person truth is Jesus Christ and Jesus
[49:19] is telling them nevertheless I tell you
[49:21] the truth now those who receive the
[49:23] truth believe the truth amen those are
[49:26] the ones that Jesus came to speak to
[49:28] those are the ones he came
[49:29] for I tell you the truth it is
[49:33] expedient for you in in other words it's
[49:36] important for you it means a lot to
[49:39] you that I go
[49:42] away for if I if I go not away the
[49:45] comforter will not come unto you but if
[49:48] I depart I will send him unto you praise
[49:52] the Lord the comforter that's why it was
[49:55] exped OB that Jesus I understand how
[49:58] they felt I I can only imagine they
[50:00] didn't want Jesus to go anywhere he had
[50:02] just told them up here I don't have much
[50:04] time left here and they're like no don't
[50:06] leave us we don't want you to leave us I
[50:07] wouldn't want him to leave me either
[50:09] amen but then after they got a
[50:11] revelation of what took place and then
[50:13] Pentecost actually revealed itself and
[50:16] took place and manifested there on the
[50:18] day of Pentecost they begin to
[50:20] understand a lot greater about what it
[50:21] meant when Jesus told him this that's
[50:24] why Jesus told people
[50:26] when you are converted then you can
[50:27] strengthen the brothers when you receive
[50:29] this Revelation when you can see what's
[50:31] going on when you know what is happening
[50:34] see God doesn't always show everything
[50:36] to us right away a lot of people some
[50:39] people in the message believe that uh
[50:41] brother brandham knew everything about
[50:43] everything about God and and and and all
[50:47] brother Brandon brother brandham only
[50:49] knew what God showed him because he was
[50:51] a man and only what brother brandom
[50:54] needed to know is what God showed him
[50:57] what God made him privy to God didn't
[50:59] show everything to brother brandham
[51:01] there's I I I I can't say I have a quote
[51:05] for this but I would imagine most of
[51:07] brother bram's life was lived just like
[51:09] ours he walked by
[51:11] faith amen you've heard the takes you've
[51:15] seen the video brother brandom even
[51:18] stood there himself and said I am
[51:19] helpless unless he comes right I am
[51:22] waiting on him I can't do anything
[51:25] unless he comes and operates this gift I
[51:28] am useless right I'm paraphrasing a
[51:30] little bit Yeah it had to be God to come
[51:32] and do it what's the same thing today
[51:34] brother bandam and that gift may be gone
[51:37] but God is still here to manifest
[51:39] himself and to operate that in our lives
[51:42] so that we know that Jesus Christ is
[51:44] still the same yesterday today and
[51:46] forever he hasn't changed he's still God
[51:49] and he's still here sending the Holy
[51:51] Spirit comforter that a new birth took
[51:54] place in my life
[51:56] that Jesus was birthed in your life not
[51:59] in a Manger amen although I I find it
[52:02] curious I haven't gone out a lot I've
[52:04] tried to stay home this week and rest my
[52:06] knee as much as possible but uh I
[52:08] haven't gone out a lot this week but I
[52:09] find it curious told my wife last night
[52:11] we went to dinner and I said I I you
[52:14] hardly ever find an nativity scene
[52:16] anymore they're scripturally inacurate
[52:19] most of them especially with the wise
[52:21] men and the gifts we've already went
[52:22] through that for two or three
[52:23] Christmases we know that's not accurate
[52:25] but just the mere fact that they would
[52:28] have them amen of Jesus being there as a
[52:32] part of their display in front of in
[52:35] their front
[52:36] yard that that to me means something uh
[52:39] might not to a lot of people and uh they
[52:41] seem to be going away but it still it's
[52:43] the same thing if it hadn't been for
[52:45] that but that perpetrated or per uh uh
[52:51] uh was ahead of was a preview
[52:55] of what it was to be in the birth in US
[53:00] of his birth in US Jesus birth in us
[53:04] first
[53:05] John or excuse me St John still chapter
[53:12] one so the question that becomes to all
[53:15] of us what does Christmas mean to
[53:19] you what does Christmas mean to you amen
[53:23] means a lot of things to a lot of people
[53:25] means nothing to some people amen but
[53:28] especially in this country Christmas
[53:30] means a lot to a lot of people they
[53:32] consider it something of a holy day they
[53:35] consider it sacred amen it's important
[53:39] to them is the way it's become and all
[53:42] that happened with it is still important
[53:44] to a lot of people it means a lot um the
[53:47] White House and and uh New York City and
[53:51] big cities places like this they they
[53:54] they had these big Pomp and Circumstance
[53:57] that they have because they cut down
[53:58] these 30 40 foot pine trees to come and
[54:03] set them up and and decorate them and
[54:05] put ornaments on them and all this stuff
[54:07] to to to celebrate the if nothing else
[54:11] the Pomp and Circumstance it follows
[54:13] with with with Christmas nowadays the
[54:16] commercialization of Christmas but it
[54:18] means something there's something
[54:20] significant that's behind it that's the
[54:22] whole point that's that's why they do
[54:25] that there there's a reason why they do
[54:28] that but let's look now St John chapter
[54:31] one uh let's just begin reading with
[54:34] verse
[54:36] one in the beginning was the word the
[54:40] logos that life that came out of God see
[54:43] another aspect see they don't we don't
[54:47] include that understandably scripturally
[54:50] in the Trinity as they call it father
[54:53] son holy ghost first second third third
[54:56] position uh but this is just as much a
[55:00] part that God played of the attribute of
[55:03] God as the
[55:05] others amen when that logos came out of
[55:09] God it played just as much just as
[55:12] important a role as the holy spirit it's
[55:15] a different role but it's just important
[55:18] as a role
[55:21] so to try to confine God into this
[55:24] little space it just is just arrogance
[55:28] and and excuse me but ignorance
[55:32] amen God is not three God is one and he
[55:36] has all these attributes this logos
[55:39] that's one of those attributes in the
[55:42] beginning was the word the word was with
[55:44] God and the Word was
[55:46] God the same was in the beginning with
[55:49] God all things were made by him and
[55:52] without him was not anything made that
[55:54] was made
[55:56] in him was life and that's Zoe the
[55:59] literal life of God in him was life and
[56:03] the life was the light of men that life
[56:06] that Zoey the literal life of God was
[56:08] the light of men and that's why uh John
[56:12] 3 uh 18 I think says that men love
[56:16] Darkness rather than light right because
[56:18] they've rejected Jesus Christ and when
[56:21] they reject Jesus Christ you reject
[56:23] light well what you reject you don't
[56:26] like you don't want to have anything to
[56:28] do with it they they they'd rather be in
[56:31] darkness why cuz they're deed are evil
[56:34] and they don't want Jesus because Jesus
[56:36] would shed light on their evil
[56:39] deeds and make them and con and condemn
[56:42] them for their deeds and people and
[56:45] people don't like that amen if you're
[56:48] not born
[56:50] again the Zoey God the life of God was
[56:54] the light that life was the light of men
[56:56] and the light shineth in darkness and
[56:58] the Darkness comprehended it
[57:01] not there was a man sent from God whose
[57:04] name was John the same came for a
[57:07] witness to Bear witness of the light
[57:09] that all men through him might believe
[57:13] he was not that light but was sent to
[57:15] Bear witness of that light that was the
[57:19] True Light listen now that was the True
[57:22] Light which lith every man that come
[57:24] cometh into the world every human not
[57:27] just males every human that cometh into
[57:30] the world he was in the world and the
[57:34] world was made by him and the world knew
[57:37] him
[57:38] not he came unto his own and his own
[57:42] received him not the world knew him not
[57:44] didn't want him came to his own his own
[57:47] knew him not didn't want
[57:49] him but amen the world didn't want him
[57:53] his people didn't want him
[57:55] but as many as received him now this is
[57:59] the same group of people that Jesus was
[58:02] speaking to Pilot about those that he
[58:05] spoke of Truth and those who are of the
[58:08] truth would hear his
[58:11] word not the world not even his own
[58:15] people but as many US received him to
[58:19] them praise God who would what hear the
[58:23] truth believe the truth become the truth
[58:27] Jesus Christ in flesh birthed again in
[58:32] US praise God Hall to
[58:36] them oh thank God I can say I'm one of
[58:40] them amen praise the Lord to them gave
[58:43] he power or the authority to become the
[58:48] sons of God even to them that believe on
[58:51] his name now that would lead you to
[58:53] believe that we were not originally a
[58:56] people we were not originally of the
[59:00] economy of God because he gave us the
[59:04] authority to become a Son of God praise
[59:09] the Lord The Authority by the Holy
[59:12] Spirit to be born again and to come into
[59:16] as a part of the economy of
[59:19] God by New Birth praise God hallelujah
[59:23] thank God for that birth he gave us the
[59:26] power to become the authority to become
[59:30] a Son of
[59:32] God even to them that believe on his
[59:35] name Hallelujah to believe on him which
[59:40] were born not of blood nor of the will
[59:43] of Flesh nor of the will of man but of
[59:46] God born of
[59:49] God praise the Lord Jesus thank you you
[59:53] say I was born of the Holy Ghost well
[59:55] the Bible says I was born of God now if
[59:57] you chop them into three pieces you got
[59:59] two different gods doing the same thing
[1:00:01] no it's just one God Amen it's just one
[1:00:06] God doing this act in your life bringing
[1:00:09] that Spirit into you his own Spirit the
[1:00:13] spirit of God what is the Holy Ghost
[1:00:15] what is the holy spirit it's the spirit
[1:00:17] of God you have a human Spirit if you
[1:00:21] had the ability you could take your
[1:00:22] spirit and put it into somebody else we
[1:00:25] don't have that ability we're not God
[1:00:27] he's God he takes his spirit and puts it
[1:00:31] in you now what is your human Spirit
[1:00:35] your human spirit is the life of the
[1:00:37] body so what would his Spirit
[1:00:40] be it would be the consummation of his
[1:00:43] life and what was his life be put in you
[1:00:48] hallelujah it's a new
[1:00:50] birth praise the lord it's God's spirit
[1:00:53] in you not another Spirit not a third
[1:00:56] person in the godhead but it's God's
[1:00:58] spirit in you the power that you have to
[1:01:02] become the authority by that Spirit to
[1:01:05] become a son or daughter of God
[1:01:08] hallelujah all praise the Lord we're
[1:01:11] born of God born of God new
[1:01:16] bird that thing that Nicodemus came to
[1:01:19] Jesus asking about amen maybe we'll just
[1:01:23] read it here minute but let me finish
[1:01:25] this 14th verse and the word the word
[1:01:30] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:01:34] beheld his glory the glory is that of
[1:01:37] the only begotten of the father full of
[1:01:39] grace and truth became word the word the
[1:01:43] logos became flesh praise the Lord now
[1:01:47] that same attribute that one attribute
[1:01:49] of God that we read here that word that
[1:01:52] logos that that came out of God God that
[1:01:55] brewed over the Earth that logos that
[1:01:58] God that went into the the the Flesh of
[1:02:01] MDC one day then became Jesus Christ
[1:02:05] it's the same logos not a different
[1:02:08] God not it's the same logos it's the
[1:02:12] spirit of God it's the life of God it's
[1:02:14] the word of God that that came out of
[1:02:17] God and brewed over the Earth you could
[1:02:18] do the same if you were not human you
[1:02:20] could do the same thing with yours but
[1:02:22] you can't because you're not God
[1:02:25] but he is God we confine God down to our
[1:02:29] little human regulation Saints and it
[1:02:31] doesn't have anything to do with our
[1:02:33] human abilities or our human regulations
[1:02:36] or our human inabilities if you will God
[1:02:39] can do whatever he wants whenever he
[1:02:41] wants however he wants and there's
[1:02:43] nobody can tell him how to do it better
[1:02:44] or different he's God the word made
[1:02:48] flesh that word that logos was made
[1:02:51] flesh how in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:02:54] where where did that logos go where did
[1:02:55] that word go what is the word of seed
[1:02:58] where did that seed go it went into the
[1:02:59] womb of Mary and it birth forth the
[1:03:02] child that child grew in the womb of
[1:03:04] Mary and she birth forth the Flesh of
[1:03:06] word Jesus
[1:03:09] Christ amen that birth now comes in
[1:03:14] us not in the same
[1:03:16] way amen and I thank God it's not in the
[1:03:19] same way I I I don't particularly myself
[1:03:22] as a male although uh people in the
[1:03:25] world are saying a man can have a baby
[1:03:27] I'm sorry I I that's just ridiculous but
[1:03:31] uh I I don't have a womb for that to
[1:03:33] have taken place in so I thank God that
[1:03:36] in the womb of my heart as we sang that
[1:03:38] song I think sister Le Fontaine wrot
[1:03:40] Cherry in the womb of my heart amen
[1:03:44] Jesus was birth forth again birth forth
[1:03:47] AR fresh praise the Lord and now living
[1:03:51] in us that's what the real Christmas is
[1:03:54] about that's what the real holiday we
[1:03:58] celebrate here amen it's not Jesus in a
[1:04:02] manger it's it's not Jesus out somewhere
[1:04:05] or uh in in the church or in a in a
[1:04:08] person it's Jesus Christ in you amen
[1:04:12] it's Jesus the birth of Christ in each
[1:04:14] of us That's What Christmas Means to us
[1:04:18] Christ in me I celebrate it because he's
[1:04:21] my life he's who I am he's everything I
[1:04:24] am am everything I could be Nicodemus
[1:04:26] now John 3 we go over a couple of
[1:04:30] chapters St John chapter 3 there was a
[1:04:33] man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus
[1:04:35] ruler of the Jews same came by uh the
[1:04:38] same came to Jesus by Night amen must
[1:04:41] have been sort of embarrassed to do what
[1:04:43] he was doing because he had to come by
[1:04:45] night said unto him Rabbi we we who he's
[1:04:48] by himself we know that thou art a
[1:04:51] teacher come from God for no man can do
[1:04:53] these Miracles that thou doest except
[1:04:56] God be with
[1:04:57] him Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:05:00] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:05:03] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:05:05] kingdom of God you notice that's the
[1:05:07] very first thing that Jesus told
[1:05:09] Nicodemus I mean talk about unloading a
[1:05:12] full load in one
[1:05:15] shot he didn't pull any punches with
[1:05:18] Nicodemus he didn't conversate with him
[1:05:21] he didn't try to smooze him any or make
[1:05:22] him feel good he just let him have it a
[1:05:25] man must be born
[1:05:28] again that's the bottom line didn't
[1:05:31] explain it didn't try to help him
[1:05:34] understand it didn't preach it to him he
[1:05:36] just said a man must be born again
[1:05:39] Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[1:05:41] born when he is old can he enter into
[1:05:44] the W uh the second time into his
[1:05:46] mother's womb and be born Jesus answered
[1:05:49] verily verily I say unto you except a
[1:05:51] man be born of water and of spirit he
[1:05:53] cannot enter into the king kingdom of
[1:05:54] God that which is born of the flesh is
[1:05:57] flesh and that which is born of the
[1:05:59] spirit is Spirit praise God hallah there
[1:06:02] it is in a
[1:06:04] nutshell those that celebrate Christmas
[1:06:06] is just a just a fleshly act to them I
[1:06:09] enjoy the holiday season I do I mean for
[1:06:12] the most part uh this time of year I one
[1:06:15] of the biggest reasons I like is because
[1:06:17] in Tucson the weather starts getting
[1:06:18] cooler but uh I like this time of year
[1:06:21] it's it's it's nice uh the atmosphere
[1:06:24] and things but it it's become so
[1:06:26] commercialized it's of the flesh
[1:06:28] everything about it is of the flesh but
[1:06:30] to us it's not that to us it's not of
[1:06:33] the flesh to us it's of the spirit Jesus
[1:06:35] told Nicodemus that which is of the
[1:06:37] flesh is flesh amen and they have theirs
[1:06:41] but but that which is of the spirit is
[1:06:43] spirit and we have ours amen and that is
[1:06:46] of the spirit What Spirit the spirit of
[1:06:48] Jesus
[1:06:49] Christ Marvel not that I said unto thee
[1:06:52] you must be born again the Wom bloweth
[1:06:54] where it l listeth and thou hearest the
[1:06:57] sound thereof but cast not tell which it
[1:07:00] come uh which it cometh and whether it
[1:07:02] goeth so is everyone that is born of the
[1:07:05] spirit Nicodemus answered and said unto
[1:07:08] him how can these things be see thinking
[1:07:12] naturally that's all he was thinking was
[1:07:14] naturally but Jesus speaking unto him of
[1:07:18] spiritual things all he could understand
[1:07:20] was that of the
[1:07:21] natural Jesus those that are of the
[1:07:24] natural is natural those that's of the
[1:07:26] flesh flesh but that that is of the
[1:07:28] spirit is of the spirit and of that
[1:07:32] Spirit comes Life Light
[1:07:37] truth Revelation understanding that
[1:07:41] comes from God doesn't come from us
[1:07:43] doesn't come from man it comes from God
[1:07:46] that that's of the spirit because only
[1:07:49] God is of the spirit hallah and and
[1:07:52] Jesus hold him you must be born again
[1:07:57] there is no
[1:07:58] exception there is no other
[1:08:02] way there is no other God there there is
[1:08:06] no other entity this is the only way you
[1:08:09] want eternal life there's one way and
[1:08:12] that's this way you want to go to heaven
[1:08:14] there's only one way this is the way now
[1:08:18] different religions call it different
[1:08:20] thing paradise whatever you might want
[1:08:21] to call it uh but if you want to go
[1:08:25] there in that place of perfect peace the
[1:08:27] only way to get there is through Jesus
[1:08:30] Christ regardless of what any other
[1:08:33] religion or anybody else or any other
[1:08:35] God says amen it must go through Jesus
[1:08:40] Christ first John I got two more
[1:08:43] scriptures I want to
[1:08:44] read 1 John chapter
