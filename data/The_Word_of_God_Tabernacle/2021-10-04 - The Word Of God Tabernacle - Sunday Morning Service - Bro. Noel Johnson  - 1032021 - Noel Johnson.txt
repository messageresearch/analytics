jesus christ thank you for coming out this morning you know it's nice when you know who's going to be preaching and you come anyway that's why that's always nice well you're standing if we open our bibles to galatians the fourth chapter we'll read verses three through seven i was i was praying what i was what to what to bring and the lord put on my heart and the title of this sermon if i could call it that and because you're sons and hopefully that'll make some sense as we get into this so in galatians the fourth chapter reading verses three through seven it says even so we when we were children were in bondage but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made every woman made under the law to redeem them they were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons god hath speared every son unto your hearts crying abba father wherefore there are no more servant but a son and of a son than an heir of god even through christ and let's pray our most gracious and loving heavenly father it is always our privilege to gather ourselves together with one heart one mind and one accord and then to offer up unto you songs of worship and praise lord because they came from our heart but lord now it's come the time when we've quietened ourselves to sit at your feet and receive what it is you'd have for us this morning the lord you've chosen to speak through men and so lord i stand before the purchase of your blood yes the lord let it be your words and not mine take the thoughts that you've given me lord and express them to the people yes the lord we all might be blessed i pray for i ask it in jesus precious name amen amen you can be seated what it says here in in in galatians it says because your son yes we're not in the world we never were a part of the world amen i mean we were born into the world okay we give you that but too often we keep looking at ourselves as being in the world part of the world and we deal with the world as we would deal with them in our flesh in our human in our humanity but yet what god has been trying to get across at least to me is don't think about yourself don't think in the physical realm but rise above that level and begin to recognize really what you are children of this world you are you are sons and daughters of god right yes and we have to change our thinking our whole approach to life has to change it says in john the first chapter but as many as received him to them gave me the power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god you came into this world because you're a part of god from the beginning and you came because god ordained for you to come now yes i understand in in running relay races they they always save the best for last so you may not think of yourself in that capacity but you're the best god save the best for last and he said we have a calling on our life it doesn't matter with your housewife or gas station attendant or whatever you might be that has that has no relevance amen you are here for a specific purpose for the for the sole purpose of manifesting and expressing the word for this generation and now you now it's up to us to fulfill the remainder of that and because he expressed it that way obviously that that's the way we look at it we are afraid to acknowledge and come to the realization we are sons and daughters of god amen we are afraid to step into that position we are afraid to step into that authority where we have we are afraid we're we're afraid all of a sudden we're afraid to take god at his word and begin to live the life that god has ordained for us to live we are to be the final manifestation of god to this world praise the lord the rapture is upon us the rapture is already in progress but there is a there's a function we have to fulfill but we cannot fulfill that if we're walking in our flesh and thinking of ourselves as flesh we we have to come to the realization he says get away from this hearing this guy he says you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of god see you always were the sons of god he said before even be uh he became material here on earth before there was anything but god he says you were in it you were in his you were you're one of his attributes you are an expression of god amen amen you are an expression you may not think of yourself in that way but you are you are a manifestation of god from the face of this earth amen god had you in his thinking god had had a plan for your life and so when you came into manifestation god sat there and he's organized you he he has gone through your life he has put things in your path to train you to become what you are if you will it's time to actually step into the full expression of god himself that lives in us praise the lord yes when right last sunday i guess that was when i ministered here we talked about romans 5 1-2 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith under this grace when we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god we read that oh yeah that sounds nice but in what do we struggle we look at ourselves we look at our flesh we look at our faults we look at all the things that we should think we should be doing and we know we never measure up but see god knew this yes this is not a surprise to him coping 19 is not a surprise to him our president minister government administration america has to be destroyed america has to fall we have the perfect administration to accomplish that they're doing an excellent job they're doing an excellent job but we have to we said being justified justified when the brother brought him justified he says it's as if you have never sinned amen and that's how he looks at you you are sinless amen you say but i make mistakes welcome to the club no but you and god's eyes are sinless and if god declares you to be sinless then you are sinless at least in his eyes when abraham and god finally looked at him and abraham believed god and god counted him put it amen even when he laughed at god even when he he had given to him all in all the problems that abraham had yet god never regarded him anything other than righteousness when you accept jesus christ because you are in christ because the blood of jesus christ covers you because you you are integrated into that body god declares you are righteous amen he always regards you as righteous he does not look at your shortcomings he does not look at your faults he doesn't look at your failures he regards you as righteous he looks upon you the same way he looks upon himself you are a sinless and as pure and virtuous as god himself that's how he views you but you have to accept it it's not just it can't just be nice words and they can't be oh yeah we yeah well that's nice it sounds nice but unless you believe it yes it doesn't do you any good if if all of a sudden somebody send you a check for a million dollars oh that's pretty i like the paint isn't it isn't it pretty checked isn't it look at those numbers on there oh isn't that nice isn't that nice until you take it to the bank it's just a piece of paper but once you take it to the bank then you can use it once you take the word of god and you begin to apply it to yourself and you take it to the bank of heaven and all of a sudden he says you are you declared i'm righteous i got false and failures but you yourself have said i'm righteous and i'm here at your service to do what you want me to do once you take it to the bank of heaven and you cash it then you can use it but that takes faith you have to actually believe that what that verse says it means amen brother branham in the first seal he says how can a man how can a man say that the bride of christ goes into tribulation she took away from the tribulation if the church has been judged and they have judged themselves and have accepted the blood how can god judge a man that's perfect that's perfectly totally sinless amen okay all right he said you say there's no such person every born-again believer true believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before god yes because he's not trusting in his works in the but in the blood of jesus christ praise the lord you cannot trust in yourself it's like we we went over in habakkuk you know the man who whose soul is lifted up or something like that the guy who trusts in himself god won't even help him god won't even regard him but the just shall live by his faith and that faith is not believing for something no it's actually believing in someone it's believing that god himself has declared you to be this and you have come to a relationship with jesus christ with yeah with jesus christ where you walk with him you talk with him he's your best friend he's your best buddy like one of the songs says you know not only are you king but you also are my brother and so i forget the word of the song but we have to come to this because your son amen because your daughters because you are a part of god from the beginning yes now you're here and god is wanting to do something through you but you have to believe who god says you are yes that's true amen he goes on he that's born of god does not commit sin for he cannot sin how can you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of jesus christ is between him and god yes yes you're sinless because the blood's there once you cross brother branham talks about yeah there's this ring of blood around around the earth so to speak and he says as long as that blood is there he says it covers it protects but once you pass beyond calvary but if you have not accepted jesus christ as your savior you pass beyond that veil no you're condemned because you refuse to accept the only provision god has made for salvation but we've accepted it we have accepted the blood of jesus christ we have accepted calvary we have accepted what god has done for us there therefore regard how god regards you amen he says jesus said to be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect have you ever thought of that god is perfect i mean he's perfectly sinless and i mean you know how how would y'all explain him and he said be perfect be the same perfect as my as the father is well how is that possible he said he said he said but jesus required it if jesus required it he's got to make a way for it and he has his own blood it's not about you and accept what god has said that you are amen he says invisible union he says he the bridegroom took away your shame in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water by the word and in the in the blood of life that's what that's what the bible said he said your first husband that you're married to which is the world he said that it was a dog it's done away yes you're no longer married you no longer have to obey your flesh you no longer have to obey you no longer have to be controlled by the by the evil powers you can rise above that but you have to believe this yes you have to believe that yeah when i accepted christ as my savior when i went into the waters and i was baptized what did i do i buried the old man and i rose in a new man i rose to newness of life i rose to a life in which i served god it wasn't immediate oh no but slowly over time god took away this and he took away that he took away this he took away that what was he doing he was molding he was changing me from the inside no longer lived by by by a law which has been written on tables of stone he says but now he's taken and written into our hearts and our mind where literally it becomes a part of us we live the word we live the law because now it's our nature to live that law you do that all the time well no but more and more in the life that you're living you can you should be have seen a change in in your life completely justified as though you never did in the beginning this is my message to the church now brother branham prayed that in 65 invisible union this is my message to the church now why you have to believe this that you that you never sin from the beginning that you are standing totally and you are the virtue of sin the bride of the lord jesus to give to us this is how god regards you he says this is my message to the church now he says it's as if you had never sinned amen so that is how god regardless why did god send the prophet to tell the bride who she is and to make us come to the realization there is a there is something that the bride itself must fulfill and he said this this is my message to the church now he said amen every god every child where you're studying i'm trying to tell you i'm trying pull away from what you learned in the baptist church and pentecostal church and whatever other churches you might have been a part of i know i had a friend of mine lonnie jenkins and and i would listen to other ministers minister and i struggled i says why can they come to the revelation that they have and i agree with everything they're saying that i cannot i cannot make the transition so i spent a week with him and we talked and we talked he says well i know what your problem is you're trying to take the word of god and you're trying to take this message and filter it through what you learn the baptist church and the assemblies of god yeah he said you can't do that right well how do you do it i take what brother adam said i go back into the word and i find where he said it his theology the things that he learned in different churches and stuff he didn't rely upon his own intellect he didn't rely upon the commentaries although i read the commentary because sometimes he gives me another trait of thought which i would not have thought of otherwise and then i go back to the message and go back into the word and because i have to substantiate it in that but it comes down to the place you cannot you cannot rely on what you've been taught you have to rely upon what god was trying to tell us through the prophet that is the whole reason why god sent him amen he said you're standing complete justified like you never did in the first place you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and worship in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned in the first place yes amen that's what you are yourself brother brown says amen and so don't look at yourself don't look at your fault from church comings and all the things that that because of your humanity yes no look at what god said because only as you can only as you begin to accept what god says you are can you actually begin to have the faith to be able to operate what god is trying to get us to operate in today amen it goes on in hebrews 3 and 1 it says wherefore holy brother partakers are the heavenly caller consider the apostle high priest of our profession christ jesus it's interesting in went into into a commentary it says wherefore holy brethren he said the apostle calls the hebrews brethren not because them you can feel their feelings and all the other things that go with it like i'm saying i'm not related to anybody in the physical sense to the ones in india no but they're my family amen because we all have the same father so we said on a fellowship because our father was the same spirit is there to working amongst us and oh my god so we we enter into with each other i mean it's like we've known him all of our lives amen the restoration of the bridegroom says you're going to form what's known to me as a bride you will be part you will be part of me you'll be my bride my life will be in your body just just like husband and wife as one person you and i are going to be are going to be one and there you'll know that i am the father the fathers of me i and you and you and me oh i just love that and satan gets so angry at that see the oneness of god do you understand the implication of what he just said there we are an expression of god yes in one sense we're part of the godhead because it's all the same we're an attribute we're an expression it makes us all related one to the other we are part of the godhead in in in the sense that brother brad and put it here because we are an expression we are an attribute we are a manifestation of god all that god was reporting to christ all the christ was he poured into the church there you are god speaking through him to us okay he says now look now the bride the bride are one tree of life in other words like husband and wife is one christ in the bride they are one same thing same spirit same words same signs everything else for the works that i do shall you do also you see well how can i do the work for god you allow god to do it through you it's not up to you to produce praise it's about up to you to yield yourself to god so that god can in his sovereignty can brother branham never performed one miracle he said i was just standing there when the angel came down yeah yeah well i had in discernment i was just standing there and god used my voice well this miracle happened i just happened to be standing there when god did this and i just happened to be standing there when god did that brethren that i have look at how god how i'm able to sit there and tell you the secrets of your heart he never went that route never once i just happened to be there and god decided to do it amen well what about in our lives when all of a sudden that somebody has a knee and all of a sudden the anointing falls on you you see all the anointing is just for the ministers no it's not every member of the body of the light of jesus christ when god's spirit comes and anoints you he anoints you for a purpose he anoints you to pray for someone he anoints you to speak to someone he he leads and guides your path so that all of a sudden somebody is in need and what do you do all of a sudden god puts the words in in your mind and speaks them out through your voice and you say where did that come from it was god you meant a man it was god doing right true brother be moved and he questioned that yeah and so the angel of god was i'm paraphrasing okay but the angel said in him well he says when you're in discernment who's speaking oh that's god speaking god's just using your voice what happens when a minister is standing and all of a sudden another thought comes into his head and he goes along that rabbit trail who's speaking amen it's god speaking it's god speaking to the needs of the individual i can take the same note and i can preach it ten times and it always comes out different because the need of the people in front of me is different than than in every single congregation because god puts in in our in our thinking and he says and he says you have to be able to preach it no it's god speaking amen if you will accept it as god speaking through him it'll do you some good yeah oh yeah that's just a password he's just mouthing off again just you know no no no you have to accept it as god yes yes why do we accept what brother branham has to say as as god speaking through him amen i'm not saying that every word brother is trying to say that but when you begin to look at the thought pattern that god is trying to express through him he's trying to tell you something god is speaking through him you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ well that was just the prophet if you say that was just a prophet fine and it's just words but no that's god speaking if you can accept that that's different god's telling me i am the pure virtuous sinner's bride of jesus christ i am totally justified in his presence it's as if i never have sinned god is telling me that well if i can accept that as being god speaking to me that changes my priesthood my whole concept of things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captive of their salvation perfect through suffering jesus christ was the one who created all things and for his pleasure they are and were created yes so it's talking about for it became him who is him this is jesus christ he became all things wife so that he could go and he could pay the price of redemption for for god's children amen for god for you he died on the cross for you it has to be a personal revelation to you when you accepted jesus christ as your savior did you realize that jesus christ hung on the cross for you do you realize that the the his the shedding of his blood was for for your benefit you realize the stripes played on his back was for your healing amen can you accept that yes because until you can accept that and make it personal to you it doesn't do you any good like i say when you get a check for a million dollars until you pay for it but all of a sudden you cash that that thing oh now it's including you and the family okay amen and for which cause he is not ashamed to call you brethren amen he is being related christ says you are related to him that's what this verse says you are related to god through jesus christ for as much then as the children were partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same became our kinsmen that through death he might destroy him that had power of death so that he could take us as his children and redeem us back to god and he was going in hebrews 3 1 says wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling particularly he says because the grace by which the saints are called is from heaven and it is to heaven that they are called amen we are called to live above this world we are called to live above the cares and and the problems and the things that we that we experience every single day we have to we have to begin to accept the fact that god is our father and god as our father loves us he loves you how do you know he loves you because for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life god loves you he's demonstrated that love at the cross if he loved you enough to die for you even when you were in sin even when you you're against god even though you're amongst god even though you violated all the laws of god if he died for you at that point in time and he loves you enough to do that why won't you accept what he's trying to give you why won't you accept the fact that you're the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ why won't you accept the fact that god has totally justified you because of the blood of jesus christ why won't you accept the fact that he has already healed you because of the striped plate on your back yes sir faith is not believing for something faith is believing in someone yes and if you can believe in the god that has called you if you can believe in the god that has redeemed you if you can believe that god loves you if you can believe that you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ if you can accept these and grasp hold of these facts and you go to god and say well lord i have a need boy i'm your father what do you have in need of son amen what do you have a need of a daughter well satan's attacking me and i got this illness is thank you god for healing me amen thank you god what did abraham have to do thank you god for my son thank you god for my son he had to say that for 25 years yeah thank you god for you know well okay so you have an illness okay what the bible say call for the elders of the church they'll lay hands on you prayer face will save the sick and you know amen so you either look at the symptoms you look at the promise amen and that's where the battle is yes yes your body says oh no you know you're not but he said i am yes yes [Music] it wasn't him believing for something it was him believing in someone well that's where we have to come we have to believe that god has the ability to take his promise he has given to us and bring it to pass amen it doesn't matter the circumstances right it merely matters matters our faith after this i looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as away trumpet calling me and saying hey there and i will show you things that must be hereafter amen this is after the church ages ladies still going on around us but god's going to profit amen get away from your denominational teachings amen get away from the way that you perceive things come up higher come into a higher realm come into the realms of faith come into the realms of believing the word come into the realms of accepting who you are and what god said that you are amen rise above all of these things because only when you do that can god be given to you that's what i mean the whole message was to try and to take the word of god and make it real to the people why are all the miracles that god performed through brothers so we would have faith in the god that has called us he could i mean he would sit there and he would pray for thousands of people and god in his mercy and there's a couple of places he made mention he looked at a person and oh yeah i believe he says no you don't have a seat for a while and then he would preach the word and he would preach the word and you could see in that person always of the faith slowly begin to rise until finally what would happen all of a sudden the person accepted their healing not because brother brown prayed for them not because he laid hands on them no but because also their faith in god began to rise to the place they could accept what god said amen and once they got to the place they could accept it then they were healed amen you don't have to have the discernment he says all you have to do is have the faith to believe and if you have the faith to believe it's a finished word and the rising of the sun now who is the son of man in the beginning and and then it goes on and it says in the book book of luke as we just quoted in luke 17 and the 30th verse and malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with he says that that word again is waived over the people that the dead traditions of men is dead and the son of man is alive again with the baptism of the holy ghost right amongst us and living and living and giving us life amen oh yeah he had the gift of discernment he had the gift of the word of knowledge no he says i'm standing he said you know who i'm waiting for i'm waiting for him amen and sometimes he'll sit there and he'll just talk for ten minutes and also he's here now now i take every spirit under under my control for the glory of god yes he realized he was powerless until god but he realized when god came and then brother branham could yield himself to that angel to jesus christ he says he knew from that point on it was no longer him amen he yielded himself to the spirit okay right right because that was the son of man being made manifest brother branham was a son of man revealing the son of man but here again but god was using him okay so you said well that was great that was brother okay now relate that to you yes oh but i'm not a prophet not to ask him to be a prophet but what god is wanting to do he wants you to so yield your bodies to him so that he can work his life through you the same way he did through the prophet amen jesus christ i don't perform any miracles at all you steal the storm you walked on the water you raised the dead you did this you did that no i never did anything he does all these things what do you have when you accepted jesus christ as your savior you went through what are baptism claiming the name of jesus christ and god gave you the holy ghost what did you receive the third person of the trinity no you received god god himself now came and lived in you but you have to let him work with you do you realize you can stop god you have the ability to stop god because if god tells you to do something and you refuse just okay but if you'll obey then god will work through you so he goes on he says that that that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is a lot as the son of god is alive again with the baptisms among us and giving us life as christ was the first one to rise from from all the prophets and so forth although it typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church there have to be that the a she's waved again in the last days oh my waving the sheep what was this she's the first one that came to maturity so it's talking about christ amen the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it that proved it was the sheep he said and for the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominational there will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there praise the lord that was the ministry that god performed through the prophet yes the prophet was not jesus christ the prophet was not god the prophet was a man the prophet was a sinner saved by grace he said god above us in the father god in us in the sun cleansing his way condescending coming down making way for me to get back and bring his people back to the manifestation manifested sons of god like like they had them in the garden of eden the whole world is is groaning and waiting for the hour for that manifestation and things that are to be we must live the word because the bride is part of the like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the form of the bride that is to be expressed in the hour that we're now living amen jesus christ no matter if he was in a storm and the gales knocking the boat from one side to the other he was standing in the face of a mess of demons if he was hanging around and never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quite as he could be saying why because he was simply unconscious of fear of anything around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether
