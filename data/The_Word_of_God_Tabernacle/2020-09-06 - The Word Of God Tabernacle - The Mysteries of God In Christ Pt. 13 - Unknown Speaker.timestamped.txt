[11:48] you glory praise and honor for it now in
[11:50] the name of the lord jesus christ
[11:52] amen amen amen god bless you amen
[11:56] welcome
[11:56] you can be seated if you'd like
[12:01] amen i want to personally thank brother
[12:03] roger
[12:05] there's only probably a few people know
[12:07] the efforts and the finances and all
[12:09] that brother roger and sister monica put
[12:10] into
[12:11] uh making this the place that it is
[12:13] obviously you can see it's not quite
[12:15] finished
[12:16] that's a few finishing touches to go but
[12:19] we finally got a decent electrician out
[12:20] here to put the lights in and
[12:22] got them wired up so that helped a
[12:24] little bit but now we're thankful for
[12:26] that but
[12:27] brother rogers put a lot of time effort
[12:29] finances into making this the
[12:31] carpet ceiling lights electrical
[12:33] everything
[12:34] monica with the drapes and bought the
[12:36] chairs the lord just blessed it all
[12:38] along
[12:39] when we first started this one of the
[12:42] first things we started thinking about
[12:44] actually separate but when we came
[12:46] together for job
[12:48] he mentioned it and i said that's what i
[12:50] had been talking about
[12:51] was getting chairs and uh the lord
[12:54] blessed chairs
[12:55] uh we were looking at paying 35 40
[12:58] a chair for the exact same chair you're
[13:01] sitting in that he ended up paying
[13:03] less than 10 dollars a piece for maybe
[13:05] ten minutes delivered
[13:07] delivered and the little racks on the
[13:09] bottom cost two three dollars
[13:11] more per chair so the lord just from the
[13:14] very get-go my point is from the very
[13:15] get-go the lord's just
[13:16] blessed this and we're so thankful god
[13:18] has made a way and brought it to the
[13:20] place that it is today brother angel
[13:22] and his family his dad his brother his
[13:26] brother-in-law have
[13:27] done a lot of work getting the floor up
[13:29] and putting the carpet down and
[13:31] all that was done just so very thankful
[13:33] for everything that's been done to go
[13:34] into making this
[13:36] um and and still moving forward with it
[13:38] but what it is today and
[13:40] god's just been so good to us i had a
[13:42] wonderful time in the lord yesterday
[13:44] with the baptisms and
[13:46] uh just trust the lord bless that and
[13:48] each one of you today
[13:49] amen so we want to open our song books
[13:51] now if you did if you missed the song
[13:53] books apologize
[13:54] one of the things skipped my mind was a
[13:56] table back there me and brother roger
[13:58] talked about it but
[13:59] we i forgot to get one we had some at
[14:02] the house we could have brought a couple
[14:03] of them
[14:04] back in the back if you don't have a
[14:05] song book there's some
[14:07] back next to the door we just set them
[14:09] on the floor back there so if
[14:10] you need to grab one grab one we're
[14:12] going to turn to song number 426
[14:16] uh we're going to start here and i think
[14:18] it's very
[14:20] powerful that one of the songs that i
[14:22] had yesterday to sing today micah was
[14:24] the very first song he started playing
[14:26] here
[14:27] so it's going to be the next song but uh
[14:30] very thankful for that
[14:31] i appreciate too of course uh sister
[14:34] norma as soon as i mentioned something
[14:35] about a pulpit
[14:37] norma said her daughter's friend uh
[14:39] kathy's friend wanted to build one for
[14:41] us and i said well praise the lord how
[14:43] do you want it and
[14:44] i sent a couple videos or a couple
[14:46] pictures there's nothing like the
[14:47] pictures
[14:48] but it's a beautiful pulpit sister norm
[14:51] was afraid i wouldn't like it because it
[14:52] wasn't like the picture i said
[14:54] sister the picture was just something to
[14:57] go by it wasn't exactly
[14:59] but then brother roger i told called
[15:01] brother roger said it was here and
[15:03] he's welcome to use it for his streaming
[15:04] and he got me looking so well this is
[15:06] just inspired of the lord
[15:08] the three-step justification
[15:10] sanctification the holy ghost comes
[15:12] right up into the cross right to the
[15:13] word
[15:14] amen and he didn't know anything about
[15:16] that the man who built this
[15:18] but the three steps of grace coming up
[15:21] from the bottom and
[15:22] coming right up into the cross amen
[15:25] that's all it is right to the word
[15:27] praise the lord so i appreciate daniel's
[15:29] his name so you want to mention his name
[15:31] in prayer who built this for us and
[15:33] i'm very thankful for that too so amen

[25:06] the door
[25:07] so if you don't mind if you have to
[25:08] please i'd prefer you didn't but if you
[25:10] have to
[25:11] go out to back the wall and go down the
[25:13] back and through the door and the
[25:14] bathroom's out there on the right
[25:16] uh you'll see the door there next to the
[25:18] refrigerator that's where the restroom
[25:20] is so
[25:21] if you need to go there so god bless you
[25:23] today um
[25:24] i got some news yesterday
[25:29] from north carolina
[25:32] that shocked me but was
[25:38] tough on the heart
[25:42] because it involved people that i know
[25:43] and know fairly well and micah does too
[25:46] fairly well um a couple young men that
[25:49] was that
[25:49] used to go to brother tim hume's church
[25:51] uh in gastonia north carolina
[25:54] was in a bad car accident yesterday and
[25:56] one of the young men
[25:57] passed uh he was 17 years old his name
[26:00] was nate from nathaniel barrett
[26:02] and quite a fine young man quite a
[26:06] godly family and he lost his life in the
[26:09] accident
[26:10] the other young man was caleb capps who
[26:13] of course
[26:14] brother roger knows kenny capps very
[26:15] well growing up the tabernacle in
[26:17] jeffersonville together
[26:19] uh kenny's son caleb katz
[26:22] he got banged up pretty bad he's
[26:23] supposed to be in surgery right now
[26:26] uh i don't know any details i don't know
[26:28] how it happened
[26:29] first thing i heard from was tabitha but
[26:31] then i saw on facebook
[26:32] several other ones that was mentioning
[26:35] in prayer and of course i'll let
[26:36] mike know and he remembers them he
[26:38] didn't necessarily
[26:40] they weren't necessarily that friend i
[26:41] guess because those they were
[26:43] 11 12 years old when he was there so it
[26:46] wasn't
[26:47] kind of the group that was with them but
[26:49] still that church at that time
[26:50] those young people they were very close
[26:53] and i spent a lot of time with
[26:54] because micah was there spent a lot of
[26:56] time with him a lot of times those young
[26:58] people
[26:58] and brother kenny and sister kim's boy
[27:01] was just
[27:01] little fella 11 12 years old but
[27:05] he's supposed to be in surgery right now
[27:07] i believe he has a broke leg and
[27:09] some other injuries so just please
[27:12] remember them in prayer if you would
[27:13] again i don't know what happened or any
[27:16] details
[27:16] but i know there is a grieving family
[27:19] for their
[27:20] son and he was i think he was 17 but he
[27:23] was married
[27:24] so he had a wife so please remember that
[27:27] family if you would the barrett family
[27:29] the cap family
[27:30] and all those that are associated
[27:32] affiliated
[27:34] back there it's a
[27:38] it's a little different in north
[27:39] carolina than it is in tucson
[27:41] if you've never been there or
[27:42] experienced it it's hard to understand
[27:44] but
[27:47] and to our shame in tucson
[27:50] uh we're not as
[27:54] close-knit as you'd say
[27:57] uh used to be that way in north carolina
[27:59] churches were against churches and
[28:00] people didn't fellowship together and
[28:01] stuff but
[28:02] past 15 20 years or so maybe not quite
[28:05] that long
[28:06] it's really changed and
[28:10] and really all the churches back there
[28:12] that are the
[28:13] message affiliation they're very close
[28:16] most of them are very close a lot of the
[28:18] young people spend time together
[28:20] there's a lot of fellowship together so
[28:23] not only are the families affected not
[28:25] only as a church they're going to but
[28:27] the church that they used to go to
[28:29] and i would promise you all the other
[28:31] churches that are local around there
[28:34] are grieving and and hurting this
[28:37] morning for
[28:38] for that of course nathaniel's
[28:41] he's at his reward so he's
[28:44] where we want to be but obviously it's a
[28:47] it's a tough time for them so please
[28:48] remember the barrett family cat family
[28:50] specifically in prayer
[28:52] and then all the ones that are affected
[28:53] by nate's passing and
[28:56] just and of course prayer for caleb's
[28:58] recovery from his injuries so
[29:00] please remember that prayer i got a

[38:42] can't live our lives with the
[38:43] understanding

[39:48] i was so tired last night and i heard
[39:51] how jesus christ comes and visits when
[39:54] two or three are gathered together in
[39:56] his name
[39:57] and i was talking to the believer last
[39:59] night i was late my
[40:00] ass was getting later and lay her house
[40:02] get so tired and then
[40:04] we just started talking about the word
[40:06] and when we started talking about the
[40:08] word all of a sudden
[40:09] people complain they don't hear from god
[40:13] but as we were talking about the word
[40:15] all of a sudden
[40:16] thoughts just kept coming in we're
[40:18] online and and
[40:20] finally i woke up to god was speaking to
[40:23] us
[40:26] putting those thoughts in our minds just
[40:28] listen and just spell them out
[40:29] praise the lord and the more we listen

[46:10] now and uh
[46:12] go to the word of god
[46:28] amen welcome again to the house of the
[46:31] lord appreciate each one of you being
[46:33] here today
[46:34] amen let's go to revelation chapter 10
[46:37] we're going to begin uh our scripture
[46:40] reading again with verse 7 as we have
[46:41] done
[46:43] some of you maybe all of you know or
[46:45] been going
[46:47] dealing with the mysteries of god in
[46:49] christ or christ the mystery of god
[46:50] revealed
[46:52] kind of titled it a little backwards in
[46:54] the way brother branham did but
[46:56] that was for a purpose because of the
[46:58] mysteries of god in christ
[47:00] uh realizing what the scripture says
[47:02] about the mystery of god would be
[47:04] finished
[47:04] that mystery being jesus christ the
[47:06] revelation of who christ is
[47:08] he's not the second person of a trinity
[47:11] he's not just some good prophet
[47:13] he was god almighty build in flesh and
[47:16] upon that foundation is what this church
[47:18] is built upon his bride so
[47:20] mysteries of god in christ part 13 is
[47:23] what we're on now and having the
[47:24] preeminence in his people
[47:26] this would be part five of having the
[47:28] preeminence in his people
[47:30] so we'll begin at um uh revelation
[47:33] chapter 10 verse 7.
[47:34] read here again but in the days of the
[47:36] voice the seventh angel when he shall
[47:38] begin to sound
[47:40] the mystery of god should be finished as
[47:42] he has declared to his servants the
[47:44] prophets now
[47:45] you can be seated if you'd like i'm not
[47:47] going to background very much
[47:49] kind of hard to background 13 separate
[47:52] messages
[47:54] so if it's something in that that is uh
[47:57] you have to kind of catch up with maybe
[47:59] you can go back on youtube and look them
[48:01] up and
[48:01] see where we're at when we get to that
[48:03] point but basically what we're looking
[48:05] at
[48:05] is the word of god realizing the
[48:07] fulfillment brother branham in
[48:08] revelation 10
[48:10] 7 and the seventh angel message was to
[48:12] begin to sound
[48:14] then the mystery singular was to be
[48:17] finished
[48:18] and that mystery was jesus christ who
[48:21] christ is christ told them as they asked
[48:24] him and said who do men say that i
[48:26] am and they said some says your lies
[48:29] some says your prophet son says you're
[48:30] this or that and jesus looked at them
[48:32] personally
[48:33] and said but now who do you say that i
[48:35] am and peter
[48:37] spoke up and said thou art the christ
[48:40] the son of the living god
[48:42] jesus said flesh and blood had not
[48:44] revealed this but my father in heaven's
[48:46] revealed
[48:47] this to you reveal who he was to you
[48:50] and on that rock who jesus christ is
[48:53] i will build my church so the foundation
[48:56] of this building that he has
[48:58] preeminence in is that building that
[49:00] he's built up a
[49:02] mini-member body called the bride of
[49:04] jesus christ for this last day
[49:06] and we've worked on and looking at that
[49:09] foundation that was laid which is jesus
[49:11] christ
[49:12] again not some trinity not three gods
[49:15] but the
[49:16] god one god and him being
[49:19] that foundation that this church is
[49:21] built upon
[49:22] without that solid correct foundation
[49:25] it don't matter how many times you come
[49:26] to an altar don't matter how many times
[49:28] you get baptized
[49:29] it doesn't matter how many times you
[49:31] come to church how much size you pay
[49:33] or how good of a person you are unless
[49:35] that foundation is laid in your life
[49:37] of jesus christ and the revelation of
[49:39] who he is
[49:41] then you're lost that church is built on
[49:45] that foundation
[49:47] jesus christ that foundation that he
[49:50] said his church would be built upon
[49:52] who is jesus all those other things are
[49:54] great find when we're christians we
[49:56] we obey the word and we do what the word
[49:58] says and we baptize we come to church
[50:00] and we read the word and
[50:02] we're obedient to that but friend unless
[50:03] that foundation's there it'll be just
[50:05] like the
[50:06] just like the seed that ends up on the
[50:08] rock it'll be like the seed that ends up
[50:10] in stony ground it'll be like the
[50:12] seed that ends up in the wrong place
[50:14] that's sown in the wrong place
[50:16] but it's got to be in the right
[50:18] foundation the seed has got to be in the
[50:20] right foundation
[50:22] for it to grow up a house of the lord
[50:25] we've talked about that and we've got to
[50:27] the preeminence part
[50:29] and understanding what preeminence is
[50:31] and the preeminence that god has
[50:34] in his bride now that's what we're
[50:36] focused on
[50:37] so go to colossians and as we read this
[50:40] we enter into this subtitle having the
[50:43] preeminence in his people
[50:44] i want to go to colossians 1 17 again
[50:50] and you might want to hold your bibles
[50:51] near because i've got
[50:53] quite a few scriptures i want to try to
[50:55] get through today
[50:56] to finish this having the preeminence in
[50:58] his people
[50:59] subtitle lord willing next week we'll
[51:02] get to the third part
[51:03] or the restoration of the kingdom which
[51:06] would be the third part of this
[51:08] uh mysteries of god in christ or christ
[51:10] the mystery god revealed so
[51:12] we're going to try to read a few
[51:13] scriptures here but now first uh excuse
[51:15] me colossians 1
[51:17] 17 man the light's so much better in
[51:21] here
[51:23] sometimes i had to strain at my house to
[51:25] read the bible
[51:26] and he is before all things and by him
[51:30] all things consist now that's jesus of
[51:32] course
[51:33] he jesus is before all things of course
[51:36] we know as we went into revelation 3 14
[51:39] that talked about
[51:39] being the beginning of the creation of
[51:41] god he is before
[51:43] all things and by him all things consist
[51:46] or that is stand everything stands
[51:49] today it is what it is because of him
[51:53] he is the head jesus is the head of the
[51:56] body
[51:57] that we just talked about the church who
[51:59] is the beginning the firstborn from the
[52:02] dead that in
[52:02] all things he might have the preeminence
[52:05] now again
[52:06] we talked about that all things having
[52:08] preeminence
[52:09] jesus having the preeminence in all
[52:12] things so
[52:13] it's not just human life or his bride he
[52:16] has preeminence or look to have
[52:17] preeminence in
[52:18] but body life animal life god has the
[52:21] preeminence but we're focused on
[52:23] him having the preeminence in his people
[52:26] god having the preeminence in his pride
[52:29] god having his preeminence in your life
[52:33] that is first place amen we talked about
[52:35] the word pre
[52:36] and what that means first first place
[52:39] eminence
[52:40] amen superiority uh just like someone
[52:43] would call the pope your imminence or
[52:45] something to that effect
[52:47] uh sorry there's no imminency there
[52:49] there's only imminency to the lord jesus
[52:51] it's not to a man it's to the lord jesus
[52:54] so when he talks about preeminence
[52:56] that is first in superiority in your
[52:59] life
[53:00] amen he has superiority in your life
[53:03] or he should if he doesn't then
[53:06] uh i pray you give you give it to him
[53:09] today
[53:10] so many people want to uh say that they
[53:13] live their lives on their own and
[53:14] there's ministers out there there's
[53:16] people in the world today there's
[53:17] nominal christians
[53:18] there's people that are high high
[53:20] influence and high fluency people that
[53:22] say
[53:23] you know you're your own god and we do
[53:25] our own thing and we live because
[53:27] you know we are jesus christ we are
[53:29] bought with a price friend
[53:31] if you are a christian today you're
[53:33] bought with a price you do not belong to
[53:35] yourself you belong to him
[53:37] and just like any item that you own you
[53:40] have the dictation of what you
[53:42] do with that item right you allow that
[53:45] and but as as we belong to god
[53:49] god wants to move us and god wants to
[53:51] shape us and he wants to mold us and he
[53:53] wants to
[53:54] cause us to go by the leading of his
[53:56] spirit we have to be willing to do that
[53:59] because
[54:00] we have a soul which is worth 10 million
[54:03] worlds but gives
[54:04] self uh self will and we have self will
[54:08] and we can deny that you know some
[54:10] people say well if god wants to save me
[54:12] he'll come and make me be saved no it
[54:14] doesn't work that way
[54:16] god you have to be willing you have to
[54:19] give yourself to the lord
[54:20] for him to have preeminence in that you
[54:23] have to subject yourself to his will
[54:26] whatever it is
[54:27] sometimes it's not easy sometimes it's
[54:29] very challenging
[54:30] sometimes it's very difficult what the
[54:32] lord wants from us
[54:34] sometimes it grates against the flesh
[54:37] sometimes he'll take
[54:38] uh and make things happen just to bring
[54:41] around a certain result
[54:43] sometimes he takes certain people home
[54:47] for a reason to bring about a a result
[54:50] that he wants
[54:51] but in all things we give him the
[54:53] preeminence
[54:55] it's not my life it's his life i give my
[54:57] life died and give my life to him many
[55:00] years ago now
[55:01] are there times that my flesh rises up
[55:03] and does things probably shouldn't do or
[55:05] contrary to what he would have shown me
[55:07] to do
[55:08] of course is there sometimes the lord
[55:10] unctions me in some way and i
[55:12] i just don't quite listen to that voice
[55:14] as well as i should have and i do
[55:16] something else and get in trouble for
[55:17] doing it
[55:18] or see how this path would have worked
[55:20] if i had just said you know
[55:21] the lord showed me to do that i decided
[55:24] to do this
[55:25] i felt the lord pulling me to go a
[55:27] certain way but but i did this
[55:28] anyway and you get in trouble for it
[55:32] god wants the preeminence in everything
[55:35] in all of our lives so even though it
[55:38] talks about
[55:38] the preeminence he will have the
[55:40] preeminence in all things
[55:43] we're talking about him having the
[55:45] preeminence in us
[55:46] in our lives allowing him letting him
[55:49] wanting him
[55:51] to have the preeminence in our lives if
[55:53] you knew
[55:54] that i knew exactly
[55:57] everything for the rest of your life
[56:00] that was going to be
[56:01] perfect for you would you trust me
[56:04] if you knew i knew that would you listen
[56:07] to me
[56:08] would you do what i tell you you
[56:11] probably would if you
[56:12] knew for a fact that i knew everything
[56:16] of your life and exactly what was going
[56:18] to be best for you
[56:19] in your life you'd listen to me if you
[56:22] really believed it
[56:23] now if you don't believe it that's a
[56:24] different story you're not going to
[56:26] listen if you don't believe it but if
[56:27] you truly believed me
[56:30] you would listen well that's the exact
[56:32] same thing that we trusted the lord
[56:35] god knows everything from he knows the
[56:38] end from the beginning he knows
[56:39] everything in between
[56:40] he knows everything about you everything
[56:42] about your life and everything that's
[56:43] going to work
[56:44] perfectly for your good so why don't we
[56:47] listen to him
[56:48] trust him believe him give it to him
[56:51] so that he has the preeminence in us
[56:55] his preeminence is only going to lead us
[56:57] to do what's right
[56:59] according to his word it's only going to
[57:01] lead us to do what's right according to
[57:03] his perfect will
[57:04] it's only going to lead us in a place
[57:06] that's going to be for our betterment
[57:09] sometimes it's hard to understand that
[57:11] it's going to be that way i mean when
[57:13] our when our son died 36.5 hours after
[57:16] he was born
[57:17] it was hard to believe that that was
[57:18] going to lead to something good
[57:20] right but god has it all under control
[57:24] and i promise you more
[57:27] ways than one that is led to be for our
[57:30] good
[57:32] i can't sit here and tell you all about
[57:34] or explain it to you but i have that
[57:35] much confidence in the lord
[57:37] i have that much trust in my life to
[57:39] know that he's the one in charge of it
[57:41] and
[57:41] he's taking control of it and he's the
[57:43] one that i look to and listen to
[57:46] in the preeminence of all things for it
[57:49] please the father then
[57:51] in him should all fullness dwell now we
[57:54] talked about the head of the body
[57:56] we went to the head we've gone to the
[57:58] body we built that body on the
[58:00] foundation
[58:01] now i want to try to finish this
[58:04] uh body foundation off with the
[58:08] the realization who we are
[58:11] and and the part that we play in this
[58:14] because look friend if god's and i'm
[58:17] going to read something to you a little
[58:18] later
[58:19] uh if god's doing something today
[58:22] if god has a plan that he's working out
[58:27] if god has a a finalization
[58:30] of what he's finishing up here with with
[58:33] with the world and with time and
[58:35] with everything that's going on then
[58:37] there's going to be somebody
[58:39] that god's going to work through to
[58:41] accomplish what he's trying to do
[58:44] he's going to have a person he's going
[58:47] to have a people
[58:48] who are willing to submit to him enough
[58:51] to do the plan that god has
[58:53] that he's finishing and we're still here
[58:56] with this world's time of what's going
[58:58] on with the world today and in our lives
[59:00] there's a plan that god is working to
[59:02] finish to reach to a place
[59:04] that the bride goes and raps your
[59:05] tribulation sets in and
[59:07] of course you know the rest there's a
[59:09] plan that's to be finished
[59:11] well who's going to be the ones to do
[59:12] that who's going to be the ones that god
[59:15] is going to work through
[59:17] to finish that full expression that
[59:19] jesus christ is manifesting himself
[59:22] on earth today who's going to be willing
[59:24] to be one of those
[59:25] ones well the bride's going to
[59:29] am i going to be one of them are you
[59:31] going to be one of them
[59:32] i believe i am i trust i do go i do what
[59:36] i can
[59:38] now again if it's something that
[59:43] i've already i've already gone through
[59:45] and laid this foundation in previous
[59:47] services so
[59:48] it may seem like i'm jumping in the
[59:50] middle here but i'm really not
[59:52] based on what we've already brought
[59:54] forth so if
[59:55] if it seems a little difficult or
[59:57] misunderstood or something
[1:00:00] then you can go look at the other
[1:00:02] services or
[1:00:03] ask me or whatever you'd like to do so
[1:00:06] it like i said it may
[1:00:07] seem like we're kind of jumping in the
[1:00:08] middle of this but we're really not
[1:00:10] we're just trying to finish this
[1:00:12] complete this at the end of this so
[1:00:15] first corinthians 12 13. now for by
[1:00:18] one spirit because we we did first
[1:00:20] corinthians 12 the other day
[1:00:21] in this body and who we are as a body
[1:00:24] and we're not just the body of
[1:00:26] in between our four walls we're not just
[1:00:28] a body that's just in our church or
[1:00:30] assembly it's not just a body in tucson
[1:00:32] or
[1:00:32] arizona it's not just a body of united
[1:00:35] states this body
[1:00:36] is inclusive of every people tongue
[1:00:39] kindred and nation
[1:00:40] all around the world we are involved as
[1:00:43] one body
[1:00:44] together this body we're we're
[1:00:48] fitly joined together the bible says
[1:00:51] brother brahm talked about the pyramids
[1:00:52] being put together and each stone
[1:00:55] remember we talked last week about the
[1:00:57] lively stones that we are
[1:00:58] lively stone royal priesthood offering
[1:01:01] spiritual sacrifices those stones
[1:01:03] brother brown talked about
[1:01:04] putting on those pyramids you couldn't
[1:01:06] run a razor blade
[1:01:08] those stones were so finely hewn
[1:01:10] together
[1:01:11] those stones were so finely put together
[1:01:14] you couldn't run a razor blade between
[1:01:15] them and that's the way the body of the
[1:01:17] bride of the believers should be today
[1:01:20] around the world internationally
[1:01:23] no matter where they are we're all a
[1:01:24] part of that same to this body by going
[1:01:26] to a seminary you don't get into this
[1:01:28] body by
[1:01:29] putting your name on the role of a of a
[1:01:31] church you get into this body by one
[1:01:34] holy spirit baptism by one holy spirit
[1:01:39] word baptism we get into this body
[1:01:43] because he tells us by one spirit
[1:01:46] we are all baptized in that one body now
[1:01:49] that we're baptized as we found out
[1:01:51] yesterday that we're baptized means
[1:01:53] immersed
[1:01:54] when you're completely immersed that's
[1:01:57] the whole point this spirit
[1:01:59] immerses you baptizes you
[1:02:02] when that spirit comes and and immerses
[1:02:05] you
[1:02:06] in his spirit just like the day of
[1:02:08] pentecost
[1:02:09] when the bible says it came on them and
[1:02:11] went in them
[1:02:13] there's a new birth that takes place
[1:02:15] that one spirit that
[1:02:17] baptizes us into this body that makes us
[1:02:20] a mini-member
[1:02:21] body now now we as a many member body
[1:02:24] we all as one belong to
[1:02:28] the lord we all belong to jesus we're
[1:02:31] all one in him so if we're in that same
[1:02:34] spirit one spirit not many spirits
[1:02:37] it's not an it's not a baptist spirit
[1:02:39] it's not a presbyterian spirit it's not
[1:02:41] a
[1:02:42] charismatic spirit it's not a calvary
[1:02:43] spirit it's not a word of god tabernacle
[1:02:45] spirit
[1:02:46] it is one spirit the holy spirit god
[1:02:49] almighty come
[1:02:50] in spirit form that one spirit
[1:02:53] has baptized us all into that one body
[1:02:57] if you're one of them we're all baptized
[1:02:59] into that same body
[1:03:00] so we're all part of the same body see
[1:03:03] it doesn't matter what you look like it
[1:03:04] doesn't matter what you sound like no
[1:03:05] matter how old you are doesn't matter
[1:03:07] you're male
[1:03:07] female we're all baptized born into that
[1:03:10] same body
[1:03:11] that new birth that puts us into that
[1:03:13] body
[1:03:14] jesus nicodemus came to jesus at night
[1:03:18] and he was talking and said rabbi we
[1:03:19] know that you're a man sent from god
[1:03:21] and i mean you can imagine as you as i
[1:03:24] paraphrased a little probably jesus is
[1:03:25] probably thinking well
[1:03:26] if you knew who i am and you know i'm
[1:03:28] sin for god then why aren't you doing
[1:03:30] what i told you
[1:03:32] but he had to come by night because he'd
[1:03:33] have been ridiculed if he had gone by
[1:03:35] the ones that had probably kicked him
[1:03:37] out of their uh organization or
[1:03:39] something if they had known nicodemus
[1:03:40] was coming to consult with jesus
[1:03:42] almighty
[1:03:42] you can't do that so it had to come by
[1:03:45] night it had to make it the secret of
[1:03:46] things the nicodemus came
[1:03:48] but jesus just basically told him unless
[1:03:51] you be born again
[1:03:52] you can't even see the kingdom of heaven
[1:03:55] unless you're born again
[1:03:57] well there has to be a holy spirit birth
[1:04:00] that bursts you into that body jesus
[1:04:03] told nicodemus
[1:04:04] you must be born again it's not a it's
[1:04:07] not a maybe
[1:04:08] it it it's not a well if you'd like to
[1:04:12] you must be born again you must be born
[1:04:15] into this body
[1:04:16] we are one spirit in one body
[1:04:20] and the capstone jesus christ the
[1:04:23] all-seeing eye
[1:04:24] is is the head of this body we just read
[1:04:27] the preeminence the head of this body
[1:04:30] you cut my head off i'm done
[1:04:32] you cut jesus out of your life you're
[1:04:34] done that's just the bottom line of it
[1:04:36] he is the head
[1:04:38] right he is the head everything about it
[1:04:40] by one spirit
[1:04:41] now so we're all by that spirit by this
[1:04:44] one body
[1:04:45] baptized immersed we are immersed into
[1:04:49] that
[1:04:50] waters of separation we talked about
[1:04:52] last week that waters of separation
[1:04:55] people want to separate today people
[1:04:57] want to draw separation from him but
[1:04:59] what's drawing separation
[1:05:01] true separation is the belief from the
[1:05:03] unbelief
[1:05:04] amen amen forget about the race the
[1:05:07] creeds the colors the
[1:05:09] the the the religion all it's belief and
[1:05:12] unbelief that's separating today
[1:05:14] and god's doing that separation that
[1:05:16] separation is by the word
[1:05:18] and that waters of separation has come
[1:05:21] to draw the variance
[1:05:22] between you and others that just don't
[1:05:24] believe they may say they believe
[1:05:27] but if they believe they're going to
[1:05:28] obey the word if they're not in
[1:05:30] obedience to the words just like the
[1:05:32] 13 people we baptized yesterday brother
[1:05:35] roger baptized and be an angel helped
[1:05:38] there and
[1:05:39] my back had been bothering me so i
[1:05:40] appreciate brother roger coming and
[1:05:42] uh baptized we baptized 13 people we
[1:05:45] buried him
[1:05:45] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:05:49] because that's the only name whereby man
[1:05:51] can be saved
[1:05:52] is the name of the lord jesus christ any
[1:05:54] of the baptisms is not baptism
[1:05:56] you go on the bible and you look in
[1:05:58] people that actually weren't baptized in
[1:06:00] the name of the lord jesus christ what
[1:06:01] the disciples do
[1:06:03] the disciples told them so you got to
[1:06:04] come get baptized again they had to get
[1:06:06] re-baptized
[1:06:07] they got re-baptized the name of the
[1:06:08] lord jesus christ hands laid on them
[1:06:10] they received the holy ghost
[1:06:12] praise the lord see that's not a
[1:06:14] complicated formula but it's something
[1:06:16] that separates
[1:06:18] it's that waters of separation we talked
[1:06:20] about last week
[1:06:21] that draw separation between belief and
[1:06:24] unbelief
[1:06:25] god has called you god has brought the
[1:06:28] bride
[1:06:29] to a place to where she is a called out
[1:06:31] group of people
[1:06:32] that's why you look different that's why
[1:06:34] you act different that's why you sound
[1:06:36] different
[1:06:36] that's why you don't tell the dirty
[1:06:38] jokes again you don't listen to them
[1:06:40] even
[1:06:41] in certain places you don't go anymore
[1:06:43] things you don't do
[1:06:44] because you are a separate called out
[1:06:47] chosen generation
[1:06:48] royal priesthood because by one spirit
[1:06:53] his spirit we've been baptized into that
[1:06:55] body
[1:06:56] we belong to him now we don't belong to
[1:06:58] ourselves
[1:07:00] you saw him i said well i was sure like
[1:07:01] the uh the old mute would have liked to
[1:07:03] have done that or the old mute would
[1:07:05] have done this or something let's see
[1:07:07] he's dead though see the old mutant
[1:07:09] can't do anything because he's dead
[1:07:12] he no longer exists when you're baptized
[1:07:16] when you're or when you're
[1:07:17] buried in the name of the lord and god
[1:07:19] fills you with his spirits you become a
[1:07:21] new creation
[1:07:23] that we're joined together into that one
[1:07:25] body by that baptism
[1:07:27] immersed into that uh into that waters
[1:07:30] of separation
[1:07:32] what does that do though it brings us by
[1:07:35] to the point of of the word of god
[1:07:39] uh in saint john let's go to saint john
[1:07:42] chapter 1.
[1:07:46] i'm trying to bring us to this point
[1:07:48] saint john chapter 1.
[1:07:50] i want to begin reading with with verse
[1:07:52] 12.
[1:07:55] we'll just begin with verse 11. saint
[1:07:57] john chapter 1
[1:07:59] verse 11
[1:08:02] and remember thinking on
[1:08:06] what we just read in first corinthians
[1:08:10] by one spirit we're baptized into that
[1:08:13] body
[1:08:14] we're all a part of that same mystical
[1:08:16] body of jesus christ
[1:08:18] remembering and thinking what god has
[1:08:20] had told nicodemus that you must be born
[1:08:23] again
[1:08:24] what god has done for us to bring us to
[1:08:27] the point that we can have the
[1:08:28] ability the desire to even do it right
[1:08:33] for uh saint john chapter 1 verse 11.
[1:08:36] let's look here now he came to his own
[1:08:39] and his own received him not but as many
[1:08:43] as received him
[1:08:45] to them gave he power or authority
[1:08:50] to become the sons of god
[1:08:54] even to them that believe on his name
[1:08:58] which were born which were born not of
[1:09:00] blood
[1:09:02] nor the will of the flesh it doesn't
[1:09:04] come by man didn't come by a woman
[1:09:06] doesn't come by procreation of man and
[1:09:08] woman
[1:09:09] didn't come by blood or the will of
[1:09:11] flesh the will of man
[1:09:12] but of god we're here because of
[1:09:17] god and the word was made flesh and
[1:09:20] dwelt among us
[1:09:21] and he was the and he was and we beheld
[1:09:24] his glory as the glory of the only
[1:09:25] begotten of the father full of
[1:09:27] grace and truth now what did he do
[1:09:30] in this that jesus did for us what was
[1:09:33] the purpose
[1:09:34] what did he do in being able to come
[1:09:37] forth with a new birth
[1:09:39] baptism nicodemus didn't understand it
[1:09:42] he said how could i go into enter into
[1:09:44] my mother's womb the second time
[1:09:46] had nothing to do with his mother's womb
[1:09:48] had everything to do with the
[1:09:49] wound the mind of god where he was from
[1:09:52] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:55] that's what it had to do with not his
[1:09:56] mother's womb but the womb of god the
[1:09:58] mind of god
[1:10:00] that's where he was to begin with well
[1:10:01] if you were a part of god
[1:10:03] maybe nicodemus wasn't but if you're a
[1:10:05] part of god
[1:10:07] that's where you were that's where that
[1:10:08] birth is that's what jesus talked about
[1:10:11] here now as as you have received him
[1:10:15] has been he's received him not just
[1:10:17] believed
[1:10:18] amen now people we talk about faith and
[1:10:21] believing that's all true
[1:10:23] absolutely but don't you know that the
[1:10:26] devil believes
[1:10:28] the devil believes too well sure he does
[1:10:31] he's been whooped enough by god
[1:10:33] he he knows very well he knows who god
[1:10:36] is he knows who jesus was
[1:10:40] he believes but the bible says to them
[1:10:44] that receive
[1:10:45] him now see that's something he didn't
[1:10:47] do
[1:10:49] to receive the word is to receive christ
[1:10:52] not to receive dogma not to receive
[1:10:54] denomination or
[1:10:55] some man's thought but idea but to
[1:10:58] receive the word
[1:11:00] to receive the word is to receive christ
[1:11:04] and to receive christ god give you
[1:11:07] the power amen god give you
[1:11:10] the power the authority to become a son
[1:11:14] of god
[1:11:14] amen my friend have you ever thought
[1:11:17] about how
[1:11:18] powerful that is that we as ranked
[1:11:21] sinners
[1:11:21] humans come into this world speaking
[1:11:24] lies
[1:11:25] sinners had no hope headed to hell that
[1:11:28] god would give us the power
[1:11:30] the authority to become a son of god
[1:11:34] amen no wonder we ought to offer him
[1:11:37] all of the preeminence in our lives he
[1:11:40] gave us the power
[1:11:42] to become sons of god see when you come
[1:11:45] forth in a natural birth
[1:11:46] there was no power there was no control
[1:11:50] and there was no discussion from you
[1:11:52] about it
[1:11:54] did your parents discuss with you before
[1:11:56] you were born
[1:11:57] whether they would want you to be born
[1:11:59] or not or whether
[1:12:01] you would want to be born i know we
[1:12:03] didn't discuss it with our children
[1:12:06] kind of been tough what to discuss with
[1:12:08] your children before they were born
[1:12:10] whether they would want to be born i
[1:12:13] know that sounds kind of ludicrous but
[1:12:15] you know there's a guy in
[1:12:16] india who sued his parents
[1:12:19] for being born i never asked to be born
[1:12:23] i never wanted to be born and he sued
[1:12:26] his parents
[1:12:27] because he was born they never asked me
[1:12:31] how crazy ludicrous the world has gotten
[1:12:34] to be
[1:12:35] but the fact of the matter is it's it
[1:12:38] it's it's not about that amen
[1:12:41] god give us the power to become sons and
[1:12:45] daughters of god
[1:12:46] now it's our choice it's our decision
[1:12:50] we have to make that decision am i going
[1:12:53] to be a son or daughter of god do i want
[1:12:56] god jesus christ to have full
[1:12:58] preeminence
[1:12:59] and control of my life do i trust and
[1:13:02] believe him enough
[1:13:04] to know that he knows everything about
[1:13:06] my life and
[1:13:07] now and in the future for me to put my
[1:13:10] life
[1:13:10] in his hands is he gonna ask me to do
[1:13:14] something that i don't want to do
[1:13:16] he might that's true in fact there's a
[1:13:19] very good
[1:13:20] possibility that god will ask you to do
[1:13:22] something you don't want to do
[1:13:25] i know he has me many many times
[1:13:29] but when you do it when you obey that
[1:13:32] voice
[1:13:32] and when you do it god tells you oh it's
[1:13:35] it
[1:13:36] there's nothing in the world like it you
[1:13:38] see the hand of god moving left and
[1:13:40] right what god's bringing together and
[1:13:42] and the purpose and the will of god and
[1:13:44] how it manifests itself
[1:13:46] i'll tell you friend that's exactly how
[1:13:47] we're here this morning in this building
[1:13:49] that's right
[1:13:50] it's exactly by that way that was
[1:13:53] god doing that god did this
[1:13:57] out of nowhere god did it
[1:14:00] me and brother rogers looking all over
[1:14:02] the place searching the internet
[1:14:04] daily looking everywhere asking people
[1:14:07] we know
[1:14:08] driving by places
[1:14:11] and all we had to do is have one person
[1:14:13] see his craigslist ad
[1:14:16] and call for some electrical work who
[1:14:18] happened to be a brother and sister that
[1:14:20] was at the tabernacle that i knew
[1:14:22] you might know them too to call him up
[1:14:25] for us to do some electrical work
[1:14:27] to find out he had the building
[1:14:31] sounds pretty simple doesn't it amen
[1:14:34] that doesn't mean you just sit down and
[1:14:36] do nothing of course and
[1:14:37] you know but when god brings it about
[1:14:40] and when god does it it works perfect
[1:14:43] it works out exactly the way he wants it
[1:14:45] to be he puts it in exactly place the
[1:14:48] exact place he wants it to be
[1:14:49] and it works together for our god that's
[1:14:52] how god does
[1:14:53] it god give us the power see when you're
[1:14:56] born naturally
[1:14:57] you had no power you had no consultation
[1:15:00] you had
[1:15:01] uh you had no choice you were just born
[1:15:05] but now with this new birth with this
[1:15:07] spiritual birth you have choice and you
[1:15:09] have power
[1:15:10] you have authority to become sons of god
[1:15:13] because god
[1:15:14] gave us that spiritual birth
[1:15:18] to become a new creation to to be born
[1:15:21] into the body of god
[1:15:23] you have a choice you have the power
[1:15:26] because god's given to us to be able to
[1:15:29] become
[1:15:30] sons of god we're not born of blood
[1:15:33] we're not born in the will of flesh or
[1:15:35] the will of man
[1:15:37] but that birth is of god the other was
[1:15:40] all man
[1:15:42] all that was just about man but this was
[1:15:44] god this is by the will of god
[1:15:46] that's your birth into the kingdom of
[1:15:48] god
[1:15:50] so how we don't give him the preeminence
[1:15:52] in our lives see
[1:15:54] because that last birth is a word verse
[1:15:58] that last verse are you with me that
[1:16:00] last birth is a word birth
[1:16:02] it's not a human birth it's not a
[1:16:04] fleshly bird
[1:16:05] we're still here we're still in this
[1:16:07] shell you know i still go by the name
[1:16:10] newton even though i'm not
[1:16:11] newton's actually dead i still go by
[1:16:13] that name well
[1:16:14] sometimes sometimes people call me
[1:16:15] george but anyway
[1:16:17] i uh because that's my other name but i
[1:16:20] i go by the same name
[1:16:22] i look a lot like i did when i was
[1:16:24] younger
[1:16:26] but the man inside the person who you
[1:16:29] really are
[1:16:30] changes you're a different person
[1:16:34] it's a word birth it's a word birth in
[1:16:37] the in
[1:16:37] in the point that you are born of
[1:16:40] we were born before of corruptible seed
[1:16:44] but this spiritual birth was of
[1:16:46] incorruptible seed
[1:16:48] uh first peter chapter three
[1:16:52] uh if you want to turn there real quick
[1:16:53] it's up to you if you'd like to i'm
[1:16:55] gonna
[1:16:55] look it's uh chapter one excuse me first
[1:16:57] peter chapter one
[1:16:59] uh just one verse here 23rd verse
[1:17:04] first peter 1 23
[1:17:13] being born again has to do
[1:17:16] over again it says being born again
[1:17:20] but for us and it's not really born
[1:17:22] again it really is
[1:17:23] the understanding that
[1:17:26] it has to come into human understanding
[1:17:30] to come into human understanding you say
[1:17:32] well you have to be born
[1:17:34] well i am born so to put it in human
[1:17:37] understanding
[1:17:39] you say born again i'm not born again or
[1:17:42] born
[1:17:42] over again i'm just born a new i'm a new
[1:17:46] creature in christ
[1:17:48] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:17:50] which was our first birth
[1:17:53] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[1:17:56] which
[1:17:57] liveth and abideth forever so this is a
[1:18:00] word birth we are born of incorruptible
[1:18:04] seed
[1:18:05] by the word of god so the
[1:18:08] so the product that comes forth even
[1:18:11] though it may
[1:18:12] look the same and the hair and
[1:18:14] everything although there's more gray
[1:18:15] and more wrinkles and whatever else
[1:18:17] is still the shell is still the same
[1:18:20] but you understand it's not that that
[1:18:23] that's the focus that god's looking at
[1:18:25] yes sure all that's the same but this is
[1:18:28] a word birth
[1:18:31] what has changed is that you are no
[1:18:33] longer
[1:18:34] the person you used to be as far as
[1:18:39] living by your own dictates and will
[1:18:42] and purpose this new birth
[1:18:45] word birth means that this incorruptible
[1:18:48] seed which is the word
[1:18:50] this incorruptible seed now has taken
[1:18:53] the residence
[1:18:54] in your soul and you now
[1:18:57] belong to christ
[1:19:00] not yourself but you belong to christ
[1:19:03] now this incorruptible seed
[1:19:07] is the seed of god the word of god
[1:19:12] the word birth that we now birth our
[1:19:15] that that we are birthed into by the
[1:19:18] word of god
[1:19:20] we're no longer ourself we're birthed in
[1:19:22] the word
[1:19:24] so if we came from an incorruptible seed
[1:19:27] there's only one incorruptible seed
[1:19:29] that's god's seed
[1:19:31] god sees the only one it's incorruptible
[1:19:33] so if we're born of god
[1:19:35] by the seed of god which first john
[1:19:38] 3 tells us by the seed of god the seed
[1:19:41] remains in you
[1:19:42] then what does that bring you into life
[1:19:45] of being
[1:19:47] if you have been born again of the
[1:19:49] incorruptable seed
[1:19:50] by the word of god a word birth what
[1:19:53] does that make you
[1:19:56] you are born again from the seed of god
[1:20:01] a new from the seed of god
[1:20:06] if you're born from my seed then you're
[1:20:09] born from the seed of newton that's
[1:20:10] corruptible
[1:20:12] if you're born of the seed of god that's
[1:20:15] god's seed
[1:20:16] that's incorruptible god's incorruptable
[1:20:20] seed
[1:20:21] makes you what you are
[1:20:25] paul said in romans which came from
[1:20:27] david
[1:20:29] is blessed is the man to whom god will
[1:20:31] not impute sin
[1:20:33] i know i've said that quite a bit but i
[1:20:35] just i really like that scripture
[1:20:37] blessed is the man to whom god will not
[1:20:40] impute sin
[1:20:42] well who is that man that man is the man
[1:20:45] who's born that purpose man
[1:20:46] humanity not just a male that is born of
[1:20:50] an
[1:20:50] incorruptible seed that is born a word
[1:20:53] birth which has no corruption from god
[1:20:57] himself
[1:20:58] see amen
[1:21:02] if we can't see that's who we are friend
[1:21:05] look
[1:21:06] that that's what god has made us that's
[1:21:09] where god has brought us to
[1:21:11] speaking of first john 3 let me read
[1:21:13] this first john 3
[1:21:16] verse 1. behold what manner of love the
[1:21:19] father has bestowed upon us now think
[1:21:22] about this
[1:21:23] this is emanating from his love this is
[1:21:25] coming forth from the love of god
[1:21:28] so when things happen you don't
[1:21:30] understand it's coming from the love of
[1:21:32] god
[1:21:33] it's not coming because god hates you
[1:21:36] it's because god loves you
[1:21:38] and he knows what's best for us the old
[1:21:40] what manner of love the father has
[1:21:42] bestowed upon us
[1:21:43] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:21:45] now he gave us the power
[1:21:47] to become sons of god now blessed is he
[1:21:50] to whom god
[1:21:51] uh that that we should be called the
[1:21:54] sons of god therefore the word
[1:21:56] the world knoweth us not because it do
[1:21:58] him not beloved now are we the sons of
[1:22:00] god
[1:22:01] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:22:03] but we know that we
[1:22:04] he shall appear we shall be like him for
[1:22:07] we shall see him as he is
[1:22:09] well how is he
[1:22:12] we've seen him and how is he they said
[1:22:15] it's john here says it does not appear
[1:22:18] what we shall
[1:22:19] be but we know that when we will see
[1:22:23] him when he shall appear we will be like
[1:22:26] him
[1:22:27] well what is he we know the appearance
[1:22:31] has come we know that
[1:22:32] god that revelation 10 7 has been
[1:22:35] fulfilled and
[1:22:36] and the mystery of god has been finished
[1:22:40] if the mystery of god the understanding
[1:22:42] of that foundation jesus christ
[1:22:44] who he is the revelation of christ and
[1:22:46] who he is then who is he
[1:22:49] when we look at christ what do we see
[1:22:53] do we just see a man a lot of churches
[1:22:56] just see the second person of a trinity
[1:22:59] that's all they see some people look at
[1:23:01] him and they just see why he was a good
[1:23:03] man
[1:23:04] some people that are out the corrupt
[1:23:05] world look and see
[1:23:07] they consider him a deceiver
[1:23:11] what do you see when you see jesus what
[1:23:13] is he
[1:23:15] it says when he appears or manifests
[1:23:18] himself
[1:23:18] we shall be like him what is he
[1:23:24] he is the word christ is the word
[1:23:29] and if we are to be like him
[1:23:33] then what is that place the bride asks
[1:23:37] that makes her the word right she's a
[1:23:40] word
[1:23:41] bride because she's born
[1:23:44] of incorruptible seed she's born
[1:23:48] a word birth so of course if she
[1:23:52] come out of christ like the quote i read
[1:23:55] last week
[1:23:56] if she come out of christ then what is
[1:23:59] and he's the word
[1:24:00] and we're a part of him and we are to be
[1:24:03] like him
[1:24:04] what does that make us
[1:24:07] that makes the bride the word
[1:24:10] because she's had that incorruptible
[1:24:13] birth
[1:24:14] of the incorruptible seed and we have
[1:24:17] seen him
[1:24:18] we know him we better
[1:24:22] our relationship better we better have a
[1:24:24] relationship with jesus christ
[1:24:26] amen we better have one
[1:24:32] yeah we've seen him we know who he is
[1:24:35] we know him as the word amen
[1:24:39] we know him as the word if we come from
[1:24:42] him
[1:24:43] then what does that make us praise the
[1:24:46] lord
[1:24:47] he is the word we are like him
[1:24:51] that's not that that's not a doing that
[1:24:53] we did of our own accord
[1:24:55] right that's what god has done for us
[1:24:59] that's the purpose god has called us to
[1:25:02] how are
[1:25:03] how is this bride going to ever be the
[1:25:06] full expression
[1:25:07] of jesus christ on earth today unless
[1:25:11] she
[1:25:11] is like him how is she
[1:25:15] ever going to complete the work that god
[1:25:18] has put in your life
[1:25:20] if we are not obedient and he has the
[1:25:23] preeminence in our lives
[1:25:26] how is it ever going to get done how is
[1:25:28] it ever going to get finished
[1:25:31] it can't but promise you
[1:25:35] whether it's you me or all of us god's
[1:25:38] going to have
[1:25:38] somebody that he has the full
[1:25:41] preeminence in and will work through
[1:25:44] amen there's going to be a people that's
[1:25:47] going to finish this work
[1:25:49] amen i i i pray we have a little more
[1:25:53] time
[1:25:53] that the lord give us to do that uh if
[1:25:56] not then
[1:25:57] then we're ready to go home uh i think
[1:26:00] uh the next
[1:26:01] less than 60 days will probably dictate
[1:26:03] a lot of that but
[1:26:04] anyway that's i'm not getting into
[1:26:05] politics would probably dictate a lot of
[1:26:08] that but
[1:26:09] i hope we have a little more time maybe
[1:26:10] we do we'll see but we take
[1:26:13] opportunity of every bit of time that we
[1:26:16] have
[1:26:17] because he has the preeminence in us
[1:26:20] if it's not us who's it going to be if
[1:26:22] it's not let's just say us i don't mean
[1:26:24] us here i mean the bride
[1:26:26] who's it going to be she come from him
[1:26:30] she's a incorruptable seed she is a word
[1:26:33] body bride
[1:26:36] then who then who's going to do it
[1:26:39] the full expression oh we're getting to
[1:26:42] it let me get a couple other scriptures
[1:26:44] in here
[1:26:44] um we'll try to wind this up
[1:26:48] philippians chapter 2
[1:26:51] philippians chapter 2 we'll begin with
[1:26:53] verse 1.
[1:27:03] philippians 2 1
[1:27:08] i read this a couple of services to go
[1:27:09] and i told you we'd come back to this
[1:27:13] because i want to hit one specific point
[1:27:17] maybe two we'll just see but one
[1:27:20] specific point in here
[1:27:22] philippians 2 1 if there be therefore
[1:27:24] any consolation in christ
[1:27:27] if any comfort of love if any fellowship
[1:27:30] of the spirit if
[1:27:31] any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy
[1:27:34] that ye be like-minded
[1:27:35] having the same love being of one accord
[1:27:37] of one mind one
[1:27:39] court one mind one body let nothing be
[1:27:42] done through strife or vain glory but in
[1:27:44] lowliness of mind let us
[1:27:46] each esteem other better than themselves
[1:27:48] in humility
[1:27:50] right we put others before ourselves in
[1:27:52] humility
[1:27:54] take the lower seat look not every man
[1:27:57] on his own things but every man also on
[1:27:59] the things of others let this mind
[1:28:01] be in you which was also
[1:28:04] in christ jesus what is that mind
[1:28:08] the mind that was to be in you that was
[1:28:10] also in christ
[1:28:11] jesus is what led christ to do
[1:28:14] the things and live the life that he
[1:28:15] lived if you have the mind of christ it
[1:28:18] caused you
[1:28:19] to do and live and act like he did
[1:28:23] you already see the little bracelets and
[1:28:24] stuff people had for a long time wwjd
[1:28:27] what would jesus do
[1:28:28] you know i mean you don't have to wear
[1:28:29] one of those to show you're a christian
[1:28:31] your life should show that but
[1:28:32] it's kind of profound people say well
[1:28:34] what would jesus do in that situation
[1:28:36] well how would you know what jesus would
[1:28:38] do in any given situation
[1:28:39] if you don't know what the bible says if
[1:28:43] you only know what some minister or some
[1:28:45] church or something's telling you how do
[1:28:47] you know what the bible says unless you
[1:28:49] know it for yourself
[1:28:50] how do you know what jesus would do
[1:28:52] unless you know who jesus
[1:28:54] is right unless you have a personal
[1:28:56] revelation
[1:28:57] relationship with him yourself how would
[1:28:59] you know what he would do
[1:29:02] there's some situations come up in my
[1:29:04] life in my wife's life
[1:29:06] i don't even know what she would do
[1:29:08] sometimes
[1:29:09] i've lived with her for 35 years
[1:29:12] there's some things come up i don't even
[1:29:14] know what she would do
[1:29:16] but how do we know what jesus would do
[1:29:19] because of what he's already done
[1:29:21] because of who he is if we're
[1:29:23] like-minded to christ
[1:29:25] then that means that we're going to be
[1:29:28] able to yes
[1:29:29] even in our bodies even in our flesh try
[1:29:32] to
[1:29:33] work on our best to fulfill
[1:29:36] the manifestation the purpose that god
[1:29:39] has us here for
[1:29:41] the work that god is finishing god is
[1:29:44] completing this
[1:29:46] we have that part to play in bringing
[1:29:49] this to a finish
[1:29:50] they're bringing this to a close i hear
[1:29:53] people all the time talk about rapture
[1:29:55] rapture rapture and i preach on it many
[1:29:57] times
[1:29:58] and we're as a body of believers as a
[1:30:00] bride
[1:30:01] i i i could not express to you with
[1:30:04] human tongue
[1:30:05] how much happiness and joy it would give
[1:30:06] me you see my mom my dad my sister my
[1:30:09] brother my son
[1:30:10] sitting right there right now
[1:30:14] that i can actually visibly see them
[1:30:16] right
[1:30:18] but we still have work to do there's
[1:30:21] still a purpose god has
[1:30:23] us here for if god has us here for that
[1:30:26] he's given see what i'm trying to read
[1:30:28] to you and get to you is the point that
[1:30:30] god has given us the ability and the
[1:30:32] power to be able to do it
[1:30:35] so many times i see people get weak in
[1:30:38] their faith and they get weak in their
[1:30:40] that their their faith of who they are
[1:30:42] in christ and who god has made them
[1:30:45] and then you know friend once you once
[1:30:47] you lose that
[1:30:48] sight of what god has done for you and
[1:30:50] who you are in him
[1:30:51] the devil could just plow right over you
[1:30:54] because you don't know who you are you
[1:30:56] don't know where you're standing
[1:30:58] you don't know what god has done for you
[1:31:00] and where you're placed in that body
[1:31:02] and who we are in him
[1:31:05] and devil just run right slap over
[1:31:07] people because they just don't know they
[1:31:09] just
[1:31:09] they they just get so beat down with
[1:31:11] their faith but i'm trying to help us
[1:31:13] see here now
[1:31:14] what god has called us to and who we are
[1:31:16] in him
[1:31:19] this point this purpose god would not
[1:31:20] have done it if he didn't know that we
[1:31:22] could do it that we can fulfill it
[1:31:24] and again i keep saying the word we and
[1:31:27] it
[1:31:27] you know i don't want to get to the
[1:31:29] understanding that i mean just we
[1:31:31] i mean this body internationally around
[1:31:34] the world
[1:31:38] god wouldn't put us in this position if
[1:31:40] he didn't know we could do it
[1:31:42] but there had to be things that god had
[1:31:44] to set in place even in the old
[1:31:46] testament
[1:31:48] through the new testament what god did
[1:31:50] and jesus did at calvary
[1:31:52] where we are today the prophet the
[1:31:54] message
[1:31:55] what it's brought us to friend the
[1:31:57] revealing and the understanding of who
[1:31:59] jesus christ really is today
[1:32:02] who he's always been
[1:32:05] it can help us it is what we need to
[1:32:08] bring us to the point of that
[1:32:09] understanding
[1:32:10] so when paul says to the philippians let
[1:32:12] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:32:14] christ jesus
[1:32:15] it's not just a statement it's not just
[1:32:17] a a a platitude or
[1:32:20] or advice it's something he's trying to
[1:32:23] get a people to
[1:32:25] that that we're all trying to strive to
[1:32:28] get to
[1:32:29] that that mind is going to lead you into
[1:32:31] doing the things
[1:32:32] here on this earth as a representative
[1:32:34] of christ that he would do if he was
[1:32:36] here in bodily form himself
[1:32:40] but he's doing it through you
[1:32:43] when jesus when god went to abraham
[1:32:47] when god went to abraham and he talked
[1:32:50] to abraham
[1:32:51] he told according to the scripture of
[1:32:55] genesis 18 i believe it is he said i
[1:32:58] will now go and see if sodom is all
[1:33:02] together as wicked as
[1:33:03] has been said well the one that stood
[1:33:08] there that abraham called lord elohim
[1:33:12] did he go to sodom
[1:33:16] he stayed right there with abraham who
[1:33:18] went
[1:33:19] the two angels that was with him well
[1:33:22] with the two ages
[1:33:23] with him does that mean god lied he was
[1:33:25] gonna go but he didn't go
[1:33:28] of course not he went he went in his
[1:33:32] representatives
[1:33:34] brother man him michael and gabriel
[1:33:36] whatever you want to say you know
[1:33:37] blow dust out and have them step they
[1:33:40] went
[1:33:41] well when they went it was as good as
[1:33:43] god had went
[1:33:46] has anything changed
[1:33:49] god does the same thing today as he did
[1:33:51] dinner he would be god
[1:33:53] when god says i will or i have or
[1:33:56] he may be talking about you he may be
[1:33:59] talking about me
[1:34:01] when he says i will well what he means
[1:34:03] is newton's going to
[1:34:06] as his representative and god has given
[1:34:08] us the power to be able to do that
[1:34:12] let this mind be in you that mind is
[1:34:14] going to lead you and guide you into all
[1:34:16] truth
[1:34:18] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:34:20] in christ jesus what else did it do
[1:34:23] who being in the form of god we talked
[1:34:26] about that form
[1:34:27] notice that word therefore means in
[1:34:29] morpha or
[1:34:30] changing of mask as you would in a play
[1:34:34] if you will one person can play two or
[1:34:35] three different parts by changing their
[1:34:37] mask
[1:34:39] they'll play and do be this part and
[1:34:40] then they'll go back and they'll change
[1:34:42] their
[1:34:42] costume or something they'll come out
[1:34:44] and play another part well that's what
[1:34:46] form means that's what morpha is people
[1:34:48] want to make him
[1:34:49] the second person of a trinity no
[1:34:53] god changing his mask in the form
[1:34:56] of god and morpha thought it not robbery
[1:34:59] to be equal with god
[1:35:01] but made himself of no reputation now
[1:35:04] look what it'll do for you
[1:35:06] amen he said what are you talking about
[1:35:07] jesus well who came from him
[1:35:11] who has the mind of god if you have the
[1:35:13] mind of christ
[1:35:15] oh i'm talking to us it's real friend we
[1:35:18] have the mind of christ
[1:35:20] we have the mind of christ like the word
[1:35:21] says here and he says he thought about
[1:35:23] robert to be equal with god
[1:35:25] who made himself of no reputation
[1:35:29] so what will the bride do
[1:35:32] she'll be like-minded she'll make
[1:35:34] herself of no reputation
[1:35:36] took upon him the form of a servant so
[1:35:39] what would the bride do
[1:35:41] she will put on the cloak of servant
[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:44] not serving as jews but servant as
[1:35:48] fulfilling the purpose and will of god
[1:35:51] and was made in the likeness of men
[1:35:53] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:35:54] humbled himself became obedient unto
[1:35:56] death even the death of the cross
[1:35:59] but if he was in the form of god
[1:36:02] now don't don't want to lose you and
[1:36:04] then but i want us to understand
[1:36:06] something
[1:36:07] if being in the form of god as jesus
[1:36:11] the bible says jesus was in the form of
[1:36:14] god he morphing himself
[1:36:15] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:36:17] god what does that mean
[1:36:20] robbery simply means that somebody took
[1:36:22] something from you
[1:36:24] if somebody took something from you that
[1:36:26] means they're taking or robbing or
[1:36:29] stealing
[1:36:30] away from you well what he's saying is
[1:36:33] here that
[1:36:34] he thought it not robbery it didn't take
[1:36:36] anything from god
[1:36:38] for who jesus christ was filled in flesh
[1:36:42] if you are in the form of god if you are
[1:36:45] in the like-mindeness of god
[1:36:46] if you are born of the incorruptible
[1:36:48] seed of god if you are a word birth
[1:36:51] spiritual birth
[1:36:52] into this body is that robbing from god
[1:36:56] that's exactly what god's calling this
[1:36:58] bride to be today
[1:37:01] not robbery it's not taking from god
[1:37:05] actually if we're here we're doing the
[1:37:07] purpose and that god has called us to
[1:37:10] that's adding to god that's exactly what
[1:37:13] god wants us to be that's exactly what
[1:37:15] god
[1:37:16] called us to be it's not robbing from
[1:37:19] god
[1:37:20] it's adding to god if you say adding to
[1:37:23] this probably
[1:37:24] probably not a correct word to put
[1:37:26] because you can't add to god he's
[1:37:28] perfect but you know what i'm saying
[1:37:30] i don't mean actually literally adding
[1:37:32] something to god but it's enhancing who
[1:37:34] he is
[1:37:35] by fulfilling the purpose that god's put
[1:37:37] us here for it's not robbery
[1:37:40] knowing who you are in jesus christ this
[1:37:43] word is not
[1:37:44] taking from god you're not taking
[1:37:47] anything from
[1:37:48] him it's it's it's an enhancement
[1:37:52] look in second corinth and uh
[1:37:55] uh excuse me colossians chapter two
[1:37:59] colossians chapter two i'm just going to
[1:38:01] read it's getting a little late in time
[1:38:03] but
[1:38:05] so let me finish this colossians chapter
[1:38:07] 2 verse 9 and 10.
[1:38:10] for in him jesus dwelleth all the
[1:38:14] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:38:16] in jesus dwelt all the fullness
[1:38:20] not partly not some
[1:38:24] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:38:27] and ye
[1:38:38] you are complete in him which is the
[1:38:41] head of all principality and power
[1:38:44] you are completed him all the fullness
[1:38:46] of the godhead bodily dwelt in jesus
[1:38:49] and you are complete in him you know
[1:38:52] in the greek the word fullness and the
[1:38:55] word
[1:38:56] complete are the same
[1:38:59] so when the bible says that in christ
[1:39:02] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:39:05] was dwelled
[1:39:06] and you are complete or full
[1:39:10] in him you know what means the exact
[1:39:12] same thing
[1:39:14] according to the greek exact same word
[1:39:17] why
[1:39:17] put it in two different ways i'm not
[1:39:19] sure fullness and complete
[1:39:22] full fullness means of filling up
[1:39:24] complete means you're full
[1:39:26] if all the fullness completeness was in
[1:39:29] christ and you
[1:39:30] are complete in him
[1:39:34] oh i hope that helps us understand
[1:39:37] to be full let's look at this to be full
[1:39:42] causes one to abound
[1:39:45] and to fill to the brim
[1:39:49] to complete plea to complete to be full
[1:39:53] is to fill to the brim
[1:39:56] anybody knows the brand's the top of the
[1:39:58] glass you put any more in that it just
[1:40:00] floods over
[1:40:01] full to the brim and cause to abound
[1:40:05] amen you are complete in him
[1:40:09] it's just i it is beautiful to me
[1:40:13] god has completed me in a in
[1:40:16] in causing your life in the completeness
[1:40:20] of christ
[1:40:21] to abound in him not just exist
[1:40:24] right not just get along but abound
[1:40:29] does that mean you're going to be a
[1:40:30] millionaire no not necessarily
[1:40:32] mean you're going to have houses and
[1:40:34] cars and lands and
[1:40:35] be rich and wealthy and whatever no no
[1:40:37] no that's not always that's what that
[1:40:39] means you know you
[1:40:40] are you never ever going to get sick in
[1:40:42] your body no that's not what that means
[1:40:44] it's not what he's saying but you're
[1:40:46] going to abound in everything you do
[1:40:49] for christ because he he has made us
[1:40:52] complete
[1:40:55] complete in him
[1:40:58] and the completeness okay
[1:41:01] the completeness is the fullness
[1:41:04] of the godhead bodily
[1:41:08] what is god at the godhead is the state
[1:41:10] of being god
[1:41:12] that's what the godhead is you go look
[1:41:14] it up
[1:41:15] the godhead the word godhead is is
[1:41:18] is the state of of god of being god
[1:41:23] bodily just means in a bodily form or in
[1:41:26] a corporal body
[1:41:28] so in hebrews fullness of the godhead
[1:41:31] in his corporal being the fullness of
[1:41:34] god in his bodily form
[1:41:36] was in existence because jesus was here
[1:41:42] and people want to make him a second
[1:41:43] person or a third person or
[1:41:45] some kind of some of a lower state well
[1:41:47] the father's up here
[1:41:49] and and and the son and the holy spirit
[1:41:52] are down here
[1:41:53] oh friend come on now there's
[1:41:56] there's a revelation this church is
[1:41:58] built upon and i promise you it's not
[1:42:00] that amen
[1:42:03] the fullness of the godhead bodily the
[1:42:06] fullness
[1:42:07] of the state of being god in bodily
[1:42:10] form was standing there
[1:42:14] in the body of jesus christ where one
[1:42:17] day
[1:42:18] all that wholeness was fullness was
[1:42:20] poured into one man
[1:42:21] one body when jesus left
[1:42:24] and came back and poured out the first
[1:42:27] pouring of the day of pentecost on those
[1:42:29] 120.
[1:42:30] now millions i don't know billions maybe
[1:42:33] since then i don't know
[1:42:35] have been had been poured upon
[1:42:39] that that paul is talking to the
[1:42:42] corinthian church
[1:42:43] by one spiritual baptized into this body
[1:42:47] since that time that spirit has come
[1:42:50] into
[1:42:51] in a many member bodies in the
[1:42:55] fullness of the god-head bottle you say
[1:42:58] well all of god was in christ yes
[1:43:00] that's the truth you know brother brown
[1:43:03] talked about the spoonful
[1:43:04] you know everything that's in this
[1:43:06] everything that's in the bodies in the
[1:43:08] spoonful i'm just trying to help
[1:43:10] see we are completing him
[1:43:15] we are the complete representation of
[1:43:18] the state of being god in a bodily form
[1:43:22] god help us i we
[1:43:26] we can't do it on our own god help us
[1:43:29] god bring faith to understand
[1:43:34] that the only way that i'm able to do
[1:43:36] this is by the lord's preeminence in my
[1:43:39] life
[1:43:40] the only way to become or be or show
[1:43:43] forth the full expression of jesus this
[1:43:45] last day
[1:43:46] is for him to have preeminence in our
[1:43:48] lives
[1:43:50] amen the full expression
[1:43:53] i love that full expression
[1:43:57] let me read these couple other
[1:43:59] scriptures i'm going to close here
[1:44:01] ephesians chapter one i want to bring
[1:44:03] ephesians chapter one and romans 8
[1:44:05] together here
[1:44:06] and then we'll close
[1:44:10] ephesians chapter 1 verse
[1:44:13] 13 in whom he also
[1:44:16] trusted after that he heard the word of
[1:44:18] truth the gospel of your salvation in
[1:44:20] whom and
[1:44:21] also after that ye believed you were
[1:44:23] sealed
[1:44:24] with the holy spirit of promise sealed
[1:44:27] with the holy spirit after you believed
[1:44:30] of promise which is the earnest or the
[1:44:33] down payment of our inheritance
[1:44:36] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:44:38] possession
[1:44:39] unto the praise of his glory and what is
[1:44:41] that redemption well first of all what
[1:44:43] is the purchased possession
[1:44:47] i am i was bought with a price
[1:44:51] paul said he was bought with a price
[1:44:54] we are bought with a price if you're
[1:44:57] part of this body you're bought with a
[1:44:58] price on what's the purchase possession
[1:45:01] we are what's the full redemption
[1:45:05] of that purchased possession well the
[1:45:08] full
[1:45:08] complete redemption of it is going to be
[1:45:11] when god changes these vile bodies and
[1:45:13] we go into rapture
[1:45:15] the redemption of our soul has already
[1:45:18] taken place
[1:45:20] so that we could manifest jesus christ
[1:45:23] on earth so that we could become
[1:45:25] that full expression and get to the
[1:45:29] place where if we don't go out by the
[1:45:30] way of the grave there's a body change
[1:45:32] and a rapture
[1:45:33] if we do go by the way of the grave they
[1:45:35] resurrect first
[1:45:37] hence my families that's the front row
[1:45:40] right there
[1:45:42] amen you said well brother you that's
[1:45:44] far-faced is it that's what the bible
[1:45:46] said
[1:45:47] amen that first resurrection they all
[1:45:49] resurrected and appeared unto many
[1:45:51] 30-40 days they appeared unto many what
[1:45:54] would
[1:45:54] think that god's going to change his
[1:45:56] plan now he does the exact same thing
[1:45:57] today as he did then
[1:46:00] oh my it's right at hand friend the
[1:46:03] redemption of that purchased possession
[1:46:05] the praise of his glory now romans 8
[1:46:06] says
[1:46:08] beginning with the 18th verse for i
[1:46:10] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:46:11] present time are not worthy to be
[1:46:13] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:46:14] revealed in us
[1:46:15] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:46:18] creature
[1:46:19] waiteth or creation waited for the
[1:46:22] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:46:25] now not just the sons of god
[1:46:28] but for the manifestation of the sons of
[1:46:31] god
[1:46:32] well what is it when something is
[1:46:34] manifested it's brought into light
[1:46:37] it's brought into plain view it is shown
[1:46:40] forth before everyone that that is the
[1:46:44] manifested
[1:46:45] son and daughter of god the
[1:46:47] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:46:49] all of creation's waiting all of
[1:46:52] creation is groaning
[1:46:54] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:46:56] sons of god
[1:46:57] for the creature was made subject to
[1:47:00] abandon not willing but by reason of him
[1:47:03] who had subjected the same in hope
[1:47:05] because the creature
[1:47:06] itself amen
[1:47:09] shall also be delivered from the bondage
[1:47:12] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[1:47:14] of the children of god
[1:47:15] for we know that the whole creation
[1:47:17] groaneth and travaileth and pained
[1:47:19] together until now
[1:47:22] and not only they but also but ourselves
[1:47:25] also which have the first fruits of the
[1:47:26] spirit
[1:47:27] we even we ourselves grown within
[1:47:30] ourselves

[1:47:35] say
[1:47:36] to wit the redemption of what
[1:47:40] our bodies the purchased
[1:47:43] possession god has purchased us
[1:47:47] we belong to him now if we've been
[1:47:50] purchased
[1:47:50] we belong to god and if we belong to god
[1:47:54] then god makes us molds us
[1:47:57] shapes us who we are who he wants us to
[1:48:01] be
[1:48:02] and if we become what god wants us to be
[1:48:05] what does that manifest on this earth
[1:48:08] the expression of jesus christ again
[1:48:11] with the preeminence of him in his body
[1:48:16] and i'm that part of that body amen

[1:48:30] fullness jesus
[1:48:33] deity himself standing on earth god in
[1:48:36] his fullness to die for the sin of the
[1:48:38] people
[1:48:40] giving us the power to become sons of
[1:48:43] god
[1:48:44] that he might bring to his church a
[1:48:46] sanctified life
[1:48:48] that he might have the preeminence in
[1:48:50] fullness in his church
[1:48:53] to manifest every promise to man now
[1:48:56] what's the purpose
[1:48:57] to manifest every promise in these last
[1:49:01] days
[1:49:02] amen that he promised for these last
[1:49:06] days
[1:49:08] that's the purpose to manifest through
[1:49:11] us his purpose for this last days
[1:49:15] amen jesus manifested that purpose
[1:49:19] and through that purpose he achieved a
[1:49:21] church that he might
[1:49:23] uh that he the fullness of god might
[1:49:25] bring to pass every promised word of god
[1:49:27] in these
[1:49:28] last days when he gets the preeminence
[1:49:31] in his bride
[1:49:32] the posit uh the position he places in
[1:49:36] the church
[1:49:37] jesus said that he belongs to me the

[1:54:59] amen when we talk about
[1:55:01] him becoming me so that i might become
[1:55:05] him that has meaning
[1:55:08] a lot of people have a hard time
[1:55:10] understanding or maybe even believing
[1:55:12] that or especially about themselves
[1:55:14] maybe
[1:55:14] because usually when you look in the
[1:55:16] mural you see his faults and failures
[1:55:17] and satan's going to make sure that's
[1:55:19] right all you see
[1:55:21] but god has made you so much more than
[1:55:23] that friend
[1:55:24] we just believe that today by faith
[1:55:27] believe that he became us he took our
[1:55:29] place at calvary he shed
[1:55:31] his blood that blood still sets there
[1:55:33] today on that mercy seat
[1:55:35] making intercession for us taking our
[1:55:38] place so that we might could take his
[1:55:41] that we might be robed in his
[1:55:43] righteousness without spot wrinkle or
[1:55:45] blemish

[1:55:55] today
[1:55:55] he said well i don't feel that way well
[1:55:58] you know
[1:55:59] there's something we do to get beyond
[1:56:01] our feelings
[1:56:03] and that's called faith amen
[1:56:06] faith goes beyond your feelings now if
[1:56:09] you legitimately
[1:56:11] aren't acting like christ and your life
[1:56:13] doesn't match up to christ
[1:56:15] then there's you need to find a place to
[1:56:17] pray
[1:56:18] amen and get to that place but if it's
[1:56:22] just simple oh i just don't feel worthy
