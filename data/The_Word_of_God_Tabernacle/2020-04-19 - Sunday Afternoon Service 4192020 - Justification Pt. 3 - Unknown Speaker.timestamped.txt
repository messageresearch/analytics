[0:13] hello everyone god bless you today I'm
[0:16] home again and appreciate the Lord again
[0:18] providing us the ability to be able to
[0:20] do this and be able to be together again
[0:23] even if it's not in the flesh we're
[0:25] still together in the spirit and of
[0:27] course we know that thank God that his
[0:29] Holy Spirit is omnipresent so wherever
[0:31] you are he's there and we're here and
[0:33] he's here so he's here he's there he's
[0:36] everywhere so we're a union Universal
[0:38] brides were together in this and thank
[0:40] the Lord again to be able to have this
[0:42] opportunity together on a Sunday morning
[0:45] and it's been a little different on
[0:47] being on thirst Sunday mornings instead
[0:50] of Sunday afternoons because we got so
[0:52] used to doing Sunday afternoons kind of
[0:54] forgot what it was like to do a Sunday
[0:56] morning so I'm glad to be able to do
[0:58] that and be here with you people so may
[1:01] the Lord richly bless you and I pray God
[1:02] the Lord of what he'd speak to us today
[1:05] would be a blessing to you we're gonna
[1:07] have a few prayer requests when I
[1:09] mentioned to you today and a couple of
[1:11] praise reports we'll just kind of bring
[1:13] them all together but brother Dennis it
[1:15] again asked prayer for his wife Leah the
[1:18] Lord would just bless her and be with
[1:19] her and help just comfort her heart
[1:22] she's kind of troubled over having to do
[1:26] what she does as a nurse so just
[1:27] remember her in prayer the Lord would
[1:29] just touch her and help her as well also
[1:32] continue to remember sister Sheila is
[1:34] brother Harlan he's got a special
[1:36] request in his life that the Lord would
[1:39] just touch him and help him through he's
[1:42] thinking of maybe coming here to and
[1:44] being in Tucson maybe permanently but
[1:46] just remember him if you would in
[1:48] prayers well also continue remember
[1:50] brother
[1:50] Dana Thornhill for a special request
[1:54] unspoken requests we'll just leave it at
[1:56] that
[1:57] those of you those of you who know
[1:58] brother Dana Thornhill would know also
[2:01] continue remember brother a Jew warning
[2:05] from North Carolina very good friend of
[2:07] mine knowing for thirty years I guess or
[2:09] so now but just pray the Lord would just
[2:12] bless him he had a stroke a little while
[2:15] back a week or so ago
[2:16] a little less than we could think maybe
[2:18] but just prayed that the Lord would
[2:19] touch him and help get him through that
[2:21] we've had a couple praise reports for
[2:24] his progress so we're thankful for that
[2:26] God's really blessed him his speech is
[2:29] coming along his movements coming along
[2:31] and he's moving a little bit better so
[2:33] he's still in the hospital he's supposed
[2:35] to go to rehab but just to remember him
[2:38] for that we get updates from well I get
[2:41] them from Tabitha through Facebook
[2:44] I don't do Facebook anymore so but they
[2:46] send it the updates free him through
[2:50] there and I seen him a personal note
[2:52] yesterday to tell him we're praying for
[2:53] him
[3:05] well welcome back sorry about that
[3:08] anyway continuing on I wanted to
[3:10] admonish our conversation again I've
[3:13] been told by different brothers years
[3:15] ago that unless you pass the plate in
[3:18] church that people wouldn't give and
[3:21] always was against that not necessarily
[3:23] cuz and not against passing the plate
[3:26] but against that thought process because
[3:28] I always felt like that God's children
[3:30] were there and they were led of God that
[3:33] that they would do what the Bible says
[3:35] and and that's I believe what the Bible
[3:38] does say I tried it and it worked in
[3:42] Florida and I've tried it and it worked
[3:44] here and that being said I appreciate
[3:48] very much you precious Saints there's
[3:52] not a basket or a box or a plate to push
[3:55] around or pass around or to put anything
[3:58] in but you've driven by our place and
[4:00] we've gone by yours and the mail and
[4:03] different things just to try to make
[4:04] sure that the time is an offering that
[4:07] you have to the Lord that you bring for
[4:10] us and it's Rinna it's been a tremendous
[4:12] tremendous blessing and I want to punish
[4:15] you for that that you don't get that
[4:17] just everywhere and it's not something
[4:19] that we talk about it's not something
[4:21] that we push you to or that you have to
[4:24] pledge to you do it of your own free
[4:27] will and them from your heart and that's
[4:30] what the Bible says God rewards you and
[4:32] bless you I told I asked the Lord the
[4:34] other day to return a hundredfold to you
[4:37] for the blessings that you do now it's
[4:39] not your money it's not my money it's
[4:41] God's we just happen to be the stewards
[4:44] that God's Word
[4:45] commands us to be and but I want
[4:49] admonish you precious godly people you
[4:52] obey the word and God bless you for it
[4:54] so let's just remember these requests
[4:56] now and we'll go to the Lord in prayer
[4:58] pray for the the service now and for
[5:02] these requests as we bow our heads
[5:03] together

[6:46] Lord had G CH one of us about Lord with
[6:48] your holy angels to keep us protected
[6:50] from all the germs and diseases in the
[6:53] world for we don't live by fear but we
[6:55] live by faith and we thank you God for
[6:58] the faith from the Son of God to deliver
[7:00] us and bring us into your presence god I
[7:03] pray that you would speak to us Lord now
[7:05] and may you minister through your word
[7:07] God into our hearts reveal your word to
[7:10] us once again rich and true today as we
[7:13] commit it to you in the name of the Lord
[7:15] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[7:19] well praise the Lord let's go to our
[7:21] Bibles now we're going to go back over
[7:23] to Romans chapter 8 and I want to speak
[7:28] today
[7:29] more along the lines of the process of
[7:32] new birth but I'm on a title of the end
[7:35] justification so it's going to be
[7:37] justification part three but you see you
[7:39] got the board back up here and and all
[7:42] that it goes through but look at the
[7:43] scripture and I believe I had you last
[7:46] week - maybe if you had the time which
[7:49] I'm managing most of us are a home it
[7:51] might have a little bit of time to
[7:53] listen to the future home of the
[7:55] heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride if
[7:57] you haven't do I'm gonna go into that a
[8:00] little bit today a little bit more than
[8:03] I did last week so if you want to listen
[8:06] that feel free to do so a man but Romans
[8:10] chapter 8 we just want to read this one
[8:12] verse of scripture again verse 33 it
[8:15] says who shall lay anything to the
[8:18] charge of God's elect it is God that
[8:20] justified amen
[8:23] it's God to justify sin so that's the
[8:25] subject we would want to get into today
[8:27] although we're going to go again into
[8:29] more of a whole of the new birth and and
[8:33] the difference that it makes in our
[8:36] lives of the new birth and the sin and
[8:41] the things that we have in our lives and
[8:44] the things that happen in our lives and
[8:46] and and the process that it goes through
[8:49] and why things are they are when you're
[8:51] born and remember born again or a born
[8:55] in sin shaped and equity come in the
[8:57] world speaking lies or being born again
[8:59] of the Spirit of God amen so let's go
[9:03] over to first Peter and I want to begin
[9:06] reading there again read a couple of
[9:13] verses of Scripture from first Peter
[9:15] chapter 1 beginning with verse 22 as a
[9:19] couple of particular points I want to
[9:21] make here today and so we'll get to
[9:25] those and maybe when we get to those
[9:27] particular things I want to point out
[9:29] the other things we just kind of bring
[9:31] along the line to bring us to those
[9:32] points that hopefully would be a help
[9:35] and a bless
[9:36] to you today first Peter chapter 1 verse
[9:38] 22 says seeing you have purified your
[9:42] souls in obeying the truth so obeying
[9:46] the truth is purification to the soul
[9:49] how does that purification come when the
[9:51] Holy Spirit comes in when you obey the
[9:54] word Peter said repent be baptized the
[9:57] name of Jesus Christ remission of sin
[9:59] and you shall receive the gift of the
[10:00] Holy Ghost that's the promise that we
[10:02] have obeying that word brings us in
[10:05] personal contact with the Holy Spirit
[10:06] brings that Holy Spirit promise into our
[10:10] lives because we obeyed the word
[10:12] purifying our souls remember our souls
[10:15] first of all were born of a sin nature
[10:17] we're born with a snake nature of the
[10:20] devil in there the the nature the
[10:22] children of Wrath but it purifies us
[10:25] when we obeyed the word obeying the word
[10:27] repentance baptism coming into the
[10:30] fulfilling of the Holy Spirit in our
[10:32] lives through the spirit unto unfeigned
[10:36] love now peter mitching of course love
[10:40] or the love without hypocrisy this love
[10:43] is that is the gap a love that's without
[10:47] unfeigned means without hypocrisy means
[10:50] a true love of this of the brethren see
[10:53] that ye love one another with a pure
[10:55] heart fervently and fervent is burning
[10:58] with passionate 23rd verse
[11:01] being born again again like I said
[11:03] that's what I want to talk about in the
[11:05] wholeness of this is a new birth being
[11:08] born again not of corruptible seed but
[11:12] of incorruptible seed remember our first
[11:15] birth was a corrupt seed our new birth
[11:18] is an incorruptible seed the first birth
[11:21] was with the wrong nature the new birth
[11:24] is with the nature of God that seed of
[11:26] God that God planted in there
[11:27] predestined in there before the
[11:29] foundation of the world so not of that
[11:31] incorruptible seed but of incorruptible
[11:35] by the Word of God amen remember John 1
[11:39] says in the beginning was the word the
[11:42] word logos that word logos is the
[11:44] completion of God is to come
[11:47] lesion of his word is the completion of
[11:49] who he is that low Gauss came out of God
[11:52] and began to create that low Gauss
[11:54] condon send it down into Melchizedek and
[11:58] and and the pillar of fire and the
[12:01] pillar of cloud and and come eventually
[12:04] into Jesus Christ and that same one is
[12:06] in us today it's the same it's the word
[12:09] Christ is the word God is the word Amen
[12:12] in that word now as we see is
[12:16] uncorruptible is the word of God which
[12:19] liveth and abideth forever live identify
[12:22] because once it's in there it's sealed
[12:24] remember we read Ephesians 1 sealed into
[12:26] your destination right so when you're
[12:29] sealed in there by the Holy Spirit
[12:30] promise of God then you're still there
[12:32] to your eternal destination it abideth
[12:34] forever incorruptible now look how the
[12:37] word puts this well Peter says here
[12:39] Peter says the incorruptible seed a seed
[12:43] what is the seed a seed is a beginning
[12:46] of life seed is is the is the holder of
[12:51] life any seed that come as God had
[12:55] created in the beginning come regardless
[12:57] of what seed it is I'm watching the
[13:00] beautiful birds flying around helping my
[13:01] backyard and the trees and and the grass
[13:04] and all of those things came from seeds
[13:06] humans we all come from seed there's a
[13:09] seed that comes from somewhere that is
[13:11] predestined foreordained to come to life
[13:14] man talked about that brothers should
[13:17] care and I believe that took him and
[13:18] showed him how the Bulls reproduced and
[13:21] cows and animals reproduced and the eggs
[13:24] and the the sperm and the the
[13:26] reproduction process and but that's it
[13:29] that's that seed that that's predestined
[13:32] brother man used it it's like a
[13:34] one-in-a-million scenario a thousand a
[13:36] million seeds come out but only one is
[13:38] ordained to life there's there's a seed
[13:41] of a tree out there it's if it's put in
[13:44] the right ground in the right atmosphere
[13:45] and given water that seed will will obey
[13:49] the law dot that law of God is it and
[13:51] will reproduce it
[13:52] come to life so if it's talking about an
[13:55] incorruptible seed is talking about
[13:58] something that has life in it something
[14:00] that is the arbiter the beginning of
[14:03] life it is life itself where did that
[14:07] life come from well if it's
[14:08] incorruptible there's only one place it
[14:10] could come from everything we have in
[14:13] the world everything we look at in our
[14:14] today is corruptible so war would incur
[14:16] up she come from it's God so it's a seed
[14:19] of God the incorruptible seed of God
[14:22] that comes and lives with us we're so
[14:25] that new birth now again it says being
[14:27] born again Jesus told Nicodemus lest you
[14:30] be born again you can't even see the
[14:32] kingdom of heaven
[14:33] so beautifu again of incorruptible seed
[14:37] by the word of God amen that's the Word
[14:41] of God now some people believe that you
[14:43] that you don't receive that seed until
[14:46] the word comes in you I am contrary to
[14:51] that a lot of thoughts going through my
[14:53] mind right now I'm not going to say of
[14:55] other things that I've heard that people
[14:57] believe that I just don't see how it
[15:00] works with the word nor do I see how
[15:02] that works from the I know it says here
[15:04] by the Word of God but the truth of it
[15:06] is if that seed wasn't already there for
[15:10] the spirit to come and strike it then
[15:12] whatever word comes whatever word a
[15:16] person hears is is going to be null and
[15:19] void if that word is going to be no
[15:21] effect it can be the same word that
[15:23] we're reading right now but it's not
[15:25] going to mean anything to those people
[15:26] unless that was already there the
[15:29] predestinated seen of God has always
[15:32] been there the Word of God through the
[15:35] Spirit of God just brings life the
[15:38] washing of the water of the word the
[15:40] word through water washing brings life
[15:43] to that seed just like if you water a
[15:46] seat of grass in our apartment's here we
[15:50] got sprinklers out here that's watering
[15:53] the grass out here and it's starting to
[15:54] turn green the sprinklers out in front
[15:56] of our apartment aren't working and all
[15:58] the city all the grass is dying because
[16:00] there's no water so when the water comes
[16:03] in his to see
[16:04] the seed comes to life not the other way
[16:06] around it's like some people believe you
[16:09] got to get all the attributes of the
[16:11] Statue of a perfect man before you get
[16:13] the Holy Ghost
[16:14] well I contend you can't get to those
[16:16] statues unless you have the Holy Ghost
[16:18] it's a new birth Peter didn't say repent
[16:22] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[16:23] remission of sin and then establish each
[16:26] one of these steps that you have to
[16:28] follow then you can get the Holy Ghost
[16:30] no that's not what the Bible says so we
[16:32] got to follow what the Bible says we
[16:34] can't go by Manas ideas or opinions what
[16:37] does the Bible say the Bible says an
[16:40] incorruptible seed by the word I know
[16:43] the word is the seed it's the washing of
[16:45] the water that brings life to that seed
[16:48] to that word amen
[16:50] so let's listen to this now for all
[16:52] flesh the flesh now is as grass and all
[16:56] the glory of man as the flower of grass
[16:59] the grass withereth and the flower
[17:02] thereof falleth away just like the flesh
[17:05] just like the man just from the fall of
[17:07] the Garden of Eden each one of us it
[17:09] from dust thou art told us that we'll
[17:12] return it's like the grass of the flower
[17:14] of the grass follows the way but the
[17:17] word of the Lord now that word is Rhema
[17:20] that where does not logos Rhema is a
[17:22] specific word that's spoken for a
[17:25] specific time specific purpose that is a
[17:27] part of the the logos it came from the
[17:32] logos but it was a specific something
[17:34] spoken of a word of the Lord endureth
[17:37] forever and this is the word again
[17:40] that's Rhema which by the gospel is
[17:42] preached to you amen now I can't
[17:45] understand that the preaching why God
[17:48] used the preaching of the word to save
[17:50] souls that's that's God's choice but
[17:52] that word endureth that word of of the
[17:56] gospel that word the Lord which was
[17:58] preached endureth because it reaches a
[18:02] place in you that brings life and and
[18:07] you know when that line comes people say
[18:09] well can you
[18:10] prove it you get it and you won't need
[18:12] proof it once it happens to you you'll
[18:15] know you don't have to prove it then
[18:17] people said well how do you know you'll
[18:19] know that does just hardly any better
[18:21] way to say it well can you
[18:22] scientifically prove it no but what can
[18:26] and can't science prove today there's a
[18:28] lot of things science proof twenty
[18:29] fifteen hundred years ago that they
[18:31] can't prove today or that's contrary
[18:33] today than what they did since can you
[18:36] say it's better than this it's it comes
[18:39] by personal experience so when you know
[18:41] it you have it you don't have to ask
[18:43] that question anymore because you know
[18:45] what's in you you know what you know
[18:47] that it has already been done so that
[18:49] word of the Lord endureth forever and
[18:51] the word of the Lord which by the gospel
[18:54] is preached unto you now I want to read
[18:56] a particular code here and again like I
[19:00] said from future home if you want to
[19:02] again try to try to if you did in this
[19:05] week listen to future home I believe it
[19:11] would be a blessing to you it's a place
[19:12] where the Brown talked about the eighth
[19:14] day that we got into last week talked
[19:16] about eternity and time rolling over
[19:18] into eternity into the millennium but it
[19:22] also talks about this which we get into
[19:25] just a little bit here now listen this
[19:27] is from future home look them hands
[19:30] design this for his beloved bride God's
[19:33] hands designed this earth this place for
[19:36] his beloved and bride designed in
[19:40] tenderly love for his bride remember
[19:43] that the Holy Ghost the sin descended on
[19:48] Jesus which Jesus was a part of the
[19:52] earth was flesh come in likeness of
[19:54] sinful flesh he was a part of the earth
[19:56] why'd the germ of God the life of God
[19:59] was designed in the womb of a woman is
[20:02] that right he says now which it which
[20:05] was the earth she was the earth he was
[20:07] from the earth that flesh was from the
[20:09] earth
[20:09] all right then and the life of God came
[20:12] in so he was the beginning of the
[20:14] creation of God
[20:17] revelation 3c and then that blood that
[20:21] blood of God that was there by the
[20:24] German when it was shed at Calvary
[20:26] dropped back upon the earth for what to
[20:29] redeem the earth now he's talking about
[20:31] and we're entering into this quote
[20:33] reading in the process of the redemption
[20:36] of the earth and and when he talks about
[20:38] Christ dying at Calvary and the blood
[20:41] dropping on the earth to redeem the
[20:43] earth he's talking about the the
[20:45] redemption process of the earth that God
[20:49] played just like he does us so the
[20:52] dropping of the blood from Calvary on
[20:54] the earth redeemed the earth it
[20:56] purchased the earth back to himself now
[20:58] now it's justified it's been sanctified
[21:01] called claimed and now is to receive its
[21:03] baptism of fire and be cleansed for
[21:06] Jesus now listen that real close we'll
[21:09] get back to that in just a minute
[21:10] cleanse for Jesus and his bride and you
[21:13] are those other parts that's drawn out
[21:16] of this earth you are listen now you are
[21:20] a part of the earth your body do we just
[21:23] talked about flesh we just read the
[21:25] first Peter flesh you are part of the
[21:27] earth your body your soul is part of God
[21:32] an attribute of God displayed here on
[21:35] earth in a body the now that soul that
[21:38] soul is God amen that soul that seed
[21:42] that come forth to bring life and then
[21:44] that belongs to God that is God it
[21:46] doesn't just belong to God it is God
[21:48] that seat is God that seat is just that
[21:51] part of you who he is that he placed in
[21:53] you see because if you're an attribute
[21:56] of fall to God you always were a part of
[21:57] God just like the thought that I might
[21:59] have right now is part of me you can
[22:03] actually see that even in our copyright
[22:06] laws in this country if I have a unique
[22:09] thought and I can pin that unique
[22:11] thought in the book and I can copyright
[22:14] that book and if anybody else tries to
[22:16] steal that fought and claim it as their
[22:18] own they can get sued by me because that
[22:21] was my thought it's like it's a part of
[22:23] me
[22:24] it's my intelligence
[22:26] or intellectual property it's a part of
[22:29] me see I just happened to put it on a
[22:31] book and for everybody to read and enjoy
[22:33] what my thought was and if somebody
[22:36] tries to steal that then they're a thief
[22:37] because that's me that's part of me
[22:40] well that thought is God and what God
[22:42] expressed that fall down in here in the
[22:44] earth he he put it on these books he put
[22:47] it in these earthen vessels these human
[22:49] beans us so that it can be read by all
[22:52] men we're reading epistles read of all
[22:54] been so weird that intellectual property
[22:56] of God that God put down there now if
[22:59] anybody tries to steal from it or take
[23:01] any claim that is their own they're a
[23:02] thief and a robber but we belong to God
[23:05] so that part of him that is him it's
[23:08] just that fault that he put out here
[23:10] that's expressed to us that's who we are
[23:12] where it gives intellectual property in
[23:15] the world in the United States at least
[23:17] you can be sued for trying to steal
[23:19] somebody's intellectual property but we
[23:22] are that part of God see your soul is
[23:25] that part of God that's that part of God
[23:29] an attribute of God displayed on earth
[23:31] in a body the body is the bodies listen
[23:35] this now the bodies to be redeemed amen
[23:39] now the souls been redeemed because it
[23:44] was in sin was in sin so remember this
[23:47] is the process that we're talking about
[23:49] we'll get to the justification
[23:51] sanctification only goes so just like
[23:53] you remember the glass in the chicken
[23:55] yard you know you take the glass out of
[23:57] the chicken yard that's justification
[23:58] it's it's no longer in the chicken yard
[24:01] you take it you wash it you clean it up
[24:03] that sanctification and it's nice
[24:06] beautiful pristine glass but it's still
[24:08] not doing anything but until it's filled
[24:10] with something a beverage water or
[24:13] something to be put into use that's the
[24:14] filling of the Holy Ghost and that's
[24:17] that simplicity of that of that birth
[24:19] the justification was taken out of the
[24:21] chicken yard it's no longer there
[24:23] anymore amen
[24:24] it's it's it's not a part of that life
[24:27] anymore now see that that soul that's
[24:30] redeemed see for the round spring is to
[24:34] the point of rib
[24:35] it has been redeemed if you're in that
[24:37] place a person in the part of New Birth
[24:41] as we just read born again of
[24:44] incorruptible seed you've been born in
[24:48] that your soul has been redeemed your
[24:51] body is to be redeemed amen but listen
[24:55] to the process is hell well then then
[24:58] our bodies are just here in the world of
[25:00] course their stinky flesh we it's just
[25:02] the body I was born with other than
[25:05] getting older and a few more wrinkles
[25:06] and aches and pains and a couple of
[25:10] haircuts of my life I'm saying God was
[25:12] why I was born same flesh but it's in
[25:16] the process listen it was the soul was
[25:20] in sin so God the soul was in sin amen
[25:25] I want to bring that down to us in a few
[25:27] minutes we get to our next scripture
[25:29] reading but the soul was in sin so God
[25:32] come down by process of justification
[25:35] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[25:36] and redeemed your soul you be part of
[25:41] the earth it's redeemed by it you're in
[25:43] the process now it's going on the
[25:47] process of what the redemption of these
[25:49] bodies you go read Romans eight we'll
[25:52] read Romans eight but we won't get to
[25:54] this part of Romans eight but that that
[25:56] new birth or Redemption the completion
[25:59] of the redemption ends and I believe
[26:01] it's Romans 8:23 to wit that is to say
[26:04] the redemption of our bodies it's
[26:08] already a process now because the soul
[26:12] has been redeemed which brings the
[26:14] spirit into subjection which brings the
[26:16] body under subjection to the word it's
[26:19] already in process but it hasn't
[26:21] received its full Redemption yet so it
[26:24] still lives in sin it still lives in a
[26:27] sinful world it still has sinful
[26:29] thoughts
[26:30] it still has things it comes up for our
[26:32] memories
[26:32] conscience reason there's still those
[26:34] things that affect us in our body and in
[26:36] our spirit but not in our soul because
[26:40] our soul has been changed it is God now
[26:43] it's not of this old nature it's of
[26:45] God's nature so it's a different it's a
[26:49] different place of of sitting if you
[26:52] will or or disbelief but hold on to that
[26:56] because we'll get back to that in just a
[26:57] moment but he's talking about now we've
[27:01] been through justification
[27:03] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[27:04] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[27:06] know makes a way a baptism simply an
[27:10] anointing but that baptism makes a way
[27:13] for the person of Christ this seed to
[27:17] live in you amen
[27:19] that baptism is a cleansing it's an
[27:22] anointing that a-19 of this the
[27:26] anointing of this body spirit allows
[27:28] that Holy Spirit to bring life to that
[27:32] seat so now God is in there that's God
[27:35] living but that anointing comes to allow
[27:38] a process for that to happen
[27:40] that's a baptism a lot of people say
[27:42] well you have the baptism of Holy Ghost
[27:44] well brother Graham said in modern
[27:46] events you can have the baptism dump
[27:48] needing your going in because the
[27:50] baptism is just an anointing a baptism
[27:52] is just a covering you can get the
[27:55] absolute genuine Holy Spirit of God
[27:58] anointed on your body and spirit and die
[28:00] and go to hell it's the soul that
[28:03] matters it's the inside of the inside
[28:05] that matters you can't live based on
[28:07] some gifts or some anointing you've got
[28:09] to live based on the fact that God has
[28:11] changed your soul and made you a new
[28:14] creature not just some going to church
[28:17] or being a pious person it's not about
[28:21] that it's about being born again having
[28:23] God Christ living in you that at baptism
[28:27] makes you wait for the person of Christ
[28:29] to come living you look it up you see
[28:31] what I'm talking about
[28:32] that person of Christ to come living you
[28:34] God living in you the baptism just makes
[28:37] a way for that
[28:38] amen that Holy Spirit now he says though
[28:43] the bastard
[28:44] the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul
[28:47] praise the Lord redeemed the past tense
[28:50] your soul and you've been part of the
[28:53] earth this body you be part of the earth
[28:57] it's redeemed by the process of the
[29:01] redemption that led to the new birth
[29:04] he'd been so when God took and and
[29:08] brought in a new birth to redeem the
[29:11] soul he got the body in the spirit at
[29:15] the same time
[29:16] amen look now go see you can't you you
[29:21] you can have justification without
[29:23] having sanctification you can have
[29:24] justification Sanctus of that home the
[29:26] Holy Ghost but you can't have just case
[29:29] you Saints case the Holy Ghost without
[29:31] being Saints fighter justified you can't
[29:32] have the Holy Ghost without having the
[29:34] first two so if you've been born again
[29:36] and gods cleanse your soul he's redeemed
[29:38] his intellectual property then your body
[29:41] and your spirit come with it
[29:43] it's it's a package deal you can have
[29:46] the you can have an anointing on the
[29:48] body and not be born again true but if
[29:50] you're born again the body's been
[29:52] redeemed look now he said it's redeemed
[29:55] by it but what by the souls Redemption
[30:00] it's being a part of the earth is
[30:02] redeemed by it you're in the process
[30:06] amen a process the process is something
[30:09] that has a beginning has a time period
[30:11] and has an end
[30:12] well that process is going on right now
[30:15] there was a time when we were born again
[30:18] and brought our bodies under subjection
[30:19] to that spirit but there's good and that
[30:22] processes going on now but when this
[30:25] body change hits and we go in a rapture
[30:27] that's going to be the combination of it
[30:29] it's going to be the end of that process
[30:31] the process is now growing on but
[30:35] there's going to be an end to that
[30:37] process when this body takes a change
[30:39] when this corruptible put some in
[30:41] corruption not just the soul
[30:43] incorruptible seed but the body the body
[30:47] puts on the in corruption
[30:49] that's the fullness of the redemption
[30:50] that's one Paulson and Romans 8:23 to
[30:54] wit the read in
[30:55] chin of our bodies of our bodies what is
[30:58] that the completion of what God paid for
[31:02] they did the earth the same way this
[31:04] earth that God would remember back in
[31:06] the Garden of Eden when when when Adam
[31:08] lost his inheritance he lost his
[31:10] inheritance in life he lost his
[31:12] inheritance to the to the book of life
[31:15] he lost his inheritance to the world he
[31:18] had to he was a mature god of this world
[31:20] he could speak namesake do whatever he
[31:22] wanted to this world because I belong to
[31:24] him God put Adam as as his son as an
[31:29] immature God he put Adam in charge
[31:31] complete charge of this earth because he
[31:34] had the mind of God he had the Spirit of
[31:35] God he had the will of God he had the
[31:37] purpose of God everything about animals
[31:39] God so God had confidence in his son to
[31:42] know that what decisions he was going to
[31:44] make would be exactly what he would have
[31:46] made in him and that seems and that's
[31:49] what his trust that he puts in I believe
[31:51] he puts trust in his children again
[31:53] today it's just like a natural parent in
[31:56] her and her natural children there comes
[31:58] a time where you've turned that child
[32:01] and you've raised that child and you got
[32:02] to bring that child of the place that
[32:04] that they make their own decisions and
[32:06] they can make their own decisions we
[32:09] might not always agree with them as
[32:10] parents but they're going to make their
[32:12] own decisions and and a lot of times
[32:15] those decisions are going to be based on
[32:17] what how they were raised and what mom
[32:21] and daddy thought and how what we
[32:23] instilled in them as parents that
[32:26] becomes a lot of the decision-making
[32:27] that they make now they do their own
[32:29] decisions and they do their own thing
[32:30] because we're humans but God Adam was
[32:33] that God child that God son
[32:36] they God had 100% confidence in and we
[32:40] get grown up enough as children of God
[32:42] God entrusts us to make the decisions
[32:45] that are right for us to be led of God
[32:48] and for us to fulfill the perfect will
[32:50] of God for our lives he entrusts us with
[32:53] that that's a part of that free will
[32:55] we're free won't agents because God
[32:59] trusts us as children now there's others
[33:02] that are free moral agents to have a
[33:04] free will to do whatever they want live
[33:07] whatever
[33:07] do you want people do that but God still
[33:10] did not take away our free moral agency
[33:13] he did not even know what stole we've
[33:16] been born again did not take away our
[33:18] free will because God wants us and
[33:20] allows us to make her own decisions and
[33:22] go our own way and do her own things and
[33:24] he has confidence enough with his spirit
[33:27] in there that is we are grown and we
[33:29] continue to move by the Spirit of God
[33:30] that we're going to make the decisions
[33:32] in life and we try to look now we try to
[33:35] we don't always do it perfect but we try
[33:39] to do it exactly the way God would do it
[33:41] if God were standing here in my mind and
[33:45] my body and my flesh God would do it
[33:47] like this and not believe God trusts us
[33:50] that way we'll it was it was a 100% with
[33:53] Adam because he was there was no sin he
[33:56] was the spoken word of God Adam was but
[33:58] when he lost his earth he lost his
[34:01] inheritance in this earth he lost his
[34:02] inheritance in life
[34:04] well this earth belonged to God see
[34:07] God's got a big just like we belong to
[34:09] God so dogs got to bring this earth back
[34:11] into his possession because it was
[34:13] rightfully lost to Satan
[34:16] it was rightfully lost it was out of his
[34:18] hands and if it was rightfully lost to
[34:21] Satan and Satan had control of it and
[34:23] Satan still does this is still Satan's
[34:25] eating you see the corona virus is a
[34:28] very good example of that and everything
[34:29] else is going on and and all but it
[34:32] still belongs to God this is where we're
[34:35] going to live friends this is where the
[34:37] Millennium is going to be set up this is
[34:38] where the new sitting the new truths was
[34:40] going to be said of us right here on
[34:42] this earth so this belongs to God down
[34:44] below it didn't say it's possession but
[34:47] it no longer belongs to him but why he
[34:50] rightfully lost it Adam rightfully lost
[34:52] it to Satan so Satan is in control of it
[34:55] but God had to bring that back well how
[34:57] did he bring it back he had to bring it
[34:59] back into his possession exactly the
[35:01] same way that he brings us back into his
[35:04] possession
[35:05] first there was a baptism of this earth
[35:08] by Noah and the flood that was the
[35:10] justification that the blood come and
[35:12] the sanctified it cleanse it by his
[35:15] blood that we just read here his blood
[35:17] dripped upon
[35:17] the earth to redeem this earth back by
[35:20] his own blood
[35:21] now this earth listen this now you think
[35:25] whoa if God's brought this back and he's
[35:27] justified he cleansed it and and he's
[35:30] and he's put it in the pin the position
[35:34] for us to possess it once again now we
[35:37] know that it's going to come a fiery
[35:38] baptism the the Bible says the elements
[35:42] are going to melt with fervent Heat
[35:45] so we know that that's going to happen
[35:47] but the place that it's at now and you
[35:51] think well yeah but it's still in such a
[35:53] horrible condition it's still Satan's
[35:56] Eden it absolutely is why because this
[35:59] earth just like so many people is caught
[36:03] right now it's in the place of between
[36:06] sanctification and Bethan and Holy Ghost
[36:10] this earth is in that place that's why
[36:13] it's still the way it is we can operate
[36:16] here and live here as children of God as
[36:18] born-again sons and daughters of God but
[36:21] this earth itself and we've been
[36:23] redeemed but remember these bodies are
[36:25] still here still a part of the earth
[36:28] still a part of the ground still the
[36:30] stinky flesh still the same guys born in
[36:35] this this flesh you look at me you said
[36:37] well you haven't changed much well you
[36:39] look down on the inside the inside
[36:41] you'll see I've changed a whole lot but
[36:44] you look at this guy on the flesh you
[36:45] say why you your picture looks like this
[36:47] and you look like this and you look like
[36:49] your mom you look like your dad or you
[36:51] look like when you were ten or whatever
[36:52] it is it said well yeah because that's
[36:54] I'm still in this place you look at the
[36:56] earth you say while the earth is the way
[36:58] it is but this earth is still in the
[37:00] position it's in it's still in Satan's
[37:02] Eaton's because it's in between the
[37:05] sanctification we've had the dropping of
[37:07] God's blood on the earth but we haven't
[37:10] had our fiery baptism yet on this earth
[37:13] so when that comes that will be the to
[37:16] wit the redemption of the earth that
[37:20] will be the completion of that
[37:22] Redemption just like we've been redeemed
[37:25] but the completion of our Redemption
[37:27] doesn't take place and
[37:30] these bodies are redeemed to it the
[37:32] redemption of our bodies that Earth is
[37:34] in the same place you're in the process
[37:37] now see the Earth's in the process we're
[37:41] in the process we live in Satan's even
[37:43] because Satan's Eden because this earth
[37:45] is between sanctification and receiving
[37:48] it's fiery baptism and it will and when
[37:51] it does then it be fit for God and his
[37:54] bride and for us to come and live here
[37:56] the millennium is going to take place
[37:57] and and then the white throne judgment
[38:04] and the new city God's going to bring
[38:07] all into possession into his position at
[38:10] that time but it's in the process now
[38:12] it's in the process your body was
[38:15] justified under Noah's baptism why
[38:18] because we're part of the earth if we're
[38:21] part of the earth and being a part of
[38:23] the earth our bodies were justified then
[38:25] amen in your flesh when it dropped upon
[38:28] there it was justified at that moment at
[38:32] that time let's look at some scripture
[38:35] reading again go over to first John one
[38:39] of my one of my favorites I guess I
[38:41] could say I bring this scripture up on
[38:48] many occasion other sermons because it
[38:53] brings such a clear view and a total
[38:55] synopsis of of what's going on in our
[38:59] lives now I've had people say well you
[39:02] know when when you know you sin
[39:09] willfully or you don't to try to put
[39:15] somebody into place even though they've
[39:17] had a new birth that they'll never ever
[39:20] make another mistake or never ever have
[39:23] a sin as will say again puts that person
[39:27] in the place of of angelic or godly
[39:31] perfection in their flesh when our flesh
[39:33] has not been redeemed yet our soul has
[39:37] been redeemed but our body has not so
[39:41] we'll keep that in mind
[39:42] as we continue or go into this reversed
[39:45] John chapter 3 I want to begin verse 1
[39:47] yeah I read this I've read this several
[39:50] times but just for the sake of bringing
[39:52] this together now first John 1 first
[39:56] john one says if we say we have no sin
[39:59] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[40:01] not in us if we confess our sins he is
[40:03] faithful and just to forgive our sins
[40:05] and to cleanse us from all
[40:07] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[40:10] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[40:13] word is not in US that's first desk
[40:16] first John 1 but now look at first John
[40:19] 3 first John 3 says behold what manner
[40:22] of love that's agape love the father has
[40:26] bestowed upon us that we should be
[40:29] called the sons of God we're still even
[40:32] in this sticky flesh called the sons of
[40:35] God because that's the love of God that
[40:37] he has for us
[40:38] it's his sovereignty therefore the world
[40:42] knoweth us not because it knew him not
[40:45] so the world doesn't know us this world
[40:48] what world war cosmos this world order
[40:51] doesn't know us because it didn't know
[40:53] him and rejected him and rejects us
[40:55] those were part of him beloved now are
[40:59] we the sons of God amen and it does not
[41:03] yet appear or manifest to to the world
[41:07] what we shall be but we know that when
[41:10] he shall appear we shall be like him for
[41:13] we shall see him as he is and every man
[41:18] that had this hope in him purifies
[41:20] himself even as he is pure so we do what
[41:26] we do of our free will to live a godly
[41:29] life we live the godly life from our
[41:33] decision we live a godly life from our
[41:36] own free will because we decide to do
[41:39] that when we decide that we want to do
[41:41] and live the way God wants us to live
[41:43] then that's of our own free will
[41:46] God didn't force us to do it we do it
[41:47] because we love him everyman pure define
[41:51] himself even as God is pure
[41:55] whosoever committeth sin transgresseth
[41:58] also the law for sin is the
[42:02] transgression of the law
[42:04] I remember what sin is sin is unbelief
[42:08] sin comes because a person does not
[42:10] believe you can say and you know that he
[42:14] was manifested Jesus Christ was
[42:17] manifested to take away our sins and in
[42:21] him is no sin now I've said this before
[42:25] and I don't want to change the word but
[42:28] you could look at this word and say that
[42:31] he took away our sins because there was
[42:35] no sin in him the only way he could take
[42:39] our sins was because he was sinless
[42:41] the reason others holding him good godly
[42:45] man could not take away our sins or be
[42:47] our sacrifice is because they weren't
[42:50] born in sins shaped innate when he come
[42:51] the world speaking lies Jesus Christ was
[42:54] not he was the created blood of God that
[42:57] seed that was placed in Mary that God
[43:00] that thought attribute put in Mary
[43:02] became Jesus Christ the logos come in
[43:06] the fullness of the godhead dwell in him
[43:08] well that was nothing more than God
[43:11] himself well God there is a sinless God
[43:15] than if he's sinless and he can take our
[43:18] sins from us so he took away our sins he
[43:22] was manifested to take away our sin and
[43:24] in him is no sin whosoever abideth in
[43:29] him listen now whosoever inviteth in him
[43:32] sinneth not okay now we're getting
[43:35] somewhere
[43:36] whosoever abideth in Christ sin if not
[43:40] so if you're abiding in Christ you
[43:43] cannot sin understand that whosoever
[43:47] sinneth has not seen him neither known
[43:51] him or transgress the law remember John
[43:54] just laid it out the sin is the
[43:55] transgression of the law
[43:57] do you have transgressed the law than
[43:59] you've sinned but the Bible says John
[44:03] said that whosoever abideth in Christ
[44:07] cannot sense
[44:09] I'm how in the world can you have it
[44:11] both ways
[44:12] I think you be a sinner and noticed and
[44:15] not sin how can you not send and be a
[44:17] sinner how can you live in Christ and
[44:18] not sin and yet a disbeliever or have
[44:22] sin in your life I mean it can't be John
[44:25] it can't be both ways I see this is one
[44:27] of those things that people get stuck in
[44:29] the gut so don't understand they avoid
[44:31] it because it doesn't make any common
[44:33] sense you can't teach it in a nest in a
[44:37] seminary somewhere this has to come by
[44:39] revelation and has to come by revelation
[44:42] to me to you to those who are gods so
[44:45] that we can understand where we stand
[44:47] and who we are in this earth today you
[44:50] can't have it both ways so has it gonna
[44:51] be well listen because remember we
[44:54] already read about the new birth Peter
[44:56] talked about the new birth well what is
[45:00] abiding in him what does that mean we're
[45:03] for abiding in him that means we had a
[45:05] birth that means something else has
[45:08] taken place because when I was born I
[45:10] wasn't like that
[45:11] I was I was born with the nature of
[45:15] Wrath I was born with a snake nature I
[45:18] wasn't born that way so something had to
[45:20] take place
[45:20] well John gets to it let's keep reading
[45:27] let's go back to the six-person
[45:28] whosoever abideth in him sinneth not
[45:32] whosoever sinneth has not seen him
[45:34] neither known him little children let no
[45:38] man deceive you good advice he that does
[45:41] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[45:46] righteous those who do rightly those who
[45:50] are just remember what just is righteous
[45:54] ought to be condition he that committeth
[45:58] sin is of the devil now that's pretty
[46:00] hard but it's true especially after what
[46:05] John just told us what did John just
[46:08] tell us that we abide in him we cannot
[46:11] sin so when he said those he that
[46:14] committeth sin is of the devil he's
[46:16] saying that you still have that old
[46:18] nature you still are in the
[46:21] same condition that you're born in there
[46:25] has to be a new birth so if you haven't
[46:28] received a new birth if you're not
[46:30] abiding in him then you're a sinner
[46:34] you're of the devil that's that's just
[46:37] the bottom line
[46:38] you belong to the devil until you give
[46:41] your heart to God and God comes in and
[46:43] lives in you then you become his and
[46:46] that's a very simplistic way of putting
[46:48] it
[46:48] that's God's approval of you by putting
[46:51] his spirit in you but if you haven't
[46:53] done that you're still in this snake
[46:55] nature you are of the devil that's just
[46:58] plain and simple you commit sin you're
[47:01] of the devil and of course we all were
[47:04] born unbelievers we all were born
[47:08] without the capacity at that time to to
[47:13] believe that's why again I had the
[47:15] little thing children go to heaven amen
[47:17] they may not go on the rapture but they
[47:19] all go into heaven because they yet have
[47:22] the capacity to do so but he that
[47:25] committeth sin is of the devil
[47:27] so so when we're born of this nature all
[47:32] of us sin your very desire came from
[47:38] your soul the scene of free will to sin
[47:44] the scene of free will caused you to sin
[47:48] that nature reflected in your spirit and
[47:53] then into your body because it came from
[47:56] your soul and that sin coming from your
[48:00] soul free moral agent as a free will
[48:02] come from your soul dear spirit into
[48:06] your body that that is who you were you
[48:10] were a sinner period now we're not as
[48:16] born-again sons and daughters of God we
[48:19] are not sinners although we're the only
[48:22] ones that can sin make a mistake
[48:25] it's like saying is well I don't see
[48:31] anything like it but this
[48:33] how much how much of this Bible covers
[48:36] black well it's all black it's not a
[48:41] sinner it's just not it's not pretending
[48:43] to be black it's just black this is what
[48:45] it is
[48:46] sinners just do what they are they're
[48:49] not sending they're just living their
[48:50] lives they're just doing what they are
[48:51] the believers sins so we're gonna call
[48:54] sinners anymore because we're born again
[48:57] of the seed of God so look now
[49:01] originally your sin comes from your
[49:04] soldier nature your free will to sin to
[49:07] live it up to do whatever but look at
[49:11] the process he the committeth sin is of
[49:14] the devil for the devil sinneth from the
[49:17] beginning for this purpose for this
[49:22] purpose the sin the unbelief for this
[49:25] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[49:27] that he might destroy the works of the
[49:32] devil now what's the works of the devil
[49:34] now there's an S at the end of that what
[49:36] is those words what are the works of the
[49:39] devil
[49:40] well there's one work that I know of but
[49:43] let's go over to the Galatians real
[49:46] quick read these couple of verses of
[49:48] Scripture Galatians chapter 5 let's
[49:53] begin with verse 19 it says now the
[49:55] works of the flesh are manifest works of
[49:59] the flesh or what are the works of the
[50:02] flesh the works of the flesh are the
[50:04] works of the devil
[50:05] because that's where the devil works
[50:08] remember even when you're born again
[50:11] even when you're filled with the Holy
[50:13] Spirit the only places that Satan can
[50:16] access is your body in your spirit
[50:18] because he can no longer access your
[50:20] soul so it's still these still parts of
[50:24] your body your body or your your being
[50:26] your body your spirit still access by
[50:28] the devil so the works of the flesh yes
[50:33] the works of the devil are manifest
[50:37] which are these adultery fornication
[50:40] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[50:43] witchcraft
[50:45] hatred variance emulations wrath strife
[50:50] seditions heresies envyings murders
[50:53] drunkenness revellings and such like
[50:58] that's the work of the flesh now one in
[51:02] here like people want to do this this
[51:03] this but how about that hatred part how
[51:06] much hatred do people have for other
[51:07] people my teacher do you have for your
[51:10] enemy you better not hate your enemy you
[51:12] better love your enemy you better do
[51:14] good your enemy you better pray for them
[51:16] and if you love them unconditionally I
[51:18] don't see how they can be an enemy
[51:19] anyway but they might treat you as an
[51:21] enemy but you're not there that they're
[51:23] not your enemy because they're they're
[51:25] not that's your brother that's your
[51:28] sister when we identify the spirit and
[51:31] what happens in the spirit and what
[51:33] takes place in the spirit those are the
[51:35] that is the works of the flesh so what
[51:39] John is saying here for this purpose of
[51:42] some of those manifesting you might
[51:43] destroy the works of the devil so now if
[51:47] you're born again one of the works of
[51:50] the devil take place here the works of
[51:53] the flesh are right here in the body and
[51:55] even in the spirit because the spirit
[51:57] would try to bring things back up from
[51:59] your life or pervert your affection or
[52:01] try to bring back into memory things you
[52:03] used to live in your old life but and
[52:05] affect your body but but the body is the
[52:10] things that we look at is the works of
[52:12] the flesh are the works of the devil and
[52:14] Jesus Christ was manifested to destroy
[52:17] the works plural but what is that work
[52:20] what is it that brings each one of those
[52:23] attributes into being unbelief you do
[52:27] those things because you don't believe
[52:29] you do those things because you have in
[52:31] your free will you still have the wrong
[52:33] nature and you desire your very desire
[52:37] is to do that is to live that way to be
[52:39] that kind of person and that's why you
[52:41] do it that's why people out here do it
[52:43] we judge people and we condemn people we
[52:46] do all these other things to people out
[52:48] of the world today it's hard to see
[52:50] things in
[52:52] and it hurts your hearts avec les yeux
[52:54] you know they could be
[52:55] that's a soul that's where ten million
[52:58] worlds that you'd like to reward to
[53:00] bring back to Jesus Christ but that's
[53:03] all based on God's predestination of God
[53:06] as you go witness to that person
[53:07] whatever you do it but otherwise that's
[53:09] that that that's in God's hands that's
[53:11] up to God it hurts to see but we condemn
[53:13] it all but they're just doing what they
[53:15] are they condemn and look down on us as
[53:19] Christians as born-again sons and
[53:22] daughters of God they look down on us
[53:23] they think say all kinds of things
[53:26] against us
[53:26] but we can't help but do what's in us to
[53:29] do we just live who we are that's all we
[53:33] can do
[53:33] we're God God's children we're sons and
[53:37] daughters were born of the Spirit were
[53:38] led of his Spirit so we live a life
[53:40] because that's what we are that's what
[53:43] we do Jesus was manifested he might
[53:47] destroy the works of the devil
[53:49] whosoever listen now ix first whosoever
[53:52] is born of God does not commit sin now
[53:58] up here in the what was it the sixth in
[54:06] the sixth verse he said whosoever
[54:09] abideth in him sin and not but now in
[54:12] the night first he said whoever is born
[54:15] of God does not commit sin so if you're
[54:18] born of God you do not commit sin for
[54:21] his seed his seed remaineth in him and
[54:26] he cannot sin because he is born of God
[54:30] so what's John talking about what is it
[54:34] that God is a counting or not accounting
[54:37] to us what is it that we think well if I
[54:40] made a mistake I've done something wrong
[54:42] or I've transgressed God's Word we go
[54:44] and apologize we repent and we ask God
[54:47] to forgive us you think oh well have I
[54:49] crossed over the line have I done it to
[54:52] where God won't forgive me anymore don't
[54:54] or think like that because in the
[54:58] beginning your soul your freewill
[55:01] dictated to you to sin it was your
[55:04] nature to want to sin but after you were
[55:06] born again the mistakes that we make the
[55:09] slip-ups the the the shortcomings come
[55:13] from here come from your body in their
[55:16] spirit
[55:16] you see cuz John is making a very stark
[55:20] difference between the sin that we had
[55:22] in the flesh the sin that we had when we
[55:25] were not born again the sin that people
[55:27] still live when they're not born again a
[55:31] stark contrast between those that are
[55:34] born again so what's John st. John
[55:37] saying over here that you can sin if you
[55:39] said you haven't sinned that you're
[55:40] you're a liar
[55:41] man over here he's saying that if you
[55:44] are born of God you cannot sin so so the
[55:49] balance of understanding what John is
[55:51] talking about is realizing one of
[55:54] without the new birth and the person
[55:56] with the new birth a person without the
[55:59] new birth sins from there because what
[56:02] is God concerned with what is what is it
[56:05] God's looking at he's looking at the
[56:07] soul he's looking at the innermost
[56:09] inside beam that's what he's concerned
[56:12] about that's what God looks for his
[56:14] Bloods got the blood ran around the
[56:16] earth that's taking care of the things
[56:18] in the body in the spirit we accept him
[56:20] that's done away with
[56:21] remember blessed is the man to whom God
[56:23] will not impute sin Romans 8:1 says
[56:27] there is therefore now you gonna read
[56:30] the end of chapter seven and in chapter
[56:33] 8 verse 1 and see were the turmoil that
[56:37] Jonathan Paul was heading between being
[56:40] born again and living in this flesh and
[56:42] still having the stickiness of this
[56:44] flesh he said the things that don't want
[56:46] to do if I myself doing the things I
[56:49] want to do is the things I don't do so
[56:52] what do I find he says when I do good
[56:54] evil is always present he always in
[56:57] himself explaining an understanding the
[57:01] battle that every one of us go through
[57:03] between the new birth and being born
[57:06] and still making mistakes still doing
[57:09] still slipping up still sinning still
[57:12] things that we know we should do now
[57:13] when the Spirit of God come remember
[57:16] every man that had this hope in him
[57:18] purifies himself now there's the
[57:22] difference if you make a mistake here
[57:24] it's a mistake slip-up
[57:26] you caught the trap or something but
[57:29] it's not from the soul he's talking
[57:31] about a new birth a seed that seed that
[57:36] remaineth that's another reason that i
[57:38] believe it is this that it didn't just
[57:41] drop in there when you heard the word
[57:42] the seed that remainings well if it
[57:45] remains that mean it was already there
[57:48] wolf is already there it stays there it
[57:51] just continues on that seed just
[57:54] eventually comes to life so when that
[57:57] seed remains there in him he can not see
[58:02] him why because he's born of God now
[58:06] does that make your flesh perfect no
[58:08] it's still in the process remember it's
[58:12] still it's it's been potentially
[58:14] redeemed yes we're going on or in the
[58:18] process just like the heir of this we're
[58:20] still in the process but the fullness of
[58:23] that redemption of the body's not going
[58:25] to happen till we get a body change
[58:27] going to rapture
[58:28] so yeah the stickiness of this flesh
[58:30] still happens there's still things that
[58:33] we do but you're no longer now now on
[58:36] this conversely now if you if you if in
[58:41] your soul you have a desire to just go
[58:44] light up the bars and live that kind of
[58:47] life then that shows there has a bit of
[58:48] change but if you make the mistake or
[58:51] slip up or something or do something
[58:52] wrong and in your heart in your soul
[58:54] there's something there conviction says
[58:57] you know you should have done that you
[58:58] know that wasn't you make it right
[59:00] you make it right quickly that shows
[59:02] there's something in you the same that's
[59:04] not right you know it's not and then you
[59:07] do and then you move forward from there
[59:10] because that's been justified that's in
[59:14] God see if forgive when she never did
[59:15] that never existed you know used to make
[59:18] the statement is as far as darkness is
[59:20] for light frame but that's wrong it's
[59:22] not even as far as darkness is from
[59:24] light because this doesn't exist at all
[59:26] it's not even in darkness because it's
[59:27] not there doesn't exist crazy in the
[59:31] mind of God doesn't exist no wonder you
[59:34] can't send no wonder
[59:35] blessed is the man whom God will not
[59:37] impute sin there is therefore now no
[59:39] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[59:42] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[59:45] after the spirit
[59:47] what's that spirit not to human spirits
[59:49] but the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit
[59:51] that now is the permanent resident of
[59:53] your soul we don't walk by the flesh we
[59:56] walk by the spirit that soul influences
[59:59] the spirit that spirit influence is the
[1:00:02] body and the times get the way but I
[1:00:05] wanted to read this to you here and now
[1:00:07] this isn't who is this mo hesitate
[1:00:11] February 1965 my man said he that he
[1:00:16] that's born of God does not commit sin
[1:00:19] and I actually didn't even read that
[1:00:20] quote that scripture in the tenth verse
[1:00:23] in this the new birth the children of
[1:00:27] God are manifest and the children of
[1:00:30] devil whosoever does not righteousness
[1:00:32] is not of God neither he that loveth not
[1:00:35] his brother amen
[1:00:37] so in this the children of God are born
[1:00:39] cannot sin he that is born of God does
[1:00:43] not commit sin he can not sin again
[1:00:47] what's the operative word there birth
[1:00:51] born
[1:00:52] amen born of God new birth go back to
[1:00:55] Peter the new birth of incorruptible
[1:00:59] seed the seed that remained it their
[1:01:02] incorruptible seed a new birth a that is
[1:01:05] born of God does not commit sin he
[1:01:07] cannot see in Romans 8:1 there is
[1:01:09] therefore now no condemnation to them in
[1:01:12] Christ Jesus they walk not after the
[1:01:14] flesh but after the spirit there you are
[1:01:17] see that throws your body subject you
[1:01:21] don't have to say oh if I could just
[1:01:24] quit drinking if I could just quit
[1:01:25] smoking no just get into Christ and it's
[1:01:28] all gone it's like we
[1:01:30] and earlier he said well how do you know
[1:01:32] get it and you'll know that's that's
[1:01:36] easiest thing I know to tell you if
[1:01:38] people say well how do you know get it
[1:01:40] and you'll know if you don't know I
[1:01:41] doubt you have it because your body is
[1:01:45] subject to the spirit your body is
[1:01:47] subject to the spirit it is no more
[1:01:50] subject to the things of the world
[1:01:52] although it is influenced by the things
[1:01:54] of the world it's not subject to the
[1:01:56] things of the world to do the things of
[1:01:58] the world although it is influenced by
[1:02:01] the things of the world they are dead
[1:02:04] they are dead your sins are buried in
[1:02:06] Baptism and you are a new creature in
[1:02:08] Christ your body is becoming subject to
[1:02:12] the spirit listen now this amen we're
[1:02:16] not we're not perfect beings jesus said
[1:02:19] be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:02:20] father in heaven is perfect as a mature
[1:02:22] Christian amen
[1:02:24] even a mature Christian say that brother
[1:02:26] branham still made mistakes still did
[1:02:29] things wrong I bring up the example of
[1:02:32] him having his wife lied to the RS agent
[1:02:34] all the time is a mistake God even
[1:02:37] called demony when he went to pray for
[1:02:38] the girl take your hands off that baby
[1:02:40] you're not fit to pray for her C had his
[1:02:43] own little girl say picked up the phone
[1:02:44] said daddy let me tell them you're not
[1:02:46] here it's easy doesn't mean you're
[1:02:49] perfect sinless perfect but mature but
[1:02:52] even mature Christians in this sticky
[1:02:54] flesh make mistakes your body but your
[1:02:58] body is becoming subject to the spirit
[1:03:01] to try to live a right kind of life and
[1:03:06] there you go if there's not a desire to
[1:03:09] want to or try to live a right kind of
[1:03:12] life then I doubt very seriously you had
[1:03:14] the right kind of spirit I doubt very
[1:03:16] seriously you've been born again but if
[1:03:19] you have the desire to walk to and you
[1:03:22] try to and you press forward into that
[1:03:25] not not just to say well you know I
[1:03:28] somebody tried and tried and couldn't
[1:03:31] get it well how did they try I mean I
[1:03:34] cried and prayed and went to the altar
[1:03:36] 100 times well if you went the first
[1:03:40] time you shouldn't have gone the second
[1:03:41] time
[1:03:42] I mean not not for that purpose anyways
[1:03:44] nothing wrong with going to an altar but
[1:03:46] the altars your heart if you've got to
[1:03:48] trust God and God's cleansed you then
[1:03:52] he's done his part if there's a hiccup
[1:03:54] in there don't belong to God it belongs
[1:03:56] to you but but I'm saying that there's a
[1:03:59] desire there and God has taken control
[1:04:02] of that soul and and that desire of your
[1:04:04] soul now is to do what's right and to do
[1:04:07] the things you know godly in them by the
[1:04:08] scripture and that and that spirit is
[1:04:11] taking you and changing you and making
[1:04:14] you more into his image that we're
[1:04:16] growing into that see this body is
[1:04:19] getting to that place this body is
[1:04:21] coming to that place to where it will
[1:04:24] eventually get to the place to where
[1:04:25] just like it did with you know it was so
[1:04:28] much like God that God took him home
[1:04:30] we're going to get to the same place at
[1:04:33] the right time at the right place amen
[1:04:36] by faith God is bringing us to that
[1:04:39] place but you don't look at it based on
[1:04:42] the flesh based on the deception of the
[1:04:46] flesh you look at it based on the new
[1:04:49] birth and what God's done for you well
[1:04:52] we're going to continue to make mistakes
[1:04:55] and do things wrong but the closer we
[1:04:57] get to God the less of those we do the
[1:05:00] more we become like God the less of
[1:05:02] those things happen the more the more in
[1:05:05] His image we get through that new birth
[1:05:08] the new birth there's no sin you cannot
[1:05:12] sin we're here because this is the real
[1:05:16] you now always has been but we just come
[1:05:19] to the acknowledgement other than
[1:05:21] understanding of it this has always been
[1:05:23] us
[1:05:24] I've always been me but we just come to
[1:05:26] that understanding but it throws all
[1:05:29] this into subjection then amen it brings
[1:05:33] us all into the place to say well I used
[1:05:35] to stand yeah well used to sin because
[1:05:38] your desire was for the things of the
[1:05:40] world your soul commanded you your your
[1:05:43] nature commanded you to sin but when you
[1:05:46] were born again then the things that
[1:05:48] take over then the only way that you sin
[1:05:52] you make mistake trip fall stumble is
[1:05:55] because of the body it's in the flesh
[1:05:59] those things are accounted to God that's
[1:06:01] already done that's already the blood of
[1:06:05] Jesus Christ covers that the Bible says
[1:06:08] he first he so loved the world that He
[1:06:10] gave His only begotten Son
[1:06:11] well he loved the world where do we come
[1:06:13] from we came from the world we came from
[1:06:15] this earth we should say we came from
[1:06:18] this earth we did come from cosmos we
[1:06:19] come from this this earth God so loved
[1:06:22] he gave His only begotten Son
[1:06:24] the who should I believe in him the NEM
[1:06:26] shall not perish but never ever lasting
[1:06:28] like that that blood man is still there
[1:06:30] and that's that that's been taken care
[1:06:33] of God son that's not the concern the
[1:06:35] concern is in this soul we're not here
[1:06:39] to make church members we're not here to
[1:06:42] amplify some kind of a gift we're not
[1:06:45] here to try to get people to have big
[1:06:48] numbers we're here to be sons and
[1:06:51] daughters of God born again get people
[1:06:54] to Christ not just to justification not
[1:06:58] just to sanctification not just to a
[1:07:01] baptism or an anointing but through the
[1:07:04] indwelling presence of Christ in their
[1:07:06] life and if that predestinated seed is
[1:07:09] there it remains there it's still there
[1:07:13] it stays there it just comes to life
[1:07:15] it's not a scene anymore and those that
[1:07:19] are mature Christian is just not a scene
[1:07:20] anymore it's now putting forth fruit
[1:07:23] it's a full grown tree if you will
[1:07:25] that's putting forth fruit that's living
[1:07:28] a life of godly life because that's the
[1:07:30] nature of the scene amen do we make
[1:07:33] mistakes sure we do do we fall and get
[1:07:37] tripped up sure we do but the closer we
[1:07:39] get to God and the more we get like God
[1:07:41] the list of those things happen amen
[1:07:44] because we are sons and daughters of God
[1:07:46] I can go back real quick beloved now are
[1:07:53] we the sons of God now are we this
[1:07:57] Oh God and it's not something anything
[1:08:00] that I've done it's what he did and I
[1:08:02] just accepted it I just accepted and it
[1:08:04] received it on on his behalf but he did
[1:08:07] it and he did it for us that we meet the
[1:08:10] children of God it leads us from that
[1:08:13] justification from the chicken yard the
[1:08:16] sanctification to the cleansing up to
[1:08:18] filling it amen to the filling it of the
[1:08:22] Holy Spirit doesn't do any good to just
[1:08:25] have water on the outside of the glass
[1:08:27] doesn't do any good just to anoint the
[1:08:29] glass on the outside that comes to the
[1:08:31] baptism and that comes with the process
[1:08:33] of sanctification but when you fill it
[1:08:36] there's the difference that's when that
[1:08:38] glass is in operation now when it's
[1:08:41] being cleansed or it's under that
[1:08:42] anointing oh it can look and act just
[1:08:45] like the genuine just like the real but
[1:08:49] it won't and can't live that word word
[1:08:52] by word amen
[1:08:54] there's a difference in sinning making
[1:08:57] mistakes fault and willfully sinning a
[1:09:00] person who looks at and said well I
[1:09:02] don't care I'm gonna do it anyway well I
[1:09:03] doubt your desire has changed amen
[1:09:06] praise the Lord well god bless you again
[1:09:10] appreciate each one of you being here
[1:09:12] with us today I pray something was said
[1:09:14] to bless and strengthen you in some way

[1:09:27] I think it will be looks like the things
[1:09:30] are calming down but you know friend to
[1:09:32] me it's kind of just it's kind of just a
[1:09:36] little sign of a beginning of things
[1:09:38] that's happening maybe this year maybe
[1:09:41] 10 years maybe 15 years we don't know
[1:09:43] maybe tomorrow but always be ready amen
