church started he said that she woke up with some nerve pain in her shoulder asked us that we would pray for her thank you buddy so let's pray please remember sisters I also got a text from Sister Matisse uh and the gentleman that we actually had here came to church one time when we were over on Cortaro his name was Derek sister Matisse has talked to him for a long time introduced to the message and he saw that he plays him a lot but he hadn't been back to church since then but he's moving out of town and I guess Matisse is helping him this morning so she's not going to be with us today but appreciate each one of you being here with us today sister Norma has a couple of prayer requests here please pray for Daniel's Daughter Brooke her husband told Daniel she couldn't complete this she couldn't complete a sentence amen so I'm not sure what it might be if stroke maybe or something like that but Daniel Daniel McDaniel made the whole pit for us actually his sister and Roman son-in-law his daughter Brooke uh it's having problems completing the sentence talking I guess communicating so let's remember Brooke in prayer please pray for my husband uh Ronnie his health is going down and his vision seems to be getting worse amen amen but Tom knows Ronnie very well [Music] I pray if you could sister enormous husband health is deteriorating so let's remember him in prayer as well I mean anyone else have a prayer request something on your heart would you like to mention I am so sorry please forgive me as I didn't I was running late this morning didn't have time to write it down but um my sister went to the doctor this morning or this week and um they they're saying that she has stage two kidney disease and that her white blood cell count is high enough that they want her to see a hematologist so I don't know what's going on and then she has some kind of buyer or something on her hand and it's swollen and bruised and I just you know my family just they just need deliverance and they need to come to the Lord I'm going to pray for that for so long and I just I pray that this wakes her up and amen gets her in yes praise the Lord Jesus Kristen those of you probably most of us all know her she's she's helped us move church and everything she's never attended one single service but she's helped in almost every other way she pays her tithes faithfully and uh and like I said she's helped us move and with the driving the truck and everything and uh so she's done everything but actually come to a service so let's please remember her in prayer if you would sister Julius Julius anyone else have an unspoken three question Lord knows off the hearts today let's stand if we could I mean we'll take these Deeds to go Lord Jesus in prayer knowing that he hears and answer our prayers amen brother Dennis that you prayed for us Lord Jesus with all our hearts and reverence to the greatness the god that's created all things that's around us and then universe and yet you humbled yourself and you went to the cross and you died for our sins yes that we may have a way to receive thank you eternal life and now you come and abide in our hearts Lord and there's such a burden on My Heart Lord to see that why are we still here Lord I I heard your prophets say it should have taken a few days journey for the children of Israel to cross over into the promised land and it took him 40 years because of their unbelief God help us and father I researched it and experts said by the way they were traveling it should have taken 11 days and where are we at right now Lord are we compromising with the world we want to be identified with the world and yet we identified with you we cannot serve to master oh you know we love the one or hate the other lord it's time to totally commit Our Lives to you there's some that if they it can be a church and don't think about it and don't okay well I I'll go to church I got nothing else to do Lord where's the dedication where is the sincerity that's why we're wondering I believe in the wilderness of life right now Lord my heart's desire is to see the Rapture take place to be with you for eternity and Lord I can recall in the scriptures there was one man he thought it was all right to take a few gold trinkets oh wow yes and yet he caused the family of God at that time to fail as they were trying to defeat Miami yes Lord what are we holding on to are we holding on to some ungodly desire some trinket of unbelief maybe we want to show them you know we want to look pretty as the sisters painting ourselves and cutting our hair and doing things contrary to the word of God how about us Brothers Lord not taking the leadership not praying and trying to provide good leadership amongst the family Lord and just maybe joining in with some filthy jokes and filthy conversation and letting Our Testimony down by compromising with the world and then the word father oh help us Lord help us Lord as the prophet said if there's unconfessed sin in our lives we you a person can be Anointed with a gallon of oil and then sin this will stop you from giving that person the Deliverance they need and Lord help us to recognize the day and the hour that we're living in yes oh God let us confess our sins put together with blood and let there be power amongst your people there'll be demonstration and power as we call on your name Lord oh it's not time to uh play church it's not time to just take for granted that um I'll go to church and the rest of the week I'll just do my own thing when uh lust has conceived it bringeth forth sin and When sin is finished then bringeth forth death O Lord speak to our hearts because there are some real needs this morning there's people that need a healing touch others yes only you come unto scene and Grant him that heart's desire sister Norma yes perhaps several requests uh her husband and her our son-in-law's the daughter Lord and oh Lord we know you're mindful of the needs of your people for you are truly a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our employees and with your stripes we are healed We Believe total deliverance we serve a supernatural God we dwell into Supernatural when there's our lives are worthy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ yes and we believe that all I believe will scatter from this meeting from this church assembly and we claim total Deliverance yes for each and every one Hallelujah you need that raise their hand theirs are expecting a touch whatever they have seen them from you Lord bless our pastor Lord amen neighbors Faithfully to bring forth your word use them to speak to our hearts May our hearts be open to receive your word yes judgment begins at the house of God if it begin with us where should it be for them that don't obey the gospel oh god oh Father speak to our heart granted we want to be always on fire always willing to do what you have called us to do to be a witness to live our lives for you to put you first in everything in your name we pray in the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you like then always forget uh always forget things that's on my heart to mention as far as prayer requests um we had a good trip like I said me and Sonya did but we would like to ask you to pray for us uh the main reason we went there was to find a headstone for our son our first son who passed away after 36 and a half hours and uh finally got the means ability to do it but the one that we want the most the one that Sonia basically I mean pretty much that's what we want is is not in stock anymore they don't make it nobody wants it I guess so uh it's very difficult to get so we're looking for someone either locally in the states that can carve granite or we'll have to get it from overseas somewhere and the lady said it could look like a lamb or it could look like a dog so we're we're kind of we're a little bit stuck right now so we appreciate your prayers the Lord will just find something somebody uh without you know charging five thousand dollars for a little Tombstone that can Harbor granite and we can have that so that's kind of what we really want so I appreciate your prayers about that and uh also I appreciate your prayers I'm going back out again this afternoon um I'm not flying this time though our job is in El Paso this week so I'm driving so I'll be going to the airport and pick up a rental car and driving to El Paso so but things can go just as crazy wrong with the devil trying to intervene is in the cards that count on a plane so you know prayers about that as well so I appreciate the Lord's goodness to us now if anyone else have a testimony in your heart yes sister I don't know if any of you have ever ever used um the elements so anyway I don't have a garage so I've used a card cup a few years and in my area of town the wind is just so strong and whipping tone this morning I was attempting to take this off and then it's really fighting against the wind very almost look impossible yeah and all of a sudden I just I just said to say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ calm wind call amen the second time in just a few seconds and then it calmed enough for me to take it off before it started ripping again amen well praise the Lord amen yes yes praise the Lord yes it's bad up here too amen so praise the Lord anyone else amen praise the lord well we have a uh one more song I want to sing before we change the world of the service here Jesus signed my partner Psalm number 600 in the book there we'll have it on the screen

save a Wretch like Me Yeah amen praise the Lord Jesus amen God bless you let's stand to our feet if we could now amen will change your of the service praise the Lord we're gonna go into the last segment amen of this that we've been on for I guess a few months now amen the new beginning part 22. a new beginning part 22. so we'll turn over in the rivals to Genesis chapter 1 read verses one and two again here amen hope and pray that through this study through this uh uh series that the Lord has blessed somebody help somebody in some way and maybe shown some things that haven't been seen before maybe opened up some dialogue some questions some things that we don't know for sure just taking sometimes from the scripture from what brother random said just trying to tie some things together to see what the Lord has in store for us amen I'm looking forward to that aren't you yes amen that new city praise the Lord Genesis 1 read the first couple of verses before we do low vesters for our history word of Prayer precious Lord Jesus father is such a privilege to be here again in the house of God thanking you for this place Lord thank you for this time for each one that has come those who may be streaming Lord we're just trusting you for all things today and Lord as we know that you are with us God because you promise that we're truthy are gathered you promise it you would never leave us or forsake us you promise it you would always be with us Lord that we know that you are here God right now to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we can ever ask or think even think Lord and thank you God for that because we know that Lord we come with great expectation and knowing what your word says and what you've told us Lord we can have those expectations and we can expect them to be met because you are more God than able to to produce any of these things that we have need of today we thank you for it Lord we thank you God for this word for the revelation of the word for the message that's coming this hour yes thank you for a life that was lived through our Prophet Lord that would shun everything but getting this word out and Lord getting that word out to a to a bride for this last day so important for us to see and know and listen and hear and speak to us through it father Yes Lord it encourages us it blesses us it strengthens us through it it gives us revelation of your word Lord it gives us help and hope and know God that there's nothing of any discouragement that we can have because we know that you make everything work together for our good because we love you Lord Lord we thank you God for all that you do for us every day we pray and we rebuke every demonic spirit in here whether to try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done Lord and we pray that what can be said today hearing through the word Lord that God it would accomplish whatever you have it sent forth for Lord let this this service serve the purpose that you have pre-ordained for it to today for each one of us guys we commit it to you now and as the remaining part of this service your blessings upon it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Genesis chapter one read the first couple of verses here again in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness upon the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters you could be seated if you'd like amen praise the Lord as I said this would be the last uh this will be the last part that we have here to bring to you part 22 New Beginning and again I pray that something was said to be a help and a blessing to each one of you but let's turn over to Revelation chapter 21. amen and we'll finish this up by reading a couple of verses and we'll finish on those Gates and manage your turn in there I'll go ahead and grab this uh I'll probably draw this up just one more time I had kind of done it before before started getting into the into the foundations and the gates and we finished up with the foundations the other day and this uh that we had here the breast slate increase the office at that time amen but we'll try to see the Lord willing how we can put this up to finish this off now let's start uh let's just read Revelation 12 and 13 and then we'll drop down to 21 which uh puts us on those Gates we'll talk about that here and finish this up today Revelation 21 12 and had a wall great and high and had 12 gates and at the gates 12 angels and the names written thereon which are the names of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel and on the East three gates and on the north three gates on the south three gates on the west three gates now let's drop down to the 21st verse here and the 12 gates were 12 pearls every several gate was of one Pearl we talked about that last week amen or last time every every gate was of one Pearl several again the several just means each gate Each One Singular gate uh as it's saying that this is uh versus uh some entryways that may have uh uh a bifold doors or two doors that would open this is just one gate and it's just one several games to itself of one Pearl amen and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass now Less in in reference as we go through this uh I just got a little bit more to give to you on this uh in reference to this the the 12th verse uh and the 13th verse really let's go over to Ezekiel chapter 48. amen I told you we look at what the the size of these Gates now we talked about the size of the walls how big the walls are going to be basically on the scripture of How High the wall would be and we don't know for sure because I had not been able to find any place in the scripture that tells us how high the gates are but Ezekiel 48 does tell us how big they are or or in essence how wide they are so let's go to Ezekiel chapter 48 and we'll begin reading with verse 30. Ezekiel 48 verse 30. foreign amen read it through and then we'll go back and talk about it for just a moment and these are the goings out of the city on the North side 4500 measures now it's talking about each side having four thousand five hundred measures now a measure uh is is not uh per se an Old Testament measurement uh cubits is the most well used measurement of the Old Testament and a cubit is approximately 18 inches give or take a little again uh we don't work in in the exact inches or the sixteenth of an inch uh we're just talking about these as approximate sizes just as we've done through the entire chapter uh of Revelation 21. but it's approximately a cubit is approximately 21 inches so when he's talking about a measure the best I can find when it's talking about a measure it's talking about a cubit so as it says four thousand five hundred measures basically four thousand five hundred cubits is the opening on the North side amen now uh when I first read this I read it wrong uh I I got it uh I got I got it messed up on the size of the gates uh but as I read through this it'll probably become clear to you because I started to believe that each gate was four thousand five hundred measures but that's not true each opening on each side accumulative is four thousand five hundred measures amen and being about 18 inches uh 4 500 measures is approximately a mile and a half amen just so that you understand each one of those openings now let me just continue to read on so that uh it may become a little light to you even before I even say anything else four thousand five hundred measures and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel now remember we talked about the gates and the foundations uh including both Jew and Gentile on each one amen as each gate is a pearl amen which represents the Gentile bride which we'll go into a little bit later each Pearl representing the Gentile bride in each gate of 1 Pearl is the name of one of each of the 12 tribes of Israel the gates of the city shall be shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel three gates northward one gate of Reuben one gate of Judah one gate of Levi and on the east side 4 500 and three gates three gates within the 4 500 measures and one gate of Joseph one gate of Benjamin one gate of dam and at the South Side 4 500 measures and three gates one of Simeon one of issachar one gate of zebulun at the West Side four thousand five hundred was their three gates one gate of GAD one gate of Asher one gate of Napoli it was around it was around about about 18 000 measures and the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there amen that's probably the best part I like to me the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there amen but verse 35 is what uh caught my attention because if you make every gate 4 500 measures then the entirety of the gates is 54 000 measures but the 35th verse says that it's only eighteen thousand measures which makes each side 4 500 measures so if you take each gate and you divide it up between the 4 500 measures that makes each gate approximately 2200 feet a little less than half a mile so each gate that we have here and I'll try to it's going to be crude because I'm I'm doing this quickly of course uh each gate so this is the city the pyramid the wall that's around it each side has three gates the openings on each side and remember the openings account for the entirety of the openings all three account for 4 500 measures so if you divide that up that's 1500 measures per day so each gate is 1500 measures wide if you do the math then each measures approximately 18 inches that's 2200 feet that's a little less than half a mile so each one of these Gates is a little less than half a mile long uh that seems like a a pretty sizable gate and it is but when you think about the entire side here being approximately 1500 miles a half a mile for each gate or a little less than a half a mile is actually not that not that big uh I thought about it and I'm gonna give you my opinion in my opinion I believe these Gates will slide to the side I don't think they'll open uh like this I personally think ah this has nothing to do with scripture has nothing to do with what brother Brown says this is my opinion now you might have your opinion and that's there's nothing wrong with that if you think they uh swing open then that's fine you're entitled to that I personally think that these Gates will slide to the side A lot of times what they call them barn doors now or something a lot of people ask you one of that in their homes now uh for their bathrooms and stuff me and me and my wife just stayed in a hotel and that's what their bathroom door was it just it slid to the side it was out outside the wall and that door just slid to the side and made me think I I I I love the opinion that's probably how these are going to be rather than trying to swing on hinges I think they just slide but they're they're pretty big nevertheless when you figure a little less than half a mile for each gate those are pretty big Gates but each side has an accumulative opening of 4 500 measures now we know these gates are to be open all the time the Bible says uh we'll probably finish up our with this and reading the whole thing over again but it tells us that that these Gates will be open all the time they'll be open day and night amen for those that come from outside the city come and bring in the the leaves for the healing of the Nations and and paying honor and tribute to amen just like we know that the foundations are garnished as a tribute just like the names are written these pearls as a tribute these things are all tributes in response and and an acknowledgment of the great God that has brought it all together that has brought not just the Gentiles to this place but Jew and Gentile brother Branham said again that this is for the Overcomer not just to the Gentile Bradford but for those who overcome amen amen and he lets us know by each one of these how God is including his people peculiar people and his bride that he's bringing them together Amen to to represent this and these gates are one of those things so these Gates approximately eight uh approximately a little less than a mile each amen made of one Pearl now what is uh when you look up a pearl it's not difficult to understand what a pearl is but the scripture speaks about uh about Pearl the importance of a pearl what a what a pearl is how a pearl comes to be because it's it's God that does it I mean it's God that uh brings has the gold out here people just go dig it up God's the one that put the silver out here people just dig it up the God made the oyster to where he creates these pearls they're they're beautiful diamonds out of the ground those all come from God man just discovered them and considered them precious and and and sometimes rare but God's the one that made them so they're all belong to him so but a pearl is is pretty fairly self-explanatory but when you talk about uh uh a metaphor if you will of a pearl uh the the concordance says the Pearl is also considered a word of great value a pearl is considered a word of Great Value praise the Lord now what is it to God that is a that that today is a word of Great Value now we know his word is of Great Value absolutely amen but what word is it today that God has all down through history through the churches but we're talking about right now today that God has that is a word of great value let's go over to Matthew uh and let's read in Matthew chapter 13. Matthew 13 44. let's look at what Jesus talks about this Pearl how important it is of this Pearl what this Pearl means what this Pearl represents it's not just something to say well it's of one Pearl I mean this must have been a huge oyster or wherever it came from God creates whatever he wants he doesn't have to God does not have to use an oyster to make a pearl you understand that so amen but a pearl of what of what importance is it that these gates are of pearl we talked about this last time in a lot of the songs and a lot of the uh the the old ancient way of thinking about uh uh Jesus giving giving peace the keys to the kingdom and and and Peter standing at the Pearly gate looking for your name on a book or something it's amazing what the carnal mind can can come up with when you think about actual realities and truths of the scripture and get them so scrupled up that they really don't even amount to what the scripture is telling us be trust me when we get to this place Peter will not be standing here at the gate waiting for your uh uh entrance papers to open and unlock the key so that you can get into the Pearly Gates amen that that will not be happening here amen but you understand the way that the the mentality of humans and thinking the way they go Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 44. again now look what Jesus said again the kingdom of heaven now look how important it is to recognize uh the 10 play I believe is 10 places that Jesus speaks up here in Matthew that he Likens unto the kingdom of heaven we also know like uh Matthew 25 the ten virgins Jesus said it is likened unto Heaven five Wise by foolish well this is one of those places where Jesus Likens his Parable here to the kingdom of heaven now the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field a treasure hidden a field the witch meant when when a man hath found he hideth uh he hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and sell us all he have and buy it that field amen now we've got in this this one verse let's just read the 45th verse 2. again the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a merchant man selling goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it now notice this man has done the exact same perform the exact same uh ritual if you will to to redeem both classes the hidden treasure uh the the the peculiar treasure the The Treasure of great value and the pearl of great value this man has performed the same Act to redeem or to purchase the treasure and The Pearl it's not a different act it's the same thing that he does for one he does for the other now who does God consider his peculiar treasure let's look at the scripture here Psalms chapter 135 I think I got it here Psalms 135 and 4. look at this for the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself Israel which would be the father patriarch of the of the 12 tribes of Israel which we talk about hear the names on the on the Pearl on the Pearly Gates Jacob look for the Lord had chosen Jacob unto himself and Israel that's his people amen that's God's chosen people Israel was God's chosen people for his peculiar treasure God has picked Jacob God has chosen Jacob and Israel well Jacob is Israel but what he's talking about is Jacob and his posterity his children the 12 tribes of Israel from which all come forth and issue out of whose names as we know have written on each one of these 12 pearls Gates of pearl God has chosen him as what peculiar treasure now Jesus said heaven is like unto a man uh who found a great treasure and what did he do when he found this great treasure he let everything else go he saw all that he hath to buy that field of great treasure amen sold everything you had what does that mean that means he gave everything he had he gave us all he gave everything he could give to obtain this treasure to purchase this treasure there's I say to redeem this treasure praise God he did everything he could do and that was Diet Calvary to give his life to shed his blood that they could find Salvation amen and not only that but on that day he went to hell and he took the keys and he let captivity captive and he let them loose and they came and appeared before many here on Earth and his Ascension they went with him praise the Lord that great treasure that he sold all that he had to give but now notice he did the exact same act one act amen not to God didn't do one act to purchase the treasure and one actor purchased the Pearl no it's one act look at this the Kingdom of Heaven is likely to a merchant man seeking goodly pearls when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it he gave everything he had he sold everything he had he gave everything that he is could be he gave all that he had he gave himself he selleth or he dieth you purchased that Pearl amen amen amen the same Act of redemption was for Israel it was for his chosen people as much as it was for his Gentile bride praise God the one act of selling everything he had of giving all that he had to purchased that treasure to purchase that Pearl amen amen praise the Lord so God did the exact same thing that one act that help not only save a lost and dying people a gentile people that was not even a people you know we weren't even a people right we weren't even acknowledged we weren't even recognized and in the spirit realm and in the eyes of God meant absolutely nothing right God common through this act he found something of great value a word a word of great value praise the Lord a word a pearl a word of great wisdom a word of Great Value what is the bride become today she's become him who is he he is the word yes and she's become the word of Great Value that he sold all that he had he gave everything he could give he died so that you could live yes he shed his blood so you can have Redemption amen now it's completely annihilated now not only did he do that as we would call it today paying forward but he did it for those all that came up that didn't have that Redemption right all those that were under the blood of bulls and goats all those were under the the sacrifices of the Old Testament which God accepted for that day but not a good enough for Redemption it took a Redemptive plan of Jesus Christ the man that could actually purchase it amen just like I said none of us could have purchased it none of us had we couldn't have paid it there's no way we could pay that debt there's no human John even had the book in Revelation 5 and he looked around and there was nobody found worthy not even John himself amen amen and he began to cry because nobody could open that book nobody was worthy to loose those seals to really reveal those names to show The Plan of Redemption nobody could do it no man until the lamb stepped forth yes amen he looked around and he saw bloody lamb what was that Bloody lamb that was the price that was paid for the Redemption of this treasure in this Pearl you've got this pearl of Great Value this word of wisdom the bride is becoming the word of great wisdom of great value to God you my friend were of such great value to God and he gave all that he had for you very much he gave everything he could give yes there was nothing else that Jesus Christ could have done he could not have given any more than himself yeah his life his blood but you were of such great value to him he was willing to do it amen amen praise God aren't you thankful that God saw you with that great value how many of you look in the mirror in the morning and see a great value I don't I try to I said God help me look through your eyes so I can see what you see and I look and I see this same ugly God every day I think my what was it in this man that God saw that made him want to go to Calgary for I'll never know I'll never know just only from the fact of outside of this ugly exterior is a seed of God Amen that word of Great Value that came from God from before the foundation of the world that he placed in you that was be redeemed back to himself amen that's what he's looking at he's not looking in the mirror you're looking at amen he's looking in mirror of the word yes and in that mirror he sees himself when he looks at you he doesn't see you in your faults and mistakes he doesn't see you in your failures and when you fall he sees you of that perm of great price he sees you of that great value of someone who was worthy listen someone who is worthy and unworthy people who was worthy enough for him to place his own life in you all right what greater value can you get what greater value can there be that God Almighty himself taking a piece of himself a thought as brother Branham said an attribute to put it in each one of us amen with some such great value he calm and gave his life for it praise the Lord those of the Old Testament those are the ones that peculiar treasure that we read about those are the ones that did not know they could only be under the the blood of a bull or a goat or a sacrifice of some kind they didn't have the Redemption that we have but Jesus Christ come and paid that price yes amen he redeemed them that reached all the way back to the Garden of Eden and brought them back up to himself yes and it reached all the way forward to the very time that God will take us from this Earth to bring us to him amen now let's look at this a pearl let me read this quote you know something very striking to me in the message not just the word of Great Value because obviously the word that God brought through this Prophet was of great doesn't even seem like a good enough word I was going to say great value but that just doesn't seem to do it justice I don't know if you think of better adjective let me know we'll just say a great value uh that God allowed him brought him died to himself to bring a word to us of that great value was of such value to us but when you look through that message and the things that God allowed uh this Prophet to do and go through when it come up to the very end it was a very special event that happened to brother Brown it happened right over here uh right over here in Sabino let me read to you brother Braham talks about it the breach's message he said I was standing there in prayer he said I was standing I've had a lot of people that I've taken up there and they kneel down I said you said you kneel down but brother Branham said when he was praying there as what we consider sword Mountain Pulpit Rock whatever you want to call it brother bam said I was standing there praying yeah yeah so you I've had people come to Congo all over the place I said you're more than welcome to kneel do it in your own way I said but if you're trying to replicate what brother Brown was doing he said he stood yeah so anyway just a little nugget for you I was standing there in prayer and something happened and now something fell in my hand now I know if you don't understand spiritual things it may be or may seem very strange but something struck in my hand and I when I looked it was a sword now what does the sword represent the word yes amen the word the third pole the opening of the word the sword was given to him and a hand was a representation he said I looked and it was a sword and the handle was made of what you all know it's made of pearl amen the handle that is held to take the strength of the Dueler for the sword that that's the part that actually gets held by the strength of the the strength of the Dueler goes from the man to person to the handle amen the sword the sword is is like saying it's like a lot of people say today guns kill people guns don't kill people a person has to hold that gun and pull the trigger to kill the person or to shoot a bullet yeah there has to be a trigger there has to be an activation from a live human being well the sword in itself the word here is is just what it is the Bible even says itself it's a dead letter but it takes a hand of strength it takes a hand of faith on that curl on that Pearl to take the blade of the sword to the heart of the enemy praise the Lord amen the sword the handle look now again the handle was made of pearl he said the prettiest Pearl I ever seen now let me ask you this when we talk about this huge oyster making pearls for the city you think a oyster made the pearls of the handle of that sword no that is something God created amen God made this amen just like he could make anything he wants to make just like he can make this one Pearl God can make it however he wants it to be who am I to say all I know is what the Bible says the Bible says one Pearl it says one Pearl that's what I'm going to say Amen but an oyster didn't make the Pearl on the handle of this sword God made it God manufactured or whatever you would say to put the the pearl handle on this sword the prettiest brother Ram said the prettiest Pearl I've ever seen and the guard was so and so on he's talked about and um the saber blade was so long my point of it though was the handle of the sword now he goes on later and talks about it takes the strength of the Jeweler to take the sword to the heart of the enemy well the strength is nothing more than not something on your arm or your back or your body the strength is your faith yes it takes faith in the word to drive it to the heart of the enemy I hear people all the time trying to rebuke the devil when they have absolutely no place and no right to rebuke him right yes none they are standing on nothing but their own intellectual understanding right they don't have the faith that it takes to grab the Pearl on that handle and take that word to the heart of the enemy right but that Pearl is what is the controller amen without the pearl handle it's like driving a car down the street without a steering wheel which I guess you can do on both cars today but uh you you can you you can't really normally drive a car down the road unless you do something with a steering wheel the car is great maybe the most beautiful thing ever but what good is it do you don't have a steering wheel that can take it to where it wants to go see the blade on the sword is find the word but it takes faith in that word to drive it to the heart the enemy and that and that handle was The Pearl praise the Lord let's look at what that Pearl again let's get a little deeper what that Pearl would represent notice a pearl a pearl is the perfect symbol it's the perfect representation of the unity of the Bride amen although she is a mini member body she is one yes you know that the bride is one but she's a mini membered body but of one and this Pearl is the perfect representation you say how is that so because the Pearl is created the Pearl is not manufactured the Pearl comes about and is formed by what is called accretion accretion is something that takes different parts or different layers of things that are sometimes not even related and it puts on and it and it Blends them together into one perfect Unity of what we consider a beautiful pearl today but it takes a a layer upon a layer it takes one here and it takes one there it takes each one of us that makes up that Pearl and is formed together it's not mechanically made I actually wrote it down here let me just read it the Pearl is not mechanically made I of course nowadays you never know what they do and make these fake things but accretion is an organic which is natural it's a natural organic growth growing to the growing together of parts that are naturally separate amen the growing together of parts that are naturally separate that is how a pearl is formed that is how a pearl is made from parts that are normally just like you and I we come here today as one unit but we're all separate amen we're all different we're all separate units and and different units in so many ways we're different units but we come together as one under this roof under the auspice of Jesus Christ and his shed blood we come together as one and that's the perfect representation of the Bride as a whole the bride as a whole is one unit a mini-membered body from all over the world of every Kindred tongue people and Nation to make one bride to Jesus Christ yes that mystical body of Jesus Christ yes it takes accretion it takes the natural growth of the growing together of all these parts that are normally not a part of each other they're normally separate but God brings together how does he do it by one Spirit by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body amen one spirit so the holy spirit in you is the same Holy Spirit in me the same Holy Spirit over here is the same Holy Spirit over there same Holy Spirit here is the same one down the street same one down the street same one the next state next County next country next uh uh continent it's the same spirit amen and it brings us all together amen I was happy to be able to see some of my precious friends for years ago when we very first came in this message I saw we saw half a dozen people that were standing right there when me and Sonia got baptized and the Holy Ghost fell and the the church and it it was it's a precious thing to go back and remember but you know even though 2 000 miles separate us we could come together and break bread and it's like we're one again it's like we never were not one again pardon the double negative we were always together always one and there'll be a time where there will be no separating there will be a time where there will be no party here on this Earth is the only thing time this what separates people from over overseas around the world different parts of the world different parts of the country people I don't even know but all one naturally separate but we're all a part of that same mystical body of Jesus Christ that's why when I pray for and I pray for the bride internationally yeah yeah the bride worldwide because God knows who they are I might not know every one of them I know I don't but God knows them and they're a part of me I'm a part of them we're all part of the same body we're all a part of that pearl of great price that Jesus Christ was willing to pay for now you see the representation of that Pearl it's the bride just like the foundations was the apostles and the garnishings was the was the tribes of Israel now we see the gates are one Pearl what's that the bride all written with the name of each of the 12 tribes of Israel on it God's representation of his people of the Overcomer in this city all that all those now look again all that the foundations and the gates are all on the outside surrounding this city speaking to those that are inside the city those that are inside that City are represented by all of the things that God has done out here on the outside of the city the city itself is like a brand adored for her husband we know that but God's showing himself in his Redemptive plan the man that the the the man that purchased this great treasure and this great pearl of great the pearl of great Christ has represented himself in US in this city by this by by the outside of this of this city everything about it shows that that's us we're all one together the unity of the Bride the unity of God's people amen bringing us together showing us as one I got one more scripture I want to read to you amen and then uh and then I want to read uh this other scripture over again Ephesians let's look at Ephesians chapter 5. I kind of mentioned to you last time that that last service this one was kind of one and a half services so uh the last one was maybe a little shorter this is maybe a little shorter uh but um the only way I could figure to make it work so we're not here until two o'clock in the afternoon Ephesians chapter five let's read this one last year 25th verse husbands uh Ephesians 5 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word amen Pearl word of great value a pearl of wisdom as people would say that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without full image now look at this husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church and gave himself he gave himself now notice how perfectly that goes with what Jesus said in Matthew 13 that we just read he gave himself sold everything he had gave himself for that Pearl that he might sanctify and cleanse it by the wash of the water of the word the pearl of great price then he might do what present it us to who himself amen he does the work he cleanses he sanctifies he he saves He blesses he washes of the water of the word so that we are in the position by him to be presented to him he's doing it it's not about me it's not about us it's about him it's about all that he's done all that he still does Amen the Washi of the Water by the word to present this bride to himself but this bride now perfect yes because he gave himself for her he's the one that cleansed her he's the one that washed her he's the one that Sanctified her he's the one that put himself in her to present her to him but she now has become him and the two become one amen the Two Become One Inseparable the Bride In Christ together will be through eternity friend this is our new home this is the new beginning let not your heart be troubled amen you believe in God believe also in me I've gone a place to prepare if I hadn't gone here I would have told you so but what did he tell us this is our new home amen I'm looking forward to that home that the Lord has prepared for us amen that friend we're about to go to yeah if I had any one thing that I could relate to you coming from that side of the country was the Lord's coming is here and and I sent that same thing from us back to them yes absolutely we believe the same thing yes it is right at hand it's like brother Dennis's prayer brother Branham even said it's overdue where are we now yes God help us yes amen God help every one of us where everyone in desperation looking for that maybe not quite in desperation we should be but looking for that longing for that Desiring that time God that calls us away if we go meet him in the air amen begins this process this ball rolling we get to this place let me look at let's read let's look at this one more time and I'm going to close Revelation 21 verse 1. John said and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away there was no more seed and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and and God himself shall be with them and be their God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things you know overcome her inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and abominable murders and whoremongers and Sorcerers idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven balls full of the seven last plagues that talk with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain showed me that great City holy Jerusalem descending out of God out of Heaven from God having the glory of God and her light was like unto each Stone most precious even like a jasper stone clearest Crystal had a great wall a wall great and high had 12 States and at the 12 the gates 12 angels the names were written there on which are the names of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel the East Gate East three gates and the north three gates and the South three gates of the West three gates the wall of the city had 12 foundations in them the names of The Twelve Apostles of the lamb and he had taught with me had a and he had taught them he had a great uh golden Reed to measure the city and the gates thereof the wall thereof in the city lieth Foursquare and the length is as large as the breath and he measured the city with a reed 12 000 furlongs the length and the breadth and the height are all equal of it are equal and he measured the wall thereof and 140 and four cubits according to the measure of man that is of the Angel and the building of the wall of it was of Jasper the city was pure gold like on the clear glass Foundation the wall of the city were garnished with all men are oppression stones and all these Stones uh uh the First Foundation Jasper second Sapphire third cologne uh fourth and emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth Sardis seventh crystallite the eighth Barrel the ninth topazm 10th uh christoperous the 11th they uh Hassan the 12th in amethyst and the 12 gates were 12 pearls every several gate of one Pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it would transparent glass and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty the Lamb of the temp uh were the Temple of it and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lightness and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the king of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day and there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory in honor of the Nations into it and they're shown no wise inner any into it anything that defileth neither whose whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh alive but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life and he showed me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the Tree of Life which beared 12 manner of fruits and yielded their fruit every month the leaves of the of the trees were for the healings of the Nations and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and the lamb shall be in it and his servants Shall Serve him and they shall see his face in his name shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the son for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign forever and ever he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his angels to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sage of the prophet Prophecies of this book amen let's stand if we could what praise the Lord what a great thing Saints amen what a wonderful thing yes what God has done for us what God has showed us what God has prepared for us mine when you think about that I heard the other day on some news thing that somebody was talking about uh St Patrick's Day or maybe it was spring break I can't remember which was just all the drinking and revelry and stuff that they do and she said oh when just I just love him when we get to heaven I can do that oh my mind I said woman if you ever do make it and I hope you do it won't be there I promise you that that kind of thing will not be there yes but the mentality of people to think like that yes I've heard people I've heard people say if it's not like that uh all but all the fun they say they have I don't want to go I'd rather go to hell where the fun is okay you know you seal your destiny by your own words yes God have mercy eyes oh I what else can you say friend I mean you look at the world today and the things it has gotten to um I would imagine probably that Sonja has sent this at least maybe to the sisters but I'm going to read it because I read it again um and uh I wanna I wanted to read it to to you all it's a guy a pastor in Canada who got arrested for the second time for pros for protesting drag queen story time in the public libraries a Canadian Pastor was arrested for the second time this month as he protested a drag queen Story Time event for kids at a public library the guy's name in Canada was taken into custody Wednesday for breaching release orders from his previous arrest that prohibited him for being within 200 meters of events involving lb lgbtq community uh police say breaching 200 he was told not to come within 200 meters now this he said well this is Canada friend it's coming here too we already know this is already happening here uh we we have a voice in this country that's come out against I'll just leave it at that that's come out against that uh and God bless his heart uh he used to be an actor I can't remember his name now oh Kurt Cameron uh used to be an actor became a Christian and did the Left Behind movies and all he's wrote a Christian book for kids and he tried to go into libraries and give the kids uh things of Godly things of this Christian book that that that he wrote to help instill some Godly values in them and he had a hard time getting a library to let him come and do this yes yes they'll allow the other but they won't allow this now what do you think about a public facility that's garnering the attention of the children today that'll allow them to watch and participate in a drag queen show but not something that's Godly holy Christian wholesome where are we how much how much later can it go how much further can it go how brother Ram talked about the cup of iniquity how how much more can there be that this cup can take right but before it's flooding over I I know he looks through a different set of eyes and I'm glad he does uh because there was a time when I was lost and I'm glad he had mercy and uh long-suffering for me to come in and maybe there's one more I don't know but whatever it is friends we're done here yes this world is shot yes uh you look and think well I'll go to this country they're worse than here as bad as this one's getting you hear about the UK the UK they're they're 10 times worse than we are yes with this field and and it's become mainstream yes and people are coming to the places like oh you know accepting of it this word this Bible to to a large portion of this country is nothing anymore it doesn't mean anything to you right you look at the watered-down versions that people have tried to interpret off of the scripture to make it sound like something that it is not to justify their their their Lifestyles and the way they want to live and do and act God how much longer yes amen I I just it blows you it blows my mind to understand certain things and and and why and how things are going on the way that they're going uh I I I I'll never understand God help me I know I'm old but I'll never understand how women think something's sticking out of their nose and eyelashes that look like Daddy Long Legs looks attractive I I I'll probably never understand that I mean we walked out of a place the other day I forgot uh I think it was I was at work we went to lunch and I told the guys I said if you're hot just go stand in front of this girl who y'all just tell her to Blink our eyelashes I I couldn't believe it today I stand back I'm exaggerating but it's just gotten so bad yes it's just and and remember what brother Madam said you want to know the condition of the church look at what the women look at the women how they act today amen tattooed all up and pierced and all in amen that's that's the way it is and those are souls and I pray for their souls I I I don't want any of them go to hell right but it shows the condition of the day that we live yes God help us believe it's time amen well make sure we're in the place we should be with him amen amen more than anything more than anything praise the Lord let's sing this course amen Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary I think we probably all know the words to it but I believe that's something that we all desire greatly today friend God to make us more like him amen let's sing it to him before we go today with all of our hearts we sing to him Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I'll be your baby [Music] for you amen amen yes Lord Jesus praise God you know people look today and said you know brother you and your awful hard sometimes I don't think we're hard enough but could you imagine what brother Brandon would say under the condition s going into the world today knowing what he said 50 years ago 50 almost 60 years ago what do you think he would say if you were in this world like I I I'm rough oh my God for the condition of what there was in the 60s when I was young going to school guys didn't look like they looked today they're all over the place and ponytails and buns and all this stuff and it looked like pardon me but I'm at the perverts it looked like that wine because a girl would look at a guy like that so a guy looked decent and okay to try to have to try to attract a female if he looked like that but nowadays does that matter in fact sometimes it seems like the crazier the more they're attracted to him and just some just the opposite when I was going to school if a girl had something hanging out her nose a guy wouldn't look twice at her so she didn't do it because she knew it she wanted to track the guy she didn't look like that and that's gonna have tattoos all up and down no God would look at her you know what no God would give her the time of day unless it were a Hell's Angel biker or something they might and kept it that way and now it's just it it's just all it's the horse rider yeah it's the pale horse rider that's writing you own into Perdition right all mixed up colored up amen my brother Graham said that's an animal living God have mercy have mercy so Lord come quickly praise the Lord amen God bless you pray something we said the bless the street here today amen and I know little friend we may have we may have loved ones relatives people that are dear to us in some
