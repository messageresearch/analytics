it uh evolved from here and just trust the worth and less it now so uh again thank you for being here today and uh hope this listen to you had a prayer request i hope you heard that part of those prayer requests it looks like it's it looks like my video is still not working right for some reason it's still buffering too much as long as it stays on and we can keep it going will be all right um just want to make sure it's going to work the way it's supposed to and that everybody gets on and becomes a part of it like we're like we're supposed to so just give it a minute and see how this works out and if it goes any further from here so it looks live now looks like everything's okay uh it's still buffering though i don't know i don't know why it's not receiving enough uh from the internet or what's going on um strength so um it's like maybe people are getting on a little bit at a time and one or two at a time and see how this works out yeah it's still saying it's not receiving enough video so i'm sure i'm not sure how to fix that um so hopefully you'll be able to receive the audio uh if not i am recording this as well so at least you can have the audio of it if maybe not the video so hopefully we'll keep this going and uh have this so that you can be a participant and be part of it so it'll work out okay so anyway uh we're gonna move on and i'm gonna go to revelation chapter uh 10 verse seven uh we're now on mysteries of god in christ part number ten and having the queen and his people part number two uh so we want to continue with that we'll see if this doesn't pick up the way it should and flow through like i'm hoping it does or maybe if the video shuts off i'll just make this a little short pick this up next week like i said hopefully if you're watching this or you do watch this later uh we're hopefully gonna have the building in the position next week to be able to meet there and have live service there so uh that's what the hope is and and mike it can be on the streaming and then we can have somebody that knows what they're doing work on it i'm good if i push a few buttons and everything works fine i'm fine but when there's a hiccup or there's something that's not working quite right i'm not the person to fix it when it comes to a computer so i'm not always very good at that but uh anyway so we'll just move on from here now and again as we have we'll start with the same scripture reading in revelation chapter 10 verse 7 will read this to begin uh today in the days of the voice of the seventh day angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets man now again we've gotten into part two uh of uh having the preeminence in his people so i want to go back to that scripture that we read last week and uh and get back to that again and just read a couple of verses of scripture from there to kick start that from where we left off last week uh last week we read colossians uh chapter one began at verse 12. let's just read verses 18 and 19 this time to draw our context again remember god having the preeminence in his people uh is the second part of that christ the mystery of god revealed remember the first is not revealing himself to known to his people the second is god having the preeminence in those people and a very paramount part because god hadn't revealed himself to us if god hadn't opened himself or condescended to the point that we could see him and that god could reveal himself to us then there's no way that it ever would have happened where um um you know we could have he could have the preeminence in us so uh but that that verse of scripture here is colossians chapter 1 verse 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning of the uh who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell amen now again we're majoring on that 18th you to see verse again as we read last week it's not just the bible doesn't just say god having the preeminence in his people is saying that god would have preeminence in all things he is the head of the body now we'll take a few minutes and we'll try to get into that just just for a few moments again uh with this acting up the way it is i'll probably make this a little shorter but let's look at this just for a few moments because just you know we need weekly food and i want to give you what i thought the lord gave me yesterday or part of this so uh but that part majors in 18 first year he is the head of the body the church body church body bride uh we are the bride body amen because remember uh we talked many times about the differentiation between the bride of jesus christ and the church the church is nominal the bride is his wife uh the bride is making herself correct the body uh is the head of the body see who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things all things he might have the preeminence now that's that key word the preeminence again we talked about last week what it meant to have that preeminence of what the imminence was or your imminence and before because remember it says in the scripture here that he was before all things so we look at that again and see he's the beginning uh from the dead that in all things have not had the preeminence but if you look over um see if i can find it here it tells us in the same chapter that he was the before all things and that pre is the word before the 17th verse we didn't read that part and he is before all things and by him all things consist remember that prefix pre a part of that definition is pre means before all things or pre imminence he is the superiority well being the superiority makes him the head it makes him the one that's in control and when i look that up for uh today or yesterday it really um it really struck me what this head means here uh so if you go into the same colossians 1 18 and you look in the greek of the word head it means it says the head of both of both men and often animals so you think about that in relation to what the scripture just said that in all things see in all things head both of men and often of animals since the loss of the head destroys life amen so it's vitally important that this body be attached to the head and that the head come on the body so that the body has life in it and it is a viable life see because the loss of the head destroys the life see anything now in metaphor anything that is supreme the head chief prominent of persons being the master and lord amen where we left off last week remember where we left off last week having the preeminence makes him lord making him lord is lord of your life he is the master he is the head he is the controller he is the one who who uh moves us and controls us and we are obedient to him remember paul said i am not of my own i am bought with a price so see we don't belong to ourselves we belong to him see and he and he is our master and lord of a husband look at this now uh we won't get to this scripture today but of a husband in relation to his wife see the head just like uh in ephesians five we'll read probably lord willing next week of christ the lord of the husband and the church of things the cornerstone see now that's the head the head that he's talking about the head of the body which we just read that is what the head means the head means that he is master he is lord he is supreme he is uh of the of the authority in an authoritative position makes him supreme makes him the head he is the head now looking at this head for a moment in this body because it's a complete body because remember we're a part of him so if he's going to have preeminence he's going to have preeminence in everything and in all ways so in that we are one unit we are not separate units christ and the bride are not separate units she has become one flesh she has become one unit and that one unit together we are together as one unit he's simply the head and in the head that's come down is to cap off that body so the intelligence of christ in the body of christ is fulfilling and living the purpose that god has for us in this earth today yet thus having the preeminence that preeminence now that's in the body that's in the bride that preeminency and that whole preeminence is what he does in us one unit we are one flesh we are one bone we come and we'll get to that lord willing and having that preeminence one flesh and one bone notice now him being the head it brings it to that position the head is is literal it is a literal term and it is and it is also used as an adjective a head in other words a head is a literal head you look at my head here is literal it is a literal head the head is also an adjective as in the head of something or someone or corporation or a company uh or or a country or something like that that's an adjective describing someone that is in control of someone or someone's or some business or something else they are in control so the head of something is in control in authority figure over others see they're in control that's what the head is it's not literal head like sitting on my shoulders see but it is a figurative it is an adjective to say that that person as the head is in control now also body is the same way body is a literal term but it's also an adjective term and to say that you look at my body this is a body this is literal this literal head is literal body but there's also a figurative or an adjective body that is that would describe a a group of people or or a a gathering of water we call oceans a body of water uh we call gruesome people uh a body see they're they're a body together they're joined together they're there for a purpose common cold cause uh you call our congregation a body of people well that's a figurative or a an adjective used for the word body there's literal you say yes the head to the body is literal but there's also the figurative where you have the supreme authority over the body of people that make him that jesus christ that head over the adjective body of people that are together as one group as one unit for one goal for one purpose and that body comes together that way see so that head is over that body thus you read the scripture that he is the head of the body the church he is the head see and if he's that head then he's gonna have the preeminence remember that eminence preeminence is that first place the first place god's gonna have the first place or he's not going to have a place see and if we belong to god god will wait and we'll be in the position how many of us you know didn't just come right in with uh all barrels blazing you know sometimes we uh uh missed out a little bit or didn't come quite when we maybe should have or whatever you know and sometimes we uh backslide a little bit or something like that but god is always there patient waiting but he's gonna have in his body now he's gonna have the first place he's gonna have the preeminence as the head of the body as being the head now i want to move on uh quickly because again uh of the things that's going on here with the video but i want to turn into acts chapter four and i want order because there's a few places because you can look at this now acts chapter four we're going to begin with verse 8 through 12. uh this is the middle of the story but that's where we're going to begin you can also find it psalms 118 22 and luke 2017 david talks about it in psalms 118 and uh luke talks about it in 20th chapter 17 or jesus talks about it luke recorded it jesus talks about it in luke 2017 okay so the subject here that we're going to talk about is the rejection of that head see the rejection of that head because he steal the head he's still the preeminent he's still the support the the uh uh the superiority over that bride over that body over the church amen he still disappeared you read in um revelation of all the church agents and he's still the the god of those church ages even though uh they shut him out or they push him out or you know the nominations don't want him uh certain entities people they don't want him see he came to his own and his own received him not so we read this that as peter put it here uh he's the healing of the impotent man in acts chapter 4. now we'll begin with the first date look at this apologizes uh videos uh just got me portable a little bit so i'm trying to work through that so uh god help us get that anointing amen then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom he crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him that this man stand here before you whole amen he was he wasn't ashamed now he got born again he got the holy ghost jesus told him when you're converted strength in the brothers uh that's exactly what he's doing he received a conversion in that upper room he was no more a coward he was no more running for his life he was nowhere yelling at young children and cursing he was no more denying jesus he was standing before them boldly claiming why and how this impotent man received healing and he told them straight out that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth who you crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand before you whole praise the lord that's bold amen that's true he's standing holding it true but now look what he goes on to say this is the stone jesus is the stone which was set at not of you builders which has become the head of the corner now peter puts it as the head of the corner the head of the corner now notice something when when you're in building because well first of all let's get to the first part of this when we do that let's get to the first part he said this is the stone jesus christ is that stone amen that's not which was said not of you in other words what he's telling them is this stone which came to you this stone jesus christ the messiah god almighty which came to you and you set him at naught you called him worthless you called him a waste you called him nothing to you see that you said him at not in other words you considered him nothing to you you consider him a waste that's what he's telling them see he said this was that stone that came that stone that those religious men are standing there knew exactly what david said in psalms 2018. they knew exactly they were probably some were standing there when when luke recorded in luke 20 when jesus told holding the same thing this is the spoke of the corner he tried to tell them now peter's telling them that see peter's telling them that here peter's telling him this is that song which you builders have said not well what's he talking about what what are these builders of what do these people build oh what is it that they're in control of building well they're supposed to be the religious leaders they're supposed to be the people that's in charge of these people's spiritual welfare they're supposed to be the ones to be returned to the church the symbols they're in charge of delivering to those people the truth of god the messiah the the jehovah elohim they're in charge of the spiritual welfare of those people they're supposed to be the ones that are building this church that they're building this people up to the place that they're supposed to be uh uh believing in god well they're that's they're the ones that are the builders of that see the builders of that church you look at churches today you've got denominations you've got ministers pastors you've got money flowing all around the world for religious purposes just because they're considered still in this country a non-profit organization is tax deductible so of course they can deduct their taxes but anyway they're supposed to be the builders they're supposed to be the one the religious leaders that people look up to that it's building this body see this body is being built it is a body that comes together see of that body they're the builders of that church that's coming together see and he said you have taken the stone the cornerstone of that building and so look at this for a moment it's him being the head of the corner that puts him perfectly in line with being the alpha and omega if he puts him perfectly in line with the author and the finisher it puts him perfectly in line with being the first and the last he was the beginning he is the end he is the everything from beginning to end so he is alpha he's not only the head that he's coming to tap the bride he is also the foundation of the corner he is the course on the head of the court he's at the beginning he's the alpha and the omega he's the beginning foundation cornerstone and the head we're a part of that because we're a part of the body because we are the body we are the body i'm a part of the body to them as being builders of that of that body of that church he relates to them as being the builders who said that saw it not but that stone has not become the corner the hand of the corner of that building which is the body his body his spiritual body he's a spiritual head in the preeminence of all things primarily as we care and looking to the head of this body they said not but regardless of themselves he still become head of corner he still become head of the body because he is regardless of what these builders do regardless of what they preach or say or promote or propagate whatever church religion doesn't matter jesus is still the head of the body he is still the head of the corner regardless of what those people have done neither is their salvation being any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved the name of jesus christ that it's built [Music] of this church the body built inspiration this country oddly enough if you look at it and some of you may remember back uh years ago brother greene gave but if you notice even on the very dollar field of the united states my brother blew these supposed to be you see the representation of that in the body because this was the christian nation this nation was founded as a christian nation and all the principles of the scripture and a freedom of religion not freedom from religion but freedom of religion in other words they wanted us to be able to serve and live and uh serve god the way that we wanted to according to our dictates in the bible that's why the things are written on the song the way they are on the buildings of washington this pyramid was built this is the body see that looking over our country but notice the detachment they also had very prophetic really you notice the detachment here the cast had not come to cap the body because it's separate you notice this nation where it is at today that nation rejected this nation the builders rejected that capstone they rejected it and now they've done without it and there's no connection here between the body and the head this body that we consider the united states of america detached from the head which was jesus christ supposed to be god the all-seeing eye it is detached it's not joined together it's not one entity it's not one unity and you see what happens because it's detached we talked about last week i made a mention because i saw it somewhere and somebody or both you know years ago they took out prayer and bible in schools and they wondered then 50 60 70 80 years ago whenever it happened what would ever come of our children what's going to come of our nation now that we've taken prayer in the bible out of schools well you can look around and you know what the results are we can see what the results are now the capstone detached from the body has never come to cap amen however that capstone that that that come is become the head of the corner of the body regardless of what these builders did regardless of what these builders said regardless of the rejection from that of god this bright body has now accepted him and his comments as him to cap her to be one unit together because she's not two units she is one it's just like when the reference here again that we have the scripture lord willing we might get to ephesians 5 maybe next week of the wife and the and the bridegroom the bride and the bridegroom the husband and wife the bride and christ coming together when they come together they're one they're one together he comes he caps that body we are one we're one with him we come from him we go to him that's the preeminence that he has the the the stone that the builders rejected the stone today that they continued the builders of this christian or this this religious foundation is supposed to be built on was a christian today was was supposed to be founded on has been rejected and the capstone has not come upon them he is not going to come upon them he's coming upon his bride he come to save his people not everybody his people that capstone has come to cap her off because she has become him she is now uh flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life spirit of his spirit that head is coming intelligence the word the prophetic gift the all-seeing eye it is it is shining forth through the body of jesus christ because we are that one to be the full expression of jesus christ for this last day we are the ones that are expressing him and showing him as the same yesterday today and forever through us he shines forth because that's who we are in him the builders rejected him but the bride receives him because he is her all in all but now looking look at ephesians chapter two let's see if i can get it here ephesians chapter two we're gonna i'm gonna bring a couple of scriptures in here now i wanna read ephesians chapter two and then go to one specific part of ephesians chapter two and then one more scripture we'll probably wrap this up but now look at this it looks like the video is doing better too by the way so thankful for that uh some of this could have been cause my phone started running out of internet hotspot uh so i'm having to use sonia's today so but it looks like it's doing better anyway ephesians chapter two let's go to uh um start with verse 14. ephesians chapter two verse 14. let's read this for he is our peace jesus is our peace who had broken uh who had excuse me he is our peace who has made both one and hath broken down the middle wall our partition between us having abolished in his flesh in his flesh the enmity the division the hatred the enemy uh even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god where both unto god in one body what body is that jesus christ where did the bride come from his body amen in one body by the cross where was it done at calvary on the cross amen in one body by the cross having slain the enemy the enmity thereby we say enemy the enemy the evil the wickedness the division thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off into them that were nine for through him we both have access by one spirit his spirit unto the father now therefore we are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of them of the household of god and are built look here now and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone amen being the chief cornerstone which we've already described looked at peter saying jesus said in saint luke 7 2017 david psalms 118 he is that cornerstone he is the alpha and omega he is the foundation he is the head he is the begin author and the finisher praise the lord that being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building all the building what is that building we are we are that bride we are that figurative adjective bride body many member body remember once god the fullness of the godhead dwelt in one person jesus christ jesus said i must needs uh to go i got to go away and his disciples were distraught they didn't wanted to leave i don't blame him i wouldn't want him to either but he said i must go because if i don't go all you've got is me hearing the flesh with you but if i go away i'll send the comforter the holy spirit me my life the spirit will come and not just be with you but be in you and it won't just be in you few people here it'll be in the multitudes in millions down through the generations down to the church ages there'll be millions that my spirit will go into and then i can have the preeminence in each one of those people because my life will be in them my spirit will be in them i must go away so that i can come back in whom that building now the bride building is fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom he also are building together for inhabitation of god through the spirit the habitation of god through the spirit oh praise the lord i just beautiful isn't it it's just just so beautiful but frame together look at this real quick now frame together groweth unto the holy temple in the lord this building so fitly joined together you remember what brother branham described it as remember how brother brown typed it brother adam typed it at the as those pyramids that were built uh he had said by enoch that were so intelligent and so perfectly hewn those stones that made that pyramid was so perfectly hewn that you can't run a razor blade between the two stones now understand something each stone is separate in itself each stone is an individual stone it's not one stone it's two stones but they become so fitly building comes so fitly joined together now help us understand god this is us this is the bride this bride building body should be so fitly joined together that you could not take a razor blade and separate between the two praise the lord now satan tries to do it all the time satan will continually try to bring division and hatred and he'll try to take a razor blade and slice between you and your brother and you and your sister all the time but that body is so fitly joined together because christ came and chewed it so perfect each stone is so perfectly hewned out now who's who's a stone i am a stone you're a stone we're so perfectly humed by god gotten to the place of that of that position of maturity of perfection as he said in matthew 5 48 perfection which is maturity a place or a level of shooting out where god has taken all the things away from us that don't belong to us all the things that that are ungodly and all the things that we shouldn't be tagged on or hanging on god takes and cues this body down he takes his word to do it and that word chops those places off and thinly tunes that body together so that it's so much him now this body this brightest is so much become him now we have so much becoming him now with that head on the body you can't run a razor blade between brother and sister you shouldn't if there's some there razor bleeding there's there's there's a problem somewhere but this bride now i'm not talking about pretenders or make believers or i'm talking about true bride are going to be so hewn together you can't even run a razor blade between them that's that building that's that building that is so fitly joined together he has here in whom all the building fitly framed together grows into that holy temple of the lord which we are the temple of the holy ghost now look and and real quick the 20th verse again i i'm going to close here give me another 10 minutes or so but look here in the 20th verse and are built now remember what peter told them uh there after healing the healing the healing of the impotent man as the impotent man got healed what did he tell them he said you builders amen and we've we've clarified that builder now those who those builders are and we all are amen part of it building this church uh you're a part of that building you're a part of the builder of that building if you go witness to people and bring people to church bring people to christ that's building that body see the ministers come forth and the the right ministers preach that gospel the message of the hour and that that helps bring that building up see builds that building up but now you see and are built upon the foundation apostles and prophets so we are built there's that built of the building that was built up well where did that building come from that building takes us right back to the place that jesus was describing before which we're going to read in matthew that brings us to our actual title our message title the title that brother branham gave christ the mystery god revealed our title that we've been titling this series of the mysteries of god in christ what is it it brings us right around back to being built on that foundation well look matthew chapter 16 look at this real quick matthew chapter 16 um verse 17 we'll start there amen matthew 16 17 and jesus approaching his disciples answered and said unto him uh let's let's go up higher than that let's let's just read the story 13th first let's start there when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias others jeremiah's or one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that i am so he's wanting to get very personal with them here he said who do men say i the son of man am and they say well some says this i heard this guy over here say that i heard this rabbi say this about you i heard this group of people talk about you and calling you this at the other and then he gets personal with him and he says okay but who do you who do you i'm standing before you the ones i have handpicked and chosen who do you say that i am in simon peter 16 first answer and said thou art the christ the son of the living god amen what was peter's revelation peter's revelation was the understanding that jesus wasn't the son of joseph or mary he wasn't just come as some second person in the godhead he wasn't just uh a part of a trinity or something but that he was literally the son of god god almighty in flesh the fulfillment of isaiah 9 who would be the almighty god the everlasting father and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed this you didn't learn it in seminary you didn't get it from some school of prophets you didn't get prophesied there's no you didn't get it from any any any flesh and blood but my father which is in heaven this comes a direct revelation from god almighty to you of who jesus is and then he says and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it upon what rock now the catholic church says it's the church is built on remember we're in the theme of builders and building they believe that it was built on peter they said that peter was the first pope so that peter was the one that this foundation was going to be built on because jesus said upon this thou art peter and upon this rock not peter he said this rock what was this rock that the the revelation of who jesus christ is now peter there's nothing that's going to be built on peter peter was just a man but it had to be built on something that was going to hold of a solid foundation i mean look if it was built on peter not long after this peter was cussing yelling and screaming at little kids and telling him he was denying jesus left him right chair running for his life that's what the church was getting upon no no he said this she read it i say unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it so if it's not built on the foundation of who jesus christ is as god himself not again a trinity or the second third person or no not just some good prophet some good man no god himself that foundation author and finisher that foundation built upon the revelation of who jesus christ is in containing in that all the mysteries that were to be made known and revealed in this last day through the last angel messenger through the prophets down through the ages remember what just brother brown this is slowly unfolding mysteries down through the generations in time each person each prophet each reformer saw their day saw their time and gave what they had for that day you had justification in luther you had sanctification in wesley you had the restoration gifts and and pentecost and and the carrier the shock bringing forth the wheat so that the wheat could come forth and shine as the original not the shell the shop's not the original the blade apostle is not the original only the seed is of the original now each one of them is a part of that plant amen understand but they are not the seed so those mysteries that were to be revealed come by the building of this foundation this church this bride being built upon the foundation of the revelation of who jesus christ is this bride body is now built on the revelation of who jesus is now if there's any other church i'm not knocking anybody not knocking any ministers not knocking any churches but if there's any churches any ministers pastors anything else any other denomination or any other type of religion that's built on anything else other than the fact that who jesus christ is by revelation god almighty and flesh satan can prevail over that cannot prevail over this building that's built on the foundation of who he is cannot amen satan cannot prevail can he come against oh absolutely we feel that coming against quite often don't we but he can't prevail the gates of hell shall not prevail understand the difference he can come against absolutely but he will not prevail against this body that is built upon that revelation he cannot do it amen thou art peter upon this rock i will build my church i will build my church god said he would build it not a man not a nomination not a church entity denomination hierarchy he would build it how is he building it how is jesus christ he said i will build it i will build it how is he building it he's building his own church by living in us by having the preeminence in us by his preeminence in our lives and that preeminence shining forth through us all it's doing is bringing that building into the perfection of that capstone where it's supposed to be the buildings that the builders rejected the stone that that satan can prevail over that in fact pardon me but he already has satan already has control of the religious world period this is satan's eat but he does not and has not and cannot get control over this bride and over that body that was built on the foundation of who jesus christ is and by the message of the hour through brother brown we realize he can see by revelation who he is he introduced him to a bride he didn't introduce him to himself he didn't point to himself he pointed us to christ and he pointed us to a living christ not a dead one not a history historical one but a living christ that this body can see who that is that through us having his preeminence in us build this church that's how he christ i will build my church as the head of the corner as the author and the finisher as the alpha and omega he will finish and then he laid into the laps of peter and of course figuratively into the lap of this bride i will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven praise the lord and whatsoever thou shalt find on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven you don't think god doesn't honor that to this very day he didn't honor that just in peter that transformation of that from here to us is complete from ear to the bride it's finished preeminence of christ in that body the preeminence of that head that capstone coming down on the bride and that capstone love love remember it's love having the preeminence in that body oh praise the lord that's god having his preeminence in us he has built that church on that he has built that church on who he is praise the lord i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it look friend it'll continue and this satan zenos continue to press and he'll do everything he can to try to come against you but he cannot listen to me he cannot prevail over you he cannot prevail over this bride over you as a part of that bride he cannot prevail or win this war impossible because we're built on that foundation amen the foundation that the other builders reject that the builders that this country is rejected and those builders around the world today they reject it doesn't matter he's building his own church he's building his own church with that revelation as the cornerstone and he's building it by having the preeminence in you and i praise the lord amen that's wonderful god bless you today
