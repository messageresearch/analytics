a place that hold him but he just couldn't hold him amen they tried to kill him as dead as they could kill him but death couldn't hold him tried to bury them as deep as they could bury him and the grave couldn't hold it praise the lord he came out of that and he's alive today praise the lord and the good thing about that is that if death couldn't hold him it can't hold you either if the grave couldn't hold him it can't hold you either because you are risen with him praise the lord jesus alive forevermore hallelujah thank you lord jesus amen we'll go to the lord in prayer and then take prayer requests today i have a couple to mention we want to remember we're very happy to have sister tina with us sister tina ellis most of you know her they heard rick of business from time to time thank you buddy from time to time in the mountains uh from the mountains uh but this first time she'd been here so amen welcome sister tina but they're here uh on not so a good occasion i guess you'd say they had to fly his her husband brother rick down helicopter from uh show low because he was having some heart palpitations and his uh uh heart rate had gone up like 130 and if he just made any movement at all his heart would just start fluttering and so they flew him down here only place they could find a bed for him was at northwest i asked him i said well they take you to phoenix and normally from the mountains they fly people to phoenix he said they didn't have any room in phoenix i had to bring him here so he's in northwest hospital he's doing better they shocked his heart and got it back into a rhythm but his top part bought a part part of his heart weren't working congruently that was working together and was causing the problems and they're supposed to do another procedure where they go up and cauterize part of the heart hoping to prevent this from happening in the future so please pray for brother rick if you would the lord would just touch him and amen and put that heart back just perfect normal make it to where it works just the way it's supposed to amen praise the lord so uh also i want to continue to remember the dougal family in prayer me and sonia went to the funeral yesterday it was a very good funeral very efficient funeral um brother ed kept things rolling pretty good with uh the basically the eulogy about sister joyce and a lot of the family member got up and spoke about her and i wish i'd had an opportunity to but it was i know they were trying to keep things a little tight but uh it was a it was a good time uh as far as being able to see some people that hadn't seen in a while and to give our greetings to the family and just pray that the lord would continue to touch brother keith sister joyce's husband and the family in prayer if you would she was quite a a an anchor foundation in that dugal family in that google home she meant a lot to a lot of people i know personally she was she was uh she to me was the epitome of a human in every way a wife a mother a friend a sister a mom grandmother in every way she was such a precious sister she always had something good to say about somebody she always had a smile on her face and i know that for me that one of the darkest times of my life she shined a ray of light to me she stood up for me and she spoke verbally in the opposite in the face of the opposition that was coming so hard against me brother dennis well don't ask him it's i don't want to dredge that back up but brother dennis could tell you uh and she stood there and she voiced her opinion of support for me when uh it was not a popular opinion in that group and it meant a lot to me and i will absolutely never forget sister joyce and what she did for me and she actually a lot of a lot of people don't want this said but she actually there right at brother green's passing was calling me her family's pastor i don't know that i ever actually did anything to warrant that title but um i did spend some time go to texas a couple things to help some of her family but she actually called me her family's pastor and uh although i'm not sure i deserved that title necessarily i was honored that she uh would actually call me that meant a lot to me and she'll be greatly missed she was a precious sister she defied death many times she's been in the hospital time after time congenital heart failure and congestive heart failure and heart failure of the heart failure and uh just one thing after another i've visioned her hospital several times and it just seemed like she just kept defying death but it was her time so the lord took her home and she will be greatly missed but again remember the family in prayer also met jenny her daughter uh from texas that i had gone a couple of times to try to help her son austin uh kind of getting off the rails and um tried to help him and i told her that we would continue to keep austin and prairie still in prison so please remember austin is his name if you remember him also as you know here we mentioned uh michael dougal which was her grand joyce and keith's grandson their son him and kristen their son 24 year old had gotten run over over here off aina by some lady trying to steal her car he jumped on the hood and she shook him off and ran over him twice killed him and the family the whole family is still hurting very much over that the little girls they were tormented by demons they had catholic come in to try to exercise it nothing helped and so sister joyce asked me so i got acquainted with michael that's when i first got acquainted with michael and she asked me and so i went over and spent some time with them and talked to them and uh me and my wife stood we stood hand in hand and we rebuked those demonic spirits and they've never had a problem since uh but now the girls are are fearful again not that the demons are back but they're fearful because uh actually one of the daughters told uh her mother it seems like everybody around us is dying so they haven't even told joy they haven't even told her that their grandmother's great-grandmother's past they haven't even told the girls that sister joyce has passed away yet um so i hope they're not watching this but they haven't even told him because they were just the trauma of what had been going on recently i told them michael and kristen that we would continue to remember them in prayer as well so please hold them up in prayer if you would uh also amen so uh remember of course continue remember the situation in ukraine russia and all around the world god's pride internationally amen we're needy people today praise the lord anyone have an unspoken request in your heart the lord knows our hearts today let's stand to our feet if we could that's all the requests let's see if we got uh sister matisse's testimony here's a testimony a prayer request for danny it's a prayer okay well i i sorry i didn't even see this but he says prayers for all the people of ukraine for the war to end especially since the russian dictators upset the us and nato are continuing to supply ukraine weapons threatening to use weapons of mass destruction to uh really cause harm on ukraine other countries that are helping ukraine amen so we didn't make mention of that thank you brother danny for keeping that in your heart and mind amen we'll do the testimony here shortly so brother dennis would you take these knees to the lord lord jesus this is the day that the world acknowledges that great and just so magnificent day that took place father you showed us that you are

it was working and that air was coming out and i said okay well that's good and got here last night and then it is not working the air is still not working in fact we think it's leaking because there's spot stains in the tiles and in the window and it's dripping down on our equipment so i've got to talk to him again i actually talked to him last night he said he would try to get here this morning and so well you know we probably can't get it fixed in time for service so but uh i'm thankful that uh i'm still thankful god give us a place to be so yes again i'm sorry for it it may be a little warm again but lord willing next week we'll have the air back working it's supposed to be warmer again next week so amen also as i mentioned the funeral i i have the flyer that was from sister joyce's funeral i brought two or three more back there if you want to look at them there there really is just a scripture and a couple of pictures there's not a whole lot to this one but if you'd like one um i have one of my own so anybody can have this one or any of those back there feel free to take them um if you would like so i always try to grab some extras in case i know these many times people passing away and that knew them and we're close to them and so i try to get those so that we can so that anyone that wants them can happen so amen matthew 28 uh we'll begin with verse one if we could uh but before we do could we just bow our heads for another word of prayer precious lord jesus again it's indeed a privilege lord to be here once again celebrating this resurrection sunday morning it is a resurrection morning to us every day lord because you rise a new fresh in our lives every day yes and every sunday we come lord to represent that resurrection where the s-o-n rose from the grave god and representation and every sunday we meet here for that purpose lord and to meet with you and for you to speak to us lord and to do as you did even through the scripture god and we're expecting no less today but god on this day that we honor lord over 2 000 years ago you did literally in a corporal body rose from the grave yes and you are alive today you are alive and you are the same yesterday today and forever we celebrate you lord we love you we thank you so much father for all that you've done for us and lord in showing and return back to you for what you've did for us lord we want to offer our lives to you afresh god we want to offer it in obedience to you to your word lord to what you would call and have for us in our lives lord because that's all we can do you told us if we love you to keep your word lord and god we try that's what we do lord in our lives to just to obey that word because we know that's what makes you the happiest that's what fills your heart with joy lord when your children obey your word god we're in obedience to your word this morning we're not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together but we're here together lord would like for those of like precious faith and we're ex we're each one i believe come with great expectation waiting looking for you god to visit with us this morning lord we know that you are you promised where two or three are gathered in your name that you would be in the midst you said you would never leave us or forsake us lord believing that you would manifest right now you're a holy spirit to do exploits and power and demonstration of that spirit here today lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done today we give it to you lord we thank you for it now thank you for hell strength in life move upon the prayer requests the needs lord in your bride internationally father we committed all to you we thank you for it we give you glory and honor in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen matthew chapter 28 we'll begin reading with verse one in the end of the in the end of the sabbath as it began to draw dawn toward the first of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulcher behold there was a great earthquake where the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was as lightning in his raiment white as snow for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men the angel answered and said unto the woman unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him though i have told you you could be seated if you like praise the lord he is risen amen we count it as i guess something that's a normal thought in our christian religion that jesus christ is risen from the dead and maybe sometimes even take for granted that but it again if you if you go back and and you you really reflect on the world and the world standards and what the world's doing and all the world religions and all how the world religions are are pushing that religion forward to try to squeeze christ and the true god out that we recognize that none of their leaders none of their saviors none of their lords none of their uh books of their men none of their uh uh people that they follow are risen from the dead every one of them are still dead laying in a grave every one of them are are no longer to be heard from yes but ours is amen ours is risen yes ours is here ours is now present ours is the all-powerful almighty all-knowing god and he's here he's risen we can't take for granted the fact that he's risen because none of them have right none of the others have risen he's alive all the others are dead praise the lord now i want to read in congruent to this ephesians chapter 2. i want ephesians chapter 2 to go along with this we'll begin here with the first verse as well amen praise the lord ephesians chapter 2 verse 1. let's look at this now because this is this is uh this is the most important part amen it was important that jesus was risen but to me personally this is important to me personally amen now if he hadn't rose this couldn't exist amen so we understand him rising from the grave was what was paramount to bring this to pass but if this doesn't happen in us then all of it's in vain for us personally amen you and you who were dead in trespasses and sins now you notice here the italicized words are added to they meant to make a flow of it but it's easy to understand why they would have added this because it says and you who were dead and trespasses in sins were the word here is were amen you were dead in trespasses and sins so that means if you were dead in trespasses and sins he has quickened you because when he quickened you he made you alive and that's what i want to talk about today is that quickening power the quickening power you've heard the easter seal or it is the rising of the sun brother venom there's that's the major theme behind those messages is that quickening power and it's a powerful message friend when you really delve into it and think about it i probably won't spend as much time on it this morning that it that it uh deserves but i do want it's the thought that came on my heart to bring to us today so i want to talk about that quickening power and as i was listening and refreshing my self again with it is the rising of the sun this week uh that life came to me because when when the lord helped me to bring this out it was he was showing me something as he always does and i always i take it personally that when he shows me that that it's my responsibility my duty to do my part to as he would as yielding to his spirit to reflect that to you to bring that to you so you see and you feel and you be a part of what the lord had dealt with me on and that quickening power that segue to that is life life because that's what the quickening power is the quickening power is to make alive or to produce life now who else could produce life you've heard brother branham say they can say they can do this and they can do that and their gods and they can create this and that he said well i'll tell you what then go and make me a blade of grass you can't do it right oh they can have cures for this and they come up with medicine they can have bombs to kill a million people they can uh have inventions and fly to the moon and have rockets and and jet propulsion they can do all these wonderful things back in the andaluvian world can build those pyramids so perfectly you could run a razor blade between the between the stones but go have them build a blade of grass they can't do it because it takes life amen and they're not producers of life right brother braham said satan can produce any kind of gift but he cannot bring that word word by word why because that word is life amen truth behind that word 100 truth behind that word brings life because it is life amen that word brings life by the spirit to those who read it to those who uh ingest it it becomes life to them and that quickening power is that life the holy spirit that god brings upon each one of us is that life amen look let's continue to read and you i'll read it the way it's had here now you have to quicken who were i loved that you were dead in trespasses and sins trusting that today you're here this morning you are no longer dead in sin praise the lord notice and we'll get to this in a minute notice dead in sin you are no longer dead in sin you were but now you've been made alive amen god has produced life to you god has produced and made you alive and that's not just alive as far as our human being because we were all alive as humans when this spirit came and brought life to us we were all human life but it's that eternal life actually if you go and you look back in john one and and uh three or four i forget which it is when it says that he was that light he was that life and that light was the light that life excuse me was the light of men that life that life there is zoe's eoe that that is the life of god brother adam told us that's the literal life of god the literal life of jesus christ zoe living in you that's that same life it's his life zoe that same prefix of of of greek now is the same prefix used in the word quicken if you go look up quicken you'll see zoe and this word have the same prefix it's uh uh dzo i don't even know what that is but it's it's dzo it's the same prefix so that quickening power is what brings by that spirit what is what brings that zoe life into you and makes you alive so you're no longer dead that's why the grave can't hold you that's why death can't hold you because you got life you've got his life you've got eternal life you've got a life that satan can't snuff out praise the lord satan can't kill you no more than he can kill god praise the lord because you've been made a lot amen you've been brought to life that quickening power praise the lord wherein look at this now he's still talking about the past wherein in time past ye walked past tents according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience that was all of our lives we all lived that unless you're like gabriel and alice joel and emma that's the way we were that was our lives we walked according to the course of this world in obedience in death we walked in death our bodies were alive but we were walking in death in time past among whom also we all had our conversation when in times past again times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind which is just absolutely engulfing the world today that's what it's all about amen i heard some commentary that was uh somebody going out on the street and was asking random people what do you what is easter not what does easter mean to you just what is easter just a simple question what is easter oh my goodness you hear the question uh the the answers that was given to a simple question what is easter i asked anybody here this morning if i ask you what is easter i'm sure every one of you would give a very appropriate answer i couldn't believe the stuff that some people said some people had absolutely no idea they had no idea and we had joel's uh birthday party yesterday at peter piper and i look around all the people and i thought well no wonder they don't know i look at the the degradation that the way people are but one person one person said i don't believe in god i don't believe in the devil i'm my own god and that's the way it is that's where a lot of people believe today they believe fulfilling the lusts of their own flesh they are their own god and actually they're probably right so many people have become so self-centered and self-absorbed sort of like going back to last week's message that they probably are worshippers of their own selves and that's what that's what a god is and object to worship they probably are worshipers of their own selves that's probably exactly what they do fulfilling the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others we were our very nature commanded us to lie still cheat our very nature that we were born when sin born in sin shaken iniquity come the world speaking lives we were by our nature amen that nature that we were born with commanded that we lived that way it dictated it it it actually uh to fulfill that desire the only way to do it is to do the things of the world and to fulfill the lust of the flesh that was the only way to fulfill it and that's exactly what we did that's what the rest of the world still does but it was our nature and you go back to first john first john 3 9 i believe it is john talks about that that seed that comes in you and that if the seed of god is in you that seed can no longer sin but look at the flesh the flesh is still dead too sin amen but the spirit of god is still alive amen in our hearts the the spirit of god that has come we and changed our nature that spirit literally changed our nature amen and brother branham said that the soul is the nature of the spirit yes but god who is rich in mercy praise the lord amen for his great love wherein he loved us even when we were dead were again were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved now look at this look at how uh paul is phrasing this because it goes back to the first verse and even the second verse where we were even when we were dead were dead in sins that means that we were sinners and because of that we were dead we had no life we had human life but that was it the life that was in us was was a life of death sounds contrary but that's exactly what it is it's a life of death that spirit of the enemy has life it it it moves his principalities powers of the earth we know that it has influence and has great influence over the world today but it has no influence on a child of god because that spirit is of death and the spirit that's in me is life amen that life is the life that god gave yes that life because he lives is the life that he give to us that we can live yes we were dead but now we're alive but what were we dead in we were dead in sins our sins our trespasses are missing of the mark not not not the little things that that we do in the flesh or mistakes we make and things like no no no it was the very nature that you lived by the very nature that you were born with is what commanded this sin that's where the death was because that's the center of every human it's the soul the soul is the center of the man and if the soul is blocking then the man is blocking because it's the nature of the spirit the spirit's the nature of the body and if the soul is blocked and the body is black but when life comes in the soul then it creates life in the spirit amen the human spirit not the holy spirit our human spirit which creates life in our human bodies amen makes it alive now that's why our human bodies are quick and even that's why god even if this body goes by the grave that spirit will come and pick this body back up again i don't care where it is in the world i don't care if an ash has been dropped in every body of water on this planet when god's voice cries out every single one of those elements will come back together and produce me again or you or whoever because it's life right it's life it's not death anymore it's life we were dead in sins our sins because the death because of death made us made us in sin put us in sin but now being born again we're not dead in sin but we're dead to sin yes praise the lord amen sin has no more home on me why because i'm dead to it it has no more grip on my life because i'm dead to sin once i was dead in sin now i'm dead to sin everybody because sin has no more grip on me because why because he had quickened us together amen talk about equipment power saints made us a lot brought us together give us life together with christ with christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus how did that happen because he quickened you none of that could happen if he hadn't quickened you if god had made you alive there's no way you could be with christ there's no way you could be raised up in heavenly places with him there's no way we could be like him there's no way that he could have a part of us because we were dead but because of the quickening power it come into your life and made you a new creature it brought you out of that life of sin and degradation and you because so now you were amen amen you used to be that old man is dead now notice let's go look at uh look at something saint matthew again again i know you're hot but look at it this way i'm hotter than you appreciate it praise the lord i thought i thought we don't i don't even think we have do we even have a fan i don't even think we have a favorite we got heaters but we don't have fans yeah brother crack a door in the whole world that's all right let the whole world hears matthew chapter 13 praise the lord now remember zoe that uh holy spirit life zoe is the literal life of god the literal life of god you know i see different ones fanning and i uh her message is brother brown before they got air conditioning in the tabernacle in jeffersonville indiana with no air uh the humidity sweating i i think we've still got it good but amen we'll not we'll still get the air fixed matthew chapter 13. let's start with verse one let's look at this this life it's life we're talking about life that's the quickening power is that life you go back and listen to that uh the the rising of the sun you hear well brother branham he just nails on that life that life because he recognized this when he died at calvary we talk about the blood and the shedding of the blood and the blood and that is true but it was the life that was in the blood is what came back on the worshipper the chemistry of the blood fell into the earth now it was the purpose of that because that chemistry redeemed this ball of dirt we live on back to him but it was the life that was in the blood that blood cell was broken at calvary with the crucifixion of jesus christ then and when that blood cell was broken it released the literal life of god almighty himself amen and that life come back on the worshiper at the day of pentecost yes and on down because that was just a promise to them now now that promise has been to them whosoever will believe i believe how about you well then it's to you praise the lord when that blood cell was broke that life was released that light now comes and lives in you yes praise the lord now that can be raised up in heavenly places in christ jesus matthew 13 1 the same day went jesus out of the house and set by the seaside great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into his ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sore went forth to sow now look i'm going to read through this follow it if you will with me and he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and the vows came and devoured them out some fell upon stoning places where they had not much earth forthwith they sprang up because they had no deepness of earth and when the sun was up they they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground brought forth fruit some a hundred some sixty some thirty fold who had ears to hear let him hear now look at the progression that jesus is giving them in the parable he's telling them first of all a sower went forth to sow now what's a seed the seed is life god made every seed to have the life that it needed to reproduce within itself every seed whether it's botany life animal life or human life every seed that was needed for reproduction was placed inside each vessel with life contained in it so every seed so if you see a seed it comes out it has that life in it if that life can get to a specific place and the right conditions and atmosphere and all can can be met then that seed will bring life it'll reproduce itself yeah but now these seed is the su the seed is the word we know the seed is the word amen so as this sower went forth to sow seed some went by the wayside and the fowls came and ate them up right so it was just food to the fouls that's all it was it never germitized it never produced anything it never brought forth any kind of life it was just eaten by the birds now the second that fell in stony places say a stony heart amen our hearts should be changed to a heart of flesh but if it lands in that stony heart where it doesn't have much earth it springs forth because it still has life in it it springs forth but it doesn't produce much it doesn't it doesn't come go very far because it has no root amen um and if there's if there's no root for it to take hold as soon as the hotness of the sun came up and we could say the s-o-n not just the s-u-n amen when the word really comes and produces itself in people's lives are they going to be able to take it are they going to be able to live it are they going to be able to produce it amen because if not then it's fell into some stony ground and when the sun came up it scorched and withered it away so it had no roof so it had a it had a little germination to it it dermatized just a little bit enough to spring forth but then it withered away now the third one was it fell into ground but it fell in a place to where it was thorns and thistles and everything around it and and it and it grew up and it got bigger than all the first two before it this third one it got bigger but as it started to get to a place of maturity when it really started to get to the place that it received a revelation of the word of god and it set into true meetings with holy ghost-filled people and hearing the word of god preached in the message of the hour then the thorns and thistles began to choke it out right it began to do before it got to that place of full maturity it choked out and it went away don't we see a lot of that today saints yes amen of those that came far and they kept going and they grew up and even putting forth a shock maybe and starting to look just like the genuine wheat maybe even preaching this message but all of a sudden these thorns stuck over here and here and this is not right and and all this garbage about the message and it chokes them out and before they reach that place of full maturity it choked them out and they went away and it produced no fruit before it got to maturity remember fruit only produces fruit when it's reached a place of maturity the life is in the seed absolutely but that seed has to die and rot has to die and rot to produce what is in it and when that for when it gets to that place of maturity is when it starts bringing forth fruit which is the holy spirit amen the holy spirit the fourth one good ground and when that seed fell in good ground it reached to a place of maturity because it had life because it had life it reached a place of maturity and when it reached that place of maturity it began to produce fruit of its own some 100 fold some 60 fold some 30 fold because everybody's different not everybody's the same amen but every fruit that's produced from that seed is ordained of god and every fruit that is brought forth whether it's 30 fold 60 fold 100 fold doesn't matter every single one of them is just as important to god every one of them is just as important to god every one of them means just as much to god god has a purpose for every single one regardless if it's a million-fold or one-fold everyone has its purpose now making sure that you fulfill that purpose of the life that is in you amen because look there's still so many things out in the world today those spirits and principalities powers here that continue to try to choke down and to try to suppress and to try to keep god's children down below what their privileges really are really what they were born to do and produce satan is trying to keep you pressed down and beat down so you don't reach that place that you know who you are that's right that'll bring you to the place of maturity and that'll bring you to the full production of the fruit that god put in your life amen but you've got to die first yes amen you've got to die first what did paul say i died daily yes even paul said my you think if anybody reached the place of maturity his time it was paul absolutely i agree with that anybody reached the place maturity at this time with probably brother branham i agree with that but every day in this flesh we have to die yes so that life that quitting power manifests itself to us praise the lord that quickening power that quickening power is what changes things friend that quickening power is what rolled that stone back that quickening power that now look understand the quickening power is not an external force you understand that the quickening power is not an external force it is an internal force that quickening power should lie in you if you're born again yes if you're filled with the holy spirit if your soul has been the permanent resident of that of of jesus christ himself that quickening powers in you it is an internal force and when that internal force began to stir and the word that was spoken began to manifest that body of christ came back to life yeah the force was already in him amen force was already in him that that quaking power was already his life it was already who he was but he laid in the grave as he went to hell to do what he had to do down there to fulfill the scripture notice i've already turned from it but when that angel told them the angel told himself he is a risen as he told you he would you notice that it's written that the angel that was there said he is risen like he said he would now the word that was spoken had to be fulfilled amen you say well why didn't jesus raise on the first day why didn't jesus raise on the second day why didn't he raise on the sabbath day because it was spoken and when he spoke it it had to be exactly like he said it would be could not be one moment earlier it could not be one day later it had to be exactly the way god spoken and when that word that had reverberated around through heaven and earth for three days finally manifested itself in the body of jesus christ and that quickening power took hold of that body and up he came from that grave praise the lord amen that same power of that word spoken that quickening power in your life is just as important to you today as it was to him then right because as he raised in that life that life that zoe life lives in you right it'll raise you yeah yes amen sure is the world now it'll raise you even more towards the world world could be a figment of our imagination amen you know brother graham said that he said i know he's real he said everything around here could be imaginary or something i could be dreaming this but he's real am i praise the lord that's just as real as anything in real can be yes praise the lord is raising him from the dead but that that seed that that was in the mind of god remember we talked about god's uh intellectual property you being god's intellectual property god thought of you attributes that seed of god that he put down in there praise the lord has to produce what it is to bring forth that life and that life is now lived through you he rose but see when he rose he walked around with his disciples a couple of days but he no longer fulfilled uh the the position of jesus and corporal body walking in the temple and doing miracles he no longer did that anymore when he young at calvary he said it is finished he no longer did that anymore he didn't do it why because he came in you to do it he came in us to do it i believe in matthew 10 that's why he sent his disciples forth going into all the world priests the gospel teaching them and healing the sick and raising the dead and doing all these things that was just a that that was just kind of like the five times of the spoken word you know brother ramsay what you've seen him temporarily my ministry is seeing the fullness of the bride right i think the same thing with jesus is sending his disciples forth and telling them to you go forth you preach the gospel you send the good news you heal the sick you raise the dead if they won't receive you knock them dirt off your shoes and just keep on going amen but he sent them forth what was that it was a preview it was a preview of what was about to happen in the book of acts and jesus death and resurrection produced the book of acts through his children amen amen because that's what he sent him forth through to begin with you think well why did jesus is here why do i need to go preach he's here you know a lot of people had that that old thought about even with brother brown well he's here nobody else can pray for me i have him pray for me well that's all well and good for him but everybody anybody the holy ghost has the right to pray for you yes anybody in fact there was one time if i remember this right uh he was having a prayer line and somebody came through the prayer line and uh sister was sitting there and god spoke to her and said go pray for that sister in the prayer line he said oh no he said god no brother branham is about to pray for her the prophet of god is going to pray for her i told you to go pray for now i'm paraphrasing of course this is exactly how it happened i told you to go pray for she finally got up obedient to the lord she resisted for a little bit oh but brother branham is going to pray for her she'll be up there in no time at all and brother browner will pray for her and she'll be fine i told you to go pray for her she got up out of her seat she went over and prayed later hand prayed for that lady went and sat back down when that lady came up before brother branham she says i don't see anything wrong with you sister you're perfectly fine she said oh i see a sister back there has already prayed for you and you've been healed go on your way amen we try to put it all on brother branham saints but every one of us with that quickening power has the ability and the right and dares i say the responsibility to lay hands and to pray for one another yes yes amen amen we have that ability because that is that that spirit lies within us that authority lies within us when jesus sent them out he didn't send them out just you know because they had nothing better to do he was training them he was teaching them he was helping them to see you go do this so then when he died and rose again they produced a book of acts because of what he had showed them and what he had taught them praise the lord that's our examples today friend amen that's what god gave to us that's the reason that we're able through that quickening power to do the same thing to produce the same life amen he is that quickening power saints don't just put it on back in relig that's one of the worst things about religion and denominations that's exactly what people want to do they want to put everything back on uh uh uh two thousand years ago amen god is the god of today not of 2000 years ago amen he's the same today as he was then he's as much alive today as he was then praise the lord he's a present god romans chapter 8 now amen that life is in that seat but it takes that quickening power to draw that life out of that seat amen that quickening power is what draws that life out produces it manifests it amen amen i'm trying to train myself to get to the place that i say come lord jesus because he promised me he would never leave me or forsake me well if jesus christ never leaves me he's with me 24 7 365 366 leap year then i don't need him to come i just need him to manifest himself in a real way amen i'm trying to alter my verbiage maybe i'm wrong i don't know even here say god come and power memphis manifestation well he's already just manifest himself he's already here he promised he would be amen but if he promised he would be then he's here praise the lord lord just manifest her so let us feel you let us feel that presence real let that pulsation of the holy spirit raise our faith to a place that there'll be nothing impossible to us today nothing impossible to you that's that life tap into it that quickening power romans 8 let's begin with verse 10. and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness look at that now the body is dead because of sin if see this is something that people i think struggle with sometimes sometimes don't not feeling themselves to be worthy enough but paul tells the romans that if christ is in you okay that's settled you are born again amen that's what he's saying you are born again you have the holy ghost not not just an anointing not just a sensation but you're literally truly in your soul reborn of the of the spirit of the life of god zoe lives in you okay that's his that's his first part christ be in you the body is dead why because of sin born in sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies this body doesn't receive a body change until either we go by the way of the grave or it's quickened and changed to go on a rapture right he tells us later here the 23rd verse that that is the fullness of that word or 24th verse 23 to wit the redemption of our bodies that's what we're still waiting for amen our bodies have been redeemed by the blood of christ but we're waiting for that to manifest itself but now he says if christ being you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness amen but if this but now look now though but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you remember it's an internal force not an external force if it dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken or make alive your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you it'll also quicken or make a life this mortal body which is dead because of sin but it is being quickened because of the quickening power and the life of god that's come down in it it's made it a new person praise the lord that spirit of god is working through you've been born again yes amen been born again bodies did because of sin but if that same spirit that raised up jesus from the dead don't worry don't worry it'll also quicken your body your mortal body it'll also raise you up it'll also make you a new creature praise the lord just like it did him because it's that internal force that was in that was in him is in me it's that same zoe life that same quickening power it'll quicken your mortal body amen therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if you live after the spirit but but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live or kill deadens the deeds of the flesh mortifies to kill dead destroy the works of the body then you shall live because the life that was in you will change even your mortal body that quickening power will come and bring life to that body because our souls have already been changed our souls are already uh already the spirit of god it's him that quickening power it changes every facet of our being of our being when you receive that holy spirit saints you receive that with me power yes that quickening power this now it's still and continues to live in us i'm going to close here let me uh go to one more scripture saint john chapter 11. i told you i wouldn't keep you too long today some of you have dinners things to go to family amen and we're still going to observe the communion uh footwashing here this morning saint john chapter 11. verse 21 jesus good buddy had just passed away but he wasn't in a hurry to go see him he went in a hurry to pray for him 20 21 then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hast been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again amen martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life praise the lord which what is he saying he's saying because i am the resurrection of the life he has already risen oh he'll raise again at the last day he's already raised because i am the resurrection praise the lord what does that tell us that just tells us that quickening power he's admitting that quickening power is in him yes praise the lord the quickening power that was in christ well lazarus is about to feel it in his own bones yes praise please he's about to feel it in in the own in his own flesh that's being eaten alive or eaten dead by the skin worms already eaten remember his body was stinking it was past the time of corruption and setting in didn't matter i am the resurrection and the life the zoe he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this what a great question believeth thou this and you think about it i've kind of tried to get myself to the place lately that i'm trying to stop being cynical it's hard when you see some of the stuff out today friend the things people do to their bodies and and everything that goes with it i'm trying to watch my words everything that goes with it and you all see it you know exactly what i'm talking about yes i try not to be cynical i try my best not to be judgmental you know brother branham used to call them rickies and regettas and god refuted him for doing it amen now they might be but brother but god told brother brown some of them is my children right yes i don't know saints and i try my best because i look at it i shake my head and i i start thinking i think god i you it's like brother branham said when he saw that woman with the cankered eyes he said i just felt like going up and said i'm a minister and i pray for the sick he didn't know it was you know the makeup and stuff he thought she was sick literally sick and in his heart he's i want to go pray for her it just becomes overwhelming but i don't want to get judged i don't want to put them in hell when they still have a breath in their body and an opportunity maybe to receive christ yes i don't know but i don't want to put them there amen i don't want to put anybody in hell god help me if not for the grace of god there go i if it weren't for god i'd be there too i wouldn't be here this morning but oh thank god that quickening power when it came across my path i received it and i thank god for it every day that zoe life that lives in me yes help me let's as he helped us we could try to help other people shine that light share that quickening power inside those human beings or our soul brother adam said we're 10 million worlds amen help me if there's something i can do i know we're living in a dark hour saints we're living in a lost and dying world i understand that amen but if there's one that we can help there's one that we can make a difference to somehow amen even if even if i can do something to make their life hear better because this may be all they have you know that's in isaiah that's the mark that god sent them forth that marking angel sent him forth that said mark all those that are crying and signing the abomination is done in the land now i know he was talking about israel and we're talking about the world but they're still humans it just it vexes my soul i i'm i'm gonna say something i might i don't wanna i don't want this to be taken wrong but i saw a report the other day where they had a white house event and the former president not trump but before him came and and had a speech and all this and they had a party afterwards and they were filming and they were showing everybody and and and our and our president the president the current president united states was just walking around looking for somebody to talk to looking for somebody's hand to shake looking for somebody he even goes to the other former president who he was the vice president under tapping his shoulder trying to get his attention he's ignoring him and i gotta be honest i felt literally absolutely sorry for the man my heart broke for him it really did i don't agree with his politics i don't agree with his policies 99 but i felt generally sorry it kind of gave me compassion to think that's kind of the way it is in the world today they made him look like a buffoon it was i felt generally sorry for him it's very it was sad to see most powerful man is supposed to be in the world the top position in this country politically and completely ignored and and and pushed aside basically i felt so i felt generally sorry for him and it may and out and again it it helped me reflect on humanity as a whole not just him necessarily but humanity as a whole i generally feel sorry that there's people who don't know what easter is have no clue about the resurrection of jesus christ have no opportunity or or they have opportunity but they have no desire to be in a church service like this on an easter sunday morning most easter to most people is pushing colored eggs and wearing big dresses and bonnets and stuff if it's not because of the resurrection and power the literal quickening power of the life of god in us what hope do any of us have that's right amen i'll close with this i like what brother green always said he said and and i've said i used to say something very similar to that i'll just tell you what i used to do my my thing was people ask me said i'm born again holy ghost-filled christian i plan to make heaven my home and take as many people with me as i can i've said that for years try to help anyway and brother greene had a version of that too that he used to say independently i didn't know his he didn't know mine he just out there he would speak his behind the pulpit but that's my that's my heart's desire god knows my heart as many to go as possible amen praise the lord let's stand if we could pretty little one if somebody mentioned the door if you can prop if you can get it propped open you want to prop it open amen i'm sorry i guess so i get so lost in this i i just don't even think i i don't i all i can i can see you fanning and hot but i i i just keep on preaching so my apologies but yeah that thing's pretty strong i hope it'll stay open or not amen let's sing a little course amen uh just move right into the communion service here i was going to sing a psalm but let's just sing this as we normally do as always try to sing as we have our communion service here amen we'll just go ahead and get right to that that's all right let's sing this to the lord though before we before we do search [Music] today [Music] [Applause] [Music] somewhere [Music] cleans me from merced [Music] amen praise the lord jesus we'll go and read the scripture first corinthians amen look at this first corinthians chapter 11 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night and when she was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he insuffed saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me whereas often as you drink eat of that bread and drink of this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation or judgment to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would examine or judge or examine ourselves we should not be judged or condemned but if the but when when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he may come together unto condemnation and the rest i will set in order when i come amen praise the lord jesus [Music] amen praise the lord anybody have anything on your heart need to make

carried simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from god and he went to god arises from supper and laid aside his garments took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a base and began to wash the disciples feeding to wipe them with a towel wherever he was girded then cometh he to simon peter peter said unto him lord thus thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i
