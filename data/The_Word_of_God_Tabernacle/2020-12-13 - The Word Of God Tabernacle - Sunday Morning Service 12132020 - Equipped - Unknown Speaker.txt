and what he can do for us and does do for us every day amen he's such a wonderful loving god and i don't know what people do without him saying yeah that's right right i know see people from time to time look into a loved one's eyes and say i don't know what i would do without you but you know friend if i could just look him straight in the eye i believe i do when i look at you but uh i don't know what i'd do without him yeah i don't know what i would do without him i'm thankful i mean my little testimony i appreciate the lord uh blessing me with another year tuesday i'll be double nickels or i say a double portion of grace amen amen i remember back in uh i probably made some people quench a little bit but when i i came we came i was pastoring in florida came to the tucson tabernacle for the convention and um brother ron peterson got up to speak it was the service it was the time that brother greene was just going and telling all the ministers be prepared because i'm just going to walk down the aisle each night and point at you and you better be ready and while brother in the first night was ron peterson and he got up and spoke and the lord spoke to me while he was speaking and said he's going to call on you tomorrow night and i'm thinking i brother green didn't know me i didn't know brother green i just met him for a few minutes basically and i got home and or got to the hotel and when i got to the hotel the lord gave me the subject and the scripture to read and to give for that night for the next the next night and so sure enough brother green came down and pointed at me he started talking about a young man from saint augustine florida pastoring and all and he called me up and i saw i knew you was going to do that and knew exactly the scripture everything the lord wanted me to read but the point getting to is that when i did that i was 33 so i made the proclamation at the time that i was double perfect 33 2 3 twice so i guess now i just feel like i've got a double portion of grace amen amen be 55 tuesday so i'm thankful that god has blessed me with another year and and friend i i if there's another human on the planet more blessed than i am i don't know them i've never met them you probably feel the same way but you can feel that way because that's you but i feel this way because it's me amen and how blessed i really am and i'm so very thankful that god has been so good to us amen amen god's been so good he's been good to me and i'm so very thankful he's always with us amen amen praise the lord god bless you today appreciate the song service amen all that the lord does for us welcome to the streaming amen turn your bibles now let's stand to our feet if we could amen turn our bibles to first samuel i want to read my first scripture the lord uh i actually thought you know last week for two months or so the lord had us coming out of the old testament and then last week it was the new testament and uh and i thought it was going to be the new testament again today but when i was in prayer this morning the lord gave me this scripture to start this off didn't change the subject didn't change the title or the way it was going but altered the direction if you will so amen so we're going to start in first samuel today but before we do let's bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could precious lord jesus father we are indeed grateful of how good you've been to us lord and what you do for us every day father it could never be voiced it could never be said even close in human tongue or lip lord what you've done for us and how good you've been to us yes but lord we're so thankful today that you brought us here to another time of service lord we don't know how many more times like this we're going to have amen i mean 60 years ago brother branham said we may not meet like this again and we may not have this time this time will come to an end and lord if it's going to come to an end when we're so close to the end today lord god we may not have another time like this but i'm thankful lord that you give us the strength the ability the desire to be in the house of god again to utilize this time whatever time it may be god and give you thanks and praise and glorify and magnify your holy name thanking you god for all that you do expecting your holy spirit that sweet anointing lord to once again sweep through this building and touch every heart and life to bring down lord the healing virtues lord and the answers to every question the deliverance of every heart and soul and lord to us your holy spirit god to do the exceeding and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think yes we thank you god for these that have come we thank you for you lord that for your presence in our midst lord and we thank you for this word once again lord and for the revelation of this word may be speaking to us may you encourage us by it may you correct us through it whatever the need may be father i just pray that you speak through these lips to each one of our ears that it would accomplish what you sent it forth for we give you thanks and praise for it lord all the testimonies and songs and god we're just so thankful to you blessed now lord as we commit it to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen first samuel chapter 17 amen i'm not sure if i gave you the chapter my apologies i must not have because i hear a lot of pages turning first samuel 7 chapter 17 amen and we'll begin with verse 37 first samuel 17 37. david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paul of the line and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of the philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee saul armed david with his armor and he put on him a helmet of brass uh put a helmet of brass upon his head he also he armed him with a coat of mail david girded his sword upon his armor and he is say to go he hesitated for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go with these i have not proved them and david put them off and he took his staff in his hand and he chose him five smooth stones out of the brook put them in the shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine you could be seated now if you'd like the lord add his blessings to the word right amen amen now i want to speak on a simple subject today for some reason because now i want to go we can let's just go ahead and move over if we could to ephesians chapter 4. the lord keeps bringing me back to ephesians 4. um i keep thinking that what the lord's wanted to be said is said or maybe it's just not being said within the time limits that we have but for some reason in different ways for different reasons the lord keeps bringing me back to ephesians 4 which is where i was going to start the the subject the service today was ephesians 4. so i want to go back and read ephesians 4 uh begin with verse 10 just as we did the other day ephesians 4 uh verse 10 and um and we'll we'll revert back to david and saul here in just a moment but ephesians 4 um verse 10 is where i want to draw my text now he's uh verse 10. he that descended is the is the same also that ascended far up above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ who we all come in the unity of faith of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god into a perfect manner to the measure of the stature of the perfect the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men cunning crafting is whereby they lie in way to deceive so my subject today is going to be one simple word that is equipped equipped and when um well oddly enough was in prayer yesterday and talking to the lord about what he would have you to bring for today which i often do on saturdays even if i already have a thought or something i feel like that i want to bring or a subject or scriptures or something i usually on saturdays i talk to the lord as i do and i asked him you know about sunday and today and and the lord brought me back to this again and the subject that he put on my heart was the word equip and when i thought about equip uh it brought me back to this scripture because if you if you go and read as as as we've said several times the 12th verse the five-fold ministry is given for specific purpose that purpose is for the first thing it says is for the perfecting of the saints now we know also that that means of course the uh the maturity or the growing up or the reaching to the level of completeness or fully furnished but it also means equipped or to give equipment to or to equip someone or somebody so this word perfect also means to equip so when my mind was going back to this to this word equipped and being equipped because friends as you all know we're at the end time uh we're at the end of this world scene and we're at the end of the time of the bride's venture upon this earth as sojourners in this land we know that we're at that point now to what day and time month year we don't know but i believe we're at that time and i don't think anyone would disparage that i believe we all believe that we're at the end we're at this time where the lord is soon going to be calling his bride home uh well if the lord is going to be calling his bride home something's going to happen to the bride to bring her to the place in a in a in a way of faith that's going to cause her bodies to be changed as we talked about the other day to go in a rapture to meet the lord in the air uh and and as it has been many times on my heart and mind and i i think back at conversation i have with people and sometimes people say we go to church and we hear the word and we go home and you know it seems like very routine right uh and and sometimes it can feel like a routine sometimes it can feel like we get in a rut but you know if you're going to church and you're obeying the word of god and the word of god is being preached not the word of a man like we said the other day because the word comes the word has to be the word of god it can't be hybrid it can't be mixed with man's ideas opinions it can't be brought from some seminary or some man's doctrine or some man's thought that he thought up whenever he did it has to be the pure unadulterated word of god which we know comes from the pages of this bible which we also know from the pages of this bible come the message of the hour or what we know to be the present day truth amen that present day truth was to come to equip a people amen that word which is the word that word to be able to give people what they need to be able to be ready when god calls them to go home brother banham said that rapturing faith lies in the messages amen i've said this before so i'm just going to say it again if you disagree with me you can disagree if you dislike me for saying it you can you're well pleased to do so but i don't understand why everybody wants to go seeking with every other minister and every other uh evangelist or every other prophet so-called hiring prophet out there i don't understand why everybody wants to garner all their food from all these uh tbn ministers when brother madam said that the if you believe this word and you believe this message if rapturing faith lies in that message why are we going other places amen that's right there's not rapturing faith out there rapturing face right here am i well if it's here why are we going out there that's right you said well i get a cookie or a crumb of bread or something why do you want to get a crumb of bed when we got a whole loaf right right yeah you got a whole factory right that you fake as much bread as you want why it's like brother branham said it's like the little mouse in the gardeners of egypt thinking you know i got to eat this sparingly because i'm going to run out right right and that mouse has probably got enough got enough grain in that garner uh that's a granary to take care of him and 50 generations of rats right but we treat it like you know what we just want to get no it that that's god we're at a place in time we're beyond crumbs we're at a place and time of this life where we're beyond all all the things that's that that you know well brother branham said i know he said it and i'm not saying we're past brother branham trust me because of this message but we're the bride is to a place now the rapture's at hand amen and there's got to be something that brings this bride to the place of being equipped to go in the rapture right and that equipment comes from the word right now if the bible says that the fivefold ministry is sent to equip a group of people then we must know that that fivefold ministry is to serve that purpose by preaching the word of god right to equip her to give her the equipment to be able to use to go forward with amen some people believe that that that brother branham was the only one sent to equip abroad no i disagree with that wholeheartedly friend and you won't find that in the message and you won't find it in this bible amen but some people believe that that brother branham was the only one that was sent to equip a bride i beg your pardon friend the bible says that a five-fold ministry was sent to equip a bride there was a five-fold ministry sent to bring perfection to that bride maturity through the word and that equipping that that gives her the tools she needs so even if it sometimes seems routine and it shouldn't be that way yes sir but if it seems that way understand you're obeying the word right the word is being preached that word will not return void if it's not going to return void then what's it doing it's doing something in your life it's doing something in your spirit and your soul is doing something to you if you won't return void it's accomplishing what god sent it forth for whether you feel it smell it hear it taste it it doesn't matter amen it's doing something to us right and what is it doing it's equipping us it's giving us the equipment that we need now if you go back to saul and david you see that david stepped forward because he was tired of hearing this uncircumcised philistine curse the armies of the living god and he said how dare he through those uncircumcised lips curse my god i'll take care of him i'll take him down you let me at him he doesn't stand a chance and it don't matter how big david was didn't matter how little dave or how big goliath was or how little david was and as david come forth he had to convince saul saul had brought himself to a place so far that god had uh uh that that god had distanced himself from saul and actually repented for every making saw in charge but he david had to convince him that he was going to be able to take care of goliath well once he convinced him because god had been with david took care of the bear took care of the lion that was the rehearsals that david needed to be able to have the faith to believe that he could go take care of this goliath he said well this man is going to be nothing more than that line and that bear well those were david's rehearsal those were what david need to give him the strength and the courage to step forward to this uh to this listing that's just his rehearsal well friend what do you think he was being equipped god was equipping david with what he needed just being a shepherd boy just living his life just being who he was sometimes things sometimes people think oh we now we need to go up into some hell in heavenly realm and and we need to grasp all this and bring all this down and all this celestial stuff and make everything spiritualized friend it's just a matter of living your life for god and just being a christian just be a simple humble christian and in his simple humble life david as the as the shepherd god was equipping him but david wasn't doing anything supernatural right he wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary he wasn't praying to go into the third heavens or he was just being a shepherd he was just taking care of his flock that's all he was doing but god in all that david was doing god was equipping him right god was preparing david for what he was going to face so god sent him a lion and and and and then david rose up with the strength and took the line by the bear by the beard and slew it then god sent david a bear david did the same thing took that bear and killed him right right got the sheep and brought him back into the fold took care of his flock that's just what he was supposed to do that was his livelihood that's what he did right that was his life right people think well i've got to do this i got to go here and i got to do this and i got to get this they got to have that just be who you are just be led of god give how make sure that that relationship you have with jesus christ is is pure and right and it's a daily communion with him and let god lead you whatever god wants you to do he'll show you he'll tell you you have to do something extraordinary right just trust god he'll equip you for what you need amen so when david come to the to the to the real test when david come while i say real test david had a lot of tests i think actually goliath was nothing today but i think david's real test was when his own son came out to kill him right right that that to me uh that to me was uh was david's greatest test i think people say well you know the man spit on david and they want to take his head off he said nope god told him to do that i think that was a great test i was a test greatest test is when the man's son tried to kill him to me my opinion but when he come before goliath and he come before this great test now god's equipped him saul finally believes him or at least lets him go and then saul tries to equip david not knowing david was already equipped right he didn't need saw's equipment he needed god's equipment right he didn't need man's equipment he needed god's equipment amen and god had equipped david so when saul tried to put all this equipment on him even he waited he he couldn't go and he said i i can't go like this this is not my life this is not what guns done for me this is not how god's led me this is not what god has produced in my life and he got rid of all that and he took his shepherd's staff and he grabbed five stones right that's all he needed why because he was already equipped exactly god had already equipped him what did he equip him with the faith amen he equipped him with the faith to be able to face the giant right that's the equipment david needed right for his faith to get to the point that's why he said that bear that a circumcised list is going to be the same as that bear in that lion well how'd he speak he spoke that by faith right amen he didn't know that because it hadn't happened but he knew it by faith and by faith that it already happened so he quit in my faith so he just took his staff and the five stones and he went forth to meet the giant he just put one stone in slung around bam dunk gone over okay he's cut his head off it's finished and just keep marching on people are celebrating and shouting and screaming oh that's wonderful great revival time but it was just life to david that's all it was amen and david was equipped because god equipped him man will try to equip you but god man can't equip you for what god wants to do for you god has to equip you for that yes and god sent a fivefold ministry to bring that equipment amen amen it's a five-fold ministry that perfects the saints equips the saints for the work of the ministry and again to build up to edify the body of christ not tear down not ridicule not put down right not beat up right but to edify and to lift up that body of christ amen to bring that body of christ to a place that in themselves they know they have the faith to meet the challenge yes if a minister is not raising a congregation by edification or building up to equip them with the understanding of faith that they themselves when they need that giant can slay them amen they don't have to call the pastor right although you're welcome to your next call absolutely or any brother or sister or put on facebook or put on a text or an email or whatever you want to do that's fine and dandy but you know that you've been equipped am i and that you have been edified and built up in faith to the place that when you meet that giant it has no chance amen right when you meet that devil it has no chance right they know they have no chance but they come anyway and you know you're the winner but they still keep coming but you are equipped you are built up to the place that you know that you can take care of it when the time needs yes you can take care of the enemy when the time comes when he comes in like a flood god raises up that another standard and all you do is take that smooth stone and whack him right between the eyes down he goes again amen down he goes again amen it's your faith not david's at your feet praise the lord because you're equipped now the word the word gives us the equipment because that's what the fivefold ministry is supposed to do is to bring the word of god right faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god amen how can anybody know what the word says unless they have a preacher right is that what romans says right it's a preacher that brings the word it's it's the preachers the minister that brings the faith that equips the congregation that equips and and you may not realize but the the ministry is being equipped at the same time right we're being equipped at the same time because we're just like you yeah you know we're just human just like the rest of us we're all human we're being equipped at the same time because this is god not us right this is the gift of god not the gift of man this is not something that man's equipped it it's not something to go into a seminary in god this is god's equipment amen and god equips us for what he wants done right man gets you put for all they want to get done but god equips us for what he wants done amen praise the lord and that equipment god brings brings us into his place his position now what is it 13th verse now till we all come into what a unity of the faith amen well the fivefold ministry is an international ministry right the brother of adam as he says he didn't literally go seven times around the world but went this message seven times around the world messages all over the world now i mean in all kinds of places and books and tapes and tablets and whatever else they can stream it they can hear it from all kinds of places in the united states and around the world they can hear it they can pull this up they got youtube over in ghanda they can pick it up and and watch it right all over the world yes this ministry is an international ministry because this bride is an international bride right so this faith for this bride has got to be an international faith it's got to be a unity of faith not just us here not just tucson or arizona in the united states it's faith and the unity of it has to be international right that's why the same word has to be god's word now see if man's word is mixed in there then it's going to be different church to church place to place is going to be different god's word is going to be changed it's going to be altered hybrid it's going to be different but if it's god's word god's word is the same it does not change if it's god's word and these men are preaching god's word then the same results are going to come whether you're in china or africa or asia or india or russia or the united states it's all going to be the same so we're all going to come this bride is all going to come to a unity of the faith amen a faith that's going to do what to her it's going to cause her to go in a rapture it's going to cause a body change and we're going to leave this place because the unity of it of the bride internationally now i guess maybe that's why the lord keeps bringing me to that place but look for a moment because the word now the word does equipping and we know the word just a couple of things the word does the word is a sharp two-edged sword that gives you something to fight with right it's also faith the word gives faith so if the faith if the word spoken in faith brings faith by revelation because faith is a revelation to take that two-handed sword remember when brother branham had that vision right here in sabino canyon and that sword struck his hand what did that voice tell him it was the sword of the king it was the sword of the king which was the word which is the word brother brown said that and we know that's what the word says yes the sword is the key is the word so if the sword is the word but then he said that it takes a strong hand of faith you remember that yes amen go back and i believe he said in the breach you go back and listen brother says but it takes the sword is there friend right but it takes the strong hand of faith to take it to the heart of the enemy amen right amen takes a strong hand of faith to take it to the heart of the enemy well how do they have that by the edification by the building up by the equipping or perfecting of the saints that's what happens is this this is not in vain this morning amen this is not routine this morning this is not uh uh uh something that we just push off and say well it's just a it's a part of my life no no no no it can't be a part of our lives right if this you hear me today if this is a part of our lives then our lives are for nothing because this can't be a part of our lives this must be our life amen god is not a part of my life he is my life god cannot be a part of your life oh i'll slot him in here well he's not a news program or some television station trying to decide when they're going to pro god is your life or he's nothing right right he's life or nothing so he's not a part of life you just slot him in when you have time for him right you know he is life right that's right his life amen and if he's here and he's speaking then god is giving us the equipment that we need yes now look at the word equip i looked it up the word equip means to supply with the items necessary for a particular purpose to prepare someone yes to prepare now it may seem as i said before routine it may seem like it's uh on and on and it's just something that uh that well it's sunday morning we go to church it's so far beyond that for me right amen yes if the word is being projected if god is here and pleased if his spirit is moving and his word is being ministered by the word and the spirit then god is bringing to pass in us what we need so when the time comes we don't have to search for it it's already there it's already about right the faith's already there the words already there you might not can recall uh a a book page line right chapter or verse but you know it am i you know it because it's not a word on ephesians 3 1 is a word on a page that word what it says is in you as a living word no matter whether it's ephesians 3 1 or not that's a written letter that letter kills but when that letter comes real in you it's a living word then amen it's not just words on a page and when god comes and speaks that and reveals it it becomes alive in you you might not feel it you might not know the difference friend but the result is being manifested period because that's what the word says yes it has to be whether you feel it or smell it or any of your senses declare it doesn't matter it's happening it's happening now if a person comes and they're just napping her this is their favorite nap time or they're just coming you know for other reasons and they really don't care and they're not listening that's different right now they'll not re it'll still not return void but they might actually be worse than they are better oh boy but a true christian a born-again christian someone who is here because of the beckoning of the lord and his word and desire to hear the word of god priests and let that word come into their lives it will manifest in them what god said it would do yes it will perfect the saints it will edify the body of christ it will bring a unity of faith it will supply the items necessary to you yes for a purpose yes and what is that purpose our ultimate purpose anyway there's multiple purposes to this obviously yes but the the main end result purpose is for body change to go on a rapture yes to leave this world that's the main purpose of course it comes as a sword now the sword comes so you have something to defeat the enemy with while you're here amen and the strong hand of faith to take it to the heart of the enemy right praise the lord that's where the edifying comes you're perfected you're built up equipped bring the faith you see the dual purpose now the equipment of perfecting and the faith of edifying to take that word and bring it to the heart of the enemy to equip and prepare us for a rapture amen because all those those are just our homework that's that's just what god's doing for us now david had the line and the bear that was his homework amen joel has homework and when because joel goes to school when we went to school we had homework yes well the homework is just something to help us that when we get back to school we know what we're doing right right oh yeah i remember that that that's just something tangible natural that you can pull pull on but you say well yeah i and then when you see it in a test then when the real test comes you say oh yeah i remember that yeah that was that hard work and you know the answer you've got it there there it is simple you pass the test right amen some people do better at it than others amen i'm a hard learner but the lord's always blessed it right my wife would get mad at me because she said i've studied my brains out and got a d and i fooled around in class and got a c i didn't do anything i'd read i'd read listen uh this is probably not good [Music] especially for the young people for ajo kids if you're watching close years i'd read the front the middle and the back of a book and i'd write a full book report on it and get a b wow i don't know how but that's just the way that's just just for some reason uh i'd be kind of like micah you know he's god's just like i just got to get you out of here and get you out of school so he made a way for it to be able to done and i i just i didn't like to read so anyway but but the purpose of what what the school is is to equip you the purpose that god's got is to equip you the school equips you to try to do good out in the world and get a good job make some good money and so on and so forth god's equipping is to get us ready and to keep us in his purview so that we are uh godly christians wherever we go if we're tending sheep as david did whatever we're doing god takes care of it god equips us because we allow our lives to be filled with the things of god wherever we go what we do we allow ourselves to be filled with the things of god that equipping now to supply those things necessary for that purpose that purpose is to go home amen that's the ultimate purpose to prepare us to go home that's the ultimate purpose that god has now second timothy chapter 3 2 timothy chapter 3 verse 13. listen now god talking to timothy says but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived now that if that's not a a reprimand uh prophecy of today i and it may not have necessarily been that way but that's exactly the way it is today right evil men seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving deceiving and being deceit i heard somebody the other day in politics telling some other politician well don't say it like this because people don't like it when you say it like that and they'll disagree with you and vote the other way right say it like this so that it deceives them into thinking that you're saying something you're not right right and i thought maya that's not a politician to the mayor of the bone i don't know what there is i mean don't don't just tell them what you think tell them what they want to hear right and and word it in a way that you make it do whatever you wanted to do then see because once you get in that seat then you can call shots you can do whatever you want to right right i thought my isn't that just and then when i saw this word deceived it just made me the evil men seducers wax worst words deceiving being deceived but listen now but continue thou in the things which thou has learned has learned equipping and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them whom has thou learned them now hasn't learned them from me thou hasn't learned them from perry green thou has learned them even from william branham you have learned them and been equipped by them from god just like all the rest of us have just like i'm equipped by god just like brother branham was just like brother greene was all equipped who brings the equipment he's god's equipment man doesn't know i have to slice that that's why that's why i pray usually on saturday lord what would you have me say something i have no idea what you need amen i have no idea what god wants indeed to say for this day right so i if i don't know then what good is any of this but he does he does and when he gives it and he ministers the gift it's him that's him praise the lord so he's saying remember from whom thou hast learned them and that and that from a child that has known the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for regret uh for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen perfect same word and thoroughly furnished well the word furnish is basically the same as the synonym if equipped when you're being equipped with something you're being furnished with something you're being given something something's being imparted to you so that you can utilize that at a specific time that you're going to need it right we bought these chairs in here because we knew that we had church there's going to need to be a place for everyone that comes to sit down right right now you put them to use now the seats are being utilized for the purpose they were furnished in here for amen praise the lord i seem so simple friend i don't mean to simplify that to that point but but that thoroughly furnished can help us understand spiritually where we are spiritually where we are now we could have bought these chairs and we could have set them in here but if nobody come to set in them what purpose do they serve right right they have to be utilized before they fulfill their purpose that's why you are here that's why you come and sit in them because now you utilize the purpose they were purchased and put here for that's what the equipping does it brings it it not just equip but there has to be a utilization of the equipment right right which is what i want to get to next there's got to be a utilization of that equipment uh let's go i already i quoted this scripture romans i was going to read the romans we talked we already uh uh are already paraphrased that uh i'll read it quick through here because i had it written down so uh romans 10 14 if you want to write it down how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him to whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher amen how shall they preach except they be sent well there's a lot of people out there probably that do try to preach that aren't sent they do it for ulterior motives usually different reasons popularity money as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace bringing glad tidings of good things that feat is possession of course footsteps possession but they have not all obeyed the gospel for as i said the lord uh lord who hath believed our report so then faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of god hearing by the word of god through who the preacher amen the minister faith comes by hearing the word now faith also comes when you speak it when you read the word faith it still generates faith you understand correct but the the scriptural prescription for it is for the fivefold ministry to bring the pure word of god in settings like we have here today to bring a unity of faith that's why these settings like this happen all over the world all week long depending on where you are right what time it is brother roger comes and he has a 9 30 service in here 7 a.m or 7 p.m i think in africa where he reaches most of his people at uh on sunday mornings it's it's in the evening over there see but it doesn't matter i mean what what does time matter the gospel's the gospels but now these chairs are here and they're not being utilized what's the purpose of it a person could come in and say well why do we even have these let's just sell them and get rid of them i could use the money on something else i could do something else if this building beautiful building that's been uh put together like it has for this purpose to be able to come and meet together like this and what good would it be if nobody came right what good would it be if it wasn't being utilized to where it could serve the purpose that it was furnished for amen well let's go to uh uh first corinthians i believe that's where i want to go first corinthians 14. hmm amen i'm gonna i'm gonna come back to that one let's go over to revelation revelation chapter 19 because we're talking about the utilization of it the utilization of the furnishings the unit the utilization of the equipment now if we've all been equipped with something that doesn't mean that um it is for the equipment's for you uh the equipment's been given to us i fight for me i fight for you but you fight for you you fight for your family we fight for one another but i can't put you in heaven you can't put me there you can't put your family there you can't put your brothers sisters mom dad spouses children grandchildren you can't put them there right they can't put you there right the equipment has to be utilized by the individual now you know you could sit there and as as brother dennis said early and i believe in faith and i absolutely believe this that leah's going to be sitting there yes i believe that when we were at the other place i still believe it and it whether the fact that she's there not there now doesn't matter right right that's just circumstance i'm not bothered with that that doesn't matter amen so the utilization of her seat is still uh not being taken care of until she comes and sits in it right then it'll be utilized for the purpose that it was sent for you say well there's some books and stuff like that but that's not what they were put here for they weren't put here for songbooks and tissue boxes and stuff they were put here for you to sit in for people to feel them that's why they're here yes and you could put that stuff on the floor amen don't put your bible on the floor i don't like amen right don't put the don't put it don't ever put your bible on the floor put anything on your body my dad taught me that when i was a little kid and i and i tell you i i've been places at times and i think where there's no other place to put it or there's no other place to set something and i try to put it in and i just can't do it i'll hold on to something before i'll put it on my bible wait amen i'll hold my bible before i put it on the floor yeah just don't do that anyway but these books and these uh tissue box they can sit anywhere these seats are for you these seats are for people see utilize them now revelation 19 let's read uh beginning with verse five and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and of the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigning praise the lord amen amen i believe we're going to do that here too amen but i'm looking forward to doing it there as well let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come the marriage of the lamb has come i believe a prophet spoke in 1965 november thanksgiving message in shreveport louisiana invisible union of the bride of jesus christ amen let us be rejoice be glad give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready so what good does the equipment do if you don't use it right what good is being equipped with something you never utilize well god's not going to equip you something with something that you're never going to use god's not going to give you something that's just going to be a waste of time that you're never going to need but if the bride made herself read think about this if in ephesians chapter 6 in ephesians chapter 6 says that we should put on the whole armor of god well the whole armor with god we know we can go through it find out we did one time one service but the point of that scripture i want to get to is the part that says put on right we put on the whole armor amen that's your job god has given to you the five-fold ministry has is out there giving and equipping people now the equipment is there but it takes you to take it and utilize it and use it and do something with it because the bride has made herself ready put on the whole armor of god yes the ministry equips her so she can put on the whole armor of god and make herself ready praise the lord amen now if you read the whole armor of god of course that speaks more of a warfare type of armor but that same armor is the same word that cloaks this bride in the pure word of god that is the righteousness of the saints amen amen that's what we started this service with there's power in the blood yes that blood that stands there on that mercy seat taking your place it stands there on your behalf and takes your place so you can take his place because that blood is wiped your slate clean invisible union it has made you guiltless justified as though you had never done it in the first place well if you never did it then what is this equipment for is to dress you is to prepare you is to get you ready and equip you now now the bride makes herself ready you don't come to church and say oh i did my penance i come to church or i watch the streaming or i did my pen so okay good now leave me alone i got the rest of the week to myself no no no it doesn't work that way amen right it doesn't work that way yes i have nothing to myself everything i have is god amen yes people i mean you know the bible talks about tithes and offerings and ten percent every bit of it's god's amen right now he said well ten percent's god's no all of it is his mind he's just allowed you to be a steward of ninety percent right yes that's all that's all that is amen he owns all of it it's all his my whole life is his everything is his not just a couple hours on sunday right it's all his amen that equipping that god gives to us that equipment that he gives to us is to prepare us so that we put on that garmer garment so that we put on that armor so that we equip ourselves or take the equipment use the equipment and and prepare ourselves for the battle for the rapture for for everything that god has in our lives that he's calling for us to do you ever heard the phrase i'm sure you have god's grace won't lead you or god's will won't lead you whereas grace can't keep you right well his will is going to equip you his will equip david his will equipped every man in this bible his will equip brother branham and and all of us to this point his will has equipped us so he's not going to equip you or have you do something he hasn't already given you the equipment for right but you got to utilize that equipment amen read your bibles pray seek the lord let god speak to you yes not just on a sunday but put on a tape or something let god feed you yes whatever it is that equipment use that equipment when that devil comes and i know this is this is a struggle for even for me to say but the lord give it to me so i got to say it so here brother newton don't let the medicine cabinet be your first choice right amen yes when when something comes use the equipment god gave you amen don't use the equipment now you can use it i'm not saying don't go there amen but but we're not taught we're being equipped with what god's purpose is for us we don't use man's tools for god's purpose right we use god's tools for god's purpose and if he said by my stripes you're healed that's it you are healed friends period you're healed if he is by his blood he has saved you you are saved do you believe it amen amen amen well that's just utilizing the equipment right if you believe you're saved if you believe you're born again if you believe you're filled with the holy ghost that just means you've utilized the equipment god gave you that's as simple as that now utilization of that equipment still continues on with where we are today that voice that voice that speaks out now the voice he's talking about here he said the voices i heard were the voice voice singular of a great multitude well that multitude was right raising their voice in unity a unity of what a faith the voice of many waters many waters now brother brahm explains to us that this was the ministry the word going forth but he declares it as one voice what's that one voice saying that one voice is god's voice ringing through a mini-member uh a body to say the same thing around the world but it's one voice because that voice is raising in unity it's saying the same thing praise the lord the voice of of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent look at this reigning look at this in the patmos vision brother branham addresses this voice in many waters he said what does waters represent you want to mark it down turn to revelation 17 15 you'll find the bible says waters which also sickness multitudes people's all tongues all right voice what a horrible thing he says for a drifting soul on the sea of life no pilate to guide him loose floating with the tides to hear the roar of the great cataracts the falls what a horrible thing it would be for a soul drifting the voice of many waters what is that voice it's the judgment the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there amen praise the lord equipping preparing ministering also that voice of judgment that's calling out because what becomes a voice of deliverance to the believer is a voice of judgment to the unbeliever the same word that saves you is the same word that condemns the unbeliever amen voice of many waters cried out thickness multitudes the voice of those seven stars in his hands of every church age preaching the baptism of the holy ghost baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues power of god the resurrection of christ second coming divine judgment the voice of many waters come forth this one he looked like the son of man many waters what'll it be to know that you said in a meeting heard that you should get right with god and receive the holy ghost and a drifting soul to hear that voice speak out in that meeting and you said in that meeting and heard the judgments of god priests and you refuse it right oh god it's the same voice that voice in many waters equipping is that same voice that's speaking out and still speaks out to people today repent or perish repent and get right with god amen or you'll be drifting lost on the sea of life no pilot to guide no way to go horrible thing drifting oh god there's souls out there today like that friend god help us to be able to do our part to maybe bring some of those souls in amen help some of those souls here and to see birth pains brother brown said the bible said his wife has made herself ready at the end of the age how did she make herself ready to becoming his wife and what does she what kind of garment she has on is his own word she was dressed in his righteousness amen in his word his word is her garment his word is her equipment his word is what the ministers bring to equip and to get a people ready yes a unity of faith a coming together now what happens when there's a voice that's out there that's screaming and crying in in in the wrong direction what if there's a voice that's calling people off and going and follow me come to this church or whatever it is out in the world today it's that uncertain sound brother graham talked about an uncertain sound that speaks out right the old testament when it was time for this people to do something they didn't just they didn't text one another they didn't email each other they didn't pick up a phone cell phone they had a trumpet that blasted out and that trumpet could reach the ears of millions across through those valleys and those deserts and out in the forest regions and echoing off the rocks and around everybody can hear it but if that trumpet is being sounded it would be sounded in a specific way to tell them whether they go into war or whatever the the situation gathered together whatever the situation was a feast that trump it would sound well what if that trumpet sounded and it didn't sound to tell those people what was going on what if an army was approaching and about to slaughter them and the trumpet sounded that it's time for a feast everybody would be gathering with paper hats and blow things and they would and a wars coming up with swords and and devices to kill them with they're not ready for battle right because the the trumpet gave a wrong sound the people heard it as they sound a festival a party when the sound of war is taking place amen when an uncertain sound comes how do people know to prepare themselves right that's where the voice of the true ministry comes the present day that brings through a through a five-fold ministry right in first corinthians 14 verse 6. now brethren first corinthians 14 6. now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine in other words i just come jibber jabber to you even if it's true godly holy ghost tongues what prophet what does that do for you how does that profit you you don't understand i've heard hundreds if not thousands of people speak in tongues in my life mostly back in the 70s but nevertheless i've heard lots of people speak in tongues i've never once understood any of them not saying i couldn't i could if the supernatural came and god uh i mean i've heard several testimonies like this but brother brother greeting and used to tell the testimony he went to uh to mexico i believe it was or south america anyway wherever it was in spanish speaking and and some sister would come up and she was speaking spanish he understood her in english he spoke in english and she understood him in spanish i mean that's absolutely that's god yes i mean that's just supernatural of course but if you're just sitting in church like this somebody rises up and a gift manifests itself in tongues you know i've never understood anybody right that has said that never i don't have the gift of interpretation or at least it's never manifested itself in me to actually understand to interpret that i know people who have but i have it i don't understand what they're saying that's what paul's saying if they're just if they're just speaking in tongues you can understand what they're saying he said it's more profitable if they come to you if if if he is saying speaks to you uh by revelation knowledge prophesying doctrine something in the english language of the language you understand that profits you and even though and even things without life-giving sound whether pipe to harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what has piped your heart like the trumpet right for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle how do you know if you don't know what the trumpet's saying right right so likewise you accept ye utter utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it uh be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air in other words you just speak out it doesn't mean anything right you could go out in the middle of that parking lot not a soul within 100 yards and you can talk all you want you can jabber and you can blabber you can say whatever you want but it's not going to do anything it doesn't amount and nobody hears you nothing's being accomplished no one's being equipped no one's being helped no one's being blessed amen now if you want us down in the corner and god's called you to preach the gospel there'll be somebody to hear you right but if you just go and just talk it it's not gonna it's not gonna profit anything well it's just the same thing if somebody comes in there and they call themselves a minister or they try to take the word of god they're just speaking their own ideas or they're just speaking what they got out of a seminary or they're just some man's opinion or thought or idea or made-up prophecy if they're just speaking that he says just like speaking in the air doesn't mean anything there's nothing profitable to that there's nothing helpful there's nothing equipping about that it's an uncertain sound but when this word comes forth you are born again you have the holy ghost and that word comes forth it witnesses to that spirit that's inside you amen and that word quickens in you and you become a living word amen now you're the you're the living embodiment of jesus christ the word manifested in the flesh that you are sitting in today right and you take god's equipment and make it work yes for whatever you have need whatever the lord is calling you in your life whatever god wants you to do yes and it may not be the same thing for your entire life right god may call you for something for a short period of time and he may leave out of that and call you for something for another period sometimes we get this opinion feeling that that you know once something is said it's set in stone no god can do whatever he wants to whoever wants whatever he wants hi everyone that's god amen i mean we talked about this building i i we trust and we pray and we put a lot of work and money in all of the building and it's a nice place and i love it and i hope we're here for a long time but god may call us something else tomorrow i don't know right that's up to him i don't believe he will but that that's his choice but whatever's next or whatever else comes god's equipped us for it right god has prepared us god has made us ready amen made us ready the fivefold ministry is to edify amen is to perfect equip build up get you to the place if i can leave you with this thought to get you to the place to get us to the place god to get us to the place with the equipment he's given us that when the challenge comes we have what it takes to meet that challenge right amen we have what it takes to meet that challenge god rises in our life you speak the word and and that that devil has to obey what you say yes that's right that devil has to obey what you say because it's your word by god through the equipment he's given you it's not just to stand up like the vagabond you and say oh well just go away because this is i say who jesus and paul preached no no no right i come to you in jesus name brother you can just preach no no no it's got to be yours got to be you your equipment don't use my equipment yes sir use yours right god's equipped all of us and we've been equipped that's why that's one big reason the the five-fold ministry is so essential that god has given us today to be able to equip us and get us ready to go into a rapture yeah it's a little more challenging under today's uh uh current circumstances to have a five-fold ministry come through but uh but god still takes care of his own yes amen so people can put it all on brother branham all they want but that's not what the bible says right that's not what brother branham said right right brother madam said god never ordained a mechanical device to preach the gospel right he ordained man to do it amen and he didn't say he ordained me although he did ordain brother branham too he didn't put it on himself he put it on god to man amen use that equipment that god's equipping us with amen and don't just think why it's just church is just routine it was this we sing a few songs and we got up and went home and whatever no no no god is doing something every time we've gone to church every time god spoke to us every time we've heard the ministry speak not just from this pulpit or from me amen but from the bride internationally amen god's equipping us that sword that you have to fight the enemy with that faith that he's given you to take it to the heart of the enemy and that unity of faith to bring this bride internationally together for a rapture amen go home amen to go home unfortunately it seems as though there's certain facets of this message that are trying to get away from the five-fold ministry actually in some cases put down or denigrate the five-fold ministry right but i'm here to tell you what brother branham said amen and what the bible says amen amen yes maybe should have said that the other way what the bible says what brother branham said yeah brother brahma just said what the bible said right right amen to equip us might not feel that way but when it comes up that equipment that you need you have you raise up and you you take care of goliath you take care of goliath amen praise the lord let's stand if we could you know what would it what what would it have been for noah i mean what would it have been for noah if god had said build me an ark and noah and told him exactly how to build it and it was nothing within a thousand miles of what noah needed to build the ark with how what what purpose would that have served right and then god would get mad at noah because he didn't build it no no no god doesn't do that yes if god calls you to something he's equipped you for it amen he's giving you the equipment and if god is calling us saints as a bride to a rapture that means he has equipped us to go in the rapture amen people say where's this rapturing faith coming from it's already in you amen it's already there yes god's just equipping us to get us to that place that we're ready to go home and i believe when that comes it'll be there amen amen david absolutely 100 percent had the ability to take care of goliath long before he ever met goliath but there was no point in doing it or utilizing it until he came together when it came to goliath then he was able to rise up and use what god gave him he met the challenge that's where we're at amen that's where we're at praise the lord amen god equipping us he's made us more than conquerors yes amen more than conquerors praise the lord let's sing that again if we could we've been made and we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ [Music] and we've been victorious through the blood of jesus christ oh hallelujah yes we've been made for this [Music] and we've been made victoria through the blood of jesus christ [Music] hallelujah amen we've been made victorious amen amen how we've been made victorious through the equipment god gave us yes what was that equipment the blood of jesus christ we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony equipment's already there just when you have need of it you utilize it praise the lord and you overcome with it amen victory is mine victory is mine victory today is i lord help me please i thought of singing the victory hallelujah yes victory is one victory is fine victory today is mine will i call satan to get [Music] is [Music] is mine when i told satan to get me behind those knees [Music] [Applause] please i got a savings shouting to victory yes victory is amen hallelujah praise the lord thank you jesus yes amen thank you for the victory hallelujah we are more than overcomers more than conquerors because the victory belongs to us god has made us victors in this battle amen amen i'm so thankful god has already done it he's already given it to us but we still need to make sure every day we take that equipment and we use it utilize it amen now it's not all the equipment but as as the need arises right you use that equipment amen stand your ground you drive that type hope ava amen praise the lord god bless you today i pray you were blessed amen by god's word edified built strengthened amen by god's word amen god by his spirit come and speak amen amen thank you jesus what good would you have been for brother brown we've been up there in sabino canyon and took that sword and and then of course the equipment god was just giving them is a symbol of the word and what part of his ministry was going forth if he if he hadn't utilized it if he hadn't taken it and done what god had commissioned him to do but that just gave him the faith that just gave him the threat to be able to do it so when he came forth he had it in him to be able to do right yes amen praise the lord i'm so thankful god help us amen i believe we're at that time friend the word jesus some pretty bad stuff things going on in the world today yes but god has equipped us for something different amen god's not equipped us for perpetual existence god has equipped us to go in a rapture amen amen praise the lord jesus god bless you today amen appreciate each one of you coming and being here amen now remember uh lord willing unless something changes uh my plans are i'm going

wasn't born in december but i just come to the understanding the feeling in my heart that that he wasn't born in december we know he wasn't but i i don't celebrate his birthday any other time i don't even know when my wife was born she could have been born in december don't know but we celebrate it in july so we don't know we got a one in 365 chance of being right but we don't know uh exactly

forgot to ask pray for my nephew robert uh he came out again out of the anyway he just he was in a mental institution he's an alcoholic and he's just not taking the death of my sister very well he says he doesn't believe in god but when i was talking to him this last time he said i wish i could believe that and so that means to me there's something there is there's a desire yes someone wishes for something that means you have a disarmament exactly exactly and that's tony's son if y'all don't know the sister enormous sister that just passed away so robert's his name if you didn't hear um needs prayer so let's just continue to remember to pray for him i also wanted to remind you to or let you know that i had found out this week that brother johnny green's mother had passed away i
