[41:33] and it was late at night and I the
[41:36] presence of the Lord came over me and
[41:39] caused a
[41:41] shift and it was like the old had been
[41:44] pushed out and the new had been brought
[41:47] in a picture and a feeling and
[41:50] experience that I've never had
[41:53] before and it was
[41:57] with me I haven't quite known how to
[42:00] walk in it
[42:02] though and a song came to me a couple
[42:06] weeks ago this is the air I
[42:09] breathe your holy presence living
[42:14] in
[42:15] and last night I heard Kim CL speaking
[42:19] about our
[42:20] breath our breath is um the word of God
[42:26] and and it's our
[42:29] future um the past is gone the present
[42:35] is is being shot up as we live and but
[42:40] the future is the very Breath of God and
[42:43] that's what God was showing me back in
[42:45] February or something and I realized all
[42:48] that I've been living on
[42:51] Grief
[42:54] my and
[42:58] overpowered me last night and showed me
[43:01] that the direction that I was heading
[43:03] was right and that I've been proclaiming
[43:06] and prophesying over my children you are
[43:09] saved you are you know this situation is
[43:13] like this and just
[43:15] prophesying God's word over my life that

[43:26] say fully know fully but you know this

[44:19] to Lord help U try to have
[44:23] a a message on faith every so often and
[44:27] hopefully a message on the Holy Spirit
[44:29] the things that consider um the more
[44:32] important issues that we face every day
[44:34] having faith so easy for our faith to
[44:36] diminish or
[44:38] amen our faith of the world to take a
[44:40] hit yes with all the things of the world
[44:43] but amen it's always good to understand
[44:45] that faith is what we live by yes

[44:50] the Lord so amen so St John chapter 14

[47:11] commit ourselves to you and ask His
[47:12] blessings Lord in the precious holy and
[47:14] lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[47:17] pray amen amen amen St John chapter 14
[47:22] couple of verses of scripture beginning
[47:24] with the 12th verse
[47:27] John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you
[47:30] he that believeth on me the works that I
[47:32] do shall he do also and Greater Works
[47:36] than these shall he do because I go to
[47:39] my father and whatsoever he shall ask in
[47:42] my name that will I do that the father
[47:45] may be glorified in the son if you shall
[47:48] ask anything in my name I will do it yes
[47:54] praise the Lord amen you could be SE it
[47:57] you'd
[47:58] like ask anything Amen in my name right
[48:03] I will do it now do we believe that or
[48:06] not amen amen it's like the beginning of
[48:09] the service it's like the beginning of
[48:11] when we when we started and recognizing
[48:14] God's already paid for it all God's
[48:16] already done the work we just have to be
[48:19] able to be willing to believe it and
[48:20] step into it yes Amen to live it to let
[48:24] God live through us to let the the
[48:26] blessings that God has given us live
[48:29] through us we just got to be able to
[48:31] understand that faith that we have in
[48:33] God and in his word he said believe uh
[48:36] uh verely verily he that believeth on me
[48:40] the works that I do shall he do also how
[48:42] many of you have read this Bible you
[48:44] don't have to raise your hand but how
[48:46] many of you have read this Bible how
[48:47] many of you have read St John how many
[48:49] you have read this scripture how many
[48:51] have ever heard this scripture read how
[48:53] many have ever heard this scripture
[48:54] preached on and how many of us still in
[48:57] some way just don't be able to to grasp
[49:00] it like we should believe me for the
[49:04] very for verely if you believe me the
[49:08] works that I do so if you've read this
[49:10] if you've heard it if you've heard it
[49:11] read if you've heard it preach if you
[49:13] know the scripture you know the works
[49:15] he's done he told us that we would do
[49:18] the same works as he did if we believe
[49:20] on him amen now he said but then he went
[49:24] on to say and Greater Works and brother
[49:28] brandham talked about well Jesus raised
[49:30] the dead and how could you do something
[49:31] greater than raising of the dead but
[49:34] brother brandham said when he's
[49:35] referring to this what he's talking
[49:37] about is more Works amen nothing
[49:40] necessarily greater in stature to say to
[49:44] raise somebody from the dead because
[49:46] someone who is lifeless giving them life
[49:48] is the epitome of what we could offer
[49:51] someone spiritually or physically more
[49:54] so spiritually but
[49:57] the epitome of what you could do for
[49:58] someone now but he talked that greater
[50:01] more amen a larger amount of these Works
[50:05] shall we do yes this falls on us for us
[50:09] for us to do it amen for us to do the
[50:12] works the Greater Works than what he
[50:15] than than what the scripture says what
[50:17] he did more shall we do now let's go
[50:20] over to First John we see uh some of the
[50:24] difficulties that people have
[50:28] because it said if you believe in me
[50:31] believe have faith amen have faith Bel
[50:35] confidence which this the message today
[50:38] is is to have confidence H having
[50:40] confidence in the Lord amen amen first
[50:43] John now every one of us we always hold
[50:46] the different ones in different esteem
[50:49] as we would brother brandham uh
[50:51] basically it's it's uh it's kind of like
[50:54] a a respect Factor uh that that we
[50:57] should have just just as we have in our
[51:00] Natural Life uh there's respect factors
[51:04] that we should have in our natural life
[51:07] when we're born uh we there should be a
[51:09] natural respect for our parents now some
[51:12] people may have been born in homes whose
[51:14] parents are horrible parents but there
[51:16] should still be a respect factor of
[51:19] recognizing that your mom she brought
[51:22] you in this world that's your dad amen
[51:24] or your mother or your father how it may
[51:26] be there's some fathers that aren't dads
[51:30] but you that's a whole another subject
[51:32] but a certain respect Factor when you
[51:35] start going to school amen you may have
[51:37] the worst teacher that ever God ever was
[51:40] ever put on this planet but you should
[51:42] be a respect Factor Amen to that to that
[51:45] individual that person holds an office
[51:48] over you to teach you yes Amen to try to
[51:51] help bring you to a place of a greater
[51:54] understanding amen as you go grow older
[51:57] and you get a job there should be a
[51:58] certain respect factor that you have you
[52:00] may have again I I keep saying this but
[52:03] you may have the worst boss that there's
[52:05] ever been on the planet Earth all
[52:07] throughout Humanity Humanity you got the
[52:10] worst boss but there should still be a
[52:12] respect Factor there that you have for
[52:14] that person for that boss for that
[52:16] person who is over you amen not that uh
[52:20] you agree with everything in fact uh it
[52:23] may come to a point that you can no
[52:25] longer be under that that person but
[52:27] while you're there there should still be
[52:29] that respect Factor even in in in in in
[52:32] in in government amen uh uh I'm not a
[52:37] fan of certain governments I'm not a fan
[52:39] of certain uh people in offices I'm not
[52:41] a fan of certain uh individuals that run
[52:44] the country um but there should still be
[52:48] a respect Factor amen a respect Factor
[52:52] not NE May uh the I I say this with all
[52:56] due
[52:57] respect uh this may be the worst
[52:59] president ever in the history of the
[53:00] country but I say may I'm not saying he
[53:03] is I'm just saying uh hypothetically he
[53:07] could be just like your boss may have
[53:09] been the worst boss just like your
[53:10] teacher may have been the worst teacher
[53:12] um may have been the worst in history of
[53:14] the of the country but there still
[53:16] should be a certain respect factor for
[53:18] that office amen if you go in the
[53:21] military there should be a certain
[53:22] respect factor that you have in in fact
[53:25] if you uh uh if you don't have that
[53:28] respect factor in the military
[53:31] uh it'll not end well for you let's put
[53:34] it that way um but there should still be
[53:36] that respect factor and that's what we
[53:39] have not that we hold Sate brother
[53:41] brandom in in a different uh esteem but
[53:45] there's a respect factor for that office
[53:47] amen there should be a respect factor to
[53:50] understand that God put him in that
[53:52] place at that time and and and for that
[53:55] reason and that should always be there
[53:57] it should be be there in in in every
[54:00] spect of life in aspect of life and the
[54:03] respect factors may be at a different
[54:06] level amen my my wife is not over me but
[54:10] I have a respect for my wife as my wife
[54:13] amen and and vice versa that's to me
[54:17] that's why a lot of relationships break
[54:18] down because there's there is not that
[54:22] respect Factor there amen she has her
[54:25] wiely place have my husbandly place and
[54:28] we respect each other in that we
[54:30] cohabitate and live together love each
[54:31] other and uh and and under God but there
[54:35] that respect got to be there amen it's
[54:37] got to be there and that's what we don't
[54:39] worship brother bradam but we have a
[54:42] respect amen a respect for that office
[54:45] we have and and that's what gives us
[54:48] that confidence that's what helps us
[54:50] have confidence to recognize that uh uh
[54:54] that what we believe that the Lord work
[54:56] through him uh not worldly sense now
[55:00] we're speaking spiritually now they just
[55:03] typing that together but now spiritually
[55:05] uh we have that confidence in brother
[55:08] brandom to
[55:09] recognize the proves that we saw and
[55:12] heard uh may have been on tape may it
[55:15] been on video may have been by
[55:17] testimonies uh May It Be by just
[55:19] Revelation that God give to us but that
[55:21] brings a certain respect factor a
[55:23] certain confidence to recognize that
[55:26] what uh that that what he did what he
[55:29] said we believe came from God yes we
[55:33] believe was the hand of God and that's a
[55:35] confidence that we have not that we put
[55:38] brother brandom on some pedestal
[55:39] somewhere uh it it would it would well
[55:44] he when people worshiped him he quit the
[55:46] ministry he just left field I mean he
[55:48] said I I won't have people doing that

[55:59] be those things the carnal impersonation

[56:20] this word it can't help you if you don't
[56:22] have confidence in in in the prophet and
[56:25] the words from the word that he brought
[56:27] he it can't help you amen you've got to
[56:30] have that confidence the scripture we
[56:32] just read the Greater Works so you do if
[56:35] you don't have confidence in that it
[56:37] can't help you right Amen brother random
[56:39] said it's not for the unbeliever yes
[56:42] it's not for the person who is not going
[56:44] to believe it because if you don't
[56:46] believe it it won't work and if it won't
[56:48] work you can't have confidence in it
[56:50] amen you've got to have faith in knowing
[56:53] what you're saying and what you're doing
[56:54] you've got to have faith in confidence
[56:56] in what this word says yes and what this
[56:59] word tells you and that confidence is
[57:01] what brings the results that faith is
[57:04] what brings the results that we can
[57:06] believe amen now first John I had you
[57:10] turn chapter 3 1 John chapter
[57:16] 3 amen 1 John chapter 3 let's just start
[57:20] with U let's just start with verse 16
[57:26] first John not St John 1 John chapter 3
[57:30] uh start with verse 16 hereby perceive
[57:33] we the love of God because he laid down
[57:37] his life for us and we ought to lay down
[57:40] our lives for the Brethren now you got
[57:43] to have confidence in to be able to do
[57:45] that am but who so hath this world's
[57:49] good and seeth his brother have need and
[57:52] shutteth up his bowels of compassion
[57:56] from him how dwelleth the love of God in
[57:59] him right my little children let us not
[58:03] love in word neither in tongue but
[58:05] indeed and in truth amen and hereby we
[58:10] know that we that uh we know that we are
[58:14] of the truth and shall assure our hearts
[58:17] assure our hearts before him what does
[58:20] that mean assure our hearts having
[58:23] confidence amen we sure up we we we uh
[58:27] gird up our hearts amen before him
[58:31] knowing that it's the truth see believe
[58:35] faith for for if our heart condemns us
[58:39] condemn us God is greater than our heart
[58:43] and knoweth all things
[58:45] so so many times this this is the weapon
[58:48] I've spoke on this many times but this
[58:50] is the weapon that the devil uses the
[58:53] greatest condemnation
[58:56] to try to condemn you continuously
[58:59] condemn you all the time maybe even for
[59:02] things that he just imagined that you
[59:05] thought or said or did amen maybe not
[59:08] even something you did but that's not
[59:10] the point yes if you have confidence in
[59:13] Christ if you have confidence in his
[59:15] blood if you have confidence in your
[59:17] repentance and Faith then there is no
[59:19] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[59:22] Jesus amen there's
[59:25] conviction when you may do something
[59:27] wrong or go down the wrong path or some
[59:29] sort of iniquity of doing something you
[59:31] shouldn't or not doing something you
[59:32] should there's a conviction that the
[59:34] Holy Ghost will give you to say you
[59:36] don't do that you don't act like that
[59:38] you belong to me you are a Christian
[59:41] amen you're a Christian conduct yourself
[59:44] like one amen amen there's a conviction
[59:47] that comes but a
[59:49] condemnation but what conviction does is
[59:52] it's there to lift you up it's there to
[59:54] encourage you right it's it's there to
[59:56] say you are better than that it's there
[59:58] to say you are a a closer to me you are
[1:00:02] a you are a Christian you are part of
[1:00:04] the family of God you don't act like
[1:00:06] that conviction is to lift up is to
[1:00:09] build up is to help grow a person but
[1:00:13] condemnation is to tear you down right
[1:00:16] condemnation is to condemn you so that
[1:00:19] you feel less than who you really are
[1:00:22] amen and that's what the devil does yes
[1:00:24] the the devil condemns you to the point
[1:00:27] you say well I've done something wrong I
[1:00:30] made a mistake or said something thought
[1:00:31] something whatever it was I made a
[1:00:33] mistake okay we're all human we're all
[1:00:35] Sinners saved by the grace of God we've
[1:00:38] all sinned and come short of the glory
[1:00:40] of God amen amen we agree on that that's
[1:00:43] what the Bible says we all have so you
[1:00:45] make a mistake you've made a mistake
[1:00:47] you've fallen short you've done
[1:00:48] something you shouldn't or whatever then
[1:00:50] the devil's going to try to come and
[1:00:52] condemn you and tear you down to make
[1:00:56] you believe that you're not a Christian
[1:00:58] to make you try to believe that you're
[1:01:00] not who God says that you are who you
[1:01:04] know in your heart you are to tear you
[1:01:07] down to to to break you away from the
[1:01:10] family of God why so you can't have
[1:01:14] faith if he can tear you down enough you
[1:01:18] won't you will lose your confidence you
[1:01:21] will lose your faith and if you lose
[1:01:24] that friend you have nothing nothing if
[1:01:27] we lose our faith in God if we lose our
[1:01:29] faith in God's word if we lose our faith
[1:01:31] in who we know we are as children of God
[1:01:36] then then then the devil's got to hold
[1:01:38] on you and that's what condemn is for
[1:01:41] see and that's why it says if our heart
[1:01:43] condemns us why would the why would your
[1:01:46] heart condemn you because the devil has
[1:01:49] brought something up or even something
[1:01:51] even in the past not even something that
[1:01:54] you recently done or made a mistake sake
[1:01:56] or whatever just in the past and digging
[1:01:58] it up again cuz you know that sh that
[1:02:00] that devil has a big old shovel right
[1:02:03] amen and right on the and right on the
[1:02:05] front of the shovel it says
[1:02:07] condemnation amen and then he goes and
[1:02:10] he starts digging for one purpose and
[1:02:12] that is to condemn you that's to try to
[1:02:15] tear you down to try to cause you to
[1:02:18] lose faith in who God is and who you are
[1:02:21] in him to try to lose confidence and
[1:02:24] Faith to believe that this world is true
[1:02:26] to bring the edification and the growth
[1:02:29] into your life that's what his purpose
[1:02:32] is condemnation so if it says our heart
[1:02:36] condemn us what does that mean well that
[1:02:38] means that the devil's done something to
[1:02:40] condemn you amen or or maybe you made a
[1:02:42] mistake and it's condemned your heart
[1:02:44] you but but see it it can't be condemned
[1:02:48] because God condemned
[1:02:49] it it's if your heart's condemned it's
[1:02:52] because the devil's condemned you right
[1:02:55] to tear you down to rip you apart and
[1:02:58] you say well I actually did make this
[1:03:01] mistake well then let's read on because
[1:03:04] there's a remedy for that too amen if
[1:03:07] our heart condemn us God is greater than
[1:03:11] our heart and he knoweth all things God
[1:03:14] knew it
[1:03:15] anyway God knew you were going to do it
[1:03:18] before you did it God knew you were
[1:03:20] going to say it before you said it God
[1:03:23] knew you were going to think it before
[1:03:24] you even thought it he knows all things
[1:03:28] so God is greater than that condemnation
[1:03:30] God is greater than our heart God is
[1:03:32] greater than any of those mistakes or
[1:03:34] faults failures shortcomings you've ever
[1:03:36] made God is greater than that in your
[1:03:39] heart amen and he has made the way so
[1:03:42] that we can overcome to believe that by
[1:03:45] the blood of Jesus Christ whatever that
[1:03:48] thing is the devil in his condemnation
[1:03:50] shovel is dug up is under the blood of
[1:03:53] Christ and it can never be remembered
[1:03:55] against me again
[1:03:58] everen you say well I make another
[1:04:00] another mistake so he just brings this
[1:04:02] one back up and compiles it with that
[1:04:04] one no no no no when it's under the
[1:04:06] blood Saints it is gone right out of
[1:04:10] God's Remembrance in your book period
[1:04:13] never to be remembered again even if
[1:04:16] five minutes later you make another
[1:04:18] mistake that first one's gone
[1:04:21] right he doesn't just bring that one up
[1:04:24] and bring them together no never ever to
[1:04:26] be remembered again ever you got to
[1:04:28] believe that yes why because that causes
[1:04:31] your heart not to be
[1:04:33] condemned so when the devil takes out
[1:04:36] his big old fat ugly shovel and is of
[1:04:38] condemnation and starts digging up you
[1:04:40] can say devil that's on your head not
[1:04:43] mine right that God put that under the
[1:04:46] blood that that that's doesn't accounted
[1:04:48] to me anymore amen amen my book my book
[1:04:52] says that I am
[1:04:54] free go find that in my book of life go
[1:04:57] find it it's not there right why because
[1:05:00] it's been annihilated by the blood of
[1:05:03] Christ amen those who are born of God
[1:05:08] canot sin rightall if you are born of
[1:05:12] God you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:05:16] cannot sin your name has moved from The
[1:05:19] Book of Life to the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:05:21] which is always predestinated there
[1:05:23] anyway to the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:05:25] there's not one crooked wrong bad thing
[1:05:28] in that book cuz that's the Lamb's Book
[1:05:30] of Life right that's where your
[1:05:32] spiritual birth is that's where your
[1:05:35] spiritual life is all this other stuff
[1:05:37] doesn't matter amen yeah there's
[1:05:40] conviction yeah we we we we should live
[1:05:44] as Christians and conduct ourselves as
[1:05:47] Christians but when we make a mistake or
[1:05:49] fall the little stickiness of our flesh
[1:05:51] or something don't let the devil come
[1:05:53] and condemn your heart you say God for
[1:05:55] forgive me remember that story brother
[1:05:57] Bram told Brother green told us about
[1:05:59] that time he went to Brother Bram when
[1:06:00] they were on the hunting trip and he
[1:06:02] told Brother green uh brother Ram he
[1:06:04] said brother Ram I want to talk to you
[1:06:05] about something he says I know brother
[1:06:07] Perry he said just hold on to it we'll
[1:06:08] get to it
[1:06:10] later oh I know I know we'll talk about
[1:06:13] it later he's laying on the couch and
[1:06:15] brother green brother brother R sitting
[1:06:17] there on the couch with his feet across
[1:06:19] laying I forgot how it was anyway M been
[1:06:21] sitting up with his feet across and
[1:06:23] brother brother green comes into the
[1:06:25] brother Braham says okay now about your
[1:06:29] problem did you I can't imagine what it
[1:06:32] was like in that situation come sit down
[1:06:35] here sit down on the couch come sit at
[1:06:37] the foot on the couch there by his feet
[1:06:40] he said now about your problem and now
[1:06:43] the brother Bram knew and of course he
[1:06:44] told him all and confessed all I don't
[1:06:46] need to go into all that stuff again
[1:06:48] lustful imaginations and stuff and
[1:06:50] brother brah says you got to do like I
[1:06:54] do what
[1:06:59] you you you know what I'm talking about
[1:07:01] right I know exactly what you're talking
[1:07:03] about I'm a red-blooded male
[1:07:06] too the Devil comes to me too amen he
[1:07:11] comes to you too it comes to me too he
[1:07:14] comes to brother he came to brother
[1:07:15] brand too probably even more so amen
[1:07:19] comes to uh uh and I can say this
[1:07:23] because I'm it's my family uh he comes
[1:07:28] after us and PKS as much as in more than
[1:07:30] anybody ask my son right ask my daughter
[1:07:34] at PK's preacher kids uh more than
[1:07:37] anybody amen uh we've lived it friends
[1:07:41] people look say Well it comes at us
[1:07:43] pretty hard we' lived it um I mean if if
[1:07:48] if it's anything he can do to try to uh
[1:07:51] destroy us is to start at the
[1:07:56] right amen you know Israel's having a
[1:07:59] victory this week because they did what
[1:08:02] they cut off the head of the snake that
[1:08:04] come against him AUST October 7th last
[1:08:07] year they killed uh whatever I forget
[1:08:11] his name now uh the leader of Hamas they
[1:08:13] killed the guy The Mastermind behind uh
[1:08:16] the attack of October 7th last year on
[1:08:18] his PE on the people of Israel they
[1:08:20] killed him amen so now they're happy cuz
[1:08:23] what do they do if you can kill the head
[1:08:26] then you can you can kind of try to uh
[1:08:29] make the rest go and disarray right it's
[1:08:32] like the prophecy of Micah Micah's
[1:08:35] remember Micah's prophecy against Ahab
[1:08:37] he says you can go on a head up there
[1:08:39] but I see Israelite sheep having no
[1:08:41] shepher scattered all over the place
[1:08:43] right why because you if you get rid of
[1:08:45] the head then what happens and the body
[1:08:47] underneath it just kind of scatters and
[1:08:49] goes about and is disorganized
[1:08:51] dysfunctional and can't organize itself
[1:08:54] well that's exactly what the devil tries
[1:08:55] to do he come out against brother Brown
[1:08:59] so hard and uh the the the the ones that
[1:09:03] are in position he tries to destroy them
[1:09:06] amen if he can't destroy them he tries
[1:09:08] to destroy them through their families
[1:09:10] uh through their children he does
[1:09:12] everything he can he's ruthless devil
[1:09:15] yes amen right but he says now about
[1:09:19] your problem you got to do the same
[1:09:21] thing that I do amen
[1:09:25] he's a man great brother brand was a man
[1:09:29] praise the Lord Jesus Christ was a man
[1:09:31] right amen of course he lived without
[1:09:35] fault he was sinless amen but brother
[1:09:38] Brown was a sinner saved by the grace of
[1:09:40] God yes he was just a man uh how many
[1:09:43] times brother green tell us let him be a
[1:09:45] man I I I probably fight a allar for
[1:09:48] every time brother green said let let
[1:09:50] him be a man yeah that that's very
[1:09:52] important to understand he was a man he
[1:09:54] said now want you you got to do the same
[1:09:56] thing I do he said now when you get to
[1:10:00] this
[1:10:01] situation and it happens that's why
[1:10:03] brother brandom hung a cross in his car
[1:10:05] right amen so something that he
[1:10:08] shouldn't be looking at he looked to the
[1:10:11] Cross why he's in the car look to the
[1:10:13] cross I remember that time brother green
[1:10:16] he talked about downtown Tucson said
[1:10:18] beautiful looking Mexican woman come and
[1:10:20] walked across the street said brother
[1:10:21] Brown followed her all the way across
[1:10:23] the road and he stopped and come said
[1:10:25] now see brother Barry that's that's what
[1:10:27] we've got to guard ourselves against and
[1:10:29] put a cross this car look to the Cross
[1:10:32] amen now you got to do the same thing I
[1:10:34] do what when you come to yourself right
[1:10:38] and you realize I'm not like that I'm
[1:10:41] not that kind of person I don't do those
[1:10:43] things I don't say those things I don't
[1:10:44] act like that maybe you need to go
[1:10:45] apologize to somebody whatever the
[1:10:47] situation is you see I'm not like that
[1:10:49] he said as soon as you can get a hold of
[1:10:51] yourself right he say God forgive me I'm
[1:10:54] sorry I I didn't mean to do that I
[1:10:56] didn't mean to say that or act that way
[1:10:57] or think that or whatever it was Lord
[1:10:59] forgive me I didn't mean to be that way
[1:11:01] and you know what that instant
[1:11:05] gone that millisecond is gone under the
[1:11:08] blood of Christ never to be remembered
[1:11:11] against you ever again and the devil
[1:11:14] tries to bring it up that's his problem

[1:11:39] they'll come and try to bring that stuff
[1:11:40] up back said he'll try to use look he'll
[1:11:43] try to use vessels if he can to try to
[1:11:46] dig those things up to throw them back
[1:11:48] in your face you know what you do you
[1:11:49] say brother sister I love you but that
[1:11:51] is under the blood it has you have it
[1:11:54] has no business coming across your lips

[1:11:58] thinking about it's done it's over it's
[1:12:00] under the blood and I am free from it
[1:12:03] amen praise God yes I make that mistake
[1:12:07] 10 minutes later same thing yes I mean I
[1:12:11] know that sounds extreme that you know
[1:12:14] make the mistake 10 minutes later after
[1:12:16] you just but that that's the truth
[1:12:18] nevertheless right make that mistake 10
[1:12:21] minutes later same thing come to
[1:12:23] yourself God forgive me
[1:12:25] amen now it's got to be sincere it can't
[1:12:27] be just something that people just like
[1:12:30] Catholics do and say they can just live
[1:12:31] however they want and say you know
[1:12:33] forgive me and you know hell mares and
[1:12:35] pentant whatever it is it's not that
[1:12:38] it's not just say well I can live
[1:12:39] however I want because I know God's
[1:12:41] going to forgive me no it doesn't work
[1:12:42] that way amen it doesn't work that way
[1:12:45] but if you're sincere you're real and in
[1:12:47] your heart and you want to live and
[1:12:49] you're living the best you you know how
[1:12:51] and the life that God's give you and
[1:12:53] you're you're growing in Grace the Lord
[1:12:55] is helping you and you're coming along
[1:12:57] and in your heart you sincerely God I
[1:12:59] don't want I did not want to do that I
[1:13:01] do not want to be like that God it's
[1:13:03] forgiven right it's forgotten it's in
[1:13:06] the sea of God's forgetfulness never to
[1:13:09] be remembered again amen praise the Lord
[1:13:12] you know where it goes It goes back on
[1:13:13] the head of Satan lays there till the
[1:13:15] day of judgment hallelujah praise the
[1:13:18] Lord say well God forgets it God can't
[1:13:21] forget anything simp I said God doesn't
[1:13:23] forget anything no but he doesn't
[1:13:25] remember against you right he doesn't
[1:13:30] remember it against you where is it it's
[1:13:33] on the head of the devil that's where it
[1:13:35] is and you know what the white Throne
[1:13:37] judgment who's going to be responsible
[1:13:39] for every bit of it right the devil
[1:13:42] that's right amen not you the devil
[1:13:46] praise so if your heart condemns you God
[1:13:48] is greater in our hearts he knows all
[1:13:50] things he knew you'd fall in that trap
[1:13:52] he knew you'd make that mistake he knew
[1:13:54] you'd say that he you God knows amen
[1:13:58] even if you fall even if the devil
[1:14:01] tempts you a h hundred times you fall
[1:14:02] one out of a 100 doesn't matter he knows
[1:14:06] yes God knows and our heart condemns us
[1:14:09] then God is greater than our heart amen
[1:14:11] so the point of it is don't let your
[1:14:14] heart be
[1:14:15] condemned because when your heart
[1:14:17] becomes condemned you lose confidence

[1:15:06] when your heart condemns you not amen I
[1:15:11] I I I I've I've lived a holy life amen
[1:15:15] I've I've uh done the wrong to shun the
[1:15:19] right amen then I know that my heart
[1:15:23] does not condemn me
[1:15:25] I've repented I've made the mistakes
[1:15:28] things I've made them right they're
[1:15:30] under the blood no matter what anybody
[1:15:33] says no matter what the devil says it's
[1:15:35] under the blood it's gone it's over
[1:15:38] don't let the devil condemn you with
[1:15:40] that and if your heart doesn't condemn
[1:15:42] you that should be a Perpetual 247 for
[1:15:46] every one of us a non condemned heart
[1:15:49] then we can have confidence towards God
[1:15:53] faith in God
[1:15:55] and when that confidence is there when
[1:15:57] that faith is there then there's not one
[1:15:59] thing that can come to you that God want
[1:16:02] that you by faith believe speak that
[1:16:05] will happen amen it will the Greater
[1:16:08] Works will happen if your heart does not
[1:16:11] condemn you ask anything in his name and

[1:19:01] miraculous thing that bam and they're
[1:19:03] perfect no but every the healing was
[1:19:06] there and it continues on and see that's
[1:19:09] another thing that the devil uses to try
[1:19:11] to Rob our
[1:19:12] confidence we we so get in in in
[1:19:17] encompassed in dwelling on the Miracle
[1:19:20] the instantaneous the right now the uh
[1:19:24] the the the the immediate healing or
[1:19:27] change that that we don't realize see
[1:19:31] even in other people uh in in our lives
[1:19:35] some are we're all different there's
[1:19:38] there's an immediate change in all of
[1:19:40] our Lives when we get saved when we get
[1:19:42] born again there's immediate change but
[1:19:44] we're still growing friend we're just
[1:19:47] babies not even crawling yet right and
[1:19:50] people look and say will you call
[1:19:52] yourself Christian yeah but the give the
[1:19:55] person a chance let them grow let the
[1:19:59] Lord continue to work with them maybe
[1:20:01] they just continue to make mistakes or
[1:20:03] or do things just let the Lord speak to
[1:20:06] them let the ministry speak to them let
[1:20:08] the word go forth and and change and and
[1:20:11] as and as people continue to grow let
[1:20:13] them continue to grow amen when they
[1:20:15] grow into the Lord and we come up into
[1:20:17] the statue of a perfect man into the
[1:20:20] place that God uh can use that person
[1:20:24] more and more all the time uh we lose
[1:20:27] our faith in healing if it's not a
[1:20:29] miracle I think well it must not to
[1:20:32] happened yeah I felt the warmth on my
[1:20:34] knees friend but when I went to work the
[1:20:36] next week I was in pain I was in a lot
[1:20:39] of pain but I knew God had healed me yes

[1:20:53] have faith just believe right just have
[1:20:56] confidence
[1:20:58] amen it's like brother random said you
[1:21:01] can have faith he he even had people
[1:21:03] come up on the platform and he pray for
[1:21:05] them and they'd get healed and and and
[1:21:09] then they go off and something happened
[1:21:10] and they disbelieve right amen come back
[1:21:13] and say you know but it's back but I

[1:21:27] the lord the devil uses sometime to
[1:21:29] condemn us with yeah it doesn't happen
[1:21:31] instantaneously so we think oh well I
[1:21:34] guess it wasn't for me I guess God's not
[1:21:36] going to heal me I guess it this wasn't
[1:21:38] uh uh and and you lose faith in the word
[1:21:41] you lose faith in God you lose
[1:21:43] confidence in in in what his word says
[1:21:45] and then and and sure as the world then
[1:21:47] you're not going to get healed right it
[1:21:51] you're it's not going to happen yeah

[1:23:43] service if if someone went and bought
[1:23:46] you your favorite food at your favorite
[1:23:48] restaurant and paid the bill in full and
[1:23:50] it was a $1,000 meal and it was paid in
[1:23:53] full all you had to go do is was eat it
[1:23:55] would you stay at home and say I don't
[1:23:57] want
[1:23:59] that but you I I I I don't want to n I'm
[1:24:03] good without it it's your favorite thing
[1:24:06] it's your favorite place it's paid in
[1:24:09] full why would you not take advantage of
[1:24:11] that and again if the person who paid
[1:24:15] for it and you didn't take it I would be
[1:24:19] insulted I would be insulted if I

[1:24:44] all and we won't partake of it we won't
[1:24:48] engage in it and take what God's he
[1:24:52] wants us to
[1:24:54] the whole point he wants you to more
[1:24:57] than you want to yeah you think how
[1:25:00] badly I want to be healed or or whatever
[1:25:03] it is or my family to be saved or
[1:25:06] something they go how much God wants
[1:25:09] that
[1:25:10] amen more than you want it yeah that's

[1:25:19] my family is uh is the most important
[1:25:23] thing I know of right I I I I would if I
[1:25:27] on half this world I would give it for
[1:25:30] that if I on half this galaxy I would
[1:25:33] give it for that if I don't have this
[1:25:35] universe I would give it for that
[1:25:38] purpose for that reason right there's

[1:26:14] us get the people to believe and be
[1:26:17] sincere when you

[1:27:00] want to go to
[1:27:05] um well if I can find
[1:27:16] it identified Christ of all ages look
[1:27:20] what brother Bram said he said he knew
[1:27:24] knew before the world began remember he
[1:27:28] knows all things just read
[1:27:31] that he knew before the world began that
[1:27:35] we would sit here he knew how many times
[1:27:39] I'd raised my hands up and down he knew
[1:27:42] the words that I'd
[1:27:44] say he knew how many times you'd bat
[1:27:47] your eyes what you would think before
[1:27:50] the world ever
[1:27:51] started what you would think
[1:27:55] amen so nothing can can surprise him
[1:27:59] what you would think before the world
[1:28:01] ever
[1:28:02] started what are we afraid about God is
[1:28:06] our father that's right he's our father
[1:28:08] we have no
[1:28:10] worry people's just lost their faith and
[1:28:13] confidence in
[1:28:15] him oh my help us Lord you say well I've
[1:28:20] lost it myself where did that come from
[1:28:26] amen think about it look away to Jesus
[1:28:30] brother B's talking about um his wife
[1:28:33] here remember when she
[1:28:37] uh kitties have been crying and carrying
[1:28:40] on and she was frazzled and at her wits
[1:28:43] end and she slammed the door I won't go
[1:28:47] through all the store but she slammed
[1:28:48] the door in his face said you take care
[1:28:50] of
[1:28:52] then and he brother br's like oh poor
[1:28:55] thing she's had it rough and you know
[1:28:57] it's been hard and she has to be here so
[1:29:00] many times by herself and raising the
[1:29:02] kids God help her but the Lord spoke to
[1:29:04] brother brand and said she shouldn't
[1:29:05] have done that amen she displeased the
[1:29:09] Lord she displeased that angel amen and
[1:29:13] remember then that tumor came on her it
[1:29:15] was years later but then that tumor came
[1:29:17] on her and there was the brother B said
[1:29:19] Look Away to Jesus he said now let's bow
[1:29:21] our heads for a word of prayer Lord
[1:29:23] Jesus I have seen it I have seen it upon
[1:29:26] other people but when it come to my own
[1:29:29] precious wife it was in my home then
[1:29:32] Lord I looked at it with my own eyes
[1:29:34] felt it with my own hands 16 it was 16
[1:29:38] years 16 years before
[1:29:40] that uh it was also Lord known and
[1:29:43] revealed by you because the Lord told me
[1:29:47] amen he didn't tell brother B exactly
[1:29:49] what was going to happen or what it was
[1:29:50] going to be but he told her that he told
[1:29:53] Brother God told him it was going to
[1:29:55] happen when anything is spoken it must
[1:29:59] be done you were showing me Lord then
[1:30:02] that my confidence in what you had done
[1:30:04] for the people and would let me know so
[1:30:07] I could help
[1:30:09] them amen think about that that I could
[1:30:13] help them what was in his own house the
[1:30:17] lesson now it wasn't just because of
[1:30:20] what she had done that was part of it it
[1:30:22] displeased the Lord
[1:30:24] but what God was working on and working
[1:30:27] was to bring it to a place maybe if I
[1:30:31] could say can't put myself in his
[1:30:33] position but enhancement of that
[1:30:36] sincerity be sincere when you pray you
[1:30:39] can't I can't even begin to imagine what
[1:30:41] it was like to be in places and being
[1:30:43] mocked at and laughed at made fun of and
[1:30:46] and and all that brother Bram had to
[1:30:48] endure and the carnal impersonations and
[1:30:50] stuff and uh the difficulty
[1:30:54] uh in his stature and who he was and the
[1:30:57] life he lived God was always bringing
[1:30:59] things to and adversity like this tumor
[1:31:03] in his wife to bring it to the place
[1:31:06] that came in his own home like he said
[1:31:09] but to bring him to a place of of prayer
[1:31:13] and
[1:31:14] sincerity so that he could do that to
[1:31:17] help the
[1:31:18] people my that that's when you talk
[1:31:21] about living your life for others saints
[1:31:23] that
[1:31:24] yes amen of course then the Lord Brother
[1:31:26] BR was down praying for it right before
[1:31:29] she was about to have surgery and and
[1:31:31] the Lord says stand on your feet you
[1:31:34] speak what is going to happen and what
[1:31:36] you say will happen brother B said
[1:31:38] before the doctor's hand can touch it
[1:31:39] it'll be gone amen amen she laid there
[1:31:43] the doctor pulled back the sheet as he
[1:31:45] went to put his hand on that grapefruit
[1:31:47] thing gone yes
[1:31:50] ameno praise the Lord yes that that's
[1:31:54] the truth sinten praise God look let's
[1:31:56] go to this scripture I I've got a couple
[1:31:59] more but I just want to I want to go to
[1:32:01] this specifically it's in 1 Samuel we
[1:32:04] all know the
[1:32:09] story
[1:32:14] amen thank you Jesus stand on your feet
[1:32:18] and speak it
[1:32:21] yes amen we do a lot of pray and Saints
[1:32:24] but sometimes it comes time to stand on
[1:32:26] your feet speak it
[1:32:30] amen yes 1
[1:32:35] Samuel chapter
[1:32:37] 17 verse
[1:32:40] 31 1st Samuel 17:31 and when the words
[1:32:43] were heard which David spake they
[1:32:46] rehearsed them before Saul and he sent
[1:32:49] for him of course this is Goliath and
[1:32:51] Goliath cursing God Amen
[1:32:54] David said how can the head of that that
[1:32:57] uncircumcised Philistine still be on him
[1:32:59] anyway David said to Saul let no man's
[1:33:02] heart fail because of him thy servant
[1:33:04] will go and fight with this Philistine
[1:33:07] and Saul said to David Thou Art not able
[1:33:09] to go against this Philistine to fight
[1:33:11] with him for thou art but a youth and he
[1:33:14] a man of war from his youth doesn't
[1:33:17] matter because little as much as God is
[1:33:20] in right yes God could have used a
[1:33:22] mosquito
[1:33:24] to cut the head off of Goliath if he
[1:33:26] wanted to yes he could have used the
[1:33:28] amoeba off a NP to cut the head off
[1:33:32] Goliath if he wanted to amen amen right
[1:33:36] doesn't matter this little man David
[1:33:38] said unto Saul thy servant kept his
[1:33:40] father's sheep and there came a lion and
[1:33:43] a bear and took a lamb out of the flock
[1:33:46] and I went out after him and smote him
[1:33:48] and delivered it out of his mouth and
[1:33:50] when he rose against me I caught him by
[1:33:54] his beard and smote him and slew him
[1:33:57] praise God IM how many people amen when
[1:34:01] that line came after me I grabbed him by
[1:34:03] the beard and I just killed
[1:34:07] him that is unheard of friend yes I just
[1:34:10] grabbed him by the beard and just killed
[1:34:12] him a
[1:34:14] lion and a
[1:34:16] bear the thy servant thy servant slew
[1:34:20] both The Lion and the bear and this
[1:34:22] uncircumcised philis shall be as one of
[1:34:24] them seeing how he had defied the armies
[1:34:27] of the Living God God had worked on
[1:34:30] David in perilous
[1:34:33] situations to have a lion come and a
[1:34:36] bear come to take his possession away to
[1:34:41] take the thing that he was responsible
[1:34:43] for away from him to take his livelihood
[1:34:48] to take that that he was responsible for
[1:34:50] away from him and he said when that lion
[1:34:54] came I went and I chased down that lion
[1:34:57] and I took that lamb right out of his
[1:34:59] mouth and I grabbed him by the beer and
[1:35:01] I beard and I killed
[1:35:03] him praise the Lord God working on David
[1:35:08] God showing David I am with you when the
[1:35:12] bear came did the same thing he took
[1:35:15] that bear and he took his his lamb back
[1:35:18] out of his mouth and he killed
[1:35:20] him he said now this un circumcised
[1:35:24] Philistine will be as one of them what
[1:35:26] was God doing with David he was helping
[1:35:29] David's confidence he was helping
[1:35:31] David's Faith to realize I'm with you
[1:35:35] amen there's nothing that I won't do for
[1:35:38] you whatever you ask in my name I will
[1:35:41] give it to you praise the Lord think
[1:35:45] about it Saints whatever you ask I will
[1:35:48] give it to you yes he said as this lion
[1:35:51] was and as this bear was so will that in
[1:35:54] circumcised Philistine be amen he will
[1:35:58] fall before me this
[1:36:00] day praise God Saul tried to give him
[1:36:04] his armor and it wouldn't even fit him
[1:36:06] amen right oh praise the Lord all that
[1:36:09] ecclesiastical stuff doesn't fit but
[1:36:11] Faith does Amen confidence does Amen so
[1:36:15] when he come to the real Showdown with
[1:36:17] him in Goliath he could take that
[1:36:19] Giant's head off because God had already
[1:36:22] been with him could you imagine what
[1:36:24] brother R all the confidence things like
[1:36:27] the the tumor that that God did with
[1:36:30] brother Rand think about those things
[1:36:31] that he does with us how many times has
[1:36:35] God proved over and over and over and
[1:36:38] over in your life even in adverse
[1:36:41] situations God takes those things to
[1:36:44] make them work out for your good amen
[1:36:46] how many times is that help us to
[1:36:49] recognize that God is with us amen that
[1:36:52] we have faith that God is going to do
[1:36:54] for us it isn't God did it then is he
[1:36:58] going to do it now no it's God did it
[1:37:00] then he will do it now right amen it's
[1:37:05] not is he going to it is he had already
[1:37:08] done oh praise God have faith to
[1:37:12] believe brother brandom stood before
[1:37:15] Millions tens of thousands at a time
[1:37:20] sometimes and could call out people's
[1:37:22] names and tell tell them what was wrong
[1:37:24] with him people could come up in front
[1:37:26] of them one at a time and say you you
[1:37:28] are so and so your name is such and such
[1:37:31] you live at a such and such address you
[1:37:33] have the such and such disease and this
[1:37:35] is what's wrong you this and all those
[1:37:37] things to the very in degree to where
[1:37:40] this day regardless of how many
[1:37:42] reprobates have left this message
[1:37:44] there's not one of them could say or
[1:37:46] prove that there was one thing that
[1:37:48] brother random taught that was wrong not
[1:37:52] one every every single time it was right
[1:37:55] there yes why because brother because
[1:37:58] God sent him
[1:38:00] hunting God put in that man's heart for
[1:38:03] the Wilderness and he would go hunting
[1:38:06] and God says you're going to get a
[1:38:07] caribou today and his horns are going to
[1:38:09] be 42 Ines now that's very specific
[1:38:13] friends yeah that is a very specific
[1:38:15] number to say it's going that's pretty
[1:38:17] big too actually that's almost 4 foot
[1:38:20] going to be 42 inch horns he goes on the
[1:38:24] trip sure enough God gives him this
[1:38:27] Caribou I remember I think it was the
[1:38:29] testimony of maybe brother bis or
[1:38:32] someone and and they had that caribou
[1:38:36] and they took out the tape
[1:38:38] measure and that brother as they pulled
[1:38:40] that tape measure across that horn that
[1:38:42] brother said tape measure if you say
[1:38:44] anything other than 42 Ines you are a
[1:38:49] liar
[1:38:51] amen tap measure
[1:38:54] let me tell you tape measure if you
[1:38:56] don't say 42 you are wrong am the tape
[1:39:00] measure is wrong remember the brother's
[1:39:01] testimony pulled it right out 42 Ines
[1:39:05] exactly because that's what God told him
[1:39:08] right God building his confidence God
[1:39:11] increasing that confidence to realize
[1:39:13] the same God that said that that gave it
[1:39:16] to him that proved it in front of all
[1:39:19] those Brothers is the same God that was
[1:39:20] with him behind that pull pit when he
[1:39:22] called James or Susie Lou or or John do
[1:39:26] whoever it was and told them what their
[1:39:28] address was told him walking down the
[1:39:30] street skipping down the street seen you
[1:39:32] in front of the doctor you've got this
[1:39:34] thing this x-ray whatever it was he
[1:39:36] could do that because he knew that the
[1:39:38] same God that was here is the same God
[1:39:40] was going to be there right what is it
[1:39:42] for us now the same God has done it
[1:39:44] before if he's always done it he will
[1:39:47] always do it yeah amen he's not changed
[1:39:50] only thing that changes is US yeah right
[1:39:53] the only thing that happens sometimes is
[1:39:54] we lose our confidence we lose our faith
[1:39:58] it gets dulled or diminished
[1:40:02] somehow our heart begins to condemn us
[1:40:04] that's the
[1:40:06] devil call it what it is it's the
[1:40:09] devil
[1:40:12] amen I've seen that
[1:40:14] Caribou it's in the it it it's in the
[1:40:17] study up here right off First Avenue
[1:40:20] I've seen it been there touched it and
[1:40:23] Steve Smith who is what I've been told
[1:40:26] far more advanced hunter than brother
[1:40:28] Bram ever was of course he's consecrated
[1:40:31] his life to that brother bram's life was
[1:40:33] the ministry not hunting he was a he was
[1:40:36] a part-time casual Hunter brother
[1:40:38] brandham was his life was the ministry
[1:40:40] Steve Smith's life is hunting right he
[1:40:43] said when that when when that happens
[1:40:46] and those paddle horns the way they are
[1:40:48] once the animal dies because of the
[1:40:50] blood flow through it they start to
[1:40:52] shrink right the horn shrink you go up
[1:40:56] to that you go up there today Horn's
[1:40:57] still 42
[1:40:59] inches still 42 and it's not going to
[1:41:02] ever change because that was the promise
[1:41:05] of God now would it have been acceptable
[1:41:07] and understandable that the horns would
[1:41:09] have shrank as they normally do of
[1:41:11] course it would but God wasn't going to
[1:41:13] let that happen right amen because that
[1:41:16] was a promise of his he out same trip
[1:41:19] told him about the Silver Tip Grizzly
[1:41:21] you get this Silver Tip Grizzly yeah
[1:41:23] they're hiking and walking and they get
[1:41:25] within like a half of well two miles in
[1:41:27] the camp Brothers with him brother

[1:41:29] him here pretty soon last day last we
[1:41:32] only got a couple more miles to go we're

[1:41:37] trees there's no anything where is this
[1:41:40] bear going to come from I don't know God
[1:41:42] said it they keep walking they get them
[1:41:45] off of the camp brother Brandon that
[1:41:47] bear better get here pretty soon we're
[1:41:48] almost to the camp he's coming don't
[1:41:51] worry about it he's coming you got to
[1:41:53] believe but the brothers around him like
[1:41:55] you know where is he going to come from
[1:41:57] then there's no trees there's no place
[1:42:00] you ever been you ever been to a place
[1:42:02] there's just no hiding place you go to
[1:42:04] the place or out in the desert or
[1:42:05] something there just no place nowhere
[1:42:07] for it to hide where's this big silver
[1:42:09] CHP ver going to come from right I don't
[1:42:12] know but the same God that gave a
[1:42:15] sacrifice to Abraham is the same God
[1:42:18] that's going to give me the promise that
[1:42:20] he told me right amen how half a mile
[1:42:24] from the camp brother random I can see
[1:42:26] the Camp it's about a half a mile away I
[1:42:29] can see it where is this bear coming
[1:42:31] from he said pretty soon that bear come
[1:42:33] out of
[1:42:34] nowhere and he took a gun I forgot what
[1:42:38] it was a low caliber gun and the guy
[1:42:41] said shoot it shoot him in the heart
[1:42:42] shoot him in the heart or something like
[1:42:44] that he said no said the Lord told me
[1:42:46] shoot him in the back don't shoot him in
[1:42:48] the back he'll still come and get us cuz
[1:42:50] he was right
[1:42:51] there and
[1:42:53] the the bear was right in front of him
[1:42:55] brother brandom shoots and the bear goes
[1:42:56] down the brother said brother brandom I
[1:42:58] believed you he said but I knew the bear
[1:43:00] was going to come but I didn't want him
[1:43:02] in my lap the bear fell right there amen
[1:43:06] from something that
[1:43:07] was not even supposed to happen not
[1:43:10] supposed to be there in a in in with a
[1:43:13] gun that wasn't supposed to even come
[1:43:14] close to killing that big Grizzly and
[1:43:17] and shooting in a place that wasn't
[1:43:19] supposed to kill him right and every bit
[1:43:23] of it God did exactly like he said he
[1:43:26] would do yes amen you know I've seen the
[1:43:29] skin of that Silver Tip originally too
[1:43:32] right amen it's in Jeffersonville or
[1:43:35] last time I knew it
[1:43:36] was amen because that was God's promised
[1:43:40] him now you can say when if that God can
[1:43:43] do that then what can he do just getting
[1:43:46] up in front of people getting up in
[1:43:47] front of and realize the same God that
[1:43:50] told me that's the same God that's
[1:43:51] telling me that your name is Susie
[1:43:54] the same God that gave me that bear is
[1:43:55] the same God that's telling me you have
[1:43:57] tuberculosis right the same God that
[1:43:59] told me that is the same God is telling
[1:44:01] me all
[1:44:02] these it helped give him confidence but
[1:44:06] now what does it do for
[1:44:08] us amen that that's that's great but and
[1:44:13] I believe all that and it does help
[1:44:15] encourage me but there's got to be
[1:44:17] something in my life it has to be
[1:44:20] something for us that we have personally
[1:44:24] that we grasp a hold of that God has
[1:44:26] done for us multiple things I would
[1:44:29] assume that God has done for us that
[1:44:32] same God doesn't change because another
[1:44:35] circumstance arises he's still the same
[1:44:38] am different circumstance but the same
[1:44:41] God he wasn't going to kill the caribou
[1:44:44] and not the bear because the bear is not
[1:44:45] a
[1:44:47] caribou he did both think about the
[1:44:50] squirrels he's sitting there and there's
[1:44:53] nothing around no squirrels he goes and
[1:44:55] setting the fork with astri and he and
[1:44:57] the spear speaks what are you doing here
[1:44:59] I'm hunting what you hunting for
[1:45:01] squirrel how many do you
[1:45:04] need three I think he said he wanted
[1:45:06] five a three will make a good a stew I
[1:45:09] need three to feed my family he said
[1:45:12] speaking amen
[1:45:14] speaking he said okay I I want to
[1:45:17] squirrel I'm paraphrasing of course
[1:45:18] shorten than the story I want one there
[1:45:20] shoot him right in the right in the
[1:45:22] right eye
[1:45:23] every shot 22 Rifle right in the right I
[1:45:25] believe it was the right eye shot him
[1:45:27] killed him next one com he said okay I
[1:45:29] want one right there shot him right out
[1:45:32] killed him bam 22 rifle same thing
[1:45:35] brother Bram said I thought myself I'm
[1:45:37] just G
[1:45:38] to I'm going to make this one difficult
[1:45:41] and he said I want that squirrel to come
[1:45:43] over here run over there and go over
[1:45:45] this and jump over that tree under that
[1:45:46] stump wherever ever it was and go over
[1:45:49] here and climb up in a tree that
[1:45:50] squirrels don't go in there's you know
[1:45:53] there trees out there squirrels won't
[1:45:54] typically go in they prefer Hardwoods uh
[1:45:58] they said I want to go up to that tree a
[1:46:00] Tre that a squirrel never would run and
[1:46:01] jump in especially with all the other
[1:46:03] trees around he would not go in that
[1:46:05] tree I want him to go in that tree and
[1:46:07] sit down that Limb and look at me pretty
[1:46:09] soon there comes this girl you say well
[1:46:12] that was just brother bandam story but I
[1:46:14] believe that story why do I believe it
[1:46:16] because the confidence I have with all
[1:46:18] the other things that we know are
[1:46:20] approvable things amen just as if though
[1:46:24] I was sitting there watching that
[1:46:25] squirrel come across the woods of course
[1:46:27] I was a squirrel Hunter too so I've seen
[1:46:29] squirrels do that myself I've seen
[1:46:31] squirrels come and jump on a on a on a
[1:46:33] on a tree about that big around right in
[1:46:35] front of me and look around at
[1:46:38] me amen I I I so I know what he saw I
[1:46:41] can picture my head and come and go
[1:46:43] right up in that tree right up on that
[1:46:44] exact Li turn around and look at brother
[1:46:46] BR boom right eye shot it Billy Paul
[1:46:50] says I ate the spoken word yeah because
[1:46:53] he took those squirrels home scanned
[1:46:54] them and made a stew out of them and the
[1:46:56] family ate it praise the Lord spoken
[1:47:00] World squirrel spoken word squirrels I
[1:47:02] ate them amen I believe that you think
[1:47:06] about the things that you think those
[1:47:08] are those are uh amazing what God has
[1:47:11] done but think about the things that God
[1:47:12] so many times so much of these things
[1:47:14] get suppressed what has God done for you
[1:47:17] what is the things that God has done in
[1:47:18] your life Miracles or healings or uh uh
[1:47:23] Supernatural things that God has done
[1:47:26] for you and look back I think if you sat
[1:47:29] down and thought of it long enough and
[1:47:31] ask the Lord to help you write a book I
[1:47:33] bet we all probably could come close to
[1:47:34] writing a book right of the things that
[1:47:36] the Lord has done just write those
[1:47:38] things out amen for us I could say for
[1:47:40] me and my wife our children Our Lives
[1:47:42] serving for God the things that he's
[1:47:44] done can write them all out in a book
[1:47:46] right
[1:47:48] amen that's just God though that's God
[1:47:51] doing it yes having the confidence the
[1:47:54] faith to believe
[1:47:56] it I had several more scriptures couple
[1:47:59] more quotes but I'm just going to read
[1:48:01] this one more scripture time's gotten
[1:48:02] away so one more scripture we're going
[1:48:04] to close it's in
[1:48:06] Hebrews chapter 3 I want to read this
[1:48:08] one more scripture read uh Hebrews
[1:48:11] chapter
[1:48:17] 3
[1:48:20] amen praise the Lord you know we got to
[1:48:22] have confidence to one another too yes
[1:48:25] amen like I said hard to help one
[1:48:28] another unless we have
[1:48:29] confidence amen we got to have
[1:48:31] confidence faith in one another Brothers
[1:48:33] and Sisters in
[1:48:35] Christ amen now there's probably no
[1:48:38] there's there's no person on the planet
[1:48:41] Earth that knows my wife's mistakes more
[1:48:43] than I do nobody and there never will
[1:48:47] be but I still love her and I still have
[1:48:50] full 100% of utmost confidence in her
[1:48:54] even with all those things that I know
[1:48:58] amen I hope to believe she's same way
[1:49:01] but I know I can say that
[1:49:04] 100% I mean
[1:49:06] lately well that's a whole another
[1:49:09] subject but God is just when he's ever
[1:49:12] present he changes the situations and
[1:49:14] yeah
[1:49:16] um it's just phenomenal to me uh just to
[1:49:21] look back but
[1:49:23] but don't you know God's the same way
[1:49:26] when he looks when he looks at us right
[1:49:29] he he knows all
[1:49:32] things there's nothing you can surprise
[1:49:34] him with there's nothing you can do that
[1:49:37] he doesn't already know you're going to
[1:49:40] do so but he still has confidence in US
[1:49:44] amen and sometimes we look around him we
[1:49:47] look at the devil wants to make sure
[1:49:50] that we try to look at one another's
[1:49:52] faults mistakes and little things and
[1:49:55] and and lose because he wants us to lose
[1:49:57] confidence in one another that's right
[1:49:59] because if we lose confidence one
[1:50:01] another we're not we're not as close a
[1:50:03] group as we should be and I'm not
[1:50:04] talking about just our church I just I
[1:50:06] mean Believers yes period
[1:50:10] worldwide we lose confidence in one
[1:50:12] another just off of little things you
[1:50:16] know silly little things that happen
[1:50:19] sometimes that just sometimes that uh is
[1:50:22] offputting to some people they like well
[1:50:24] you know I don't have confidence in that
[1:50:26] person you know because he Parts his
[1:50:29] hair on the right instead of on the left
[1:50:31] uh you know it's like as a married cou
[1:50:33] you get divorced because one likes the
[1:50:35] toilet paper coming this way and one
[1:50:36] likes it coming under that way uh to me
[1:50:39] that's just silliness that's like a
[1:50:40] church breaking up because one wants to
[1:50:43] take communion with the little cups and
[1:50:44] the other group wants to take the big
[1:50:46] one cup so the whole church just splits
[1:50:49] and that's the truth that's a real story
[1:50:52] split
[1:50:53] I know I preached for that group of
[1:50:55] people I know they split completely tore
[1:50:58] the church apart cuz one one group
[1:51:00] wanted it in little cups the other group
[1:51:01] want it in one big cup Church doesn't
[1:51:03] exist
[1:51:05] today amen lost confidence over
[1:51:09] what brother and
[1:51:13] sister it it comes down to that
[1:51:16] sometimes we got to recognize that's
[1:51:18] just the devil right that's just the
[1:51:21] enemy trying to divide us
[1:51:23] trying to put a wedge there trying to
[1:51:25] cause us to lose confidence in one
[1:51:27] another amen don't let him do it don't
[1:51:30] let him do it whatever you do don't let
[1:51:31] him do it Hebrews chapter
[1:51:34] 3:2 couple of verses and we'll close
[1:51:38] Hebrews 3:12 take heed Brethren lest
[1:51:42] there be in any of you an evil heart of
[1:51:45] unbelief in departing from the Living
[1:51:49] God but exhort one another daily while
[1:51:53] it is called today lest any of you be
[1:51:56] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:51:59] sin or unbelief amen now it's not
[1:52:03] talking about a little mistake or a
[1:52:04] little fault or a little slip
[1:52:07] unbelief that's why the previous verse
[1:52:09] says departing from the Living God
[1:52:12] losing
[1:52:14] confidence
[1:52:16] Faith exort one another wise today lest
[1:52:19] any of you be hardened through the
[1:52:20] deceitfulness of sin for for we are made
[1:52:23] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[1:52:27] beginning of our confidence
[1:52:30] steadfast steadfast hold our confidence
[1:52:34] steadfast Until the End praise the Lord
[1:52:39] while it is said today if you will hear
[1:52:42] his voice Harden not your hearts as in
[1:52:46] the day of provocation when they provoke
[1:52:47] the
[1:52:48] Lord we stay solid steadfast
[1:52:54] true
[1:52:55] solid together amen
[1:52:59] unwavering
[1:53:00] believing and the confidence we have in
[1:53:03] God confidence we have in one
[1:53:05] another if we believe that we are of God
[1:53:09] then we should have the same confidence
[1:53:11] in one another as we have in God yes
[1:53:14] amen and I'll be honest with you you as
[1:53:17] a group of people and many of the
[1:53:19] Believers that I've known down through
[1:53:21] the years my wife my family I have more
[1:53:23] confidence than you and I do
[1:53:25] myself cuz again there is nobody on this
[1:53:29] planet Earth that knows Newton V
[1:53:31] failures more than he does
[1:53:34] oh amen I know my shortcomings more than
[1:53:38] anybody does so I have more confidence
[1:53:41] in you because we tend to try to look as
[1:53:45] human nature guess at the negative more
[1:53:47] than the positive and the shortcomings
[1:53:49] rather than the good amen the the
[1:53:52] failure rather than the
[1:53:53] accomplishments but I bet if we took
[1:53:56] record if we took score our
[1:53:59] accomplishments would outweigh our
[1:54:00] failures by
[1:54:02] billions of percentage anyway they would
[1:54:06] be astronomically outnumbered because
[1:54:09] God works through his
[1:54:11] children God's doing it through US amen
[1:54:16] amen so don't dwell on the mistakes the
[1:54:19] slip ups but dwell on that that that is
[1:54:23] the positive the up building the lifting
[1:54:27] not not not the condemnation amen but
[1:54:31] that that edifies and builds and lifts
[1:54:34] up and strengthens that's what brings us
[1:54:37] to the place that we our relationship
[1:54:40] with Christ amen it's being with the
[1:54:43] people being with the things thinking on
[1:54:45] the things it's anything good righteous
[1:54:47] holy think on those things amen let that
[1:54:51] confidence continue to
[1:54:53] exude through you so that we never lose
[1:54:55] that faith in God and let that Faith
[1:54:58] operate by that love that we have
[1:55:00] towards one another and towards God Amen
[1:55:03] let's stand if we
[1:55:14] could when we
[1:55:16] do the devil has won at least that
[1:55:20] battle he's not going to win the war
[1:55:23] but he may have at least won that
[1:55:25] battle amen but when we have faith
[1:55:28] towards one another and towards God and
[1:55:31] towards one another then God brings
[1:55:34] whatever you say we have confidence
[1:55:37] whatever you say God will make it happen

[2:06:09] message that we brought on finances in
[2:06:12] the church
[2:06:13] private you won't find it if you just go
[2:06:16] search on YouTube he's made it private
[2:06:18] only for members of our congregation
[2:06:21] here only for us that come and call me
[2:06:24] Pastor it's only for I guess to find on
[2:06:26] the website I guess um
[2:06:30] yeah if anybody wanted to see it yeah if
[2:06:33] you have a log on for the website you
[2:06:36] I'll put it in the the section to where

[2:06:46] a link to where it'll still come up on
[2:06:49] YouTube but it's not searchable or find
[2:06:51] on our page or through
[2:06:54] searching I didn't want it available to
[2:06:56] just anybody to watch it's not for just
[2:06:58] anybody so uh it is for our congregation
[2:07:02] so and felt like it was more of a
[2:07:04] personal enough thing to that's just for
[2:07:08] us and I felt it was that way so um if
[2:07:11] you did for some reason wanted to go
[2:07:13] back and review through it
