[28:57] tucson morning
[28:59] amen but god blessed us with a good
[29:01] beautiful sunlight and
[29:03] a beautiful day he meant it was nice to
[29:05] wake up yesterday to see the
[29:07] snow on the mountains and it's just
[29:09] amazing the extremes that you get in
[29:11] arizona
[29:12] tucson anyway southern arizona uh
[29:15] last week we got we had the air
[29:17] conditioner on a couple nights because
[29:18] we like to sleep with it cool
[29:20] and and now we gotta have the heat on
[29:23] it's
[29:24] we didn't turn it on but um uh it's just
[29:28] a roller coaster here in tucson but
[29:30] um but anyway appreciate you coming here
[29:33] and being here in this
[29:34] conference room this morning pray the
[29:36] lord richly bless you today
[29:37] a little bit cramped we have a little
[29:39] smaller area today but
[29:41] um we got here a little early and micah
[29:44] was here and
[29:46] uh the lady said it'd be ready in a few
[29:48] minutes and so we
[29:49] came in and we're standing out in the
[29:51] lobby area and she's in here putting the
[29:53] chairs up and didn't know it but she was
[29:55] putting them all up like this
[29:57] and you know we come in we we didn't get
[29:59] in here until
[30:00] 10 after 10 quarter after 10 something
[30:02] like that so we didn't have a whole lot
[30:03] of time so
[30:04] so we'll just leave it like it is but
[30:06] right now i
[30:08] i'm thankful to have church and thankful
[30:09] to have a place to meet and i appreciate
[30:11] god's blessings to us
[30:13] but i definitely like the cheers turned
[30:15] around the other way better
[30:16] uh it seems to have a little more room
[30:19] and i'm not staring at myself so
[30:23] i would get danny and dennis to take
[30:25] that mirror down but
[30:27] uh we better just leave it and break it
[30:29] then we'll have to pay for it so
[30:31] we'll just have to endure i'll look at
[30:33] you all instead of
[30:34] instead about there so uh
[30:38] that's uh i i i have to say in
[30:42] 33 years in august i've been ministering
[30:45] i've never preached to myself
[30:46] like that in a year before but there's
[30:49] always
[30:50] a first i guess amen but uh thankful to
[30:52] be here today
[30:54] god bless you let's stand to our feet if
[30:55] we could we're going to
[30:57] turn our bibles to numbers chapter 12.
[31:12] numbers chapter 12.
[31:27] i'll give you an update at the end of
[31:28] the service today
[31:30] short update i try not to be too long
[31:32] we'll probably have to divide this
[31:33] service
[31:34] this message into a couple of messages
[31:38] uh because i like to take you know 10-15
[31:40] minutes at the end of service to try to
[31:43] uh poor sing and work a little and then
[31:45] update you a little about
[31:46] progress or lack thereof i should say of
[31:49] the other place at this point so
[31:51] um but
[31:54] anyway so we'll do that at the end of
[31:56] the service today so numbers chapter 12.
[31:58] before we read the word let's just bow
[32:00] our heads again for another word of
[32:01] prayer
[32:02] precious father god lord jesus it's
[32:05] certainly a privilege to be here and
[32:06] thank you so much for all that you've
[32:08] done for us and blessed us through this
[32:10] week
[32:10] glad there's many prayer requests that

[32:38] word lord that we might draw
[32:40] closer to you more like you in this last
[32:42] day
[32:43] lord it's a place that we're accustomed
[32:45] to but lord we don't know but this might
[32:47] be the last time we ever meet like this
[32:49] god we just don't want to take it for
[32:51] granted
[32:52] lord but we want to make it the best
[32:54] opportunity that we have
[32:56] lord to just expect from you all that
[32:58] you have for us today
[33:00] and lord may you just uh open your word
[33:03] lord to us and open our hearts to
[33:05] receive it

[33:10] revelation of the word that you'd have
[33:12] to encourage us with today father

[33:16] iniquities move upon your bride
[33:18] internationally lord wherever they be
[33:20] god we know them

[33:25] of jesus christ
[33:27] we thank you for keeping us safe and
[33:28] healthy lord may you watch over and
[33:31] bless us
[33:31] as we rebuke every demonic spirit lord
[33:33] this place today
[33:35] that may try to hurt hinder and this
[33:37] service in any way
[33:39] that you would get the glory honor and
[33:40] praise for all that is said and done
[33:43] we give you thanks honor and glory and
[33:45] committed to you now in the name of the
[33:46] lord jesus christ we pray
[33:48] amen amen numbers chapter 12 we'll just
[33:52] read a couple verses of scripture
[33:54] and let you be seated uh starting with
[33:56] verse 13
[33:57] numbers 12-13
[34:00] and moses cried unto the lord saying
[34:02] hear her now oh god i beseech thee and
[34:06] the lord said unto moses if her father
[34:08] would spit in her face
[34:09] should she not be ashamed seven days let
[34:12] her be shut out from the camp
[34:14] seven days and after that let her be
[34:17] received in again miriam was shut out
[34:20] from the camp seven days in the people's
[34:22] journey
[34:23] uh journeyed not until miriam was
[34:25] brought in again
[34:26] and you can be seated if you'd like
[34:30] as i said this this
[34:34] just because i probably could put this
[34:36] into a service under regular
[34:37] circumstances but
[34:39] under the circumstance certain current
[34:41] circumstances in about 40 45 minutes uh
[34:44] we'll probably just try to cut this in
[34:46] uh in two pieces and just
[34:48] do the best we can with today and see
[34:50] where the lord leads it for next week so
[34:52] uh but i want to go back to the first
[34:54] verse in numbers chapter 12
[34:57] and read this story through and uh get
[35:00] an unusual thought from this
[35:02] uh i tell you what let's let's read
[35:03] another scripture first
[35:05] i was gonna read this afterwards but
[35:07] let's go ahead over to turn and turn
[35:09] over to first john
[35:10] first john chapter one
[35:13] i wanna read it for a few verses of
[35:15] scripture in first john chapter one
[35:19] you could hold your place there in
[35:21] numbers twelve because we're gonna go
[35:22] back to that
[35:24] but let's look at first john uh chapter
[35:26] one let's begin
[35:28] um let's begin reading with verse five
[35:32] first john chapter one all of john is
[35:34] wonderful you've never read the
[35:36] read the epistles of john the first
[35:38] second third epistles they're just
[35:40] they're they're just wonderful uh
[35:42] they're they're packed full of love
[35:44] too amen this is john's the one that
[35:47] informs us that god is love
[35:48] amen amen um he informs us that there's
[35:53] no darkness in him he is light which
[35:56] we're going to read here just a second
[35:57] first john
[35:58] chapter one now not saint john first
[36:01] john
[36:01] chapter one verse five this then
[36:05] is the message which we have heard of
[36:06] him and declare unto you that god
[36:09] is light and in him is no darkness at
[36:11] all
[36:12] if we say that we have fellowship with
[36:14] him and walk in darkness we lie
[36:17] and do not the truth but if we walk in
[36:19] the light as he
[36:20] is in the light we have fellowship one
[36:23] with another
[36:24] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[36:27] cleanseth us
[36:28] from all sin if we say that we have no
[36:31] sin
[36:32] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[36:34] not in us
[36:35] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[36:38] and just to forgive
[36:39] our forgive us our sins and to cleanse
[36:42] us
[36:43] from all unrighteousness if we say that
[36:46] we have not sinned we make him a liar
[36:48] and his word is not in us
[36:50] now that proclamation of course many of
[36:53] you probably know if you
[36:54] were under brother green's ministry very
[36:56] long he called that uh
[36:58] 911 first john 1 9
[37:01] uh backwards 9-1-1 if you need emergency
[37:04] call 9-1-1 i like that so much when
[37:06] brother green was ministering that he
[37:08] went through that quite a bit
[37:09] that i felt compelled to put it in my
[37:11] book so actually
[37:13] that that little excerpt there is in my
[37:15] book
[37:16] first john 1 9 or backwards 9-1-1
[37:19] if you need rescue he said if you
[37:21] confess your sins
[37:22] he is just and faithful to forgive you
[37:24] of your sin and to cleanse you from all
[37:27] unrighteousness now if we go back to
[37:29] miriam and we look at the story of
[37:31] miriam and
[37:32] uh or this part of the story in in
[37:34] chapter 12
[37:35] miriam spoke against god's prophet her
[37:38] brother
[37:39] moses and when she spoke against him god
[37:42] struck her with leprosy we'll read
[37:43] through the story here
[37:45] uh god struck her with leprosy now
[37:47] leprosy we know in the bible
[37:49] represents sin sin is judged as leprosy
[37:53] as someone that's uh that that is a
[37:56] figurative of
[37:57] of what leprosy is it speaks of sin
[38:01] uh and and in it being sin
[38:04] it helps us understand that of course
[38:07] leprosy at the time
[38:08] was incurable by human means just like
[38:11] sin is incurable by human means
[38:15] leprosy a type of sin was incurable by
[38:19] human means
[38:20] so there was no way that a person could
[38:23] eradicate themselves or annihilate the
[38:25] uh leprosy once they got it they had to
[38:27] go through the whole process
[38:29] of course we talked about last week the
[38:32] garment and the garment of leprosy
[38:34] uh if you read through leviticus i
[38:36] believe it's 12 13 14 or 13 14 15 it
[38:39] goes through the whole scenario
[38:41] of leprosy and what to do when you have
[38:43] it or when it's found and
[38:45] and those things that take place and how
[38:47] a person can be
[38:48] cleansed of that well when when when
[38:51] miriam uh uh spoke against moses spoke
[38:55] against
[38:55] god's prophet regardless of what moses
[38:58] did uh
[38:59] you can go and look at abraham and
[39:01] abraham was god's prophet
[39:03] and god's prophet lied to a king and
[39:06] this king
[39:07] did something based on misinformation
[39:10] based on a lie
[39:11] well the lie was given to him by god's
[39:13] prophet
[39:14] and what abimelech did was based on the
[39:18] lie
[39:18] that abraham had told him which
[39:21] unfortunately a lot of times a lot of
[39:23] people too things
[39:24] based on misinformation based on a lie
[39:28] and abraham lied to abimelech so if
[39:30] bimbalek took sarah to be his wife and
[39:32] god came to abimelech in a dream and
[39:34] said
[39:34] you better restore that man's wife back
[39:36] to him or you and your whole household
[39:39] is dead
[39:40] right and the member like said didn't
[39:41] did not honor in the integrity of my
[39:43] heart i
[39:44] i i took share to myself he said that
[39:46] she was his sister
[39:48] she said that he told me that that was
[39:50] her sister she said she was his sister
[39:52] i did this and god said i know you did
[39:54] an integrity of heart but you better
[39:56] restore that man
[39:57] because he's my prophet and you better
[40:00] have
[40:00] him pray for you amen you mean the man
[40:03] that just lied to me
[40:04] the man that got me in this whole mess i
[40:07] gotta go have pray for me
[40:09] yes sir he's my prophet amen and
[40:13] and god wasn't regarding the the what we
[40:16] would call a little white lie
[40:17] because she was his half sister but this
[40:19] little white lie
[40:20] that's not white black blue green yellow
[40:23] purple it's alive
[40:24] it's a lie it's a lie that's the bottom
[40:26] line of that
[40:27] he lied to him but god says you go have
[40:30] him pray for you because if you don't
[40:32] you're in you and your kingdom is done
[40:35] so when god's
[40:36] prophet god the man that god sets up in
[40:39] this situation
[40:40] just like uh just like moses was as soon
[40:43] as
[40:43] emiriam uh spoke against him
[40:46] uh for for marrying the ethiopian woman
[40:49] god struck her with leprosy because that
[40:52] was god's problem it didn't matter if
[40:53] miriam was moses sister
[40:55] god struck her with leprosy that sign of
[40:59] sin
[41:00] god signifying to miriam what you just
[41:02] did was
[41:03] wrong in my eyes and that's what sin is
[41:06] now you can look and say sin is unbelief
[41:09] of course unbelief yes well
[41:11] if she if she believed it she wouldn't
[41:13] have spoke against it
[41:14] he said but i don't understand that was
[41:16] a lot of things i don't understand
[41:17] a lot of there's a lot of things happen
[41:19] that none of us understand
[41:21] but we have to trust and believe that if
[41:23] it's in god's plan or god's working it
[41:25] out then
[41:25] we just we take care of uh of what puts
[41:29] god puts in front of us but let's look
[41:32] at this for a moment
[41:34] uh in numbers chapter 12 verse 1
[41:37] miriam and aaron spoke against moses
[41:40] because of the ethiopian woman whom he
[41:42] had married
[41:43] for he had married an ethiopian woman
[41:45] and they said had the lord indeed spoken
[41:47] only by
[41:48] moses has he not also spoken
[41:51] also by us and the lord heard it of
[41:54] course the lord
[41:55] hears everything now the man moses was
[41:57] very meek above all those that were upon
[41:59] the face the earth meek
[42:01] lowly humble contrite moses is a very
[42:04] humble man
[42:06] probably the speech impediment he had
[42:08] may have made him that way
[42:09] a lot of times a person that's not very
[42:11] boisterous or very loud or
[42:13] talks a lot is someone who tends to be
[42:15] meek now just because someone's quiet
[42:17] doesn't mean they're humble but a lot of
[42:20] times a person who ends up
[42:22] not verbalizing things like they
[42:23] normally would or being out front or
[42:25] something tend to be a little more on
[42:27] the meek side
[42:28] a little more tender a little more uh
[42:30] because they've been through it
[42:32] see they've been through all of the the
[42:34] the the
[42:36] embarrassment or the shame or whatever
[42:38] that person feels of that impediment in
[42:39] their life
[42:40] and moses had that impediment so he
[42:43] naturally was
[42:44] a meek man he was a humble man he was
[42:46] contrite
[42:47] uh you look at uh the prophet today
[42:49] brother branham you know
[42:50] shortened stature living the way he
[42:52] lived and and uh
[42:54] or grew up and all and you know he just
[42:56] wanted to live out in the woods
[42:58] he didn't want to be around anybody see
[43:00] because
[43:01] just the kind of a nature that he was
[43:03] see and and moses was that of that
[43:06] nature he was meek he was a very neat
[43:08] person so
[43:09] for for moses and or for miriam and
[43:12] aaron to have said something
[43:13] and miriam did have said hey does god
[43:15] only speak by moses he speak through us
[43:17] too
[43:18] moses wasn't someone to to come forth
[43:21] and lash
[43:21] back out or he he was one that would
[43:24] just
[43:24] that would probably just stand there and
[43:26] become humble about it
[43:28] and meek about it but you know that
[43:31] that's just
[43:32] the person's characteristic but god
[43:34] heard it see
[43:35] and when god heard it god responded amen
[43:38] fourth verse and the lord spake suddenly
[43:42] now look who he spoke to he despiced
[43:44] miriam
[43:45] naam's one that just made the descript
[43:47] the indiscretion
[43:48] but he didn't talk to her he talked to
[43:50] moses
[43:51] he talked to his mouthpiece he talked to
[43:54] his prophet
[43:55] and he talked to moses he and i'm aaron
[43:58] and uncle miriam came out there three
[44:00] unto the tabernacle of the congregation
[44:02] and they three came out
[44:03] god spoke to moses said now all three of
[44:05] you come out here i gotta talk to you i
[44:08] got something to say about this
[44:09] situation
[44:10] and the lord came down the pillar of the
[44:11] cloud and stood in the door of the
[44:13] tabernacle and called aaron and mirren
[44:15] and they both came forth
[44:16] and he said hear now my words if there
[44:19] be a prophet among you i the lord will
[44:21] make myself
[44:22] known unto him in a vision and will
[44:23] speak unto him in a dream
[44:25] my servant moses is not it is not so who
[44:29] is faithful
[44:30] in all mine house with him will i speak
[44:33] mouth to mouth even apparently and not
[44:35] in dark
[44:36] speeches and the simplitude of the lord
[44:38] shall be behold
[44:39] shall he behold wherefore then were ye
[44:42] not afraid to speak against my servant
[44:44] moses
[44:46] the end of the lord was and the anger of
[44:48] the lord was kindled against them
[44:50] and he departed and the cloud departed
[44:52] from all the tabernacles
[44:54] and behold miriam became leprous white
[44:57] as snow
[44:58] and aaron looked upon miriam and behold
[45:01] she was leprous
[45:02] that sin something that displeased god
[45:06] an uh a period an action of unbelief
[45:10] a departure from the from the faith
[45:14] and and the truth that they lived in
[45:16] this whole time
[45:17] since god put uh put it on moses and
[45:20] sent him back to egypt and framed it
[45:22] from egypt
[45:22] god had put that on moses from that time
[45:25] forward
[45:26] now that unbelief that sin had come in
[45:30] and she spoke of it and god struck her
[45:32] with leprosy god
[45:33] judged that sin right there
[45:36] now today uh
[45:40] those exact same things happen
[45:43] although today we see it more in a
[45:45] spiritual form
[45:46] than a natural form a person is struck
[45:48] with leprosy
[45:50] spiritually today rather than physically
[45:52] people do
[45:53] things and spake against things and and
[45:56] and
[45:57] and sin unbelief but you don't
[46:00] recognize it you don't feel the
[46:02] immediate effects of it right
[46:04] because it's more in a spiritual realm
[46:06] today than it is a physical realm
[46:08] then it was physical you saw it notice
[46:10] the immediate response
[46:12] the immediate uh uh reprecussions of her
[46:15] actions right then and there
[46:17] she was struck with luck so you could
[46:18] see it on earth white as snow the bible
[46:21] says
[46:22] she was struck just like that and when
[46:24] she was
[46:25] they saw that that was something that
[46:27] was displeasing to the lord
[46:29] god said how could you do this why would
[46:32] you do this this
[46:33] is my prophet this is my mouthpiece you
[46:35] don't speak against him
[46:37] this is a man that i hold in high esteem
[46:40] and how dare you feel like you could say
[46:43] something against him
[46:44] when you say something against him
[46:46] you're saying it against me
[46:48] right now it didn't say that right there
[46:50] but that's the truth of the matter
[46:52] right when you said something against
[46:54] him against moses you said it against
[46:56] him
[46:57] because see it's the same thing today
[46:59] when someone says something or speaks
[47:01] against another
[47:02] or speaks against you they're not
[47:04] putting you down they're putting god
[47:06] down
[47:06] right when they're putting you out
[47:08] they're not putting you out they're
[47:10] putting god out
[47:11] and when they put him out then you see
[47:13] the repercussion
[47:14] now you don't see their flesh turn white
[47:17] you might not see the immediate effects
[47:19] of it friend
[47:20] but a person's life will will continue
[47:22] to erode from that point until they make
[47:24] that right
[47:25] now thankfully because of the blood of
[47:27] jesus christ there's a place you can go
[47:29] to
[47:30] and become cleansed from that
[47:32] unrighteousness now
[47:33] you should go to that person and make it
[47:35] right as well right if another
[47:37] individual is involved in your
[47:38] indiscretion you should go to that
[47:40] person and ask them for forgiveness
[47:42] you should be contrite and repent not
[47:44] just to the lord but to one another
[47:47] right and god will forgive absolutely
[47:49] wipe that
[47:50] and it will be the sin will be white as
[47:53] snow
[47:54] amen amen praise the lord now it says in
[47:58] aaron 11th verse aaron said unto moses
[48:00] alas
[48:00] my lord i beseech thee lay not the sin
[48:04] upon us wherein we have done foolishly
[48:07] and wherein we have sinned
[48:11] let her not be as one dead of whom the
[48:14] flesh is half consumed when he cometh
[48:16] out of his mother's womb
[48:18] moses cried unto the lord saying hear
[48:21] her now
[48:21] oh god i beseech thee and the lord said
[48:24] unto moses if her father had but spit in
[48:26] her face should she not
[48:27] be ashamed seven days let her be shut
[48:29] out from the camp seven days
[48:30] and after that let her be received yet
[48:33] again marion was shut out of the camp
[48:35] she had to be excluded from the camp she
[48:37] had to be
[48:38] completely outside the camp she could
[48:41] not have interaction
[48:42] she could not be with anybody she could
[48:44] not speak with any of them
[48:46] none of the believers she was to have
[48:48] anything to do with
[48:49] for seven days she had to be shut
[48:51] completely out
[48:52] ostracized for seven days and after that
[48:56] seven days see now
[48:57] after that seven days she was cleansed
[49:00] and they didn't do anything they didn't
[49:02] move anywhere they didn't
[49:03] uh uh they they didn't travel or do
[49:05] anything different and they just kept
[49:07] camped right there for seven days
[49:09] and when the seven days was up she was
[49:11] brought in again
[49:12] and when she was brought in after one of
[49:14] the people removed from hezron and
[49:16] pitched in the wilderness apparent
[49:18] because they were able to move because
[49:20] the sin had been
[49:21] judged the sin had been cleansed but who
[49:23] did god listen to to bring that sin
[49:26] under subjection to the forgiveness of
[49:29] god
[49:29] he listened to his prophet moses when
[49:32] god cried out when moses cried out to
[49:34] god he said god forgive her
[49:36] hold not this sin against her god heard
[49:38] moses
[49:39] and god said well seven days now
[49:42] remember
[49:43] the the number seven in the bible is
[49:45] completion
[49:46] right so she was to reach that complete
[49:49] stage
[49:50] of my forgiveness of my acceptance of
[49:53] the repentant
[49:54] nature and once that's been received is
[49:56] seven days it's got up
[49:58] she's still going to be now could god
[49:59] have clenched her right then and there
[50:01] sure
[50:02] but that would have been complementary
[50:04] to the scripture it wouldn't have been
[50:06] complementary to the word
[50:07] running in continuity all the way
[50:09] through god had to do it the way that it
[50:11] was supposed to be done
[50:12] as he had showed to them all through the
[50:14] bible as he was
[50:16] typing shadow even in today where we see
[50:19] that that seven
[50:20] is completion it had to run that seven
[50:22] days before it could be completed before
[50:25] it could be
[50:26] a cleansed now we know today
[50:29] that if we go back and see in in first
[50:32] john chapter one
[50:33] that that that the bible says if
[50:36] if we confess our sin he is just and
[50:39] faithful to forgive us of our sins
[50:41] and to cleanse us from all
[50:44] unrighteousness
[50:45] right to cleanse us from all
[50:47] unrighteousness
[50:48] now we know that there's a three-step
[50:50] process that god gives us
[50:52] a three-step process to salvation
[50:56] justification sanctification and receive
[50:59] the holy ghost
[51:00] amen that's the three-step process to
[51:02] salvation that's perfection
[51:04] to reach the place of perfection you
[51:07] must go through those three steps
[51:09] now sometimes those three steps happen
[51:11] simultaneously
[51:13] sometimes they happen over a period of
[51:14] time sometimes they happen maybe over a
[51:17] large period of time
[51:18] it just depends it just depends on the
[51:21] individual
[51:22] see that's the misconception that a lot
[51:24] of denominations and churches have today
[51:26] they think that as soon as you say
[51:28] something you're a justified sanctified
[51:31] filled with the holy ghost right then
[51:32] and there
[51:33] all you have to do is admit it all you
[51:35] had to do is speak it all you had to do
[51:36] is say it
[51:37] i know the bible says if you confess
[51:39] with your mouth i know that what the
[51:40] bible says
[51:42] but god many times run that process
[51:45] through a period of time it doesn't
[51:48] always happen just as
[51:50] i know when i was in the baptist church
[51:52] you know
[51:53] as soon as you wanted to get baptized of
[51:55] course they never even talked about
[51:57] justification or sanctification or any
[51:59] of that
[51:59] and they certainly never talked about
[52:01] being having the holy ghost
[52:03] uh the being filled with the holy spirit
[52:05] is being born again he talked about
[52:07] being born again
[52:08] but they're being born again meant you
[52:10] were baptized
[52:11] baptized not being born again right
[52:14] that's just a cleansing process show to
[52:16] the world and your confession
[52:18] you show the rest of the world you
[52:19] accepted jesus christ as your savior
[52:21] well that's well and good because
[52:22] there's millions of people around the
[52:23] world that's done that
[52:25] but how many people has god come and
[52:27] showed to you
[52:28] that he has accepted you my acceptance
[52:32] of him is one thing
[52:33] his acceptance of me is another and
[52:36] that's when he fills me with his spirit
[52:38] when he fills you with his spirit
[52:40] is showing to you and proving to the
[52:42] rest of the world that
[52:43] jesus has accepted you oh there's
[52:46] millions and millions come down
[52:48] to the altar of billy graham's uh
[52:50] crusades and that's wonderful fine and
[52:52] dandy i've been one of them
[52:54] i went down one time with a friend of
[52:56] mine at the
[52:58] at the stadium in charlotte north
[52:59] carolina we went to a billy graham
[53:01] and he wanted to go down i said i'll go
[53:03] with you
[53:05] i walked down there with him it was
[53:07] throngs of people all around down there
[53:10] you know some of them were just talking
[53:11] some of them were on their uh with their
[53:14] friends or whatever i was gonna say on
[53:15] their phone but they wouldn't phones in
[53:16] so
[53:17] it wasn't during that area time but you
[53:20] know distracted is kind of the point i'm
[53:22] trying to make
[53:23] some of them distracted and some are
[53:24] making fun and some of them laughing
[53:26] some very serious some of their hands up
[53:29] some singing some praying you know
[53:32] and my friend was very sincere and but
[53:36] but all that was was just get to the
[53:38] place that you say
[53:39] uh lord even it was sincere enough since
[53:41] here lord i i receive you as my savior
[53:44] forgive me in my sin
[53:46] that's well and good that's perfect but
[53:48] a house that's
[53:49] garnished and cleaned and doesn't get
[53:51] filled with the spirit of god
[53:52] that same devil will come back in with
[53:54] seven more worse than him
[53:56] right yes there's got to be that next
[53:58] step
[53:59] it's all nice that there's millions and
[54:01] millions of those but what
[54:02] happens when uh uh when the spirit of
[54:05] god doesn't come in
[54:06] and feel that empty space feel that
[54:09] heart
[54:10] feel that soul when god doesn't come in
[54:13] there
[54:13] then then you're just open for the devil
[54:17] and all the devil brings all the enemies
[54:19] that come in with it
[54:20] but see if you if you confess with your
[54:24] mouth
[54:25] if you are cleansed of your
[54:27] unrighteousness
[54:29] when god has cleansed you you have been
[54:31] made clean
[54:33] when you've been made clean that means
[54:35] that that that all the sin
[54:36] all the wrongdoing all the
[54:39] unrighteousness
[54:40] is no longer accounted to you it no
[54:44] longer is held to your
[54:46] charge it it's no longer a part of the
[54:49] account that god
[54:50] keeps record in heaven it's wiped clean
[54:55] but now what does it do for the rest of
[54:56] the time
[54:58] for the rest of your life yeah all the
[55:00] the past sins are
[55:02] are done away with and god cleanses that
[55:04] and
[55:05] and and makes you clean that you can
[55:08] walk it
[55:08] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[55:11] praise the lord unrighteousness well
[55:14] what is unrighteousness that's the
[55:16] absolute opposite of righteousness well
[55:17] what is righteousness god
[55:20] well what's the opposite of god the
[55:21] devil so
[55:23] if you want to understand what
[55:25] unrighteousness is you've got the devil
[55:28] the devil is unrighteous and all his
[55:30] deeds
[55:31] all of that is unrighteous anything
[55:32] that's not righteous is unrighteous
[55:35] anything is not of god is sin
[55:38] and sin is as leprosy and that sin
[55:42] has to be judged and when that sin is
[55:45] judged it's judged at the altar of the
[55:48] uh
[55:48] of of the believer of of jesus christ
[55:52] at the cross uh the shedding of his
[55:54] blood
[55:55] annihilates that sin has to be judged
[55:59] right there god at calvary judged it
[56:03] and if you ask and you you
[56:06] ask god to forgive then he is just and
[56:08] faithful we forg
[56:10] we if we confess our sins he is faithful
[56:12] and just forgive our sins
[56:14] cleanse us amen and when you're cleansed
[56:18] you're cleansed god cleans you
[56:21] let's go to ezekiel for a few moments
[56:26] ezekiel chapter 36.
[56:32] and keep that seventh day on your heart
[56:36] i don't know that i'll be able to get to
[56:38] that part today
[56:40] um i thought for a moment i might be
[56:42] able to but
[56:43] once i get into that it just takes a
[56:45] little bit of time that i want to spend
[56:47] on that to go through it
[56:49] that seven days that seven-day process
[56:52] that miriam went through
[56:53] and understanding the significance all
[56:55] through the scripture that that means
[56:58] the reason god did that see there's
[57:00] nothing
[57:01] frivolous god doesn't do anything
[57:03] frivolous right he doesn't do anything
[57:05] just because he said
[57:06] i think today you know i woke up in a
[57:09] bad mood so
[57:10] you got to wait seven days and see god
[57:13] doesn't do that
[57:14] we we wake up with a in a bad mood or
[57:17] we're
[57:17] grumpy till i get our coffee or eat
[57:19] something or whatever
[57:20] but not god god doesn't wake up the next
[57:23] day and say oh i had a wonderful night's
[57:25] sleep so you only have to wait one day
[57:27] i'll do it for you instantaneously no
[57:29] he's got to do it the exact same way all
[57:31] the way through or he's
[57:32] not god see god doesn't have those ups
[57:35] and downs he doesn't have the goods and
[57:36] bads
[57:38] it's all good to him so once he's done
[57:40] it he's got to do it that way all the
[57:42] way through but the understanding of why
[57:44] god does it that way
[57:45] why would god do that see to help us
[57:49] understand and it's and it runs through
[57:51] the numerology of the scripture
[57:53] just like three there's three steps to
[57:55] that perfection justification
[57:56] sanctification the holy ghost
[57:58] and that completion the seven uh the the
[58:01] seven
[58:01] stages of that completion that cleansing
[58:05] amen that cleansing which is actually
[58:08] the title of the message
[58:09] uh is is cleansing of that cleansing to
[58:12] be cleaned
[58:14] that's wonderful to be clean think about
[58:17] that friend
[58:17] you know we don't we live in a in a
[58:21] country
[58:22] where water and shower and soap and
[58:24] things are so
[58:25] readily available but you know if you go
[58:28] to third world countries you go
[58:30] places that just they don't have that
[58:32] kind of thing they they may not have
[58:34] running water
[58:34] they may not have a shower or soap or
[58:36] something that shampoo you can actually
[58:39] clean yourself
[58:40] it's hard to understand what it's like
[58:42] when you've been your entire life
[58:44] clean to understand how dirty you were
[58:48] how dirty you are or would be if you
[58:50] were in that situation
[58:52] but to think about somebody or
[58:54] somebody's people
[58:56] uh that that are around the world
[58:59] that are filthy they're absolutely
[59:04] disgustingly filthy dirty now i'm
[59:07] talking spiritually not
[59:08] physically now dirty yeah
[59:11] because they have not been cleansed
[59:14] their sins have not been washed away
[59:17] the the the things that they keep piling
[59:19] up see
[59:21] we cleanse ourselves daily at least
[59:24] right you go to the lord and ask god to
[59:27] forgive you
[59:28] daily at least daily if not more often
[59:31] than daily
[59:32] lord forgive me my sin forgive me and my
[59:34] wrong doing forgive me of
[59:36] this certain thing i did or this or the
[59:38] thing i said whatever
[59:39] you ask god forgiveness god cleanses you
[59:42] god cleans you
[59:43] so you live in that perpetual state of
[59:47] of cleanness uh i get a little ahead of
[59:50] myself on that one but that's okay
[59:53] we can try to get back to that next week
[59:55] lord willing
[59:56] but we live in a perpetual state of
[59:58] cleanness
[59:59] just like living in the united states
[1:00:02] living in a place where we have readily
[1:00:05] available
[1:00:06] running water showers and soap and we're
[1:00:09] blessed friend
[1:00:10] and there's millions of people around
[1:00:11] the world that don't have that one
[1:00:13] simple
[1:00:14] luxury one simple luxury
[1:00:17] of being able to live in a perpetual
[1:00:20] state of cleanness
[1:00:22] to be clean always clean now you might
[1:00:25] get dirty or go do a job or play outside
[1:00:27] or
[1:00:28] jump in mud puddles or something if your
[1:00:30] kids are you know you might get dirty or
[1:00:32] sweaty or something but then you go and
[1:00:34] say well i got to take a shower
[1:00:36] you know as people come home after a
[1:00:38] hard day's work after walking through
[1:00:40] the dung of animals and
[1:00:41] and and living with them and handling
[1:00:44] them and not have that luxury they go
[1:00:46] home and they sit at their dinner table
[1:00:48] stinky and filthy yeah because they
[1:00:50] don't have that
[1:00:51] luxury they might not even have a dinner
[1:00:53] table i just said dinner table they
[1:00:55] might not even have that
[1:00:56] they might be sitting at their little
[1:00:58] plate of rice or whatever it is
[1:01:00] and they stay filthy they usually stay
[1:01:03] dirty but we don't have that
[1:01:06] but see when you live in that situation
[1:01:09] when you
[1:01:10] live in that condition you don't know
[1:01:12] another way
[1:01:13] we're blessed because we have it see but
[1:01:16] see
[1:01:16] people who live in that a lot of times
[1:01:19] they don't recognize or
[1:01:21] realize that they're living in a
[1:01:24] in a state of physical
[1:01:27] cleanliness that we would consider
[1:01:30] filthy
[1:01:32] smelly dirty
[1:01:35] some of us would take a bottle of
[1:01:36] perfume and pour over their heads or
[1:01:39] or or something just to try to alleviate
[1:01:41] some of the odor
[1:01:44] just the slightest doesn't in this
[1:01:46] country i know i've
[1:01:47] said in places next to people who
[1:01:49] haven't showered or
[1:01:51] don't shower or use deodorant or
[1:01:52] something and it's quite pungent
[1:01:55] and unpleasant uh and i
[1:01:58] want to get away from that person
[1:02:00] normally as quickly as i can
[1:02:02] but there's people who live like that
[1:02:04] all the time every day
[1:02:06] and they don't know any better
[1:02:07] necessarily right they don't know
[1:02:09] because they don't have
[1:02:11] and it becomes common to them if it
[1:02:14] comes to a place that they
[1:02:16] they they just don't even think anything
[1:02:17] about it it's not something that
[1:02:20] that comes on their minds readily it's
[1:02:22] not something that they
[1:02:23] that they entertain or think about
[1:02:25] because they're always dirty
[1:02:27] they're always filthy and there's no
[1:02:30] other option
[1:02:32] if they have no option then they have to
[1:02:35] stay dirty
[1:02:36] i hope you understand your spiritual
[1:02:38] thinking camps today what i'm talking
[1:02:39] about
[1:02:40] i'm talking about physical filthiness
[1:02:43] but there's
[1:02:44] millions billions of people living on
[1:02:47] this planet
[1:02:48] today spiritually in the same condition
[1:02:52] they might take a shower six times a day
[1:02:55] they might
[1:02:56] go through a stick of deodorant every
[1:02:58] day they might
[1:02:59] pour on a bottle of perfume every day
[1:03:02] but
[1:03:02] inside the inside they're spiritually
[1:03:05] filthy
[1:03:07] and they get so used to living in the
[1:03:10] filth
[1:03:11] that they don't realize there's a way of
[1:03:12] there's a way out
[1:03:14] they don't recognize because they get so
[1:03:16] used to the dirtiness
[1:03:18] they get so used to the filth and you
[1:03:21] notice it's just that way in the world
[1:03:24] you notice if you think back 100 years
[1:03:27] ago you think about 200 years ago
[1:03:29] and you think about the progression just
[1:03:32] think about this country
[1:03:33] of course very few of us have gone out
[1:03:35] of this country maybe new mexico or
[1:03:37] something or canada but
[1:03:38] very few of us have actually gone out of
[1:03:40] this country to a third world country or
[1:03:42] something
[1:03:43] of that sort maybe nobody i don't know
[1:03:45] has anybody gone to a third world
[1:03:47] country out of this
[1:03:48] i never have no i've gone to mexico and
[1:03:50] canada
[1:03:51] at the extent of my international travel
[1:03:54] so i haven't none of us have so
[1:03:57] but when you think of it but i know a
[1:03:59] lot of missionaries
[1:04:00] and i have friends and know people who
[1:04:02] live in places like that
[1:04:04] and and how they are but let's just
[1:04:06] think in america
[1:04:08] in the united states if you think about
[1:04:10] the united states
[1:04:11] and how cunningly the devil since he got
[1:04:15] control of this
[1:04:16] eve since he got control of this planet
[1:04:19] this herb
[1:04:20] he's progressively now
[1:04:24] look back at when the fall first took
[1:04:26] place
[1:04:28] when the fall first took place there
[1:04:30] wasn't a great
[1:04:31] huge change you didn't go
[1:04:35] from adam and eve in the garden of eden
[1:04:36] to what we have today
[1:04:38] just like that it didn't happen that way
[1:04:40] right
[1:04:41] but progressively over a little bit of
[1:04:44] time look at the church ages
[1:04:46] go back and read revelation of 2 3
[1:04:49] and look at the church ages and see how
[1:04:52] progressively
[1:04:53] the devil has brought that sin in
[1:04:56] how progressively and cunningly and just
[1:04:59] a minuscule at a time
[1:05:02] just a little bit just to change
[1:05:04] somebody over this way or to change this
[1:05:06] over that way or
[1:05:07] just to to make this just a little
[1:05:09] dirtier
[1:05:10] to make this a little uh more ungodly
[1:05:14] to make this a little a little filthier
[1:05:16] do you got what you got today
[1:05:19] and you see what's going on in the world
[1:05:20] today think about what brother brown
[1:05:23] endured and what he lived through and
[1:05:25] preached about
[1:05:27] now here 50 60 70 years later and what
[1:05:30] have we got now
[1:05:30] what do you think he would say about it
[1:05:32] now
[1:05:34] but these people become so numb
[1:05:38] that if that living in the filthiness
[1:05:41] becomes so common to them they just
[1:05:43] don't recognize it
[1:05:44] and they don't realize that they even
[1:05:47] need to be
[1:05:48] cleansed right they don't know that
[1:05:51] they're living in a perpetual
[1:05:53] state of filthiness they don't know that
[1:05:56] they go get drunk every night or live
[1:05:58] with different men or women or
[1:06:01] or or think they're a man and a woman at
[1:06:03] the same time
[1:06:04] or or whatever disgusting thing they do
[1:06:06] today
[1:06:08] which is pretty bad yes
[1:06:12] but they don't know they don't recognize
[1:06:15] they need to be cleansed they don't
[1:06:18] realize there's a fountain
[1:06:20] flowing that'll just sweep through their
[1:06:24] lives and clean them
[1:06:25] and cleanse them from all of the
[1:06:27] filthiness
[1:06:28] i can't even imagine i feel sorry for
[1:06:30] you i
[1:06:32] you know i i am a proponent of kids
[1:06:34] going back to school i think a lot of
[1:06:36] kids should be
[1:06:37] have in class face-to-face learning with
[1:06:39] their teachers
[1:06:40] but i was almost glad you girls moses
[1:06:42] you'd have to go to school
[1:06:44] uh i can't imagine what it's like today
[1:06:48] i think about what it was like when me
[1:06:50] and my wife were in high school at the
[1:06:51] cdo
[1:06:52] and how bad it was then
[1:06:55] but we thought something horrible in our
[1:06:57] school was because they had a little
[1:06:59] designated smoking area
[1:07:01] we thought that was bad now what have
[1:07:05] they got today
[1:07:06] oh the field but what is it
[1:07:09] they enter into that i saw some little
[1:07:12] kid at the playground yesterday couldn't
[1:07:14] have been anymore
[1:07:14] any older than joel maybe a little bit
[1:07:17] older seven
[1:07:18] eight nine had earrings piercings in his
[1:07:20] ears already
[1:07:22] and i'm thinking and i look over his
[1:07:25] mother
[1:07:25] and she's tattooed from head to toe
[1:07:28] i thought well no one the poor kid
[1:07:30] didn't have a chance right
[1:07:32] that poor kid didn't have a shot look at
[1:07:34] the way he was born the home
[1:07:36] he was born into and just a little bit
[1:07:38] at a time
[1:07:39] they don't recognize how disgustingly
[1:07:41] filthy they are
[1:07:43] they don't recognize they need to be
[1:07:44] cleansed
[1:07:46] and unless they recognize that they need
[1:07:48] to be cleansed
[1:07:49] they're never going to seek for a place
[1:07:52] to find
[1:07:52] the cleanse the cleansing they're never
[1:07:55] going to try to get a hold
[1:07:57] of what they need to get to be cleansed
[1:08:00] because they don't recognize
[1:08:02] how filthy they are how dirty how
[1:08:05] disgusting they are
[1:08:07] but friend that's that's the part of the
[1:08:09] duty that god has given us
[1:08:11] not that we go up to to these people and
[1:08:14] say
[1:08:15] you know you're a devil and you need to
[1:08:17] have god in your life but
[1:08:19] you know when you have influence over
[1:08:20] somebody or if god influences you to
[1:08:23] speak to somebody
[1:08:24] which is usually what i do if i feel led
[1:08:26] of the lord to do something then i'll
[1:08:28] say something
[1:08:29] uh i do it to my barber almost every
[1:08:31] time we go get our hair cut
[1:08:33] i mentioned something to him about the
[1:08:35] lord he's staunch catholic but you know
[1:08:37] i mentioned something to him about the
[1:08:38] lord to
[1:08:39] the scripture to try to bring him back
[1:08:42] to that
[1:08:42] and try to help him understand look at
[1:08:44] where it's gotten now they're they're
[1:08:46] they're on the verge
[1:08:47] uh he's already endorsed homosexuality
[1:08:49] but they're right on the verge
[1:08:51] of endorsing abortion even and
[1:08:54] and women ministers and and i know him
[1:08:56] as a conservative somewhat man he
[1:08:59] is absolutely against it and the church
[1:09:01] their church been against it
[1:09:03] for years but what has this country done
[1:09:07] amen it's just like the government
[1:09:11] they they they do something and uh
[1:09:14] i i guess your stimulus is coming at you
[1:09:17] micah
[1:09:17] i think mike said he's got his but you
[1:09:19] know it's coming at you but
[1:09:21] who knows what else is stuck in that
[1:09:24] two trillion dollars that there's
[1:09:26] spending of things that
[1:09:28] you know you understand what i'm saying
[1:09:31] that filthiness that gets thrown in
[1:09:33] there
[1:09:34] and most people don't even know it most
[1:09:36] people don't see it
[1:09:37] and unfortunately most people don't care
[1:09:40] yeah as long as my my four no more is
[1:09:43] okay you send me my piggly little crumbs
[1:09:45] and i'll put it in the bacon i'll be
[1:09:46] good
[1:09:47] that they don't care yeah and that's
[1:09:50] where it's at
[1:09:51] that's that's the perpetual existence
[1:09:54] people have today
[1:09:55] of filthiness in their lives and they're
[1:09:57] so filthy they don't
[1:09:59] they they can be absolutely
[1:10:02] worse than a pig enough and a wallop
[1:10:06] but not even realize don't even know
[1:10:09] that they're filthy
[1:10:10] that they're that they're that dirty
[1:10:12] that they need to be cleansed
[1:10:14] i recognize it because i was like that
[1:10:17] one day
[1:10:18] yeah i recognize it because i know what
[1:10:20] i where i was
[1:10:21] before god spoke to me and cleansed me
[1:10:25] so i understand what that point is and
[1:10:27] where it is and how
[1:10:28] easily it can to try to get you and you
[1:10:31] know
[1:10:32] how easily that that filth out there
[1:10:34] will try to draw you back in again
[1:10:36] oh it's not so bad you just just take
[1:10:39] just a little corn you don't you don't
[1:10:40] need to dive right back in again
[1:10:42] you i just take this little corner over
[1:10:44] here you know that wasn't so bad
[1:10:46] that won't hurt you bad and then the
[1:10:47] next thing you know you need the next
[1:10:48] corner you need
[1:10:50] and he's got you right back in there
[1:10:52] again see filthy
[1:10:54] dirty but but thankfully the part of
[1:10:57] that is
[1:10:58] that god cleanses and when he cleanses
[1:11:00] he cleanses you completely
[1:11:03] amen now let's look at ezekiel
[1:11:06] i'm not sure if i had to turn over there
[1:11:08] yet but let's look at ezekiel for just a
[1:11:10] moment
[1:11:11] because i'll probably have to close
[1:11:12] after this scripture
[1:11:15] ezekiel chapter 36.
[1:11:26] you know friend we all were there but i
[1:11:29] i really don't even like to think back
[1:11:31] at the time when i was that filthy
[1:11:33] to think back at the time when i was
[1:11:36] when i was so dirty
[1:11:38] i mean it's amazing that
[1:11:41] god would even want to take somebody
[1:11:42] that was as filthy and dirty as i was to
[1:11:44] bring them in
[1:11:45] and clean them but you know his his
[1:11:48] blood
[1:11:49] cleanses from all unrighteousness it
[1:11:52] means
[1:11:52] all right it doesn't matter where you
[1:11:54] were it doesn't matter what you did it
[1:11:56] doesn't matter what you went through
[1:11:58] that blood cleanses from all
[1:12:00] unrighteousness
[1:12:02] amen my brother-in-law think i've told
[1:12:04] you before
[1:12:05] he said he had sinned so bad he didn't
[1:12:06] think that he could ever be clean i said
[1:12:08] that's the devil talking to you
[1:12:11] that's the devil trying to keep you from
[1:12:13] getting under the water fountain
[1:12:15] you get under the spigot and i promise
[1:12:17] you it will clean you
[1:12:19] amen now it might wash a little clot of
[1:12:21] dirt off here
[1:12:22] and then later it might wash or clot off
[1:12:24] a dirt off of here
[1:12:26] but it will cleanse you right amen it
[1:12:28] will cleanse you
[1:12:30] i had somebody before be uh
[1:12:34] j well i say judgment they were critical
[1:12:37] because i baptized the man who was still
[1:12:39] smoking
[1:12:41] and i said you know just get them under
[1:12:44] that water
[1:12:45] yeah just get them under that fountain
[1:12:48] just get them in the presence of god god
[1:12:50] will do the work
[1:12:51] that's right amen yes man i i i if
[1:12:54] someone
[1:12:55] in their heart feels they want to be
[1:12:57] baptized i'm not going to
[1:12:58] i'm not going to tell them no if they
[1:13:00] want to do it
[1:13:01] my grandson right now he's only seven
[1:13:04] but if he come and ask me
[1:13:05] i baptize him absolutely if he wanted to
[1:13:09] if somebody in their heart wanted to be
[1:13:11] then it's not for me to say no
[1:13:13] right i told him i said you know brother
[1:13:15] brown i'm baptized man oh yeah but that
[1:13:17] was brother bradley
[1:13:19] uh isn't he still the same god it was
[1:13:21] brother brown he is of us
[1:13:22] today brother brown didn't take any
[1:13:26] forward liberties that we're not ex that
[1:13:28] we don't have today
[1:13:29] right amen anyway it just
[1:13:33] somebody just wanted to be critical but
[1:13:34] the point is
[1:13:36] just get them there and get them to the
[1:13:38] place that they can get under that
[1:13:40] fountain and let god wash all that away
[1:13:41] from them
[1:13:42] god'll do it and you know god can do it
[1:13:46] eventually god did take that away from
[1:13:48] him praise the lord and to my knowledge
[1:13:50] they're still going and
[1:13:53] i think they live in ohio going to a
[1:13:54] message church still today

[1:15:33] them
[1:15:34] he mentioned corn but that's what he
[1:15:36] means you will walk for nothing
[1:15:39] i will bless you to where you won't be
[1:15:42] uh
[1:15:42] uh uh needful of anything
[1:15:45] and that's not what god does for us

[1:15:48] exactly the way god blesses us today
[1:15:51] that we won't
[1:15:52] we're not in want of anything sure we
[1:15:54] have prayer requests
[1:15:56] sure we ask god for needs and things
[1:15:57] we're human we live in this world
[1:15:59] but we don't want for anything friends
[1:16:01] god blesses us
[1:16:02] god keeps us god helps us in our hands i
[1:16:05] know
[1:16:06] and this church and all of you sure we
[1:16:08] have some
[1:16:09] uh urgent prayer requests and needs and
[1:16:11] things that we have in our lives and
[1:16:12] go to the doctor and maybe a surgery or
[1:16:15] something like that but god always
[1:16:16] cleanses
[1:16:17] us god always blesses us god always
[1:16:20] keeps us
[1:16:21] amen and he keeps his hand upon every
[1:16:23] one of us
[1:16:24] watches over us every day and that's
[1:16:26] what he's telling them this is what i
[1:16:28] will do for you
[1:16:29] now back over if you look in
[1:16:33] exodus which i'll just give you as i
[1:16:35] close here
[1:16:37] the little teaser that i want to get to
[1:16:39] uh for next week
[1:16:41] with the lord willing that god would
[1:16:44] have
[1:16:45] moses take the blood of the animal that
[1:16:48] had been sacrificed and the water with
[1:16:50] the hysso
[1:16:52] and he would take that blood and he
[1:16:54] would take that water
[1:16:56] and he would take it with the hyssop to
[1:16:57] sprinkle now i know
[1:16:59] god told him to take the hype and the
[1:17:01] blood of the ant uh the lamb
[1:17:03] and uh for for them and uh the uh
[1:17:06] children of israel there in egypt and
[1:17:08] the doorpost and the lentil and the
[1:17:10] death angel wouldn't come in
[1:17:12] but he also had the process of their
[1:17:14] cleansing
[1:17:16] where he would take that blood and that
[1:17:18] water
[1:17:19] and mix it with the hyssop and he would
[1:17:21] actually sprinkle the people with it
[1:17:24] he would get the hyssop in the blood and
[1:17:26] water and sprinkle the people
[1:17:28] and the word
[1:17:31] and sprinkle it with the blood and the
[1:17:33] water
[1:17:35] if you understand see that's what
[1:17:36] actually come out of the side of jesus
[1:17:38] christ
[1:17:39] amen when they pierced it blood and
[1:17:41] water
[1:17:42] came forth well that blood cleanses you
[1:17:45] from all the sin
[1:17:46] that water washes you and keeps you
[1:17:49] clean
[1:17:50] amen the blood cleanses you the water
[1:17:52] washes you
[1:17:53] it keeps you clean so you live in that
[1:17:57] perpetual state of cleanness
[1:17:59] you live spiritually in in a place
[1:18:02] of righteousness in the eyes of god
[1:18:06] that you are clothed in his
[1:18:08] righteousness
[1:18:09] you have no spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:18:12] doesn't matter what
[1:18:13] you think well i i've done something i
[1:18:15] spat something
[1:18:16] i saw something and lord forgive me but
[1:18:19] you're living
[1:18:20] because of the holy spirit in your soul
[1:18:23] you're
[1:18:24] living in that perpetual state of
[1:18:26] cleanness
[1:18:28] god isn't that concerned about what's on
[1:18:30] the outside although
[1:18:31] the inside cleans the outside too right
[1:18:34] we ask god forgiveness of those things
[1:18:36] but the inside where god now lives in
[1:18:39] your soul
[1:18:41] if you're born again god is the resident
[1:18:44] the permanent resident of your soul
[1:18:46] you live in the perpetual existence the
[1:18:49] continual existence
[1:18:51] of cleanness in god's eyes
[1:18:54] clean pure
[1:18:58] holy righteous
[1:19:01] you look at first john in first john
[1:19:04] when
[1:19:05] when he says if you say you have no sin
[1:19:07] you deceive yourselves in ver
[1:19:09] in chapter one if you confess you're
[1:19:11] false he is just and faithful to forgive
[1:19:13] you
[1:19:14] and to cleanse you from all
[1:19:15] unrighteousness and then he says but if
[1:19:17] you say you have no sin you are a liar
[1:19:20] but then over in the second chapter or
[1:19:23] third chapter
[1:19:24] he says uh he tells us that whosoever is
[1:19:27] born of god cannot commit sin
[1:19:31] well if you're born of god you can't
[1:19:33] commit sin how can you not commit sin i
[1:19:36] make mistakes all the time every day
[1:19:38] you know brother branham told brother
[1:19:40] greene you may have heard brother green
[1:19:42] say this but
[1:19:42] brother branham told brother green he
[1:19:44] says you know brother perry he said
[1:19:45] where god has me
[1:19:47] live everything we do in the eyes of god
[1:19:50] is sin right i thought well
[1:19:54] well i hope do any of us have if
[1:19:55] everything that we do in his eyes is sin
[1:19:59] then how much that what hope is for any
[1:20:01] of us
[1:20:03] it's his spirit amen it's his spirit
[1:20:06] it's god's spirit
[1:20:07] that holy spirit living in your taking
[1:20:10] over the rest of your soul living in you
[1:20:12] born again now you are clean
[1:20:17] you're not clean today and dirty
[1:20:18] tomorrow you're clean
[1:20:20] amen because you're washed by the water
[1:20:24] of the word
[1:20:25] when you're washed by the water of the
[1:20:27] word that word cleans you
[1:20:30] when that word becomes you you're in a
[1:20:32] perpetual state of cleanness
[1:20:34] because you are the word you sound
[1:20:35] washed by the word of the word no you
[1:20:37] are the word if you become the word then
[1:20:41] you're in a perpetual state of cleanness
[1:20:44] not that we don't still make mistakes in
[1:20:46] this flesh right but if you're
[1:20:47] born of god you cannot sin where in your
[1:20:50] soul where you're born
[1:20:51] again you're not born again here you go
[1:20:54] in your mother's womb the second time
[1:20:55] like nicodemus thought
[1:20:56] you're not born but you're born again in
[1:20:58] the spirit your
[1:21:00] your soul not your actually human spirit
[1:21:02] his spirit
[1:21:03] and your soul then that born again
[1:21:06] placed out there is no sin
[1:21:08] can be no sin no sin can enter in there
[1:21:11] because when god went in there he put a
[1:21:13] seal on the door
[1:21:14] yeah and when god puts a seal on friend
[1:21:16] don't you dare ever try to break it
[1:21:18] yeah people try to people will try to
[1:21:21] all the time
[1:21:21] satan will try to and people in your
[1:21:24] life sometimes might try to
[1:21:26] yeah but when god goes in there he puts
[1:21:28] a seal on it and
[1:21:29] nobody dares to go over there or try to
[1:21:31] touch that again
[1:21:32] and the man who is born again cannot
[1:21:35] commit sin
[1:21:36] amen you're in the perpetual state of
[1:21:38] cleanness
[1:21:39] because god has cleansed you amen when
[1:21:42] god cleanses you has made you free
[1:21:45] from all sin amen praise the lord
[1:21:48] next week i want to get more to that
[1:21:50] seven days
[1:21:52] amen and that seven days that we talked
[1:21:54] about and that that
[1:21:56] and that that we just read from ezekiel
[1:21:59] the blood the water
[1:22:00] the cleanse made you clean it cleansed
[1:22:04] us
[1:22:04] amen and we stay clean because of his
[1:22:07] spirit
[1:22:08] because of the word because you become
[1:22:10] the word you live in a perpetual state
[1:22:12] of cleaning now amen now
[1:22:16] you're you're such a state i'll say this
[1:22:19] you're such a state of cleanness
[1:22:22] that all the filthiness and dirtiness of
[1:22:24] that old man that died back there
[1:22:27] that old spirit that that that nature
[1:22:29] that died back there that was divorced
[1:22:32] put away as brother branham said
[1:22:35] invisible union
[1:22:36] put away in divorcement put in his
[1:22:39] forgiveness that man's gone you don't
[1:22:42] even
[1:22:43] that doesn't even come back you don't
[1:22:44] think so satan tried to get you
[1:22:46] we have a spirit that has a memory and
[1:22:48] our memory can think back at those times
[1:22:50] but it's it's not even like well who was
[1:22:53] that man
[1:22:55] who was that person back then i don't
[1:22:56] even recognize him anymore i didn't know
[1:22:58] who that was
[1:22:59] because it's all good all gone all done
[1:23:02] away with
[1:23:03] amen in god's year forgetfulness now in
[1:23:06] the eyes of god
[1:23:07] it was is and you would justify these
[1:23:09] though you had never sinned in the first
[1:23:11] place right
[1:23:12] amen aren't you thankful that cleansing
[1:23:15] that god gives to each of us
[1:23:17] praise the lord amen let's the other we
[1:23:19] could
[1:23:26] and remember just as leprosy
[1:23:30] had no way of human human means of
[1:23:33] cleansing
[1:23:35] it had to be god had to be god then
[1:23:39] people tried to cleanse themselves from
[1:23:42] their sin today
[1:23:43] but the sin today as the sin then the
[1:23:46] leprosy
[1:23:47] uncurable like human means it takes god
[1:23:50] amen the only way to be cleansed from it
[1:23:53] is by the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:55] only way man tries to do it they do like
[1:23:58] adam during the garden of eden they try
[1:23:59] to put on some kind of covering
[1:24:01] they try to be religious and try to go
[1:24:03] to church and
[1:24:04] try to project themselves into something
[1:24:06] but you can't do it without the blood of
[1:24:08] christ
[1:24:09] you can't do it unless he comes and
[1:24:11] lives in him
[1:24:12] amen then that changes it all praise the
[1:24:15] lord
[1:24:16] amen let's sing this little course amen

[1:27:38] conference room we have here hopefully
[1:27:39] we won't have to do this for too much
[1:27:41] longer
[1:27:42] just real quick before we dismiss
[1:27:45] i wrote to the realtor of the place that
[1:27:48] i'm looking at now
[1:27:50] uh i'm i'm looking diligently
[1:27:53] um uh for a place i'm not just settled
[1:27:57] on this one place so if the lord has
[1:27:59] something
[1:28:00] else then
[1:28:03] i you know i'm i'm willing to look so
[1:28:05] whatever
[1:28:06] the lord leads and whatever the lord
[1:28:07] provides that's what i want
[1:28:09] so that that's entirely up to the lord
[1:28:12] but
[1:28:13] in the meantime the one place that i'm
[1:28:15] still looking at
[1:28:17] i called the realtor i emailed him and
[1:28:20] he said the
[1:28:20] current church is still in negotiation
[1:28:23] with the town of marana
[1:28:24] to get the certificate of occupancy for
[1:28:27] their
[1:28:28] church for the new facility they're
[1:28:29] wanting to move into
[1:28:31] so whatever all the government stuff
[1:28:34] rent as you probably know
[1:28:35] the government stuff is just i mean it
[1:28:37] was already
[1:28:38] slow to get the city of tucson or marana
[1:28:41] or the state or something to do
[1:28:42] something was already slow
[1:28:44] but when kovan came and it i think it's
[1:28:47] getting a little better
[1:28:48] but it just it just slowed down to
[1:28:50] non-existent almost really
[1:28:52] um but so they're still working on it
[1:28:56] still working on trying to get the
[1:28:57] certificate of occupancy for them to
[1:28:59] move over to the new building i
[1:29:00] explained some of that to you last week
[1:29:02] uh i myself called the town of marana
[1:29:06] friday
[1:29:07] to make absolutely sure that once that
[1:29:09] church moves out
[1:29:11] it's okay for us to move in and occupy
[1:29:13] that
[1:29:14] uh that space
[1:29:17] the other realtor told me that you know
[1:29:20] it wouldn't be no problem you know there
[1:29:21] and there you should be in there
[1:29:23] but brother john yarborough told me he
[1:29:24] said don't take their word for it
[1:29:26] right he said you call them yourself and
[1:29:28] just make sure
[1:29:30] you want to get their word you want to
[1:29:32] hear from the town of miranda to make
[1:29:33] sure you have their word that y'all can
[1:29:35] meet in there
[1:29:36] so i called a very very nice lady
[1:29:39] uh and explained everything to us yes
[1:29:42] what we were doing and
[1:29:43] uh how big the church was and things
[1:29:45] like that so i explained all that and
[1:29:47] she's gonna give it to her
[1:29:49] develop person whoever it was uh
[1:29:52] to look into so i i don't expect or
[1:29:55] anticipate any issues but you can
[1:29:57] pray about that if you'd like and see
[1:29:59] where we go with that but just trust in
[1:30:01] the lord is going to provide
[1:30:02] whether it's that place or someplace
[1:30:04] else that the lord's going to provide
[1:30:06] for us the more i think about it the
[1:30:08] more i look at that the more i look at
[1:30:09] other places around i think
[1:30:11] you know if we get that place already
[1:30:14] set up and ready to move in and have
[1:30:16] church there's a facility
[1:30:19] see they have back to back uh thousand
[1:30:22] square foot units
[1:30:23] that run four wide two deep four
[1:30:27] wide on the other side is an empty one
[1:30:30] there's two empty ones actually next to
[1:30:31] each other
[1:30:32] and i thought well we might look into
[1:30:34] getting that but they're just
[1:30:35] they're just they're just concrete floor
[1:30:38] and wall i mean there's
[1:30:39] there's nothing to them they're just
[1:30:41] just almost like a shell
[1:30:43] so we would have to build out some stuff
[1:30:45] and make it
[1:30:46] nice for a church to do that but the
[1:30:49] other one
[1:30:50] uh is is just it's already ready there's
[1:30:53] really nothing to do
[1:30:55] we'll probably maybe do some stuff to it
[1:30:56] later but there's nothing to do to move
[1:30:58] in there and have church right now so
[1:31:00] anyway the lord willing we'll see what
[1:31:02] he does and what happens there but
[1:31:04] that's the situation right now and trust
[1:31:06] and believing even when the lady hung up
[1:31:08] she said
[1:31:09] bless you but you said god bless you
[1:31:11] when she hung up so
[1:31:12] i was very encouraged by that so um
[1:31:16] this that's just the update so it could
[1:31:19] happen at any moment could happen any
[1:31:21] day
[1:31:21] so just continue to pray for that and
[1:31:23] we'll see what the lord does
[1:31:24] and um checking in to see make sure we
[1:31:26] get some signage micah they have a sign
[1:31:28] up there now but micah said he can get
[1:31:30] us a sign made that goes over the
[1:31:33] front of where our church is supposed to
[1:31:34] be a big huge
[1:31:36] uh ten foot long four foot tall thing to
[1:31:39] put a sign on
[1:31:40] to for the church so making sure all
[1:31:43] that's
[1:31:43] okay and we're okay to meet there and
[1:31:46] everything's fine so
[1:31:47] we'll see just trying to be patient uh
[1:31:50] this may be the last time we meet here
[1:31:52] may not i don't know
[1:31:54] we'll just see what the lord does so
[1:31:56] just keep praying for that we love you
[1:31:57] appreciate you thank you for coming and
[1:31:59] being here today so
[1:32:00] i will keep you updated if something
[1:32:02] significant happens
[1:32:03] during the week i'll let you know uh
[1:32:05] otherwise we just keep going and praying
[1:32:07] and trusting the lord
[1:32:08] so that's about the update i have i also
[1:32:12] failed to mention to you that brother
[1:32:14] uh dave williamson called me yesterday
[1:32:16] and asked me for a couple prayer
[1:32:18] requests and some
[1:32:19] folks he knew back east i've forgotten
[1:32:22] their names so please forgive me but the
[1:32:23] lord knows
[1:32:25] but he asked very urgent uh request of
[1:32:27] prayer for a couple of people back in
[1:32:28] north carolina so remember that in
[1:32:30] prayer too if you would
[1:32:32] amen so i mentioned sister joy hawking
[1:32:35] too she's been in a lot of pain also
[1:32:38] some of you most of you probably may
[1:32:40] know but uh
[1:32:42] brother stephen lachlan uh his mother
[1:32:45] passed away
[1:32:46] so i asked you to pray for them and the
[1:32:48] lord would just comfort him

[1:32:53] how he feels
[1:32:55] friday this past friday was one year
[1:32:57] anniversary of my mom passing so

[1:33:02] understand
[1:33:03] the situation that brother steve's going
[1:33:05] through the passing of his mother but
