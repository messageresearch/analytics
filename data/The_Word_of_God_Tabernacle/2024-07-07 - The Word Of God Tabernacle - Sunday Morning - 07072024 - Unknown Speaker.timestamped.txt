[44:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[44:59] amen amen first John 1 we'll begin
[45:03] reading with verse 5 first John uh 1
[45:07] John 15 this then is the message which
[45:12] we have heard of him and declare unto
[45:14] you that God is light and in him is no
[45:18] Darkness at
[45:19] all if we say that we have fellowship
[45:22] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[45:25] do not the truth
[45:27] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[45:30] the light we have Fellowship one with
[45:33] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[45:36] his son cleanseth us from all sin if we
[45:41] say that we have no sin we deceive
[45:44] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[45:47] we confess our sin he is faithful and
[45:50] just forgive us our sins and to cleanse
[45:52] us from all
[45:54] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[45:56] not sined we make him a liar and his
[45:58] word is not in US amen you could be
[46:01] seated if you'd
[46:02] like I'd like to go back to that seventh
[46:04] verse especially but the entire reading
[46:07] that we have here amen God is light in
[46:10] him is no Darkness at all if there's no
[46:12] darkness in him and we claim to be one
[46:14] of his then there's no darkness in US
[46:17] amen amen what is that darkness that
[46:19] darkness is unbelief yes what is
[46:22] unbelief unbelief is sin amen praise the
[46:25] Lord so if we walk walk in sin and we
[46:28] say we belong to God uh our lives are
[46:30] going to need to change because we're
[46:32] making him out to be a liar actually the
[46:34] Bible says we're lying amen uh but if we
[46:37] walk in the light as he is in the light
[46:39] hear that seventh
[46:41] verse If he if we walk in the light as
[46:43] he is in the light we have Fellowship
[46:45] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[46:49] Christ his son cleanseth us from all Sin
[46:53] from all unbelief from all Darkness amen
[46:56] if we walk in that light that blood has
[46:58] cleansed us from all unrighteousness
[47:00] that blood has cleansed us from all sin
[47:03] and brought us in relationship brought
[47:05] us in Union brought us together with God
[47:09] so that God and man become one again
[47:11] amen amen praise the lord we were Bound
[47:14] in sin and the blood of Jesus Christ
[47:17] loosed us from that sin the blood of
[47:20] Jesus Christ and the light of God
[47:23] cleanses us and frees us from the
[47:26] bondage of sin from the bondage of
[47:28] unbelief and brings us in God's presence
[47:31] so that we can have again Fellowship
[47:33] amen with God uh maybe not exactly like
[47:37] uh that Adam had it in the Garden of
[47:38] Eden but as close as it's going to get
[47:40] with man on this Earth amen as man and
[47:44] God in Fellowship once again we just had
[47:47] uh the nation at a at a birthday uh a
[47:51] Fourth of July a day of what we call a
[47:53] freedom day we call a Independence Day a
[47:57] day that this nation declared its
[47:59] independence and freedom from bondage
[48:02] amen bondage of man bondage of rulership
[48:05] bondage of religion bondage of uh of
[48:08] Freedom that they that they so desired
[48:11] to want to have amen and that's why man
[48:13] regardless of what people want to say
[48:15] today regardless of everything they try
[48:17] to get rid of as far as this country is
[48:19] concerned this country was founded on
[48:21] biblical principles this this nation was
[48:25] founded on the freedom of religion to
[48:27] Worship the Lord Jesus in the way that
[48:30] we desire to Worship the Lord not based
[48:32] on what somebody dictates to us but the
[48:35] freedom of our hearts the freedom of our
[48:38] of our soul to be able to express to God
[48:40] how we feel and and how we want to
[48:42] worship and there's so many nations in
[48:44] the world today you cannot do that Amen
[48:47] in fact there's many nations in this
[48:48] world that will imprison you if you try
[48:51] to do that they will put you in jail
[48:53] they will put you to death if you have a
[48:55] Bible or if you try to have church or if
[48:58] you try to serve the Lord Jesus now
[49:00] they'll let you do it under their system
[49:03] amen they'll let you come under their
[49:05] system and worship God under their
[49:07] system but not in the freedom and
[49:09] liberty that the Lord Jesus gave us died
[49:12] and bled and gave us to be able to have
[49:14] the freedom to do it in the capacity
[49:16] that our heart demands us to do it not
[49:19] based on some religion not based on some
[49:22] denomination not based on some Creed or
[49:25] some Nation saying well if you're going
[49:27] to do it you got to do it the way we say
[49:29] to do it no he gave it to us in the way
[49:31] that from the dictates of our hearts we
[49:34] want to serve the Lord that's the
[49:36] freedom that men and women died for this
[49:39] country so that we can have the freedom
[49:41] to do that that's the reason that Jesus
[49:44] Christ went to Calvary and died so that
[49:47] we would be able to have that freedom
[49:49] today amen and now we have that freedom
[49:52] because the blood of Jesus Christ has
[49:54] cleansed us from all sin now the bondage
[49:57] of sin that Satan tried to bring man
[50:00] under in the Garden of Eden which he was
[50:02] very uh uh uh uh uh able to do which he
[50:07] accomplished quite uh uh uh quite
[50:11] outstandingly if you will he was able to
[50:13] bring this world under the bondage of
[50:16] sin but Jesus Christ Loos that bondage
[50:19] amen Jesus Christ died shed his blood to
[50:22] loose that bondage to bring us into a
[50:24] freedom now what why why would God go
[50:28] through that to bring us to a place of
[50:30] Freedom if we're not going to exercise
[50:34] that freedom in serving him if we're not
[50:37] going to exercise that freedom in
[50:39] worshiping him and living for him why
[50:41] would he do that amen he only did it for
[50:45] those who would he only went there for
[50:47] those who would serve him for those who
[50:49] would worship him for those who would
[50:52] live according to the holy spirit in
[50:54] your life by the by the freedom that God
[50:57] has given us in his word people think
[50:58] we're in bondage Saints you know that
[51:01] there's a lot of people out in the world
[51:02] today think that think that we uh in
[51:05] this message our beliefs our feelings
[51:07] our our our understanding revelation of
[51:09] the scripture puts us in bondage friend
[51:11] but I say that we are more free people
[51:14] than there are on the planet today are
[51:16] those that serve the Lord Jesus in the
[51:18] dictates of their heart by the scripture
[51:22] amen amen praise the Lord oh if they
[51:24] could just only get a taste of it they
[51:25] could understand yes if they just get a
[51:28] glimpse of it they can see why we live
[51:30] the way we live but it comes by
[51:32] Revelation it comes by God revealing it
[51:35] let's go to St
[51:37] John in uh St John chapter
[51:42] 8 as Jesus is talking to a group of
[51:46] these amen Jesus is speaking to a group
[51:49] of them now St John chapter 8
[51:56] St John chapter 8 we'll start with verse
[52:03] 30 St John 8:30 as he spake these words
[52:07] many believed on him then said Jesus to
[52:10] those Jews which believed on him if ye
[52:13] continue listen to what Jesus tells them
[52:16] now if ye continue in my word then are
[52:20] ye my disciples indeed if you continue
[52:23] in my
[52:24] word what is that walking in the light
[52:27] yes the word is the light Christ is the
[52:30] light if you continue in my word if you
[52:33] continue in the light if you continue
[52:36] living by the dictates of uh of God Amen
[52:41] through his only begotten son who was
[52:42] standing right there talking to them
[52:45] then you are then are you my disciples
[52:48] indeed and ye shall know the
[52:51] truth and the truth shall make you free
[52:54] amen who is the truth
[52:58] Jesus is the truth right amen the
[53:01] truth's not a statement the truth's not
[53:03] a word uh the truth is a person the
[53:07] truth is Jesus Christ he himself said I
[53:10] am the way the truth and the LI right
[53:13] amen no man can come to me except the
[53:16] father draw him now he's speaking to
[53:18] these that say they're Believers and
[53:21] telling them if you continue in my word
[53:24] then you will then you are then you are
[53:26] are my disciples
[53:28] right if you and ye shall know the truth
[53:32] amen the word is his is his truth and
[53:35] the truth shall make you free praise the
[53:38] Lord shall liberate you from what well
[53:42] that's the that's the question they
[53:43] didn't understand they thus they again
[53:47] with the carnal mind speaking to him
[53:49] they said they answered him we be
[53:51] Abraham's seed and were never in bondage
[53:54] to any man I'll sayth thou ye shall be
[53:57] made free see they don't understand amen
[54:00] still living in the bondage of sin and
[54:03] not realizing it amen because it t it
[54:06] takes as much an understanding of of of
[54:10] sin that it is the revelation of the
[54:14] word before someone can receive help
[54:19] they have to understand they're in
[54:21] trouble before someone can be healed
[54:25] they have to understand they're sick
[54:27] yeah right before someone can be saved
[54:30] they have to understand and come to
[54:31] acknowledge that they're lost amen
[54:34] without understanding or not coming to
[54:35] an understanding Revelation that they're
[54:38] lost how can they ever be saved it's got
[54:41] to be it has to be that acknowledgement
[54:43] it's it's the principle really one of
[54:46] the driving principles that alcoholics
[54:48] ecomist uses uh to my understanding you
[54:52] go to Alcoholic Anonymous and you
[54:54] acknowledge you're an alcohol alcoholic
[54:57] when when you go to a meeting or
[54:59] something they make you declare in front
[55:02] of all these people hi I am so and so
[55:04] and I am an alcoholic right I haven't
[55:07] drank for 20 years but I'm an alcoholic
[55:10] they make them declare that so that they
[55:13] continue to recognize I'm a human that
[55:16] always needs continual help right amen
[55:20] and we come to that recognition we know
[55:23] the Lord Jesus what he's done for us and
[55:25] what he's brought us through and who we
[55:27] are today but we also understand that
[55:29] we're human our flesh is sticky and that
[55:31] we're always the people that are in need
[55:33] of help amen but we got to First
[55:37] acknowledge that there's a problem we
[55:39] got to First acknowledge God I need help
[55:42] if you if you understand you need help
[55:45] then you can try to find where to get
[55:47] help from amen if my car breaks down I
[55:50] don't go to the
[55:52] dentist amen if my car is not running
[55:56] I I don't I don't walk down to the uh
[56:00] podiatrist I take my car to a mechanic
[56:03] right
[56:05] amen and conversely I if I have a cavity
[56:09] I don't go to the
[56:11] mechanic what good would that do I go to
[56:15] the dentist I go to the place that's
[56:17] going to help but I have to first
[56:19] understand that I need help yeah once I
[56:21] know I need help then I can find where
[56:23] do I need to go for help right and
[56:25] that's we cry on the Lord Jesus say we
[56:28] know that there's nothing or nobody in
[56:29] no way that anything can be done to help
[56:32] me outside of him amen amen and when
[56:36] that acknowledgement comes and you
[56:37] recognize and you you ask him Lord amen
[56:41] that's where we come to the place of
[56:42] repentance these people don't even know
[56:44] they're in bondage they say we don't how
[56:46] how can we be in bondage we're Abraham
[56:48] seed how can you say that we need to be
[56:50] made free Jesus answered them 34th verse
[56:54] verily verily I say unto you whosoever
[56:57] committes sin is the servant of sin
[57:00] praise the Lord is the servant of sin
[57:05] and the servant abideth not in the house
[57:08] forever but the but the son abideth ever
[57:13] if the sun therefore shall make you free
[57:16] ye shall be free indeed free from what
[57:20] not a a physical shackle but the
[57:24] shackles of sin right the shackle of
[57:27] unbelief the shackle that holds still
[57:29] holds millions billions of people I
[57:33] could be so bold as to predict billions
[57:35] of people are held in this same shackle
[57:38] today they have not acknowledged that
[57:41] they are Shackled by sin that they're
[57:43] Shackled by unbelief that they need
[57:45] Liberty that they need to be made free
[57:48] yeah we think God we live in a nation
[57:52] that's a free Nation yes amen we live in
[57:54] a place that we have that freedom and so
[57:57] many people decide and and and choose to
[58:00] remain in bondage when the freedom is
[58:03] there that we can that we can uh enjoy
[58:07] and become a part of our Lives just to
[58:09] be free free to what free to Worship the
[58:12] Lord free to serve God God set us free
[58:15] so that we can worship him yes bondage
[58:19] is to be enslaved bondage is to be
[58:22] yolked and Shackled Shackled and yolked
[58:26] to sin to
[58:28] bondage and Jesus came and broke those
[58:31] bondage yes broke that
[58:34] yoke separated man from sin and yet
[58:37] people still decide to because we're all
[58:41] free moreal ages to stay in that in that
[58:44] sin in fact most people of course the
[58:48] Bible tells us actually St John that
[58:51] people like Darkness rather than light
[58:54] yeah they they want to remain in
[58:56] darkness yes because in darkness their
[58:58] evil Deeds are still hid it's the light
[59:02] that exposes the evil Deeds right and a
[59:05] person that recognizes I would rather be
[59:08] this way than that way I would rather
[59:10] stay in bondage and a lot of people
[59:12] would rather stay in bondage amen they'd
[59:15] rather stay in in a place where they
[59:17] feel like they can live however they
[59:18] want to
[59:19] live amen but as Sin tries to continue
[59:24] to take a whole over people's lives and
[59:28] will continue to try to manipulate our
[59:30] minds in the believing that let's just
[59:35] when do you realize or when when do you
[59:38] understand and I'll just use the word
[59:40] understand for lack of better
[59:42] verbage understand when something is
[59:45] under the
[59:47] blood when do you come to
[59:49] acknowledgement of
[59:51] recognizing that the sin committed the
[59:54] unbelief the things that been been done
[59:56] the things in our flesh or even in our
[59:59] old life were done when do we come to
[1:00:01] acknowledge when do we realize
[1:00:03] understand recognize in our lives that
[1:00:06] that is under the blood yes that that
[1:00:09] has been annihilated by the blood of
[1:00:12] Christ amen taken away from you never to
[1:00:15] be held against you again when do we
[1:00:18] understand when do we come to the uh the
[1:00:20] knowledge of understanding that every
[1:00:23] one of those things is under the blood
[1:00:25] of Christ yes and they're not held
[1:00:28] against me
[1:00:29] anymore how do you know
[1:00:32] that how can you come to an
[1:00:34] understanding of believing that I stand
[1:00:37] sinless before God that I am robed in
[1:00:40] the very righteousness of Jesus Christ
[1:00:42] how do you come to that understanding
[1:00:44] when can you come to that understanding
[1:00:47] is it just words we say or is it
[1:00:49] something we truly believe if it's
[1:00:51] something we truly believe you'll live
[1:00:53] like it you'll act like it you'll talk
[1:00:55] like it you life will exude the presence
[1:00:58] of Jesus Christ and recognition that he
[1:01:01] is in you living through you yes there's
[1:01:05] only one way you can believe it there's
[1:01:07] only one only one way you can understand
[1:01:09] it and that's by faith you know that by
[1:01:12] God's word God I have obeyed your word
[1:01:16] and in my heart not just something I
[1:01:19] said not just being dunked in a pool of
[1:01:22] water but in My Heart Lord I've obeyed
[1:01:25] your your word yes in my heart God now I
[1:01:30] know that if I've done what I've what I
[1:01:33] have been asked to do by Your Word my
[1:01:36] desire my heart that Lord you will do
[1:01:38] what you said you would
[1:01:40] do and you said that your blood will
[1:01:43] separate me from sin your blood
[1:01:46] Separates Me from unbelief now I trust
[1:01:49] that and I know that when I
[1:01:52] confess that all of that is under the
[1:01:55] blood done
[1:01:56] amen never to be held against you
[1:01:58] anymore yes amen never can be held to
[1:02:01] your account right amen erased
[1:02:05] completely gone from any existence of
[1:02:08] you have ever having done it in the
[1:02:11] first place that's what justification
[1:02:13] means not even there then
[1:02:18] Satan will come and try to make you feel
[1:02:21] like or tell you again you're guilty
[1:02:26] when you know you're
[1:02:28] not you have to believe by
[1:02:31] faith I confessed it I put it under the
[1:02:33] blood I ask God to forgive me I
[1:02:36] repented that Satan is on you now right
[1:02:41] amen and when God took it off of you and
[1:02:44] put it on him because it was that it was
[1:02:47] his to begin with he is the originator
[1:02:50] of it the father of Lies amen sin is a
[1:02:53] lie to tell a lie is a sin yeah amen
[1:02:56] he's the father of Lies which seems like
[1:02:59] anymore nobody even seems to care that
[1:03:01] they lie uh even even even when you can

[1:12:48] said oh why would you mock me like that
[1:12:51] amen and a lot of people feel the F do
[1:12:54] the same way oh I I I just I can't
[1:12:57] believe that Jesus would do something
[1:12:59] like that cuz you remembers like we've
[1:13:01] said there's no other religion on the
[1:13:03] planet that that has a leader who gave
[1:13:07] their own life and suffered and died and
[1:13:10] bled so that we could have freedom so
[1:13:14] that we could have salvation another
[1:13:16] word never used that you know of in in
[1:13:18] another religion about salvation who who
[1:13:21] knows to be saved now they just work on
[1:13:23] themselves to become better right uh uh
[1:13:26] Buddhist and all oh we just want to be
[1:13:28] better people well that's fine and good
[1:13:30] but you can't do it without the blood of
[1:13:32] Jesus Christ and you might become a
[1:13:33] better person that's not will take you
[1:13:35] into heaven that's not will give you
[1:13:37] eternal life praise the Lord and that
[1:13:40] man J said uh uh you're just trying to
[1:13:45] mock me you're just making fun of me I'm
[1:13:47] about to die tomorrow and you come and
[1:13:49] Forge present signature then just leave
[1:13:51] me alone let me die in peace he finally

[1:13:59] executed him and he said why was this
[1:14:02] man executed he was pardoned by the
[1:14:04] president of the United States so I
[1:14:05] tried to give him his pardon but he
[1:14:07] wouldn't accept it they come out and say
[1:14:09] well a pardon is not a pardon unless it
[1:14:12] is accepted as a pardon right amen it's
[1:14:15] only a pardon if you accept it as a
[1:14:17] pardon praise the Lord and thank God
[1:14:19] there was somebody that was going to
[1:14:21] live through eternity that would accept
[1:14:23] Jesus Christ's pardon or he would not
[1:14:25] have done it right amen friends I tell
[1:14:29] you I I personally believe if I was the
[1:14:31] only one down through the animals of
[1:14:33] time that was going to believe this
[1:14:35] truth and accept his salv his his
[1:14:38] sacrifice for my salvation he would have
[1:14:40] done it anyway just for me if there's no
[1:14:44] other human ever on the planet in the
[1:14:46] history of humanity was going to accept
[1:14:47] it and he knew I would he'd have done it
[1:14:49] anyway just for
[1:14:51] me billions may have turned him down
[1:14:54] billions May may not want to have
[1:14:55] anything to do with him but I knew that
[1:14:57] he knew that I would so he did it he did
[1:15:00] it for me you got to make it that
[1:15:03] personal if you really believe that
[1:15:05] Saints you got to make it that personal
[1:15:07] he did it for you yes amen Jesus signed
[1:15:11] your pardon now you can go free am now
[1:15:14] the anybody that accepts that pardon can
[1:15:17] go free but how many people reject that
[1:15:19] Parton oh I don't believe that or I
[1:15:22] don't see it like that or whatever their
[1:15:24] excuse is
[1:15:26] and they stay in
[1:15:27] bondage
[1:15:29] why people love Darkness rather than
[1:15:32] light yes amen praise the Lord let's
[1:15:35] continue
[1:15:37] on don't be entangled again with the
[1:15:39] Yoke of bondage behold I Paul say unto
[1:15:42] you that if you be circumcised Christ
[1:15:45] shall profit you nothing for I testify
[1:15:48] again to every man that is circumcised
[1:15:50] that he is a debor to do the whole law
[1:15:53] remember we've been just been talking
[1:15:55] about the law
[1:15:56] Grace if he does this he's he's if he he
[1:16:00] tries to obey the law he's a deor to the
[1:16:03] whole law you don't pick and choose your
[1:16:05] laws yes amen you don't say well I'm
[1:16:07] gonna I'm GNA do this and Obey this but
[1:16:10] I don't like that one so I'm not going
[1:16:12] to do that you know it's same way people
[1:16:14] cherry pick the scripture you I believe
[1:16:16] this part of the scripture I want to
[1:16:17] live this part uh that says that he will
[1:16:20] strengthen me but you know this part
[1:16:22] that says I need to obey uh I I'm not
[1:16:24] sure want to do that right this part
[1:16:27] that says oh he's my he's my uh my God
[1:16:30] and savior I'll take that yes I need a
[1:16:33] savior but this part about him being my
[1:16:35] Lord I I don't know if I really want him
[1:16:37] lording over me then you don't want him
[1:16:40] at all amen if you're going to take any
[1:16:43] part you take all part if you reject any
[1:16:46] part you reject them all amen amen de to
[1:16:50] do the whole law fourth verse Christ has
[1:16:52] become of no effect unto you whosoever
[1:16:55] of you are justified by the law ye are
[1:16:59] fallen from Grace if you're justified by
[1:17:02] the law because the law does not justify
[1:17:06] remember you cannot have relationship
[1:17:08] with Christ by the law the letter is not
[1:17:11] how we know God we know God by the
[1:17:14] spirit amen our relationship with him is
[1:17:17] by the spirit not by the letter praise
[1:17:20] the
[1:17:20] Lord for we through the spirit wait for
[1:17:24] the hope through what the spirit wait
[1:17:27] for the hope of righteousness by Faith
[1:17:30] by faith it's got to come by faith
[1:17:33] Saints for in Jesus Christ neither
[1:17:36] circumcision develops anything nor
[1:17:38] uncircumcision but Faith which worketh
[1:17:40] by love amen amen ye did run well who
[1:17:44] did hinder you that you should not obey
[1:17:47] the truth this persuasion cometh not of
[1:17:50] him that calleth you a little leav lenth
[1:17:53] the whole lump I have confidence
[1:17:54] confidence in you through the Lord that
[1:17:56] ye will be none otherwise minded but he
[1:17:59] that troubleth you shall bear his
[1:18:02] judgment whosoever he be and I Brethren
[1:18:06] if I preach circumcision why do I yet
[1:18:08] suffer
[1:18:09] persecution then it is the offense of
[1:18:12] the then is the offense of the Cross
[1:18:15] ceased I would they were even cut off
[1:18:18] which trouble you but see that that's
[1:18:22] not how we
[1:18:23] grow that that's not how we get strength
[1:18:27] amen uh a bodybuilder can can go to a
[1:18:33] gym and sit there and look at the
[1:18:35] weights all day long but that's not
[1:18:38] going to help him he's got to pick them
[1:18:40] up and use them he's got to work on they
[1:18:43] got to that there has to be a resistance
[1:18:46] against his muscle so the muscle builds
[1:18:49] there's got to be a resistance there so
[1:18:51] that your faith builds so that your
[1:18:54] trust in the Lord Lord so that your
[1:18:55] confidence so your walk it builds it
[1:18:57] gets stronger you get stronger see it
[1:19:01] says he said I would that they would be
[1:19:03] cut off to trouble you but it's the
[1:19:05] trouble the iron sharpeneth iron it's
[1:19:08] the trouble sometimes that grows the
[1:19:10] biggest muscles yeah that brings the
[1:19:13] best results that gets you the closest
[1:19:15] to God that puts us on our knees before
[1:19:18] the Lord amen amen for Brethren ye have
[1:19:22] been called unto Liberty

[1:19:52] lives in sin we take the Liberty and the
[1:19:55] freedom that God has given us so that we

[1:20:31] lives in me oh I I could live any way
[1:20:34] well I just don't want to amen we don't
[1:20:37] take the Liberty that God gave us to use
[1:20:39] it to sin to use it any way God's well
[1:20:42] God will forgive me well yeah he will
[1:20:46] but you don't take God's grace and make
[1:20:47] a disgrace out of it because then you
[1:20:49] cross you cross over that line that
[1:20:51] brother Ram talks about many times yes
[1:20:53] people crossing in that line and then

[1:21:01] I'm sorry but the scripture says there
[1:21:02] remaineth no more sacrifice for sin at
[1:21:05] that point right

[1:21:33] in her hand hi
[1:21:35] Parson said do I know you she said I was
[1:21:38] that girl was sitting down that you
[1:21:39] called on and said this could be my last
[1:21:40] chance she said you know what that was
[1:21:42] my last chance took a slug of that
[1:21:44] whiskey he said you ought to be ashamed
[1:21:45] of yourself he said Parson I could see
[1:21:47] my mama's soul frying in hell and it
[1:21:49] wouldn't bother me now that's a person
[1:21:52] who's crossed the line yes amen
[1:21:55] but he warned her that could have been
[1:21:57] her last chance and it was her last
[1:21:58] chance my mind do it would have get to
[1:22:02] that place but it does happen amen by
[1:22:06] love serve one another for all the law
[1:22:08] is fulfilled in one word even this Thou
[1:22:11] shalt there we go again there's that
[1:22:13] same Leviticus
[1:22:14] 1918 Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:22:18] thyself praise the Lord but if you bite
[1:22:21] devour one another take ye that you not
[1:22:23] consume one another another praise the
[1:22:26] Lord I believe in the in the in the
[1:22:29] patronage of our country there was a man
[1:22:32] that stood forth one time and said Give
[1:22:34] me liberty or give me death it was
[1:22:37] Patrick H amen Give me liberty or give
[1:22:41] me
[1:22:42] death he knew what it meant to have the
[1:22:44] liberty of the freedom to be able to
[1:22:48] live the way he wanted to by the
[1:22:50] dictates of his Lord and Savior not by
[1:22:53] another you're telling him as such right
[1:22:56] amen but by the dictates now God has set
[1:22:59] us free now what do we do with our
[1:23:00] freedom what are we doing with our
[1:23:03] liberties that God had gave us what are
[1:23:05] we doing with the freedoms that the Lord
[1:23:07] give us amen are we stomping over them
[1:23:10] we taking advantage of them are we
[1:23:12] appreciative of them or they become so
[1:23:14] common that we don't even it's just not
[1:23:16] even that important anymore amen needs
[1:23:20] to be something that we think about
[1:23:21] Saints unfortunately I'm afraid as far
[1:23:23] as this country concerned is probably
[1:23:25] the latter so many people today don't
[1:23:27] know what it's like don't know what it's
[1:23:29] about because they're so callous to it
[1:23:32] anymore yes to to have the freedoms that
[1:23:35] we have for the ones that served and
[1:23:38] gave their lives and died and bled and
[1:23:41] even just
[1:23:42] serve even if they live through it the
[1:23:44] service to be able to help this country
[1:23:47] Stay Free the way it is it's lost today
[1:23:51] a lot of in a lot of ways a lot of
[1:23:53] people a lot of young people it's lost
[1:23:55] they don't appreciate it it's not as
[1:23:57] important to them anymore because it's
[1:23:58] they become callous to it they they
[1:24:01] don't understand I'm sorry but a lot of
[1:24:03] times I get myself a little
[1:24:05] self-righteous indignation and I say why
[1:24:07] don't we just pick them up take them and
[1:24:09] drop them in the middle of North Korean
[1:24:10] they'll find out real quick what it's
[1:24:12] like to have the freedoms and liberties
[1:24:13] we have yes won't take them long at all
[1:24:16] amen they'll find out real quick praise
