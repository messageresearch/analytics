we serve a living Risen Savior he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not stuck in a cold grave somewhere amen he is risen he's alive he's the same today all other gods they're all decayed in their graves but the Lord Jesus rose from the grave conquered death Helen the great and it's Alive forevermore yes praise the Lord Jesus have a prayer of a couple prayer requests here um that I want us to remember was there any over there uh we want to remember uh want to remember I don't know if anybody wrote it down but we certainly want to remember those that were affected by the hurricane this week we actually had a working crew of one of our Newville Crews actually in Florida and the eye of the storm went right over them they're doing fine though they're okay they were more Inland they were they were kind of between Tampa and Orlando but the eye went right over and I'm sure those guys probably never experienced anything like that but for me and my family we've been through two or three of them but um I'm sure they never have but they're doing good but a lot of people lost their homes lost their lives uh got a testimony of course you know brother Roger Collins it's been over 40 years in Fort Myer has friends and I still have a good friend uh charismatic Minister back there got a good testimony from him in a little bit but um he said to please pray there's a lot of places down there they're not having church today a lot of places can't have church so let's remember those lost their homes lost their livelihoods even even they sent out something in Mr that said that we could help those people because they're not going to be able to work for a while because you just can't get around so please remember them in prayer mostly in Florida of course Southwest Florida some in Northeast and then of course South Carolina and North Carolina but from what I've heard most everything there is okay but certainly Fort Myer Sanibel Sanibel Island Fort Myer beach I don't know if you've seen pictures YouTube's whatever they just were basically wiped off they just don't exist anymore they're going to have to if they decide to I'm sure they will rebuild but it was really really bad our friend his name's Johnny uh the charismatic minister in Fort Myer he's North Fort Myers Church uh that brother Rogers been friends with many years and actually he I actually have ministered for him myself before uh when I was down there uh he said it was pretty bad uh I don't mean this to sound bad but just so you understand he said there were he said there were bodies floating in the water around so it was pretty bad so again please remember them in prayer that's very uh top-notch uh top of the list prayer requests I'm sure you have been but please remember that if you would sister Norma has a request please pray for my aunt and cousin who both have cancer Mark is very sick and cannot eat any cannot eat any longer my my Aunt Wanda still has cancer they uh they both have had chemo I guess chemotherapy yeah uh uh but it is apparently it's not working for Mark they need a miracle let's remember Mark Rwanda in prayer if you would today also Danny has prayer request here says on Thursday I was reading my Bible and all of a sudden I heard my neighbor upstairs start banging or it sounded like he was dropping things on the floor which you have heard sound doesn't make any sense especially him being an elderly man he has a tendency to do this even late at night he is not approachable and living in an upstairs apartment should be more considerate prayers that eventually I can live somewhere else so amen so Danny's asking the Lord would just provide a place for brother Danny another place to live don't mean to burst your bubble but it does not net grass isn't always greener on the other side when you're an apartment uh but the Lord knows and he can survive amen I know his sister Julie has had a just quite a battle uh with people around there and they're not supposed to be smoking in her apartment complex but they do comes into a patio in their apartment and uh it's it's it's pretty bad so please remember her in prayer too amen those are prayer requests that has anyone else have anything in your heart USS continue to remember my my stepdaughter Jill was really going through a lot and I know the Lord's dealing with her and she knows she's told her mom I know I need to get back to the Lord amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord very true that's remembered you in prayer and spoken request on your mind pray for me my flight is at 1 35 again so I'll be scooting out again pretty quick like I did last time but appreciate the prayers for the flights everything went great last time there and back on time and the flights were smooth and it was really nice so and I know your prayers make the difference so I appreciate that so if you would brother Dennis would you Lord Jesus will come before you and humility and yes Jesus and now with love in our hearts for you and one towards another Lord this is a sober hour of late hour unless you open up your word your revelation of of what's before us and and how to get ready for a rapture we are going to miss it it's not time father to live a life of the actor trying to be a Christian then you know you yeah present ourselves to be holy and righteous before one another but our hearts are far from you and you know our hearts father you know what it takes to be a Christian and that's our house Society that's why we're here this morning Father we're not here to be seen or to see one another but we're here to meet with you a living God a God of all power a God that can meet our needs according to your riches and Glory yes of God that can do the impossible a God that can heal cancer amen there's nothing that can stand before you greater he is in us than he is in the world if we put our faith together Lord May there be such a a wall of faith that no matter what we're dealing no matter what we present to to you you have come on the scene and met our needs yes Lord you have give us the desires of our heart you have seen us through the impossible you have given us a light at the end of the tunnel oh Lord help us to recognize it all right yes I remember your prophecy full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the Token yes the Lord is time to search our hearts to be more sincere than ever before if there's anything in our lives that goes against your word that's not your Holy Spirit living in us because father it takes one thing it's like James says he that keepeth the whole law and yet offense into one point he is guilty of all yes oh Lord we want you to live your lives in us we want to be we want to live the life where people can see that Jesus Christ is still alive he's still real he's still the same yesterday today and forever yes Lord give all the requests that's been read you know what they have need of We Know by faith that our prayers are answered you said delight yourself in the Lord you'll give us the desires of our heart and Lord that's our desire is to please you yes Lord stand with amen even when it seems like there's no answer uh father we know that you are our supplier of all our needs you're that righteous Tower where the uh the Strong Tower where the righteous run into it in our savings oh father bless each one as they raise their hands you know what they're reaching up thank you Lord grant them their hearts desire grant them their need father May the testimonies come forth that Lord you have met their needs yes Jesus as he brings forth your word use them to speak to our hearts oh Lord I want to be a better Christian I want a closer one up oh Lord that's that deep collar to the Deep for more of God knowing there's more of you to receive father and bless our pastor is he leaves for his flight be with him protect and give us safe Journeys father and use them to be a testimony for you father and let his job's job site and use our father we want to be uh a testimony I heard your Prophet this morning say how can we begin to receive the Gospel twice when there's people who haven't heard it for the first time oh Lord let us be a witness let us tell others that Jesus still saved yes still alive and he's still working amen people granted our in your name we pray in the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord Jesus you can be seated if you like brother Roger also told me uh testimony that our friend Johnny there uh that like I said the charismatic Minister there in Fort Myer him and his wife were living they live in Fort Myers of course North Fort Myer and he said the water was coming up to their house and it was starting to come up to the stoop and they were praying and praying and praying and nothing changed the water just kept coming and kept coming they kept praying kept praying nothing changed drop right up to the door and he said honey let's just let's just lift our hands and start worshiping god let's just lift our hands and start thanking him and praising him and he said as soon as they started doing that the water started going back down he said it was the only house in their neighborhood that didn't happen have two feet of water in the living room only house amen praise the Lord sometimes it just you just stop and take a moment you know we get so focused on the prayer part of it if we forget about the worship part of it and the thankfulness of it and I thought my that's such a great lesson you know you just keep praying and keep praying and just kept getting worse and worse but then they just thank God and it stopped started going back in the only house it was like that I said that's a wonderful testimony I want to tell that so praise the Lord God is good isn't he is a man praise the Lord listing his course here man it's number 469 in the book we have on the screen here amen wherever I go I'll praise Him amen I thought that was so appropriate that he called me about that I think it was yesterday he called me about that testimony and I thought I had already had this song it was the last song here to wherever I go I'll praise Him amen praise the Lord wherever I go I'll praise him whenever Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] if I could see I'll praise the name of Jesus for the names of Jesus thanks let's sing it again [Music] I'll praise you for his love surrounds me like a cease [Music] of Jesus Christ [Music] of Jesus for the days foreign [Music] [Music] amen hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus amen thank you Jesus glory to his name Hallelujah Wherever I Go Saints amen I'm going to praise him I'm gonna lift his name I'm Gonna Worship Him even if it's in the middle of Walmart I might not lift my voice or my hands but my life in front of all those people will praise the Lord Jesus amen just the mere presence of you being there will praise the Lord in front of all those people now if you ask me to I would if the spirit moved on me wouldn't be the first time amen I worship him in the middle of my uh a store in my car or somewhere amen he acknowledges it wherever we go praise the Lord Jesus whenever I just want the present of God and seem to get into there I learned that if you'll just worship Him amen just worship him and that brings it yes and wipes away all that Melancholy wipes away all that jazz can't dress in I can't feel God if you're alone it just wipes it all away and voila you're there praise the Lord amen that says a lot doesn't it yes amen amen praise the Lord I know we say it a lot but friends it's just the truth you've got to believe that exercise it he inhabits the praise of his people amen not just here wherever you go amen he didn't have the praise of his people praise the Lord Jesus amen let's get into our feet if we could we're going to turn in our Bibles Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 will continue with the thought we've had and then recently enjoyed further Noel last week Lord willing he's traveling this week in Arizona and ministering different places he'll be back with us on the 16th so looking forward to that amen this morning it caused my lights Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and 2. again what we do let's just buy our heads for another word of Prayer Precious Jesus father we're again so thankful Lord just to feel your presence Lord to know that you're real God I know you inhabit the praise of your people I know so many times like sister but he said it just takes a little effort on our part just to raise our hands just to lift our voices just to make a movement of praise to you Lord God in our hearts that so desire to love you to praise you to worship you we're so thankful God because you're so good to us yes there's nothing that we could ever do there's not enough that we could ever do in this life even begin to thank you and to show you how much we appreciate Lord all that you've done for us you're doing for us knowing what you're going to do you're just so good to us we thank you Father Lord we know that many times things happen we don't understand but God you have your hand upon it and you make everything work together for our good because we love you Lord we love you we thank you for this church service we thank you for this Sanctuary for this place you give us for this time set aside God to come in from the out of the world Lord that you might speak to us and meet with us and Lord speak to us now in power and demonstration of your spirit let your word go forth heal those that are sick in body yes may the miraculous the Miracles may they be done today God just because you visited with us father if you don't visit with us this visit will be in vain but I know that you already here feeling you and knowing you to be the same today take complete control now this body this voice this mind speak through these lips what should have to be heard here through our ears which would have to be accomplished in each one of us today as we walk just that one step at a time that one day at a time that you give us Lord we give you thanks and praise for it Lord blessings that have come bless those who may be streaming today all the requests all the needs Lord we just commit them to you remaining part of the service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness upon the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters could be seated if you like go with me again also over back to Leviticus chapter 23. Lord willing try to finish up today that Feast of atonement day of atonement Feast of atonement that we have here uh chapter 23 beginning with verse 26 that day of atonement that we know contains within it the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's Vision to Daniel which will also speak on but we went through the first three of the six there we want to finish up that last three today with the help of the Lord now Leviticus chapter 23 verse 26 and the Lord's speaking of Moses saying also on the 10th day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement it shall be in holy convocation unto you and ye shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord remember again it's the day of atonement to atone to make right the wrongs that had been done so to atone for something is to make something wrong right an apology does it things like that that make the wrong right that's why now in this and only this Feast are they afflicting their souls see um and ye shall do no uh no work in that day for it is a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God for whatsoever Soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from among his people and whatsoever sold it be that doeth any work in that same day the same soul will I destroy from among his people you shall do no manner of work it shall be a statute forever throughout your Generations in all your dwellings it shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest you shall afflict your souls in the ninth day of the month that even uh from even unto even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath amen now let's go over to Daniel uh where we left off the last time of looking at Gabriel's six-fold Vision to Daniel in Daniel chapter 9. verse 24 which contains each of the six full purpose now as we get to this it was something that came on my heart the other day that we need to look for Saints because uh things are getting close um you know there's a lot of disturbance going on and there's a lot of distraction there's a lot of distraction in this country but there's some very significant international events taking place we know that economically uh there's a country trying to take over the United States trying to take over the world China is trying to take over the world they're doing a pretty good job of it too and including this country but my mind in all that rhetoric goes right back to what brother Branham said brother random said what watch Russia didn't say China talked about China but they but the but the prophecy that came forth was watch Russia see so then my eyes tend to go away from that back over to there you know this week this week a development took place where the North Street pipeline going underneath the one of the Seas I forgot what it was uh suffered a an eruption uh it was well for lack of better terminology it apparently was destroyed uh somebody detonated a bomb or something and blew a part of the pipeline up so now all of that natural gas is coming out you can see it they showed on if you look at YouTube or you can look it up online you see this all that gas is bubbling up now in a big huge circle it's it's huge uh that's coming up uh some people are saying Putin did it some people are saying the United States did but because of this in the past couple of weeks Putin has amassed seven bomber jets that are capable of carrying nuclear warheads close to either Ukraine so when I hear watch Russia and I see these things happening and I know what the destruction of this country is coming to it perks me up a little bit I just wanted to let you know uh this this thing is real it is at the door it's coming to a head yes and I think very quickly we think oh there's the Skirmish Russian Ukraine and blah blah blah we're fine and we're you know we're paying ten dollars per gallon of gas that's probably more of Biden's world uh fossil fuels than anything but um you know people we don't don't think a whole lot about it but when things like this happen it perks me up because I know what a prophet said and when I make that and bring that together uh it it it it brings to my heart a dire warning that I've given to you uh and not a warning in so much that uh uh you know we're looking it we're that's ushering with us you're in the time that we're looking for because when when the wrong man's in office which very well could be when that man pushes that button which is very well could be um it's going to be done because the bride is going to be gone before that happens yes we still got a California going under uh it's just right here saying so I'm just I'm just telling you of things that the Lord has put on my heart to tell you uh it's very close if anybody's gonna drop a bomb or bombs on this country to border the Border Coast to Coast it's not going to be China it's going to be Russia and if Russia in any way it Putin I mean he's such a prideful guy he I mean even if his army gets beat to a pulp he'll keep sending them in he doesn't care he'll keep saying we're annexing parts of Ukraine when they're running for their lives because he's just that prideful and if he knew or if it come out in intelligence that we blew up that Pipeline and destroyed his part of his uh cash flow uh I wouldn't put it past him right my point is not to scare you but to realize we're close friends in my opinion we're just that close so yeah amen be ready that's the main thing be ready be ready at any time now Daniel uh we've gone back to Daniel chapter nine we want to go over the last three of the six-fold meaning purpose of Gabriel's Vision visit to Daniel so in the 24th verse let's just read it again Daniel 9 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city now notice we talked about that last time and you can read on down you find out where it gets cut off the Messiah gets cut off to the middle and the the last three and a half of the 70 of Revelation 11 Revelation 12 so many places it talks about that three and a half years of tribulation time uh but this is determined upon his people for this six-fold purpose to finish the transgression now you remember what that was that was the blindness in part to Israel Amen to finish that transgression to lift the scales to make an end of sin what was the sin sin is unbelief they didn't believe their Messiah right when this is to come Christ and they realize once the transgression is done the blindness is removed they realize who he is then the sin will be done away because they'll believe they're Messiah they'll know who he is they say we uh he said like we read last time where'd you get those scars in the house of my friends they realized what they did to their Messiah make an end of sin end of unbelief to make reconciliation to reconcile for the iniquity that was done and remember the iniquity uh they they recognized Christ the iniquity was doing something they should not have done and when they cried let his blood be on us and our children it has been ever since but there's going to be an end to that amen when God is he's lifting off the Gentile bride he's still moving though he's still moving amongst us but when it's fully gone and over on the Jews the bride goes to the marriage supper God will deal with them in that way all of these will be removed from the Jews because they're still his people amen now we'll get to the I'll read the rest of it but then that's where we ended off last time making reconciliation for iniquity to bring in Everlasting righteousness well that sounds good just to hear it amen Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy to anoint the most holy which puts us where we're going at the end of this series The Most Holy being the New Jerusalem amen now let's go back to uh that bring in Everlasting righteousness that's number four of the sixth part number four bring in Everlasting righteousness now obviously righteousness is a state of how things should be now not things how they should be in my eyes or your eyes or what the government says or what any person says but righteousness is the things that should be in their ought to be conditioned according to God in his eyes not ours so if we look at righteousness of something as saying well it's something that I meet a standard that I made well that's not righteousness but if you meet the standard that God made which by his blood we can then you become in your ought to be conditioned as God saw you from before the foundation of the world in his own mind just like brother Noah was preaching to us last week we talked and and recognized that thought of God that thought of God that God knew you before you were ever formed God knew you before this world was ever come into existence God knew you because you were part of him you were in his mind amen the intellectual property as I've said so many times you know in this country when you write something down or you write a book or you make a song or or music or something if that becomes your intellectual property because it's something that was an original fault of yours or an original song or or some kind of original music or note I know that there's even been groups that have sued other people because they came up with perceived presumably a Ken note rhythm that that it was a part of their song Whatever It Is uh just like a ten note Rhythm and somebody come with that 10 note Rhythm or something in their song without permission that person or that group that came up with that can sue those people and say they stole this song from us or the lyrics or something like that that's why we have to have copyrights for a lot of the songs that we've seen here that we run Micah does that of course we get the copier we have to have a copyright license to sing some of these songs because now some of them belong to public that we don't have to that anybody can sing at any time but to do it right and it's streaming and to do it uh legally we have to pay uh certain rights to be able to sing certain songs because if we sing certain songs that we don't have rights to that uh that the originator that song hears and we sing it without his permission we can be sued for that so it's in this country uh now why a person would do that for the Lord and not make it public I don't know but that's that's another thing but you understand it came from their mind it was something that originated thoughts that originated from their mind well that's just exactly who we are we are the thoughts that come originated from God's mind we are the intellectual property of God the thoughts of God made manifest amen so in that place and we come into a sin body into the world but in God's Mind through God's eyes to be righteous by the blood of Jesus Christ puts us back in that position that's what righteousness is in its ought to be conditioned when God created the Garden of Eden it was exactly the way he wanted to be when he put Adam here it was exactly the way he wanted to be when he took Eve out of Adam it was exactly the way God wanted to be until sin came and entered into God that's when it fell that's when it that's when it left its righteous place and felt below a righteous standard it was no longer in the position it was supposed to be in and then it's gone on ever since we come into this world just like that shaped and iniquity come the world speaking lines amen because of our because of our uh uh Mom and Daddy Eve Adam and Eve see so we didn't do it but we came into it but God sent Jesus with his blood to redeem us that we wouldn't have to be in that Fallen condition so we again through his blood could come and be in that righteous position that God saw us in before the foundation of the world to put it back in its ought to be conditioned so when he's talking about to Institute an everlasting righteousness it means that it's going to be a righteousness that is unwavering or unending an everlasting righteousness so we are going to a place and he is taking us his bride and his children the Jew to that place where it will be in his perfect ought to be conditioned continually no more Fallen nature no more sin no more unbelief it'll be Everlasting in its perfect place that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world Everlasting it institutes that Everlasting righteousness now we as the Gentiles have already entered into that because we believe Christ we believe and accept the blood that he shed for us and made that atonement for us but they did it so there has to be an everlasting righteousness come in for them so that they can receive the same thing that we know and have today so it enters into that Everlasting righteousness now a couple of uh scriptures I want to read uh to back this Revelation chapter 20. Revelation chapter 20. and we know for the fall of the Garden of Eden we know even from heaven go to revelation 12. we even know even from heaven when Lucifer deceived a third of the angels in heaven to believe his life and was cast down on Earth began there not just here it began there Satan the devil Revelation chapter 20. so the only way to Institute that is to get rid of the unbelief to get rid of the sin Revelation 20 verse 1 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years so we can know that if that origination of sin Satan who is the author uh and finisher he's the the father of Lies I should say he's the father of life that from him was the beginning or the instituting of the falling from a righteous condition so now if he will be bound a thousand years and brother Brown tells us he will be bound because there'll be no subjects for him to work in right he'll be bound for a thousand years then they're they're that Millennium time then can be considered a place of righteousness right a place that will be as it ought to be amen actually brother random said all wrongs that have been done on here will be made right there right amen all wrongs will be made right why because it's exactly the way God intended it to be from the fall in the Garden of Eden till today it'll be rewrite a thousand years cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more praise God but now he's got a little wrinkle here till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed for a little season now later on in this study I I I will probably I believe this to the the place of discussing this and more in depth so I won't do it today and I would be honest with you this this puzzled me for the longest time but that Satan would be loosed after the Millennium Satan will be loosed for a little season after the Millennium or at the end of the millennium for a little season you'll be loose um let me just well I'll leave it there but I want to talk about because that what that's what brings in Gog and Magog and of course god reigns fire and brimstone and destroys all the come up against the children of God and then the white Throne judgment but he's loose but for that thousand years my point here is that for that thousand years there will be that place that state of Purity Holiness righteousness and it's ought to be conditioned amen no more aches and pains uh no more eyeglasses uh no more dentists and doctors and uh pediatricians no no more ambulances no more Sirens no more police uh no more guns no more killing no more grades it'll be in it's ought to be perfect righteous condition and I think that people in this world today say oh that's not going to be fun I said that's going to be the best place ever to be who it who in their right mind was not want to dwell in a place like that right amen you enjoy hearing gunshots you enjoy having ambulances and going to the hospital and worrying about sickness and having to pay for insurance and you you enjoy hearing about these floods and people dying is that something you enjoy does that sound like fun no there's going to be a place of righteousness yes that God institutes that's perfect amen praise the Lord now after that thousand years he's loosed but then look what happens we can read on but let's go down to verse 10. after the end of Gog and Magog the white Throne judgment the devil verse 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the Beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever amen Everlasting righteousness the whole point of this wasn't focused we weren't we the whole point of this series wasn't focusing on the Millennium the whole point of this series is focusing on the new city the New Jerusalem that City come down adorned as a bride for a husband that's the focus and that Focus brings us to that to an everlasting righteousness after sin the lies the degradation all that Satan brings deception is thrown into the Lake of Fire amen the false prophet the Beast with him and to be tormented day and night forever and ever praise God well that's that that's God's doing to do that but the bride will be in that place of righteousness Holiness Everlasting righteousness let's think of what habakkuk says in habakkuk chapter 2. now it's also uh in Isaiah 11 9 says a lot the same way Isaiah 11 9 but we're going to go to habakkuk we hardly ever go to habakkuk so I found the opportunity so verse 2 or chapter 2 verse 14. habakkuk 214 again you can find this saying in in Isaiah 11 9. but let's look it's a little different but it's basically says the same thing and by this scripture you'll understand why I had the first why the Lord put the first song We sang on my heart today for the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of what the glory of the Lord not just the knowledge of the Lord but a knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters covered the sea amen the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord Everlasting righteousness praise the Lord that's what God brings in for this fifth of this fourth part of that six-fold purpose now bringing in Everlasting righteousness sailing away Satan amen which is the Satan is the unbelief sealing Satan awake not just in the Thousand Years but also in that Lake of Fire forever and ever very much praise the Lord Everlasting righteous now the fifth one the fifth one is to seal up the vision and prophecy seal up the vision and prophecy that's the fifth one now a seal as we probably already know is denotes a finished work I I got a couple of quotes I could read here uh I I can just read them real quick uh a seal something that you seal up uh mothers wives uh well probably maybe all of us at this point you ever use Saran Wrap or something to its equivalent and you you take a bowl of something you want to stay fresher and you know it's not going to stay fresh fresh because there's air in already but you take it and you seal that you put that saran wrap and you seal it up you seal it to do what now this is mine and we know it's a finished work a seal actually a sealed denotes several different things it can do no ownership we know brother Ram talked about the seal that was put on the railroad car that was ownership when that seal was put on that that railroad car was inspected and it was found to be right and a seal was put on it it meant that that plate that seal said that that cart was inspected it was found to be perfect and it's the ownership of this company so it does denote ownership it denotes a finished work it's a seal because what's inside is perfect amen it's a seal it also denotes uh that finished work it also um uh it also denotes a protection which is kind of what I was getting to with the Saran Wrap you try to protect food with with Saran Wrap you seal it so it's protected I've seen uh these gadgets they have where you can put a piece of meat between two things and you run it through this machine or something it just sucks all the air out or something it seals that uh that right around the meat and all it takes all the air and everything out of it's supposed to keep the meat fresher longer you can freeze it and it'll be just like new it it isn't but it's supposed to be just like new they put that a sealant in there is to protect it so a seal is also protection that's what I've got for this now Beyond honestly and I'll let you know this before I started most of this since you've if you have gone and listened to Gabriel's six-fold Vision to Daniel that brother Brown spoke on uh a lot of what I have here there's some exceptions that the Lord's give me in studying it but a lot of that came from that message and and Daniel's 70 weeks so and others but that's the main place but he doesn't talk a whole lot about the seal up the vision and prophecy and it was it was kind of a a something that was a state of sort of a state of confusion to me I actually when I got to this the other this is a month or so ago and I sat at my desk and I sat back and I said Lord what do I say about this it just it just didn't ring with me I I just I needed some more help and I asked the Lord and then and you know nothing came right away and I read some more and I studied some more and I skipped over it and and I come back and and all of a sudden the Lord dropped to me that the significance of the seal the significance and importance of the Seal of a seal not just that seal but a seal and then it just became clear uh a seal is has the various meanings to it purposes to it but this one more than anything to me was this seal was for protection now I I read these quotes in the breach he said um he said while the scriptures are open the Holy Spirit here itself the Holy Spirit itself is a seal the holy spirit is a seal the holy spirit is a seal a seal signifies what a finished work amen which is true right that is true a finished work the holy spirit being a seal to the individual now in the seventh seal oddly enough the seventh seal uh brother man talks about uh Adventist brother the Seal of God is keeping the Sabbath day he said you know that but I want uh one Speck of scripture on it to show that the sabbaths are keeping the Sabbath is the Seal of God but if you read Ephesians 4 which we'll go to in a moment it says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of your Redemption yes sir when that meditorial work is done and you are come Christ comes to redeem his own you are sealed not till the next revelation Revival when you're once sealed with the Holy Ghost it's a finished work that God has received you and there's no getting away from it God has received you sealed his spirit in there finished work but it's also a protection and that's the thing that God Ran true to me or rang true to me look here Daniel chapter 12 would probably may have been a Daniel there but Daniel chapter 12 it speaks of Daniel 12 Revelation 10 will go to you can also look at uh as you're looking at Daniel 12 uh the the the the the Seal of circumcision that God gave to Abraham what was the purpose of the Seal of circumcision it was considered a seal a circumcision a something that God was instructing him to do that denoted that the work had been done the work had been completed the obedience to God had been done amen obedience that's what God looks for saying he's looking for The Obedience he wants obedience from his children and this was this this was this seal was a seal that God gave Abraham as as a sign the work had been completed the the uh the uh the promise was in effect amen that God had given them the promise was in effect but now Daniel chapter 12 look at this Daniel 12 4. but thou old Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased So Daniel saw something or was interested in something that God said seal up because it's not time well what would that what was that seal to do if it was to protect that vision and prophecy for becoming known to those that it should not be made known to it was also to protect its entirety for the time frame of when it was supposed to be revealed to God's people amen so it was a protection the sealed it wasn't necessary well it is a finished work because God's work is a finished work is just unfolding itself God's just playing it out in his mind it is a finished work but we know that that was to continue to unfold itself even to the day that we live so to say it was finished that God was no longer going to deal with it was not accurate but it was to protect God was protecting his word amen from those who weren't supposed to get a hold of it just like the uh just like the the the garters of the Matthew Mark Luke and John guarding the way to the to the to the truth there was there was a seal that was to protect it from getting to and also again the Integrity of it to keep it from coming before its time was to be amen it was for according to God to Daniel it was for the time of the end now my question to you this morning Dennis when is that time when is the time of the end I believe it's now yes I believe a prophet has come to bring that word that has been unsealed to show to this bride who she is in the day that she lives it's also exposing the enemy yes so that we recognize the enemy and all of its tactics all the way down through from the beginning of time down through the church ages amen so it was to bring for a time of the end that we are now many shall run to and fro knowledge shall increase knowledge man's knowledge not God's knowledge then I Daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on this side of the bank at the river the other on the other side of the bank of the river one said to the man clothed in linen oh which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders and I heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto Heaven swear by him that liveth forever that he shall be for a Time Time a times and a half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the Holy people all these things shall be finished and I heard but I understood not why did he understand not he heard it but he didn't understand it why then said I O My Lord what shall be the the end of these things and God reminds him he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up that's why you don't see it that's why you can't write it that's why you can't tell it because it's sealed go your way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end right it wasn't for you to know right now he saw it but he didn't understand it people read the sixth chapter of Revelations all the time but do they understand it right no it took a profit for this last day to come and God revealed to him to preach to a bride what that six what those seven seals are yes and what they mean to us because it was time look at Revelation now Revelation chapter 10. Revelation chapter 10 I'll skip the first three well we'll just go first verse Revelation 10 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud the rainbow is upon his head his faces as it were the Sun the fetus pillars of Fire he had it in his hand a little book open and he said his right his right foot upon the sea is left foot upon the Earth and he cried with the loud voices when a lion roared and when he had tried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write the seven Thunders uttered and John was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven Thunders uttered and write them not it wasn't even for John the revelator's time yes but it was for today yes it was for the end and this is the end it wasn't for Daniel it wasn't for John it was for a prophet William Brown to bring to a bride for this last day yes now it has been open it was protected All Through the Ages and generations yes God sealed it and protected it even from this time with John sealed and protected it was kept so that it could be brought fresh that a bride could receive it for this last day yes and that the revelation of that could enter into the heart of the People by the Holy Spirit through the words that were spoken so that it would be in our hearts a truth of God's word yes truth of God's word that seal protected it so when he says it will seal up the vision and the prophecy it's a finished work yes and it's a protection amen that seal is a protection amen that God had give for the Jews at that time so in this end time that they can receive what we receive they can know they are going to know what we know the message Jesus Christ amen the Messiah Jesus Christ God in flesh Jesus the Jews already believed that their Messiah is going to be God In the Flesh they already say that they just missed him Christ Jesus Christ being that Messiah they are like a lot of Gentiles who believe there's two of two Gods three Gods whatever they want to conjure in their mind uh Trinity or something like that but there's only one God and he was veiled in flesh when he come in the body of the Corporal body of Jesus Christ it manifests himself to the world we see it we know who he is they didn't they will amen they will praise the Lord last one last one number six the last one was to anoint the most holy to anoint the most holy now to anoint uh simply means to immerse or baptize or smear it also means to consecrate you know anointing also means to consecrate let's go over to um Leviticus chapter 8. see if I had a figure Leviticus chapter 8. it's also to consecrate now to anoint as I've said before is to baptize or to smear a liquid on or to immerse in amen that's what anoint means to baptize to consecration that's why when people talk of baptism of the Holy Ghost I understand what they're talking about but the word baptized actually only means to be immersed I'm not looking to Simply Be immersed in his spirit I want the indwelling presence of Jesus Christ himself to live in me not just immerse in it yes not just baptize or anointed in it there's a lot of people around the world today that are anointed of the Holy Ghost but there are very few people around the world who are born again and have the spirit of the literal Life of Christ Living in them that's the Holy Spirit that's the new birth amen that's where you have to be if you want to go in a Rapture a simple anointing is not going to do it a simple baptism is not going to do it that's why being baptized in water does not save you yes because it's simply an immersion amen and when you break it down to recognize what it means and brother Branham took especially in the early part of his ministry and he talked about the baptism of the Holy Ghost from the Pentecostals was not the reference he was talking about from the 63 on he talked about not just a simple baptism but the indwelling presence of the Life of Christ in you not simply immersed in that not just simply baptized in it but Christ in you the hope of glory yes that's the new birth the new birth isn't an anointing the new birth is in the baptism the new birth is the dwelling the indwelling presence of the Life of Christ in you yes amen that seal was put on your soul I skipped that scripture I didn't read uh Ephesians 1 13-14 if you want to go back that that seal of the Holy Spirit God seals that Holy Spirit in there not a baptism that's not an anointing it is a consecration but it's ownership yes it means that he now accepted you and owned you as his own that's what the new birth is being born again and the Soul not just the flesh not even just the spirit but in this but in the soul but now look to anoint the most holy now the most whole let's just talk about the most holy before we get to the anointing God the most holy that we talk about look in the scripture the holy city is Jerusalem that's the holy city the holy city of Jerusalem the most holy is that City that's not the of the of the Earthly City that we know today but the New Jerusalem that God's going to set up yes that God that that City that we that we're eventually getting to Revelation 21 that new city that comes down on that pyramid-shaped mountain that's that new city the holy city the New Jerusalem that New Jerusalem is that most holy that new Tabernacle that anointing consecration of that new Tabernacle now let's look to anoint the most holy Leviticus 8. to anoint the most holy look here now and Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that there was therein and Sanctified them consecrated them and he sprinkled there and we know what the anointing World represents of course that's the Holy Spirit uh an annoying to the Tabernacle all that was Darien and Sanctified them consecrated them and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and Anointed The Altar in all his vessels both the labor and his foot to sanctify them and he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him praise the Lord it was to sanctify consecrate him what was to pour that anointing oil the representation of the Holy Spirit Christ to pour out upon his people and he poured it out upon Abraham it wasn't a time of the indwelling presence because Christ did not come so the only thing that they could do to consecrate this ministry was to pour that representative of the or of the holy spirit that anointing oil on Abraham or on Aaron to anoint him and to consecrate him praise the Lord so when this anointing of the most holy is supposed to take place is to be a consecration remember Everlasting righteousness has entered in because Satan's sin deception is all done away with and there's there's an inner and of everlasting righteousness and an and a consecration of that City that we're going to live in amen now you say how long I don't know that's up to God the Bible does not say in fact there's very little said about that new city in the scripture very little there is scripture about it but there's very little but it's but the consecration of that City the consecration of the place that we're going to live where God Jesus himself the lamb will be the light of that City it'll be positioned so that there won't be a shade spot on the entire city day and night praise the Lord amen consecration now one more I kind of just gave it away but let me uh Revelation chapter 21. I will close with this to anoint the most holy Revelation 21 22 and 23. now remember this is that City it describes Revelation 21 describes that City it says I Revelation 21 1 said I saw a new Heaven and new earth first Heaven the first search were passed away there were no more sea I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride a door for her husband yes praise the Lord there's an anointing a constant crating of that City that New Jerusalem that we're all going to live in look here uh verse 22 now and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it now when there was consecration before the consecration was for the Tabernacle in the wilderness the temple the place where they met God that was to be the consecration the consecration of this place is the fact that there is no Temple there's not a Tabernacle in the wilderness because God the lamb and almighty God are the Temple of this the anointing of it is God himself there is no representation there is no substitute there is no natural typing the spiritual it is God himself that is now the Temple of this city praise the Lord the consecration of this city the New Jerusalem God himself amen it's not figurative front and Saints amen we're talking about the literal the literal thing and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is and the lamb is the light thereof praise the Lord a consecrated City amen a place that God's children are going to live this holy place this place of everlasting righteousness we'll get into it later but outside that said that City's walled and outside the city there's workers and they bring in they bring in the uh the leaves for the healing of the Nations into this city this city that has no need of the light of the Sun or the moon this this city that is consecrated anointed and not just anointed of a person a viewer I Moses isn't going to anoint it William branham's not going to anoint it it's not going to be oil it's going to be God himself yes the anointing of it is God himself yes the consecrating of it is God himself amen yes not a representation God himself yes praise the Lord so when he's anointing the most holy that City it's amen he comes into his kingdom he with his kingdom in his kingdom with his subjects you and I there'll be streets of transparent gold there'll be fruits on trees one every month the water the spring is running down from the top oh my it's going to be beautiful Saints amen looking forward to it and the number one thing will be with our loved ones in a place of un uh Everlasting righteousness amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could thank the Lord I know it's a little shorter today but I didn't really expect the last three to take as much time but when you start thinking about it when you recognize and look around you what's going on and what God's not just for the Gentile bride yes but how beautiful it is the types of the of what God has shown to the Jews doing for them that he's already done for us amen praise the Lord by his Spirit by his life in the literal City living in you has in you produce where we're going Amen in you already now and I don't believe it's that far off since I believe we're right here yes it's at the door yes amen are you ready yes you know you didn't have to exhort I appreciate that but that's that's that's an admiration an admonition of soul searching on your behalf yeah you mean that's a sincere question from me to you are you ready yes amen again the admonition is great but amen make sure you know where you stand with the Lord Jesus because that's all that matters today's things amen praise the Lord when I was growing
