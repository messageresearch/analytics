[33:31] the Lord by his Spirit Divine thank you
[33:34] Lord Jesus amen buddy would you mind
[33:36] checking to see there prayer requests
[33:40] amen as you notice we have a few missing
[33:44] today
[33:47] little Gabriel fell yesterday and broke
[33:49] his leg
[33:51] no thank you buddy
[33:54] um
[33:54] talked to shry last night he uh I guess
[33:58] apparently jumped off the trampoline and
[34:00] as boys do a thousand times in their
[34:03] lives uh you know and kind of stumble
[34:06] fell down and he went to get back up to
[34:09] take off again like most boys do and of
[34:12] course Gabriel and he fell right back
[34:14] down and his leg was hurting so they
[34:17] took him to the doctor and found out
[34:20] Urgent Care found out they did an x-ray
[34:22] that is tibia is broken it looked like
[34:24] by the X-ray to me it looked like it was
[34:27] broken two places
[34:28] it's what it looked like to me uh the
[34:31] police break for him down a little lower
[34:33] here uh on his shin bone and it's it
[34:37] looks like a pretty clean break but and
[34:40] his pain has been so severe he finally
[34:43] got to go to sleep around midnight last
[34:45] night
[34:46] she's just been given some Motrin
[34:48] Children's Tylenol and it just hasn't
[34:50] helped manage the pain very well so they
[34:52] took him to the ER the children's ER I'm
[34:55] assuming at Banner because that's the
[34:57] only Children's Hospital I know in town
[34:58] is Banner on Campbell so I'm assuming
[35:03] that's where they went because his pain
[35:04] was just so bad and they were going to
[35:06] try to take care of him there and uh
[35:09] they're they will be able to put a cast
[35:11] on him there they couldn't do it where
[35:13] they took him last night they put a
[35:15] splint on and was going to get a cast in
[35:17] the next couple days but now that
[35:20] they're down there they'll probably go
[35:21] ahead and set it and put the cast on
[35:24] everything so but of course please pray
[35:27] for little Gabriel uh I'll that I don't
[35:30] know that that boy is going to go crazy
[35:33] he's he's not one to sit around so he's
[35:38] gonna have a a tough time with this one
[35:40] I can imagine he's probably going to be
[35:42] pretty active in that cast that school's
[35:45] getting ready to start and everything so
[35:47] please pray for little Gabriel you needs
[35:49] needs a touch from the Lord right now
[35:51] amen and of course to make sure that's
[35:54] the doctors and everything heals
[35:56] perfectly doctor can set a place where
[35:58] the brand told us right doctor can set a
[36:00] place but it takes God to do the healing
[36:02] yeah praise the Lord so we believe that
[36:05] the Lord will just touch him also school
[36:07] is starting coming up I don't think I
[36:10] don't know when their school school
[36:11] starts at different times I know Joel
[36:14] and Emma starting school this year
[36:16] starts
[36:17] on the 9th I believe is that right
[36:21] so just remember that prayer I had
[36:24] written it down and I thought well we
[36:25] could say this next Sunday so Lord
[36:28] willing next Sunday we'll have Gabriel
[36:29] and Alice back with us and and uh you
[36:32] fellas if y'all go to school and I want
[36:36] to lay hands on all the school kids
[36:38] to come up next Sunday and pray over you
[36:41] all because it's a tough situation even
[36:43] though my grandchildren home school it's
[36:46] still uh it's still a struggle and uh
[36:49] public school or anything like that it's
[36:52] Spirits out there is just just
[36:54] tremendous so I want to lay hands and
[36:56] pray for them but just keep them in in
[36:58] your prayers too with that school

[42:50] ones the following them again the rock
[42:52] that followed them that gave him water
[42:54] yes
[42:59] see that parted they let him cross on
[43:02] dry land thank you Jesus we have so many
[43:05] miracles father and yet we can read in
[43:09] the scriptures where Joshua and Caleb
[43:13] crossed over and that the children that
[43:16] grew up in the wilderness and finally
[43:19] took one generation instead of the
[43:22] children that cross over their children
[43:24] that forgot all these marriages how much
[43:28] worse do they speak to our hearts to say
[43:30] that a little carnality a little
[43:32] wordliness it's not gonna hurt my walk
[43:36] with you somebody else kill you
[43:38] spiritually
[43:39] and how the prophets spoke to our hearts
[43:41] to always put you first yes amen

[46:47] my roommate a couple of days before the
[46:51] storm

[46:53] was like getting loose from previous
[46:56] storms and he's like it's gonna fall in
[46:59] the house and it's going to fall in the
[47:00] awning and I texted and no it's not it's
[47:04] I I learned over the years to speak amen
[47:08] what you want yes to be done because we
[47:11] have the power to do that through of the
[47:14] Holy Ghost and Jesus and so I told him
[47:17] no it's not it's going to avoid the
[47:19] house and the Omni that that's over the
[47:21] back porch
[47:22] um and sure enough it
[47:24] when the storm came through two days ago

[55:46] funeral or not I think we did
[55:49] yeah
[55:51] at mom's funeral too because it's so it
[55:54] means so much to me I I uh I really love
[55:57] that song very much so it means a lot to

[58:32] this service again speak to us from your
[58:34] word anoint here speaker what you'd have
[58:37] accomplished should be done God we
[58:38] committed to you in the name of the Lord
[58:40] Jesus Christ now we pray amen amen
[58:44] in Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 unto Adam
[58:47] also to his wife to the Lord God make
[58:50] coats of skins and clothe them you could
[58:53] be seated if you'd like
[58:55] amen I want to stay in Genesis and I
[58:58] want to go over to uh Genesis the 18th
[59:01] chapter
[59:04] a story that's very familiar to us that
[59:06] we've all read and know about probably
[59:07] very extensively but it's the first one
[59:10] that I could find outside of the Garden
[59:12] of Eden that that involved or had this
[59:16] investigating judgment that's the
[59:18] subtitle that I want to speak on today
[59:20] again this is the holy spirit Part 9 uh
[59:24] investigating judgment uh it'll probably
[59:27] be just this one service for this but
[59:29] the first one I could think of uh the
[59:32] first one I could find scripturally of
[59:34] course we're only 18 chapters deep in
[59:36] Genesis uh outside of the Garden of Eden
[59:39] where we have investigating judgment
[59:41] takes place Genesis Chapter 18 it's
[59:45] amazing how the world could have
[59:48] devolved so quickly from the Garden of
[59:51] Eden and the Perfection that existed
[59:52] there uh to where God actually had to
[59:55] send investigating judgment out for the
[59:58] sin that was going on in the land it's
[1:00:01] uh it's incredible how quickly man can
[1:00:03] do evolve into sin when there's nothing
[1:00:07] there to help him to hold him to bring
[1:00:10] him along in the Perfection of God uh
[1:00:14] 18 verses here and of course uh it was
[1:00:17] even before that but the first
[1:00:20] investigating let's let's read this here
[1:00:22] again we know the story very well but I
[1:00:24] want to draw this context of this
[1:00:26] investigating judgment because I believe
[1:00:29] that this has a quite a bit to do to
[1:00:32] understand and I have touched on this
[1:00:34] subject before so bear with me if you've
[1:00:37] been with me through this topic before
[1:00:40] but of what's going on today and what's
[1:00:43] going on in this country today what's
[1:00:45] going on in the world today not just the
[1:00:47] United States uh of of things that's
[1:00:50] becoming very prominent that people talk
[1:00:52] about a lot you hear in the news now a
[1:00:54] lot more and of course there's cameras
[1:00:57] set up all over the place and there's a
[1:00:59] camera in everybody's hand and uh
[1:01:02] there's there's feelings going on all
[1:01:05] over the place of uh of of these things
[1:01:08] that they have no idea what they're
[1:01:09] talking about they have no idea what
[1:01:11] they're looking at
[1:01:12] uh but thank God we know a prophet that
[1:01:14] came and told us amen what that was
[1:01:17] Genesis and we'll get to that by the end
[1:01:19] of the service today Genesis Chapter 18
[1:01:21] though let's read and start with this
[1:01:24] investigating judgment uh first verse
[1:01:26] down the Lord appeared unto him in the
[1:01:28] plains of memory
[1:01:30] and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat
[1:01:33] of the day
[1:01:34] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[1:01:36] loathed three men stood by him
[1:01:39] and when he saw them plural
[1:01:43] he ran to meet them
[1:01:45] from the tent door and bowed himself
[1:01:48] toward the ground and said my Lord
[1:01:51] singular
[1:01:53] he approached three men but he only
[1:01:56] addressed one of them
[1:01:58] amen because only one of them was his
[1:02:01] Lord the other two were just there as
[1:02:05] inspectors but there was one there that
[1:02:08] was his Lords amen and of course Abraham
[1:02:10] being Abraham and having that Revelation
[1:02:12] and knowing that he bowed down himself
[1:02:15] to the one almighty God and called him
[1:02:19] Lord amen which had visited him met with
[1:02:22] him and El Shaddai that he had named him
[1:02:25] the almighty God Amen he said my Lord
[1:02:29] if now I have found favor in thy sight
[1:02:32] pass not away I pray thee from thy
[1:02:35] servant so we got this background the
[1:02:39] three that were standing there one we
[1:02:42] believed to be God uh brother random
[1:02:44] talked about it and dramatized it is God
[1:02:46] took up three clumps of dirt and said
[1:02:48] Mike would step into this and Gabriel
[1:02:51] step into this and he stepped in the
[1:02:53] third one and that one was the one that
[1:02:55] Abraham recognized he called the one
[1:02:58] Michael Gabriel we don't know that
[1:03:00] that's not scripture but uh dramatizing
[1:03:03] it to believe I don't have any reason to
[1:03:05] disbelieve that so we'll go with that
[1:03:08] that the three were there that they were
[1:03:11] there for a purpose the purpose was in
[1:03:13] accordance to the study that we're
[1:03:15] talking about today so uh we'll just
[1:03:17] skip through the rest of that and go
[1:03:19] down to the 17th verse now I want to
[1:03:21] pick back up at the 17th verse
[1:03:25] um I'll tell you the 16th first let's
[1:03:27] start with the 16th verse we're still
[1:03:29] Genesis 18 but now verse 16. and the men
[1:03:32] rose up from fence and looked towards
[1:03:35] Sodom because that was the purpose they
[1:03:37] were there for and Abraham went with
[1:03:39] them to bring them on the way the Lord
[1:03:41] said shall I hide from Abraham that
[1:03:44] thing which I do and of course he
[1:03:46] couldn't
[1:03:47] seeing the Abraham shall surely become a
[1:03:51] great and mighty nation and all the
[1:03:53] nations of the Earth shall be blessed in
[1:03:56] Him Now understand brother Branham
[1:03:59] talked about God not withholding any
[1:04:01] information from his Prophet from his
[1:04:04] servant Abraham but what I want you to
[1:04:07] understand is that a lot of people
[1:04:10] consider based on that brother Branham
[1:04:13] as being an omnipotent individual but
[1:04:16] brother Branham was not he was the
[1:04:18] prophet of God that God sent here Amen
[1:04:20] to bring a word to us in the prophetic
[1:04:22] gift and the operation of that gift amen
[1:04:24] nor was Abraham there were things that
[1:04:27] Abraham was not privy to in his time but
[1:04:30] God but but let me clear this now but
[1:04:33] God did not withhold anything from
[1:04:35] Abraham that he needed to know that was
[1:04:39] pertinent for his time and his place and
[1:04:42] his responsibility amen God withheld
[1:04:46] nothing from Abraham because that was
[1:04:47] his God that was his uh servant that was
[1:04:50] his man that was his Prophet amen just
[1:04:52] like I believe God didn't withhold
[1:04:54] anything from Brother Branham that we
[1:04:57] needed to know that he needed to bring
[1:04:59] to a bride for this last day that we
[1:05:02] needed for the purpose that he served
[1:05:04] while he was here brother Brandon
[1:05:06] himself said that God will be unfolding
[1:05:09] himself through eternity well if that's
[1:05:13] true then God could not have told him
[1:05:16] everything
[1:05:18] he God would not have made him privy to
[1:05:21] everything that is God of course no
[1:05:25] human could contain everything that is
[1:05:28] God right so to understand or to believe
[1:05:31] him to be in that capacity helps us
[1:05:33] understand that God did not withhold the
[1:05:37] pertinent information that Abraham
[1:05:40] needed notice read the scripture with me
[1:05:42] again
[1:05:44] the Lord says shall I hide from Abraham
[1:05:47] that thing which I do why
[1:05:51] he says seeing that Abraham shall surely
[1:05:56] be a great nation in all nations of the
[1:05:59] Earth shall be blessed in him there was
[1:06:01] a purpose for that was the reason why
[1:06:04] God was not going to withhold it from
[1:06:06] Abraham it wasn't just arbitrary
[1:06:08] information that God wanted Abraham to
[1:06:11] know just so he knew no he let him know
[1:06:15] because of the the uh the purpose of
[1:06:19] Abraham and and what he was in this
[1:06:22] earth to his people
[1:06:24] see that Abraham will do this this and
[1:06:28] this that's the reason amen not just
[1:06:31] arbitrarily but a reason a specific
[1:06:34] reason that God allowed Abraham God was
[1:06:38] Abraham was God's prophet and God was
[1:06:41] not going to withhold this from his
[1:06:43] Prophet because of the importance of
[1:06:47] this to him and to his people right amen
[1:06:51] lot being one of his people
[1:06:54] understand lot his nephew was one of his
[1:06:58] people right praise the Lord remember at
[1:07:01] the slaughter of the Kings
[1:07:02] Abraham uh told God he said uh uh uh
[1:07:07] look north south east and west uh lot is
[1:07:11] mine I'm gonna go get him
[1:07:13] he belongs to me and I'm gonna go get
[1:07:16] him and he did
[1:07:17] amen he went down to Sodom and he freed
[1:07:21] from those kings he freed lot and his
[1:07:24] family back out of the hands of those
[1:07:26] kings
[1:07:28] because Abraham took possession of what
[1:07:31] was his even if it was his nephew praise
[1:07:35] the Lord amen seeing then
[1:07:38] now that Abraham shall surely become a
[1:07:41] great nation Great and Mighty Nation and
[1:07:44] all the nations of the Earth shall be
[1:07:46] blessed in him
[1:07:48] praise the Lord that includes the bride
[1:07:51] this is the I think the third week now
[1:07:54] we've gotten into Abraham a little
[1:07:56] the bride she is a part of that family
[1:07:59] the Royal Seed of Abraham through Jesus
[1:08:02] Christ comes the bride amen amen
[1:08:06] praise the Lord so that that is that
[1:08:09] belongs to us it's our possession
[1:08:12] for I know him
[1:08:13] that he will command his children his
[1:08:16] household after him
[1:08:18] and they shall keep the way of the Lord
[1:08:19] to do justice and judgment that the Lord
[1:08:22] may bring upon Abraham that which he
[1:08:25] spoken has spoken of him
[1:08:28] and the Lord said because the Cry of
[1:08:30] Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because
[1:08:32] their sin is very Grievous I will now
[1:08:37] this is God speaking now remember the
[1:08:39] Lord said now this is God speaking the
[1:08:42] Lord said because the crowd of Silence
[1:08:45] great and because of the sin is very
[1:08:47] Grievous I God said I
[1:08:50] we'll go down now and see whether they
[1:08:54] have done all together according to the
[1:08:55] Cry of it would just come unto me and if
[1:08:58] not I will know God said I am going to
[1:09:01] go down how did God go down there
[1:09:06] he sent his he sent his angels right he
[1:09:10] said get Michael and Gabriel if we'll
[1:09:13] we'll go with that with the two servants
[1:09:16] he sent them
[1:09:18] when he sent them it's as if he went
[1:09:22] himself
[1:09:23] because he said I am going to go
[1:09:25] but he went in those two angels
[1:09:29] in human flesh he went through them
[1:09:32] praise the Lord understand now that's
[1:09:35] how God works today
[1:09:37] even he works through us
[1:09:39] God living in US Works through us is as
[1:09:42] if he is here yes praise the Lord
[1:09:45] because he's in us working through us we
[1:09:48] are his hands we are his feet we are his
[1:09:51] mouth we are his life
[1:09:52] in this earth praise the Lord God is
[1:09:55] here because he's here through us he
[1:09:58] went there because he went there through
[1:10:00] them
[1:10:02] and the men turned their faces from
[1:10:04] thence and went towards Sodom but
[1:10:07] Abraham stood yet before the Lord
[1:10:10] and Abraham Drew near and said well thou
[1:10:13] destroy the righteous with the wicked
[1:10:15] now you go through the 50 40 30 10 that
[1:10:19] Abraham pleaded to God because of course
[1:10:22] Abraham had family that was down there
[1:10:25] Abraham in his heart now of course I
[1:10:28] believe Abraham had a heart for people
[1:10:30] anyway uh that's one of the misnomers
[1:10:33] that we have uh as as as Christians even
[1:10:36] and as uh Believers in this message and
[1:10:39] and and and as bride that we don't have
[1:10:43] a concern for the world
[1:10:46] and that there couldn't be anything more
[1:10:48] wrong
[1:10:49] that we don't have compassion for people
[1:10:52] who don't see things the way we do there
[1:10:55] is no more compassion in this world for
[1:10:58] a lost soul than from a bride member or
[1:11:01] for someone filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:02] there is no more love in this world
[1:11:04] there is no more compassion that you'll
[1:11:07] ever get than what you'll get from
[1:11:09] someone who belongs to Jesus Christ
[1:11:11] because they know what the real
[1:11:13] compassion of God is they know what the
[1:11:16] real love of God is amen the real love
[1:11:19] of God is just not being passive the
[1:11:21] real love of God is as much corrective
[1:11:23] as it is uh affectionate right amen the
[1:11:26] real love of God is as much corrective
[1:11:28] and a lot of people don't understand
[1:11:30] that that correction is love yes because
[1:11:34] I love that person because I love
[1:11:36] humanity and I believe Abraham had a
[1:11:39] compassion for Humanity but Abraham also
[1:11:41] knew that his family was down there
[1:11:44] Abraham knew that lot his family was
[1:11:47] down there and he pleaded with God if
[1:11:49] there's this is there's this don't
[1:11:51] destroy it don't destroy the the
[1:11:54] righteous with the wicked
[1:11:56] and that was at Abraham's plea to God
[1:11:59] because God was about to destroy it but
[1:12:01] he sent his two Messengers down there to
[1:12:03] go spout the land he sent investigating
[1:12:07] judgment down into the land to go check
[1:12:09] to see what did God say to see whether
[1:12:13] it is according to the Cry of it has
[1:12:15] come to me as as is as wicked as it said
[1:12:20] amen is this evil as is sinful is this
[1:12:24] said it had gotten so sinful friend 18th
[1:12:27] 18th chapter of Genesis this place had
[1:12:31] become so sinful that he had this
[1:12:34] investigating judgment to go find out to
[1:12:37] see is this is is what it said it is
[1:12:40] and to those who would be righteous
[1:12:44] those who would be the ones that that
[1:12:46] God would spare he sent the
[1:12:48] investigating judgment angels to rescue
[1:12:51] them let's read this let's start let's
[1:12:53] go in the 19th verse now go through the
[1:12:56] uh Abraham saying prayer Adventure
[1:12:58] there's 50 40 30 10.
[1:13:01] God said our spirit for all those sake
[1:13:04] but obviously there wasn't that to say
[1:13:08] and there came two angels to Sodom and
[1:13:10] even and lot sat in the gate of Sodom
[1:13:13] and lots seeing them rose up to meet
[1:13:16] them and he bowed himself with his face
[1:13:18] towards the ground
[1:13:20] which he should not have done
[1:13:23] and he said behold now my lords
[1:13:26] plural my lords
[1:13:29] plural without Revelation like Abraham
[1:13:32] had of course God wasn't with them it
[1:13:35] was just Michael and Gabriel that had
[1:13:37] gone down
[1:13:38] and he's and he bowed himself to those
[1:13:40] angels uh remember in Revelation uh the
[1:13:45] Bowing to the angel he said get up I'm
[1:13:47] your fellow servant
[1:13:49] the lot balanced himself and he says my
[1:13:51] Lord's plural
[1:13:53] turn in I pray you into your servant's
[1:13:56] house and Terry all night and wash your
[1:13:57] feet and ye shall rise up early and go
[1:13:59] your ways and they said nay but we will
[1:14:02] abide in the street all night why
[1:14:03] because that was their Commission their
[1:14:06] commission wasn't to come have a party
[1:14:09] with lot their commission was to go
[1:14:11] investigate the wickedness of the city
[1:14:14] what better way to do that than to lay
[1:14:16] all night in the city streets
[1:14:19] but listen now he pressed upon them
[1:14:23] greatly and they turned him unto him
[1:14:25] entered into the house and he made them
[1:14:27] a feast and did bake unleavened bread
[1:14:29] and they did eat
[1:14:31] but before they lay down before they
[1:14:34] could even go back out
[1:14:36] the men of the city even the Minnesota
[1:14:38] can pass the house roundabout both old
[1:14:41] and young all the people from every
[1:14:43] quarter and they called into lot and
[1:14:45] said unto him where are the men which
[1:14:48] came into thee this night
[1:14:50] bring them out to us that we may know
[1:14:53] them or have relation with them in a
[1:14:57] sexual capacity that's what you go look
[1:14:59] up this word no that's exactly what it
[1:15:01] says
[1:15:02] amen this wasn't we want to greet them
[1:15:05] we want to meet them we want to welcome
[1:15:07] them to our neighborhood no no no they
[1:15:10] wanted to abuse them amen and and uh and
[1:15:14] an ungodly way
[1:15:18] hence today the word Sodom and
[1:15:22] sodomites and what that means
[1:15:24] bring them out to us a lot went out the
[1:15:26] door unto them shut the door after him
[1:15:28] and said I pray you Brethren do not so
[1:15:30] wickedly but hold now I have two
[1:15:32] daughters which have not known man let
[1:15:34] me I pray you bring them out to you you
[1:15:36] do whatever to them as good as in your
[1:15:38] eye only unto these men do nothing for
[1:15:40] therefore they came uh therefore came
[1:15:43] they under the shadow of my roof and
[1:15:46] they said stand back they didn't even
[1:15:47] want the women
[1:15:49] they were only interested man and man
[1:15:52] amen amen
[1:15:55] stand back and they said again this one
[1:15:58] fellow came into sojourn and he will
[1:16:00] need to be a judge now we will deal
[1:16:03] worse with thee than with them they
[1:16:04] press sore upon the man even lot and
[1:16:08] came near to break the door but the men
[1:16:10] put forth their hand pulled a lot into
[1:16:12] the house to them and shut the door and
[1:16:15] they smote the men that were at the door
[1:16:17] of the house with blindness both small
[1:16:20] and great so that they wearied
[1:16:22] themselves to find the door and the men
[1:16:24] said unto lot hast thou hear any besides
[1:16:28] son-in-law and thy Sons thy daughters
[1:16:30] whatsoever thou has in the city bring
[1:16:33] them out of this place we've seen enough
[1:16:36] the the investigation is over we've went
[1:16:40] to we've witnessed enough in this city
[1:16:43] to know that this city is deserving of
[1:16:46] being destroyed yeah right for we will
[1:16:49] destroy this place because the Cry of
[1:16:53] them is waxing great before the face of
[1:16:55] the Lord and the Lord has sent us to
[1:16:58] destroy it Amen to destroy the city why
[1:17:03] wasn't even enough there they sent the
[1:17:06] angels to investigate to unleash what
[1:17:10] did they say the Lord sent us here to
[1:17:13] investigate and to execute judgment on
[1:17:17] this city
[1:17:18] you and your family can be saved if
[1:17:21] you'll get out of this place
[1:17:23] and that's exactly what
[1:17:26] is tried to do in this world today
[1:17:30] with the love of God and with the
[1:17:32] mercies of God to pull people out in
[1:17:36] time to be rescued from the destruction
[1:17:39] of this world and from the sin that is
[1:17:42] that is in degradation that is hindering
[1:17:45] this world that's destroying this world
[1:17:48] There's an opportunity even yet today if
[1:17:52] people will just eat it to come out of
[1:17:55] this world and to come into Christ amen
[1:17:58] there's a way today of escape from the
[1:18:00] destruction that's about to strike this
[1:18:03] land friend that escape is still the
[1:18:05] same today if they'll run to Christ if
[1:18:09] they'll accept him he will save them and
[1:18:11] bring them to himself right these angels
[1:18:15] if you read on actually had to take lot
[1:18:18] in his family his daughters and pull
[1:18:21] them out of the city to get them to
[1:18:24] leave right oh God have mercy yes
[1:18:28] and then of course we know that it
[1:18:30] rained far in Brimstone on the place and
[1:18:32] it sunk underneath the Dead Sea
[1:18:35] because judgment has struck
[1:18:38] investigation had took place
[1:18:41] the investigating Angels were there to
[1:18:44] make sure it was as bad as it was said
[1:18:47] to be
[1:18:48] and when they found it to be so they
[1:18:51] said lot do you have anybody let's get
[1:18:53] out of here
[1:18:54] lead this place because God has sent us
[1:18:57] to destroy this place and lot tried to
[1:19:00] plead just like Abraham did but of
[1:19:02] course lot doesn't have the standing
[1:19:04] that Abraham had with God right right no
[1:19:07] this place is going to be destroyed get
[1:19:10] out
[1:19:11] now's your chance get out of this city
[1:19:14] while there's time
[1:19:16] and it was just so much so in the and
[1:19:19] lot's wife's heart that she couldn't
[1:19:20] stand it she had to look back maybe to
[1:19:23] the screens of her friends maybe the
[1:19:25] screens of her card parties maybe the
[1:19:28] the the the wailings of the of the
[1:19:31] children something who knows what caught
[1:19:33] in her heart and she turned back to look
[1:19:36] at the destruction because God told her
[1:19:38] don't told him don't look back right
[1:19:40] when you come into Christ don't look
[1:19:42] back you just continue on with him and
[1:19:45] continue to go and to press into this
[1:19:48] how Mark of the High Calling continue to
[1:19:51] press forward don't ever look back she
[1:19:53] looked back she turned to a pillar of
[1:19:54] salt right amen If Abraham or if Allah
[1:19:58] had turned around and looked back to her
[1:20:00] he would have turned the same thing the
[1:20:02] daughters would happen but they
[1:20:04] continued on Don't Look Back just
[1:20:05] continue year to go
[1:20:07] remember her heart was still there her
[1:20:10] heart was still so much in Sodom that
[1:20:12] she couldn't stand to see it being
[1:20:14] destroyed with her friends or whoever it
[1:20:17] might be that was down there
[1:20:19] and so she had to turn around and look
[1:20:21] but the investigation
[1:20:23] God sent an investigation to go find out
[1:20:26] and once it was found out it was
[1:20:28] destroyed
[1:20:30] amen it was destroyed as in the and
[1:20:33] looked for him
[1:20:36] the Bible says Luke 17
[1:20:39] you know Luke 17 yeah
[1:20:41] as it was in the days of solemn
[1:20:45] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:20:48] of man have we witnessed that today yes
[1:20:50] coming of the son of man has taken place
[1:20:54] Brennan now we are sitting in the same
[1:20:57] place that they were of investigating
[1:20:59] judgment
[1:21:00] as it was in the days of solemn so shall
[1:21:03] it be right now yes today we are
[1:21:07] standing we are living in an
[1:21:10] unprecedented time at the end of
[1:21:13] humanity with investigating judgments
[1:21:16] going on
[1:21:18] people don't even realize it they don't
[1:21:20] understand it and of course if you don't
[1:21:23] know and listen to a prophet like we do
[1:21:25] how would you know yes right I wouldn't
[1:21:28] know
[1:21:29] if I didn't hear and know and believe
[1:21:31] what he told me that was from God to
[1:21:35] look for to see this I wouldn't know
[1:21:37] either
[1:21:38] thank God
[1:21:40] for the I Salve that applied to the eyes
[1:21:43] that we can see
[1:21:45] the revelation of that word and
[1:21:46] understand what's going on in this world
[1:21:48] today as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:21:52] shall it be right now let's look at
[1:21:53] another one he's in Exodus chapter 12.
[1:21:57] we've touched on this through our
[1:21:58] studying so far as well
[1:22:03] Exodus chapter 12.
[1:22:07] amen
[1:22:08] these
[1:22:10] were investigating judgments that were
[1:22:12] relegated to a city or to a country
[1:22:16] but friend I want you to know that today
[1:22:18] what's going on is sweeping around the
[1:22:22] world it's not just a city yeah it's not
[1:22:24] just a country it's not just a continent
[1:22:26] it's worldwide of what's happening today
[1:22:29] amen because the entire judgment is
[1:22:32] taking place on the entire world and the
[1:22:35] the investigating and the judgment's
[1:22:37] going to take place just the same
[1:22:40] God always sends warning before he sends
[1:22:42] judgment
[1:22:44] he sent lot the warning for them to do
[1:22:47] for them and what did what and what did
[1:22:49] the prophet of God for this last day
[1:22:51] what does the ministry should of this
[1:22:53] day they cry still yet Revelation 18.
[1:22:57] come out of her my people and be not
[1:22:59] partaker of her sin yes that she be
[1:23:03] separated
[1:23:04] a a bride called adorned for her husband
[1:23:07] yes amen that's today that's today
[1:23:11] Exodus 12 now and the Lord spake unto
[1:23:14] Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
[1:23:17] it's the Paschal Lamb again like we said
[1:23:19] we spoke on
[1:23:21] CE you get into another different little
[1:23:23] uh topic here of this
[1:23:25] uh say this month shall be unto you the
[1:23:28] beginning of months it shall be the
[1:23:30] first month of of the Year to you
[1:23:33] speak into all the congregation of
[1:23:35] Israel saying in the 10th day of this
[1:23:37] month they shall take to them every man
[1:23:40] a lamb according to his house uh uh to
[1:23:43] the house of his of their fathers a lamb
[1:23:46] foreign house
[1:23:47] and if the household be too little for
[1:23:49] the lamb let him and his name I'm just
[1:23:51] kind of reading through this because
[1:23:53] we've already touched on this a few
[1:23:54] Services ago
[1:23:56] just to get to a point now let him and
[1:23:59] his neighbor take unto his house uh take
[1:24:02] it according to the number of the souls
[1:24:04] every man according to his eating shall
[1:24:07] make their account uh your count for the
[1:24:09] lamb your lamb shall be without blemish
[1:24:12] a male of the first year ye shall take
[1:24:15] it out of the sheep or of the goats
[1:24:18] and ye shall keep it up until the 14th
[1:24:21] day of the same month and the whole
[1:24:24] assembly of the congregation of Israel
[1:24:26] shall kill it in the evening time now
[1:24:28] again a couple of services ago we caught
[1:24:31] we've really covered that pretty
[1:24:33] thoroughly through that Christ and
[1:24:36] communion and the four days and uh the
[1:24:39] the male uh but the point I want to get
[1:24:42] to now starting to the seventh verse
[1:24:45] and they shall take of the blood and
[1:24:48] strike it on the two side posts and on
[1:24:51] the upper doorpost of the house wherein
[1:24:54] they shall eat it
[1:24:56] and they shall eat the Flesh in that
[1:24:58] night roast with fire and unleavened
[1:25:01] bread and with bitter herbs they shall
[1:25:04] eat it
[1:25:10] it all with water but roast with fire
[1:25:12] his head his legs the pertinence thereof
[1:25:15] and he shall let nothing of it remain
[1:25:17] until the morning and that it that which
[1:25:19] remaineth of it until the morning ye
[1:25:21] shall burn with fire good representing
[1:25:24] communion thus shall he eat with your
[1:25:26] lawn skirted your shoes on your feet
[1:25:28] your stash in your hand and ye shall eat
[1:25:30] it in haste it is the Lord's Passover
[1:25:32] for I will look now I will now judgment
[1:25:36] had already been said
[1:25:38] now in all of the all of the plagues
[1:25:42] and and all of the warnings and all the
[1:25:46] chances that God gave pharaoh and Egypt
[1:25:49] to repent they would not do it
[1:25:52] they gave God gave ample warning ample
[1:25:56] opportunity ample time for pharaoh and
[1:25:59] his country to come under that auspice
[1:26:02] with Israel and that Israel go but he
[1:26:05] would not do it
[1:26:07] he would not do it so the warning
[1:26:11] now instigates the judgment
[1:26:13] the judgment's about to strike right
[1:26:16] look down the last warning the last one
[1:26:23] 12 first I will pass again God says I
[1:26:28] will pass through the land of Egypt this
[1:26:32] night
[1:26:32] and I will Smite all the force firstborn
[1:26:35] in the land of Egypt both man and Beast
[1:26:38] and against all the gods of Egypt I will
[1:26:41] execute judgment I am the Lord because
[1:26:44] the warnings were spurned
[1:26:46] and the blood shall be to you for a
[1:26:49] token upon the houses where ye are and
[1:26:52] when I see the blood I will pass over
[1:26:54] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[1:26:57] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[1:27:00] Egypt
[1:27:01] everyone as we spoke before
[1:27:04] that found themselves under that token
[1:27:07] was spares the judgment
[1:27:10] everyone whoever was behind that door
[1:27:14] behind that token was found to be
[1:27:19] saved
[1:27:20] even even if they had been I know the
[1:27:23] country of Egypt the scripture is
[1:27:25] talking about the country of Egypt was
[1:27:28] under judgment
[1:27:29] but if an Egyptian believed enough
[1:27:33] to come into one of the homes the
[1:27:35] families
[1:27:37] to go into behind that blood to go into
[1:27:41] behind that token they were saved
[1:27:45] just like the rest of them they were
[1:27:47] saved they were spared from that
[1:27:49] judgment anyone that is willing to come
[1:27:53] under the token anyone that is willing
[1:27:56] to accept and receive that for
[1:27:58] themselves is spared the judgment
[1:28:02] they sent investigation
[1:28:04] amen he sent warnings God sent Moses
[1:28:08] down there amen you had Michael Gabriel
[1:28:10] and uh and uh with Abraham you've got
[1:28:14] God sending Moses
[1:28:17] God sent Moses down to try to tell them
[1:28:19] to try to warn them to try to give them
[1:28:23] an opportunity to repent
[1:28:25] God always gives everyone a space to
[1:28:28] repent
[1:28:30] everybody God would not be a just God if
[1:28:33] he not did not allow every human a space
[1:28:36] to repent repent right right every human
[1:28:38] to the point of accountability of course
[1:28:42] everybody has the opportunity to repent
[1:28:44] everybody
[1:28:45] has a chance to accept and receive God
[1:28:48] and repent of their sins everybody does
[1:28:50] every human or it wouldn't be God but
[1:28:53] thank God he is a just God and he allows
[1:28:55] everybody that opportunity they had that
[1:28:57] opportunity and if anybody had accepted
[1:29:00] it if anybody had received it and gotten
[1:29:02] behind now see you can't just say oh I
[1:29:05] believe it
[1:29:06] you can't just stand there and say oh I
[1:29:08] accept it I I I think that's true but
[1:29:11] then you don't get behind the token it
[1:29:14] does you no good
[1:29:16] You're Just As Dead As the rest of them
[1:29:18] amen you're just as God as the rest of
[1:29:21] them lost just the rest of them let's
[1:29:23] look here now
[1:29:28] Christ revealed in his own word
[1:29:30] you remember Jesus said as it was in the
[1:29:33] days of Sodom
[1:29:35] what happened just before Sodom God came
[1:29:38] down with some angels they had an
[1:29:40] investigation judgment
[1:29:43] said I've heard the city that it is so
[1:29:45] sinful so great so I've come down to
[1:29:47] find out whether it's all together true
[1:29:49] or not is that right
[1:29:51] what's that main one now that stayed
[1:29:54] with Abraham
[1:29:55] could discern the thoughts was in

[1:31:55] converse about these things
[1:31:57] our church is not a place of Fellowship
[1:32:00] even though that's what we do when we go
[1:32:02] out from here that's not the purpose of
[1:32:04] it right the purpose is to come together
[1:32:07] in one place for God to come and drop in
[1:32:10] the midst and to speak to us and for us
[1:32:12] to worship him and to learn of him and

[1:32:54] but yet it's got to be applied am I
[1:32:58] someone could stand in front of one of
[1:33:01] those Homes at that time and say I
[1:33:03] believe that that I think that's right
[1:33:06] that's the good thing and then they go

[1:34:56] pure and right as any and you got half a
[1:34:58] dozen

[1:35:11] it's a nice thing and I'm not saying
[1:35:13] anything wrong with that friend I
[1:35:15] actually honestly I had now I know this
[1:35:18] to the fact
[1:35:19] it was the brother I know not in Tucson
[1:35:22] not in any churches around here
[1:35:25] that through my life of ministering
[1:35:32] my bro a brother of mine and Christ
[1:35:36] went to a church to speak
[1:35:39] I did the same thing when
[1:35:41] when certain brother to speak
[1:35:43] and that brother said now make sure and
[1:35:46] whatever you say Don't run off my
[1:35:49] make-believers because they're the ones
[1:35:50] that pay the bills
[1:35:57] now there I'm not saying that this
[1:35:59] person said Don't Preach this or Don't
[1:36:01] Preach that or don't say this or don't
[1:36:03] say that he didn't say that the Liberty
[1:36:05] was there to speak and not spoke
[1:36:07] whatever God said but that statement
[1:36:08] literally was spoken out of his mouth
[1:36:10] don't run off my make-believers they pay
[1:36:13] the bills
[1:36:15] that just come and congregate in a place
[1:36:17] what's the purpose of them being there
[1:36:19] and and friend don't give me if God has
[1:36:23] allowed them to be there at that time in
[1:36:24] that place to help in that capacity
[1:36:27] right then one that's fine
[1:36:29] amen it's like uh it's like that woman
[1:36:32] that had no food and had no money and
[1:36:35] she's sitting next to an open window and
[1:36:37] she's praying God send me some food Lord
[1:36:39] I need I don't have any money I don't
[1:36:41] have any food Lord just send me some
[1:36:42] bread I just just could use a loaf of
[1:36:45] bread two kids were outside the window
[1:36:46] listening to her praying they thought
[1:36:48] there's going to play a prank on her so
[1:36:50] they go to the grocery store and they
[1:36:51] buy her some bread
[1:36:53] and they come and they ring the doorbell
[1:36:54] put the bread down they run away
[1:36:56] and she cuts up from her knees and she
[1:36:59] goes she looks as the loaf of bread she
[1:37:00] says oh thank you Lord I appreciate God
[1:37:03] giving me this loaf of bread I needed it
[1:37:05] so bad and those kids jumped out from
[1:37:06] the bush said lady God didn't give you
[1:37:09] that bread we got it for you
[1:37:11] and she said God even if you have to
[1:37:13] send a couple of devils to give me some
[1:37:14] bread thank you for the bread
[1:37:17] amen
[1:37:19] whatever it's got to be to supply it yes
[1:37:22] praise the Lord amen if that's what it
[1:37:24] was to supply it okay but friend it
[1:37:27] doesn't get you where you want to go
[1:37:28] right
[1:37:29] be behind the token is the only thing
[1:37:31] that'll keep you from the destruction
[1:37:33] being behind the token not to apply that
[1:37:37] token is the only thing that's going to
[1:37:38] keep you amen the only thing that's
[1:37:41] going to put you in a Rapture too Moses
[1:37:43] going to speak today oh that's wonderful
[1:37:45] oh you know there's big churches in this
[1:37:48] message that's fine there's nothing
[1:37:49] wrong with that amen but when people
[1:37:52] start showing favoritism and say oh well
[1:37:54] so and so well if so-and-so is going to
[1:37:56] be well okay
[1:37:58] us old so-and-so is going to be there oh
[1:38:01] absolutely I'm going to be there then
[1:38:04] you understand is that of God
[1:38:07] that to me friend that's not of God
[1:38:10] amen now uh
[1:38:13] there could be little extenuating
[1:38:14] circumstances there uh I don't go out of
[1:38:18] my way to hear somebody preach that I
[1:38:20] know is off the word
[1:38:22] I don't do that I'd rather go when I
[1:38:25] know that somebody's on the word and
[1:38:26] preaching the pure and adulterated word
[1:38:28] then I I don't care if they're two foot
[1:38:31] tall or two uh miles tall I don't care
[1:38:34] if they have a big name little name I'll
[1:38:35] carry the big church little church I
[1:38:37] don't care if they're evangelist Pastor
[1:38:39] uh uh missionary
[1:38:42] you preach the word that's all that
[1:38:44] matters and
[1:38:45] it should be anyway yeah yeah I think
[1:38:48] that's a lot of the point Brother Brad
[1:38:49] I'm saying here it doesn't matter
[1:38:51] whether Moses speaking your name doesn't
[1:38:53] matter whether you've gone with the
[1:38:54] Joneses or The Goldberg no matter if we
[1:38:56] tell her talk about how wonderful get
[1:38:58] into it
[1:39:02] and the word become a part of your life
[1:39:04] be filled with the Holy Spirit be born
[1:39:06] again so that you can be that one when
[1:39:09] that investigating judgment comes under
[1:39:10] that it shows that token and it says I
[1:39:13] will pass over you yeah praise the Lord
[1:39:17] amen
[1:39:19] get beneath it he said not just talk
[1:39:21] about it but we get beneath it here in
[1:39:24] the Paschal Lamb the blood shall be for
[1:39:27] a token
[1:39:29] he had a token get into that token upon
[1:39:32] the houses where ye are and when I see
[1:39:34] that blood I will pass over you
[1:39:37] and the plague shall not come upon you
[1:39:40] to destroy you
[1:39:42] that was an overall sweeping judgment
[1:39:45] there
[1:39:46] an overall sweeping judgment that swept
[1:39:50] through that country that swept through
[1:39:52] Egypt that judgment that killed
[1:39:56] multiples of the firstborns in that City
[1:39:59] because they refused to get behind the
[1:40:01] token they refused to get in the blood
[1:40:04] amen it's swept through just like it's
[1:40:08] doing today friend amen the only way you
[1:40:11] can survive it is to get in the token
[1:40:13] amen
[1:40:14] Ezekiel
[1:40:16] let's look at Ezekiel chapter 18.
[1:40:20] or excuse me chapter 8.
[1:40:26] Ezekiel chapter 8.
[1:40:28] let's start with the 17th and 18th first
[1:40:32] I probably I was going to read the whole
[1:40:34] thing well we'll see
[1:40:36] Ezekiel 8 17.
[1:40:39] then he said unto me
[1:40:41] hast thou seen this o son of man
[1:40:46] is it a light thing God's speaking now
[1:40:49] is it a like thing
[1:40:51] to the house of Judah that they commit
[1:40:54] the Abominations which they commit here
[1:40:58] is it something that I'm just supposed
[1:41:00] to overlook God's saying is it just
[1:41:02] something that's just supposed to be
[1:41:04] some that I wink at that
[1:41:06] that I just overlooked that he's singing
[1:41:09] This little light thing is it is it of
[1:41:11] importance to me or not
[1:41:14] is it a light thing see
[1:41:17] that they are committing these
[1:41:19] Abominations in my eyes
[1:41:23] for they have filled the land with
[1:41:25] violence and have returned to provoke me
[1:41:29] to anger and lo they put the branch to
[1:41:32] their nose sort of like the
[1:41:35] you know the old saying back in the day
[1:41:37] I don't think people say it very much
[1:41:38] anymore you thumb your nose up to
[1:41:40] something and I just want to forget you
[1:41:43] that's kind of that's what that means
[1:41:45] thumb your nose nose up just means I'll
[1:41:47] forget you you know forget that I'm not
[1:41:50] listening to you I don't care what
[1:41:51] you've got to say that's what he's
[1:41:53] talking about it's not that they just
[1:41:55] ignore him but they actually thumb their
[1:41:57] nose up at it I'm not paying any
[1:41:59] attention to you
[1:42:01] that's the provocation they're provoking
[1:42:04] him to anger
[1:42:06] and they thumb their nose we don't care
[1:42:08] what you say we're gonna do what we want
[1:42:10] to do
[1:42:11] therefore
[1:42:13] because of this great overlying sin will
[1:42:16] I also deal in theory
[1:42:20] my eyes shall not spare
[1:42:23] neither will I have pity
[1:42:27] now this is going to be a
[1:42:29] quite a judgment
[1:42:32] I will not have pity and though they cry
[1:42:35] in my ears with a loud voice yet will I
[1:42:40] not hear them
[1:42:44] this judgment is going to be sweeping
[1:42:45] friend it's going to be men women
[1:42:48] children
[1:42:49] no matter how much they scream yell cry
[1:42:53] God said he's not going to hear or have
[1:42:55] pity
[1:42:57] um
[1:42:58] he cried off friend that's exactly
[1:43:00] what's about to hit this Earth
[1:43:02] that's exactly what's about that we're
[1:43:04] about to did that we're not as a bride
[1:43:06] but this Earth's going to be dealing
[1:43:08] with
[1:43:09] amen
[1:43:11] because when this bride leaves
[1:43:14] all all the love all the mercy all the
[1:43:17] attributes of God is gone with him God's
[1:43:20] spirit goes over and starts dealing with
[1:43:22] the Jews but a worldwide sweeping thing
[1:43:24] is over right it's it's done the bride's
[1:43:27] gone it's finished
[1:43:29] there's no pity
[1:43:31] there's no mercy There's No Love No No
[1:43:34] Love of God
[1:43:37] that's what
[1:43:41] friend if that doesn't make us want to
[1:43:42] try to get as many as we possibly can
[1:43:44] into this I don't know
[1:43:46] very much I I don't want to see anybody
[1:43:49] go through that yeah I don't want to see
[1:43:51] anybody have to endure or live through
[1:43:53] that or die through that I told you
[1:43:55] before I think personally I think maybe
[1:43:57] some people with some gifts of the
[1:43:59] Spirit had some Visions or dreams or
[1:44:02] something of these dead people are still
[1:44:04] alive
[1:44:05] they call zombies the living dead
[1:44:08] because they look like that
[1:44:11] because they could try to blow their
[1:44:13] head off of the shotgun and blow half
[1:44:14] their head off and not be able to Die
[1:44:16] the Bible says they'll cry for the rocks
[1:44:19] and the mountains to follow them kill us
[1:44:22] something because death escapes them
[1:44:25] right
[1:44:29] can you imagine and people walking
[1:44:31] around like that I could have I could
[1:44:34] imagine people seeing her having a
[1:44:35] vision of that and seeing a person's
[1:44:37] head half blown off but still alive
[1:44:39] still walking around because they can't
[1:44:42] get death to take them
[1:44:46] hmm
[1:44:48] look now
[1:44:52] he cried also in my ears with a loud
[1:44:55] voice saying cause them to have charge
[1:44:57] over the city to draw near even every
[1:45:00] man with his destroying weapon in his
[1:45:02] hand
[1:45:03] and the old six men came from the way of
[1:45:06] the higher gate which slide towards the
[1:45:08] North and every man with a Slaughter
[1:45:09] weapon in his hand
[1:45:11] and one man among them was clothed with
[1:45:14] linen with a writer's ink horn in his uh
[1:45:17] by his side
[1:45:18] and they went in and Stood Beside the
[1:45:21] Brazen Altar and the glory of the Lord
[1:45:23] of Israel was gone up from the Cherub
[1:45:25] whereupon he was to the threshold of the
[1:45:29] house
[1:45:30] he calls to the man clothed with linen
[1:45:32] which had the writers incorn by his side
[1:45:34] of the Lord said unto him look who he's
[1:45:36] talking to First the man with the acorn
[1:45:40] the angel with the ink horn The Writer's
[1:45:42] incorn he's talking to him first he said
[1:45:44] unto him go through the midst of the
[1:45:47] city through the midst of Jerusalem and
[1:45:50] set a mark upon the four heads of the
[1:45:53] men that sigh and cry for all the
[1:45:56] Abominations that be done in the midst
[1:45:59] thereof
[1:46:00] what's he doing he's sending an
[1:46:02] investigation out
[1:46:04] he's sitting investigating judgment
[1:46:06] because before he before the
[1:46:09] slaughtering Angels go through he sends
[1:46:11] the investigating Angel just like with
[1:46:14] Abraham when Abraham said Abraham said
[1:46:16] prevent your lord if there be 50 God
[1:46:19] said all spirit 40 I'll spare 30 20 10.
[1:46:23] but what did he do he destroyed the city
[1:46:26] but yet he pulled out the Innocence he
[1:46:29] pulled out lot in his family
[1:46:31] well God's doing the same here he's
[1:46:33] telling with Ezekiel he's saying no the
[1:46:36] the man the angel with the acorn you go
[1:46:39] and you mark every one in their
[1:46:41] foreheads this crying and sign the
[1:46:43] Abomination is done in the land that
[1:46:45] Mark was to spare those people from the
[1:46:48] slaughtering weapons of the angels that
[1:46:50] was to sweep through that place he first
[1:46:53] sent investigation
[1:46:55] he first sent someone to mark them
[1:46:59] praise the Lord now look at the Mark
[1:47:01] going on in Revelation 13.
[1:47:04] amen the mark of the beast on the hand
[1:47:07] or the head which of course people
[1:47:10] worried about barcodes and chips and all
[1:47:12] this stuff I couldn't care less about
[1:47:14] any of that tattoos or whatever they're
[1:47:16] doing now that's inconsequential it's a
[1:47:19] spiritual battle not a physical battle
[1:47:20] if it's a spiritual battle it's going to
[1:47:23] be a spiritual Mark and brother Adam
[1:47:25] said the mark of the beast is receiving
[1:47:27] the doctrine and their and their
[1:47:30] evidence of it is the right end of
[1:47:32] Fellowship
[1:47:33] right amen I believe that false Doctrine
[1:47:37] I believe that uh uh uh that that
[1:47:41] adulterated that that man-made word that
[1:47:44] Dogma I believe it just like you do
[1:47:46] they've been marked in their heads and
[1:47:48] they get marked in their hands with the
[1:47:50] fellowship it's not something physical
[1:47:51] it's a spiritual thing
[1:47:54] they believe
[1:47:56] a Dogma like disbelieving the true word
[1:48:01] because the only way you can believe
[1:48:03] Dogma is to disbelieve the truth
[1:48:06] because the truth takes precedent does
[1:48:09] it not the truth takes precedent over
[1:48:12] everything
[1:48:13] so if it's not a belief in the truth it
[1:48:15] has to devolve down into an unbelief or
[1:48:18] a falsehood Dogma and that's where
[1:48:22] people are today
[1:48:23] this Mark in their foreheads was to mark
[1:48:25] them as believers as those that are
[1:48:29] sighing and crying over the Abominations
[1:48:31] because the land had become so filthy
[1:48:34] and so sinful
[1:48:35] that God was going to destroy those men
[1:48:37] God was going to destroy those people he
[1:48:39] promised never to do the whole earth
[1:48:41] with the with a flood again
[1:48:43] but he never said it would be like we're
[1:48:45] a a city or a or a country or something
[1:48:49] like like Egypt and and like Sodom and
[1:48:52] and now here
[1:48:54] but God is allowing through the
[1:48:57] investigation
[1:49:00] a a measure of pity if you will on those
[1:49:04] that actually believe
[1:49:06] that have that have the character I
[1:49:09] believe that character is what was was
[1:49:12] causing them to to sign crime for the
[1:49:15] Abominations done in the land they were
[1:49:16] sorrowful about it they didn't they
[1:49:18] weren't a part of it they didn't
[1:49:19] participate in it they were sorrowful
[1:49:21] that it was happening the way it was
[1:49:23] happening
[1:49:24] God said Mark those people rest of them
[1:49:26] got destroyed
[1:49:29] amen
[1:49:30] Revelation chapter 7.
[1:49:35] and I want to read a couple of more
[1:49:36] quotes we'll close here
[1:49:45] amen Revelation chapter 7.
[1:49:52] uh verse 1.
[1:50:00] amen and after these things
[1:50:03] I saw four Angels standing on the four
[1:50:06] corner now I have time to go into the
[1:50:09] depth on this we have done it in the
[1:50:10] past before but I just want to hit the
[1:50:12] highlights of this year just for a few
[1:50:14] moments
[1:50:15] and after these things I saw the Four
[1:50:18] Angels standing on the four corners of
[1:50:19] the Earth holding the Four Winds of the
[1:50:22] earth remember the winds is stripes and
[1:50:23] and turmoil
[1:50:25] uh War of the earth and that the wind
[1:50:28] should not blow on the earth nor on the
[1:50:31] sea nor on any tree
[1:50:33] and I saw another Angel ascending from
[1:50:35] the East having the Seal of the Living
[1:50:38] God
[1:50:39] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[1:50:41] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[1:50:43] the earth and the Sea saying hurt not
[1:50:46] the Earth
[1:50:47] neither the seed nor the trees till we
[1:50:49] have sealed the Servants of their gods
[1:50:52] and their foreheads now notice the
[1:50:54] servants are Israel
[1:50:56] the bride is already sealed the bride is
[1:50:58] already gone and God seals those 144
[1:51:02] 000. you can read on after that the
[1:51:05] Servants of God but what's God saying he
[1:51:09] said before you Angels go out and sweep
[1:51:13] across this world
[1:51:14] he said Mark those
[1:51:16] that are the ones that belong to this
[1:51:18] this tribe 144 thousands the servants in
[1:51:22] their foreheads seal them first
[1:51:25] amen so that they receive and know the
[1:51:28] truth the message what is the message
[1:51:30] the message is Jesus Christ amen the
[1:51:33] message isn't brother Branham the
[1:51:35] message is Jesus Christ because it's the
[1:51:37] word revealed to a bride for this last
[1:51:40] day yeah
[1:51:41] Christ the word revealed to us
[1:51:45] now he's showing it to them and brother
[1:51:47] Ram said that would happen he said this
[1:51:49] message would go back to the Jews how is
[1:51:51] it by the revelations of the word
[1:51:53] through Jesus Christ and he comes and
[1:51:55] says where'd you get those scars he says
[1:51:57] in the house of my friends they realized
[1:51:59] that they had crucified their very
[1:52:01] Messiah they put on sack called fashion
[1:52:03] mourn amen before the destruction but
[1:52:07] what was that it was it was
[1:52:09] investigating
[1:52:10] the investigating judgment to make sure
[1:52:13] now people don't understand what's going
[1:52:15] on in this world today what's happening
[1:52:17] all around us people are in turmoil
[1:52:19] because they don't they don't see the
[1:52:22] government and and people taking
[1:52:25] pictures all over the place
[1:52:29] let me read you this
[1:52:31] in The Sixth Seal and then I want to
[1:52:34] read one more quote we'll close I'm
[1:52:35] going to skip a couple things here
[1:52:37] in The Sixth Seal
[1:52:40] another man says what if it what if you
[1:52:42] would place it want to get the word
[1:52:46] he said now I don't want to ask you a
[1:52:49] question
[1:52:51] so on and so forth he said now he said
[1:52:53] now this is the time of the
[1:52:57] investigation judgment
[1:53:00] this is
[1:53:02] 1963. he said 60 years ago he said this
[1:53:07] now he says is the investigating
[1:53:10] judgment now what's he talking about
[1:53:13] investigating judgment we'll see here
[1:53:20] Christ revealed in his own word
[1:53:22] he said you see these little pockets
[1:53:25] again cameras everywhere now
[1:53:28] cameras and people's cars uh taking
[1:53:31] pictures while they're driving there's
[1:53:33] cameras on every street corner and every
[1:53:35] major city there's there's cameras in
[1:53:38] everybody's hands videos pictures and
[1:53:41] their phones uh there's cameras videos
[1:53:44] stuff all over the place now that can be
[1:53:47] taken almost at any angle there can't
[1:53:50] hardly be anything done today even if
[1:53:53] it's done by surprise that's in a major
[1:53:55] Metropolis that is not videoed there are
[1:53:58] so many video cameras out today
[1:54:01] they see even
[1:54:04] plane crashes and things that are
[1:54:06] totally unexpected I saw uh that U.S
[1:54:11] Airways when that plane landed in the
[1:54:13] Hudson they had pictures of that just
[1:54:15] because his pictures there's cameras
[1:54:17] shooting outside of these high-rises in
[1:54:20] New York City you can see the plane
[1:54:22] going across and getting ready to land
[1:54:24] into the Hudson River
[1:54:26] I mean who would have known to stand
[1:54:27] there I mean could you imagine somebody
[1:54:29] standing and say there's going to be a
[1:54:31] plane crash in the Hudson River today
[1:54:32] let's stay here so we can video it
[1:54:35] but there's so many cameras now today it
[1:54:37] doesn't matter it's surprised or not it
[1:54:39] gets videoed and they're everywhere
[1:54:42] but the biggest thing is coming I think
[1:54:44] from the military a lot of military and
[1:54:47] commercial pilots are noticing and
[1:54:50] seeing the heightened activity of these
[1:54:53] saucers of these little unexplained
[1:54:55] phenomena all over the country all over
[1:54:58] the world
[1:54:59] and they're seeing it and people used to
[1:55:01] call them nuts but there's so many of
[1:55:03] them now crazy there's so many of them
[1:55:05] now that they can't they're they're not
[1:55:07] dismissing it anymore they're having
[1:55:09] hearings in Congress and and and and and
[1:55:13] whistleblowers and all this stomach uh
[1:55:15] stuff coming out this stuff is real it's
[1:55:18] beyond our human capabilities oh of
[1:55:20] course it is yeah
[1:55:23] yeah the prophet told us 60 years ago
[1:55:25] what it was yeah but you won't believe
[1:55:28] right you see these little pockets going
[1:55:31] through the air they call saucers so
[1:55:34] forth
[1:55:35] well he said we better leave that alone
[1:55:37] he doesn't of course which he does quite
[1:55:41] a few times we probably should leave
[1:55:42] that alone then he doesn't here and out
[1:55:45] these people come up missing you say
[1:55:48] don't hear from them they're standing
[1:55:50] here they're standing there he said
[1:55:51] that's the way the Rapture is going to
[1:55:53] be
[1:55:55] one of them would drop right down and
[1:55:57] it's uh and this terrestrial body will
[1:56:00] take on a Celestial body and there won't
[1:56:03] be hiding her hair or bone left
[1:56:06] praise God
[1:56:07] he said that's the way the Rapture is
[1:56:09] going to be
[1:56:10] it'll be transformed in the moment of
[1:56:13] time dropping right out of space and
[1:56:16] taking home
[1:56:17] that we all see now in the Pentagon
[1:56:19] wondering about these lights and these
[1:56:21] Mystic lights and area

[1:56:39] little aliens hanging all over the place
[1:56:41] little green things blown up and statues

[1:56:46] my goodness what did I walk into
[1:56:49] this and and because it's so close to
[1:56:51] area 51. it's just it's just a marketing
[1:56:55] gimmick but the truth of it is those

[1:57:39] hard hair bone left
[1:57:41] it's just going to sweep down and pick

[1:57:45] judgment that's taking place now around
[1:57:48] the world and people don't know it it's
[1:57:50] getting such notoriety today and I've
[1:57:53] seen some of them I've seen some of the
[1:57:55] videos that like a military jet would
[1:57:58] lock in on and that thing is just
[1:58:00] just screaming across the sky I've seen
[1:58:04] them where they're in the air now I
[1:58:07] don't know all the what they show is
[1:58:09] real or not some people fake things but
[1:58:11] I believe I know this is real though
[1:58:13] because it's that brother Brown said it
[1:58:16] was real investigating judgment
[1:58:18] and and they'll just they'll scream
[1:58:20] across the sky and they'll stop and
[1:58:22] they'll hover there and move over here
[1:58:23] and go around and I've seen I've seen a
[1:58:26] video one time where one I believe was
[1:58:28] in San Diego that one was coming across
[1:58:31] the ocean all of a sudden it just stood
[1:58:32] there and it just went down into the
[1:58:34] water

[1:58:38] where'd it go
[1:58:40] you know
[1:58:42] but men can't explain it but thank God
[1:58:45] for a prophet
[1:58:46] amen who told us what it was so that we
[1:58:50] could know what it was amen
[1:58:52] praise the Lord
[1:58:54] the only Escape we have friend is that
[1:58:58] is the holy spirit amen look let me I am
[1:59:02] going to read this real quick just this
[1:59:03] one point in the Seal of God he said
[1:59:07] when the plagues was coming now again in
[1:59:11] in in Egypt only thing was protected was
[1:59:15] those who were sealed away in the
[1:59:17] Kingdom
[1:59:18] that is the investigating judgment the
[1:59:21] only thing that protects is those that
[1:59:24] are sealed away
[1:59:26] remember the only thing that protects
[1:59:28] you today what is our protection our
[1:59:30] protection is the Holy Spirit what is

[1:59:47] we are those that God has bought and
[1:59:50] purchased and belonged to him and it's
[1:59:52] time for this Friday I believe we're
[1:59:55] right at him this bride to go home yes
[1:59:58] and we see it going on more now than
[2:00:00] ever now I didn't I I didn't I didn't
[2:00:04] talk about the uh plethora of cameras as
[2:00:08] being as
[2:00:10] diminishing the heightened activity
[2:00:13] I didn't mean to say that because of so
[2:00:16] many cameras we're catching it more now
[2:00:17] they're the heightened activity is there
[2:00:20] as well there's more and more and more
[2:00:22] of it going on not just people seeing it
[2:00:25] not just those things happening but more
[2:00:28] and more of it's happening friend and
[2:00:30] where are we now
[2:00:31] at the in the Middle Brother random said
[2:00:33] 60 years ago we are now in the middle of
[2:00:35] investigating judgment yes how many more
[2:00:39] warnings is God going to give before he
[2:00:42] takes this bride home and wipes this
[2:00:44] place clean
[2:00:46] how many more
[2:00:48] we don't know
[2:00:49] but or if I could just give another
[2:00:51] person something that they could hold on
[2:00:54] to that that will help them escape the
[2:00:58] wrath that's about to come to help them
[2:01:00] escape a burning hell but
[2:01:03] it's our responsibility to do so yes
[2:01:06] help us to be able to do it
[2:01:08] amen I
[2:01:09] don't anybody go that way but right now
[2:01:12] friend we're in we're in with this
[2:01:13] investigating judgment Congress they
[2:01:15] don't know what's going on news they
[2:01:17] don't know what's going on President
[2:01:18] they don't know what's going on
[2:01:20] these people have no idea
[2:01:22] military sees it commercial Jets see it
[2:01:25] people take videos of it they show it on
[2:01:28] cameras and stuff they don't know what
[2:01:30] it is
[2:01:31] thank God we do
[2:01:33] we know what's happening because we're
[2:01:35] at this end
[2:01:37] the evening time brings life amen that
[2:01:40] light is shining upon a bride
[2:01:43] that that it reveals
[2:01:46] what God is doing remember God said to
[2:01:50] Abraham will I withhold from him what
[2:01:52] I'm about to do a friend can I say this
[2:01:56] will God withhold from his bride what
[2:02:00] he's about to do
[2:02:01] look if I was
[2:02:03] me and my wife's been married 38 years
[2:02:05] but that's insignificant actually to the
[2:02:07] point the point is
[2:02:09] if I were going to do something
[2:02:10] significant our home family myself some
[2:02:14] I wouldn't keep her in the dark unless
[2:02:16] it was a surprise party
[2:02:18] I would let her know
[2:02:20] I would want her to be a part of it why
[2:02:22] would God do what he's about to do and
[2:02:24] let this bride be in the dark
[2:02:27] am I not right he's letting he let her
[2:02:30] know through a prophet and is continuing
[2:02:33] to unfold himself through the bride
[2:02:36] that are born again to understand this
[2:02:38] is what this is what's going on today so
[2:02:41] that we know it's not a surprise to us

[2:08:19] of what to do on the 20th the flights
[2:08:22] I'm supposed to leave on the 20th to go
[2:08:24] back to Pennsylvania
[2:08:25] and the flight schedule is just there's
[2:08:30] no flights after one o'clock uh from
[2:08:34] here going there there's just no way to
[2:08:37] get there so
[2:08:39] the choice I have is to cancel church
[2:08:42] or to have it on Saturday night
[2:08:45] which was Tabitha's idea which is a
[2:08:48] great idea the only problem I started
[2:08:50] thinking about it uh because we could
[2:08:52] have had it a little earlier so that it
[2:08:54] didn't get darker people could get home
[2:08:57] uh this place around here on a Saturday
[2:08:59] is not a very good place to be I'm here
[2:09:04] every Saturday as you know are pretty
[2:09:05] much every every other Saturday I come
[2:09:08] set my office study so
[2:09:13] uh I'm here
[2:09:14] mostly on Saturday sometimes till four
[2:09:17] or five o'clock in the afternoon and it
[2:09:19] gets loud around here all the parking's
[2:09:21] taken uh the music from both sides so
[2:09:25] I'm not sure that Saturday is a very
[2:09:28] good option uh it's kind of disruptive
[2:09:31] to be honest sometimes when I come into
[2:09:34] pray on Saturday uh on specifically on
[2:09:38] Saturday I'll bring my near my ear my
[2:09:40] noise canceling earbuds just so I can
[2:09:43] pray just so I don't hear all that
[2:09:46] because it's very distracting to me
[2:09:48] anyway but if anyone has an opinion if
[2:09:52] anybody has a suggestion or something
[2:09:55] um then I'm I'm more than opal open to
[2:09:58] suggestion but it's it's the end of
[2:10:01] August so it's a little ways away but I
[2:10:03] keep checking the flights nothing has
[2:10:05] changed
[2:10:06] um the only one the only one that's even
[2:10:09] close to being an option is there's a
[2:10:11] Delta flight that leaves at one
[2:10:13] and it gets to Harrisburg at midnight
[2:10:16] um uh which is a very difficult
[2:10:19] situation for me but then we'd have to
[2:10:22] start service at like 8 30 in the
[2:10:24] morning
[2:10:25] um so anyway if if anyone has any
[2:10:29] opinions or options thoughts let me know
[2:10:34] I'm open to any suggestions so what's
[2:10:37] wrong about 8 30.
[2:10:40] it's early
[2:10:42] a lot of people have a difficult time
[2:10:44] getting up that early
[2:10:46] in her service
[2:10:48] at 8 30.
[2:10:50] that's the only thing if everybody's up
[2:10:52] for it that's what I'm saying is I'm not
[2:10:54] ruling it out but it's two hours earlier
[2:10:58] than we normally have service
[2:11:01] so and I have had people tell me that
[2:11:03] that's very difficult for them to get up
[2:11:05] that early and get ready to be here on
[2:11:07] time
[2:11:10] anyway so what we'll just we'll just do
[2:11:13] some service but if anybody has a
[2:11:15] something you'd like to share with me
[2:11:17] later or text me or call me or something
[2:11:19] you're welcome to that that would be
[2:11:21] fine all right
[2:11:23] were you going to say something
[2:11:26] sure
[2:11:27] um all right um on the I follow this UFO
[2:11:30] thing for quite a long time
[2:11:32] and I saw a video where the lights would
[2:11:36] disappear and they travel so long or
[2:11:39] random and then they disappear
[2:11:42] and and I remember the scripture that
[2:11:45] says that
[2:11:47] um that this atmosphere above us is
[2:11:51] um the first or second heaven whatever
[2:11:52] you want to call it call it that these
[2:11:55] angels we've got bad ones and we've got
[2:11:58] the good ones and it's all mixed up
[2:12:01] and they've entered and they whatever
[2:12:04] they interview these beings these
[2:12:08] beings
[2:12:10] they never interview the good ones they
[2:12:12] always interview the bad ones and they
[2:12:14] always talk against the scripture
[2:12:16] against things that Christ you mean
[2:12:18] scientists or
[2:12:20] interviews
[2:12:23] [Music]
[2:12:26] and they interview them and and they
[2:12:29] speak against the interview
[2:12:32] extraterrestrials and they speak against
[2:12:34] God
[2:12:35] I think those people had too much
[2:12:37] something yeah yeah
[2:12:40] and and so that's and they're trying to
[2:12:43] prepare us for
[2:12:46] and enter uh for a an invasion from
[2:12:49] Aliens that's that they yeah
[2:12:53] anything else and they're trying to
[2:12:56] prepare us for an alien invasion
[2:13:00] um and so we got to really keep our wits
[2:13:03] about us in the word of God
[2:13:05] and with each other so that we can hold
[2:13:07] our head above this fanaticism yeah yeah
[2:13:11] I'm not sure that's even close to any
[2:13:14] influencing in the others but I
[2:13:16] appreciate that uh George Luke has got
[2:13:18] very rich off of that you know Star Wars
[2:13:21] and stuff but yeah this
[2:13:24] you're right there's a lot of stuff they
[2:13:27] make up and most of it's just for money
[2:13:29] a lot of them just want money or
[2:13:31] popularity or something terrorism
[2:13:33] usually terrorism
[2:13:37] as for sure but that's she's right it's
[2:13:41] all usually it's all a bunch of
[2:13:43] unbelievers that have no idea what the
[2:13:45] scripture says and what the prophet says
[2:13:48] have any idea so thank God we know yeah
[2:13:52] yeah praise the Lord
[2:13:54] amen so Lord bless you
[2:14:00] and appreciate you each one of you Lord
[2:14:03] Richard bless you amen will be dismissed
