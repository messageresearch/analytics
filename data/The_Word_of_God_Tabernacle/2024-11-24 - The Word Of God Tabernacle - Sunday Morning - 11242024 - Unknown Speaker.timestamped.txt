[55:45] slumped over I couldn't eat I couldn't
[55:48] sit up in my chair hardly and my father
[55:51] looked over at me and he said honey he's
[55:54] so hurt in he didn't plan this he didn't

[56:22] felt like an invasion I was tired I was
[56:26] and I slumped over and I've been slumped
[56:29] over since then well it's been about 50
[56:32] years and I was thinking
[56:35] wow I'll I'll get to that this week the
[56:39] Lord showed me the secret to standing up
[56:42] straight muscles that I have found from
[56:45] time to time that I forget they're there
[56:48] and the Lord has shown me where they are
[56:50] and how to use them and I have been just
[56:54] jubilating
[56:56] because now it it's been it goes it's
[57:00] affected me clear down into my legs and
[57:03] I realize that that I had to stretch out
[57:05] my legs too whole of my body has been
[57:09] just all shriveled up and so I've had to
[57:12] walk and stretch those out and God is
[57:14] showing me and I just walking and it's
[57:16] getting easier and easier every day as
[57:18] those muscles get stronger and stronger
[57:20] and get stretched out and I am just on

[58:43] this day and um we got a lot to be

[59:20] just you know you we need to trust the
[59:23] Lord and for someone like my brother
[59:26] that last
[59:27] song We sang it was messages of the
[59:32] Prophet yes the spoken word recognizing
[59:35] your day and it's
[59:39] a Honor by the grace of God that he

[59:47] foundation of the world Amen that we
[59:49] were always a part of him yes amen
[59:52] praise the Lord amen
[59:56] yes I'm thankful especially last week I
[1:00:00] was going to the laundry room and all of
[1:00:03] a
[1:00:04] sudden um I don't know what happened but
[1:00:08] I lost my footing and I was on the
[1:00:11] ground before I knew it and um I
[1:00:14] realized I really hurt my left
[1:00:18] shoulder
[1:00:19] and my I was happy I at least I didn't
[1:00:24] hit the ground with my face M but U I'm
[1:00:27] grateful to God because it could been a
[1:00:29] lot worse amen and I couldn't even lift
[1:00:32] my arm last Saturday now
[1:00:36] that amen praise the Lord but uh it does
[1:00:40] hurt
[1:00:42] but I am so grateful that it wasn't even
[1:00:46] much worse amen yes praise the
[1:00:49] Lord
[1:00:53] amen I just want to say how thankful I
[1:00:55] am great family for how God cares about
[1:00:58] me so much all the
[1:01:01] blessings
[1:01:04] everything it's just amaz see pered amen
[1:01:09] my
[1:01:10] life amen praise the Lord
[1:01:26] anybody
[1:01:28] else I have my own mic so just quick
[1:01:33] always thankful for the many gifts that
[1:01:36] God has given me throughout my life and
[1:01:38] that I can use it for him and for others
[1:01:40] and in and at the church and just be a
[1:01:43] witness and anyone ask you how long you
[1:01:45] can take be
[1:01:46] lesson never um and it it always opens
[1:01:51] doors that otherwise probably wouldn't
[1:01:53] have been able to be open right amen
[1:01:56] and just to Echo what everyone else has
[1:01:59] said just keeping keeping me safe
[1:02:00] keeping me healthy um I mean flu cold Co
[1:02:05] it's all been around for years and years
[1:02:07] and years and the Lord's protected me
[1:02:10] even when I've been around people who
[1:02:12] contracted it amen on airplanes and
[1:02:14] whatever yes keeping me safe driving
[1:02:16] there's been two fatal accidents on my
[1:02:19] street this week somehow um and one
[1:02:24] happened shortly before I arrived
[1:02:26] there's just so many things that we
[1:02:27] don't even know or see that the Lord
[1:02:29] overse just thankful for everything
[1:02:33] amen praise the Lord so very true never
[1:02:37] really thought about that I know I've
[1:02:41] we've always known that's his parents
[1:02:43] and son that you know it's and him he
[1:02:45] knows now it's the Lord in his life give
[1:02:48] that gift to be able to dis playay um
[1:02:51] but never even thought about that as
[1:02:54] that being such a witness to
[1:02:56] people come and say well you know did
[1:02:58] you take lessons no how'd you learn well
[1:03:00] the Lord taught me that opens up doors
[1:03:02] to be able to talk to people about the
[1:03:04] Lord and uh that you might not normally
[1:03:08] have except for that so uh I never even
[1:03:11] saw it that way so amen I I look at this
[1:03:15] as uh a lot of people a lot of times
[1:03:17] take a a new year to make New Year's
[1:03:20] resolutions and that kind of thing but
[1:03:22] to me uh the Reckoning to to me is this
[1:03:27] this time of year right now because this
[1:03:30] is the time as a
[1:03:31] Christian most nominal people would
[1:03:34] think you know the year's up January 1
[1:03:37] is here and you know it's time to turn
[1:03:39] over a new leaf and but to me
[1:03:41] Thanksgiving is that time Thanksgiving
[1:03:44] is that time that we thank God for what
[1:03:46] God has done for us and where he's
[1:03:48] brought us from and what he's brought us
[1:03:50] through and the thanksgivings of
[1:03:52] everything that the Lord has done for us
[1:03:54] for the year that's what this holiday is
[1:03:56] really supposed to be about brother bam
[1:03:58] said this is only this is the only true
[1:04:01] holiday America has left is Thanksgiving
[1:04:04] and and I believe it's because it goes
[1:04:06] back to the foundation of our nation and
[1:04:09] how we were founded and how we were how
[1:04:12] we how those that came here and started
[1:04:14] this country were thankful for what the
[1:04:16] Lord had given them from where they came
[1:04:18] from to where they were and the the the
[1:04:21] freedom to worship God the freedom to
[1:04:23] serve God and live for God and it used
[1:04:26] to be a time where you could have uh
[1:04:28] prayer meetings and bible studies in
[1:04:30] schools uh because people were so
[1:04:33] thankful it's changed a lot now because
[1:04:35] it's become more of a freedom from
[1:04:37] religion than freedom of religion but um
[1:04:40] I I don't mind being freedom from
[1:04:42] religion though because it's Jesus
[1:04:44] Christ not religion that saved me that's
[1:04:45] right but um it's but this is that time
[1:04:48] of year for me amen that that time of
[1:04:51] Reckoning that time of of resolution
[1:04:54] that time of thankfulness to thank God
[1:04:57] uh I know we got another little over a
[1:05:00] month left in our calendar year but
[1:05:02] again to me this is the time of
[1:05:05] thankfulness that we have and that's why
[1:05:08] it means a lot to me um to have uh my
[1:05:12] family and my friends and people that I
[1:05:14] know around and and just the warmth of
[1:05:17] it all to me just creates a whole
[1:05:19] different type spirit I was listen to a
[1:05:22] message listening to something brother
[1:05:24] BR was saying the other day he said
[1:05:26] uh he was sending greetings and holiday
[1:05:28] greetings Christmas greetings uh God
[1:05:30] exactly said he really enjoys that time
[1:05:33] of year uh where everybody says God
[1:05:36] bless you and Merry Christmas and uh
[1:05:39] they're all thankful and they're all
[1:05:41] happy and they're all uh they're all
[1:05:43] putting the Lord Jesus in the Forefront
[1:05:47] uh he said I wish it was that way all
[1:05:48] year long unfortunately is not but uh
[1:05:51] that to me is this time of year this
[1:05:54] this time of thankfulness to to be
[1:05:56] thankful and to thank God for it amen
[1:05:59] the things that may have like brother
[1:06:01] Danny said something that was very
[1:06:02] immediate uh or something that that has
[1:06:05] the Lord has done all through the years
[1:06:08] like uh uh Opening Our Eyes to this
[1:06:10] truth yes the revelation of God's word
[1:06:13] bringing us along in him helping us to
[1:06:16] grow in the Lord and uh all the the
[1:06:19] healings and the strengthenings and the
[1:06:21] comforting and the blessings that God's
[1:06:22] give us um it just uh it just
[1:06:26] accumulates to the point that it just
[1:06:27] becomes more uh uh more than a person
[1:06:31] can handle sometimes or even verbalized
[1:06:35] uh but we try to do it the best we can
[1:06:37] fortunately God knows our hearts and as
[1:06:40] he knows our hearts he knows what's in
[1:06:42] our hearts and how we feel towards him
[1:06:44] amen so praise the Lord I uh as as far
[1:06:48] as giving testimony I can't even begin
[1:06:50] to think
[1:06:53] I I I'll have to have a new language
[1:06:55] before I can start thanking God
[1:06:57] appropriately uh for what he's done for
[1:06:59] me so um thank you Lord
[1:07:03] Jesus biggest thing I can say Amen I'm
[1:07:06] I'm so thankful uh you know there's this
[1:07:10] uh article going around this writer uh
[1:07:14] that is trying to put put a shade on the
[1:07:19] message try to make it look bad and make
[1:07:21] it look like a some kind of cult which
[1:07:25] on the
[1:07:26] video we
[1:07:27] are truth of the matter is if you go
[1:07:30] along the lines of what the government
[1:07:32] determines as a cult we are a cult uh
[1:07:36] but so is pretty much every other
[1:07:39] organization type like it right me if
[1:07:41] you follow along the guidelines of what
[1:07:44] they call a cult and you read the Bible
[1:07:46] you realize Jesus was a cult too uh so I
[1:07:50] don't necessarily see that uh as the
[1:07:53] government as the world I guess is
[1:07:55] painted that as a bad word uh but if you
[1:07:58] look at the definition it's really just
[1:08:01] us of likeminded people coming together
[1:08:03] and worshiping together and and like
[1:08:06] Precious Faith together Worship the Lord
[1:08:08] Jesus but in the in the day that we live
[1:08:11] we can see um uh H how people look at
[1:08:16] things and when they look at things like
[1:08:18] this some people read that AR it's like
[1:08:20] that book that Billy Paul gave that
[1:08:23] testimony uh of the man who was trying
[1:08:26] to share the message to another man and
[1:08:29] he gave him a book and he brought read
[1:08:31] the book brought the book back and said
[1:08:33] don't you ever give me anything by that
[1:08:35] man again he said well what's wrong with
[1:08:37] he said well that man in that book
[1:08:39] called me a
[1:08:40] buzzard and the guy took the book back
[1:08:43] from me and said well that's funny
[1:08:44] because the same guy in the same book
[1:08:45] called me an
[1:08:47] eagle so some people are going to read
[1:08:50] those articles and they're going to see
[1:08:51] oh how horrible and how terrible and and
[1:08:54] all when I when I look at it uh I say
[1:08:58] well praise the
[1:09:00] Lord amen uh because we know all hell is
[1:09:05] against this teaching right we know that
[1:09:08] and one of the greatest affirmations I
[1:09:11] know of that this message is the truth
[1:09:15] is all the hell that comes against it
[1:09:17] yes that's one of the best ways you can
[1:09:19] know if it's of the Devil he's not going
[1:09:22] to do anything about it he's just going
[1:09:24] to let it go on I mean you look at the
[1:09:27] the things that they talk about uh the
[1:09:29] dress and the the scripture hair and uh
[1:09:33] how we live our lives and how we conduct
[1:09:35] ourselves and how we're modest in things
[1:09:38] and uh and and they put a shadow on that
[1:09:43] like like that's just that's not that's
[1:09:45] not right you you you shouldn't live
[1:09:48] like that and there's religions in this
[1:09:51] world that uh women can't show any more
[1:09:54] than their balls they'll get stoned
[1:09:57] right but yet they come you know why cuz
[1:10:02] all Hells against this teaching yes and
[1:10:04] the best one of the greatest uh
[1:10:07] affirmations I know of is how hard the
[1:10:12] Devil Comes against this yes that that
[1:10:15] as much as anything uh almost as much as
[1:10:19] anything proves to me this is the truth
[1:10:22] or he wouldn't come against it so hard
[1:10:25] amen and who knows somebody might read
[1:10:28] those articles and get curious and come
[1:10:30] to a church or look it up and say wow I
[1:10:33] don't know what he's talking about this
[1:10:34] is the best thing I've ever seen this is
[1:10:36] wonderful fill the spirit and hear the
[1:10:38] word and amen cuz if that seed is in
[1:10:42] there it may be what gets that one last
[1:10:44] seed praise the Lord anyway that's my
[1:10:47] thing let's go could we stand to our
[1:10:48] feet let's go to First
[1:10:52] Chronicles I do have a little message I

[1:14:04] Chronicles chap
[1:14:06] 15 verse 29 it came to pass as the Ark
[1:14:10] of the Covenant of the Lord came to the
[1:14:12] city of David that Mel the daughter of
[1:14:14] Saul looking out at a window out of a
[1:14:17] window saw King David dancing and
[1:14:20] playing and she despised him in her
[1:14:23] heart so they brought the Ark of God and
[1:14:26] set it in the midst of the tent that
[1:14:28] David had pitched for it and they
[1:14:30] offered burnt sacrifices and peace
[1:14:32] offerings before God and then David had
[1:14:36] made an end of and when David had made
[1:14:38] an end of offering the burnt offerings
[1:14:40] and the peace offerings he blessed the
[1:14:42] people in the name of the Lord and He
[1:14:45] dealt to everyone of Israel both man and
[1:14:47] woman to everyone of uh everyone a loaf
[1:14:50] of bread a good piece of Flesh and a
[1:14:53] flagen of wine he appointed certain of
[1:14:56] the Levites to minister before the Ark
[1:14:59] of the Lord and to record and to thank
[1:15:02] and to praise the Lord God of Israel
[1:15:05] Asaf the chief and next to him Zachariah
[1:15:09] J and shimo moth and jahel and mathani
[1:15:16] and leab and beniah and OED Edom and JL
[1:15:21] with salt trees and with Harps but ASF
[1:15:24] made a sound with symbols sound like a
[1:15:28] great Revival amen banah also and Je uh
[1:15:33] jeziel the priests uh with trumpets
[1:15:37] continually with trumpets continually
[1:15:40] before the Ark of the Covenant of God
[1:15:42] then on that day David delivered first
[1:15:45] this PSAL to thank the Lord into the
[1:15:48] hand of EZ uh ASF and his Brethren give
[1:15:52] thanks unto the Lord call upon his name
[1:15:55] make known his deeds among the People
[1:15:58] Sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk
[1:16:02] ye all of his wondrous Works Glory ye in
[1:16:06] His holy name let the heart of them
[1:16:08] Rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord
[1:16:12] and his strength seek his face
[1:16:15] continually remember His Marvelous works
[1:16:18] that he hath done his wonders and the
[1:16:21] judgments of his mouth oh ye seed of
[1:16:24] Israel Israel his servant ye children of
[1:16:27] Jacob his chosen ones he he is the Lord
[1:16:31] Our God his judgments are in all the
[1:16:34] Earth be mindful always of his Covenant
[1:16:39] the word which he commanded to a
[1:16:42] thousand Generations praise the Lord you
[1:16:45] can be seated if you'd
[1:16:47] like all this worship all of this praise
[1:16:50] coming from the Israelites thankful
[1:16:56] thankful of what God had done it had
[1:16:58] been the the Ark of the Covenant had
[1:17:00] been captured by the enemy God gave
[1:17:03] David leave to go take that uh Ark back
[1:17:06] it ended up in the house of OED Edom and
[1:17:09] the house of OED Edom was blessed but
[1:17:11] now the ark was being returned back to
[1:17:13] the city of David to its rightful
[1:17:16] position amen so when David and and the
[1:17:20] Israelites were worshiping when they
[1:17:22] were celebrating they were doing it
[1:17:25] because the the word of God was being
[1:17:27] restored back to its rightful position
[1:17:30] to its rightful place David danced
[1:17:34] before the Lord with all of his might in
[1:17:37] worship and In Praise because of the
[1:17:39] thankfulness he had of God bringing that
[1:17:42] word back god making the way because
[1:17:45] it's always God Amen God uses us but
[1:17:49] it's always God that does it amen it's
[1:17:52] never us we are just the instruments
[1:17:54] that God uses to bring these things to
[1:17:57] about but it's God that does it God's Le
[1:18:00] leadership God's guidance God's
[1:18:02] provision God's Health God's strength
[1:18:05] God's blessings are always what is put
[1:18:07] in place for the things that God wants
[1:18:10] done to be done and the blessings that
[1:18:12] God had given them to be able to bring
[1:18:14] the ark back to where it was supposed to
[1:18:16] be to bring and restore the word back to
[1:18:20] its rightful position oh my to think
[1:18:23] about uh the word being restored to his
[1:18:25] rightful position how ought we to be a
[1:18:27] people of C celebration how we ought to
[1:18:31] be a people of thankfulness of God
[1:18:33] restoring back to order the word back in
[1:18:36] its rightful position again they poked
[1:18:39] at it they proded at it that uh God give
[1:18:42] a little light here and a little light
[1:18:44] there down Through the Ages amen and and
[1:18:47] each reformer that came uh that came up
[1:18:50] had a little bit of light had a little
[1:18:52] bit more to shed had a little bit more
[1:18:54] to share had a little bit more to bring
[1:18:56] as God revealed it we come up through a
[1:18:58] state of justification into a state of
[1:19:01] sanctification into a place of the gifts
[1:19:04] of the Spirit the Holy Ghost being
[1:19:06] released upon the people again we come
[1:19:08] through an Open Door through
[1:19:10] Philadelphia we come into a place of
[1:19:12] missionary we came to a time where the
[1:19:15] word was being spread abroad across the
[1:19:17] world internationally we came into a
[1:19:20] time where it came over into this land
[1:19:22] which at one time wasn't even a land
[1:19:25] if you notice you see the old Maps back
[1:19:27] from years ago uh America didn't exist
[1:19:32] the map was just a map of Israel and
[1:19:34] what was around it that's all there was
[1:19:36] that's all men knew but there was a time
[1:19:38] that came that God unfolded to bring
[1:19:41] about a time where people would come to
[1:19:43] this country where men would come with
[1:19:45] the word of God where they would go up
[1:19:47] and down Coast to uh uh along the coast
[1:19:51] uh preaching uh the word of God bringing
[1:19:54] the good writings of God it was said I
[1:19:56] think it was um U oh boy I knew I was
[1:20:00] going to forget his name that that that
[1:20:03] preached so
[1:20:04] forcefully he was in Philadelphia one
[1:20:07] time that he preached so forcefully that
[1:20:09] people blocks away could hear the
[1:20:12] message as it was being preached you
[1:20:14] think the amplification I'm a loud
[1:20:16] person but I can't imagine my voice
[1:20:19] amplifying to the place of being able to
[1:20:21] heard blocks away see that's God
[1:20:23] bringing that about
[1:20:25] I got the statistics one time of Charles
[1:20:29] uh um all
[1:20:33] the the the
[1:20:36] reformer uh Charles Charles finny was it
[1:20:40] Charles finny anyway Road Road his motor
[1:20:43] Transportation was a horse and I if I
[1:20:47] remember right the statistics of how
[1:20:49] many sermons he preached would be the
[1:20:52] equivalent of like 30 mess mesages a
[1:20:55] week that he preached in his life over a
[1:20:58] 50-year period riding on the back of a
[1:21:00] horse right uh the numbers of times that
[1:21:04] he spoke and that he preached uh to
[1:21:07] bring about the the the word to people
[1:21:10] up and down the country up up and down
[1:21:13] the coast to bring to people the word of
[1:21:16] God see it it took that that God God
[1:21:19] made the way it wasn't those men it was
[1:21:22] God giving strength it was God giving
[1:21:25] ability it was God giving away
[1:21:29] Provisions God is the one that always
[1:21:31] takes care of it amen God is always if
[1:21:35] he's got something he wants to get done
[1:21:37] he brings it about and God made a way to
[1:21:40] be able to bring this Arc this word back
[1:21:43] to where it was supposed to be right and
[1:21:45] all through that time as they poked and
[1:21:48] proded and brought this word it had to
[1:21:51] take in this last day that's what makes
[1:21:53] us understand know as much as anything
[1:21:56] that this is the last day friend that
[1:21:58] the
[1:22:00] last man was not a reformer a prophet a
[1:22:03] word Prophet Amen to bring a truth of
[1:22:07] this message of this word to a people we
[1:22:10] call the message a truth of this word to
[1:22:14] a people to that that she might take
[1:22:17] that word and that that word would would
[1:22:19] clothe her yes and would uh speak to her
[1:22:23] and reform her and bring her to a place
[1:22:26] of rapturing faith if rapturing faith is
[1:22:29] in this message amen then that's what we
[1:22:32] need yes praise the Lord that's what we
[1:22:34] need if we're looking to go in a Rapture
[1:22:36] yes that's what they needed that's what
[1:22:38] they were looking for David set them
[1:22:40] aside and he set different men in
[1:22:43] different positions they played
[1:22:45] instruments they danced before the Lord
[1:22:47] they worshiped God they celebrated they
[1:22:50] praised and gave thanks to the Lord even
[1:22:52] to the point that David said he
[1:22:55] delivered his Psalm and he said unto
[1:22:57] these men write these down Amen to
[1:23:02] record is what it says to record to make
[1:23:06] sure that they understand through
[1:23:08] posterity through years and years
[1:23:11] thousands of years now that this story
[1:23:13] will still be told yes of what God did
[1:23:17] yes and recognize what God still does
[1:23:21] amen and restoring that word he was
[1:23:24] thankful they were thankful for the
[1:23:27] restoration of the word what ought we to
[1:23:29] be Saints amen we should be thankful for
[1:23:32] the restoration of the word that God has
[1:23:35] brought that word back to us amen being
[1:23:39] thankful sometimes Lord help us we go
[1:23:42] through life and life hits Us in the
[1:23:44] face
[1:23:46] and gives us a broken arm broken leg
[1:23:48] black eye many times but God always is
[1:23:52] there with us to help us along nurse
[1:23:54] back and to bring us along and but
[1:23:56] through those times sometimes uh we
[1:23:59] can't lose sight of uh of of the
[1:24:03] thankfulness that we have towards God
[1:24:05] for the blessings that he's give us
[1:24:08] right amen always being thankful never
[1:24:12] let the thankfulness go away let's go
[1:24:14] over to St Luke like I said I I I plan
[1:24:17] on this not being very long today but St
[1:24:19] Luke chapter 17
[1:24:25] St Luke
[1:24:27] 17:1 story brother Dennis probably I
[1:24:30] think he mentions this story many times
[1:24:32] and uh in his prayers he didn't today
[1:24:35] but he has mentioned this many times and
[1:24:39] as I was looking things I thought this
[1:24:41] was this this would be a perfect story
[1:24:43] let's go over it uh uh St Luke
[1:24:49] 17:1 it came to pass as he went to
[1:24:53] Jerusalem that he passed through the
[1:24:55] midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he
[1:24:58] entered into a certain Village there met
[1:25:01] him 10 men that were lepers which stood
[1:25:03] AAR off they lifted up their voices and
[1:25:06] said Jesus Master have mercy on us and
[1:25:12] when he saw them he said unto them go
[1:25:15] show thy so show yourselves unto the
[1:25:19] priest and it came to pass that as they
[1:25:22] went they were cleansed now that's a
[1:25:24] kind of an unusual uh way of doing it
[1:25:27] but God knows exactly how to do it and
[1:25:31] when to do it and who to do it to and um
[1:25:34] he didn't tell him to come here he
[1:25:36] didn't say let me lay hands on you uh he
[1:25:40] just said just go show yourself to the
[1:25:42] priest amen amen but as they were
[1:25:45] walking to go show themselves to the
[1:25:47] priest that's when they received their
[1:25:50] healing they received their healing on
[1:25:53] the journey
[1:25:54] on the road as they were traveling as
[1:25:57] they put feet uh footsteps to their to
[1:26:01] their uh to the to the truth to the to
[1:26:04] the message to the uh what Jesus told
[1:26:06] them they put it they put themselves in
[1:26:08] action amen go and do this now that
[1:26:12] seems odd some people would probably
[1:26:15] think that well it's crazy why would I
[1:26:17] go do that uh I I I want to be relieved
[1:26:20] of this but they were obedient and they
[1:26:23] did what he said and as they were going
[1:26:25] to go show themselves that's when they
[1:26:27] were cleansed praise the Lord in their
[1:26:30] Journey on their walk is when they got
[1:26:33] healed amen yes didn't have to lay hands
[1:26:36] on didn't have to say thus sayith the
[1:26:38] Lord didn't say of
[1:26:41] course it wasn't at a time for it yet
[1:26:44] but no by your stripes or it it was just
[1:26:47] go show yourselves to the priest and on
[1:26:50] their Journey they were
[1:26:52] healed healing at healing is that simple
[1:26:55] Saints yes yes you see so many different
[1:26:59] manifestations of healings in the
[1:27:01] scripture probably even in our lives
[1:27:04] that we've seen and have been a part of
[1:27:07] you look at in the scripture say well
[1:27:08] why did he do one this way why did he do
[1:27:11] them this way why did he say this to
[1:27:14] them why did he take the dirt and put it
[1:27:16] on his eyes why did some he lay hands on
[1:27:20] why did one woman get just because she
[1:27:22] touched the Hem of His G
[1:27:25] right why did some lay hands why is some
[1:27:28] walked all around everybody else and
[1:27:29] went to one person right why did he just
[1:27:32] tell one your faith has healed
[1:27:35] you why there it's it's a it's a myriad
[1:27:39] of of different ways that people gain
[1:27:42] healing in the
[1:27:44] scripture it's not God the healing is
[1:27:48] already there God has already performed
[1:27:50] it for us now of course after the death
[1:27:53] burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:27:55] We Know by his stripes we are healed
[1:27:57] it's different when Jesus walked around
[1:27:59] he was healing amen but now we know see
[1:28:03] we know that God doesn't changed the
[1:28:06] healing is already there whatever you
[1:28:08] have need of is already there it depends
[1:28:11] on us amen what do we need what does it
[1:28:15] what does it take for us to be able to
[1:28:17] get to a place that we're going to
[1:28:19] believe yes does it take go show the
[1:28:22] priest does does it take a laying on of
[1:28:25] hands does it take a a proclamation of a
[1:28:29] prayer does it take uh a minister does
[1:28:33] it take a pastor does it take anybody
[1:28:37] Ley family member anybody coming up and
[1:28:42] saying I feel inspired to pray for you
[1:28:44] what does it take whatever it takes to
[1:28:47] bring that spark of faith for you to
[1:28:49] receive what you're looking for that's
[1:28:51] what God instructs us brings us along to
[1:28:53] do
[1:28:55] God knew Jesus knew obviously these 10
[1:28:59] as they come up and were lepers what he
[1:29:02] gave them instruction they would do but
[1:29:05] now the rest of the story is kind of
[1:29:08] confusing because they were cleansed but
[1:29:11] only one of them come back to thank him
[1:29:14] right 15th verse and one of them when he
[1:29:19] saw that he was healed turned back and
[1:29:22] with a loud voice glorified God now
[1:29:24] where were the rest of them right where
[1:29:27] were the other nine was there a
[1:29:30] discussion I'm assuming if the 10 were
[1:29:33] together the 10 were walking together to
[1:29:35] go to the priest that was Jesus
[1:29:38] instruction go show yourselves to the
[1:29:40] priest well if the 10 were together here
[1:29:43] don't you figure I figured that the 10
[1:29:45] were walking together was there a
[1:29:49] discussion did they all look at each
[1:29:51] other and they said your leprosy is gone
[1:29:54] did they look at their hands did they
[1:29:56] look at their bodies did they look at
[1:29:58] each other's faces and say wow you're
[1:30:01] healed you don't have leprosy on your
[1:30:04] face anymore you don't have oh look at
[1:30:06] my hands my hands I'm heal we're all
[1:30:09] healed imagine all 10 of them I would
[1:30:12] think that all 10 of them were standing
[1:30:14] there as they got healing glorified was
[1:30:17] was was was standing there together uh
[1:30:20] saying we're all
[1:30:22] healed but only one of them turned
[1:30:26] around and went
[1:30:27] back I I did the other nine say hey
[1:30:30] where you going Bob where you
[1:30:32] headed that's not a very Jewish name but
[1:30:34] anyway he was a Samaritan but uh where
[1:30:37] you
[1:30:38] going I'm I'm going back to thank the
[1:30:40] one that we got healing from yeah amen
[1:30:45] amen did they think it was just a
[1:30:48] coincidence did they think it was just
[1:30:51] uh uh something that happened
[1:30:55] maybe something they ate or
[1:30:57] drank you know people say well I did go
[1:31:00] to the doctor the other day they gave me
[1:31:02] this medicine now I feel
[1:31:05] better I and dandy but who healed you
[1:31:09] wasn't the doctorine it wasn't a
[1:31:10] medicine yeah amen it was God now God
[1:31:14] may have
[1:31:15] give does so many times move on men
[1:31:19] people women like that doctors to have
[1:31:24] the expertise to be able to help people
[1:31:27] to be able to prescribe things that uh
[1:31:30] that may be a a help but God's the
[1:31:33] Healer great God's the one that has to
[1:31:36] bring the healing not the medicine not
[1:31:38] the doctor right was it a
[1:31:41] coincidence I mean what were they
[1:31:43] thinking only one of them apparently was
[1:31:48] thankful for what Jesus had just done
[1:31:50] for them right only one
[1:31:54] I mean did the maybe there was an a sour
[1:31:57] apple in there that saidwell all he did
[1:31:59] was tell us to go show ourselves to the
[1:32:02] priest how do we know that's the reason
[1:32:05] why we got healed I mean we don't we
[1:32:08] don't know right I do know that it was
[1:32:11] apparently only one person only one of
[1:32:13] the men was thankful right because he
[1:32:17] went back and with a loud voice he
[1:32:20] glorified God right with a loud voice he
[1:32:23] praised God and gave God
[1:32:26] thanks he fell down on his face at Jesus
[1:32:29] feet giving him thanks and he was a
[1:32:34] Samaritan wow where's the other
[1:32:37] guys
[1:32:40] amen being thankful right amen sometimes
[1:32:45] I wonder Saints are we really thankful
[1:32:48] right every day I know Thanksgiving
[1:32:52] and I'm up here and the lord gave me
[1:32:54] songs of thankfulness and Michael was
[1:32:56] singing playing songs of Thanksgiving
[1:32:58] and kind of elicit some uh testimonies
[1:33:01] and things of Thanksgiving and kind of
[1:33:04] builds up in that mode of being thankful
[1:33:07] but how about every day right every
[1:33:11] week all the time of being thankful for
[1:33:14] God and what God's done amen how many
[1:33:18] times a day do we thank do we thank God
[1:33:21] every day right do how many times a day
[1:33:25] do we thank him do we thank him every
[1:33:26] week do we thank him every month how
[1:33:29] often how thankful are we really yes
[1:33:32] amen see because it can be so easy to
[1:33:36] slide us back into that that first
[1:33:39] scripture I read talking about tithe and
[1:33:41] offering and money in the church that's
[1:33:44] that first scripture that I read this is
[1:33:47] it is my strength that got me this
[1:33:49] wealth it is my ability that got me this
[1:33:52] wealth it is it is my knowledge it is my
[1:33:56] expertise it is it is me who got me this
[1:33:59] we does it go back to
[1:34:02] that amen I I I can imagine in our human
[1:34:06] flesh it would be easy to go out and say
[1:34:09] well yeah wow look what I did no look
[1:34:12] what God helped achieve through me amen
[1:34:17] I I I say that several times um uh at
[1:34:22] work and from from the guys if different
[1:34:25] things happen say Well thank the
[1:34:28] Lord amen they're like oh man you were
[1:34:31] lucky I said no I was blessed yeah yeah
[1:34:35] amen there's a difference right I've
[1:34:37] told y'all before I don't even believe
[1:34:38] in luck I don't think there any such
[1:34:40] thing as love when you have a god that
[1:34:43] is orchestrating that is in control of
[1:34:45] every single facet of everything of
[1:34:47] everybody's lives animals uh botney life
[1:34:51] animal life human life inex when God
[1:34:55] when we know that there's a God that
[1:34:57] knows it all it's in control of it all
[1:34:59] How can there be any such thing as luck
[1:35:02] right right to me there can't be that
[1:35:05] can't even exist but that's that's what
[1:35:09] a lot of people say um in in in the in
[1:35:13] the natural working of Life uh this
[1:35:18] happened no it didn't that was God right
[1:35:23] and
[1:35:24] we should
[1:35:25] be understanding enough to acknowledge
[1:35:27] that
[1:35:29] regularly amen amen especially when you
[1:35:32] get over 50 you're like thank you Lord
[1:35:34] for waking me
[1:35:36] up thank you God that I I see daylight
[1:35:41] again amen now I know we're all looking
[1:35:44] to go to a better place but God the the
[1:35:48] the blessing of life is a great blessing
[1:35:51] and to be able to have life and to live
[1:35:53] Our Lives is a great blessing that God
[1:35:56] gives us amen even sometimes when we do
[1:35:59] feel like we're breaking down and uh I
[1:36:03] know brother Dennis got many several
[1:36:05] years on me but man when my knees were
[1:36:08] bad and I was just in constant chronic
[1:36:10] pain from the knees down I felt like I
[1:36:12] was just falling apart and it's amazing
[1:36:16] how good you feel when it doesn't feel
[1:36:18] that way but I'm thankful to God amen
[1:36:21] amen thankful cuz it's his Blessing
[1:36:24] is his healing only one came
[1:36:28] why that's my question why why was there
[1:36:31] only one Jesus said were there not kin
[1:36:34] cleansed but where are the
[1:36:37] nine there are not found that returned
[1:36:40] to give glory to God save this stranger
[1:36:42] because he was a Samaritan and he said
[1:36:45] unto him arise go thy way thy faith has
[1:36:47] made thee whole yeah amen now did the
[1:36:50] other nine lose their
[1:36:52] healing no I would say that I wouldn't
[1:36:54] say they lost their healing no Jesus
[1:36:56] didn't give them their healing just for
[1:36:58] them to be ungrateful and then not and
[1:37:01] then lose it God didn't heal them so
[1:37:03] that they would come and worship him or
[1:37:05] be thankful right he he he gave them
[1:37:08] their healing because it's who he is the
[1:37:11] the worship could come should come as a
[1:37:14] result of Amen praise the lord it's
[1:37:19] like is it's like God taking care of of
[1:37:23] things for
[1:37:25] us and and the positive that comes from
[1:37:29] it is a natural result God healing this
[1:37:33] these men he did because he's God yeah
[1:37:37] them coming back to thank him would just
[1:37:39] been a natural result he didn't do it
[1:37:42] for that but that should have happened
[1:37:45] the thankfulness that they had amen how
[1:37:48] about the Lord's blessings on us amen
[1:37:52] amen how thankful
[1:37:56] we
[1:37:57] amen we as humans so many times we focus
[1:38:01] on the negative and the things that go
[1:38:04] wrong and the things that are bad
[1:38:06] instead of focusing on the good things
[1:38:09] that's another reason I like
[1:38:11] Thanksgiving Thanksgiving
[1:38:13] should elicit in us the desire to think
[1:38:17] on those good things to be thankful for
[1:38:20] those good things those positive things
[1:38:23] amen amen like I said uh in my prayer
[1:38:26] the things that are the things that are
[1:38:28] positive amen amen um you know I I I
[1:38:33] choose to believe in the positive yeah
[1:38:38] amen rather than the negative you say
[1:38:41] well you know my family could all be
[1:38:44] lost they could all be saved right you'd
[1:38:47] rather believe they're all lost or would
[1:38:49] you'd rather believe they're all saved
[1:38:52] right i' rather believe I'm going to
[1:38:54] believe I'm going to have faith to
[1:38:57] believe in prayer that they're all Sav
[1:38:59] amen and to me there's no other
[1:39:02] option that's the way I see it let's go
[1:39:05] over to Romans chapter 14 I got a couple
[1:39:08] more scriptures I want to read just the
[1:39:10] things
[1:39:11] that of thankfulness Romans
[1:39:16] 14 let's begin with the sixth verse
[1:39:24] Romans 14:6 he that regardeth the day
[1:39:28] regardeth it unto the
[1:39:30] Lord and He that regardeth
[1:39:34] U regardeth not the day to the Lord he
[1:39:38] doth not
[1:39:39] regarded he that eateth eateth to the
[1:39:42] Lord for he giveth God thanks that's why
[1:39:46] we well not why that's one reason we ask
[1:39:50] God to bless our food amen and give him
[1:39:53] thanks not just to ask blessing on it
[1:39:55] but give him thanks for it yes for he
[1:39:59] giveth God thanks and he that eateth not
[1:40:01] to the Lord he eateth not and H and and
[1:40:05] giveth God thanks praise the Lord see
[1:40:08] the whole bottom line of it all and
[1:40:10] giveth God thanks and giveth God thanks
[1:40:14] he eat it eats to the Lord he doesn't
[1:40:16] eat it eat it he doesn't eat it to the
[1:40:19] Lord either way he gives God thanks amen
[1:40:22] praise the Lord he regardeth the day
[1:40:24] don't regard a day either way you do it
[1:40:27] as unto the Lord and give God thanks
[1:40:30] praise the Lord for none of us live to
[1:40:33] himself and no man dieth to himself for
[1:40:38] whether we live we live unto the Lord
[1:40:40] whether we die we die unto the Lord
[1:40:42] whether we live therefore or die we are
[1:40:45] the
[1:40:46] Lords yeah for to this end Christ both
[1:40:50] died and Rose and revived that he might
[1:40:54] be Lord both of the dead and living and
[1:40:57] to
[1:40:58] God we give
[1:41:02] thanks
[1:41:04] irregardless we give God thanks
[1:41:06] Ephesians chapter
[1:41:15] 5 Ephesians
[1:41:19] 5:19 Ephesians 5:9 5:19 speaking to
[1:41:23] yourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[1:41:25] spiritual songs singing and making
[1:41:27] melody in your heart to the Lord giving
[1:41:30] thanks always for all things unto God
[1:41:35] and the father in the name of our Lord
[1:41:37] Jesus Christ giving all things all that
[1:41:39] we do all that we do we do in word or In
[1:41:42] Deed we do in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:41:46] giving him
[1:41:48] thanks amen giving him thanks all that
[1:41:50] we do yes we do in the name of the Lord
[1:41:53] Jesus Jesus we do in the name of
[1:41:55] Jesus but we also as we G as we do we
[1:41:59] give thanks give thanks giving thanks
[1:42:02] always for all things unto God and the
[1:42:06] father in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:42:08] Christ first Thessalonians chapter
[1:42:13] 5 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:42:20] 5 being thankful
[1:42:24] amen being
[1:42:29] thankful
[1:42:32] amen 1 Thessalonians 5:116 Rejoice ever
[1:42:36] more pray without
[1:42:38] ceasing in everything give thanks Amen
[1:42:43] in everything you know that means the
[1:42:44] bad things too or what we consider the
[1:42:46] bad things right you know that also
[1:42:49] means the bad
[1:42:51] kinds amen
[1:42:53] it means like Danny in the situation
[1:42:57] that he just faced when he fell and got
[1:43:00] hurt it was a bad situation but he gave
[1:43:04] thanks to
[1:43:05] God now people of the world probably
[1:43:08] don't understand that right they would
[1:43:11] say why are you giving God thanks for
[1:43:13] falling and hurting
[1:43:16] yourself because like he said it could
[1:43:18] have been so much worse right amen it
[1:43:21] could have been so much worse wor the
[1:43:23] things that could have happened here
[1:43:25] could have put me in the hospital right
[1:43:28] or or in a splint
[1:43:31] or cost more money or busted my face or
[1:43:36] amen it could have been so much worse
[1:43:39] yeah I'm thankful to God people have
[1:43:42] asked me of my wife before why do
[1:43:46] you the Lord took your first son why are
[1:43:49] you thanking God for that because he
[1:43:51] knows better than I do right amen I
[1:43:56] don't understand it may never understand
[1:43:58] it although we've seen some things that
[1:44:01] have come from it as a result of it
[1:44:04] testimonies and such uh because that's
[1:44:07] like Micah has his music sometimes that
[1:44:10] happens to me right I don't know about
[1:44:13] Sonia but I know it happens to me how
[1:44:15] many children you got well that starts a
[1:44:18] conversation of talking about the Lord
[1:44:20] right to me because of that situation
[1:44:24] now normally if Georgie were here uh i'
[1:44:28] just well
[1:44:30] three but since he's gone since he
[1:44:33] passed uh passed on it opens up a door
[1:44:36] for me to be able to witness and talk to
[1:44:38] people about the Lord amen and people
[1:44:41] look say well how can you give God
[1:44:42] thanks for that because he gave him to
[1:44:45] me for a day and a
[1:44:47] half and I know I'll see him on the
[1:44:50] other side right amen he's still my son
[1:44:53] son
[1:44:53] regardless amen he's still Micah and
[1:44:56] Tabitha's brother regardless right he's
[1:44:59] still uh he still Joel Emma and Ruth's
[1:45:02] Uncle
[1:45:04] regardless amen amen praise the Lord
[1:45:07] people look say why you give God glory
[1:45:09] for that the Bible says in everything in
[1:45:12] everything we give thanks praise the
[1:45:15] Lord amen for this is the will of God in
[1:45:20] Christ Jesus concerning you the will of
[1:45:23] God to give him thanks for
[1:45:26] everything
[1:45:27] amen that's the will of God Colossians
[1:45:30] one more I'm going to close here
[1:45:31] Colossians chapter 3:1
[1:45:37] 17 Colossians
[1:45:39] 317 get the picture here now amen that's
[1:45:42] the scriptures in all things in
[1:45:45] everything for every reason for all that
[1:45:47] he does for in every situation we give
[1:45:51] thanks to God Amen amen we give thanks
[1:45:55] we give praise to God Amen our praise is
[1:45:58] our thanks Colossians
[1:46:02] 3:17 and whatsoever ye do in word or
[1:46:06] deed do all in the name of the Lord
[1:46:09] Jesus that includes baptism by the
[1:46:13] way amen those trinitarians or those who
[1:46:16] don't think that we should baptize in
[1:46:18] the name of Jesus Amen do all in the
[1:46:21] name of the Lord Jesus Jesus giving
[1:46:24] thanks to God and the father by him
[1:46:27] giving thanks we do all in his name
[1:46:30] giving thanks yes hopefully that makes a
[1:46:33] little more sense to understand maybe uh
[1:46:37] Joel Emma understand why do we why do we
[1:46:40] pray over our
[1:46:41] food why do we give God thanks for our
[1:46:44] food because we do everything in the
[1:46:46] name of Jesus Christ when we eat we wake
[1:46:50] up we go to work we come to church
[1:46:53] whatever we do we do in the name of the
[1:46:55] Lord Jesus we praise him and give him
[1:46:57] glory yes because it's only his strength
[1:47:00] it's only his ability in us that allows
[1:47:02] us to even wake up or get up amen amen I
