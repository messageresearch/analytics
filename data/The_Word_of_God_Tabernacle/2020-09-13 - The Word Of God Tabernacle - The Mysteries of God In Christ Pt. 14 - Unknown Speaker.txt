bless you today welcome to the house of the lord again reach the name of the lord jesus christ i appreciate you coming and being here amen and thank the lord most of all for providing us this place and uh for each one of you coming and being a participant there and just trust to be a blessing to you today a few things i wanted to mention to you um that i will now and then probably some after the service is over but remember if you need to use the restroom i prefer only going if you really have to but if you really have to through the door and the other door inside there's the restroom also as a reminder and for those who are watching when you come to the assembly here we're welcome to park in front of the church and we're welcome to park on the south side of the church at this school that's for this for sale right here they have a whole big parking lot over here you're welcome to park in the back of the church which we open the gates if you want to go around back there but do not park at the one on the north side the building on the north side that gentleman has requested we not park in his parking spaces even though they're not open on sunday he requests that we not park over there so don't park over there but you're welcome to park in front on the south side or in the back so if you do that if you do and please listen to this very closely and those who may come eventually there's a few that weren't here last week so god bless you appreciate you being here love y'all the the driveway between this church and the school building looks like you can drive through it but don't because between our property and the next property there's a huge dip and if you try to go over that you may rip out the the bottom of your car so don't try to go if you need to go from this parking lot to the one next door or from the one next door to this parking lot don't go through that little area right there go back out on the street if you have to because that if you go dip through there i put a comb right there to try to hope to keep people from going through there so just to let you know and let those hook up know on the streaming if you do come don't try to go from this parking lot to that parking lot without going back on the street because your live will tear your car up so just a word of wisdom to let you know brother roger found that out the hard way his car's okay but he bottomed out pretty heavy when he tried to go from this parking lot to the next one over so just remember that come and there's plenty of parking especially if it's on the south side so there's way more parking than what we actually have seats in here also if you if you feel like you need it and you're on the streaming and you want to come or feel like you need it we have chairs on the side over here we have chairs on the side over here and i got some of my stuff over here and mike has got some of his stuff over there but we can move that stuff if you feel like you want to be a need to be more socially distanced you're welcome to sit over there or over there uh if it's a problem and a concern and you've thought about coming and you haven't come yet we do have chairs over here over here that you can be apart a little bit more so just so that you all know that and if you want to do that feel welcome to um i just left my thing there because nobody was look like everybody's comfortable and said where they're setting so i just left my thing over there but if anybody wants to or if you want to come and feel more comfortable coming you're welcome to do that so appreciate all your goodness the lord and all your blessings to us so there's a few other things i want to mention but i'm going to do that after the service so let's uh let's stand to our feet if we could amen and i have to mention again i really really do appreciate uh daniel making this pulpit for us um sister normal is kind of concerned that we wouldn't like it and it wasn't exactly the picture i sent but i really like it i really do uh like i told you last week brother roger found this observant first of all that the the three steps of grace in the bottom coming into the cross and then i said yeah they come the cross then comes right up to the word so he was inspired when he made this i like the bigness of this and uh it's uh it's a real blessing praise the lord if i want me a shelf sister normally just put one right here maybe eventually we'll see what happens there but that's okay i like i love it i like it the way it is it's really nice i would like to have a place to put more water or something it's it's a real blessing so um and a few of the things about i want to talk to you about but we'll do that afterwards so we'll get to the word now revelation chapter 10 we're going to go back oh there's one other thing i meant to mention um if the lights are too bright for someone just let me know we're eventually supposed to put these five lights here brother roger put these lights in for the streaming because that's what he does so to note cast no shadows to look nicer and for people for it to be more presentable he put these lights here uh so it it is a little bright i like it okay but if it's too bright for you we put two lights on one circuit one light on another circuit and two more lights on them so there's three there's three circuits over there we're gonna put a sound booth back there but there's three back there we can turn one or two of those off if it's too bright we just turn this middle one off or something just let me know so if it's something that uh like last time we were at that church and those lights bothered some people so we just kept them all so if it bothers you let me know we can alter it and we can change it so if it becomes an issue we're going to go back or go back into the mysteries of god in christ we're in part 14 now and uh begin our scripture reading with revelation chapter 10 verse 7 as we have uh for uh every other portion of this uh that we've been doing so revelation 10 7 well let's just bow our heads just talk to the father of the word one more time if we could lord jesus it is wonderful to know lord that at any moment time in life god and we're so thankful in a time like this we can just bow our heads give you honor and glory and praise and talk to you converse with you lord have communion fellowship we thank you god for that opportunity because you're omnipresent you're always here with us and lord we thank you so much for the time that you've given us today father to come here in this place and lord open this precious word god there's many people around the world that don't have the privilege that we have to do what we just did and that is stand in honor of your name to call your name to have this precious holy writ in front of us and to be able to open it and read from it publicly god there's people around the world don't have that privilege it seems simple to us it's probably almost common to us but there's people there's our brothers and sisters around the world that may be challenged to be able to do that and we're so thankful that we live in a place as as bad as it seems to be getting lord we're living in a a place as a country that we can still stand in honor of you we can still open this precious word we can still read from it we can still speak on it we can still worship and praise and honor you father and we thank you for that god and pray that you to help our precious brothers and sisters who may not have quite the privilege that we have lord and be with them and help them in every way to overcome all the adversity that they are persecuted by and living through the lord i pray god now in our assembly here that you would take these words that we read and lord break it forth to us fresh once again lord just try to do according to the revelation that you give me and the purpose of your word and pray god that it be a blessing to each one of us here today i am insufficient to this task i cannot do it without you none of us can the lord was you would come that you anoint the speaker and hear a like that whatever your purpose that you have to be accomplished by us meeting here today that it would be accomplished we surrender ourselves to you in complete unity and in complete surrender father god let it be according to your perfect will in our lives we committed to you this service and all that is said and done for the remaining part of this in the precious name of the lord jesus christ and for your glory and honor we pray amen amen revelation 10 7 let's read this again before you see it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets you can be seated if you'd like as i said we're on part 14 of the mysteries of god in christ and last week we finished up uh i don't think you could ever finish up but i feel like we came to a completion of what the lord had given me on god having the preeminence in his people so this would be the restoration of his kingdom part one so we're on the mysteries of god in christ the restoration of his kingdom now that's not exactly the way brother branham put it as i'll read that quote in just a minute but that's the way i wanted to put it for my titling of this subtitle i wanted to put it's the restoration of his kingdom amen we are subject of his kingdom we are here because this is his kingdom his kingdom is in us praise the lord so that restoration of his kingdom part one amen that's where we're at today so i want to go over to saint matthew now chapter six to help the lord we'll just try to lay a little bit of a foundation here um maybe not be quite as long as we were last week i don't think we were too long last week but i wanted to try to finish up what we had there to be done i didn't want to leave anything over in today but i will hit some highlights from last week maybe the last couple services or so as we transition into this restoration of his kingdom because remember this mysteries of god in christ or christ christ the mystery of god revealed brother branham brought brought out or broke down into a three-part process of god revealing himself to his people god having the preeminence in his people and god restoring his kingdom so those three parts we're on back actually the third part of that now and trying to finish this up the lord give us help today matthew chapter 6 we're going to read and remember this is the restoration of his kingdom as we begin to read here matthew 6 chapter 8 but not be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him but yet he still asks us to ask amen right he asks us to ask even though he knows what we need we still he asked us to ask because what we do is when we ask we ask in faith and that's the thing that god gets us to the place of understanding is that we have the faith that we need to have because this whole life and this whole existence is by faith uh what we do how we believe how we live where we're going a rapture right it's gotta be by by faith it's gotta be rapturing faith and faith comes by hearing the word so uh if that word is spoken by any human lips when it is heard it brings faith so he knows all things but yet he asks us to ask so he has uh he he knows what things we need before we ask him after this manner now the lord's prayer after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive not our debts as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses now let's drop down one more scripture thirty-third verse same chapter 33rd verse but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you amen now um we're gonna come back to that so we just came through um the second part of christ from history god revealed god having the preeminence in his people there's a reason that god wanted to first reveal himself or make himself known to his people and that's was so that he could have the preeminence in his people and god having the preeminence in his people he wanted to have preeminence in his people so he could express himself through her jesus wanting to be the bride being the full expression as we've said several times in this the full expression of jesus christ on the earth today right now we know that is to bring about the purpose that god has and the reason that god is doing what he's doing to finish this all up amen god started it it's his work so he has to finish it you know that's that's the bible said if god started to work then it's up to him to keep it and if he keeps it it's up to him to finish it so this is his work but we're his subjects here to help get this completed to become the full expression of jesus christ so that we can finish that that god has that he wants to do there's things that we know that's still in the scripture there's things that we know maybe in our lives or others lives that maybe yet still need to be finished expressed well we're here for that purpose god help and use me for whatever that purpose is god helping you is you for whatever that purpose god helping use your watching today god help us all to be able to fulfill that purpose whatever it is but then when god fulfills that once god has that second eve restored this bride restored back once she's been come to that full expression then god can have or begin bring back to the full restoration of his kingdom again see it could not have been the full restoration of that kingdom until god brought the full restoration of his bride back to where it's supposed to be so in the second eve his bride today this gentile bride is restored to that place of the full expression then god could begin to as she already began but bring about the restoration of his kingdom back into his proper position again now you notice that uh that that he began and we're going to go into genesis and read there for a minute but you know what when when god began this he he he started this uh in motion back right after the fall so as it began in motion there it came through and of course we had uh the restoration of that that male subject adam uh jesus christ being that second adam then god had to bring about that uh that restoration of that woman eve that his bride to bring her back to that restoration and now that's come to the place of fruition that's come to the place of actuality jesus has come and that full restoration of that has taken place he has come back in us to bring the full restoration expression of himself through a bride today that has happened so what has come so after that has happened what's this next part to happen we are not in the kingdom of god as far as a physical kingdom is concerned but we are still in satan's eden so what is the restoration that is to take place now after he's done the first two parts is to restore back that kingdom to the place that it was back in the garden of eden people fuss and yelling i've heard people argue about uh we're not going back to pentecost yet we're going back to pentecost friend i'm going back to the beginning i'm going back where all of this started where god is restoring the bride back to the proper position that she was supposed to be when god created the whole thing in the beginning that's where this restoration is taking us with this last part and we read last week romans 8 23 i believe it was that that full redemption is by the red this full completion restoration is by the redemption of our bodies amen and then god of course we know what happens after that and armageddon sets in although you can look in california you think carmen armageddon's already set in but just uh states and places under judgment but anyway uh armageddon sets in and then millennium and the gog and magog and the white throne judgment and new city the new jerusalem and that completion of that full restoration of that physical place that god has for us amen because remember the millennium is a place that god makes all things that were wrong here he makes right it's that one 000 year that that crushes finally the curse of the original sin in the garden of eden no man has lived one full day a thousand years since that original sin curse in the beginning and it's to bring back the place of peace and love and unity on this on this earth uh that that's been missing ever since the fall took place the way things are going today uh me and brother roger was talking the other day and and and you know we were lamenting about a lot of stuff that's going on and and the way people were acting and and i looked at him and i said but you know i can't i can't fault a person for wanting a utopia uh and that's what a lot that's what these people that's what a lot of them are striving for they're striving for utopia they just don't know you're not going to get it here right and they go about achieving it the wrong way but i don't blame a person for wanting to reach that place of of utopia because that's in every soul every soul every person as a soul we're 10 million worlds that soul has a desire because it came from somewhere and it has a desire to get back there just if they're not predestined they don't know and they can't get back to that place they do everything else to try to substitute for it so i don't blame somebody for wanting to have a place of utopia it's just not going to be here well it'll be here but it won't be in its current condition it won't be in satan's eaton it'll be in a restored kingdom right in god's kingdom praise the lord it won't be the way it is today amen but notice that god had to bring back to reach back into that expression of the bride god had to bring that bride up to that place of full expression and hopefully we understood that hopefully you can place yourself in that position of that expression because we got to understand what part we play in this we gotta this bride has got to come to play she knows who she is that's exactly what she is she's him and fletch she is him in flesh manifested is pressed in flesh today that's what you are and that's the job that we have to do that's god's choice to bring about and express a restoration of that kingdom now let me read this amen because we are headed for that utopia amen but that perfect city is not the millennium amen that perfect place is not the millennium that's the place that god brings back and and that place that god makes that all the wrongs and brother brown said all the wrongs are made right and that place of a thousand years of killing the first curse because remember the millennium is still a period of time the millennium is a thousand years it is a time element but when that new city the full restoration that kingdom sets in it's eternity there is no time element to that amen amen now uh in the mysteries of uh of christ the mystery of god revealed i want to just read this to you as we enter into this third part now secondly he said as we just came through to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in his people how many can attest to that god living in his people now he could do that uh he uh now he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated them and now he had to come some other way to get back again he said oh this is so rich to me i just even think of it see what god's purpose was now that's when he could express the preeminence you see he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but christ that's the full preeminence to know nothing but christ what did paul say i don't know nothing among you save christ and him crucified that's that place in full control in god's full control you get what i mean all right that's secondly first express himself completely god in christ second to have the preeminence in uh by this in his church which is his body the bride he could have the preeminence to express himself through he says them i say us us as a body of believers internationally we in this church are a part of that all right and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people praise the lord amen amen that's the restoration i want to go to that's the restoration that's the utopia that my soul's striving for amen praise god talk with them fellowship with them and now sin and death separated them from his presence and his entire expression do you read it before the foundational world to express all of his attributes therefore oh my listen now if any trinitarian here now there's none here but if any trinitarian hearer there i say watch on streaming or archiving this video you're a trinitarian here if you just let yourself loose just a minute you can see that father son the holy ghost is not three gods is three attributes of the same god his expression father he wanted to be a father he was a father he was a son he is the holy ghost and the father and the holy ghost is the same spirit don't you see get it not three gods devils taught you them things to make an idolater out of you see it's one god expressing three attributes to uh to be father to be savior to be son to be healer is his expression some more in there i'll just leave that and see if the lord will bring that up later but to lead that to bring that expression see and we went through that of course we talked about the foundation that this body bride is to be built upon that foundation that was laid there jesus said upon that foundation i'll build my church i will build my bride you my friends this bride today built on that foundation of who jesus christ is the full revelation of jesus christ and manifestation not as the second person in the trinity but god almighty fully expressed in jesus christ in flesh form that's who he was that's who he is he's still not he's still the same today as he has always been now let's look what a kingdom is for a moment a kingdom is basically a kingship it's a place or a domain or a dominion or someone has royal power or location a royal power this kingdom it's a it's a as we know i probably don't need to go in it deeply but it is is again a place of dominion uh usually there's borders and there's uh lines that is a person or a physical human earthly king's domain that's what he controls let's just say he controls this property then the king of this property controls everything from this fence over here to that fence back there to this fence over here to the road right there that's the dominion now if a person's in the road he doesn't have dominion over that you understand what i'm saying if he goes beyond that wall that king has no dominion over that amen you know brother graham says you can get out from under the blood of jesus christ and god is not responsible for you if you get out from under or outside of the domain of the kingdom of god then where are you at you're in the kingdom of satan obviously but that domain or that dominion is god's place it's his royal power and property that god has amen now that's a physical kingdom and to restore that kingdom as we know is to bring back to its rightful position that's all we know what restoration is to bring back to its rightful position so to re to restore this kingdom means that there was a time there was a place where there was a a kingdom a dominion that god had complete control and full dominion over now remember brother branham said that adam was an amateur god that he was the god of the earth god's the god of the universe everywhere he was the god of adam amen god almighty he's the god of adam adam was the god over the earth if you speak namesake do whatever you wanted see so that was his dominion well everything around was god's dominion but when adam lost uh his right to life he lost his right to the book of life he lost his right to life itself thus man began to die after that they weren't intended to die man had eternal life but they lost their right to life and inheritance in life so all of that entered into and of course the dominion that adam had dominion over which was this earth adam had dominion over the earth he lost it to satan so it became satan's domain so it as his earth became satan's domain and he is still today satan's domain even though christ has bought it back with his own blood this domain still is satan's eden but yet if it rightly rightfully law rightfully belongs to god satan now is simply a squatter and god's allowed him to do that god's allowed it to be satan's eden because in god's way and in god's time god's gonna take it back right amen amen and when he does that then all then all this all this will be done uh it's it struck me the other day when uh and brother greene's voice rang in my head border to border coast to coast i think of all that going to crazy over the and understandably the fires are just devastating california oregon washington is just it's just a horrible thing to look at and watch i mean the smoke coming over this city for three or four days to block the sun it's so thick over there in northern california and oregon that's how bad it is but i think they think that's bad wait till this country is burned border to border and coast to coast forget one little area of the country we're talking about all the entire united states from atlantic to pacific from canada mexico burned over judgment it's in a place of judgment right now but why is it it's to bring back and restore the kingdom so when adam lost his inheritance he lost his inheritance in life he lost the earth that he had control over because remember he was the god of the earth the amateur god under god almighty of this earth he lost that into the hands of the one he lost it to so god has come and bring back to restore that kingdom back to its rightful position all this is god's motion god's position to bring it back to restore where it was in god's mind perfectly to restore that kingdom taking it away from satan well he's already done that remember when jesus died at calvary the chemistry of the blood fell on the earth that redeemed this earth back the power of the blood of god not the blood of a buller go to a jew or gentile but the blood of almighty god purchased this earth back into his possession again right now all that adam lost now you want to talk about a full restoration you want to talk about a full expression of a bride to this day think about all that brother adam said in the breach all that adam lost has now been given back into the hands of the bride it's her possession amen it's satan's eating friend but you still now again have the ability to speak to name to say to do what you want if you can have faith and speak to this mountain to be moved into it amen that's the scripture friend we're not outside the bible that's the bible we just got to understand and learn to take our position in what god has given to us this belongs to us it doesn't belong to savior satan wants to make you think it's still his but it's not it belongs to us yeah we're here in the middle of satan's eden but god has given us full authority the full authority as adam would have in the garden of eden god has given before the fall god has given that back to the bride today that's what you call a restoration to restore this kingdom back to its right position now we're going to talk about and go back from this restoration back and forth of this kingdom because there's an understanding we have to get to the place to realize that this was a spiritual kingdom before it ever became a physical kingdom understand this was a spiritual kingdom before it ever became a physical kingdom because in god in elohim in the self-existing one in his mind in his thoughts attributes before god ever spoke to create the world's galaxies whatever is out there before he ever spoke it was already in him it was his spiritual kingdom brother aaron said he had attributes his attributes we just read a little bit of to be a father to be a son to be a healer to be a savior to all these attributes that god is today those are a lot of the ones we most commonly refer to all those attributes god was wasn't desired to express he could not do in that place when he was just the self-existing by himself he could not do it he couldn't express himself as a father till he had someone to be a father to he couldn't express himself his son he couldn't express himself as healer until someone was sick god could never be a healer amen until someone was lost god could never be a savior right so all this was in god all this kingdom of god was spiritual before it became physical and we're talking about the restoration of that physical kingdom we've got to understand the restoration of that spiritual kingdom or the bringing into that spiritual kingdom is first and foremost before the physical can come about the spiritual has to be in line first before the physical can come about that's why jesus had to come shed his blood that's why there was a gentile bride to come up to restore her the second eve back to her position so when she's back in her position now that earth can come see the spiritual had to be done first in you in me it was spiritual it wasn't physical right now it becomes physical when we make it physical because we allow god to we read the bible we allow god to shape us and mold us and we don't do the things we used to do we don't wear the same clothes we don't used to do we don't go same place as we used to because we're different so it morphs itself into a physical manifestation of god in our lives but it's a spiritual restoration the physical restoration doesn't take place until the body change then the physical restoration takes place and of course when this body's changed and the world can't hold us anymore the the thai melon of this world cannot hold a timeless body that's why when god come to abraham he had he had to create a body out of the dust he created brother and said created one for himself stepped into it created one for michael created one for gabriel just as examples and said michael step into this body gabriel step into this body and the three of them went down and met abraham i remember amen but they kept doing it in the way that they were existing at the time there had to be something to allow them to exist in that time element well friends when this time body is taken off we're not we can't stay here anymore right when this body's changed into a a incorruptible timeless eternal body then we're out of here that's the full physical restoration of our bodies hallelujah of the physical amen and then the and then the continuation of course we know that we go the marriage suffer the land the tribulation sets in and all that continues to unfold and brings this place to where it's going to be a place that's going to be fit for christ and his bride to come and live rule and reign he'll be the light of the city right amen no need of the son because he'll be the light of that city that's going to be that that will be that restoration well when did god start now we know the creation we read the first two chapters of genesis and we read the creation we know it was god's creation it was god's kingdom it was god's mind that he brought forth and god created it we we can read that we know that and that creation came and adam came and animals body life animal life and and and then he created eve and from adam came woman helped me eve uh so that place was god's kingdom uh it was so much god's kingdom that god came down in the cool of the evening every evening to speak to his creation that was so it was so much his he personally came every day and spoke to adam lift the ear amen amen that's the restoration i'm talking hallelujah that's the restoration i'm looking for so much his but then when adam lost it that was done god no longer come and fellowship with them they couldn't even stand in god's presence then only only the lambs the the bloody lambs that god slew allowed them to even come into his presence momentarily but a great but a great a chasm was thrown between god and man see and then and now all of a sudden this dominion that was god's this kingdom that was god's was was lost into the hands of another and adam was still here but he didn't get his daily visit from god anymore because of that great chasm that great gulf you stand on one end of the ocean and another on the other end of the ocean you say well how am i going to get to that person or you can stand on the south front of the grand canyon and a friend stand on the north end of the grand canyon how about i get to get to them uh people can hike it go down and back and forth or take a boat across the colorado or whatever however they do it but there's that great gulf how do i get there well jesus christ had to come and bridge that gap by his own blood bridge that gap now that we can come back to fellowship with god now as god came in his physical kingdom to have fellowship lift to ear with his creation with his son with adam the first created son of god only created son of god when he had that now it's a spiritual communion it's a spiritual fellowship now we can have fellowship with god every day it's not that he comes in a in a corporal body and we sit down and talk or have a meal together but every day we have the opportunity to speak to him i was going to say bow our heads but you don't even have to do that a lot of times i do because the bowing of the head shows reverence but it also shows it also shuts out the world right when you talk to god you bow your head or close your eyes you're shutting out the world and you put earplugs in you want but usually we don't but you bow your head that's reverence and you're shutting out the world amen you're not seeing everything else going on so it's a it's a way that we talk to the lord but you can talk to him any way you want you can stand and look up you can you can just talk to him right have fellowship with him it's not the same lift to ear but it's life to life spirit to spirit right yeah we have fellowship and communion with the lord that's that's our ability that that restoration has taken place that spiritual kingdom restoration has taken place but as god created this place we read it first and we could read it first two chapters of genesis and god created and god created and god created him made it exactly the way he wanted to be he created his man he created the man to help me and then the fall took place but i want to go over to genesis and read here in in genesis 3. we've hit this uh what time or two during this series already uh it was it was during the the time where we were talking about god manifesting himself or revealing himself to his people making himself known to his people remember the first part of this series we did we did god revealing himself for manifesting himself to his people making himself real to his people that was the first part of this that we did before having the preeminence well this here was a part of that but it also as i was studying about it yesterday and seeing where the lord wanted me to go with this that this is the part that we come back to you've got the kingdom being made and in the beginning of the third verse or the third chapter you have the kingdom falling and the kingdom falling into the hands of another which we've already talked about that kingdom fell into and it's still in the hands the grubby nasty filthy hands of the devil and it's still in his hands doesn't belong to him anymore but again it's still in his hands still satan's even so the beginning of the third chapter is the fall of that kingdom it is a follow that kingdom into sin and the kingdom going into the hands of another but i want you to notice something just after that fall as you can read the first few verses we'll begin our reading in the 11th verse and he said who told god said to adam who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree where i commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat now remember that command and that bringing back from god to adam was only to adam he never said this to eve he never says this to the serpent he only said this to adam because adam was the god of the earth not the serpent not eve the woman she wasn't even she wasn't adam was god put adam in charge god put adam in control and adam failed so god comes to him and says have you done what i told you not to do i didn't tell her i didn't tell him i told you don't do this and you did it now of course is is a customary among human beings especially it seems like americans we begin to pass the book and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to me to be with me she gave of the tree and i did eat oh does that make it her fault do your actions now become her responsibility not with god they're not there might be in this world in this warped way of thinking that people think today oh it's their fault because i did something no no no no no you did it it's your fault you said it it's your fault you're responsible for your own actions i don't care what happened over here i don't care who may have influenced you or whatever that you are responsible for your own actions but of course you know as it is today it's always everybody else's fault it's always somebody else's fault that's true so he says the woman thou gave me and the lord said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent begot me and i did eat is the serpent responsible for her actions nope she is and god holds them responsible another thing that just doesn't seem to be going over very good today holding people responsible for their own actions where did that ever go to yeah when i was young i was very responsible for my actions and all the things i saw and noticed around the world mostly at least around the country people were responsible for their own actions where is that gone i'm not really sure but again the woman the the serpent is not responsible for her actions she did what she did is her action but she's going to blame somebody else don't blame anybody else friend if you made a mistake you want them to make a mistake if you've done something or said something wrong on up to your mistake repent for it make it right right people will have more respect for you if you do that god will certainly handle respect for you if you do that and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt be thy uh shalt thou eat all the days of thy life now notice god didn't give the serpent a space here he gave the woman he gave the man a space to explain to to give their side of the story he didn't give that to the serpent because remember the serpent doesn't have a soul because the serpent was an animal the serpent wasn't a human being animal doesn't have a soul so if he doesn't have a soul and you say well the actions he performed are just the actions he performed whether it's the under the influence of somebody else or not the responsibility that falls into a human by their soul which is their free will didn't exist with the serpent it only existed with the man and the woman because they had the soul they had free will they had choice and and which is determined in your soul see so cursed he said and of course he cursed thee uh cursed him on his belly and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now how many verses is that and you could have broke it up into one verse or you could have made it kept it one verse you could have broke it up to two verses three verses but according to my bible and probably most bibles i guess how many verses is this after the fall uh it began in the sixth verse the woman saw that the tree was good for food so the fall began the sixth verse the sixth first to the fifteenth verse that's nine verses i want you to grasp this nine verses in in the infancy of god god the almighty omnipotent eternal god nine verses how they broke it up after the fall god has already spoken in this ink in this world the rest the beginning of that restoration you see it god is already nine verses after the fall beginning the restoration of that kingdom how is he doing it he says because i will put enmity between your seed and the woman's seed remember friend in our teaching earlier the woman does not have a seed she has a an egg a field is the male with the hemoglobin that has the seed that has the life the woman doesn't have a seed so how did god reference to to to the serpent that that that the enmity the division the hatred would be between the serpent seed and the woman see when the woman has no seed the serpent had a seat people want to deny serpenty but it's right here in the bible right the serpent had a seed but the woman did not have seed so what's the seed that god's referencing here that's going to be the great hatred and enmity between the serpent seed and her seed she didn't have a seed but god appointed the woman a seed when god placed in the womb of mary the very germ life of almighty god and she received seed of almighty god to produce jesus christ god already speaking about jesus god already talking about the restoring back of that kingdom it only felt 10 minutes ago 20 minutes ago the kingdom just fell the physical part of god's spoken word kingdom had just fallen and god is already speaking the restoration of that kingdom hallelujah by talking about the seed of the woman which is jesus christ amen amen it already began began 20 minutes after it failed god's already starting it back praise the lord don't see god's people say well things have happened haphazardly or that was a coincidence or that was luck friend there is no such thing not in the world of a christian there is no such thing as luck there is no such thing as coincidence amen god has everything controlled god is orchestrating this whole thing and everything that god does is for reason and purpose yes we may not understand it but everything is according to god's purpose reason and he knows what he's doing better than we do right i mean i can't stand up here friend and tell you but you know i love you but i couldn't stand up here and tell you that that that i've never said or questioned god's wisdom uh god why would you do this i can't say i've never done that right i've probably done it way more than i should have questioned god's providence question god's uh uh will and and perfect uh design that he had god why did you do this or even think in my mind that i had a better way of doing it oh now i know you have enough no you haven't thought oh god i had a better way of doing that you might not have verbalized it but you probably thought if i was going to do it this way god i'd have done this right yeah god said if god could open up the eternity so he just said yeah this is where you'd ended up too yeah this whole god thank you thank you for the little thank you for the little prick in my flesh over here so i didn't lose my soul over here amen praise the lord but notice god began right there that was the beginning of god's kingdom right there god had already started it god had already began by speaking jesus christ now we know that woman seed of course through the message of the hour and through the the revelation of the word that woman see became jesus christ god appointed a seed the germ of almighty god coming into the womb of a woman hey man how wonderful friend god's speaking that bringing jesus and the course that be in enmity and we've talked about thou shalt bruise his head now he shall bruise thy heal as we've talked about those things but let's move on as we see 20 minutes after the fall nine verses after the fall now we know there's a few things that happened in that time whatever time period it was nine verses after the fault god's already speaking restoration praise the lord amen unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow thou shalt bring four children thy desire uh shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now of course we know that curse is the original sin what the original sin was well the original sin became the curse to the woman but in that curse come to one of the greatest blessings in my opinion that a woman can have to be entrusted by god as the instrument by which he will bring forth additional life right amen i've often told you and i've been challenged by this by certain other people i i won't say but that just didn't believe this and and pardon me but i've never found the quote where brother branham said it exactly like this but as i found it or saw it as god as brother branham preached it brother branham said that adam had the book of life well if adam had the book of life what was in that book life right all the life that was to come forth out of the mind of god written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world we went over that before the foundation of the world that book was in adam's hand well that those names were on that book which would have been my name your name those that were gods from the beginning of time till today were to come forth how were they to come forth would god have broken his uh his way of doing things when he began further creation outside of adam and eve what he had said oh i did adam this way but you know i think it i think it'd be better if i did it this way now that's not god so if god did it one way one time we know what he's going to do it the same way every other time right that's the perfection of god there's no improvement upon that right so when god when there is life that was to come forth that was to issue forth in his in his time decreed season when that was to come forth how was it to come forth adam had the book of life brother brown tells us plainly had the book of life and uh the earth and all the inheritance of life that was his see so if he had it and god was going to create a different way at a different time god's not going to do that so how's god going to create the next person that comes along by the same way he created adam in the beginning right by speaking the word well if god entrusted adam enough to have the book don't you think he would have entrusted adam enough to read that name or to call that name or to bring that that name out of the dust of the earth right now again i i've been challenged on that and i can't produce you in the exact quote that brother brown said that but with everything i read and see it just it just makes perfect sense to me god used the voice of adam to speak those things to come forth i believe that's how life was to to be issued before the fall was to be spoken word because that's what he did the first time if he did it that way the first time he's going to do it that way every other time it was going to be spoken so that entrustment now of adam of god to adam of the bringing or issuing forth of life notice something even though god says i will greatly multiply that i saw my conception she's now conceiving before the fall she wasn't conceiving this is only after the fault this is god's permission conception is god's permissive will not his perfect will but god took from adam because he lost the book now he didn't lose the book to say he lost the book of life into the hands of the original honor god god had the book of life then not satan brother graham said god's filthy satan's filthy hands couldn't take that that went back to the hands of god so god had it but god transferred now from the spoken word perfect will to the issuing of conception permissive will god transferred that from adam in my opinion speaking that name from the book of life to bring it forth from the dust of the earth to the woman now the woman's entrusted with bringing forth life into the world now to me that is a tremendous trust that god has entrusted to the woman and it i i i see it as a blessing although a lot of people today who tote their dogs and cats around would probably disagree with me uh but i i disagree with them i mean crying out loud folks you hear you hear more about adopting a dog today than you do adopting a human yeah i'm sorry soapboxagon but that just just a sign of the times to me i mean where they seem more concerned with adopting an animal than they are adopting a human they'd rather just kill the human and be dumb and just you know be done with that so my how everything slips but notice here that i i brought this out just i mean uh to me i i brought it out once before i think in the justification series but this uh this is just uh to me uh there's been there's been a lot over the years of the in my opinion of the beating down of women and that's a horrible thing you precious sisters are absolute jewels in the crown of a man or in god's mind jewels that's right so much so god entrusted you your body to him to issue forth life that's just wonderful but let's move move on sorry thou shall break for that children thy desire to be thy husband and thou and he shall rule over him over thee but remember again no mention of anything that god said i told you not to do this there's not a mention of that god did not say that he didn't say it to the serpent he didn't say it to the woman he didn't say did you do what i told you not to do he didn't tell that to the woman amen he told it to the man where does responsibility fall today or did it fall then or does it fall today amen so many times this message wants to beat down women friend i'm sorry but the man is the one responsible before god all right absolutely it was here and it is now and unto adam he said because thou has hearkened to the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it again he didn't say that the woman curses the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till all till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust thou art until dust thou shall return because i told you that the day you eat is the day you're gonna die amen so now you came from the dust where i took you from that's where you're going back to your body is anyway adam called his wife's name even we've talked about that you know he's just now calling her eve didn't call her eve until now why because she's pregnant pregnant with twins one from the serpent one from adam calls his wife's name eve because she's the mother of all living 21st verse i want to get to this unto adam also into his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them now the second now you got you got the fall you've got the curses and in there you have god mentioning jesus christ not by name but by the woman see mentioning jesus the beginning of that restoration of the kingdom then you have more curses coming along to to adam and the ground well adam wasn't cursed but the earth was cursed for his sake um thanks adam it's pretty hard out there huh hot to it bro john anyway uh but now the 21st verse we have the second in my opinion the second reference that god makes when god takes two lambs and kills them and throws the the coats of skin out to adam and eve to wear that was the second reference that that god is going to and is restoring back what had just fallen well i had just fallen into the hands of satan i'm already making plans i'm already putting in motion what it's going to take to restore this back to its rightful position he talked about the woman's seat and now he's talking about the blood he talked about jesus christ with the curse of the woman seed and now he's talking about the blood that was to be shed by the lamb the lamb's blood that was going to be a an atonement so that humanity could come back in fellowship with god again amen that allowed adam and eve it wasn't the perfect lamb but it was a lamb enough that they were able to come out of the bushes from uh well hiding not hiding but separating themselves they could they could it was adam had created a buffer by the bush god created a buffer by the blood it wasn't body like they created that was a sufficient buffer it's a it's uh the animal it's the bloodline that that's sufficient to buffer that's where adam that's where cain and abel uh uh cain abel had a greater revelation than cain kane thought that botany life buffer was going to be enough to please god and it wasn't it had to take a blood buffer to please god adam first put on fig leaves thought that was a buffer didn't buffer enough hid behind bushes so he put body life on him he hid behind botany life but that none of that was good enough it had to take the blood so god is the one that had to make the sacrifice he took the two innocent lambs and gave them so the blood could be the buffer so you see the the reference that god is already making adam losing everything bringing it back restoring it back god's already taught jesus christ and the blood just in the third verse alone just nine verses after the fall and then however many down to the 21st verse god has already made two references of the restoration a restoring back of this kingdom praise the lord amen now bringing that back to where it's supposed to be let's go back to matthew again for just a moment and i'm going to read this over my time's gotten away from me but i want to read this over again so lord willing maybe we can pick this up next week where we left off matthew chapter 6 again where we were earlier with the lord's prayer and we want to i'm going to finish this here but i'm going to preface my reading again now before i read this with the understanding that we need to remember this kingdom is not just physical it's also spiritual and it was spiritual before it became physical this kingdom the kingdom of god was spiritual before it became physical the process of this began in the garden of eden winding up with this bride of the last day which we believe we are a part of anyway the bride of the last days brought in by this the cross by the cross it was the cross that was referenced with uh uh with jacob um with israel when he crossed his hands and gave the the greater blessing to the lesser child the greater blessing that's left from the jews the the the tame olive tree over to the gentile the wild olive tree it came through the cross this cross it began there and that is the junction point that that brings us to this restoration and in that junction point of this cross jesus christ the blood being here he gives us this prayer in this prayer it says after this man i pray ye our father which and i'm not going to go through all the lord's prayer we've done this before and broke it down but i want to get to a specific after this manner therefore pray ye our father which are in heaven holy is your name thy kingdom come amen there we go thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven well that's speaking of two separate if we if you will domains it's speaking of the kingdom we could say the kingdom of god and it's speaking of heaven actually speaking of three because it's talking about the earth too but i'm i'm focusing on the kingdom of god the kingdom of god in reference is there's those three domains he talks about thy kingdom come well where was it or was it that it had to come and where is it coming too it's not coming upon this earth as being transformed from satan's eden to god's domain at least not yet so where is he talking about is that thy kingdom come where is that kingdom coming to and where was it amen where was it well if this kingdom kingdom of god was spiritual then where does that kingdom come to it comes to thy will be done in earth in earth aren't you a part of the earth we're all from the dust of the earth right right we're all elements of the earth so if we came from the earth we are the earth that the kingdom has come to then who are we today or the restoration the expression of jesus christ because the kingdom has come unto you amen amen the kingdom is now in you the kingdom come now what's now now what happens now after the kingdom has come if the kingdom has come unto you because jesus told them said if you believe who i am then the kingdom has come unto you right because the kingdom was standing right there they rubbed elbows with him they ate with him they talked with him and prayed with him and uh gave him a hug around the neck washed his feet whatever they spent time they they had the kingdom in present corporal body form but in that form he could only be with one or two at a time half a dozen twenty whatever it might be but when he went away then that kingdom had to come back had to come because see jesus said thy kingdom come so where was the kingdom well the kingdom was standing right there but this model prayer is what well the kingdom's here why do we need it to come because he had to go away jesus was going away so that he could come back not just with a half a dozen with him 10 or 12 but that he can in the initial one 120 of them in one room and he split himself up like tongues of fire on each one of them and that kingdom lit upon each one of them and went into each one of them for the purpose of what so that thy will god your will would be done in me as you have already seen it foreign on it predestined in your mind before the foundation of the world let that will be done in me your kingdom has come now let that will yours whatever it is god i die to myself remember we go back to this god having full preeminence now i am dead and hid in christ i am bought with a price i'm no longer my own you get those scriptures that full preeminence that full expression thy kingdom come your will be done in earth in me as you've already saw it as you've already predestined in your mind in you in heaven let it be done in me because the kingdom has come could be done before that see that spiritual kingdom it couldn't have been done before that but that spiritual kingdom had to bring back the restoration first through jesus christ male the bride second the second adam the bride the second e female to bring back the restoration of the kingdom now we're going to that completely restored evil one day that completely restored eden but in us that spiritual kingdom god has restored to us thy kingdom come now that kingdom lives in us now god's will can be done in us as it's already done in him to bring that full expression to bring that full restoration so in us in you let this be personal in you in me that full expression today of god in you working his will wherever you go whatever you do in all of your life because that kingdom has come god's will be done in my life in your life amen let it be so whatever god's desire is not my desire his desire because our desires become his desires amen our wants become his wants or his wants become ours his desires become ours amen we're led of his spirit praise the lord amen god bless you today amen we can stand if you'd like amen it's just finished it's really to me tremendous to think about what god has done to bring this to the place it's at for god to restore this back to the place spiritually in us through us now all of us i trust all of us are us to see our loved ones those if you've had any that's gone on before to see our loved ones come before us again my brother here brother green a minimum 30 days brother venom told him minimum 30 days the dead on christ will rise before us and be with us minimum of 30 days those are his words praise the lord amen 30 40 days and then we go home to be with the lord but to realize what god has already done and brought it through and brought us to offering if that just you want to feel special people today want to feel special they want to feel wanted they want to feel loved oh if they could just know the lord i know amen amen they could just give their lives to the lord i know praise the lord jesus amen i'm so thankful praise the lord blessing this um this little course all the blood of jesus amen it's 409 in the psalm book if you want to look it up or need to look it up all the precious blood of jesus amen thank you jesus 409 let's sing it to him with all our hearts now oh the blood of

to give until there's just no more to live i'm going to love [Music] oh i could never [Music] ever [Music] hallelujah i believe that's all of our desires today amen live the way he wants us to live to do what he wants us to do be led of his spirit amen this is our responsibility friends this is our place the restoration of this kingdom to bring forth the purpose of god in this last day amen god help us realize who we are today praise god and bring bring forth that true manifestation praise the lord jesus god bless you help us all lord to realize who we are draw closer to him in every way amen praise the lord amen god so good isn't he amen i appreciate you coming today being in the house of the lord i pray something was said to bless you in some way today amen i failed to mention most

here i think so happy grandparent day though and if you're watching streaming happy grandparent day to you streaming and uh god richard bless you uh as you've noticed we've got a few things that we still want to do here um we just i it wasn't verbally spoken but um we we kind of almost brother angel's done a lot of work past couple weeks uh on painting and the carpet the floor and different things but and me and brother roger did with putting and wiring up the lights all the lights and the wiring you see me and him did all that and the switches and the receptacles and we haven't got it all done yet but um most of it is to this point so but we just kind of you didn't any of us say anything about it but i think it just kind of became a week off last week where we just didn't do anything uh as far as the church concerned we still worked very hard a lot uh this week but we still have molding to put down around the bottoms um we still have the ceiling tiles we still have to put the i guess is everybody comfortable were you comfortable yes wasn't too hot or okay because we still there's air coming out of this vent there's air coming out of a vent over there so we need to run those get those hooked up and run those across and drop down a couple of places in here and put the tiles in and put the ceiling tiles in and we're going to do something with that door and uh build a sound booth back there and brother rogers gonna get a couple of uh streaming cameras to hang on to mount to the walls back there uh for streaming in a sound booth and uh brother zach has donated and i'm donating a uh a monitor a tv that we're gonna mount uh probably gonna mount one about um just right about three foot on the other side of my right there we'll probably mount one up there and we'll probably mount one over here probably about right here uh so to broadcast the words on or pictures or whatever we want to uh so we won't need songbooks anymore now we just got to find somebody can run the sound booth i know mike can do it but he can't do everything so maybe he can teach somebody i don't know but so there's going to be a little sound booth back in the corner we kind of have a little bit of limited space but there's a little bit a little bit more room for chairs and stuff if we need to but we're going to put i think you're going to put curtains like this over the door and leave that door there but put a film on it where you can see in but you can't see into the back room so if anybody's in there wants to you know hold their child or something and still watch and participate a little bit you can still see in here but we won't be able to see back into there and all that's going to be cleaned out still yet but brother nat sister teresa anybody know you know nathaniel and teresa garcia you'd know him if you saw him i'm sure because they went to tabernacle years sister sister teresa was really good friends with the miles so you'd know him to see him i'm sure but anyway they're the ones that on the actually lucy behar owns the building and when brother mike died this was his uh insurance office years ago where he had his farmer's insurance out of it and those of you came in before almost everybody in here said maybe sheila and lydia there was an offensive uh wall that went over here and down to there and it was there was one you see these right here there was a wall that went out there and then down to that wall and it was office here office there throw everything out tore the ceiling out um basically done everything all over again so it's become what it is and it's very nice i like it a little tight especially for a pastor who is expecting this congregation to continue to grow it's kind of tight right now but with the kobe thing going on and some folks still staying at home just streaming it's we have a it provides a little more room so anyway so michael all this stuff will be moved back there eventually mike had donated his piano to the church so i appreciate that too but uh we still have a little bit more work to do but appreciate your indulgence and patience and uh appreciate the lord blessing us and helping us with this so god's been good amen but just give you an update remember uh the parking situation and all there should be plenty of parking there's there's probably five or six cars you can park in the back you can park along the sides and the parking lot over here is really uh the front and the front in the front there's maybe six or eight spots but just beyond that there's probably a 50 spot parking that we can use back in there so and you know never know if we can come up with you know maybe several hundred thousand dollars we could just buy the place it's for sale you ever know if anybody feels rambunctious you notice how they bought the tabernacle uh when the tabernacle came up for sale uh three or four people had the money and uh didn't donate it but loaned it to the church and uh brother greene then they bought the building there and fixed it up and over time the church paid those people back but anyway i don't think anybody has that kind of ability but you never know god has done stranger things brother john you know garber is a realtor he told me that the oro valley baptist i think it is up there was on oracle was trying to thinking about redoing their church and they had much money and a lawyer came to him and talked to him and they said well we were thinking about you know doing some upgrades and changes and whatever and he said oh okay he said well let me know what you need well it turned out a woman that had just passed away it was in her will through that lawyer that gave that church and they reinvented their entire place property for three million dollars wow three million dollars was given so god can do anything yeah he owns it all if he wants that that's fine if he wants this i love it i like this so i'm very happy we pay uh brother natan uh 600 a month for the use of the place he didn't give it to us free but um but we you know we pay him six hundred dollars a month which is a little bit more than we were paying at the other place we were a hundred dollars a week over there uh so that's comes out to fifty two hundred dollars a year we're 600 a month here so it's 600 times 12 is what 7200 so not that much more in a year i appreciate you appreciate god's goodness to us thank you for coming today thank you for watching amen and appreciate the lord most of all again i just pray something let's say to bless you and appreciate all your support and help over the times we've been at home and streaming and uh i'm so happy to be back in a facility and a place that we can have church again so amen god richly bless you amen anybody have anything before dismissed amen
