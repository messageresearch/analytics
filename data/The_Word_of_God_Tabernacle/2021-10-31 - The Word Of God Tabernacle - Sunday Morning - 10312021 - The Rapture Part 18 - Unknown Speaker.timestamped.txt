[31:05] [Music]
[31:16] there's an anointing in them amen it
[31:19] draws us closer to god
[31:22] and of course like i said
[31:24] last week
[31:26] god lets us know
[31:28] what pleases him and what doesn't
[31:31] what types of music pleases him and what
[31:33] doesn't yes he always lets me know that
[31:37] the flesh me like a certain type of
[31:39] music i'm sorry brother
[31:46] what's on my heart
[31:47] uh
[31:48] then
[31:50] you know certain type of music
[31:52] you know i remember you know how brother
[31:54] uh
[31:55] green
[31:56] had pardoned
[31:59] uh a certain situation that was going on
[32:01] in the church because of the music and
[32:03] the style of the music that had changed
[32:06] me and brother anthony milano i don't
[32:08] know if you all remember him oh yeah we
[32:10] had caught that before it even has
[32:12] probably even
[32:18] so and i know you know that's and he
[32:20] always checks me on that that kind of
[32:22] what pleases him and what doesn't amen
[32:25] and the flesh may get to go on with that
[32:27] you know what i mean there's two natures
[32:29] we know that
[32:30] the spiritual side is the outside
[32:33] uh
[32:34] and so that the spiritual side lets you
[32:37] know to me
[32:38] god to me how he deals with me that side
[32:40] and this is god's side
[32:45] the other side of the world inside
[32:47] he lets me know that music is just
[32:49] something about it it is
[32:51] a lot of it won't be in heaven amen
[32:53] that's what he do that's how he shares
[32:55] it with me yes so uh
[32:58] you know and i i say and i i come to the
[33:00] conclusion
[33:01] lord nevertheless not my will but i will
[33:05] be done amen can i say something about
[33:07] that to verify that
[33:11] i always have a song on my heart it's
[33:14] not always something i can bring here
[33:16] but it's always for my situation or
[33:19] something i wake up with it i want to
[33:21] sleep with it i work with it and it
[33:23] always changes throughout the day and i
[33:26] know that my angel does always behold
[33:29] the father's face
[33:31] so i know where that music is coming
[33:33] from
[33:34] and it's not boogie woogie it's heaven's
[33:37] amen
[33:38] that's true yeah the holy spirit
[33:41] certainly uh
[33:44] right it divides it that's exactly right
[33:46] amen let's sing that with all our hearts
[33:48] to him
[33:49] let's just stand could we sing that and
[33:52] prepare for our prayers
[33:57] [Music]
[34:13] and the voice
[34:17] [Music]
[34:21] the son of god
[34:26] [Music]

[34:37] with me
[34:39] and he tells me i am

[46:28] it in the name of our lord and savior
[46:30] jesus christ amen amen
[46:33] amen
[46:36] first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13
[46:39] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[46:40] brother concerning them with your us
[46:42] sleep that you saw not even as others
[46:44] which have no hope for if we believe
[46:46] that jesus died and rose again even so
[46:49] them also which sleep in jesus will god
[46:51] bring with him for this we say unto you
[46:54] say unto you by the word of the lord
[46:56] that we which are alive and remain unto
[46:58] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[47:00] them which are asleep for the lord
[47:03] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[47:05] shout with the voice of the archangel
[47:06] with the trump of god the dead in christ
[47:08] shall rise first then we which are alive
[47:11] and remain shall be caught up together
[47:13] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[47:15] in the air so shall we ever be with the
[47:18] lord wherefore comfort one another with
[47:20] these words
[47:22] amen you can be seated if you'd like
[47:27] i i i failed to mention and i sincerely
[47:31] apologize for
[47:32] uh not writing down sister norma uh
[47:35] husband ronnie is not feeling well uh
[47:38] he's kind of been in and out of
[47:40] feeling bad
[47:42] better feeling bad
[47:45] and
[47:46] he's not been for the past couple of
[47:47] days he's not been feeling well i'm
[47:49] assuming uh believing that sister norm
[47:52] is probably at home with him trying to
[47:54] take care of him and help him so please
[47:56] remember brother ronnie
[47:57] epperson if you would that lord would
[47:59] just touch him not necessarily
[48:01] physically
[48:02] the physical touch can come after the
[48:03] spiritual touch spiritual touch is what
[48:06] we desire more than anything for our
[48:08] brother and uh believing he's going to
[48:10] be here just like leah and different
[48:12] ones and families sitting next to sister
[48:14] norma in church here
[48:16] soon and very soon
[48:17] amen but he has
[48:19] been under the weather a little bit so
[48:20] just pray for him if you would now we're
[48:22] going to start this uh from verse
[48:26] 16.
[48:28] i want to go back and read uh what we
[48:30] just read read now the 18th time uh
[48:34] every time that we begin this rapture
[48:37] segment that uh the lord has given us
[48:40] uh each time and
[48:43] i want to major on verse 16. let's go
[48:45] back to the other portions of the verse
[48:48] because verse 16 deals specifically with
[48:51] the shout the voice the trump and i want
[48:54] to begin that today i don't know how
[48:56] long it's going to take
[48:58] i have things the lord give me on the
[49:00] shout and i actually
[49:02] brought it down a little bit from
[49:05] i tried to condense into one service i
[49:07] just don't know that that's going to be
[49:09] possible but i kind of thought maybe
[49:11] each shot voice trump would take a
[49:13] service i'm not sure but uh however the
[49:16] lord leads that's what i want to do but
[49:17] that's what i want to begin on today is
[49:20] to shout the voice to trump of course we
[49:21] know the shout is the first thing that
[49:24] takes place but let's go back to verse
[49:26] 13 because i want to i want to
[49:29] background and
[49:32] hit some highlights of this particular
[49:34] scripture reading before we get to that
[49:37] point okay so uh
[49:40] let's just do that first we'll just take
[49:43] a few minutes but i would not have you
[49:44] to be ignorant brother now
[49:47] paul
[49:48] is
[49:48] is writing here to the church at
[49:50] thessalonica uh about
[49:53] this particular event of the advent of
[49:56] the coming of the lord this particular
[49:59] coming of the lord and and when he
[50:02] begins to approach the subject he tells
[50:05] them first of all he says i would not
[50:07] have you to be ignorant now ignorant is
[50:10] it doesn't mean you uh uh know something
[50:13] and have a differing or a bad opinion
[50:16] about it ignorant means you don't know
[50:18] right right amen and you know brother
[50:19] branham said that a lot of times people
[50:22] don't know how to do certain things he
[50:24] actually tell it specifically about
[50:26] tithing and offering but he said they
[50:28] don't specifically know how to do
[50:30] certain things because they haven't been
[50:32] taught right right right yes uh and that
[50:36] that being taught right means a lot yes
[50:39] because being taught right helps a
[50:41] person
[50:43] uh
[50:44] beyond the point of ignorance because if
[50:46] you're taught right you can't claim
[50:48] ignorance because if your
[50:50] ignorance means you don't know but if
[50:52] you've been taught right that means you
[50:54] know
[50:55] now it's your uh it's in your lap to
[50:58] decide what you're going to do with it
[50:59] at that point but paul's saying i don't
[51:02] want you to be ignorant about this fact
[51:04] i want to teach you properly so you know
[51:08] what is about to unfold what we are to
[51:10] expect
[51:12] what we're looking to amen and i believe
[51:14] that same christ for today now i don't
[51:17] believe any of us in here
[51:19] reach the level of ignorance i believe
[51:21] we've all been taught right through the
[51:23] years and read the scripture and the
[51:25] lord has revealed it to us but
[51:28] understanding his point here is that it
[51:31] there needs to be a teaching on it it
[51:34] needs to be taught right so there's not
[51:36] an ignorance about it
[51:39] concerning them which are asleep now of
[51:41] course he's talking about those that
[51:43] have passed on uh died i don't usually
[51:46] if you've ever noticed my verbiage when
[51:48] i talk about somebody that
[51:50] we say or the world says died i don't
[51:52] normally use the verbiage died
[51:54] especially when we're referring to a
[51:56] christian i i say praise passed on or
[51:59] passed away
[52:01] because
[52:02] i don't believe a christian can die
[52:05] uh their bodies might go to the grave
[52:07] but that body even is gonna come up
[52:09] again one day right so i just don't
[52:12] believe there's death to a christian so
[52:13] i very seldom use the word death so paul
[52:16] here is saying
[52:17] asleep
[52:18] jesus used the same phrase he said use
[52:21] the same word falling asleep they when
[52:23] life needs their body it's a matter of
[52:26] going into a state of rest
[52:28] or being asleep
[52:30] that she saw not now listen i want us to
[52:32] see this part very closely especially
[52:34] since so many people have been falling
[52:37] asleep in this time right this
[52:40] particular point that paul's making
[52:43] concerning them which are asleep that is
[52:46] sorrow not now that's
[52:48] that sorrow is excessive grieving
[52:51] that's uh
[52:53] we know the bible says there's a time to
[52:55] mourn right amen there's a time to live
[52:58] there's a time to die there's a time to
[52:59] mourn uh there's a time to weep there's
[53:02] there there is that time but when that
[53:05] time is past
[53:07] paul is i believe paul is referencing to
[53:10] a continual excessive grieving over a
[53:14] particular individual or something now
[53:17] obviously there's the morning that we
[53:20] have in the grieving but the sorrow that
[53:23] some people have reached to the place of
[53:26] a lack of faith right because their
[53:28] grieving is for whether that person is
[53:31] if they'll never see them again now of
[53:34] course a lot of people don't believe
[53:36] that when you die that you will ever see
[53:38] that person again that's it the finality
[53:40] that's all there is to it but
[53:43] but paul's trying to give us some
[53:45] encouragement that that the heaviness of
[53:48] our grieving doesn't continue to
[53:50] perpetuate it doesn't continue to carry
[53:53] on we get to the place where we realize
[53:56] although we mourn and we grieve and we
[53:58] miss that we don't continue to sorrow
[54:02] for that person because we know that
[54:05] they have hope
[54:07] and we have hope that they died in
[54:10] christ
[54:12] don't sorrow as those who have no hope
[54:16] there's a lot of people that die that
[54:19] that die without christ right and when
[54:22] they die without christ what hope do
[54:24] they have right and the ones that are
[54:26] alive and remain at that point that that
[54:29] are relatives or loved ones of those
[54:32] people and they passed on with no hope
[54:35] they grieve and sorrow heavily because
[54:38] there's no more hope of further
[54:41] advancement in the lord
[54:43] because once life leaves this body
[54:46] that's it
[54:47] that's the dividing point that's the
[54:49] separate i've always said if there's
[54:51] life in the body if there's breath in
[54:53] the lungs there's hope
[54:55] but when that breath is gone then that's
[54:57] the end of it that's it that's the
[54:59] finality of it and paul's saying now
[55:00] don't sorrow like those who have no hope
[55:03] don't sorrow like the unbeliever
[55:06] don't sorrow so much in greece so
[55:08] heavily
[55:10] it gives the the implication that you'll
[55:13] never see that person again because we
[55:15] do have a hope that we will see them
[55:18] again amen so don't be ignorant over the
[55:21] fact that when those die in christ that
[55:24] we won't see them again we will see them
[55:26] again they're just asleep
[55:29] right and when they when
[55:31] when christ rose it just proved that we
[55:34] will rock
[55:35] those that taste death they will rise as
[55:38] well
[55:39] and and
[55:40] don't sorrow to the point that it
[55:42] becomes so grieving heavy greedy because
[55:45] that heavy grieving to that point will
[55:47] actually disturb your spirit right and
[55:50] if that heavy grieving disturbs your
[55:53] spirit then that makes you less than
[55:55] what you should be
[55:57] that brings you to a place where you
[56:00] drop down to a level that you're less
[56:02] useful
[56:03] maybe that's not the right verb it's a
[56:05] pardon but you become less useful to the
[56:08] lord than what you would be in your
[56:10] ought to be conditioned
[56:12] amen we've talked about that before god
[56:14] has us in our ought to be conditioned
[56:16] where we should be and anything sickness
[56:19] or or disease or affliction or or or
[56:22] this point of grieving
[56:24] that disturbs your spirit so much it
[56:27] brings you down or not or to be below
[56:29] where you should be
[56:31] right to serve god because it consumes
[56:33] you it takes over your thoughts it takes
[56:36] over your being it takes over your
[56:38] actions uh your waking moments your
[56:40] dreaming moments
[56:42] uh
[56:43] paul's saying we have hope
[56:46] and that hope is that we will see that
[56:48] person again
[56:49] that will we that we will spend eternity
[56:52] together you know that that's really
[56:55] the foundation
[56:57] just sharing something with you
[56:59] that is really the foundation of my
[57:03] prayers when i pray for your loved ones
[57:05] uh when i pray for your loved ones my
[57:08] prayer to the lord is that that that our
[57:11] family is saved
[57:13] so that we'll spend eternity together
[57:16] and based on that prayer of faith i
[57:18] believe that
[57:20] for all of our families
[57:22] for all of our loved ones i believe that
[57:25] those who are here and those who may
[57:27] have gone on already i believe that
[57:29] right
[57:30] amen not because i prayed it but just
[57:33] because of the faith that i have in god
[57:35] to honor a request of the hearts of his
[57:38] people right
[57:39] amen just like that place next door is
[57:41] gone he honored the request the hearts
[57:43] of his people
[57:45] this is no different friend he honored
[57:47] the request the hearts of the people so
[57:48] i believe that and the whole foundation
[57:51] of it is lord let them be saved so that
[57:53] we spend eternity together yes that they
[57:56] will raise together in heaven and that
[57:58] we'll be together again and spend
[58:00] eternity together isn't that the whole
[58:02] thing and now the whole point
[58:04] amen praise the lord so we don't sorrow
[58:07] as people who have no hope or those who
[58:10] know they have passed without hope amen
[58:13] for a christian there's hope
[58:15] and we believe that you can't look at
[58:17] the circumstances
[58:19] don't don't worry about what it might
[58:21] have looked like or what the
[58:22] circumstances might have presented
[58:23] themselves just look at the grace of god
[58:26] right implore the mercies of god
[58:29] if you want to look at anything like
[58:31] that look through the lens of god and
[58:33] through the grace and mercy of god
[58:35] friend it's more bountiful i know we
[58:38] preach about it we talk about it we sing
[58:40] about it we we give god glory for it but
[58:43] there is no way that we will ever be
[58:45] able to in our little human pee brains
[58:48] to grasp the the vastness
[58:52] and the all-encompassing nature of the
[58:54] grace and mercy of god
[58:57] we'll just never do it
[58:58] it just is not possible
[59:00] we we get a little glimpse of it and and
[59:04] what god's done for us and our families
[59:06] but there's just it just will never
[59:08] happen to be able to grasp the entire
[59:10] scope of what the grace of god means to
[59:13] us
[59:14] what it does for us
[59:16] and and our faith and our loved ones and
[59:19] and the whole the whole picture
[59:21] uh all of it
[59:23] combined together
[59:25] god's grace his mercy goes
[59:28] stretches
[59:29] and and reaches places we can't even
[59:31] imagine
[59:33] amen well it reached me so
[59:35] that proves that point in itself amen
[59:37] reach you didn't it
[59:39] amen
[59:40] praise the lord then
[59:42] is anything too hard for god no
[59:45] amen it's not so let's continue 14 first
[59:48] for if we believe that jesus died and
[59:50] rose again even so them also which sleep
[59:53] in jesus will god bring with him praise
[59:55] the lord it's that simple
[59:57] that's what we're looking for that's
[59:59] what that's the next aspect of this that
[1:00:01] we're talking about i believe that we're
[1:00:03] looking for the dead in christ rising
[1:00:06] yeah amen now you don't wait for the
[1:00:09] dead in christ to rise to get right with
[1:00:11] the lord that's too late yes to me i
[1:00:14] believe that's too late because i
[1:00:17] believe if you're not ready getting
[1:00:19] christ right you won't see him anyhow
[1:00:22] right right and if you don't see him
[1:00:24] then what's the point right
[1:00:26] it won't be for you
[1:00:28] so the the
[1:00:30] the getting right is is is paramount
[1:00:32] right now your heart right with the lord
[1:00:35] right now filled with the holy ghost
[1:00:36] born again having god living in you
[1:00:39] through you being right with god right
[1:00:41] now is the most important thing
[1:00:44] amen even if the rapture doesn't happen
[1:00:46] today
[1:00:47] or in the morning
[1:00:49] you might not be here in the morning
[1:00:51] right i might not be here in the morning
[1:00:54] so it doesn't matter what the day of the
[1:00:56] rapture is what matters to me is when
[1:00:59] life leaves my body
[1:01:01] be right with god now
[1:01:03] that's the most important thing
[1:01:05] have your heart right with god right now
[1:01:07] amen because he may come in the morning
[1:01:09] he may come for me right now he may come
[1:01:11] for us before this service is over we
[1:01:13] don't know
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:15] but we do know that those who are with
[1:01:17] the right with the lord
[1:01:19] then we will see them so that's what
[1:01:21] we're looking for those
[1:01:23] that god is going to bring back we've
[1:01:25] talked about the past couple of sundays
[1:01:27] that that god is going to bring with him
[1:01:30] amen and they're going to appear unto
[1:01:32] many and we will see them
[1:01:34] we will know them amen i believe at
[1:01:37] least my family i believe i know i know
[1:01:39] my dad and my mom and uh my son sister
[1:01:41] brother i'll know my family right and
[1:01:44] then there may be others that come up
[1:01:45] from years gone by i may not know amen
[1:01:48] but that's okay you know there was a
[1:01:50] time i didn't know any of you but what
[1:01:52] did i do what did we do we stuck our
[1:01:53] hand out god bless you it's nice to meet
[1:01:55] you right now i know you
[1:01:58] says amen it's pretty simple amen
[1:02:03] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:02:05] the lord that we which are alive and
[1:02:06] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[1:02:08] not prevent or brother adam again said
[1:02:10] that word is hinder
[1:02:12] them which are asleep
[1:02:15] 16th verse now for the lord himself
[1:02:18] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:02:21] with the voice of the archangel and with
[1:02:24] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:02:26] shall rise first then we which are alive
[1:02:30] and remain
[1:02:31] which i refer to as the alive and remain
[1:02:34] group
[1:02:35] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:02:37] the clouds to meet the lord in the air
[1:02:40] so shall we ever be with the lord now
[1:02:43] as we start his embarking on this shall
[1:02:46] voice trump now i i don't have any new
[1:02:50] or special revelations uh
[1:02:53] obviously like i said before when
[1:02:55] brother branham took the rapture message
[1:02:57] and he hit specific highlights he hit
[1:03:00] like six different things
[1:03:02] uh i haven't counted them i'm just
[1:03:04] guessing that that he just touched on
[1:03:07] and this is one of them the shout out
[1:03:09] the voice drum i don't say that i have
[1:03:11] anything uh
[1:03:13] new or better or different i don't
[1:03:15] believe there is but
[1:03:17] uh
[1:03:18] but just from the highlights and taking
[1:03:21] and breaking them down a little bit
[1:03:22] scripturally even if that's okay so
[1:03:25] today we we see that it starts with the
[1:03:28] voice so let me read this uh let me read
[1:03:30] this quote to you it's in the rapture
[1:03:32] message
[1:03:34] and brother graham says three things
[1:03:36] happen and we just said them to shout
[1:03:38] the voice to trump amen so the subtitle
[1:03:41] i guess to this would be the shout to
[1:03:43] shout the voice to trump a shout a voice
[1:03:46] a trumpet has to happen before jesus
[1:03:50] appears
[1:03:51] the shout of voice of trump has to
[1:03:54] happen before this appears
[1:03:57] now jesus does all three of them while
[1:04:01] he is descending
[1:04:04] when he is descended
[1:04:07] brother brown says all three let me read
[1:04:10] this again
[1:04:11] jesus does all three of them when he's
[1:04:14] descending
[1:04:16] amen in his coming
[1:04:19] now somebody now that in itself would
[1:04:22] dispel
[1:04:24] so many other pentecostal i'll just say
[1:04:27] ideals the seminary ideals of just uh uh
[1:04:33] you know a boulder lightning or a clash
[1:04:35] of thunder or something like that uh
[1:04:39] and and bam there it is
[1:04:42] but we read the other day i think it was
[1:04:44] last sunday first of first corinthians
[1:04:47] 15
[1:04:48] where it says in the moment
[1:04:51] the twinkling of an eye well now a
[1:04:53] moment is a period of time
[1:04:55] amen it may be
[1:04:56] to us a flash
[1:04:59] but remember a thousand years with us is
[1:05:01] just a day with the lord right so
[1:05:04] uh
[1:05:05] what does that moment mean to god right
[1:05:08] so what does it mean when people say oh
[1:05:10] it's all of a sudden bam there it is
[1:05:13] well that that's
[1:05:15] remember what we talked about the
[1:05:17] scripture isn't always as we read it
[1:05:20] like a newspaper right or a magazine or
[1:05:23] an article or something
[1:05:26] god has hid in here the things that he
[1:05:30] desires only for his bride to see
[1:05:32] because it's it's revealed it's written
[1:05:35] by the holy ghost and it's revealed by
[1:05:37] the holy ghost
[1:05:38] and if it's revealed by the holy ghost
[1:05:40] then only those that have the holy ghost
[1:05:43] is it going to be revealed to amen
[1:05:45] others look at it and say oh there it is
[1:05:47] that's simple well you know it's not
[1:05:50] because brother branham says jesus does
[1:05:53] the shout the voice and the trumpet
[1:05:56] while he is descending
[1:05:59] now that phrase where that word
[1:06:01] descending
[1:06:03] leaves you with an understanding that
[1:06:05] this is a period of time
[1:06:09] it's not just a boat of lightning and
[1:06:11] there it is right
[1:06:13] now you think about
[1:06:16] on the day of pentecost
[1:06:19] on the day of pentecost acts 2 says that
[1:06:22] suddenly
[1:06:23] there came
[1:06:25] but how long do we know because we don't
[1:06:28] know
[1:06:29] that it took
[1:06:31] for it to get to that point
[1:06:35] we don't know
[1:06:37] was it instantaneous well it was to them
[1:06:41] is it instantaneous for this well it
[1:06:43] will be to us
[1:06:44] but if we could pull back the cover to
[1:06:47] look beyond the curtain to see the
[1:06:49] spiritual aspect
[1:06:52] god
[1:06:54] i say this is my opinion
[1:06:57] god is likely already descending
[1:07:01] amen
[1:07:02] based on what brother branham said right
[1:07:04] obviously
[1:07:06] because to shout the voice of trump he
[1:07:08] does while he's descending
[1:07:10] and we know what the shout is
[1:07:12] let me finish reading this
[1:07:14] what is the shelf
[1:07:17] it's the message going forth first
[1:07:20] the living bread of life bringing forth
[1:07:24] the bride now he says the bride but what
[1:07:26] he means is the alive and remain group
[1:07:29] amen now of course or this last day
[1:07:32] bribe there's there's people that have
[1:07:34] gone on in the lord that were in this
[1:07:36] truth and passed on before
[1:07:39] and they will resurrect who but there's
[1:07:42] also the alive and remain group
[1:07:44] amen so we we
[1:07:47] the word is said and i've done it i know
[1:07:50] hundreds of times brother brandon did it
[1:07:51] hundreds of times when we say the bride
[1:07:53] when actually we're talking about this
[1:07:55] last day the bride goes back all the way
[1:07:58] like we said before the bride goes
[1:08:00] all the way back to paul
[1:08:02] right
[1:08:03] for this new testament bride from the
[1:08:05] first church eight till today comes from
[1:08:08] everyone that died in christ
[1:08:10] through the through this these church
[1:08:12] ages
[1:08:13] it is the bride
[1:08:15] so
[1:08:16] when he says the bride
[1:08:18] he's talking about this end time bride
[1:08:21] this this end time group that that is
[1:08:24] under the auspice of that message
[1:08:28] that that was brought through brother
[1:08:29] brown
[1:08:30] now
[1:08:31] brother
[1:08:32] what is the shout
[1:08:34] so the question then is
[1:08:36] uh what is the shout the shout is the
[1:08:39] message going forth
[1:08:42] the message going forth so the shout is
[1:08:44] the message
[1:08:46] now
[1:08:48] a shout
[1:08:50] is a message right
[1:08:52] but the specific shout that we're
[1:08:56] talking about for this last time
[1:08:59] is that specific shout of the message
[1:09:02] that brother branham says it's the
[1:09:04] message going forward now a shout is a
[1:09:06] message you could shout a message out
[1:09:09] you can shout without a message
[1:09:11] uh
[1:09:12] you could you could you
[1:09:15] give out a shout
[1:09:17] it still has a message even though there
[1:09:19] may be no verbiage behind it it still
[1:09:21] would have a message
[1:09:23] they could could have uh uh could have a
[1:09:26] meaning to
[1:09:27] people who would shout out a command to
[1:09:28] an animal
[1:09:30] or something
[1:09:31] but a shout is a message it it sends
[1:09:34] something forth
[1:09:35] and the greek
[1:09:37] now this is the only place that this
[1:09:40] greek word is used in the new testament
[1:09:42] only place is this shout here and
[1:09:44] there's there's
[1:09:46] i didn't count them but there's dozens
[1:09:48] of the words shout in the
[1:09:50] uh or several i'll just say that shouts
[1:09:53] in the new testament
[1:09:55] and in the bible but this is the only
[1:09:57] one
[1:09:58] this word here is different from the
[1:10:00] others
[1:10:02] it says an order or command
[1:10:05] specifically a stimulating cry
[1:10:09] now i like that part of it that's that's
[1:10:12] actually that's stimulating christ the
[1:10:13] reason i printed that
[1:10:15] that stimulating cry
[1:10:17] when that voice rang out it wasn't
[1:10:20] brother branham
[1:10:21] there was something behind that voice of
[1:10:23] that man that stimulated something that
[1:10:26] was in you
[1:10:28] so when that message was spoke it
[1:10:31] stimulated something that was it that
[1:10:33] was within you
[1:10:35] and that stimulating cry as we know and
[1:10:38] called the message was something that
[1:10:40] spoke to you and ministered to you now
[1:10:44] there's people around the world that can
[1:10:45] listen to the exact same voice they can
[1:10:48] read the exact same book they can hear
[1:10:50] the same message and it means nothing to
[1:10:53] them
[1:10:54] remember i think it was billy paul gave
[1:10:56] the testimony uh some guy at work gave
[1:10:59] out a message book to another to a
[1:11:01] co-worker
[1:11:03] and the co-worker took it read it he
[1:11:05] came back said i don't want to read one
[1:11:06] more thing this man has to say don't
[1:11:08] give me any more of his books
[1:11:11] and the brother's like well what's the
[1:11:12] matter he said well that man and that
[1:11:14] book called me a buzzard
[1:11:17] and the man took the book and he said
[1:11:18] well that's funny because the same man
[1:11:20] in the same book called me an eagle
[1:11:22] right
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:25] so the song
[1:11:26] it's a message that speaks to them to
[1:11:29] others it's just words
[1:11:31] you didn't just
[1:11:33] you're a buzzard
[1:11:34] that's sad to say but the identification
[1:11:37] of it is what happens when the message
[1:11:39] comes forth same thing when jesus came
[1:11:42] so who is the message to
[1:11:45] so if the shout
[1:11:47] come
[1:11:48] which was the message who is the shout
[1:11:50] to
[1:11:52] the shouts not to the whole world no
[1:11:54] the shout's not to uh
[1:11:56] just anybody that thinks they are a
[1:11:59] christian the shout is to the bride
[1:12:02] amen that's what the shouts for the
[1:12:04] shout is for the bride
[1:12:06] the show was a message and what did he
[1:12:09] say to bring forth the bride
[1:12:13] so there had to be something because
[1:12:15] again this is an international bribe
[1:12:18] so there had to be something that would
[1:12:21] unite this bride internationally
[1:12:24] underneath it the auspice we know about
[1:12:27] the jesus brother graham said that the
[1:12:29] christian worships under the auspice of
[1:12:31] the shed blood of christ amen so what is
[1:12:34] that auspice what is that umbrella that
[1:12:38] that is going to unite the believer from
[1:12:41] around the world
[1:12:42] in all nations kindred tongues people
[1:12:45] what is it that's going to unite them
[1:12:49] the message
[1:12:51] the shout
[1:12:52] the shout going forth is what unites him
[1:12:55] brings forth the bride for this last day
[1:12:59] that's what the that's what the point of
[1:13:01] the shout and the message is for who is
[1:13:03] the message who is the shout out
[1:13:07] the shout is christ
[1:13:09] the message is christ
[1:13:12] this is the message friend or a
[1:13:14] derivative of it
[1:13:15] this came from this if this came from
[1:13:19] this and this is christ then what is
[1:13:21] this
[1:13:23] if this produced this and they produced
[1:13:26] us then what does
[1:13:28] what does that make
[1:13:30] us amen
[1:13:33] the message the shout is the message the
[1:13:36] message is christ
[1:13:38] which is which is what i believe that's
[1:13:41] why brother branham said the jews would
[1:13:42] receive the message one day of course
[1:13:44] they'll receive the message because
[1:13:46] they'll their eyes will open they'll see
[1:13:48] who the messiah is and they'll uh
[1:13:50] they'll put on sackcloth and actually
[1:13:52] they'll mourn and lament that they they
[1:13:54] they killed their very messiah
[1:13:57] they'll receive the message because the
[1:13:59] message is christ
[1:14:00] the shouts to the bride
[1:14:03] it's the message
[1:14:04] to bring her together to unite her
[1:14:07] together it's that voice that cries out
[1:14:10] amen that cries out now
[1:14:13] let's go to matthew chapter 25.
[1:14:24] matthew chapter 25 and remember
[1:14:27] now brother branham said
[1:14:29] that jesus does all three of these
[1:14:32] descending now
[1:14:34] i say brother branham said the bible
[1:14:36] says that
[1:14:38] that's exactly what it says for the lord
[1:14:41] himself shall be sent from heaven with a
[1:14:44] yes i mean that's not just what brother
[1:14:46] brown says that's what the bible says
[1:14:48] amen the lord himself shall descend from
[1:14:50] heaven with a shout
[1:14:53] so it has to be while he's descending
[1:14:57] because that's what the bible says
[1:15:00] now if we think about this in the
[1:15:02] international context
[1:15:04] of of an international bride
[1:15:07] think about this uniting message this
[1:15:10] uniting shout before we get to matthew
[1:15:13] 25
[1:15:14] think about this united this uniting
[1:15:17] shout
[1:15:18] this uniting message that's supposed to
[1:15:22] bring out all the believers under that
[1:15:24] same umbrella
[1:15:26] under that same office now
[1:15:29] we're we're fortunate we're blessed
[1:15:31] because we live in the united states we
[1:15:33] speak english brother branham from the
[1:15:35] hills of kentucky uh spoke english from
[1:15:38] the united states in fact i'm doubly
[1:15:40] blessed because he speaks my language
[1:15:44] hence hands totes carry fetch we know i
[1:15:47] know what all that some you may not i
[1:15:48] know what all that shiny up a tree i
[1:15:50] know exactly i was two years old saying
[1:15:52] up a tree i know exactly what
[1:15:55] you're getting some people overseas they
[1:15:57] have no clue what shitty what is that
[1:15:59] shitty
[1:16:00] that's not in their verbiage yeah they
[1:16:02] have no clue what that means
[1:16:04] but i do and thank god i am i'm glad i
[1:16:07] do now not that a person has to
[1:16:10] understand what shinny means uh over in
[1:16:12] marisha to be able to be in the bride
[1:16:15] that's not necessary but we're blessed
[1:16:17] to understand that we're blessed that
[1:16:20] it's in our language we're blessed to
[1:16:22] know what he's saying in english and we
[1:16:24] can listen to it without interpretation
[1:16:26] without filter without anything else
[1:16:28] right so we are but what is it now to
[1:16:31] the rest of the world i remember when
[1:16:33] brother brennan was born friend there
[1:16:35] was no internet
[1:16:37] there was no cell phones there was no
[1:16:40] email texting
[1:16:42] whatsapp none of that exists there was
[1:16:43] no facebook or met or whatever the guy
[1:16:46] is calling that now
[1:16:47] there was none of that
[1:16:49] that didn't exist
[1:16:50] in fact air travel was what
[1:16:55] non-existent
[1:16:57] car traffic was almost non-existent when
[1:16:59] brother brown was born now i'm not
[1:17:01] talking about what he was
[1:17:02] in the prime of his ministry i'm talking
[1:17:04] about when he was born right
[1:17:06] just didn't exist
[1:17:08] so how was that message going to get
[1:17:10] from the hills of kentucky
[1:17:12] to those brothers and sisters in
[1:17:14] singapore
[1:17:16] or like i said in marisha
[1:17:18] or in some distant south korean where
[1:17:22] how are they going to get it right
[1:17:25] but the message going forth
[1:17:28] that
[1:17:30] i i hope i'll get to today to to show
[1:17:32] that
[1:17:34] had
[1:17:35] i think had to get to a point
[1:17:38] to where this message
[1:17:41] and the gospel
[1:17:42] which is the message
[1:17:44] brought
[1:17:45] around the world internationally
[1:17:48] to reach every
[1:17:50] corner
[1:17:52] of the far reaches of this planet
[1:17:55] to every person
[1:17:57] i mean if you look at matthew 24
[1:18:00] look what jesus said
[1:18:04] he said and this and this gospel of the
[1:18:06] kingdom shall be preached in all the
[1:18:10] world
[1:18:11] for a witness unto all nations
[1:18:15] then shall the end come right
[1:18:19] how is that going to happen
[1:18:21] it couldn't happen in history even
[1:18:23] though the earth was smaller at that
[1:18:24] time or you know
[1:18:26] parts of the world we didn't they didn't
[1:18:28] know about existed
[1:18:31] how would it happen how did it even
[1:18:33] happened in that way that we're talking
[1:18:35] about even when brother branham was born
[1:18:38] to have brought this about around the
[1:18:41] world right
[1:18:43] it couldn't
[1:18:46] now
[1:18:46] i believe we all could have been
[1:18:48] filthy rich if we just listened to
[1:18:50] brother brown
[1:18:52] because brother brown told us what the
[1:18:53] cars were going to be like
[1:18:55] he told us what the uh what the uh the
[1:18:58] increase in
[1:19:00] in technology would be
[1:19:03] amen i mean
[1:19:04] could you imagine i can imagine from
[1:19:07] when i was age having a phone in my hand
[1:19:10] like this
[1:19:12] didn't even know what a computer was
[1:19:15] muscle
[1:19:19] computer
[1:19:21] information from all over the world yeah
[1:19:24] it didn't exist when brother brown was
[1:19:25] here
[1:19:26] didn't exist even when brother adam died
[1:19:30] but the message carries on
[1:19:32] the message continues to reverberate
[1:19:34] around the world
[1:19:36] amen why it had to right
[1:19:39] to fulfill scripture
[1:19:42] and to bring everybody that's the
[1:19:44] believer that is the seed of god under
[1:19:46] that umbrella for the point of hearing
[1:19:49] that word and that seed coming to life
[1:19:52] being born again so that we get to the
[1:19:54] place that when this rapture takes place
[1:19:57] everyone that is his will hear it
[1:20:00] and know it
[1:20:02] amen be revealed to them right
[1:20:06] that shout had to go forth
[1:20:08] it had to continue to press forward amen
[1:20:11] and it still does and the message is
[1:20:13] still going forth yes amen brother john
[1:20:16] was talking about listening this morning
[1:20:19] amen that's it's it's still going forth
[1:20:23] because it has to
[1:20:25] amen it's got to bring that fulfillment
[1:20:28] matthew 25.
[1:20:30] i had to turn over there matthew 25.
[1:20:38] i know we've read this a couple of times
[1:20:40] but um
[1:20:44] there's a particular part in here we
[1:20:45] talk about the shout
[1:20:47] that we want to get to
[1:20:49] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[1:20:51] likened unto ten virgins which took
[1:20:54] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[1:20:56] room
[1:20:57] five of them were wise and five were
[1:20:58] foolish they that were foolish took
[1:21:01] their lamps and took no oil with them
[1:21:04] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:21:07] with their lambs
[1:21:09] while the bridegroom carried they all
[1:21:11] slumbered and slept
[1:21:14] and at midnight there was a cry mate
[1:21:17] there was a shout that went forth
[1:21:20] a cry was made behold the bridegroom
[1:21:23] cometh go ye out to meet him
[1:21:26] now when they were all slumbering all
[1:21:28] sleeping foolish and wise virgin alike
[1:21:32] they were all slumbering and sleeping at
[1:21:34] that time god sends a shout
[1:21:38] god sends a cry a message behold the
[1:21:41] lamb of god
[1:21:43] though you out to meet him
[1:21:46] that's exactly what the message does
[1:21:49] people want to say that brother grant
[1:21:51] appointed uh pointed them to himself
[1:21:54] brother i've never appointed anybody to
[1:21:56] himself
[1:21:57] he always pointed everyone to jesus
[1:22:01] christ
[1:22:02] always
[1:22:03] i challenged anybody
[1:22:06] now paul said follow me as i follow
[1:22:08] christ
[1:22:09] but i challenged anybody to show me or
[1:22:12] brother branham encouraged someone to
[1:22:14] follow him right amen
[1:22:17] i mean in the context that he was god
[1:22:19] right right now people still worship him
[1:22:21] as god baptized his name things like
[1:22:23] that but that wasn't his doing right no
[1:22:27] brother random always pointed to god
[1:22:30] that's why the message
[1:22:32] the shout the pride went forth to wake
[1:22:36] up that bride
[1:22:38] to wake them up and say behold there he
[1:22:41] is go out and meet him yes greet him
[1:22:45] well that was that's what the message
[1:22:47] was for
[1:22:48] it was to prepare a bride it was to wake
[1:22:51] her up it was to stir her it was to get
[1:22:54] her ready and prepared physically
[1:22:57] mentally emotionally to get ready
[1:23:00] spiritually of course
[1:23:01] to get her ready
[1:23:03] that stirring that come and stirred your
[1:23:06] heart that that uh uh
[1:23:09] stimulating cry that went forth as we
[1:23:12] said
[1:23:13] that stimulating shout that came forth
[1:23:16] to tell everybody we're here this is the
[1:23:20] time
[1:23:22] be ready don't miss it
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:26] that shout that message that went forth
[1:23:29] that cry
[1:23:30] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[1:23:33] to meet him
[1:23:34] and that was that was the cry that we
[1:23:36] were to have see
[1:23:38] and
[1:23:39] every significant move of god has always
[1:23:42] come with a shout
[1:23:44] right you think oh that shout was
[1:23:47] exclude
[1:23:48] this last day no it's not
[1:23:50] right amen that specific shout is yes
[1:23:55] this specific message through that
[1:23:57] specific prophet absolutely
[1:24:01] but every true move of god has always
[1:24:03] had a message
[1:24:05] has always had a shout out and has
[1:24:08] always had a prophet for god to speak
[1:24:10] through right amen amen always been
[1:24:14] let's go look at one
[1:24:22] numbers chapter 23
[1:24:27] verse 16.
[1:24:30] numbers 23 16.
[1:24:33] now
[1:24:35] we we we have the scene
[1:24:37] of bail trying to convince balaam
[1:24:41] to get him to curse israel
[1:24:46] you know how it is
[1:24:48] now look we're all human
[1:24:51] numbers 23. we're all human
[1:24:55] we all make mistakes we all do things
[1:24:57] say things
[1:24:58] uh we all fall short from time to time
[1:25:01] things i'm not talking about backsliding
[1:25:02] we're just talking about in the flesh
[1:25:04] we're just human
[1:25:06] and
[1:25:08] how often
[1:25:10] would that slip up be in front of
[1:25:13] somebody else
[1:25:14] another believer or unbeliever
[1:25:17] or maybe someone who wants your demise
[1:25:21] someone who would relish to see you fall
[1:25:24] right is there anybody in your life like
[1:25:27] that
[1:25:29] that would they would be they would be
[1:25:30] happy
[1:25:32] if you were injured
[1:25:34] or hurt
[1:25:37] there's people like that friend and
[1:25:40] that's exactly who baloch was balak was
[1:25:43] that man to israel
[1:25:45] because israel and balak were at such
[1:25:48] odds and enemies and baloch
[1:25:51] couldn't come close to standing up to
[1:25:55] israel he had he had nothing to hold on
[1:25:58] to israel so he comes to this hireling
[1:26:00] prophet balaam and says balaam i'll give
[1:26:03] you this i'll do this for you if you'll
[1:26:05] just curse my enemy
[1:26:07] because see bam's prophecies were true
[1:26:10] and they came to pass
[1:26:12] amen
[1:26:14] even if he was a hireling prophet he was
[1:26:15] still a prophet
[1:26:17] and he was doing what he said still come
[1:26:19] in still standing today we know that
[1:26:22] amen whoever blesses israel is blessed
[1:26:24] whoever curses israel's curse probably
[1:26:26] the only
[1:26:28] probably the only thin thread that this
[1:26:31] country is hanging on with god is that
[1:26:34] we're still blessing israel right amen
[1:26:37] there were even
[1:26:39] there were even enough democrats
[1:26:43] that are out there
[1:26:45] that
[1:26:48] refuted some others
[1:26:50] to give israel and replenish israel with
[1:26:53] their iron dome system
[1:26:56] still even that
[1:26:58] mine so
[1:27:00] that's probably
[1:27:01] that that prophecy available is probably
[1:27:03] that one thin thread that this country
[1:27:06] is hanging by that that even has any
[1:27:08] kind of inkling of the blessings of god
[1:27:11] at all really
[1:27:13] but is that prophecy whoever's blessed
[1:27:15] is israel blessed we still bless amen i
[1:27:18] mean to a point not like we did but to a
[1:27:20] point still it still does
[1:27:23] so bailout goes to balaam and and tries
[1:27:25] to get balaam to curse israel curse my
[1:27:28] enemy because if you curse money because
[1:27:31] see that
[1:27:32] you know they they've made these little
[1:27:34] mistakes now
[1:27:36] balaam the they've made these little
[1:27:37] mistakes and they've done these little
[1:27:39] things and they've said these little
[1:27:40] things in the game saying of course
[1:27:43] see all those things have happened so
[1:27:45] god's probably mad at them now
[1:27:47] so since god's mad at them and they've
[1:27:49] made these little mistakes why don't you
[1:27:51] go curse them for me
[1:27:56] god's got to be mad at him so this is
[1:27:58] the perfect time that they've had little
[1:28:00] slip ups they've had make their little
[1:28:02] mistakes so god's got to be mad at them
[1:28:04] so go curse them
[1:28:07] and balaam says bring me seven altars
[1:28:09] set me up seven altars and then seven
[1:28:10] sacrifices and all and stand beside the
[1:28:14] stand beside the sacrifice
[1:28:16] and he says i'm going to go see if the
[1:28:18] lord will talk to me and
[1:28:20] god met him there
[1:28:22] talk to balaam all right said him don't
[1:28:24] you dare
[1:28:25] curse what i've blessed
[1:28:28] and basically everything the opposite of
[1:28:30] balak
[1:28:31] balaam had to say
[1:28:33] and bailout comes back and says
[1:28:35] what have you done to me you've done
[1:28:37] exactly the opposite of what i asked for
[1:28:40] now they're blessed even more
[1:28:42] it's okay baylor let's go to a different
[1:28:44] area
[1:28:46] let's go to a different church let's go
[1:28:48] to a different place maybe they're not
[1:28:50] as perfect as the other ones were oh
[1:28:52] we're all just as human as the next
[1:28:54] friend
[1:28:56] we all we all make mistakes and say
[1:28:59] things we're all human all right amen
[1:29:02] that that's why thank god there's
[1:29:04] forgiveness because there's there's the
[1:29:06] love of god and there's forgiveness and
[1:29:08] there's moving forward with god there's
[1:29:10] the bearing of the sin and the sea of
[1:29:11] forgetfulness and amen but hey let's go
[1:29:14] to the place because these this church
[1:29:16] over here they're worse than these guys
[1:29:18] maybe god will really curse them then
[1:29:21] 16th first let's read it
[1:29:23] and the lord met balaam again now this
[1:29:25] is second time
[1:29:28] remember balaam goes to him three times
[1:29:30] before god finally says just go do it do
[1:29:32] whatever you're gonna do you're gonna do
[1:29:34] it anyway
[1:29:36] and the lord met balaam and put a word
[1:29:38] in his mouth
[1:29:41] and said go again unto balak and say
[1:29:43] thus
[1:29:45] and when he came to him behold he stood
[1:29:47] by his burnt offering and the princes of
[1:29:49] moab with him and baylock said unto him
[1:29:52] what hath the lord spoken and he took up
[1:29:55] his parable and said rise up balak and
[1:29:58] hear hearken unto me thou son of zipper
[1:30:02] god is not a man that he should lie
[1:30:04] neither the son of man that he should
[1:30:06] repent
[1:30:07] in other words what i said the first
[1:30:09] time goes
[1:30:11] what i told you the first time is what i
[1:30:13] meant
[1:30:14] i didn't tell you the first time over
[1:30:16] here to tell you something different
[1:30:18] over here that's why brother branham
[1:30:20] said if god does one way one time he's
[1:30:23] got to do it the exact same way all the
[1:30:25] way through he's not god
[1:30:27] amen and he said he's not a god that he
[1:30:30] would lie to the son of man he should
[1:30:31] repent what he said a minute ago is what
[1:30:34] he meant
[1:30:35] amen
[1:30:36] have he said and shall he not do it or
[1:30:39] hath he spoken and shall he not make it
[1:30:42] good
[1:30:43] behold i have received command a
[1:30:45] commandment to bless
[1:30:48] and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse
[1:30:52] it
[1:30:53] praise the lord
[1:30:54] israel is blessed
[1:30:57] god has blessed them
[1:30:59] no matter what they did no matter what
[1:31:02] they're going to do they are blessed and
[1:31:04] i have nothing i can do about it right
[1:31:07] that's right
[1:31:10] see i i i want you to get to a place
[1:31:12] from where you don't look at israel this
[1:31:14] in this look at yourself right yeah and
[1:31:17] then put yourself in their place i'm i'm
[1:31:19] a child of god i'm i'm a chosen of the
[1:31:22] lord i am a hand-picked selected by god
[1:31:25] child son and daughter a son of god
[1:31:28] friend amen
[1:31:29] put yourself in that place
[1:31:32] you are blessed
[1:31:34] regardless of what the devil tries to do
[1:31:36] or say you are blessed no matter what
[1:31:38] you did done going to do you are blessed
[1:31:41] and you will always be blessed
[1:31:43] because god has blessed you and god's
[1:31:45] not repenting from that
[1:31:48] god's not taking that back from you
[1:31:51] oh you made a little mistake i'm
[1:31:53] reversing my blessings no no no it
[1:31:55] doesn't work that
[1:31:56] way god is a god that does not
[1:32:00] take back on his word amen he stands on
[1:32:04] his word
[1:32:05] i cannot reverse it
[1:32:07] he has not been held iniquity listen
[1:32:09] this is the point i want to get to now
[1:32:12] he israel has not been held iniquity in
[1:32:15] jacob or god i should say
[1:32:17] uh has not been held iniquity in jacob
[1:32:19] neither has he seen perverseness in
[1:32:22] israel remember what does god see amen
[1:32:25] now look israel made a lot of mistakes
[1:32:27] right
[1:32:28] you go and read everything that israel
[1:32:30] did and coming out of egypt and all the
[1:32:33] whining and the complaining and the
[1:32:34] crying
[1:32:35] you look at all that israel did but what
[1:32:37] matters
[1:32:38] what matters what matters is what god
[1:32:41] sees
[1:32:43] what matters is what god looks like and
[1:32:45] what and what he's concerned with and
[1:32:48] what he saw is no iniquity in jacob
[1:32:51] neither has he seen
[1:32:53] in israel the lord is with him and the
[1:32:57] shout of the king
[1:32:58] is among them amen
[1:33:01] the shout of the king was in the camp
[1:33:04] the word of the lord was in the camp of
[1:33:07] israel now
[1:33:09] now you've got a dividing point even
[1:33:11] through the prophet balaam's words
[1:33:14] the difference between moses and balaam
[1:33:18] is that god was with moses
[1:33:21] and his people yes and the shout of the
[1:33:23] king was in their camp amen the message
[1:33:28] the word of god was with moses it wasn't
[1:33:32] with balaam oh he was a prophet he could
[1:33:34] prophesy in those things but god the
[1:33:37] word of god was not with him the shout
[1:33:40] was not with him the shout was with
[1:33:42] moses
[1:33:43] the message was with moses yes and god
[1:33:47] and moses and israel is who god honored
[1:33:51] because god was with moses god was moses
[1:33:54] was god's chosen vessel
[1:33:57] right god was moses was god's chosen man
[1:34:01] and that's who god was with even with
[1:34:04] moses's mistakes and failures
[1:34:06] god was with him now moses wasn't able
[1:34:09] to take the children over the promised
[1:34:10] land
[1:34:11] amen but he never stopped being a chosen
[1:34:14] vessel
[1:34:16] regardless you find them over in
[1:34:18] revelation 11 we read last week
[1:34:21] moses and elijah he was still god's
[1:34:24] chosen vessel not not balaam
[1:34:27] but moses
[1:34:29] the shout of the king the message the
[1:34:31] word of god was with israel
[1:34:35] god was with them god was leading them
[1:34:38] god led them by a pillar of clout by the
[1:34:40] day a
[1:34:41] pillar fire by night right because god
[1:34:44] was with them
[1:34:46] amen
[1:34:47] he was their chosen that's where the
[1:34:49] message was
[1:34:51] look now
[1:34:54] fundamentally
[1:34:56] i said look here
[1:34:57] fundamentally
[1:34:59] he said who do you say this is uh
[1:35:02] december 1964.
[1:35:05] he said now we all blow up the feasts he
[1:35:08] said uh uh the gang single quarter we're
[1:35:11] all one and they did the same thing
[1:35:13] balaam bam told them to we are all one
[1:35:16] we're all one big family and yeah they
[1:35:19] you know fundamentally they were
[1:35:22] but this shot wasn't with them
[1:35:25] amen the shot was with israel right
[1:35:28] there's the difference
[1:35:29] oh we all believe in one god see because
[1:35:32] moab moab was
[1:35:34] moab was the son of life amen
[1:35:37] moab was the product of lot and his
[1:35:39] daughter
[1:35:42] they were one they were one big family
[1:35:45] but they weren't one spiritually
[1:35:48] god wasn't with moab god wasn't with
[1:35:50] baylor he was with moses
[1:35:53] amen the shout was with moses
[1:35:55] fundamentally they were perfectly right
[1:35:58] watch balaam up there just as
[1:35:59] fundamental as any good baptist
[1:36:00] president maybe i shouldn't have read
[1:36:02] that
[1:36:03] today he come up there and there was
[1:36:05] israel
[1:36:06] that undenominated group that was a
[1:36:08] nation israel wasn't a nation
[1:36:11] it was a people at that time they didn't
[1:36:14] go
[1:36:14] uh
[1:36:16] they didn't want to go god's way after a
[1:36:17] while they wanted to be like the rest of
[1:36:19] the nations that's when they failed but
[1:36:21] they but he
[1:36:22] recognized balaam even recognized that
[1:36:26] the shout of god the message the word of
[1:36:29] god was with moses and israel
[1:36:33] it wasn't with balaam
[1:36:34] it wasn't going to be with bala
[1:36:37] because balaam told him god's done it
[1:36:39] and i can't reverse it
[1:36:41] i can't change it
[1:36:43] amen
[1:36:44] let's look at another one real quick i'm
[1:36:46] going to try to get this give me a few
[1:36:47] more minutes
[1:36:50] because i want to try to finish this
[1:36:51] shower i won't finish it because like i
[1:36:54] said there's so many other things you
[1:36:56] you go through every church
[1:36:58] every church age had a shower yes every
[1:37:00] church age had its message and it's
[1:37:02] messenger right you had the four gospels
[1:37:05] you had the four beasts
[1:37:07] you know the the the lion the ox the the
[1:37:10] eagle the man you had an anointing you
[1:37:13] had a message from each one an anointing
[1:37:15] that followed every one of them but
[1:37:17] that's all that's a whole other
[1:37:20] service or two if you will um
[1:37:24] but let's go to saint john
[1:37:26] if you gave me those few more minutes
[1:37:29] i could do like brother wilson does and
[1:37:31] asked for five minutes from everybody
[1:37:32] and that
[1:37:38] that's a that's a brother wilson henry's
[1:37:41] specialty
[1:37:45] and he used to pass our church two and
[1:37:47] three hundred people so can you imagine
[1:37:49] five minutes per person
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:54] saint john chapter one
[1:37:58] we're gonna bring it down home finish
[1:38:00] this up saint john 1 19
[1:38:03] talk about john the baptist now
[1:38:07] and this is the record of john when the
[1:38:09] jews sent priests and levites from
[1:38:11] jerusalem to ask him who art thou
[1:38:15] and he confessed and denied not but
[1:38:16] confessed i am not the christ
[1:38:19] now that's exactly what brother branham
[1:38:21] did although people still continue to
[1:38:22] follow him
[1:38:24] they still continue to follow john too
[1:38:27] he denied that but confessed i am not
[1:38:30] the christ
[1:38:31] and they asked him what then art thou
[1:38:33] elias
[1:38:34] he said i am not of thou the prophet and
[1:38:37] he answered no
[1:38:39] then said then to him who art thou that
[1:38:41] we may give an answer to them that said
[1:38:44] what sayeth thou of thyself he said i am
[1:38:47] the voice
[1:38:48] amen right of one crying in the
[1:38:51] wilderness
[1:38:53] now that voice comes with a shout
[1:39:00] right
[1:39:02] make straight the way of the lord as
[1:39:04] said the prophet ezias
[1:39:07] and they which were sent of the
[1:39:09] pharisees and they asked him and said
[1:39:11] unto him why baptizeth thou then if thou
[1:39:14] be not that christ nor elias neither
[1:39:16] that prophet because he had a message
[1:39:19] i answered them saying i baptized with
[1:39:21] water but there standeth one among you
[1:39:23] whom you know i'm not
[1:39:25] he it is who can coming after me is
[1:39:28] preferred before me whose shoe latchet
[1:39:30] i'm not worthy to unloose
[1:39:32] these things were done in bet bara
[1:39:35] beyond jordan where john was baptizing
[1:39:38] the next day
[1:39:40] amen
[1:39:41] praise the lord the message he had been
[1:39:43] espousing to the people showed up
[1:39:46] right
[1:39:47] the message he was telling them about
[1:39:50] preaching to them about and baptizing
[1:39:52] them in showed up
[1:39:55] next day john seeth jesus coming unto
[1:39:58] him and saith behold the lamb of god
[1:40:01] which taketh away the sin of the world
[1:40:04] amen john the baptist
[1:40:06] forerunning the first coming of christ
[1:40:09] behold the lamb of god we just read that
[1:40:11] matthew 25 but matthew 25 is not john
[1:40:14] the baptist
[1:40:16] matthew 25's brother
[1:40:18] the cry that goes forth behold the
[1:40:20] bridegroom coming go you out to meet him
[1:40:22] amen that's the that's the introduction
[1:40:25] of the second advent that's the
[1:40:26] introduction of his next coming of the
[1:40:29] one we're looking for ammo this one
[1:40:33] was his physical corporal body coming
[1:40:36] and john the baptist was the messenger
[1:40:40] with the message to introduce that to
[1:40:43] the people
[1:40:44] when he saw him coming
[1:40:46] behold the lamb of god which taketh away
[1:40:49] the sin of the world
[1:40:51] there he is
[1:40:52] amen
[1:40:53] doesn't say but the invocation there uh
[1:40:57] the invitation go you
[1:40:59] go follow him amen amen he's the one i
[1:41:03] must decrease that he increased
[1:41:06] he's a lord because that was his message
[1:41:09] the introduction that was to bring it
[1:41:11] forth the the coming of the messiah the
[1:41:14] coming of the sacrifice
[1:41:16] that was his first coming that's why he
[1:41:18] had that john the baptist introduced or
[1:41:21] before ran that first coming
[1:41:23] now we know
[1:41:26] for the second coming was for reign
[1:41:30] amen
[1:41:31] the second coming brother brown full ran
[1:41:34] the second coming
[1:41:35] amen or the message
[1:41:38] the shout
[1:41:40] the message
[1:41:41] for run the second
[1:41:44] coming let me see here look away to
[1:41:47] jesus he said it's tightening we see it
[1:41:50] tightening friend don't we i mean i
[1:41:52] don't know how much longer this united
[1:41:53] states is going to have the freedoms
[1:41:55] uh that we have to worship the lord
[1:41:57] places all around the world don't have
[1:41:59] that freedom that we have today but you
[1:42:01] know you say well that's in the
[1:42:03] constitution friend all it takes is
[1:42:04] enough like-minded people to get rid of
[1:42:07] any document that we have
[1:42:08] right that's right they just get enough
[1:42:10] like-minded people and you say what that
[1:42:12] yeah that's gone
[1:42:14] done with right amen
[1:42:16] over
[1:42:17] it's tightening and then when it comes
[1:42:19] time the press comes to a place where
[1:42:20] you're pressed out when you're pressed
[1:42:23] out watch down what i'm telling in a few
[1:42:25] minutes watch the third pull then see
[1:42:26] it's absolutely to the total loss but it
[1:42:29] will be for the bride and the church
[1:42:32] and i want to say this he said i've
[1:42:33] never said it before but according to
[1:42:35] scripture according to what he said 33
[1:42:37] years ago
[1:42:38] on the ohio river 1933 he said rather
[1:42:42] he said everything has happened just
[1:42:44] exactly
[1:42:46] listen now he said i may not do it
[1:42:50] brother says i may not do it
[1:42:54] but this message
[1:42:56] will introduce jesus christ to the world
[1:42:59] amen
[1:43:01] amen for sure why for a last day yes for
[1:43:04] a shout out
[1:43:06] a shout that goes forth as he is
[1:43:09] descending
[1:43:10] preparing his bride getting her those
[1:43:13] that actually have gone on and the alive
[1:43:15] and remain group ready you believe that
[1:43:18] message
[1:43:19] those each one down to the age they
[1:43:20] believe their message they live to their
[1:43:22] message they'll be there amen whether
[1:43:24] it's martin or luther or wesley or
[1:43:26] whoever it was message they live to that
[1:43:29] message they'll be there
[1:43:31] amen just like this last day bride this
[1:43:33] message that we follow we live that
[1:43:36] message will be there amen amen
[1:43:40] he said i may not do it but this message
[1:43:43] will introduce jesus christ to the world
[1:43:46] for as john the baptist was sent to
[1:43:48] forerun the first coming so is the
[1:43:50] message to forerun the second coming
[1:43:54] that's why
[1:43:55] even when brother branham passed away
[1:43:58] the possibility
[1:44:00] of this message reaching the far reaches
[1:44:03] and corners of this world to every ear
[1:44:07] was not possible
[1:44:10] or shall i say very improbable
[1:44:14] in 1965 when he passed away
[1:44:17] but today with what we've got the
[1:44:19] technology
[1:44:21] and and of course donald that but the
[1:44:23] people that the lord has gotten and
[1:44:25] coming to the message around the world
[1:44:28] the books are printed the the audio the
[1:44:32] the translation and all the different
[1:44:34] languages
[1:44:35] oh sure they they uh
[1:44:37] a person whatever in the far reaches of
[1:44:39] another country they may have been able
[1:44:41] to have a book or something but they
[1:44:42] don't speak english right
[1:44:45] they may have gotten a tape but they
[1:44:46] don't listen they don't understand
[1:44:48] english what good was it to them but in
[1:44:51] this day with this message still going
[1:44:53] forth
[1:44:54] and all the translations and all the
[1:44:56] work that's been done to get the books
[1:44:58] to get the tapes to get the message into
[1:45:00] the hands of the people in their own
[1:45:02] native language
[1:45:05] no wonder the message
[1:45:07] had to forerun the second coming of
[1:45:09] christ yes because brother brown has
[1:45:11] been off the scene now for almost 56
[1:45:14] years right
[1:45:16] but the message
[1:45:18] for run
[1:45:19] the shout
[1:45:21] for run the second coming of christ
[1:45:23] before run the second coming behold the
[1:45:26] lamb of god that takes away the sin of
[1:45:27] the world he uses a phrase actually from
[1:45:29] john the baptist
[1:45:31] amen
[1:45:33] in the rapture message
[1:45:37] amen in the rapture message i'll close
[1:45:41] he said you're not blind people
[1:45:43] you are sensible people
[1:45:46] let's settle this out with this now
[1:45:49] amen
[1:45:52] you're sensible people
[1:45:54] if i stood here and said those things
[1:45:56] for prejudice i say it because it's life
[1:46:00] because listen now he said because i'm
[1:46:04] responsible to god for saying it amen
[1:46:09] that's powerful friend
[1:46:11] you responsible to god
[1:46:13] what you what are you responsible to god
[1:46:17] for
[1:46:18] amen
[1:46:19] everybody's responsible to god
[1:46:22] something somebody yeah
[1:46:25] amen
[1:46:26] parents
[1:46:27] you have children you take it on
[1:46:28] yourself
[1:46:30] you're responsible to god for those
[1:46:31] children yes just like we were when we
[1:46:33] had children
[1:46:35] responsible to god for them i didn't
[1:46:36] care what all the others said i don't
[1:46:38] care what anybody advice whatever
[1:46:41] people would tell say advice but that's
[1:46:43] all fine and good friend but we were the
[1:46:45] ones responsible for our children not
[1:46:47] you right right amen not i don't mean
[1:46:49] you i just mean you generally
[1:46:52] not not all nobody else
[1:46:54] we were
[1:46:56] full of god when brother brown says i'm
[1:46:58] responsible to god that's a powerful
[1:47:01] statement
[1:47:02] and he says i'm responsible to god for
[1:47:04] saying it
[1:47:06] i must say it
[1:47:08] my message he said all the time knowing
[1:47:11] back there under healing and so forth
[1:47:12] like that was just to catch the people's
[1:47:14] attention
[1:47:15] knowing that the message would come
[1:47:18] praise the lord had to
[1:47:20] come and here it is
[1:47:23] them seven seals open mysteries showing
[1:47:25] all those things what has happened
[1:47:28] he didn't know what he said but he knew
[1:47:31] that there would be a message come
[1:47:32] because that's what he that's what was
[1:47:34] told to him that's what his
[1:47:36] responsibility was to get that message
[1:47:38] out
[1:47:39] to get that message to the people
[1:47:42] the spirit of god told him store up that
[1:47:44] food
[1:47:45] he meant put that food store that food
[1:47:47] up in the storehouse why because we need
[1:47:50] it
[1:47:51] for today we still need it for right now
[1:47:53] for today we still feast on that word
[1:47:56] yes that fresh manna
[1:47:59] he said therefore and let me finish with
[1:48:02] this therefore the message
[1:48:06] calls the bride together

[1:48:10] the shout
[1:48:12] that's i i didn't i know i'm looking at
[1:48:15] you but that's actually what he said
[1:48:16] that's not my part that he said that
[1:48:18] therefore the message calls the bride
[1:48:20] together see the shout calls the bride

[1:48:59] with that shout
[1:49:00] out bringing the people together
