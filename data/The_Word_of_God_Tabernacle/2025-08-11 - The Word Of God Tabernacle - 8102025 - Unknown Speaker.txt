Amen. We got some prayer requests to mention to you this morning. Amen. Um got a request here. Says, "Ple uh pray for Danny." Uh pray that Danny, excuse me. We pray that Danny will be able to find uh the right work from home from home job. Sounds familiar. Sister Julie has been looking the same thing trying to anyway. Um work from home job. He's uh tried several but none so far. Uh has worked out. Uh also this coming Monday is his birthday. Maybe tomorrow. This coming Monday, tomorrow, &gt;&gt; it is &gt;&gt; Danny's birthday. &gt;&gt; It's his, too. What a coincidence. Who would have thought? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's a That's I guess a roundabout way of saying it's his birthday tomorrow. &gt;&gt; No. Praise the Lord. So, very happy. I um I usually announce birthdays at the end, but we'll have it there. Amen for now. So, praise the Lord. So thankful. So happy to have brother Dennis and brother Danny. Amen. And so thankful the Lord bless them. Happy birthday. Amen. Remember that job. Of course, Sister Julie been looking for one as well. So remember that prayer, too. &gt;&gt; Um, Sister Sharia, Art, and the kids aren't with us today. Uh, kids got sick this week and apparently she got it the other day, too. So, uh, please remember them. They're not going to be here. They're out today. Sister Sheilia a text and said that she had gotten an ox in the ditch this morning trying to get that out. Um did not specify but the Lord knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. So sister Shul is not with us today. Please remember her in prayer. Remember the Pats uh of course sister Karen and brother Tom's in the mountains now and we just part of us. So we want to continue to remember them in prayer of course. Uh also, uh as you probably all know, Sister Dorothy went home to be with the Lord this week, uh up in the White Mountains. We had every every every intention. In fact, I told my wife the other day, um I think it was maybe after last Sunday's service when she was in hospice care, uh that we were planning to go to the funeral, but they made the funeral on the exact same day as Sister Lydia's. Uh, so we're not going to be able to attend Sister Dorothy's funeral. Uh, regrettably, I wish we could. Uh, I would have I would have loved so much to have honored Sister Dorothy's life and precious sister she was to be there uh for that family and she will greatly be missed. Saints, I know I've said this several times with other people, but the world became a worse place to live when Sister Dorothy passed away. &gt;&gt; Amen. because one more precious, good, decent, honest, godly person has left this earth. Amen. And she was one of them. It was u I could eulogize her for just a minute. It was a special thing to go up there and minister for those people and walk out uh on that platform and see sister Dorothy's smiling face out there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, and to hear her amens was, uh, very special because she just loved the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, she loved life, but she loved the Lord. Uh, I don't know that I think I don't think I ever saw I'm sure she did. I don't think I ever saw Sister Dorothy Frame. I I don't think I ever saw her without a smile on her face. Me personally anyway. Again, I know she I'm sure she did. We all have emotions of sadness and disappointment and all, but I she always had a smile on her face. When we went outside after church, she was smiling. She was laughing. Uh some might call it giggling, but she was just happy. She was just a very happy person. Uh it would just meant so much to see her smiling face out there. When you said something, she would just light up. And &gt;&gt; uh it was it was an absolute honor to minister to Sister Dorothy. you will be missed so very much so. But remember the family in prayer. Um we know them very well obviously, but please remember them in prayer. Um that the Lord would just bless and comfort them. Uh the service, the memorial service for Sister Dorothy will be this coming Saturday, this uh 16th. Uh so please remember that in prayer again. Unfortunately, we won't be able to go because Sister Lydia's services this Saturday um this coming Saturday morning at 11:00 a.m. at Tucson Tabernacle. So, this Saturday, August 16th, at 11:00 a.m. at Tucson Tabernacle, uh Sister Jennifer, although we haven't gotten with her yet about the complete details, uh they have asked for use of the fellowship hall. Uh so, I I'm sure the intention of that is they're probably going to have fellowship and all afterwards. So, if you're able to come, able to stay, uh I'm sure they would appreciate that very much. So, um please uh uh please go if you can and obviously we will be there. So, please pray for the family too if you would. Uh the Lord would just bless and help them. That's the prayer request. Does anyone else have a prayer request on your part today? Remember, Micah is not with us obviously. Um sometimes he you know when he's here and playing he kind of hopefully drowns me out a little bit but uh we're back to the way we were he started &gt;&gt; uh acappella. &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh Lord bless it. He receives it anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I pray he receives it as worship to him as a sweet smelling savior. But remember him. Uh he sent us some pictures. He's doing good. Just pray the Lord bless his trip, give him traveling mercies, continue to keep him safe there. Amen. Anyone else then before we Yes. She'll be traveling back to Chino Valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Sister Katrina in prayer, sister Norma's granddaughter. Yes. I need to pray for Patty and wife. &gt;&gt; His widow. &gt;&gt; His widow. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; She had a problem starting Lindsay. She was growing up for two days. And we don't know if it's an after effect of what passing up, but she don't know either. It it just came on Sunday. She's doing a little better. I wanted to see her. I called her before I came to church. She's still not moving around real well. She lost her equilibrium. Her memory is not real good. affect her in a lot of different &gt;&gt; certain prayer. Amen. Appreciate your prayers for me this week. It was a rough week again. Hot humid. Um even when I took my clothes out of the suitcase yesterday for mom for some wash them were still wet. But anyway, uh that's in the past. It's done. But I I appreciate your prayers. Do not know where I'm going next week. haven't been assigned next week yet. I don't think it's going to be Houston again. It shouldn't be. Uh but anyway, uh not sure where we're going. So, we'll just have to let you know about that uh sometime this week whenever the arrangements come. But do appreciate your prayers for that. Anyone else then? Praise the Lord. Have an unspoken request to death stand if we could. Amen. Appreciate those you are able to be here today. Brother Dennis, would you take us to the Lord? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, it's a privilege to be in your house once again. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; You said when two or three are gathered in your name, you'll be in our midst. That's what makes every service father to know that your holy spirit holy presence will abide with us will strengthen us will encourage us will give us the ability as the prophet said we come to the house of God to hear the word of God to become better Christians to become better prepared for a rapture and I believe it's very very soon father &gt;&gt; and Lord you have put us in a race. It's like uh scripture says, he that's begun the race uh run that you may obtain the prize. And father, that prize is for everyone that'll endure to the end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Eternal life with you, Father. &gt;&gt; And Lord, help us to recognize the devil and all his tricks. Lord, to look unto thee, the author and finisher of our faith. Yes, God. to trust you in all that we do, knowing that our walk with you has begun with faith and grace. Our continual walk will be by faith and grace. &gt;&gt; And our ability to be in that rapture, if we're still here, will be by faith and grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and knowing that that which is not a faith is sin. &gt;&gt; And Lord, let us put you first in everything that we do. Just like this saying goes, if you're not if you're not Lord of all, you're not Lord at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Lord, we want to be better Christians. &gt;&gt; We want to live our life for others. &gt;&gt; Yes, God. &gt;&gt; There's a dying world that needs to receive a savior, Jesus Christ. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And may we be that written epistle read and known of all men. We'll be so salty they'll thirst for the Jesus Christ that's in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, there are several that are sick this morning. Father, they need a touch from you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know who they are. They've been read out and they been shared and I can't even remember. But, Father, you do. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're mindful of each and from the least to the greatest. They're all the same in your eyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Lord, we call you on the scene. Thank you, Lord, that you minister to their needs. For thou art and a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities. Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And with your stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Father, you are a great physician. We believe complete and total deliverance, a healing touch for them that need it at this time. And for my brother and sister Julie that need a job working from home, you know the right job. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're our Jehovah, the Lord that will provide. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, may you just come in this scene and bless them with the the right uh work at home job that they'll be able to take care of their financial needs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Father, bless each and everyone that had an unspoken prayer request. Lord, may ye their cup runth over. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Knowing that faith cometh by hearing, hearing the word of God. And Lord, we're reaching out. We're believing. We know as we heard from the sermon last week, Father, that we're in a fight. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You put us in the basis of free moral agency. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; God will test us. You will put us in a position. What decision are we going to make for you or for the devil? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we got to fight for every inch of ground that you have given us. It's Joshua was given the promise. Whatever foot you step on, that land belongs to you. But Joshua, I'm not just giving it to you. I'm not just put it right before you. You must fight. Fight the good fight of faith and believe. We're here to fight and believe the best for one another. Yes. For them that are backsliding. For them that are still in sin. For them that refuse to line up to the word. Lord, they're your children. Deal with our hearts. Deal with them. Father, bring them to the place of repentance and total submission to you. Father, &gt;&gt; bless. He's tired, but he's a faithful laborer of the gospel. use them to speak to our hearts through your word. Father, in your name we pray, name the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. We're going to go over to song number 360 in song book. I'm assuming the streaming is working. I hope it is. Anyway, nobody has said anything, but I got it turned on, so I hope it's working the way it's supposed to be working. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But, uh, I guess we'll see. Anyway, Psalm number 360. Greater is he that's in us than I in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it. We'll start with the chorus here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Well, Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro seeking whom he may divide. The Bible tells us so. Many souls have been his prey to fall and some we are that God has promised us today his over. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. than he that is in the world. And on the day of Pentecost came a rushing mighty wind. It blew into the upper room and baptized all of them with the power gater than any earthly f. Well, I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm going to let the whole world know that greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is. Let's sing that last verse again. On the day of Pentecost came a rushing mighty wind. It blew into the upper room and baptized all of them with the power greater than any earthly foe. Well, I'm so glad I've got it, too. I want to let the whole world know that greater is he that is in me. Gater is he that is in me. Gater is he that is in me that is in the world. Yes, greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm so glad he lives in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The world is overcome because of the God that is in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is overcoming power. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord. Anyone have a testimony or something on your heart today? Just want to open if anybody has something on your heart. Amen. Yeah, brother Dennis. &gt;&gt; Yes. Um, you know how the Lord just blesses me with his pennies. &gt;&gt; Hasn't done it very often the last couple of years. &gt;&gt; Um, when Leah was checking in July 10th for her surgery, there was a penny right in front of me and talking to the receptionist. &gt;&gt; So, I made a remarkable. Someone left you a tip. Here's a penny. She looked at me like, where did that come from? I said, "Thank you, Lord. I know my wife is going to be all right." Yes, I felt. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm gonna say this real quickly, brother. I didn't know Sister Dorothy sounds like a real godly sister, &gt;&gt; but when I was in New Mexico, I had a sister that lived in Walsenberg, Colorado, 100 miles from the church. &gt;&gt; And she would drive and she would be there early, earlier than anyone, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And she was poor as dirt. Had 16 very poor, but she paid her tithe. &gt;&gt; And that's I know you probably felt this way. That's one person I felt I shouldn't take. I knew she did it for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She was blessing. Sister Lily through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she she was alive, she'd be in herund 102 or something, but that reminds me when you said yes. &gt;&gt; Remind me of sister. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wonderful. Amen. That's beautiful. &gt;&gt; Very good. That's beautiful. That God has children everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just want to say I talked to sister's daughter and you know told her I'm sorry that service but we had prayed that sister would suffer. I know that. And she said that Dorothy had asked God to take her sleep and that's how she went. honored her heart to just go to sleepacefully. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we heard one minute she was in the next minute. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She really was. Praise the Lord. Amen. She will be missed. Anyone else? Praise the Lord. Let's stand to our feet. Then we're going to go to the service, go to the word and continue with our thought of adoption. This will be part 24. So we'll go to Romans chapter 8. Romans chapter 8. Going to begin reading there again. Amen. Romans 8:14. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 14. Before we read, could we just bow our heads for another word of prayer? Lord Jesus, very thankful, Father, again, of your blessings to us, Lord. So thankful for this word. Thank you for the revelation of this word. Thank you, Lord, for showing this word and Lord, planting it in our hearts, Lord. that God not only you are the word but we becoming the word Lord in this mortal flesh in our human beings God we know that more and more we need God especially as we see that day approaching Lord that we want need you more and more we need to be in church more and more need your word more and more God and Lord let that word Father have its preeminence in our hearts and lives show it to us reveal it to us again even today &gt;&gt; Lord as you would speak to us Father Lord, may you just take this word and &gt;&gt; Lord, let it find its uh bedding ground in the avenues of our hearts. Lord, may it not return void accomplish in us that that we need for it today. For we need it, God. We need it more than ever. Lord, may you just speak to us from it now, God. We'll thank you and praise you for all that you've done. Lord, all that you're doing now, continue to do for us. We commit the remaining part of this service, this word into your hands. Speak Lord through these lips the word you'd have us to hear. Father, anoint all of our ears to receive as God this will be accomplished as you sent it forth. We ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Romans 8 again verse 14. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ab father. The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and of children then hes of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. So again as we say this will be adoption part 24. Amen. And this uh subtitle will subtitle is uh abide in your calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Adoption part 24. Uh, abide in your calling. Praise the Lord. So, as we finished last Sunday, we want to go back over as we finished off kind of try to kickstart for today last Sunday. I want to read again in 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and uh read these verses of scripture over again if we could uh and start to draw a little bit uh more out of this. abiding in our calling. Again, uh as last Sunday, uh this will probably be a fairly short service, but uh as the Lord leads, Amen. Just want to be uh be his instrument, whatever he has for us to do. Amen. Whatever he wants to be said or done in this service. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want. Praise the Lord. So, we're going over to 1 Corinthians chapter 7. Amen. We'll begin with verse uh 17. Let's start with verse 17. Amen. 1 Corinthians 7:17. But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called everyone, so let him walk and so ordain or ordain I in all churches. Is any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God, that every man abide in the same calling, wherein he was called. Art thou called, being a servant, care not for it. But if thou mayest be made free, use it rather. For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's free man. Likewise also, he that is called being free is Christ's servant. &gt;&gt; Ye are bought with a price. Be not ye therefore uh be not ye the servants of men. Brethren, let every man wherein he is called therein abide with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abide with God. Now, as I read through this, I want to break this down a little bit as we look into this. Uh I uh before I do that, I got a I got a text from brother Roger uh Collins, which uh I haven't talked to him uh but just the one time last week when I was working, but um he had mentioned of course we knew and I had we had prayer for him, his family last week with his mother's passing. But I had also found out that he told me uh I knew she was close, but uh sister Wheeler, the older sister Wheeler, uh was uh very close to passing as well. And uh I learned that from brother Dan uh Evans, pastor of the tabernacle, when I was talking to him about having the service over there for Sister Lydia. And he had told me about that, but I didn't know she had passed. But uh brother Roger then text me and told me that sister Wheeler had passed away as well on the exact same day as his mother. &gt;&gt; So his mother and sister Wheeler, both wives of deacons at the two at the Brandom Tabernacle, passed away on the same day. &gt;&gt; And it Yeah, it it is to me it's a wow to realize that these things don't happen. I I these aren't coincidences to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh that that this would happen. And of course he mentioned that I think that's the biggest reason that he told me about that or mentioned that was that we me and brother Roger liking that word that we don't consider things like this happening when the Lord does things and when heaven is moving and things are happening uh when God is continuing to let things come to pass here as they have here on on earth and we've seen how many people even godly good people passing in the past uh couple of weeks or so &gt;&gt; right Uh it it just gets you it just gets you to the point to understand the Lord is doing something. We're we're this thing is winding down. We're getting to an ending of this. Uh, and I'm I'm not sure as we've said so many times and I know brother Dennis has had it in his prayer several times and has been mentioned and talked about several times of uh of how close that we are to a rapture, how close we are to an end in this world, to an end of this time and to a ushering in of the tribulation and the bride going in a rapture um to to make sure that we're ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But I I I've got I've gotten to the point that um uh I I I'm more into the uh the thought of the adoption uh than I am necessarily about where I know Brother Brandham said it many times and we've said it, I've said it uh to make sure you're ready or get yourself ready or something to that effect, but the truth of it is really you're a Christian or you're not. &gt;&gt; You're born again or you're not. Amen. &gt;&gt; You belong to God or you don't. You're part of the bride or you're not. You've been called or you haven't. &gt;&gt; Uh and all all the bride all the bride to me really is doing is just living their life in the calling God's called them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They're they're just uh it it's not a matter of scrambling to do something different. It's not a matter of calling all night prayer meetings. all. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not a matter of of scrambling things around to try to uh do this and do that and let's have church more and let's do this more. So, you just live your life. Brother Bam said, "If I knew he was coming today, I' tomorrow I'd plant my potatoes today." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I would I just want to be found faithful at my post. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's all life is. That's all the end of this is going to be. That's all the rapture is going to be about. We're going to be about the father's business and God's going to call us home. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It might be in church. It might not. You might be on your job. You might be in your living room. You might be having dinner. God's going to call us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe anytime we'll see our loved ones appear before us. But it's just a matter of it's just a matter of of of of living your life. Be godly. Be a Christian. be be what God's called you to be. Do what God's called you to do. Amen. And when it time is for us to go, he'll call us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we'll go. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So it's it it's although we try to make it sound like it's you know uh you know this thing to try to get a little extra juice or something. Just just be the Christian that you are. &gt;&gt; Just be the person God made you. Just be just be found faithful at your post. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do what God's called you to do. Be who God's made you. That's that's the best thing you can do. Amen. And then when you get on the other side, he'll say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant. Enter in enter ye into the joys of the Lord. Be found faithful at the post." Praise the Lord. So part of that so that that all to me uh having said all that boils right down to what we've been talking about and this subject that we've been uh delving into for several actually two or three months now uh on adoption. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And making sure that our calling and election is sure. Making sure that we're in our position. We're in our place. We're dwelling in our calling. We're not interested in trying to be someone else. We're not interested in trying to enter into someone else's calling or someone else's uh position. We're we're just trying to be faithful at what God's called us to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Even if it as as uh Paul said here, even if it's just being a servant or whatever the capacity that is. I'm sure he didn't mean God servant just being someone who is a servant here on earth, which really truthfully as a Christian, we're all servants. &gt;&gt; We all serve one another every day. We should. Amen. in our prayer life and in our uh life of concern and calls and texts and church and things that we do with one another, we all do for each other as servants to one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh as we serve the Lord because as we serve one another, we serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's all a part of what God has called us to do &gt;&gt; in our lives. But let's go back to this and and look uh because this this really is the foreground of what we just said. All that we said just sums up here in this in this reading again. So let's let's go back to the the 17th verse again. But as God had distributed. So God has distributed to every man, every person, every being, each person. It should say God has distributed to each person as the Lord has called each person. Amen. God has called each person. And a calling is nothing more than a bid, an invitation, uh something that God, if God has bidden you, as God has invited you to come, that is a calling. That is what or that is what it means to be called. Amen. That's not the calling itself. That is to be called is to actually receive an invitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The calling doesn't come. Remember when we talked about the children of Israel? We know the children of Israel were called because they were God's people. But we also realize as they were called, they uh they responded to that invitation, but their calling wasn't made clear until afterwards. Amen. Kind of follows the same line of of receiving the Holy Spirit. You you receive the Holy Spirit after you have you received since you believe after you believe. The calling, the invitation goes out. Amen. And we know that many are called, but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the invitation goes out to many, but the but the the choosing is God's choosing. &gt;&gt; Amen. The picking out. &gt;&gt; People will respond to an invitation, but God's the one that picks out. God's the one that chooses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So it's it's God that's the one that that does this work. So as we are called to everyone to each one as the Lord has called each one. Amen. So let him walk. Amen. Walk. That that that gives an indication of an action. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It gives a an invoca an indication of life. Amen. of living, of occupying, of being busy, of being about the father's business. To walk means that you are actually doing something. Amen. You're you're putting you're putting feet to the to the faith. You're putting steps to your testimony. You're doing something about it. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when God calls you as as his call is, you receive that invitation. He says, "So let him walk. So let him abide in that. So let him live in that. So let him be occupied in that position, in that place. Let it be your life. Don't let it just be a maybe a one-time thing or something, but live in that. Live in what God's called you to do. Be the one that God has called you to be." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's a life. Amen. It's a life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let every man, let every po person, let each one as it says, amen, live in that call. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so ordain I in all churches. Is any man called being circumcised? &gt;&gt; Let him not become uncircumcised. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. And now we kind of touched on that a little bit last week, but to me, this basically means that if God's called you to do something, do it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what somebody else has said. It doesn't matter what somebody else has tried to talk you into. It doesn't matter what somebody else has done. Oh, you're uncircumcised. Well, how could you be, you know, that that's horrible? Or you're you're circumcised. Why would you be circumcised? Well, Paul's just saying neither one matters. Just do what God told you to do. Be the person God has called you to be because that's all that really matters in the end. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. There there's not a grading system that we have of one another. God is the one that judges us. &gt;&gt; God is the one that determines that. Not not one another. Amen. I know that that the Bible says to judge one another, but not in the capacity of realizing that we've been in God's will. I don't want to be to the point, let me say it this way, to the point that I have no desire to be in your will. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I don't I I have no desire to be what you want me to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My only desire is to be what God wants me to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. I only want to do what God has called me to do. &gt;&gt; And if God's called me to do it, then God will bless it. If I walk in it, God will bless it. Amen. Regardless of whether we got uh a church full or whether we've got a half a dozen, doesn't matter. That's what God whatever God's calling is. Amen. He said uh in that little parable, if you're you're you're faithful to the little things, then he'll bless you in the bigger things. But that doesn't even really matter &gt;&gt; because I just want to do what he wants me to do. Whatever that is, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that's what that calling, that's what that position that God is calling wants us to do is to be in the place that he wants us to be. Circumcision, fine. Unircumcision, fine. Amen. I I have no thing with that. I know years ago um even brother Green I heard to a point it was before I really even knew brother Green knew of him but uh to know him that there was that time back in the what maybe 80s late 80s 90s something like that where uh there was a big push through the message that if you if you wanted to be a minister in this message you couldn't have facial hair. Amen. Did you remember that brother Dennis? Did that come brother? I I heard now I didn't hear him. I didn't hear him personally, but I heard brother Green used to propagate that. Amen. Good or bad. I mean, I know I I know people today that are still the same way. I know a brother I know a brother pastor church. He won't let a man come if he's got facial hair. He won't let him come preach. Amen. No matter who he is. And And it And it swept through. And I I I understand their point of view, but who am who am I to I I I can't find anywhere that says that if you do, you can't preach. I've never found it. Amen. U I I I haven't found a quote. Brother Random talked about it. Brother Ram talked about clean shaping. But uh to me, Dennis and Danny are both clean shaped. They're not they're because they're trimmed and look nice and not all scraggly and whatever. But then brother Brandham turns around and talks about being scraggly himself or John the Baptist coming out all scraggly and I mean you know uh you being what God told you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that's all that matters to me. I've had brothers come and preach for me beard down to here cuz I it to me when I even I've heard and people talk about that and brothers and all I have fellowship with them and I love them but you know um and I've always been this way but mainly because my wife hates facial hair so not on me. Let's put it that way. So be careful these hate Dennis and Danny but uh on me. Uh, so I don't I don't usually I have never grown anything more than a couple weeks because I know she doesn't like it and I I I don't care to have it or not have it. So I like I defer to her. If she doesn't like it, then it gets shaped. But I don't do it for any other reason. So when I was uh uh going around the ranks and people was talking about this and this was like a big deal, I I to me in my spirit, I never I never I never understood there never was something that was uh a thing that I felt like, well, brother, if you're going to preach here, you better shave that face. I I don't I I just was I never saw that. I never could believe that. I thought, if you want to have a beard, I have a beard. I don't care. Amen. You're welcome to come on. you preaching this gospel, you can come preach. &gt;&gt; That's all that mattered to me. But you see what people get. You mean I even remember u uh I'm not going to call names, but uh a visiting minister went to another church and the the the son of the pastor was talking about becoming a minister and getting into the ministry. And that and that brother, that visiting minister told him said, "Well, if you're going to preach, you better shave that face. Okay, being circumcised, who cares? Uncircumcised, who cares? I mean, you know, it just boils down to a lot of times people's feelings and beliefs and thoughts and uh as long as you're preaching the gospel and God's called you and ordained you and you're ministering that truth of that gospel, that that's all I care about. That's all that ma to me. I can see that that's that's all that matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I believe brother Green changed that obviously later in his life. That was that was 30 plus years ago. So a lot of ch things change since then. And I just use that as analogy for for people that say, "Well, you know, if you're uncircumcised, you're not coming here. If you're circumcised, you're not coming here." Paul's saying, "Who cares? Just do what God told you to do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be the person God's called you to be. That's all that matters. Amen. Because you get down to the next verse, he says, "Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing to me." Again, can we go back to my analogy? The facial hair is nothing. The no facial hair is nothing to me. Doesn't matter. Amen. It is nothing. But the keeping of the commandments of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That matters. keeping the commandments of the Lord. That matters. Making sure that you're living by the word, living by his spirit, living by the dictates that God has put in your life. And that's what matters. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is being and doing what God has called you to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Being. Amen. Let every man now let everyone each one as the as the scripture says here let every man abide praise the Lord abide in the same calling wherewith he was called that abide means to remain &gt;&gt; to remain in that calling. Amen. Sometimes it's not always in the same place. Uh you know I I've pastored in Florida. I've pastored in Tucson. I've pastored in Xolo. I've been associate pastor in North Carolina. I've been associate pastor brother Green. I'm uh there's things that the Lord has uh done in life. It doesn't mean that uh which when I was young, I used to think, you know, I I would go grow up, I get a job, and I'll have that job the rest of my life. I'll go and have a church and I'll have that church the rest of my life. I'll have this this just this just this just this just this just this just this just this just this just this just this just this will be all that it is all that it is and it's been it's there hasn't been anything further from the truth. I haven't had a ton of jobs, but uh the one job I thought I was going to be at till I retired uh I was there 10 years, which I guess is a long time by today's standards, but I was there 10 years. And but when God called me to leave, Amen. And I had a lot of people fuss at me because it was in the beauty and barber supply industry. Amen. I was a purchaser of beauty and barber supply products. Amen. that supplied beauty and barber supply uh beauty and barber shops around the that area, that region. And I had people criticize me for it and and say, "You shouldn't do that. You you shouldn't be working for a company like that." I said, "How do you know what the company you're working for stands for?" Right? &gt;&gt; Do you really know? I even had a brother come and criticize me. I said, "What do you do?" He said, "He delivers uh he drives a delivery truck where he delivers chips and stuff." I said, "Oh, okay. Well, what kind? He said, "Well, they have these kind of chips and these kind of chips." I said, "Do you realize that that these chips are owned by Annheiser Bush? You're distributing chips for a for a beer company for an alcohol? You're working for an alcohol? How dare you? You should not do that. You should quit immediately." And it was a decent paying job. He wasn't about to quit. And I told him, I said, "Don't don't criticize me till you know." &gt;&gt; Amen. And you don't know. God gave me this job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God sent me from Tucson to Charlotte with this job and God gave me this job. &gt;&gt; That I should I should not had that job. That's just the absolute truth. There's no reason for me to have had that job. Amen. I used to work there in the warehouse. I was a warehouse picker. I picked stuff and for to ship. Amen. I moved to Tucson. go back a year later and all of a sudden I'm next in line for the purchaser who's the he's about to retire. There was no reason for me to have that job. I had no qualifications. I had no schooling. I'd never been to college. I walked into Puma Community College one time and walked out. That's as close as I've come to getting a college education. I had no qualific. And he hired me, paid me a lot of money. hire me for this position. I should not have had that job. I told people God gave me this job. &gt;&gt; When God tells me to leave, I will leave. &gt;&gt; And when God told me to move to Florida and start that church, you know what I did? I left. &gt;&gt; It's that easy. &gt;&gt; God says do it, I do it. When God says don't, I don't. When God says go, I go. When God says come, I come. I do what he's whatever he leads me to do. And he gave me that job and he blessed me in that job until he told me it was time to leave. &gt;&gt; And when it was time to leave, I left. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I gave the man, the president of the company, uh, that hired me about resignation, he accepted it. Amen. I came and I told the entire uh, uh, uh, sales staff. We had like a hundred hundred salespeople from Richmond, Virginia down into southern Georgia. We had I forgot how many and but this was the regional and I went in and I told them that I was retired, that I was uh quitting, that I was resigning, that I was starting a church in Florida and all this. And those people when I when I finished talking for just a couple of minutes, I started walk out the door, they gave me a standing ovation. &gt;&gt; Amen. The entire sales staff gave me a standing ovation. I walked out and I walked out. I said, "Lord, they're not standing for me. They're standing for you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's that's all that any of us are. &gt;&gt; We deserve no human accolades. It's what God does for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Any if there's anything good, it's attributed to him. &gt;&gt; Anything that's blessing is attributed to him. It's all him, not us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's absolute truth. Amen. And I got down to Florida and the believe the message believer smacked me in the head and says, "What in the world are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. You should blah blah blah do this and do that and if you come here and do this." I actually had a pastor that told me, he said, "All right, well, if you if you do this and we'll preach you and stuff like this," I said, "God did that's not what God called told me to do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God didn't tell me to come and go to your church and and for you to preach me. This is what God told me to do. this is what I'm going to do. And by God's grace, that's what I did. It wasn't easy. Amen. But God blessed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God never put you in the easiest place, but he put you in a place that he's called for you and he's going to bless you there. That's what matters is being blessed in where God bless blesses you and abide there. But see, notice the calling never changed. Even though the place changed, even though the situations changed, the calling never changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Never changed. God called me to be a ministry. He called me to be a pastor. And that's never changed. And I've done my best by God's grace to abide in that call, &gt;&gt; to live in that call, to remain in that call, to not depart from that call. Whether it's capacity of a a pastor or associate pastor, whatever it is, I've tried my best. Said what God's told me to do, that's what you do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Abide there. Live there. Amen. Don't Well, you know, that was good for a while, but I think I'll do this now. Well, that was that was okay, but I think I'll go over and dabble in this. And, you know, I I think I'll uh you know, whatever it is. and and and you know try to be something you're not. &gt;&gt; It doesn't bless you no matter how hard you try to be something you're not. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If you belong to God, God is going to make the circumstances work in your life to put you in the place where you're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and after all the thing that happened uh and when brother Green passed away and all uh I come to realization uh what what God was doing where where God wants you to be and and that's the only thing that matters. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God told me to start the church, I didn't ask him how many people are coming. I didn't care. wasn't my concern. If God calls you, you do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the rest, whatever God has to come, that's fine. He does that part. That's not up to me. That's God's job. But all I know to do is to try to abide in that call. Live in that call. Be that one that God has called me to be. Amen. To abide. And that's what the abide means to stay there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Remain there. Be steadfast in that calling. Amen. Don't waver in it. Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. Art thou 21st verse now. Art thou being called? Art thou called being a servant, care not for it. But if thou mayest be uh be made free, use it rather because God will bless you in it. For uh for he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's free man. Likewise also, he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant. Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the servants of men, because we belong to God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brethren, let every man wherein he is called uh therein abide with co wi with God. That call that calling. Now the calling is actually something different from the call. Being called is just an invitation. But your calling is your vocation. It is what God the position the placement the adoption where God wants you to be. What part of the body are you going to play? You're invited to become a part of the body. Yes, that's a call. Amen. But your calling is what part, what position, what placement are you going to do? What part of the body are you going to be? &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's sad today. It seems like that and and cons can sort of understand why uh and I've heard many ministers talk about how disarray the bride is. I've never agreed with that. um uh to the point that brother Brandon would talk about, but you know, for people to say that the the bride was in such disarray, I said the message people may be in disarray, but God's bride is not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh there's a difference in God's bride and the people that are in this message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Just because you're in this message doesn't mean that you're bride. &gt;&gt; And just because you're not in this message doesn't mean you're bride or not bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh if you're in this message, uh yeah, there there there there can be a mess. It can look like a mess. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times you look and say, well, you can kind of understand, I mean, how is how is the leoty ever going to get in its position unless the leadership's in its position? Right. &gt;&gt; The leadership's got to be in its position first before the leoty can ever get in their position because they're the ones in the leadership position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think how and they talk about how that uh people should be in their uh their position and and make sure you come to church and pay your ti and all that. And that's all true and right and good. But how is h how do you bring that across in a place where you're not even where where the where the leadership's not even in its position? &gt;&gt; If the leadership's not properly positioned, how are the people going to be the people in this message are going to be in the position God's called them to be in? &gt;&gt; Because that's God's calling, not man's calling. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. man's calling would say you you you come here and you do this. But God's calling is is different. And and when we do what God calls us to do, then we're we're where we're supposed to be regardless of what any man or anybody or any woman or whatever says. Uh we want to be in that position. Amen. So, how is it that uh a a church can be in its position the way it should be if the the person in leadership is not? Amen. It's got to be it. It has to be wholly in its position for it to work right &gt;&gt; for them to all to abide in the calling God's called them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a lot of times where politics comes in. People get so much into politics and things that uh uh it it throws everything out of cater. Let me read this to you influence. Brother Vam says, "I was reading the history of Martin Luther's history said it wasn't so much of a mystery that Martin Luther could protest the Catholic Church and get by with it, but that but to hold his head above all the fanaticism that followed his message, his revival." That's right. Hold yourself, listen, hold yourself clean and clear to your calling. Remember calling, calling is vocation. Hold yourself clean and clear. Amen. Stay with God's word and don't move for nothing. Abide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And stay abide in your calling. If he'd give you a job out there as a farmer, farm good. &gt;&gt; God bless you at it. And pay your tithes and whatever it is, your offerings to help the ministry go on. If he made a mechanic out of you and blessed you in that work, stay with it &gt;&gt; and thank him for it. See, you just abide where God calls you. Now, see, I mentioned that this is the kind of thing that helps me a so much because I I I mentioned about that job I had in North Carolina and was purchasing manager. I think the job that I'm in right now is the same way. And I I had I there was no reasoning why I should be in this position. There's no reason why I had this job. There's no logical explanation as to why an old man like me would be doing a young man's job in this position and uh and and doing this and working. There's just no reason. There's I I I have had so little uh labor experience that it it would defy logic to hire me in a position like that. I worked a couple years with brother Roger helped helped a lot. I mean, I learned things that he showed me. Not near what I do now, but I learned some things when he showed me. But there's no reason to be in this position. Amen. But I know one thing for a fact. God gave me this job. &gt;&gt; God put Julie in the right place at the right time. Put Tom, who's my upper upper boss, in the right place the right time and brought all this together. Why? I don't know. That's God God did it. That's all I know. I God gave me this job. So when I look at this and I know what God has done, I look and I say, "God bless you at it." See, he said, "Pay your tithes, whatever it is, offerings, ministry." He said, "If he's made you a ca a mechanic out of you and bless you at that work, stay right with it and thank him for it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I try, although it gets very difficult sometimes, not to complain about the heat and humidity and things like that. Uh the elements, it gets rough sometimes. But I know that God's called me to that job. I know he has. So when when I look at this and I say and and he says, "God bless you in that work. Stay with it. &gt;&gt; Thank him for it." So thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You just abide where God's called you. Praise the Lord Jesus. I'm thankful for that. For that's because that's what God It's It makes no sense. I even I've even talked to other guys on other teams and on our team and they give their story of how they came to work at Mr. and how they came to do this job and my Tom grilled them and made them turn in applications and and resumes and had to find out what they did and what their background was and all this stuff. They they had to meet all these qualifications to for him to even consider them. You know what he asked me? He said, "When can you start?" We're even walking through the tunnel there. We went in Sire. We're going to the tunnel. He said, "Yeah, we weld all this together." I said, "I've never welded in my life. Don't know anything about." He said, "Don't worry about it. We'll teach you." I even told him, "I haven't done this. I don't know how to do that. I've never done that. I didn't know you could do that." They've got tools to do that. I have no idea. don't matter. When can you start? &gt;&gt; And all these other guys, I said, they tell me what they had to go through. He didn't even ask for a resume. He didn't ask for an application. He didn't ask for none of that. &gt;&gt; He basically just said, "We do this, this, this, this, and this. He wants the job. This is what it pays." I'm like, "What?" &gt;&gt; No logical reason, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when when God does it, a lot of times it defies logic. But when you but that's when you you know it's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know it's God. God's doing it. You could try to try to press yourself into something and push yourself into something and force something to happen, but when God's doing it, it's just there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God just brings everything together and makes it work. It just dubtales and it's just beautiful, perfect. It works the way it's supposed to. That's God. That's when God does it. Amen. Stay with it. He said, "Stay with it. Thank him for it. Just abide where God's called you." Praise the Lord. Spirit of truth. Now, 1963, he said, "I would rather uh he says when?" Let's see. He said, "I would rather I would rather go and have a church with 50 people in it in the will of God than to go have 5,000 out of the will of God." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Me, too. I'd rather have 50 in the will of God than 5,000 out of the will of God. Sure. God can do more with a man in his will in one hour than he could do with a man out of his will in 50 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He could do more with a man &gt;&gt; in one hour in the will of God than he can do with a man out of the will of God in 50 years. &gt;&gt; That's pretty powerful things. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, he is stumbling and staggering, shoots like he says in the dark. But when a man is really in the will of God and knows his calling, he abides there. He should abide there, stay there, live there, be there. Like I said, God's called some apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors. He's called some that speak in tongues, that prophesy, that have gifts of government, helps, healings. Uh he he has farmers, he has housewives, he has builders, he has mechanics, he has office people, he has people that work with their hands, people that work with their minds. He has he has people that are wealthy and people that live from paycheck to paycheck, but they're never forsaken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their seed never begging bread because God always provides. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It may be laboring out in the hot sun. It may be in a beautiful airond conditioned office building, but don't despise where God's put you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't despise where God's placed you. Amen. Let God show you. When a man is really in the will of God and knows his calling, stay there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Abide there. Now, is it going to be forever? No. Not Not likely. I mean, I I don't personally think I as far as my job, I don't think I could personally do this job for a whole lot longer. Uh it's very physically taxing, but uh but whatever God gives strength, I said, Lord, whatever you give strength to do, that's what that that that's what we do. &gt;&gt; Amen. You give grace, you give strength, and you show and uh when God makes it work, then it works. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Don't ever We should never try to expect more out of other people than we're willing to give ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Always seem to want others to do other things and not not carry our load. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you expect others to do it, you should be willing to do it as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go over to Ephesians now. I'm gonna close here in just a minute. Ephesians chapter 4. Praise the Lord. Ephesians chapter 4, let's begin reading verse one. Ephesians 4:1. I therefore the prison of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called. Work worth walk worthy. So it's not just the walk, just the living, just the being occupying. It's the walk worthy, amen, of the vocation wherewith God has called you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faithful to the post with all loneliness and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. That sounds like a lot of work. Amen. Did you hear these words? Loneliness, meekness, longsuffering. That even has suffer in it. The root of the word of this is suffer. Longsuffering. Forbearing one another in love. Endeavoring. And that sounds like a lot of work. It is to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of work but we keep it there. Uh there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling. Called in one hope of your calling. Now listen to this. I'm going close uh influence again. And he said, "And we find we find that uh we find that as long as this king felt that way, God blessed him." Now, I think he's gone back to Uzziah again. Uh this quote, I'm trying to remember. I believe he's talking about Uzziah again. When he felt that way, God blessed him. The scripture says, "As long as Usiah sought the Lord, God made him to prosper." &gt;&gt; God blessed him. But when he got to a place that he wanted to not abide in his own calling, he wanted to take the calling of something else. And he thought because that God had blessed him that it was all right that he could do that. But just because God has blessed you one place, which as we have found out, if God is blessing you in that place is your calling, abide there. Why do you want to go do something else? &gt;&gt; If you get the thought, well, God blesses me here, he'll bless me over here, too. No, not necessarily. Amen. Even if you're a child of God, God doesn't necessarily going to bless you over here when you're not supposed to be in that position. He'll bless you where you're supposed to be, but that doesn't mean he's going to bless you in a place that you try to take over that you're not supposed to be. &gt;&gt; And that's what Uzziah did. He was the king and God blessed him and he restored the kingdom back and God blessed Uzziah continually. But when he decided that he wanted to take the office of a priest, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God didn't bless that. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But he thought, I'm the king. God blesses me. I can go do this because God's blessings are with me. Not when you're doing something you're not called to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He he doesn't he didn't bless him in the position that he was not called to be in. That's the priest's office, not his. He was called to be the king and God blessed him as king. He blessed the priest as priest. But if the priest tried to be king, he wasn't blessed. Josiah tried to take the place of priest, he wasn't blessed. You see what happened to him too? He said, "Now look," he wanted to take call him something else. He thought because that God had blessed him that that was all right. He could do that. But how sadly we we he said, Brother Bram said, we make them mistakes. Oh, how bad. You absolutely be honest. You mustn't do nothing unless God has directed you to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. and proves it and vindicates it and you know that it is God that's done it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all him. You know he's done it. Usually man usually man of God God has uh God has to run him down and catch the real man of God. It ain't those guys that wants a whole lot of something to do a whole lot uh with. uh you'd hardly tell what they uh would do with if they received it. Amen. In other words, uh the the true called man, God has to make him do it. God has to basically force him into that into that position into doing that. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, usually if a man's want to do it and he's shoving himself in that position, he's putting himself in that place, he's probably not called to do it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God when God calls, he calls him and as brother Brandham said here, he basically has to force him to do it. &gt;&gt; Make all circumstances work to where it comes to that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know how much easier it be just to set back just I mean it's not this easy but uh to not preach, to not minister. Amen. I I I've set congregations and I I've I've been ley I've been uh associate pastor and uh I've sat and listened a lot and I've ministered a lot and uh you know in preparing and getting ready and making sure you know that the Lord's going to meet you there and uh what is said uh is thus sayeth the Lord out of out of the scripture out of the Uh there's a lot of responsibility. Amen. There's a lot to it. Brother Dennis has done both done both as well. He knows. Amen. It's quite different. &gt;&gt; But God blesses where he wants you to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where God brings you to. Praise God. And and that's when God when God does it, then you know that it's right. It's he brother. He says here, usually has to run a man down and catch the real man of God. It ain't those guys that wants a whole lot of something to do a whole lot with you. You uh uh you'd hard to tell what they would do with it if they got a hold of it anyway. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times I've come to find out that's true. Amen. But God usually has to catch his man like Moses and Paul run him down. Amen. uh to run him down to set uh to get glory out of his life, let him become a prisoner of the Holy Spirit. Amen. And scripturally, we see how that's true. Amen. How that God brings you into that position. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're a child of God, a lot of people just do whatever they want and however and uh and things. But when God when God brings you along and places and makes the circumstances and organizes everything to put you in a position to put you in a place I mean going back to this job I have now I think even when sister Julie first told me I went over to help with your battery I think or a truck or something and she said u you know u this this man's going to call you from mister about a job and I'm like no I don't I don't I don't I'm fine with brother Roger. I don't want another job. I don't I'm not looking to get anything else. And she says, "Oh, well, I've already told him now." She already told him about you. I said, "Well, okay. If he calls, I'll listen to him." I wasn't expecting anything out of it. I wasn't expecting anything to come of it. Uh but when God makes everything work and bring the circumstances to a place and it's there in front of you and you feel led of the Lord, you do what God tells you to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you you bring it to that place. If you if you try to force yourself and make yourself now as a Christian, Amen. Not talking about nominal. We're not talking about the world. They do however, whatever, whenever they they're they have their boss. And he's not the same as my boss. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um but when God leads a Christian, when God leads his people around, he brings it into the place where he where he can get the most out of you. What you're ordained to do, what God's called you to do. As we've said many times, God God has placed all of us in positions with different family and different uh people in our lives and different friends and different areas of the country and different nationalities and speaking different languages and everything that God has made in our lives and brought us up has has brought us to a place that God can use us where he wants us to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the fulfilling that God now we just need to abide there. Amen. Remain there. stay there. Amen. No, don't mean it's always going to be in this building or in in in in this church, whatever God calls. That's uh that's where we want to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where we want to go. And just abide in that place, in that call &gt;&gt; as God has called you. Amen. Let's stand if we could. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That place that God has put us and called us and ordained us. Amen. That's that's where we want to be. I believe all of us as Christians would realize that that's where God blesses us the most. &gt;&gt; That we realize that's where our lives are enhanced is when we're in that place where God wants us to be, &gt;&gt; where God has called us. There's nothing else like it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Let's sing this course 3:16. We know it by heart. Amen. Before we go today, Praise the Lord. 3:16. Sanctuary. Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary. I just want to be what he wants me to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, pure and holy, [Music] tried and true, [Music] with thanksgiving, [Music] I'll be a living sanctuary for you. Yes, Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, pure and holy. tried and true with thanksgiving I'll be a living [Music] sanctuary for you. [Music] Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, let that be our testimony today. &gt;&gt; Let that be our portion. Let that be our life. Let that be our call. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. As God has called each one of us to be in that calling, to be in that position, to be in that place. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you today. Pray something was said to bless and strengthen you all today. Amen. And just remember the prayer requests that we've had the memorial services coming up this Saturday for Sister Dorothy and Sister Lydia. Again, 11 o'clock Saturday morning at 11 o'clock at Tucson Tabernacle, Sister Lydia's memorial service. Amen. We'll have there. So, please remember that in prayer as well. Amen. And again, I'll I'll just have to get in contact with with each one this week to find out to see where I end up going next week. One of the uh one of the uh minor drawbacks to this not knowing. I don't I don't like the not knowing part, but uh I guess it just comes with it. So, but uh Lord knows. So, we'll just do all that we can with what the Lord gives us. continue to pray with that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, amen. So, just remember these prayer requests and uh remember the families of those who passed and of course, Brother Roger, I know, has gone back east. I'm sure he's gone back east. I hadn't talked to him, like I said, but I'm sure he's back east uh with the arrangements. They were supposed to, I believe, and turn his mother in Jeffersonville. She lived in Georgia, so um they have to transfer for her body back to Jeffersonville. So, I'm sure they're back there now. And of course, Sister Dorothy's family and Sister Lydia's family and u Sister Wheeler's family and so many uh it seems like been passing lately. So, but Amen. But we're all in his hands. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And trust him, his perfect will &gt;&gt; in all of our lives. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you today. Amen. Appreciate each one coming. Anyone have anything before we're dismissed? Amen. So, God bless you. Bless you. Amen. Love you. Appreciate you today. Let's just bow our heads. We're dismissed in a word of prayer now. Lord Jesus, very thankful, Father, of your grace and mercy to us. Thank you, Lord, for speaking to us, being with us, Lord. Thank you, Father, for the service you give us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the word and for your life. Thank you for being with us, Lord, and helping us through this time, God, and letting us see, Lord, that you you've called us, Lord. If it's your calling, it's your placement, it's what you have for us, Lord. It's what we want to do. We only want to do what you would have us to do, Lord. We only want to be what you would have us to be. &gt;&gt; So, may you grant that to each of us, Lord, for we need it now more than ever, &gt;&gt; Lord, in this world that we're living in. is we're getting ready to move on, Lord, from this mortal reach. We're getting ready to press forward, Lord, out of this place, God, looking for our loved ones to appear at any time, God, as we're ready, Lord. We just will we, as brother Brandham said, we'll just keep planting our potatoes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We'll just keep living our lives and being who you have us to be. &gt;&gt; And Lord, may we be everyone found faithful at the post of duty, God, when you call us. &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord, bless us now. Keep us safe. Keep us healthy and strong in your service. Lord, move upon every request and need. Help those that are needed today and grant traveling mercies, Lord, as we commit them to you. Give us grant us traveling mercies on our way home today and watch over us. We commit ourselves to you and ask your blessings and all that as we go. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you today.
