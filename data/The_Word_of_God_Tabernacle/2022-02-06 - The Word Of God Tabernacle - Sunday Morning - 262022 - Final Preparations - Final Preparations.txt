need to touch from the lord god to comfort her and be with her thank you buddy so listen continue to remember sister teresa sotelo family in prayer of course lord we just continue to be with them also art's not with us today has a problem with his back his shoulder in his back so let's just remember our prayer he's a hard worker amen body can only take so much sometimes and until it slows down or stops and says wait we're done here we've got to stop for a little bit so our it's home resting his shoulder is back today so please remember him in prayer uh as you all know brother dennis and brother danny both tested positive for coping [Music] i don't think a whole lot about it but they tested positive for it but they're both doing fine they're doing well brother danny had very little symptoms neither one of them according to brother dennis even had a fever brother danny's uh really just had a little bit of congestion he's doing doing fine their quarantine time is supposed to be over tomorrow so they stay home again watching hopefully they're streaming god bless you brothers hope you are streaming um and brother dennis i think brother dennis got it a little more than brother danny maybe he had a little more symptoms the doctor said he had the beginning stages of pneumonia but he's taking some um i forgot what it was uh that the doctor prescribed to him but it's one of those medicines they talk about all the time uh with the covet uh it's not uh it's not hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin it's something else i forgot the name of it but anyway uh but he's doing fine they're both doing well thank god for their healing and for touching them and blessing them but that's they're uh probably might still would have been here but uh the the coveted restriction thing they decided to stay home today and they have my full support in that so appreciate them um uh and just that's why they're not with us today brother angel sent me a rather lengthy text um that uh their family is going through some issues you know her sister priscilla is home she's having some problems the with the medicine she has to wake up every couple hours to take the medicine she's on which of course you all know all about joel the medicine she's on but she's only supposed to be on the medicine for another uh couple of days three more days so hopefully that'll be over but she's having anxiety eating uh even to the point that she becomes nervous shaking eating i guess because of the situation that she just went through uh went through also he said she's been having some bad pain on her lower right side and they're supposed to go tomorrow to the surgeon to find out what uh what that might be and give her a checkup uh also brother angel confessed he's battling some anger issues he says he's not lashing out at anybody but he just feels uh anger just the world and the things the way they are the sin of the world and um the sin that's everywhere that's just really i guess getting the best of him i guess i could confess sometimes it does me too i don't get angry i get happy because i'm thankful because the worse the world gets the closer we get home that's the way i have to look at it uh you know when we talked about and i've confessed this to some of my family but you know we i may have said it here i can't remember anyway i never realized that when we talked about lord i want to be a part of that rapture group that alive and remain lord i want to be one of the ones who see the body change the resurrection of the dead and go in a rapture without tasting death didn't realize that that was going to cause us to be here at the most cruel wicked time that the earth has ever experienced so you get both amen if we want to be here at that period of time we got to understand that the world is going to be in the worst condition that it's ever going to be in outside of the tribulation after the bride leaves of course it goes into apostasy after that but uh so we got to take both sides of it so when i see this and i feel that i think god that just means we're that much closer home amen i try to look at things and even in the physical world and the political world and i think how horrible things are going and how bad the country is getting and i think lord that's just one more step closer to you yes i mean that other than that it just drive you crazy it just drive you mad if you looked at everything that's going on and you put weight on all those things and looked at it that way it would just drive me crazy but i look at it i say god thank you because i to me i just believe that gets us one more step closer to him amen one more step closer to home but please pray for brother angel sister priscilla kids um brother um the angel said that the satan's really attacking the children too so uh we'll just remember them in prayer the lord would just keep his hand upon them and touch and be with them i don't see the paths here today um i haven't gotten an update that my wife said a couple of a couple of days ago sister pap had a fever again sister pat's been on and off with that fever and not feeling well brother pat sent me a text thursday with a testimony which i'll give to you later i was going to have him give it but since he's not here a testimony and sister pat was doing okay and then friday she was back not feeling good again and yesterday so i'm assuming they're home uh as a result of that so uh if you are streaming god bless you uh paz we love you so please remember her and prayer too if you would the lord would just uh just touch her sister matisse as well amen man just like sister sheila just it just takes time it just takes time to heal the body heals so please remember them in prayer if you would also got a couple prayer requests here please pray for uh robert via my brother-in-law he is in the hospital waiting for surgery complications from previous medical issues i remember when he was coming with us

him amen you notice we just changed a couple of words on that you know i i don't believe we're living i don't believe that we're living a life of misery saints no amen we're living a godly blessed life amen so i just kind of tweaked that from weary days to blessed days because every day we have with the lord jesus is a blessed day hallelujah it's not a weary day sure we go through our troubles we have trials and things that we live through go through god blesses us in those but it's a blessed day amen praise the lord every day with him is a blessed day praise the lord jesus amen i love him don't you amen praise the lord well since brother pat came in i'm going to let him give his testimony i was going to give you a testimony for you brother pat but since you're here we'll go ahead and let you do it on your own how's that amen i it's such an outstanding testament you know i like to try to have the testimonies written down but this is such an outstanding testimony i wanted where we had to give it i don't know where to start but we uh week before the cold weather set in we ran low on propane so i called up the propane company and asked him delivered me some more propane and they gave me a time period um anytime from right then to the whole next week well kept going by no propane no propane kept going down got colder okay we're colder and i ran out of pokeman i looked out there and it says empty and uh but it's getting colder and colder and wait wow maybe they'll come today and they they didn't come and i lit the stove the fire came off wow there's still propane coming out of it it says empty you know oh yeah we went five days like that the thing was sitting down empty and you know and the fire kept coming out i didn't praise the lord all i know is the lord kept the propane coming and they didn't come even on the last day when they got down to 26 degrees that night and that was the day they promised they'd come at eight o'clock at night they said oh we ain't coming till tomorrow i said well wake us up and see if we're still alive but the propane just kept coming and they came late in the afternoon the next day the day after what they'd already promised all i know is that the lord kept the propane coming when it was needed amen was needed bad and it kept coming amen praise the lord praise the lord it's a miracle amen [Applause] amen thank you brother amen my god can do anything our god can do anything amen five days empty propane and we used to be propane in the white mountains and trust me when it gets on empty it's empty it's done uh five days they went in the coldest weather we've had in i don't know a long time two years two years twenty in the mid twenties it dropped down to and then the lord kept them lit five days with no propane in the tank praise the lord that's wonderful amen god is a miracle-working god amen he told me that testimony i think it was thursday it just stirred my heart because they were supposed to be there no later than wednesday and they didn't get their wednesday uh and wednesday night thursday morning was one of the coldest periods of time and then get there thursday afternoon right when he texted me he said they just showed up amen five days praise the lord jesus amen so thankful not only did the lord provide propane for them but it was free propane they'd have to pay for it amen god is good isn't he amen amen praise the lord okay i know i didn't have a song but just quick a couple quick testimonies um joel's finally done with his antibiotics for helping the family they do that and um brother tom would have had to go get more petrified wood because he almost sold out of all the wood at the show um and he went up third super early thursday morning when i got to work at nine o'clock he was already in the mountains and when i got to work friday he was already back down from the mountain with his load but he left early that morning um and shortly after he got through the canyon the semi had kind of run off the edge and shut down the canyon so we just want to thank him for keeping him safe amen um let him get through before the candy got shut down praise the lord amen and just keep it safe anyone else just open it up for a minute that's okay go ahead assistant i start my new job tomorrow a little nervous but yeah just keep it in prayer that everything will be okay amen so testimony and prayer requests yes amen praise the lord i got blood work then monday i think anyway though i was supposed to get it done last year but i don't like blood work things um as you guys know i went through like a really hard time with um like swollen lymph nodes and positive a a which usually means you have like it out of you my abilities was low rnp was very high which pointed to um lupus or connected tissue disorder so i hadn't i've been holding it off to find out which one it was and then i went um my a was negative so i have nothing wrong with me praise the [Applause] lord amen thank you jesus amen i already knew that but it's always good when you get the test amen and the test says negative they praise the lord that settles it yes amen thank you jesus god's so good didn't he amen he is our healer touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen amen that's not really my testimony but uh you know i take care of a lady that drive around and do jobs for her and um she has a neighbor that's a veteran and he um he's paralyzed and he goes around the neighborhood and cleans up things for the whole neighborhood that he just loves doing that and i met him one time he's such a nice man well he was out there about a couple months ago and was pulling weeds and stuff and a rattlesnake pita and so um kate told me about it and we just prayed and she said i'll get my church to pray and she says so many you get your church right so i mentioned to a few of you well he's out of the hospital and he's he's just got a fight on his hand and they were miraculous the doctor said it's amazing because he's in his late 70s didn't lose any nerves or anything so all he has is some teeth marks he says it's just a reminder i'm just thankful the power of prayer yeah people will say when you pray for us and god answers it amen yes praise the lord don't ever let it become just a phrase amen when people say pray for me or we'll pray for you pray amen hold that before the lord take that serious life and death well it's not life and death it could be amen it could be amen and even if it isn't we still expect and believe god to move amen it doesn't have to be a life or death before god moves right amen praise the lord anyone else sister i had blood work done a few days ago and on wednesday i go for my results so i just want to ask everybody to please pray for me that all of it will come they've been checking for i don't know what for almost two years and they just keep giving me appointments to go back and i don't know what the point is but i know the lord is has healed me if there was anything there raise the law yes you hunt for something is not there trying to that's just the way of the devil too try to keep hump for something that's not there to try to convince you it is when you know it's not amen anyone else amen praise the lord god bless you have a good week this week amen enjoy your today tuesday was today groundhog day amen two two two two was today my wife's favorite numbers too so i paid special attention of course she's got a really special day coming up when it's 2 22 22. but i'm i'm glad that the groundhog saw his shadow i i want six more weeks of winter it's a little cold this past week and tough uh i've been pressure washing up at my old client mary's house and with it windy and cold it was it was a little challenging but amen i'm thankful to god god is uh our work with brother rogers been a little on the slower side but the lord's given me some side jobs to work on and it's really helped so i'm thankful for that praise the lord let's stand to our feet if we could amen we'll turn our bibles to genesis chapter seven genesis chapter seven last week i left off with mentioning to you something that the lord had put on my heart as i was in here praying saturday and most of you know i most of the time or i try to unless something else comes up i spend some port as part of every saturday in here usually most all day saturday but uh something came on my heart um that i mentioned to you before we dismiss service uh last sunday and uh thought that maybe the lord would have me to delve into it a little deeper and so yesterday he did so uh well during the week but especially yesterday so that's what the lord willing we're going to try to bring today but before we do let's just fire our heads for another word of prayer lord jesus father we thank you again for this service we thank you for this time we thank you for giving us lord the desire in our heart to be in the house of god for those who weren't able to make it may be streaming today lord we thank you for your presence in our lives and for watching over protecting us and bringing us to this place in this time today lord no doubt another time that you give us and and a time lord that we'll never meet again just like this lord and we don't know what this might be the last time we ever meet together like this lord there we are that close we know we believe lord that we're getting to that point in time lord the the squeezing down if you will lord of the things that's going on in this world in this country this freedom of religion that we have christianity is being squeezed out lord and so are its people which is your people and lord god we're trusting in you before we can be completely shut out god you're going to take us home because as we're being pushed out of this world we're being pushed towards you and whom god is where we desire to be and we trust you lord to to as you fulfill the promise of your word to bring us to that point in time help us lord to continue to let go of ourselves to let go of our ideas our opinions thoughts lord to let go of anything that would hinder us from being molded and shaped into your image by you help us lord that this word god would not return void but find this place in the heart of your people today we thank you lord for all that you do for us all the wonderful testimonies we heard lord and all the prayer requests that we had that tomorrow are going to be testimonies lord we thank you for them we committed all to your hands and give you praise honoring glory lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen genesis chapter 7 i want to read three verses beginning with the 13th verse genesis 7 13 in the self-same day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sword and they went into uh they went in unto noah into the ark two and two uh of all flesh wherein is the breath of life and they that went in when in male and female of all flesh is god had commanded him and the lord shut him in amen you can be seated if you'd like for those who may not have remembered last week when we finished off the service i mentioned to you a thought that the lord had put on my heart with all the things that's going on and you know so many things and so many times the lord does things and and we don't understand them and sometimes we may never understand them sometimes the lord may give us a little insight or show us a little something and uh i'm just believing that that's something that the lord put on my heart that maybe that could be a portion of what's going on but i mentioned the the the two words last week uh that the lord had given me when i was in prayer last saturday and that was the final preparations because i started again especially after brother charlie passed again i started thinking and and and looking at that as as we've considered the how many people are passing now it's really in my lifetime i've only lived 56 years but in my lifetime i can't remember a time when there's been so many people passing that i know of christians godly people people i believe to be my brothers and sisters holy ghost filled people from all different varieties of course covets hit the land and they say that covet has claimed the lives of many but there's been a lot of people that i know that have gone on and it wasn't code yes but for different reasons uh it just seems like there's just been an inordinate amount of people that are continuing to pass on and it it made me contemplate it made me start thinking praying talking to the lord maybe why this is going on lord why is this happening why now are these things taking place i mean i thought about it i prayed about it me and brother rogers discussed it and our thoughts about it and you know without a scriptural precedent without a an emphatic prophet prophetic utterance we don't really know uh all i can do is believe what i feel the lord put on my heart and that was the final preparations that was what the lord had put on my heart the other day i expressed that with you last sunday the final preparations of what's going on in the world today and there comes that time when with every major event and i'll go through a couple of events that we see in in the scripture uh major events that god does things to bring people to the place of being prepared but he also has this period of time and usually that period of time scripturally is a very short period of time so if we've entered into that to that point of of what's going on right now our god's final preparations scripturally from what i could find that period of time is a very short period now the preparation period could take years i mean we just read about noah and the ark it took noah 120 years to build the ark as the scripture discusses 120 years to build this ark and and that's a long time i mean that's longer than any of us will live that's longer than anybody i've known in my life to live maybe there's been a couple of people that are around the world over the past 50 years that have lived maybe a little older than 120 but 120 years is a long period of time but that was the preparation period but the finalization of those preparations was a very very concise short period of time and if we've entered into that period of time we're in that that that final that stage of final preparation then his friends it's not going to be much longer i uh you know preparations can take years months years uh but that that last part uh actually shuts it down to just in just a very short period of time now the word preparation which i found unusual to me uh because i looked it up just the webster's dictionary definition something done listen to this now this is not this is not final preparation this is just preparations so preparation is something that is done to get ready for an event or undertaking so preparation is something that is done to make ready for an event that's what a preparation is for now when god gave noah god came to the to the point of repentance that he made man he come to the point that that the world was corrupt and violent uh in in chapter 16 um let's see in verse 12 it said god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt the earth was corrupt and for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth god said in north the end of flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy the earth now that violence if you look that up in the hebrew it says injustices the world had become so unjust unjust violence uh that that injustice began to infiltrate into everybody's everyday normal life uh it was strange because me and uh brother roger did a job the other day and these people were describing to us uh something that they had done or a family member had done and and they they did what they did where they did it i don't want to go into the details but they did it because they wanted to make sure that how they did it it would not get stolen or or vandalized or destroyed and i and we got the van i told brother roger i said it's a horrible shame that we have to conduct our lives in the manner that one of the first things we think about is making sure how and where we do it is where nobody's going to steal it or destroy it it's sad that that has to be a consideration you know when i was a kid that wasn't consideration i mean there was violence of course in the earth in the country it was violence and things like that and robberies and injustice but it's gotten to the place that it affects really it seems like except maybe a godly holy ghost-filled christian it affects their everyday life one time we we had some stuff stolen out of a out of a storage unit and and it was kind of partly my fault but i told my wife i said i don't think like a criminal when you don't think like a criminal you don't think that this is going to be prime real estate for a criminal to to plunder to steal you just don't think like that people used to leave their doors home people used to leave there i know people used to where i lived people used to leave their keys in their car overnight the door unlocked right left their home doors unlocked but it's gotten to the place now not only have we gone past that but we've gotten to the place that people's minds are so consumed with the violence the unjustice that even when they think about doing a normal everyday thing they have to consider the violence the the theft the violent aspect of it and it's sad that it's got to that place but that's the place it's gotten well god destroyed the earth here and god's about to do the same thing again now he promised not to do it by water but he's going to do it by fire so he did it once he's going to do it again so if we look at the scriptural precedent of what god did when he did it the first time i believe that we can look at that and understand that that might be a prescription that we can look at for what he's going to do again and when you look at what's going on a lot of it really does tend to fall into place when you recognize what is what it's doing now when when this came to god when god i'll say come to the realization but just talking normal when god began to discuss this with noah god told noah that's it's corrupt and violent so i'm going to destroy the earth but i found favor with you noah so i'm going to spare you and your family and i want you and your family uh to be to be saved and and all these animals that he chose see two of every one all the creeping things the the birds the animals the male the female of everyone to come into this place of safety and this place of safety is going to be what i tell you it's going to be noah and i want you to do this i want you to build it this way and this way and use this wood and use this pitch and do it exactly this way in this dimensions and this high and i want i don't want all of my instructions to be followed to a t noah and noah followed god's instructions perfectly right amen just like i believe that we today should follow god's instructions perfectly we don't need to add our ideas in here right we don't need to put our opinions in here we don't need to try to alter it to fit what we think it will be we don't need to try to get rid of the old testament they're trying to justify our little pet doctrines no we need to follow it exactly the way god gave it to us and exactly the way god gave it to noah god followed noah followed god's instructions exactly the way god told him to and that was why it sustained the storm when the storm hit now we know noah was the type of the other foolish virgin that goes over the tribulation through the tribulation period and come out on the other side but the that's not the type that we're looking at the type we're looking at is god destroying the earth god destroyed the earth then god's going to destroy the earth again what did he do here he found a people that he was pleased with he found a people that was perfect and upright he found a people that that despite all that was going on in the wickedness of the world that they found favor with god and that was noah and and god found the same thing today god has found a people that he has found favor with god has found a people that that put him first god has found a people that desire to be godly holy people even in all the the corruption and wickedness is going on in the world today he's found a people i believe i'm a part of that people i believe you're a part of that people he's found that people he's given that people an instruction book to follow to be able to understand how to prepare yourselves to get to the place where he's wanting to take us to faith in a body change for a rapture god's given us the instructions god's done everything he could possibly do to make sure that we are in that place now all the preparation that noah went through all the 120 years that noah built on that ark he did everything the way god told him to do it built it exactly the way god told him to build it and it took him all this time to do it see that was the preparation life was going on as normal people were living their lives just like normal the the the people were sinning and becoming more and more corrupt look they the people didn't start getting better as the ark was being built the people got worse as the ark was being built you think about brother branham's testimony i mean brother random was he was ready to quit he did quit at one point for a very short period of time but he was ready to quit brother brahms he says i i preach it and i preach it and i come back and i find it's worse now than it was the last time i preached it right he said i come back to that place and i preach the gospel and i preach the gospel i preach the gospel and i come back the next year the next time and sin is worse then and the people are worse then than they were when i was here last time because they don't get better during that period now now god is calling out one or two here there god's calling out his people here and here but the whole cell a spirit of the world the whole cell spirit of the people is getting worse now god's calling his out here god's calling one or two out here you send brother branham or a minister or uh uh you amen he can send you to go get this one person out and through your testimony through your help through god using you can bring that person to him so god does that piece at a time maybe one here one there a couple here maybe this service or something but the whole cell atmosphere the whole cell spirit of it got worse and worse and worse amen it's got worse since brother branham left it's worse today than it was yesterday it'll be worse tomorrow than it is today thank god i know a god who holds tomorrow amen so it didn't get better as noah built on the ark it just got worse and worse but he kept building he kept doing what god told him to do all those preparations everything went on like normal everything was exactly the way it's and they got worse but it was just normal as he built on the ark that was all the preparations that was made to bring it to this certain point because god was not going to let his son die with the wicked so he made him a way of escape him and his family praise the lord god made a web escape for him and his family remember that hold that to your heart now god made that way not just for noah but for his family praise the lord but the bible does not say that god found favor with his sons the bible does not say god found favor with his wife or with his with his daughter-in-laws he found favor with noah but because it was noah and they were a part of him they were saved as well they were they were allowed to go on the ark as well god wanted to preserve the animal life all those were the preparations that was made but when it come to the end of this when the ark was made when the when let's just say for a lack of better phrase the cup of iniquity was full the ark was built all the preparations had been made everything that god had told noah had been done now what happens they're still there so there has to be what i'm phrasing here that final preparation before destruction hit that final preparation we just read that final preparation that self-same day entered noah shem ham japheth noah's wife and his son's wives on the ark all the animals came in everything that god had said now god brought those animals in amen right noah did not go out hunting all of these animals and find a male giraffe over here and a female giraffe over here and say hey guys come with me god brought those animals in you you actually believe that noah went and and got two of the different variety of birds male and female i mean maybe he stood there as they came and landed on his finger or his shoulder or something but god brought them in all the creeping things of the earth no it didn't go digging god brought them that was god's that was god's final preparation which brings me to this understanding now that these final preparations once god has done what he's done his people the preparations have been made the ark was built everything was set and ready to go it come a time where they had to get on the ark and the rest was up to god the rest god did now when when all these saints are going home that's not our doing that's god doing it that's him making those final preparations for what reason i don't know i don't know why that's part of the final preparations but in my opinion i believe based on my my talking to him the other day about it and him giving me this that could very well be the point and if it is that's god doing that's not us doing it when though when they went on the ark the rest was up to god god shall see at the end of this god shut him in the lord shut noah in noah didn't even shut the door once they got in the ark of safety god did the rest all the animals god brought all the animals in they had to go but all the preparations were made but god took care of the final preparations the final preparations were held by him all the animals came in and god shut the door god shut the door they come knocking noah let us in no can't let you in god shut the door can't open no latch no string there's no rope no way to open the door i can't open it god shut it he's the only one that can open it while the door is shut when god shuts the door free and it's shut there is no opening amen when when grace is spurned for the last time there's nothing left but judgment when that door shut it shut there's no opening there was no opening on the ark and god shut them in that was it god took care of the rest of it noah's not the one that caused it to rain no it's not the one that brought the judgment noah's not the one that brought the the rain upon the earth god did that god shut the door god brought the animals god's the one that finished the final preparations now between the time that noah went on the ark and god shut the door we know it was seven days amen before it actually started raining a seven day period of time where they were sitting there on the ark maybe possibly his sons his daughter-in-law is wondering dad when is when is this judgment you're talking when is this going to happen day three now it's been three days dad are you sure well god shut the door what do you think him fourth day fifth day dad i i know god shut the door but there's been five days how much longer we're gonna have to wait for this sure they're human friends they were humans just like we get sometimes we get that way sometimes in our lives we question god and we wonder or we think why or when is this and those things happen to to us as humans it happened to them as humans i'm sure it did that and i'm paraphrasing that's obviously not in the scripture we know but you can just imagine after the sixth day no rain but god's the one that brought the final preparation to bring them to that point and then when judgment struck that was the end of it that was that that destroyed that destroyed everything now all that noah did through through bringing those instructions to the ark was done noah did exactly what god said do you know we believe that when the bride is ready god will take her home but do you realize that in our eyes we will never be ready i'll i will never i can't believe that i will let's just say i mean we don't know what might happen after the dead start to appear before us right but in my in my flesh looking at myself looking at you we'll never be ready not in my eyes but it's not my eyes i'm concerned about because i don't do the final preparations that's god's doing yeah and i believe god's doing it right now through his spirit moving upon his people we've done what he told us to do we've been born again filled with his spirit had the holy ghost we followed his word we live in our lives based on the word that he's given us we've done and followed the instructions the way god has shown us to follow them the best that we know how now when god looks at it what is he looking at he's looking at a perfect bride amen a perfect bride it's just like the manifest the manifested sons of god i have so many people look and say well i don't believe that's taken place yet within i tell them but did you know how far along we've gotten to go before rapture if the sons of god are not manifesting themselves if they have not been manifested at this point then where are we we're not in a rapture because that's got to happen before the rapture takes place there's got to be a manifestation of the sons of god oh friend i i i believe there's going to be a there's going to be a finalization to that but i believe the sons of god are being manifested right now now they're always here we talk about uh him the lord coming in power and manifestation you know what that means that means that god is here he's just having to show himself reveal himself or manifest himself to show who he really is well god does that to us every day every day of our lives god does that very thing when you shun the world and you shun sin and you turn your back on the things of the world to follow god in his word that is exactly what you're doing that preparation in your life is is continually made to do what god's word and when we slip make a mistake do something we shouldn't say something or a little anger spirit or something god forgive me i'm sorry lord i didn't mean to be like that but but see the life that was in the blood we always talk about the blood and not that is true the blood is the annihilates every sin but the chemistry of the blood went on the earth it's the life that was in that blood what was the life in the blood it was him it was christ it was the holy ghost it was his life coming on us well friend if his life has come on us then we are guiltless we are sinless no matter how many times now we don't do it purposely see then that's where it gets it you know brother said the catholic church has a lot of truth in it you know he said that right amen they have a lot of truth but they go to seed on so many things and and even like the absolute absolution of sin but they go to seed on it but see that's the difference between a child of god and someone who practices it as a religion a child of god just lives that word because it's who they are someone who practices it as a religion sees it as a right some kind of a religious right that they do it's not a religious right for us it is a it is life when the life come into that in in to each one of us the the light that was in the blood it annihilated every sin past present future amen as if though you never sinned to begin with praise the lord now again unlike the catholic church or other churches my there's probably even people i know i try to watch myself sometimes but in this message they think they can do whatever they want and it's okay well god forgives me no if you're just living your life however you want to it proves there's not a life of god in you that's the best way i can explain it it may sound harsh but that's just the truth if you're living your life and you say oh well god will forgive me i'll just live however i want and god will forgive me then your life is not lived according to the life that he has put in you your testimonies your life is not matching your testimony your life must match your testimony that way it's not a matter of saying oh i know god will forgive me no i don't ever want to do it in the first place but we are still human we do make mistakes we still do things that we shouldn't do but the final preparation friend that's god's to do that's god's we've done what god has told us to do now we're in the position now we know that we we grow in grace uh we know we lay in the presence of the sun to ripen but who ripens us as we do what god told us to do and we read our bibles we pray we live for god we live our lives for god we we shun evil we do what god's life what god's word commands us to do that's a that's a bride that's ready to go home but it's god's time whatever god sees and you know there was this period of time where we kind of went through this in the message where we're waiting on that last seat you know some preacher somewhere found a quote where brother adam mentioned about a last seed and i don't disagree with that now don't get me wrong i'm not just agree with that but we can't base everything that we are and what we do and how we live just on worrying about one last scene it makes us apathetic is what it does and we can't ever get to the place that we're where we're apathetic friend we should always be striving and pushing and and living for god and obeying his word and doing what god commands us to do it's a bride that's ready see and when the bride is done what god said the rest is up to him then what else can we do can you give yourself a body change can you cause the dead in christ to rise can you cause a rapture to take place can you make a rapture happen that god does all that right god's the one that raises the dead god's the one that uh brings a body change god's the ones now it's a reflection of what we've what we have done by following the instruction just like being in the ark and going over the flood was a reflection of the preparations that was made it was it only it only reflected what had already been done because he was there us a body change taking place in us is simply a reflection of what we're doing by living holy godly christian lives it's the result is just a reflection of that see you can make biscuits all day and and you know how to make biscuits and and the flour and the dough and and and do everything and how to cook them put them in the oven and but but once all the ingredients go in and make this nice beautiful biscuit that you come out and stick a nice piece of country ham in the middle of an eat that's just a result of what you did over here right it's just a result you went and did all the preparation but then you put in the oven the oven baked it and made it do what it was supposed to bring it to the point where you could eat it but you look at the this final biscuit that you eat and that's and it's it's a good one it's really good but it's just a result of what happened over here with your apron all flowered in hands i saw my mom make thousands of biscuits in my life eight probably thousands of them myself too but i saw the result that happened when she go stick that thing in the oven she's just covered she's got dough on her fingers she's got flour aprons she's you know probably even in her hair going everywhere it's just a result of and so the biscuit that we come out that the kids eat and enjoy it's just a result of what mom did to prepare it to bring it to that point now see so we don't negate the preparations that that god has commanded and called and put in our possession to do but we know that the the rest of this that god is doing now i believe that god is doing now is the final preparation to bring it to that place amen god didn't tell us that to for so and so to go to their reward now that god knows that so god does that that's not in our charge it's not in our control nor is it in our charge of control for them to resurrect from the dead that's god to do nor is it for us to go in a rapture body change that's for god to do but it's a result of what god has already done for us and through us and the effort that we put into it amen that is just it's just the resulting example now the interesting thing that came to me this morning was when god destroyed the earth in the flood there was one person there was one man that we notably at least notably died at the time of the flood amen that was methuselah yes methuselah was the man that not only lived the longest on the earth 969 years he was not on the oldest man ever to live but he was uh he was a a signal yeah uh to noah even brother adam talked about enoch and enoch going up well enoch methuselah was enoch's son and methuselah's name in in the greek methuselah as you see it in i believe it's matthew means when he dies there shall be an emission or a sending forth of waters upon the earth that that is built into methuselah's name that's what his name means when i die when methuselah dies there will be an initiation on a mission of coming forth of water upon the earth methuselah and when did methuselah die methuselah you can go get one of brother past charts if you haven't you can see but through this little scripture you go read the scripture you can see he just did the work you go see methuselah died the same year according to scripture yes that the flood took place yes amen so if methuselah died and methuselah passing on propagated the final preparation would that have been a part of that final preparation there's a little passing to me methuselah passing away was a part of the final preparations noah didn't do that no no his family they didn't go kill methuselah god did that right the final preparation that god had in the angel of the world and the destruction of the flood was to take a man from the earth for him to die for him to pass away so we can't say well you know the the final preparations that's taking place today all these people going beyond the curtain of time or god taking them or going to their resting place or final reward god taking these people is that a part of these final preparations these final preparations i would say methuselah had to die at that time for god's word to be fulfilled it was in his name so when methuselah died god taking methuselah was a part of the final preparations god was making then god told noah y'all get on the ark all the animals came the creeping things the birds and all came on the ark and then god shut the door and god made it rain and god brought the floods and god did all the final preparation everything about it was god but it probably it was propagated by him taking a man from the earth it began with methuselah dying amen if god's done it once we look at types and shadows to see if god does it once would he do it again right he's the same god yes amen let's go to acts chapter 2. another major scriptural event one very pertinent to today acts chapter 2 verse 1. we know it we probably could quote it acts 2 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost who began to speak with other tongues as the spirits gave them utterance now jesus had already told them jesus told him to go to jerusalem and carry there until you'd be endued with power from omaha right that was god's instructions the preparations were made it cost a man his life whose life did it cost jesus it cost jesus life because it wasn't the same day but within a few weeks of jesus passing dying is when he came into the upper room and fulfilled this scripture man died jesus all the preparations were already made jesus was here he walked with him he talked with them they saw him all the things that took place while jesus was here and all the things he told him to do was exactly what god had told him amen and when they got to that place and jesus then told him he said now i'd carry in jerusalem until you were endued with power from on high so what did they do they finalized that preparation god gave them and they went in jerusalem in the upper room and they carried there and i don't know that we know how long the scripture doesn't say they were there a while tearing in the upper room waited in the upper room now they had done all of their part right they had done everything god told them to do now the final preparation was up to god the rest of it was god to do because the bible says they were fully come when the day of pentecost was fully come now that would be a finalization of that preparation fully would be a a finalization of something is fulfilling of something correct unless i'm wrong the finalization of something is a fulfilling of something it it is fulfilled when it fully when the day of pentecost fully came see they were all with one accord in one place now they've done what they were supposed to do that was their part after they had done their part suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and filled all the house where they were sick now who did that that was god god came down and filled all the house just like i come i pray in this place god fill all this house where we'll be sitting right see fill this whole house where we'll be sitting do it again today lord yes he's done so many times yes but i can't do that i can pray that we can make the preparations we can be here but it takes god to do it it takes god to come and fill this place to fill all this house it takes god to appear uh uh with cloven tongues like a fire and set upon each one and fill each one with the holy ghost it takes god to do that that's not mine that's god's doing now once the final preparations were made what is the result the result is a christian what we just simply call a christian today i don't think a person should be allowed to be called a christian unless they're born again and filled with the holy ghost that's my opinion because the word christian means to be christ-like and there's no way you can even come close to being christ-like unless you've been born again and filled with the holy spirit amen amen so that made christians that made godly men and women that made people fulfilling the scripture joel 2 28 that he poured out his spirit upon all flesh who god did they made the preparations but it took god to bring in the final preparations for them to become christians it took god to do the final preparations to destroy and wipe out all life upon this earth to bring about a new world in the andalusian flood it's got to do the same thing as we recognize what's going on today this final preparation is glad to make it now in the flood a man died methuselah it's a signal noah get on the ark flood's coming when jesus died it was a signal go terry in jerusalem until you are due with power when they did then jesus died his spirit came you understand this major event these major events god's taking care of that the final preparations i hope i make this clear god's the ones that does that we have to fulfill and complete the parts that god give us to do now the rest of it's up to him and i believe he's doing it i do i'll just be honest i know i've been a little vague about it but i honestly do believe that a lot of this is going on now and so many of these saints of god passing on is is god's final preparation now why it's that way i don't know i know why it was with methuselah i know why it was with jesus but i don't know why it is today i don't but i do know that i believe that god's given me specific instruction to let you know saints yes covet is going to be like a cold compared to what's about him we haven't seen anything amen but about what then what's about to hit this earth amen and these are just the preparations that god is making friend because brother adam said there will be a time the only immunity we'll have is the holy spirit yes amen the only immunity we'll have will be the holy spirit saints and and i believe we're at that time not necessarily with covet but what is going to happen after this right you think these people in power these people that have all kinds of money and can do pretty much whatever they want because it's all hidden darkness you think they can do whatever they want they you think now that they figured out a way that they can garner control of the world's population they're going to let that go right oh goodness no you just see a small sm a spackling of it just in this country i mean even studies have come out lately and said that all these shutdowns and nests and all this stuff has done little to nothing to assuage the depth of our population little to nothing so and not the shots i'm not saying that but the the the shutting down the country and the quarantining and the masking and all that they've come out with studies now that have proved that that point two percent of people it probably helped now thank god that's good for those point two of people but that's a small amount of people compared to the people that were affected adversely by the shutdown by losing their livelihoods by losing their money but but suicides and people killing themselves and drug addiction and and and the suicides the the mental disparity how many how many people have fallen prey to that versus what coven would have done left undone but even with the studies that have come out and said now and said how little effect it has had they still keep things clamped down they still keep the people under their thumbs why because they found out a way that they can keep get control over the world's population this is an international bride and it's going to be an international rapture but that being said it's also going to be an international satan's eden that's going to be controlled by the beast it's not just going to be the united states that's going to be controlled by the beast the entire world is going to be controlled by the beast so you think for one moment that they found out exactly how they can gain control even over the freedom-loving citizens of this country that they're going to let it go this is just the beginning friends what's going to come on this earth is brother adam talked about making cancer look like a toothache well koga's been pretty bad but it's not going to be anything compared to what's coming yeah but who god is in control of his own god takes care of his children yes god's going to take care of us friend regardless amen god's going to take care of his children because he always takes care of them god finalized this day in the upper room god finalized it amen elohim before god destroyed sodom and gomorrah god came to abraham because he said shall i let abraham shall i do this great thing without letting abraham know no got to go tell abraham abraham was his man just like he told noah just like he told jesus and told the disciples just like god sent a prophet to this last day to tell a bride at this last day surely the lord god would do nothing except he reveal his secrets to his servants the prophets now i'm not talking about an agabus prophet i'm talking about a word prophet like william branham not somebody that just has a simple prophetic gift that might hit a little here a little bit there i'm talking about somebody who had thus saith the lord that never failed they had a word to bring a bride to a place to where it brought rapturing faith through the word a transformation through the word it had to be for this last day god did it here he did it with abraham when god went to abraham god told abraham and abraham said i gotta go now god said i gotta go now and see whether it's all as bad as they say it is and he sent the other two angels to go check they went down there they pulled out lot his family and and then what happened the final preparations was made or the the preparations was made who did the final preparation god did yes god said i have to go down there now and see now he sent us two angels but it was the same thing they were his representatives they had his spirit if you will saying that more in reference to us today we have his spirit we are his representatives we acknowledge and recognize what's going on in the spirit of the world today we acknowledge that this bride worldwide we acknowledge it we see it as it is we know it's as bad as it is friend how much longer till the cup of iniquity is full today i dares i say not much not much if any but if final preparations are being made now seven days on the ark after the final after the preparations were made seven days were the were the fulfillment of the final preparations the day of pentecost 50 days amen 50 days that's all that there was that was years preparing up to that point for 50 days look at well we don't know about when elohim went to abraham but when the destruction came it was there the angels came that day the next day they spent the night there the next day they said get out get out of the city and don't look back and as soon as the heels hit the edge of that city fire and brimstone rained upon that city there was no more mercy there was no more grace there's nothing but judgment friend i know when i talk about the blood on the mercy seat when that blood comes off that mercy seat friend it becomes a judgment seat after that after that happens there's nothing left but judgment amen is it there i don't think so is it going to get there absolutely yes i have my idea of when it will i believe it'll be when the dead and christ rise that's my opinion yes well the band doesn't say but that's my opinion i think it'll be at that time i think at that point that that is the equivalent in my opinion of god shutting the door yes right no more come in no more get out brother man and preach souls that are in prison amen souls are in prison yeah they were prince too but they had no way out they had no escape they had no way to get out noah preached to those that were banging on the door noah let us in i can't let you in god shut the door noah's preaching to him god shut the door i can't open him amen what could they do about it there was nothing they could do about it god had built that god had had noah in the instructions build that art to the place that is impenetrable they couldn't get in that ark if they wanted to making fun of him of course but they couldn't get in there when they come and preach the souls that are in prison that's it friend there's no more mercy god have mercy on us now because there is there will be none at that point there will be no mercy amen the bride's seal she's done finished brother brown talks about that time the blood comes off the mercy seat he's got that book and there's no more mercy there's nothing but judgment those final preparations what's god doing is that now has the last one come in we don't know we do know there's a short period of time i can't see how it could be much longer jesus said as it was in the days of sodom as it was in the days of life if you want to question anything about this the spirit the scripture references a precedent that i've tried to pull for you today you can look at jesus own words he said as it was in the days of noah so shall it be today right not his day amen today now it was there too but he's talking about us today when the prophetic son of man is being revealed again that's today brother brahm didn't do anything else he was to point us the bride of christ to christ not to himself to him christ the word that was his message that was his purpose to turn a bride's heart back to the the faith back to christ the word jesus said so shall it be as it is and it is today amen he said surely i'll do nothing except i reveal it to my servants the prophets revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets finished when he finished his work god took him home yeah amen where are we now we're 56 years later and the bride's still sitting here those that of us who are left those who of us who have come along since that time right some of us sitting here that's been born since 1965. there's a few of us that was before 1965 but i think most of us sitting here after 1965 including myself well 10 days so where are we at today have we reached the place of those final preparations i would say yes i would say that that's a part of what we're watching what's going on today i would say that's part of what why we see the loved ones going on and why the the the world is turning the way it's turning and the government and and and what colbot has done and and believing that covet is just the beginning it's just i say beginning but it's just a it's just a pin prick to what's going to happen what is about to strike this earth friend men's hearts are going to fail for fear just simply being afraid they're going to be so afraid their hearts are going to stop beating that's going to be a perilous time saints we're in bad times today but i haven't heard of anybody's heart just stopping because they're afraid of something now people are in engulfed with fear but not to that point so what's it going to be we're at that finalization i know when the lord had me write this book all the preparations and all the typing and all the things does god give me i started years before that a lot of people don't know it but every morning when i go into school i would i put on earphones and i'd listen to the scripture for an hour or more i can't remember how long it was now i'd go in at six o'clock and school didn't start to eight and i would i'd sit there at my desk and just listen to the bible and every time a scripture something came up i i'd write it down something the lord inspired me to that that would follow along in that same then i wrote it down all the scripture all the scripture that's in that book i don't know all that i didn't know all that scripture by my heart i'm not that smart i've read the bible through of course many times or a few times at least from beginning to end but i'm not that smart to remember all those scriptures but as the lord gave me that to do and had that period of time i wrote all those scriptures down i had pages of scriptures i had them written in different places even so when it come time and and i finally succumbed to the lord saying do this and i said okay lord i'm insufficient to this job but i'll do it but what have i told you sometimes god is just looking for somebody who's willing a less qualified person god will give a job to a less qualified person just because they're willing to do it i finally became willing to do it but all those scriptures were there all the scriptures up but all this just all preparation yeah amen then i had a final preparation i had uh brother dale knight proof read it for me i had brother mark stroke or proofread i had different ones look at it read it go over it and march and i i had four or five six five copies of it when it was done here and then this was still wrong and then to fix them for before it finally came to where it is today i had so many copies but there come a time where the final preparation was made before it went to the printer and it became what it was amen thank god creation was done the same way god did creation the same way amen nobody died at that point but all of earth was created at that point for that all the pre the preparations that god had made god rested on the seventh day but that was because of everything he had already done god took and created heaven and earth and then he planted botany life in the earth then he brought forth animal life on the earth and then he finalized it by putting human man making man a spirit being just like he was and then putting him in flesh and planting him in the garden of eden just like a tree it's planted by the river of water adam was set there in the in the garden of eden planted like a tree roots going out you read that he was planted he was a man that was god's final preparation god made man last and then he rested amen i believe that's what god's doing today i believe the final preparations are happening right now it's a short period of time but we've been 7 000 years what's this short period of time going to be is it going to be days is it going to be months is it going to be a year years i don't know but it's very significant when you see things in the spiritual realm taking place the way they are that's god's doing that's not our doing that's god moving so many years it looked like we were just going along the way we were going and then all of a sudden and people want to blame it on this that or the other a lot of people want to blame it on covet i don't amen again i don't think god through code can't claim god's children but satan is excuse me can't claim god's children through copenhagen but it's just a part of this period of time amen notice when god does those things like that it's not just the one thing god brings it kind of comes all in at the same time together and and then that's what's going on i i to me that's what i see that god's doing it's happening god's making the final preparations now how much longer is it before we go home yeah i don't know i might be a part of that final preparation you might be a part of it it doesn't matter aids doesn't matter amen aids doesn't matter although i do believe it would be more along the lines of someone who is beyond the age of accountability but that's god's determination god does the final preparations let's just continue to live that godly holy christian life and let and be that example to be that one god has made us to be amen there should never be a time when we become apathetic never should there be a time where we think all there's no more souls can be saved don't ever brother graham said don't ever think like that should never be a time where we stop ministering before we stop being a reflection of christ or stop trying to help somebody come to christ don't ever we should never get to that place i know years ago it was just like a spirit that weighed through and people started preaching that blow off the mercy seat there's nothing but judgment and no more souls saved than that and and people become apathetic they didn't want to try to go win souls to christ anymore and they didn't want to uh continue on the process that god gave us in his scripture to fulfill because it just well it's it's over well if it's over then it's over no no god is still working and and he's still producing the results the finalized results are going to be god's doing amen praise the lord let's stand if we could i believe we're at the end i really do i believe we're the place that we've been looking for that we've been expecting for really mo all of our christian life at least looking for those finalized results looking for the preparations god has made for us there's always in every major event in the scripture there's always been the preparation that god prepares his people for and that god finalizes those preparations for her on her behalf we work on his behalf and then he finalizes on our behalf the finalization of this is going to be us going in a rapture going home dead in christ your rights those are alive and remain to be caught up to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord praise god amen i'm so thankful we get into the new city the preparations god has made you go to john 14 1 he's gone and prepared a place if it wasn't so he would have told us but it's already been prepared god's already made it brother branham preach future home amen but the end of that is going to be god's doing i just want to be a part of it amen i just want to be a part of it praise the lord let's sing this course to him today before we go amen this is your heart's desire today i know we've seen this quite often but it's in because it's always the way i feel i guess amen [Music] with [Music] r for you yes lord prepare me to be tried and true [Music] you [Music] amen amen oh make us more like you jesus praise the lord god amen those things we have our part to play but then the rest of it is his to do things we cannot do but what we can do let's do with all our hearts amen give him all we've got praise the lord jesus and i believe he'll continue to be there with us even until the end because he promised he would be praise the lord god bless you i pray something was said to bless you today amen maybe give some clarity maybe give some understanding but more than anything that preparation because again saints there's going to be more come that's going to that's going to bring separation it's going to separate the believer from the unbeliever amen is going to separate the believer from the make-believer there's going to be that separation and something in the dividing line amen that only people with the holy spirit are going to be able to withstand are going to be able to hold how much longer we've got we don't know but i believe it's very close very close at hand amen praise the lord god bless you and appreciate each one of you coming being here today god bless you if you've been streaming amen god's been good to us trust the lord will bless you for another another good week

when you how you get a message together he said you think you're lucky because you gather because of your luck or whatever it comes together because god's leading you to find this to see this to open
