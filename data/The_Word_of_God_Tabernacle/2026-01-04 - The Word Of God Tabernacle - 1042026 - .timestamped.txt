[1:49] Jesus. Good to see each one of you here
[1:50] today. Good to be back in the house of
[1:52] the Lord. Amen. So thankful for the Lord
[1:54] Jesus blessing us with another week,
[1:57] another time to come to his house. Amen.
[1:59] Glory to his name. Let's stand if we
[2:01] could. Amen. We're just going to start
[2:03] our service out with prayer. Amen. Just
[2:06] trust the Lord will meet with us again
[2:08] today. Lord Jesus, we're so very
[2:10] thankful again, Father, for your grace,
[2:12] your mercy. Thank you for your hand of
[2:14] love, God, that you put upon our lives.
[2:17] Lord, lead us and guide us and show us
[2:19] your ways, your truth, your life. God,
[2:22] we are a a needy people today. Father,
[2:25] we are in great need of the continuence
[2:27] of your Holy Spirit to move upon us and
[2:30] to lead us and guide us. And Lord, as
[2:32] that pyramid narrows down to a very tip
[2:35] at the top, God. Lord, we need more
[2:38] direction now than we've ever needed in
[2:40] our lives. We need more of the Holy
[2:42] Spirit, Lord. We need more of you, God,
[2:45] than we've ever had, Father. And we know
[2:47] that the only way that we can get more
[2:49] of you, Lord, is for more of us to die.
[2:52] So Lord, may more of us, God, go away.
[2:55] That Lord, you, Father, would have
[2:57] complete preeminence, complete control,
[2:59] complete authority over our lives and
[3:02] over our direction, leadership, and
[3:04] everything that every one of us would
[3:06] say, God, that we desire more than ever.
[3:08] We're beginning a new year here, Lord,
[3:10] and the fourth day of this new year. And
[3:13] just still hard to believe it's 2026.
[3:16] But Lord, here in a new year, God, we I
[3:19] I believe if every one of us had a a
[3:21] resolution that we would give to you,
[3:23] Lord, it would be that we want to be
[3:24] closer to you, more like you every year,
[3:27] God, that's our desire every day. That's
[3:30] our desire to get more uh more like you,
[3:33] closer to you, Lord. So may you bless us
[3:35] now in this service, Father. May that be
[3:38] granted through this service to each one
[3:40] of us. We rebuke every demonic spirit
[3:43] that would try to hurt, hinder,
[3:44] infiltrate this service in any way that
[3:46] you get the glory, honor, and praise for
[3:48] all that is said and done here today. We
[3:51] give you thanks and praise, Father.
[3:53] Glorify you today in this service.
[3:55] Worship you today in this service.
[3:57] Magnify you today in this service. Give
[3:59] you all that we have, God, in this
[4:01] service today. For this is what we have.
[4:04] This is the day that you give and this
[4:06] is the time, God, that we've chosen.
[4:08] We've come from out of the world, Lord,
[4:10] to to serve you, Father, in this service
[4:13] today. May you receive it unto yourself
[4:16] as a sweet smelling savior. We commit it
[4:18] to you now in the precious name of our

[21:42] and Tommy are out hunting. They're
[21:43] supposed to be hunting. So,
[21:46] &gt;&gt; they're going to go up the mountain
[21:47] today.
[21:49] Tom and Tommy and Elizabeth.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Traveling. Okay. So, let's remember
[21:54] them. Traveling mercies. Amen. Anyone
[21:57] else
[22:00] have unspoken request in your heart?
[22:01] Lord knows all about us today. So
[22:03] thankful for the Lord's blessings to us.
[22:05] Let's stand if we could. Amen.
[22:08] [clears throat]
[22:09] Just take these names of the Lord.
[22:11] Remember Micah and he's on vacation
[22:13] traveling. Uh he's in California. So
[22:16] please remember him in prayer. Amen. If
[22:19] California goes under when he's there,
[22:20] he'll be the first one to go. He'll be
[22:23] the first one of us to go. Uh, I
[22:25] remember brother Green got mad at me
[22:26] because I took the school kids to
[22:28] California one time. And I understand. I
[22:30] I I really do. I get it. I uh those
[22:34] things just I just don't think about
[22:36] that. It doesn't those things don't
[22:38] bother me. I I think I told him made him
[22:41] matter at me, but I think I told him I
[22:43] said, "Well, Brother Green, if it's
[22:44] going to go, I might as I might as well
[22:46] be the first one. I go get knee deep in
[22:48] the ocean and just, you know, I'm I know
[22:51] where I'm going anywhere." So anyway, so
[22:53] whatever the Lord's will is, uh,
[22:55] wherever we are, we just want to be
[22:57] found faithful at the post. Amen.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So please remember him
[23:01] in prayer if you will, as as well. Lord
[23:04] Jesus, we're very thankful again,
[23:06] Father, of this time, of this
[23:07] opportunity. Thank you, Lord, that we
[23:10] know that we can bow our heads from
[23:11] whence our bodies came and trust you to
[23:14] hear our cries, to hear our requests.
[23:18] Lord, you've asked us to ask and we've
[23:19] asked. We've verbalized. We brought up
[23:22] people's names, infirmities, conditions.
[23:25] Lord, you knew them before we ever
[23:27] mentioned them. You knew them before
[23:28] they ever written down. You knew them
[23:29] before they ever became conditions. But
[23:32] Lord, we pray as we call on you now,
[23:34] Father, to move on every one of them, to
[23:36] touch them, Lord, and to bless and be
[23:38] with them and strengthen and heal. God,
[23:40] we just sang that song, Lord, that Lord,
[23:43] Lord, you've been so good to us, Lord.
[23:46] Even when we were when we were sick, you
[23:48] healed us, oh God. We're so thankful for
[23:51] that, Father. And there's some that are
[23:52] out, Lord, today sick, not feeling well.
[23:54] And brother Dennis, Lord, with that
[23:56] foot, he's just having a time with that
[23:58] thing, God. Just touch him. Heal him,
[24:00] Lord. Take that infirmity from his body.
[24:03] Take that infection from his body, Lord.
[24:05] Heal that sore, Lord, and make him
[24:07] perfectly well. We're trusting you for
[24:10] it, Lord God. my brother, sister Pat.
[24:12] God, just continue to touch and
[24:13] strengthen them, Lord, to bring help and
[24:16] healing, Lord, to their bodies. And
[24:18] Lord, just touch them in a supernatural
[24:20] way. Now, Father, we pray. And God,
[24:22] we're just so thankful, Father, for
[24:24] those that have come, Lord, for those
[24:26] who weren't able to make it. May your
[24:27] hand be upon them and help them as well,
[24:29] God. We're continuing to believe, Lord,
[24:32] and pray your hand upon Steve's life,
[24:34] too. God, we've just laid hands on and
[24:37] have belief in prayer of us binding
[24:39] together. And Lord, that's the that's
[24:41] the that's the recipe of your word,
[24:44] Lord, that we do, God. We lay hands on
[24:47] the sick and they shall recover. We know
[24:49] it to be so, God. And we believe it.
[24:51] We've experienced it. We know it, God,
[24:53] because your word says it, Lord. We just
[24:56] pray that you bless our precious brother
[24:58] Caleb Duron, Lord, that you would go
[25:00] where he's at, Lord, and touch him and
[25:01] heal him in that body. raise him up and
[25:04] make him perfectly well, Father, to do
[25:06] your perfect will, whatever it would be
[25:08] in his life, God. And we thank you,
[25:10] Lord, for uh uh uh uh Art and Shariah,
[25:15] God, and not able to be with us today.
[25:16] Help them as well, Lord. And Tom and
[25:19] Tommy, Elizabeth, Lord, traveling today,
[25:21] God. May your hand be upon them and
[25:23] grant them traveling mercies. Get them
[25:25] home safe, Lord, and bless them. And
[25:27] bless my son, Lord Micah. May you help
[25:29] him miss him, Lord, when he's not here
[25:31] so much, God. God, may you just help him
[25:33] be with him and keep him safe, Lord, and
[25:35] bringing back to us, God. We're just
[25:37] thankful, Father, for all that you do
[25:39] for us and all that you've done and just
[25:41] trusting you in all things, God, for
[25:43] every request and every need. We just
[25:46] commit ourselves, Lord, in these
[25:47] requests into your hands. Trust you to

[30:12] What it is to a saint, to a child of
[30:14] God, to have that promise, to know the
[30:16] reality that this world is not our home.
[30:20] I can't even imagine what it would be
[30:21] like, saints, if we didn't have the
[30:23] understanding, the reality to know that
[30:26] this world is not our home. That we have
[30:28] a better home, a greater home waiting.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I don't know if I had to depend
[30:35] on this earth. If I had to depend on
[30:36] this world, if I had to look at this as
[30:39] my final destination,
[30:43] it the life's not worth living hardly.
[30:46] Amen. But I'm so thankful that God has
[30:49] proved to us and shown to us. Amen. That
[30:52] uh we have a home waiting for us. Amen.
[30:56] A home not made by man's hands. Amen.
[30:59] But is prepared of God in the heavens.
[31:01] Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. I
[31:04] appreciate uh I meant I meant to ask for
[31:07] for you don't always forget to ask about
[31:09] myself but uh I'm supposed to have I'm
[31:12] I'm assuming what is an exit interview
[31:16] uh tomorrow morning with the the man
[31:18] that hired me my boss's boss or what was
[31:20] my manager's boss uh the man that's over
[31:23] that's in charge of the entire new build
[31:25] section supposed to have I guess what
[31:27] you consider an exit interview tomorrow
[31:29] morning. I just pray that that you'd
[31:31] help me pray with that. It's go
[31:32] everything will go okay and everything
[31:34] will be fine and u I don't know what to
[31:37] expect or what's going to happen but uh
[31:39] the Lord has it all in control and
[31:41] whatever his perfect will is.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want. So, praise the
[31:45] Lord. So, God bless you. Appreciate your
[31:48] prayers for that. Amen. Does anyone have
[31:50] a testimony or anything on your heart
[31:51] today?
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] Praise the Lord. If not, we'll just
[31:57] stand to our feet and we'll just uh
[32:00] we'll go right to the scripture. Amen.
[32:03] We'll go over again to Ephesians chapter
[32:05] 4. Amen. We'll start back Ephesians
[32:08] chapter 4 instead of Romans uh this
[32:11] time. We're in adoption still, but uh
[32:14] got a few more to go,
[32:17] the Lord willing. Amen. But uh this
[32:20] would be
[32:22] adoption part 35, five-fold ministry
[32:25] part eight I believe. But this is the
[32:28] part of of evangelists. We went through
[32:31] apostles. Uh we went through prophets
[32:34] few before we went on our trip and last
[32:36] week we finished up on prophets. So the
[32:39] next is going to be evangelists. Amen.
[32:42] So adoption part 35. This will be
[32:45] fivefold ministry part 8 and the
[32:47] subtitle is evangelism or evangelists.
[32:50] Amen. So Ephesians chapter 4, we're
[32:54] going to uh begin reading with chapter
[32:57] uh 10 or verse 10, excuse me, chapter 4
[33:01] verse 10. And just trust the Lord bless
[33:04] it today. And let's just bow our heads
[33:06] for prayer for good one more time before
[33:07] we read the word. Father God, very
[33:10] thankful Lord Jesus again of this
[33:11] precious word. Thank you Lord for
[33:14] blessing us with it Lord and giving it
[33:15] to us that we can open up at any time
[33:18] Lord and read these words and not just
[33:21] read the words but expect those words to
[33:24] come off those pages and into our hearts
[33:26] and into our lives Lord and make a
[33:29] difference to us Lord and and reveal
[33:31] that word to us that we don't live just
[33:34] a regular normal life Lord we we live a
[33:37] we live a life that's of revelation we
[33:40] live a revelated life we live a life of
[33:43] the Holy Spirit, Lord, walking close to
[33:46] you, walking with you, you walking in
[33:48] us, Lord, leading us, guiding us,
[33:50] showing us. And Lord, as this word comes
[33:53] alive to us, Lord, it means to us, Lord,
[33:56] what you intended it to be, God, when
[33:59] you had men moved of the Holy Ghost to
[34:01] write it, Lord, let it live in us, Lord.
[34:04] Let it come alive even now, Father, to
[34:07] each one of us as we commit it into your
[34:09] hands. May you bless it now, Lord. for
[34:12] the reading of your word, Lord, your
[34:13] ministry, God. May you speak, Lord,
[34:16] through these lips, Lord. May we hear,
[34:18] God, what you would have for us to hear
[34:20] today. May you draw us closer to you by
[34:22] it, Lord, when we commit it into your
[34:24] hands. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:26] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[34:29] Amen. Ephesians chapter 4, we're going
[34:32] to begin reading with verse 10.
[34:35] He that descended is also the same uh
[34:38] the same also ascended far up above all
[34:40] heavens that he might fill all things.
[34:42] He gave some apostles and some prophets
[34:46] and some evangelists and some pastors
[34:49] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[34:52] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[34:55] for the edifying of the body of Christ,
[34:57] till we all come in the unity of the
[35:00] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[35:02] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[35:05] of the stature of the fullness of
[35:08] Christ. You can be seated if you'd like.
[35:11] Amen. Now again, as we said, I want to
[35:15] start on uh evangelism or evangelists
[35:17] today. Amen. And um get to the the third
[35:21] part because like I said, we said
[35:23] before, we're just kind of try to follow
[35:26] the pattern that was given here in the
[35:28] 11th verse where said apostles,
[35:29] prophets, and evangelists. So now we get
[35:32] the third of the five-fold ministry, the
[35:34] third part uh of this ministry, which is
[35:37] evangelism. Anybody remember uh which
[35:40] one of these five-fold is the
[35:41] evangelist? You can just hold it up if
[35:44] you remember. You don't have to say it
[35:46] out loud, but if you remember which one
[35:48] the evang is the evangelist.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's the evangelist right
[35:53] there. I know none of us seem to
[35:55] participate very well when we have you
[35:57] participate. So, but evangelist, that's
[36:00] the evangelist. Amen. Remember the
[36:02] prophet. Amen. And the apostle, the
[36:05] teacher, and the evangelist. and the
[36:07] pastor. Amen. That's how brother That's
[36:10] how brother I' i've seen it online
[36:11] before on Facebook and it's wrong. When
[36:14] I've seen it on Facebook, it's been
[36:15] wrong. And by message believers, but I'm
[36:19] telling you what brother Green told me,
[36:22] brother Brandham told him. So, I'll take
[36:25] that. Uh, amen. Uh, so just remember
[36:29] that is the prophet, thus sayeth the
[36:31] Lord. Uh, the apostle, the first one
[36:33] that goes in, Amen, is the apostle. the
[36:36] uh the teacher is the one who can't move
[36:38] unless the others move. Remember this
[36:40] teacher, he's got to have the others go
[36:42] in. The apostle was set it up in the
[36:44] evangelist uh to bring conviction. Uh
[36:46] that teacher can't move unless the
[36:48] others come in there. But when the
[36:49] others are involved, the teacher can
[36:51] move freely. Amen. Remember the pastor,
[36:54] the evangelist, of course, he can go and
[36:56] do whatever, you know, he's just free to
[36:58] do and go about and be led by whatever
[37:00] the Lord wants to lead him to. and the
[37:02] pastor brings them all together to give
[37:03] a weapon to be to fight the enemy with.
[37:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, I want to go
[37:08] over now uh to uh Acts Acts chapter uh 8
[37:14] and we want to begin our reading there.
[37:18] But I want to look at evangelism just
[37:20] for a little bit. Evangelism has always
[37:23] been, but it wasn't as we would say as
[37:27] prevalent necessarily
[37:29] um uh until the 20th century. When the
[37:33] 20th century rolled over, of course,
[37:35] when uh well, even before that, but uh
[37:38] as the as the 20th century rolled over,
[37:41] it became more and more prevalent. Uh as
[37:44] you noticed uh we went from a missionary
[37:47] age, remember the Philadelphia age was
[37:49] the missionary age. You remember that uh
[37:51] apostles a missionary age apostle is a
[37:54] missionary. That missionary age was the
[37:57] Philadelphia age the the age of the open
[37:59] door and they came across into North
[38:02] America and started establishing North
[38:04] America. The the Europeans did uh the
[38:08] Native Americans were here of course and
[38:10] Spanish were here and all such into
[38:12] Central America and South America. But
[38:14] as Europeans started coming over, uh
[38:17] they came they came over to try to uh
[38:20] find a new place to to live, a new place
[38:22] to worship, a place they can go that
[38:24] they could have freedom of worship. That
[38:26] they weren't oppressed by the
[38:27] government. They weren't pressed down by
[38:29] the government to be forced to worship
[38:31] how they wanted them to because remember
[38:33] they had just shortly before that come
[38:35] through the dark ages where if they
[38:37] didn't do it the way they told them they
[38:38] did it, they would do it. Then they
[38:40] killed them. They martyed him in in all
[38:43] kind of different ways. If you ever read
[38:44] the Fox book of martyrs, uh all all the
[38:47] ways that they killed him and and
[38:48] martyed him for not worshiping, not
[38:52] worshiping what the government said they
[38:54] should and and of course because we had
[38:56] church and state together with the
[38:58] government and the Catholic Church were
[39:00] joined together at the hip. So they were
[39:02] one together. uh that that that beast
[39:06] that was there uh that was joined
[39:08] together, they were one so that they
[39:11] could enforce. So the the church, yeah,
[39:13] it was a part of the enforcement, but
[39:15] remember the [snorts] church kind of
[39:16] stayed uh back a little bit. Uh they
[39:20] they cling to it, but they they let the
[39:23] they let the government kind of like
[39:25] when Jesus was crucified,
[39:28] the Jews were there screaming and
[39:29] yelling, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" But
[39:32] they turned him over to the government
[39:34] to be to actually for punishment. Amen.
[39:37] They didn't actually say they didn't do
[39:39] it. They they're the ones that put him
[39:40] there. But they relied on the
[39:42] government. Amen. They called on the
[39:44] Roman government. They took Jesus to uh
[39:47] uh to Pilate. Amen. To to be to be
[39:50] sentenced and to be and to be crucified.
[39:53] They didn't do it. Amen. You notice the
[39:56] same in the Catholic Church. uh uh they
[39:59] would they would be instrumental in
[40:01] that. But remember it was the government
[40:03] that was the ones that that would
[40:06] exercise that punishment a lot. So they
[40:08] would bring that judgment down and would
[40:11] be exercised on the people and then the
[40:14] people would be martyed and killed in
[40:15] all kinds of ways and uh then it became
[40:18] so rampant that people would just come
[40:20] off the streets uh Catholic and call
[40:23] somebody a heretic and just burn them at
[40:25] the stake uh and and things like that.
[40:27] And uh we saw that even when it came
[40:30] over here in the uh in Salem,
[40:32] Massachusetts and uh the the Salem witch
[40:35] trials and all that happened up there
[40:37] did the same thing up there. Amen.
[40:39] People just come and they considered
[40:41] somebody a witch, so they just deemed
[40:43] them a witch and they threw them and uh
[40:46] burn them at the stake or whatever they
[40:47] would do, they they would kill them.
[40:49] Amen. And so when they come here for
[40:51] freedom, once they started establishing
[40:54] this uh this colonist country uh
[40:57] European uh settlement, when the
[41:00] European settlement started to settle,
[41:02] then then there was uh there was more
[41:05] evangelism that went on. Amen. It was
[41:07] just uh it wasn't necessarily going
[41:10] overseas or establishing anything new.
[41:12] They had once they got all the apost the
[41:14] apostilizing done and churches started
[41:18] getting set up uh the the evangelist
[41:21] started breaking out more and more going
[41:23] around evangelizing to those churches
[41:25] that had been established evangelizing
[41:28] to those people that needed to hear the
[41:30] word. Now remember as we said before an
[41:33] evangelist isn't someone that uh that uh
[41:37] that necessarily uh preaches doctrine.
[41:40] It's it's not an evangelist calling to
[41:44] teach doctrine to a congregation. It's
[41:47] not an evangelist position to come in
[41:49] off the uh off the street or from
[41:51] another church to come into a to a
[41:53] church as a visiting minister evangelist
[41:57] uh and try to teach that congregation
[41:59] doctrine. It It's not an evangelist's
[42:02] position to do that. Amen. He's he he he
[42:05] he preaches uh hellfire and brimstone.
[42:10] He preaches uh to bring conviction and
[42:15] uh uh uh something that would stir the
[42:18] people. See, he he he brings people uh
[42:22] an evangelist is to preach in to preach
[42:24] people into repentance uh conviction and
[42:27] repentance. That's that's a lot of what
[42:29] an evangelist does more so you say than
[42:32] u any word can do it any any preaching
[42:35] of a word can do it but that's more of
[42:37] an evangelist call an evangelist call
[42:40] when he ministers uh his ministry is to
[42:43] be uh just to lay the hide open on the
[42:46] people uh to to bring a like I said a
[42:50] hellfire and brimstone as they used to
[42:52] say message to people to bring
[42:53] conviction to bring repentance to bring
[42:57] people to a place that they uh would
[43:00] surrender their lives to God more so
[43:02] that that convictive um uh ministry.
[43:05] See, a teacher is just supposed to teach
[43:07] people and a pastor supposed to help uh
[43:10] help with the people, which we'll get to
[43:12] uh that in a couple weeks uh down the
[43:15] road. But it's is so you see the
[43:18] uniqueness of each one of these uh uh uh
[43:22] callings the uniqueness of each one of
[43:24] these positions that that different
[43:27] people that's why God calls different
[43:29] people for different reasons. That's why
[43:32] brother Random talks about that uh you
[43:34] know if the Lord's called you to a
[43:36] position you stay that way. I think we
[43:38] read that quote maybe last week or uh
[43:40] before we left uh to stay in that
[43:43] position. God's called you to a position
[43:45] for a reason, for a purpose. Uh and and
[43:49] that that man's going to have that
[43:51] nature. He's going to have that uh
[43:53] ability. He's going to have that in him
[43:55] to bring and to do. See, uh it it's not
[43:59] in everybody to bring like a fiery
[44:02] evangelistic message. It it's not in
[44:05] everybody to be able to to stand week
[44:07] after week and pastor a group of people.
[44:10] It's not in everybody to come and to
[44:12] teach and to try to bring uh a more
[44:15] greater deeper understanding maybe of
[44:18] the scripture to teach like a teacher
[44:20] would do or to or to bring it like a
[44:22] prophet or see they're all that that's
[44:25] why they're all separate and different
[44:26] the way they are the way the evangelist
[44:29] uh and each one that God has called is.
[44:34] Amen. So as we came more over in this
[44:37] country
[44:38] uh from from missionary apostle work
[44:42] into evangelism because once the and
[44:45] that's uh from what I see is more or
[44:48] less what is going on around the world
[44:51] now not just in our country but as this
[44:54] message has spread around the world uh
[44:58] dares I say according to the scripture
[45:00] to the four corners of the earth. Amen.
[45:03] uh uh Matthew 24, I believe it says when
[45:07] uh uh you'll hear wars and rumors of
[45:10] wars and all these things happen and but
[45:12] yet the the end is not yet. Amen. Isn't
[45:15] that what it says? But then it says uh
[45:18] but then all these other things will
[45:19] begin to unfold but at the end Jesus
[45:22] said he said when this the gospel has
[45:26] been preached in all the earth to every
[45:28] creature then the end will come. And
[45:32] saints, I can't help but believe that
[45:34] we're at that point right now.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; If we believe that we're at the end and
[45:39] we believe we're truly at the end of the
[45:41] end, then we've got to realize that
[45:44] we're to that place. See, um we got our
[45:48] precious brother Null and Sister Shirley
[45:50] going over to uh to uh India in the next
[45:52] this coming week and um uh they're going
[45:56] over to do apostle work. But the apostle
[45:59] work really uh there and where they go
[46:02] is mostly done. Uh they've got those
[46:05] churches established. They've got those
[46:07] works established. In fact, some of
[46:09] those works already have people coming
[46:12] out of them to start other works. And
[46:15] see that's what an apostle, remember we
[46:16] talked about apostle, that's what he
[46:18] does. There's already a lot of those
[46:19] works has had works come off of those
[46:21] works and then works off of those works.
[46:24] So now they've got to the place that um
[46:27] most of what goes on outside of some
[46:29] people that still go over there like
[46:31] brother Nolan, they they more or less
[46:34] what they try to do now is to help them
[46:37] with uh what they have in their country
[46:40] so far as uh do you need uh fresh water?
[46:44] Do you need a a a place to worship? Do
[46:48] you do you uh a church building? Or did
[46:51] did a storm come tear your roof off or
[46:53] something? That's that's kind of more or
[46:55] less an apostles's work that they're
[46:57] doing now. Uh a deacon does that inside
[47:01] the church. But sometimes it takes uh
[47:03] someone from overseas or someone that
[47:05] maybe is a little more uh able to help
[47:08] than themselves to come and do that. And
[47:11] brother the church that brother Nol and
[47:13] sister Shirley go to, they are steeped
[47:15] in that. They've been known for that uh
[47:18] around the around the country for being
[47:21] that church. They have a meeting every
[47:22] August, a missionary meeting. And uh the
[47:26] purpose is that they the all that they
[47:28] do to raise finances for that. All that
[47:31] money goes over to help those that are
[47:33] overseas that are less fortunate that
[47:35] can't help for themselves. Amen. So
[47:38] that's what uh that's what Nolan Shirley
[47:41] will do. Now that that process has
[47:43] become a lot easier now because you
[47:45] don't have to take dollar and hand to go
[47:47] hand to them to fix a roof on their
[47:49] church. You just push a button on a
[47:51] phone or a computer and the money's in
[47:53] their account in a matter of a second uh
[47:57] or seconds or I've never done one
[47:58] overseas but u I know when someone has
[48:02] zelled me money into my account it's
[48:04] like it's in there within seconds. So uh
[48:07] a lot of that just kind of seems to not
[48:10] it isn't fulfilling the same capacity as
[48:13] it used to. So now even there they've
[48:17] got brothers that are going out and
[48:19] they're ministering. They're
[48:20] evangelizing. Amen. At other churches,
[48:22] other places where they get invited,
[48:24] they're evangelizing. They're
[48:26] evangelizing in other countries all over
[48:28] the world. It's gotten to the place that
[48:30] that's it. It's it's so saturated. I
[48:32] mean, my goodness, we've got what, a
[48:34] dozen churches in this little town of
[48:36] Tucson, Arizona. There's a dozen message
[48:40] churches or so now, something like that.
[48:42] Used to be more than that, but I think
[48:44] there's like 12. uh and you think, well
[48:48] then then we should have enough here
[48:50] that's been established uh that others
[48:53] could go and uh evangelize and minister
[48:55] around and uh unfortunately in Tucson
[48:58] that doesn't happen. Uh I don't know of
[49:00] it anyway. I don't know usually the the
[49:05] meetings that I hear of which is very
[49:06] seldom. Nobody really ever talks to me
[49:08] anymore but but God and that's who I
[49:11] care about the most. The Lord continues
[49:13] to talk to me. But um uh from what I
[49:17] hear, uh they're they're getting people
[49:19] from overseas or or from other parts of
[49:22] the country that to come in and
[49:24] minister. Not not another evangelist
[49:27] from in town. Amen. I I don't know of
[49:31] any. We don't have any.
[49:34] They just just it's just hard to find
[49:36] them. And then
[49:38] the some that may exist may either just
[49:41] not want to come or I don't trust them
[49:44] to come.
[49:45] uh because of what I know is preached.
[49:47] So uh you got to be very careful. So a
[49:50] lot of the ministers and practically all
[49:52] the ministers we have here are from
[49:54] around the country too.
[49:57] I don't know why shouldn't be that way.
[50:00] There should be evangelist ministers. We
[50:02] don't have any here to send out but
[50:04] there's evangelists all over the place
[50:07] to go and evangelize to continue to get
[50:10] people stirred up. Now, I think a lot of
[50:12] the evangelism
[50:14] uh that used to be to bring people again
[50:17] under conviction and repentance um has
[50:21] has waned itself into the position to
[50:24] where a lot of people now uh are are
[50:26] just established people that uh that are
[50:30] just look for a rededication.
[50:33] Uh I I every once in a while I see uh
[50:38] churches we've had maybe here but other
[50:41] places where uh someone from off the
[50:43] street or someone who knew nothing about
[50:45] it or someone who heard from somebody
[50:47] about the message or something and came
[50:49] to a church uh and and come to the Lord
[50:52] and get saved and filled with the Holy
[50:53] Ghost and baptized and that that just
[50:56] doesn't happen that much anymore. Not in
[50:58] this country. It just it it's just not
[51:00] prevalent anymore. Um we have a lot of
[51:03] places where uh uh a lot of the
[51:07] established people receive u evangelism
[51:11] but we all still need evangelism. We all
[51:13] still need to be evangelized uh because
[51:16] in fact we all we still all need the
[51:18] five-fold ministry I believe because
[51:21] brother Brandham said you know it it
[51:23] should continue on until the coming of
[51:25] the Lord. So, uh, we're just waiting at
[51:28] that time, expecting the Lord to do that
[51:30] at any time. But that's what the
[51:32] evangelism part of it. A lot of these a
[51:36] lot of these gifts have have, uh, don't
[51:39] fulfill the same capacity or or
[51:43] accomplish the same positions as they
[51:45] used to. Amen. And uh it's just a
[51:48] progression of time as we're getting to
[51:50] this end, as we're coming to the place
[51:53] to end this. Uh you know, if if we're
[51:56] looking for if we're looking for the
[51:58] coming of the let's just say
[52:00] hypothetically, we're looking for well,
[52:02] this is not hypothetical. We are looking
[52:04] for the coming of the Lord this next
[52:06] week.
[52:08] If we're looking for the coming of the
[52:09] Lord this next week, today, tomorrow,
[52:11] this next week, if we're looking for the
[52:13] coming of the Lord and really believe
[52:15] that he's going to be coming any time
[52:17] now, do we really believe that?
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; If we really believe that, then what
[52:23] then where do we think we're we are?
[52:26] &gt;&gt; If if the Lord's coming tomorrow, he's
[52:28] not looking to establish another church
[52:31] in China today.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; What would be the point? you got 12
[52:37] hours and that might be one person there
[52:39] or something that needs God will just
[52:41] God will send somebody to move on that
[52:43] person or to talk to that person or what
[52:45] if it's just one person there or
[52:47] something like that. If if we truly
[52:50] believe he's coming uh uh soon in the if
[52:54] we believe he's coming tomorrow,
[52:56] uh what would be the point of of of
[52:59] doing the things that we've known of all
[53:01] these years
[53:03] as far as missionary work and evangelism
[53:07] work and a a lot of the things that we
[53:10] trust and we know how they have operated
[53:13] all these years. They don't they don't
[53:16] exactly operate the same way anymore.
[53:19] Amen. Now, I enjoy having another
[53:22] minister come in. I I I I love I to have
[53:26] another evangelist or something come and
[53:30] and minister that gospel and to to set
[53:33] the place on fire. And um I remember
[53:36] when when we first got this place,
[53:39] Brother Benny Perry was here. Uh a black
[53:42] brother from South Carolina.
[53:45] I think they come to the ministers
[53:47] meeting or something like that. And he I
[53:48] invited him. He came down and spoke for
[53:50] us on a Wednesday night. And uh he it
[53:54] was just it was like an evangelism
[53:56] service. And it it was great. We enjoyed
[53:59] it. you know, u a lot of times you
[54:02] think, I I wish we have more of those. U
[54:07] but it's like it's like being in the
[54:09] desert. In the desert, you look out and
[54:12] you say, "Oh man, it's beautiful to look
[54:14] at the rain. It's falling. I love it,
[54:17] man. The rain is just so beautiful." But
[54:19] when you're in Seattle, you look at it
[54:20] and say, "Oh my gosh, it's raining
[54:22] again." Or if you're in you're in a
[54:25] place it rains all the time, say, "Can
[54:26] we just have a minute or two of
[54:28] sunshine, please?"
[54:30] Amen. It's the [snorts] same way. Amen.
[54:33] If all you get is if all you get is
[54:35] continuing evangelism, you'd be like,
[54:38] "Can the sun come out some sometime,
[54:40] please? Uh, I need some teaching. I need
[54:43] some pastoring. I need Amen." And that
[54:45] the point of the five-fold ministry.
[54:47] Amen. which brings me to the
[54:50] understanding that uh you all would
[54:53] probably get sick of me, which I fully
[54:56] understand, but trust me, we we I try by
[55:00] the grace of God to have everybody that
[55:02] the Lord puts in our path to come and
[55:04] and minister for us that I trust, that I
[55:07] know preaches the truth,
[55:09] that preaches the word. Amen. So, let me
[55:12] read this quote to you as we continue
[55:14] on. I want to get over to Acts now. Look
[55:17] at some scriptural examples. As the
[55:19] church was birthed, it birthed forth uh
[55:22] as we saw in apostles, as we saw in
[55:24] prophets, we'll see in evangelism. It
[55:27] birthed forth. Amen. But look what
[55:29] brother Ram said. He said, "Now God
[55:30] doesn't God God doesn't call a man to
[55:32] judge without first warning him.
[55:33] [clears throat] The evangelist is a
[55:36] special man.
[55:38] He's a man that's burning like a
[55:40] fireball. He runs into a city and
[55:43] preaches his me message and then gets
[55:47] out and goes somewhere else. He comes
[55:50] in, lights a place on fire and hits the
[55:53] road. An evangelist. That's what brother
[55:55] Brandham called it. A special man, which
[55:59] if you go look at this, he calls every
[56:01] office a special man, a special calling,
[56:04] a special person. But you see how he
[56:07] identifies an evangelist. A fireball
[56:11] runs into a church, sets the church on
[56:13] fire, and hits the road. Amen. Hides,
[56:17] skins him alive, and then hits the road.
[56:20] And then it's up to the then the pastor
[56:22] comes and helps and smooths things over.
[56:24] And you see kind of that situation in
[56:27] brother Brandham's ministry. Like we
[56:28] said before, I believe he fulfilled all
[56:30] the positions, but every one of them as
[56:33] a word prophet. But you see, he can do
[56:36] that in one service.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; It's not a calling of evangelists to do
[56:40] that. Brother Brand, you remember the
[56:41] Bible said or the uh brother Bram said,
[56:44] I think I actually got it in a quote
[56:45] here. He talks about um that the Lord
[56:50] told him to be an to do the work of an
[56:52] evangelist. Didn't call him an
[56:53] evangelist, but did the work of an
[56:55] evangelist. And that's what he did. But
[56:56] then when it come to the end, you know,
[56:59] then he would do the smoothing over and
[57:01] put take the bomb and smooth things over
[57:04] and Amen. You you feel like, how can I
[57:06] have been so filleted and feel so good?
[57:10] How could I have been skinned alive
[57:12] through this message and feel so good at
[57:14] the end? It's a gift. It's just a gift
[57:17] of God. It's a calling that God put in
[57:19] there to be able to do that. See, but he
[57:22] but an evangelist, he doesn't do that.
[57:24] He just comes, skins him alive and
[57:25] leaves. Amen. That's amen. What it's to
[57:28] bring him under conviction to bring him
[57:31] to a place of repentance. Amen. That's
[57:34] what that's uh that's the main job of an
[57:36] evangelist in the world falling apart.
[57:38] He said evangelism evangelism is a net
[57:42] that goes forth. Jesus said cast into
[57:46] the sea. And when he brought forth it
[57:49] and brought forth the net, it had
[57:51] turtles, terrapens, snakes, frogs, and
[57:55] everything else in it. But remember,
[57:58] they was that from the start. But there
[58:00] were fish. He says there were fish in
[58:03] there, too. Amen. But the evangelism, it
[58:07] isn't his job to figure out who's fish.
[58:10] As he continues on, he said, "But
[58:13] remember, there was that from the start.
[58:15] There was fish in there, too. But it's
[58:17] just our business, he says, to sane. You
[58:20] know what sing is? Anybody know what
[58:22] sainting is? Singing is when you uh
[58:26] basically when you take uh two poles or
[58:28] something and put a net between them. Uh
[58:31] you can do it by yourself. You can do it
[58:33] between like two boats. Uh, and I've
[58:36] I've sained a creek before when you take
[58:38] two sticks and you uh you tie a net to
[58:42] the sticks and and you just take that
[58:45] net and you go through and you go
[58:47] through the creek and you just start
[58:49] keeping your net in the water and you
[58:51] just jab corners and you move and you
[58:53] get little spaces where you think fish
[58:55] are hiding and you try to poke those and
[58:57] the fish turns and runs into the net.
[58:59] you build a net up, you got fish or
[59:01] crawad or salamander or whatever it is.
[59:04] But that's what sing is. You can do it
[59:06] between boats. You take take a stick and
[59:08] a big net and you can go on a boat and
[59:10] just sane right through. Uh a lot of
[59:13] times that's what they do for like
[59:15] shrimp and stuff. You've seen a big
[59:17] shrimp boat with a net on it. They'll
[59:18] put that net down and they'll troll on
[59:20] the sides and they'll troll along and
[59:22] they'll just skip up scoop skim up
[59:24] whatever they get and they pull it up
[59:25] and there they are. That's s. So if you
[59:30] know when he talks about casting the
[59:31] net, when he says sane, that's what he's
[59:34] talking about. Not common sense or not
[59:36] being insane, but saining is just going
[59:39] for fish. And you get all kinds of
[59:41] things. Amen. Especially if you're like
[59:44] in the ocean or somewhere, you get a
[59:46] license plate or a a a bottle or there's
[59:50] no telling what you might get.
[59:52] But what the point is, it's just a the
[59:55] it's just the ministry's business to
[59:58] sing.
[59:59] It's God's business to say whether they
[1:00:02] are a fish or not. And that's God's
[1:00:04] business. It's not our business to say
[1:00:07] someone's a fish or a croad or a
[1:00:09] salamander or a a crocodile or a turtle
[1:00:12] or It's not our business to say that's
[1:00:14] God's business. God's business
[1:00:17] determines whether they are a sheep or a
[1:00:19] goat. Amen. whether they're a turtle or
[1:00:22] a fish. It's God's that's God's
[1:00:24] business. God's business to say who is a
[1:00:27] fish or not. Amen. Why wouldn't them? He
[1:00:30] said if they uh if they was taken just
[1:00:33] as far into the kingdom of God, them
[1:00:35] 30,000 as Paul's one, he would have come
[1:00:38] back. He talked about uh he's talking
[1:00:40] about uh Billy Graham and getting 30,000
[1:00:44] to come at one time. And uh he come back
[1:00:47] and can't find one convert. And he said
[1:00:49] Paul would make one and come back and
[1:00:50] got 30,000. Got 30,000 converts from the
[1:00:54] one and the other couldn't find one from
[1:00:57] the 30,000. So that's what brother Bam's
[1:00:59] talking about in evangelism.
[1:01:02] And one of the most popular famous
[1:01:05] evangelists that we know of is Billy
[1:01:08] Graham in this country. In this country
[1:01:10] probably around the world even. I I know
[1:01:12] he's known around the world. Billy
[1:01:14] Graham is one of the greatest well-known
[1:01:17] evangelists even though many people have
[1:01:21] called him uh the pastor to our nation.
[1:01:27] See now now again a misunderstanding.
[1:01:29] He's either a pastor or he's an
[1:01:30] evangelist. To me, you're not both.
[1:01:34] In fact, I can show you where brother
[1:01:35] Brandham said not to do both. You he's a
[1:01:38] pastor evangelist. But see, that's just
[1:01:40] people don't understand that. But the
[1:01:42] man was an evangelist to his bone. He
[1:01:44] was an evangelist. He did everything to
[1:01:46] evangelize. Amen. To bring people under
[1:01:49] conviction and repentance. And I've been
[1:01:51] I went to Billy Graham meetings and I
[1:01:53] know and he's he held to that word. He
[1:01:56] preached the word, saints. He preached
[1:01:59] it as far and as much as he possibly
[1:02:01] could. Amen. To the point that he even
[1:02:04] riled up trinitarians by calling Jesus
[1:02:07] the almighty God.
[1:02:09] Trinitarians got mad at him for saying
[1:02:12] that he was the almighty God. And Billy
[1:02:14] Graham said, "I didn't say it. THAT'S
[1:02:16] WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS." But of course,
[1:02:18] then they still held on to their
[1:02:20] trinitarianism. But they came against
[1:02:22] him for preaching that. But the man
[1:02:25] preached the word. I we went to some of
[1:02:28] his meetings. I went with a friend of
[1:02:29] mine in North Carolina and I went with
[1:02:31] some brothers from our church. I went to
[1:02:33] two or three meetings of his in North
[1:02:35] Carolina and uh I tell you what, he laid
[1:02:37] right on that truth. He laid right on
[1:02:39] that word. Now, let's go to Acts. As I
[1:02:41] had you turn a minute ago, Acts chapter
[1:02:43] 8
[1:02:47] and let's look at an evangelist.
[1:02:50] In Acts chapter 6,
[1:02:53] it had come to the people's attention
[1:02:55] that um the the disciples attention that
[1:02:59] the the people were being neglected.
[1:03:01] They specifically mentioned in the
[1:03:03] scripture widows, but the people were
[1:03:05] being neglected in the daily
[1:03:07] ministration. This is before this is
[1:03:10] when uh society used to work properly.
[1:03:14] This is before everybody became fully
[1:03:17] dependent on the government for their
[1:03:19] good for for their welfare. Uh people
[1:03:23] used to have a church and people that
[1:03:26] came to that church that church took
[1:03:28] care of those people. You had deacons
[1:03:31] and trustees and you had people that
[1:03:32] looked out of the welfare and the daily
[1:03:34] ministration and things like that. If
[1:03:36] they didn't go to the government, they
[1:03:38] went to the church. When [snorts] they
[1:03:40] saw that the as it says in the sixth
[1:03:42] chapter that the widows were being
[1:03:44] neglected, they didn't go to the
[1:03:46] government to say, "Hey, why don't you
[1:03:48] give our widows some money?" No, they
[1:03:51] went to the church cuz that's the way
[1:03:52] it's supposed to be. That's the way it's
[1:03:55] still supposed to be. But it's not and
[1:03:57] not going to be that way. Not in this
[1:04:00] cosmos anyway.
[1:04:02] uh but everybody we all become it's all
[1:04:04] all the dependencies on the government
[1:04:06] now everybody depends on everything the
[1:04:08] government's gives money so as this
[1:04:10] neglect was taking place they said we
[1:04:13] don't have time to do all this and to
[1:04:15] give ourselves to the word so find you
[1:04:17] some men and they found some men and he
[1:04:20] laid hands on them and sent them forth
[1:04:22] to do the administration deacon uh
[1:04:26] evangelism uh Stephen was one of them
[1:04:29] you know Stephen very well Steven was a
[1:04:31] man full of the Holy Ghost and m
[1:04:33] miracles and wonders done and they
[1:04:35] stoned him to death. Saul who became
[1:04:38] Paul was there consenting holding the
[1:04:40] coats of those that were throwing the
[1:04:42] stones that had him killed. They took
[1:04:44] they took Steven off and buried him.
[1:04:46] Amen. But another man that was picked at
[1:04:48] the exact same time's name was
[1:04:51] Philillip. And Philip was also a man of
[1:04:54] the Holy Ghost, a man of great works and
[1:04:57] miracles that happened in his life.
[1:04:59] Let's look at chapter eight uh excuse me
[1:05:01] eight
[1:05:03] look [clears throat] here
[1:05:05] after Stephen's death pe then Philip
[1:05:08] fifth verse now then Philillip went down
[1:05:11] to the city of Samaria and preached
[1:05:14] Christ unto them preached Christ and the
[1:05:18] people with one accord gave heed unto
[1:05:21] those things which Philip spake hearing
[1:05:24] the preaching of the word and seeing the
[1:05:28] miracles which he did. Amen. Now,
[1:05:32] Philillip, a man of the Holy Ghost, had
[1:05:35] hands laid on him, a deacon, an
[1:05:38] evangelist going forth because here he's
[1:05:40] considered an evangelist going around uh
[1:05:43] ministering to the churches. He goes
[1:05:45] around and they hear the word and they
[1:05:47] fall in repentance. They come to a place
[1:05:50] of repentance, hearing the word and
[1:05:52] seeing miracles. For unclean spirits
[1:05:56] crying with loud voice came out of many
[1:05:59] that were possessed with them. And many
[1:06:02] taken with Pauly and that were lame were
[1:06:05] healed.
[1:06:08] And there were uh there was great joy in
[1:06:11] that city.
[1:06:13] But there was a certain man called
[1:06:14] Simon, which before time in the same
[1:06:16] city used sorcery, and bewitched the
[1:06:20] people of Samaria, giving out that
[1:06:22] himself was a great one, to whom they
[1:06:26] all gave heed from the least to the
[1:06:28] greatest, saying, "This man is a great
[1:06:31] power of God."
[1:06:33] misconstring
[1:06:35] the difference between the ministering
[1:06:38] of God and the ministry of sorcery
[1:06:42] demand de demonic. Amen. The people
[1:06:46] confusing the two, conflating the two.
[1:06:49] Amen. Thinking and calling him a great
[1:06:52] man of God when all he did was was u uh
[1:06:58] convinced him by sorcery.
[1:07:01] Look at this now.
[1:07:03] And to him they had regard because that
[1:07:06] of a long time he had bewitched them
[1:07:08] with sorceries. But when they believed
[1:07:11] Philillip's preaching the things
[1:07:13] concerning the kingdom of God in the
[1:07:15] name of Jesus Christ, THEY WERE BAPTIZED
[1:07:18] BOTH men and women. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:21] Why? Because they heard his preaching.
[1:07:24] Amen. Yes, miracles were done and that
[1:07:27] miracles do draw people. But it's the
[1:07:29] preaching that brings people to
[1:07:30] repentance.
[1:07:32] Miracles don't bring people to
[1:07:33] repentance. It brings people to you know
[1:07:36] to amazement and want to be a part of a
[1:07:39] group. But if you want you want to tr
[1:07:41] see a true repentance it came by the
[1:07:44] word. Amen. And as he brought the word
[1:07:47] they came to repentance and were
[1:07:49] baptized both men men and women. And
[1:07:53] we'll see how they were baptized. Then
[1:07:56] Simon himself beloved uh believed also.
[1:07:59] And when he was baptized, he continued
[1:08:01] with Philip and wondered, beholding the
[1:08:03] miracles and signs that were done. Now
[1:08:05] when the apostles which were at
[1:08:06] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[1:08:08] received the word of God, they sent unto
[1:08:10] them Peter and John. Now they're sending
[1:08:12] Peter and John up there to establish
[1:08:15] after Philip had been there. And when
[1:08:18] they were come down, prayed with them,
[1:08:21] prayed for them that they might receive
[1:08:23] the Holy Ghost. For as yet he, the Holy
[1:08:27] Ghost, was fallen upon none of them.
[1:08:30] Only they were baptized how?
[1:08:33] In the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:08:36] Not in the name of Father, Son, and Holy
[1:08:39] Ghost. But they were baptized after
[1:08:41] having come out from the upper room
[1:08:44] being filled with the HOLY GHOST. THEY
[1:08:46] WERE ALL BAPTIZED IN the name of the
[1:08:48] Lord Jesus.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. AND BECAUSE THEY WERE
[1:08:53] BAPTIZED in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:08:55] they laid their hands on them and they
[1:08:58] received the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:01] Praise the Lord. That's how it's done.
[1:09:03] That's the scriptural way. No matter
[1:09:06] what a denomination tells you, no matter
[1:09:08] what some of preacher, somebody else
[1:09:10] might say, that's the scriptural
[1:09:12] prescription of how a person receives
[1:09:14] the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:09:17] Then they receive the Holy Ghost. But
[1:09:19] look at this. Phillip now. Philillip
[1:09:23] let's go down to the 26th verse. Now a
[1:09:27] little dust up happens with Simon and
[1:09:29] all his sorcery and thing and Philip had
[1:09:32] to set him straight. In fact, Philip the
[1:09:34] evangelist, Philip told him said your
[1:09:37] sorceries die with you. Um he was pretty
[1:09:41] straight blunt [snorts] although Simon
[1:09:43] came out and said pray for me. I don't
[1:09:45] want to be like this. Pray for me. So
[1:09:47] but now Philillip this great evangelist
[1:09:49] now what's he doing? And the angel of
[1:09:50] the Lord
[1:09:53] and the angel of the Lord to one of the
[1:09:55] most great things happened scripturally.
[1:09:57] Look at this. And the angel of the Lord
[1:09:59] spake unto Philillip saying, "Arise and
[1:10:02] go towards the south unto the way that
[1:10:04] goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gazel,
[1:10:06] which is desert.
[1:10:08] And he arose and went, and behold, a man
[1:10:10] of Ethiopia, a unic of a great authority
[1:10:13] under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians,
[1:10:16] who had the charge of all her treasure,
[1:10:19] and had come to Jerusalem for to
[1:10:21] worship,
[1:10:22] was returning and sitting in his
[1:10:25] chariot, read Isaiah the prophet, when
[1:10:29] the spirit said unto Philip, then the
[1:10:31] spirit said unto Philip, go near and
[1:10:33] join thyself to this chariot. Praise the
[1:10:36] Lord. Now, kind of kind of reminds me of
[1:10:39] of Brother Brandham and the plane going
[1:10:42] down and telling him to walk and coming
[1:10:45] and this uh little black lady with her
[1:10:49] son sick in the in the house. Uh God
[1:10:52] just landed the plane and told him to
[1:10:54] walk. Didn't tell him where. They said
[1:10:56] go here. He just went not knowing where
[1:10:58] he's why. Why, Lord? We always want to
[1:11:01] know why. Why am I doing this? And you
[1:11:03] don't need to know why. Just do what I
[1:11:05] tell you. Amen. You know, God loves
[1:11:07] obedience. Amen. Obedience is better
[1:11:10] than sacrifice. [snorts]
[1:11:12] But this unic was reading in Isaiah.
[1:11:15] Now, look at how God brings things
[1:11:16] together. And Philip ran thither to him
[1:11:19] and heard him read the prophet Isaiah
[1:11:22] and said, "Understandest thou what thou
[1:11:24] readest?" As he's reading Isaiah. Now,
[1:11:27] why out of all the Old Testament, out of
[1:11:29] all the Torah, why was this unic reading
[1:11:32] that scripture?
[1:11:35] because that's the scripture he need to
[1:11:37] be reading. When Philillip came up to
[1:11:39] him to explain to him and help him
[1:11:41] understand this is how listen now 31st
[1:11:44] verse and he said how can I except some
[1:11:46] man should guide me and he desired
[1:11:49] Philillip that he would come and sit
[1:11:51] with him the place of the scripture
[1:11:53] which he read was this he was led as a
[1:11:56] sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb
[1:11:58] dumb before the shear so open he not his
[1:12:01] mouth obviously we know talking about
[1:12:03] Jesus out of all the scripture he was
[1:12:06] reading that
[1:12:07] for Philip to come and get him. Amen.
[1:12:10] What an opening, saints. Like I said
[1:12:13] before, if the Lord has you witness to
[1:12:15] somebody, you don't have to tear doors
[1:12:17] down and rip things apart and try to
[1:12:20] make a new hole somewhere or use
[1:12:23] dynamite. God will allow the door to be
[1:12:26] there. He'll allow the door to be open.
[1:12:28] God will make a way. Amen. God will
[1:12:31] allow it to happen the way it happens to
[1:12:33] bring it to his conclusion. to God's
[1:12:36] conclusion to God's end in 33 ver 33rd
[1:12:40] 33rd verse in his um humiliation his
[1:12:44] judgment was taken away and who shall
[1:12:47] declare his generation for his life is
[1:12:50] taken from the earth and the unic
[1:12:52] answered Philip and said I pray thee of
[1:12:53] whom speaketh the prophet this of
[1:12:55] himself or of some other man what
[1:12:57] opening what better opening to have to
[1:13:00] try to talk to someone about Jesus
[1:13:04] amen then Philip opened his mouth and
[1:13:06] began at the same scripture and preached
[1:13:08] unto him Jesus. And as he went on their
[1:13:11] way, they came unto a certain water. And
[1:13:13] the unic said, see here is the water,
[1:13:16] what doth hinder me to be baptized? And
[1:13:18] Philip said, if thou believest with all
[1:13:21] thine heart, thou mayest? And he
[1:13:23] answered and said, I believe that Jesus
[1:13:26] Christ is the son of God. And he
[1:13:28] commanded the chariot to stand still.
[1:13:31] They both went down both into the water,
[1:13:33] both Philip and the unic, and he
[1:13:35] baptized him. And when they were come up
[1:13:38] out of the water, the spirit of the Lord
[1:13:41] caught away Philillip that the unic saw
[1:13:44] him no more, and he went on his way
[1:13:48] rejoicing. But Philip was founded as as
[1:13:51] Zotus, and passing through he preached
[1:13:54] in all the cities till he came to
[1:13:55] Cesaria. Amen. One of the great miracles
[1:13:59] of the Bible. Philip comes the miracle
[1:14:02] of sending Philip to the right place at
[1:14:04] the right time to talk to this unit when
[1:14:07] this unic was reading the exact really
[1:14:09] the exact scripture that was the perfect
[1:14:11] segway for him to come in and start
[1:14:13] talking to him about Jesus and preaching
[1:14:15] to him about Jesus and the word again
[1:14:18] the word is what brought revelation and
[1:14:21] when revelation hit the man's heart he
[1:14:23] said can I be baptized he said if you
[1:14:25] believe with all your HEART HE SAID I
[1:14:27] believe
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; then what hinders ers, you stop this
[1:14:31] chariot. Let's go get baptized. He
[1:14:33] stopped that chariot, went down and got
[1:14:35] baptized. And then God, when Philip's
[1:14:38] work there with the unic was done, GOD
[1:14:41] DONE, GOD TOOK PHILILLIP AND PUT HIM IN
[1:14:43] SOME other place.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't have time for you to take a
[1:14:47] plane this time, Philip. We don't have
[1:14:48] time for you to take a chariot. We don't
[1:14:49] have time for you to even walk or run.
[1:14:52] I'm just going to transport you. I'm
[1:14:54] just going to take you from here to
[1:14:56] there. Amen. Oh.
[1:15:00] You talk about a miracle, saints. You
[1:15:02] imagine what the unic probably thought
[1:15:04] when he's sitting there and Philip
[1:15:05] baptized him and he comes up and then
[1:15:07] Philip all of a sudden's gone.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; No wonder the unic went away rejoicing.
[1:15:13] He knew that he found something real.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; He knew that he found something that was
[1:15:17] right. Praise the Lord when he saw that
[1:15:20] happen. And then Philip just goes and
[1:15:22] Philip just shows up in Esdice and he
[1:15:25] just starts preaching just like nothing
[1:15:26] happened or at least it doesn't look
[1:15:28] that way. He just starts preaching and
[1:15:30] just keeps preaching. He evangelizes and
[1:15:32] goes from city to city till he gets to
[1:15:34] Cesaria.
[1:15:36] Amen. Just doing the work of the Lord.
[1:15:38] Just doing what the Lord gave to him to
[1:15:40] do. Just continuing to preach that word.
[1:15:43] Bringing souls to Calvary. Bringing
[1:15:45] souls to Christ. And this unit went off
[1:15:48] rejoicing, glad, happy, thankful because
[1:15:51] he had received what he had been looking
[1:15:53] for. Amen. And it's that simple. It's
[1:15:57] not had to be made to some uh great
[1:16:00] thing that people make it out of. It's
[1:16:01] just that simple. Amen. And then and
[1:16:05] then you move on. It's done. It's over.
[1:16:07] God God did what he wanted to do right
[1:16:09] then and there. And God took care of it.
[1:16:11] God put Paul and Silas in their most
[1:16:13] prison one time just to save a jailer
[1:16:15] and his family.
[1:16:17] My mind. I mean, what the things what
[1:16:20] God will turn the world completely
[1:16:22] upside down to save one of his lost.
[1:16:25] Amen. God will do whatever has to be
[1:16:27] done. He'll use whoever he has to use to
[1:16:30] bring one of his lost back to him. Just
[1:16:33] one. It's all it takes. I mean, just
[1:16:36] think if you
[1:16:38] you were a a mother or father or
[1:16:40] something and and your child got lost.
[1:16:42] What would you do to go find them? What
[1:16:44] if they just disappeared? What would you
[1:16:46] do to go find them? You turn over, you'd
[1:16:49] turn over every rock. You'd go to every
[1:16:51] news station. You'd get into every
[1:16:54] newspaper, every uh uh uh social media.
[1:16:57] You'd do everything you could possibly
[1:16:59] do to try to find that child.
[1:17:02] I would.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly what God does. And
[1:17:06] then greater when you realize it's in
[1:17:09] the spiritual realm, God will do
[1:17:11] anything to bring one of his childs and
[1:17:13] doing Philillip this. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:16] And now and then and then Philip just
[1:17:18] goes on and preaching. Philip just goes
[1:17:20] from there and just keeps preaching.
[1:17:22] Amen. Remember the uh what he what he
[1:17:26] told to Timothy. He said, "Be instant,
[1:17:28] in season, out of season." Amen. Do the
[1:17:31] work of evangelist.
[1:17:34] There'll come a time when they'll not
[1:17:35] endure sound doctrine. That's what the
[1:17:37] Bible says. [snorts]
[1:17:39] They won't endure sound doctrine.
[1:17:40] Friend, if we're expecting the Lord to
[1:17:42] come any time now, do you think we're
[1:17:44] there yet?
[1:17:46] I personally do. I think we've got to
[1:17:48] the place that you talk to people all
[1:17:49] the time till you're blue in the face.
[1:17:52] They don't want to hear you. They don't
[1:17:54] want to hear it. It means nothing to
[1:17:57] them. Uh they're happy with their life.
[1:18:00] There's no conviction. Amen. No
[1:18:03] conviction.
[1:18:04] Let's just let me read this. I got a
[1:18:06] couple more quotes I want to read.
[1:18:09] Spiritual food in due season. Now, I
[1:18:10] haven't had a prayer line for this in
[1:18:13] like this in a long, long time. How many
[1:18:15] remembers my commission when we built
[1:18:17] the tabernacle here? He said, "Do the
[1:18:20] work of an evangelist." Didn't say I was
[1:18:22] an evangelist. Said do the work of an
[1:18:25] evangelist.
[1:18:27] See, for an hour will come. That's been
[1:18:29] uh that that has to be changed. the
[1:18:31] hours arriving. I say the hours here.
[1:18:34] You can't mix, brother says you can't
[1:18:36] mix two or three different ministries
[1:18:39] together. Pastor, evangelist, same time.
[1:18:41] You can't do it. Amen. Says if you're
[1:18:44] evangelist, stay evangelist. Pastor stay
[1:18:46] pastor. Amen. Uh in conferences, he said
[1:18:50] we're uh we're as Sodom and Gabbar
[1:18:52] living in that. Let the righteous spirit
[1:18:54] in us. These six uh these sins vex our
[1:18:58] soul daily. I'd like to talk about Sodom
[1:19:00] and tomorrow. As it was in the days of
[1:19:02] Sodom, so shall it be today. Amen. I've
[1:19:05] got something on my heart I want to
[1:19:06] bring sometime. Amen. We get done with
[1:19:08] this. Amen. As it was vex our soul. Let
[1:19:13] the sin of the world, the fashions of
[1:19:15] Hollywood, all this Hollywood evangelism
[1:19:17] and nonsense, as brother Bram calls it,
[1:19:20] nonsense. All this make up and beat the
[1:19:24] music and jump up and down. The music
[1:19:26] stops and down you go. When a man is
[1:19:29] washed in the blood of the lamb, he
[1:19:31] don't need music or nothing else. THE
[1:19:33] POWER OF GOD JUST WORKS upon him and he
[1:19:35] can shout, scream, praise God, do
[1:19:37] anything else, whether there's music or
[1:19:39] not.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Doesn't need
[1:19:42] emotionalism. Doesn't need it to be
[1:19:44] worked up. But look, as he said, as it
[1:19:46] was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be
[1:19:48] in the coming of the son of man, the day
[1:19:51] that we're living. Amen. He said, "Now,
[1:19:55] brother said, now there's one. There's
[1:19:58] three."
[1:19:59] Let's see if I find this here.
[1:20:03] Amen. [clears throat]
[1:20:05] This is the works his faith expressed.
[1:20:07] Now, you take Luke 17:30. Read it. Jesus
[1:20:10] said, "As it was in the days of Sodom,
[1:20:12] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:20:13] of man." Just like it was at Sodom. Now,
[1:20:16] look at the position of the world today.
[1:20:18] Now, this was 60 years ago, saints. 60
[1:20:23] years and two months ago because it's
[1:20:26] November 1965.
[1:20:30] 60 years ago he said look at the world
[1:20:32] today. So I'm going to say the same
[1:20:34] thing here 60 years later. Look at the
[1:20:36] world today.
[1:20:38] Sodommites
[1:20:40] look at Billy Graham or Roberts. We
[1:20:42] can't even look at them anymore. They're
[1:20:43] both passed on. But Brother Brham says
[1:20:46] look at them. Them two witnesses.
[1:20:48] Brother Graham's talking about the time
[1:20:50] that the three angels came as Sodom and
[1:20:52] Gomorrah. They came to Abraham first and
[1:20:55] one angel which brother Graham talks
[1:20:59] about was God. One angel stay with
[1:21:01] Abraham and talked with Abraham while
[1:21:03] the other two went down. Where did the
[1:21:05] other two go? The other two went to
[1:21:07] minister to the world to minister to the
[1:21:10] cosmos to min to minister to the
[1:21:12] sodomites. Now, brother Random says,
[1:21:14] "Now look at Billy Graham and or
[1:21:16] Roberts. Them two witnesses down there
[1:21:18] witnessing to those denominational
[1:21:20] churches. One to Methodists and Baptists
[1:21:23] and Presbyterians and the others to the
[1:21:25] Pentecostals."
[1:21:26] Brother Rand was liking the scripture to
[1:21:30] recognize
[1:21:31] everyone gets their chance. They all had
[1:21:35] their ministry. They all had their
[1:21:37] opportunity.
[1:21:39] God
[1:21:40] stayed BACK WITH THE PROPHET. The other
[1:21:42] two went down and ministered to those
[1:21:44] that were in Sodom. What happened? He
[1:21:47] warned them, tell them, "Get out now
[1:21:49] while you can. Get out while there's
[1:21:51] opportunity." And look at what's
[1:21:52] happening today. Amen. Look what's going
[1:21:55] on. I said, in this country, especially
[1:21:57] in this country AND THIS REVIVAL that's
[1:21:59] happening of all these people starting
[1:22:02] to come and becoming more religious, if
[1:22:04] you will, becoming more spiritual, if
[1:22:06] you will. Amen.
[1:22:08] I I' I've had so many people tell me, "I
[1:22:10] didn't know you were so religious." I
[1:22:12] said, "I'm not. Religion makes me sick
[1:22:14] to my stomach. Religion is nothing but a
[1:22:16] covering. I'm a Christian. I'm a Holy
[1:22:19] Ghost fil son of God. Not I'm not
[1:22:22] religious.
[1:22:24] You can you can take religion and go to
[1:22:26] hell with it
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; because religion is nothing but a
[1:22:28] covering that people do their rituals
[1:22:30] and their things and think that they're
[1:22:32] okay. Look at this demonic thing that
[1:22:34] Satan's trying to do to the kids today.
[1:22:37] I didn't ever even know anything about
[1:22:39] it till me and uh Tath and Zach and the
[1:22:42] kids, we all went and Sonia went to the
[1:22:44] light parade and these kids are coming
[1:22:46] through the parade and they're doing
[1:22:47] this thing. I don't even want to do it.
[1:22:50] Especially here and whatever it means.
[1:22:52] They're doing that like they're juggling
[1:22:53] or something and they start screaming
[1:22:55] out 6767 like what in the world are
[1:22:58] these kids talking about? I had no idea
[1:23:01] what it was. Never heard of it. Maybe
[1:23:02] you've never heard of it. I don't know.
[1:23:05] That's the first time I'd ever heard of
[1:23:06] it. But it's some big popular thing,
[1:23:08] especially among young kids where this
[1:23:11] rapper come up with these lyrics or
[1:23:14] something and and it's six seven and
[1:23:16] nobody even knows the exact definition
[1:23:19] or reason for it. But when it goes on,
[1:23:22] they start doing that motion. And I've
[1:23:25] seen videos. Uh Doug, the guy I work
[1:23:27] with, he showed me a video and and and
[1:23:31] this rapper, they're they're they're
[1:23:33] carrying on with this 67 stuff and those
[1:23:36] kids are just worked into a brainless
[1:23:38] frenzy.
[1:23:40] I I'm I don't usually advise looking at
[1:23:43] something, but if you want to see
[1:23:45] something, you want to see hell on earth
[1:23:47] right now, go watch that stuff. Those
[1:23:51] kids get worked up in their brains. They
[1:23:53] get worked up in the spirit. They start
[1:23:55] screaming and yelling and carrying on
[1:23:56] and doing that motion. It's it's
[1:23:59] demonic, saints. It came from a demonic
[1:24:02] source. Don't ever let your children do
[1:24:04] something like your grandchildren or
[1:24:06] your or friends or families. That stuff
[1:24:08] IS A DEVIL. I'VE SEEN IT. I I've
[1:24:12] witnessed that. What it does to those
[1:24:14] kids, it it just it they go outside
[1:24:16] their minds. Has anybody ever heard of
[1:24:19] it? I it just I couldn't believe it. I
[1:24:22] I'd never heard of it. I didn't know
[1:24:24] what it was. We had to ask Joel. Joel
[1:24:27] didn't really know exactly what it was.
[1:24:28] Thank God that Tabitha pretty much
[1:24:31] shields them from the world. But um they
[1:24:33] didn't really he kind of tried to
[1:24:35] explain it, but it was after uh I went
[1:24:38] to work the next week. U it came up for
[1:24:42] some reason while we was having lunch
[1:24:44] and Doug was trying to explain it to me.
[1:24:46] He's like 36 so [clears throat] he's a
[1:24:48] little younger. was trying to explain it
[1:24:50] worldly note the rap stuff and all that
[1:24:53] and he tried to explain it and he showed
[1:24:56] me a video I said that's a devil I
[1:24:59] looked at him I said that is demonic
[1:25:01] don't you ever let do that or let
[1:25:04] somebody that's the devil
[1:25:07] getting hyped up in that it's just
[1:25:09] demonic saints and and it's it is
[1:25:11] sweeping across I it's hard to believe
[1:25:14] how prevalent it really is but my
[1:25:17] warning don't ever get involved in that.
[1:25:19] That that's the devil, saints. That's
[1:25:21] the devil. But look, let me close here.
[1:25:25] Sorry my tangent, but it's the truth.
[1:25:27] Anyway, but I want you to see something.
[1:25:29] What brother Random said about Billy
[1:25:31] about Billy Graham. A lot of people try
[1:25:32] to put Billy Graham said this, that, and
[1:25:34] the other, and you know, he was only
[1:25:36] this, could only do that. You know, we
[1:25:37] can only do what God has for us to do.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; We can only be who God wants us to be.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. In whatever position it is and
[1:25:45] whatever God calls us to do. But look
[1:25:47] what brother Brandham said about Billy
[1:25:48] Graham in the 10 virgins, 144,000 Jews.
[1:25:53] He [snorts] said, "We got a uh these
[1:25:55] great ministers that's covering that
[1:25:58] world out there and an evangelist." He
[1:26:01] is an evangelist. Uh covering that world
[1:26:04] out there after Billy Look what brother
[1:26:06] look what this is a quote. I'm reading
[1:26:08] this. After Billy Graham received the
[1:26:11] Holy Ghost, he could not come into here.
[1:26:16] Brother Graham was talking about after
[1:26:18] he received the Holy Ghost, he couldn't
[1:26:20] come into this message because his field
[1:26:24] is out there
[1:26:26] the world. God sent him down there for a
[1:26:29] purpose, for a reason. So, you see what
[1:26:32] he's saying? when he received the Holy
[1:26:34] Ghost, he couldn't come into this
[1:26:36] because his field's out there and he
[1:26:39] recognized it. He recognized
[1:26:43] THAT AND GOD IS HOLDING him there.
[1:26:48] Think about that and see what God a lot
[1:26:51] of people say, well, you know, he's
[1:26:52] this, that, and the other. No, God,
[1:26:54] look, God's in control of this, friend.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's in control of what he's
[1:26:59] doing. God's in control of who he's who
[1:27:02] he has. Amen. And God put them there for
[1:27:05] a reason. And God allows this to happen
[1:27:08] for a reason. He allows them to be where
[1:27:10] they were for a reason.
[1:27:12] People I've even heard people talk about
[1:27:14] putting him in in hell.
[1:27:17] How dare you?
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I don't watch his ministry.
[1:27:21] His ministry doesn't feed me. I don't
[1:27:24] have a problem with it, but I don't I
[1:27:26] don't spend time listening to Billy
[1:27:27] Graham because his me his word, his
[1:27:29] message doesn't feed me. Amen. This
[1:27:32] message feeds me.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; This is bride food. Amen. But he knew
[1:27:37] his place and he stayed there. He said
[1:27:39] because that was his mission. You know,
[1:27:41] I close with this. You know, we went to
[1:27:43] Billy Graham's library in Charlotte,
[1:27:45] North Carolina where I was born. We went
[1:27:48] and visited there and uh I think it was
[1:27:51] me and Ma. You've never been, have you?
[1:27:53] It was just me and Micah. We went and um
[1:27:59] uh we we watched we watched a video and
[1:28:03] it showed and it was just everything in
[1:28:05] there was it was just all about Billy
[1:28:06] Graham. Billy Graham, Billy Graham,
[1:28:08] Billy Graham, Billy Graham. It was Billy
[1:28:09] Graham's library. So, Billy Graham and
[1:28:12] then I saw uh you know all his meetings
[1:28:15] and all this stuff. Then I saw where
[1:28:18] they dedicated the library and he was
[1:28:20] there and Bill Clinton was there and
[1:28:23] George Bush was there and and I I forgot
[1:28:26] who all but but I mean great I mean
[1:28:30] well-known popular I say great men but
[1:28:32] you know uh of of statue were there
[1:28:36] and Billy Graham finally got up after
[1:28:39] all these people praising him and
[1:28:41] talking about him and putting him up how
[1:28:43] great a man and Billy Graham served his
[1:28:45] purpose. Absolutely. Billy Graham got up
[1:28:48] to the podium
[1:28:50] and he said, "I've been through this
[1:28:51] library." I'm paraphrasing.
[1:28:54] I've been through this library and I've
[1:28:55] only got one disagreement with it. He
[1:28:58] said, "There's too much Billy Graham and
[1:29:00] not enough Jesus Christ."
[1:29:03] And I thought, if a man like that in
[1:29:05] that position could make that statement
[1:29:06] in front of all those people, that that
[1:29:10] sealed it for me.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't get up and start talking
[1:29:14] all these other. He said, "I've got one
[1:29:16] problem. There's too much Billy Graham
[1:29:19] and not enough Jesus Christ here." Oh,
[1:29:22] what a man.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; God bless him. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:26] That's a true evangelist. Amen. Stayed
[1:29:29] the course, did his job. Amen. And then
[1:29:32] you can say like Paul, ready to be
[1:29:34] offered up. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's
[1:29:37] stand if we could.
[1:29:43] I had a couple more scriptures, but
[1:29:44] we'll just forego that for now. Um, we
[1:29:49] brought them into the message anyway
[1:29:51] into our uh ministry,
[1:29:54] into that understanding of evangelism
[1:29:58] and what that evangelism does for us and
[1:30:01] our desire
[1:30:03] uh here on this earth. Amen. Let's sing
[1:30:06] this little chorus 493 in the book. You
[1:30:09] want to turn there. I want to live the
[1:30:11] way he wants me to live.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; So, well, let this be as we're before we
[1:30:17] get dismissed here today, let that be
[1:30:20] our anthem. Amen. Let this be what rings
[1:30:24] through our hearts in this next year,
[1:30:26] however long the Lord will carry. Amen.
[1:30:29] Let this be ring through our hearts and
[1:30:32] our lives.
[1:30:34] We sing it now. [clears throat]
[1:30:36] I want to live
[1:30:39] the way
[1:30:41] he wants me to live. I want to give
[1:30:47] [singing]
[1:30:49] until there's just no more to give. I
[1:30:55] want to love.
[1:30:58] Love till there's just no more love.
[1:31:04] Oh, I could never
[1:31:07] ever out love the Lord.
[1:31:11] [singing]
[1:31:13] I want to live
[1:31:15] the way he wants me to live. I want to
[1:31:23] give [singing]
[1:31:25] until there's just no more to give. I
[1:31:32] want to love
[1:31:35] love till there's just no more love. Oh,
[1:31:42] I could never ever out love the Lord.
[1:31:48] Oh, can we sing it this way one time
[1:31:50] now? I'm going to live [singing]
[1:31:54] the way
[1:31:56] Jesus wants me to live. I'm going to
[1:32:02] give [singing]
[1:32:04] until there's just no [singing] more to
[1:32:10] give. I'm going to love
[1:32:15] till [singing]
[1:32:16] there's just no more love. Oh, I could
[1:32:22] never
[1:32:24] ever out love my Lord.
[1:32:30] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let that be
[1:32:33] our testimony. Let that be our desire.
[1:32:36] Let that be our life. Amen. However much
[1:32:39] time we've got left. Amen. Let that be
[1:32:42] what comes from our heart, from our
[1:32:44] lives. I want to live, I'm going to live
[1:32:48] the way Jesus wants me to live. Amen.
[1:32:51] Praise the Lord. God bless you today.
[1:32:54] Pray something was said to bless and
[1:32:55] strengthen the Lord today. Amen. We'll
[1:32:59] be dismissed. Happy new year again.
[1:33:00] Welcome to a new year 2026. We'll see
[1:33:03] what the Lord has in store for this
[1:33:05] year. Amen. But all we have regardless
[1:33:08] of what we serve him.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Live for him. Praise the Lord
[1:33:13] Jesus. So God richly bless you. Remember
[1:33:16] all the prayer requests, all the things
[1:33:18] that were mentioned. Amen. We just trust
[1:33:20] the Lord moves on our lives, moves on
[1:33:23] our hearts. Amen. And let it be, Amen.
[1:33:26] to us according to his perfect will.
[1:33:28] Amen. So God richly bless you then.
[1:33:31] Amen. We'll be dismissed today. You want
[1:33:33] to have anything before we go.
[1:33:37] Amen. Praise the Lord. Now let's just
[1:33:40] bow our heads. Amen. As we have another
[1:33:43] word of prayer with our Lord Jesus.
[1:33:44] Lord, so thankful father again for this
[1:33:47] service today. Thankful father of your
[1:33:49] hand upon our lives. You leading,
[1:33:51] guiding, and directing us. Thank you,
[1:33:53] Lord, for your word, Father, in speaking
[1:33:55] to us from that word and letting us see
[1:33:57] in here what you'd have us to know, God,
[1:34:00] that it'd be a blessing and a strength
[1:34:02] and a help to us in our lives, God.
[1:34:05] Lord, we know that we are a a people
[1:34:08] that are searching, Lord, continually
[1:34:11] for your perfect will in all of our
[1:34:13] lives. lead us, guide us, direct us,
[1:34:16] help us, use us, strengthen us, bless
[1:34:18] us, and be with us as we go our separate
[1:34:22] ways. Now we commit ourselves to you.
[1:34:24] May you continue to move upon the prayer
[1:34:26] request, the needs that were made known,
[1:34:28] every circumstance and situation, we're
[1:34:30] believing for you, Father, complete
[1:34:33] deliverance and healing and blessing.
[1:34:35] Grant it to us now. Commit it all to you
[1:34:37] and ask your blessings on these people.
[1:34:39] Bless us through the week, Father, in
[1:34:41] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:34:44] God bless you. Be dismissed.
