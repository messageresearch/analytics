his way of telling us he loves us praise the Lord amen God bless you again today amen we have a couple prayer requests sister matis is not with us today uh still isolating am man she felt like she had gotten double pneumonia so uh she's still feeling better but still isolating so please remember her in prayer she said she's be watching with us today hopefully Lord will and she is God bless you Sister mati I did not hear from Sister Julie um her results she' had that thing they had to put on her the probes and stuff to make sure she's okay and get her license back so uh but I hadn't spoke to her about that since and my wife's not saying anything so I'm guessing she hasn't either so amen but please remember Sister Julie in prayer uh also got a prayer request from Sister Lydia today or last night actually uh most of you sisters probably got it she sent the text to you sisters but she was supposed to go in today they did a u a test of some kind I don't understand at all I told Micah he could explain it but the bottom line is we need to remember Sister Lydia in prayer she went last Thursday some of her results didn't look quite right uh to the doctor so they brought her in today uh which I me and my wife thought was fairly unusual on a Sunday but uh I guess maybe they thought it was that important so she's going to the doctor uh today to do some more tests and things run I could explain a little different but just please remember her in prayer amen that the Lord would just continue to touch she's felt good she's been wanting to come back to church and just it seems like every time she gets that gun to come back to church uh something else slams her so uh but we're believing together binding our faith together for sister Lydia the Lord would just bless and help her amen and believing those tests are going to come out positive in her for for in her favor amen and you never know what to say if you should say positive or negative negative means it's not good but negative means that nothing's there but positive means that something's there but positive so for her betterment amen praise the Lord that's the thing that uh we we want the most brother Dennis gave me a prayer request please pray for Leah his wife on the 27th she will have her gallbladder removed uh and we're believing together that all will go well uh as the Lord takes control praise the Lord so remember that for brother Dennis's wife Leah the Lord would just bless that and U guide the hand of the doctor and all will go well praise the Lord anyone have an unspoken request on your heart amen Lord knows all our needs to make good to see each one of you K's your next door in the Sunday school so thankful for that so let's just stand to our feet if we could uh appreciate your prayers I'm

there's just a few things I didn't quite get to last week on this maturity so Lord willing will pick up up there before we left off last week so Matthew Chapter 5 we're just going to read the one verse there verse 48 again Matthew 5:48 praise the Lord probably not be very long today because uh I wanted to hold off in starting the next part of this so we're just going to try to finish up the maturity part which there wasn't much whole lot left to that but uh something to just help us again understand the day and the hour that we live amen amen as much as anything in our position in Christ so which adoptions about our position in Christ amen so this is adoption part eight uh maturity part three praise the Lord and read we're going to read one verse of scripture Matthew 5:48 but before we do we just bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus we're so very grateful again Lord your blessings your grace your love your mercy so thankful Lord that you've led us to this place so thankful God that you've give us your uh blessings One More Time Lord today feeling and knowing that your presence is near God you never leave us or forsake us father and you promise we are two or three are together in your name that you are there in the midst Lord we're not here in the name of a nomination we're not here in the name of a pastor we're not here in the name of a prophet or any man we're here and gathered together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's no uh no name higher no name greater Lord You Are God Almighty and there's none like you we worship and praise you today and thank you so much Lord for your word Lord for the revealing of your word for the blessings of your word Lord for showing us in that word who we are father that we can find our place in that word that we can find our names in that word because it speaks of us Lord and we stand clear knowing god that you are the one that does it for us yes Lord Lord we just pray that your Holy Spirit would take complete control of this service Lord speak through these lips the words you'd have us to hear anoint every one of us father to receive what you'd have to speak to us today Father we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done let it be now God according to the purpose that you designed this service that you called this service to order to be God for we know it will not return void accomplish that that you sent it forth for we thank you and praise you for it bless each one that have come those who may be watching streaming Lord we just bless uh commit them to you Lord and pray you bless each one Lord we commit all these things to your hands and ask these blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Matthew chapter 5 verse 48 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you can be seated if you'd like amen as we know we've gone over several times uh that word if you look that word up that word does not mean sinless Perfection it means a mature or full age amen when Jesus is saying be you therefore perfect he's not expecting us as humans to be sinlessly perfect but to grow up and to be mature to be a full age amen amen that's what the Lord is expecting of us today especially in the day and the hour that we live amen let's go over to Leviticus uh I want to start our context of the word here uh that we want to speak on today again this is adoption 8 maturity part three amen maturity part three I want to go back over to uh or go to Leviticus uh chapter 23 that's where I want to start my uh the reading today if we could Leviticus 3 uh 23 Leviticus 23 we'll begin with verse 9 I want to read through and then we'll go back and uh and pick these things up as we uh and see what the Lord's speaking to us here as we pick each portion of this up uh Leviticus 23:9 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you become when you become come into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheath of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest and he shall shall wave the sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you on the tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it and you shall offer that day when you wave the sheath and heam without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord the meal offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil an offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet smelling Savior and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine the fourth part of a hen and ye shall eat neither bread nor parched corn nor green ears until the selfsame day that he uh that ye have brought an offering unto your God it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations and all your dwellings and ye shall count unto you from the tomorrow after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the sheep of the wave offering seven Sabbath shall be complete even until the tomorrow after the seventh shab Sabbath shall ye number 50 days and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord you shall bring out of your habitations two uh wave loaves of T of two t Deals they shall be a fine flower they shall be bacon with leaven they are the first fruits unto the Lord now let's Look What the Lord is trying to speech us because we know that all the Old Testament is the type and Shadow of the New Testament and Christ revealing to us of course today uh through the truth of the revelation of the word that uh of what this word was speaking at this time as God was having them do this in a practical sense what God was doing to to I to identify and to announce his coming and to identify and announce the coming of the oncoming bride amen and the bride ages the church ages in the bride age amen so let's go back and read and look at what the Lord is speaking because he spoke unto Moses speak to the children of Israel we're going back to the ninth verse now amen back to the ninth verse I wanted to read it all first because sometimes the the the the the purpose gets lost a as we begin to go through it right amen so I wanted to read through it so you could listen to hear what God was telling Moses the children of Israel to do for this purpose before we broke it down and understanding the points that God is trying to make here now speak on now again the ninth verse 10th verse speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when ye become come into the land which I give unto you praise the Lord that's the number one thing to remember it's God is always the one that gives God is always the one that does it if there's any blessings if there's any good thing if there's anything to brag about it's God that's does it amen God is the one that gives he wants them to understand I give you this land yeah you're working it and you're planting it you're sewing it and you're reaping it but but I gave it to you yes amen understand that it was by the power of my hand amen now they had to go take it praise the Lord but it's by the power of my hand that you had this land I gave you this land and shall reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall bring a sheath of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priests so after this land I've gave you after you've planted it sewed it after you've reaped it you need to take of the first of the grain that came to the point of maturity because a a good farmer waits till his crop is mature before he reaps it right uh a good farmer is not going to go take of the fruit of the land before it's ready to be partaken of yes amen they wait till it comes to a place of maturity uh we have a lot of fruit trees where we live and we know if you go pick a fruit when it's green uh doesn't taste very good uh it's not going to satisfy it's not going to serve its purpose you got to wait for that fruit to become mature and a lot of times uh it has to set in the sun before it can actually ripen and come to a place of maturity in fact I found out especially with a lot of the fruits at are at where we live that the the sweetest fruits are in the top of the tree right that gets the that get gets the Lion Share of the sun amen the that that gets the most Sun praise the Lord is the one that's the sweetest so a lot of times we uh we have Joel or maybe even Emma now climb up in the tree to go up and get a fruit that's way up in the top uh they also give we give a picker that you can go pick but when you get up in the top is up there where it gets the most Sun amen praise the Lord not just the Su n but the s o n when it gets a lot the most of the sun that's where it's the sweetest that's when it tastes the best when it gets to that place of of riping and maturing and when it gets to that mature place then it it becomes consumable it becomes edible it becomes even a desire to eat because it tastes so good amen but now what God's telling them now this land that I've gave you you've planted it you've sewed it but now the first that comes to the place where it's mature enough for you to reap when it becomes mature enough for you to be able to take and to get ready to prepare for consumption I wanted you to take the first bundle of that which is sheep is just a bundle of the stalks that's taken up if they take up and of course they didn't have big huge Harvester machines they did everything by hand they grab it and whack it off with a sickle or whatever uh knife they used and they would take them when they got a nice big bundle of sheath of mature grain amen they to take that and bundle it together so you got got a bunch of loose grain a bunch of loose stalks all uh individual stalks but they're bound together amen they're bound together which is the best that they could do Under the blood of bulls and ghosts the best they could do was to be able to come together in in Loosely fit group amen together uh and that's what the sheath represented it was a bundle it was a bundle of those that they brought together that was Loosely they were bound together amen by one purpose amen by one person by one God they were all bound together but they were still loose leaves they were still loose stalks that were there but the priest was to to take that stalk to take that sheep and they were to take it to the priest the priest was supposed to take that and wave that over the people as the wave offering that sheath was to be waved over the people as a wave offering to recognize God did this for you God gave this to us this is the fruit that we're partaking of because of God's goodness to us amen this is a representation of what God has given us it's also a representation to say that this is just the beginning amen this is just the first the first fruit this is just the first one that came to maturity that's waved over the people it represents not just only only of course the loose knit of the stalks together and of God giving it to wave over the people as a reminder of who gave them that land and why they're able to partake of that but it's also a signification that this is just the first one of many amen this is just the beginning this is just the start of the Harvest that you're going to enjoy because of God's goodness this is just the first one take the first one and wave it over the people let let it be a reminder let them understand that I am your God Amen and and and and to me only do you worship me only do you praise amen amen and this is just to signify that the same God that gave you this one is the same God that's going to give you all the other yeah right God is going to continue to bless the land God is going to continue to bless you because God is the one that that gives the blessings to begin with yes if we can recognize understand it's God that gives it amen it's like we uh preached when we talked about tithe and offering and money and and things that the Lord blesses us with and the scripture says Oh by by my strength have I gotten this wealth no it's not God gives it amen and you know how quickly God can take it away from you just like that if he desires to praise the Lord that's why we give amen that's why God give this is just a recognition this is just the beginning amen I am your God you are my people and this is just the start this is just the first one to be waved up the first one that came to a place of maturity the first one that got to a place of usage amen because before the maturity it was it it it hit or or you you you don't want to pluck a fruit again that's not mature this is the first one enjoy it because this is a sheep of the first fruits and he had the priest wave it amen not the farmer not the one that grew it not the tribes whose land it belongs to but the priest that was their job right that was their position because God recognized that position because he's the one that instituted it God's the one that instituted the priesthood so God's the one that recognizes that priesthood so you take that to the priest because that priest is consecrated that priest is in the position of consecration to do it on my behalf take it to him right amen and then let him wave it over the people amen not just for him but for all the people we all benefit because of God's because of what God's did now first fruits look now they shall reap the Harvest then shall bring the sheep of the first fruits of the Harvest the first to come to maturity unto the priest and he shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you on the tomorrow after the pre after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it praise the Lord the priest shall wave now what is it I may be getting a little too deep here but what what happens when we reach a Sabbath day we consider the Sabbath day the seventh day of the week and we number our weeks in sevens which is God's completion amen we number our weeks in sevens so what happens after the seventh day amen amen we start over a new week again praise the Lord so we can go to the holy convocations to get it more into that uh uh the the feast days of the scripture and the holy convocation of the eighth day but there's a rolling over of a of a new week so many times we we do it we do it all the time we do it for the newness of weeks we do it sometimes for the newness of days we wake up it's a new day we do it with the newness of weeks oh it's a new week this going to be a good week we do it with the newness of months sometimes we definitely do it with the newness of years with all of our resolutions and all that stuff that hardly anybody ever keeps any of but we do it all the time it's a rolling over it's a new beginning if you will amen well that's what the scripture did uh that that God showed was was a new beginning so each week is a new beginning as the seven as you get past or beyond the seventh you roll over into a newness of a new week a new day praise the Lord so the oldest past the oldest done this is the new and wave the sheath this is the beginning praise the Lord this is the start let's continue and and he shall offer that day when ye wave the sheath and heland without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord uh and of course we know that represents Christ as the sheath of the waving amen notice there's no leaven offered in here amen no leaven offered amen and the meat offering shall be uh uh thereof shall be two10 deals of fine flour mingled with oil amen mingled with oil remember on the day of Pentecost praise the Lord when the Holy Spirit come we'll read in a few minutes when the Holy Spirit Come it sered two purposes amen Amen on and In Praise the Lord we'll go to that in a minute so as we go in back as we go into to that keep this in your mind mingled with oil not not uh one with it but just mingled with it praise the lord it's like having a it's like having a a a a I'm trying to think of a different word but a glob of that's probably not a great word but a just a glob of dough and you put oil on it and the oil is mingled with the dough the oil is not one with the dough it's just mingled with the dough understand okay so this two10 deal of fine flour is mingled with oil an offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet smelling for a sweet savior now notice we've got an introduction of fire praise the Lord keep that in mind as well and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine which is again just the stimulation we know the stimulation of Revelation spoke of in Revelation five uh 56 I think it is the the oil the stimulation amen uh of the of the spirit of God uh the fourth part of an hen and ye shall eat neither bread nor parch corn nor green ears until the selfs same day that you have brought an offering unto your the unto your God it shall be a statute forever throughout your Generations in all your dwellings listen now 15th verse and ye shall count unto you from the tomorrow after the Sabbath and we've got a tomorrow after the Sabbath where we've had a new beginning amen rolls over into a new beginning uh which would which would represent the the newness of life after now look here you should count from the tomorrow from that time after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the sheath of the wave offering seven Sabbath shall be complete seven sabbaths representing the seven Church ages shall be complete notice after that time of the waving praise the Lord let's keep going uh un even unto the tomorrow after the seventh sh Sabbath shall ye number 50 days which we know is is is Jubilee is is freedom is Liberty is is releasing amen that's 50 is represents Jubilee in the scripture and ye shall offer a new B uh meat offering unto the Lord 17th verse and ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves amen they're no longer sheep they're loaves praise the Lord the she have been taken and made into loaves first you had a mingling of oil that was with them and fire which would bring about a result of of bringing the oil and and the meal the the the flour the dough together to make it to bake it into one now there was a time when it was mingled with oil that you could look and you could separate or you could differentiate between what was oil and what was dough but once it gets baked it all bakes in it vulcanized I trying to keep from using that word because you might not know what that means but that basically is vulcanized just means you take two substance and by heat those two substance become one right that's that's basically what that means so now you've got two loaves what is a loaf a loaf is taking of the of the grain with the mingled oil and baking it with fire together to where now it's not a bunch of loose leaves together it's one baked loaf amen praise God it's no longer a bunch of uh loose grain it's no longer a bunch of stalks that are out that are bound together it is a group now that has come together that has been uh waved over the people amen is is waved over the people a group that is now baked together into one loaf praise the Lord or or a loaf it says two loaves here two two wave loaves of two 10 steel they shall uh they shall be of fine flour which the fine flow just represents Jesus Christ again they shall be bacon amen with Le they are the first fruits unto the Lord notice this is after the seven sabbaths and the Jubilee after the seven Church ages in through that last Church age as we enter into a bride age amen there Comes A Time with which I say now is for this bride after all the church ages from the day of Pentecost till today has come to that place of maturity amen we must be at that place of maturity the bride through the word must be to that place of maturity as mature Christians not babies not fussing about gifts and this and that and back and forth no but mature Christians in the word by the revelation of the word remember we talked last week about when brother Ram said that uh uh Power without character is satanic and my challenge to you and my observation was what if power without character is satanic what is power with character right it's going to be just the opposite right if power without character is satanic then power with character is going to be just the opposite power with character is Godly amen praise the Lord and that's what the bride should have Hal of today remember she'll only say what he says she'll keep keep still unless she's got thus sayith the Lord right well yesterday the Lord showed me something in addition to that power without character is satanic power with character is Godly yes what is the word without a proper Revelation what is the word without proper interpretation or Revelation right that's also satanic yes it is right so if that is satanic what is the word with proper Revelation and interpretation it's Godly amen that's the maturity that God is bringing the bride to amen the bride the word with Revelation the word with the proper interpretation or I I hate using interpretation because that's up for interpretation but by Revelation the word with Revelation cuz Revelation comes from God right amen God's revelation when God reveals it through what the word word says it it goes it brings us right back to growing in Grace and knowledge yes praise the Lord the word with the revelation of God on it is Godly and that is what the bride speaks that is what the mature bride speaks the bride that is now one loaf she's not a bunch of stalks out just bound together amen like they were on the day of Pentecost when they came in on the day of Pentecost it was 20 of them Milling around talking around sitting around whatever they were doing amen I'm sure at one point in time they finally got to the place that they prayed or they worshiped the Lord and they they they got into one mind and one Accord they got into one Spirit somehow yeah and the Bible doesn't explain how uh we kind of got a feeling or understanding of that when we here get into one mind and one Accord and when we get in one mind and one Accord we know what happens yes praise God so we can have a little idea of what they went through on the day of Pentecost when 120 L loose people came in and they walked out the door yes as one Lo praise the Lord as one group of people as one loaf that had came and was brought together and vulcanized with the Holy Ghost and Fire that brought them all together they didn't leave together yeah they were still if you looked at them separate people but we're not talking about looks we're talking about the spirit in the spirit they were one person one mind one Accord praise the Lord but now look I want you to notice something though even with that even with the understanding the spirit of God took control over them look at what the word says we're going to finish this here the two loaves of 10 two10 deal they shall be a fine flower amen representing Christ they shall be bacon praise the Lord the Holy Ghost in fire yes with leaven praise the Lord with leaven now why now is there leaven now notice this this is we're talking about even at the end of the church age ages Saints amen why now is there leaven no mention of Leaven before right there's been no there's been no mention of Leaven you talk about the waving of the sheep and uh that represented Christ well there's no leaven because there was no leaven in Christ right yeah Christ was perfect amen there was no leaven but now there's leav why is there leav because we are still human we are still carnal we are still individual human beings that have sin in our lives that have mistakes faults failures shortcomings we're still human beings that have these things in our lives and as human beings are we are still fallible thus the these loaves that are now baked together they still have leaven in them even though they're baked together even though they come together as one even though we are united together and and brought together as one people because God's not coming for a a bunch of wives God is coming for one woman amen not a little girl one woman his bride God is coming to take his bride home amen one woman praise the Lord Lord because she's all come together in the spirit come together as one but now in our Humanity we still have le amen we still have mistakes we still have faults we still have things that we deal with and go through in life we still have pardon and expression but we still have imperfections right we still have things that we're working on we still have things that we're dealing with but that that that does not change the fact that you're mature mure person a mature Christian amen amen I I I might I might have I've been driving a car for going on 50 years some of you longer than me been driving for 50 years by the grace of God I had got I had been in an accident in probably 30 by the grace of God I want to make that be well known by the grace of God in probably 30 years but I could walk out this door and get behind the wheel of a car and have another r that doesn't mean I all of a sudden become a child I'm not all of a sudden a baby again or someone Unworthy of a of a driver's license I didn't drink I didn't do drugs I wasn't impaired I just made a mistake right you understand what I'm saying yes that's the point I'm trying to make amen it doesn't mean you're you're not mature you just made a mistake slipped up said something you shouldn't thought something you should whatever but you make it right to the Lord oh God forgive me remember get a hold of yourself Lord forgive me I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that I didn't mean to act that way I didn't mean to be like that but we're still sticky in this sticky Cleber flesh with leav still with Le amen praise the Lord let's go I want to finish this over to U uh First Corinthians I want to read this before we go back over to acts 1 Corinthians I want to leave off with acts because that's kind of going to Kickstart us into next week Lord willing look now it's the rising of the sun oh this is beautiful look notice while you're turning there to First Corinthians um uh ver chapter 15 1 Corinthians chapter 15 notice he said it was the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead praise the Lord God's first corn of wheat now let's look as we read this I'll finish that in a minute but let's read 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 12 now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching Vain and your faith also vain yay and we are found false Witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so uh raise he he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised and if Christ be not be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished oh God have mercy amen what a horrible picture that would be if in the 19th verse if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are all men most miserable right shall I emphasize that I don't think I need to I think you you know what it means yes you know what he's talking about if this is if this is all we have to look forward to Saints kill me now I I I still would rather deal with what's on the other side than what I'm dealing with now if this is all we got we are for certain uh a people most miserable amen thank God that's not it 21st but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that that slept right why because he's the first one that rose from the dead right praise the Lord for Since By Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all died even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ of first fruits afterward afterward they that are Christ at his coming praise the Lord so in this last day we know there's to be a resurrection we know there's to be a rapture we know that there's going to be life come on to this bride at the place and and those that sleep in Christ the where they will rise first they will appear unto many as they did in the scripture and they'll be with us in on the 40 days and they will all be caught up together with to meet the Lord in the air praise the Lord because he raised we can raise he was the first fruits praise the Lord now look there's got to be a time to where we all after that after that example come to a newness of Life come to a newness of the word notice through the church ages as we've said they as reformers probed at the word they brought what they had they brought what G God gave them the just shall live by just go back to Luther the just shall live by faith in Luther remember that was an in part but it was what God gave them and those that lived to that in that day were bride amen but when it switched over to a new day with Wesley Wesley introduced sanctification God gave a little more light right and as that little more light came onto that message sanctification was still only in part right but those that lived to that part they lived to that word they lived to what they knew they were bride yes remember seven sabbaths to this time now that had to come a time where there was a restoration of the gifts according to the scripture amen Joel said it in the last days Peter said it in the last days this is not what you say they are not drunk as you suppose the these are a fulfillment of the Prophet Joel that said he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh amen your young man shall see Visions your old man shall dream dreams right it's it's God unleashing his Spirit once again now when that died out through the church ages because that corn of wheat had to go on the ground and die and rot to come back to what a new life there had to be new life again that's the cycle of life amen the cycle of life every year you see seed planted you see growth coming forth you see plants amen winter comes around well maybe not in tuon most places when the winter comes around the plant dies the plant goes dormant doesn't die it goes dormant now some hot bed plants they might die the ones you got a baby and pamper and treat like they're queen and king and all you know them around they they they'll die when it comes when it comes time for the real Showdown they they die and go away but a true uh oak tree when that winter comes around it just takes it and that life comes back in it goes dormant the leaves fall off but what happens in the next spring when the sun comes the the the newness of that sun comes back up again and that tree starts filling and starts shaking and that leaves the Life Starts coming back out on the limbs again the leaves start coming out the acorns start coming back out again you look and see that's an oak tree praise the Lord because of the life that's in it the life identifies what it is the life identified it through those ages and the same thing God did through the church ages that that weat had to go on the ground and die and rot to Res to resurrect again to come back again to New Life and as the stalk came and the the the just shall live by faith and then the the the blade and the sanctification and then the Shu with the restoration of the gifts when the rest restoration of the gifts came that there was shouting and screaming and gifts manifesting and all this going we talked on last week but the word says that when that which is perfect is come that which is in part in part shall be done away with well if justification is part then we do away with it we don't need justification anymore right but see that's that's not the way it works all we do is we don't major on a minor anymore justification is just one step to get you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the indwelling presence of Christ in your soul amen that's just one step the next step is sanctification amen praise the Lord the next step is brings you into Calvary brings you to death to self right brings you to newness of Life yes brings you to not your life but his life in you praise the lord well after that restoration of the gifts and all this going on and and and the and and the splattering of the spirit all over everybody there had to be something bring to a mature a place of maturity to control all that not to do away with it but again like we said last week to bring it into its proper place Amen to bring it into its uh uh into its useful position yes to understand as mature Christians you don't interrupt the ministry by standing up and speaking in tongues anymore or standing up and prophesying or getting and running around the building that's out of order we don't want things out of order we want things in order everything needs to be decently and in order praise the Lord nothing wrong with the gifts gifts are wonderful thank God for them nothing wrong with justification justification is necessary justification is what makes you the your sin never exist in God again right amen amen justification means you never did it in the first place so if you don't want justification friend I'm afraid you're in you're a heap of trouble yes justification says you never did it to begin with yes praise the Lord God puts it in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered anymore not against you it'll lay on the head of Satan till it Le till the day of judgment he'll be held guilty and accountable for it but not you right praise God because the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness amen praise the Lord and it brings us to a newness of Life yes so there had to be a prophet for this last day amen there had to be a prophet for this last day Malachi prophesies on this many scripture that prophesy would read uh uh uh Luke 17:30 uh even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed there had to be a time where there it it had to finish all that was started had to be finished cuz this is the finished day this is the finished age this is the finished time the seventh Church age goes on to predition the bride age with the bride goes into a Rapture yes so there had to be a prophet to come and take all this loose ends and tie them all together yes amen and preach a message of Truth to a bride to bring that bride after the seventh sabbaths to a place of Liberation to a place of Jubilee to a place of freedom and there's no greater Freedom that you could ever have have than when you come to the place of maturity amen now a lot of times we consider mature age as humans uh when you reach 16 you can get a driver's license when you reach 18 you can vote which is way too low but anyway probably the driving is too uh way too low anyway when you get to the age of 18 so we go by age not maturity level right most excuse me men but most Mal's frontal cortex brain ain't even fully developed until they're 21 22 23 years old but they can voted 18 yeah God help us 16 can drive 3,000lb bullet down the road they can vote 18 Lord knows who they put in office at 21 they can drink hard liquor alcohol can drink at 21 so we put ages on things instead of maturity levels but that's not the way God does right God doesn't put age on it he puts maturity level on it God will only handle God will only let you handle give you that of the word that you can handle he'll only give you that of the word that you can handle God's not going to choke you to death with too much at one time uh he'll give to you as you have need of and and even brother say he give you things he'll reveal things to you as you have need of knowing them right amen as you have need of knowing them so well I have had a need of knowing this well maybe that's why the Lord hasn't brought it to you yet amen but there had to be a prophet with a message that brought this bride it down to the church ages but this last day bride from Leo deia into a bright age to bring her to a place of maturity because that's what God is coming he's coming for a bride amen again I've said this several times I'm going to say it again he's not coming for a little girl he's coming for a bride again I thought it was unusual that that man that wrote that article was writing A dissension of this message but then he wrote in dissension that we use the phrase message and bride I'm like have you read the Bible amen right you know that those that is in the Bible right right he's making fun like why would they be talking about bride because it's in the scripture God is going to have a bride a woman woman mature so this had to come to a place of mature in this last day because this last day is the day that takes the Rapture amen this is the time that God comes and takes his children home is now yes in this mature age where the where where it it's no longer several stalks loose we took the God took care of that on the day of Pentecost amen it's no longer that it's it's no longer children just poking here and there and speaking in tongues and and and again nothing wrong with that as long as it's in its place amen but not acting like children in order decent in order amen as mature Christians handling situations as mature Christians amen God help us God help me I certainly need help in that in that area as mature Christians so when God looks he sees a mature bride not a child anymore who knows how to handle the word remember word with Revelation is Godly amen power with character is Godly yes the word with proper with God's revelation is Godly amen and the bride will use it yes as God gives her utterance to use it right otherwise she's quiet she doesn't she's s still unless he gives her thus sayith the Lord right amen and when it's thus sayeth the Lord It's from God yes she knows how to handle the word yeah she knows how to handle be a mature Christian amen no longer a child look on the day of Pentecost I'm going to read this acts two when the day of Pentecost was fully come fully come they were all with one Accord in one place when it was fully come I didn't mean it was when they first got up there right but when it was fully come that's when they got into one mind and one Accord yes and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind there's that wave sheep again waving over why because he was the first one that came to maturity he was the first one that resurrected from the dead now he's coming back onto the believer as he promised he would do in John 14 he's coming back on the believer and as this sound comes in as as a rushing Mighty Wind it filled all the house where they were setting amen amen I pray that for our services every Sunday amen amen fill all this house Lord where we will be sitting let your spirit be felt by everyone down to the kids down to the children let your spirit be felt yes amen I've been in Services friend him before when the Holy Spirit comes so thick that the children were screaming and cutting up and and carrying on because of children amen little children and when the spirit come and fell in that place those children went dead silent they didn't go to sleep they didn't die but the spirit of God moved in there and even the little children felt it yes and they were quiet to where the spirit of God could move in that congregation amongst those people and have his way and every whomever was willing to receive and let the Lord move into their lives yes amen the children went quiet my wife can tell it's the truth amen they would come quiet praise the Lord because that that's that's what we want I tell you that's what I wanten Lord come and let that Spirit fill all the house yes all the house where we will be sitting amen praise the Lord it filled all the house all 120 of them and there appeared unto them that wave sheep was waving over them again and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them again the Dual Purpose here that Spirit of God came like fire and it sat upon each of them and and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they didn't just get a mingling Saints they got a mingling and an indwelling they didn't just get an on they got an on and an in amen the Holy Spirit came down on them and anointed them yes but he also filled them with his spirit amen praise God the simple anoint anointing is not good enough a simple anointing there's people all over the world it's just Devils as they can be have an anointing CA the rain falls on the just and the unjust the scripture tells us that the rain falls on the just and the unjust so a devil's out there and speaking tongues and pencils stand up and write in unknown tongues and operate under those gifts but they're false yeah but what separates is is not only on them but it was in them praise the Lord what did that do that baked them by the Holy Ghost and Fire all together as one loaf praise the Lord Jesus today friend as a bride of Jesus Christ we're just we're one loaf we are one one member we are one person we are we are his wife amen amen the Bride of Jesus Christ his wife as one the all come together and the Holy Spirit was waved over the people again and they're all Anointed with the Holy Ghost and filled with the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and they began to speak with other tongues as the spirit as the spirit gave them utterance right amen not to try to teach them but as the spirit gave them utterance I think I told you I used to have a friend in Charlotte North Carolina and uh he was part of a church that that that was that they belied speaking in tongues with initial evidence of the Holy Ghost and and he would he would literally take people and he told me one time he had one of the sales consultant ladies one of the sales agent ladies out in the parking lot and she wanted to be a Christian and he tried to do I forgot what he said just start jabbering and then before you you jabber two you know for two or three minutes and you start sounding like well probably something I shouldn't say but you start sounding you start sound like a fool you're just jabbering and jabbering because that's all it is it's just it's just Jabber blah blah blah blah blah and and and all of a sudden you've got it now that's it you've got it you've got the Holy Ghost you've been born again oh my what what what what lies of the devil amen but they believe that to be the truth yes but the word says they spake in tongues as the spirit gave them utterance not as some man tried to teach you to jabber but as the spirit gave them utterance and as the spirit gave them utterance that's when they did praise the Lord now in this last day the bride as as mature Christians learn how to harvest that and control that and to bring it forth in order in in in a in a in order in a church in service or wherever they may be don't have to be in church but what whenever the Lord gives utterance but not to be out of turn or out of order that it's made in order that which is part will be done away with that which is in part that the gifts can't major and a minor again will be put in its place praise the Lord so what if that's put in its place cuz see Satan can impersonate any gift so if it's splitting its place then then then what has the preeminence over that it's the word because Christ is the word the word has preeminence over any gift because the word is Christ amen the gift is just something that's a minor gifts God gives us to bless us and encourage us and uplift Us in things and those are wonderful amen but those are minors God give us the word to live by amen praise the Lord and it's the word that we live by it's the word that we stand by now again it was the rising of the sun it was the first corn of wheat of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead praise God God's first corn of Wheat by God's quickening power power God had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruit of those that slept the first fruits he was that sheep praise the Lord that's why they had to wave that sheath for it was the first one that come to maturity was waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest believing that the rest would come because God made a way for the rest to come yes how did he do that on the day of Pentecost which we just just read amen he poured out his Spirit on all of them and then from there went to for whomsoever he will yes amen around the world down through history from whomever he will they were we were the ones that were to come praise the Lord it was a sign today because he was the first Son of God to come to full maturity to be in God plugged from the earth waved over the people by the quickening power Amen Let me just skip on here but this that was the reality that was the reality that first fruit now let me continue further down same message as Christ was the first to race let's look and see it this day I'm going to finish with this because that that's the place we are to be now that we're to we're in the end times friend we're living in the last days we know that there that should not be secret to anyone there's people out in the world that just heathens that know that look and say how much more Humanity can go and the way it's going as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church coming out of the church chur she's the bride the church was the shul that protected the wheat the grain amen amen the bride was the grain the shook the church was the shook to protect it as it grew up and grew forward but as the as the bride the wheat begin to mature the shook begins to pull away and as the shook begins to pull away the wheat sits in the presence of the sun to ripen the the wheat the the chaff the shul falls off to the ground and is driven away with the winds but the wheed is taken into the Garner praise the Lord the mature wheat grain the bride is taken into the Garner the church that protected it the shove is falling off and blows away with the wind but the bride goes in the Rapture yes the bride coming of and the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will be a sheath waved again in the last days the first one to come to maturity when now in this day praise the Lord that God put in in place for us to recognize and see that brought a message that we could follow and understand that that first one that come to maturity was just was just an example people want to people want to worship Him and baptize in him thans that's Antichrist right yeah amen but he was the first to come to maturity yes and it was just an example of what God was doing yes that it wasn't just for him it was for all of us amen we all were to come to that place yes that was just an example to realize that there's more to come and we are that more amen we that bride we are that more we are a part of that people that is the more that God was speaking about that we would come to maturity to come to the place to be counted as one of God's children Amen to be accounted as a portion of God's bride yes amen amen together I don't care where they are I don't care around the world if they're bride we're all together in spirit together by one Spirit we are all baptized into several bodies hundreds of bodies thousands of bodies no one body praise the Lorden one body just like he typed for us in Leviticus one body amen we're all baptized by the Holy Spirit and fire into this one body now that one that come to maturity in this last day oh my it was to be waved again but it was only an example it was only a a a waving to recognize there's more coming oh my waving that sheep what was that sheep the first one to come to maturity the first one that proved it was a wheat proved it was a part of the sheep now look this beautiful picture of redemption amen coming out of the church remember Redemption has two parts out of and into two amen a lot of people might come out but they don't go in right if you come out that's great but that's only half of the Redemption process when you come out you come out but you've got to go into amen you come out of the world to get into Christ if you come out of the world and get into a denomination you're just out you're not in anything but an organization a man-made system you come out of the world and into Christ you're in something yes look coming out out of the church speaking of the Bride now the individual some out of the world into Christ now the church the now the bride coming out of the church come out of the church look what he says now Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people the first time there will come forth for the bride age amen so if we're coming out of the church age there has to be something we go into praise the Lord coming out of the church coming out of leod DEA but into what into the bride age into that maturity of the Bride into that that body that God is very soon coming to take home to be with him out of and into that's the Redemption process for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denomination denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power amen praise God what is that power that power is in the bride how does that bride operate That Power by the character of God Amen power without character is satanic but Power with character is Godly amen this Powers operated by God through his bride praise the lord we are that we are that portion for the full maturity of the word is turned back again waved over the People by the same signs and wonders by the same scripture the same evidences that it did then amen what does it do it produces Sons and Daughters of God yes it does praise the Lord that's who we are Sons and Daughters of God mature in him as Christians as a as a bride as a woman bride wife of Jesus Christ right praise the Lord been waved again now we're we're that par we're that portion that that he promised that if there's a first that's just a promise that there's more to come yes people want to fixate on that first people want to worship that first people want to do all things with the first but the first only came the first only came to bring that mature message to wave over the people so that this bride would come as a many membered body as one forth as the bride of Christ not one man but a many membered body as one in Christ amen praise the Lord that's who we are yes that's who God's called us to be today amen let's let the Lord continue move moving in our lives to bring us to the fullness of that place that we are to live in him because that's what adoption is all about your placement in Him Praise the Lord being in that position of maturity puts us if we can accept it in that in the position of a portion of the body of Christ as as adopted Sons and Daughters of God Amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could God always makes it work yes he does according to his word and his will we follow his will and led by his spirit amen praise the Lord Jesus I want to sing that little course again we sing many times Lord prepare me word Sanctuary
