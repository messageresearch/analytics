[1:46] in the name of our lord jesus christ we
[1:48] pray amen amen amen
[1:52] you could be seated if you like
[1:55] i mean you may not have noticed because
[1:57] um
[1:58] the
[1:59] caretakers in all the building got here
[2:01] a little about about the same time i did
[2:03] actually
[2:04] uh but the building was vandalized last
[2:06] night
[2:09] when i left here yesterday and prayed i
[2:11] prayed over this place
[2:13] or protect it and keep it with
[2:14] everything going on and everything in an
[2:16] attack on the attack on life
[2:19] the attack on churches
[2:22] the attack on just the sanctity of life
[2:25] itself is
[2:26] is happening in this country rampantly
[2:28] now and so i prayed over this place but
[2:31] the people down at the end down here the
[2:33] massage place
[2:35] got their window busted out got their
[2:37] door knob busted
[2:40] some kind of mess was written on the
[2:42] door
[2:44] it was so incoherent i couldn't even
[2:46] really understand it a couple words of
[2:48] it uh busted their doorknob and
[2:52] stuff
[2:53] busted the doorknob on the bathroom back
[2:55] here
[2:56] fortunately the guy came in and got the
[2:58] door knob replaced so you won't even
[2:59] notice that there's anything happen to
[3:01] the bathroom but the doorknob was busted
[3:03] that they weren't able to get into any
[3:05] place
[3:06] but the lord came up kept us in this
[3:08] place safe
[3:10] nothing happened here so thank you i'm
[3:12] very thankful for that but uh it just
[3:15] reminds us to let us know that we
[3:17] continue to uphold
[3:20] this place and
[3:22] the blessings the lord has given us here
[3:24] and expect him to continue to watch over
[3:26] us amen he gave us this place amen he's
[3:30] obligated to take care of us and he has
[3:32] and i believe he will praise the lord so
[3:35] with everything going on saints
[3:37] uh
[3:39] it's never more time to be
[3:41] diligent about the lord yes be in prayer
[3:45] supplication
[3:47] we may have gotten a little stay of
[3:48] grace this week
[3:50] our country as a whole if you will
[3:53] with the
[3:54] with the lifting of the federal murder
[3:57] mandate they've had for almost 50 years
[3:59] so
[4:00] now that that federal has been lifted of
[4:02] course now it
[4:04] doesn't
[4:05] do away with abortion uh but it's to
[4:08] each state now each state can decide
[4:10] what they want and
[4:12] the people of their state can elect the
[4:13] representatives they want to represent
[4:16] them to
[4:17] uh face that situation of they
[4:20] dumb dumbed it down i think this was one
[4:22] of the biggest mistakes that people even
[4:24] christians made
[4:26] years ago by calling it abortion let's
[4:28] call it what it is it's murder
[4:31] and
[4:32] murder sounds harder than abortion
[4:34] fetus sounds a lot better than a
[4:38] human
[4:39] but the fact of it is
[4:41] now that
[4:43] that's happened who knows maybe the lord
[4:45] has
[4:46] extended his grace a little bit longer
[4:49] now for our country don't know
[4:52] believe it's imminent still and we all
[4:55] know that we feel the power the moving
[4:57] of god and how lawless this is getting
[5:00] uh but
[5:01] god protects his own yes god's gonna
[5:03] take care of his children
[5:05] amen and
[5:07] god bless donald trump maybe i shouldn't
[5:09] say that i'm sorry
[5:11] but he's he put those three judges on
[5:14] there and if it weren't for those three
[5:15] judges this would not have happened yes
[5:18] so you say what you want like and hate
[5:20] him
[5:21] whatever
[5:23] god put him in his place so god put him
[5:25] there for a reason
[5:27] so just like joe biden is there for a
[5:29] reason
[5:31] he was there for a reason and if it was
[5:33] this reason if it was nothing else but
[5:35] this reason
[5:36] that
[5:37] we have that little bit of grace again
[5:40] uh the federal mandate of murder has
[5:42] been lifted then
[5:43] praise the lord amen amen god knows what
[5:46] he's doing we might not recognize it
[5:48] right off it may be years down the road
[5:51] but god has his hand on it and i thank
[5:54] god for that amen i also want to
[5:56] apologize uh last week i made a little
[5:58] lighthearted
[6:00] i guess you'd say joke here probably
[6:01] shouldn't have done that but i didn't
[6:03] mean to offend anybody about the
[6:05] political thing and
[6:07] god made man and woman
[6:10] i i
[6:11] i didn't feel just nobody said anything
[6:13] to me nobody said it offended them
[6:16] but i just felt like i needed to say
[6:18] something and if it did offend anybody i
[6:21] apologize i know there's some people
[6:23] that aren't here that were here last
[6:24] week but i don't feel like it did but if
[6:27] it did i apologize i'd keep politics out
[6:31] you know at least as much as possible
[6:33] but um anyway the truth of the matter is
[6:36] it's still the same
[6:37] god only created a man and a woman yes
[6:41] that's it so where you go from the rest
[6:43] of that that's fine but i'll trust and
[6:45] believe the lord jesus
[6:47] he takes care of it all so he is in our
[6:50] lives watch over us protect us keep us

[34:05] jesus christ we pray
[34:07] amen amen
[34:08] amen
[34:09] praise the lord genesis
[34:15] genesis chapter 2.
[34:20] uh we'll just read
[34:21] through the 25th verse and then let you
[34:23] be seated genesis 2 21
[34:28] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to
[34:30] fall upon adam and he slept
[34:33] and he took one of his ribs and closed
[34:35] up the flesh and said thereof
[34:37] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[34:40] from man made he a woman and brought her
[34:42] unto the man
[34:44] and adam said this is now bone of my
[34:46] bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[34:49] called woman because she was taken out
[34:51] of man
[34:53] therefore shall a man leave his father
[34:55] his mother shall cleave unto his wife
[34:57] and they shall be
[34:58] and they shall be one flesh
[35:00] and they're both naked the man and his
[35:02] wife and we're not ashamed
[35:05] you could be seated if you like
[35:09] uh creation of man in the creation of
[35:12] the woman
[35:13] uh the woman being brought out of the
[35:14] man we know i want to read a couple
[35:17] other scriptures before we uh really
[35:19] delve into this now i want to continue
[35:21] on with chapter 3 verse 1.
[35:24] amen as we've
[35:26] gotten to this creation of the woman and
[35:29] um i want to speak on something today
[35:32] that um
[35:34] that i've talked to you about and that
[35:37] came on my heart this week and this
[35:39] weekend
[35:42] it probably is maybe a little
[35:44] controversial to some people
[35:46] uh to me uh and of course some things
[35:49] the lord revealed to me this weekend uh
[35:51] alleviated a lot of that in my heart
[35:53] because as you know and as i've said
[35:56] saints uh if i don't feel like i have a
[35:59] full revelation of what the lord is
[36:02] intending to bring i just i don't i
[36:04] don't bring it i don't preach it i'm not
[36:07] going to
[36:07] do that
[36:08] and i say that because i have done that
[36:10] in the past years ago uh never here but
[36:14] years ago
[36:16] when i was living in florida
[36:18] i think i told you before i would preach
[36:20] something just because i heard another
[36:21] minister preach it
[36:22] early in my ministry and
[36:25] and i was watching a video one time of
[36:27] of a brother and minister and i was
[36:29] taking notes and i was thinking wow wow
[36:31] and the lord spoke to me and he told me
[36:33] to stop doing that
[36:34] uh i could go to you in all the detail
[36:36] but when the lord told me to stop doing
[36:38] that i stopped doing it i stopped
[36:41] really even listening to other ministers
[36:43] now if i'm in another church or somebody
[36:45] else is preaching or preaching here or
[36:47] something that's different but to get a
[36:49] video or
[36:50] audio or something out once in a while
[36:52] somebody said well this is just
[36:53] outstanding i'll listen to it or watch
[36:55] it or something but i don't make it a
[36:56] habit i don't get online searching other
[36:58] churches and other uh streamings and
[37:01] things like that um
[37:04] i probably wouldn't do it anyway but i
[37:07] the primary reason is that the lord told
[37:10] me not to yeah so i don't
[37:13] and the lord tells you not to do
[37:14] something you don't do it right if he
[37:16] tells you to do something you do it
[37:18] man so he tells me not to do it then i
[37:20] don't do it so unless it's something i
[37:23] feel that the lord has settled in my
[37:24] heart and brought a revelation of it um
[37:27] then i put it on the shelf until that
[37:29] time comes
[37:31] but
[37:31] now i want to continue so we've got the
[37:33] creation here uh man has been created he
[37:36] was created a spirit man god had put him
[37:38] in flesh planted him in the garden of
[37:41] eden in in in a flesh body just like a
[37:44] tree
[37:44] uh david as we know talked about man
[37:46] being planted like a tree by the rivers
[37:49] of water and adam being planted in the
[37:51] garden of eden like a tree that was
[37:53] there
[37:54] god brought forth man and then from the
[37:56] man god brought forth a woman and she
[37:58] was called woman by god because
[38:01] she came from the man
[38:03] she was not a part of the original
[38:05] creation she was
[38:06] something that god had brought out of
[38:08] the original creation uh adam was in the
[38:11] original creation at this time
[38:14] uh the woman as will referred to her
[38:17] here was not actually called eve
[38:20] as you know adam did not give eve her
[38:23] name
[38:24] until after the fall
[38:26] eve did not receive her name until after
[38:28] the fall until after she was impregnated
[38:32] right that's the only time adam called
[38:34] her eve for the simple fact that eve
[38:38] the name eve is the mother of all living
[38:42] and because she was the mother of all
[38:45] living because of what had just happened
[38:47] he called her eve so the twins that she
[38:50] was carrying was her to bring forth so
[38:53] that at that time is when
[38:56] uh
[38:58] adam named her eve so at this point
[39:00] still just the white the woman if you
[39:02] will uh naked not ashamed that we're
[39:05] living in a place of holiness of course
[39:07] now the third chapter
[39:09] first verse now the serpent
[39:11] was more subtle than any beast of the
[39:14] field which the lord god had made now i
[39:17] want to reiterate to you as i have in
[39:19] the past look at the word subtle the
[39:22] word subtle means beguiling trickery
[39:26] but it also means sensible now i've said
[39:29] this before
[39:30] but i just want to reiterate to you to
[39:32] bring it that back to your remembrance
[39:34] the word subtle doesn't only mean
[39:36] beguiling it doesn't only mean trickery
[39:38] and conniving it means
[39:40] sensible so the device is that the enemy
[39:44] this helps us to understand the devices
[39:46] of the enemy so we can see now as the
[39:48] devices of the enemy were in the garden
[39:50] of eden are the same today if they were
[39:54] subtle trickery conniving and sensible
[39:57] then they will be the same today right
[40:00] so what he was bringing to her
[40:03] made sense
[40:05] it made sense to her as she processed it
[40:08] it made sense to her so as she was
[40:11] subtle made sense coming but but the
[40:14] sense he was bringing was for deception
[40:17] amen for deception it's just like god
[40:20] created the heaven and the earth god
[40:22] created all the medical things he
[40:25] created all the scientific everything
[40:27] the scientists learned and everything
[40:28] that scientists come up with but you see
[40:30] out of all that is god's creation how
[40:33] man has taken that and twisted it
[40:36] against god and tried to prove by god's
[40:39] creation that he doesn't even exist
[40:43] they've taken his own creation to try to
[40:46] prove he doesn't exist right so you see
[40:49] making sense is not
[40:52] revelation
[40:54] revelation sometimes is not sensible to
[40:57] the human
[40:58] it's not has god ever revealed something
[41:01] to you through his word through the
[41:02] message that you look at and say well
[41:04] that just doesn't make sense
[41:07] but god's revealed it to you so you know
[41:09] it's right i've listened to brother
[41:11] brown sometimes and i think you know
[41:12] that just doesn't make sense but then
[41:15] when when you look in the word and god
[41:17] reveals it to you and you can put it in
[41:18] place you say well it's not supposed to
[41:21] make sense it's god
[41:22] god's ways are so much higher than ours
[41:25] god's faults are so much higher than
[41:27] ours man
[41:28] our little p brains can't even begin to
[41:30] comprehend the mind of god yes we can't
[41:32] even begin to approach or even think
[41:34] about approaching the mind of god in
[41:36] that way so what looks and sounds
[41:38] sensible to us which usually elicits the
[41:42] faculties of our see case still smell
[41:44] here or our
[41:45] reason conscious infection memory
[41:48] of our spirit
[41:50] those sensible things aren't the things
[41:52] that contact god right it's not the
[41:54] things that god's concerned about it's
[41:55] not the things that we are concerned
[41:58] about the things we're concerned about
[41:59] is of the soul
[42:00] the real person that you are that part
[42:03] of god that god planted in you before
[42:05] the foundation of the world that soul
[42:07] that was an attribute of god that was in
[42:09] god's mind before the foundation of the
[42:11] world
[42:12] you were part of god that's why he
[42:14] planted that seed in you
[42:16] which we probably won't get to today
[42:18] planted that seed in you that became you
[42:21] who you really are
[42:22] not this guy not the one you're looking
[42:24] at not the seed tastes still smell here
[42:27] the spirit and
[42:28] and concentrates infection memory but
[42:30] that that contacts god
[42:33] amen
[42:34] praise the lord that's sensible now
[42:37] that's the thing that that that is
[42:39] beguiling that's the thing that beguiles
[42:41] today that's the thing that throws
[42:43] people off because they can't understand
[42:46] because they're only looking at the word
[42:48] of god through
[42:50] and i say this to try to lay a
[42:51] foundation so give me a moment but
[42:54] they
[42:55] they try to
[42:56] approach god on an intellectual level
[43:00] they try to worship god they try to
[43:03] serve god with their minds instead of
[43:06] their hearts right they try to
[43:08] attack or or approach god's word with an
[43:12] intellectual understanding instead of
[43:14] revelation of the spirit
[43:16] and when you try to do that the only way
[43:18] you can
[43:20] can
[43:21] filter through it is to try to make it
[43:24] make sense to your intellect
[43:27] and if it's making sense to your
[43:29] intellect a lot of times i almost say
[43:31] this made strange but a lot of times if
[43:34] you're trying to make sense to it to
[43:35] your intellect it's probably wrong yeah
[43:38] that's right
[43:39] right because it's got to come by
[43:41] revelation yes and the problem that a
[43:43] lot of times people have is they don't
[43:45] approach the word by revelation they
[43:47] approach it by an intellectual
[43:49] conception and when you approach it by
[43:51] then i don't mean just denominations i
[43:53] mean people that's in this message and
[43:55] try to approach the word the message
[43:57] with an intellectual conception
[44:00] instead of by revelation of god's word
[44:02] yes and see when it's not sensible then
[44:05] people can't receive it but we don't
[44:08] receive it because it makes sense we
[44:10] receive it because god reveals it to us
[44:13] god shows it to us now does some things
[44:15] that we read through make human sense
[44:17] sure it does
[44:19] but a lot of the more
[44:22] deeper things that god brings to us that
[44:25] that comes from the very depths of god's
[44:27] mind and even through a prophet today
[44:30] a lot of times doesn't make common sense
[44:33] because this is
[44:34] because it's following along with god's
[44:37] word why would god do this and see
[44:40] people blame god for those things too
[44:42] they took us well
[44:44] let's just say yuvaldi for an example
[44:46] where was god when those children are
[44:49] being murdered
[44:50] it doesn't make sense
[44:52] but see when you have a revelation to
[44:53] understand what's going on then then
[44:57] it becomes a revelation you're gonna say
[44:59] well it makes sense then
[45:00] that's just our human word but it's god
[45:03] revealing himself is god helping you
[45:05] understand who he is
[45:08] and to grasp the mind of god
[45:10] to be able to get into the mind of god
[45:13] so that these things become something
[45:15] that's a part of you not just your
[45:17] intellect see
[45:19] brother random
[45:20] i thought about ministering this at some
[45:22] time but but brother brandon brought a
[45:24] part where in the beginning a little
[45:27] dramatization
[45:28] that when the fall
[45:31] in heaven took place and and satan god
[45:34] gave satan a choice
[45:37] do you want the han or do you want the
[45:39] the heart or the mind right
[45:42] satan took the mind right god took the
[45:45] heart
[45:47] so satan
[45:49] inherently is going to use the mind to
[45:51] deceive
[45:52] well how is he going to use the mind to
[45:54] deceive well he's got to make it make
[45:56] sense to you
[45:58] just like he did even the garden of eden
[46:00] he has to make it make sense
[46:03] there's got to be something that takes
[46:05] you beyond what is the revelation of the
[46:07] word to cause you to do what is against
[46:10] the word
[46:13] now that being said
[46:14] let's continue on remember
[46:17] something that is against the word
[46:19] also remember
[46:21] adam
[46:22] was the original creation of god eve
[46:25] came from adam she was not the original
[46:28] creation she was she was a she was a a
[46:32] feminist spirit that god took out of him
[46:35] so that he would not be alone that he
[46:37] could have a help mate a wife a
[46:38] companion
[46:40] now he was more subtle
[46:44] than any beast of the field which the
[46:46] lord god had made now understand this is
[46:48] the serpent
[46:50] the serpent was the instrument that the
[46:53] devil used
[46:55] this is not the devil
[46:57] okay
[46:58] this is not the devil this is a serpent
[47:00] this is a created being of god an animal
[47:04] that was there that god had created amen
[47:07] amen he was just the leak
[47:10] that the devil was able to use to bring
[47:14] the begotten right okay
[47:17] i hear people all the time eve had sex
[47:19] with the devil no she didn't
[47:22] that satan is a spirit being right he
[47:26] was a flesh being you can't have a flesh
[47:29] being having a relationship intimate
[47:31] relationship with a spirit being like
[47:32] that it doesn't work
[47:35] he had to incarnate himself in someone
[47:38] that could do it
[47:40] and that was the serpent right
[47:43] the only seed that could cross
[47:46] that was the only seed that god created
[47:49] in in
[47:50] pardon this word but in god's evolution
[47:53] it was the only place the only one had a
[47:57] seed that could mix with the human was
[47:58] the serpent
[48:00] you go lower than that serpent down to
[48:02] the monkey the gorilla whatever his seed
[48:04] won't mix none other will mix and of
[48:06] course the serpents won't now either
[48:08] because god cursed him on his belly
[48:10] right but he's the only one that can mix
[48:13] so and the one that satan could use to
[48:16] beguile eat
[48:17] eve did not have relations with the
[48:19] devil in that capacity this is a serpent
[48:23] that has been incarnated by the devil
[48:27] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[48:30] said ye shall not eat of every tree of
[48:32] the garden now that's a question
[48:35] question is
[48:36] to eve to the woman
[48:39] by the serpent
[48:40] god has said you shall not eat of every
[48:42] tree of the garden
[48:44] he's questioning her
[48:47] and the woman said unto the serpent now
[48:49] notice
[48:52] nowhere before this
[48:54] does it say because we just read the
[48:56] creation of a woman
[48:58] nowhere in the scripture does it say
[49:00] that god told eve
[49:03] not to partake of that tree of that
[49:05] fruit
[49:06] nowhere
[49:08] he didn't tell her
[49:09] he told adam right amen
[49:12] but she knew
[49:13] what it was
[49:15] how did she know
[49:17] because her head told her yes because
[49:19] adam told her
[49:20] only way she could have known he said
[49:22] well how do you know that the bible
[49:23] doesn't say that how else do you think
[49:26] she knew what god said except that adam
[49:28] told her
[49:31] amen
[49:32] she wasn't of the original she was
[49:34] living on adam's experience that god
[49:37] told him
[49:39] the most dangerous place that you can be
[49:41] today especially young people
[49:44] the worst place that you can live today
[49:46] is on your mom and daddy's experience
[49:48] right right even if they have a good
[49:51] godly experience you cannot live on
[49:54] their experience
[49:56] you cannot live on your children's you
[49:58] cannot live on your spouses you cannot
[50:00] live on your grandparents you have to
[50:03] live on your own experience right man
[50:05] now eve didn't have it at the time
[50:07] saints but there is no excuse for any of
[50:09] us today not to have our own experience
[50:12] with the lord jesus i don't have to live
[50:14] my life in a certain way because brother
[50:17] branham said
[50:18] right i live my life the way i do
[50:21] because god said so to me
[50:24] personally not to him to me
[50:28] but to me personally
[50:30] god's got to speak to you personally
[50:34] so you have your own experience you have
[50:36] your own relationship you have your own
[50:39] uh
[50:40] spirit of god in you
[50:43] without it you are deceivable yes yes
[50:47] if you're only living on someone else's
[50:49] experience you're you are deceivable
[50:52] look at this
[50:54] eve knew she said the woman said
[50:57] not eve the woman said unto the serpent
[51:00] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[51:01] the garden but of the fruit of the tree
[51:03] which is in the midst of the garden god
[51:06] has said ye shall not eat it neither
[51:08] shall ye touch it lest she die how does
[51:10] she know that
[51:14] how did she know that
[51:17] only two people there that could have
[51:18] told her right
[51:21] and that's out
[51:22] she couldn't have known it any other way
[51:24] god didn't tell her
[51:26] and if you go over to the curses after
[51:28] they fail
[51:29] god doesn't hold eve responsible for
[51:32] that he held adam responsible for that
[51:34] right you notice the curses the only
[51:37] curse god gave the woman is i will
[51:39] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[51:41] conception and sorrow thou shalt bring
[51:42] four children thy desire to be sure that
[51:44] husband and he shall rule over thee
[51:46] that's that's the penalty that god laid
[51:48] on her yes
[51:50] he didn't say because you did what i
[51:53] told you not to do no he told adam that
[51:56] the next says unto adam because thou has
[51:58] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife has
[52:00] not uh and has eaten of the tree which i
[52:03] commanded thee
[52:05] saying thou shall not eat of it curses
[52:07] the ground so god held him responsible
[52:10] for what he told him
[52:12] not eve
[52:14] adam
[52:15] adam was held responsible for it so adam
[52:19] had to be the one to tell eve
[52:22] and eve then relays this same message
[52:26] oh i i got a quote for you serpent
[52:29] the quote
[52:30] is
[52:32] we can eat of every fruit but not the
[52:34] one in the midst of the garden
[52:36] oh i got a quote people in this message
[52:38] got quotes coming out the years friend
[52:40] we got enough quotes to paper this wall
[52:42] plus
[52:44] amen but where is the experience yeah
[52:47] that's right amen
[52:49] she had plenty of quotes
[52:51] she could quote adam verbatim oh this is
[52:55] what god said it was a quote from adam
[52:57] this is what he said
[52:59] but where was the experience
[53:01] amen
[53:03] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[53:05] shall not surely die
[53:08] for god doth know that in the day you
[53:10] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[53:12] and ye shall be as god knowing good and
[53:14] evil now is that true
[53:16] did the serpent lie to her
[53:20] serpent didn't lie to her that's
[53:21] absolutely true that's exactly what
[53:23] happened when they partook of the fruit
[53:26] that's exactly what took place he wasn't
[53:27] lying to them he was just deceiving them
[53:31] he was taking god's own words and using
[53:34] it against them right just like people
[53:36] do today yeah it god's own creation and
[53:39] try to prove that he doesn't exist
[53:42] he was taking god's own words
[53:45] and deceiving her with it he twisted it
[53:47] just a little bit
[53:49] just enough
[53:51] to make her believe oh that makes sense
[53:53] oh that sounds good that sounds
[53:55] appealing
[53:57] amen
[54:00] and when the woman saw the tree was good
[54:02] for food and then it was pleasant to the
[54:03] eye and a tree to be desired to make one
[54:05] wise she took of the fruit thereof and
[54:07] did eat and gave also unto her husband
[54:10] with her and he didn't
[54:13] now they've both partaken of it
[54:16] but there's a difference in the two
[54:18] adam the word
[54:21] original creation spoken word of god was
[54:24] the word himself
[54:26] if
[54:27] the woman a byproduct
[54:29] someone that came out of the original
[54:32] creation not a part of the original
[54:34] creation thus deceivable
[54:37] amen deceivable why because she had what
[54:41] she had adam's experience not her own
[54:44] look at this now first timothy
[54:52] first timothy chapter 2.
[55:02] first timothy chapter 2
[55:05] verse 11.
[55:16] first timothy chapter 2
[55:19] verse 11 says this
[55:22] let the woman learn in silence with all
[55:25] subjection
[55:27] but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to
[55:30] usurp authority over the man
[55:33] but to be in silence
[55:35] for adam was first formed then eve
[55:40] and adam look at this now
[55:42] adam was not deceived
[55:46] adam was not deceived but the woman
[55:49] being deceived
[55:51] was in the transgression
[55:54] adam was not in the transgression right
[55:57] eve was
[55:59] adam was not deceived eve was
[56:03] now
[56:05] i wanna i didn't know what the title is
[56:07] so i'm just gonna call it
[56:09] willfully versus deceived
[56:13] because there's a difference
[56:15] in doing something willfully
[56:17] and doing it by deception
[56:20] eve did it because she was deceived into
[56:23] doing it
[56:24] she was not of the original creation
[56:27] she was
[56:29] a byproduct of the original creation now
[56:33] that
[56:34] the woman was in the beginning you see
[56:36] why it's such a blessed thing
[56:40] for a sister especially
[56:43] to be born again and to live a godly
[56:46] holy ghost-filled life saint amen
[56:51] i always attend to the fact that
[56:54] y'all have the greater blessing in my
[56:55] opinion
[56:57] people always talk about how brother
[56:58] brown was a woman hater and priest
[56:59] against women no no no he preached
[57:02] against ungodly women right so what does
[57:04] that mean for the godly sister
[57:07] you godly sisters what does that mean
[57:10] for you to me it's the greater blessing
[57:14] amen for you to be able to live above
[57:16] that
[57:18] and and to be
[57:20] obedient to god his word
[57:23] it is a greater blessing
[57:25] it is
[57:26] i i don't say it's easy
[57:29] it probably isn't anything
[57:30] easy about it
[57:32] but the greater blessing
[57:34] in my opinion i believe but adam was not
[57:38] deceived why was adam not deceived well
[57:40] adam did the same thing she did
[57:43] adam partook of it just like she did
[57:46] she did it from the serpent and she gave
[57:47] it to him
[57:50] she fell and he fell so what's the
[57:52] difference adam was the word
[57:56] adam being the word could not be
[57:58] deceived he knew exactly what he was
[58:00] doing
[58:01] he walked out into that sin
[58:04] knowing what he was doing
[58:07] it was deceived she didn't do it
[58:09] purposely
[58:10] eve did not though she didn't bring
[58:12] about the fall of all the humanity and
[58:14] the sin and everything that happened she
[58:16] didn't do that because she wanted to
[58:19] she didn't do that because she desired
[58:21] to it wasn't a part of her she was
[58:23] deceived into doing it
[58:25] but being deceived she was able to bring
[58:28] the transgression now
[58:31] adam had to pay the price for what he
[58:34] did
[58:34] because god told him you do this and
[58:37] this is what's going to happen
[58:40] you do this and this is what's going to
[58:42] happen now did god do what he said he
[58:44] was going to do
[58:45] absolutely adam fell when adam fell all
[58:48] of creation fell
[58:50] and when all of creation fell it fell
[58:53] into a sin condition and brought it to
[58:55] the place we know it to be today that's
[58:57] why every one of us is coming and
[58:59] through a sex act into a sinful life
[59:03] every one of us born in a sin shaped
[59:04] iniquity come the world speaking lives
[59:06] that's why there needs to be a
[59:07] transformation that's why there has to
[59:09] be a a a a redemption
[59:12] a a purchase of a of a perfect
[59:15] sacrifice's blood to bring us back into
[59:18] fellowship with god again yes that's the
[59:21] only way it could happen
[59:22] god was able to do that by bringing it
[59:25] forth his own son
[59:26] the second adam
[59:28] but adam notice
[59:30] she was not the word
[59:33] excuse me eve was not the word
[59:37] she was a byproduct of the word and she
[59:39] took upon herself what she was told and
[59:42] she lived by it until she was able to be
[59:45] deceived
[59:47] when she was deceived she created the
[59:49] transgression and adam seeing that
[59:52] transgression
[59:53] fully knowing what he was doing walked
[59:56] out into sin to redeem her
[59:59] to bring her back
[1:00:00] because god he knew god would have
[1:00:02] killed her
[1:00:03] if he didn't become sin himself right he
[1:00:06] took upon himself that sin dares i say
[1:00:08] now
[1:00:10] this is not scriptural friend
[1:00:12] but this is how i see it
[1:00:15] i i and i'm i'm not saying brother brown
[1:00:17] said this i'm saying it
[1:00:19] to me that was a righteous act you say
[1:00:21] how could that be
[1:00:23] going and doing what he did and falling
[1:00:25] in sin and causing all creation to fall
[1:00:27] was a righteous act if god if adam had
[1:00:30] not done that god would have destroyed
[1:00:31] his wife it was a it was a precursor of
[1:00:35] jesus christ yes it was jesus christ i
[1:00:39] wide open walking into sin and taking
[1:00:42] sin on himself to redeem his lost bride
[1:00:47] it was the only way it could be done the
[1:00:49] very righteous act of god becoming sin
[1:00:52] hallelujah saved us amen him becoming me
[1:00:57] so that i could become him
[1:00:59] he took even to his bosom
[1:01:02] and he became sin himself
[1:01:04] so that she would be redeemed knowing
[1:01:07] that they would be ejected knowing they
[1:01:08] would be separated from god he knew that
[1:01:11] god would still do what he said he was
[1:01:12] going to do but he was not deceived
[1:01:16] he was not in the transgression because
[1:01:18] he was not deceived
[1:01:20] being not deceived then there's not a
[1:01:22] transgression it's
[1:01:24] it's
[1:01:25] the thing that helped me the most saints
[1:01:27] is
[1:01:28] is a lot of what the lord's been giving
[1:01:30] us here yeah and recognizing who you are
[1:01:34] knowing there's no leaven
[1:01:36] no living no sin there's no sin
[1:01:39] accounted to you now we have to go back
[1:01:41] in our minds as i delve a little deeper
[1:01:44] into this we got to go back into our
[1:01:46] minds and recognize thought about
[1:01:47] drawing it again but i figured you all
[1:01:49] had it in your minds
[1:01:51] go back again to that trying to be
[1:01:54] we are trial beings
[1:01:58] we are body and spirit who live in a
[1:02:00] fallen condition
[1:02:02] but we are also soul
[1:02:04] down on the inside of the inside is the
[1:02:07] soul of man
[1:02:08] and that soul that's where 10 million
[1:02:11] worlds is the property that god is
[1:02:13] concerned about
[1:02:15] not this body not even the human spirit
[1:02:18] but the soul of man now the body in that
[1:02:21] condition the mind that satan chose can
[1:02:24] be deceived
[1:02:27] it can be
[1:02:28] because our bodies have not received a
[1:02:30] body change to be word bodies yet when
[1:02:34] their word bodies cannot be deceived
[1:02:37] because the word cannot be deceived
[1:02:39] amen
[1:02:41] the soul that god has converted that god
[1:02:44] has taken permanent residence in by the
[1:02:46] holy ghost sealing his own presence in
[1:02:49] there cannot be deceived which is who
[1:02:52] you really are now the body the mind the
[1:02:55] flesh the spirit can be deceived
[1:02:59] it can cause you to do things you should
[1:03:01] not do
[1:03:03] trapped
[1:03:04] mistaken
[1:03:06] into doing
[1:03:07] but that's why we have that sacrifice of
[1:03:10] the blood still laying on that mercy
[1:03:12] seat still taking our place still making
[1:03:14] intercession on my behalf
[1:03:16] it's there it's still there when we ask
[1:03:19] and call for god for repentance now
[1:03:22] i want to get to something before we
[1:03:23] close today i hope i can this is
[1:03:26] probably going to go into next week but
[1:03:28] i want to try to get to something
[1:03:29] because
[1:03:31] i want to attack a very misunderstood
[1:03:33] scripture
[1:03:35] but we'll get to that but
[1:03:37] to understand that as the word
[1:03:41] you cannot be deceived right and people
[1:03:43] try to say well uh i i'm perfect i have
[1:03:46] no sin in your flesh and your spirit you
[1:03:49] cannot say that right
[1:03:51] that's why that sacrifice is still there
[1:03:53] for us yes and when people try to get
[1:03:56] get away with that blood to do away with
[1:03:58] the blood what do you do about the
[1:04:01] situations of our bodies and our spirits
[1:04:03] that have not yet been redeemed
[1:04:05] not not the completion or the
[1:04:07] fulfillment of the redemption
[1:04:09] when the blood of jesus christ dripped
[1:04:11] the chemical of the blood and the life
[1:04:13] of the blood came back upon the
[1:04:15] worshiper lives in you and takes
[1:04:17] permanent resident and has changed your
[1:04:19] soul
[1:04:20] you're a new creature
[1:04:22] but the chemistry of the blood that
[1:04:25] drift into the earth
[1:04:27] actually redeemed this earth by that
[1:04:29] blood back to the original owner
[1:04:32] well who did where did you come from
[1:04:36] where did this thing come from from dust
[1:04:38] thou art told dust your return
[1:04:40] well if this body came from that dust
[1:04:43] and that blood has dripped into that
[1:04:45] dust then what does that do for you
[1:04:47] it has redeemed your very body spirit
[1:04:51] and soul but the body and the spirit
[1:04:54] have not been completely
[1:04:56] not been completed yet right amen we're
[1:04:58] still living in this sin world and this
[1:05:00] time body and this sinful condition but
[1:05:02] we will be
[1:05:04] because the price has already been paid
[1:05:06] amen your soul now that's a different
[1:05:08] story your soul is where god comes and
[1:05:11] lives that's where he's living now if
[1:05:13] you're born again the holy spirit lives
[1:05:16] in you
[1:05:16] and that's where his residence is and
[1:05:18] his body and his spirit remember satan
[1:05:21] chose the mind
[1:05:22] is still corruptible yes it can be
[1:05:25] corrupted
[1:05:27] that's why we have that thank god for
[1:05:29] the blood
[1:05:30] amen flowing rich and free
[1:05:32] that
[1:05:33] covers me
[1:05:35] that annihilates that sin that does away
[1:05:38] with that sin praise the lord
[1:05:40] amen thank god for that now
[1:05:44] before we go to this
[1:05:45] next scripture i want to read this to
[1:05:47] you
[1:05:48] blasphemous names
[1:05:55] november 4th 1962
[1:05:58] now here they are
[1:06:00] he is now
[1:06:02] a son of god but he makes a mistake
[1:06:06] he knows he's doing wrong that's adam
[1:06:09] now remember adam was not deceived why
[1:06:12] because the word cannot be deceived
[1:06:15] amen the word the word cannot be in the
[1:06:18] transgression
[1:06:20] because it's the word amen
[1:06:23] adam was not in the transgression
[1:06:25] because he was the word
[1:06:27] it's like brother adam talked about a
[1:06:29] sinner can't sin because that's what he
[1:06:31] is you ever hear brother branham say
[1:06:33] that right again a sinner can't sin
[1:06:36] because he is sin
[1:06:38] that's just who he is
[1:06:40] amen
[1:06:42] i hate to do this again
[1:06:44] but
[1:06:48] if if i am who i am
[1:06:51] then it manifests itself regardless of
[1:06:54] what else other things might be going on
[1:06:57] or happen or i try to pretend or
[1:06:59] i am who i am
[1:07:01] you are who you are
[1:07:03] amen and you do what you do because of
[1:07:06] who you are you live the life of live
[1:07:08] you live because of who you are
[1:07:10] a sinner lives a sinful life because
[1:07:13] he's a sinner
[1:07:14] it's what he is
[1:07:16] amen a dog doesn't live the life of a
[1:07:19] cat
[1:07:21] because he's a dog
[1:07:24] he doesn't pretend to be a dog
[1:07:27] he doesn't say hey look i'm a dog he's a
[1:07:30] dog right he's not a cat
[1:07:33] so he doesn't go around meowing and even
[1:07:35] if he did you look at him and
[1:07:38] probably put him out of his misery
[1:07:41] thinking what's wrong with this dog
[1:07:42] meowing like a cat
[1:07:44] but he's a dog and you know it's a dog
[1:07:48] sinner's a sinner he doesn't sin it's
[1:07:51] just who he is he's just living his life
[1:07:53] he's just being who he is amen you
[1:07:56] understand so the word it can't
[1:07:58] transcript the word can't be
[1:08:00] transgressed or
[1:08:03] the word is not a transgression adam
[1:08:05] could not transgress because he was the
[1:08:07] word he knew what he was doing amen i
[1:08:10] hope that understand that now he said
[1:08:12] but now adam was not deceived
[1:08:15] the bible said so uh we just read it
[1:08:18] adam was not deceived but the woman was
[1:08:20] deceived was in the transgression adam
[1:08:22] walked with eve because it was his wife
[1:08:25] same as christ not deceived by satan but
[1:08:29] walk in to death with his bride
[1:08:33] praise the lord
[1:08:35] thank god he did
[1:08:37] thank god he did
[1:08:38] i'm glad jesus was willing to be able to
[1:08:40] walk out into into death
[1:08:43] to save me
[1:08:44] because that's where i was
[1:08:46] if that's where i was there would be no
[1:08:48] way he could have got to me unless he
[1:08:49] went into sin himself
[1:08:52] adam there's no way adam could have
[1:08:54] gotten his wife where she was at when he
[1:08:57] found her there was no way he could have
[1:08:59] brought her back without going out to
[1:09:01] get her
[1:09:02] without going where she was
[1:09:06] god couldn't god couldn't bring us back
[1:09:08] to himself unless he was willing to
[1:09:10] become one of us and go out to where we
[1:09:13] were
[1:09:15] he went out and got us and brought us
[1:09:18] back to himself
[1:09:20] that's redemption
[1:09:22] he got us and brought us back to to
[1:09:24] where he is where we should be the only
[1:09:26] way he can do that is to become sin
[1:09:28] himself
[1:09:30] praise god
[1:09:33] he was not deceived
[1:09:35] he walked in to death with his bride
[1:09:38] praise the lord
[1:09:39] he went to be with his bride so he could
[1:09:41] redeem his bride
[1:09:44] adam knew he was wrong so he walked out
[1:09:47] with e
[1:09:48] amen but there was a lamb provided as he
[1:09:51] said
[1:09:53] amen listen to this now
[1:09:56] invisible union
[1:09:58] listen very closely
[1:10:01] streaming recording
[1:10:03] here in person
[1:10:06] when i read this it struck me so
[1:10:08] to my core
[1:10:10] visible union 19 november 1965 you know
[1:10:14] was
[1:10:15] one of the ones he preached for the
[1:10:17] thanksgiving meetings at jack moore's in
[1:10:19] louisiana
[1:10:20] the complacent the complete total
[1:10:23] insanity
[1:10:25] this world will go into right away
[1:10:28] it's almost there now
[1:10:32] i think
[1:10:33] we can take almost out of that
[1:10:38] the complete total insanity this world
[1:10:41] will go into we'll take out will
[1:10:44] this world is in
[1:10:47] it's there now right how many would
[1:10:50] agree
[1:10:51] the complete total insanity of this
[1:10:54] world
[1:10:55] that's over almost 60 years ago well if
[1:10:58] he said it was almost there now where is
[1:11:00] it now right complete total insanity
[1:11:04] mine
[1:11:05] why
[1:11:06] you see the footsteps of it there it is
[1:11:08] marching right out on the street
[1:11:11] marching right on the street
[1:11:13] scrolling stuff on people's doors down
[1:11:15] here busting their windows out
[1:11:17] throwing trash everywhere there's a
[1:11:20] whole huge big balance i didn't tell you
[1:11:21] that whole big pile of trash out in
[1:11:23] front of them here this morning too
[1:11:26] everywhere
[1:11:27] it's all out on the street marching
[1:11:29] everywhere right up down um
[1:11:32] total insanity
[1:11:34] do things that a human being wouldn't
[1:11:36] think of doing and being yet civilized
[1:11:41] wow
[1:11:43] i don't know that it was meant to be
[1:11:45] that way
[1:11:46] but how prophetic is that
[1:11:48] that we're living this today
[1:11:52] humans doing things that you wouldn't
[1:11:54] think they would do and be a civilized
[1:11:56] person yeah
[1:11:58] a human
[1:12:00] doing the things that they're doing
[1:12:01] today
[1:12:03] on and on we could go see all this she
[1:12:05] lost how did she do it because it was a
[1:12:08] subtle instrument called the church that
[1:12:11] was in the garden of eden a subtle
[1:12:12] person the devil walked into church just
[1:12:15] like he did the garden of eden and
[1:12:17] deceived her into it why could it be
[1:12:20] deceived
[1:12:22] what could that church be to see
[1:12:25] jesus on the outside knocking go look at
[1:12:27] revelation 3 jesus on the outside
[1:12:29] knocking of that church this layout to
[1:12:31] see a church this church agent we're in
[1:12:33] jesus is on the outside of nothing why
[1:12:34] is he outside knocking
[1:12:37] they chose intellect instead of the word
[1:12:39] of god
[1:12:40] they chose the mental conception of god
[1:12:44] a teaching
[1:12:46] a learning of god instead of god
[1:12:48] revealing that word and letting god move
[1:12:51] into your life and and just
[1:12:54] accepting some tongue speaking instead
[1:12:56] of actually the new birth of the holy
[1:12:58] spirit coming and taking rest of your
[1:13:00] soul
[1:13:04] the best evidence i know of that you've
[1:13:06] got the holy ghost is you live the life
[1:13:08] of god
[1:13:10] if god is in you you live the life of
[1:13:12] god yes brother banham said the spirit
[1:13:14] of beethoven was in you write music and
[1:13:16] play piano amen yes
[1:13:19] if the spirit of
[1:13:21] steven spielberg was on you right you
[1:13:23] direct movies of people killing each
[1:13:25] other and trying to find treasures and
[1:13:27] all this stuff that's what you do
[1:13:29] because that's the spirit that's in you
[1:13:30] that's right that's the way you live
[1:13:33] if you have the spirit of one of these
[1:13:34] hip-hoppers out here today you to come
[1:13:36] down the street to church this morning
[1:13:37] boom boom boom
[1:13:40] speaker's so loud and put your heart out
[1:13:42] of rhythm
[1:13:44] of course you probably wouldn't be
[1:13:45] headed to church if he's doing that but
[1:13:47] you never know
[1:13:48] you never know how people go to church i
[1:13:50] don't i don't condemn them i don't
[1:13:52] i don't imagine you'd be coming to this
[1:13:54] church like that but
[1:13:55] if that's who you were that's what
[1:13:57] spirit should be that's what you'd be
[1:13:58] doing
[1:13:59] you'd be doing the exact same thing
[1:14:01] i sit here on saturday and i listen to
[1:14:03] that stuff next door
[1:14:05] i have to turn
[1:14:06] my fan on and stuff so i can't hear it
[1:14:09] it helps
[1:14:11] but it's
[1:14:12] that's just what you do that's who you
[1:14:14] would be
[1:14:15] you had the spirit of
[1:14:17] white earth you would you
[1:14:19] uh
[1:14:20] you you'd kill the mcclary brothers or
[1:14:22] whatever
[1:14:23] you you
[1:14:25] had to go okay corral fight because
[1:14:27] that's who that's the spirit that's in
[1:14:29] you but if you have the spirit of god
[1:14:31] what do you do
[1:14:33] you do the things of god
[1:14:35] according to the word not according to
[1:14:37] what you think it says or what you think
[1:14:39] it's going to be you do what's right
[1:14:42] according to the word
[1:14:43] amen not my opinion
[1:14:46] so that spirit so that church now he
[1:14:48] said that devil is walked in because the
[1:14:50] church
[1:14:52] is deceived how could she be deceived
[1:14:54] because she wasn't the word to start
[1:14:56] with
[1:14:58] amen
[1:14:59] only once it can be deceived now we're
[1:15:01] talking about i'm not talking about your
[1:15:03] human flesh
[1:15:04] we're talking about the spirit realm
[1:15:06] we're talking about the soul of man only
[1:15:08] way that a person can be deceived in
[1:15:10] their soul is to not have the holy ghost
[1:15:12] right
[1:15:13] it's to not be born again because if
[1:15:15] you're born again you become the word
[1:15:17] you cannot be deceived right
[1:15:19] amen amen
[1:15:21] the only way there could be deception
[1:15:24] is because there's
[1:15:26] it's not word
[1:15:28] and all that can be shaken will be
[1:15:30] saints
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:34] walked into the church just like he did
[1:15:35] the garden of eden deceived her into it
[1:15:37] she is deceived the woman see
[1:15:40] brother man says now she don't mean to
[1:15:43] be wrong
[1:15:44] eve didn't mean to do wrong it wasn't
[1:15:46] willfully the bible said in second
[1:15:49] timothy he goes on again she was
[1:15:51] deceived and deceived as when you will
[1:15:54] is not when you willfully do it is when
[1:15:57] you are deceived into doing it
[1:16:00] understand
[1:16:01] only way
[1:16:02] she could be deceived
[1:16:05] doing it the only reason she did it
[1:16:07] wasn't willfully she didn't mean to call
[1:16:09] us what she did
[1:16:10] she didn't mean to start that whole ball
[1:16:12] rolling
[1:16:13] she didn't mean for all this to happen
[1:16:15] but
[1:16:16] there's a place we know of that's paved
[1:16:18] with great intentions
[1:16:21] amen
[1:16:24] i think we probably i don't have any of
[1:16:26] us know that because
[1:16:28] you know the place is paved with good
[1:16:30] intentions
[1:16:32] hell
[1:16:33] is the place that is paved with good
[1:16:35] intentions right i had great intentions
[1:16:39] but where is it leading me
[1:16:41] amen no let's move on
[1:16:43] because i really want to get to this
[1:16:46] last part
[1:16:47] tip for today
[1:16:50] she didn't do it willfully she was
[1:16:52] deceived into doing it that's exactly
[1:16:54] this and now as i finish this quote that
[1:16:56] is exactly what happens today
[1:16:59] she's been deceived by television by
[1:17:02] magazines by these people all these fine
[1:17:04] things are going out on the street
[1:17:06] modern girls
[1:17:07] modern girls look at these magazines and
[1:17:10] all these pictures and look out on the
[1:17:11] street the clothing in the shops and how
[1:17:14] satan that great instrument of hell has
[1:17:16] come down among the people and deceived
[1:17:18] him into those things
[1:17:21] they think that's the right way to be
[1:17:24] and it's getting filthier all the time
[1:17:26] it's getting more and more ungodly and
[1:17:29] demonic all the time
[1:17:31] the look the dress the hair the weary
[1:17:34] look at
[1:17:36] i'm gonna delve into this for just a
[1:17:38] second
[1:17:39] but look at if you if you
[1:17:42] watch the news or you see anything about
[1:17:44] the news feed phones whatever
[1:17:47] if you look and you see all the protests
[1:17:51] i want you to look at about 90 of the
[1:17:54] people that are pro-murder
[1:17:56] and 90 of the people that are pro-life
[1:18:00] i'd almost guarantee you 90 of the
[1:18:02] people that are pro-life look more like
[1:18:04] us
[1:18:05] yes
[1:18:06] 90 of the people that are pro-death and
[1:18:09] murder
[1:18:12] piercings all over tats all over hairs
[1:18:15] blue green blue purple yellow green
[1:18:17] uh butch to whatever it is
[1:18:20] that's just
[1:18:21] and i that's just an observation not a
[1:18:24] judgment not judging that's just
[1:18:26] again
[1:18:27] that's just who they are they're just
[1:18:29] living the spirit that they are
[1:18:31] amen so i'm not condemning them
[1:18:34] that's god will do that if they die in
[1:18:36] that condition but i just want you to
[1:18:38] see the observation
[1:18:40] and talking about
[1:18:43] violent acts because of this being
[1:18:46] overturned
[1:18:47] well who's surprised about that
[1:18:50] the very thing that they're voicing
[1:18:52] their opinion about is a violent act
[1:18:55] murdering an unborn child is a violent
[1:18:58] act
[1:18:59] so of course if they're advocating the
[1:19:01] murdering of a little child you think a
[1:19:03] violent act of painting or busting a
[1:19:04] window or burning something down you
[1:19:06] think that bothers them
[1:19:09] the whole premise of it is a violent act
[1:19:11] right
[1:19:12] so you notice
[1:19:14] it's what you got today television
[1:19:16] magazines people on the street social
[1:19:19] media i'd say today
[1:19:21] tick-tock
[1:19:22] friend if you got tick-tock please take
[1:19:24] it off your phone
[1:19:26] or your tablet or whatever i don't ever
[1:19:28] tell anybody what to do but that is
[1:19:32] facebook's bad enough instagram and all
[1:19:34] that and whatever i have a facebook
[1:19:37] i'll never look at it but i have one
[1:19:40] but that that stuff is so horribly
[1:19:43] demonic
[1:19:45] it's just terrible
[1:19:49] and that that's for another story but
[1:19:54] the influence that is out there
[1:19:57] and you notice who it's working on
[1:19:59] gaining control over
[1:20:02] it's mostly the young women
[1:20:04] it's most of the young women that these
[1:20:07] kardashians and all this garbage is
[1:20:09] trying to gain the image of the of the
[1:20:12] young girls today
[1:20:13] to try to say oh this is the way it's
[1:20:15] supposed to be this is how it's supposed
[1:20:18] you're supposed to look this is what
[1:20:20] normal is today
[1:20:23] if that's normal friend take me now
[1:20:27] that is not normal right
[1:20:29] it's becoming normalized by this country
[1:20:32] by the world but that is not normal
[1:20:34] all the things they see on social media
[1:20:36] and
[1:20:37] musicians and all this stuff and nails
[1:20:40] out here and eyelashes out to here and
[1:20:42] it just it's
[1:20:44] i i've seen movies of egyptian fans that
[1:20:47] are smaller than some of these women's
[1:20:48] eyelashes
[1:20:51] it's sad
[1:20:53] 110 degrees she's like would you move a
[1:20:55] little closer and blink fast
[1:20:58] because that's what it's gotten to be
[1:21:00] yes
[1:21:01] and
[1:21:03] who how i look at my wife they think how
[1:21:06] who can think that's normal
[1:21:08] who can even think that looks good right
[1:21:12] in my day
[1:21:15] probably a lot of our days
[1:21:17] when i was growing up if a guy
[1:21:21] looked all freaky a girl would have
[1:21:24] nothing to do with him
[1:21:26] if his hair was cut all crazy or
[1:21:28] earrings or uh all this stuff a girl
[1:21:31] wouldn't have anything to do with a guy
[1:21:32] like that so guys didn't look like that
[1:21:34] and vice versa
[1:21:37] if a girl's hair was pink or something a
[1:21:39] guy would guys i do wouldn't even look
[1:21:42] at the girl
[1:21:43] must touch her having to do with her
[1:21:46] now
[1:21:47] i'm not judging i'm just letting you see
[1:21:49] the observation how things have changed
[1:21:52] and you notice the character of the
[1:21:54] people is what i'm getting to
[1:21:56] that are on the one side of the
[1:21:58] character it looks like mostly not all
[1:22:01] on the other side
[1:22:03] and how different it is
[1:22:05] amen and how different it is and i will
[1:22:07] say this
[1:22:09] this decision that happened
[1:22:12] on
[1:22:13] thursday
[1:22:14] friday
[1:22:15] this decision will further divide this
[1:22:18] country yes
[1:22:20] absolutely will
[1:22:22] this is one of the most divisive issues
[1:22:24] if not the most divisive i know and why
[1:22:26] in the world people fight so hard for it
[1:22:29] there's got to be a demonic spirit
[1:22:31] behind it yes or they wouldn't scream
[1:22:33] and yell and fight so hard for it
[1:22:35] i mean
[1:22:36] i look and i think and i know i'm
[1:22:38] looking from a certain perspective but i
[1:22:40] think what is the big deal
[1:22:42] because really the truth is it didn't
[1:22:44] outlaw abortion it just outlawed the
[1:22:46] federal government from saying it right
[1:22:50] amen
[1:22:52] so you know there's got to be a demonic
[1:22:54] spirit behind it
[1:22:55] what is that is death right yeah ronald
[1:22:59] reagan even said look at the people that
[1:23:01] are pro-abortion if they're screaming
[1:23:03] and yelling about a pro-abortion they're
[1:23:05] already alive
[1:23:07] yes
[1:23:08] the people that are yelling screaming
[1:23:10] about it are the ones that are already
[1:23:11] alive
[1:23:12] they've already made it into life
[1:23:15] it just says none of it makes any sense
[1:23:17] but it's not supposed to
[1:23:20] not to us anyway
[1:23:23] it doesn't make any sense but you see
[1:23:24] the spirit that's behind it
[1:23:26] amen the spirit that's behind it that's
[1:23:28] the whole thing
[1:23:30] deceived now
[1:23:32] let me finish this oh i did finish it
[1:23:35] deceived radio television look at those
[1:23:38] things that's garbage that's demonic
[1:23:40] scenes
[1:23:41] this music today this boo boom stuff and
[1:23:44] all this
[1:23:45] it just i i couldn't even begin to
[1:23:48] repeat some of the lyrics wouldn't want
[1:23:49] to if i could but
[1:23:51] it's just horrible
[1:23:53] it's just horrible stuff let's go to a
[1:23:55] scripture now because i gotta i gotta
[1:23:57] wrap this up uh hebrews chapter 10.
[1:24:05] i got two more scriptures i want to get
[1:24:07] to
[1:24:09] in a few
[1:24:10] next few minutes
[1:24:11] again i'll try to wrap up here real
[1:24:13] shortly
[1:24:14] hebrews chapter 10 verse 24.
[1:24:17] these next two scriptures to me are two
[1:24:20] very misunderstood scriptures
[1:24:23] and i want to by the help of the lord
[1:24:26] uh
[1:24:26] bring i believe what the lord's revealed
[1:24:29] to me about it
[1:24:32] hebrews 10
[1:24:35] 24
[1:24:37] let us consider one another to provoke
[1:24:39] unto love and to good works
[1:24:41] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:24:43] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:24:46] is
[1:24:47] but exhorting one another that's
[1:24:49] encouraging one another uplifting
[1:24:51] building up
[1:24:53] one another
[1:24:54] and so much more as you see that day
[1:24:56] approaching
[1:24:58] and we do
[1:25:00] for if we sin willfully
[1:25:03] after that we have received the
[1:25:04] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:25:06] no more sacrifice for sins no more
[1:25:09] sacrifice
[1:25:11] for sins i don't know i'm going to be
[1:25:13] able to do this in the time of god
[1:25:15] if we sin willfully disbelieve mr mark
[1:25:20] willfully
[1:25:22] after having received the knowledge of
[1:25:24] the truth that sin
[1:25:26] is not a simple
[1:25:28] uh
[1:25:29] trip
[1:25:30] backslide mistake
[1:25:33] this sin is a a leaving
[1:25:37] a departing from the
[1:25:39] established truth that has come to your
[1:25:43] understanding and your attention you
[1:25:45] know of it because it says
[1:25:47] after that you have received
[1:25:50] the knowledge of the truth that doesn't
[1:25:52] mean you just heard it you received the
[1:25:55] knowledge of truth it's different to
[1:25:57] hear something than to receive it
[1:26:00] and people receive things all the time i
[1:26:02] can go take a pen and drop it in your
[1:26:04] lap and the pen can sit there but you
[1:26:06] haven't received it i gave it to you
[1:26:09] it's your opinion you can take it and
[1:26:10] use it but you haven't received it until
[1:26:13] you pick it up and put it in the use
[1:26:15] right and say this is my pen see so when
[1:26:18] you receive something it's different
[1:26:19] than just hearing something
[1:26:21] okay so it says if you have received the
[1:26:24] knowledge after you've received the
[1:26:27] knowledge of truth there remaineth no
[1:26:29] more sacrifice for sins sacrifice what
[1:26:33] is that sacrifice sacrifice that began
[1:26:35] in the garden of eden just after adam
[1:26:37] and eve fell
[1:26:38] when adam and eve failed god came down
[1:26:40] and they said where he said where are
[1:26:42] you
[1:26:43] oh here we are we were naked we hid
[1:26:45] ourselves so who told you were naked
[1:26:47] and after they went through all the
[1:26:49] things we just read about it
[1:26:51] god took two sheep
[1:26:53] before adam and eve could come out from
[1:26:55] the bush god took two lambs and he slew
[1:26:58] the lambs and he threw the sheepskin
[1:27:01] into them so they could clothe
[1:27:02] themselves in a bloody sacrifice
[1:27:06] that was the only way they could come
[1:27:07] out from the bush now they were still
[1:27:09] banished from the garden of eden
[1:27:12] they were still separated
[1:27:14] but god gave them a way to come into his
[1:27:16] presence again and that established a
[1:27:19] precedent that all through the old
[1:27:21] testament when god told moses that this
[1:27:24] is how it's going to be acceptable to me
[1:27:28] an innocent one has to give its life so
[1:27:31] that you can be able to
[1:27:33] be received by me again
[1:27:35] not together like it was before the fall
[1:27:38] but acceptable received
[1:27:41] it took the lamb the paschal lamb jesus
[1:27:44] the perfect sacrifice to shed his blood
[1:27:46] to bridge that a gap to bring man and
[1:27:50] god back in fellowship together again
[1:27:53] but
[1:27:53] that sacrifice
[1:27:55] that was there for adam and eve that
[1:27:58] they took to themselves
[1:28:00] god made that sacrifice and that
[1:28:02] precedent was to continue on to even to
[1:28:05] today
[1:28:06] amen even to today through us
[1:28:09] for us
[1:28:11] that bloody sacrifice still there for us
[1:28:14] yes clothes that covers me
[1:28:18] clothed in amen
[1:28:20] that bloody sacrifice now
[1:28:23] if they're if they're if you sin
[1:28:25] willfully after having now what is
[1:28:28] willfully
[1:28:30] willfully means you purposely
[1:28:33] knowingly you weren't tricked into it
[1:28:36] you weren't connived you weren't
[1:28:38] anything
[1:28:39] you saw something
[1:28:40] you received it and you said i don't
[1:28:43] want to have anything to do with it and
[1:28:45] you walk away from it
[1:28:47] that's sinning willfully
[1:28:50] not deceived into it but willfully you
[1:28:52] walk away from it there's no more
[1:28:55] sacrifice for sin now what how not what
[1:28:58] hap this to me this thing now friends
[1:29:00] this brings in the perfect light when
[1:29:02] when paul told them in the roman church
[1:29:06] about the grace of god
[1:29:09] and they told him they asked paul well
[1:29:11] can we just go sin then
[1:29:14] now you see where that nicolaitan
[1:29:16] catholic church how it comes into play
[1:29:19] and they said shall we just go sin
[1:29:21] because the blood of god is he's just
[1:29:23] gonna forgive me anyway
[1:29:24] the attitude sensible
[1:29:27] that the christian world has today oh
[1:29:30] that makes sense yeah well god will just
[1:29:32] forgive us anyway we'll just go do
[1:29:34] whatever we want to do
[1:29:36] friend you keep doing that you're going
[1:29:37] to cross that line
[1:29:39] to where there's no more sacrifice for
[1:29:41] your sin yes because paul told them god
[1:29:44] forbid because you take the grace of god
[1:29:47] and you make a disgrace out of it
[1:29:49] you keep crossing that line remember
[1:29:51] that story brother bam told about that
[1:29:53] girl when he was in service she's
[1:29:56] sitting down there and she's snickering
[1:29:58] and whatever she's doing and god uh
[1:30:00] brother brown pointed at her a couple
[1:30:01] times says what about you young lady
[1:30:05] and she just sat there
[1:30:07] got all mad at him
[1:30:09] brother man finally looked at her and
[1:30:11] said young lady this could be your last
[1:30:13] opportunity
[1:30:16] to come to god this could be your last
[1:30:18] chance she didn't come up
[1:30:21] she got mad at brother branham how dare
[1:30:23] you embarrass me in front of those
[1:30:25] people like that call my name out point
[1:30:27] at me like that how dare you do
[1:30:28] something like that god brother brad i'm
[1:30:30] sorry on the street not too long after
[1:30:32] that smoking a cigarette bottle of
[1:30:35] whiskey
[1:30:37] he recognized her or she recognized jay
[1:30:40] parson remember me
[1:30:44] he said yeah
[1:30:46] he said you know what
[1:30:48] you told me that night could be my last
[1:30:50] chance
[1:30:51] she said it was
[1:30:53] she said that was my last opportunity to
[1:30:55] come to god
[1:30:56] she had spurned god's mercy long enough
[1:30:58] she had crossed that line
[1:31:02] she crossed that line to where there was
[1:31:03] no more sacrifice for that sin she said
[1:31:06] i could see she
[1:31:08] want to hit on my cigarette
[1:31:10] my liquor
[1:31:11] bill bam said you ought to be ashamed of
[1:31:12] yourself she said i could parse and i
[1:31:14] could see my mother's soul frying like a
[1:31:16] pancake in hell it wouldn't bother me a
[1:31:18] bit
[1:31:20] that's how bad she got
[1:31:22] but when you spurn god what is left
[1:31:25] it does
[1:31:26] that's exactly what a lot of this world
[1:31:28] this country is is falling into right
[1:31:31] now
[1:31:32] it's gotting into that it's getting into
[1:31:34] that place yes where they can literally
[1:31:37] see
[1:31:39] i i don't want to keep harping on that
[1:31:41] but you understand that sacrifice
[1:31:44] you sin willfully continue and people
[1:31:47] say oh well god i just forgive me god
[1:31:48] will forgive me i'll just keep doing
[1:31:50] this and living this way god will
[1:31:51] forgive me
[1:31:52] they'll get to the point to where
[1:31:53] there'll be no more sacrifice for that
[1:31:55] sin
[1:31:57] amen but for a fearful day of looking
[1:31:59] for the judgment of god
[1:32:02] no more sacrifice sinning willfully
[1:32:05] purposefully continuing to do it and
[1:32:08] know they say well god will forgive me
[1:32:10] well that's different see but now
[1:32:13] you think about the soul of man
[1:32:16] heart of man
[1:32:17] the and the flesh of man
[1:32:20] flesh man wants to do something
[1:32:23] but if the soul is born again
[1:32:25] it commands to that spirit to that body
[1:32:27] no don't do that that's against god's
[1:32:29] word
[1:32:30] now you get a little temper or get a
[1:32:32] little upset or motion or something and
[1:32:34] do something or say something you
[1:32:35] shouldn't or make a mistake or a slip up
[1:32:38] or something and you make a mistake you
[1:32:39] say you go to god and say god forgive me
[1:32:41] i didn't mean to do that
[1:32:44] reminds me of that time brother bring
[1:32:46] talked about when we went to brother
[1:32:47] branham about his lustful imaginations
[1:32:49] brother tell us brother green tells that
[1:32:51] behind the pulpit about his lustful
[1:32:53] imaginations brother random said sit
[1:32:55] down pray
[1:32:56] and sit down with the food couch he said
[1:32:58] now you've got to do what i do
[1:33:01] you
[1:33:02] the prophet of god william branham i
[1:33:04] have to do what you you even know what
[1:33:06] i'm talking about oh yeah i know exactly
[1:33:08] what you're talking about i'm a man too
[1:33:11] i'm a red-blooded male just like you are
[1:33:15] you have to do what i do
[1:33:17] as soon as you get a hold of yourself oh
[1:33:19] god forgive me i don't mean to be like
[1:33:21] that i don't want to do this tonight
[1:33:23] it's different
[1:33:24] amen that's not someone who has received
[1:33:26] and willfully purposefully walked away
[1:33:28] from it and made a mockery of it really
[1:33:31] right
[1:33:32] there's a difference yes there's blood
[1:33:35] there's sacrifice that remains for that
[1:33:37] sin for that wrongdoing
[1:33:39] because god knows our minds our bodies
[1:33:42] are still able to be corrupted
[1:33:45] but the soul
[1:33:47] cannot be it's the word of god amen
[1:33:50] there's no more sacrifice
[1:33:53] people get that wrong so often friend i
[1:33:55] want to go to another one just another
[1:33:57] page over hebrews 12 and i'm going to
[1:33:59] close
[1:34:03] i want to get to a whole nother side of
[1:34:05] this subject but it'll have to be next
[1:34:07] week but i want to leave you with this
[1:34:12] hebrews 12
[1:34:14] verse 15. it's another scripture i hear
[1:34:17] so many times that people say these
[1:34:19] these and they reference this scripture
[1:34:22] because somehow
[1:34:23] the devil will
[1:34:24] make you live in fear
[1:34:26] oh have i crossed that line have i made
[1:34:28] that mistake how have i gone so far
[1:34:31] brother graham said if there's still a
[1:34:33] heart in you that wants god and that
[1:34:35] wants to do what right wants to get
[1:34:38] then there's something still there
[1:34:39] pulling you yes there's something still
[1:34:42] there that's bringing into it and if
[1:34:44] that pull is in your heart
[1:34:46] give in to it yes
[1:34:48] let god bring you in because that's the
[1:34:50] whole point he went out of sin to bring
[1:34:52] you in for
[1:34:53] is to bring you back in
[1:34:55] if that pull is there there's something
[1:34:57] there it's speaking to you it's trying
[1:35:00] to get you to that place
[1:35:02] obey that pull obey that voice
[1:35:05] let god pull you in
[1:35:07] but now people look at the scripture
[1:35:08] they say now
[1:35:09] um
[1:35:11] hebrews 12 15 looking diligently
[1:35:14] lest any man fell of the grace of god
[1:35:16] lest any root of bitterness bringing up
[1:35:18] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[1:35:22] lest there be any fornicator or profane
[1:35:25] person as esau who for one morsel of
[1:35:29] meat sold his birthright
[1:35:31] for ye know how that afterward when he
[1:35:35] would have inherited the blessing he was
[1:35:37] rejected for he found no place of
[1:35:40] repentance though he sought it carefully
[1:35:44] with tears
[1:35:46] people have asked myself how could esau
[1:35:49] have been seeking repentance so
[1:35:52] diligently and with tears that he would
[1:35:54] be rejected
[1:35:57] well look at the scriptures
[1:35:59] the scripture answers that
[1:36:01] because people think you can get past
[1:36:03] that line and still have a repentant
[1:36:05] heart but be lost
[1:36:07] no that's not what it said look what it
[1:36:10] says
[1:36:12] esau who sold out his birthright for a
[1:36:15] more morsel of me
[1:36:17] for he
[1:36:19] knew for ye know how that afterward
[1:36:24] when he would have inherited the
[1:36:26] blessing
[1:36:29] so the point of it is
[1:36:31] did he repent because he lost his
[1:36:34] blessing
[1:36:35] or did he repent because he was really
[1:36:37] sorry
[1:36:39] it's like my wife says all the time she
[1:36:41] said nobody's sorry until they get
[1:36:43] caught
[1:36:45] on every time she's told me that people
[1:36:47] are sorry until they get caught when it
[1:36:49] is keep doing and living and being and
[1:36:50] doing and
[1:36:52] and they just live this whole evil life
[1:36:54] and then when they get caught they're
[1:36:55] like oh i'm so sorry i didn't mean to
[1:36:58] they're only sorrowful when they get
[1:36:59] caught
[1:37:00] see
[1:37:01] esau got caught
[1:37:03] he sold his birthright
[1:37:06] he was only sorrowful he was only
[1:37:08] repenting because he wanted the
[1:37:10] birthright
[1:37:12] that's why god said he saw jacob love
[1:37:14] and he saw hater before the boy was born
[1:37:16] because he still had no respect not for
[1:37:18] god but he was repenting because he was
[1:37:22] sorrowful that he didn't have the
[1:37:23] blessing because it was afterward when
[1:37:26] he would have inherited the blessing
[1:37:30] that's when he's like oh my i'm not
[1:37:31] getting the blessing oh i'm sorry i'm
[1:37:33] sorry i didn't mean to
[1:37:36] that's the same thing people do that
[1:37:38] they
[1:37:39] they they serve god because they're
[1:37:41] scared of him or they don't want to go
[1:37:43] to hell you don't serve god because you
[1:37:45] want to dodge hell you serve god because
[1:37:47] you love him
[1:37:49] you don't repent because you want
[1:37:51] something out of it you repent because
[1:37:53] you're truly sorrowful if nothing else
[1:37:56] comes from it you're really i'm very
[1:37:59] sorry
[1:38:00] sorrowful and it won't do it again
[1:38:03] right that's what repentance is that
[1:38:05] wasn't his repentance his repentance was
[1:38:08] after he realized he was not going to
[1:38:10] get the birth he's like oh i'm so sorry
[1:38:12] now and and ask forgiveness in
[1:38:15] repentance cried for it i want that
[1:38:17] birthright well people aren't sorry
[1:38:18] until they get caught
[1:38:20] he got caught
[1:38:21] then he was sorry it's too late then and
[1:38:23] god knows a person's heart
[1:38:25] god knows where that place of repentance
[1:38:27] is coming from and people think oh you
[1:38:29] can cross that line and you can still
[1:38:32] want to repent and god won't receive
[1:38:33] your repentance no no it doesn't work
[1:38:35] that way god does receive a genuine
[1:38:38] purposeful in your heart filled
[1:38:41] repentance god absolutely will receive
[1:38:43] right but something like this to say oh
[1:38:45] i want to repent so i can get my birth
[1:38:47] right back
[1:38:49] that doesn't work with god
[1:38:50] it might work with humans it might work
[1:38:53] in our
[1:38:54] judicial system and all around but it
[1:38:56] that doesn't work with god
[1:38:58] because god can read your heart and he
[1:39:00] knows that that repentance is true or
[1:39:02] not
[1:39:02] and his tears oh sure anybody can cry
[1:39:05] tears i could stand here right now and
[1:39:06] cry tear for you if you want me to
[1:39:10] i can
[1:39:11] any people can bring their emotions into
[1:39:13] a place that you can have tears coming
[1:39:14] out of your eyes almost anybody can do
[1:39:16] that
[1:39:18] some
[1:39:18] people maybe not but most people can
[1:39:21] that's just emotion right but something
[1:39:24] of repentance is in the heart in the
[1:39:27] soul repentance doesn't come from your
[1:39:28] flesh your spirit it comes from your
[1:39:30] soul amen
[1:39:32] that's what his desire was that's what
[1:39:34] his heart was
[1:39:35] he sinned against the word and he paid
[1:39:38] the price for it and he didn't really
[1:39:40] repent
[1:39:42] because if you read later where he met
[1:39:44] with
[1:39:45] jacob again
[1:39:47] there was nothing in his life even
[1:39:49] remotely repentant
[1:39:52] so god knew it wasn't that he was
[1:39:55] weeping and crying he really wasn't
[1:39:57] sincere in his repentance he was just
[1:39:59] repenting because he wanted the
[1:40:00] birthright
[1:40:02] amen and some people become christians
[1:40:04] because well some people start coming to
[1:40:06] church just because they're like hanging
[1:40:08] around good people
[1:40:10] because of the spirit that right a godly
[1:40:13] person projects a good spirit and they
[1:40:15] like being around that and feeling that
[1:40:17] because whether they're godly or not or
[1:40:19] have the holy ghost they can feel that
[1:40:20] presence
[1:40:21] they can feel that spirit and they like
[1:40:23] being around it some people come because
[1:40:25] they're just trying to dodge hell
[1:40:26] some people come because it's just they
[1:40:28] think it's just a covering i'm okay
[1:40:31] because i'm religious
[1:40:33] i even told craig years if they had to
[1:40:36] come fix the thing was leaking again and
[1:40:38] i talked to him
[1:40:40] the other day i forgot maybe it was
[1:40:41] saturday um
[1:40:43] about
[1:40:44] the place now he's asked me how he liked
[1:40:46] it and it asked was growing and i said
[1:40:48] but you gotta understand i'm not
[1:40:50] i'm not probably a typical religious
[1:40:53] pastor
[1:40:56] more people that's fine and good i said
[1:40:58] but i don't look for numbers the thing
[1:41:01] i'm most concerned about is the
[1:41:02] spiritual welfare of my congregation
[1:41:05] getting closer to god
[1:41:07] getting more like the lord jesus
[1:41:10] having your life closer to him
[1:41:14] becoming more sold out to him every day
[1:41:17] that's the thing that matters to me the
[1:41:19] most spiritual health is way more
[1:41:21] important to me than how many people are
[1:41:23] here
[1:41:24] but god blesses us
[1:41:26] god takes care of us
[1:41:28] god provides amen pays the bills praise
[1:41:31] the lord so he was happy about that
[1:41:34] amen so thank god god blesses us so it's
[1:41:37] not a matter of
[1:41:40] numbers of people
[1:41:42] but where's your life with god amen it
[1:41:45] can't be
[1:41:46] you can't live on an experience of he
