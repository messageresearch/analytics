that walked up to that tomb and that stone was off to the side and you walk inside and there's no doubt a presence just smack you right in the face as you look over and see nothing but grave close lay

amen thank you Jesus like hallelujah thank you Jesus oh it's alive in us today Saints aren't you thankful for that praise God amen once it was all in Jesus Christ one man but when he wins and rose again he sent himself back to live in a mini member body it's not just him now it is him but it's him and all of us God Amen it reminds me of a a thing that happened one time in in Saint Augustine is these big banana spiders Micah knows him think they're huge legs and all they're they're that big they fall off the tree she can't exterminate them because they fall off the trees and getting on the house and they get in the house and and they lay eggs and they put these they have these big sacks and uh there's this one person and they had one spider in their house that they could find just one is a big one they didn't realize that underneath that spider it was a mama underneath that spider was that egg sack about that face and they looked at that one spider and they thought I'm gonna kill that one spider and it'll end it all and she grabbed that newspaper or whatever it was I forgot now this is a true story grabbed and smacked that spider and killed the spider but when she did she shot 200 little spiders all over her house reminds me of Satan he said if I just get a hold of him I'm gonna kill him and that'll be the end of it all but when he did he created multi millions of people around the world since then that have received him and now live for him we are a part of that amen can you imagine that lady looked and said ma what have I done they had to tent her house and fumigate her house to get rid of all the spiders you imagine Satan said what did I do praise God I don't just have one now I've got thousands millions of them amen praise the Lord one more song before we go to the Lord in prayer this is one of Joel's favorite I hate you're not here Joel I hope you're watching celebrate with me if you're listening we're gonna also get together number 270 amen God is not dead yes he is still alive amen praise the lord well God's Not Dead [Applause] he is alive he is alive I'm feeling me in my head I'm feeling in my feelings [Music] [Applause] he is alive [Music] is about is alive yeah [Music] I barely make my feet I'll tell him in my heart and not feeling all over one more time now yes [Applause] [Music] amen amen hallelujah thank you Jesus for he's God when he come on that day of Pentecost friend amen he just came on them and them amen and it became new ly Christ Jesus Hallelujah he's the same God today say oh I read that in history I see that in the Bible that happened two thousand years ago but he's the same God today we are the same people today as they were then if God done it one time for them he'd do the same thing for us or he's not God amen so I received it I believe it amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen what goes the Lord in prayer amen take prayer requests up I appreciate everyone's prayers for me on this last trip it was a good trip the Lord blessed it amen it's a little late getting going uh my flight out of here I think I told you before I left was delayed well my flight going to Springfield was delayed so I made that flight and by the time then the storms had passed the flights were smooth and good everything was fine so I appreciate the Lord and fight for good back so thank God for that amen um also you see a lot of my family it's just me and Mike a family today as you've been well aware Tabitha and Sonia apparently have contracted strep throat and uh weren't feeling well and still not just not quite over it yet so please remember them in prayer of course Zach and the kids stay home too just for caution to make sure that as far as I know now none of the others have been affected so praise the Lord so but appreciate your prayers for remembering them in prayer the Lord would just continue to keep them and and bless them also there was a um uh request here for sit from Sister Julie says please keep uh her in prayer for traveling mercies she's leaving Chuchu to go to Detroit Michigan for work returning Thursday I also ask the Lord to please give me the words to say if asked to speak at the Planning Commission meeting on Wednesday night and so remember Sister Julian prayer leaving Tuesday coming back Thursday to Detroit Michigan amen not one of the safest places on Earth but the Lord be with you amen so God is God is mindful amen praise the Lord so just pray the Lord would just touch sister Julie and keep her safe and healthy amen good trip he liked traveling mercies amen as few others out I'm not sure the situations going on but we know that Lord the Lord is Mindful and he loves us all anyone else have a unspoken request on your heart would like to know the Lord let's stand to our feet if we could amen thank the Lord for hearing our prayers amen one of the benefits to him still being alive and the same today Lord Jesus with all our hearts and heads and reverence to your holy presence yes Lord the world's acknowledging Easter for us as Believers for the resurrection Hallelujah yes and as Paul said one time the preaching of the Cross to them that perish is foolishness but to us that are saved the True Believers yes the power of God hallelujah and Lord you took it upon yourself you saw that your human race was dying and you took it upon yourself to become one of us yes then you went to the Cross you that was without sin came to die for yes born of sin thank you Lord your great sacrifice a blood sacrifice may have eternal life and Lord help us to recognize that day in an hour that we're living in oh there's just too many still plank your attitude they wonder why your blessings is becoming real in their life oh god oh Lord I can look at the Young Rich ruler he came up to you and he recognized there was something like Oh my he was a good man he lived a good life he was a religious man but you told him sell all that you have give to the poor come and follow me and he couldn't do it father and then he went on to become richer than ever he was busy Lord taking care of the Natural Things of this life and he said well I know God is blessing me I'm tearing down small barns from buildings I don't need to go to the Lord's Supper in communion service they'll understand I'm making more money for the kingdom of God oh God oh I have so much money I give two percent which is more than all the others combined because I'm so rich when God requires for us to give 10 percent otherwise we're stealing we're robbing God as Jesus Lord how much more can you speak to our hearts if we are not lining up to your word you cannot use us you there's some that might say well Lord I want to be use of you if there's um repent of sin if there's unbelief God cannot do any of us it's time to recognize there's Redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ if we confess our sins it is Justified to forgive us of our sins amen and cleanse us from all unrighteousness Hallelujah help us father to recognize the hours late you're coming for a bride without spot and blemish a bride that loves you with all her heart I heard your body saying why people can't get the Holy Ghost can get right with God because they're not sincere enough and I remember the example that brother Brown said about Buddy Robinson he knew he did have it so he was driving through a cornfield one day he stopped his truck and he cried out to you later unless you fill me with the Holy Ghost you'll find a pile of bones here yes and brother Brown said he got it then yes this time that we recognize we need to repent there are needs to punish your body this morning Lord there's people that need a healing touch and we believe father Yes and there's power in the name of Jesus hallelujah amen come undeed and touch um sister Sonia uh sister Tabitha and all that are sick this morning for you are truly a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities yes and with your stripes we are healed amen and Lord we can claim total Deliverance Lord we believe this I heard brother Brown saying that God wants us to ask he wants us to keep asking amen he wants us to believe we can live a thousand lifestimes and you can never exhaust the blessings and the promises of God oh Lord how much you believe help us to walk in the light at all times and Lord there's some that they come to church and they have real Pilots are religious and the prophet said don't uh jump any higher than your own confession lord it's searching time and imma close with this silver message Lord that I read Revelations 9. Lord it just spoke to my heart that's where you mentioned that death will flee from the people they are in the Great Tribulation yes there's something that might say well if I don't make it I'll be foolish virgin read Revelations 9. open up their hearts let them see that it is definitely what it's it's a time that's more horrible than it's ever been in the face of this Earth Brethren even said there'll be locusts with long hair and I'll more men men for five months and brother Brown said it'll be the women that cut their hair yes that's the torment that comes oh god oh Lord I love these people I love my pastor he I want to see everyone make it but if we're not being sincere we're not truly repented you paid that ultimate price we accept our healing we accept our deliverance we believe and we love one another we believe total delivers for each and every one and our sister Julie is traveling watch over your servant keep her safe use her to be a testimony Amen to speak Lord give her the words that she needs to speak granted Lord in your name amen Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you like amen sister Matisse has a special she'd like to sing this morning amen so just pray the Lord bless her evolution has been able to clear it but here we go yes just as sweet as it was if I'm not Gravelly um is this on okay I'm gonna do a little accompaniment here thank you [Music] to Glory [Music] Lord we lift our hands in worship as we lift your holy name [Music] Lord we lift our hands in worship are you all right [Music] there is no one else like you will be [Music] there is no one else [Music] yes amen yes Jesus [Music] amen [Music] we are with our hands in worship [Music] there is nowhere else like you there is no more like you amen yes Jesus [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] the Lord [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] amen um my car was stolen back in January and it's been covered and the person who took it was a part of the mob and he uh has come back to the Lord because of the way I'm treated please and I will and I won't prosecute and the police are standing right here when we come in the car and they were amazed and I all this stuff is backed up in the lobby and I offered them a ride and she's said I am just amazed that here we go we steal your car and you want to help us amen and you got kidnapped in Mexico and we just got back years ago he escaped he jumped off in one story building and you can see the shackle box on his ankles in his hands and he called me and as we talked he had a turnaround in Mexico when he was in shackles he realized it was the end of the line and when he got back he called him up here in the message praise the Lord God's still mindful he's still alive yes he's still searching saving amen who are we to say that there's no more who are we to say there's only one more it's up to him amen amen and there might be no more there might only be one more but there might be a million more we don't you know we just want to be vigilant to do what he calls us to do there's one out there that we can find and do something to help amen anyone else amen appraisal or even offered prayer yeah this is a real simple uh testimony it happened to me again um that I misplaced my wedding band and I prayed and no I'll take it back I first started looking and I just got a little upset and somewhat frantic and um it means a lot to Leah for me the place where and I prayed Lord forgive me you know I need to seek your guidance and I just sat down and rested and I went back to the place I've checked twice before there were once yeah amen it's been you know God can lead us he's real praise the Lord that much more with all my eyes thank you Jesus did the same thing with Sonia the week before last really you know not last week when I wasn't here but yeah she lost her ring it was her wedding ring yeah yeah amen the Lord led her right to where it was thankful for that anyone else real quick let's stand to our feet if we could then let's turn our Bibles to Saint John chapter 16. Saint John chapter 16. miss my family today you know Michael made a good point the other day Tabitha sang for the Lord last week and was going to sing this song today and the Lord struck her throat that's where he likes to hit amen but uh the greater seed that's in her amen Saint John chapter 16 we'll read a few verses of scripture but before we do we just fire our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus we're very thankful again Lord of this place of this day this time Lord that you've give us to come in from out of the world Lord to celebrate Lord every Sunday morning we come here to celebrate in our celebration Lord is you God we celebrate you we worship you exalt you praise you but Lord this day that's been set aside this day that from two over two thousand years ago when you Rose from the grave Lord we celebrate knowing that you are here that you are alive that you are the same yesterday today and forever that Lord you broke yourself up into a mini-membered body which you live in us through us today God to show this world that you are still alive that you are still the same we thank you God for being ever present in all of our lives and for being with us in this service Lord and for the spirit that we felt and to know that you are real God yes there is none like you every God is every other God of religion every other God of worship is dead and and gone and and and the inanimate object a statue of some kind or something but you are alive you are living you're in US Lord and we thank you for being here with us today we pray God that your Holy Spirit would once again have the preeminence in this service Lord would rebuke every demonic spirit that would hurt hinder or try and filtrate this service in any way that all that is said and done that you would get the glory praise and honor for it yes thank you Lord for these that are here today those who may be watching Lord make just everything you do God be set forth for this service Lord just anoint us speak to these lips anoint our ears Lord receive what you'd have for us today God we commit this service to you and all things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen Saint John chapter 16 we'll read a few verses and let you be seated these things have I spoken unto you that you should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogue yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that they doeth God of service and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me but these things have I told you that when the time shall Come Ye uh you may remember that I told you of them and these things I said not unto you at the beginning because I was with you but now I go my way to him that sent me and none of you ask me whether thou goest but because I have said these things unto you sorrow had filled your heart nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for for you for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you you could be seated if you'd like amen I want to speak of course Easter is a little bit of a Twist on it uh you know he has a risen but the twist I want to give to it today is uh and the title of the message today is a greater work a greater work that was a it was a fantastic thing that Jesus was here and it was it was an extraordinary thing and of course if you're one of the disciples there and you're with Jesus and you have the Revelation to know who Jesus was it was quite an outstanding thing to live in that day to rub elbows with him to break bread with him to drink wine with him to enjoy his company and to see the Miracles and all the things that took place and and just to be a part of it had to have been just the outer body experience I mean what kind of verbiage could you put on that I mean really if you were there and and a part of that and having him with you and how important it was to have him with you but God had after that work was to be completed there was a greater work that God had that he wanted to get accomplished and to understand that that greater work was to be manifested through a mini-membered body that God said I need to go away in fact he told them it is expedient it is important it is it is of grave importance that I leave it's important to you he said did you imagine if you were standing there and God Jesus looked in you and said it's important expedient for you that I go away could you imagine how you'd think why would it be expedient for me that you live me we love you we want you here we want you by our side we want to keep walking with you talking with you learning from you we want to keep seeing the Miracles and being a part of your life well of course any normal human thinking that that is in that position would feel that way but there was a greater work that God had that he needed to accomplish and that was that he would die and raise again and come back and live in millions of people so that the greater work that God had to accomplish would be accomplished he spoke to them and told them as much let's go through it again he said I've spoken these things that you should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues yea in the time cometh that they will kill you amen and that doesn't necessarily mean with a sword or a gun although it did come to that point especially through the Dark Ages but even in this last day even with the human tongue people are killing one another's character uh hating one another Without a Cause which the Bible says is murder and killing you thinking that they're doing God a service they think they're doing a work of God by doing this to you when in fact Jesus said those that do that don't know me or the one that sent me Ah that's pretty strong Saints but that's what Jesus said because these things look now and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me but these things have I told you that when the time comes let's speak through this a little bit that when the time shall come ye may remember you may remember that I told you these things that I told you of them amen this will come to your remembrance now what's he preparing them for he's preparing them for his departure yes he's preparing them to live out the life that God had predestined for them after his going away and he's telling them after I'm gone away you're going to remember that I told you these things it's going to come back to your remembrance that I told you of them and these things I said unto you at the beginning because I was with you see there's that separation there's that differentiation between the time that Jesus was with them and told them how expedient it was that he go away yeah yes for them Expedia for them that he go away but he says I've told you these things and I've done these things with you because I was with you amen but now I go my way to him that sent me and none of you asking me whether thou goeth or where go where the uh whether goest out but because I have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart now of course it would I I got it and obviously I you know we can look back at the picture and understand the bigger picture but they didn't have that then all they had was Jesus right there and they wanted him to stay right there and I don't blame them if I had been there I would have wanted to him to stay right there too I would have never wanted Jesus to go away I would have wanted him with me always I'm sure people uh and please don't get me wrong I am not uh trying to make brother random God but I imagine that people that lived with brother Banner or spent time with Brother Brad was were around brother Brown regularly and one of those people was brother green which I spent a lot of time with for about 20 years so I come to understand you you wouldn't want that to happen you wouldn't want that person to go away I mean I just think of that as just in a nominal sense for my family or my wife uh I would never want to live I may have to someday but I'd never want to live one moment on this planet without her but wouldn't want to I wouldn't want her to go away and and you think of it in a greater sense in a spiritual sense you wouldn't want Jesus to go away he's become your Palace become your buddies become your friend he's become your Confidant he's become everything to them there amen everything that they had everything they were they dropped and left everything that they did their livelihoods their their careers everything that they had they walked away from it just to follow him and now he's telling them it it's expedient it is important it is needful for you that I go away can you imagine the the the the thoughts that will come in their minds and and thinking why would it be good for me if you left me the only reason I left my family the only reason I left my job the only reason I left my livelihood and everything about like the only reason I did all that is because of you and now you're going away but see they didn't understand right but they would and Jesus told them you will know it will come to you and you will know but see it's one of those things as humanity is humans that we're uncomfortable with and that's the unknown when we don't know something it becomes very uncomfortable to us and when somebody says something and say well it's going to be this do this we don't know that it becomes a very uncomfortable situation and I'm sure as much as they believe in trusted Jesus it was a very uncomfortable situation for them even though he was telling them that of the unknown to say it when you're gone what are we supposed to do now amen and he said but you will remember amen I'm telling you these things because I'm here with you and when I'm not here with you you'll remember it it'll come back to your remembrance nine nevertheless even though they were so nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient to you for you that I go away how could anybody think that it would have been better for them if Jesus weren't with them I I couldn't imagine that amen how could you think in a in a body form again stepping into the unknown in a bodily form how could you think that him not being here would be better than him being there but that's what he told him how many times does God say that to us but see God always knows the better way God always knows what's more important for us God always knows what what is going to be beneficial to us down the road and sometimes it makes us uncomfortable sometimes it makes us sad sometimes it makes us sorrowful sometimes it makes us wanting amen but God knows that once we get beyond that point it's going to be better for us in the other situation and he's telling him it's going to be better for you than I'm going away amen why Jesus why for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you now at one time see the disciples were living now in so much of a sense of the word the disciples were living a very comfortable life amen they were living a very easy life because Jesus was with them everything was on him everything was about him the focus wasn't on them the focus was on him everything about him when they came it was about Jesus what they did it was about Jesus when there was decision made Jesus made it when there was something that needed to be done Jesus did it he was with them yes but it was easy for them because everything was on him it becomes the same thing uh uh today amen but God doesn't want us in a lazy chair God doesn't want us in a flowery bed of ease he wants us gird up our loins and ready to ready for battle Emma Emma he wants us moving he wants us living he wants us doing for him amen not just sitting back and letting him do it but us do it yes yes he does it but how does he do it today he does it through us he uses your hands he uses your feet he uses your mind he uses your muscles he uses your personality he uses your gifts he uses your intelligence yes amen everything that God's give you he gave you for a purpose some people look and say well I'm tall why I'm short why I'm a male why I'm a female why I was grown in this house why with these parents I I I was born in this place I was raised in this city I was but but why why does all that happen because God predestined and ordained it to be so remember brother green said that brother Branham told him that God now forget pardon me if I forget some of the details but brother green says that brother Brown told him that God brought his dad from so and so a place and his mother from so and so a place to meet it so and so a place to fall in love get married to fruit to to breed this is his words to breed him amen that's exactly what he said that's what brother green said many times God had Perry Lee and his mother to come from places need Fallen up to breed Perry green then who are we to say amen the Lord brought me 2300 miles from Charlotte North Carolina Tucson Arizona's godforsaken country I thought it was at the time amen I hated it here uh with a passion I lived for two things honestly Saints when I came here as a 14 year old kid I lived for two things that was to draw my next breath and get out of Tucson that's the only two things I lived for then a couple weeks later I met my wife and everything changed after that not everything but a lot of it changed but send me out here to do what oh how many times how many things could I tell you the testimony of how God brought me and my wife together yeah amen it just it's just one Miracle after another why God put us where he put us and moved on my dad to have us in the place that we're you know that I actually I out I was late getting I'll give you this one uh there's there's several of them I'll give you this one I was late coming here because school in North Carolina started later than it did here so the high school here had been going on for two or three weeks before we ever moved here even though it just started in North Carolina so I was behind so I couldn't get the classes I wanted I was gonna drop ban I was never gonna be in band again but because I couldn't get the classes they're like they're saying well there's only this elective and this elective left and I'm like okay I guess I'll I guess I'll go back into the band again guess where I met my wife in band I was never going to be in band again I was I was I and I ended up because I was so mad and I was so discouraged and I hated this place and wanted to go back home that I just smoked around I ended up sitting in the locker room and a teacher come by and said where are you supposed to be well I said I have no idea I don't care he said well come with me he was the Freshman teacher of PE and Sonia was in his class I was a sophomore and ended up in a freshman's PE class just so I could be with her amen you say what you want but that's the truth a sophomore was in a freshman's PE class because the teacher just come and said okay come with me you'll be in my class now why did a teacher do that why didn't he just say well give me your schedule who's supposed to be your teacher what grade are you in nothing he said well come with me and I ended up that whole semester and my wife's PE class which is a freshman class that I wasn't supposed to be you explain that right amen and that's just one of them well I guess that's two actually the band that God did just Miracle why God's in control and if and I hated it here but God had me here for a reason I couldn't stand this place but God had a purpose yes amen I may never know the exact purpose behind it all you look back and you see this this and this this but God knows whatever it is that's up to him amen all we try to do is become obedient amen live the life that God would have us to live and be what he wants us to be that's all we can do but that's what he expects of us amen even though it makes us uncomfortable even though it was making these disciples uncomfortable he said if I don't go the greater work can't manifest itself in and through you if he was still here that greater work could not be accomplished because it was all on Jesus they had it easy because it was all on him amen it wasn't on them but when he finished his work here when Jesus went away they went into the upper roof it became their time now it has become our time this is our time this is the bride time this is the bride revival time it is up to us to fulfill that purpose that God died and went to hell and rose again and came back upon us it's our time to prove and to live the point the purpose that God put us here for yes amen and it is not forgive me Saints but it is not to just for the purpose of turning oxygen into carbon dioxide God put us here for a greater purpose than that let us find what that purpose is a certain gender you're a certain race you speak a certain language you all these things God did to mold your character your personality to make you who you are I mean I if I tried long enough and hard enough and and really focused for a long enough period of time I might could play the piano like Micah but I don't have a desire to do that somehow that desire skipped right over me and landed right on him and from the time I can remember he's had such a passion for music amen but there's a reason for that yes God has that for a purpose and reason pardon me if I speak of myself or my family but I know us better than you amen but you can look back in your own mind and think of those things and identify yourself in the scripture with that yes just like they were with that see there was that purpose see when he was here it was his time but when he went away and rose again it became our time it became the disciples time and now it's our time here today this is our time amen let's look in Saint John chapter 14. Saint John chapter 14 just the page over verse 15. if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that now look look at the verbiage that Jesus is giving to his disciples here now he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth which was Jesus whom the world cannot receive which was Jesus because it sealed him not neither knoweth him speaking of himself but ye know him for he dwelleth with you again speaking of himself and shall be in you he's he's telling them of the manifestation of what took place at the damn Pentecost of the upper room he said when the Holy Spirit Come it was with him and it lit on them and went in them Jesus is telling that very thing dwelleth with you with you and and is a conjunction joins the two parts together shall be shall be in you so now look before when Jesus was here it was shall be in you amen when he was here let's continue to read though I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that I am in the father of the father in me uh in my father and ye and me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judah said unto him not as curious Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself to us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words there's the difference amen I love my wife now this is just in the physical form I love my wife thus for the past 40 plus years I've come to know my wife better than the rest of the world nobody knows her like I do they're Secrets I know that nobody else knows and vice versa amen but it's because I love her Jesus said if you love me you'll do what I tell you yes you'll keep my Commandments you'll do my work amen he said if you if if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and he will come unto him and make our Abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine and the Father which sent me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is noticed he says that over and over here now while I'm with you again Jesus differentiating and setting aside the part of the with you part to the expedient of going away to the greater work part amen the greater work these things have I spoke yet being present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled need let neither Let It Be Afraid yeah I've heard now I said unto you I go away and come again unto you if you love me ye would Rejoice because I said I go unto the father for the father is greater than I and now I have told you before it come to pass that when it has come to pass you might believe Hereafter I will not talk much with you God's skin making that separating point he's giving them the time of the change it's changing over and I talk much with you for the prince of this world coming and have nothing in me but that the world may know that I love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so I do also uh that I do arise let us go hence he's giving them a a parable and a reality of understanding this is what I do and now here is what it is and what you've seen up to here is be has been me with you but a greater work time is coming to where I'm going to go away and the one that raised me is going to come in you the comforter is going to come in you and you are then going to become disciples you are going to be Messiah says brother Brandon would call them you with the spirit of God in you will be led by the spirit to live according to the word and God will take care of you and watch over you yes it was up to that point Jesus always referred you go and look through the gospels Jesus always referred and said shall be shall be but now notice afterwards let's go to First Corinthians after that time when God spoke and he spoke in his word and he spoke through men it was no longer shall be it transitioned when Jesus rose from the grave it changed everything every man to that point had stayed in the grave every man that had uh that had lost their breath and had died and gone in the grave was still there when Jesus rose again it changed everything right right praise God amen and it changed them change them of Greater work than even when he was here praise the Lord did he not did not he say that he told them that Greater Works shall you do they did not tell them that greater work shall you do amen look First Corinthians shall it shall be in you first Corinthians 6 19. Paul says what no ye not that your body is amen is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you amen no longer shall be the transition has confirmed it's been changed it's been completed it is no longer shall be in you which Jesus said it is now is in you praise God that transition changed mankind from being just in one man amen just like that spider on the wall from one man to a mini-membered body to multi millions of people since the day of Pentecost yes that have come into this truth and believed his word and accepted Christ as their Savior and been born again from that time to this time Millions have gone around the world even when the disciples started it once it was Jesus and they followed him amen they didn't go away from Jesus they followed Jesus where he went that's what that's where they went with that's what they did when Jesus left this one went that that way this one went that way and this one went that way so it wasn't just one man and a bunch of people following him to one city it was a man going to this city and a man going to that City and a man going to that City and it was and when when God changed it from him to that greater work it wasn't just that one city it was a dozen cities that was hearing the gospel it became to the point that uh that that Paul and Barnabas got into such contention which we talk about today it became in such contention with each other that they had to separate because Paul had to go that way and Barnabas had to go that way right why so more people could really come yes the greater work was to be done people were to see the manifestation of Jesus Christ working in their midst they wanted to feel it become a part of it for that Spirit to fall on them it wasn't just for the upper room Saints that's that those gifts of the Spirit that Spirit falling on them it wasn't just for those of that 120 in that Upper Room it was to whosoever Will if we believe and receive it and Obey that word it is for us just as much as it was for them yes and the disciples didn't keep it to themselves and say oh thank God now I got it let me go find an easy chair somewhere and sit down all right I'm just going to enjoy my life now now they got busy about the father's business amen they went around telling as much as the Lord would leave amen as much as the Lord would lead now you know me if a person wants to go and do you go and do and that's up to you and that's on you but if God leads you God is obligated to take care of you right right God is obligated to let the words be manifested in their lives where God sends you if God sends you to somebody then you can know that that's God that's doing work for them amen you don't hide it under a bushel you don't keep it to yourself the greater work says to go even to all the world and preach the gospel amen and we do that as God gives us utterance thankfully by the grace of God I'll uh I may never know why the Lord blessed me with the job I have now and I like it I'm thankful for it that I I can stand before you as a group of people and God is my witness that those men have changed since I've been there every one of them the curmudgeon I told you about he's no longer a curmudgeon he's become one of my best friends he's become one of my greatest advocacy uh uh advocates amen one guy's even quit drinking he stopped drinking at first he quit drinking beer and I talked to myself what was the point of that last this whole week last time I never saw him drink a drink he didn't tell me he quit drinking but I didn't see him drink one alcoholic beverage amen God has a reason there's a purpose with everything sings all you got to do you don't have to go preach the people but just let your light shine Paul said I become all things to all men that I might win some yeah we forget that sometimes yes because we become so Pious and holier than thou and up on our high horse and preaching down to people that we forget that they're human Souls were 10 million worlds yeah yeah Amen to try to help understand and become as they are that you might get them to understand wow there's really something to this this person is not just spouting a bunch of garbage or hyperbole to me he means what he says he stands behind his convictions there's a reason there's things that happen Saints and it's God that does it it's God working through US amen and he continues to work through us but notice once it was all in him now it's not when he rose again the greater work began to take place he came on them in the upper room just like he told them when he was with them and since that time he's poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh now not all receive it amen that anointing is everywhere of course but the the indwelling presence of the holy spirit is for those that believe it love it receive it now brother Graham said receive it he said that's the that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost is receiving the word for your day yes amen it's not love it's not all these evidences it's receiving the word for your day and if you receive the word that means you're going to live it yes you're going to live by it it's going to be more than words to you yes amen you're going to live what he said and Jesus said if you love me now that just conversely brings it right back around Jesus said if you love me that's agape love if you love me you yes keep my words amen that's what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is not the love but that you obey his word amen Jesus said that himself those who love me obey me that do what my word says do amen no ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods amen God living in us now through us to prove he's the same Romans 8. I got a couple more scriptures here I'm going to close Romans 8. amen Romans 8 verse 10 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but now look at what look at how Paul identifies this to the Roman Church because he's differentiating between the spirit of man and the body of man right if Christ be in you the body is dead the outside because of sin amen unbelief why this outside man is fed by a sea tasteful smell here not faith the outside man doesn't live on faith the outside man is Reliant upon the Inside Man to bring the faith to to a to manifestation in his life in his body but the body doesn't operate on faith it operates on what you can see right or what you can feel or what you can know or understand amen the spirit the body the spirit's the life of the body the spirit is Imagination affection reason memory what you can think about what you can see what you can reason and that's what the world lives by that's what they all depend upon that's why you see through this cover thing all them doctors get done saying that they know this and they know that and this is this and this is that and two three years later we find out that 90 of what they told us three years ago is wrong right but that's all they had and I don't fault them for that right what I fought them for is acting like God yes yes that's what I fought them for and staying in front of everybody saying I am science no you're not you're just a man who's going on the evidence you had at the time the best you know don't present yourself to me as God you are not God amen and and what we see and what we see continuing to manifest itself that's that's what the body understands to live by but that's all the world knows that's all they know friend amen and and that's what they live by and that's okay I don't fault them for that but we live by faith but the faith doesn't come from your body even your human Spirit it comes from the soul the inside that regulates to the spirit and regulates to the body that says I don't care what I can't see I don't care what I can't feel or taste I believe it anyhow am I because God's word says it amen amen amen the body didn't reason that this the the soul of man cried out that says this is what I believe amen only way it can be done not by the human Spirit not by the body that's why Paul said the body is dead if Christ being you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken what your mortal body praise God Paul here says if the if Christ be in you the body is dead but then he says if Christ be in you the body is uh uh if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up Christ from the devil will Quicken your mortal body it's no longer dead in sin it's been quickened praise the Lord amen your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you leave after the flesh you shall die but if you do if ye through the spirit do mortify or that is deaden or kill the Deeds of the body ye shall live what are the Deeds of the body see taste a little smile here imagination effects from reason conscience amen which is amen you are dead but if we kill those things well if we kill those things and what happens then the soul of man is what begins to take over yes amen and that's where faith is and the soul of man begins to permeate itself through the spirit and through into the flesh so that you begin to live according to the dictates of your soul not your spirit or your sea tasteful smell amen it mortifies kills demons the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God amen God doesn't lead you by your brain yes God doesn't lead you by your eyeballs he does not lead you by your taste buds he leads you by the spirit that is in you not your human Spirit but his spirit that is in you yes how did that come about because he told them I will not only just be with you but I'll be in you in you praise God to work the greater workers manifested itself now the greater work is manifesting itself through us it is our responsibility to fulfill that greater work to live that greater what to let that greater work continue to manifest itself through US yes the purpose that God still has left on this planet whatever it may be we discussed earlier it may be a soul maybe one may be ten maybe a million we don't know but if God's manifesting himself through us then others will see Jesus in US yes amen others will come to know Jesus simply because they know you you say well that's a stretch brother you know it's not how else are these people going to see Christ if they don't see Christ in you that's right where else is he he's not in a flesh mortal body anymore he's not in the corporate body like he was with the disciples where is he where can he be found in me in you and the greater work that we are to do people talk about the gray word speaking in tongues and prophecy and all these gifts know the greater work is living the life of Jesus Christ being God before people letting God see that this world is not the way Jesus is the way this world does not have the truth or the life Jesus is the truth the life the way and if they can see that maybe they get just a little glimpse even if you just help make their lives a little bit better yes friend this life may be all that some people have and if you can do something even just to make that life that they're living now better wouldn't you want to do it they're gonna have but it seems like a lot of times we want we want we want them to be miserable I if this is all then yet does God make people miserable so they'll turn to him sure absolutely you can amen God can absolutely God can absolutely turn a person amen all right remember brother Dennis prayed about the Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young Ruler turned God down and what happened he got richer amen amen he got richer he didn't get miserable he God didn't make his life so miserable that he decided to come back to God he got richer and and begin to exhort that this this was the blessings of God this is God working his life in me where'd he end up we know where he ended up yeah yeah that's why I've always sinned time and time again if people leave the word leave church leave Christ and the and their lives don't get worse if they get better or more prosperous at worries me because that's not uh you're you're you're not if you're a child of God and you leave God your life isn't going to be peachy King right amen God can make your life so to the places you're like you know I am so mid think about the The Prodigal Son it took him to get in such a miserable condition that he was willing to stick his head down in the food that a pig eats before he came back to himself his life became so miserable he didn't leave his daddy and start prospering and and greatness happened to him no he was the son of the king he was the son of of his father so his life became more miserable right his life had got so miserable that he came back to himself right and that's when he went back home amen you understand what I'm saying Jesus said Paul said to the Roman Church that their lives that you could mortify the Deeds of the flesh amen killed dead Colossians chapter one you know just have a couple more scriptures I want to read Colossians chapter 1 verse 27. Colossians 127 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you not shall is amen amen praise the Lord whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man at all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ in Christ Jesus where unto also labor striving according to his work which worketh mightily in me one more first John chapter 4. very familiar first John 4 4. year of God little children and hath overcome them because greater you have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world what's that saying you have overcome but you never come on your own a president's son or you're the King's son you you overcome because greater because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you overcome the world because what's in the world is not as great as what is in you amen what's in you is greater than what's around us what is EU is greater than what's in the world what's in you is greater than any and everything else so greater is he that's in US amen amen than he that's in the world so you overcome praise God you overcome let me understand unless you understand this it's not God overcoming it's you overcome but the only reason you can overcome is because he is in you praise the Lord amen I'm glad he's Arisen Saints amen I'm glad he's the grave couldn't hold him death couldn't hold him hell couldn't hold him he rose from the grave and he is alive he is the same yesterday today and forever living through his many member body the greater work that he promised in the scripture that he would now it's not to the degree that Paul went through we're living in a different age it wasn't to the degree that the disciples had when they were going into these cities and all it's it's a different age but nevertheless we are still called with the same Commission amen the commission go into all the world has not changed it's a different manifestation today because we're in a different age we're at the end you know we're at the end time yes praise the Lord they were at the beginning time were multised of millions of people was to come in after and according to that Ministry and work today we're at the end it's a it's a gleaning time if we're even still bleeding but that's up to God Amen we still do it nevertheless thank God yes thank God our God is arisen amen amen there's not another religion in the world could spend this Sunday morning claiming proclaiming the same thing at least not be truthful anyway yes but our God is risen that's the thing that changes us from them our God is not dead our God is original our God is alive amen they're standing because praise the Lord very much living in us when we see that when we sing that song friend it's very important to understand he's living in us to tell the world that he's the same and he doesn't just live in us just because he's got nothing better to do he lives in us to tell the world through us that he is the same amen praise the Lord he's the same today and I'm thankful he's the same today that's one way we can have faith and confidence in him because he is the same if God changed like the rest of us changed how could you have confidence in that is any person ever promised you something and they didn't do it I've had a lot of people in my life promise me things that never happened may not have been their fault didn't matter they promised it it didn't happen God has never promised one thing that didn't happen that didn't come to pass because he's God we can trust him and have faith in him he's a faithful loving just God amen he's a just God praise the Lord in that listing is a little song here it's 350 in the book we'll have it here on the screen [Music] need some words out of the book here to follow along 350.
