you have to desire amen praise the lord i believe that today praise the lord jesus no name under heaven amen all right but jesus amen it doesn't just do something to you know people can say that name all the time people can take that name in vain people can go to church and say it but you know when it's really in the heart of a believer when you speak that name it just does something to you oh my when it comes across my lips it just man it just my heart just explodes amen wonderful wonderful praise the lord amen i've always enjoyed that course i haven't sang it much maybe since the tabernacle because it's not in these song books but it's a i really enjoy that song of worship amen so god bless you today welcome to the house of the lord appreciate each one of you coming and being here today amen we're a little short on people some people missing today some heard from some didn't didn't sherida texted me said art had been had been working 10 12 hours every day this week and i meant to put that down as a prayer request so please forgive me i forgot to that want to pray that art had finds a different job better job doesn't have to work from the hours he'd be home in the evening with his

got that taken care of so um just continue to pray for his recovery and remember that prayer so amen god is good to us isn't he appreciate his goodness to us amen appreciate being here and appreciate you all being here today amen those are on the hook up amen welcome as well so god bless you we want to stand to our feet now and go into the scripture again we're going to go to revelation chapter 10 verse 7. revelation chapter 10 verse 7 read that verse of scripture as we probably as it looks like i'm going to finish up this thought that we had the mysteries of god in christ this will be part part 16 the mysteries of god in christ part 16 and the restoration of his kingdom part 3. so lord willing unless the lord does something else beyond this i feel like this would be the last one for here but we have something to follow up the lord willing next sunday from there and then just whatever the lord will christ what we want to do so we want to go back to revelation chapter 10 where we start the readings for this each time that we uh begin this so but before we read the word let's just buy our heads for another word prayer precious lord jesus father it is indeed a privilege lord there's people across across the world lord of different countries that are under threat of death or imprisonment just to speak that precious wonderful holy name of jesus that we just sung out so boldly lord in worship and praise to you praying god and believing that that worship was received to you as a sweet smelling savior god that you're invited lord to be here welcome to stay and without your presence father we just fold them up and just go home now but we're believing that you're here god we know that you're here you promised to be here where two or three are gathered in your name you'd be in the midst there's many of those more than two or three here today god so we expect and believe that you're here to do the exceedingly and abundantly to speak through these lips the words you'd have us to hear the anointing here as well to move upon those that are on the streaming now god that your hand would be upon them as well lord may what you have purpose and accomplish and uh determined in your mind and set and predetermined before the foundational world for this service to accomplish that it would be accomplished today through us your people father lord let that full expression of jesus christ continue to exude and to promote itself and live through us in every way god according to the purpose that you've called us to and in your perfect will father be led by your spirit in all things we are not ourselves we are bought with the christ and we believe god we read once again but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets you could be seated as you if you'd like thought another thing on here this uh scripture reading and the more you read it the more it stands out to you but another thing i saw here that god the mystery of god being finished completed or come to a a full understanding of fruition to his people because that's what this is focused towards as he had declared to his servants the prophets or we could say through his servants the prophets because that was really the main the main reason the main subject was it was through his servants the prophets amen it wasn't just to them it was through them amen last week we talked about it went through the kingdom god spoke and it became man uh manifested or or tangible or it became real became physical and then that's when god put adam and eve in the garden of eden and then the fall happened after the fall there came a time of uh god began to speak of a time of restoration to bring it back to that place and his words was in god's mind before the fall and i believe that's where god wants it to be now now uh luke 17 i want to read again these two verses 17 20 and 21. now he may not be uh too long this afternoon or this morning but however the lord would lead it but luke 17 verse 20 i want to read this scripture again to follow up from last week to bring us into the subject that i want to talk about today luke 17 20 when he was and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation we talked about that last week this part of that restoration that kingdom was not something that was tangible it wasn't something that was physical although jesus was standing there before them they said if jesus told him that this is happening and this is happening and these things are taking place that means that the kingdom of god has come unto you so what's he saying he's identifying himself who he is right there to those pharisees and sadducees to understand if this is happening and this is happening this has happened of course they called him uh beals above and he cast out devil devils by the o's above and you know the story the scriptural advent of that when he's explaining that to him he says well if this is happening this is heaven and i'm casting these out by the spirit of god that means the kingdom of god has come to you right so yes there was a tangible aspect of that as jesus was standing there but as he's saying here that kingdom that he's talking about was something that it was an an invisible thing right and uh anger it came and said upon them at like licks of fire like cloven tongues of fire which was a which was a visible evidence that you could see but it wasn't something that was uh that was a continual kingdom that you see that's all around all the time of course we've seen photos of uh of that spirit and of times where that has been photographed and you've seen it with brother branham and different ones and i've had other testimonies people say uh those things would be over a person or around a person or someone's preaching or things like that but it's not something that comes with observation it's not something to say hey you know let's move to tucson that's where the kingdom is now oh let's let's go to jeffersonville that's where the kingdom is no it's not at tangible places here say oh let's go to jerusalem no no it's going to be but it's not there now see so it's not with observation he says neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you amen of god is within you we talked about the welsh revival we talked about the bride's revival well the wealth revival was just something that was into mary that was happening the second eve bride of jesus christ has reached that place of restoration although there is could be a last seed to come in could be many seeds yet to come in we don't know we know we're at the very end and we know there can't be that much more but however god wants it to be right right we don't know but we do know that that full restoration has happened because why that the the revelation of the truth of the mystery of god who christ is has taken place when that took place then brother branham had fulfilled the purpose god sent him for and god took him home now that part falls on us on our position where who we are where we live now and in in that god's kingdom amen god's kingdom that kingdom that has been made for the king and the queen amen praise the lord now the king and the queen are going to have subjects we know that because they'll be those that uh that god that god the bride the judges white throne judgment that they the god we put on the right hand side that that actually inherit eternal life they're not bribed but they make it in and there's those that are cast into the lake of fire but those that are that are there they'll be those subjects now that goes into a whole other subject revelation 21 where it talks about the new king the uh the new the new jerusalem and the the city that comes down which we'll read a little bit of later but uh i don't want to get into that much more detail about it but anyway it's that restoration that time now the king and queen rest restored it's time for that physical kingdom to come that physical kingdom to set itself up that physical king be a place that is a dwelling place for for the king and the queen for god and his bride for christ and his pride that physical place that god has for us you know brother branham talked about uh you know in his younger days he always wondered uh when we go beyond this mortal reach are we just going to be like clouds floating around and say oh hi brother dennis and flo bye hey brother zach john yen would just flow by and we're just like clouds or something he said no all right we're not like that we're we're bodies right we we have bodies they're tangible bodies right they shake hands they hug now there's no sensation like human sensation but we live in these bodies these theophanies these word bodies that god has created glorified bodies so it's it's tangible so if that body is there that we are to be in then there's got to be a place that god has prepared for us to live in in these bodies otherwise what would be the point right if we're just floating around and just like uh you know floating and there's really no rhyme reason purpose and you just you know then what's the point but if it's tangible it's going to be tangible to meet it right if the body's a tangible the place we're going to is tangible right it's physical it's something that we can be in that we can enjoy that we can be a part of right amen that physical part that restoration now in saint john i enjoy reading the scripture quite a bit there's a lot if you really read into chapter 14 beginning with the first verse a lot to this we'll try to stay focused on our topic today but there's there's a lot just in these first few verses even but uh i i think it's probably a good verse to read every day you get up every day you wake up chapter 14 saint john chapter 14 verse 1 says let not your heart be troubled when all the things that's going on in this country in the world today that's probably a very good slogan or a very good saying scripture to put on your heart and mind even something on your mirror or something to say let not your heart be troubled am i right every day because it's so easy to wake up and see all the things that's going on and all the trouble and all the you know the disturbances whatever but jesus said let not your heart be troubled praise the lord you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you praise the lord jesus aren't you glad of that and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself and where i am there ye may be also whether i go ye no and the way you know thomas said unto him lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we get how can we know the way jesus said unto him i am the way amen i am the truth or excuse me i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me but now let's go back to that because uh again that that just those six verses has a has a lot in it um one of my favorite lessons in here is the fact that jesus is telling them something that they don't even know that they know right did you realize that yeah have you ever known that you could know something that you don't know you know this is something inside of the believer it produces something inside the bride that when it comes to time for you have a need to know you're going to know you may not know that you know now but you'll know that you know when the time comes and when that time comes you say praise the lord now jesus made it very simple for thomas and said well i am the way am i don't you know me if you know me then you know the way oh yeah that's true huh so simple but sometimes it becomes people want to make it more complicated than what it really is right it really isn't that complicated i hear people say well i've heard been going to church for years and i've heard a message preach and i've heard doctrines and i've heard this that the other and where has it gotten us well it better get us closer to god because if it's not there's something wrong with uh your version of the word because there's nothing wrong with the word and the word will not return void so if it's not accomplishing in you what it's supposed to then there's something wrong with you not the word right but what it's doing is it's producing something in us that we know we just may not know that we know right now we may not know it right but when you're faithful now when you read the bible and you pray you seek god you come to church you let the word speak to you you let god reveal it to you amen it becomes a part of you and you'll know it right you may not have need of it right at this moment but when you have need of it it'll be there brother branham said if you've been born again and have the holy ghost everything you need is in you right now amen you may not understand it may not even feel like it may not seem like it but it's there right and when you need it it'll be there when a rapture body changes when our loved ones begin to appear we'll know that'll be it you'll say well praise god that that that settled that part of it that ends it see but now let's go back uh i said it has a lot in these verses but let's go back to this in my second verse well let's read the first verse again i just love that don't you let not your heart be troubled i just wake up newton let not your heart be true amen you believe god believe also me in my father's house are many mansions now some of you hopefully all of you you understand what the scripture is saying through brother branham's teachings because in our now today translated english language this makes no sense in my father's house are many mansions well if you think about it in our united states current english vernacular it doesn't make sense it is physically impossible to put a mansion inside a house must list many mansions inside a house all right well a house can be 800 square foot thousand square foot how big is a mansion well in our vernacular a mansion is four or five thousand square foot or more probably probably not even probably bigger than that it's got to be bigger now to make a mansion right ten thousand this is a ten thousand square foot well how does ten thousand square foot many ten thousand square foot is going to fit in a 800 000 square foot house doesn't but if we see there's a couple places brother random talks about because he went back and studied and found out what the english understanding was at the time of the translation at the time of the king chains translation when it says in my father's house he was saying kingdom amen then a house was referred to as a kingdom right now don't get offensive but it was a man's domain he was considered the king of his domain and the house was his kingdom amen i guess it really could or should be the same today uh unfortunately the male uh gender has failed our society but anyway or most of them anyway right but the truth of it is that's what it used to be a kingdom was a house it was considered a house so when they translated it when it got down to a kingdom they translated it into a house a house is just a kingdom praise the lord so if that kingdom is now if you look at cinema in my father's kingdom or many mansions or palaces or places of dwelling then that makes much more sense right because god's kingdom is vast uh uh dares we say limitless god's kingdom clouds kingdom stretches sky the sky and uh north south east west up down around god's kingdom's everywhere so in god's kingdom are many dwelling places many palaces many places for his people to abide in so if you've got now that in my father's house in my father's kingdom are many dwelling places many palaces then it makes you understand in god's kingdom he has places for every one of us right amen brother random talked about the little log cabin about this dream right he said if you walk about you hear a uh uh you know like amazing grace or i know it was the blood or something like that i forgot exactly how brother brandon put it he said you know brother bill made it she's down there singing this by the grace of god or amazing grace or the blood of jesus christ or something he says you'll know bill made it why because you hear him singing and down in his cabin by the streets and i hope he doesn't mind sharing that cabin because that sounds awful good to me too actually being from north carolina the deserts are beautiful and don't get me wrong amen uh the the cactus will blossom like a rose but the beautiful mountain don't get me wrong i like that too but you know there's something just still in the heart when you grow up as a kid that's just still there that uh those the beautiful trees the greenery and the creek and the log cabin is beautiful he said you know bill made it so you think well there's got to be a dwelling place or a place of inhabitants for every one of us because remember again it's all tangible every bit of it's tangible it's it's a place a dwelling place we have a glorified body then we've got to have a place to to dwell in to live amen very much he says now in my father's kingdom in that kingdom now that's a physical kingdom that that's not the spiritual kingdom that's a physical kingdom that is actual place right we go to kingdom are many dwelling places he said if it were not so i would have told you i go and uh to prepare a place for you now you can put your name there i believe where everyone should put our names in that place god has gone to prepare a place for me right and he said if and if if it wasn't true i wouldn't have told you i said i would have told you it's not true but it's true i've gone to prepare that place now you can understand that scripturally spiritually too and say god has created a spiritual body for us as well that is a dwelling place too but we're talking about the physical kingdom the physical place that god's prepared for us to go and live in outside of this world outside of this cosmos god has created a place and prepared a place for each one of us to live he said and if i go and prepare that place which he's already done for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also so we're not going to be in this dwelling place alone he's going to be with us right he's going to be there present as well in this kingdom in this kingdom this place where there's no sickness there's no sorrows no death we talked about last week there's no more eyeglasses there's no more gray hairs there's no more aching backs there'll never be a shovel touch to ground to dig a grave there'll never be a siren sound out for an ambulance or a fire truck or a policeman they'll never be built a hospital or or cemeteries or anything like that right it's going to be perfect whole summer how can you describe perfect there's nothing better even in the hardest times even in the lowest times it's the absolute best life that a person can live amen let me read christ's mystery god revealed if he said now if you'll just bear with me a little bit now i don't want you to miss this i've got to take uh this tape now being started this far one more great remark i want to make if i have to move over a little of it brother brown's trying to he's trying to prepare the people that he's getting ready to say something outstanding or maybe people may not understand but get them in the position to realize that this is something that come from god amen now notice listen to this this is a great thing now is where we want to watch remember in the last days we'll exactly go back and vindicate the first day just like it did then it does now see adam and eve husband and wife no sin life uh then then the fall see so this end time where the restoration king and queen second adam second eve restored back will echo or bring back him to remembers what it was the first day back in time of creation where adam and eve walked upon the the ground that god had made in the garden of eden and perfection he said this day will be a res uh will be an echo or a vindication of that day see he talks about adam and eve husband and wife well what he's talking about is christ and his bride amen yes back to adam and eve course in the garden of eden but he's talking about now christ and the bride remember this seventh angel messenger was to finish that tried to go into that some as we've done in the past that's what brother brown's referring to through that ending up now through that gentile kingdom now notice lucifer in the last days is doing as he did at the first what did lucifer do the first thing that lucifer done was to separate the fellowship of god and man first thing satan did tried to accomplish actually did accomplish was to separate the fellowship between god and man he wanted to build him a united kingdom a greater splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater kingdom than michael christ had you notice how he's coupling what michael there the archangel with jesus christ amen you got it see that was the thing he was trying to get across to people you see people look at that they don't they don't realize or see that truth in the scripture and don't understand it that's why i had to take a vindicated seventh thing sabbath angel messenger prophet to come and bring that to the people bring that to us he said you got it now if you miss it raise your hands i'll do it again lucifer at the beginning his purpose in the heart isaiah 14 his purpose and heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than christ had is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more splendor than the kingdom of christ that's exactly what he's done right that's exactly what the world decries today oh we are so much better now than we were back then we are so much more technologically advanced we're so much more medically advanced we are so much more advanced in in every way we're better off now than we were then i'm sorry friend it was better just 50 years ago than it is today it was better in the beaver cleaver days than it is now people say well they have this they have this freedom and all these things that's going on and that has made the country of the world better internet social media vehicles now all this advancement that has been through satan's kingdom god has allowed and also prospered his children to use to further the kingdom of god right because if it weren't for the airplane which is satan's device nothing offensive being the pilot that's we live in satan's kingdom right i used to drive uber i got the car and i took off and that's how i made a living right that's satan's invention satan's eden to make money for myself my family church right but uh but those airplanes satan's devices has been used for men to get on and fly in a few hours what it used to take them weeks or months to go spread the gospel right we get in automobiles and cars and can go all over the place all over the country spreading the gospel where we used to have to get on a walk walker get on a horse take days weeks months to try to do what we do in a few hours now right brother roger before us has a streaming that reaches thousands of people every week just by standing right here exactly just by a mechanical device satan's in device right to say in my opinion it is not better now than it was then it's not better now than it was 50 years ago but see that's exactly what satan has done and that's exactly what he's called right they think that we're better off now even with all the murders killings plagues sicknesses uh diseases afflictions all the things going on now how many car wrecks did you hear about 100 years ago 120 years ago how many people died in a car wreck how many how many people got a hit pregnant women killed them and their baby 120 years ago in a car didn't happen then you say it's better now i say it's not but that's what's in the minds of people right people think oh we we have a better society today and millions of people murdered around the world every day right just in just in cities like chicago and new york in l.a and you got homeless people filling up every crack and crevice of this city around the country l.a san francisco new york they're going all over the place murders killings drugs people blame the people that uh blame the ones that are making the drugs well what about the ones that are addicted to the drugs if there wasn't an appetite for the drugs there wouldn't be a a a a drug person to make the drug and to sell it right they wouldn't make the drug if there wasn't somebody to take it right they wouldn't be flooding this country with fentanyl and and cocaine and meth and everything if there weren't people addicted to it if there weren't people taking it they wouldn't come here right because it wouldn't be profitable is it better now as it was then satan's kingdom satan has set up in this world the best kingdom that he could manage he has set up the best kingdom that he could come up with the very best that satan could do he has done in this world today and yet the hearts of people i know my heart but i believe the hearts of people out in the world today the hearts of people still are yearning for that great place of utopia why do you think disneyland's so popular right it's the happiest place on earth disney world disney happiest place on earth it's the utopia that you can go to you forget all your trolls forget all the things right you know the only thing you can't forget is how much money they suck out of your bank account that's what you can't get 50 for a hot dog or something right but it's the happiest place on earth you know got to work two weeks to get by a hot dog there but it's the happiest place on earth that's their utopia right that's they've substituted and yet you talk to people if you meet people and talk to people i've done as much as i used to driving but if you talk to people and you see people people just having the heart to want a utopia you know the defund the police people want to get rid of police i do too not in this world not in this country right but i don't want police but see what it is there's something in me that says that they're not even supposed to be here well they're here because this is safety it's the best kingdom he could come up with and the place and well amen all right and people's hearts still yearning for that place people's souls still yearning for that utopia yearning for that place they they think they're happy they think they're enjoying their parties they think they're enjoying their their drunkenness and their bars and their revelry and their sports and everything they think they're enjoying all that stuff friend but it's not making them happy if it was making them happy you the best he could do leaves people wanting very much the best he can you think all the culture all the things going on today brother brahm says do you think and he says more culture more beautiful more splendor than the kingdom of christ you see and not only that you see the churches have followed suit of course followed starting by the catholic church and they're great huge buildings and they're beautiful steeples and their stained glass windows and and all you know it's that that's what they're producing it's just monetary right wood glass right it means nothing what about the place for god to dwell right your brother and says now do you think we'll have automobiles in the millennium airplanes in the millennium see what lucifer is doing now the big fancy intellectual denominations are doing the very same thing gathering themselves together to do the same thing they are gathering and denominating themselves each one trying to beat the other because you know pulling this one and pulling that one across the light here and there and come to our church we got this better in our church we got this greater come to our church we got this beautiful you know just trying to pull people around and back and forth and that's exactly what they do they're gathering denominating themselves trying to be each other trying to beat the other one and now they've got so much splendor they don't know what to do but to unite with the catholic church lucifer again building a bigger kingdom to push out listen now lucifer building a bigger kingdom to push out those that don't believe in denominations and even take their church buildings and make store rooms and the pastors of such has no rights at all right my mind all right satan's eating that's right satan's kingdom we're operating in satan's kingdom operating in satan's eden friend but our kingdom is not of this cosmos that's right and the man and a man that is a god-sent man would never stay in a denomination after he hearing or seeing this if he got enough to go and look at it certainly i don't say that critically i say that truthfully notice in the last days lucifer is doing the same thing can't you see it the devil doing the same thing building up a hybrid church a hybrid members by hybrid knowledge instead of the word by intellectual menace that are born to give men building an intellectual kingdom that will outshine christ little bitty flock you see these great big churches we passed coming in here and you see our little humble thing that we got building which we're very thankful for yeah love it god's blessed us right he will zoom right by here not thinking anything about it well there must not be much to that there's hardly anybody there jesus said fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to do what give you the kingdom amen give you the kingdom and there is a place in that kingdom for you there is a place in that kingdom for us that god has prepared for us amen amen out of sean christ little bitty flock he talked about fallen angels then after that but we'll skip over that part the fallen angels is that's gotten it to the place of of satan's eden satan's kingdom today but we're not a part of satan's kingdom let's go to matthew chapter 13. we'll try to close it up here just a little bit matthew chapter 13 verse 10 i want to make it more personal now and we'll get to that kingdom here matthew 13 10. the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries plural plural now the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given who is it given to to know the mysteries of the kingdom it's given to the inhabitants of that kingdom right it's given to the ones who are the the inhabitants of the ones that dwell in that place that is our hope right if it's your home you got you got the understanding of whatever mysteries there are in that home if it's not your home you come to me and my wife's home you can walk in the door you can even go in the kitchen and you can look and say where are the plates because you don't know where the plates are right i do because it's my home right man where's the silverware you might guess but you might pull out every door before you get to the silverware i know where they are because it's my home you might go to the bedroom which drawer is the sock drawer or where where do you have your suits hanging where do you keep uh your extra soap or toilet tissue you won't know that but i know that because it's my home amen it is revealed to you it's not revealed to them it's revealed to you to know the father the kingdom because it belongs to us it is our home that way you know and you know where we go because god has revealed it to you right it's not for everybody else to know and not everybody else is going to know but it's for his bride to know and it's brought to her by revelation amen all the mysteries it's no longer a mystery where the silverware is in my home it's not a mystery i know where it is right amen it's like a revelation i told you comes a part of you right right you know exactly where it is it's not a mystery anymore because it's been revealed to you amen i might not have even been the one to put the silverware there in fact i didn't my wife did but i know where it is this is my home it's your home friends this is your home we're talking about this is our home this place that has many mansions in it many dwelling places i don't need to have something like they built up this mormon thing up on uh sunrise drive up there that i don't need something like that right amen oh that's a beautiful humanly splendored thing and it's pretty to look at that's all nice well and good friend but that's not what i'm talking about you know i don't need a 10 million dollar mansion and just just something to where i can be in his presence that's all that matters to me am i have my family there and i can be in his presence and we can dwell and live there forever that's all that's all that really matters to me but understand it's not given to them right it's given to you it's revealed to you because it's your kingdom it's it's your it's your home and we are the inhabitants of that home amen amen christ and mystery god revealed then we can see the marriage supper is at hand look we're starting to finish this up now the marriage supper is at hand now if i never again see you remember the marriage supper is at hand july 1963 i wasn't even born yet july 1963. brother graham said the marriage supper is at hand twice he even said remember if i never see you again the marriage supper is at hand so what can we think today if he said it then back then with that with that exuberance that significance and what can we think today and then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in the great millennium the taking up of the church and the destroying of the wicked now you know that's the ushering in of that we have the rapture that takes place we go to the marriage supper of the lamb that's why brother graham said the marriage supper is at hand it's at hand because we have our loved ones appear before us minimum 30 days and then we all go to meet him in the air and then we go to the marriage up to the lamb the tribulation takes place and god destroys this place and we come into the millennium we'll walk on the ashes of the wicked in that millennium time a thousand years we spoke of remember uh now i went and looked this up again because i wanted to i wanted to get this but i didn't print it but in the questions and answer series in 1964 brother branham talks about having a mate and he says if you have the wrong mate here you will have the right one in the millennium right he said that very much if you had the wrong fate here you will have the right one there and he says all wrongs will be made right there am i speaking about the millennium i i give that to you as a quote off the top of my head a few times but i wanted to relook at that and get all wrongs questions and answer series 1964. all wrongs will be made right there what is that that's that ushering in of that time we're talking about this is not that kingdom right it is it is uh a part of that that god has set for because that's a time element of the curse of of the world being broke of the original sin as we've said but that is not the kingdom he's talking about because after that we had the second resurrection uh gog and magog and in the white throne judgment right and that's when god cast those into the lake of fire and then you have the kingdom coming and setting up now this great millennium all wrongs will be made right there praise that sounds wonderful doesn't it amen thank you lord god you ever wonder what what wrongs he's talking about now you know he's referencing getting the wrong mate but then he says all wrongs wonder what wrongs he what would be the wrongs he's referring to interesting i i've never thought of that until it just struck me and i can't say i had the answer because i'm thinking you know our our first son was born with trisomy 13 died 36 and a half hours after he was born is that a wrong was that a wrong that would be made right i think it'll be made right in the understanding that we'll all be together he won't be dead any longer my family and whatever they won't be in the grave anymore i'll be together right but but the knowledge of of such a place of perfection right can can bring into perspective how anything that would have been considered wrong here will be made right there will be right i'll praise the lord i'm so thankful and taking up the church destroying of the wicked the world sixth seal to purify by volcanic to take all the corruption and sin of the world to mold her out again and bring forth a bright new millennium for the age that is to come praise the lord when we see all these things great threefold revelation look now again great threefold revelation he's talking about god in christ christ in the church the kingdom coming amen the three things we've been on the past few months god in christ christ the church kingdom coming adam and eve redeemed back to the garden of eden to be restored according to his purpose restored king and queen adam and eve restored back to its proper place restored back into its position that it's supposed to be in as the inhabiters what do we inhabit revelation chapter 21 revelation chapter 21 we all surely know this scripture we get past the white throne judgment revelation 20. gog and magog and the right throne judgment those that are cast in the lake of fire satan and all of his servants cast into the lake of fire and then verse chapter 21 verse 1 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth now peter talks about it too but we're not getting to that because that's a whole nother uh future home sermon if you will uh which lord willing we may get to some time and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away we talked about that two-word phrase last week passed away from one form to another not annihilated but just from one form to the other and the earth and the first earth pathway and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband can you just envision what john saw now remember brother ram tells us at the spot where abraham had communion with melchizedek at the spot where jerusalem says today that our current president brought our uh made the capital of israel that spot uh in our minds god's gonna push up a pyramid-shaped mountain out of the earth amen out of the earth it's going to be an incredible thing you think well how's that going to happen well out of the mountains here the mountains here were pushed up out of the earth right but a pyramid shaped mountain will appear out of the earth and this city will come and descend down upon that pyramid as a bride adorned for her husband now that i i think he put it that way just for the simple fact that there's probably nothing more beautiful in a person's mind than a bride preparing herself for her wedding day or on her wedding day her wedding day is the day that she is to be the most beautiful feel the most beautiful look the most beautiful of her entire life amen is on her wedding day and this is a bride adorned for her husband coming forth and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with man and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away all of those things have been passed away and all that's been passed away then becomes new in this perfect place that god is setting up for his bride this perfect place that god said he's already gone and prepared for us this perfect place that is beyond imagination beyond thought that these tangible glorified bodies will be able to go in living and dwell be a part of one another our lives together it just it sometimes just goes beyond works it escapes us to be able to describe it and the splendor and magnificence that it is and it's hard to fathom it's hard to fathom with everything we see today right with all that's going on in this country this world today it's it's actually hard to fathom there's a place like that there's a place god's prepared he's coming to take us to that place right amen he said if i prepared it i told you i prepare it i will come and i will get you thessalonians says in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen will be caught up to meet him in the air so shall we ever be with the lord yes christ the mystery god revealed he said but when the great ransom body through all ages come up then that's going to be a great throng there revelation 7 expresses a great number which no man the bible has revealed to them now we know that wesley had more light than luther did we know pentecost outshined wesley see certainly it does because it gradually let loose as it did down through the prophets so forth perfectly made known the godhead bodily in christ and now the christ in the church is just being made known what was that revelation 10 7 christ in the church just being made known revealed the mystery christ amen be made known the whole thing is the revelation of god back to her right position again with her husband yes who is that eve the bride back to her husband not the first adam jesus christ the second adam in my heart restored to bring them back again the revelation the whole thing is the revelation of god to take eve back to her right position again with her husband and god is the husband of the church and the church is his pride look christ if you uh christ in you makes him the center of life the revelation see christ's life inner of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible a complete revelation of christ christ in you christ in christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing right amen see what god's trying to do what is this new birth then say well brother branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you to restore bring back this bride to a rightful position right to bring back the king the queen to bring back and restore this kingdom in you first in us now to take us that was only the preparation to take us to that place of physical rest to take us to that place of physical splendor to take us to that utopia to take us to that place of perfection i don't know about you friend but i'm looking forward to that time i'm going to do everything god help me help us to do everything we possibly can while god gives breath in our bodies to do something for him amen to tell others to lead others whatever we can do for jesus christ while he gets breath in our body friend but when he's done when i'm done when he's finished with me then i'm ready to go very much i'm looking towards that place amen i'm looking towards that place and it's a place of perfection holiness righteousness i hear people sometimes in the world say oh if it was if it was like that it would be so boring i'll take it first you can have all this i'll i'll take the boring if it's boring to you i'll take the boring right amen because i won't have to worry about waking up to a loved one being gone or something like that or being sick or another pandemic or something like that right amen amen praise the lord the love of god the love of god cast out all fear amen amen all right praise the lord i'm looking forward to it aren't you yes god bless you let's stand if we could praise the lord jesus i thank god for making the way and preparing the place for us let's sing this little course if we could amen song number 457 amen that sounds like home to me thank you jesus that sounds like home to me what a place it will be paul said i have not seen hear not heard neither has he entered in the heart of man what god has got in store for his people so as much as we can hear it much as we can preach it as much as we can read it in the bible and imagine in our minds there's really no way to grasp what it really is going to be like amen amen i think it's going to be beyond human comprehension i believe it's going to be beyond what our minds in this life can even conjure up in all the imaginations and things that we can think of just like i think in all the imaginations and minds and things that people can conjure up for evil and zombies and halloween and all that garbage all the evil and the wickedness doesn't even touch what it's going to be like in hell right doesn't even touch it but it doesn't touch what it's going to be like for us lions can't even fathom how great it's going to be how good it's going to be you think about the best thought or the best feeling you've ever had in this human life and multiply it by 10 trillion wow and you and we might get a little idea amen you do that on the wicked side too the most wicked thing you've ever heard or saw it multiply it by 10 trillion and you might get a little glimpse of what hell is going to be like oh praise the lord 4 57 let's sing it to him now that sounds like home to me like where i want to be there'll be no tears [Music] as we sing of his grace and glory where the saints of god will be all that sounds like home to me oh that sounds like hold to me like where i am [Music] as we sing of his grace in where the saints of god will be all that sounds like all to time now that sounds like all to me like where i want to be no [Music] tears again as we sing of his grace and glory where the
