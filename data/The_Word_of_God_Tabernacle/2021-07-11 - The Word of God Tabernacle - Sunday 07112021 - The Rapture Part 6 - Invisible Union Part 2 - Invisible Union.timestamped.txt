[28:53] lord in the air and so shall we ever be
[28:56] with the lord wherefore comfort one
[28:58] another with these words
[28:59] you can be seated if you'd like
[29:02] amen i have to say now before i start on
[29:07] this
[29:07] i must really enjoy the good
[29:09] old-fashioned monsoon last night
[29:11] i don't know i know the winds mess
[29:14] things up and the lightning might
[29:16] shock a little bit and the thunder might
[29:18] scare the animals or whatever but i
[29:20] really enjoy
[29:21] a good old-fashioned come up just like
[29:24] it used to
[29:25] it seems like forever since we've had
[29:27] that good monsoon come through and sweep
[29:29] across the city and give us a good
[29:30] dousing of rain and
[29:32] uh opened the door and my wife said you
[29:35] smell the desert
[29:36] if i'm not from here i don't i got up to
[29:40] the door yeah
[29:40] smelled it smell it smells so good smell
[29:43] the
[29:44] creosote and all the water hitting and
[29:46] you know and then she said the uh
[29:48] coyote urine i said no not so much but
[29:51] the desert is just has a unique smell
[29:54] about it it's just
[29:55] uh i've had people tell me uh maybe even
[29:58] david fritz i think may have told me
[30:00] oh they hate that i love that smell i
[30:03] like when that rain hits the desert
[30:05] everything is fresh and it watches all
[30:07] the
[30:08] dust and everything away and it just it
[30:09] just produces that uh
[30:12] that aroma just like any place else i've
[30:14] ever been
[30:15] yeah amen but i really enjoyed that
[30:17] flying thank god for that
[30:18] rain hopefully we won't be the end of it
[30:20] through this monsoon season so
[30:22] amen this um we get back to this
[30:25] invisible union now last week we talked
[30:27] about the invisible union and
[30:29] kind of ended up at the part of
[30:31] understanding where we began with and
[30:33] that was the fact that we that we want
[30:35] to make sure and
[30:36] and before we leave this subject that we
[30:38] understand that this
[30:39] rapturing bride is a word bride that she
[30:43] is a
[30:43] word bride that came from god and going
[30:47] back to god
[30:48] amen we just weren't born arbitrarily
[30:50] friend we weren't just
[30:51] put on this earth for absolutely no
[30:53] reason we didn't just come about because
[30:56] uh a man and a woman knew how to
[30:58] procreate the act of procreation
[31:00] we came about because we were
[31:02] predestined to come about
[31:04] we came about because we were from in
[31:07] god from the beginning
[31:08] and we are come down in this earth to
[31:10] produce the life of jesus christ afresh
[31:13] again
[31:13] in our flesh and we're going right back
[31:16] to god
[31:17] if you come from god what is god what
[31:19] the bible says first john 1 1 that he
[31:22] is the word well if god is the word and
[31:24] we came from him what makes that what
[31:26] what makes that uh us to be
[31:29] we are that word if we came from him
[31:32] we're just a part of him
[31:33] if we came from him we're just as much a
[31:35] part of that word
[31:36] as he is because he is the word so if we
[31:39] come from him
[31:41] it's just god coming back to get what is
[31:44] his
[31:45] amen he's just claiming what is his he's
[31:48] just coming and redeeming
[31:49] what is his what he saw what he foreknew
[31:52] before the foundation of the world
[31:54] in his mind as an attribute of god was
[31:56] just a part of
[31:58] of him as who we are and he's just
[32:00] coming to redeem that part of him who we
[32:02] are
[32:03] revamped said he come to redeem those
[32:04] that were what
[32:06] redeemable right well the redeemable are
[32:08] those who
[32:09] are a part of god to begin with just
[32:12] like god gave us in the nice natural as
[32:14] we saw the beautiful rain and
[32:16] see the dew in the morning just as god
[32:18] sends the rain down on the earth
[32:19] and he calls it back up by the beautiful
[32:21] sunlight
[32:22] amen god rains upon the earth and he
[32:25] calls it back
[32:26] up by his beautiful sunlight god put us
[32:28] here on earth and one day the s-o-n
[32:31] is going to draw us right back up to him
[32:32] again amen
[32:34] it's just god testifying at the
[32:36] resurrection god testifying of his
[32:39] grand plan from the beginning that we
[32:41] were from him and we're going back to
[32:43] him
[32:44] one day as that little dew drop begins
[32:46] to shimmer and begins to shake and
[32:48] begins to get ready to
[32:50] to be pulled back up into the heavens by
[32:52] that s-u-n
[32:53] so the bride is doing the same thing
[32:55] because she's recognizing who she is
[32:58] and when she knows who she is and each
[33:00] individual
[33:01] you as an individual recognizing who you
[33:04] are
[33:04] in christ when you recognize who you are
[33:07] the bride comes together as a body
[33:09] recognizing who she is
[33:11] there comes a a sound from heaven like
[33:14] the mighty rushing wind from
[33:16] that was like in the upper room on the
[33:17] day of pentecost that begins to shake
[33:20] and shudder and you begin to realize
[33:21] there's some beyond this moral reach
[33:23] that the s-o-n is calling us back
[33:26] he calling us back to where we came from
[33:29] amen
[33:30] there's that little quiet time in the
[33:31] morning sometimes you just got to get
[33:33] quiet amen
[33:35] that little quiet time in the morning
[33:36] that it is when that dew drop goes back
[33:38] to the heavens
[33:40] it's going to be that way some morning
[33:41] saints god's calling this bride is going
[33:44] to call us back home
[33:45] because we came from him we're going
[33:47] back to him amen
[33:49] there's a couple of things i want to
[33:51] pick up from last week
[33:53] that we read in the rapture message he
[33:56] says
[33:56] now hey you get to this body we read
[33:58] this scripture last week first
[33:59] corinthians 12
[34:01] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[34:03] this one body
[34:05] by one holy spirit baptism a baptism
[34:09] is an immersion that immersion comes in
[34:12] and
[34:12] god puts his life in you that makes us
[34:15] one in him that's the unifying factor
[34:18] amen is that holy spirit that's that
[34:20] this bride is an international bride
[34:22] correct
[34:23] it's an international bride this this uh
[34:26] truth is an international truth christ
[34:28] went around the world
[34:30] not physically but his word around the
[34:33] world
[34:34] so that word is joined together by the
[34:37] holy spirit
[34:38] the the the anointing that comes upon
[34:41] that
[34:41] is the one uh solidifying factor that
[34:44] this bride has
[34:46] around the world the holy spirit you
[34:48] must be born again jesus said correct
[34:51] you must be born again well if you must
[34:53] be born again
[34:54] you must be born again by the holy
[34:57] spirit that god sent
[34:58] back upon the believer well that
[35:00] unifying factor
[35:02] that holy ghost is the one thing that
[35:04] brings us
[35:05] in as a part of that body we've become a
[35:07] part of that body
[35:08] and what is that body that body is the
[35:10] word we become a part of that body by
[35:13] by a holy baptism of of the holy ghost
[35:16] and fire of god that comes
[35:18] and burns all the old nature out and
[35:20] puts his own life in there
[35:22] that makes you a part of his that's god
[35:25] claiming his property
[35:27] people get baptized and some
[35:29] denominations even claim that they're
[35:31] saved when they're baptized when you're
[35:32] not saved when you're baptized
[35:34] that's a part of it that's an ordinance
[35:36] that god the scripture leaves us
[35:38] that we know we're supposed to do as an
[35:40] outward sign
[35:41] that we've accepted jesus as our savior
[35:44] and we want to be
[35:45] buried in a cold dark grave and arisen
[35:47] and new and afresh again
[35:49] but it's when god comes in with the
[35:51] fiery holy ghost that comes and
[35:53] burns out your old nature and then shows
[35:56] to the rest of the world he's accepted
[35:57] you
[35:58] right amen now you've got a new birth
[36:01] amen now that's the new birth that's
[36:04] when all the old things are passed away
[36:06] and everything has become new that's a
[36:09] new birth
[36:10] by one spirit we're baptized that puts
[36:13] us
[36:13] as the word if that is uh
[36:16] uh he said put it down first corinthians
[36:18] 12 is that
[36:20] life is the spirit is the life of jesus
[36:23] christ
[36:24] the life of christ and the life of
[36:26] christ any seed he said
[36:29] which was the word seed brings the seed
[36:32] of life
[36:34] you get it he says now if that life is
[36:37] laying
[36:37] in the seed and this baptism of the holy
[36:40] spirit
[36:41] if the holy ghost comes upon it it is
[36:44] going to bring
[36:45] that seed to life right it is going to
[36:49] bring that
[36:50] word seed to life and if you go back to
[36:53] first john 3
[36:54] 9 not gonna read it but if you want to
[36:56] write it down or go back and read it
[36:57] again as we have expounded on
[36:59] here before but first john 9 uh
[37:02] first john 3 and 9 you'll see that that
[37:05] seed of god that he placed in a believer
[37:08] placed in a predestinated which we get
[37:11] from predestinated
[37:13] seed if you got that predestinated seed
[37:17] it remains in you
[37:20] amen john 3 9 that seed remaineth in you
[37:24] what is that seed that's a seed it came
[37:26] from god what is god god's word
[37:29] if that seed come from god and it comes
[37:32] alive in you what's it going to produce
[37:36] god an apple seed is not going to
[37:39] produce oranges
[37:40] a squash seed's not going to produce
[37:42] grapefruits
[37:44] a grapefruit seed's going to produce
[37:46] grapefruits
[37:47] a lemon seed is going to produce lemons
[37:49] a tomato seed's going to produce
[37:51] tomatoes
[37:52] a seed of god is going to produce
[37:55] god amen that's right
[37:58] i know sometimes it's hard for us to
[38:00] recognize and realize that
[38:02] but that's part of coming to who we know
[38:04] who we are
[38:06] because that seed was placed in you when
[38:08] that seed was in there that god put in
[38:10] there before the foundation of the world
[38:13] when god placed that seed in there he
[38:15] come to recognize that seed and the holy
[38:18] spirit can
[38:19] brood over an entire congregation until
[38:21] it finds a seed
[38:23] no matter whether it's in a baptist
[38:25] methodist catholic wherever it is
[38:27] that holy spirit will root over until it
[38:29] finds that seed and it'll go in and
[38:31] it'll quick in that secret
[38:33] amen when that seed comes to life it'll
[38:35] produce the life that's in the seed
[38:37] amen that life is god amen
[38:41] just kind of replicating what we
[38:42] finished with last week
[38:44] that seed is god it's a seed of god
[38:47] the seed comes to life and produces god
[38:50] where is it producing god
[38:52] in new in me in his body of believers
[38:57] amen that's why we're to live act walk
[39:00] talk act uh speak and everything about
[39:03] should be according to the word of god
[39:06] should be according to the
[39:07] to the good pleasure of his will not
[39:09] ours
[39:11] because we've been we've been born again
[39:13] we're different
[39:14] we don't paul said the things i used to
[39:16] love i now hate right
[39:18] the things i used to hate i now love
[39:20] yeah why
[39:21] because he was changed he was a new
[39:24] creature
[39:24] the holy spirit had come into him and
[39:26] changed him and now he begins to live
[39:29] not the life of
[39:30] under caephas but he or gomez he began
[39:33] to live the life under
[39:34] under god in the leadership of the holy
[39:36] spirit
[39:38] he began to do the things of god because
[39:40] the seed of god came alive
[39:42] in his heart you do the things of god
[39:45] because the seed of god has come alive
[39:47] in your heart
[39:49] sometimes the problem is that we get
[39:51] deceived by that man that's in the
[39:52] mirror
[39:53] we need to quit looking sometimes so
[39:55] hard the man in the mirror
[39:56] and recognize what the word says that
[39:58] you are exactly
[40:00] look in the mirror of the word not in
[40:02] the natural mirror
[40:03] i look in that mirror right there and i
[40:05] find all kinds of faults not just in me
[40:07] but in you too
[40:09] you find them in yourself nobody knows
[40:12] your faults better than you do
[40:15] and nobody knows you better than god
[40:17] does
[40:19] and he's forgiving you then why do you
[40:21] hold it against yourself
[40:22] that's right if god's forgive you don't
[40:25] hold it against yourself
[40:27] don't look in that near look in the
[40:28] mirror of god's word and what does god's
[40:30] word say you are
[40:32] a couple weeks ago we talked about
[40:34] abraham
[40:35] you go back and look at the account of
[40:36] abraham's life in genesis
[40:38] you see that abraham absolutely
[40:42] seemed to deny faith denied the promise
[40:46] uh got another woman pregnant and all
[40:48] the things that he did
[40:50] but if you go over and look how god saw
[40:53] abraham god's account of abraham and
[40:57] romans in hebrews
[40:59] was he was a faithful servant who never
[41:01] wavered
[41:02] that's right could you imagine
[41:06] if if if abraham looked at that
[41:09] and said well that's not right
[41:13] that's not how i did that's not how i
[41:15] lived
[41:17] if abraham looked in the mirror what do
[41:18] you think he would see
[41:20] oh i shouldn't have done this i
[41:21] shouldn't have said that i shouldn't
[41:23] have doubted here i shouldn't have
[41:25] right life is full of shitness amen
[41:28] but we need to get rid of the shitness
[41:30] and go to the i am
[41:31] amen because he is the great i am
[41:35] and forget about all those things
[41:37] because i'm sure if abraham would look
[41:39] at the account in romans and say
[41:40] oh wait that's not what i did i
[41:43] absolutely wavered
[41:44] and see in abraham's mind and in his
[41:47] experience he recognized and realized
[41:49] yes
[41:49] he did waiver but does that matter no
[41:54] because his account was before god amen
[41:57] my account his friends i'm sorry but my
[42:00] account is not before you
[42:03] my account is not even before myself my
[42:06] account is on the rolls of heaven
[42:09] before god almighty that's where my
[42:11] account is
[42:13] and as god sees it is what the truth of
[42:16] it is
[42:17] people say well that's the truth you
[42:18] know i used to tell you the story that
[42:20] when i'd go to work and
[42:21] have a little sniffle or something and
[42:23] people come in my office and say
[42:25] oh you get nicole i said no
[42:28] and sneezing or coughing and have a
[42:30] little congestion
[42:31] oh you you get the cold nope not right
[42:35] i have people come christian people
[42:37] professed
[42:38] christian people oh not you you know
[42:40] you're just lying
[42:41] and they have a grin on their face you
[42:43] know you're just lying you know that
[42:44] you're sick i said no i'm not
[42:46] i said they said that's that's just a
[42:49] lie i said no you want to know what the
[42:50] lie
[42:50] is the lie is the lying vanities of this
[42:54] mess that satan's trying to put on me
[42:56] that's the lie
[42:57] right the truth is that by his stripes i
[43:00] am healed
[43:01] that's the truth amen the truth isn't
[43:03] the sniffles
[43:04] the truth is the word right amen amen
[43:08] how does god see it that's what matters
[43:10] yeah amen
[43:11] what matters is how god sees it that's
[43:14] god's account
[43:15] god's account to you is that you are a
[43:18] word seed bride
[43:20] predestinated in his mind from before
[43:22] the foundation of the world friend
[43:24] and this world's history is about to
[43:26] wind down
[43:27] and this bride is getting ready to go
[43:29] home yes amen
[43:31] amen it's for a word bride
[43:34] that seed that remaineth in him
[43:39] when a germ comes into the womb of a
[43:42] female
[43:43] we talked about this last week again i'm
[43:45] going to finish this up and then we'll
[43:46] start where we left off you didn't come
[43:49] into as a a human germ from your father
[43:52] and then the next thing
[43:54] a dog a cat and a chicken you become a
[43:58] human germ from a human germ just like
[44:01] again like we said last week a baby is
[44:03] born a baby is conceived
[44:05] is conceived as a germ that seed brings
[44:08] life
[44:09] when it brings life it doesn't bring the
[44:12] the seed of a male
[44:13] human doesn't bring forth the life of a
[44:15] chicken
[44:17] it doesn't bring forth the life of a
[44:19] human and then on the next cell it's a
[44:21] chicken
[44:22] or the next cell it's a dog no when it
[44:25] brings forth life when that seed comes
[44:27] forth
[44:28] it comes forth as a as a human being
[44:31] the next seed or the next cell that
[44:34] builds on that
[44:35] is another human cell not a dog cell
[44:39] not a chicken cell but a human cell
[44:42] and the next cell that builds on that
[44:44] cell is another
[44:46] human cell not not a dog cell
[44:50] not an alligator cell it's a human cell
[44:53] and as each cell begins to build on
[44:55] itself you see the human begin to form
[44:57] in the
[44:58] form of the womb of the woman nowadays
[45:02] with the technology they can take
[45:03] pictures
[45:04] of the baby you can see its mouth its
[45:06] nose its eyes
[45:08] umbilical cord feet everything it's
[45:10] incredible what they could do today
[45:11] beautiful pictures i've loved it my
[45:13] children they were just kind of
[45:15] ultrasound was the thing that then is
[45:17] just it's just amazing to see them there
[45:19] you know and say there's life but it's a
[45:22] cell in the cell
[45:22] that's what forms the human well the
[45:25] same thing is in the spiritual friend
[45:26] the natural always types the spiritual
[45:29] and the and in the spiritual we know
[45:31] it's the same thing when you're birthed
[45:32] forth of this seed first john 9
[45:35] 3 9 your birth forth of this seed it
[45:37] doesn't burn
[45:38] forth as a word seed and then all of a
[45:40] sudden you've got a
[45:41] a catholic seed attached to it or or
[45:45] or a baptist cell that adds to it next
[45:48] or
[45:48] or some kind of other uh cell on top of
[45:51] that
[45:52] no it's word cell on word
[45:55] cell on word cell word on top of word on
[45:59] top of word on top of word
[46:02] and that's how you are born again that's
[46:04] how you continue to grow
[46:06] that's how you continue to live is that
[46:09] cell of the word
[46:10] is building on itself in your life and
[46:13] you're becoming the spiritual person by
[46:15] the word of god
[46:16] through the holy spirit life bringing on
[46:18] that seed
[46:21] the seed doesn't just come forth and all
[46:23] of a sudden there it is no
[46:25] there's a cell that builds on it what is
[46:27] that that's word
[46:29] there's another that brings forth the
[46:31] word body
[46:32] what is the body of jesus christ the
[46:35] mystical body of jesus christ
[46:37] it's a word body so if it's a word body
[46:41] it's not just a seed that comes forth
[46:42] and there it is no there's got to be
[46:44] another cell that comes on top of that
[46:46] well what's that cell
[46:48] well if it's a word body what's he going
[46:50] to what's the cell going to be
[46:51] it's got to be the word amen not
[46:54] denomination
[46:55] not hybridism not some man's opinion not
[46:58] some somebody learned from a seminary no
[47:00] it's got to be a word cell and that word
[47:02] is going to witness to the word itself
[47:05] the life of the word is going to witness
[47:06] to the written word itself
[47:09] amen remember what we talked about the
[47:10] other day with the written word that's
[47:12] here
[47:13] amen that's just a small part of jesus
[47:16] that's just
[47:16] in a written form there's a life
[47:20] there's a life friend and that seed that
[47:23] comes that cell that comes on that seed
[47:25] is producing the life that comes and the
[47:28] word witness to the word
[47:30] because it's a word body this is this
[47:33] word was just derived from him
[47:35] this word did not create jesus this word
[47:39] derives
[47:40] from him amen you understand this word
[47:43] did not create
[47:44] god this word exists because god
[47:48] already existed and this word derived
[47:50] from him
[47:51] right and what does it do it builds one
[47:54] on the other
[47:55] word on word sell on self amen and the
[47:58] bride
[47:59] the bride will have to be the same way
[48:02] this word bride will have to be the same
[48:04] way she will have to be
[48:06] that seed this form again first john 3 9
[48:09] will have to be cell on cell have to be
[48:11] word and word on word on the word
[48:14] it's got to be a word so now wait a
[48:17] minute i think
[48:18] this cell i'll interject my opinion in
[48:20] there
[48:21] oh boy now you're going to be you know
[48:22] you're going to be hybrid and you're
[48:24] going to have
[48:25] you're going to have 18 toes on one foot
[48:27] now you're going to have 12 fingers on
[48:29] one hand
[48:30] you're going to have a growth coming out
[48:32] of the side of your head you better get
[48:33] rid of that opinion
[48:34] and just take the word amen the pure
[48:37] word will get rid of the impurities
[48:39] that's right the pure word will get rid
[48:41] of all the deformities
[48:42] all the hybridism the pure word will get
[48:44] rid of the 18 toes will be just the
[48:46] exactly where it's supposed to be
[48:48] amen because everything works because
[48:51] it's got to be word of word or word not
[48:52] your opinion
[48:53] amen not the opinion of some man or some
[48:56] denomination but
[48:57] god's word it's got to be built word or
[48:59] word or word when it does
[49:00] then there's a body that comes forth
[49:03] that body that god has created here
[49:05] through his word on this earth
[49:07] god has come and brought an invisible
[49:09] union to happen
[49:10] that's right amen again like i said last
[49:13] week
[49:14] just the just the simple title of that
[49:16] message
[49:17] exactly tells you what it means
[49:19] invisible
[49:20] union there's an invisible union that
[49:23] takes place
[49:24] well what is this it's a union that you
[49:27] can't
[49:27] tangibly see me and my wife got married
[49:31] we got married down here campbell and
[49:33] uh and fort lowell and
[49:36] when we came together there was a
[49:37] tangible marriage there's a man there
[49:39] was a woman there was a minister there
[49:40] was a word there was
[49:41] a ceremony there was an introduction of
[49:44] industrial douche
[49:45] and mr ms bennett now we walked out and
[49:48] we were husband and wife
[49:49] he was my bride amen we went and had a
[49:52] reception
[49:53] praise the lord we had a reception see
[49:56] that was tangible well it's an invisible
[49:59] union
[50:00] an invisible union is something that
[50:01] takes place that you don't see
[50:04] it's not tangible but you know it's
[50:07] there
[50:08] you say well it's it's you know what's
[50:11] there
[50:11] how do you know it's cereal how do you
[50:12] know faith is there right
[50:15] how do you know you love somebody can
[50:17] you prove it
[50:18] i mean just because you give a hug or
[50:20] kiss doesn't mean you love somebody
[50:22] amen can you go buy me some love so you
[50:25] understand
[50:26] see it's an invisible thing that is
[50:28] taking place
[50:29] an invisible union that is happening
[50:32] today
[50:33] and that invisible union is uniting that
[50:36] word
[50:37] bride body back to the word itself again
[50:40] that union that that the two
[50:44] have become one amen the two have become
[50:47] one
[50:48] look at matthew chapter 19.
[50:57] matthew chapter 19
[51:01] uh verse three we'll just read a couple
[51:03] of verses here in matthew 19.
[51:09] remember the subject again today it's
[51:11] invisible union
[51:14] verse 3 matthew 9 3
[51:18] or 19 3 excuse me
[51:23] yes matthew chapter 19
[51:27] verse 3
[51:32] the pharisees also came unto him
[51:35] tempting him and
[51:36] saying unto him is it lawful for a man
[51:39] to put away his wife for every cause
[51:42] and he answered and said unto them have
[51:45] ye not read that he which
[51:47] made them at the beginning made them
[51:49] male and female
[51:51] we talked about that adam the feminist
[51:53] masculine
[51:54] took from adam eve took out of adam's
[51:58] the feminist spirit out of adam not just
[52:00] the physical part we always talk about
[52:02] the rib of adam and taking the rib and
[52:05] making a woman but we forget a lot of
[52:07] times that
[52:08] that the feminist spirit out of adam and
[52:10] put in the woman
[52:11] see so it's the spirit and the flesh
[52:14] just like he did the bride amen just
[52:17] like he did the bride
[52:19] made them male and female and said for
[52:21] this cause shall a man leave father and
[52:24] mother
[52:24] and shall cleave to his wife and they
[52:26] twain shall be one flesh
[52:29] wherefore there are no more twain but
[52:32] one flesh
[52:33] what therefore god hath joined together
[52:36] let no man put asunder now that's a big
[52:38] statement there because the
[52:42] again the natural typing the spiritual
[52:44] what god
[52:46] has put together let no man put us under
[52:49] now it's not talking about uh anything
[52:52] outside of god let's just put it that
[52:54] way
[52:54] it's saying what god has joined together
[52:57] let no man put asunder
[52:59] and when god joined this union together
[53:03] this invisible union it is it is a union
[53:07] and a and a fellowship of union between
[53:10] a a male and a female that cannot
[53:14] be broken satan tries all the time
[53:18] to defeat this this bride today
[53:21] away from the word and away from the
[53:24] truth and away from this
[53:26] union but what god has joined together
[53:29] no man can put asunder no man can tear
[53:32] it apart
[53:32] no man can separate in the eyes of god
[53:36] it is still
[53:37] together it is still a union amen
[53:40] the twain have become one to two have
[53:44] become one
[53:45] now you see when he talks about christ
[53:47] and the bride as being one
[53:49] we read that that quote last week they
[53:52] should be they ought to be they will be
[53:54] they
[53:55] are one amen they have to be one
[53:58] christ and the bride be one together
[54:01] remember we talked about that changing
[54:03] of relationship
[54:04] last week there's got to be through the
[54:07] annals of time and through the
[54:09] through the uh uh church ages there
[54:12] there was relationship of
[54:14] of christ to his bride down through that
[54:16] down to those ages
[54:18] and there's pride to each one of those
[54:19] ages and there's those in each one of
[54:21] those ages that live to their message
[54:23] and will be
[54:24] there in the first resurrection i
[54:27] believe we'll maybe begin to see them
[54:28] pretty soon
[54:29] we'll see how the time frame on that
[54:31] goes we don't none of us know but
[54:34] it sure feels like it won't be too much
[54:35] longer but
[54:37] we'll see that they'll they'll resurrect
[54:39] first
[54:40] but they live to their message and if
[54:42] they limp to their message
[54:44] they will be there as pride well that
[54:46] relationship down through there has come
[54:48] up to this point in time now that we're
[54:50] we're at this place we're at this
[54:52] juncture of time
[54:54] where the relationship has changed uh
[54:57] luke 17 30 all the mystery
[55:00] the the the mystery being unveiled
[55:03] through the
[55:03] ministry of the son of man the son of
[55:06] man ministry that come to
[55:08] to unveil christ to
[55:11] to make it known to his people
[55:15] so that there are no more secrets
[55:18] there is no more uh uh
[55:21] misunderstanding or or or things that
[55:24] are unknown
[55:25] god begins to have relationship with her
[55:29] with his bride but before god can have
[55:33] that kind of
[55:34] relationship there's got to be a union
[55:37] amen to be legal lawful and right in the
[55:41] eyes of god
[55:43] before that union can take place
[55:47] before that act can take place there's
[55:49] got to be a union
[55:51] there's got to be an invisible union
[55:53] take place
[55:54] before god will have that type of
[55:56] relationship
[55:58] now remember god had that relationship
[56:00] one time
[56:01] with his uh with the old uh jewish bride
[56:04] and they committed spiritual fornication
[56:06] against him
[56:07] and he put them away he put the
[56:11] jewish bride away to get a gentile bride
[56:14] and that's why god allowed them to be
[56:16] blinded so that the gentiles could come
[56:18] in
[56:19] now the gentiles in now god's getting a
[56:21] gentile bride from the day of pentecost
[56:23] to this day god's
[56:25] getting together himself a gentile bride
[56:28] a bride that will be without spot
[56:30] wrinkle or blemish
[56:32] he has already by his own blood
[56:34] completely annihilated
[56:36] every sin that can ever be held
[56:38] accountable to his children
[56:40] annihilated never even in the minds of
[56:44] god
[56:45] justified as if though you've never done
[56:47] it in the first place
[56:49] that very record is taken and thrown in
[56:52] the sea of god's forgetfulness
[56:54] never to be remembered one place he says
[56:56] on the head of satan
[56:58] it'll lay on the head of satan until the
[56:59] day of judgment and everything that you
[57:02] did in the flesh
[57:03] he'll be accountable for right amen
[57:06] because he did it it's his fault from
[57:08] the very beginning
[57:10] he even talked about eve and how she was
[57:13] tricked into doing what she did
[57:15] right it brought all the uh things that
[57:18] it did upon this her today
[57:20] but she was tricked into doing it
[57:23] amen that's god's justification
[57:27] you did you listen to that invisible
[57:28] union i thought you don't have to raise
[57:30] your hand
[57:30] i don't want it to be any judgment going
[57:32] on in here
[57:33] but in your own mind your thought you
[57:35] listen to that invisible unit i will
[57:37] tell you
[57:37] when brother dennis texted me said he
[57:39] wasn't able to come today he didn't say
[57:41] he'd listen to it but anyway
[57:43] that message invisible union when he
[57:45] goes into that invisible union
[57:49] and pardon me i i i'm trying to finish
[57:51] this today so
[57:52] uh i'm trying not to go too slow but be
[57:54] as fast but be as clear as possible but
[57:57] that in that invisible union
[58:01] he talks about um
[58:05] the fact that we were born seen shaped
[58:07] iniquity come the world speaking lies
[58:09] our first
[58:10] union was with the devil right that was
[58:12] our first union
[58:13] because our very nature taught us
[58:16] ephesians 2
[58:17] to be children of wrath we were taught
[58:20] we weren't taught we were just born with
[58:21] that nature
[58:23] nobody teaches a baby to lie they're
[58:25] just born that way
[58:26] right amen life cheat steal
[58:30] live in the world corrals whatever all
[58:32] gamble
[58:33] all the world things of the pleasures
[58:35] that they have in the world today
[58:36] you're born that way right you're born
[58:38] with that nature
[58:39] you're born to do those things we were
[58:42] the
[58:43] wife of satan we were
[58:46] in a union with the devil but it wasn't
[58:49] a right kind of union
[58:51] and his whole point in there is you have
[58:53] got to die to that man
[58:56] you've got to die to that old nature
[58:58] you've got to
[58:59] die to that first union before you could
[59:01] ever be resurrected again born again
[59:04] with the fresh union with jesus christ
[59:07] the word amen
[59:08] if you try to marry yourself up with
[59:10] christ the word
[59:11] while you're still living out in this
[59:13] world you are an adulteress
[59:16] and the bible says there's not an
[59:18] adultery enters into the
[59:19] kingdom of heaven amen
[59:23] if you try to union the two together
[59:25] you'll be an adulterer
[59:28] and there's no adulterer goes into
[59:29] heaven that old man's got to die he's
[59:32] got to be divorced he's got to be
[59:34] out of the memories even of the uh of
[59:36] your life
[59:38] of ever having that union that you had
[59:40] before to marry
[59:41] jesus christ the word amen how many
[59:44] people they try to
[59:45] they try to claim to be christians and
[59:47] they keep going over in the world and
[59:48] dabbling in the world living in the
[59:50] world and
[59:50] wearing all these nasty clothes and
[59:52] looking all these horrible ways and
[59:54] going all these ungodly places
[59:56] living all these horrible ungodly ways
[59:58] friend and trying to claim there to be
[1:00:00] christians
[1:00:02] saying that they're living for jesus
[1:00:04] christ they are the bride that's going
[1:00:06] in a rapture
[1:00:09] they're an adulterer and god will not
[1:00:11] have that right
[1:00:13] amen now thank god
[1:00:17] there was a time we all there amen it
[1:00:19] was a time we were all there but god
[1:00:21] came when he shot his light upon our
[1:00:23] path and that holy spirit brewed over
[1:00:25] found that seed and that light caught
[1:00:28] that seed and that seed came to life you
[1:00:30] said you know
[1:00:31] you might have been in a bar you might
[1:00:32] have been in a stranger's bed you might
[1:00:35] have been in a gambling hall you might
[1:00:36] have had a fifth of liquor in your hand
[1:00:38] but when that light struck you said oh
[1:00:40] praise god i'm more than this
[1:00:42] right amen i am more important than this
[1:00:45] i'm a greater person than this yes god
[1:00:48] has made me more than this drug god has
[1:00:50] made me more than this alcohol
[1:00:52] god has made me more than this righteous
[1:00:54] living i'm a dishonored daughter of god
[1:00:56] and i've been called
[1:00:57] to be a a a son or daughter of god to
[1:01:01] live the life that god has called me to
[1:01:03] live
[1:01:03] right i'm greater than this i'm more
[1:01:05] than this
[1:01:06] and that light struck something changed
[1:01:09] oh friend if there you know
[1:01:11] if there ain't a whole cell ungodliness
[1:01:14] going on in this world today
[1:01:15] i don't know what is right even the very
[1:01:18] instrument of satan calling out
[1:01:22] anti-word you ever wonder why there's so
[1:01:25] much of this
[1:01:26] piercing and tattooing and stuff going
[1:01:28] on
[1:01:30] it's because our bodies were made to be
[1:01:32] the temple of the holy ghost
[1:01:35] our bodies are to be the temple of the
[1:01:37] holy ghost god doesn't want you to scar
[1:01:39] it and
[1:01:39] and and and deform it
[1:01:42] right now thank god there's some here
[1:01:45] that's that's done that but see
[1:01:47] when that light struck you amen it
[1:01:50] chased you amen that nasty thing might
[1:01:52] still be on your arm or something
[1:01:54] but you're a different person inside and
[1:01:56] god knows right
[1:01:57] but you see i hear the world though i
[1:02:00] mean
[1:02:01] pierced around their faces and
[1:02:03] everywhere and uh
[1:02:04] tattoos necks and arms and hands and
[1:02:06] everything it's just unbelievable
[1:02:09] i i one time in you know
[1:02:12] we live in a fair fairly liberal liberal
[1:02:15] city
[1:02:16] but in the back country in north
[1:02:18] carolina where our church used to be we
[1:02:21] lived in
[1:02:22] in uh outside of charlotte we went to a
[1:02:25] church in a little town called stanley
[1:02:27] and and i got a
[1:02:29] friend it was one day and i don't mean
[1:02:31] to be judgmental on this person
[1:02:33] i just want you to understand that's the
[1:02:34] spirit's in the world today right
[1:02:36] it wants to take the body that god gave
[1:02:39] you which is supposed to be the temple
[1:02:40] of the holy ghost
[1:02:42] and destroy that temple but this person
[1:02:46] he was a man walking down the street as
[1:02:49] we were coming out from church
[1:02:51] and he had pardon me i don't know how to
[1:02:54] say this but
[1:02:55] he was pierced on both sides
[1:02:58] he had piercings in both sides
[1:03:02] and a chain between the two connecting
[1:03:05] the two together
[1:03:06] right i thought my that just ain't
[1:03:07] something that just crawled out of the
[1:03:08] pits of hell i don't know what it is
[1:03:11] that's just a physical manifestation of
[1:03:13] the spiritual that's going on
[1:03:14] right i mean because you understand the
[1:03:15] spiritual is much greater that's just a
[1:03:17] fear of spiri a physical manifestation
[1:03:19] what do you think this out here is the
[1:03:20] same thing
[1:03:21] right desecrate what the bible says
[1:03:25] is the temple of god that's exactly
[1:03:28] what's going on
[1:03:29] that's what but his wife's not going to
[1:03:30] be that way right amen amen
[1:03:32] she's going to take the word because the
[1:03:34] word is her portion
[1:03:36] the word is her life and when you come
[1:03:38] to realize because we've all been there
[1:03:40] friend
[1:03:40] we've all made mistakes we all lived our
[1:03:42] lives and maybe some of the
[1:03:43] youngbourne's not so much but
[1:03:45] we've lived our lives up and we've been
[1:03:47] there but when that light struck that
[1:03:49] path you said oh there's something
[1:03:51] i'm called to be a greater person than
[1:03:53] this i'm called to more than what my
[1:03:56] life is living right now
[1:03:57] right and you recognized him you came
[1:03:59] back and when you become that
[1:04:01] there's a union that takes place a
[1:04:03] relationship change
[1:04:05] well there's a relationship changed with
[1:04:07] you individually so racism
[1:04:08] relationship change with the bride
[1:04:11] internationally
[1:04:13] that bride comes and he slips that
[1:04:15] unmerited
[1:04:16] wedding band upon your finger amen
[1:04:20] invisible union christ in the bride the
[1:04:22] word marrying the word
[1:04:24] amen the word groom wearing the word the
[1:04:27] word brine
[1:04:29] but remember that next change
[1:04:32] it goes from acquaintance to girlfriend
[1:04:34] boyfriend to fiance
[1:04:36] to to bride and groom but the next
[1:04:40] element of that relationship change is
[1:04:43] when they become husband and wife
[1:04:45] right amen husband and wife is when that
[1:04:48] wedding band is slipped off
[1:04:50] and i know brother said then and the
[1:04:52] bible says
[1:04:53] when you're promised to you're as good
[1:04:55] as married to a friend
[1:04:56] but let me let me show you in fact you
[1:04:58] know what since we're already talking
[1:05:00] about that let me just let me just read
[1:05:01] this to you
[1:05:05] amen power of transformation
[1:05:08] i believe this was in prescott now we
[1:05:10] find out that
[1:05:12] after he made this transforming into
[1:05:14] this kind of life
[1:05:15] it was all put in by the word of god the
[1:05:18] creator
[1:05:19] we find out that this all headed up the
[1:05:22] headquarters called the garden of eden
[1:05:24] it's garden to be god's creation god's
[1:05:27] transformation wound up in the garden of
[1:05:29] eden
[1:05:30] remember the power of transformation
[1:05:33] what was that transformation
[1:05:35] it was a word transformation the word
[1:05:38] transformed this
[1:05:39] world that was in dark chaos you know
[1:05:42] the bible says it was
[1:05:43] without form and void right it was dark
[1:05:46] chaos was this world when god
[1:05:47] when god created it but then when he
[1:05:49] began to brood over and it developed
[1:05:51] into this beautiful garden of eden
[1:05:54] and god put his son there and god put
[1:05:57] his
[1:05:57] uh his son's his son and his son's bride
[1:06:01] over all of it this great creation see
[1:06:05] he had a reason for it he every
[1:06:07] everything so pretty had the flowers
[1:06:10] life birds no death no sin no sorrow no
[1:06:13] sickness
[1:06:14] and then all this great thing headed up
[1:06:15] into one big headquarters which is
[1:06:17] which was the guard of eden and there he
[1:06:20] put his son
[1:06:20] adam and adam's bride wife
[1:06:23] now you might say listen this real close
[1:06:26] now we're talking about that
[1:06:27] relationship
[1:06:28] change god now you might say it was
[1:06:32] his wife potentially it was his wife but
[1:06:36] he had never really
[1:06:37] been with her as wife yet
[1:06:41] as wife yet if he had not really been
[1:06:44] with her as
[1:06:45] wife yet it's still his bride
[1:06:48] right like in the scripture we find out
[1:06:51] where is it joseph thou son of david if
[1:06:53] you're not taken to the
[1:06:54] the very thy wife for that which is
[1:06:56] conceived in her as the of the holy
[1:06:58] ghost
[1:06:58] see now it was his wife
[1:07:01] when he made the promise to marry her or
[1:07:04] to have her
[1:07:05] but yet it wasn't his wife yet because
[1:07:08] he had never
[1:07:09] known her as wife that was the big
[1:07:13] struggle up in the garden of eden
[1:07:15] because the serpent got to her
[1:07:17] and lived with her as wife before adam
[1:07:20] could
[1:07:21] amen amen he lived with her as
[1:07:24] white before adam could but when
[1:07:28] adam did he became white she became
[1:07:30] white
[1:07:31] after that point is when he actually
[1:07:33] named her
[1:07:34] up to that point he will look in the
[1:07:36] bible up to that point
[1:07:38] he called her a woman right after that
[1:07:40] relationship changed
[1:07:42] she called her e mother of all living
[1:07:45] not adam father of all living but eve
[1:07:48] mother of all living
[1:07:49] right because serpent knew her as wife
[1:07:51] before adam did
[1:07:53] see he was she was his wife
[1:07:56] certainly but he never knew her because
[1:07:59] he never knew her
[1:08:00] as wife yet and so that's why it was the
[1:08:04] reason i said god's son and his bride
[1:08:06] adam
[1:08:07] had never knew his wife as wife
[1:08:10] but yet it was his wife potentially just
[1:08:12] like the bride is
[1:08:14] to christ now amen in that
[1:08:18] in that position for that relationship
[1:08:22] there must be union first i do
[1:08:28] union fellowship
[1:08:31] to have that kind of a relationship
[1:08:34] to have a husband and wife relationship
[1:08:36] they must be
[1:08:37] union married together
[1:08:41] that's when you begin to know each other
[1:08:43] begin to
[1:08:46] whisper sweet nothings and enjoy your
[1:08:49] relationship together
[1:08:50] husband and wife that's the after i do
[1:08:54] as the wedding band unmerited grace
[1:08:57] slipped upon your finger by god
[1:09:01] it says i do you say i do he says i do
[1:09:05] you become one
[1:09:07] what did he say in matthew 19 and no
[1:09:09] more twain
[1:09:10] they're one right you do you no more
[1:09:13] twain
[1:09:14] you're one that's true and that's
[1:09:16] exactly that bride which we talk about
[1:09:18] is who he's coming to get to take home
[1:09:22] remember friend we're going to a wedding
[1:09:24] supper
[1:09:25] not a rare not a marriage ceremony
[1:09:27] that's right
[1:09:28] how could god have that kind of
[1:09:29] relationship unless he had already
[1:09:32] slipped that band upon your finger
[1:09:34] that's right god wouldn't do that god is
[1:09:37] a clean
[1:09:37] holy righteous god he wouldn't have that
[1:09:40] kind of relationship with a woman unless
[1:09:41] that
[1:09:42] unless that band was slipped on her
[1:09:43] finger amen
[1:09:45] wouldn't happen yeah because he's god
[1:09:49] you wouldn't want to have that kind of
[1:09:50] relationship either unless god had done
[1:09:52] that
[1:09:53] when god said i do and you say i do and
[1:09:56] the two become one
[1:09:59] the bride becomes the wife
[1:10:02] the wife of jesus christ you say now
[1:10:06] wait a minute we always use the word
[1:10:07] bribe well it's interchangeable
[1:10:10] i still consider my beautiful 36 years
[1:10:12] married wife
[1:10:13] back there who just turned to so many
[1:10:15] years old uh
[1:10:16] my bride she's still my bride
[1:10:21] amen but she's she's more than my bride
[1:10:25] she's my wife right she's my bride too
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:28] but she's my wife amen and there's
[1:10:30] nobody else that'll ever be my wife
[1:10:33] as far as i'm concerned amen that'll
[1:10:36] ever be my wife
[1:10:36] she's my wife and there's nobody else
[1:10:39] can feel that relationship
[1:10:40] understand so that relationship's unlike
[1:10:43] any other relationship
[1:10:44] that's why it's so coveted and precious
[1:10:47] to god
[1:10:47] now you look at the other thing that
[1:10:49] satan's tearing down in this world today
[1:10:51] in this country the family the fabric of
[1:10:54] the
[1:10:54] family satan is trying to destroy oh it
[1:10:57] doesn't really matter
[1:10:58] that you're married that's why
[1:11:01] more than half of marriages fail today
[1:11:04] that's why
[1:11:04] most more than half 60 percent whatever
[1:11:07] i don't know what the number is now fail
[1:11:10] marriage is
[1:11:10] fail yeah this country
[1:11:14] you look at what it's doing he's ripping
[1:11:16] that apart
[1:11:17] to the point people said well we just
[1:11:19] they call it what
[1:11:20] common law mayor common-law marriage
[1:11:24] oh really you think that's what god
[1:11:27] looks at and believes
[1:11:30] it's just it's just then another fabric
[1:11:32] of god see
[1:11:33] it completely denies and and
[1:11:36] delegitimizes
[1:11:37] everything about the word when god is
[1:11:39] trying so
[1:11:40] to get his bride together under that
[1:11:43] word
[1:11:43] to unite for that uniting time and sign
[1:11:48] because the bride and the groom have
[1:11:50] become one
[1:11:52] she's become the word because he is the
[1:11:55] word
[1:11:56] he has taken her unto his bosom and the
[1:11:59] two have become one
[1:12:01] amen abraham and isaac
[1:12:04] had a ceremony but friend they weren't
[1:12:08] unionized in a fan and and a couple
[1:12:11] husband and wife until he took her in
[1:12:13] the tent
[1:12:14] right amen the two became one
[1:12:18] that's when god begins to speak to you
[1:12:21] reveal to you himself
[1:12:22] reveal the word to you tell them friend
[1:12:25] if this bible is just a bunch of words
[1:12:27] it's just knowledge it's just some
[1:12:29] intellectual
[1:12:30] knowledge that you gain or understand
[1:12:34] but when god comes and that union takes
[1:12:37] place then
[1:12:37] then there's then there's a revelation
[1:12:40] there's a there's a
[1:12:41] secretive relationship that takes place
[1:12:43] between you and him
[1:12:44] and it's only for the bride it's only
[1:12:47] for
[1:12:48] his wife it's not for everybody else
[1:12:51] it's only for his wife you take on
[1:12:55] his name you become
[1:12:58] miss jesus that's another thing
[1:13:02] the devil's so hard to try to tear down
[1:13:04] yeah
[1:13:06] you remember when it talked about years
[1:13:09] ago
[1:13:10] when hillary clinton becomes so famous
[1:13:13] when she becomes so famous and her
[1:13:15] husband became present on this mess
[1:13:17] she was hillary clinton until her fame
[1:13:20] rose to a certain place
[1:13:21] and then she started calling herself
[1:13:23] hillary rodham
[1:13:25] clinton by her old name
[1:13:28] and she kept her husband's name but look
[1:13:30] what spirit that generated
[1:13:34] how many places how many people how many
[1:13:36] women today
[1:13:37] refuse to take the name of even
[1:13:41] men who want to take the name of the
[1:13:44] wife
[1:13:46] i i just it just shows
[1:13:50] there there's something to that friend
[1:13:52] but
[1:13:53] but the the wife absolutely refusing
[1:13:56] to take the to take the the bridegroom's
[1:13:59] name
[1:14:01] which you're just simply refusing that
[1:14:03] you even belong to him that you're even
[1:14:05] part as a union together
[1:14:09] amen but you see
[1:14:13] that very thing that satan is destroying
[1:14:15] because it's so prevalent
[1:14:16] in the word and so it is what the word
[1:14:20] teaches
[1:14:21] us that union between christ and the
[1:14:23] bride
[1:14:24] amen between christ and the bride
[1:14:28] now you know if if i had a
[1:14:31] if i had a name like ricky or rickett or
[1:14:34] something
[1:14:35] i might change it that might be a little
[1:14:37] different you understand but
[1:14:39] you know what i'm saying the whole
[1:14:40] premise of that amen is to take on his
[1:14:43] name
[1:14:44] we've taken on his name to be miss jesus
[1:14:48] see shows that union together
[1:14:52] the bride becomes the wife
[1:14:56] she's the bride is the wife now
[1:15:00] look at this god's provided place of
[1:15:04] worship the church will go through
[1:15:06] justification luke through
[1:15:07] sanctification wesley through the
[1:15:08] baptist the holy ghost pentecostals
[1:15:10] go right into the perfection of the son
[1:15:12] of man that when
[1:15:13] husband and wife will be the self-same
[1:15:17] person
[1:15:18] husband and wife would be the self-safe
[1:15:20] person now we've typed it naturally we
[1:15:22] know that's fact naturally we read it in
[1:15:24] the scripture here
[1:15:25] what about spiritual sure night natural
[1:15:28] type spiritual
[1:15:29] husband and wife will be the same god
[1:15:32] will be so
[1:15:33] manifested into his bride
[1:15:36] till they will both be the same amen
[1:15:39] amen they are one
[1:15:44] he god will be so manifested
[1:15:48] in his bride that the two will become
[1:15:51] one
[1:15:52] amen the two are one
[1:15:55] he said now if those two have become one
[1:15:58] they are one now he says do you see
[1:16:00] where we're at
[1:16:02] oh friend that's 1965. that's 55 years
[1:16:06] ago almost 56 years ago
[1:16:08] if we were there then where do you think
[1:16:10] we are now
[1:16:11] right how much further down the road are
[1:16:14] we
[1:16:15] oh in years you say well we're 55 years
[1:16:18] down 56 years down the road
[1:16:20] i'm not talking about years i'm talking
[1:16:21] about spirit right right
[1:16:24] that's what he's talking about where are
[1:16:26] we at what in the spirit
[1:16:29] he wasn't talking about 1965 he was
[1:16:32] talking about
[1:16:33] spiritually where we are spiritually my
[1:16:35] exhortation today that if he said that's
[1:16:37] 56 years ago where are we now
[1:16:40] mine the two are one
[1:16:44] two or one things that are to be now if
[1:16:46] we are those
[1:16:47] attributes of god we cannot live by
[1:16:49] creeds
[1:16:50] got to be word on word or word we cannot
[1:16:52] live by denominationalism
[1:16:54] we must live by the word because the
[1:16:57] bride is a part of the bridegroom
[1:16:59] like any wife is a part of her husband
[1:17:04] therefore we must be that word bride
[1:17:07] and what is that word bride the
[1:17:09] manifestation of the
[1:17:11] hour what is the manifestation of the
[1:17:14] hour
[1:17:15] people say oh they look for the return
[1:17:17] of jesus oh we all
[1:17:20] looking for the return of jesus but what
[1:17:22] is the return of jesus
[1:17:24] what is the return for our day our day
[1:17:27] i'm not talking about years ago i'm not
[1:17:29] talking about the future
[1:17:30] our day what is our day what does it
[1:17:33] mean when we talk about the return of
[1:17:34] jesus for our day
[1:17:36] it means that the dead in christ shall
[1:17:38] rise first
[1:17:40] those who are alive and remain will have
[1:17:42] a body change
[1:17:44] and we will all be caught up together to
[1:17:46] meet the lord
[1:17:47] in the air right that's what it means
[1:17:52] that's where we're at right if that's
[1:17:55] what it means
[1:17:56] then what does it mean for us what does
[1:17:59] it mean for us
[1:18:00] right now what is that that we're
[1:18:03] looking for
[1:18:05] see well we're looking for this we're
[1:18:07] looking for that
[1:18:08] but if we're a part of that bridegroom
[1:18:11] the word bride
[1:18:12] she must be the greatest
[1:18:15] oh the the greatest example
[1:18:20] the greatest indication we have
[1:18:23] of the coming of the lord for our day is
[1:18:26] the manifested sons and daughters of god
[1:18:31] the bride the word bride manifesting
[1:18:34] itself on this earth today
[1:18:36] is the greatest example we have of the
[1:18:38] second return of the lord jesus
[1:18:42] amen because he will not put his feet on
[1:18:45] this earth
[1:18:46] at that coming he will not but who does
[1:18:52] you looking at it i'm looking at her
[1:18:56] amen how does god put his feet on this
[1:18:59] earth today
[1:18:59] by walking in your shoe leather
[1:19:02] the manifested sons and daughters of god
[1:19:06] the manifestation of the bride for this
[1:19:08] day
[1:19:09] is the hour that we're living in
[1:19:12] praise the lord we must be that word
[1:19:15] bride what is
[1:19:16] it is that manifestation today this
[1:19:19] hour of that bride manifested sons and
[1:19:23] daughters of god
[1:19:25] not a creed not a denomination but
[1:19:27] living by every oracle of god a living
[1:19:30] a living attribute of god displaying the
[1:19:33] world
[1:19:33] the act displaying to the world the
[1:19:36] attributes of god
[1:19:37] in the formation of the bride that is to
[1:19:39] be expressed in this
[1:19:41] hour that we're now living express
[1:19:44] now we're talking about the expression
[1:19:47] of a bride
[1:19:48] for this hour amen the expression of the
[1:19:52] bride
[1:19:52] is the manifestation the manifestation
[1:19:55] is just the unveiling
[1:19:57] you understand the manifestation is
[1:20:00] simply an unveiling
[1:20:01] of what something is right and just
[1:20:04] showing what's inside there
[1:20:07] all god is doing is pulling the lid off
[1:20:09] that you can see
[1:20:10] everything else around i mean it's not
[1:20:12] that this bride has always been
[1:20:14] necessarily kid but the world around
[1:20:17] it's gotten so bad and so
[1:20:18] dark that the light that the bride is
[1:20:20] producing is brighter than ever
[1:20:24] it's manifesting greater than ever
[1:20:27] it's manifesting in this little church
[1:20:30] yes you know it
[1:20:31] we've seen it amen but i'm
[1:20:34] got to close here but there's a couple
[1:20:36] more things i really want to say
[1:20:39] brother and said in the rapture message
[1:20:40] he said now notice
[1:20:42] not only is the bride washed forgiven
[1:20:46] but she is justified we hit on that a
[1:20:48] minute ago
[1:20:49] did uh did you ever try to
[1:20:52] look up the word justified see what it
[1:20:54] means he said now for
[1:20:56] instance brother green heard that i've
[1:20:58] been drinking
[1:20:59] i've been doing bad things then found
[1:21:01] out that i didn't do it he'd come to me
[1:21:02] and says well i forgive you brother
[1:21:04] brown
[1:21:04] he said you forgive me for what i never
[1:21:07] did it
[1:21:09] what do you forgive me about see but if
[1:21:12] i'm guilty
[1:21:13] then i can be forgiven but i'm still not
[1:21:15] just
[1:21:16] because i did it but the word justified
[1:21:19] is
[1:21:19] though you've never done it at all right
[1:21:22] through it
[1:21:23] yes never did it gracefully amen
[1:21:27] justified the blood of jesus christ
[1:21:29] cleanses us from all
[1:21:30] sin till it's put in the book of god's
[1:21:33] forgiveness
[1:21:34] he's the only one that can do it we can
[1:21:37] forgive but we can't forgive
[1:21:39] i can forgive you but i'll always
[1:21:41] remember you did these certain things
[1:21:44] then you're not just you're forgiven but
[1:21:47] in the sight of god
[1:21:49] now that the record we're worried about
[1:21:51] we're concerned about that's what we
[1:21:52] care about
[1:21:53] amen in the eyes of god the bride
[1:21:56] is justified she never done it in the
[1:22:00] first place amen
[1:22:01] standing there listen listen to me
[1:22:04] standing there married to the virtuous
[1:22:08] son of god amen
[1:22:09] hallelujah married to the virtuous
[1:22:13] son of god hallelujah praise the lord
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:17] that's the bride's invisible union

[1:22:21] never sinned in the first place she was
[1:22:24] full ordained
[1:22:26] she was trapped into this and now when
[1:22:28] she heard the truth
[1:22:30] she come forth the blood cleansed her
[1:22:32] and she stands there
[1:22:33] virtuous no sin on her at all praise god
[1:22:38] praise the lord no sin at all on earth

[1:25:46] clean white for the fine linen is the
[1:25:48] righteousness of the saints
[1:25:51] clean pure he took my place so that i
[1:25:55] could take his

[1:26:14] was what he did
[1:26:16] amen you know i was just in prayer this
[1:26:20] morning it just struck me so strong
[1:26:22] i thought about you know how how
[1:26:24] sometimes people
[1:26:26] people relish in the grace of god today
[1:26:28] seems like more than ever
[1:26:30] and and i and a friend of amazing grace
[1:26:32] will always be my anthem
[1:26:34] you know that without the grace of god
[1:26:36] we're all lost and done
[1:26:38] but people take the grace of god and
[1:26:40] make a disgrace out of it so oh
[1:26:41] well if the grace of god is that
[1:26:43] prevalent then i just do anything i want
[1:26:45] you know and live any way i want to wear
[1:26:46] whatever one
[1:26:47] dress and act to do and you know and
[1:26:49] just and just
[1:26:50] be like the world and then it's going to
[1:26:52] be okay because god's going to forgive
[1:26:53] me anyway his
[1:26:54] grace will overcome that and i thought
[1:26:58] how much the grace of god and i started
[1:27:01] thanking god
[1:27:02] in my prayer i started thinking thank
[1:27:04] you god for
[1:27:05] everything you've done for me i mean i
[1:27:08] named things and
[1:27:09] right you know just talking to him and
[1:27:11] and i got to the place i thought god
[1:27:13] that
[1:27:14] that amazing grace
[1:27:17] to me when you get a revelation of the
[1:27:20] true grace of god
[1:27:22] it will cause you to want to be closer
[1:27:25] to him
[1:27:27] it'll cause you to want to be more like
[1:27:28] him it'll cause you to want to be more
[1:27:30] faithful to him
[1:27:32] it'll cause you to want to be less like
[1:27:33] the world it'll cause you to want to do
[1:27:36] anything that would ever hurt him again
[1:27:39] if you really get a revelation the grace
[1:27:41] of god
[1:27:41] yes i thought about my wife i thought
[1:27:44] about what brother
[1:27:44] talked about his work and and
[1:27:48] i i could sit here as a man and i could
[1:27:50] say oh my wife has been just a hundred
[1:27:52] percent faithful
[1:27:53] to me for 36 years she's so good and so
[1:27:56] faithful and shows so much grace
[1:27:58] i just go with any other woman now
[1:28:02] does that sound right does that sound
[1:28:05] like something
[1:28:06] does that sound like i love her does
[1:28:08] that sound like i appreciate the grace
[1:28:10] the faithfulness
[1:28:12] amen but that's how people treat god
[1:28:14] yeah
[1:28:15] they treat god like oh god you're so
[1:28:17] good to me you're so faithful to me and
[1:28:18] i love your grace so much now i'm just
[1:28:20] gonna go do whatever
[1:28:22] you don't love him that that
[1:28:26] a revelation of the grace of god will
[1:28:28] cause you to want to act and live your
[1:28:30] life to where you would never hurt him
[1:28:32] again
[1:28:33] that's the truth of what grace is amen
[1:28:37] revelation 21 i got one more
[1:28:41] verse i want to read
[1:28:45] revelation 21 9
[1:28:48] just a page over they're coming to him
[1:28:50] uh come unto me one of the seven angels
[1:28:53] had the seven vowels
[1:28:54] uh full of the seven last plagues taught
[1:28:56] with me
[1:28:57] saying come hither i will show you the
[1:29:00] uh show thee the bride the lambs what
[1:29:04] what why why it's not unprecedented to
[1:29:08] realize that there's an invisible
[1:29:10] union taking place it's not that
[1:29:13] invisible union friend i'm sorry that's
[1:29:15] already taken place
[1:29:16] now there's others that may have come in
[1:29:19] amen there's others that may come in
[1:29:21] and including myself that come to
[1:29:24] realize who i am in that body
[1:29:26] but that that union taken place as a
[1:29:28] body of believers that
[1:29:29] that union has taken place god has
[1:29:31] already had that when when john the
[1:29:33] baptist came
[1:29:35] he said behold the lamb of god that take
[1:29:38] away the sin of the world
[1:29:39] that's right in a physical form jesus
[1:29:41] was standing there a corporal body of
[1:29:43] people left with john
[1:29:44] and went and followed jesus when brother
[1:29:47] brown came with this message in the
[1:29:49] unveiling of the son of man ministry
[1:29:51] what did he do and he was saying there
[1:29:54] is the lamb of god
[1:29:57] there's a union an invisible
[1:30:00] union but a union and it's
[1:30:04] changing the relationship the bride has
[1:30:06] had all through down through the ages
[1:30:10] and slipping that wedding band on now
[1:30:14] now it's the time that this bride is
[1:30:15] coming and and i just read your quote
[1:30:17] here but i'm not
[1:30:18] because i i've got to close
[1:30:21] there's that time where
[1:30:25] this bride is being pregnant
[1:30:28] amen impregnated the choosing of a
[1:30:31] variety talks about
[1:30:33] the church is being impregnated the
[1:30:35] bride being pregnated
[1:30:36] by what one's going to bring forth the
[1:30:38] nominational child the other's going to
[1:30:40] bring forth the word
[1:30:41] child amen
[1:30:44] but how could they be pregnant if they
[1:30:46] didn't have a relationship
[1:30:49] if we weren't his wife how could we
[1:30:51] bring forth those that
[1:30:52] are like him
[1:30:56] being fruitful and multiplying isn't
[1:30:58] just
[1:30:59] for the trees out here it's for the
[1:31:02] children of god
[1:31:05] we produce the fruit of the spirit which
[1:31:07] reveals jesus christ
[1:31:09] that others might come tonight
[1:31:12] it just reproduces the same life over
[1:31:15] again
[1:31:16] because he is the word in the sixth seal
[1:31:19] brother branham said he is coming
[1:31:23] there's a lot of women churches in the
[1:31:24] world but he is coming for
[1:31:26] his wife he is coming for his wife
[1:31:31] amen i believe that this bride
[1:31:35] that union has taken place he's coming
[1:31:38] that rapture is happening
[1:31:39] he's coming for his bride amen
[1:31:44] from glory to glory he's changing me
[1:31:47] he's changing us from glory to glory
[1:31:49] more in his image
[1:31:50] more in his likeness every day word upon
[1:31:53] word
[1:31:54] sell upon self word on word amen
[1:31:57] don't interject your own opinion your
[1:31:59] own thought your own dogma
[1:32:02] amen don't worry about what they say on
[1:32:04] tvn or on some radio station
[1:32:06] it's just word on the word amen word on
[1:32:09] word
[1:32:10] that's what that's why it came today the
[1:32:11] way it came
[1:32:13] that's why god had to send the prophet
[1:32:15] in this last day to bring those things
[1:32:16] together to talk about a couple weeks
[1:32:18] ago
[1:32:19] solidify that point to understand that's
[1:32:21] why it had to be
[1:32:23] because it's got to be a word ride
[1:32:25] coming forth
[1:32:28] christ and the bride united as one
[1:32:33] can't tell the two apart amen
[1:32:36] you know brother you know people say
[1:32:38] that about brother branham and all
[1:32:40] the things that they do and whatever you
[1:32:43] know he said i'd have to apologize if
[1:32:44] those people didn't exist
[1:32:46] i'd have to apologize for my ministry
[1:32:48] because i didn't live close enough to
[1:32:49] god to produce enough of god
[1:32:50] for people to think i was god that's
[1:32:55] that makes me want to crawl in the
[1:32:56] corner and sit off the end of a sheet of
[1:32:59] notebook paper and dang on my feet
[1:33:03] amen that makes me feel so small
[1:33:07] i was telling my wife i'mma close with
[1:33:09] this i was telling my wife yesterday
[1:33:10] i saw this saying the other day and i
[1:33:13] want you here now
[1:33:14] if you think you are too small to make a
[1:33:17] difference
[1:33:18] try sleeping with a mosquito
[1:33:24] if you think you're too small to make a
[1:33:26] difference try sleeping with a mosquito
[1:33:29] i got that point very clear amen
[1:33:33] very true and it count home to me
[1:33:35] because i've tried that
[1:33:36] and it doesn't work amen let's stand if
[1:33:40] we could
[1:33:48] amen you love the lord jesus
[1:33:52] amen he's so good to us isn't he thank
[1:33:55] you lord
