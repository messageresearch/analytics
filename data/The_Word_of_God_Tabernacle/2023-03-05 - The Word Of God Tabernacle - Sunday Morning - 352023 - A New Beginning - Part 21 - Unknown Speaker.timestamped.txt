[47:50] him having his preeminence amen there's
[47:53] nothing like it praise the Lord our
[47:56] whole lives are worship everything we do
[47:58] every place we go everything we say
[48:00] every Movement we make from our heart is
[48:03] worship to the Lord It's the
[48:05] signification of the spirit of God
[48:07] living in US showing to the world that
[48:10] we worship God for living in us and
[48:12] through us and having his preeminence in
[48:15] our lives we may look strange we may act
[48:17] strange but it's only because of the
[48:20] Lord Jesus it's in our lives it's in our
[48:22] hearts we're the Oddball today Saints
[48:25] amen we're the odd ones in this world

[49:14] uh two more messages on this we're going
[49:18] to bring on the new beginning
[49:20] and this is today will be the new
[49:22] beginning part 21.

[52:29] have to send this word forth today that
[52:31] this meeting and not be in vain God that
[52:33] it will be accomplished and what you'd
[52:35] have said it forth for we rebuke every
[52:37] demonic spirit that would try to hurt
[52:39] hinder infiltrate this service in any
[52:41] way that you get the glory honor and
[52:43] praise for all that is said and done we
[52:45] thank you Father for it and we commit it
[52:47] all to you now again in the name of the
[52:49] Lord Jesus Christ we pray Amen in
[52:53] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the
[52:55] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[52:57] Earth the Earth was without form and
[52:59] void and darkness is upon the face of
[53:01] the deep the spirit of God moved upon
[53:04] the face of the waters amen you can be
[53:07] seated if you like
[53:09] amen I like it when that spirit of God I
[53:13] know the spirit of God moved upon the
[53:14] face of the waters there in the natural
[53:16] but you know water represents people in
[53:18] the Bible multitudes people amen I'm not
[53:22] sure if we in this little group here is
[53:24] constitute multitudes but we'll go with
[53:26] that anyway man is the spirit of God
[53:28] moves out upon the water out upon the
[53:31] multitudes out upon the people amen and
[53:34] flows through Us Praise the Lord let's
[53:36] go over to Revelation chapter 21 now we
[53:38] probably won't be very long today
[53:42] as I said uh it was what I had that the
[53:46] Lord put on my heart was really too much
[53:49] for one service but
[53:51] um uh so splitting it up into two kind
[53:54] of
[53:55] by the way I can gauge it could be two
[53:58] shorter messages but uh when the Lord
[54:01] has his way we don't know what'll happen
[54:03] so it's all in his hands regardless so
[54:07] yeah amen but the way I see it is the
[54:09] way it looks here we won't be too awful
[54:11] long today but just uh enter into a
[54:13] little bit more and finalizing this new
[54:15] city and getting back into the wall the
[54:18] gates the things that we talked about
[54:20] reiterating and of course uh uh uh again
[54:25] uh re-showing or uh renewing and helping
[54:29] us see that this this is for God's
[54:32] people and not just the Gentile but for
[54:35] the Jew as well God again as God
[54:37] intermingles that City he intermingles
[54:40] the wall he intermingles and of course
[54:42] remember the wall is the thing that's
[54:44] the solid that holds it together on the
[54:47] from the outside of that City I mean
[54:50] it's a wall that wall is a constant
[54:52] praise the Lord just like we kind of are
[54:54] here in this this walled place without
[54:58] these walls we would just be out in the
[55:00] open uh so it's those walls that do that
[55:03] and remember the things that Encompass
[55:05] that those that that that City those
[55:08] walls
[55:09] um is made of Jasper remember that that
[55:12] Jasper represents Jesus of course and
[55:15] like we said last week even the word the
[55:18] the the definition or the acknowledgment
[55:22] of Jasper is to mean healing or to be
[55:25] healed
[55:26] not to mention the multi-colors that the
[55:29] Jasper will put forth or that the Jasper
[55:31] comes in I probably should let Mike or
[55:34] Tom come and give you the gym lesson but
[55:37] that's just going to be a short part of
[55:39] what we want to talk about but my whole
[55:40] point is that that Jasper remember
[55:43] Revelation 4 he was looked upon the
[55:46] Jasper and started stone that Jasper is
[55:48] the beginning and the ending uh Reuben
[55:51] and Benjamin remember the Jasper and
[55:53] Sharda stone is is showing us that it's
[55:56] a reflection to the bride but it's also
[55:58] showing those gems that are the of the
[56:01] Reuben Stone and the Benjamin Stone
[56:03] which is the beginning and ending even
[56:05] of the 12 tribes of Israel but as you
[56:08] look upon that wall that's made of
[56:10] Jasper which we'll read again represents
[56:12] Jesus so even as we're talking about the
[56:14] city
[56:15] and the walls the foundations the gates
[56:18] all of it that Encompass every bit of it
[56:21] is Jesus
[56:23] amen it's all about him yes praise the
[56:26] Lord It's All About the Lord Jesus
[56:28] regardless of our thoughts opinions uh
[56:32] none of that matters it's all about him
[56:34] right so it's not about me not about you
[56:37] it's not about any church or any
[56:39] denomination or any movement uh it
[56:42] wasn't about brother Branham it's about
[56:43] Jesus amen and that and that wall there
[56:47] that constitutes that that that shows
[56:50] that reveals that now as we go to
[56:51] Revelation 21 uh I want to begin with
[56:55] the 14th verse
[56:57] um hold your place there we're going to
[56:58] go a couple of the scriptures but keep
[57:00] it there uh because we're going to end
[57:02] up coming back here as we get back into
[57:04] the foundations and the gates if you
[57:07] will now 14 of Revelation 21 verse 14.
[57:13] and the wall of the city had 12
[57:16] foundations which we talked about we
[57:18] drew out on the board we've already
[57:19] erased it off the board here uh of those
[57:22] 12 foundations because we got back into
[57:24] or got into that Europe and thumb uh
[57:27] that's in the scripture that we talked
[57:29] about last week that we'll get into a
[57:31] little more detail today uh the 12 the
[57:34] the wall of the city had 12 foundations
[57:36] and in them the names of The Twelve
[57:39] Apostles of the land remember we talked
[57:41] about or went into the scripture about
[57:43] Ephesians 2 there's other places but the
[57:45] scripture that I read Ephesians 2 the
[57:48] foundation is the apostles the prophets
[57:52] and that Chief Cornerstone being Jesus
[57:54] Christ himself
[57:56] uh so each one of those foundations is
[58:00] the names of those 12 Apostles that
[58:03] bring that foundation of the word that
[58:06] this that this bride is built upon this
[58:08] body is built upon and the parable that
[58:11] Jesus said the man that builds his house
[58:13] on the sand will go away but if he
[58:15] builds his house on that Rock Amen that
[58:18] rock that Foundation the foundation is
[58:20] the most important part of it you can
[58:23] make the most beautiful wall of building
[58:25] you can make the most
[58:27] fundamentally sound wall that you want
[58:29] to or house or you can garnish it and it
[58:31] can be the prettiest uh site that ever
[58:34] behold by human eyes but without a
[58:37] foundation that's solid the way it
[58:39] should be if that's Foundation isn't the
[58:41] way it should be no matter how beautiful
[58:43] or even how
[58:45] sounds how soundly built the wall is if
[58:49] the foundation is it it doesn't matter
[58:51] amen it'll go crumbling to the ground so
[58:53] the foundation built upon those 12
[58:57] Apostles amen and it wasn't the Twelve
[59:00] Apostles per se but that word
[59:03] the the the scripture the the word that
[59:06] came forth the foundation of what we
[59:08] believe amen which is Jesus Christ the
[59:12] Chief Cornerstone
[59:13] amen remember Jesus told even Peter when
[59:17] Jesus said uh when when uh when when
[59:21] Peter proclaimed and the different ones
[59:23] proclaimed what they believe he was and
[59:25] G and Peter spoke out and said there are
[59:27] the crisis son of the Living God Jesus
[59:29] said uh uh Thou Art Peter and Upon This
[59:32] Rock the foundation of the revelation of
[59:35] who Peter said Jesus was I'll build my
[59:38] church on that Foundation amen praise
[59:41] the Lord so now every one of those 12
[59:43] foundations that holding up this wall is
[59:46] of The Twelve the names of The Twelve uh
[59:50] apostles
[59:51] amen now let's get to the wall uh let's
[59:54] see for the wall of the city had 12
[59:56] foundations in them the names of The
[59:58] Twelve Apostles of the lamb and he that
[1:00:01] talked with me had a golden Reed to
[1:00:04] measure the city and the gates thereof
[1:00:05] and the wall thereof again and the city
[1:00:08] lieth Foursquare the length is his
[1:00:10] largest of breadth and measure of the
[1:00:12] city of the Reed we've gone over this
[1:00:13] twelve thousand furlongs to length of
[1:00:16] the breadth the height are equal you
[1:00:18] measure the wall thereof and 140 cubits
[1:00:20] 40 and four cubits according to the
[1:00:22] measure of a man that is of the Angel
[1:00:25] remember we said that measuring that out
[1:00:27] by the measurement scripturally puts us
[1:00:30] at about 216 feet of course that's
[1:00:33] obviously an approximate measure
[1:00:35] nobody's going to be there with the
[1:00:36] rulers there's a 216 foot ruler the
[1:00:40] making sure it's right to the 216 mark
[1:00:42] But approximately by the measurement of
[1:00:45] the scripture this wall 216 feet high
[1:00:48] which we said is about 18 stories there
[1:00:51] are about
[1:00:52] um a hundred uh 100 feet less than the
[1:00:55] tallest building downtown which is
[1:00:57] pretty pretty high wall
[1:00:59] and the building of the wall of it was a
[1:01:02] Jasper amen we just talked about that
[1:01:04] the city was pure gold like unclear the
[1:01:08] glass and the foundations of the wall uh
[1:01:11] of this uh the wall of the city were
[1:01:13] garnished with all manner of precious
[1:01:15] stones that's what I want to talk more
[1:01:17] about today uh as we get into the First
[1:01:21] Foundation was Jasper II Sapphire and of
[1:01:24] course I'll probably butcher some of
[1:01:25] these again the third a
[1:01:28] calcedona uh calcidoni uh the fourth in
[1:01:32] Emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth
[1:01:35] Sardis seventh crystallite the eighth
[1:01:37] Barrel the ninth topaz tenth uh
[1:01:40] something else the 11th
[1:01:43] um the uh Hassan the 12th amethyst the
[1:01:47] 12 gates for the 12 pearls every uh
[1:01:50] segregate one of one Pearl uh Street
[1:01:54] City we'll talk about that a little bit
[1:01:55] later let's go back now to the
[1:01:57] garnishing these these stones let's look
[1:02:00] at these stones again for a few minutes
[1:02:01] and look at what the garnishing remember
[1:02:03] what it says now these foundations of
[1:02:07] these walls have the names of The Twelve
[1:02:09] Apostles written in them so they're the
[1:02:11] representation of the foundation the
[1:02:14] Apostle said that this church is built
[1:02:16] upon amen so
[1:02:18] what we're what we've been talking about
[1:02:21] what's going to mostly be today and next
[1:02:24] service is going to be a lot of typology
[1:02:26] and a lot of uh recognizing what the
[1:02:29] scripture says and drawing those
[1:02:31] conclusions up from what he said to what
[1:02:34] has happened to what is yet still going
[1:02:36] to be in this new city
[1:02:39] that garnishing out remember they have
[1:02:42] each Foundation the names of The Twelve
[1:02:45] Apostles of the Lamb amends uh so that's
[1:02:49] the the Gentile after Christ came to to
[1:02:52] bring forth this Gentile bride but
[1:02:54] remember it's garnished this wall is
[1:02:57] garnished 19th verse foundations of the
[1:02:59] wall were garnished which is to
[1:03:02] embellish With Honor amen so it's not
[1:03:06] the foundations are of the Apostles but
[1:03:09] it's but it's being embellished With
[1:03:12] Honor by the 12 Patriarchs amen of the
[1:03:17] 12 tribes of Israel
[1:03:19] the garnishing is to embellish with
[1:03:22] honor to gain honor to give honor so
[1:03:26] even though the foundations are laid are
[1:03:29] of The Twelve Apostles that these walls
[1:03:31] are laid on it's also intertwining that
[1:03:33] we understand again this isn't just
[1:03:35] about the Gentile this is Gentile and
[1:03:37] Jew God's people that are that they're
[1:03:40] garnished with those 12 tribes of Israel
[1:03:42] that garnishing is just an embellishment
[1:03:45] as you I look you can find it here if
[1:03:48] you look up in the Greek amen that shows
[1:03:50] about the the the the metaphor type of
[1:03:54] it obviously there's a literal
[1:03:55] harnessing but the metaphor type is is a
[1:03:57] bringing of Honor it's a bringing in an
[1:04:00] embellishing of honor of these 12 Tribes
[1:04:03] of these Stones now let's go over to
[1:04:06] Ephesians or to uh Exodus and let's look
[1:04:09] at this for just a few moments because
[1:04:11] it tells us
[1:04:14] uh it tells us here and of course I've
[1:04:16] read the quote that brother Branham had
[1:04:17] last week amen of each one of these uh
[1:04:21] stones that it mentions now each one of
[1:04:25] the Stones it's mentioned here does not
[1:04:28] perfectly line up with the ones that we
[1:04:31] find in Exodus 28 that we're getting
[1:04:33] ready to read they don't line up
[1:04:35] perfectly but they because sometimes
[1:04:38] different names are given to different
[1:04:40] things through the scripture if you know
[1:04:42] that even different people have
[1:04:44] different names uh in the Bible that if
[1:04:47] you look at and depending on which book
[1:04:49] that you read uh you could look and say
[1:04:53] well that's a different name well it's a
[1:04:55] different name and it's the same person
[1:04:57] as over here
[1:04:58] it's not a different person a different
[1:05:00] name yes so if you line these uh line
[1:05:04] these up you can still find out that
[1:05:07] these 12 Stones because see some scoffer
[1:05:10] may look at it and say well those don't
[1:05:12] that's not the same word that's not the
[1:05:15] same Stone but when you do research you
[1:05:18] find out that yes these stones are the
[1:05:20] same
[1:05:21] now they may have evolved or uh changed
[1:05:24] names or something but they're all fall
[1:05:26] into that same category together to
[1:05:29] represent those 12 uh tribes of Israel
[1:05:32] now let's look at it real quick
[1:05:34] Revelation uh Exodus chapter 28.
[1:05:37] let's read it first
[1:05:39] and thou shalt make the breastplate and
[1:05:41] remember we talked about that last week
[1:05:43] I had this up here so you don't have to
[1:05:46] keep staring over this way let me show
[1:05:47] I'll just put it back up
[1:05:50] my artwork again is pretty hideous but
[1:05:54] um in a pinch real quickly that's a
[1:05:56] little bit the breastplate of Aaron
[1:06:00] looked like the 12 Stones
[1:06:03] uh
[1:06:08] the 12 Stones on the breastplate that we
[1:06:11] talked about remember the urum and the
[1:06:13] thumbum it was put there
[1:06:16] um on the
[1:06:18] on the breast That was supposed to be on
[1:06:20] the breast of Aaron as he went in over
[1:06:22] the heart of Aaron as he went into God
[1:06:25] Aaron the priest that was a represent
[1:06:28] that was a representative of those
[1:06:30] tribes was the one that bore that on his
[1:06:32] chest as he went into God and everywhere
[1:06:35] he went it was a representation amen
[1:06:38] that's why it meant so much to God that
[1:06:41] it be done that way and each one of
[1:06:42] these represented a different a
[1:06:45] different tribe amen let's read it again
[1:06:47] and thou shalt make the breastplate of
[1:06:51] judgment with cunning work after the
[1:06:54] work of the affid Thou shalt make it of
[1:06:57] gold of blue of purple and of scarlet
[1:07:00] and a fine twine linen Thou shalt make
[1:07:03] it and remember we talked last week God
[1:07:05] is extremely specific
[1:07:08] extremely explicit uh you can you can
[1:07:12] take this back or run it completely
[1:07:14] through the Old Testament and find when
[1:07:18] God gives something to this matter such
[1:07:21] as the ark when God spoke to know about
[1:07:24] the ark God gave very specific
[1:07:27] instructions on how he was supposed to
[1:07:29] build it what he was supposed to use uh
[1:07:32] the wood the pitch and everything of
[1:07:34] exactly how it was supposed to be how
[1:07:36] big it was supposed to be every single
[1:07:39] detail about it was to the minute detail
[1:07:43] that it was supposed to be now if no
[1:07:46] words had taken that Ark and tried to
[1:07:48] build it out of Oak which we wow that's
[1:07:50] a hot nice hard wood or or pecan which
[1:07:53] is even harder hickory wood uh is even
[1:07:55] harder than others and say well let's
[1:07:57] just take this it wouldn't have worked
[1:08:00] it had to be exactly the way God's word
[1:08:04] says it was to be now some people may
[1:08:07] take this message they may take the
[1:08:09] scripture and say well I think brother
[1:08:11] Branham meant this
[1:08:13] no you're building your Ark out of Oak
[1:08:14] you need to build that Ark exactly the
[1:08:17] way it said amen I'm not interested in
[1:08:20] what he meant I'm interested in what he
[1:08:22] said don't tell me what he meant tell me
[1:08:25] what he said amen and I'm not talking
[1:08:27] about just brother random I'm talking
[1:08:28] about the word you know tell me what it
[1:08:31] says not what's your interpretation of
[1:08:33] it is because I don't it'll be on my arc
[1:08:35] of Oakwood I don't want to build my Ark
[1:08:36] out of pine I want to build it exactly
[1:08:40] according to The Specific Instructions
[1:08:43] God gave you he does the same thing here
[1:08:46] and notice one of the reasons that God
[1:08:49] does this not just because God was uh
[1:08:54] picky uh although I guess in truth God
[1:08:58] really is oh yeah and he should be as we
[1:09:01] should be amen uh but he he's very
[1:09:05] specific about the colors
[1:09:07] uh the gold blue purple scarlet and the
[1:09:12] even the fine twine linen even to the
[1:09:16] Stitch
[1:09:17] the very Stitch the very thread that
[1:09:19] they are to use in the stitching had to
[1:09:22] be exactly right and again we talked
[1:09:25] about last week why was God as we talked
[1:09:28] about we said well he's picky okay
[1:09:30] that's kind of maybe a carnal word but
[1:09:32] uh I like using specific
[1:09:36] it had to be very specific
[1:09:38] just like in this day just like with
[1:09:42] God's word it had to be very specific
[1:09:45] why do you think that brother Branham
[1:09:48] could go into the woods and he can hit a
[1:09:52] attack on a piece of wood at 50 yards
[1:09:56] every single time
[1:09:59] why do you think that brother Branham
[1:10:01] had to be so precise and perfect in his
[1:10:05] natural life so much so that if that
[1:10:08] bullet didn't exactly on that attack he
[1:10:11] had to fix it it had to be made right
[1:10:12] amen he didn't go move the tack
[1:10:16] he didn't go move the target he fixed
[1:10:18] the source of the problem the gun
[1:10:20] you have to fix the source amen you
[1:10:24] can't just say well I want to make this
[1:10:26] different like this don't it's got to be
[1:10:28] specifically perfect according to what
[1:10:31] it says
[1:10:32] and why do you think brother Madam's
[1:10:34] life was like that right because of the
[1:10:37] word that brother Branham was to bring
[1:10:38] to a people it had to be specifically
[1:10:41] perfect exactly on letter by letter word
[1:10:44] of word lot upon line precept the Palm
[1:10:48] preset yes amen it had to be exactly
[1:10:51] according to God's word yes it couldn't
[1:10:53] be off not one I don't want a brother
[1:10:55] around say not one John or tittle yeah
[1:10:58] amen or one Mark or one uh quotation
[1:11:01] mark or one explanation or a point or
[1:11:04] whatever it was had to be exactly the
[1:11:06] way he said it right yeah could not be
[1:11:08] off had to be exactly the way God that's
[1:11:11] wait that's why God made brother random
[1:11:13] the way he was because he had to bring
[1:11:15] this word exactly the way he brought it
[1:11:16] well the same thing here Saints This
[1:11:20] Thread this colors this this uh uh uh
[1:11:24] material everything had to be exactly
[1:11:26] perfect because this man was to walk
[1:11:30] into a place that if it wasn't exactly
[1:11:33] perfect according to God's instructions
[1:11:35] that man fell dead right right it was a
[1:11:38] matter of life and death not spiritually
[1:11:41] literally physically life or death yes
[1:11:45] if he walked into that Holy place that
[1:11:48] holies of holies and there was just one
[1:11:50] thing out of order that man dropped dead
[1:11:52] yes again we talked about that last week
[1:11:55] or last time he dropped dead they put a
[1:11:58] rope around the man's waist now when he
[1:12:00] walked in there if he dropped dead you
[1:12:02] couldn't go in there and get him because
[1:12:03] whoever went in there after him dead
[1:12:05] died immediately yes
[1:12:07] amen so if he felt dead they had a Roper
[1:12:10] they'd pull him out that's the only way
[1:12:13] to get him out of there
[1:12:14] amen had to be exactly perfect so you
[1:12:17] see again we can use the word picky but
[1:12:20] God's very specific
[1:12:23] and his words got to be very specific
[1:12:25] yes and people say well this person does
[1:12:27] this and that I'm more interested in
[1:12:30] what a person preaches amen what is what
[1:12:35] is
[1:12:36] their revelation
[1:12:38] brother Tom going back to his prayer
[1:12:39] what is the revelation that God give to
[1:12:43] to bring that word because that's the
[1:12:45] thing that God cares about the most amen
[1:12:48] God didn't care whether I parted my hair
[1:12:50] on the left or right this morning
[1:12:52] amen he didn't care if I used any
[1:12:54] Grecian formula or made sure it was a
[1:12:56] little Browner looked a little better or
[1:12:58] he didn't care if I put contacts in my
[1:13:00] eyes or wore the glasses he didn't care
[1:13:02] about any of that what is the word what
[1:13:05] Lord saying
[1:13:06] amen what word comes forth that's the
[1:13:09] thing that God cares about is that word
[1:13:12] it's got to be line upon line precept on
[1:13:15] precept if it says gold friend it has to
[1:13:17] be gold if it says purple it better be
[1:13:20] purple if he said use this thread right
[1:13:22] here you better use that thread
[1:13:25] because today it's not a physical death
[1:13:28] necessarily it can be but it's a
[1:13:30] spiritual death yes separation from God
[1:13:34] unbelief amen remember what is sin sin
[1:13:37] is unbelief right disbelief not
[1:13:40] believing God's word people say oh I
[1:13:42] believe God's word but then you you fall
[1:13:44] onto some Fable or you you you give in
[1:13:47] to some man's idea or you give in to
[1:13:50] somebody because they had a prophecy or
[1:13:52] something you give in to and it takes
[1:13:54] you off the word amen yes in college
[1:13:58] without any repentance friend
[1:14:00] you don't even have to be a Christian to
[1:14:02] have a gift like that right oh my then
[1:14:05] what is it that God's concerned about
[1:14:07] the word it's got to be exactly perfect
[1:14:09] on the mark on the line so when God says
[1:14:13] this this is exactly what he means look
[1:14:15] it now
[1:14:16] find twine linen shall I'll make it
[1:14:19] Foursquare it shall be
[1:14:21] being doubled a span shall be the link
[1:14:24] thereof and a span shall be the breath
[1:14:27] thereof so it was a square I've got it
[1:14:28] as a rectangle up here but it was a
[1:14:30] square and now shall uh set in it the
[1:14:33] settings of stones even four rows of
[1:14:37] stones one two three four
[1:14:40] four rows of stones
[1:14:43] uh the first row
[1:14:46] now I I had this down I I didn't feel to
[1:14:50] write it because it just gets a little
[1:14:52] bit dry uh but I did I did do a little
[1:14:55] research on it so I have it myself
[1:14:58] uh if it's not something that's
[1:15:00] interesting to you or something that you
[1:15:02] care about or something that's okay but
[1:15:04] I just wanted to bring this out as an
[1:15:06] understanding and lesson of what God has
[1:15:08] got what God did there what God's doing
[1:15:10] now what he's going to do
[1:15:12] what God brings out is uh as uh
[1:15:15] something that we follow now the first
[1:15:17] Thou shalt said the setting of stones
[1:15:20] four rows the first shall be a Sardis a
[1:15:24] topaz and a carbuncle this shall be the
[1:15:26] first row the second row shall be an
[1:15:29] emerald sapphire and diamond and the
[1:15:32] third row of a linear I don't know how
[1:15:35] to pronounce that and a gay and an
[1:15:37] amethyst in the fourth row a barrel and
[1:15:40] an uh Onyx and a Jasper they shall be
[1:15:43] set in the gold in their enclosings this
[1:15:46] is exactly how God had to say and the
[1:15:49] stones shall be with the names shall be
[1:15:52] with the names of the children of Israel
[1:15:54] twelve according to their names like the
[1:15:56] Engravings of a Signet which the which
[1:15:59] the prophet which he carried on his
[1:16:01] shoulders amen he had that Signet that
[1:16:03] that that those 12 tribes of Israel we
[1:16:06] didn't go into all this teaching of it
[1:16:07] but that he wore in Gold Amen on his
[1:16:11] shoulders is straight to Heaven amen was
[1:16:13] the same those names written just like
[1:16:16] the NSYNC that's why it's saying in the
[1:16:18] segment every one of his names shall be
[1:16:21] according to the 12 tribes now you think
[1:16:24] these don't match up quite some do some
[1:16:27] don't but the first he said was a Sardis
[1:16:30] the Sardis matches up with the Sardis
[1:16:33] just like it does in Revelation 4 and
[1:16:35] matches up with what we just read in
[1:16:37] Revelation 21. the two match up the
[1:16:40] Sardis was the first and the Sardis was
[1:16:43] who
[1:16:44] we've already talked about it who was
[1:16:47] the first stone Sardis
[1:16:49] Reuben the first one born amen the
[1:16:52] firstborn of Israel Reuben was the start
[1:16:55] of stone that was the beginning amen the
[1:16:58] second was a topaz the topaz is also in
[1:17:01] the in the writings of Revelation 21 the
[1:17:04] topaz was Dan amen I could have wrote
[1:17:07] them all in there but it would have uh
[1:17:09] you know again I just didn't real just
[1:17:11] didn't know how much of that would
[1:17:13] interest you but if you want to write it
[1:17:14] down you go ahead and write it down the
[1:17:17] second one uh was a topaz that was Dan
[1:17:20] amen the third the third was carbuncle
[1:17:24] now that's the first row the third was
[1:17:26] the carbuckle now the car bump was the
[1:17:28] first one that does not show up in the
[1:17:32] Revelation 21. but I did some research
[1:17:35] and you can find out that that carbuncle
[1:17:38] also matches up with the with what was
[1:17:41] in Revelation 21 one of the ones I found
[1:17:43] difficult too
[1:17:45] um to read is the chal sedone or
[1:17:49] chalcedoni
[1:17:51] c-h-a-l-c-e-d-o-n-y it's that same Stone
[1:17:53] amen if you look at it and do some
[1:17:55] research and find out in the Greek in
[1:17:57] the Hebrew that the two match up the
[1:18:00] carbuncle and those two match up and
[1:18:02] those two uh uh and that last Stone
[1:18:06] there that that in that line was Levi
[1:18:09] now I think I said this the other day
[1:18:11] too
[1:18:13] if you try to go do some research
[1:18:15] yourself I did it uh I've done it before
[1:18:17] I had a lot of this written down from
[1:18:20] before some of it I couldn't find but
[1:18:23] um but if you go do some research you'll
[1:18:25] find there is some discrepancy with some
[1:18:28] people that they'll put a different one
[1:18:31] with a different Stone uh the best that
[1:18:33] I could find scripturally through the
[1:18:36] concordance and through some research
[1:18:38] was this is how they match up
[1:18:40] amen Levi is the third the car bumper
[1:18:45] or the chaldoni amen fourth the fourth
[1:18:49] was the emerald the emerald also matches
[1:18:53] up with the emerald in Revelation 21 and
[1:18:56] that's Judah five is the sapphire the
[1:19:00] sapphire also matches up to the sapphire
[1:19:03] in Revelation 21 that's issachar
[1:19:06] six is the diamond the diamond in in uh
[1:19:11] Exodus 28 does not show up in Revelation
[1:19:13] 21. amen it shows up as crystallite
[1:19:17] uh crystallite which is Zebulon
[1:19:20] Zebulon seven the the gure l-i-g-u-r-e
[1:19:25] which is in here uh is not mentioned in
[1:19:30] Revelation 21 but in research found that
[1:19:33] that stone matches there's actually
[1:19:36] there was actually a couple stones that
[1:19:38] matches them with it but but with the
[1:19:40] his sin
[1:19:41] the
[1:19:42] j-a-c-i-n-t-h uh we talked about that
[1:19:45] the road that the Tabernacle was on the
[1:19:47] corner of jesinto uh just doesn't have
[1:19:50] an O on the end of it I may pronounce it
[1:19:53] incorrectly but we always pronounce
[1:19:54] Jacinto with a J as an H so if it's
[1:19:58] different because it's Greek or Hebrew
[1:20:01] then forgive me but I just called The
[1:20:03] Descent or the ligur that's Simeon
[1:20:07] Simeon eighth
[1:20:09] eighth was the Agate uh the gate does
[1:20:13] not show up in Revelation 21 but the
[1:20:15] Chrysler Prime prices Crystal crisis uh
[1:20:20] was he a gate that's Nepali a nephily uh
[1:20:23] nine nine is the amethyst amethyst
[1:20:27] matches up that is God
[1:20:28] the tenth
[1:20:30] um see tenth is Barrel that matches with
[1:20:33] Revelation 21 is Asher 11 is the Onyx uh
[1:20:38] does not show up in Revelation 21 but
[1:20:40] the sardonyx does Amen so if you take
[1:20:43] the Onyx and you put basically s-a-r-d
[1:20:46] on front of it the sardonyx uh is Joseph
[1:20:49] you mean that's Joseph and then Benjamin
[1:20:52] of course the last is the Jasper
[1:20:55] we got Sardis and Jasper Benjamin's the
[1:20:59] last one now in those matching up to
[1:21:03] each one of the names that's on this
[1:21:05] Roman thumbel that was here that we
[1:21:09] remember is the breastplate of judgment
[1:21:12] that when anybody came that they had
[1:21:14] some kind of Prophecy or some kind of
[1:21:17] word from God or if they claimed to be
[1:21:20] some kind of a gift or person or
[1:21:21] something if they spoke it nobody had
[1:21:25] the discernment of the Holy Spirit to
[1:21:27] know whether that was true or not right
[1:21:28] so they were brought in front of this
[1:21:31] thing in front of the Sherman thumb and
[1:21:33] they would speak their dream they would
[1:21:35] speak their prophecy they would speak
[1:21:37] their Word of Wisdom whatever it was and
[1:21:39] if those lights lit up it was of God
[1:21:42] amen that those lights were just the the
[1:21:45] stones and there was no light to them
[1:21:47] but the stones supernaturally God would
[1:21:50] take these stones and these Stones would
[1:21:52] Flicker and light and glow and and and
[1:21:54] and it would prove that God was in it
[1:21:57] the light of God the spirit would come
[1:21:59] on that breastplate and it would light
[1:22:02] up all of these stones and those stones
[1:22:04] would Flicker and show that what this
[1:22:06] man was saying what this person was
[1:22:08] saying was from God
[1:22:10] this was God saying this this is God
[1:22:13] doing this amen and all of those lights
[1:22:15] would light up now what do we have today
[1:22:17] we have again like I said the other day
[1:22:19] we have the Holy Spirit
[1:22:21] the holy spirit that is within you to be
[1:22:24] able to discern and to know whether
[1:22:26] those lights go off when you hear
[1:22:28] something that is prophetic or a Word of
[1:22:30] Wisdom or something that you claim or
[1:22:32] someone claims is from God that has to
[1:22:35] light up in your spirit
[1:22:37] it has to light up in your soul it has
[1:22:40] to speak to you to tell you whether that
[1:22:43] is true from God or not right and if it
[1:22:45] does then you as an individual amen
[1:22:48] because remember God judges the Gentile
[1:22:50] bride as individuals even though we're
[1:22:52] one body group he judges them as
[1:22:55] individuals he judges Israel as a group
[1:22:57] amen there Israel as one group so they
[1:23:01] had all this as one but each one of you
[1:23:04] has a responsibility in yourself to have
[1:23:07] that discernment to have that Holy
[1:23:10] Spirit to know whether something is of
[1:23:12] God or if it is not if that lights up in
[1:23:16] your spirit then you can believe that
[1:23:17] would be from God Amen if there's
[1:23:19] something that goes off that just says
[1:23:21] I'm that his lights just aren't lighting
[1:23:24] up or as I've said before that it just
[1:23:27] didn't ring the bell there's just
[1:23:28] something in there and I've heard things
[1:23:30] preached before and knows nothing
[1:23:32] against anybody and it could have
[1:23:34] probably just been me but it when it
[1:23:36] just didn't ring true in my spirit of
[1:23:37] what I know that God would reveal to me
[1:23:40] or even if it was something that maybe I
[1:23:42] hadn't even read or studied before that
[1:23:44] somebody said and I thought well you
[1:23:47] know I I I'm not quite sure but if that
[1:23:50] light didn't light up in me then I just
[1:23:52] left it alone
[1:23:54] I just say that's not uh that's not
[1:23:57] something I deal with that's not
[1:23:58] something I'm gonna hold to I'm not
[1:24:00] going to call that brother a liar I'm
[1:24:02] not going to say he's off the word
[1:24:03] unless the Lord chose to be something
[1:24:05] specifically different and says this is
[1:24:07] in complete contrast to what that
[1:24:09] person's saying then I have no other
[1:24:12] choice but to believe in my life that
[1:24:14] that person's off the word
[1:24:16] but that's me you have to do the same
[1:24:19] thing does that light light up or does
[1:24:21] it not right see and when that light
[1:24:24] doesn't light up it speaks something to
[1:24:25] me it tells me something that that that
[1:24:28] uh you know uh maybe go research it look
[1:24:32] at it pray about it whatever but if it
[1:24:35] doesn't light up in me that Holy Spirit
[1:24:37] doesn't ring that truth then to me I
[1:24:40] like hands off right I don't I don't
[1:24:43] have anything to do with it or something
[1:24:44] and that person or whatever they could
[1:24:47] do whatever they feel whatever God
[1:24:49] speaks to them or shows them that's
[1:24:51] their choice but that's what they had
[1:24:52] here the urom and thumb them was when
[1:24:55] they came before God if that German
[1:24:57] thumb on them didn't light up then they
[1:24:59] knew that that person was lying and
[1:25:01] remember remember what brother Adam said
[1:25:03] If a person comes forth as a word from
[1:25:07] God
[1:25:07] a prophecy or a word from God or
[1:25:10] something like that if it doesn't happen
[1:25:12] or come true or they hit like one out of
[1:25:14] every 10 or every 100 or something that
[1:25:17] person should come before the
[1:25:18] congregation and repent because they're
[1:25:21] they're a uh anointed of the devil yes
[1:25:24] amen he said they're anointed of the
[1:25:27] devil because God doesn't lie and if
[1:25:29] they're speaking on God's behalf and
[1:25:31] that's not scripturalness not what God
[1:25:33] Said and it's not something that came to
[1:25:35] pass then they should come before that
[1:25:37] church and have that devil prayed off of
[1:25:39] them because they're influence of a
[1:25:41] wrong spirit because God doesn't lie yes
[1:25:44] amen amen that's how you know that's how
[1:25:47] the church stays clean that's how God
[1:25:49] keeps his children in this in in line in
[1:25:52] the place where they should be amen he
[1:25:55] did this with them here he does that
[1:25:56] with us here amen and it all goes down
[1:25:59] to those foundations friend
[1:26:01] it all goes down to those foundations it
[1:26:04] all goes down to the teaching the word
[1:26:06] that God has given us that we hold true
[1:26:08] that we believe that we that we uh a
[1:26:11] propagate of our own spirit in our own
[1:26:13] lives we hold that true see here and all
[1:26:16] those things matter to us and that's why
[1:26:19] we do this that's why it matters that's
[1:26:22] why we care amen because it speaks to us
[1:26:25] it does something to us now that human
[1:26:27] thumb have to light up for it to for it
[1:26:30] to ring true yes that's why see now he
[1:26:33] put those for now let's go back to
[1:26:34] revelation 21.
[1:26:36] he garnished those stones he garnished
[1:26:39] those foundations with those stones
[1:26:42] those stones have the names of the 12
[1:26:44] apostles
[1:26:46] but garnished with all of these precious
[1:26:50] stones
[1:26:52] which carry the names of the 12 tribes
[1:26:54] of Israel so it's not just the Gentile
[1:26:57] it's the Jews as well amen so we cover
[1:27:00] the foundations we see that these
[1:27:03] foundations represent the overcomer
[1:27:07] just like the person that brother random
[1:27:09] in the Bible says who occupy this is the
[1:27:12] overcomer
[1:27:15] the overcomer amen who is going to
[1:27:19] overcome who is going to overcome in
[1:27:21] this latter laodicea and rotten agent we
[1:27:24] live in today it's just going to be a
[1:27:26] few Saints yes amen but praise the Lord
[1:27:29] of God I plan to say that I am one of
[1:27:32] them amen I'm glad to say that I'm one
[1:27:35] of them now those foundations again
[1:27:39] Apostles and tribes amen all
[1:27:42] intermingled twine together now
[1:27:45] Revelation 21 again let's go let's read
[1:27:47] 12 Revelations uh 21 12 and 13.
[1:27:52] and when I start talking about the gates
[1:27:54] a little bit and the gates are probably
[1:27:56] going to take a little bit longer
[1:27:59] it's amazing some of the things that the
[1:28:02] Lord put in those Gates too but let's
[1:28:03] let's do this first uh 12th verse and
[1:28:07] had a wall great and high and had 12
[1:28:11] gates and at the gates 12 angels and the
[1:28:15] names written thereon were which are the
[1:28:18] names of the 12 tribes of Israel uh the
[1:28:21] 12 tribes of the children of Israel now
[1:28:24] we see that the gays the foundations had
[1:28:28] the names of The Twelve Apostles the
[1:28:31] gates had the names written in them of
[1:28:33] the 12 tribes of Israel amen remember
[1:28:37] again these both they both intertwined
[1:28:39] between Jew and Gentile
[1:28:42] these 12 gates uh had 12 angels at each
[1:28:46] one and the names written were the names
[1:28:49] of the 12 tribes of Israel on the East
[1:28:51] three gates on the north three gates on
[1:28:53] the south three gates on the west three
[1:28:55] gates three three three three three and
[1:28:57] three well now let's go down to the 21st
[1:29:00] first
[1:29:01] and we'll try to finish up with this
[1:29:03] here today
[1:29:04] amen
[1:29:06] and the gates and but I do want to come
[1:29:09] back to that 12th verse again though too
[1:29:12] and the 12 gates were 12 pearls
[1:29:16] every several gate was of one Pearl and
[1:29:20] the streets of the city were pure gold
[1:29:22] that were transparent now look at this
[1:29:25] uh
[1:29:27] to to make this
[1:29:29] make a little more I hate to say this
[1:29:32] word but a little more sense a little
[1:29:33] more understanding the 12 gates were 12
[1:29:36] players every several gate that just
[1:29:38] means an individual game
[1:29:40] each gate was individual of itself
[1:29:44] amen each one and we're going I'm gonna
[1:29:47] tease you but next time we're going to
[1:29:49] talk about how big these gates are now
[1:29:51] there's no place that I have found if
[1:29:53] anybody finds it you can let me know uh
[1:29:56] brother Pat's usually a good expert at
[1:29:58] that but if you find something let me
[1:30:00] know I cannot find how high they are but
[1:30:02] I have found how wide they are and it's
[1:30:05] outstanding but
[1:30:07] um I just
[1:30:09] I just described to that they're uh you
[1:30:13] know pretty much encompassed the wall
[1:30:15] they could be a little shorter on the
[1:30:17] bottom a little shorter on top I don't
[1:30:18] know doesn't say but
[1:30:21] um I figured they encompassed mostly all
[1:30:23] the wall uh which most skates do but you
[1:30:27] know sometimes like an entry door uh the
[1:30:31] door doesn't go all the way to the top
[1:30:32] uh it might come all the way to the
[1:30:34] bottom so there's I don't know I haven't
[1:30:36] found anything that says how tall they
[1:30:38] are but again have found how wide they
[1:30:41] are but notice each one is a gate unto
[1:30:44] itself it is of one material it is one
[1:30:49] solid gate and that material is what
[1:30:53] a pearl we just read it each uh at the
[1:30:58] 12 gates were 12 pearls every several
[1:31:01] gate was one Pearl
[1:31:04] one Pearl man wouldn't you like to see
[1:31:06] the oyster that created those Gates
[1:31:10] I think God just made them yeah
[1:31:13] praise the Lord can't imagine an oyster
[1:31:15] being quite that big especially once you
[1:31:17] find out how big they are but each gate
[1:31:20] is one Pearl just one Pearl amen
[1:31:24] uh and it just means that that each gate
[1:31:27] is again unto itself and each one of
[1:31:29] those pearls now each one of those Gates
[1:31:32] those uh this is where all the songs and
[1:31:35] the sayings come about the gates of
[1:31:37] pearl uh when you talk about the gates
[1:31:40] of pearl people always uh when I was in
[1:31:42] the nomination you always felt like that
[1:31:44] uh when you die you went right up to the
[1:31:47] gates of pearl they all the songs and
[1:31:49] all the things they talked about was
[1:31:51] right uh Peter ping had Peter having the
[1:31:54] key so you can't get it in without
[1:31:56] putting your permission you got to be
[1:31:58] able to be on Peter's good side and make
[1:32:00] sure he wrote woke up on the right side
[1:32:02] of the bed that morning to make sure
[1:32:03] when he has that key and you get up
[1:32:05] there that he opens that gate for you oh
[1:32:08] we know that's much nonsense but that's
[1:32:10] how a lot of people actually probably
[1:32:12] still think of it a lot of people still
[1:32:15] believe or think
[1:32:16] along those lines just like I did when I
[1:32:19] was a kid but thank God for truth
[1:32:21] Revelation and the word
[1:32:23] any competent
[1:32:27] educated person that can read this can
[1:32:29] see the the
[1:32:33] it just goes down to the the fact that
[1:32:36] there's nicolaitanism and the people
[1:32:37] sitting in the pews just listen to what
[1:32:39] the priests are saying and they don't
[1:32:40] study for themselves they don't pray for
[1:32:42] themselves they don't read the Bible
[1:32:43] they don't know what it says and so they
[1:32:46] just take what they say you know and uh
[1:32:49] those Pearly Gates so that's that's
[1:32:51] where the Pearly Gates came from and
[1:32:53] each one and and
[1:32:55] there are Gates of pearl but a little
[1:32:59] different scenario and the way it plays
[1:33:01] out when we get there in this new city
[1:33:03] than what I had learned or what I had
[1:33:05] heard was taught to me but they are
[1:33:08] those Gates of pearl each one each Pearl
[1:33:10] now has the name of the 12 tribes of
[1:33:13] Israel now uh I want to go back
[1:33:17] something here because the next thing I
[1:33:19] want to do is I want to start talking
[1:33:22] about those pearls getting to the
[1:33:25] scripture of the Pearl
[1:33:28] we might actually get to um I might
[1:33:31] actually get to
[1:33:33] another part of this before we close up
[1:33:35] today but uh I want to go back to the
[1:33:38] 12th first I told you we wanted to talk
[1:33:40] about the 12th verse again as I finish
[1:33:42] this
[1:33:43] uh 2112 Revelation 21 12.
[1:33:48] and had a wall great and high had 12
[1:33:50] gates at at listen to this now at the 12
[1:33:54] uh at the gates 12 angels
[1:33:59] so there's an angel
[1:34:01] posted at every game right there's the
[1:34:05] gate with 1286 Hawaii is there an angel
[1:34:08] posted at every game
[1:34:11] every gate now recognize what is the
[1:34:14] gate
[1:34:15] what is the door
[1:34:17] a door's an entryway a door is the way
[1:34:21] that you can come in to wherever the
[1:34:24] facility is to this new city is through
[1:34:27] the gates now we know the gates are open
[1:34:29] all the time the Bible told us we read
[1:34:31] that the other day the gates are never
[1:34:33] closed by night or day of course we say
[1:34:36] night but there is no night per se but
[1:34:38] the gates are open all the time so these
[1:34:41] Gates of pearl stand open all the time
[1:34:43] and an angel posted at every gate so
[1:34:47] it's a it's an angel at every entryway
[1:34:51] of anybody that's outside the city that
[1:34:55] wants to come into the city there's an
[1:34:58] angel there standing guard well that's
[1:35:01] nothing unusual because the scripture
[1:35:04] tells us that the angels are always
[1:35:06] there at guard the Angels always stand
[1:35:09] at guard let's go to Rebel uh go to
[1:35:11] Genesis real quick I got a couple
[1:35:13] scriptures I want to read
[1:35:16] in Genesis chapter 3
[1:35:21] Genesis chapter 3
[1:35:28] Genesis chapter 3 verse 23 and 24.
[1:35:33] look at this now just even at the Garden
[1:35:36] of Eden when Adam and Eve were kicked
[1:35:38] out of the Garden of Eden therefore the
[1:35:40] Lord God sent him forth from the Garden
[1:35:43] of Eden to till the ground from when she
[1:35:45] was taken so he God drove out the man
[1:35:48] Adam and he placed at the east of the
[1:35:52] Garden of Eden cherubims
[1:35:54] with a flaming sword which turned every
[1:35:57] way to keep the weight of the Tree of
[1:36:00] Life
[1:36:00] God
[1:36:02] Germans guarding Chairman's guarding the
[1:36:07] Angels guarding the way to the to the
[1:36:10] Tree of Life the Angels guarding
[1:36:12] remember we talked about months ago
[1:36:16] years ago Matthew Mark Luke and John the
[1:36:19] Angels guarding those gospels amen those
[1:36:23] angels notice revelation
[1:36:26] as Revelation gives us the plagues the
[1:36:30] vows the the warnings the the
[1:36:32] trumpetings there's angels that are
[1:36:36] there at God there's angels that God
[1:36:38] sends forward to Mark those that are
[1:36:40] crying and sign for the Abominations
[1:36:42] desolation done to the land read
[1:36:44] Revelation 7 you see those angels that
[1:36:47] are there uh
[1:36:48] uh Psalms Psalms chapter 34. verse 7 the
[1:36:54] angel of the Lord and campeth round
[1:36:57] about them that fear Him and delivereth
[1:36:59] them the Angels those 12 angels are
[1:37:03] there to keep guard
[1:37:05] to watch over the entryway
[1:37:09] there's angels with you Saints today
[1:37:12] that watch over you and that protect the
[1:37:16] entryway that keep you from you said
[1:37:20] well you know things happen yes they do
[1:37:23] and God might allow that angel to draw
[1:37:26] back for a moment to allow a sickness or
[1:37:28] or something we don't know God does
[1:37:31] think different things for different
[1:37:32] reasons but we know that God look at job
[1:37:36] Satan couldn't even touch job if God
[1:37:39] didn't take that hedge away we spoke
[1:37:41] about that around Halloween God had to
[1:37:44] take that hedge away from job before
[1:37:46] Satan could even give to job and then
[1:37:50] God said God took an angel away let him
[1:37:53] get to all that he has but don't touch
[1:37:55] Joe so Satan could do everything but
[1:37:58] touch Joe and then the second time God
[1:38:01] told him and pulled back another that
[1:38:03] angel that was protecting him back and
[1:38:05] said now you can touch his flesh but
[1:38:07] don't take his life right amen so each
[1:38:10] one it had its place in position that it
[1:38:13] was guarding and protecting but he can
[1:38:16] only do what God allowed him to do right
[1:38:18] or first Sons and Daughters of God
[1:38:20] friend even if things may happen God
[1:38:23] will not allow any more to you than what
[1:38:27] he for whatever reason he may do
[1:38:30] whether it be an accident or a sickness
[1:38:33] or whatever it is if we're children of
[1:38:36] God
[1:38:37] now for not children of God God's not
[1:38:39] responsible to you but if we're children
[1:38:40] of God God's responsible he takes care
[1:38:43] of his own yes he does this is all
[1:38:46] nothing but a reflection of those Angels
[1:38:48] standing at guard of each place standing
[1:38:51] washed amen the entryway protecting that
[1:38:55] entryway keeping that entryway clear so
[1:38:59] that there's no there's no problems
[1:39:01] there's no issues amen God make sure
[1:39:04] that each one of those because when I
[1:39:06] looked at it when I first I said what
[1:39:09] what would be the point of an Angel
[1:39:11] being in every game well then it becomes
[1:39:14] clear it's all through the scripture
[1:39:16] it's not um it's not hard to understand
[1:39:18] or hard to believe it's all through the
[1:39:20] Bible God has his angels that are
[1:39:23] continually moving and doing whatever
[1:39:26] God commissions them to do yes amen that
[1:39:29] in his beck and call they're protecting
[1:39:31] our entry away for each one of us Satan
[1:39:33] can't even touch you without God's
[1:39:35] permission yes you believe that amen God
[1:39:37] Satan you can't even touch you without
[1:39:39] God's permission that's right amen what
[1:39:41] is it that angel is there guarding that
[1:39:43] way yes amen protecting keeping it amen
[1:39:47] so that nothing unforeseen or something
[1:39:50] beyond that happens
[1:39:51] amen God only allows what he desires or
[1:39:55] what he would let allow amen of those
[1:39:57] angels now
[1:39:59] of each one of those uh Gates
[1:40:03] I'm gonna close here
[1:40:05] um
[1:40:08] remember each one of those Gates
[1:40:11] is a gate of Pearl and I'm going to read
[1:40:14] this quote
[1:40:15] well it's not a quote it's uh it's uh
[1:40:18] from the Lexicon
[1:40:20] of that Pearl Pearl we know of course is
[1:40:24] is a literal Pearl I believe this Pearl
[1:40:26] will be literal Pearl just like I
[1:40:28] believe this city is a little city walls
[1:40:30] of literal wall foundations literal
[1:40:32] foundations I believe the gates their
[1:40:34] literal Foundation of literal city of
[1:40:37] transparent gold a literal Pearl that
[1:40:41] that God has created that is there with
[1:40:43] the names of the 12 tribes of Israel but
[1:40:45] there is also a again typology
[1:40:50] a reason for that Pearl we could go back
[1:40:54] in Matthew which uh Lord willing we'll
[1:40:56] do next time and and see and look at
[1:40:59] that that Pearl
[1:41:01] a lot of people get this backwards but I
[1:41:05] want us to see the true reference to
[1:41:08] that Pearl but if you look in the if you
[1:41:11] look in the Lexicon under this Pearl
[1:41:15] it says a pearl is a word
[1:41:19] of great value
[1:41:22] a word of Great Value a pearl is a word
[1:41:25] of great value
[1:41:27] not
[1:41:29] it's outstanding to know who this Pearl
[1:41:32] is
[1:41:33] who this Pro represents amen know that
[1:41:37] it is a word of Great Value he said yes
[1:41:40] God is of great value
[1:41:43] who is of Great Value to God
[1:41:46] amen
[1:41:48] praise let's stand to our feet I want to
[1:41:50] give it away Savannah
[1:41:53] some of you already see the churning so
[1:42:01] amen Lord willing
[1:42:03] uh we'll get to that part next time
[1:42:08] and much more of that too
[1:42:12] it's incredible I I thought it was going
[1:42:15] to be something more of a a little
[1:42:18] shorter along the lines of shorter but
[1:42:21] uh
[1:42:23] God just keeps adding and adding so
[1:42:26] just keep going on with it praise the
[1:42:28] Lord
[1:42:29] amen let's sing this course uh 398 this
[1:42:33] home book he paid the debt we've seen
[1:42:35] that I mean I may not sing all of them
[1:42:38] but just maybe the first verse here
[1:42:42] that means thankful that he paid that
[1:42:44] debt praise the Lord Jesus he paid that
[1:42:48] debt he didn't know it I owed it
[1:42:50] he means my dad he took my place amen
[1:42:54] I'm the one that should have been that
[1:42:55] on that cross I'm the one that should
[1:42:57] have died that cruel death I'm the one
[1:42:59] that earned it I deserve it
[1:43:02] but he paid it for me
[1:43:04] now I don't have to
[1:43:07] the Lord
[1:43:08] [Music]
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:25] I
[1:43:28] needed someone to wash my sins away
[1:43:34] [Music]
[1:43:36] and now I sing a brand new song of
[1:43:41] Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus

[1:45:18] it so we don't have to take it amen it's
[1:45:21] all by his grace

[1:46:04] somewhere but it's all right the Lord
[1:46:06] helps me anyway so but uh it was it was
[1:46:09] it was 88 89 in Orlando last time and
[1:46:14] the humidity wasn't horrible though
[1:46:16] humidity in the day it was around 50-ish
[1:46:18] percent so I've been there it was
[1:46:22] 95.95 so that's just really unbearable
[1:46:26] almost but going back to Orlando so I'm
[1:46:28] leaving this afternoon to go back there
[1:46:30] and then next Saturday my wife will be
[1:46:34] flying to Charlotte to meet me I'm going
[1:46:36] to fly from the job in Orlando to
[1:46:38] Charlotte to meet her there on Saturday
[1:46:40] so there will not be service here next
[1:46:42] Sunday
[1:46:43] I mentioned to you about brother Roger
[1:46:45] brother Rogers uh his uh purchase went
[1:46:49] through so they now own a church down uh
[1:46:54] Coast to the gym show actually off of
[1:46:57] 22nd Street back in that neighborhood
[1:47:00] back in there I don't remember the exact
[1:47:02] address but if you go down like Fourth
[1:47:05] Street or something back in there uh he
[1:47:08] just they just purchased a church in
[1:47:10] there so please keep them in prayer the
[1:47:12] Lord just continue to bless that bless
[1:47:14] them for that so there but there will as
[1:47:17] a result there won't be a service here
[1:47:19] next Sunday I thought if he didn't if
[1:47:21] the purchase didn't go through he was he
[1:47:23] would come and just have his and our
[1:47:25] service together but since they had that
[1:47:28] building now they're they'll have their
[1:47:30] service there you're welcome to go visit
[1:47:31] them you'd like if you want to let me
[1:47:34] know I'll give you the address or visit
[1:47:36] any other Church whatever you feel to do
[1:47:38] but we will not have service here next
[1:47:39] Sunday so please remember that and
[1:47:43] that's

[1:48:53] with me uh I'm praying this place get
[1:48:55] out of here
[1:48:56] been frame before they ever moved in
[1:49:00] I got to talk to Craig because he told
[1:49:03] me this was not going to be open on
[1:49:04] Sunday
[1:49:05] if it's going to stay open and they're
[1:49:08] going to keep that going we're going to
[1:49:10] have to find another place to go and I
[1:49:12] don't feel very tolerable with the boom
[1:49:14] boom Going from behind me during service
[1:49:17] like this so if they can't at least keep
[1:49:20] the noise down for a couple hours then
[1:49:22] we'll need to find another place
[1:49:25] if God doesn't get them out of here soon
[1:49:27] very soon
[1:49:29] so just help me I just say that to you
[1:49:31] help me pray about it that whatever the
[1:49:35] Lord wants the lord gave us this place
[1:49:37] and if he has another place for us he'll
[1:49:39] show us
[1:49:40] and if he wants us to stay here they
[1:49:42] gotta go it's just it's just really that
[1:49:45] simple but it is a matter of prayer so
[1:49:48] please join with me in prayer about that
[1:49:50] I'd appreciate that very much
[1:49:52] love to have a place of our own that we
