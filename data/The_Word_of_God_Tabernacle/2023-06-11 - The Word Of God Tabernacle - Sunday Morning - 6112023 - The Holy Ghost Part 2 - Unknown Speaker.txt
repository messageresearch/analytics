amen praise the Lord it never loses its power amen the same today as it has always been because it's not the chemistry of the blood but it's the life that's in the blood amenities that life that's in that blood is what come back on the worshiper you've been that's what we depend on that's what we look to and Trust in amen praise the Lord Jesus anyone have a quick testimony before we change the world of the service welcome welcome holy spirit before I came to church this morning amen praise the Lord wonderful I guess that could be a general psalm for every server so so wonderful amen God is mindful isn't he sister Norman and you know what praise the Lord amen praise the Lord Jesus amen thank you Lord Saints don't think you're the only ones that Satan does that do we it's a Sunday occurrence for your pastor so it happens every Sunday always thoughts and I just be honest thoughts come in why do you do this why are you still here or why you know all those things all the time and then of course amen you get in prayer here and the Lord just moves and then you get into service he sweeps through and you like cutting my praise God Amen there's nothing like it amen no substitute I heard somebody said the other day said uh it was a question he was asking back and forth they said where where would you like to be when you pass away and you know and you die where where would you want to be now different people is states or cities or whatever I said personally you know outside of maybe your sleep I guess that's maybe one of the more people peaceful things but um right here I guess if I was if I was if this was man was never taste death I'd want to be right in the whole pit preaching the department preaching the gospel as in best answer I can think of anyway praise the Lord said it might be traumatic for those standing here sitting there but for me personally there's there's just nothing like uh being here Amen to me praise the Lord amen let's stand to our feet if we could and we'll turn the scripture again today go over to back to Genesis I'm going to read the same scripture we began on with our study that we started last week on the Holy Spirit I want to go back to Genesis chapter 3 read the 21st verse Genesis 3 21. to start so this be the Holy Spirit part two amen and we're getting uh still back a little bit on the foreshadowing here so shadowing of Christ to the Holy Spirit and so this would be a holy spirit part two foreshadowed part two amen before you read the word of God though can we just fire our heads for a moment of prayer Lord Jesus Lord we're so privileged Lord to know you and to know your word and to Know You Lord and the power of your Resurrection know you to be here again today Lord to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or thing Lord we know that regardless of time or uh uh Place God that you always meet with us Lord because you are no respecter of person Lord you are no respecter a place Lord I've been in big services and I've seen the move of God and I've been in a handful Lord and I've seen a powerful move of God and Lord again as you continue to show us yourself real to us Lord and this this little assembly we want to thank you Father for blessing us so much this morning so far God and knowing Lord is just a prequel God of of the word that you're going to minister to our hearts here right now God and let it be done in our hearts according to your perfect will Lord whatever purpose you have for this service Lord whatever reason we would be here for God we want to fulfill it according to your perfect will because your perfect will is the only thing that we are that's what we shoot for that's our goal that's our aim that's that's what we try to do Lord is not in our in the entirety of Our Lives is your perfect will so Lord may you have your way God in remaining part of this service speak to these lips anoint lips and ears God that that whatever you have accomplished would be done Lord and blessed according to your perfect will I pray Lord as you rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt Hindu or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we thank you Lord for this place for this time lord for these people God would just give you the glory and honor worship you praise you there's no one like you father we thank you for it Lord and we commit all things to you move upon the request the needs the the prayer requests God Lord this morning we know that your mom beloved father is we lift in them before you Godly you were moving on them before they ever became needs they were in your Lord we just believe that your hand is upon them to bless and touch and make a way where there seem to be no way Lord and traveling mercies and healing bodies and strengthening us along the way we just thank you for it Lord we commit ourselves to you now the remaining part of the service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 21. unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats and skins and clothed him you could be seated if you'd like amen we notice beginning just just a few moments of uh going back from last week we noticed that uh it was God's decision that it took blood we understand why that it took blood because the original sin was a blood act it was a transfer of hemoglobin and blood so the the sacrifice had to meet the sin so Jesus coming but we also recognize of course through what God did here and helping Adam and Eve understand that they had to become a part of their sacrifice and had to be clothed in their sacrifice identified with their sacrifice that uh Cain and Abel had to be along the same uh the song along the same lines they had to be the exact same way they had to become identified with their sacrifice and the fact that Cain's sacrifice failed in in the most important part and that was the life the blood identifying with their sac sacrifice able sacrifice was more excellent because of Revelation because of Faith he offered to God a more excellent sacrifice identified himself with his sacrifice and recognizing that it took the blood it was the blood that was that was God's decision a lot of people try to get away from the blood a lot of people in modern religion want to do away with the blood don't want to sing songs about the blood but friend without that blood where would any of us be they want to look at the carnal part of it in the chemistry of the blood but the chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ merely fell on the earth to redeem the Earth back it's the light that's in the blood that come back on the worshiper that is the holy spirit that we know of it was the light that was in the blood that God recognized when he killed the Lambs and gave Adam and Eve the sheepskin it was the life in the blood that God identified with able sacrifice as being more excellent than Cain sacrifice it's the life within the blood that God recognized that makes the difference between God and man and it's that light that's in that blood is what changes the whole thing the breaking of that blood cell is what makes before God a a sacrifice that he receives unto himself amen that blood in your heart amen had to be uh identified there had to be the sacrifice there had to be the the life that that brought back amen now of course the animal didn't have a soul there was no way that life could identify back as far as the soul is concerned like when Jesus Christ the Supreme sacrifice the soul came the Holy Spirit back into man to identify with each one of us today not just the chemistry of the blood but recognizing that our sacrifice died for us and that we become identified with our sacrifice because of his life in US amen now all of us all of us live on dead substance all of us live on dead substance whether it's naturally or spiritually we all live on dead substance naturally and spiritually something had to die spiritually for us to live before God Almighty spiritually in his presence something has to die naturally for you to live naturally um you have vegans you have uh uh uh I don't even know a vegetarians uh they don't believe in eating meat and and some for good reason and that's okay that's their choice but you know those who don't believe in uh killing an animal uh don't recognize that whatever you eat it had to die for you to be able to live if you chopped off a lead ahead of us ahead of lettuce that lettuce had to die for you to be able to live if you cut down asparagus brussels sprouts green beans whatever it is that fruit a vegetable it had to die for you to be able to live the problem is in the carnal line they don't see the depth of Botany life the way they see the death of animals because let's face it a peach doesn't usually look back at you an apple doesn't usually uh uh lick you or or befriend you uh when you cut an apple blood doesn't come out so and identifying it as such uh even if a person simply eats botany like they steal the body in life has to die before they can live so something has to die naturally for us to be able to sustain natural life then obviously something has to die spiritually for us to live in a spiritual life for our lives to live spiritually now it's the life that's in that blood that's what makes a difference let's go over to Genesis uh chapter 4 just right over Genesis 4 1. I'm not going to background anymore on Cain and Abel sacrifice than I already had but I wanted to read beginning with the first verse for this subject to gain the entirety of totality of the scripture reading up to this point so we'll start with the first verse Genesis chapter 4 verse 1. and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived in Bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord again of course all life comes from God amen all life comes from God so even if it's a even if it's a wrong kind of life even if from people that are uh atheists or people that are uh drug addicts or drunkards whatever uh they could be the two most low life people on the planet that life has to come from God Amen we talked about that in the Book of Life Lamb's Book of Life all life is sacred to God Amen remember that no brother Ram said we know all life is sacred to God Amen no matter what comes so when she said I've gotten a man from the Lord obviously she got a man from the Lord because all life comes from God so that doesn't someone tries to argue that with the serpent seed uh that doesn't carry much water because the fact is all life comes from God and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel is The Keeper of the sheep and Cain was a jeweler of the ground in the process of time it came to pass they came brought to the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought up the first things of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect him to Abel and to his offering but unto Canaan to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very rough in his accountants fell the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wrath and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou know to me I've said this before and I'll say it again to me this is one of the greatest acts of the grace of God that I that you'll ever see in the Bible in my opinion one of the greatest acts of the grace of God even though the grace of God hadn't reached the magnification that we know it today by the blood of Jesus Christ still God a merciful god who would that all would repent amen that merciful god speaking live to ear if you will to the serpent seat himself and told him this if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted mine God is saved if you just do right I will accept you being the serpent seed God was willing to accept Cain being the serpent scene if he would just do right that's why we know as brother Graham said many times that if Satan came through the blood he would be your brother but said he can't do it because it's not in him to do he it wasn't for him in him to be able to do amen Satan can quote every word of this Bible every word of this message letter for letter A word by word way better than any human brother random even himself but he can't live it he can't obey it that's the difference in in someone who believes they've got the Holy Ghost and someone who has the Holy Ghost someone who has the Holy Ghost receives the word and the only way you can receive the word is to become the word he can't do that if he were to do that again he would be your brother if Cain had done that God said I will receive you if you'll just do that but he wouldn't do it couldn't do it and if doubts again to me if that's not the grace of God I don't know I don't know where you find it offering offering the serpent seed an opportunity to repent mine that's a just God there that's a fair and righteous and just God amen and if thou doest uh and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him Cain talked with Abel now his brother and he came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him again had not in him the capacity to do right he was of the wrong seed amen you can beg all day long for a tree to bring forth oranges but if you put an apple seed in the ground you're going to get apples they don't count how hard you try I don't know how much you water and I don't care how much fertilizer you may put a uh some magically chemistry generated by science something that will change the seed it will not happen if what was in that seed was planted comes forth it's going to be an apple not oranges don't matter how hard you try and this cane was of the serpent seat and no matter how much God offered it to him in fact it doesn't say but could you imagine I mean a lot of people do this so I I can only kind of Garner what I have learned out of life to apply it to the scripture and a lot of people when you offer it to them oh they're gung-ho they like the thought of it they want to do that they they they their desires they they want to go that way but they can't do it when it comes right down to the rubber meeting the road they just don't have it in them to do they just they just won't do it they turn and walk away sometimes they may come to church for a little while sometimes they may play the part a little while but the truth of it is it's just not in them to do it wasn't then came to do I can imagine King's probably sitting there talking to God thinking okay yeah man I'll I'll do what's right uh that he may have even said I promise I'll do I'll do what's right but then when it came down to to enacting or living remember when John when God said eat the book and it was sweetest honey in his mouth became bitter in his belly well when someone receives the word it's something that comes to Sweden say oh that's wonderful yes I like hearing that yes that sounds good oh I enjoy being around those people oh I like feeling that Spirit but when it comes to living it amen when it comes to digesting it it became bitter yeah amen now to those that have the Holy Ghost they have something to take over and to control them to the point control is probably not the right word but allow them to to in obedience by love to Christ to do the work to live the word but others don't when it when it gets down to that point they can't live it when it comes to actually oh yes God that sounds great I love that that sounds wonderful but when it comes down to actually meeting your life needing those expectations it will fail miserably you know why because it's you doing it is the person doing it you can't do it we cannot live this life without him that's why we love him so much amen that's why we love him so that's why we live in an act and do the way we do because we love him amen praise the lord we love him see but when it come down I can imagine Kane probably thought that was a great deal that sounds good God but when it come right down to it he meets his brother amen whom he was still already mad at are still mad at amen and when he met him and talked to him he ended up killing him and the Lord said unto Caine where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper now that's exactly the Arrogant smug attitude amen a lot of people have it today amen am I My Brother's Keeper you manage talking amen but God's a just God now God's a fair God he understands we as humans we we probably get beside ourselves sometimes say things maybe we shouldn't say Amen but uh but he said but then God said what hath thou done now again I liken this to what we sp Let me just finish it and then we'll go from there because I sometimes I want you to understand when the Lord enlightens me on things and shows me things and sometimes gives me the words even just because my mouth's open he puts things in my mouth I don't even know right until after it's said yeah and he did that in prayer for me this morning I was talking to him and something came out of my mouth I said why did I even say that but then it brought it brought to me something that enlightened it was just it was just beautiful I said that that's a question I had been in my heart looking for anyway so we don't know but to help you understand scripturally now so let's finish he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground now we'll get to the voice of the blood in a minute the life and the blood which was the point of the scripture reading here but I want you to understand where I come from when I talk about or or I feel like the Lord's give me something that that may look like it's not in the scripture but if you look peoples have never met Jesus I don't know Jesus but if you if you read the scripture first of all you have a spirit and you read the scripture and you get his characteristics um my wife knows now I don't have to tell her but she knows that if we were to go to a sushi restaurant I would not eat she knows that I'm giving something simple okay she knows that I don't have to tell her that because she knows me you understand a lot of times people say well it doesn't exactly say that but when you know God and you know the characteristics of Jesus Christ through his spirit in you and what his word says about him you don't have to have something necessarily in black and white because you know what is characteristics are yeah and the fact that I mentioned the other day uh that may have looked contrary to the scripture when it says that Adam hid from God and God come down and said where are you Adam remember what we talked about God knows everything that ever happens ever in the universe to every millisecond to the smallest bug bird whatever it is on the Earth everything about everybody and everything everything you've said everything you've thought there's not one thing God doesn't know about that's the almighty God I'm talking about so if you have that God coming down and asking where are you you take the omnipotence of God away when you take that scripture at face value that God didn't actually know where Adam was you can't take for face value that God because God is the God of all time space and Eternity nothing can happen to us know about you can't go anywhere he doesn't know where you are so how could that Almighty omnipotent God all knowing Universal I'm the present God not know where Adam was now look at this scripture this scripture God is coming to Cain and he has Cain where is your brother Abel again as if though God doesn't know where Abel is see if you take that scripture face value you say well this God doesn't even know where Abel is because he's asking cable world no he's not asking Cain where's your brother he's asking Cain where is your brother like he didn't ask Adam where are you Adam do you know where you are Adam where are you in the sense do you know what you did do you know where you are God is asking Cain the same thing God knows exactly where Abel is but he's asking Cain cane what have you done what have you done to your brother Abel where is your brother Abel that you've done this and Katie's like well I don't know I'm Not My Brother's Keeper and God says what his blood is crying to me so what God is now telling Cain is I know where he is Cain and his blood's crying out to me the light that was in the blood that you just took from him is calling out God knows exactly where he is she understands he he's not asking King where Abel is in the sense of I don't know where Abel is he's asking him in the sense of Cain do you know what you've done you know where he is it is because then God comes along and tells Cain I know exactly where he is because his blood's crying out to me amen so when you when you when you check the context and uh and the characteristic in the scripture you can know that I wasn't off my rocker when I was talking about God in the scripture saying Where Art Thou Adam he knew exactly where Adam was he knew exactly where Abel was now Abel's blood so hopefully by the scripture you can clarify and understand if someone gets up and tries to bring that administrate face value that God doesn't know where Abel is like God didn't know where Adam and Eve were God knew exactly where they were because he's God you make God less than what he really is he's the omnipresent Almighty omnipotent all-knowing God amen amen you make him in to believe that in that context you make him less than what he is amen God knows exactly he does the same thing to us and God speaks to us in that way maybe not live to hear audibly but he speaks to us in that context too amen because it's uh it's the test for us what is God testing us about what is God proving us so that we know amen I I want to know and God tests us so that we know he knows amen there's no doubt about that he knows but he wants to know and make sure we know amen now this Blood the blood of Abel the blood of Abel the light that was in the blood when the blood cell was broke the life released when before almighty God and that blood was speaking that blood was speaking to God amen the Life In The Blood now it can bring in a better light to understand why God would accept that as a sacrifice even if it was just a bull's goats sheeps Lambs even if it was just a animal life that was a covering for them in that day even if it was something simple as that that life in that blood spoke to God now there was no soul in the animal so it doesn't speak per se in the context that Abel's blood does but that blood before God signifies a life was sacrificed for their life to cover their wrongdoings amen because there's no way the law could make anybody perfect there's no way that the law could justify anybody there's no way that the law could take you back to being clean and pure without spot wrinkle or blemish there's no way the lock amen even the blood of the bulls and goats wasn't sufficient it just covered amen it's just like uh it's just like this bottle of water now it didn't cover it very good but you know if this was big enough you wouldn't be able to see this bottle of water you wouldn't even know it was here because it covered it but see it's still there but it's covered that's all those that's all those Bloods of the bulls and ghosts the animals that's all it did was cover that amen so they were able to to operate in God's presence because that was acceptable to God at that time knowing that Genesis 3 21 was to be fulfilled in its completeness through Jesus Christ knowing that the scripture we're about to read was going to be fulfilled in this fullness through Jesus Christ knowing that we see this as the blood speaking amen gave a more excellent uh voice before God just like that voice speaking let's look in Hebrews all the way back over in Hebrews now the 12th chapter Hebrews 12 24. amen would skip ahead just a little bit but we'll go back and to Hebrews 12 24 now and to Jesus to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling amen back in Moses time and and that spit that speaketh better things than that of Abel as Abel's voice was speaking through the blood it spoke through the sprinkling of the blood of the of the animals and Moses and it spoke before God not to the same capacity because again it just spoke as animal life not human life but it was it was laid before God because God required that and it was accepted by God that the animal once it sacrifice that that life and that that innocent life in that blood once that qualification was met was to God acceptable it made it acceptable to God but now notice even in Hebrews it speaks of the blood of Abel speaking but that the blood of Jesus Christ spoke better things even than that let's go over to Exodus now Exodus chapter 12. continuing on with the foreshadowing and we'll we'll probably finish with this Exodus 12 we all know the Paschal Lamb Passover Lamb Exodus 12 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt now notice of course this was the time that all the plagues were happening and Pharaoh's hardened heart would not let his children go and God wants to set apart now remember this last play the killing off of the firstborn death death when the death angel was to come through there was a purpose behind it people would look you'd see people today they would they would completely throw this away because that's just cruel why would an almighty God take all the firstborn of Egypt and kill them people can't because they don't understand the revelations they don't get the truth behind Christ the the word to be able to realize who he is amen by the revelation of the word the spirit speaks to us to understand what what God was doing amen see God life is precious to God but God knows there's like a lot of people don't know or forget about that there's far greater Beyond this realm that we have that we don't know this is this life is just a temporal life it's just a this our human life is just a temporal life it it's here today gone tomorrow the Bible tells our human life was like a vapor you ever watched a vapor come up I used to when I was a kid I level up my mom's stove and I can remember Vapors coming off of stuff she was cooking it would just come up and poof and it's gone it was it was just not much more than a couple of seconds at most now that's what the Bible Likens Our Lives to like a vapor God knows there's way far more than what this life gives so they would throw it out all together but but it wasn't simply that God was I actually was going to show his glory but he was going to once and for all prove to the Egyptians and those that heard around that God set apart the difference between the Egyptians and the Israelites God's making sure that they know there's a difference between you and them and see that's what a lot of Christian World wants you to think today that we're just all the same friend we're not all the same and that's not arrogance that's just truth God sets his people aside from the rest of the world that's why you look different sound different act different that's why we're different all together because we're separate from the world amen we're not ashamed of Our Testimony we're not ashamed of Jesus Christ we want the world to know who we are amen I speaking to the Lord this morning I said God I just want to be able to work for you I said I want I want those guys on my crew to understand why I am the way I am yeah why I talk the way I talk why I don't do some things that they do why I work the way that I work because it's not for them it's for you I'm not like them I want them to become like me but I'm not like we're not like the world we're not a part of the world God purposely caused this to separate the Hebrews from the Israelites or the Egyptians from the Israelites once and for all and that's what this is about amen this sets them apart from the world it set them apart from everyone else that they belong to God your life sets you apart from everything else from everybody else because you're different because you belong to him you're part of his family and he wants the world to know it amen and they might not understand it but they know that there's something different and as long as you have time like I have to let people know well this is why I do this this is why I don't do this this is why I act this this why uh I'm like this because this is who I am I'm here to honor and to represent my Lord and Savior I want my life to rest to reflect him that sets you apart and more so every day that this that that clock ticks every second that clock ticks back you are more dislike unlike the world every day yeah yeah amen every day every second that ticks on that clock you're more different now than you were when you walked in this building this morning from the world that's how vastly quickly the world's changing and devolving amen not evolving devolving amen but this this is setting them apart amen and God tells them you go read the rest of the story God tells them this is going to be that that sets you apart this is the time that they'll know amen that you have been called you're not a part of them see because they lived there for 400 years they let the the Israelites say the Hebrews they lived in Egypt for over 400 years our friend you live in a place 400 years it's easy to to start doing their customs and things like that become a part of their economy and such but God wanted them to know you are not like them you're not all parts and we're in this world we're just not of this world amen we we account we uh assimilate to the world and the fact that we operate here we go to restaurants and supermarkets and have jobs and we trade money for goods and things like that we assimilate but we're not of the world we're not like the world amen this is God separating them setting them apart amen again go read you consume for yourself and the Lord's speaking to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it was April which we know April was the beginning of their calendar the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take of them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house amen which signify now we can go and it says and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of Souls every man according to his eating shall make your account for the lamb now each each home each family even with the neighbors one lamb was sufficient for the whole family one lamb you didn't have to kill a bunch but one lamb was sufficient for the whole family and says let me tell you one sacrificial innocent lamb Jesus Christ was sufficient for the entire family of God it only took one you don't have to have more people try to go crucify themselves or people crucify them it only took one one lamb for the entire family of God is all it took amen and they took it now let's keep reading your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or the goats and ye shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening time now notice it was taken out on the 10th day and it was kept up till the 14th day that gives four days for this lamb to be tested to make ensure that there's no impediments that there's that there's no scars there's nothing wrong with this lamb that was about to be sacrificed it had to be without blemish had to be pure for four days they made sure that that lamb was sufficient to meet the requirements for the sacrifice that's God's requirements under the law that was God's requirements now Jesus Christ Ministry was three and a half years almost four years that Jesus Christ was before the public his life being tested people ridiculing him making fun of him wanting to kill him everything they did to Jesus he was tested he was tried he was tempted above every temptation to make sure that they found that this ultimate sacrifice of ours was pure was without blemish was holy and Jesus Christ meant that criteria he met the criteria even being bombarded with every Temptation that a human could face whatever Jesus went through in life he overcame and the three and a half years almost four years of his ministry proved that this lamb was sufficient for the sacrifice he was able to meet that sacrifice amen and that sacrifice now was to be killed in the evening time just like Christ was amen and remember the evening time light is the light that we live in today amen the evening time light excuse me but the evening time light began at Jesus death because remember when Peter came out on the day of Pentecost he said this what you have witnessed is that that was prophesied by Joel that in the last days what is the last days that's the evening time that's the end of it in the last days you will see my spirit poured out upon All Flesh and what you're witnessing is that fulfillment of that scripture in the last days that evening time light now for the Gentile that began the Gentiles birth right there amen and now as the Gentiles go we are living in an end time light our income light is right now for the Gentile the time at hand was at the evening time in the last days remember a thousand years is one day with the Lord So when you say that Peter said in the last days of quoting Joel that's exactly right yeah yeah one day is a thousand years two days two thousand years and what's it been approximately two thousand years days plural these last days amen now that Spirit was bound it was loosed on the day of Pentecost and the spirit moved among the people and began to cause people to come to Christ and to become Christians but you'll notice something happened we'll get to in just a minute but let me read let me read some more of this and then we'll we'll go to that because I want to change over scriptures but I want to do it after we have finished this amen so keep in your mind that evening time light there was to be killed in the evening time look and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts on the upper door post of the house wherein they shall eat it notice they were not only to take the lamb and kill it but they were to ingest it they were to eat it they were they were to allow this sacrifice to come in them so that that sacrifice became a part of them we all know you are what you eat I mean I've heard that all my life every time I put a ding dong in my mouth you are what you eat so it actually is true you you become what you ingest God told them in just this eat it just like he told John eat the book amen foreshadowing praise God you see foreshadowing what God was going to go was going to do down the road as God continued to uphold himself oh it's so beautiful thanks we just see God told him to eat now before he never told them that when when it doesn't say anything about Abel eating his sacrifice doesn't say anything about Adam when they offer doesn't say anything about Jesus he just gave them the sheepskin but here he tells them the Passover the Paschal Lamb Passover our communion to eat it praise God that's why we are taking a representation at the communion table a representation of the body of Jesus Christ to take it into ourselves as a symbol that we've taken on his word we've ingested we've taken in Christ he's become our life he is who we are now amen it's just simple Saints look they were to eat it ingest this lamb become a part of it they were to put the blood on the doorposts The Little Disciples the top post what did that do for them anybody that walked by the house and saw that blood knew who they were they were identified by the Sacrifice by the blood the blood identified that that house stood for God that they were Hebrews that they were Believers that blood stood for behind that door belongs God's Property and anybody that walked by could see it they could recognize it oh that's blood that'd probably make fun of it laugh at it put it down a bunch of idiots or Hypocrites whatever they want to call and do the same thing today they look at you how silly how stupid why would you look like that why would you dress like that amen and do the same thing today you identified it's identifying because see your token today must be on display just as their token was on display their token was on display I identified whoever's behind that door now if you aren't behind that door you were you were a pro a product of the curse what was the curse death the only place death did not strike was behind the blood as the only place death did not touch right the only place death that could not reach was behind that token it's the only place he couldn't get to everybody behind that token was safe praise the Lord everybody that was that had the identification of that blood was saved even the firstborn because notice the firstborn the firstborn curse wasn't just for the Egyptians it was just a curse yes amen it was just a curse look at it today's things look at the curses that's hitting the world today are you a part of them absolutely not why because you had the inoculation you're behind the blood you have the Holy Spirit you have the life of God Christ Living in you you've been inoculated from whatever going to happen in this world well they were too the curse was for all of them but God separated them by putting them behind the token by putting them behind the blood amen now the rest of them can make fun and laugh at them but that's the only place where the death did not strike amen oh praise God Saint you see it that's where God that's no wonder Brothers could say if you've been inoculated you don't have to worry about these things that the father hit this Earth people word to death about this that and the other friends if you are inoculated the Holy Ghost you've been born again you are exempt from the things it's about to hit this world amen God has set you aside he has brought you out and showed that you are different that you belong to him that you are a part of the family of God and your token is on display and people may laugh at you make fun of you think how silly you are but that's the only place that death won't strike amen now physical death May strike your body oh absolutely but we're talking about a spiritual death amen because when you enter from the physical into the spiritual that identifies Who You Are because you are not spiritually dead you are where Spirit lives you are the world's looking for Revival I steer here today after that school and and that's wonderful I'm glad it will happen at that school that was just tremendous uh it ended and I I see there's a new Jesus movie and whatever there's been several of them that's wonderful anybody that can learn about Jesus that is great uh but there's there's only one thing that sets God's family apart from the rest of the world and that's the blood that's the life that's the spirit that Holy Spirit that has come back and live in you amen it's the only thing that separates you remember the only thing that separated the wise version from the foolish virgin was oil amen the oil in their lamps that kept them burning was the only thing that differentiated the two of them God's setting them apart again here saving them apart helping them to see they're separate from the rest of the world Age first they shall eat in the flesh that uh that night they shall eat at the eat of the Flesh in that night roast with fire unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor sought it all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with his pertinence thereof in fact nothing goes to waste nothing was to be wasted head legs pertinence everything in the middle the hand the legs and everything in the middle faces what it's saying and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remain into the morning ye shall burn with fire this while we have the remaining of the communion bread burned Amen brother Pat unfortunately it has that big fire pit that he has he takes and does that for us praise the Lord and thankful for it uh to burn amen and thus shall ye eat in it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and you're stabbed in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover always ready Always In Action always eat it ready to move partake of it ready to be in action for the Lord ready to do for the Lord what he would have us do now notice they ate this before I go to this last one uh because oh boy there's two more points I want to make before we get to that they ate one lamb was sufficient for the whole house but there was to be no waste noticed there was to be no waste anything that happened to be left over because it was supposed to take a lamb according to the number of people and that person's appetite you notice what they said when he read it according to each person's eating see every man according to his eating shall you make account for the lamb amen I I know a lot of times when I'm in big big group of people we order a pizza with so how many pieces will you eat I'll eat one oh I'll eat five oh I'll eat two and what do you do you say five four two one you add it up so okay it should take two pizzas it's that simple each man according to their appetite or eating so that there was to be no waste amen there was to be no waste and every bit of that sacrifice was to be was to be consumed now if there was any of it that was left over it was to be burned by fire remember now notice as we get to this it had to be an innocent lamb I'm going to do the uh we'll do the evening time in just a minute um actually I may just have to do that next time um well let's go over to uh uh Matthew let's go to the Book of Matthew and notice the sacrifice was kept up this would be the last part I get to today the sacrifice had to be kept up for four days you may remember Jesus Christ his ministry three and a half years tested tried proven the Bible says tempted above all temptation does it not say that amen Jesus tested that lamb that perfect sacrifice was tested and tried and at the end of his life we have Matthew 27. let's look at the witnesses at the end of his life now I am not going to give you a witness of any of the 11 just leftover disciples but a people that weren't even Jews really except for one believers his disciples look at the witnesses let's go Matthew 27 uh let's start with verses three or four all of them are in Matthew 27. all of the things I want to witness to you here about Jesus Christ in Matthew 27 3 and 4 Judas is carry it then Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying I have sinned and that I have betrayed the innocent blood innocent blood and they said what is that to us see thou to it now he was at one time of course one of the Twelve Disciples he was there with them justification sanctification he was there when they went forth to heal the sick and to raise the dead and and the Miracles that took place he was he was the one when God Matthew 10 God gave him power to go forth and do he was one right there but we know he sold his he sold Christ out and what did he identify now to them of course they couldn't care less it didn't mean anything to them that that he was innocent or not because they had already judged him and according to their judgment he was guilty but Judas last judgment of Jesus Christ was innocent blood I have betrayed innocent blood now let's look on down in Saint 27 19. Matthew 27 19. when he was set down on the on the Judgment seat Pilate his wife sent unto him saying have nothing to do with that just man and this woman didn't even know him but she was warned in a dream God spoke to it in a dream she went to her husband and said pilate don't you dare have anything to do with this just man notice where's the testimony coming from it's not coming from the high priest it's not even coming from Peter or or Bartholomew it's not even coming from his disciples it's coming from the life of the man that was about to sentence him to death have nothing to do with this innocent man again the testimony this man is an innocent man amen have nothing to do with this just man I've suffered many things this day in a dream because of now look what pilate said verse 24. when pilate saw that he could Prevail nothing but that rather a torment or a uproar uh sort of like or peaceful protests are today an uproar uh uh was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person see you do it now not only from Judas then Pilot's Wife now Pilate is calling this a this man a just person what are they doing with their own voices they're justifying Jesus Christ the innocent lamb the Paschal Lamb as the sacrifice that he was about to become this man's innocent this man is just this man had done nothing wrong amen just like he was supposed to be four years now the land was kept up three and a half years Jesus with his ministry before the people made sure he was in a minute I got one more amen and these aren't the other ones but these are the ones that are in Matthew 27 54. Matthew chapter uh word 27 verse 54. now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saved truly this was the the Son of God right amen truly this was the son of God identifying him as to who he was as to who he is amen innocent Jesus Christ just Jesus Christ able to be that sacrifice no wonder when John was looking around with a book that was sealed up and said who is able to loose the seals Jesus Christ the only one able to walk forth and take that book and loose those seals and open the book amen because nobody else is Worthy he was found worthy even by his enemies he was found no not the high priest and the the the the the Jews and the chief priests not them no amen but by Romans people that weren't even Jews see I didn't consider The High Priestess in but they were Jews and Jesus said I've been sent to the house of the of the Israelites I've been sent to the family of God I've been sent to the Jews The House of the children of the House of Israel that's where I've been sent Jesus said that himself but his enemies the Romans came forward this man is innocent this man is just surely this man is the son of God proving still Jesus Christ held up is our sacrifice innocent now Lord Willard uh I want to get to this evening part-time because I I'll be honest with you I never uh not that I've lied to you but I'm gonna stop that catchphrase uh to embellish um I didn't understand it for a long time when brother Branham talked about the the the the Holy Spirit not coming until the evening time but I want to talk to you about that so next time Lord willing let's stand if we could we get to the identification of that Paschal Lamb now when it was killed at the evening time the significance of that and what it means to us today the significance of what it means for us today amen aren't you glad Jesus Christ lived a perfect life above reproach without spot wrinkle or blemish amen people want us to to live that way friends we're human we were born of procreation Jesus Christ was the blood of God amen people look and say oh you know he made a mistake well don't we all make mistakes amen don't we all do things we regret don't we all say things that we know later we probably shouldn't have said amen vote we think thank God that his blood his grace covers amen not only covers now but annihilates amen when it drops in that seal for beautifulness it can never even be remembered anymore it does not exist praise that's what Justified means is it though you've never done it in the first place Amen in the eyes of God Justified you never did it praise the Lord Jesus amen listening this course if I can find it here oh the blood of Jesus we probably know it anyway I like
