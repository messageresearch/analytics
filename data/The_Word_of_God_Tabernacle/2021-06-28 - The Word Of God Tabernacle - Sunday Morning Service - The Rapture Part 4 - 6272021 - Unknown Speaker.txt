accident and i was a couple minutes behind my parents i knew they were about to turn into longhorn and then i saw the emergency the eagles was like and i didn't really think it was then but it just kind of brings to your mind how close something like that could have been yeah then being either a couple seconds earlier a couple seconds late what could have happened just thinking for keeping us all safe daddies also thank zach and that's for exactly myself what we do here and i want to thank the lord for what he does here because half of the time um some of these songs uh i don't play much or i've never played at all um and i go back and listen to recordings and i don't remember playing some of the stuff i play there's certain things i do or certain chords like it's not me so it's it's not me here's that it's the lord and i hope this is a blessing to you [Music] we were seated at a table and garments pure and white and a table stretch for a [Music] there was bread and wine before us like he said that there would be this must be the marriage supper of god's family right beside me was a brother that had given up his life for the gospel he had preached [Music] then i thought about my loved ones so many times i tried to tell but they never seemed to listen could it be they're bound for hell as the tears [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] i saw jesus and the tears [Music]

thank you and brother let's turn to song number 604 here you try this uh song it's been a while since it's so good here but and one thing i do ask as well uh just to keep my wives to prepare as well just the devil seems to try to attack her all the time with you know just physical things and um she has an appointment on wednesday for something else that's going on the private issue that she

jesus [Music] glory amen praise the lord jesus you believe that today yes amen should always be our number one focus he should always be our number one reason purpose everything about it amen in our whole lives is about him you know the bible says we put him first that everything else in life will be added too yes amen everything else takes care of itself we put him first you know it seems like we try to work at that backwards so many times we try to fix all the stuff and and we leave jesus out of it sometimes but you know if we just put him first he'll take care of all the rest not that we don't believe not that we don't have faith or not that we don't have a part to do because we do right but through us the lord will work with all of us amen it'll be just a miracle you see amazing how god puts all those things just in place amen brings healing and blessing and answers questions and heals the depressed and all the things that lord does just put him first you're right amen praise the lord i appreciate what micah said and and it is true and and i just i like uh i believe in penny roses on uh people now right and i very much do appreciate uh what uh what him and uh brother zach do and their efforts here and and it's just like me standing here before you today it's all him right as none of us can acclaim to anything it's all about him and it's all him he's the one who does it all but he does look for willing subjects very amen he does look for those who are willing to do it amen i just uh i'm just thankful that the lord that i'm a willing subject i thank god that we're willing subjects of his and whatever he wants us to do uh whatever he's called us to whatever purpose he's put before us right we're willing to do it amen amen willing to do whatever his perfect will would be for us in life amen so god bless you so thankful to be here today and welcome to the house of the lord welcome you if you're streaming today i know we have a few people out different sicknesses and things going on sister lydia's not here her daughter and uh them are moving today so she's taking care of the children and sister shelia and of course she got the prayer requests with sister shariah in her back and um and of course tabitha and brother dennis and but the lord is here right and that's what matters the most amen it's funny because um you know zach mentioned and quoted the scripture where two or three are gathered in his name there he is in the midst you hardly ever hear that quoted when there's 500 people in attendance or when there's even 50 or 100 you hardly ever hear anybody say that but when it's uh even when we have a full house you already ever hear but it's true either way amen because you can have a whole room full of people and only two or three that are there in his name right amen amen that's the truth praise the lord not necessarily here but just you know places churches say they're of the lord you know they you come in the name of the lord that's the whole point amen people come to church all the time but he said if you come in my name amen not the name of the denomination not in the name of a message not the name of a prophet but in jesus name amen amen praise the lord that's that's what changes it all amen praise the lord now uh sister kathy uh wanted us to have prayer for her she wanted us to lay hands on her and uh anoint her with all so i'm gonna ask her to go ahead and come up now if she would amen the lord woke me up this morning and reminded me sister norma to put this in my bible because we seldom do this anymore but i do have the anointing oil and she wanted to specifically ask that we do that so i'm thankful the lord reminded me to put it in my bible this morning so amen so we'll remember sister kathy's just needing a touch from the lord and moved upon her of course you heard her request for a daughter amen so you have a a faithful witness it meant for her today so we're going to pray together for a minute as her mother of course lays hands forward too lord jesus father we're here today calling on the precious name of jesus once again for our precious sister lord who is as you know the lord has rededicated her life and given her life into your hands and trusting you for leadership guidance and direction and lord she's coming up father desiring to fulfill the scripture lord that if we anoint those with oil and lay hands on them that they will recover lord and god that recovery is can mean so many things depending on the situation of life so many times we think it's sickness in body and certainly our sister needs a touch from you and her body lord but so many things in our lives god that we need to touch from you for lord and she's asking for that right now she's believing in prayer god and as your hand or mother has hands later as i do as we stand here abiding by your word lord and binding our faith together that lord you would move upon her life even now father deliver her strengthen her bless her lead her guide her help her in every way god that your perfect will would be manifested in her life may your holy spirit show itself real to her lord that she would know the direction that you would have her to go lord bless your family bless your daughter god again i lift her up before you katrina god that you would touch her now lord it's your hand of mercy and beat upon her and her family and lord all that you do for them god we just commit her to you lord now satan you have lost this battle for many years you've tried to take this sister but we rebuke you in the name of jesus christ and you have absolutely no control no authority over her now do you be all the praise honor in the glory lord jesus for the victory that is wrought through our sister now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord amen so thankful that the lord is mindful of us amen so thankful that he's here with us we just obey his scripture follow his word do his bidding what he calls he'll do the rest amen praise the lord i was more than honored as they asked if i would pray and lay hands on her today that i was more than honored to do so and and i know as you come before the church humbly you know sometimes it takes courage to come before a group of people and acknowledge that you need prayer in that way and uh i believe god will honor that yeah amen god will honor that praise the lord so amen god bless you today let's stand to our feet if we could amen turn over to the scripture that we've been going to first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. let's read this portion of scripture again as we continue on with the rapture and then this will be part number four amen let's bow our heads before we read the word if we could for word of prayer lord jesus we're certainly grateful lord again once uh once again today lord for this time of fellowship to come in and out of the world lord that to meet with you father in this little place that you've set aside and lord consecrated for us lord to be here together expecting you to meet with us lord as you always do we thank you god that your word is still true that you are still the same yesterday today and forever and as you sweep through this place and come down in power and manifestation of your spirit lord to touch every heart and life to move upon every request and every deed and to bless and strengthen each one of us here lord today those who may be streaming lord whatever the circumstance and situation is may you speak to us afresh from your word lord as we break forth the bread of life god may you just uh reveal it to us lord and let it be a become a part of our lives today and draw closer to you by it lord we are nothing without you father and acknowledge you in everything and all things and trust you in all things and pray that you get the glory honor and praise for it all we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to infiltrate hurt or hinder this service in any way god that you get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done for we do it in the name of the lord our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so then which uh also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore cover one another with these words thank you thank you amen you can be seated if you'd like amen i'm i'm gonna take a little um i'm gonna take a little sidebar today um from last week's message and some resulting uh question and things that came to me during the week and so the message today isn't going to be focused specifically on the rapture uh i know last week that we talked about it and it had been on my heart to bring a different facet of this but uh lord willie will do that next week if lord would terry but i felt inspired and necessary to try to delve into this a little bit deeper i hit the surface of it last week thinking maybe that would be sufficient for for what i would need to say and it it just came to me that it wasn't so i want to take a little bit deeper dive there's probably going to be a lot of things which you know most of us know anyway we're seasoned christians veterans of the lord been in the message most of the time most of us many years many of the things we know but the lord unfolded some things to me that i want to share with you and that i want to just trust it be a blessing to you and it's going to pertain to the rapture because remember last week one of my main focuses was those that are going in the rapture those that are going in this scriptural rapture that we're talking about that we just read about this rapture right here we know there's been other raptures we know there's been other resurrections and we'll get into that later but we know that this one that we read every time that we come for this end of service for this subject is for the bride of jesus christ only now of course we know and i mentioned last week that and before many times i've said this that we know that that bride is not just for this church age it's not just for this uh time period it's for from the very first church age from acts 2 on down to today every one of those that live to their message amen maybe you know brother brown said that uh i could have brought that quote but i did but he said that lived to their message that lived to the word for their day for their time for each one of those from from paul and irenaeus and martin and luther and columba and all down to brother branham each one that lived at their message to live that word for their day was considered and and with the holy spirit the bride of jesus christ for that day right amen which is all a part of the mystical body of jesus christ uh each one individually makes up that entirety of the body just like the bride internationally today makes up the entirety of the body now there may be people born there may be people died in the past 50 years 60 years since brother brown's gone that was bright thank god i believe i'm one of those that were born uh that was a part of that there's been many that's gone on but that doesn't change the fact of the body because those that have gone on before and those that are alive and remain are still all a part of this same body amen brother bam talked about from that first church age and how it began how it started and those that followed that message are the ones that that entered in amen we know on the day of pentecost when when peter gave a 15-minute sermon there were 3 000 souls added to the church that day at one time in one sitting three thousand i think well that's a lot it's amazing how sometimes i was thinking of that this morning we had a nice ministers meeting uh yesterday it was really good in phoenix i felt it was of the lord felt the spirit of the lord there thought it was very good um you know there's always you know things maybe you'd do different or change a little bit but it was it was good really was uh but it's amazing how uh especially ministers we we kind of like to throw in there the brother branham said one in a million and you know that is true i believe that brother brown said that brought a whole message one in a million one in a million and we'd like to throw that one in a million until until it comes time for our congregation then you know we won't we want a million in our church but you see it's only one in a million until it comes to the church you think well why aren't there more people well you know it's one in a million right so that's the way it is but we know that down but we know that doubt that one in a million down through the church ages god is called people and and the part i want us to see is that each one that saw the word for their day that lived the word for their day that followed the message that was sent to them they are the ones that become bride they are the ones that are considered bride god filled them with the holy spirit revealed his word to them and they passed on and they will resurrect and we would be changed and go to the lord and go and meet the lord in the air that's our rapture now the point i want to get across the point i want to get to today because because of what i said last week is that i believe that only the people that that are considered bride for this last day will hear this message right they will believe this message and it will be a part of their lives they will be filled with the holy ghost and this message will what will be their portion the word because it's the word that changes right it's the word that uh that brings life because it's christ christ is the word i've told you many times people say the message message message and they say message like it's some kind of a separate entity well friend the message is not a separate entity it's just christ the message has been the message since the first church age it's been the message no doubt now brother branham had a different calling and a different placement in that body to bring something to the bride for this last day just like uh uh just like wesley had something for the philadelphia church age just like luther had something for his church age and columba and on down see each one had their message but the message is jesus christ the word amen amen without this word without this there would never have been this amen right without this bible the word there never could be a message because this came from this right so it's all christ and we can't forget that yeah it's we can't people would try to separate it as a separate entity when it's not amen right it is jesus christ see and if that word has come to call a bride out of a church age as he called a a a a a a people out of a people as we read last week moses calling the people out of a people then there's got to be a people that is going to uh hear this word live this word and become this word so based on the fact that and i don't believe i'm far faced in my understanding that the the people that will be in this rapture will live to their message now there's a crossover period from wesley to this church age from philadelphia to laosea there's a change over there was people that were born under philadelphia lived under philadelphia even when brother adam came on the scene if they were a part of that god attributes that to them then that'll be their abortion amen now in this last day now that we have no excuse because it's been going for over a hundred years and and it is still going but it's still christ because he's still the same yesterday today and forever if you believe that and live to that that and fill the holy spirit that's that person that that's what i believe considered to be the pride and again i don't i don't think that's a stretch i really don't because that's the word that's what changes you yeah right amen not a denominational word not the word of some man or pro or a pastor or something but the word of god right the word of god the message of the hour now the only way that we can know christ is by revelation right we know that brother graham says that and uh i believe it's christ the mystery of god revealed we went over that with four five six services that the only way to know jesus is by revelation you can't know him by the letter of this word you can't know him by the letter of this word you can only know him by the revelation of the word as it speaks back to you amen amen by hearing amen so that knowing jesus christ is to know him by the word and there's but by revelation of that word because there's many many parts of this scripture now uh follow me many parts of this scripture because we know the bible was written i'm trying to take my time and not get too far ahead but there's a lot i have a lot of scripture i want to read so if you're watching uh have your bibles closed if you're here have your bibles close i have several scriptures i want to read but i don't want to rush this amen so we know that the bible was written by men filled with the holy ghost inspired by the holy ghost amen inspired by god they were men led of god to write what's in this bible yeah we know that that being so we know that there's many many parts of this scripture that were purposely written so they could not be figured out there's many many parts of the description now there's some parts of it you can read and you can put a together with b and 2 and 2 is 4 and you can add it all up and you can say this equals this this but there's many parts of scripture this is where a lot of people get off right and a lot of i'm sorry but a lot of churches and christians just don't believe that you have to have a revelation to gain uh an understanding of the scripture right they just think that you can read it uh and gain knowledge from it and say well the bible says this yes it does say that but what about the revelation of what the word is saying to you amen amen i'm gonna read some things and get into some scripture to help with this but there's many part the the thing to understand here there's many many parts of the scripture that were purposely written by god to not be able to be understood a human by intellect by knowledge by reading you'll never get it it won't come that way it cannot and does not come that way yes amen it has to come by inspiration it has to come by revelation that being said i want to read another scripture to solidify this second timothy chapter 3 2 timothy chapter 3. i want to begin reading with verse 16. now there's actually being that that many parts of the scripture were written purposely not to be understood even brother branham said god will allow me to say things just to throw people off you know that yes he said god will allow him to say things and you'll look and say oh my goodness where did he come up with that well i'm sure they thought the same thing in john 6 when jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in me they're probably standing there thinking my goodness where did he come up with that amen it was purposely put there just to throw them off amen because only the predestined are the ones that are going to see this and have it revealed those that are born again and filled with the holy ghost the only ones that are going to gain the revelation of what it's saying what god is speaking to you the word speaking back don't mean to tell you that that meant a lot to me when the lord showed that to me the other day amen now uh second timothy uh chapter 3 verse 16. all scripture all scripture not part of it not just the new testament not just a word here there all scripture is given by inspiration of god amen that inspiration what is that inspiration that inspiration is a revelation right god inspires it to you what is that inspiration that inspiration is god opens that word so you can see it how many times brother random called this a love letter from christ to the church a love letter what is a love letter you write things he had an example he mentioned about his wife and you know he said he's out of town and he gets a love letter of course today it would be a text or or an email or something like that a lot just put the kids to bed i'm lying in bed and i'm really missing you now and he says you know she's saying this but i know what she means because i'm her husband she's my spouse she's my wife i know what she means she's not saying it right out directly but i know what she's saying because remember you talked about reading between the lines well but in between the lines is matching what's on the line amen right right so that's the love letter that god has wrote to us see people can look at it and say well it says this and i'm not trying to get into a part of saying yep you know but it uh you know but what did he mean i don't want to assume that but i do want to understand that there's a revelation that comes from the word that you don't see in the letter of the word and that's the holy spirit that's the spirit of god remember the bible is not this book this is just ink on a paper the bible is jesus christ a living risen savior that's the word amen this is just ink on pages this is just a part of brother bram said just a part of god that he put so we can see it that it could be revealed to us amen so that spirit could come in so that revelation could come in it's because of the ink on the pages praise the lord but it's just the word and all the word is given to you i don't mean to add to the scripture but it's given to you by inspiration of god so it takes god to do it many seminaries you want to right you can become the most educated brilliant genius in the planet earth but unless god inspires it you'll never see it right yeah you'll never see it oh what she said he missed she misses it oh she misses and that's nice no that's not what the that's not what the letter meant the letter d yeah she misses him but it goes so much deeper than that because there's a relationship praise the lord there's a relationship i wanted to talk about that relationship today but anyway there's a relationship there when there is you know what is it speaking to me all the scriptures given by inspiration of god it is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works thoroughly furnished finished that's completed through what the inspiration or revelation of the word amen that's when it that's when a completion comes the man of god may be perfect well the man is just a general uh uh you've heard me say many times just a man is in humanity not just a man amen i'm looking at many sisters here this morning and it's the same thing with you not just man but humanity that's what he stole the humanity come to a place of perfection how by the inspiration of god's word by the revelation of god's word we are made complete and that's what that perfect means a full age complete you've reached a place of wanting nothing amen amen maturity that perfect thoroughly furnished to all good works thirdly furnished means you have all that you need now you know maybe if you're a millionaire or something you might have a house full of furniture and you still want a piece of furniture or something you know you don't have a square inch of carpet to put it on because you got a bunch of money you got to go another you got to go not buy another pair of shoes you got to go and buy another dress you got to go buy another piece of furniture amen because you got all kinds of money so you got to spend it right but normally when you have a house full of furniture you don't go by more right you've got what you need why it's it's fully furnished it's complete you look at it you say it is complete amen i don't know if me and my wife's ever had a house like that before but we've tried in 36 years uh to have that i don't think we have to this point but maybe one day but fortunately spiritually i believe that's been attained amen by the word of god by the inspiration revelation of the word modern events made clear by prophecy you see the scripture is inspiration you'll never listen to what he says now you'll never be able to know the scripture just by sitting down and reading it from a theological standpoint right from an educational standpoint it will never work never has worked he says so i was speaking to a minister not long ago he said brother until we learned the greek and so forth he said all he said in the united state council before they were arguing the greek words in the bible he says you'll never know it the bible is to be revealed to be revealed by inspiration all scripture is given by inspiration from who not from me not from brother brown but from god yes amen doesn't i just it's just i love how beautifully god dovetails the things that we've just been talking about over the past few weeks amen all of it it just all comes from him it's not us god looks for willing subjects again that he can use to speak through but it's god that does it right amen it's god that brings it to fruition so it's him that's doing it the bible is to be revealed by inspiration that's the only thing the revelation jesus told peter upon this rock this revelation reveals who he is blessed art thou simon son of jonas flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and upon this rock i will build my church what rock not the catholic church not even peter but the rock of the revelation of who jesus christ is the revealed word inspired to you amen not peter himself but upon the spiritual revelation of who jesus is amen or he says was or was standing there amen that's spiritual revelation now as we know now there are many there are many parts of the bible that may look plain to people it may look plain as you read it but it really isn't because there's something in there that that without the inspiration not the holy ghost without god revealing it you'll never see it it won't be seen there's things in here i still have on the shelf lord i i don't understand that i don't understand why brother brown said this or i don't understand how this but god knows yes and if i have need of knowing or when i have knee of knowing he'll show to me as he's done many many times and i'm so thankful for that things that i've had such a quandary over for years sometimes years and one day they'll just drop it down for item for whatever reason i said well thank you lord there it is and then it just becomes plain it's not a mystery anymore it's the same words it's the exact same words in the bible and the word didn't change it's just the enlightenment of the holy spirit giving it to me amen there's your difference so many scriptures they they might look plain but they really aren't amen they really aren't there are several scriptures in the bible and many prophecies through the bible this is why we're to get to my text many prophecies through the bible that have uh that we talked about this a little bit again this is going to be a continuation of sort of what i laid last week or kind of skipped the highlights of i want to go a little deeper there's many parts many scriptures many prophecies in the scripture that have dual meanings they have compound meanings many scriptures let's turn to one matthew chapter 2. now remember you can't just read the word as as a a point of knowledge and i've said this before and i'll say it again and i don't know why but i just feel inspired to maybe somebody sitting here maybe somebody's watching maybe somebody will watch it and and you do what you feel that to do i'm not telling anybody what to do brother branham obviously endorsed the king james version of the bible he had a thompson change study i believe he did he had a scofield that he studied bible but i've had people tell me and again i'm not telling you what to do but i've had people tell me nobody here that they have to get this certain translation because they can't understand it they understand this translation better and i try to tell them without offending them the best i can i try to tell them look it would appear as though you're trying to read the bible to gain knowledge from it if you're doing that you're you're reading it for the wrong purpose you're reading it in the wrong way right the bible is not given to us to gain theological knowledge from it's not to enhance any doctrine the word is given to us to change us and to mold us and to make us in the image of the word which is christ to reveal it to us not something that you can have a knowledge that you can go argue down the street with somebody about it right right i'm not saying that that that we can't that you don't have bible studies or discuss this point or that one or something that's perfectly fine right but you can't garner that with just a simple knowledge so if you're if you think you've got to get a certain translation and you do whatever again you do whatever you feel like to do whoever you are that's fine but if you're but if you do it because i understand this one better there needs to be sounds to me there needs to be more of a prayer for an inspiration of the word not a knowledge of the word right now amen because if it's if it's necessary now none of us have it necessary but if it were necessary and you were a child of god and this book was written in swahili you could read it right amen god would reveal it to you anyway yes if there was a need if you had to and there was no other way to know it there was times back in the old uh uh dark ages they didn't have this scripture they didn't have this bible they didn't have the luxury we have to have this thing on print how did god get to those people amen if he had to do it you could read this no matter what language or what it looked like or how it was trying to be hidden god would still reveal it to you amen so you can say well this looks a little plainer and this makes more sense and whatever be careful you might find something in there that doesn't belong there that's right or or in your mind i should say everything that's in there belongs there but in your mind because oh i i understand it now no i know we use that verb which i use it too because it starts sometimes our limited uh english right just like we use the word love you go in the bible you see there's several loves right but we just use one word but anyway so it's got to come by revelation inspiration now again many parts of the scripture have dual purposes dual meanings uh matthew chapter 2 verse 13. let's read this and when they were departed of course tomorrow joseph and barry and jesus and when they were departed behold the angels of the lord appeared to joseph in the dream saying arise take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring thee word for herod for herod will seek the young child to destroy him when he rose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying by the prophet so this was a prophecy that god spoke through a prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son now if you look at that and you see it just as it's written you say oh well that's true if you're talking about jesus this whole thing is talking about this whole story is referring to joseph and mary and then jesus and then what what was happening to jesus that it would be a fulfillment of of that prophecy of of of him coming out of egypt see and then you just leave it there oh okay well praise the lord the scripture is talking about that's the fulfillment of that scripture out of egypt have i called my son but there's more to that scripture amen there's more to that scripture if you go to other scripture which we're going to do and i told you to keep your bible handy in exodus chapter 4. i want us to see this because some people don't believe that and i'm not saying it's anybody in this church it's not but there's some people i have talked to people i've witnessed to them they don't believe that there's a there are dual meanings to certain scriptures they think that that's exactly what it is and that's all it is they don't see the the compound meaning or the dual purpose of a prophecy sometimes or something that would clearly if you just read it by knowledge that's jesus got it done over you move on then you miss a whole nother part of what jesus was saying what the word is saying exodus chapter 4 verse 19. and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt for all the men are dead which sought by life and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return unto egypt see that thou do all these wonders before pharaoh which i have put in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not let the people go and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son even my firstborn and i say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even my first born now who's god talking about there again a prophecy again the lord speaking now what's he saying it's just like saying the bible says that god is jesus father but then when you read in the in the new testament when christ is born it says that he is of the holy ghost well now if you're a trinitarian and you believe in three separate entities god father son holy ghost and you got three of them up here orchestrating this whole deal and you say god is jesus father but now it says he's not the holy ghost well which one is it see without spiritual understanding and revelation of what the word is saying you wouldn't know without a true instruction of the godhead right you say well he said my father well there's got to be at least two of them see without spiritual understanding without a revelation of the entirety of god revealing that word to you all scripture is given by inspiration then you miss the thing entirely it doesn't make sense so how did the christian world reconcile it oh there's got to be three of them and then they make an excuse to say well god's his father but the bible says he's of the holy ghost you've made him an illegitimate child now he's got two daddies who's his daddy amen you see where the common knowledge misses the vision where a common understanding of the scripture can't catch the revelation of what the word is speaking to you about hear god is saved thus saith the lord israel is my son now was israel brought up out of egypt amen amen yes it was took them 400 plus years but they were delivered out of egypt now let me ask you is matthew 2 only talking about jesus no matthew 2 is not only talking about jesus it's also talking about how god raised up a prophet moses spoke to moses to bring a children of israel out of egypt and god spoke through moses and said this is my son but now that doesn't negate that jesus was as well you understand okay well let's go to the next one uh hosea 11 hosea 11 1. hosea 11 1 says when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out of egypt okay a prophecy went forth that his son would be called out of egypt well now is it israel his son or is it jesus his son see if you stop at one part you completely miss a whole another part of the scripture and there's so much more just behind that that we just don't have time to go into right now the purpose and the reason for that then you lose you lose a whole other section of the bible that you can't reconcile with the rest of the new testament because you don't know the understanding or revelation of what is saved you miss a whole half of the purpose of the prophecy that god gave to that prophet it's lost you don't even know it and a lot of people can't understand it today that's why it has to come by inspiration that's why it has to come by revelation brother branham gave nobody a revelation friend no one no one right amen amen nor could i for amen no matter how great an understanding of a scripture or of a doctrine you have you can't give it to anybody else right you can witness to them and try to lead them to christ but only god can bring that inspiration only god can reveal it amen only god can do it and to try to help people understand where we stand in this day see because we know now i'm going to get into this is the last part i want to get into today i've got several more scriptures i want to read but this is the last part i want to get to we we hit the highlights last week we know there's five times we can find it in the scripture you say well brother ryan said yes he did but you can find it in the scripture what he he said a lot of people can't find what he said in scripture because they don't know the scripture right and they say well it says hear this yeah but if you don't understand the rest of the inspiration then you can't get the full picture yeah amen okay i hope we got that now there's the the dual purpose it means many times of prophecies in scriptures five times use of the elijah spirit four are very plain in the scripture and remember much of the scripture is written so it won't be just seen and understood by the comet by knowledge or by theological understanding okay i want to delay that again four of them are pretty plain scriptural the fifth one is brought by inspiration to see where it's before it sits it's actually the fourth not the fifth but you know what i'm saying four of them uh the the first second third and fifth are pretty plain the fourth one is is uh is revealed to a people that will believe it for a message of this last day the first spirit the first fulfillment of that elijah spirit now now you got it you got to know your bible and you got to follow brother green said it many times uh but we got to follow their natures we we got to follow their uh uh their uh their natures the way of their acting and and the ways that they did things and the the desires the things they loved and the things they hated brother around brother greene he could rattle off the four or five things just like a a machine gun the spirit of elijah loved the wilderness had no uh desire for wealth or fame hated the jezebel spirit blah blah blah i don't remember them all to give them all but those things but to know the scripture you can follow their natures if you read the story of elijah and see how elijah was you could read the story of elisha and see how elisha was and say wow they they kind of married mirrored each other if you jump over to john the baptist you could say oh my he acted in his nature the way he conducted himself the things he said mirrored a lot of the way how elijah and elisha were why is that because they were of the same spirit that same spirit that same anointing amen a lot of people don't understand well how did how did the spirit come out of elijah and go into this man no it's not that it's not the man's literal spirit but it's that anointing that that uh that's that's on that person that made them who they were not the man's literal spirit but the nature of that person see i mean you can have that i mean how many in here like steak just me normal okay now that that doesn't mean my spirits came out of my body went into brother john over the pattern system norma amen or or my daughter or my mother it just means that we share that in common it's a part of the nature of the pace that we have that we enjoy amen uh how many in here like sushi i can't put my hand any lower than that amen but you will see that's my son obviously that didn't come out of me into him he's of that nature right i mean how many people like to hunt you don't have to raise your hands anymore i mean like to fish i mean like to golf how many like to drive fast cars how many like to uh uh work with their hands how many like to work with their brains how many uh i mean you could go on and on and on and understand the characteristics of each other that that doesn't that doesn't make mean that the spirit of one person can't that actual literal spirit came and went to that other person just means you're of that same type nature you have that same type of of of taste if you will right whatever it is sometimes it's because the way you're raised sometimes it's because of where you were raised sometimes it's absolutely opposite of where you were raised my mother hated ketchup almost because it was too hot i mean i don't i don't eat ketchup because it's not hot so did that how does that equate i'm her son but you understand that those natures those anointings that was on them was the same type of anointing it made them desire the same type things it made them dislike the same type things they were wilderness men and what other wilderness man do we know that didn't have a desire for wealth or fame that didn't uh that hated the jezebel spirit they loved the wilderness and so forth you've got to follow that trend you've got to know the scripture to follow those natures and see the fulfillment of that scripture something is going to fulfill that scripture because all scripture is given by inspiration all scripture will be fulfilled we know that just by what the scripture tells us okay so the first one is very plain elijah elijah was the original prophet standard barrier that we look at of that nature type of person elijah was the man he was the first one he got raptured he threw back his mantle to a man that asked god through elijah he wanted a double portion of that same what spirit that same anointing elijah threw his mantle down he didn't remove the spirit from his body and throw it down to it into his mantle down the anointing transferred over to elisha and elisha then was the same type man did the same type things as elijah did right fulfilling that second double portion or that second uh spirit of elijah that wasn't a man the third was john the baptist i want to read some scripture in isaiah chapter 40 that's the first place i want to go isaiah chapter 40. you can look at john the baptist again see his nature we talked about him last week he'd go in the wilderness and god would speak to him he'd come out like a wild man beard hanging down animal skins on him and wild locusts and honey and scream and repent baptizing them pointing to jesus all the things that john did nail in the height of the pharisees and sadducees to the wall the men that were learned men how could john the baptist out do them in in scripture when their whole life was wound in scripture and this man just spent his life in the woods how could that be they knew the letter they could take the torah and they could the scroll they could put it in a circle and put a pen through it and knew exactly where it get what it said they knew it that well but where did they know it they knew it up here amen they knew it as a knowledge oh i know what that says i know what that but when john the baptist came out even when jesus came they said oh this nobody spake like this man before well where did he get it from he was 12 years old and could and could confound the professors where did it come from well first of all he was the word amen but it's all inspired revealed by god a man could come out of the woods and do the exact same thing a man could raise up with a seventh grade education and do the same thing and he did it he confounded the professors he confounded the theologians many of them probably still had their same ideas but they couldn't even that challenge that he gave them when they tried to lay a trap for him about baptism and god showed him what they were going to do and they changed the room and god changed them program said it's like this like this like this and he said oh we got him now because we got this room so and so and such and such and right before they were to go to heaven they had to change the room he said oh sorry we have booked this we got to put you in a different room the room was exactly like god and show brother adam it was going to be and brother brown said now any one of you and you know all the things that he said he said now any one of you want to challenge me get your bibles and stand right next to me here and prove me where i'm wrong a man with a seventh grade education he said prove me when i'm wrong pastors teachers theologians couldn't do it they stayed quiet because they knew better amen how could that be done by inspiration by revelation of god right now wild man coming out look isaiah chapter 40 verse verse 3 isaiah 43 the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exalted every mountain and hill shall be made low the crooked shall be made straight and the rough place is plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it now this man this prophecy of a man's voice crying in the wilderness was to do what prepare the way of the lord to make the way straight to pave that way and talks about the hills being loaded in the rough places and smooth places but it was to pave that way it was to lay that foundation for when the first coming of christ was to come to make a way for the lord that was the point amen isn't that the point of that man's ministry whose ministry the ministry of the voice crying in the wilderness his ministry was to prepare the way of the lord and make straight that way amen lay that foundation that was what his ministry was to be malachi chapter 3 malachi chapter 3 verse 1. i i was going to wait for to turn but i'm gonna go ahead and go because it's getting a little bit late on me now uh malachi 3 1 behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts now who does that sound like sounds like isaiah 43 amen i'll send my messenger who is that messenger that's the message of the man of the voice crying in the wilderness who's going to prepare the way of the lord amen to make his way straight and prepare that way for the lord to suddenly come into that temple amen where he stood there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled praise the lord jesus but who is the messenger the man who's crying in the wilderness we're going to come back to malachi in matthew chapter 3 matthew chapter 3 let's see here matthew chapter 3 starting with verse 1. in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judea in the where wilderness of judea saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand for this is he who was spoken of by the prophet isaiah isaiah saying the voice of one or isaiah the voice of one crying at the wilderness preparing you the way of the lord make his path straight that's pretty plain right john the baptist john the baptist was that fulfillment of the messenger from isaiah 4 and 3. he is the fulfillment of that prophet of the voice crying in the wilderness of malachi 3 and 1 preparing the way of the lord making his way straight plain and simple because john the baptist forerunned the first coming of christ that fulfilled that scripture that let us know that that was the scripture that that god was referring to when he had uh a prophecy prophesied let's go back to malachi now malachi 4 because john we're not done with john quite yet malachi 4 and 6. malachi 4 6 says and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse now who is this he that he's talking about this he is the spirit of elijah right that same anointing that same spirit now if you just looked at that and you followed it up from malachi 3 it said well that's just john the baptist and you would stop because you'd see well that that that seems plain and simple that's john the baptist i see it that's it let's move on into the subject did you talk to them you would forget about it it's done that's john the baptist let's move on and that's what so many people do but see they miss the compound purpose of this scripture john the baptist was the beginning portion of of course he was the first forerunner of the first coming of christ of of christ coming with a change in dispensation from the old testament and the law to grace and the and the message going to the gentile bribe amen from the old law from the crossing of the hands we talked to last week the blessing right-hand blessing going to the younger child the gentile from the from uh from the time of christ and that changing of that dispensation john the baptist was that for that forerunner what was the purpose of that forerunner the purpose of that forerunner was to turn the hearts of the father to the children amen now look when my when my great-granddaddy was alive he didn't know me he didn't know my daddy he certainly would have never known my son because i never knew him but he was always my son was always in him right he didn't know him but he was there so he's looking forward why now the second part of this the heart of the children to their fathers now how could my great-grandfather have looked from him back he didn't even know him my great-grandfather didn't even know that my son would ever even exist so how could there be a ministry of bringing from forwards back the ministry when got when the when the ministry of christ came the dispensation changed from law to grace there was a looking forward to what christ was going to do in his church hallelujah amen it was a looking forward the the old testament states had already risen they had appeared unto many they had gone in the rapture amen and and that sealed that well what was there left to do the looking forward the looking forward was the message of elijah to look forward fathers to the children amen so that compound purpose of malachi 4 5 4 and 6 is the fulfillment of he elijah's spirit being in john the baptist and william branham because in this last days now you have a turning of the faith of the heart of the children back to the fathers they looked forward and we look back amen right not that we look back in the sense of looking back you understand what i mean but the restoration of that faith to our hearts from what it was in that day amen and i said well don't look back then don't read the bible because the bible's history that's right most of it is his history most of the bible is written and fulfilled hundreds thousands of years ago hundreds or thousands of years ago so if you don't want to look back in history then don't then don't read the bible but that's the whole point we now are looking back so that elijah spirit on john the baptist was looking forward from the apostolic fathers forward to the children through the church ages to the gentile bride that was going to raise up from every church age and then this last age was to look back and we'll get to that part because jesus said this and put both of them in perspective uh we read this last week matthew chapter 17 matthew chapter 17 verse 10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall that is going to come he shall come and restore all things now what did john the baptist restore nothing right he wasn't to restore anything he was the introducer he was the beginner he was the start of introducing jesus christ he wasn't restoring it if john the baptist was to restore anything it would be the old law he would he would throw and go back into the old testament and bring all that back up to restored jesus did that when he died at calvary jesus restored everything from the old testament by giving his life in calvary dying going to hell and emptying out paradise well what job was there for restoration of john to do there was no restoration but jesus said elijah is going to come he shall come and that elijah's going to restore all things but i say unto you that elias has come already and you knew him not now he's speaking to them not of elijah not of elisha but of john the baptist placing the scripture in its proper place now again if you just looked at that and read it with a theological knowledge you say oh he's talking about john the baptist oh elijah shall come restore all things elias has come already they understood you talked about john the baptist okay that's good seal gun finish and move on you missed the whole picture right you miss every you miss everything about revelation 10 7. you miss everything about luke 17 30. you missed everything about malachi 4 5 6. you missed everything that refers to the forthcoming of that elijah spirit you missed the whole thing if you don't see it by jesus referring to it you miss the whole thing if you if you just see that as john the baptist and it's sealed you forget it you go home you've missed the whole that whole dispensation it's gone to you that's right and if you only have john the baptist that spirit the four times and you you've you've you've thrown off the numerology of the word right five of course is grace and faith and jesus j-e-s-u-s and amen five is the number of grace right in the scripture said that that spirit used five times then you can catch it and you can see now every bit of it lines up every bit of it reveals itself jesus said elias will come and restore all things who is he talking about now this is our crossover from the third usage of that anointing to the fourth who was he talking about if he could not have scripturally been talking about john the baptist to restore anything then what was who was he talking about amen he had to be talking about somebody else and it had to be somebody else with the spirit of elijah right it could not have been the fifth use of the spirit of elijah in revelation 11 because those two men just come for the jews right and they did not do any restoration they just they're getting 144 000 together right that's all their purpose was and one of them was elijah moses and elijah which we could read time's getting away but it couldn't have been that so would so who is he talking about there's got to be a fourth to that spirit it's got to be a fourth one to fulfill that part of the bible amen malachi 4. let's go back to it again malachi 4 5 behold i will i will send you elijah the prophet amen well that's pretty generic already had two of them i will send you so if it's okay well then we'll just say it's john the baptist but now this prophet is going to come before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord now as isaiah 4 wielding his voice crying in the wilderness elijah was to make the past straight for jesus to appear amen that wasn't the great and dreadful day of the lord that was a wonderful time that jesus christ was here manifested on earth revealing himself to his people and manifesting himself in the power and manifestation of the spirit of god to go to calvary to die on a cross to shed his blood to redeem a whole generation of people a whole thousands of years of gen of people so what is this man now the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord even that itself has a two-fold understanding because the day we know that we're living is a great day amen do you consider today a great day i do i think today is a wonderful day this is this is a great day that we live in friend there's never been a time that christ has come and the word has been manifested and revealed and brought to a people for a body change and a rapture amen amen never been that kind of wholesale rapture like that before we're living in a blessed day but it's also a dreadful day yeah right amen and if you don't know it's dreadful just walk out on the street for five minutes and look at what's going on in this planet look at the garbage and the filth out in the parking lot i'm embarrassed almost to be a tucson now with all the garbage and trash all over this i've never seen tucson this bad in my life yeah the garbage and the trash and the debris everywhere everywhere it's just nasty i'm i'm embarrassed people to come in from i'm glad i'm on uber anymore for people that come in from out of state and look at the trash and the garbage all over the place it's it's embarrassing but you know today is a dreadful day why because there's a lot of people that aren't going to know what we know there's a lot of people that are going to be here left when the tribulation sets in and and it's not going to be a pretty picture yeah let me just put it that way so yes it is a great and dreadful day of the lord that forerunner who is that forerunner who was that elijah if it wasn't john the baptist because he didn't he didn't forerun a great and dreadful day of the lord he didn't restore anything but who did the restoration amen who was the one that brought that restoration malachi 4 5 behold uh before the coming of the dreaded great and dreadful dead lord he shall turn the hearts of the father to the children hearts of the children to the father lest i come and smite the earth with a curse jesus said again in matthew 17 that elias would come and restore all things because from the day of pentecost it all fell down through the dark ages went into the ground had to die and rot be resurrected and new to come forth into a new into a new group amen she's known as the bride through all church ages into this last day to restore back that's why this last day prophet was to come to restore all things to take everything not serpents see what brother branham's revelation or should i say original he's not the one that came up with serpent seed serpent seed was taught for thousands of years before brother branham was ever here amen i i mean in the new testament and and from the first church ace down people talked about the serpents see it wasn't something new it just took the gift of that prophet to know hey that is truth that is right that is scripture and restore it back to a to a people that the catholic church tore down and took away and it took the baptism in the name of jesus christ isn't new we know that it's all through the bible right all through the new testament they baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but of course it died out through niacin through the catholic church and father son of holy ghost so it took a prophet to reach out and said now that's the correct baptism oh but jesus said father son holy ghost oh that's right that's this amen this is the revelation of what jesus said see if you just took that scripture father son the holy ghost that's what people do okay that's what jesus said that's what baptized then what do you do with what peter said a man that just came out filled with the holy ghost what do you do with his statement amen amen he said be baptized in the name of jesus christ amen amen well now are you going to be baptized in the father son the holy ghost you can be baptized in the name of jesus christ where is god in the son and the holy ghost all one amen and his name is jesus amen praise the lord that's pretty simple then right but if you took it just at face value and you say well that's what it says you close it up done finished that's what it is that's how we move on now and then you miss a whole truth to a baptism amen of the truth of the baptism and a lot of people have read these scriptures and they have closed their bible and have moved on and they said okay this is the way it is amen and they miss christ they miss the word because their blindness to what they think is going to be amen just like we talked about israel was blinded god didn't come down and say okay i smite you blind no they were blinded because they were looking for them a different way they were looking at a different uh for a different in a different context or something how they look for jesus to come for their messiah to come they didn't look forward to coming on a manure pile they looked for him to come and say greg great circumstance where it was they looked at them and their eyes were blinded because they couldn't see past their own theology their eyes were blinded because they couldn't see past their own ideas oh friend we got to die to ourselves amen our ideas our opinions amen this is that great and dreadful day of the lord there had to be a prophet for this last day to restore to bring forth what was needed from the church ages to bring about in this last day through the inspiration revelation of the word a bride for a rapture a last day bribe right because the bible says that they are not complete without us amen they are not complete without us so where does that put us that puts us in the word for this last day in that restoration period now it's time that by faith for a body change revelation 11 is that fifth time you go to zechariah 2 and you see the two olive trees and talk about zechariah 2 the two olive trees are the same ones that come in revelation 11. those that are the olive tree referring to jews israel that was moses and elijah how do you know it's moses and elijah because the bible says shut up heaven and and did the miracles that moses and elijah did when they were here right amen the mystery i'm not completely sure about because i've read several quotes and brother branham actually says it two different ways where you would believe that he's saying it like they were the literal moses and elijah and then he says it in a way that it would lead you to believe that it was simply the anointing of those two men on two other prophets amen which i tend to believe right i tend to believe that part that that was not literally moses and elijah but that same anointing that's on those two prophets amen they also come in and they come in the scope of our message here uh with with the sixth rapture the third rapture of the new testament if you will amen so seeing that understanding that scripture by inspiration by revelation has to come or you'll never get it if it's not if that word doesn't come in by the holy spirit and speak back to you then you're not gonna it won't be there you won't get it amen it can't be it's got to be by revelation and you can see the word and it unfolds itself some people all they know is brother brown said brother branham said brother adam said that's all they know oh friend you mean to tell me that's all jesus is is what brother brown said amen amen thank you lord to me he's the living risen savior amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he was the one living in and through brother brown to bring this word to us and when god was finished with him he took him off the scene decreased so that christ and this bride would increase to this last day brother brown's not taking you in a rapture jesus christ amen praise the lord and that's who we have become in his word by him praise the lord amen let's stand if we could amen i hope maybe by the grace of god it uh that help today amen and made a difference again not something that most of us don't know not trying to bring any new doctrines or any new revelations just to understand see i told you i even used the word understand for it to be revealed to us that we can see there or we why we believe what we believe right amen i i think a lot of the old-timers had to go off the scene and spend a lot of time with brother brown because all they saw and all they had was a god in brother brown and and and there there's so much more and understandably you know people make light and fun of you know baptizing his name and so on and so forth which i absolutely don't agree with either but you know brother brown said if if there weren't facets like that if there weren't people out there that that were like that i'd have to repent for my ministry right because his calling was to live so close to christ that people would mistake him for jesus yeah that just proves to me he fulfilled the call he was supposed to fulfill right and the purpose he was supposed to serve amen psalm 398 let's see this before we go today praise the lord next week the lord willing will try to get to that that union amen that invisible union i've said here many times uh you know we're going to a wedding supper a wedding supper we're not going to a wedding we're going to a wedding sub [Music] 3.98 i needed someone to wash my sins and now i see a brand new grace all day long christ jesus paid the debt that i could never pay he paid debt and calvary he cleans my soul and set me free i'm glad that jesus did all my sins he raised and now i see a brand new song amazing grace all day long christ jesus [Applause] he's coming back for me to live to see him on that day i then will sing a brand new song amazing grace all [Music] amen praise the lord don't you like that one day he's coming back for me and i'm going to meet him in the air praise the lord to be with him eternally just like the scripture says we read so shall we ever ever be with the lord praise the lord jesus amen oh i'm so thankful looking forward to that time saints amen looking forward to that time praise the lord things are getting pretty bad down here below look around and there's don't mean to be a negative person but it's not very bright outside it's a lot of darkness going on sir yeah amen as the spirit of christ we talked about lifting off the gentile bride well when the bride goes there's nothing there'll be nothing here but hatred and death and satan the only thing holding it back now those four winds those angels holding those four wins this bride when she just when she gets uh in that place abraham said to come to know who she is gone out of here friend then what's going to be left oh i if you see how bad it is now i don't want to be here then i don't want to be here then praise the lord god bless you love you appreciate each one of you pray something was said to bless and strength in some way today amen i wanted to give you a quick update sister julie uh let's start from the bottom up sister julie's niece maggie uh is now tested negative for code her sister is still in the hospital and she's doing okay but her oxygen levels are still a little low last time i talked to julie about her sister she's okay when she set sarah lays there and she can breathe when she gets up for something her oxygen level almost immediately drops and so they're keeping her in the hospital for right now unless something's changed julie herself tested positive she has a few mild cold symptoms and that's all i know of so far sounds a little bit like what she went through brother zach with it but her dad obviously of course the older man is having a struggle they had to put him in the icu they're putting him on heat infused oxygen which they say is helping the doctors are saying that that infusion is that i don't know i i think they don't want to do certain things to older people because they just don't care if they die because of money i mean they're not going to do a procedure on an old person that has a slim chance of living or not going to live that many years anyway afterwards spending this procedure on them when their insurance isn't going to pay for it or something and you know things obama but anyway um so he is in who is still in the icu and his oxygen level through the heat infused and oxygen his saturation level had come up to 90. so he was doing a lot better with that but his delirium is increasing uh brother uh sister julie said they asked him his name the other day and he said purple and he doesn't know where he is and things says the the delirium is getting worse so that was the real urgency of the prayer requests you put in uh please remember him in that option level is getting better but the other is getting worse but we're just trusting that whatever it is that's going on he's in god's hands god's in control in charge and it's all going to work the way the lord wants it and the man's going to be if it's his time to go he's going to be safe where he goes yes but i will tell you julie's other desire is that her dad would come home if he's going to go she would rather he'd be at home than the hospital i understand that i don't blame her for that so we'll see lord the lord can work miracles right amen because this isn't some that's not something they normally do if somebody still has symptoms or tests positive for copenhagen they're not going to send them home uh but the lord has a way of working it out perfect so please remember them in prayer uh you heard the request for brother dennis his back had been bothering him and he went uh to the podiatrist and he ended up taking two toenails out uh so you have to be on this off his feet for a little while brother zach can sympathize in that situation and uh and they found that little nodule next to his kidney so we wanted to pray that that is nothing benign whatever but the tests he just had on it were inconclusive so they're gonna they're wanting to probably do a pet scan or something to get a bigger a better view of what it is or biopsy or something so please pray for brother dennis we're just trusting that's nothing everything's gonna come out fine and uh you know how the devil would mess with your mind especially oh he messes with us all but you know brother dennis went through that little bout of the cancer and stuff and that devil and so you know how the devil will mess with your mind if you've already been there and you think oh there's a growth in there you know the devil how the devil does well just pray the lord will start sending dennis pennies again give that constant reminder the lord is with you all right we're right before it is with you and our prayers are with him so amen remember that prayer also uh i have not heard from the realtor of the other church building but strangely enough and i'm taking this as from the lord we went to the minister's meeting i drove down to uh orange grove and thornydale uh to catch brother river thornydale uh for my brother roger drove so i left my car in the parking lot there at the sprouts behind the freddies and you know where the car show is or was whatever they do now right there and i got back i had a flyer in my car door the flyer was for the church that we were going to take its place for that same church that same pastor and they're having special meetings in their new building so uh and they started today so i'm assuming they're out of that building i haven't heard from the other but i'm going to be getting a hold of him somehow tomorrow or his broker or something and find out what's going on with the other i'm just i'm just taking it from the lord i mean what are the odds of having my car there and having the fire put in and getting there to see it but it had on their suite 111 and that's the new place they were going to and they were starting today so the other place has got to be i'm assuming going to be vacant so anyway just keep praying and we'll just trust the lord and see where the lord takes it from there so just wanted to give you that update and let you know god bless you anybody else before we go real quick love you appreciate you amen remember the ones that weren't here today amen and thank you for coming and being here pray the lord bless you richly amen god is good to us isn't he amen praise the lord brother pat would you dismiss us in prayer praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus yes we we know through revelation by you the truth and thank you for yes revealing the truth to us thank you lord you are the truth and we believe it we know that you are with us thank you jesus taking care of us and protecting us guiding us amen keep us safe and healthy return to meeting again thank you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen praise the lord amen i'm sorry yes i was the one that had in mind ask you about what bible you had i do have a king james bible but it's a school football field to be clear she wasn't the one that asked me or talked to me about a different translation it wasn't sister norman somebody that doesn't go to the church praise the lord amen amen the holy ghost is working amen [Music] is okay so so yes
