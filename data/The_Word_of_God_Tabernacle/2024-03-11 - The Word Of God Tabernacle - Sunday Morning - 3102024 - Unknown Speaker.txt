with our lord Jesus what it means to us amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen I want to read a few prayer requests to you this morning amen I didn't see me up there so uh just uh the few that I've gotten that we know about some that we know about haven't gotten anything else recently uh we obviously want to remember Sister Lydia sister Sheil in prayer uh they had their surgeries this past weeks they are both doing better both recuperating well sister Lydia has gotten her appetite back and eating again and feeling much better uh sister Sheilas of course was resting in home all week uh she's supposed to have her stitches out next week and just trust in the Lord that uh she's feeling good and believing that it's everything's healing well the way it's supposed to be they doctor got in there and found it had to go deeper than they anticipated but uh but believing that all was done all is well and that she's on the men and God's touching healing and healing is taking over amen praise the Lord so please remember Sister Lydia sheilia this morning we also remember Sister Karen her surgery is Thursday this Thursday the 14th so please remember her in prayer I know you have been but please continue to remember her in prayer I know she and I don't blame her probably would be a little apprehensive myself a little nervous uh brother Dennis has gone through similar procedure with the knee replacement this is a hip replacement but uh I imagine it's somewhat similar I would guess uh hers is probably maybe a little more a little newer uh as technology advances these surgeries get a little uh get a little different uh just like having a baby years ago when you had a baby you spent a whole week in a hospital now they barely keep you for a night uh if that unless there's some complication uh so they get you in and do their thing and get you out so which I don't mind so much U uh every one of you has been in hospitals I've never been a patient by the grace of God but uh we've all been there at least at some point in time and uh I don't know about you but the first first thing that happens to me when I walk in a hospital is man I want to get out of here I do not want to be in here uh and I know the P being a patient probably feels that much even that much more so um uh the I'm sure maybe the surgery has changed somewhat uh but just trusting she's supposed to have a sister Ken supposed to have an outstanding surgeon outstanding doctor or just trust in the Lord and of course she has the great position number one so just trus in the Lord to move on her bless and touch her too uh for the surgery this s please remember her in prayer also got a text from Brother Roger Friday uh that he was in bed all week sick burning up fever uh and brother Roger in bed he's disclosed to death brother Roger does not lay around uh so he must have been really really bad uh I texted him this morning though and he said he is feeling a little better he actually got out of bed yesterday uh I actually worked on a couple of toilets at their church that weren't working right uh so but he's still not 100% just trusting the Lord would touch him he actually text me Friday while I was in California asked if I could help take one or two of his services but uh I mentioned to you all last week about my right knee uh well Monday I did the the stainless so I'm up and down a ladder couple couple hundred times a day uh after Monday Tuesday Tuesday night my my right KN was like a softball it was just huge it's hurting it's hurting so bad right now but uh and and I think with all of my hobbling around it hasn't helped my left knee any either which was on the men and doing better uh so I do appreciate your prayers about that uh had a good week though outside of the excruciating pain uh I took proen a capalot to spr stuff nothing nothing helped the pain but uh I almost I I even text Brother Roger Friday I said well brother I don't even know if I'm going to have church I was hurting so bad uh but I worked all week I stood on my feet all week I had over 40,000 steps this week and that doesn't include the going up and down the ladder and stuff so I said if I can do if I can I can do this and the Lord will help you up here today with this this so I'm trusting him amen that's that's just all there is so appreciate your prayers uh but uh I have to say my my job though uh was a really good week I got a nice raise um uh Wednesday afternoon I got evaluated and I and that was after hobbling around Wednesday and then Thursday and Friday I said I guess this review is not based on what's been going on lately he said he said Newton even crippled you're out working everybody else I said well I I don't know how cuz it hurts so bad but uh uh but it was a good week uh probably the best job I ever did on the on that part of the job the stainless that I kind of enjoy doing that bending and getting it all in place and fitting in every it's uh anyway uh so outside of the the bad pain uh felt like it was very good week I enjoyed the week very much as far as that part of it goes but anyway um appreciate your prayers for that the Lord uh just I'm expecting healing so amen so praise the Lord so God bless you that was all the prayer requests I had down uh you have an unspoken request on your heart the Lord knows all of thingss today amen let's just stand to our feet if we could amen and uh I know brother Dennis has testimony he can give it after if he wants to but would you take these needs to the Lord for Lord Jesus we come before you with a humble heart knowing that you're the all sufficient God yes you are Lord Jesus and Lord we know your word says fear not little flock for it's a father's good pleasure to give you the kingom yes Jesus and Lord we're standing in a place where the greatest day will Dawn upon the Believers it will have the same testimony as Enoch will be raptured yes Lord soon I believe father to meet you in the air and Lord it's very important that we search our hearts da that there's no sin unbelief in our hearts has keeping us away from you and Lord I heard your Prophet this week say you we must put you first in everything thank you Father even at our jobs Even in our our homes even amongst uh people that are not Believers to let our lives shine as a true testimony of Jesus Christ yes God and Father there's some that

this time yes Jesus and there's others that are sick father our precious brother Roger who's been sick all week and as our brother Newton said he's not one that just lays around when he's not feeling

your testimony brother yes sir I go right ahead I was getting ready to to leave for church like to be here early I just like to pray and just get myself out of the way and um I was driving to pick up Danny and I realized I didn't have my wallet so I have to turn around from Speedway in Harrison and I got home I say I can find my wall easy I usually put it certain places couldn't find it Leah was bless her heart was help me so I couldn't find it so I told the pastor uh I can't find my wallet pray that I can find it because I I drive so far I don't want to drive without my license and I prayed and and our brother Newton prayed he knew about it and Leah says W you call the place that you were last so I was at a caretta and I called them and they says well describe we have a while to describe it and I says with dark t they says well tell me more said pull out the license it says Dennis G yeah come and pick it up so I picked it up and came right to church amen praise the Lord thankful for that God is mindful many times something like that would just disappear and never be seen again especially it seems like anymore today yes and well I got a little commical relief for you this morning uh somehow my phone daylight savings time got turned on so I was here an hour early an hour earlier than I normally am here I normally get here about nine o'clock and but the the funny part of it was not the getting up and getting ready and being here that wasn't any big deal but the whole time I was sitting there thinking it was 10:00 10:05 I'm sitting there and I'm reading my Bible and looking at the clock and it's 1010 and I'm like is it Sunday did I miss something did I enter an alternate Dimension or something nobody's here Dennis hasn't called Danny hasn't called I mean if they're not here at 10:00 and they haven't called the rapture's gone or something I'm thinking uh left behind I don't what I didn't know what was going on I got 20 minutes after 10 Oh I thought it was 20 minutes after 10 I got up sat like I always do right there I said well doing what I always do and for some reason it domed on me all of a sudden and I thought what if my phone is wrong and I looked up the clock and it was 9:20 not 10:20 oh my goodness I've been here this whole time thinking everybody had forsaken me or something nobody was coming to jerse today and nobody was letting me know they're not coming and finally thought oh my goodness I looked at my phone and Y it somehow the setting had got changed I don't know how it got changed so it switched daylight savings time and it was told me but I thought I said well I'm glad it's not fall if it was fall you guys would have been calling me where are you uh I wouldn't i' have been an hour late so anyway I'd rather be a little I'd rather be the early than the late part uh just the funny part of it was is just what was wondering what was going on it's 10 o00 and nobody was here 10:20 nobody's here anyway thank the Lord amen somehow it just dawned on me and uh we're here so praise the Lord amen thankful for that 263 let's sing this song Amen 263 we sang it a few times haven't sung it in a while amen praise the Lord let's start with the chorus let's start with the chorus I haven't sung in a while so maybe the chorus will help get me jump started here is different now praise the lord it's different now since Jesus saved my soul it's different now since by his blood I'm whole oh Satan had to flee when Jesus rescued me now is different oh so different now once I was lost in sin I had no peace with to save my weary soul I knew

when Jesus rescued me now is different oh so different now I went to church one day to hear them sing and pray the preacher firmly plowed that gospel plow he said you must repent so down the aisle I went and now it's different oh so different now it's different now since Jesus Sav my soul is different now since by his blood I'm whole oh Satan had to when Jesus rescued me now is different oh so

to be in the past and all amen but we certainly can remember one thing it's different now than when it was yes praise the Lord Jesus how he could come why he would come and save my weary soul I know not how but I do know one thing and that one thing is since he got a hold of me it's different amen not the man I used to be hallelujah oh praise the Lord Jesus amen so different now let's stand to our feet if we could amen we'll go go to the scripture amen going to go over to ma again to Matthew 11 verse 25 amen kind of well not pick up where we left off we're kind of going to go a little bit of a different direction today but the same topic same subject if you [Music] will this will be God in Simplicity part two Bri vers the church part five amen God andity part 14 Bri versus Church part five amen let's look at uh let's start with again with Matthew 11:25 but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer amen Lord Jesus father God we're so very thankful Your Grace your mercy your love your blessings all that you give to us Lord every day we're So Unworthy Lord within ourselves God but it's not our worthiness that we look to anyway it's it's not our righteousness that we depend upon or lean upon lord it's yours it's you God and it's what you've done for us that we depend on that we look to that we trust in that we believe God today is still with us even right now this time lord and that's why one reason we come to this place church today trusting believing you to meet with us father and to speak to us from your word Lord the spirit that we feel and knowing god the pulsation of the Holy Ghost is sweeps through this place God oh that's such a wonderful thing to us Lord but God when that word comes and Lord that Revelation the spirit Lord brings that word life to us oh God it means more to us than life Lord Lord oh thank you God for that word thank you for the message thank you for truth thank you for your spirit Lord and thank you for Revelation to show to us in here Lord what you'd have us to see and know today God may it may you help us with it may it draw us closer to you more like you more in your image Lord because we're believing and trusting only in you we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done father may you accomplish here Lord in this place today what you set this service forth before before the foundation of the world in your mind God the purpose that you had here for this today yield ourselves to you Lord and trusting that you'd speak to us and have your will and way in Jesus Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen Matthew 11:25 let's read here as we have every other time at the time at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto bab amen you could be seated if you'd like amen I want to start delving some into Revelation we're getting over into revelation probably one of the greater which we have already hit on before in several Services probably the number one uh uh book of the scripture that that shows us the differentiation between the bride and the church amen the biggest thing that we see here the bride and the church as I said before probably the number one one of the things I would consider maybe the number one thing that varies makes a variance between the bride and the church is that the church goes through the tribulation the bride does not the church still needs uh a time of purging the bride does not the church still needs a time of cleansing the bride does not amen so the the difference between the church going through the ra going through the tribulation and the bride not amen but now I want to go over to Revelation chapter 17 amen and I don't and I don't want to feel like that I'm going to rush through this or or uh condense this in any way or anything like that but uh we just do the best we can Saints if I have to grab a chair you'll just have to excuse me uh but uh I I don't plan on doing that but just to let you know if that happens and you can understand but I want to start Revelation chapter one and uh and just start with the first verse uh and and and we can find in here exactly the the difference as well here between to between the bride and the church uh again let's start with the first verse and there came one of the Seven Angels the seven angels had the seven vials uh Angels which had the seven vials and talk with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that Seth upon many Waters we know that of course is a denotation of female amen that sth upon many Waters people uh uh some of this becomes evident when you get to verse 10 11 through 18 uh some of the description of that becomes a little more real but if you know the scriptural uh types you understand that Waters uh multitudes glassy sea uh people multitudes amen so this great woman this great female that said It's oddly enough that this is the beginning of the of of women's month in this country uh that this message came up at this time was not planned just so that you know that um but U this woman great that Seth upon many Waters upon great multitudes of people with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth had been made drunk with the wine of her fornications they have been enti intoxicated with the stimulant of her illicit ways her doctrines her her dogmas uh these great Kings these inhabitants of the earth a great number of the inhabitants of the Earth have been made intoxicated have have taken into and drunken into the stimulation the wine the stimulation of her dogmas and because of this they've been made drunk upon or wearied outside of their normal comprehension wearied themselves Beyond normaly or beyond what truth would be because Dogma Doctrine Dogma is not is something that's man-made uh now obviously our we have a doctrine that we follow but a Dogma something that is a manmade something it's something that somebody came up with or or that they connived in a in a Seminary or something somewhere or in a denomination uh that that this woman this this woman is setting upon these people in other words by her fornication she has taken control over these people she has made them intoxicated they they partake in so much of her Dogma that they become bought into it uh shall I say they have become uh alcoholics right amen they become alcoholics they need they need to start or there already has been started they need to come to a different AA meeting amen and that is a gospel church a true gospel church that preaches the gospel of of Christ that preaches the true revealed word of the hour will absolutely help that person become uh uh get away from being a drunker or dependent upon the the the wine of that fornication amen uh they go to AA meetings all the time to get away from a physical alcohol they need to come to a church AA to get away from the spiritual alcohol uh the Dogma that this church is feeding them amen but they've all become drunk the drunk again outside of their own capacity see when a person gets drunk they lose their mental capacities right a little at a time but the more they intoxicate themselves the more they become involved and intoxicate themselves the more they take on the mark of the beast the more they become drunken the more they come outside of themselves it sort of goes back a little to what we talked about last week where I believe a lot of these people who look around and uh you see how the government's going and how the country is going and how people are going and and you wonder how could they be how would they and brother man would even make that statement he was talk about even a female say how could a regular normal thinking female walk walk out on the street without her skirt on Amen and we look at today and we say how could a normal thinking person think that that's okay right how would a normal thinking person think that we could put someone in the highest form of our government with absolute impunity they they can't this person cannot be fired the job they were appointed to is for life and doesn't even know what a woman is right she was a person was asked about to make this slip at her confirmation what a woman and she could not even give the definition of what a woman is now see we look at this and we say now how could a normal regular person think a thinking person think like that uh act like that why would they do these things why would they go out in public like that why would they talk like that and see but see you got to understand so many of they've been they've been drunken that they've been drunken off the fornication off the wine of the fornications of the spiritual fornication it's not a physical fornication it's a spiritual fornication it's a fornication it's a defiling of their spirituality with a Dogma with a church with a denomination that is outside God and His word right and they become drunk on it right now they've gotten to themselves to the place that they do things that are just simply unrecognizable or or or does or actually to me a lot of times is absolutely devoid of common sense right amen Common Sense doesn't even come into play anymore to the point that uh uh uh I think me and I think I was me and my wife me and Sonia went down to tun stone for one of our anniversaries and I was walking I think I may have even taken a picture of it but we went by and and you know they have all the novelty stuff they had these t-shirts that were made up and and uh one of the t-shirts said that I'm not going to say it exactly right but I'm going to paraphrase it based on what I've said many times Common Sense isn't so common anymore it doesn't seem to be anyway well a lot of people they lot people are just drunk they're intoxicated they're doing things and they think they're okay I believe a lot of times these people are doing things thinking that that's the right way to do it yeah right they actually literally believe that is the correct way of doing it I think a lot of people now let's bring it to the spiritual aspect I think a lot of people if they knew better they would not get baptized in titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost which you can't baptize in Father Son and Holy Ghost anyway because if you do that you're not even baptized but you don't understand the point right I don't believe they would get if they could see in the scripture but they've been so drunken off of this wine they they've been made to believe so long uh by the Distortion spiritually of God's word that they go into the water with a sincere I I give them the benefit of the doubt obviously I try to everybody I I hope everybody tries to do that with me so it's like Jesus said if you want Mercy give Mercy blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy so if I'm going to expect to have mercy I want to give it I believe when people go into that water they literally are going in with a sincere heart they really want to show that they that they've accepted Jesus Christ as their savior as their Lord that they love and they go in there sincerely believing that that this is going to be what it takes to to be able to uh to make Heaven Unfortunately they just don't know um drunken denominations that will teach them and tell them that this is the way to do it this is so what Jesus said in Matthew 28 now how can you dispute with that and I believe people are sincere I believe they go in there sincerely believing that they are doing what is right but it's not amen and I believe that's uh it's I haven't God forgive me but I haven't been drunk probably since I was 19 years old but when you're outside of your mind uh the old Newton that's different now that the Dead Guy uh I got home one night don't even know how I got home I mean that's just the truth uh one time I went with guys from work when we were working I was just a kid I was 18 years old and I I literally uh I guess honest confession is good for the soul is that okay because that man's dead anyway so well ulize him properly and put him into the dirt but there's a blank Ang black anguses right here where the Tesla dealership is now there's people we went in there we had we worked late on the job uh inventory and stuff and uh I I I guess it didn't matter back then that you could drink in you were 18 but we went to a bar and I drank myself silly and went to this restaurant and got I got up to go to the bathroom I didn't even get anything to eat I went up and went to the bathroom I got so sick I would I would excuse me I'm sorry but I got sick in the toilet and I and I passed out wake up hear people commotion get sick pass out wake up again hear commotion

weird I go open the door the restaurant's empty they're closed literally I walk out the bathroom if anybody was ever that black Engish you would know it's bathrooms right there I walked out the bathro I was 19 years old what he legally supposed to be drinking I walked out the door got in the car and went home I had no idea how I got home no idea just shows God's with you even when you're stupid even when you're a a young idiot kid uh God is still with you but my point of that being I I friends I was outside my mind uh I assumed everything was okay I thought everything was fine I I thought what I was doing was right you know I was fitting in with the guys the warehouse and uh this was this was an okay thing to do I didn't see anything about it and I was so outside my mind I don't I don't know what happened that night after that point I literally do not know I know God knows but you understand people they they get so drunken they take this this wine and this spiritual fornication they get so drunken by it that they just literally get outside their minds and you look all around you today and that's the majority of what you see people that are just outside their minds amen because this has taken over that's right spiritually taken over the world you say oh we got all kinds of churches all over the place and everyone almost every one of them go right down the line with the Trinity Doctrine and baptism Father Son and the Holy Ghost is just as ungodly and demonic as anything else yes amen amen amen if you're part of a denominate maybe it's good I said this today and not last week but uh that's just that's just scripture Amen brother brandom said evil spirits travel in the titles of father son Holy Ghost amen that's the truth drunken now see on the wine of that stimulation off the stimulation of that fornication amen third verse so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman set Upon A Scarlet colored Beast amen Scarlet colored Beast royalty colored Beast full of names of blasphemy or Blasphemous names amen you go back to the message Blasphemous names you'll see having seven heads and 10 horns now this woman this this Harlot is ill- fainted woman is riding this Beast now this Beast is not an individual people will have paintings and pictures and and and depictions of of a beast of an animal of of some kind of a uh a unknown uh Beast of an animal that this woman is riding on and make pictures a friend it has nothing to do with that this Beast is a spiritual office right amen it's a spiritual office this Beast is writing it's no more than the same Beast that was in Revelation 12 right and we read about the red dragon the Beast who is that's the devil Amen in Revelation 12 it tells us the exact same thing it's the devil amen but it's a spiritual office that that that that devil has been able to Incarnate himself in and this woman this church is writing her remember Church represent uh woman represents Church scripture the waters multitudes people the the church the woman is represent of a church this church is sitting upon this Powerful Beast now the significance of this Beast to me really reverts back even to uh Revelation four five uh six where where God is using those the the ones that we talked about the the lion the calf the animal the anointings uh Satan always impersonates what God is doing Satan always tries to manipulate and pervert what God is doing so now he's got this Beast which is a powerful animal it's a it's a powerful system amen that's the that's the whole point of the beast when we're talking about these Beast anointings they're powerful anointing Saints that's why it was so important in those Church ages for those powerful anointings to be a part of the Bride for that time well this beast on the other side of the aisle on the other side of the tracks if you will this demonic Beast now is a powerful animal it's a powerful force going uh forth in the world today with this woman this church sitting on it amen and Scarlet of course uh red the red dragon is just the impersonal Ator of God Amen just the impersonator of God riding this Beast with the names of blaspheming all over them right amen one of those names is Baptist one of those names is Methodist one of those names is Pentecostal one of those names is charismatic one of those whatever these denomination outshoots are coming off of it they're all just a bunch of Blasphemous names right yeah amen it says names are blasphemy but BL Blasphemous Blasphemous names is the same thing what they need to do is just go to every one of those church and write kabot over every door amen God has departed from this place if he ever was there to start with amen amen this Beast now is full of blaspheming so each one of these they started n Rome Catholic Church started out of each one of those uh or out of that one has come each one of these Blasphemous names amen as each one down Through the Ages that would get drunken by the wine of that fornication of that Spirit of that Dogma each one of those that would come an out an outcrop a outshoot uh a springing forth of another denomination right amen a Methodist over here and then a Lutheran over here and then a Baptist over here and then a this and then each one of this I don't know how many there are it used to be 1,700 or so denominations I don't know how many there are now uh just Christian denominations that's not even talking about Buddhists and Hindus and all I'm talking about just Christian denomination I don't know how many there are now but Blasphemous names if they're not preaching the pure word and they taged themselves to that ungodly Trinity Doctrine right then they fall in the same category as this Blasphemous names amen names of blasphemy having seven heads 10 horns which it describes over in the the the Kings and the powers and verse 12 14 13 14 but let's go on and the woman was array in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand oh look at the beauty look at the pomp look at the look at the uh uh the attraction that people have to the to the senses to the eye to the to the touch to the to the even to the imagination the gold oh my uh this must be right look at this huge building uh look at all the money that they have look at the fineries look at the gold look at the look at the colors this look at this huge beautiful staple uh steepled building this this must be the correct thing this must be right amen when God dwells in just the small still smallest voice amen amen you may have a church on the street down the corner that had 5,000 people of it this morning with beautiful staple Steeples and and the colors and stained glass and all that and the guy with the and the guy preaching Down on the Corner eating sood crack and drink Branch water has more God than any of them put together right amen because God's not in all that God's not in all this purple Scarlet gold precious stones pearls all that's the fineries of the world it's not in all the fineries of the world Amen in her hand now she has a golden cup that's full in her hand full of the Abominations and filthiness of for fornication now what again what is that fornication it is a it is a defiling of themselves with someone other than what their their husband other than the one they claim is their husband they claim God is their husband they say that they believe Jesus Christ and Christ is their husband and they they claim that they they put Christian over their doors they put Christian in their literature they introduced themselves as Christian they claimed themselves to be the wife of Jesus Christ but yet committing fornication with another man against Jesus Christ spiritually amen and this golden cup is full of those Abominations and filthiness that is a result of the spiritual fornication that they commit claiming to be Christians and yet serving another God Amen now we get to the mark of the beast right amen now you get to a whole another place where people accept that Doctrine people accept that dogma and the right hand of fellowship and the belief and and the action that they put towards the belief that they have that this Dogma is correct when it's completely contrary to God's word they put that into action they believe it up here amen they got it they're sealed in their foreheads they believe that they've got the mark of the beast and they put that into action the mark of the beast in their hand amen their right hand their forehead is the hand of Fellowship their forehead amen it's that Den it's that Dogma that they Tred to that that is offered to them that they take the the the Abominations and the filthiness of this fornications to wear upon her forehead amen now Upon This Woman's forehead was the name mystery well it's only a mystery to those who don't know but friend look the majority don't know right so it is a great mystery we'll read on down we find out who it is well we know who it is a mystery to the name written mystery Babylon the great my mind the mother of harlots oh that must mean that she's had children well where do you think this Blasphemous names came from amen it started with them Catholic and it went from there right she had babies she had children and so those those names became Blasphemous names as they were derived from that original woman that rode that Scarlet colored Beast my mind she's a mother now so she has Offspring Blasphemous names mother of har uh harlots an Abominations of the earth it's the abomination of the earth people want to say that uh this person that person this entity that entity the Democrats say that about the Republicans in this country the Republicans say that about the Democrats in this country let me tell you who the Abomination is it's not Joe Biden it's not uh Donald Trump it is the devil that's the abom is the spiritual abom all this physical stuff going on that's just a blip on the radar we're talking about spiritual activity that is way more important that anything that you could see here or know in the Physical Realm amen that is the abom ination the Abomination is the spiritual aspect of it not the physical aspect of it behind closed doors this that they try that Satan tries to hide is the spiritual degradation that's going on the spiritual uh uh death that's happening through this fornication because remember God does not accept a harlot right he put his own people away for that Saints God put his own children away for that yeah he put away the Jew because of that because she Spirit she committed spiritual fornication now she's got to go now she has had and is going through this cleansing process to where eventually as we've said before there will be a finishing of that Abomination that's why God never does forget his people but they were blinded for a while so that the Gentile could see right amen now notice I I also just just as a little blurp here want you notice in the scripture she was according to the scripture she was blinded the Jew was blinded in Romans 11 but she comes to receive sight through the two witnesses in in Revelation 11 right amen Roman 11 took it away Revelation Revelation 11 brought it back wow praise the Lord amen but done that way so now God could graft Us in the Gentile bride that would believe praise the Lord now this Gentile bride is believing now the the the mother of Harless bom Ser now sixth verse and I saw the and I I haven't even got to where I wanted to go yet and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints drunken uh that is to take with excess to become intoxicated amen this this woman was intoxicated ated became excessive with the blood of the Saints blood of the Saints not not blood of the of the of the unbeliever let's just say blood of the Heathen blood of the Saints amen well they have in their own Catholic martyrology what was it 53 million that they claim murder during that uh the Dark Ages drunken no wonder she's drunken anybody I don't care how much of an alcoholic they are you go you you go drink what 100 kegs of beer whatever it is or uh however many fifths of liquor you're going to get drunk well this success of murdering people murdering one after the other murder murder murder murder I haven't even I should I hav have done that yet uh I still like math I always like math when I was a kid I wonder brother Pat you like math too uh let's figure I'm going to I'm going to look at the Dark Age period and see how many 53 million how many is that per day that they kill per day because the Dark Ages we have defined brother brandom gave it to us this period of time 53 million I wonder what that comes down to per day that they murdered I I bet you it's a large number amen let's don't do that right now but uh I bet it's a large number per day that they murder well no wonder they're drunk no wonder she's drunk with the blood of the Saints amen and with the blood of the martyrs of who Jesus amen Martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration and the angel said unto me wherefore this thou marble I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman of the Beast that carried her which had the seven heads and 10 horns now now here we get to the Beast the Beast that thou saw us was and is not well we know that's the office of the pope now a lot of people want to say the pope is the Beast the pope is not the Beast the devil's the Beast the pope is the office of the Beast that the devil has control over right Amen to me it's kind I try to like to make that differentiation because it's like going back in the Garden of Eden when people say that Eve had sex with the devil no she didn't a man of of physical human woman cannot have a a relationship like that with a spirit right but I've had people say I've heard ministers say that it's not true she had relation with the serpent whom the devil had taken control over amen it's that simple amen amen now it's the same thing here that they they've had fornication this office with with whom Satan has taken control over Satan has taken control over the pap office that's why that uh it is who it is the ficaras Philly di in place of Christ uh the triple crown and all those things that we know uh of course I've done it here years ago where I spelled out the vicarious filia and shows we can see that it spells out 666 666 amen but it literally means in place of or instead of Christ right amen um Satan now incarnate in that Spirit now this Beast which thou saw us uh was and is not amen well that's exactly what this Pap of office is they have a pope he dies they elect another one he dies elect another one he dies was is not was is not was is not was is not still even to today was is not was is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit now that's the devil not the Pope's office that's the devil the Beast remember the Beast is the office and uh shall go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall Wonder here's your mystery now and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life and the foundation of the world when they beheld the Beast that was and is not and yet is amen now you've got a group of people uh actually it calls it says the uh those that dwell on the earth uh that is pretty much everybody right I don't know anybody else I don't know anybody that dwells above the Earth uh that's pretty much every human that ever draw a breath right but there's an exception everyone that ever draw a breath except for an exception that exception is the people whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life or as it says here the book of life that was before the foundation of the world well the only book of life that there is that existed before the foundation of the world is that book is in God's mind and in God's mind were you from the beginning am amen that's the only one that existed before the foundation of the world was those names that was in God's mind back then those are the ones who have not been deceived praise the Lord so the ones that are deceived are the ones who were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation world so it's the whole world the whole earth becomes deceived by this except for those that were in him before the foundation of the world those that belong to him Christ the bride that's again that that is a separation Point amen the bride we were a part of him before the foundation of the world and we have it's like The Prodigal Son the prodical son was never not a son no matter what he did where he went how he how he conducted his life blew his daddy's money none of that mattered it was nothing that that boy could ever do to cause himself to ever not be the son of the man right could do it there's no way no matter what he could change his name he could go to court and get himself emancipated it doesn't matter whatever he tried to do didn't matter he was still the son of so and so hallelujah amen amen never was not a son Hallelujah you no matter how bad I was I was never not a son right I was always God's son it don't matter if I was passed out in the bathroom of a Black Angus Restaurant I was still a Son of God am amen I didn't look like it Hallelujah didn't sound like it didn't feel like it wasn't acting like it for sure but I was amen I just thank God that one day I come to the realization I wasn't that guy I'm this guy yeah amen praise the Lord and when I come to that realization I had to kill him so this one could live amen so he's dead praise the Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah so we're thankful that God did that for us so always a son in God's mind you were always there amen always there those names written they say well you got a we got a book here we got to read some names all that matters is what is in in God's mind amen it a physical book somewhere name somewhere God has it all up here right or I we say up here God's the spirit too but uh always in God's thinking God's mind to attribute a part of God just look at it that way only have to think about the brain or the head or the mind a part of God Amen and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads or seven mountains we can finish reading all that amen you can read that we'll go uh well we probably won't come back to that later anyway I want to go over and read another verse to follow this this to follow this and it's the next chapter over chapter 18 verse4 and there'll probably be some followup to this next week uh next week the next couple weeks there's a kind of a finalization I want to bring up of uh of a lot of this and we'll probably revisit this to some point uh then so Revelation 18 now verse four Revelation uh 184 now it says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her who my people right praise the Lord who are his people hallelujah his people are the ones who are part of him before the foundation of the world his people are the ones that are in verse 8 178 that were names who were written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world in God's mind a part of God come out of her mind who her don't be partaker of her sin don't be partaker drunken on the wine of her fornication come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sin that you that you receive not of her plagues that's exactly what the Bride of Jesus Christ has done she has come out of that system she has come out of those dogmas she has come out from being a part of receiving the mark of of the beast but I do want you to see something else so now the foolish virgin does not receive the mark of the beast either amen because remember the foolish virgin is exactly what it says they're virtuous right yes those that receive the mark of the beast are not virtuous people that's why they have a mark theyve received that Dogma they've received that Doctrine they've allowed themselves to come drunken on that amen the foolish virgin does not they are virtuous they have not committed fornication against the one they claim as their God Amen they just didn't become born again they just didn't receive the Holy Spirit they just didn't uh receive the indwelling presence of the holy spirit amen but they were undefiled they are virtuous people now notice it mentions four times if I remember right over here here that we just read four times about fornication amen how could you have committed fornication and yet be virtuous right amen so the foolish virgin even though they go in the tribulation they do not receive the mark of the beast they can't because they're virtuous scripturally they they maintain uh their virtue amen they cannot be uh it cannot be defiled by any other man by any other Dogma by any another denomination they cannot be defiled now let's go to Revelation chapter 9 I'm going to finish this up here uh here real directly the Lord help amen Revelation chapter n and I got one other scripture I just want to hit real quick uh because I'm not going to be able to get to the rest of this but uh but that's okay uh Revelation chapter chapter n one good thing I I I enjoyed when the Lord called me to be a pastor I used to do everything I could do to try to pack what the lord gave me into one sermon wherever I went I I uh and and when I first started pastoring I tried to do that again and it would get later and later I was like what am I doing I can finish this next week or I can finish this Wednesday night or or just really break it down and make six eight parts to it that's why we have God in Simplicity part 14 now amen but now Revelation 9 uh verse 13 very familiar scripture reading but let's look here and the sixth Angel sounded and Heard a Voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth Angel which had the trumpet loose the Four Angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates loose them now that's the that's the instruction from God to this sixth Angel to loose those four Angels amen loose those four Angels which are bound there the Great River e phas and the Four Angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour day month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were 200,000,000 and I heard the number of them the 200,000,000 demons now I mentioned this before because I did again I told you I like math so did the math on it you do2 200,000 pretty easy math it's 200 million amen 200 million demons now I have surmised in my opinion that it is possible that those 200 million demons are the third of whom Satan deceived in heaven and were cast cast out into the Earth I don't know that brother Brown never said that uh that's just something that I think maybe would have been Joel asked us last night uh me and sofa how many angels do you think there are well I no idea whatsoever but I said well based on the math that if I think that the 200 million is a third then you got two more thirds which is 400 million I don't know that I said well then you got all different Angels there's not just one type of Angel you got different types of angels I thought 400 400 million that's a lot I don't know but God knows and that's what matters but 200 million demons now now let's look why were those 200 million demons loed 200 million demons let's look at this Feast of the trumpets again I'm finishing here Feast of the trumpets brother said what has it done in the cunningness as he said he come in like flatteries and what has he done Satan Satan come in like flatteries we know that's exactly how the that's the devil's T that's actually the devil's number one tactic flattery and Beauty Satan uses Beauty and flatteries uh shooing I called it more than anything amen just get you comfortable make you feel good make it look good uh you know how if it feels good it looks good how can it be bad uh that's probably one of the number one signs that it is bad uh but anyway let's move on comes in like flatteries now what has he done he is bringing the Protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride how loosed look now loosed in the Eccles astical Church Spirit ecclesiastical now look at this spiritual ecclesiastical it's again 200 million bilon demons it's not a physical act this is spiritual so if it's spiritual these 200 million demons that were looed is not a physical demon however they do work just like we talked about the office of the Pope and Satan having control over it right amen these 200 men in the spiritual realm ecclesiastical realm brother R said loose in the ecclesiastical Church spirit amen it's not out in the world is it's not a part of government all no it's the church spirit it's a religious spirit 200 million demons loosed upon what not upon the denominations but upon the bride am amen why are these 200 million demons loosed on the bride because that's the group he doesn't have right amen praise the Lord and even though he knows enough to know he can't get them he still keeps trying right 200 million demons loosed to torture and torment you every day amen 200 million oh aren't you aren't you so glad that that that uh uh greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world Amen aren't you glad that we can say likea Elisha there's more with us than there are with them amen amen the armies can come flooding in these 20 200 million million demons can come flooding in but all that just open our eyes and look around at all the Chariots and angels with their flaming swords drawn just waiting to take action right praise God thank you Lord I consider that an impenetrable Fortress that God has around every believer Hallelujah and if Satan tries to break that border there goes that flaming sword and takes another one of those demons and puts him in his place amen praise God does it for us does it for all of his bride amen amen 200 million demons spiritual loosed upon the bride amen now not now this not physical I'm not talking about a hurt KN I'm talking about spiritual right this goes back to this goes back to Revelation 6 when you see in Revelation 6 that we talked about it length when I opened the third seal I heard a beast say come and see him Behold a black horse him that s on had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice where in the midst of the four beasts Jesus Christ that voice in the midst of the four beasts now Revelation 66 cry a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and wine you can measure out the wealth of the world you can do all this to all these people and all this this ecclesiastical Spirit spiritual death but don't you touch my people amen amen a measure wheat for a penny three measure barley but see you hurt not the oil and the wine the Holy Spirit the stimulus off the Holy Spirit the bride don't you touch them amen don't now what did Brother Ramsey said that's tell now don't you get them said now you go through all this marate and all the Dark Ages and they're going to be killed and all that's again it's not physical not physical spiritual he said but don't you dare get one to bow down to an image or say they're hell marries and stuff amen praise the Lord why because she stays spiritually pure spiritually virtuous amen praise the Lord she cannot will not be defiled by these demonic spirits but now these 200 million million demons are loosed out spiritually to do what to try to deceive you they're not on denomination why why why AR these two why aren't these 200 million demons concerned about the denomination world because he's got them yes my wife goes shopping sometimes and she asked me do we need milk I don't know honey let me look oh we got 2third of a gallon we're good you know what she's not going to go to the store and buy another three gallons of milk we got milk for me and her why in the world you need to get any more understand amen if if Satan has them why does he bother to have to go loose those demons on them right right he's not loosing the demons on them he's got plenty of milk he's only concerned those that he does not have yes and by God's grace he will never have CU we belong to him we belong to God hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus I'm so thankful Saints I just about to get out of myself here not upon the nomination upon the bride but here you'll get it but now the bride brother BR says now but the bride will not go through that time yes now he's talking about tribulation the bride will not go through this time the Bible says not the church will but the bride will not glory to God he says and brother br's like can't you see that ministers can't you see that people can't you see that Brethren unfortunately a lot of them could amen amen you say the church has to go through the per uh the persecution for the Perfection of he said the blood of Jesus Christ has perfected the bride amen a man doesn't a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a bunch of punishment he's already found Grace with her glory god this is one of my favorite quotes I got to tell you I love this so much I'd sit down right now but I don't know if I can get back up a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment how simple is that how easy easy is that you think it's got to be some great Revelation what better a knowledge you could you come up with amen a man who who loves chooses a wife doesn't put her through a bunch of punishment he's already found Grace with her praise the Lord she's found Grace with him he's engaged to her she's engaged to him they become one praise the Lord amen that's why she belongs to him that's why we're part of the word amen amen because we're a part of him Hallelujah let's stand if we could I got little bit more I'm going to stop there it just makes me feel so good inside you think about what God's done for us what God's given us where God's brought us from what we're going to and to know that it doesn't matter the best efforts that the devil could even think about can I come up with there is not one thing he can do to change it yes praise God thank you Lord God's got this Bride on display brother Bram said God is going to prove to Satan in this day that this bride is not like Eve yes you know he said that he's going to prove another reason those demons are loosed on the bride is to prove even with all those demons to prove that we this bride is not like Eve she is not going to commit fornication against her husband Jesus Christ she's not going to do it praise the Lord she knows who she is she knows where she is in the word she knows what that word is to her amen praise the Lord oh I'm so glad God is so good to us
