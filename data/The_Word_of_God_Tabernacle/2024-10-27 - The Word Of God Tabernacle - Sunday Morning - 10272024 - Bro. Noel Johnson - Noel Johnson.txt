took away my sin the moment that he blessed me he made me fully whole with that ever lasting Joy within my soul I'm drinking from the fountain theow from on high e e e e e e in the middle in the situation position where the hurricane uh kind of flooded there in the Appalachian Mountains and brother no and I'm getting any relief or assistance from the government uh uh some people they talk to have places to go but I'm sure there's people that don't have places to go that don't have food that don't have water clean drinking water uh it's starting to get cold up there for warmth and so just the basic necessities that we come to consider basic necessities of life uh that those people need desperately so please continue to remember them in prayer if you would um the Lord will just help them amen does anyone else have a prayer requ I saw the prayer request I had um I had a couple of announcements I wanted to make but U that was the only prayer requests I had here um praise the Lord anyone else it's good to have our precious sister with us huh HMA yeah I was getting that thank you though uh himma uh who sister met on the bus and we're very thankful to have her so welcome

probably what was going to happen so my flight leaves at 1:30 again today uh so I appreciate you coming a little bit early for us again today um but I appreciate your prayers just got the uh the flight from here to Denver thankfully it's non-stop so I appreciate your prayers for that too brother Dennis would you take Lord Jesus it's just a privilege to come into your house to worship you to give you the praise honor and Glory you're worthy of I feel like like the ones that walked with you in the road of emus did not their hearts bur burn within them as they talk to you along the way thank you Jesus and Lord I believe you'll speak to our hearts if our hearts are right with you it's a time to search our hearts there's a strong Spirit that's battling even the Believers that follow this great message you have sent through your Prophet brother bradam that's a religious spirit that's a spirit that makes themselves feel that I'm doing good but when the word comes forth they refuse to line up and that's why brother Brown emphasize the importance of having that Born Again experience yes Lord where it'll be automatic that you want to please God you want to line up to the word it's like you spoke to Solomon and one night you said that if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves Lord will pray will seek my face I will hear from Heaven yes I will forgive their sins I will heal their lands and father our promise is to us today Lord as we pray and bring these requests before you we believe it's a finished work that you already acquired for us at Calvary and there are many are still sick that we love them dearly compassion is doing the will of the father and Prophet said and without compassion we couldn't even begin to know how Jesus yes Lord and Lord

with him and brother Vernon at front door opening opening the door for people yeah um me and brother Larry and brother Vernon brother Larry and brother Vernon did it a lot longer than I did but I joined them a little bit there for a while and then brother Vernon passed away so it was kind of just me and brother Larry but uh we had a lot of conversation in between people coming in the door uh so um I appreciated that about him and uh I know he'll be of course greatly missed so please remember them in prayer if you would as well also got a praise report here from s from U uh brother Dennis about his wife Leah as you all know she had surgery Thursday uh he said I want to thank and praise the Lord for touching my wife with her recent surgery she is healing very well and she goes to see the doctors this coming Tuesday I want to believe that she will have excellent report as the doctor sees her praise the Lord amen so thankful to that amen God is good so we're glad to hear that Leah's doing well amen praise the Lord Jesus amen got one more song We'll sing it what have no come number song number 381 amen song number 381 this song has just been going uh through my heart here for a while especially with everything going on in this world uh kind of got me to thinking about this song Yesterday so I thought we'd sing it today amen praise the Lord 381 in the song book have it on the

longing to get to that place amen praise the Lord that place that we call home amen yes the Lord Jesus also meant to mention I did not hear from uh art and sharah they may still be working I know they had like two or three Sundays uh that both of them were working uh this may be the last Sunday I can't remember um look at sister she she can't remember either that's okay I think this may be the last Sunday it was like three or four Sundays they had an aad that both of them were working uh so uh that's probably why they're absent so please remember them in pray would so amen so God Rich bless you amen it's good to have brother n with us sister Shirley so thankful that they come and think of us when they come this way I'm glad that uh he has his brother just right up the street they're able to come and spend a little time with us and uh so we're thankful that they're able to come and be with us and I don't blame them for coming in October it was a little warm this week but I think it's supposed to cool off next I asked for it to cool off it starts Monday then why didn't you come in July I would prefer to just come in July just from now just come in May and stay through August that would be perfect yeah heat of the of the year right yeah exactly you're G to bring cooler temperatures amen of course then they're going up to the mountains where is a lot cooler so but we're so thankful that they're with us today amen appreciate brother n and sister I have asked brother n if he would spend a couple of minutes I know got a message on his heart the anointing is for that uh but just a couple of minutes to update us on what they went through maybe and what they saw in the church there the Bible Tabernacle with Joe um there with the hurricane and the flooding and all that went place there so thankful to have him so if he would just go ahead and come we're going to sing only believe brother comes to minister for us today [Music] all all things are [Music] possible all things are possible [Music] so before I get into the message they asked me to fill in um the problem that we had in our area was there was a storm system that moved across the Appalachians we got 16 Ines of rain in a week so that was all up in the mountains and so the ground was saturated and then the day after that ended more or less ended that's when the hurricane came through and the wind that that generated was enough to there are areas in where we live where there are acres of trees that are laying flat wow I mean Acres wow there's one guy he had a long driveway probably a quarter mile you know we had to cut 200 200 trees out of off of their driveway so they could get home on we had incidences where we had the I'm a volunteer fireman and so working with them we one road we had to help clear and we would get to one area we would spend a half an hour to go 20 ft and then we would go quarter mile maybe another half an hour or more to you know to clear that Tre and all we were doing was a get so emergency vehicles get through wow um we were without power for two weeks um and then after we got our power back then it was two or 3 days before uh AT&T can come by and reestablish our internet phone service um the church above us Pentecostal Church they were nice enough to feed breakfast and dinner to anybody who wanted because of we we have a helicop landing pad at the fireplace fire department um um the the National Guard used that pad and they we had one day we had three Shooks drop bring water and food and then the following day they brought two more loads wow um when people found out that we we could distribute um then all of a sudden people began to bring other supplies and and but then the church above us which is the Pentecostal Church they became the distribution point for almost everything after that um they had the space they had the facilities they had the people um the problem that we had in our area in one town uh Chimney Rock um there was a 30 foot wall of water that came down the river used to be just a stream yeah it literally wiped out the town there are areas that there was no access um so they were delivering things by mule M had helicopters come in and lift people out of that town just to bring him to safety um one guy he owned a bulldozer and his the road was gone so he just took his bulldozer and he made a road wow somebody asked him the Department of Transportation approved he said who cares yeah we need a yes you know um but we were fortunate we um because of part of the fire department they used the refrigerator to keep water cold but they didn't use the freezer part so we took a lot of our freezer stuff stuck in that freezer we didn't lose but maybe $20 worth of grocery sign which okay that's it's all the stuff you open up salad dressing so but we were we were really quite fortunate um there are other areas they say that it's going to take weeks just to clear it's going to take months or almost years to rebuild yeah sure I mean the devastation was that bad and like I say it was because of the rain that beforehand that um when the hurricane came by the wind like like our our fire assistant fire chief they when they have a National Emergency the county requires the police the fire departments to be to to stay man you had to be fully man but there had to be people there well our assistant chief was there they got a call about 1 1:30 or something like that that some trees were down so they went out to cut the trees and about that time the wind picked up W and uh the assistant chief said there were trees falling in front of him behind him because it was dark he could not see where they were coming from and so he called up the other crew could have the other brush truck and said we are here we need you to come and cut us out wow because of a tree had falling on where they were at uh the assistant chief didn't figur he was going to live I mean he was and after that they de said let's go to the fire department hunker down until daylight and from that point on on Friday um we spent all day clearing Road um like I say Chimney Rock no longer exists um there other areas Bridges were totally wased way there was there were two there two or three there are two or three um towns which there is no access there is no access and people lost their homes one person um he was a Soler there was 11 people that died of his family because of a Mudslide that buried the house so he was the Soul Survivor of this house and so and because the wind came from a direction other than the than the prevailing winds the Trees of ours that fell down they fell away from our house but if they had been the prevailing winds it would have taken our our home and would have flat so God was gracious amen we acknowledge that it's also interesting that the that the we part of a Senior Choir on most people are 50s 60s and older one guy's almost 100 I think he's 10 uhuh 104 104 okay and nobody of that group I mean yeah they had sustained they lost trees but they never lost homes they never lost their cars they never lost anything value so to speak our church there was nobody that had lost anything and U so we're we're we're very grateful that God watched over us take care of us amen proving us yes praise the Lord why don't we stand and we'll just sing one more song um just to change the sequency and let's just do only believe again [Music] amen all things are possible [Music] all things are possible [Music] praise the Lord Heavenly Father we are grateful that we were able to come yes Lord we're grateful Lord for the traveling mercies you've given to usen thank you Lord for many blessings you bestow upon us but now Lord has come the time when we Minister your word to your people yes it's not my words it's not my thoughts yes Jesus but Lord let it be your words that are spoken this morning Let It Be You ministering unto your people ministering unto that which was a part of you from the beginning thank you Jesus so take me Lord as your instrument this morning and use me to minister unto your children to your family that Lord we might realize the hour We're living but also realize Lord who we are because of you and Grant this for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen while you're standing if you'd open to the Gospel of John the 17th chapter read verses 20 to 23 John the Gospel of John Chapter 2 chapter 17 read verses 20 to 23 you know when I was raised in the Baptist Church I was told I was a sinner that was the emphasis saved by grace well I still am a sinner saved by grace but this message began to tell me something that I'm more than just that amen that I am a Son of God and I've been restored back to my my rightful position with my heavenly father and to me the God sent a prophet in this generation to tell me who I am Amen in John 17 says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word and that they may all that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they may also be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me have I given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has has sent me amen and has loved them as thou Hast loved me amen you can be seated you know one of the things when I was began to do the I was doing a series Indy I Minister there every other week by Zoom it saves on air you know yeah but anyway we get to the thing here in Paul or Jesus Christ this is just before his crucifixion and he was praying for Unity amongst the people among amongst the disciples amen but he's saying here I want I want Lord he he's praying to the Father which dwelt in him he says I want I want this group of people I want these disciples and those which will believe on me through through their word I want them to be one in the same way that we are one amen well see this is something that is not stressed in the denominational system to me God is out you know when I was in the Baptist Church God was out there someplace and if I was a good little boy and I did what I was supposed to do eventually I'd go to a nice place of retirement called heaven and and everything would be nice but here is telling me that God is going to come and live in me yes and the same way that that spirit of God dwelt in Jesus Christ is the same way that that God now dwells inside of me amen and this is a concept which is foreign to the to the to the denominational churches and it's nothing against them but see God had to send a prophet because he has to prepare Bride for a Rapture amen and if you're not part of God if you're if God does not live inside of you there's no way for you to prepare yourself to become to be raptured right and God's power transformed brother B makes an interesting statement he said Jesus Christ was God himself manifested amen because he was a son because he was the begotten but it was just a tabernacle for him to live in amen God built himself a house a body to live and he come down so that you so you could touch him but Jesus Christ was just God God placed in Mary what was necessary to bring forth a body that God could come and dwell inside of Amen when Jesus Christ was born he was the son of God because of who he was because he was a part of God now manifested he was the lust which took on human flesh but but Jesus God had to come in there so he could become our kinsman redeemer God had to come in that body that Tabernacle of Jesus Christ so that not only could he become our kinsman redeemer but so we could actually see God yes yes we could actually experience God Amen and and and and and and when you begin to go through the gospels and you begin to look at Jesus Christ and who he was and how he was and how he acted how he interacted with other people this the the the the the Jewish Nation could not accept him because they had God up there someplace they had God Almighty all powerful all knowing all you know all this other and and all of a sudden to see a man claiming to be a Son of God right this was beyond their comprehension sure but see now it's coming down to us because where does God dwell if you have received the Holy Spirit God dwells in you am this eternal all sufficient all powerful Everlasting being yes dwells in you amen and he's not out there someplace no but he's actually inside of you and he wants to express his life through you amen but the only way he can do that is you have to give him the preeminent Jesus Christ he say Jesus Christ he says it's not me who does the work he says it's the father who dwells in me amen he does these works right brother Brown says he he said he said when God came and and the the the discernment and and the Miracles and stuff he says it wasn't me doing any of this he says I was merely standing there when God did amen right but see we have to realize see this is the position that we are in it's not about us it's about him right it's not what we do for God it's what we allow him to do through us but in order for him to work through us he have we we have to yield ourselves to the god that dwells in Us in the same way that Jesus Christ yielded to the Father which dwelt in him amen and and and this is this is the thing that we this is what I've been concentrating on this is the thing that God has been dealing with me or been been trying to show me praise the Lord and in the smon church age brother of Adam he makes a statement he says now then we're coming to a conclusion as Eternal as Eternal logos the word God himself was manifested in the son and in Jesus Christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead bod and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained the title of son and so here he's brother Bram is trying to relate what was Jesus Christ he was the tabernacle that God dwelt in amen he was he was the father himself he was this eternal all sufficient all powerful one he was the logos he was he he was he was he was the Eternal God now living in this Tabernacle we call Jesus Christ amen but then he goes on he says so see he says see now as we look at Jesus Christ we realize how God dwelt in him he says now we so he's taking us and beginning to he's beginning to let us to understand we also were a part of God from the beginning amen we also were an attribute of God we were also in the mind of God we're also a thought of God yes in the process of time we came into manifestation we are not Jesus Christ right but we are a manifestation of a thought of God because in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh the word there is logos right well logos is a thought expressed amen Jesus Christ was a thought expressed he was the logos expressed yes and and but see now it it pertains to us also we are now this logos Express we are a thought of God that now came into manifestation it does not make us Jesus Christ right but it make but it comes to the place we realize that we were a part of God and now that God that dwelt in Jesus Jesus Christ now he dwells in us and he dwells in us for the same purpose so he can express himself through US amen amen so he says even even so we eternally in his thoughts in our turn became the many many membered spoken word see manifested in flesh uh and and those Eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called he says we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the re reason we could be quickened and nonseed there's nothing to Quicken amen so what God has done before the foundation of the world he chose us when we were born he put his seed in us right what is a seed it's it it's it's it's the seed is the life that that God has planted in US yeah okay it's a part of God that dwelt in us from the time of our birth Amen in fact actually it dwelt in us really before the foundations of the world but we can't relate to that before the foundation of the world because I had no thought of what I was back then right but we have to begin to realize we are a thought of God Express God placed his seed in me amen and what is a seed the seed is is a life of God but then when you begin to look at a seed when you begin to look like a when you you guys like to have Gardens you take a for for using with just corn you take a corn and you put it in the ground but see that corn has within it a life right and there's a life inside of that corn there's wanting to manifest itself yes but the shell of the shell that contains that life has to break open it has to die it has to degenerate yes and only when it degenerates can it can it allow the life that is in it to come into manifestation right but see that's where it comes down into us we have a life sitting in us and that life is the life is the life of God Amen but the shell that's what we live in has to die yeah has to be able to yield itself into the life that dwells in in it so that the life that is in us can come into manifestation and the more we are able to yield to the god that is in us that's that is the only way that the god that dwells in us can come and be able to manifest and express himself through US Amen in Galatians 4 it's uh 4:1 Paul is making a statement he said now I say that an heir as long as he is a child nothing but a servant though he be Lord of all yeah what are we heirs to we are going to rule and reign with Christ amen that is that that is what what we we are destined to do this is in the Millennium and eventually we after the Millennium I'm not sure what what we'll be doing but but still that we we are God himself dwells in us because he dwells in us all the power of God is there amen but he but we cannot access that or we cannot manifest that until we learn until we are trained yes you don't you don't take a a 4year old and give him the keys to the car and says here son have some fun right you don't give him a you know you don't give him a gun you know here go go shoot some squirrels or you know no he has to be trained right amen I know most a lot of where where we live everybody hunts I mean this is this is this the way they do I mean they were doing it from the time that they you know Four 3 four years old right but they have to be trained so they normally they give him a BB gun or they give them something else which is basically harmless but as the kid learns and he he learns um he learns to respect that weapon then the the father would give him a 22 or give him something else right and then all then when he gets older yeah then he gives him 30 out sixes and 30 30s and 270s what I don't know the different guns but he but all of a sudden dealing with something that you can shoot a deer and you can kill it yeah well you you have to but you have to be trained amen you just don't give a child you know a weapon and all of a sudden here have some fun right because he doesn't know that he doesn't have the responsibility doesn't have the knowledge on on how to how to handle that exactly so anyway going back into Galatians he says um he says so but we were under tutors and governors until the assign appointment of the father and he goes on so even so we we when we were children were under bondage to the elements of the world we were under bondage to our flesh because this is what we contact the world with right but when the fullness was time was come God sent forth a son made a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons a son that is adopted has has the same privileges and Authority as the father does right and brother brand he talks about that but because we were born in sin because we were because we are we were subject to the world because we were subject to our fleshly nature we had to be redeemed something had to come along and and make us so that we so that we could be restored back to what we were in God from the beginning amen and only when we are restored can we actually come back and become adopted Sons because that's what we are going to be once once the Rapture take place amen yes and he says and because you are Sons God sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father therefore you are no more a servant but a son a son and an heir of God through Christ amen because you were a part of God from the beginning that's why God gives you his Spirit yes when he when you receive his Spirit then you begin to recognize you're are some you are part of something which is greater than yourself yes you begin to realize you actually are a part of God himself because you are an expression of that I am an expression of my Earthly father amen I have a lot of mannerisms and and and a lot of other things that way my dad acted the way he expressed himself yeah that's the same in me because genetically I'm he's my father right but see now God also God spiritually speaking is my father and he's trying to restore me back to what I was in him before there was the fall before we were put in temples of clay before we had to deal with this fleshly nature because the fleshly nature is contrary unto God we have to learn how to take our our nature and and and have it die if you will so that we can so that we can come to the place where God can live and express himself through US amen when I when I look at water baptism if you want to become a Christian first you have to repent of your sins realize that you are a sinner realize that that you know you have problems you have fleshly desires that you need to deal with so we accept Jesus Christ as your savior because you're wanting to change and then after that then then you go and and you make a public declaration through water baptism and in water baptism when you when you go in there normally speaking we ask the person have you accepted Christ because without that water baptism means nothing right but then when you when we baptize you you are going down you're a dry Sinner and you're coming up a wet Christian because you are declaring I have died right it it it's easier to put you under the water than this to bury you 4T under or 6 feet under and put a casket and put the dirt on top and try and dig You Up 3 days later because that's difficult I mean people don't survive that too well water yeah water is much easier okay but still the Declaration is the same yes you are saying I've died yes it's no longer me living and now I'm going to be I am going to live and I'm going to live for God I'm going to live for God Alone yes I'm going to submit myself to what God's will is for my life I'm going to give up my future I'm going to give up my plans I'm going to give up everything that I was striving to do so that I might I might live for God and follow his his follow his precepts and let his life live itself through me amen we look at the life of Paul I mean Paul he was he wanted to be part of the San hadrin he he wanted to be part of the ruling the ruling group that ruled ruled Judaism and he was well on his way but then he met Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus and Paul said I I've taken everything that I have all of my future all of my plans he says I gave it away just for the for the Excellency of just knowing Jesus Christ right but see this is where we have to come in our relationship we have to be willing to follow him yes we have to be follow willing to follow what he wants us to do amen it's no longer my will it's no longer my desires it's no longer my plans no God what do you want me to do and that and that's that's to me that's where we have to have to come but when we talk about Redemption Redemption is kind of an interesting thing Paul or in in God through Moses wrote down in Leviticus 25 and it talks it talks about if if a a child of of a of a family okay all of a sudden he's poor and he and he he sells himself into slavery well the only person that can redeem him has to be somebody he's related to right I cannot redeem any of your kids right because I'm not related right I can redeem mine but I can't redeem yours well it applies now in Us in Jesus Christ amen we have to have been part of God from the beginning right we have to be a child of God we have to be a Son of God God came in Jesus Christ so he could become our kinsman redeemer so that he could die on the cross so he could redeem us back to what we were in God before the fall amen but you have to be born again you have to be part of God's family if you're not part of God's family you are not redeemable yes you can be saved yes but redeemed no this implies something different right brother bradam going on in this morning church he say hold this carefully in mind he says redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner of God by his death the shed blood brought back his own he brought back the spoken word s s bride say my sheep hear my voice which is the word and they follow me you always were sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep right that's impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind of life and there's no change in species so as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice would become aware of our father calling us and to recognize that we are the sons of God Amen and I see lot I lot of people and I hear a lot of people declaring oh yeah I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God well if you are then you'll begin to act like your father yes if you're still in the world doing the things of the world I'm sorry there's something that's missing in here amen either there hasn't been the commitment either there hasn't been the acceptance of of what God had did at the cross but once you are redeemed and you realize God is your father then God himself comes and dwells inside of you and it begins to bring a transformation within the individual amen um I mean I can look back in my life and I was a renegade um I wasn't always a good boy I mean there were times my dad got very upset and after he wore out my bottom end I had to stand up and eat my my dinner it was too short to to sit okay but I was always his son yes that never changed amen and my dad may not have been happy with me some days but he loved me because I was his son yes there was other Kids on the Block that my dad didn't always speak well of because they misbehaved and he didn't care for them but he wasn't their father amen okay so the Same Love relationship I have with my father they did not have that relationship with my father as I had because my father loved me he didn't love those other kids okay and so you have to begin to understand when when we are when we believe that we are a son and daughter of God we have to understand this love relationship that exists between us yes I if um Paul or no David said in one of the places in in Romans I think is blessed is the god who will not impute sin where God will no longer keep record of you of your mistakes and I was thinking about that he redeemed us and when he redeemed us he took care of all of our sins and all all he paid the price totally but then if God would keep record of of our sins then all of a sudden somebody would have to die again to pay for those sins because it's you go down to the bank and you get a loan okay there's you you owe a debt yeah well when you pay off the debt that's fine but then you go down you get a loan for something else now you have another debt and sometimes you might have a debt for the car and the house and okay somebody has to pay these debts well this is fine but if as long as there is a record you owe you owe somebody has to pay that amen but so what God has done is once he has redeemed us he paid once and for all the price for our Redemption he paid for the price for all of our sins but that he will no longer charge you for the debt amen you make another mistake he doesn't charge you for that debt right there's I mean if you make a mistake yeah you will when I made a mistake yeah my my dad would correct me okay when David made a mistake with basba God corrected him but yet God never imputed on the long term that debt right because if he had imputed that debt then all of a sudden if God if God imputed to us every time we made a mistake that he would have to come back to the cross and he would have to die again for this for my mistake amen that's why he doesn't impute I don't know if I'm making any sense on that but we have to understand the freedom we have you know the other thing when I looked at a person being redeemed yeah he the guy sold himself to slavery and we were sold into slavery to our flesh and to Satan but you know once he was redeemed he was free yes he didn't have to go work he didn't have to he didn't he no longer had the task master now he could return to this property that he had now he could return to to doing what he what what he wanted to do he was totally free from all of the debt from all of the obligations that he had sold himself into amen but you see now we're free yes Satan has no right to us amen right we're we we we are totally free true we make mistakes sure we do and and he will correct us according according to those things but we have to understand that the only and only as we submit to Satan can Satan rule us amen only as we take our fleshly desires and we let them rule only then can Satan sit there and use our fleshly desires against us and put us back into bondage right amen and and and this is I mean one of the things we we notice especially with drug addiction all they start out and somebody they claim to have been their friends they get him into drugs and all of a sudden and and there's a there's a demon that comes with that right but once you accepted Christ then all of a sudden okay you are you should be free from that bondage free from that demon but if your flesh still desires that drug there's still the bondage there so sometimes you have to overcome it every day right amen you have to overcome it every day finding this out with one of our grandsons sure um but anyway but you we have to understand we have to understand the only way we can overcome anything is we have to get into Christ amen we have we have to want to worship him we want to get into his presence we we want to praise him we want to do things which are pleasing to him right okay amen and the more that we get into his presence and the more that we worship him yeah then then the more of our Focus becomes on him and less of the focus comes Upon Our flesh true Amen in the breach between the church ages and seals brother Brown says the title to the earth into eternal life when Adam forfeited it then Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to the original owner which was God himself when Adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of the faith it went back to the hands of the owner almighty God Amen so what's it doing in the hands of God is was waiting for the Redemption for the Redemption claim he made a way of redemption he made a way back and somehow the and someday the Redeemer is going to take going to take us back and this we're talking here about the Rapture until the Rapture until the changing of my body my body still has its desires sure every time I think yeah doctor says you better lose some later you know and yeah I agree with him yeah yeah yeah but I tell my body I'm going to go on a diet yeah then the battle starts yeah then the battle starts right because all of a sudden the things that yeah I could pass up before oh no oh man I see that cake and eyes Okay because my flesh is say hey you used to enjoy it why not now you know but I'm trying to do something oh no well I I have my desires and you have your desires and we're going to battle this out yeah and anyway that's why the way I am but we have to begin to understand once we get into Jesus Christ once our Focus becomes him then our Focus becomes totally different than the things of the world right this was like in the life of Paul all of a sudden when he when he met Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus from that point on he says I gave up everything for the Excellency of knowing Jesus Christ amen but see that should be in the same way in our lives for the Excellency of knowing Jesus Christ we should be willing to give up everything yes and focus totally upon upon him amen yes and legal um the legal possessions of the abstract means that that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost and we I look at that and we begin to say well Adam was an amateur God Adam had whatever he spoke that's what happened but see before the fall he could see into the other realm he could see the angels and he had free access to God and he knew the will of God yes and because he knew the will of God he could speak speak and whatever he spoke he realized God would honor what he had spoken because of the relationship that he had with God yes right but after the fall that other dimension was cut off from him right then he did not know what God's will was right and therefore he could not have the faith to speak it and and believe that God would would answer that um and but here again it comes down to what we are every everything that Adam could do before the fall we have the possibility within us to do that yes Jesus Christ I me he sent the disciples ahead and he said you know and all of a sudden they were on the road they in a boat going across the Sea of Galilee and all of a sudden Jesus needed to get to where they were going so he just walked on the water amen well I've tried that a few times and I I don't do well I I get I sink okay but Peter found out the same same thing Jes all of a sudden Jesus was walking by and hi guys how's is it going oh yeah we and all said ah this is a spirit this is a spirit and then Peter being what he is if that's you let me come to where you are right Jesus is fine come on yeah he stepped out of the boat he walked on the water amen as long as his eyes was on Jesus Christ yes he walked amen but when he looked at the tempests and the waves and all of a sudden he began to realize this is not natural he began to sing yes and then he cried out to Christ and Christ down his hand and picked him up and they both walk back to the boat yes but see if the eyes are on Jesus Christ instead of ourselves with the eyes is on Jesus Christ instead of our desires and and and we and the circumstances around us then we have the ability to overcome things then we have ability liter to walk on the water amen we find out in in with with Jesus Christ I mean he could take fishes and Loaves and he could break the he could break he could take he could take this kid's lunch and he could feed a multitude yes but we've had incidences in in in in uh one of the guys was talking about one of the guy one Aaron's father was missionary to Mexico and then some people came and they made a pot of of soup and all of a sudden they were expecting maybe 40 50 people and all of a sudden when 150 people show up um how are we going to feed all these people we only planned for so many the report came back that that after feeding 150 people the pot had never gone down amen every time they dipped it in there was more they dipped it in there was more they dipped it in there was more am well this is this is this is a possibility why because of who we are yes right there was a need God saw that need God supplied that need the Miracles are not just the Old Testament the num Miracles are not just in G the time of Jesus the Miracles are are event even evident even today yes amen we know one guy that he preaches at our church periodically when he was born he was missing some bones in his ankle he went and Henry green I think was the one who prayed for him and all of a sudden God created the bones that were missing yes so he could walk normal amen um I mean we've seen things in India where where we have gone and we have ministered and stuff like that we've seen God perform Miracles yes right amen it's not limited to the Ministry it's not limited to a special group of people right but there has to be the ability to believe amen and this is the limiting factor right if you can believe like we sing the song all things are possible only believe and we sing the song oh yeah that's a nice song but do we actually have the reality that if you believe it right then you can ex then then God will will act upon what you believe God will act he's the high priest of our confession you confess it well then God would then Jesus Christ intercedes on our behalf and and and we can expect and we can expect what we have asked for because he's there to intercede on our behalf he there pleading our case so to speak amen but see God doesn't dwell up in heaven someplace he dwells here yes he dwells in every one of you well all you have to do is have this relationship with Jesus Christ if you have that relationship with Jesus Christ and you know him and and and and and you begin to understand who he is and who you are because of him then you can begin to you can begin to go through the scriptures and you can find the promises which are in the word and you can begin to claim them for yourself amen Bible says by his stripes I'm Healed okay God can't lie so obviously I am yes um so sometimes we get sick and well uh yeah I mean I've gone to bed for a couple three days letting the body repair itself but then they're like with my wife she would we were at a youth at a youth camp and she slipped and fell into a shower and she messed up her shoulder by the time that evening came she couldn't lift her arm we finally went to see a a see a doctor orthopedic surgeon and he took x-rays and he says well I really don't want to do surgery why don't we try giving they call it physical exercise or physical therapy it's physical torture but and but she did that for a couple of weeks about that time we had our our our annual camp meeting and I think it was a second day or something like that all of a sudden the spirit of God moved through the audience before she could lift her arm like this after that she were both of her arms up and she began to praise God Amen right got instantly healed praise the Lord I look at my my younger brother I mean he had a heart attack if it hadn't been that the doctor was already prepping to do a to do a heart cath on on somebody my brother would have died it was because it was the main artery yeah and anyway so because they got him here and they saw my brother was in the midst of having a heart attack so they just wheeled him into the operating a and just you know they did it yeah well that was uh that was on Thanksgiving a few years back and anyway so I took I'm retired so I don't have punch clock anyway so we came in December and I we stayed with him basically for a whole month to help him out and you know and to do what we could to encourage and my brother was slowly gaining strength he could not walk to the mailbox mailbox was well yeah mean maybe a quarter mile away because where he lived but he began to walk and he says no got to go back he said he had church service and yeah he he could stand up for one song after that he had to sit he did not have the energy but then one of the services all of a sudden God says stand up and praise me so he did yeah the next day that week he went saw his doctor the cardiologist he says wow he says your heart's the same as a 20-y old amen praise the Lord so I mean you know I mean this is I it happened in my family I I mean I know these things this isn't something that I've heard or read about no this is the reality of what I see praise the lord well that gives me the faith to believe well if you can do it for them you can do it for me amen and and but here again you have to beli that The God Who made the Abraham believed that the God who had made the promise to him that God was able to bring it to pass yes and that's what I look at well God this is your word this isn't my word this isn't the word of the pastor no this is what you yourself have said yes well if you have said it and it's a promise to me then then you are now under obligation to me to fulfill your word in my life praise the Lord and this is what Abraham he had to wait 25 years to get the promised son but he never failed to believe what God had promised God was able to to bring to pass amen and this is where we have to come right yes in the revelation of Jesus Christ brother ban makes a statement he says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless he said Satan knows that that and there's four things we have to realize here Satan knows that if the people can get a true revelation of the true church you have to have that Revelation right yes you have to know who what what is the true church it's the body of Jesus Christ amen that is the true church okay so you have the people have to get the true revelation of who the true church is which is which is the body of Christ and then what what does this true church stand for she stands for the word amen she stands for the word that God has delivered to the bride in in their gener praise the Lord okay okay and and then and also and what what she is which means she has to believe that she's she's part of the body of Christ and what she stands for which happens to be the word and then the last part is the hardest part for us to to accept and to deal with and she has to believe that she can do the Greater Works amen yes sir and that's where we tend to draw back from do we actually believe that the god that had made the promise is able to do these Greater Works through US amen because we look at ourselves well what am I who am I why should God do why should God honor my word why should God do the things that I'm asking him to do right right because you're his child amen because he dwells in you why did he dwell in Jesus Christ so he could man Express himself to the world yes why is he dwelling within the bride so he can express himself to the world there's no difference here amen but you have to be willing to understand what God is trying to accomplish and you have to be able to realize that the god that is in you wants to live and to manifest himself through you amen it's not about you it's about him it's not you performing The Miracles it's allowing him to do it through you it's not you doing something for God it's it's you dying to yourself so that the god in you can live his life and express himself through you amen it's not about us it's about him yes if we focus on him instead of on us then everything then it changes praise the Lord I mean yeah we get up we we have aches and pain the older you get the more that you seem to accumulate them but you have to begin to understand that the god that dwells in me is more than able to take care of me amen yes and I and anyway but I have to believe that he will do that yes okay and once we once we believe that we God can actually do that through us then we become this invincible Army Invincible means undefeatable which means Satan will attack us and we just say get out of here I don't want to you around right I mean another kind of a humorous thing kind of sort of um Satan Satan was causing my wife to cough I mean she just coughed and coughed and coughed and coughed well it was bedtime I like to sleep that okay I can't sleep when she's coughing so she was nice enough to go in the front room and try and sleep on the the easy chair and I was trying in bed to sleep but she was coughing so loud keeping me awake imagine that and so I got mad not at her I got mad at Satan Satan you're causing my wife to cough that's keeping me awake Satan get out of here amen she quit coughing we got to go to sleep amen I mean I mean it sounds humor but really I we because of who we are because God dwells in us we have authority over Satan amen we have the ability to tell Satan to pack his bags and get out yes and he he doesn't have to obey me he has to obey the word yes and and if what I'm speaking is the word of God to him he has to obey because I have the authority over him amen because Jesus gave disciples Authority he says go into the villages round about you heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Dem I've given you that Authority now freely use it he never took that back amen well so I still have that Authority we all have that Authority yes it's not just the preacher amen it's every single person yes sir that Authority rests within sight of you amen true and the Philadelphia Church brother Brown says please remember that in the Stant age started the Reformation that must go on on until the grain that was planted at Pentecost goes goes through the full cycle of planting watering and nourishing until it comes back to the original seed the seed that was planted at and what was the seed it was Christ yes that's what was planted at Pentecost now that seed has to come to full expression full manifestation and who what is he going to come to full manifestation in in his body which is the bride amen and this but and but it has coming to the place now where that seed has to come to full manifestation and but we have to begin to realize who we are right amen we have to begin to realize I am the body of Jesus Christ I I I am I am I Jesus Christ let's see I am the body of Jesus Christ here on Earth because I am a part of him it doesn't make me Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ dwells inside of me and now what He is wanting to do is he's wanting in my body to be able to live and express himself through me yes but I have to allow him to have to have the preeminence to have the control right yes you know one of the things that do you realize you can stop God right say can't but you can because if God tells you to do something and you refuse then all of a sudden you stop God yes I mean we had a friend of ours that he had a he had surgery on his elbow and uh yeah the doctors did the best they could and now an infection set in well they treated with the antibiotics this that and the other and fin knew God told me he says you're not dealing with a physical problem now you're dealing with a spiritual problem Satan is what has causing that infections to remain amen so I drove to the hospital and uh we visited for a few minutes and he kind of wondered why are you here you know I mean it's we were friends it's not but I he knows how I hate to get to Charlotte I hate the traffic I hate C everything and why did you come I say well God sent me here because God told me he says we have a spiritual problem here that's a demon causing that infection amen so we cast out the demon yes and I went home and that's when the healing began right praise the Lord because I could I I could command it because I God sent me there for that purpose amen and I realized God sent me there for that purpose yes and if he said me there for that purpose that God will honor what I say because it's him amen it's no longer me yes right when we go on and we look at Revelations 10 he says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God's going to be going to come to completion going to be finished well what is this mystery of God Paul talks about it in one of his letters he says what is the mystery of God he says it's Christ Living in you amen because it's see under under the law God could not come and dwell in the people amen they were trying by their own efforts to live a law yes and that's people are still trying to do that today in Christianity right well I'm a Christian that means I have to live a certain kind of life I have to make sure I don't go certain places I got to watch my language so I don't say the bad things and and so that but that's Pharisees yes amen okay but when God lives inside of you and he begins to change your nature yes that's different yes because that's now that's the mystery of God but the mystery of God is going to come where as God dwelt in Jesus Christ and God was able to express himself totally through that man through that through that that body now he wants to do the same thing through US yes right Jesus Christ had to give the had to give the god that dwelt in him total preeminence total control amen now we have to give him total control also until that happens that's not going to work right amen I mean when I'm driving a car I have total preeminence most of the time um because I turn the wheel and goes that way I turn it goes that way I push on the gas goes up hit the brake and supposed to stop you know I have the preeminence yeah but all of a sudden now with these new electronic gadgets inside it'll do things that I'm not telling it to do true um okay but here again when I'm in control I have I have the preeminence in that vehicle well now I have to take this vehicle and give it give this give God that dwells in me the preeminent so he can drive this vehicle amen so he can guide it he can direct it he can instruct it and he can speak through it right okay because it goes on in in uh in Revelations 108 there was a command to John he said and a voice which I heard from Heaven spake to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel it standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and he said he went to the angel and and and John said to the angel give me the book and the angel said eat it until you and that book becomes the same well this is the book right and this is what we have to eat and so we and this becomes the same amen right you don't when when when normally speaking we eat two or at least two meals sometimes three meals a day because the body is demanding that we feed it okay if we would if we would feed on the word as much as we do on food then we would be further along in our Christian walk amen my opinion that's right um and when I study the word especially for ministering all of a I mean I get into the word and I try and research this and research that and all of a sudden I something strikes me and I figure wow this is great in fact I think before we came I was studying for these sermons and all of a sudden God revealed something to me and I got excited so I I she was fixing dinner so we were sitting I said no no just just put it out put it down just I got to share this with you yeah yeah because it excited me that much yeah but see when I get into the word now and all of a sudden God begins to open it and he's opening it more and more all of a sudden the excitement comes there because the anointing comes and his presence com amen and I'm living in a realm that's not mine that I'm not that I don't do all of the time it should but I don't but we have to begin to understand if we get into the word and he will open it to you amen not just the ministry right yes to the bride because you have to know the word you have to know what it says you have to get your you have to be get the revelation of who you are amen and the only way you're can get that Revelation is you have to get into the word you have to listen to what God has trying to tell us to the prophet right and it's not just listening to the message it's getting into this book amen yes amen right I mean I read this as much as I do anything else because it's a my my father taught me he says everything you believe you have to find in the pages of this book yes that's right everything yes so when brother Bron makes a statement I figured where's that in here not that I question right but this is my Foundation yes sir everything I believe I have to find it in here because on this I can rest yes anyway amen true and proving his word brother Banner makes a statement he said the bride is see the bride is called in the day when the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man and that's what God did in the prophet yes when he would stand there and through under the this was the revealing of the son of man this was God taking so much possession of that vehicle until that what what would that was no longer brother Brown speaking that was God speaking through him amen and when we get back to what we what we were reading here in our in our in our in our our text he says he says that they may be one Lord even you and I are one I and them and thou and me that they may be maybe maybe may may be made perfect in one but see God did that in the prophet my opinion but what did what was God trying to do he was trying to say you see if I can do this in him I can do it in you amen if I can so live in this man until until until he can yield himself unto me such that I can speak through him and I can Minister through him he says if I can do it in him who's a sinner saved by grace I can do it in you also right it's a different office I'm not disputing that I don't want that office but I also realize that The God Who dwells in me if I will yield myself to that God that dwells in in me that God in Me can express himself and manifest and if I will like he can speak he can speak his words through me amen that's right and God demonstrated that through the prophet he goes on he says it's a son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real until it'll unite the church and him as one amen the bride the one the bride and she'll go home to the wedding supper the when with the word when the word here unites with the person they too become one yes and this is the Oneness that that Jesus Christ was talking about to the disciples where we literally become one with him and when we become one with him it's no longer I who live but now it's Christ Living in me and you know it's interesting when God had taken Adam and he took him from theophany form and put him in in temples of clay the the other half of him which was e was still residing in theophany form at least that's my understanding but see Eve always was a part of Adam yes eventually God reached into Adam and took a part out out of Adam and made a body for Eve to live in right and God called their name Adam yes now it was Adam living in two bodies yes because she literally was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone amen well now you have to come and relate that to us in Jesus Christ he calls our name Jesus Christ yes because we are united with him God does not when God looks at a family he regard he he regards those two individuals as a single entity yes amen well now because we are part of Jesus Christ and we are his bride now he regards us as a single entity so when God looks at us when God looks at me all he's looking at is the body that I'm part of and that body is Jesus Christ and therefore I as righteous as he is righteous I'm as holy as he is Holy amen not because I am but because I in him right and being in him is what makes the difference amen amen and the latest here in church brother V makes this statement he he he says um the Lutheran spoke startor a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word and the Lutheran spoke for God at that time amen amen God was revealing himself through Martin Luther yes God was God was delivering a message to the bride through that individual yes but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization sin where dog was and treat he said and God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word at his sake and the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation yes so here again God God chose a man and through that man through John Wesley he he delivered through that man a message to to the Bride of his age yes and that was sanctification am claim to be a Christian you better start living likewise I mean that that was basically in so many words and the people listened to what God was speaking through him and they Sanctified themselves they cleaned up their lives and they began to live lives of Holiness and Purity when the method has failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there's again another people in the and who under their Messenger will be the final voice of the final age amen yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is it is his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her amen it's not just the prophet it comes to us right now we are the to be the final voice we are to be the final expression of God to this age amen what was the revelation God had given to brother Bram he says you are the sons of God you were a part of God from the beginning and because you were a part of God now you have come into manifestation because now you have come into manifestation and you are the part you are a part of God now you have to start living as as as a part of God Amen you have to realize who you are and what you are you have to realize what dwells inside of you I mean it you know it's it's what dwells inside of me it's the lust it's everything God is is amen dwells here not in fullness no we have electric circuits electric circuits is tied to a fuse box the fuse box will allow so much amperage to flow through it right okay I know we have in our trailer we have 10 amps 15 amps we have one that's 30 amp and 40 amp depending on the size of the wire actually um but in that F in there in theory you can access all of the power of God in America because of the the way wires are all connected the limiting factor is the fuse box well in us there is no between with us and God there is no fuse box right amen okay we have access to everything God Is Right what we speaking it can be him himself speaking through us there's no F but it the limiting factor is your ability to believe amen if you don't have much Faith you got a 5 a fuse yeah it doesn't take much to trip it yeah but then you start all of a sudden getting to know God and beginning to understand who you are because of Calvary and it already goes back to the Cross amen it's it's it's amazing to people that in in this message they have forgotten Calvary amen everything I need I find at the cross everything if I need healing there stripes if I need peace he paid for it I need salvation he paid for it for Redemption he bought me he redeemed me at the cross because I was a part of him everything I need is at the cross everything without exception true so I always go back to the Crossen because that that's my typos to God and every and everything that that that that he is amen yes sir it goes on ladies in church AG he says but now now he's standing in the midst of the church he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride God created you yes warts and all yes all of your mistakes and all of your shortcomings and all all of the the problems you have in your personalities and it's part of you that was in there God created you with that yes some of that you have to overcome some of that you have to bury some of that you have there's something within all of our lives there continually TR we're continually trying to overcome our flesh we're continually trying to overcome the the the the the the the um the nature the animal nature okay that we that we were born with amen okay we're constantly trying to overcome that and the only way to overcome that is to yield to The God Who dwells in US he can he is the only one that can overcome it but we have to yield to him in order for that to happen anyway amen he go of him it says l a body hast thou father prepared for me God not God not Mary provided that body Mary was the human incubator and she carried the holy child and brought him to birth he was a God man he was the son of God he was of a new creation man and God met and joined and he was the first of a new race he was the head of this new race and we have to realize this pertains to us yes you accept Jesus Christ as your savior you repent of your sins yes you go through water baptism declaring you've died to yourself and if your repentance was sincere then God will come and and God by his holy spirit he will come and inside of you amen the holy spirit is not the third person of a trinity the holy spirit is is is the logos now coming and living in you amen and so when you receive the the Holy Spirit when you receive that logos dwelling inight what are you you are the God man or the god woman because now God himself lives inside of you the same way it lived inside of Jesus Christ the same way lived in Paul and Barnabas and all the rest of the people in the same way he lived in brother Bram there's no difference here right the difference is our ability to be able to yield to The God Who dwells in US yes we become the limiting factor and that limiting factor because of our lack of faith right brother R goes on he says this new creation is not is not an old creation made over it could not be called a new creation it's exactly what it says it's a new creation it's another creation distinct from the old one out of every Kindred tribe of nation he has proposed a new creation he was the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man talking about Jesus Christ yes now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation amen God is creating himself in you yes he's transforming your character he's he's molding god worketh in me to willing to do of his good pleasure God is creating me into His Image amen I'm to be conformed to the very image of Jesus Christ yes but I have to be willing to submit to that process amen and that here again that that that become part of the problem but he said but he goes on he says this is the true revelation of God this was this was his purpose the purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down through the last age when when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them for the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will and by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass amen there's nothing about us right there's nothing about me doing this is all a work of God Amen and we have to understand this we have to be willing to submit to this yes you take a uh I I don't work with Clay but I work with we need to same glass and some other thing but but if you what I've seen with people with with with Clay what they do is they take a a lump of clay just piece of mud okay they throw it on a wheel they have in their mind what this is to be right and so they by molding and shaping and turning it around and around they are they are taking their image and bringing this plump of of mud into that very image amen well what's God doing with us he's taking this lump of mud and he's molding and making it into His Image amen but the mud has to be willing to submit right okay um the mud obviously doesn't have a choice but we do yes and so God is God has to work on us and he and he will put circumstances in our path to help us conform to His Image amen okay right yes the rising of the sun brother R he says he says that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what es proved he wasn't only the word word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word he says and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again yes and that's why God had to send a prophet it I mean I was raised in the Baptist Church nothing wrong with the Baptist Church but God to me was was something I read about oh yeah there's something about something called a god there's something about he Jesus talks about this about himself and that about himself and talks about different creatures and creators and different men know yeah he did nice things to different this one he you know but it's it was just in the book and the preacher would get up and the preacher would start telling us about this wonderful God who who's benevolent and he's going to be nice to you and he's going to supply this and Supply that okay but he dwells out there no brother Bram says no no it's not out there right here amen you have to take the god that that it's talked about in here and bring him into you amen and then when you take this God and put him inside of you and you begin to realize everything that he is now dwells inside of you amen that makes the difference yes it brings us one step it it it takes us from God being like I say out in the universe some place and this that and the other it takes and makes God to become a reality to us this is what I saw in the Prophet this why I saw in brother B that's that's why I listen to him that's why I I you know I have confidence in the man I could see God living through that man right well how could a man stand there and the thousands of times could he sit there and he could tell people where who they were where they live what they were coming where you know the problems that they were facing and the disease that they were they having go how could a man do that he had never seen these people right but he could yield himself to the God that was in him and because of the god dwelling in him could reveal to him what this person's name was where they live what their address wasn't the doctor that you know the always oh I see you I see you oh yeah you're have I see this doctor he's you know he's kind of a baldheaded man big thick glasses and stuff oh and he's talking to you oh he says you have this and this and this and this wrong with you and and he described the doctor he described the doctor's visit he even heard what the doctor was saying right okay that's not a man right yes that's God am amen well okay um and and I know other ministers and all of a sudden God speaks to them God gives them Visions God you know God God speaks to them in in in in the way that God deals with that individual well God deals with me in the way in my own way you know like I say when he wants to speak to me he has to wait till I'm almost asleep that's so any time he can actually get through my brain keeps okay but then he can get through because I'm I'm studying for a sermon I figure something's missing something's missing I keep thinking thinking thinking just as I'm drifting off to sleep that's what's missing to get up and right right right right but still not quite right and TR try to go back to sleep and this is I'm drifting off oh yeah that's the other piece of the puzzle so get up right right right right right you know and then when I get up in the morning I can look at my scribbles and oh yeah this is what God was trying to show me then I can put it all together I don't know how he works with other ministers but that's how that's how he deals with me but see God speaks to me in that way and there are other times all of a sudden we're doing something and all of a sudden I feel we need to go see this person it's just impressed upon me I need to go and see this person I need to go pray for this person he's not speaking to me but all of a sudden I have something that comes upon me and he's trying to direct me he's trying to say you need to do something I'm calling you to do something so that you can go and you can minister to this individual okay even if it's God's leading and God takes us there then when I'm there then it's no longer me being there now it's God doing whatever he wants to do through me to that person amen and it doesn't limit it to me or or the ministers this happens to a lot of people lot of I mean this is the Bride of Jesus Christ we are the body of God we are the body of which God self dwells amen and it's not just the third person of Eternity no it's the logos that's the essence of everything God is yes that's what you have access to because that's what lives inside of you [Music] amen he says now the whole world has to recognize he's alive and he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestation the fulfilling of all the revelations anything that was spoken of the bride because she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him a man and woman are one and a woman taken from his sight she had taken the spirit the feminine Spirit from him and that's why God created two bodies that's why Adam was living in two bodies because she was a part of him always well we always were a part of Christ we always were a part of God now we've come into manifestation and so here again this is the unity that Jesus Christ was talking about to his disciples I want you to be one the same way that I am the father are one what was it the father dwelt in him the same way that the father dwelt in him he says that's the same way I'm going to live I'm going to dwell in you and I'm going to dwell in you and I'm going to direct you and I'm going to guide you and I'm going to speak through you the same way that the father is doing this through me and this is where we have to come yes amen not just the ministry right the bride all of us this is where we have to come amen and and and it is I brother R says see Jesus said at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father is in me I in you and you in me it's God in you all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he has poured into the church so it's God above us God With Us and he says now it's God in us he said is God condescending coming down making his way that he could get back and bring his people back to me to make manifested sons of God like they had them in the Garden of Eden the whole world is groaning and waiting for that hour for the manifestation of the sons of God this is where we're getting to why is the world in a turmoil why are the judgments falling Upon This World why do we have to go through what we went through in North Carolina because it's God's judgment on this world yes well okay if it's time if God's judgment is being poured out upon the world and we're getting to the time when there when the Rapture is supposed to take place I need to become I I'm we are supposed to be coming to the manifestation of the sons and daughters daers of God Amen where God so lives in us and so it's no longer I who live but now God living his life through me yes amen I mean this is the manifestation of the sons of God the mystery of God is going to be completed what is the mystery it's Christ in you God so living in you until it's no longer you living but God himself living his life through you yes amen for the RAM and restoration of the Bride tree he says you will be part of me you'll be my bride my life will be in your body just as a husband or wife is one person you and I are going to be one at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father's in me I'm in you and you in me oh I love that Satan gets so angry with that see the Oneness of God all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church and there you are it makes them all one amen Jesus Christ was God himself manifested because he was a son because he was begotten but but it was just a tabernacle for him to live in no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father declared him God built himself a house a body to live in to come down so that we so that we could touch him so that he could manifest himself to the world Amen Jesus Christ was that Tabernacle that God dwelt in so that he could come and become our kinsman redeemer right and so that he could so that God through that vessel could manifest himself to the world Amen but now we are that tabac and now he's trying to do through us the same thing he did through that body we call Jesus Christ amen God bless you prise the Lord appreciate that today amen hopefully we take you to

yield to the Lord not just stick to notes but yield to the Lord to speak whatever God's anointing puts on him to speak and I can have confidence in a man like that because he's saying what the Lord's
