actually several prayer requests to mention to you today that we want to take to the Lord in prayer uh I got a text just a few minutes ago from sharah she said they're not feeling well uh today also uh em and Joel are home the families at home they're not feeling well uh Joel's got a sore throat also brother Dennis and brother Danny are home not feeling well today also so let's just remember all those not feeling well uh cold symptoms flu symptoms whatever they may be uh one of our guys from work came to work uh Monday morning first thing he came to work not feeling well uh fortunately for us uh we're usually scattered out outside or something so uh especially this past week we were all outside doing vacuums and of course the first two days it's bored down rain so we worked outside for two days in the cold rain uh but he wasn't feeling good when he got there but I think by Friday he was is feeling better uh but now we have several people here uh not feeling well the bosteros family Emma Joel uh Dennis Danny please remember them in prayer if you would as I mentioned uh Micah is still out of town he's in Miami today he finished with the cruise but uh still out of town they're supposed to he is supposed to be back Wednesday uh so I appreciate your prayers for a safe travel the Lord would just bless him and bring him back home safe to us uh we also have sister Lydia still out feel uh well she's supposed to have surgery next week I believe is that correct is it the the fifth the fifth right okay the fifth so uh please remember sister uh lyia in prayer she's supposed to get the finalization of that process uh did she still have the TU and no two was gone so please remember uh sister Le in prayer also sister Karen finally got her surgery date is supposed to be March 14th uh so please remember Sister Karen in prayer uh still in a lot a lot of pain uh but certainly appreciates our prayers I'm sure without the prayers of the Saints uh it would have just probably been more than unbearable so but please remember Sister Karen in prayer without a without divine intervention and miracle for either one of them uh they're going to be uh having procedures done surgeries hip replacements so please remember them uh in prayer if you would as well uh also I had heard earlier and sister Norma sent me a text this morning about sister Dorothy up in the mountains uh sister Carol Carpenter's mother uh she got home from her sister's I guess did did did she pass away I didn't hear so she's still so sister uh Dean Hart's still alive U so Joanne dehart they expected her die the family went out but uh but I guess she's still living I hadn't heard she had passed so so she's not passed so but Dorothy got home and as soon as she got home basically she wasn't feeling well went to the doctor Hospital found she had double pneumonia uh so sister Dorothy's pushing 90 I guess now she's up she's 86 86 inital oh she's in Phoenix okay so um please remember Sister Dorothy in prayer double pneumonia enough to get pneumonia uh when you're young but double pneumonia when you're old is uh not not not a very good thing so please remember Sister Dorothy in prayer for you I know many of you some of you know her many of you do not but please remember Sister Dorothy in prayer the Lord would just touch and heal her uh as well amen praise the Lord that's all I have on my list here uh so just thankful the Lord Jesus bless us and uh continues to be with us amen you have an unspoken request in your heart the Lord knows all of our needs today and certainly does let's stand to our feet if we could he is a mindful God Amen he knows all of our requests all of our needs before they aay needs amen praise the Lord so ask brother Pat brother if you would take these needs to the Lord for

read the word of God and know what it is that you are amen bless us Lord yes Jesus we ask that you he'll always request yes in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you'd like amen God is mindful I want to give a testimony uh appreciate the Lord's blessing for safe travel uh to California and back thank the Lord for blessing the flights non-stop flights but thank the Lord uh for blessing the flights and having a good week uh doing real good Friday Friday was a rough day put in over 15 hours uh the rest of the week was actually fairly easy um a couple of days in the rain weren't very much fun but uh got soak and wet for a couple of days and working out the rain but um the Lord bless Wednesday the sun came out it was beautiful for three days but Friday was a little rough uh and actually both my knees are swollen today U the right one just a little bit right one and I thought my goodness just falling apart and then um I was in the shower I I my hands always get will only feel like little sausages right now when I co them up I can't even come close to taking my ring off when I'm normal I can take it on and off uh can't even come close and my feet are swollen my feet are hurting inside these shoes right now so I think well a lot of stuff is swollen so maybe not necessarily about the knee uh just uh when you put your body through so much it I guess it just happens or it does to me anyway but uh I'm thankful the Lord blessed the trip and had a safe trip and uh back back home and thankful that can take a week's rest so the Lord's been good so I appreciate God's goodness amen praise the Lord I good a testimony Amen brother Pat yes u u i have a neighbor um that we we knew about Paul who passed away he he beat cancer but then passed away I have another neighbor a couple more doors down that had terminal cancer and they gave him six months to live and uh he went to the hospital and he was bleeding and and something and I couldn't get into the hospital to see him but I was driving down the road I seen him out in the yard I pulled in there I said man you look good and he said he's 80 something years old then he said what I don't have cancer anymore amen praise the Lord praise the the Lord the one that was supposed to die is living and he's free praise the Lord amen his sisters out there planting plants we pray for them a few months back yeah I remember you mentioned them even before Paul passed away I remember that I remember that praise the Lord you don't have cancer anymore wow amen they check God is answerers nothing to the Lord amen praise the Lord amen like I said when you're a Christian uh you can call it cancer you can call it co you can call it whatever because I got I got so tired of people saying cancer took so and so or Co took so and so no they didn't if they're a Christian the Lord took them took them home now whatever vehicle he used to do it with that's his choice whatever he decides amen but if you belong to him We're In His Hands praise the the devil can't touch you amen without God's permission and if he does there's a reason for it so amen we just trust him in that and all things so praise the Lord that's wonderful amen yeah sister she uh I can yeah Donovan um was it Thursday I can't remember this past week uh sister Lydia's grandson who she calls Bubby uh Donovan um had a real bad belly ache and so he got so bad they took him to the Hospital Emergency Care uh found out he had appendicitis so they were supposed to take him in that night I believe it was Thursday night uh for surgery uh but they didn't get into the doctor until the next morning uh and I guess they had the surgery I believe correct had the surgery and he's doing a lot better now uh Sonia told me yesterday that she said he's going to uh Jennifer his mother said he's going to be back to eating his favorite Chick-fil-A so uh hopefully he doesn't feel like eating Chick-fil-A today because it's not open today unless they took some and put in the fridge uh but uh he's doing really good like I said uh he's the one thing the one thing I guess he was looking forward to is being able to eat his Chick-fil-A again so thank the Lord for that God bless I mean we've had times where people have had things like that happen and rupture or something and poison in their body and even kill people so amen just thankful the Lord touched and helped him through this situation amen my granddaughter got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ last week amen praise the Lord praise the Lord Jesus amen didn't know there were very other denominations that would do that I knew when we were coming coming up with the kids there was some places back in North Carolina oldfashioned places and they called themselves Baptists but they really weren't Baptists and they baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and I mean you talk to them and you'd think they were in the message but they didn't know anything about brother brandom they just believe the Bible and they live the Bible and as Lord revealed it to them that's what they did she got baptized by Brother Green's grandson amen AJ the middle I don't remember John Johnny and Karen's son yeah uh I I I'm sure it's not Andrew must be AJ I don't know anyway well praise the Lord God's good amen praise the Lord yes um my little granddaughter stay over the house yesterday and you could see that she had been with God can you you know you've looked at people and they have um have you sure you know and you can see they've been with God there's a likeness to them and a their um countenance countenance is different yeah and it's just wonderful AB oh it's such a beautiful thing to see a young person amen that's them of God that's great and I want to mention that that was healed is the one that we pass every Sunday yeah bless his heart and we pray for him every time we see him out on Sund amen Lord I praise God for that that's such a miracle praise the Lord and I wanted to mention sister Sheila are you still having surgery yeah she has surgery on the fth same day that's right yeah the same day sister yeah yeah right we trusting they don't have to do quite what they've had to do in the past oh amen amen I know sometimes they've had to go really deep down in there and just going to believe it do not going to be that way this time praise the Lord amen so God is mindful God is good he knows our every need amen praise the Lord I know uh when me and my wife were married um my wife's family parents paid for the wedding so we had it in their Church which was a Methodist Church at uh Fort LOL and uh Campbell on Campbell was a Methodist Church but the one thing my dad told him uh he went to the minister and said I want you to marry them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you can do the father son the Holy Ghost whatever you do through the ceremony and the P circumstance but when you join them in holy matrimony you you join them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh you know I guess the father of the groom pays the minister so I guess uh whatever my dad slipped him he was more than willing to say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so even though we were married in the Methodist Church by a Methodist Minister we were joined together in God's name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in a Methodist Church I'm sure people probably sat there and thought what in the world's he doing but amen those who God has joined together amen amen praise the Lord Jesus I want to sing one more before we go to the word now Psalm number 398 amen he paid a death praise the Lord I'm so thankful he paid my debt amen because there was no way I could pay it absolutely no way amen if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have wanted it paid anyway I would just be like the rest of the world living in the world living it as they call it living it up amen but he paid my debt praise the Lord let's sing it to him now He Paid a Debt he did not I ow a debt I could not pay I needed someone to wash my away and now I sing a brand new song amazing gra all day long Christ Jesus Paid that debt that I could never PID well he paid that at calary he cleansed my soul and set me free I'm glad that Jesus did all my sin ER I now can sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus paid that debt that I could never pay and one day he's coming back for me to live with him eternally won it be glory just to see him on that day I then will sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus Paid that debt that I could never pay oh can we sing that again one day he's coming back for me to live with him eternally it be glory just to see him on that day I then will sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus Paid the debt that I could never pay a amen amen hallelujah All Saints one day he is coming back for us hallelujah are we go to meet him in the air amen but until that time we'll tar till he comes Hallelujah one day that one day that one blessed day oh what a day it'll be Saints amen amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah let's stand to our feet if we could now we're just going to go to the word amen try to kind of pick up where we left off today may be a little shorter than normal we'll just see I as I was going through this got to a place where um the Lord just stopped it so I'm I'm not exactly sure all of how this is going to end up but I don't have very many notes written down for today so just trust in the Lord Jesus amen whatever his desire whatever he wants amen if it's 15 minutes it's an hour and 15 minutes whatever he wants yes Lord we're going to turn over to Matthew chap 11 again verse 25 going to continue on God in Simplicity this will be part 12 uh this is still Bride versus the church or bride and the church part part three amen part three bride in the church amen Godly simplicity so we'll go back to Matthew 11 read our one verse of scripture that we've been reading verse 25 amen but before we do could we just bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus we're certainly indeed grateful the grace and mercy that you given our lives Lord we thank you so much for the testimonies thank you for the words Lord thank you God to to know that you are still a a miracle working God you are still a Healer Lord it seems like sometimes we get so arrogant and pompous and our own righteousness as message Believers that God we just shut everything and everybody else out Lord but God we know that you are working you are working in everyone who is yours lives God and we trust and believe Lord that whoever that is Father we want to give you thanks and praise God in just allowing us us and in just a little time that we have a little blip a little Vapor God of life upon this Earth to help to be an influence to be an encouragement to pray for and to and to be there for whomever Lord you put in our pathway God no matter uh who they may be what condition they may be in or Lord we're just believing father that our lives are purposeful in your hands and wherever you lead us and whatever you have us to do God that we'll do the the best we can with what you've give us in life to help others with it Lord we pray God that your Holy Spirit would just take complete control over this service Lord and my lips and the words that are spoken today and Lord the ears that hear God may you just bless it in a special way Lord whatever your desire and and will is Lord for this service and the continuance of it we're just trusting you depending fully on you God so Lord you God let allow allow do what would what your will would be Lord to be done here in this place today whatever that might be Lord we know that this service has a purpose we know there's a reason why we have this this time this place it's not because it's 10:30 on Sunday morning there's a purpose Beyond times and places there's a purpose Lord that you have a pre-ordained Eternal purpose for every one of us and for this place and this time and this service God you have a purpose and this word will not return void but you God send it and bring it back and allow it to be to us whatever your perfect will is for it Lord today we'll just thank you and praise you for all that Lord for everything you do Lord for all the Miracles all the wonderful blessings Lord you are so good to us we love you we thank you we praise you Lord we just pray God again that your full full anointing fall fresh once again Lord through this word that is spoken God let it be we commit it to you Lord now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Matthew 11:25 and at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes you could be seated if you'd like amen now I want to continue on with kind of where we left off last week now I know a little of it's been a little jumpy and of course we had three weeks of separation between some of them as well but I want to go back to Revelation chapter 6 amen we kind of left off from there last week uh I'm not going to bring the board back over again this week but we went through the church ages uh we talked about the uh and went through the the anointings uh of each age the anointing that's on this age the anointing that's on us the anointing in that that anointing is what brings that word that Revelation to our hearts reveals it to us God uses that anointing to bring that word to our hearts that's why this last day it had to be an eagle just like the Revelation that was brought to many of those in the Philadelphia Sardis Philadelphia Church Age The Man Age the wisdom to bring those things that was needed if God does it to bring about what this bride needs because he brings each of these bride the bride members through each of these Church ages had to be that Eagle anointing for this last day it's that same anointing that brings again still that Revelation to us and it will until we leave this place it will until this body is changed and we go in a Rapture it'll still be that same anointing and when that and when this bride leaves in its Earnest uh in a Rapture then that anointing goes with it we read last week that the world goes into apostasy uh the church age Church age as it were in and the world goes into apostasy and this fourth this fourth horse rider this tail horse rider rides straight on into predition God's anointing goes from the Gentiles and goes over and begins to deal with the Jews we found out that that tribulation period which I want to read a little bit today uh the purpose of that tribulation period the re that God has it there and that the church the bride raptures the church goes to there the biggest reason the difference between the bride and the church is the Holy Spirit the bride's born again the church is not the church has a simple anointing on them an oil but not a sustaining oil not not born again not in their soul maybe on their flesh maybe even on their Spirit but don't have what it takes to be able to complete the journey to bring them to that place of a Rapture amen uh they go through the tribulation they have to give their lives in marment they have to seal their testimony with with their own blood as brother Brandon puts it that way sealing their own testimony with their blood through that tribulation period which proves and shows that this bride since there is not a necessity for this bride to go through a Rapture proves that she is sinless before God proves that she is she is undefiled she is pure she is Holy she is righteous because of his righteousness she is clothed in his righteousness she is as righteous as Jesus Christ is righteous there's not a sin about her as we read that quote brother Bram said there's not even a smell of it on the bride amen perfectly sinless before Jesus Christ before God perfectly sinless so there's no reason for the bride to go through the tribulation for she is purged she has already been purged by the Holy Spirit coming and taking its life in you and that seed that remaineth in you is a perfect seed because it's the seed of God Amen how can the Soul that is with how can the Soul that is in that that is Eng Gulf taken over by God sin it can't amen God can't dwell where there's sin God can't dwell where there's there's death uh every time Jesus went to a funeral the man came back to life of the person amen uh nor can he sin the only reason that God could even dwell on this Earth is through the human body of Jesus Christ amen so uh I want to go back and as we finished off with those Church ages uh I want to start with the fist seal like we said uh like I said last week weot many times we preach on the seals we preach on the part that brings us uh through the church ages but then a lot of times uh it doesn't get mentioned very often and I don't have a lot of notes commentary for the remaining couple of uh seals but I did want to go through them again because it brings us to actually the point that I want to get to today the subtitle or the the uh the point of the scripture that I wanted to get to today so we're going back to Revelation uh chapter 6 uh and I want to start after this after the church ages ending here is if you will they um as it overlaps we talked about of this last Church age and start with the ninth verse ninth verse is the fifth seal now we've gone through 1 two 3 4 gone from the White Horse red horse black horse Pale Horse uh now to the to the fifth seal fifth seal and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a little while or for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now uh it was and it probably still is with many churches thought of that that was a gentile people people the souls under the altar but as brother random Explains It Go through the seal book uh as the Holy Spirit came and revealed it and showed it to brother brandham and as you read it it becomes a lot clearer to understand these are not Gentiles these are Jews those that would die in Christ have a testimony of Jesus Christ that is our testimony our live alive or dead I know a lot of people that have gone on that that were Christians my family my parents they had a testimony their testimony was of Jesus Christ that was their testimony because we died under the shed blood believing uh as as the human human life gave out uh that that that life that they lived was a life of Jesus Christ so that testimony that they had was Jesus Christ but you see nowhere in the scripture reading here that these had a testimony of Jesus Christ they don't have a testimony of Jesus Christ they have a testimony of the word look now uh they were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held they cried with a loud voice saying now they didn't have now those that died as Gentiles had the testimony of Christ the Jews do not have that testimony amen they don't have the testimony of Jesus Christ they've gone through I mean the Jews are the one that said let his blood be on us and on our children they don't have the testimony of Jesus Christ now we know some of the Jews have come out and accepted and believed Christ but the Jews and the true Orthodox Jew they don't have a testimony of Jesus Christ they still don't see or know or believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah they will by the grace of God through the word we know they will but as of now they still don't they still have it and obviously those that have been slain for the word's sake not for the testimony of Jesus Christ but for the word's sake they will and did as you read here receive white robes hallelujah amen which we'll go into just a little bit in a minute uh and then the second part as you read the scripture tells very plainly that these are not Gentiles these are Jews look white 11 verse again white robes were given unto every every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants amen fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled fellow servants now who are the servants Gentiles weren't servants the Jews are God's servants not the Gentile so actually even the Revelation because brother randam explains it he there it was the time he preached believed that those were Gentiles too but as the Holy Spirit revealed it to him and as you go and you read it uh it actually becomes very plain to realize these are not Gentiles these are Jews those Souls that are under the altar there crying Lord how long are Jews not Gentiles fellow servants which again we'll get to that in just a minute fellow servants how long should it be those Jews Under The Altar and they're still there today is still waiting amen still trusting but by the grace of God now they still receive white robes white robes given unto every one of them amen see God doesn't forget his people never would how high how far how wide amen you can't reach it you can't measure it how could I ever forget my people God never will never could those that have gone on they're setting there amen God doesn't just dis discount them yeah we know we have the 144,000 but God doesn't discount anyone any of his people even though we have a Rapture here amen at the end God's got bride in every Church age those dead in Christ will rise first and we which Rive and remain be caught up to meet the Lord in the air with them amen so God doesn't discount all those back there he brings them all along too Jew and Gentile the Jews are just is still sitting there under the altar waiting Lord how long amen how long shall there be Vengeance now see the bride doesn't cry for vengeance amen the the the bride the Gentile bride doesn't cry for vengeance but the Jew does if you go back and you read the Torah Old Testament look through it and see uh that's what it was all about it was eye for ey to for two they didn't see Jesus They didn't accept that message of Jesus Christ so they didn't believe him to be the Messiah so their whole thing is Judgment amen Vengeance Justice the bride she cries Grace yeah amen Grace amen Grace that's her that's her Battle Cry not Justice amen but Grace praise the Lord because she realizes through that message of Jesus Christ it's all about the grace of God Amen so they're not looking for vengeance the Gentile wasn't looking for vengeance we're not now looking for venance Vengeance amen the Bible says vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord amen we look for God's grace Lord let your mercy amen continue to Reign Over Us have mercy have Grace on others as you have had on me for if not for the grace of God there go I yes amen praise the Lord let's move on now and the 12th verse and I beheld when he had opened the six seed that's the fifth seal now Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black sack cloth of hair and the moon became as blood you can really as we just began the reading of this six seal can pretty much already recognize this is the Tribulation seal the six seal is the Great Tribulation let me just put it that way because I think a lot of times people get get tribulation mixed up to to understand say if you will pre-tribulation or or uh types of persecution that is not the Great Tribulation and don't conflate the two that's amen they are separate entities they are separate times they are separate purposes for that Great Tribulation amen so remember this six seal is the Great Tribulation this is that that sets in on the earth after the bride is gone after the Rapture the Great Tribulation sets in amen and you can read and see how it even begins reading that this really looks like a time of Great Tribulation let's read it again it opened the sixel though there was a great earthquake amen is that the earthquake that s California La don't know amen we don't none of us know remember now the curse though is not on California the the prophecy of curse is not on California it's on La you go back and listen when brother B when God speaks through brother bam and that prophecy comes forth It's specifically about Los Angeles the city that calls ourself after the name of the Angels amen specifically about that not to say that the whole state or a huge chunk of the state's going to go in I'm not saying that but the curse specifically of what brother random what God spoke through brother random was on La yes was on Los Angeles amen now great earthquake is it that earthquake I don't know different people have had different opinions uh some uh would make common sense I guess you would say uh some probably to me don't uh you can have your own opinion if you'd like that's up to you uh brother Brown never specifies that I've ever found I've never had any other minister anybody I know of come and give me a quote where brother Ram specifically said X Y and Z I know brother green was strictly I mean dogmatically against anybody going to California uh when when I took the the school kids on a field trip to uh to to where did we go uh Six Flags and uh we did some education stuff we went to Santa Monica we did you know uh we had an end the year fun field trip if you will oh and I came back brother green he he did not like that at all uh he was he was all over me and I and and and we had a discussion about it although he was so mad at me it wasn't a very much of a just it was more of a one-sided discussion but um but I but when when things begin to calm down I started asking him well brother green what makes you feel that way and it was his personal opinion it wasn't scripture it wasn't anything brother brother brandham had told him because I want to know see brother brandham told Brother green things you won't that brother green told us that you'll never hear on tape and you just have to take brother Green's word for it and I loved him enough and I believed him enough and and I could see as sister Pat was talking about I could see in brother Green's face in his eyes he was telling me the truth amen you heard all these things you hear uh behind the pull pit and all but I'm talking about sitting in his office across that desk that's in there now in my in my my desk now sitting at that desk across from him I can see in his eyes I can see in his face he's telling the truth so I believed him but there's some of those things you just you just have to believe because you don't hear it on tape um just like people have to believe Billy Paul's testimony about being in front of the May Company I believe him I I I've had brother Billy Paul give me that testimony in person I've seen it two or three times uh uh in in a congregation setting when he's behind the platform pull pit and I've heard it on tape and I've had like I said I've had him tell me personally I believe it when he tells me uh that testimony I believed it absolutely I believe what brother green tells me so I asked brother green uh is there anything you know why do you say that brother why do you feel that way it was just a personal feeling it wasn't anything brother brandham told him personally wasn't anything he could point to specifically in the scripture or even even a quote outside of the fact that La is under judgment but this point in life what country what town what city what state isn't under judgment I mean I'm over there in LA this week working and all the rain they've been getting parts of the interstate fell caved in Interstate 10 so I was told I looked on my maps I said wow why is Interstate 10 closed here and here and here and somebody said well it sunk whole Interstate sunk in I said well it's just getting ready to all go in the ocean anyway and you know person just looked at me and you know well yeah or something you know just kind of throw off this yeah God's prepar it's all getting ready to go in anyway but but what isn't what is under what what part of where we this whole country's under judgment FR SE we know border to border Coast to Coast she's going to get a a fiery baptism she's going to be burned over we know it's all under judgment amen so uh I know La specifically because God used brother bradam to say specifically you're going beneath the ocean and we know that's going to happen is this that earthquake I don't know again you can have your own opinion there's nothing wrong with that I I I I see I hope you know me well enough to know now I've been around a lot of people I've been a lot around around a lot of churches uh charismatic churches dogmatic churches uh uh churches who felt like that uh you know it was there and no more I've been a lot I've been a lot of places across the country been a lot of churches vote for a lot of people vote a lot of minutes and the thing that I probably one of the things I despise the most is for someone to come and tell me their opinion as fact I I don't want I am more than willing to hear your opinion but don't try to present it to me like fact like if I have a different opinion I'm going to hell uh I I I don't like that Spirit at all I don't like it I I don't want to have it I hope I don't or or get it from anybody else because you can't point and show in the scripture or or a quote by Brother brand to substantiate then it's just your opinion right amen so we all have opinions and there's nothing wrong with that I have my own personal opinion about California when it might sink the earthquake and all that uh and if I give it to you it's simply going to be my opinion because I don't have any any like I said any quote or anything to substantiate it so uh I can point to things that brother Ram said I can point to things that the scripture says and just draw my own conclusion just like anybody else would but I don't know another thing you probably don't hear very much from ministers but I don't if I don't have any concrete thing that brother Ram said or this then all I know is what I feel God's revealed to me and that's all I can say that's what I can go by amen I personally think the earthquake is going to be simultaneous in my opinion California's going to go the bride's going to go uh there there's going to be so many people missing and they won't know anything about it and it's well it you know maybe they got washed away maybe they got sunk under maybe this happened maybe that happened a lot of chaos is going to go on uh when this happens because it's not just going to affect California I I I've I've also had so many people joke about Arizona being beast fun property you you think you're going to stand here in Arizona and there's just going to be a little bump and then you're all of a sudden going to have the ocean it it's not going to happen like that a huge how many trillions of tons of Earth is going to go and displace all that water what do you think's going to happen it's going to be catastrophic all over the world yes uh so you you can't just say oh boom oh there it was California's gone oh we got nice now my property's worth a million dollars it doesn't work like that it's not going to be that way Saints um but earthquake now the first thing let off in Tribulation is earthquake open the six seal and there was a great earthquake boom seal open earthquake there it is amen and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair the moon became as blood the stars of the heaven fell upon the Earth even as a fig tree cast their under untimely figs when it when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it was when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places says I do not want to be here during that time God have mercy on anybody that is and that's probably a you can't even say that because there will be no mercy here like I said during the tribulation there will be no anointing here am mean God's just be dealing with the Jews that's it amen so you say God have mercy there won't be any they just have to live and deal with whatever H whatever Satan unleashes on this place we see it scripturally every Mountain Island moved out of their places goodness the kings of the earth and great men and the rich man and the chief captains and the Mighty Man and every bondman every free man hid them themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains said unto the mount and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that set us on the throne from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand now to me that'll be a period of time I to me that that's where uh I think in people's imaginations or maybe even a gift of vision have seen these zombie type people they will they will be to the place that they cry for the rocks to to kill them to to fall on us kill us hide us get us away somehow so that we're not in the face of this judgment there's there's going to be no way of Escape there's going to be no way to get away from it I can imagine people probably try to blow their heads off and uh uh blow half their face and and still live could you imagine the things that these that that these people imagine or bring up today they called zombies or the living dead they're dead but they're alive goodness blood to the hores bridled it's going to be a horrible horrible time friend that this earth goes through and it's purging Humanity in its purging the Judgment that falls on this Earth the purging for those for the church the judge judgement for those who didn't believe who rejected uh the word rejected Christ F feel the full brunt of what this tribulation is going to me to this world it's going to mean to its people oh they think they can go with it for a little while they'll continue on they've had tragedy here and catastrophe here they've dealt with this and they've dealt with that but there'll be nothing even remotely close to what's about to hit this earth when this bride leaves and it's Unleashed the fullness and the full Fury of that pale horse rider continuing to ride through the predition is going to unleash unimaginable things upon this Earth during that tribulation period during that tribulation period as we read last week not only will the church be purged but the Jew will be purged that brings us now to the seventh chapter so let's read the seventh chapter we haven't got to the we haven't got to the seventh seal but and and I wasn't really going to talk a whole lot about the seventh seal but there's a specific thing about it that I did want to mention the Bible says I'll read it real quick the Bible say when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about space half an hour now understand that to me that scripture I don't know brother Ram said this the coming of the Lord and so on so forth uh never specified we believe to be the second coming could be the third coming as as brother green had mentioned before this runs in continuity together in chronological order that would mean that this coming is after the tribulation but look what it says the thing that that I want to get to in the study of this message God in Simplicity what is our opening scripture that we've read every every uh part of this I thank thee old father Lord of Heaven and Earth because I has hid these things from the wise and TR prudent revealed him to B such as would learn look what he says when he had open the seven sear that was silence in heaven about the space half hour there's things what let me go here even what did Brother brandham tell what did God tell brother brandham about the pulls in his life first first pull signs in the hand second pull discernment of the heart third pull speaking of the word what did Brother random what did God tell brother random remember he talked about the shoelaces being so big trying to fit through a the shoelace being you know the size of a finger if you will going through the the hole of a pinhole right trying to fit that in and he said you can't teach super uh Pentecostal baby Supernatural things remember that yes I'm sorry I didn't get these quotes down to read them to you but uh this is all those things God is trying to tell brother Brandon he said now you've tried to explain the first and the second polls he said but the third one there's there there was to be nothing Satan was to know nothing about it even you Daniel Revelation 10 hide those things seal up those things until the right time notice there's only there are there are some things that God has just for the bride there is no one else that's supposed to know it no one else that is to speak it it is a direct Revelation from God to his bride and as God brings it and reveals it to us that is exactly what this what this bride is going to need that's what we we we have need of Amen silence what is it it's something unspoken it's not supposed to be something spoken it's supposed to be just a revelation at Revelation between God our maker and us his creation that's all not spoken amen simply revealed I thank thee father thou H that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent but what did he do to the babes what did he do for the bride he's reveal them to you it is for you and you only to know you and you only to hear or have revealed to amen but now that we've come out let's go back over to the seventh chapter now so now as we' come back out of uh the tribulation period let's look uh chapter 7 which was really the main part of what I wanted to get to today Revelation 7 verse one and after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the earth now that translation caused early people to believe that the the world was flat and it had Four Corners to it but if you if you go back to the direct Revelation or interpretation of it it really simply means quarters or a quarter split up into quarters like like a hemisphere I could draw it but uh you got if you got a ball and you cut it down the middle and you C it cut it Crossways you got four quarters of the earth amen Four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth and winds is disturbance amen we know scripturally winds denotes disturbance of the earth that the winds should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree so no substance and no person and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angel angels to whom it was given to hurt the Earth and sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their forehead the Gentiles are gone amen the anointing goes back to the Jews this tribulation creates great disturbance and these four Angels on the four corns of the earth ready to unleash on on this Earth the complete and final judgment that it will receive but this marking Angel comes up that we find him in in Isaiah we find him again here remember he had the the the the writing instrument the eorn going around and marking those who s and CED Abominations amen now look that marking Angel another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God which is a mark amen no remember the the the song We Sing I Mark Mark Mark I am Mark now Wherever I Go Mark marking Angel the seal the Seal of the Living God he cowed with a loud voice to those four angels that was about to unleash uh a complete disaster destruction on this Earth it was given to them to do so to hurt the Earth but this marking Angel says hold back stop wait don't hurt the Earth don't hurt the sea or the people the trees till we have sealed the Servants of our gods of our God where in their foreheads now what did Brother brandom tell us about the mark of the beast what did he tell us about the revelation of the word the marking in the forehead is your belief it's the Revelation it's what you it's what you uh uh believe give yourself over to your thoughts not not just your thoughts but but of of spiritual the the word of of of of Revelation the ceiling of the of the forehead is is what you receive into yourself as as scriptural Truth Or Not amen that's why those have the seal in their heads and on their hands you get the seal in your forehead because it's the Dogma or whatever you believe whatever you've received spiritually and your hand is what you do about it it's the right hand of Fellowship is the accepting and believing of of those dogmas of that doctrine of of that church or whatever it is and what you do about it the Revelation here what you do about it is here right now that now when when when when this marking Angel tells the Angels that's going to destroy it because when it's destroyed all of humans are destroyed when it's destroyed he's saying hold it back because I've got to seal the Servants of our God amen not the children uh not the not the bride of Christ but the Servants of our God we know who are they yes amen we just found over here under this under the altar the fellow servants as the Jews servants are always Jews to seal the servants where in their foreheads why because they have not received the message what's the message Jesus Christ it's not William brandom amen it's not word for word we say we have Christ mystery God revealed invisible Union and all but it's the message is Jesus Christ they received the message of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is God Bell in flesh their very Messiah that they crucified they receive it that marking Angel goes and what is delivered to the Jews at this time revelation reation praise the lord it's got to be Revelation it's not a human knowledge it's not an educational understanding it's a revelation of God showing it to his bride amen praise the Lord where is it it is here amen amen they receive it they understand they they they believe now he was their Messiah so before it all can be destroyed before all can be wiped away they had to be sealed they had to receive that truth they had to receive that word there had to be in Daniel 70 week a finish of the transgression praise godj they receive it now he goes on to talk about this who the servants were I heard the number of them that which were sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel 144,000 of all the tribes were sealed sealed with what the same thing that you were sealed with from Ephesians 1 amen grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed amen amenallah they received the same seal glory to God by Revelation 144,000 of the tribes of the children of Israel and he goes down and we can read it real quick of the tribe of Judah were seal 12,000 the tribe of R Reuben were sealed 12,000 the tribe of GAD were sealed 12,000 the tribe of Asher were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of netham and were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Manasses were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Simeon were still 12,000 of the tribe of Leba were still 12,000 of the tribe of is car were sealed were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed 12,000 the tribe of uh Joseph were sealed 12,000 of uh of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000 12,000 of 12 tribes is 144,000 that were sealed now before the complete unleashing amen and destruction of this Earth God had to seal the Jews now now we see the Fulfillment or portion of the Fulfillment of of of the fifth seal when the Jews are under the altar crying how long here it is they received that Revelation oh yes praise the Lord and to them vengence is met judgment has been has been executed and now they was they meet the same fate praise the Lord those the 144,000 those Souls out of the altar now we've got the Jews completed amen there's a whole another discrepancy of the 12 tribes I wasn't going to go into that today we've talked about that before in the past amen but um but to know 144,000 fulfillment portion at least of the fifth seal where they reive now now we've got the Jews they're done there's only one more group left that went into the tribulation period out outside of the of the Judgment of the tribulation uh that that group of people God just puts on their left hand and casts into Everlasting fire amen uh not Eternal uh but Everlasting see that that's a group obviously that goes but we're not talking about them we're talking about uh the Bride of Jesus Christ and the church that's we're in part three the bride and the church we throw the Jews in there because they're a part of this as well well amen but now notice see so we now we finished the Jews we come through uh uh completed uh what their situation is what God does for them where God brings them through and two now we've got one other group only left and that's the church that's the foolish virgin where did the foolish virgin come up cuz we got here let's go over real quick and read this the fifth the fifth chapter of Revelation the fifth chapter of re Revelation verses 9 and 10 and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred uh and tongue and people and Nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth now that's the bride now let's go back to uh the seventh chapter and look at the ninth verse here because we've got another group after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all Nations kindreds and people and tongue stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and Palms in their hands now we've now we've we have a discrepancy if which a lot of people do if you consider this group of all Nations that could not be numbered of all Nations Kindred people and tongues if this is the bride then we have a scriptural contradiction because it goes on to say they stood Before the Throne yeah amen but the bride does not stand Before the Throne Hallelujah she is in the throne Hallelujah as wife as bride of Christ her husband amen she's not Before the Throne you stand Before the Throne in judgment amen because when they come up to the white Throne judgment they everyone the the bride and Christ set in the throne and each one comes up for their own judgment he puts some on his left hand and some on his right hand this group is a group he put on his right hand this is not the bride this cannot be the bride because if it is it contradicts other scripture that says the bride will sit with him in his throne to judge not be judge but to judge do you not know that you shall judge the Earth amen amen that's the bride but look this fruit is Before the Throne before the lamb yes they're clothed with white robes with Palms in their hands but they are given white robes just like the Jews who did not believe in Christ for uh most of all of this time till the very end did not even believe they also believed they had white were given white robes Souls under the altar white robes were given unto them well sure you said well they had to be bride they were giving white rubs no no no no no no they they they uh there's too much scriptural contradiction to try to make this bride to try to make them bride no the bride is over in Revelation five when the book is open and the names are revealed the names in that L's Book of Life are the names of the Bride amen and when Jesus prevails and comes forth and opens that book those names reveal who who it was that was his bride amen amen not not Jew not foolish virgin but God's bride that's Revelation five not six not seven not Souls under the altar not seventh uh the seventh chapter these have to be a whole another group and what group is that look now and he cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sth upon the throne and and unto the lamb and all the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders the four beasts and fell Before the Throne on their faces and worship God Amen of course saying amen oh let me see here saying amen blessing Glory wisdom and Thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever amen this is not the bride cannot be it's the foolish virgin that's standing before God yes they have received white rose because remember re we didn't finish reading or complete that reading in Matthew 25 but we find in Matthew 25 when they come before him he puts a group on his right hand and he says enter into the joy of the Lord uh let's see if we can find it real quick if I can get back to it Matthew 25 and 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he set upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and remember now the bride is with him and in in the throne with him at this time they have to be when he's sitting there in that place of judgment is there their husband and wife amen and their judgment is is is uh the same together they're uh can't think of the word I'm trying to say but their judgment's the same because they're likeminded remember the the bride has taken on the mind of Christ she does that now so even when we get there she's taken on the mind of Christ his judgment's her judgment they're the same they look at things the same they believe the same why because he's the word she's become the word she's his bride she's sitting there the Judgment with him shall come up Shall Set upon the throne of his GL and be and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a sheep divide uh as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats now that can't be the bride cannot be a part of one of those two groups amen and notice it did not say that this group was his sheep it says that he divides them or separates them as a Shepherd would divide his sheep from the goats he didn't call them sheep he just said the dividing process of separating them is as what a Shepherd would do yes he didn't call the group on his right hand sheep because the sheep or his bride yes amen he just said the separation process is what a Shepherd would do it's the same process I'm going to take this and I'm going to put them here and I'm going to take this and I'm GNA put them there he didn't say there were Sheep amen and the bride cannot be either one of these two groups because she's on the throne she's not coming up to be judged why would she be coming up to be judged again when she's pure when she's sinless when she's righteous and holy why would there be a point of judgment when there's nothing to judge her for oh saints that just takes us back our whole last message last week she doesn't come before the throne to be judged she's judged now when you were judged and found not guilty God put his life in you that's right amen and that sealed it amen that finished it that that is doneall nothing else to your final destination amen you're done then you're finished you're innocent completely perfectly sinless before God not even a smell of sin hallelujah amen so how can this be the bride it cannot she has no reason to come before the throne praise the Lord as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from The Ghost and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left again he's not calling them sheep it's just the dividing process okay I know it says these sheep so if anybody's thinking that that came in my head if anybody's thinking that no it's just a continuation of the explanation of the dividing process he doesn't say you're not going to say you're not going to give an analogy and say it's like this and then use completely different characters if you say the proph processes like this then you're going to use the same characters to continue your your analogy that's right it's as a Shepherd so he says the Sheep here and the goats here it's that simple again not calling them Sheep amen okay I don't know if anybody was thinking that but I felt I had to explain that on the left and he and then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was in hunger and you gave me meat and went through all the process of well how did they get to this point we know that in the beginning of Matthew 25 they were virtuous had not deviled themselves with any man with any Doctrine they were spiritually virtuous stranger you took me in naked you clothed me I was sick you visit me in prison uh or visited me I was in prison you came un to me then shall the righteous answer him Lord saying Lord when saw thee uh saw we thee and hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw uh we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in so much ye as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren theast of these I I can imagine he's probably pointing to us on the throne at that time you have done it unto me when you did that to them you were doing it to me that's that's how I see this happening he would tell them when you did this to them he made point right at me he made point right at you when you did it to them you did it to me praise the Lord beautiful then shall he say also to them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed and everlasting fire prepared uh for the devil and his angels now look notice as this process unfolds He said Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you now look after uh back to revelation 7:9 after this behold l a great multitude which no man could number of all Nations Ed people and tongues stood Before the Throne before the lamb clothed with white robes and Palms in their hand Crow with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sth upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the Angels stood round about The Throne about the elders and the four beast and fell uh and fell Before the Throne in their faces worship God saying amen blessing and Glory wisdom Thanksgiving honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever amen now that's the church the the Jews and the church come up after the tribulation in Revelation 7 The Bride is a revelation five when God o when Christ opens the book when Christ opens the book and the names are revealed that's where you are Amen in the seventh chapter they inherit our grand Ed to are given white robes and come inherit the Kingdom this what's told to them just like the souls under the altar the 144,000 and the church they came up through Great Tribulation but the bride did not she raptured before the tribulation period has to if you've got to make the scripture run in continuity anybody watches this that thinks that the bride goes to the tribulation how could you put her through that time when she is perfect sinless before God Amen cannot do it after now now let me finish with this in Revelation 11 for the Jews I know we're finished with them but give me one more thing for the Jews the Jews had two witnesses it meant through through through that last 3 and 1/2 weeks of Daniel 70 weeks through this three and 1/2 period Revelation 11 which it is called 2 thou ,23 score days you look that up in the Julian calendar it is exactly three and a half years amen I give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy that 1,23 score days clothed in sackcloth these are the the two olive trees two candlesticks standing before God of the earth and and if any man will hurt them fire Pro fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devour your enemies If any man will hurt them he must be in this manner uh these have power look what these Witnesses have power to do now power to shut Heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy now who did that in the scripture man called Elijah walked up in the face of Ahab and said there won't be a drop of rain or dfall till I call for it that is exactly what the scripture says there won't be a drop of rain not saying I'm quoting it exactly there won't be a drop of rain or dwall until I call for it amen now who is this witness over here doing the exact same thing shut up Heaven that it rain not the days of their prophecy and they will have power over Waters to turn them to blood and to Smite the Earth with all legs as often as they will now who did that Moes what happened when the water turned to blood Moses what was it when the plagues of the earth hit in that manner it's Moses amen so these two witnesses could be no one other than Elijah and Moses praise the Lord but they're the witnesses to the Jews for this last day now the Church also has two witnesses now I don't have scripture on this other than what brother random said brother brandham gives the church nominal two witnesses brother brandom brother green talked about it often brother brand brother green if I remember right actually met both of these men personally if I can remember right or Roberts and Billy Graham brother Brown talked about oil o Roberts and Billy Graham being the two witnesses to those uh to those nominal Church to the groups that were out there not bride but church that were out there oil Roberts to the Pentecostals and Billy Graham to the to the church nominal if you will the Sanctified group amen the two men witnesses to them for these last now both of those men are gone yes now where are we at how late of the hour are we living Saints praise the Lord think about now what do we have for this last day what do we have for the bride if God's going to send witnesses to the Jews Moses and Elijah if he's going to send witnesses to the church surely he's going to send witnesses to the bride amen those Witnesses we got well one of them's on the board there I didn't put brother Brown because I ran out of room but God sent us brother Brown God sent us William Mary and Bram a prophet to this last day amen to help bring that word we know I could give you all of the adjectives and all the things we know all over again but you know the purpose the Reason God sent us brother brandom as a messenger as a messenger Prophet to this last day to help us understand now I'll leave with this brother brandham uh let's go back scripture John the Baptist when John the Baptist ministry had re had had had begun and then it it reached his Pinnacle remember when it began or when it began to I guess diminish if you will John the Baptist told all those people that were there his followers he said Behold the Lamb of God follow ye him now there were people that continued to follow John the Baptist because we find out later on that when John's in prison he sends his disciples to go ask Jesus if he is the one you know brother Ram said his eagle eyes that got dimmed over and all amen is he the one or not John still had disciples I mean got the same thing today Saints there are still people that forgive me I I hope I don't say this wrong and I don't mean to degrate those people any but there's people that follow brother Brown amen I don't
