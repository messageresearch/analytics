texted me yesterday she had sort of a relapse so she's not feeling very well she actually had to have her daughter Julie take her to urgent care they gave her some prescriptions to help her so please remember Sister Chilean prayer of the Lord would just touch and bless her sister Lydia was having some car issues today they're not expecting to be able to get it fixed till Tuesday this very prayer amen good to see a lot of you feeling a lot better today amen I'm thankful the Lord blessed me and never was something that hit me so I'm thankful God just kept me healthy strong and I killed every one of us brought us back says Pat I guess is a little slower in the recovery than brother Pat so glad brother Pat's with us but sister Patty is not with us so I just remember her in prayer and thankful that Gabriel and Alice are doing good in art but then Sharia got hit but Friday so if she's not with us today so please remember I just touched her as well sister um Julie text me also said she wasn't going to be able to make it today but let's remember her in prayer too good to have each and every one of us here and have uh a family of God back together amen reminds me that Micah reminded me the other day when I just it just I just it's just so hard when I'm in that situation to counsel the church but you reminded me he said they had when he was one of Tim hume's Church they had food poisoning go through the church they had a great picnic or gathering uh potluck whatever it was and I guess a lot of people laid a lot of the same food and 90 probably of the church got violently sick to even some had to go to the hospital maybe it's two weeks of church he said the next time that they were able to come back and assemble in church they started playing the pre-service music and everybody just started raising their hands worshiping the Lord and spirit fell and just had such a wonderful service amen I expect that here praise the Lord God just bless us in a special way feeling his presence and knowing he's still the same and he's the same here with us and as he has always been praise the Lord distance is nothing to the Lord amen doesn't matter which congregation doesn't matter where in the world we are and we're all part of that mystical body of Jesus Christ amen so let's remember these requests in need in prayer is there nothing no other anyone have an unspoken request the Lord knows all of our needs amen thankful to the Lord for that let's stand to our feet if we could but the minimally asked for the dentist if he would to take us to the Lord in prayer this morning Lord Jesus we bow our hearts and heads and reference to your holy spirit that is present at this time and Lord I can remember in your word that two went to the temple to pray one uh Pharisee and one Republican oh how the Pharisee Justified all these good works and how great he was and he got his reward but that public and he bowed himself he won't even lift up his head he says forgive us the sinner's eye and Lord we know that you resisteth the proud but give his grace unto the home and father they dwell in the hearts of the humble and we are living in the hour where the enemy is fighting us harder than ever before yes and Lord is our brother pray so sincerely earlier that with how the devil is fighting us in trouble and getting us believe we're not right we're not Believers but you said in your word yes resist the devil yeah [Music] resist we should turn him down yes we need to recognize ourselves as Believers that we are more than conquerors in the name of Jesus Amen Lord no matter what we go through Lord you are born and able to make a way yes to give us a solution to give us Victory Lord Jesus and father I can recall the prophet said and the devil doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your Doctrine if there's no life's there you're not coming up anyhow and Lord that should speak to our hearts if there's such a desire of us for swirliness for filthy shows and and filthy magazines and filthy talk and whatever it may be it's contrary to your word Lord take it out of us burning all of us father because this is a time that is so easy to compromise to make excuses oh you know I do so much I know God is Happy Disobedience to your word father will leave us out of the kingdom of God I recall one time you said Lord as to Israel all day long I stretch out my hands to a disobedient and gain sane people and Lord where do we stand right now all day long I stretch out my hands come up to me they are labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest amen yes I stretch out my hands to a disobedient in game same people oh [Music] you paid a death Lord in the natural it was so bad I couldn't even watch that movie The

it's like get into the worship of the Lord there's nothing like it praise the lord it's nothing like the moving of the spirit and his Spirit moving in our midst and him having his preeminence amen there's nothing like it praise the Lord our whole lives are worship everything we do every place we go everything we say every Movement we make from our heart is worship to the Lord It's the signification of the spirit of God living in US showing to the world that we worship God for living in us and through us and having his preeminence in our lives we may look strange we may act strange but it's only because of the Lord Jesus it's in our lives it's in our hearts we're the Oddball today Saints amen we're the odd ones in this world today praise the Lord if you don't realize that go to a mall one time go to an airport one time go to the gym show one time you see all how we stick out amen amen praise the Lord but it's only a worship to the Lord your life standing in the middle of all that unbelief is worship to the Lord amen praise the Lord amen I love him don't you amen thank you Jesus let's stand to our feet now if we could amen does anyone have a testimony on your heart real quick amen praise the water tonight we're going to go ahead and turn over to uh Genesis chapter one we got as I see it now by the help of the Lord uh two more uh two more messages on this we're going to bring on the new beginning and this is today will be the new beginning part 21. and then so uh the way I see would just uh winding it down here for this service and then the Lord will in the next amen but let's turn in our Bibles Genesis chapter 1. we're going to read the first couple verses of course Genesis chapter one praise the Lord but before we do again let's bow our heads for word of Prayer Lord Jesus we're very thankful of all that you do for us every day father we want to as we come into this place this morning as we worship at our homes and they be streaming Lord we want you to know how much we love you and thank you worship you and praise you our lives are yours God all that we have is yours anything that we can give is yours Lord I know father and the finances you ask for the 10 percent father but everything is yours we don't have anything that's ours yes everything that we have is yours God you just bless us enough to let us borrow it for a little while God to help our lives here on Earth and to make life maybe a little bit better and a little happier father but Lord there's no happiness in the world there's only happiness in you there's no joy in the world there's only joy in you Lord all the joy that we have God is things that can't be bought at a store can't be bought at a Car Lot can't be bought in a home Lord it all comes from you of the spirit we thank you Father for those things and we're thankful God that those things come to us without money without price you gave yourself Lord it costs you your life Lord but God for us we just accept it and believe it we thank you today God that you share it freely with us we thank you Lord for the desire in our heart to receive it unto ourselves because it's for anyone who will but Lord there's only a predestinated determined for ordained person people that will know it that will see it that will desire it that will want it and that will live it God that's those people you calling this last day your bride and we thank you God to have just a little portion of us body of bride here Lord in this place today to worship you to exalt you Lord believing God that we brought you with us knowing that you hear God moving in this place as you did on the day of Pentecost and filling every heart Lord and every life today with that Joy of that love and that peace Lord helping us into this world and the days of this world and we come in here God expecting a a good uh a good kick Lord of that Spirit again to to motivate us to strengthen us to bless us to continue to help us as we press the mark toward the high calling and the prize the high and the High Calling of the Lord Jesus we thank you Lord today for those that have come those who may be streaming we pray that you'd have your way in the remaining part of this service Lord speak to us through us here through us God accomplish that you to have to send this word forth today that this meeting and not be in vain God that it will be accomplished and what you'd have said it forth for we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we thank you Father for it and we commit it all to you now again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray Amen in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth the Earth was without form and void and darkness is upon the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen you can be seated if you like amen I like it when that spirit of God I know the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters there in the natural but you know water represents people in the Bible multitudes people amen I'm not sure if we in this little group here is constitute multitudes but we'll go with that anyway man is the spirit of God moves out upon the water out upon the multitudes out upon the people amen and flows through Us Praise the Lord let's go over to Revelation chapter 21 now we probably won't be very long today as I said uh it was what I had that the Lord put on my heart was really too much for one service but um uh so splitting it up into two kind of by the way I can gauge it could be two shorter messages but uh when the Lord has his way we don't know what'll happen so it's all in his hands regardless so yeah amen but the way I see it is the way it looks here we won't be too awful long today but just uh enter into a little bit more and finalizing this new city and getting back into the wall the gates the things that we talked about reiterating and of course uh uh uh again uh re-showing or uh renewing and helping us see that this this is for God's people and not just the Gentile but for the Jew as well God again as God intermingles that City he intermingles the wall he intermingles and of course remember the wall is the thing that's the solid that holds it together on the from the outside of that City I mean it's a wall that wall is a constant praise the Lord just like we kind of are here in this this walled place without these walls we would just be out in the open uh so it's those walls that do that and remember the things that Encompass that those that that that City those walls um is made of Jasper remember that that Jasper represents Jesus of course and like we said last week even the word the the the definition or the acknowledgment of Jasper is to mean healing or to be healed not to mention the multi-colors that the Jasper will put forth or that the Jasper comes in I probably should let Mike or Tom come and give you the gym lesson but that's just going to be a short part of what we want to talk about but my whole point is that that Jasper remember Revelation 4 he was looked upon the Jasper and started stone that Jasper is the beginning and the ending uh Reuben and Benjamin remember the Jasper and Sharda stone is is showing us that it's a reflection to the bride but it's also showing those gems that are the of the Reuben Stone and the Benjamin Stone which is the beginning and ending even of the 12 tribes of Israel but as you look upon that wall that's made of Jasper which we'll read again represents Jesus so even as we're talking about the city and the walls the foundations the gates all of it that Encompass every bit of it is Jesus amen it's all about him yes praise the Lord It's All About the Lord Jesus regardless of our thoughts opinions uh none of that matters it's all about him right so it's not about me not about you it's not about any church or any denomination or any movement uh it wasn't about brother Branham it's about Jesus amen and that and that wall there that constitutes that that that shows that reveals that now as we go to Revelation 21 uh I want to begin with the 14th verse um hold your place there we're going to go a couple of the scriptures but keep it there uh because we're going to end up coming back here as we get back into the foundations and the gates if you will now 14 of Revelation 21 verse 14. and the wall of the city had 12 foundations which we talked about we drew out on the board we've already erased it off the board here uh of those 12 foundations because we got back into or got into that Europe and thumb uh that's in the scripture that we talked about last week that we'll get into a little more detail today uh the 12 the the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the names of The Twelve Apostles of the land remember we talked about or went into the scripture about Ephesians 2 there's other places but the scripture that I read Ephesians 2 the foundation is the apostles the prophets and that Chief Cornerstone being Jesus Christ himself uh so each one of those foundations is the names of those 12 Apostles that bring that foundation of the word that this that this bride is built upon this body is built upon and the parable that Jesus said the man that builds his house on the sand will go away but if he builds his house on that Rock Amen that rock that Foundation the foundation is the most important part of it you can make the most beautiful wall of building you can make the most fundamentally sound wall that you want to or house or you can garnish it and it can be the prettiest uh site that ever behold by human eyes but without a foundation that's solid the way it should be if that's Foundation isn't the way it should be no matter how beautiful or even how sounds how soundly built the wall is if the foundation is it it doesn't matter amen it'll go crumbling to the ground so the foundation built upon those 12 Apostles amen and it wasn't the Twelve Apostles per se but that word the the the scripture the the word that came forth the foundation of what we believe amen which is Jesus Christ the Chief Cornerstone amen remember Jesus told even Peter when Jesus said uh when when uh when when Peter proclaimed and the different ones proclaimed what they believe he was and G and Peter spoke out and said there are the crisis son of the Living God Jesus said uh uh Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock the foundation of the revelation of who Peter said Jesus was I'll build my church on that Foundation amen praise the Lord so now every one of those 12 foundations that holding up this wall is of The Twelve the names of The Twelve uh apostles amen now let's get to the wall uh let's see for the wall of the city had 12 foundations in them the names of The Twelve Apostles of the lamb and he that talked with me had a golden Reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof again and the city lieth Foursquare the length is his largest of breadth and measure of the city of the Reed we've gone over this twelve thousand furlongs to length of the breadth the height are equal you measure the wall thereof and 140 cubits 40 and four cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the Angel remember we said that measuring that out by the measurement scripturally puts us at about 216 feet of course that's obviously an approximate measure nobody's going to be there with the rulers there's a 216 foot ruler the making sure it's right to the 216 mark But approximately by the measurement of the scripture this wall 216 feet high which we said is about 18 stories there are about um a hundred uh 100 feet less than the tallest building downtown which is pretty pretty high wall and the building of the wall of it was a Jasper amen we just talked about that the city was pure gold like unclear the glass and the foundations of the wall uh of this uh the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones that's what I want to talk more about today uh as we get into the First Foundation was Jasper II Sapphire and of course I'll probably butcher some of these again the third a calcedona uh calcidoni uh the fourth in Emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth Sardis seventh crystallite the eighth Barrel the ninth topaz tenth uh something else the 11th um the uh Hassan the 12th amethyst the 12 gates for the 12 pearls every uh segregate one of one Pearl uh Street City we'll talk about that a little bit later let's go back now to the garnishing these these stones let's look at these stones again for a few minutes and look at what the garnishing remember what it says now these foundations of these walls have the names of The Twelve Apostles written in them so they're the representation of the foundation the Apostle said that this church is built upon amen so what we're what we've been talking about what's going to mostly be today and next service is going to be a lot of typology and a lot of uh recognizing what the scripture says and drawing those conclusions up from what he said to what has happened to what is yet still going to be in this new city that garnishing out remember they have each Foundation the names of The Twelve Apostles of the Lamb amends uh so that's the the Gentile after Christ came to to bring forth this Gentile bride but remember it's garnished this wall is garnished 19th verse foundations of the wall were garnished which is to embellish With Honor amen so it's not the foundations are of the Apostles but it's but it's being embellished With Honor by the 12 Patriarchs amen of the 12 tribes of Israel the garnishing is to embellish with honor to gain honor to give honor so even though the foundations are laid are of The Twelve Apostles that these walls are laid on it's also intertwining that we understand again this isn't just about the Gentile this is Gentile and Jew God's people that are that they're garnished with those 12 tribes of Israel that garnishing is just an embellishment as you I look you can find it here if you look up in the Greek amen that shows about the the the the metaphor type of it obviously there's a literal harnessing but the metaphor type is is a bringing of Honor it's a bringing in an embellishing of honor of these 12 Tribes of these Stones now let's go over to Ephesians or to uh Exodus and let's look at this for just a few moments because it tells us uh it tells us here and of course I've read the quote that brother Branham had last week amen of each one of these uh stones that it mentions now each one of the Stones it's mentioned here does not perfectly line up with the ones that we find in Exodus 28 that we're getting ready to read they don't line up perfectly but they because sometimes different names are given to different things through the scripture if you know that even different people have different names uh in the Bible that if you look at and depending on which book that you read uh you could look and say well that's a different name well it's a different name and it's the same person as over here it's not a different person a different name yes so if you line these uh line these up you can still find out that these 12 Stones because see some scoffer may look at it and say well those don't that's not the same word that's not the same Stone but when you do research you find out that yes these stones are the same now they may have evolved or uh changed names or something but they're all fall into that same category together to represent those 12 uh tribes of Israel now let's look at it real quick Revelation uh Exodus chapter 28. let's read it first and thou shalt make the breastplate and remember we talked about that last week I had this up here so you don't have to keep staring over this way let me show I'll just put it back up my artwork again is pretty hideous but um in a pinch real quickly that's a little bit the breastplate of Aaron looked like the 12 Stones uh the 12 Stones on the breastplate that we talked about remember the urum and the thumbum it was put there um on the on the breast That was supposed to be on the breast of Aaron as he went in over the heart of Aaron as he went into God Aaron the priest that was a represent that was a representative of those tribes was the one that bore that on his chest as he went into God and everywhere he went it was a representation amen that's why it meant so much to God that it be done that way and each one of these represented a different a different tribe amen let's read it again and thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work after the work of the affid Thou shalt make it of gold of blue of purple and of scarlet and a fine twine linen Thou shalt make it and remember we talked last week God is extremely specific extremely explicit uh you can you can take this back or run it completely through the Old Testament and find when God gives something to this matter such as the ark when God spoke to know about the ark God gave very specific instructions on how he was supposed to build it what he was supposed to use uh the wood the pitch and everything of exactly how it was supposed to be how big it was supposed to be every single detail about it was to the minute detail that it was supposed to be now if no words had taken that Ark and tried to build it out of Oak which we wow that's a hot nice hard wood or or pecan which is even harder hickory wood uh is even harder than others and say well let's just take this it wouldn't have worked it had to be exactly the way God's word says it was to be now some people may take this message they may take the scripture and say well I think brother Branham meant this no you're building your Ark out of Oak you need to build that Ark exactly the way it said amen I'm not interested in what he meant I'm interested in what he said don't tell me what he meant tell me what he said amen and I'm not talking about just brother random I'm talking about the word you know tell me what it says not what's your interpretation of it is because I don't it'll be on my arc of Oakwood I don't want to build my Ark out of pine I want to build it exactly according to The Specific Instructions God gave you he does the same thing here and notice one of the reasons that God does this not just because God was uh picky uh although I guess in truth God really is oh yeah and he should be as we should be amen uh but he he's very specific about the colors uh the gold blue purple scarlet and the even the fine twine linen even to the Stitch the very Stitch the very thread that they are to use in the stitching had to be exactly right and again we talked about last week why was God as we talked about we said well he's picky okay that's kind of maybe a carnal word but uh I like using specific it had to be very specific just like in this day just like with God's word it had to be very specific why do you think that brother Branham could go into the woods and he can hit a attack on a piece of wood at 50 yards every single time why do you think that brother Branham had to be so precise and perfect in his natural life so much so that if that bullet didn't exactly on that attack he had to fix it it had to be made right amen he didn't go move the tack he didn't go move the target he fixed the source of the problem the gun you have to fix the source amen you can't just say well I want to make this different like this don't it's got to be specifically perfect according to what it says and why do you think brother Madam's life was like that right because of the word that brother Branham was to bring to a people it had to be specifically perfect exactly on letter by letter word of word lot upon line precept the Palm preset yes amen it had to be exactly according to God's word yes it couldn't be off not one I don't want a brother around say not one John or tittle yeah amen or one Mark or one uh quotation mark or one explanation or a point or whatever it was had to be exactly the way he said it right yeah could not be off had to be exactly the way God that's wait that's why God made brother random the way he was because he had to bring this word exactly the way he brought it well the same thing here Saints This Thread this colors this this uh uh uh material everything had to be exactly perfect because this man was to walk into a place that if it wasn't exactly perfect according to God's instructions that man fell dead right right it was a matter of life and death not spiritually literally physically life or death yes if he walked into that Holy place that holies of holies and there was just one thing out of order that man dropped dead yes again we talked about that last week or last time he dropped dead they put a rope around the man's waist now when he walked in there if he dropped dead you couldn't go in there and get him because whoever went in there after him dead died immediately yes amen so if he felt dead they had a Roper they'd pull him out that's the only way to get him out of there amen had to be exactly perfect so you see again we can use the word picky but God's very specific and his words got to be very specific yes and people say well this person does this and that I'm more interested in what a person preaches amen what is what is their revelation brother Tom going back to his prayer what is the revelation that God give to to bring that word because that's the thing that God cares about the most amen God didn't care whether I parted my hair on the left or right this morning amen he didn't care if I used any Grecian formula or made sure it was a little Browner looked a little better or he didn't care if I put contacts in my eyes or wore the glasses he didn't care about any of that what is the word what Lord saying amen what word comes forth that's the thing that God cares about is that word it's got to be line upon line precept on precept if it says gold friend it has to be gold if it says purple it better be purple if he said use this thread right here you better use that thread because today it's not a physical death necessarily it can be but it's a spiritual death yes separation from God unbelief amen remember what is sin sin is unbelief right disbelief not believing God's word people say oh I believe God's word but then you you fall onto some Fable or you you you give in to some man's idea or you give in to somebody because they had a prophecy or something you give in to and it takes you off the word amen yes in college without any repentance friend you don't even have to be a Christian to have a gift like that right oh my then what is it that God's concerned about the word it's got to be exactly perfect on the mark on the line so when God says this this is exactly what he means look it now find twine linen shall I'll make it Foursquare it shall be being doubled a span shall be the link thereof and a span shall be the breath thereof so it was a square I've got it as a rectangle up here but it was a square and now shall uh set in it the settings of stones even four rows of stones one two three four four rows of stones uh the first row now I I had this down I I didn't feel to write it because it just gets a little bit dry uh but I did I did do a little research on it so I have it myself uh if it's not something that's interesting to you or something that you care about or something that's okay but I just wanted to bring this out as an understanding and lesson of what God has got what God did there what God's doing now what he's going to do what God brings out is uh as uh something that we follow now the first Thou shalt said the setting of stones four rows the first shall be a Sardis a topaz and a carbuncle this shall be the first row the second row shall be an emerald sapphire and diamond and the third row of a linear I don't know how to pronounce that and a gay and an amethyst in the fourth row a barrel and an uh Onyx and a Jasper they shall be set in the gold in their enclosings this is exactly how God had to say and the stones shall be with the names shall be with the names of the children of Israel twelve according to their names like the Engravings of a Signet which the which the prophet which he carried on his shoulders amen he had that Signet that that that those 12 tribes of Israel we didn't go into all this teaching of it but that he wore in Gold Amen on his shoulders is straight to Heaven amen was the same those names written just like the NSYNC that's why it's saying in the segment every one of his names shall be according to the 12 tribes now you think these don't match up quite some do some don't but the first he said was a Sardis the Sardis matches up with the Sardis just like it does in Revelation 4 and matches up with what we just read in Revelation 21. the two match up the Sardis was the first and the Sardis was who we've already talked about it who was the first stone Sardis Reuben the first one born amen the firstborn of Israel Reuben was the start of stone that was the beginning amen the second was a topaz the topaz is also in the in the writings of Revelation 21 the topaz was Dan amen I could have wrote them all in there but it would have uh you know again I just didn't real just didn't know how much of that would interest you but if you want to write it down you go ahead and write it down the second one uh was a topaz that was Dan amen the third the third was carbuncle now that's the first row the third was the carbuckle now the car bump was the first one that does not show up in the Revelation 21. but I did some research and you can find out that that carbuncle also matches up with the with what was in Revelation 21 one of the ones I found difficult too um to read is the chal sedone or chalcedoni c-h-a-l-c-e-d-o-n-y it's that same Stone amen if you look at it and do some research and find out in the Greek in the Hebrew that the two match up the carbuncle and those two match up and those two uh uh and that last Stone there that that in that line was Levi now I think I said this the other day too if you try to go do some research yourself I did it uh I've done it before I had a lot of this written down from before some of it I couldn't find but um but if you go do some research you'll find there is some discrepancy with some people that they'll put a different one with a different Stone uh the best that I could find scripturally through the concordance and through some research was this is how they match up amen Levi is the third the car bumper or the chaldoni amen fourth the fourth was the emerald the emerald also matches up with the emerald in Revelation 21 and that's Judah five is the sapphire the sapphire also matches up to the sapphire in Revelation 21 that's issachar six is the diamond the diamond in in uh Exodus 28 does not show up in Revelation 21. amen it shows up as crystallite uh crystallite which is Zebulon Zebulon seven the the gure l-i-g-u-r-e which is in here uh is not mentioned in Revelation 21 but in research found that that stone matches there's actually there was actually a couple stones that matches them with it but but with the his sin the j-a-c-i-n-t-h uh we talked about that the road that the Tabernacle was on the corner of jesinto uh just doesn't have an O on the end of it I may pronounce it incorrectly but we always pronounce Jacinto with a J as an H so if it's different because it's Greek or Hebrew then forgive me but I just called The Descent or the ligur that's Simeon Simeon eighth eighth was the Agate uh the gate does not show up in Revelation 21 but the Chrysler Prime prices Crystal crisis uh was he a gate that's Nepali a nephily uh nine nine is the amethyst amethyst matches up that is God the tenth um see tenth is Barrel that matches with Revelation 21 is Asher 11 is the Onyx uh does not show up in Revelation 21 but the sardonyx does Amen so if you take the Onyx and you put basically s-a-r-d on front of it the sardonyx uh is Joseph you mean that's Joseph and then Benjamin of course the last is the Jasper we got Sardis and Jasper Benjamin's the last one now in those matching up to each one of the names that's on this Roman thumbel that was here that we remember is the breastplate of judgment that when anybody came that they had some kind of Prophecy or some kind of word from God or if they claimed to be some kind of a gift or person or something if they spoke it nobody had the discernment of the Holy Spirit to know whether that was true or not right so they were brought in front of this thing in front of the Sherman thumb and they would speak their dream they would speak their prophecy they would speak their Word of Wisdom whatever it was and if those lights lit up it was of God amen that those lights were just the the stones and there was no light to them but the stones supernaturally God would take these stones and these Stones would Flicker and light and glow and and and and it would prove that God was in it the light of God the spirit would come on that breastplate and it would light up all of these stones and those stones would Flicker and show that what this man was saying what this person was saying was from God this was God saying this this is God doing this amen and all of those lights would light up now what do we have today we have again like I said the other day we have the Holy Spirit the holy spirit that is within you to be able to discern and to know whether those lights go off when you hear something that is prophetic or a Word of Wisdom or something that you claim or someone claims is from God that has to light up in your spirit it has to light up in your soul it has to speak to you to tell you whether that is true from God or not right and if it does then you as an individual amen because remember God judges the Gentile bride as individuals even though we're one body group he judges them as individuals he judges Israel as a group amen there Israel as one group so they had all this as one but each one of you has a responsibility in yourself to have that discernment to have that Holy Spirit to know whether something is of God or if it is not if that lights up in your spirit then you can believe that would be from God Amen if there's something that goes off that just says I'm that his lights just aren't lighting up or as I've said before that it just didn't ring the bell there's just something in there and I've heard things preached before and knows nothing against anybody and it could have probably just been me but it when it just didn't ring true in my spirit of what I know that God would reveal to me or even if it was something that maybe I hadn't even read or studied before that somebody said and I thought well you know I I I'm not quite sure but if that light didn't light up in me then I just left it alone I just say that's not uh that's not something I deal with that's not something I'm gonna hold to I'm not going to call that brother a liar I'm not going to say he's off the word unless the Lord chose to be something specifically different and says this is in complete contrast to what that person's saying then I have no other choice but to believe in my life that that person's off the word but that's me you have to do the same thing does that light light up or does it not right see and when that light doesn't light up it speaks something to me it tells me something that that that uh you know uh maybe go research it look at it pray about it whatever but if it doesn't light up in me that Holy Spirit doesn't ring that truth then to me I like hands off right I don't I don't have anything to do with it or something and that person or whatever they could do whatever they feel whatever God speaks to them or shows them that's their choice but that's what they had here the urom and thumb them was when they came before God if that German thumb on them didn't light up then they knew that that person was lying and remember remember what brother Adam said If a person comes forth as a word from God a prophecy or a word from God or something like that if it doesn't happen or come true or they hit like one out of every 10 or every 100 or something that person should come before the congregation and repent because they're they're a uh anointed of the devil yes amen he said they're anointed of the devil because God doesn't lie and if they're speaking on God's behalf and that's not scripturalness not what God Said and it's not something that came to pass then they should come before that church and have that devil prayed off of them because they're influence of a wrong spirit because God doesn't lie yes amen amen that's how you know that's how the church stays clean that's how God keeps his children in this in in line in the place where they should be amen he did this with them here he does that with us here amen and it all goes down to those foundations friend it all goes down to those foundations it all goes down to the teaching the word that God has given us that we hold true that we believe that we that we uh a propagate of our own spirit in our own lives we hold that true see here and all those things matter to us and that's why we do this that's why it matters that's why we care amen because it speaks to us it does something to us now that human thumb have to light up for it to for it to ring true yes that's why see now he put those for now let's go back to revelation 21. he garnished those stones he garnished those foundations with those stones those stones have the names of the 12 apostles but garnished with all of these precious stones which carry the names of the 12 tribes of Israel so it's not just the Gentile it's the Jews as well amen so we cover the foundations we see that these foundations represent the overcomer just like the person that brother random in the Bible says who occupy this is the overcomer the overcomer amen who is going to overcome who is going to overcome in this latter laodicea and rotten agent we live in today it's just going to be a few Saints yes amen but praise the Lord of God I plan to say that I am one of them amen I'm glad to say that I'm one of them now those foundations again Apostles and tribes amen all intermingled twine together now Revelation 21 again let's go let's read 12 Revelations uh 21 12 and 13. and when I start talking about the gates a little bit and the gates are probably going to take a little bit longer it's amazing some of the things that the Lord put in those Gates too but let's let's do this first uh 12th verse and had a wall great and high and had 12 gates and at the gates 12 angels and the names written thereon were which are the names of the 12 tribes of Israel uh the 12 tribes of the children of Israel now we see that the gays the foundations had the names of The Twelve Apostles the gates had the names written in them of the 12 tribes of Israel amen remember again these both they both intertwined between Jew and Gentile these 12 gates uh had 12 angels at each one and the names written were the names of the 12 tribes of Israel on the East three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates on the west three gates three three three three three and three well now let's go down to the 21st first and we'll try to finish up with this here today amen and the gates and but I do want to come back to that 12th verse again though too and the 12 gates were 12 pearls every several gate was of one Pearl and the streets of the city were pure gold that were transparent now look at this uh to to make this make a little more I hate to say this word but a little more sense a little more understanding the 12 gates were 12 players every several gate that just means an individual game each gate was individual of itself amen each one and we're going I'm gonna tease you but next time we're going to talk about how big these gates are now there's no place that I have found if anybody finds it you can let me know uh brother Pat's usually a good expert at that but if you find something let me know I cannot find how high they are but I have found how wide they are and it's outstanding but um I just I just described to that they're uh you know pretty much encompassed the wall they could be a little shorter on the bottom a little shorter on top I don't know doesn't say but um I figured they encompassed mostly all the wall uh which most skates do but you know sometimes like an entry door uh the door doesn't go all the way to the top uh it might come all the way to the bottom so there's I don't know I haven't found anything that says how tall they are but again have found how wide they are but notice each one is a gate unto itself it is of one material it is one solid gate and that material is what a pearl we just read it each uh at the 12 gates were 12 pearls every several gate was one Pearl one Pearl man wouldn't you like to see the oyster that created those Gates I think God just made them yeah praise the Lord can't imagine an oyster being quite that big especially once you find out how big they are but each gate is one Pearl just one Pearl amen uh and it just means that that each gate is again unto itself and each one of those pearls now each one of those Gates those uh this is where all the songs and the sayings come about the gates of pearl uh when you talk about the gates of pearl people always uh when I was in the nomination you always felt like that uh when you die you went right up to the gates of pearl they all the songs and all the things they talked about was right uh Peter ping had Peter having the key so you can't get it in without putting your permission you got to be able to be on Peter's good side and make sure he wrote woke up on the right side of the bed that morning to make sure when he has that key and you get up there that he opens that gate for you oh we know that's much nonsense but that's how a lot of people actually probably still think of it a lot of people still believe or think along those lines just like I did when I was a kid but thank God for truth Revelation and the word any competent educated person that can read this can see the the it just goes down to the the fact that there's nicolaitanism and the people sitting in the pews just listen to what the priests are saying and they don't study for themselves they don't pray for themselves they don't read the Bible they don't know what it says and so they just take what they say you know and uh those Pearly Gates so that's that's where the Pearly Gates came from and each one and and there are Gates of pearl but a little different scenario and the way it plays out when we get there in this new city than what I had learned or what I had heard was taught to me but they are those Gates of pearl each one each Pearl now has the name of the 12 tribes of Israel now uh I want to go back something here because the next thing I want to do is I want to start talking about those pearls getting to the scripture of the Pearl we might actually get to um I might actually get to another part of this before we close up today but uh I want to go back to the 12th first I told you we wanted to talk about the 12th verse again as I finish this uh 2112 Revelation 21 12. and had a wall great and high had 12 gates at at listen to this now at the 12 uh at the gates 12 angels so there's an angel posted at every game right there's the gate with 1286 Hawaii is there an angel posted at every game every gate now recognize what is the gate what is the door a door's an entryway a door is the way that you can come in to wherever the facility is to this new city is through the gates now we know the gates are open all the time the Bible told us we read that the other day the gates are never closed by night or day of course we say night but there is no night per se but the gates are open all the time so these Gates of pearl stand open all the time and an angel posted at every gate so it's a it's an angel at every entryway of anybody that's outside the city that wants to come into the city there's an angel there standing guard well that's nothing unusual because the scripture tells us that the angels are always there at guard the Angels always stand at guard let's go to Rebel uh go to Genesis real quick I got a couple scriptures I want to read in Genesis chapter 3 Genesis chapter 3 Genesis chapter 3 verse 23 and 24. look at this now just even at the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve were kicked out of the Garden of Eden therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from when she was taken so he God drove out the man Adam and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims with a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the weight of the Tree of Life God Germans guarding Chairman's guarding the Angels guarding the way to the to the Tree of Life the Angels guarding remember we talked about months ago years ago Matthew Mark Luke and John the Angels guarding those gospels amen those angels notice revelation as Revelation gives us the plagues the vows the the warnings the the trumpetings there's angels that are there at God there's angels that God sends forward to Mark those that are crying and sign for the Abominations desolation done to the land read Revelation 7 you see those angels that are there uh uh Psalms Psalms chapter 34. verse 7 the angel of the Lord and campeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them the Angels those 12 angels are there to keep guard to watch over the entryway there's angels with you Saints today that watch over you and that protect the entryway that keep you from you said well you know things happen yes they do and God might allow that angel to draw back for a moment to allow a sickness or or something we don't know God does think different things for different reasons but we know that God look at job Satan couldn't even touch job if God didn't take that hedge away we spoke about that around Halloween God had to take that hedge away from job before Satan could even give to job and then God said God took an angel away let him get to all that he has but don't touch Joe so Satan could do everything but touch Joe and then the second time God told him and pulled back another that angel that was protecting him back and said now you can touch his flesh but don't take his life right amen so each one it had its place in position that it was guarding and protecting but he can only do what God allowed him to do right or first Sons and Daughters of God friend even if things may happen God will not allow any more to you than what he for whatever reason he may do whether it be an accident or a sickness or whatever it is if we're children of God now for not children of God God's not responsible to you but if we're children of God God's responsible he takes care of his own yes he does this is all nothing but a reflection of those Angels standing at guard of each place standing washed amen the entryway protecting that entryway keeping that entryway clear so that there's no there's no problems there's no issues amen God make sure that each one of those because when I looked at it when I first I said what what would be the point of an Angel being in every game well then it becomes clear it's all through the scripture it's not um it's not hard to understand or hard to believe it's all through the Bible God has his angels that are continually moving and doing whatever God commissions them to do yes amen that in his beck and call they're protecting our entry away for each one of us Satan can't even touch you without God's permission yes you believe that amen God Satan you can't even touch you without God's permission that's right amen what is it that angel is there guarding that way yes amen protecting keeping it amen so that nothing unforeseen or something beyond that happens amen God only allows what he desires or what he would let allow amen of those angels now of each one of those uh Gates I'm gonna close here um remember each one of those Gates is a gate of Pearl and I'm going to read this quote well it's not a quote it's uh it's uh from the Lexicon of that Pearl Pearl we know of course is is a literal Pearl I believe this Pearl will be literal Pearl just like I believe this city is a little city walls of literal wall foundations literal foundations I believe the gates their literal Foundation of literal city of transparent gold a literal Pearl that that God has created that is there with the names of the 12 tribes of Israel but there is also a again typology a reason for that Pearl we could go back in Matthew which uh Lord willing we'll do next time and and see and look at that that Pearl a lot of people get this backwards but I want us to see the true reference to that Pearl but if you look in the if you look in the Lexicon under this Pearl it says a pearl is a word of great value a word of Great Value a pearl is a word of great value not it's outstanding to know who this Pearl is who this Pro represents amen know that it is a word of Great Value he said yes God is of great value who is of Great Value to God amen praise let's stand to our feet I want to give it away Savannah some of you already see the churning so amen Lord willing uh we'll get to that part next time and much more of that too it's incredible I I thought it was going to be something more of a a little shorter along the lines of shorter but uh God just keeps adding and adding so just keep going on with it praise the Lord amen let's sing this course uh 398 this home book he paid the debt we've seen that I mean I may not sing all of them but just maybe the first verse here that means thankful that he paid that debt praise the Lord Jesus he paid that debt he didn't know it I owed it he means my dad he took my place amen I'm the one that should have been that on that cross I'm the one that should have died that cruel death I'm the one that earned it I deserve it but he paid it for me now I don't have to the Lord [Music] [Music] I needed someone to wash my sins away [Music] and now I sing a brand new song of Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus [Music] [Music] and now I sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus Christ [Music] away and now I sing a brand new song of Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus [Music] amen yes he did thank you Jesus praise your name Jesus so Hallelujah he paid it for a saint so we don't have to pay it he went so we don't have to go he took it so we don't have to take it amen it's all by his grace amen nothing we've done nothing we earned or deserved by his grace yes praise the Lord Jesus amen God bless you amen good to see
