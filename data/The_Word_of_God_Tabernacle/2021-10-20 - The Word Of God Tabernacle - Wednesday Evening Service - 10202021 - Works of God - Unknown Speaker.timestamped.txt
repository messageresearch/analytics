[37:45] verses here beginning with the 25th
[37:46] verse

[38:34] know and people that around me young and
[38:36] old lord are going

[38:50] us out of your hand

[39:06] them as well may your holy spirit come
[39:08] and power and manifestation take
[39:11] complete control over this service lord
[39:13] and the part of the ministering and
[39:14] bringing forth of your word father which
[39:16] we recognize acknowledge is the most
[39:18] important part that you address us in
[39:20] this word tonight may it come forth lord
[39:23] again empowering manifestation to show
[39:26] to us in here what you'd have us to see
[39:28] and know what would be here to
[39:30] bless us and help us encourage us in
[39:32] some way god we thank you father for
[39:34] this time and opportunity god again to
[39:38] uh to come to you to worship and to
[39:39] praise you now we expect you father as
[39:42] you said you would as you are lord hear
[39:44] lord to minister to us and to speak your
[39:46] word to our hearts may it not return
[39:49] void but accomplish in each one of us
[39:50] what you have it sent forth for and
[39:52] we'll give you all the praise honor and
[39:54] the glory for the name of the lord jesus
[39:56] christ amen
[39:58] saint john chapter 6
[40:00] verse 25
[40:02] read a couple of verses of scripture
[40:04] before we let you be seated again just a
[40:07] wednesday night just a little simple
[40:09] thought something that may be
[40:10] encouraging bless your hearts tonight
[40:13] saint john 6 25 and when they had found
[40:15] him on the other side of the sea they
[40:17] said unto him rabbi when cameest thou
[40:20] hither jesus answered them and said
[40:22] verily verify you ye seek me not because
[40:26] you saw the miracles but because you did
[40:28] eat loaves and were filled
[40:30] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[40:33] but for that uh for that meat which
[40:35] endureth unto everlasting life which the
[40:38] son of man shall give unto you for him
[40:40] hath god the father sealed
[40:43] then said thee unto him what shall we do
[40:47] that we might work the works of god
[40:50] jesus answered and said unto them this
[40:53] is the work of god that you believe on
[40:55] him whom he has sent yeah and you can be
[40:58] seated if you'd like
[41:01] amen
[41:02] you know a lot of times people are
[41:06] perplexed about the things that happen
[41:08] in their lives and what's going on
[41:10] and
[41:11] don't understand the things of the bible
[41:13] the things of god and
[41:15] it seems like
[41:17] let me just put it this way
[41:23] salvation
[41:24] is such an incredible gift
[41:27] it's the ultimate
[41:29] it's the number one
[41:31] if there was ever a gift that could have
[41:34] ever been given
[41:36] better than our salvation the lord jesus
[41:38] would have given it to us
[41:40] so salvation is the absolute best the
[41:43] forgiveness of our sins is the number
[41:45] one top best
[41:47] greatest thing that could have ever
[41:49] happened to us in our lives the
[41:50] forgiveness of sin the
[41:53] the the uh uh
[41:55] keeping from going to hell and lord
[41:57] taking it not just keeping us from but
[42:00] then taking us to heaven
[42:02] not just keeping us from the worst place
[42:04] that there exists but taking us to the
[42:07] very best place that exists
[42:10] and i guess it just comes into the
[42:11] mindset of people and and i know we'll
[42:14] say it does me too from time to time but
[42:17] it gets in the mindset of people that we
[42:19] just have a hard time believing how
[42:22] could this be free
[42:25] how could this be something that i don't
[42:28] have to work for it yes because from the
[42:30] day that we're born basically that we're
[42:33] taught to work where we used to be
[42:36] not sure about today's generation but
[42:37] when i was growing up people were taught
[42:40] to work right when i got old enough
[42:44] i was mowing grass or i didn't never had
[42:46] a paper rod or anything like that but i
[42:48] mow grass
[42:49] to have a little money and did things
[42:51] around the house wash my dad's car and i
[42:54] did things to earn a little bit of money
[42:56] so i could have a little bit of
[42:57] something for myself and i just was
[42:59] taught a work ethic from a very young
[43:01] age and i guess that we get to the place
[43:04] that when a man fell and he had to begin
[43:07] to work by the sweat of his brow that
[43:10] everything that he did came through
[43:12] labors came through sweat came through
[43:15] muscle came through strain came through
[43:18] giving of the strength of your body and
[43:20] when we look at salvation and there's
[43:23] absolutely nothing you can do to gain it
[43:26] there's nothing you can do to earn it
[43:28] there's absolutely nothing you can no
[43:31] work that you can do to earn it or
[43:34] inherit it you can't be good enough you
[43:37] can't find yourself in the self in the
[43:39] best place
[43:40] you can't come to church enough you
[43:42] can't give enough money you can't preach
[43:44] enough sermons you can't sing enough
[43:47] songs you can't give enough strength to
[43:50] be able to earn what the lord jesus has
[43:52] done for us and so many times people get
[43:54] in their minds i gotta do something amen
[43:57] i gotta do something and of course
[44:00] people in this situation when they get a
[44:02] little ridiology or religious when they
[44:05] feel like they have to have some
[44:07] religion to be able to get them to
[44:08] heaven of course the greatest thing in
[44:11] our time the greatest culprit of that of
[44:13] course is catholicism because
[44:14] catholicism is all about work work work
[44:16] work work the only way you're ever going
[44:18] to find favor to god is work the only
[44:21] way you're going to be pleased with the
[44:22] lord is is is is suffer and toil and
[44:25] work
[44:26] and be miserable that's the only way
[44:28] you're ever gonna that's the only way
[44:30] you're ever gonna get anywhere with god
[44:31] and that's what they teach you from the
[44:32] very beginning but there's absolutely
[44:35] nothing we can do there's not one single
[44:39] work we can work to work the work of god
[44:42] so what when they come and they ask him
[44:44] they ask jesus because he said labor not
[44:47] for that meat which perish so what meat
[44:49] are we laboring for and this is the work
[44:51] of god where or the
[44:53] works based religion whichever way i i
[44:56] kind of had two titles for this one but
[44:57] i i think i'm going with the works of
[44:59] god
[45:00] but he said labor not for the meat which
[45:03] perish which of course is the strength
[45:05] and the and the the muscle that we give
[45:08] and the sweat of our brow he said
[45:10] uh but labor for that which
[45:13] lasts their everlasting life
[45:15] then they send us so what did they
[45:17] garner from that from that one single
[45:20] sentence what did these people that that
[45:23] obviously disciples that left the lord
[45:26] they were only following him as he said
[45:28] because their bellies were full they saw
[45:29] the miracles
[45:31] and all these things happen and they
[45:33] followed after him like so many times
[45:35] people do the trick pony you know
[45:36] everybody sees the trick pony or the
[45:39] little
[45:39] the little uh miracle or the little this
[45:42] that and that always gets people's
[45:43] attention
[45:44] amen sometimes that's not even a lot of
[45:46] times probably that's not even of god
[45:49] but they got to see the little trick
[45:50] pony you know brother ram talked about
[45:52] uh uh being drawn to a fire rather than
[45:55] the painted fire right amen or actual
[45:57] fire brother you can't get warm from a
[45:59] pain in fire right
[46:01] so their their question this is what
[46:03] they get from what his statement was
[46:05] their question had become then they said
[46:07] unto him what shall we do
[46:10] so what are we going to have to do that
[46:12] we might work the works of god what work
[46:15] can we do right how can we earn this
[46:18] how can how can we merit this and
[46:22] what is it that you're looking for us to
[46:24] do what is it that we can do to be able
[46:26] to earn this
[46:28] and jesus said well if you want to do
[46:30] the work of god believe on him whom he
[46:33] has sent
[46:35] that's the work
[46:36] that is the work that is to be done to
[46:38] be able to obtain salvation and eternal
[46:41] life and forgiveness of sin is believe
[46:44] on the lord jesus whom he has sent
[46:48] that's the work
[46:49] pretty simple isn't it but you know a
[46:51] lot of people can't take that
[46:53] a lot of people that blows their minds
[46:55] they're thinking all i have to do is to
[46:58] believe on the lord jesus and then i can
[47:01] i can receive that meat
[47:04] i can receive that inheritance i can
[47:06] receive those blessings i can receive
[47:09] eternal life just by believing on him
[47:12] right yep
[47:14] that's it yes
[47:16] amen
[47:17] praise the lord that kind of shoots the
[47:19] work based religion all the pieces
[47:21] doesn't but people fish but people still
[47:23] do it
[47:24] a lot of times people get it in their
[47:26] minds i still got to do something
[47:28] i i got to do something
[47:30] but you know when you get saved and you
[47:32] get filled with the holy ghost and you
[47:34] believe the lord it obviously puts your
[47:36] feet on a path of righteousness that
[47:37] puts us busy working for the lord right
[47:40] i'm not discounting exactly because
[47:42] those works obviously just uh
[47:44] are just a simple display of the faith
[47:46] that we had in him exactly so our faith
[47:49] in him is that uh acknowledgement that
[47:52] he just said that gives you the meat but
[47:55] then you know you you continue on with
[47:58] the uh with with the work of the lord to
[48:00] doing whatever the lord puts on our
[48:02] paths to do we know we do that but it's
[48:04] not a work it's not a work then
[48:07] it's a life right see there's a
[48:10] difference in
[48:11] in laboring for the work and just living
[48:13] your life
[48:15] amen there's a difference
[48:16] there's a difference in working and
[48:19] and laboring for something or or
[48:21] striving for something it's sort of like
[48:23] the difference between uh uh
[48:26] living holiness and uh living legalism
[48:30] right
[48:31] a lot of people like to live legalism
[48:34] because they feel like they're doing
[48:35] something
[48:36] they feel like they're sacrificing
[48:38] something friends that's catholicism
[48:40] right
[48:41] uh ash wednesday or lent that's i think
[48:43] that's what's clint give up something
[48:45] for lent so you got to make sure this
[48:48] day or this one time you know they're
[48:50] going to give up something for lent
[48:52] that's not what jesus asked us to do
[48:54] that's not the what the scripture asks
[48:57] us to do amen truly sometimes we do
[49:00] sacrifice things that the lord tells us
[49:02] i know one time i got to uh i really got
[49:05] way too involved when i was in north
[49:07] carolina years ago and and i was
[49:09] purchasing manager i had a job and
[49:12] i had sales consultants call me all the
[49:15] time and they're always wanting to take
[49:16] me to play golf
[49:18] i had friends who wanted to go and take
[49:20] me and let's go play golf together and
[49:22] my brother-in-law loved to play golf but
[49:24] i it was like i was surrounded by dozens
[49:26] and dozens of other men and wanted to go
[49:28] play golf i ended up playing golf all
[49:30] the time to where i became so consumed
[49:32] with it
[49:33] i went to a prayer meeting we had at the
[49:35] church one night nailed down the front
[49:37] pew and the lord said stop it now
[49:40] i said but lord
[49:42] it's really not getting a hold of me you
[49:44] know how we are right it's really not
[49:46] taking control of me stop it now
[49:49] and i and and then i started thinking
[49:51] about it and then i started thinking
[49:53] about this and how it led to this and
[49:55] how i went to this and i thought oh my
[49:57] lord no wonder it is overtaking me it's
[50:00] like
[50:01] most of the waking moments i have is is
[50:04] about that game
[50:06] and the lord told me to stop it right
[50:09] and i did
[50:10] i stopped it from that time i quit
[50:12] playing
[50:13] i stopped playing
[50:14] and it finally got to the place that uh
[50:16] i felt the lord was like you know
[50:18] in moderation a little here little there
[50:21] of course now it's like once a year
[50:23] maybe
[50:24] at the most maybe two i don't
[50:27] just don't have time anymore really but
[50:29] but you understand what i'm saying it
[50:31] can't get to the place this is all
[50:33] consuming to you and the lord says i
[50:36] better be first in your life not this
[50:40] and then he'll speak to you and say okay
[50:42] you need to stop doing this but just to
[50:44] say oh i'm going to pick a friday and
[50:46] i'm just going to not eat a steak on
[50:48] that friday
[50:50] or or
[50:51] or whatever i'm not gonna go over my
[50:54] favorite bridge when i go home today or
[50:57] whatever i don't know what they decide
[50:59] to give up for lent but something that
[51:01] they just arbitrarily decide hey i'm
[51:03] gonna give this up and and and and i'll
[51:06] be okay
[51:07] but that's
[51:08] religion-based work right
[51:11] that's that's a work based religion
[51:13] that's not a that's not salvation
[51:17] that's not what god's looking for god's
[51:19] looking for something of faith and your
[51:22] faith then will cause you to start doing
[51:25] works for the lord but again at that
[51:28] point they're not works anymore they're
[51:30] a life they're just a life that you live
[51:32] for the lord jesus you do it for god
[51:35] it's not something you feel like well i
[51:36] got a work of work and these people they
[51:38] felt like well we got a work of work
[51:40] look what jesus said over here in john
[51:42] and saint john chapter four
[51:45] in saint john chapter four uh verse 31
[51:50] he said in the meanwhile his disciples
[51:52] prayed him saying master eat but he said
[51:55] unto them i have meat that you know not
[51:58] of
[51:59] now what did they get from that
[52:03] his own disciples
[52:05] obviously of course his holy spirit
[52:07] hadn't come back so it's just
[52:09] it was simply jesus with them
[52:12] if you want to know sort of what it's
[52:13] like that's a little different because
[52:15] the anointing is falling but if you want
[52:17] to know sort of what it's like to have
[52:19] uh jesus with you just read the bible
[52:22] and the men and the ones that were with
[52:24] them and how they acted and what they
[52:25] did and how they lived
[52:26] you'll kind of understand a little bit
[52:28] of what it is
[52:29] with jesus simply with you not in you
[52:33] see there's where the difference comes
[52:34] to the day of pentecost when jesus come
[52:37] in them then it changed them completely
[52:40] and then it's no longer you working the
[52:43] work again it's the spirit in you living
[52:46] the life
[52:48] jesus said i have meat that you know not
[52:50] of therefore said the disciples what did
[52:52] they get from that now
[52:54] one of the one to another have any man
[52:57] bought him ought to
[52:58] eat to thinking carnal
[53:02] amen thinking carnal
[53:05] jesus said unto them what is it
[53:07] my meat is to do the will of him that
[53:10] sent me and to finish his work
[53:14] praise the lord
[53:16] what
[53:17] how is that me different from the meat
[53:20] he was trying to give them
[53:22] how is that me any different than what
[53:24] he gives us today
[53:27] it's saying me amen that's the meat that
[53:29] we labor for
[53:31] that's the faith that we that we project
[53:33] is to do the will of the father to do
[53:35] the will of god whatever it is that the
[53:38] lord puts in our path that's what we are
[53:40] to do
[53:42] but it's not i i know it talks about the
[53:44] works in the bible i but i don't look at
[53:47] it as words
[53:48] again i look at it as is you you do it
[53:51] because it's just the life that you live
[53:54] because of who you are right yes
[53:57] so many times now
[53:59] years ago the lord showed me this even
[54:01] back where uh i was writing the book
[54:05] uh i i started the lord started to
[54:08] impress that upon me so strong
[54:11] and it seems like in so many different
[54:13] avenues and so many different passes the
[54:16] lord keeps bringing that very notion
[54:18] right back to me
[54:20] the difference is that
[54:24] we all live who we are
[54:27] and some people just aren't who they say
[54:30] they are
[54:32] that's the difference
[54:34] people who are
[54:35] who they say they are
[54:37] live the life that they claim to serve
[54:40] they emulate that word they emulate that
[54:44] life because they live that life because
[54:46] that's who they are
[54:48] right now it becomes a struggle of
[54:51] legalism
[54:53] if you're not born again
[54:55] it just becomes a fight and a struggle
[54:57] uh every time you have to try to put on
[55:00] that dress or
[55:01] let your hair grow or
[55:03] or or or or or be a man today
[55:07] uh just
[55:08] be what
[55:09] god has called you to be
[55:12] but if it's who you are it's not a
[55:14] struggle then it's a life of holiness
[55:18] because you're living who you are
[55:20] it doesn't become a fight it doesn't
[55:24] it doesn't become a push-pull because
[55:27] you're living the life of who you are
[55:29] because you're a christian
[55:31] you're a
[55:32] holy ghost field bloodball born again
[55:35] son or daughter of god amen and that's
[55:37] who you are
[55:39] if you're not that and you claim to be
[55:42] that you're just living a life of
[55:44] legalism
[55:45] and it becomes such a struggle it
[55:47] becomes so hard and you find people's
[55:50] lives becoming so miserable because they
[55:53] think they've gotta
[55:54] they gotta work this work
[55:57] well i've gotta work this work what
[55:59] would so and so say well friend i
[56:03] i don't take this wrong cause i do care
[56:06] right but i'm gonna say it this way i
[56:08] don't care what other people think
[56:11] i care what he thinks
[56:14] the one that i care the most about what
[56:16] he can is concerned with me is the lord
[56:19] not the people around me now i do i do
[56:22] care about what people think of me
[56:24] obviously we all do
[56:25] to a degree but i care more about what
[56:28] he thinks in other words i'd rather have
[56:31] the whole world hate me and him love me
[56:33] right than the other way around right so
[56:35] it becomes such a struggle for people
[56:38] and people live that struggle daily
[56:40] people absolutely daily you may know
[56:43] some who live that struggle of legalism
[56:46] because they're not who they say they
[56:48] are
[56:49] they're fighting that their their word
[56:51] they're trying to work that work and
[56:53] it's not in them to do they they fake it
[56:56] oh my i've seen people
[56:58] years and years and years and years go
[57:00] on
[57:01] and and come to message churches and
[57:03] live a live of what we consider a
[57:05] holiness standard
[57:07] but inside them there's the turmoil
[57:10] of having to work this it becomes a
[57:13] works-based religion then it's not faith
[57:17] faith is just living who you are amen
[57:20] and and that that
[57:23] battle cry really has
[57:25] continues to reverberate in in my
[57:27] messages and my thoughts and my
[57:29] witnessing and people i talked to so
[57:31] many times i was talking to somebody on
[57:33] the job the other day and i said george
[57:35] you can only be who you are
[57:37] yeah i i mean it just came out
[57:40] i said people can only be who they are
[57:43] they look that way because that's who
[57:45] they are right they dress that way
[57:47] because that's who they are i'm sorry
[57:49] going back into some things i've said a
[57:51] few weeks ago but it's just true they
[57:53] they listen to the music they listen to
[57:55] because that's who they are they paint
[57:57] and tattoo and scar and cut their bodies
[58:00] all over because that's who they are
[58:04] and i don't blame them for that that's
[58:06] just who they are yeah i just don't want
[58:08] them doing it next door
[58:11] down the road it's fine
[58:13] this man go over and go a few four five
[58:16] miles down the road open up shop and be
[58:18] successful whatever that's okay just not
[58:20] here
[58:21] but they can only do that because that's
[58:23] who they are
[58:25] but it becomes but as as christians as
[58:28] as uh
[58:30] people that call ourselves christians it
[58:32] becomes such a work-based religion for
[58:34] so many people
[58:36] they feel like they have to work that
[58:38] work and that's the only way they're
[58:39] going to be pleasing to god is if they
[58:42] do a work that's pleasing to god look at
[58:45] this let's go to matthew chapter 19.
[58:55] amen matthew chapter 19.
[58:58] let's look at this man we've looked at
[59:01] him off and on and i have a story of him
[59:03] in my book but
[59:04] um he's preached on quite often and
[59:07] man's put down quite a bit but you know
[59:10] again like so many other
[59:12] people so many other instances a person
[59:15] can only be what they are amen amen
[59:20] we just
[59:21] hope and pray they're more than what
[59:23] they're projecting they are you
[59:25] understand
[59:26] uh
[59:27] because you know we love people
[59:30] we we love the souls of men and want
[59:32] them to go to heaven we don't want
[59:34] anybody to go to hell so it it
[59:36] that's the burden that's the that's the
[59:38] conflict that we feel within us because
[59:41] yeah what on one hand they can only be
[59:43] what they are and who they are but on
[59:45] the other hand i want them to be more
[59:48] i want them to give their life to the
[59:49] lord jesus and quit living that way
[59:52] so that that becomes the conflict but
[59:54] look at this man here this man had a
[59:56] conflict he wrestled with jesus
[1:00:00] so to say he didn't physically wrestle
[1:00:02] but uh matthew 19 now of course uh
[1:00:05] three of the books record the ritual
[1:00:07] ruler story i still kind of favor the 19
[1:00:11] the
[1:00:12] the one in matthew even though
[1:00:15] there's a couple of other parts i like
[1:00:17] uh from uh luke mark and luke
[1:00:21] especially where the bible says that
[1:00:23] jesus
[1:00:28] didn't but i i like the way
[1:00:31] uh
[1:00:32] matthews is situated
[1:00:34] so yes this is about the rich young
[1:00:36] ruler verse 16 let's start and behold
[1:00:39] one came and said unto him good master
[1:00:42] what good thing look at how he starts
[1:00:45] off his conversation with jesus
[1:00:51] good master
[1:00:52] what good
[1:00:54] thing
[1:00:55] yeah thing
[1:00:58] work
[1:01:00] ability something i can do or give
[1:01:03] cause he's a rich man so what what can i
[1:01:06] give
[1:01:07] you know a lot of people have a habit
[1:01:09] especially a lot of preach people they
[1:01:11] have it of not really caring uh of
[1:01:14] consequences of actions they just try to
[1:01:16] throw money at it after it's done yeah
[1:01:18] yeah well here's a couple million
[1:01:20] dollars oh it's okay then no it's not
[1:01:22] okay you ruin people's lives but they
[1:01:25] they just throw money at it that's their
[1:01:27] solution
[1:01:28] and and i guess in my mind that's kind
[1:01:30] of what i would think this man is
[1:01:32] thinking he's thinking about
[1:01:34] along monetarily why
[1:01:37] what good thing shall i
[1:01:40] do
[1:01:41] that i may have eternal life so he's
[1:01:44] thinking right off this can be bought
[1:01:47] this can be paid for this can be worked
[1:01:49] this can be i can do something to to
[1:01:51] earn this
[1:01:53] he said unto him why call us thou mean
[1:01:55] good there is none good but one that is
[1:01:57] gone
[1:01:58] but if you will
[1:02:00] free moral agency now right god's given
[1:02:03] the man a chance just like he gave cain
[1:02:05] a chance just like every human ever born
[1:02:07] of a woman has been given a chance
[1:02:10] had an opportunity and free moral agency
[1:02:13] and he said if you will
[1:02:15] so it's up to you amen amen puts it in
[1:02:18] his lap if you will enter into life keep
[1:02:21] the commandments
[1:02:23] he said unto him which
[1:02:26] jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou
[1:02:29] shalt not commit adultery
[1:02:31] thou shalt steal thou shalt not not bear
[1:02:34] false witness honor thy father and thy
[1:02:36] mother and love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:02:40] now
[1:02:41] every one of these
[1:02:44] is in the ten commandments
[1:02:46] except one right and that's the last one
[1:02:50] the last one says thou shalt love thy
[1:02:52] neighbor as thyself why do you think
[1:02:55] maybe that jesus now i i depict this and
[1:02:59] have before
[1:03:00] as jesus discerning the man's heart just
[1:03:04] like brother branham did when people
[1:03:05] come up to him and the lord would
[1:03:06] deserve it and and so now it was the
[1:03:09] lord's discernment but the the lord
[1:03:10] would show brother brown right of what
[1:03:12] it was
[1:03:14] and so that discerning was going on
[1:03:17] and as the discernment is the discussion
[1:03:19] remember brother adam said you want to
[1:03:21] keep talking like this to contact your
[1:03:23] spirit right well why do you think jesus
[1:03:26] didn't just say didn't just cut the rich
[1:03:28] young ruler off he started talking to
[1:03:30] him right he engaged him in a
[1:03:32] conversation
[1:03:33] reaching contacting his spirit
[1:03:36] amen and
[1:03:38] and
[1:03:39] and then he tells him these few of the
[1:03:42] ten commandments but then he throws one
[1:03:44] in that's not a ten commandment why
[1:03:48] my assessment my feeling is
[1:03:51] that jesus found the impediment in the
[1:03:54] man's heart he loved his money more than
[1:03:55] he loved god right his his god was his
[1:03:59] money
[1:04:00] that now that's my the bible doesn't say
[1:04:02] that actually his actions later on
[1:04:05] pretty much prove that to be true but i
[1:04:07] say it this way he loved his money more
[1:04:10] than he loved god
[1:04:12] so god found that impediment in his life
[1:04:15] and said uh love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:04:18] now he thinks
[1:04:21] that he has this mages he says young man
[1:04:23] said unto him all these things have i
[1:04:25] kept from my youth uh you thought what
[1:04:27] lack i yet praise god jesus said
[1:04:31] again
[1:04:32] if you will
[1:04:34] amen he's still putting in his lap
[1:04:37] he's letting him know this is your
[1:04:39] choice this is your decision
[1:04:42] you have you're at a crossroads right
[1:04:44] now rich young ruler which way are you
[1:04:47] going to take
[1:04:48] he says if you will be perfect
[1:04:52] go and sell all thou hast and give to
[1:04:54] the poor and now shall have treasure in
[1:04:57] heaven and come and follow me oh my
[1:05:01] the one thing
[1:05:03] the one thing this is a good man
[1:05:06] this this man was such a good man that
[1:05:09] again the bible said he looked on him
[1:05:11] and loved him yes
[1:05:13] amen he looked up
[1:05:16] i mean this is actually contrary of
[1:05:18] course to when he platted the ropes
[1:05:20] and looked upon with anger and beat him
[1:05:26] with anger
[1:05:27] this man he looked on and loved him amen
[1:05:30] he loved him
[1:05:32] so
[1:05:33] we we know he had a compassion we know
[1:05:36] he was a good man
[1:05:38] but being good is not good enough
[1:05:40] working the works is not enough
[1:05:44] i hope mother teresa is there one day
[1:05:47] but
[1:05:49] i have my doubts
[1:05:52] i'm sorry
[1:05:54] i do
[1:05:56] the works based religion that she served
[1:05:59] was not enough to get her there right
[1:06:02] now i hope maybe before she passed on
[1:06:05] that the lord came into her life in her
[1:06:07] heart and she accepted him and
[1:06:10] uh
[1:06:11] and and and and the scripture was
[1:06:13] fulfilled in her life
[1:06:15] i don't judge anybody i don't know where
[1:06:17] anybody that's that's up to god
[1:06:19] that's that's his choice uh he there's
[1:06:22] been a many a bet dead confession
[1:06:26] death bed and i was and i wasn't there
[1:06:28] so i don't know
[1:06:30] i hope she did i don't know
[1:06:32] my point being is all the good things
[1:06:35] she did for the whole world all the good
[1:06:37] things she did for all the starving
[1:06:39] children and those that are sick and
[1:06:40] needy and that and that's wonderful god
[1:06:44] i mean i say god bless you she's gone on
[1:06:46] but
[1:06:47] you know what i'm saying
[1:06:49] but that in itself is not enough to get
[1:06:51] you there
[1:06:53] that in itself is not salvation working
[1:06:56] works is not salvation
[1:07:00] but a lot of people think it is yeah and
[1:07:03] a lot of people who may have even had
[1:07:05] that and they have even felt that
[1:07:07] experience almost feel like it just this
[1:07:11] just
[1:07:11] just got to be some work amen friend
[1:07:15] there is no word
[1:07:16] rest at peace
[1:07:18] amen and let the lord lead you
[1:07:21] wherever the lord amen that's where you
[1:07:23] go
[1:07:24] wherever you go that's what he has you
[1:07:26] do amen whatever he has you do you do is
[1:07:30] unto the lord yes that's every day
[1:07:33] everything and in every way
[1:07:35] you do it as unto the lord amen amen
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:39] that's how we do
[1:07:40] now this man
[1:07:42] when he heard this he went away sorry
[1:07:45] because he had great possessions
[1:07:48] amen he could not enter in because of
[1:07:51] his possessions
[1:07:53] this was the hindrance to him this was
[1:07:55] the thing that kept him out
[1:07:58] now it doesn't have to be hordes of
[1:08:00] money
[1:08:01] now and we know the man didn't go broke
[1:08:04] after this a lot of people say oh he'll
[1:08:06] he'll go broke down he got richer
[1:08:09] he had to tear down his barns perfectly
[1:08:12] nice buildings just to build bigger ones
[1:08:14] to hold all of his stuff
[1:08:17] so he didn't go broke
[1:08:19] he didn't get poorer
[1:08:21] but we know where he ended up the bible
[1:08:24] says so
[1:08:26] he ended in the regions of the lost
[1:08:28] just
[1:08:29] a dip of water
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:33] what was his desire though his desire
[1:08:36] was to do a thing
[1:08:37] to do something to earn it
[1:08:40] throw some money at it pay somebody help
[1:08:43] somebody do something
[1:08:46] to earn it you can't do anything to earn
[1:08:49] it
[1:08:52] if you've done what jesus said do
[1:08:55] to them in in john 16
[1:08:58] and that spirit has come into you then
[1:09:00] you live that life
[1:09:02] that god is pleased with just like we
[1:09:04] talked about sunday enoch walked with
[1:09:06] god was pleasing to god noah walk was
[1:09:09] pleasing
[1:09:12] amen and and
[1:09:14] and we know what the end result is in
[1:09:16] that case
[1:09:17] but it's not based on a works-based
[1:09:20] religion
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:22] it was
[1:09:24] something
[1:09:25] as this rich young ruler it was
[1:09:27] something
[1:09:28] that the lord had asked for
[1:09:30] that all of a sudden
[1:09:33] kind of like that uh kind of like that
[1:09:35] story that brother branham used to tell
[1:09:37] the eagles tourists her nest
[1:09:39] you know the eagles earth
[1:09:41] how does she stir that nest well she
[1:09:43] gets that nest first of all comfy and
[1:09:45] soft and gets all the
[1:09:47] rabbit skins and feathers and everything
[1:09:50] and she puts a nice pad down and when
[1:09:52] those babies are born their baby they're
[1:09:54] they're born onto a nice soft rabbity
[1:09:57] uh
[1:09:58] feathery bed and it feels so good
[1:10:01] but when those babies start getting a
[1:10:03] little bit older she starts carrying
[1:10:04] some of them feathers and a piece of
[1:10:06] that rabbit skin out and and all of a
[1:10:08] sudden the little place that used to
[1:10:10] feel comfortable to them they go sit
[1:10:12] down and hit a thorn
[1:10:14] because their nest is made out of thorns
[1:10:17] and they go and hit a thorn and now oh
[1:10:19] my that doesn't feel comfortable well
[1:10:20] pretty soon the nest becomes all thorns
[1:10:23] to where they get
[1:10:26] that's exactly what jesus does
[1:10:29] amen so many times that's exactly how
[1:10:32] jesus treats us
[1:10:35] and
[1:10:36] and move do something
[1:10:39] give work
[1:10:42] work the works of the lord or
[1:10:44] be led of the lord
[1:10:46] amen that that's that's what he wants us
[1:10:48] to do
[1:10:49] um
[1:10:50] ephesians chapter 2 verse 4.
[1:10:54] i'm going to close here just a few
[1:10:55] minutes
[1:10:57] ephesians chapter two
[1:11:02] but that nest
[1:11:05] that bene that nest became such a
[1:11:07] comfort zone for those little eaglets
[1:11:10] they got so comfortable and eased in
[1:11:12] zion
[1:11:13] i mean who doesn't you ever held a
[1:11:15] rabbit
[1:11:17] i love holding the rabbit so soft it's
[1:11:19] like one of the softest things i've ever
[1:11:21] held is a pretty little special little
[1:11:23] baby rabbit or so soft who wouldn't want
[1:11:25] to stay in that
[1:11:27] that's a comfort zone
[1:11:29] but this rich young ruler was in his
[1:11:31] comfort zone but once jesus said sell
[1:11:34] everything you've got not just a dollar
[1:11:37] not just a thousand dollars not just a
[1:11:39] house or a car
[1:11:41] sell everything you've got
[1:11:44] and take every bit of it and give it to
[1:11:46] your neighbors
[1:11:47] prove that you love them
[1:11:49] amen jesus was putting them to the test
[1:11:51] you say you love your neighbor as
[1:11:53] yourself then take your money and give
[1:11:55] it to them
[1:11:58] same difference right because it was
[1:12:00] your money but you love them as much as
[1:12:03] you love yourself
[1:12:04] so take your money and give it to them
[1:12:07] hmm he couldn't do it
[1:12:09] now jesus found something now the ten
[1:12:11] commandments he was a good fella so all
[1:12:13] that was nice and cushiony and that was
[1:12:15] good rabbit skin and every time he sat
[1:12:18] down on commandment he's like i've got
[1:12:19] that one he sit down oh i've got that
[1:12:22] one jesus named another and he said oh i
[1:12:24] got that one
[1:12:25] but then when jesus ripped out that big
[1:12:27] huge piece of rabbit skin and said sell
[1:12:29] all you got to give to the poor and he
[1:12:30] went and sit down on that thorn he
[1:12:32] couldn't he left his comfort zone then
[1:12:35] he had to get out of there
[1:12:36] because it was he he he was out it was
[1:12:39] out of what he wanted to do
[1:12:42] and that's a lot of times what people
[1:12:44] will do
[1:12:45] when they feel like they want to do it's
[1:12:46] like it's like the land i was talking
[1:12:49] about oh uh oh it's like me saying oh
[1:12:53] i'll i'll give up sushi this friday
[1:12:56] i i won't eat sushi this friday for the
[1:12:58] lord
[1:12:59] or or celery i'm i'm not doing any
[1:13:02] celery this friday and i promise you
[1:13:05] saints
[1:13:06] unless there is a miracle or some
[1:13:08] levitation or some change in my taste
[1:13:10] buds there'll be no celery entering this
[1:13:13] mouth friday
[1:13:15] none
[1:13:16] ever if i could ever help it the rest of
[1:13:18] my life but definitely so so friday i'm
[1:13:21] giving up i'm giving up celery for lent
[1:13:24] how's that
[1:13:25] that's the attitude a lot of people have
[1:13:27] oh i want to give to the lord but they
[1:13:29] only only give them what they want to
[1:13:30] give him right they won't want to give
[1:13:32] him what he wants it's like brother
[1:13:34] random free said uh doors in the heart
[1:13:37] and god goes in there and knocks and all
[1:13:39] the doors roam everything's swept
[1:13:41] garnish and everything's beautiful and
[1:13:43] oh jesus you're welcome in my heart go
[1:13:45] to any room you want to go in just to
[1:13:47] enter in and all and jesus looked over
[1:13:49] and said well what's that one over there
[1:13:51] oh well uh
[1:13:54] that door is closed um
[1:13:57] yeah you can't go in that one
[1:13:59] well how can you feel welcome
[1:14:02] amen how can you feel welcome every
[1:14:04] door's not open
[1:14:06] if everything is not open and welcoming
[1:14:08] to him how can you how can anybody feel
[1:14:10] welcome you ever gone on a house that
[1:14:12] looked like a museum and you got nothing
[1:14:15] nothing wrong with that i love people
[1:14:16] keep a clean house wish i could
[1:14:19] i i love people keep it clean how's you
[1:14:21] ever been in one museum and you're going
[1:14:22] and they're like oh make yourself at
[1:14:24] home and you go over and you sense oh
[1:14:25] don't sit
[1:14:26] there okay
[1:14:28] have anything in the fridge
[1:14:30] okay no don't take that
[1:14:33] well i'll stand here right
[1:14:36] i mean
[1:14:37] who feels welcome like that well jesus
[1:14:40] certainly doesn't
[1:14:41] and that's exactly a lot of people say
[1:14:43] i'll give you everything but don't lord
[1:14:45] don't touch this
[1:14:46] i can't give you that
[1:14:48] don't go over there and i don't meddle
[1:14:51] in that door now and that's and people
[1:14:53] drink god that way and that's not the
[1:14:55] way it works
[1:14:57] that's not how it and pardon the pun
[1:15:00] that's not how it works
[1:15:03] people want to work the works of the
[1:15:04] lord but it's just like the rich young
[1:15:06] ruler oh i give all this i'll do all
[1:15:09] this but when it came to giving
[1:15:10] everything he had and give it to
[1:15:12] his neighbors so we couldn't do that
[1:15:14] amen couldn't do that that was out of
[1:15:16] his comfort zone yeah and then and then
[1:15:19] you see where people get and it's the
[1:15:21] same religion people have a lot of work
[1:15:24] works but you know i only want to do
[1:15:26] what i want to do
[1:15:27] i'm only going to give him what i want
[1:15:29] to give him i'm only going to uh go
[1:15:31] where i want to go see i i don't well
[1:15:34] you need to go here and i don't want to
[1:15:36] go there
[1:15:38] no
[1:15:39] i'm sending you down here but i don't
[1:15:41] want to go there i'm not going to go
[1:15:42] there
[1:15:43] and jonah did that you know he actually
[1:15:46] charged about
[1:15:48] purposely to go a different direction
[1:15:50] he didn't even he jonah didn't just stay
[1:15:53] put he purposely chartered something to
[1:15:55] go the other way right
[1:15:58] and a lot of people that just did the
[1:16:00] exact same thing
[1:16:02] amen do the exact same thing
[1:16:04] i remember when we moved to florida i've
[1:16:06] said this many times
[1:16:07] we we had gone to florida on vacation
[1:16:09] and we were coming back up to florida
[1:16:11] and got in there and i said i looked at
[1:16:13] my wife and i said florida was a nice
[1:16:15] place to live live a visit but i sure
[1:16:17] wouldn't want to live here
[1:16:19] less than a year later what
[1:16:21] we were living there
[1:16:23] because god said you're going
[1:16:25] no
[1:16:27] that's what people do i'm not going to
[1:16:29] go i'm not going to do that
[1:16:30] but the lord always if you want to do
[1:16:34] what
[1:16:35] god is calling you to do you're going to
[1:16:37] be willing to do it whatever the cost
[1:16:40] ephesians chapter 2 i think i had to
[1:16:42] turn there
[1:16:43] ephesians 2 for
[1:16:46] verse 4.
[1:16:48] the god who is rich in mercy for his
[1:16:50] great love wherewith he loved us even
[1:16:52] when we
[1:16:53] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:16:55] quickened us together with christ by
[1:16:57] grace are you saved
[1:16:59] and as
[1:17:00] up together and made us sit together in
[1:17:02] heavenly places in christ jesus that's
[1:17:05] our spiritual rapture
[1:17:07] that in the ages to come he might show
[1:17:09] us the exceeding riches of his grace and
[1:17:11] his kindness toward us through christ
[1:17:12] jesus
[1:17:13] by grace are ye saved
[1:17:16] through faith
[1:17:18] which goes back to jesus john 6
[1:17:21] believe on him who is he whom he has
[1:17:23] sent faith right so it's by you are
[1:17:27] saved by grace through faith
[1:17:32] and it's not of yourselves
[1:17:34] it is the gift of god
[1:17:37] it is not a works
[1:17:39] that any man should boast about
[1:17:42] right amen
[1:17:44] now what is the what is the work of work
[1:17:46] the work of god to believe on him whom
[1:17:49] he has sinned
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:52] that faith will put your your feet on
[1:17:54] the path on that straight and narrow
[1:17:56] path to work the work of the lord
[1:17:58] let me read a couple other scriptures
[1:18:00] here romans chapter 9
[1:18:03] verse 30.
[1:18:06] romans 9 30
[1:18:08] what shall we say then that the gentiles
[1:18:11] which followed not after righteousness
[1:18:13] have attained
[1:18:14] to righteousness listen now
[1:18:17] the gentiles which followed out not
[1:18:20] after righteousness have attained to
[1:18:23] righteousness even as the righteousness
[1:18:26] which is of
[1:18:28] faith
[1:18:30] righteousness of the gentiles is a
[1:18:32] righteousness of faith
[1:18:34] not a righteousness of works
[1:18:37] not a righteousness of law
[1:18:39] but a righteousness of faith
[1:18:43] by grace are you saved through faith
[1:18:46] so our righteousness is nothing we did
[1:18:50] nothing we could ever do amen we receive
[1:18:53] that righteousness and we become that
[1:18:56] very righteousness
[1:18:58] by faith in jesus christ
[1:19:02] but israel which followed after the law
[1:19:05] of righteousness so the law is righteous
[1:19:08] people want to you know say about the
[1:19:10] law but the law is righteous
[1:19:13] and israel follows after that
[1:19:15] righteousness but they follow it by a
[1:19:17] law
[1:19:19] not by a life
[1:19:20] they follow it by a work and not by a
[1:19:23] faith not by a life
[1:19:26] it is the
[1:19:28] legalism
[1:19:30] to our holiness
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:35] hath not attained to the law of
[1:19:37] righteousness of course we know the
[1:19:39] scripture says no flesh no flesh can't
[1:19:42] be righteous by the law
[1:19:44] it's impossible
[1:19:46] since the fall and sin entered in
[1:19:48] there's no way that we can attain to
[1:19:51] that it is no way to be able to be
[1:19:54] righteous enough to live every single
[1:19:57] law of god
[1:19:59] amen
[1:20:01] wherefore
[1:20:03] because they sought it not by faith
[1:20:05] but as it were by the works of the law
[1:20:09] so they tried to work the work they
[1:20:12] still tried
[1:20:13] they're doing their best to do it
[1:20:15] and god will honor that god dawgs on it
[1:20:17] because that's his people amen god
[1:20:19] that's his people so he is honoring that
[1:20:22] when he comes back and then they will
[1:20:25] do their works
[1:20:27] when jesus comes and reveals himself to
[1:20:29] his people friend they don't receive the
[1:20:32] righteousness of jesus by work
[1:20:35] by a law
[1:20:36] they receive it because they finally
[1:20:38] believe in their messiah
[1:20:41] they receive their messiah and the
[1:20:43] righteousness of their messiah then
[1:20:45] comes on them
[1:20:47] but of course that has to be after god's
[1:20:49] done with the gentiles
[1:20:51] after the after the
[1:20:54] the rapture after the wedding supper he
[1:20:57] comes back and reveals himself
[1:21:00] amen and then that's where they attain
[1:21:02] it but now as it says
[1:21:05] they sought it not by faith but by works
[1:21:07] of the law for they stumbled at that
[1:21:10] stumbling song which was jesus christ
[1:21:13] as it is written behold i lay in zion a
[1:21:15] chief stumbles uh stumbling stone and
[1:21:17] rock of offense and whosoever believe on
[1:21:19] him shall not be ashamed jesus christ
[1:21:22] again they weren't blinded cults god
[1:21:24] said you're blind
[1:21:27] i'm blinding your eyes and you won't be
[1:21:29] able to see it they were blinded because
[1:21:31] they had
[1:21:33] everything else in mind that they were
[1:21:35] looking for
[1:21:36] they weren't expecting their messiah to
[1:21:38] be born on a manure pile they weren't
[1:21:40] expecting their messiah to be told about
[1:21:42] how he was an illegitimate child and his
[1:21:45] mother had him out of wedlock she wasn't
[1:21:47] that that wasn't something they wanted
[1:21:49] right they weren't looking for their
[1:21:51] messiah to come and and rags and and and
[1:21:54] walking through dung and
[1:21:56] and living the life of a pauper
[1:21:59] they they were expecting a mighty god to
[1:22:02] come and raise shoot down from the sky
[1:22:04] and come and i am your god worship me
[1:22:08] smite all the enemy and
[1:22:11] and slay them and kill them and
[1:22:14] right there in front of it that that
[1:22:15] wasn't
[1:22:16] that wasn't the bible
[1:22:19] and that wasn't the work of god
[1:22:22] but that's and so they missed him their
[1:22:24] eyes were blinded because they were
[1:22:26] looking for something else
[1:22:28] amen
[1:22:29] you know you can look right at something
[1:22:31] and not see it
[1:22:33] and have you ever done that
[1:22:35] i've actually i have looked right at
[1:22:36] something how many times they said
[1:22:38] you're looking for something say honey
[1:22:39] i'm looking for this i can't find this
[1:22:41] and then all of a sudden you see and
[1:22:43] it's sitting right there and you think
[1:22:44] mine if it was a snake it bit me
[1:22:46] you ever said
[1:22:47] this is a snake you bit me
[1:22:49] looking right at it miss it
[1:22:52] but that's what people do
[1:22:54] and they missed him because they tried
[1:22:56] to work a work
[1:22:58] they tried because they were they
[1:23:00] blinded to what they were expecting and
[1:23:02] their and they they tried to attain
[1:23:04] righteousness by work
[1:23:07] they try to obtain the righteousness of
[1:23:10] god by a work and it doesn't by the work
[1:23:12] of the law it doesn't work that way
[1:23:14] again pardon the pun but it doesn't work
[1:23:16] that way
[1:23:17] it comes by the righteousness of jesus
[1:23:19] christ through faith
[1:23:21] and by grace by that faith through the
[1:23:23] grace you are saved
[1:23:25] and that's and then we simply it is it's
[1:23:28] that simple
[1:23:30] then you become the righteousness of god
[1:23:33] i was gonna
[1:23:35] read james chapter two
[1:23:37] if you wanna
[1:23:38] go there read that later or i'm gonna
[1:23:41] close here but uh if you wanna read
[1:23:43] james chapter two it talks about the
[1:23:44] conflict of faith and law and works and
[1:23:47] and and
[1:23:49] having works by faith and that type of
[1:23:51] thing we know those scriptures but
[1:23:54] the point then is
[1:23:56] that
[1:23:57] it's not something that we can earn
[1:23:59] right
[1:24:00] it's a free gift that god gave us now it
[1:24:04] cost him
[1:24:06] but it's free to us
[1:24:08] the work that we work for god
[1:24:10] is the acknowledgement of faith that we
[1:24:12] have that he is thank you king of kings
[1:24:15] lord of lords the almighty god
[1:24:19] alpha omega beginning ending first and
[1:24:21] last
[1:24:22] top bottom all-around
[1:24:25] rows of shared lily of the valley he's
[1:24:27] everything amen we acknowledge that we
[1:24:30] believe that and we live as such
[1:24:32] amen
[1:24:33] our lives
[1:24:35] are not a life of work
[1:24:37] they're a life of
[1:24:39] of expression of christ
[1:24:42] of that spirit living in us
[1:24:44] again
[1:24:45] if you live who you are it doesn't
[1:24:48] become
[1:24:49] labor
[1:24:51] amen how many have you ever heard if you
[1:24:54] if you do something you love for a
[1:24:56] living you'll never work a day in your
[1:24:57] home
[1:24:59] i've never been able to do that but i
[1:25:02] sure would like to
[1:25:05] i love doing this i love being a pastor
[1:25:08] but the other stuff sometimes
[1:25:10] entrepreneur on the roof of a house or
[1:25:12] something sometimes isn't much as much
[1:25:14] fun but uh i i enjoy it though with
[1:25:16] brother roger it's very nice uh
[1:25:19] the fellowship but you understand
[1:25:23] it's just being who you
[1:25:24] are just being who you are then it's not
[1:25:27] a labor it's not a work then amen
[1:25:30] it becomes a work when you think oh i've
[1:25:32] got to do this i've got to do this and i
[1:25:34] i got to work this work and i've got to
[1:25:37] you know i got to
[1:25:39] quota of people this week that's
[1:25:41] and people get that in their minds but
[1:25:43] it's not about that right amen amen be
[1:25:47] led of god
[1:25:48] let the lord lead you before he leads
[1:25:50] you he'll he'll
[1:25:52] bless you where he blesses you he'll
[1:25:54] give you work to do whatever that work
[1:25:56] is he'll show you
[1:25:57] you do it faithfully amen when that
[1:26:00] works over you do something else
[1:26:01] whatever else he sends you amen
[1:26:04] praise the lord but it's the work of god
[1:26:07] what did jesus say was the work of god
[1:26:09] believing on him whom he has sent
[1:26:12] amen praise god let's stand if we could
[1:26:14] amen
[1:26:20] amen leaving on him
[1:26:22] whom he has sinned and a lot of people

[1:26:26] and i even talk to people from time to
[1:26:28] time good christian people
[1:26:30] good godly people
[1:26:32] and they keep having in their minds
[1:26:43] they make their lives miserable
[1:26:46] they get in a state of depression
[1:26:48] because of it
[1:26:49] oh friend don't let the devil do that to
[1:26:52] you
[1:26:52] amen
[1:26:53] there's no there's no sadness depression
[1:26:56] negativity in the lord at all
