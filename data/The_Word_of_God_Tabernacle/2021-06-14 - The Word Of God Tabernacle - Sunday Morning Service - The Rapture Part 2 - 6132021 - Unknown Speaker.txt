blesses us and speaks to us strengthens us moves amen and i'm thankful for that praise the lord god bless you amen a couple of things i want to mention to you before we get into the word today brother mike holloway i didn't put a prayer request in for him i just wanted to explain it to you just briefly uh my brother mike holloway sent me a text wednesday you know we've been praying for him and he's had that heart issue and he said that he's feeling wonderful everything is perfect he's doing good at body and he got a different cardiologist they're going to do a scan thursday this week he's going to meet with the expert friday for another revaluation so the doctors are telling him he shouldn't be feeling better uh you should be feeling worse but that not in god's book i believe brother mike's jumped in the water i believe he's gotten some healing but i want you to remember him in prayer if you would amen brother michael always hold a a very special place in my heart i love him dearly but just please remember to pray for him his wife tracy too but he's going thursday for that test and friday for the vows to remember him also please remember sister joy hockamy i know i'll put the prayer request for her i just wanted to make that a quick request just to you know as we move the service along but sister joy is in a very dire situation she really is there's nothing the medical community can do for her there's no apparently there's no medicine and give her painkillers but that's about it there's no operation or whatever the bones are going back together and crooked and she's in constant pain so please remember her prayer if you would she's very depressed and despair um uh maybe shouldn't have said that but she just she really needs a touch from the lord so please remember her in prayer um apparently she hasn't had many reaching out to her or offering to help or their home or anything and uh it's just a tough situation for living in constant chronic pain like that in itself right we'll do a we'll do a number on your mind yes uh and put you in a state of despair and depression so please remember sister joy hawk to me in prayer if you would amen so appreciate you doing that god bless you amen as you're standing let's turn in our bibles now to first thessalonians chapter 4. amen i think i've come down a little bit enough to preach praise the lord i felt enraptured sitting back there to be honest with you amen praise the lord but there's there's more than one kind of rap film you know that we'll we'll get to that eventually in this study but it's actually more than one kind we're supposed to be living in heavenly places right we're supposed to be caught up in heavenly places amen as we live our lives so praise the lord amen let me get this started here still record those first thessalonians of course you know uh chapter four we're going to begin with reading with verse 13 but before we do let's bow our heads in for word of prayer precious jesus lord we thank you so much father for your visitation and our presence here today as you promise to do and as you always do and as once again you are faithful to you father lord we just give you glory praise and honor yes lord for everything that you do for us every day god but we come here this special appointed set aside time lord to meet with the precious saints of the of those of like precious faith expecting and believing you lord to visit with us again and feeling your holy spirit come once again sweeping through this place god oh lord may you do a miracle amongst your people once again whether they're streaming whether they're here whatever the circumstance the conditions are whether it's healing deliverance uh lord just make every rough place smooth make every curvy road straight make every healing flat lord and god just help our vision to stay focused on you and whatever it might be god we don't we don't expect our lives to be any easier per se lord but lord we just want to make sure that we keep our eyes firmly focused on you and your leadership and our lives and what you'd have us to do and where you'd have us to go and lord just be fully led by your spirit yes god we know that we're in the last days we're no we know that we're in the closing moments of the world's history father and lord this bride internationally is looking for a time yes god here now the the changing of our bodies yes lord for looking for our loved ones to show up in any time god i i almost feel like i'd open my eyes now and see my son sit back there next to my wife yes god is that time yeah and we believe him we believe it's that time lord and whether maybe we can see them or not we believe god that they're here we believe that you're here and lord we're looking for that time that body change you call us home to be with you thank you so much lord for your word thank you for the encouragement that we get from it the revelation of it lord that changes our lives and makes us new creatures in you god i pray that you would speak to us now father from it and lord may you not and they will not return void we know that but accomplish it in each one of us that you send it forth for god we give you the praise honor and the glory for it lord and lord we just continue to press this battle as you give us the strength and the health and the life to do so and for this service bless those who weren't able to make it today for whatever reason those who may be streaming lord we just commit all things to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 we'll begin reading but i would not have you to be ignorant bro uh ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so then also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them or hinder them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so i love this part so shall we ever be with the lord amen wherefore comfort one another with these words yes you can be seated if you like amen you know there's every service brings its own unique uh challenges it brings its own unique spirit word and uh afterwards uh in the position that i'm in that uh ministering it it brings the different perspective probably maybe than it does you there maybe not uh but every once in a while uh i'll end the service and in my mind i'm still uh preaching just keeps coming it just keeps going and it keeps coming and honestly friend i gotta just i really um i gotta stop saying that i'm not lying to you i don't lie to you so it's just horrible to be honest i'm always honest but uh try to anyway right but the truth of it is i i was this was in my spirit all week uh continuing from where we left off from last week knowing that you know we have the time constraints and that we uh do what we can under the time and all that god gives us and i went a little over an hour last week but it just kept going in my spirit all week really i was preaching this message in my heart and i i i started uh working on these things during the week and then yesterday morning and uh and i wrote some things down i felt the lord had for today and and continuation of last week and it just kept going and i thought well you know that i kind of you know get to the place where you feel like there's notes there that's going to take you through a service and and then stuff just kept coming and so i got another piece of paper and i just started writing down on that piece of paper and uh just as the lord kept feeding it so yeah i'm i'm not a very smart man i just do what i feel led to do amen and that's all i know to do so i i can't say any better or worse or anything but just to do what the lord puts on my heart to do amen amen so uh i'm thankful that the lord does that but i'm thankful that we know that there's going to be a rapture very thankful to know that there's going to be a catching away amen of course last week we ended up getting to the place it was kind of outside my notes but to the place that we were speaking on faith and rapturing faith and rapturing grace and what it would take for a body change and get us into a rapture amen everything that comes with it and uh from the spiritual aspect aspect of it in that point and i've quoted a scripture several times that i want to read today and that's the next place i want to go romans chapter 10. i quoted this scripture quite a few times last week and establishing something that's actually been on my heart for years because i've heard so many people and i have felt the same way i've told you this many many times in thinking uh the service we go to and the word that's heard and everything that goes on and and sometimes you can look back and you can think carnally and and in your carnal thinking you can look and think are we any closer than we were 30 years ago 33 or so when i first started preaching i thinking lord and brother did the same thing yes you know brother brown did the same thing he said all the preaching i've done 30 years or whatever worth the preaching i looked at it as more bob here and more slackware and women and everything going on all the sin and stuff is on the increase and it's worse than it was 30 years ago and so i know he did the same thing and i look sometimes i think are we any closer because uh there is a bride friend and i believe i'm a part of that right i believe you're a part of that right and if we're a part of that bride we are closer now than we were within america it's just inevitable based on the fact of the truth of god's word that's all it is i'm not basing it on anything that i could see tears full smell here i'm not basing on any imagination region constant infection memory i'm basing it solely on that sixth cent of faith and that faith based on god's word telling us who we are and where we are and that the word cannot return void read that scripture last week but this scripture i read i quoted several times i did not read it and i told you this had been in my mind and i was witnessing to this to a brother the other day and i quoted the scripture to it and it and it dawned on me as he actually completed the scripture that i that i that something struck me it's like the holy spirit spoke to me that there's something there you need to go home and look at that so i did and i looked at this scripture more so let's read it it's the 17th verse romans 10 17. and and then you probably see where we're going then so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god now it's never really dawned on me anymore other than the fact that faith comes by hearing and that we quoted remember last week many times faith comes by hearing amen but when you but when but when for some reason when that brother quoted the entirety of the scripture to me again the holy spirit spoke to me and said there's something more there you need to look at so like i said i went home and i started looking at it and reading it and i sat there and i prayed and i said god what is it in here that you want me to see what is it in here that i'm missing because the wording of this seems very strange i mean read it listen listen again faith come by hearing and hearing by right and that's just kind of odd when the point that you're trying to get across is the faith caused by hearing what is it that that's there that is that that i just say that i was missing lord what is in that scripture that i was missing that i wasn't seeing and this is after sitting there and praying and looking at i'll tell you what the lord showed me faith comes by hearing now we know what that is faith comes by hearing that's pretty simple that's the part we understand we know that faith comes by hearing by hearing is when you hear the word spoken to you amen that's simple we understand that part but look at the conjunction here faith is just doesn't come by hearing it comes by hearing and hearing by right now i'll be honest with you again i'm not i'm not a very smart person never claimed to be some great intellect but that stumped me i could not understand or could not grasp the revelation of what this scripture was speaking to us and you remember we talked about revelation last week we talked about it again a little bit at our luncheon yesterday which we enjoyed very much brother john god bless you thank you miss brother art we missed you and miss brother danny being there with us uh when we have it again i encourage you to come hope you can come i know you had to work but uh but we enjoyed it very much and we were talking about it again yesterday revelation the rapture is a revelation faith is a revelation so if you bring the two together you're basically saying the same thing right amen faith is a revelation the revelation takes for body change revelation is something that comes to you uh that becomes a part of you brother pat gave us his explanation yesterday of what of how he uh brings it in his mind and how he sees it which is perfect sense i've told you uh it becomes a part of you uh i think i've even told you one time that i've looked at you ever seen that jesus plaque that used to be popular many years ago that said jesus but but they accentuated the inside the parts jesus and a lot of times when you look at it all you see is a bunch of jumble and people say well that that says jesus and when you look at it you're like i don't see jesus all i see is jumble and you may have done the same thing i don't know different people probably saw a different way maybe you saw jesus straight off i didn't and i'm sure you know what i'm talking about yeah and i always thought was the inside parts between the letters all i saw i didn't see the j-u-s-u-s i saw the little things because it was accentuated but once i saw once i spent a time looking at that and once i saw jesus in there the next time i looked at it or the next hundred times i looked at it i could only see jesus amen see when it becomes a revelation that's all you can see amen brother brown or brother uh pat talked about and this dip probably may be different for all of you but brother pat's a mechanic and he says you know somebody can tell you all day long how the inside components of a combustion engine work and how the pistons go up down and the oil and everything and the and all that has to keep the motor going to get for the motor to be running he said but once i took a motor apart and i saw it and i could see it and i saw the components and i knew how it worked he said now it doesn't matter how many times somebody explains it to me i know how it works because i experienced it right yeah then then you can't unexperience it you can look at a full-blown engine all in a in a car with everything around it and you can see what's inside the engine because you know what's there right you've experienced it it's become real to you amen that's kind of another another carnal interpretation of a spiritual revelation but it's the same thing once you see it you can't unsee it that's a revelation no matter how many people try to come to you and say oh no it works this way in this way this is inside there and that's inside there he said no no no no it's not because i've seen it i know what's in there amen somebody could come and say oh jesus said be baptized follow some holy ghost so no no no no god's already showed me right it's already been revealed to me i know how baptism in the scripture is supposed to work in the name of the lord jesus christ once you see it you can't unsee it you know it's there that's revelation faith come by hearing but now faith comes by hearing by hearing is when you hear the word spoken to you yes but it says and so there's another component it's not just you hearing the word because faith comes that way yes but it also comes or or it continues to come or the greater portion of that because see anybody can sit in here today anybody could be streaming or see this on archives and they can hear the words spoke and it will bring a certain level of faith but friend we're not talking about just a certain level of faith we're talking about rapturing faith we're talking about body changing faith like we talked about abraham and sarah yes body changing faith not just a simple faith that comes by hearing but there's another component and to the believer and to the bride which is where i focus this message not just on the simplicity of faith but god's faith in his bride amen for a rapturing group for a alive and remain group that's the focus this message is upon and the bible says that it comes by hearing and hearing by now if you ever heard or or or seen billboards or watched a commercial or something and they and they say so and so and such and such is brought to you by right that tells you that the the hidden entity over there over there is the one who produced the product right well when you're hearing by something that's the word speaking back to you by revelation amen as the revealed word speaking back to you because now you're hearing by the word you're just not hearing the word spoke to you you're hearing the word minister to you because it's now by the word so it's not just uh the word or by hearing but it's hearing by the word brought to you by this faith is brought to you by because see it's a living word the word is alive amen and it's a living oracle and if it's a living oracle then it speaks right remember brother brandon preach the thinking man's filter what is that that's a person who has the holy spirit filtering what he does things says acts through that word amen that's the word speaking yes you understand that's the word speaking when a revelation comes to you that's the word speaking well who is the word jesus christ is the word yes well that's where revelation comes from so when he's hearing by the word the word is speaking back to you amen praise the lord that's the spirit of god making the word known to you revealing the word to you letting you see that word see that different perspective of that word is just not just a drunkard sitting on the back row listening to the word being priest walking out with a certain level of faith no that brings in the element of god's children god's bride a rapturing faith of the word speaking back to you it's like baptism anybody can go get baptized and witness to the rest of the world that they've accepted jesus as their personal savior and that's all fine and good but you're not saved until what until god witnesses to the rest of the world that you belong to him by putting his spirit in you now there's the difference just like hearing by hearing and hearing by it's you hearing that word but then it's the word speaking back to you yes it's the word witnessing to you revealing to you what that word is that you're hearing amen what it means to you what it is to you who christ is to you it's him speaking amen amen because he's living he's alive and he's ministering to you through his word that's where the faith comes from or the rapturing faith not just a simple faith to know that when you flip the switch the light is going to come off but a rapturing faith amen a body changing faith a faith that will take this pride out of this place today amen amen praise the lord amen amen enraptured that's what we're looking to being enraptured now we know the scripture not a couple of the scriptures i had before with ephesians chapter 4 uh verse 11 and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers yeah now for the word to speak back to you you have to hear the word spoken yes if you don't hear the word spoken you don't know what that element of that word is right you've never heard it it's like somebody saying uh well i know what the bible says but you've never read it if you've never read it how do you know what it says if you've never heard anybody expound on it how do you know what it says you can assume what it says you can presume you can think you know but you don't know until you've heard it right you don't know until you've read it i i talk about quotes and things in the message how do you know what brother branham said unless you've listened right how do you know what a certain thing is unless you've done it unless you've listened to it well how can that word speak back to you if you've never heard it spoke to begin with that's why paul in romans is talking and coupling that scripture with ministry just like paul goes into the ephesian church and does the exact same thing and says that he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers and what are they for to bring the word right amen a god called man will bring the word and the word only right yeah he won't bring his opinions he'll bring the word and the word only he won't bring it from some seminary or or some uh institution of some kind not to build some kingdom or to make himself any more important or higher or better or more revelated right but no he'd just speak the word it just preached the gospel word as it has been brought to us and of course through the message of the hour in this last day my question is just think for a moment if you if if you went around every message church in the world and you asked everybody in every one of those church and take a poll hold a conference what would you say the message is how many answers do you think we get thousands tens of thousands of what a person some people think the message is just a bunch of quotes by william brown right friend i'm sorry i don't mean to giggle that's not the message the message just isn't a bunch of handful of quotes by william branham that's not the message right the message is jesus christ the word made manifest in your life that's the message yes sir when they when brother branham talked about the message going back to the jews that's pretty simple people think well who's going to do it who's going to go over there god's going to go over there jesus christ is going to go over there and they're going to say where did you get those stars he says in the house my friends right they're going to realize that they crucified their very messiah that's right and they're going to do what they're going to accept the messiah which is christ the word the message amen but i bet you'd probably get hundreds of hundreds of answers thousands maybe even tens of thousands you think about in tucson or even in arizona how many people she said what would you say the message is what would what would be the answers i'd be interested to know absolutely i'm not going to do it but it would be interesting to know amen when it's when it's very simple but god gave a ministry to bring the word to a people and that's exactly what god called ministers do right they bring the word to the people so the people hear the word and as that word is heard then it speaks back now that word might not speak back to you while you're sitting there it might speak back to you when you get your car right might speak back to you get home they might speak to you in your prayer time tomorrow when you're witnessing somebody next week but it'll speak back to you yes because the word is alive it's living and the word speaks the word brother graham said the word bleeds with the word gleans you know the word speaks because the word is christ amen you can't lose the element of that just with the verbiage it's jesus christ it's the word speaking back to you that's the witness of the spirit in your life when that word speaks back to you you got to hear it first the five-fold ministry and it's for the perfecting of the saints the perfecting that is the completion that is the the the uh uh maturity level to bring a maturity level of christ and how does that come by faith amen it it is a perfecting not not that you're gonna be sinless so that you're never gonna make another mistake that's that's not the kind of perfection it's talking about it's talking about a maturity right yeah a level of adulthood in christ for the work of the ministry for the edifying the building up of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of what faith till we all not not the word of god tabernacle not tucson tabernacle not just tucson or arizona or the united states but until we all who is the all that encompasses every believer on the planet earth that god has predestined and ordained to be in his body amen all yes well that makes it an international rapture that calls for the rapture of god's children to be worldwide internationally that's why it's more than just a a a scientific experiment or proof to say oh we're being caught up well you know the people down there on the other side of the earth they're saying up to we're pointing that way and they're pointing that way which way is up tell that to a scientist see what their answer is which way is up i'm pointing that way they're pointing that way but they're up and i'm up the only up is the word christ yes that is up here being caught up as being in christ that's what being caught up is catching a way to meet the lord in the air yes oh we're gonna get to that too amen we're gonna get you see those all you you see how uh how the how the activity of all these uh anomalies flying around everywhere has increased yes now i don't know if it's increased to the degree they think it has or there's just more cameras around than there used to be right i mean anybody sees anything now they swipe in their pocket and they take a picture of it you know surveillance cameras the little things this big how many people have these little doorbells with with cameras on them to catch things or cameras in people's cars uber lyft drivers and and and and people like that have little cameras in their cars facing out seeing all these all these things are captured all over the place now what's the increase of it amen brother said one's going to drop down pick you up one of these days praise the lord amen but we'll get to that another time but look the unity of the faith is to bring the entire body of christ into that same place that's why the entire body the ministry should be speaking the same thing right now not the same subject but the word right amen i don't have to be preaching the same subject as a as the brother down the street this morning i'd be fine and dandy that's great happens a lot too but as long as it's the pure unadulterated word being ministered that's what we're talking about even if somebody's pushing a tape button or or or they're uh in a different country as long as the word of god the unadulterated word is being ministered then it's reaching that place of speaking to people's hearts and letting that word speak back to them yes to bring rapture faith a unity a unity of faith because this is going to be in a moment the twinkling of an eye for the entire bride body internationally and the moment and twinkling of an eye so it's got to be a unity it can't just be happening here and not happening over there right it can't just be happening in this country and not in the other countries it can't just be happening to this believer not this believer it's got to be a unity yes it's got to be an entire body coming together under that headship of the revealed word the word speaking back amen the word speaking to your heart right faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god brought to you by jesus christ not some company not some broadcast or something around the world but brought to you by jesus christ praise the lord by faith faith is coming to bring a unity of faith to speak to people that living word that word that's a lie that speaks to you and lives through you amen now how much faith think of this how much faith does it take to bring a body change you ever thought of that how much faith do you think it would take to cause your body to be changed into incorruption immortality how much how much faith does it take for a rapture to happen for a group of people internationally when a faith is the great of a mustard seed can move mountains faith is the grain of a mustard seed is enough to move mountains how much faith is it going to take to cause a body change amen you ever thought of that because people always well we've got to have enough faith or our faith's got to be increased we got to get more faith how much faith does it take amen how much faith does it take friend look when you look back at abraham and sarah you look at abraham and sarah and see by the word again hebrews 11 11 through faith also sarah this is the same scripture we read last week sarah herself now talked about abraham you know what let's just read that it's it's only 11 30. eighth first by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance he obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promises in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and neighbor is god amen brother brown teaches us that in future home that that that abrah he believed abraham had a communion with fellowship with melchizedek right on that spot right right on that spot because what abraham was looking for was not going to be manifested in our time element that city that abraham was looking for is the city that we're longing to go through go to that will be after the white throne judgment right amen after the marriage said for the lamb after the white throne judgment right yeah that city he believes set up right there with the exact spot robron said abraham and melchizedek had had fellowship and communion right on that spot but whose builder foundations the builder and maker is god through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised amen now what about the story of abraham and sarah in genesis would even remotely cause you to believe that they had the kind of faith that it took to bring a body change what is there and i'm not talking about romans i'm not talking about new testament reflection of abraham and sarah written by god i'm talking about the story of abraham and sarah written in genesis as it happened right what about their lives now i know abraham left and he went out and obeyed god's word yeah of course he stumbled a couple times he impregnated hagar they're still fighting over there today ishmael isaac still fighting over there today but but but the bomb woman will never be heir with the free woman right right it belongs to god's chosen right and that was isaac anyway but what about this scenario when they got to that age and god talk to abraham abraham i'm going to visit you abraham i'm going to visit you my promise is abraham i'm going to visit you even change their names from abraham to abraham and sarai to sarah even change their names and i'm going to visit you i'm going to meet with you and god continually telling abraham this is going to happen hagar no no no no abra abraham my promise is going to come through sarah but she's barren doesn't matter amen when god came with the investigating judgment angels amen when he came with them and abraham stood there and and and god had his back to the tent and he was explaining to abraham what he was going to do and that this child was going to come through sarah she laughed at him she like in fact brother adam said that god would have destroyed cher right there if she wasn't part of abraham and the promise right for laughing in the face of god she laughed at it so what about those stories would even remotely lead us to believe that they had the kind of faith that it would take to bring a body change amen that's quiet didn't it quiet when i thought the same thing for when they thought came to me what about their stories read their stories again go back to genesis read about abraham and sarah yeah right and show me yeah abraham walked by faith god continually talked to abraham too but what what was it that would bring enough faith to cause a body change now this reverts back to my question my prior question how much faith does it take to bring a body change if faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word and god's revealing that word to you and that word is becoming settled in your heart then that faith is in you whether you realize it or not and when the time comes as i said before when the time now we're talking i'm talking about believers yes i'm not talking about make believers unbelievers i'm not talking about people playing church or thinking their bride i'm talking about the bride of jesus christ okay amen because people still i still give people all this this brides and a mess no friend she is not i cannot make that any plainer or clearer in my opinion she is not amen she is the virtuous sinless a bride of jesus christ unadulterated word herself she is not out of place she's where she's supposed to be yes but we always expect again that great sound to go off some great thing to think oh i i you know i can do anything but that faith is being built in you as you hear the word yes it has to be yes because that's the bible it's being built in the bride of jesus christ because she is the one to whom that word is speaking back to and as that word is speaking back to you and witnessing and revealing itself to you it's lifting you to it and elevating you to a place that first of all makes you want more there you go second of all to a point that when that appointed time happens friend it's going to happen instantaneously to every bride member that's alive and remain across the planet amen and it'll be by faith a unity of faith so what kind of faith did abraham and sarah have it says right here it says in genesis that sarah was past the age of fairy she was her body was beyond bearing children friend she was 90 years old could you imagine sister pat being 90 and having a kid oh no sister norman no could you imagine after she was past that age dead wound milk veins dried up and god still anointed and blessed her enough to be able to bear a child to be able to have enough faith the bible says here through faith so sarah had to have the faith yes where was it i can't find it in genesis right but it was there yeah amen sometimes i look at my life and i say faith what faith where is your faith you pray for this and this and this over and over and over you you approach god about this this and this over and over and over where's your faith amen you do the same thing i do the simple answer is it's there okay you know the problem we have the body changing faith isn't necessarily based on the amount of faith you have understand it's not necessarily based on the amount of faith you have now it is but not simply based on that but it's also based on the amount of faith the amount of freedom your faith has to operate that's the problem a lot of people run into the freedom to be able to allow the faith to operate in your life the faith may be growing the faith may be building the faith may be there but does the faith have the freedom to operate in you as it should right right brother branham kept his life so clean and so pure that when the time come there was nothing to clog the channel of the faith he needed to reach god for the people yeah amen amen now it didn't always happen right but multiple of course on most occasions it didn't rid the hindrance that's the best thing read the thing that hinders your faith the most unclog the channels right first john tells us that if our heart condemn us we can't have confidence in god what's the confidence the confidence is faith if our heart condemns what is that that's a clog if you've got a clog in your sink you call roto-rooter or whoever mr plumber or whatever they are you call a plumber you get out of a a device or something you try to unclog the drain because no water is going to go through that pipe as long as it's clogged and if there's something clogging the channels of your faith friend you've got to unclog it or your faith is never going to reach the place it needs to get what you're praying about amen or what you're needing from god so the faith may be absolutely there but the hindrances and the things of life clog it up so much it's not able to get through got to clean that channel yeah unclog the pipe get rid of all the hindrances that that keep our faith bound because then it comes to us and your heart condemns you and don't forget there's a devil out there that's going to try to ride you every moment of the of the day he's going gonna be on you every second of the way yeah trying to convince you what a horrible lowdown rotten person you are and the horrible rotten thing you did yesterday or the thing you said this morning or how bad a person you are right that's the devil yeah amen he's good at reminding us of every single one of our failures in this life amen but you know what i like to do i like to remind him the fact that he is a failure and a mistake amen well i don't want to say a mistake because god made it that's not one mistake but what he became he is himself a failure not just does he fail he is a failure that's all he is amen but he'll remind you all the time so you've got the best thing to do is keep all the clan the channels clear to keep everything uncluttered the faith that's there again how much faith does it take if it takes a grain to move a mountain how much it takes for a body change whatever it takes that faith needs to have the freedom to operate in your life even if it's a simple headache yes or toothache or whatever it is amen see we have ailments and illnesses friend look they used to bring people in cots and stretchers and wheelchairs to brother branham's meetings right when is the last time you saw somebody wheeled into a church service in a in a stretcher or a cot why not yeah is god not god today amen is he not the same today as he was then amen amen is he not able to heal do we not have the faith friend i'm here to tell you it's not the fact that this bride has less faith than brother branham but the channels get clogged that's right and people lose their confidence that's right and then you and then you see what you see right i like sister pat's testimony last week she's supposed to be walking she walking doesn't care just do it just walk take the next step take the next step hold that hurt take the next little that hurt take the next one defy that devil defile everything about your body that's screaming at you telling you you can't do this and yes by jesus christ and the word of god i can yes that's right by faith i am i will amen and unclogged that channel that's just something that he remember brother adam said healing is is a is a temporary resurrection amen he said divine healing is a temporary uh resurrection yes it's a it's a changing of your body it's a taking that body from a sick condition to a well-conditioned yeah which satan cannot do all right say satan cannot do that only god can create right so if god's creating and creating it out of you then what is the hindrance of our faith why was the faith able to operate the way it did with brother branham when people brought cops and stretchers and wheelchairs of people in hulk lame blind dead remember the quarter rich the other day that woman who came in with her dead baby she was sitting there all day waiting for those meetings to start just so she could get that her dead baby to life right to a place where there was life amen and then the word goes forth the word gets spoken they let people set their whole service and let the word minister to them let the words speak to them faith comes by hearing the word amen the bible says the word went forth and healed them that's just a simp that's just a simple spiritual application to what the the grand scheme of the whole thing is going to be with the with rapturing faith the grand episode of rapturing faith that's just a small part of it has god ever healed you of anything amen amen anything yes well if he's done it once casey do it again do you think god gets glory out of you being sick you think god gets glory out of you being an invalid or poor god gets no glory out of you being downtrodden and and and sick right he gets no glory from that not to mention the fact that you can't perform the purpose that god put in your life unless you're well amen amen break those chains yes amen loose that spirit amen let god have the full reign and unclog that pipe amen let that faith move yes let that faith be able to operate and have the freedom to do what it needs to do in our lives yes amen that's awesome you still brother you that sounds simple it is it's the devil that complicates the whole thing to make you think it is unattainable right all the rapture must be eons away no it is not not in my opinion right now nobody knows today or the hour and i don't either and i'm not going to tell you what day or time it is but friend i can tell you it is the season for it amen we're living in that time of the body change of the rapture you know all the a lot of going by the way of the grave yeah and when they go by the way of grave what happens to them they get a body change very much amen and that celestial body will come and pick up this terrestrial body in a in a glorified condition and we'll all go to meet him and so shall we ever be with the lord right amen my contention to you my exhortation to you again today friend is that faith is there that faith continues to build my my challenge to all of us including yours truly is continue to stay in that word amen continue to let that word speak to you continue to pray and let god reveal and speak back that word to you amen when that when that voice spoke to me and said go back and study that there's more to that it didn't just happen right there i had to go back in my study i had to talk to the lord i had to pray about it i had to look at it and see lord what is it in there it didn't just happen like that and then and then when it broke forth is praise the lord amen amen and then that spoke to me right that word spoke to me it said that's exactly right it's the word speaking back it's a conjunction of god speaking back to me the word speaking as a living oracle to me amen yeah amen those channels have got to be unclogged friend those channels have got to be uh um uh free had the freedom to operate look what brother branham said here and works his faith expressed appropriate message i guess under circumstances amen works his faith expressed so well brother united saying his faith they say faith well it's got it's got to be faith yes i'll agree with you but if it but if there's hindrances there it's not going to operate the way it's supposed to it's not gonna your faith let's just say that that right now everybody in here has rapturing faith it is in you now you have it right and you know brother ramsey said rapturing faith lies in the message amen that's well i like to try to listen to the messages as much as we can because it's in there amen praise the lord but let's just say everybody has rapturing faith right now this just just for for example just talking if if everybody in here has rap stream faith what will it take for that faith to come forth for something simple in your life like an ailment you have right now or something you're praying for for your family or or your loved one or or friend or another church member what would it take well let me just read this to you works his faith expressed he said we allow it sometimes we say he's talking about ministers he said well this guy just didn't have enough faith this guy didn't do this and this if they come up and pray for him and they don't get healed so well they just didn't have the faith well they just didn't believe they just didn't do this and this that's what brother brown's getting there he said there's a reason there for that listen real close now there's a reason there for that there's a reason sometimes it's unconfessed sin right now what is unconfessed sin that is a big nasty hairy clog in your bathroom sink amen it's clogging the channel right because your heart's condemning you because you know you're wrong when you should do what you know is right yes he says sometimes it's unconfessed sin it's not the faith it's not saying well he doesn't have faith no it wasn't the faith it was the unconfessed sin but the man didn't say he didn't have enough faith he just said he had them confess sin or sometime that would be what it is or something to a clog in the channel is what i mean right i believe that's what he meant unconfessed sin is gonna clog that channel right unconfessed sin is gonna keep from that faith allowing that faith to operate the way it's supposed to it'll do it every time unconfessed sin brother says you could put a gallon of oil on that person and scream till you got a horse but that devil has every right to stay right there right yes that devil will not move no sir he said you've got to confess that make that right now he's talking specifically about unconfessing i'm talking about things that clog the channels things that clog up that faith or clog up that connection that we should have with the lord that allows that faith to freely operate amen amen i'm going to i'm going to believe this i'm going to pray for this i'm going to speak this and and it's going to happen and there's just no doubt about it yeah there's no questioning it there's no back-up plan it's going to happen amen amen praise the lord yes amen it's going to operate with god's perfect will in our lives too as it should it has to yes but if our heart doesn't condemn us then have we confidence to god does not condemn us then we have confidence to god if the channels aren't clogged then we have the faith right then it's or or it has the ability to operate amen it has the ability to operate and that's what and that's what has to come in our lives whatever it is the channel has to be clear for that faith to continue to operate and it will amend this in this bride you say well where is faith it's there friend and again i'll contend with i'll contend this with anybody it has to be there because that's what the word says yeah faith comes by hearing right and hearing by and if that person is born again now it has to be a born-again christian i'm talking about the bride again not just somebody claims to be or whatever then now then that faith is going to be there amen it doesn't look like it to abraham and sarah but it was there yes it didn't look like that and how many places scripture you can look at how why how could this have happened i mean jesus the lunatic boy was falling in the water in the fire and his disciples came after god had just endured them with power and they come and they try to cure it and they couldn't do it yeah now we know brother brown tells us epileptic spirit is a very difficult spirit a very hard demon to pray off but they couldn't do it jesus called him perverse faithless and perverse imagine jesus coming to his own disciples he hand chose in front of the crowd of people that was standing there and calling his own chosen faithless and perverse how long did i have to be with you how long am i going to have to suffer you bring him to me amen jesus rebuked the devil he left the very hour yeah they came to him said jesus why couldn't we do that it's because of your lack of faith he said if you have faith the grain of a mustard seed you can move the mountains but it only comes by prayer and fasting yes right amen prayer and fat not praying fast prayer and fasting amen amen amen and then that because that helps bring faith in your life i i'm not going to ask for hands but how many of you have a regular prayer life don't raise your hand but how many of you have a regular prayer life if you have a regular prayer life when you come out from your prayer closet or whatever it is wherever it is whatever time it is your prayer time do you not do you not feel closer to the lord do you not feel better about everything everybody it's when all those spirits and the things of the world start pounding you and bombarding you that starts weighing all that stuff down but when you're in prayer and i encourage you to fast amen as you all know i fast every sunday morning i don't eat anything before church on sunday even we had church at 1 30. i didn't eat till 4 o'clock in the afternoon because that's just my time of the lord i got that because i used to i started fasting every wednesday in north carolina and i got to work i i just and fasting to me isn't just missing a meal some people say well uh fasting is starving yourself no it's not right no no fasting is taking the time that you would spend gorging yourself at a meal for the lord and taking that time for the lord and spending that time with him i i've had people on wednesdays at my job come ask me let's go to eat lunch no no i don't go to get my car i'd go in in a parking lot somewhere where nobody would sit there and pray just talk to the lord or whatever it was i i wasn't a monk and doing you know i just talked to the lord right amen yeah and it makes such a huge difference yes fasting and praying praying and fasting right and and when you do that again my question is when you do that don't you feel better don't you feel all stared out and you feel like all your sins are gone and you feel like god heard you and you feel like uh you feel like a renewed person amen well then what is it then if it's that for that time then then how about if it's just a continual process in our lives that we keep going that we do all the time every day you know paul said pray without ceasing right you know obviously we don't set in our classes 24 7 but it's just a simple purposeful continual meditation people like to do their yogas and stuff and their meditation and all that you know that's hinduism i'm sorry i just don't do that i do what the bible says yes and there is a godly meditation there's a scripturally right way to do it but it's between you and the lord jesus yes not some dead god or something amen he said it brings inner peace what brings inner peace is jesus christ in your life amen that brings inner peace and you know it and when you're there and you know it that brings faith it brings an unwavering faith yes unclogs the channels yeah amen unclogs the channels because you know when you talk to the lord and you ask god god forgive me you know he's done it you know that you know that god's forgive you of your sins the transgressions mistakes you make the challenge for us as humans is the next time we go in prayer with him make it less things he has to forgive you for amen and then the next time you go on prayer with them make them to be make their less things he has to forgive you for yeah and then less things he has to forgive you people say oh god will forgive me yeah he will but that's not the point that's not where we're headed right amen we're headed to a point that we couldn't do anything to be displeasing to him amen nothing that would displease the lord what does that do that brings faith yes that unclogs the channel it allows that faith to operate the service we had today amen and i i know i talked about mike and zach last week but i just appreciate how much um i i thank them for doing it but i failed to say how great they're getting at doing it too uh i i it just astounds me i i just love to see it but it's just it's just god doing it you know you practice at anything enough you get better and better at it you know you say well that person wasn't meant to do that well just give a little bit of time yeah i told you about our song leader in north carolina when we went when he's been 30 years now but when brother richard my old pastor put him up there to lead songs he'd come up with a book and and he would go 42. he'd stare at the wall and sing 94. he's here at the wall and singing 126. he'd stare at the wand sing and he'd take his book and he go sit down yeah as much you could get out of him really and now he's placed a guitar he's up there singing and he runs up and down and praise the lord and amen it's just god hit him it changes everything amen so i appreciate that but just just this morning in this service just the power of god moving through here friend there should there shouldn't be one single person leave from here sick today amen there should not be amen the power the presence of the holy spirit is here right now and there shouldn't be one single sickness leave here not one praise the lord i believe that channels amen become unclogged amen amen don't let the devil dig those things up that you put under the blood and try to convince you of them yes amen amen say that spirit it's gone it's done amen i'm a new creature in christ jesus amen that clog is unchanneled that's the kind of rapturing faith we're gonna need that's the kind of body changing faith i want to say something else too friend last week when i talked about um the message in the word i wasn't trying to belittle the gifts of the spirit now nobody said this to me but i kind of felt that when i was sitting there i didn't want you to feel like that i was trying to put down uh speaking in tongues or or the gifts of the spirit in any way the gifts of the spirit should be operating in every local assembly according to brother brown he said that's what keeps the church clean that's right i wasn't trying to belittle it but i want to put it in his proper place yes amen and you cannot major on minor and those gifts are a minor the major is the word christ yeah that's that's the point i wasn't trying to belittle it but put it in its place the word is what's the prominent uh part amen the word and the word speaking back to you amen let that word speak back to you let that faith grow yes faith grow sure i'm not saying that their faith shouldn't grow but the challenge too is continue to stay in christ amen read his word listen to that message amen i'd say come to church but you're here but that's part of it too yes amen and let that word speak to you praise the lord it doesn't just come from newton bennett amen it comes from god's got ministers all over the world not to mention the message yes the tapes which is christ anyway christ ministered to you the cohesiveness of it will bring that rapturing faith and that and that rapturing faith remember faith operates by love amen that faith operate by love praise the lord let's stand if we could i'm going to stop there praise the lord amen you love the lord jesus amen i'm so thankful that he is always ever present with us yes amen praise the lord 493 let's sing this chorus amen 493 i want to live the way he wants me to live we're living the way he wants us to live friend then i believe that channels will be clear yeah right amen channels will be clear you know sometimes we get in such a desperation which brother man talked about desperation sometimes we'll get in such a desperation that all the other things are just washed away yeah there won't be it they'll that desperation will draw a tunnel vision in and all you can see is christ you can't see all the other stuff around and that's all the things that hinder all the other things around us all the hindering stuff so i put blinders on horses so they'll just keep staying on the right path they won't see all the kids playing over here and all the lights flashing over here they'll just keep the focus and desperation don't do that and that's what a lot of times you get you see supernatural things people get into a desperate condition and that tunnel vision comes and all you see is the healing it'll be a vision like brother random had with those people so many times where he says i see you running down the street and they're sitting there in a wheelchair crippled i see you brother running down the street god's showing him he's entering into that vision man gets up and runs down the aisle it's that same thing it's that vision you might not see that vision the way brother brown saw it as a literal uh focus in front of you but you see that vision as you step into it a well person or whatever it is you see that as it is and nothing else than then everything else leads away and faith meets that need and the healing comes right amen praise the lord [Music] until there's just no more to give i want love to there's just no [Music] the oh he wants me to live [Music] until there's just [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah you believe that praise the lord that's your desire today yeah amen let's see this one more before we did uh go today number 617 more of you amen this course just the chorus amen how many needs more of him today amen said if there's a desire in you to want more of him that just proves that there's more of him for you amen praise the lord amen with all our hearts now more of you [Music] i need more [Music] [Music] lord hear my prayer [Applause] [Music] it yes but what i need is [Music] lord hear my prayer amen yes lord jesus hallelujah let there be more amen as we grow closer to him as we become more like him that word revealed to you amen that word coming real in your life that word speaking back to you amen you know brother brown said this pride has become the word amen what is that that's that word speaking back to you right amen when it comes back to you and it changes you and you're molded into the image of that word that makes you the word amen a bride fit for a rapture and every age down through from pentecost on through has had each one of their members come as a part of that problem there's brother bram said from the feet to the head it's where the intellect will be on the intellect today amen it's god jesus christ the body of christ amen internationally worldwide body praise the lord that's going into rapture you believe that rapture is soon i believe it's very soon friend i don't know what time i don't know what day but i know we're here very close we're very close to the end keep your spiritual eyes open for your loved ones maybe it's going on amen if you have any i hope you do amen i feel like i got more over there and i got here now amen sometimes it seems that way but keep your spiritual eyes open they'll start appearing at any moment amen we'll go home be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord amen amen god bless you continue to pray for us as we continue this thought subject we'll see where the lord goes from here there's so many parts and facets and things about the rapture the message the scripture and i just want to try to approach it the way the lord would want and allow and be a blessing to you so and help us our faith and growing closer to the lord so he may god bless you remember the prayer requests he meant all the things that were brought forth us this this morning in service uh the friar hosts are wanting to get prayed for so they're supposed to be here shortly but we're going to go ahead and dismiss i'll pray for them
