[10:55] is a wooden blowing this morning a man
[10:58] what you had your seat please we have
[11:00] some special announcements today so
[11:01] we'll just invite brother Ben amen
[11:11] praise the Lord hallelujah
[11:13] I mean we could our brother could be and
[11:15] if you could come forward and also
[11:17] brother Aram and good morning start of a
[11:20] new year so we need to you know we're
[11:23] gonna we've going to make some changes
[11:26] with Sunday school and and also brother
[11:28] could be now Deacon is going to just lay
[11:30] out a few you know go through the how we
[11:34] want to conduct ourselves in the
[11:35] sanctuary and and and in the church and
[11:38] I just want to read this quote before he
[11:40] comes forward and this is really the
[11:41] thrust of the intention behind this is
[11:44] that so brother brown says and you know
[11:47] it as I'd be not afraid he sees how God
[11:50] is my prayer to wake up the church again
[11:52] to an old-fashioned all-night prayer
[11:54] meetings wake the people to a spiritual
[11:57] atmosphere it takes that to bring
[11:59] children into the kingdom it takes the
[12:01] atmosphere right this night while we're
[12:03] sitting here if this if this right
[12:05] atmosphere would take place
[12:07] this entire group would be refilled with
[12:10] the Holy Ghost every sick person would
[12:12] be made well it's the atmosphere that
[12:15] does it you can take a hint
[12:17] put it in an incubator and keep their
[12:19] atmosphere right it'll hatch out a
[12:20] chicken not see see because it's the
[12:23] atmosphere that counts and if the right
[12:25] atmosphere is here Eagles will be born
[12:27] it takes the right atmosphere so we want
[12:30] to you know we shouldn't take this place
[12:32] for granted you we know that you know
[12:34] and compared to the great cathedrals of
[12:36] the world this is nothing but God has
[12:38] allowed us to have this place and the
[12:40] landlord has given us a very good rent
[12:42] he's been good to us since we since
[12:44] we've been here and um so I believe we
[12:46] should treat this place with respect
[12:48] because we've come here not to meet with
[12:50] one another we have houses to go to go
[12:53] out the back or here to meet God well
[12:55] you want to have an atmosphere where he
[12:56] comes down you know we can't just take
[12:58] four
[12:59] groaning well we're a Christian he has
[13:00] to meet us no we've got to come in the
[13:01] right Atmos right atmosphere the right
[13:03] attitude so just with that in mind I
[13:06] brother convene if you come forward and
[13:08] just um lay out the good morning church
[13:13] I greet you in the wonderful name of our
[13:16] love and Savior Jesus Christ I come
[13:19] before you would all love today just to
[13:21] ask of you for the few things that we
[13:23] have to get right within ourselves our
[13:26] church is a very sacred place it's very
[13:29] wonderful to have a church as brother
[13:31] being said yeah in the valley there's a
[13:33] reason why we are here so there's lots
[13:35] of work to be done while we are here for
[13:39] each one of us we have gifts and we want
[13:41] to use those gifts we want to call on
[13:42] those gifts and if you have a gift and
[13:45] it's not being used
[13:46] please tap me on the shoulder and I can
[13:48] point you in the right direction we have
[13:50] people we have seniors and elders within
[13:53] the church group that will help you and
[13:54] and and get you started I had a young
[13:57] man Caleb come to me last week being the
[13:59] first service he said please use me
[14:01] he likes technology you'd like to help
[14:03] out in the back that's what we're
[14:05] looking for I encourage you to please
[14:08] come forward there's lots of little
[14:09] things that we need to do within the
[14:11] within the congregation within our
[14:13] church group and and we'll need that
[14:16] help so taking point of order we're
[14:19] gonna start firstly with the fire escape
[14:23] routes
[14:23] so our entrance is in the front one 1/3
[14:26] George Street we come up the stairs if
[14:27] you need the escalator we have the keys
[14:29] for that we come into the sanctuary we
[14:33] put up a wall trying to be a bit more
[14:35] private so the people standing in front
[14:38] convening or if the past days in front
[14:40] already the service has started it
[14:42] doesn't disturb the service but if you
[14:44] come into the service while the service
[14:45] has started please be silent and take
[14:49] your place find a seat for yourself try
[14:51] not to disturb the service in any which
[14:53] way what that entrance coming in we have
[14:55] two exits out the back and using the
[14:57] front one as well as an exit if there's
[14:59] a fire alarm or any emergency that we
[15:01] have to leave the building we can use
[15:03] any of those three doors going out try
[15:05] to do it in an orderly fashion
[15:06] single-file so no one clips over each
[15:08] other the back staircase is quite steep
[15:10] even the front the stairs we don't want
[15:12] to
[15:12] run out in trip over and we'll assemble
[15:15] out in the front of the building next to
[15:18] the concrete pad where the cars are
[15:20] parked now or if the fire is too big if
[15:22] there's a fire in the place we'll cross
[15:24] the road and be safe but no children are
[15:26] to cross the road without their parents
[15:27] so we just want to make it safe for
[15:30] everyone when the service is finished
[15:33] and the service has been dismissed by
[15:35] the pastor as much as it is a dismissed
[15:38] by the past day it doesn't mean to say
[15:39] everyone needs to run out in an orderly
[15:42] fashion we need to be quiet
[15:43] the deacon standing by the door shake
[15:45] his hand or the brothers standing at the
[15:46] door shake his hand children outside if
[15:49] the weather is good if the way this bed
[15:51] will congregate behind the door but what
[15:53] we find it is behind the door our
[15:55] children are too loud so we need some
[15:57] assistance there with parents who's
[15:58] finished pray and are willing to go out
[16:00] the back to be with the children just to
[16:02] keep them quiet while the sanctuary
[16:04] school stays humble and peaceful while
[16:07] other people are praying it's very
[16:09] important that we do not break that
[16:11] atmosphere as our pastor said this
[16:12] morning an atmosphere is set in that
[16:15] atmosphere we all want to enter in and
[16:17] we all want to be one with God at that
[16:19] time so we don't not need the
[16:21] disturbance so please parents if your
[16:24] children go out please keep them quiet
[16:26] in the sanctuary there should be no
[16:28] eating no chewing of gum no slouching
[16:32] and sleeping so all children that are
[16:34] aged school-going age I should ask a few
[16:37] this morning please stand up praise the
[16:40] Lord with all your heart when the
[16:41] service is on as well concentrate look
[16:44] forward pull from the past or whatever
[16:46] the God is giving him to give us let us
[16:49] pull from that this morning let us take
[16:52] a next step it's a new year for us we
[16:54] don't want to be same like yesterday we
[16:56] come here to be renewed to be changed to
[16:59] be washed so please all look forward no
[17:02] one looking back no one looking at the
[17:03] new person that came to the church and
[17:05] looking around and and being distracted
[17:07] the distraction hinders somebody else so
[17:11] we need everyone to be in line this
[17:13] morning and we're asking only with love
[17:15] we're not we're not pointing fingers at
[17:17] anyone we're not saying or calling
[17:18] anyone's name we all do it at times so
[17:21] please help us Lord this morning let's
[17:23] look forward let us see what's happening
[17:25] in front of us
[17:26] let us keep our heads focused up high
[17:28] because the Lord is here with the blink
[17:31] of an eye we'll miss him we don't want
[17:32] to miss him this morning all right we
[17:36] put up a wall at the back as for that
[17:38] door that we go in so as we go into that
[17:41] door keep it quiet keep it keep it such
[17:44] that the sanctuary can still continue
[17:46] the musicians I hear the music's playing
[17:48] be respectful to your brother and sister
[17:51] that are in the sanctuary while we go
[17:53] out the back
[17:54] so children I ask you please take the
[17:57] instruction from mom and dad
[17:58] follow those instructions you will be
[18:00] rewarded one day I don't know what what
[18:04] but the Lord knows what he's got in
[18:06] store for you I can't tell you that so
[18:09] please when you don't go out the back
[18:10] please be quiet
[18:11] y'all can talk no one says you don't
[18:13] talk you talk but be such that you're
[18:16] all playing in harmony and no one's
[18:18] raising their voice and everyone's
[18:20] taking care of each other mums and dads
[18:22] when other parents are praying and you
[18:25] have to go out please make sure you keep
[18:27] their children out so the mom and dad

[24:48] this way everyone has 10 minutes to so
[24:52] everyone will be in the sanctuary before
[24:54] the song there even comes to the pulpit
[24:55] so we're all ready for the worship
[24:57] that's that's what we want to do and you
[25:00] know and in that way also you know he's
[25:03] not rushing and half the musicians doing
[25:04] up halfway through the song service and
[25:06] so we're all here and ready and also
[25:09] since since you know the Sunday School
[25:12] teachers they only have 20 minutes and
[25:13] it's that 20 months is not long to to
[25:16] share something the Lord's put in your
[25:17] heart to the to the children so what
[25:20] we're asking is that if you if you turn
[25:22] up late and everyone will turn up late
[25:25] eventually sometime we'll be late one
[25:27] time but if you turn up to church just
[25:29] say 9:30 five-ish can you please not
[25:34] send your children into the sunday
[25:36] school but keep them on the and the
[25:37] seats with you because otherwise what
[25:39] happens is the teacher starts then
[25:41] someone comes and they start they listen
[25:43] again someone else comes and they study
[25:44] this listen again and then they you know
[25:46] either go overtime or they can't get
[25:47] their lesson through so we're wanting to
[25:50] have it this way that the that we help
[25:54] our Sunday School teachers so they can
[25:56] deliver what the Lord's put on their
[25:57] hearts and yes that is that is really
[26:02] all I have with that so we're gonna
[26:04] start so this coming Sunday there's
[26:06] gonna be there's gonna be the first
[26:08] Sunday School class let's start at 9:30
[26:10] and if you're here just say 9:30 five
[26:13] ish just keep your children with you as
[26:15] opposed to seeing them in the class
[26:17] but we're here for it's gonna be a
[26:19] wonderful year I mean brother oh man
[26:21] would you like to come and another man's
[26:23] a sunday-school superintendent and God
[26:26] bless you
[26:27] good morning Saints I just I just want
[26:31] to add to brother Bennett Ghana does
[26:33] push the Sunday school teacher overtime
[26:35] which goes into the service time which
[26:38] just puts everything about out of a
[26:39] cater so we as Sunday school people we
[26:42] have the responsibility to keep our
[26:43] timing so the teachers know about it we
[26:45] we did have the meeting and we all agree
[26:47] not that we don't want the children in
[26:49] the classes it's not absolutely not
[26:51] about it we just don't want to push
[26:53] everyone out and any other day we back
[26:56] in the same routine that's the only
[26:57] right while we have rules things just to
[26:59] keep it all tidy Sunday school starts
[27:03] back on the 3rd of February which is
[27:05] next Sunday we still have the three
[27:09] classes which is the lambs the Lions and
[27:12] the Eagles so the teacher of the Lambs
[27:14] and these three teachers this year would
[27:17] be sister Bronwyn sister Chantel and
[27:20] sister now me I put the names forward
[27:22] for the little class so god bless you
[27:25] thank you for for taking it again then
[27:28] the Lions class would be sister teareth
[27:30] in sister Shannon so you guys will still
[27:34] go fight the sword wield it and do what
[27:37] you do the based and then the INGOs
[27:40] class would be me brother either one
[27:43] brother Andy and sister Christine so are
[27:47] we gonna do that is we're just gonna
[27:48] alternate a bit to to get a female
[27:52] teacher in there as well to help the
[27:53] young ladies as well we've got a lot of
[27:55] young ladies in they so we just pulled
[27:57] sister Christine in and kind of put it
[28:00] to work so thank you sister Christine
[28:01] and brother either one because he he
[28:03] really got a burden for the young ones
[28:05] so you have to use their fire just keep
[28:07] adding it
[28:09] so the Sunday School ages I just want to
[28:11] run over I didn't make a note of it
[28:13] because I didn't want to miss it so the
[28:15] little class which with the lamps is
[28:17] from three years old to six years old or
[28:20] four but four to six right okay four to
[28:24] six and then the Lions the mighty Lions
[28:28] is seven to nine years old
[28:31] and then from 10 to 15 is my class the
[28:36] reason why I say 15 is I'll just throw
[28:39] it out because brother Branham CSD and I
[28:42] made a note of it
[28:43] church order in 63 he said that the the
[28:47] youth class is up from 10 to up to 15 so
[28:52] we've got a couple of members that's
[28:53] that's gone over 15 at 16 years old now
[28:56] now parents I just encourage you to
[28:58] maybe go and talk to your children and
[29:00] ask them if they do want to continue in
[29:02] the sunday school if they don't just let
[29:05] us know then they have to be part of the
[29:07] congregation because they know they know
[29:09] big people you know but if they still
[29:12] want to have another year with us they
[29:14] more than welcome our doors always open
[29:15] so god bless you thank you for that and
[29:19] yeah let's let's look forward to a
[29:22] wonderful year and in also the youth
[29:24] will still be brother Isaac and sister
[29:28] Shannon they all still go on with the
[29:30] youth Knights so I think your God bless

[51:49] I mean if you'd like to take take your
[51:53] Bibles and let's go through the
[51:56] laviticus chapter 16 look at 16 in verse
[52:12] 11 and then we're gonna read to verse 17
[52:16] and when they drop down to verse 29 so
[52:31] Luke is 16 time and if you turn me down
[52:36] a bit okay Leviticus 16 and verse 11
[52:39] we're gonna read down to verse 17 it
[52:41] says here and Aaron shall bring the
[52:44] bullock of the sin offering which is for
[52:46] himself and shall make an atonement for
[52:48] himself and for his house and shall kill
[52:51] the bullock of the sin offering which is
[52:55] for himself and he shall take a sense of
[52:58] full of burning coals of fire from off
[53:00] the altar before the Lord and his hands
[53:02] full of sweet incense beaten small and
[53:05] it shall be bring and bring it within
[53:07] the veil and he shall put the incense
[53:10] upon the fire before the Lord that the
[53:12] cloud of incense may cover the mercy
[53:14] seat which is upon the testimony then he
[53:16] died not and he shall take of the blood
[53:19] of the Bullock and sprinkle it with his
[53:21] finger upon the mercy seat eastward and
[53:23] before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle
[53:25] of the blood with his finger seven times
[53:29] then shall he killed the goat of the sin
[53:32] offering that is for the people and
[53:34] bring his blood within the veil and do
[53:36] with that blood as he did with the blood
[53:38] of the Bullock and sprinkle it upon the
[53:40] mercy seat and before the mercy seat and
[53:42] he shall make an atonement for the holy
[53:44] place because of the uncleanliness of
[53:47] the children
[53:48] and because of the transgressions and
[53:50] all these sins and so shall he do for
[53:53] the tabernacle of the congregation that
[53:55] remaineth among them in the midst of
[53:56] their uncleanness and there shall be no
[53:59] man in the tabernacle of the
[54:00] congregation when he goes in to make an
[54:02] atonement in the holy place until he
[54:04] come out and have made an atonement for
[54:07] himself and for his household and for
[54:09] all the congregation of Israel let's
[54:12] just drop down to verse 29 of the same
[54:14] chapter and sees here and this so feel
[54:21] free please to read the whole chapter
[54:23] but I'm just wanting to take a couple of
[54:25] highlights out of it and this shall be a
[54:27] statute for ever unto you that in the
[54:29] seventh month on the tenth day of the
[54:31] month you shall afflict your souls and
[54:33] do no work at all whether it be be one
[54:36] of your own country or a stranger that
[54:38] sojourneth among you for on that day
[54:41] shall the priests make an atonement for
[54:43] you to cleanse you that you may be clean
[54:45] from all your sins before the Lord it
[54:47] shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you and
[54:50] you shall afflict your souls by a
[54:52] statute forever and the priest whom he
[54:55] shall anoint and whom he shall
[54:57] consecrate to minister and the priests
[54:59] office and his father stead shall make
[55:02] the atonement and shall put on the linen
[55:04] clothes even the holy garments and he
[55:06] shall make an atonement for the holy
[55:08] sanctuary and he shall make an atonement
[55:10] for the tabernacle of the congregation
[55:11] and for the altar and he shall make an
[55:14] atonement for the priests and for all
[55:16] the children all the people of the
[55:18] congregation and this shall be an
[55:20] everlasting statute for you to make an
[55:22] atonement for the children of Israel for
[55:24] all their sins once a year he did and he
[55:27] did as the LORD commanded Moses I mean
[55:31] unless just let's just read just one
[55:33] more portion of Scripture sorry to keep
[55:35] me standing but let's go to Leviticus
[55:37] chapter 25 and we're gonna go to verse
[55:42] verse 8 of Leviticus 25 I'm going to
[55:45] read down to verse 13 and thou shalt
[55:49] number seven Sabbath's of years unto
[55:51] thee seven times seven years in the
[55:54] space of the seven Sabbath's of years
[55:56] shall be unto thee forty in nine years
[55:58] then thou shalt cause the trumpet of the
[56:00] Jubilee to sound
[56:02] on the tenth day of the seventh month in
[56:04] the Day of Atonement show you make the
[56:06] trumpet sound throughout all your land
[56:08] and you shall hallow the fiftieth year
[56:10] and proclaim Liberty throughout all the
[56:13] land unto all the inhabitants thereof
[56:15] and it shall be a jubilee unto you and
[56:17] you shall return every man under his
[56:20] position and you shall return every man
[56:22] unto his family a jubilee shall that
[56:26] fiftieth year be unto you you shall not
[56:28] shall not so neither reap that which has
[56:31] grown of itself in it nor gather the
[56:34] grapes in it of the vine and rest for it
[56:37] as the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you
[56:40] you shall eat the increase there of out
[56:41] of the field and the year of this
[56:43] Jubilee you shall return every man to
[56:47] his position I mean let's bow our heads
[56:50] for a word of Prayer
[56:51] gracious Heavenly Father we want to
[56:53] thank you Lord even for the ability to
[56:55] read your word Lord we just and we want
[56:58] to thank you Father for the faith Lord
[57:00] to believe your word and dear Lord as we
[57:02] have gathered father to worship you I
[57:04] just pray father that now you would take
[57:06] the service under your divine control
[57:08] father may you direct Lord the word
[57:11] father you Lord you open the mouth of a
[57:13] donkey to speak one day and so Lord you
[57:16] can open a closed mouth Lord closed
[57:17] mouth so I asked Lord you just opened my
[57:19] mouth that would be you your word only
[57:21] father and Lord may it find prepared
[57:24] soil of it Lord in every heart that
[57:26] brings forth one hundredfold and lord I
[57:28] pray that you just have preeminence in
[57:29] the service Lord may you anoint each one
[57:31] here and we want to thank you Father for
[57:33] this opportunity to be gathered in your
[57:35] presence Lord and we ask father for
[57:37] those Lord who are not here today Lord
[57:39] may be the apportion father in Jesus
[57:41] Christ's name Amen amen god bless your
[57:44] you may have your seats this morning so
[57:46] I want to continue on on on my thought
[57:49] of breaking the cycle of the ages and I
[57:52] and I want to speak about the work of
[57:53] the high priest
[57:54] so last last Wednesday just to a very
[57:57] quick refresh you know I spoke on the
[57:59] power of the blood and how in this day
[58:01] the bride has been restored back to the
[58:03] original faith of the Apostles by the
[58:05] ministry of Malachi 4 and that ministry
[58:08] the purpose of it they would turn the
[58:10] hearts of the children back to their
[58:11] faith of the father's I mean so so so
[58:14] the the people in this
[58:16] they their faith would be turned from
[58:18] the Creed's and dogmas of man back to a
[58:20] pure Bible faith where Jesus Christ the
[58:23] word is worshiped and not man's ideas
[58:25] amen and we understand that this is not
[58:28] just receiving correct doctrine but it
[58:30] causes the believer to be transformed by
[58:32] the life that was in the blood of Jesus
[58:34] Christ which is the Holy Ghost I mean
[58:36] that that life would come upon you and
[58:38] would live in you mM would cause us to
[58:41] be quickened by the Word of God that the
[58:43] Word of God lives through you right
[58:45] hallelujah so now just as and and
[58:48] brother Brown speaks about this in the
[58:50] feast of the trumpets he says now I mean
[58:51] I mean this is my words paraphrasing me
[58:53] says just as the two witnesses of
[58:55] revelations eleven will turn the 144,000
[58:59] Jews from the traditions that they have
[59:00] in thee and the dog one and chickens and
[59:02] different rituals to receiving the true
[59:05] atonement which was killed 2,000 years
[59:06] ago
[59:07] so the Gentile bride has been restored
[59:10] to the true atonement and this
[59:12] restoration will be capped off with the
[59:14] rapture of the resurrected Saints and
[59:16] those which are alive and remain to meet
[59:18] the Lord in the air
[59:19] Alleluia and then now in this this.h the
[59:22] power of the Cross is fully manifested
[59:25] this ages when the power of the Cross is
[59:27] fully manifested and this will be shown
[59:29] by living people being translated from
[59:32] this world into heaven right because the
[59:34] the purpose of Calvary wouldn't just be
[59:37] that we would be forgiven but the full
[59:39] purpose of Calvary would be a people
[59:41] would be cleansed of their sin this in
[59:43] nature would be purged out receive God's
[59:45] divine nature that be made in the image
[59:47] of his word and it would ultimately come
[59:49] like finish off cap off with a
[59:51] translation of the living Saints I mean
[59:54] because the fullness of adoption is the
[59:55] change of the body right so now we're
[59:58] living in an age because every former
[59:59] age if one that died in faith you know
[1:00:02] they believed that they would be that
[1:00:03] group as the Apostle Paul would write to
[1:00:05] the Thessalonians we which are alive and
[1:00:07] remain amen and speaking about the
[1:00:10] rapture cycle and no doubt when they
[1:00:12] receive that letter they thought we are
[1:00:13] there those that are alive and remaining
[1:00:15] I mean but it wasn't for them it was
[1:00:17] actually prophecy for us in this hour
[1:00:20] right but they died in Christ and they
[1:00:22] will come forth like will come forth
[1:00:24] right so every true believer from
[1:00:26] Calvary down to now they'll come forth
[1:00:28] jurors we will be changed
[1:00:30] hallelujah but now there has through you
[1:00:32] know there has to come when the fullness
[1:00:33] of Calvary is manifested in a people and
[1:00:36] this was demonstrated in the ministry of
[1:00:38] brother brand by the power of the spoken
[1:00:40] word where where storms were spoken out
[1:00:42] of existence life was created yoke
[1:00:45] answers was spoken oh yeah yeah you know
[1:00:47] we're we're of course it disappear the
[1:00:49] power of God's love was predicted people
[1:00:51] were delivered I mean there was that
[1:00:53] your power of the spoken word was
[1:00:55] manifested because God wanted to show us
[1:00:57] this is what the cross really does Amen
[1:01:00] so now so so the fullness of the power
[1:01:02] of Calvary is here right but we've got
[1:01:04] to understand as we read that the high
[1:01:06] priest had to take the blood into into
[1:01:09] the holiest of Holies and he sprinkled
[1:01:11] the blood seven times speaking the same
[1:01:13] blood was given but it was shared it was
[1:01:15] given for the believers down seven
[1:01:17] Church ages right so now the blood is
[1:01:19] extremely powerful we know that there's
[1:01:21] power in the blood to cleanse any Center
[1:01:23] I'm fully convinced there's a power in
[1:01:25] this room that not there is nothing upon
[1:01:28] the earth that cannot be healed there's
[1:01:29] nothing that cannot be restored there's
[1:01:31] no complex to great there's no hurt to
[1:01:34] deep there's no wound to Grievous I mean
[1:01:36] that that God cannot heal cannot mend
[1:01:39] and not just patch up and get rid of I
[1:01:41] am fully convinced about that there is
[1:01:44] nothing that cannot be conquered there's
[1:01:46] nothing that cannot be cleansed there's
[1:01:47] nothing at all that you can imagine or
[1:01:50] speak of I mean it God cannot fix
[1:01:52] hallelujah so now the blood is
[1:01:54] incredibly powerful I mean but we need a
[1:01:58] high priest to administer the blood
[1:02:00] right so it didn't matter if we go back
[1:02:03] into the Old Testament it didn't matter
[1:02:05] how perfect the sacrifice was you could
[1:02:07] examine the lamb it can be a perfect
[1:02:09] lamb it can be you know its grandparent
[1:02:11] great-great grandpa give a perfect
[1:02:13] perfect Lambs all the way down but
[1:02:15] without the high priest to take the
[1:02:17] blood into the Holy of Holies that was
[1:02:19] all in vain there had to be a man that
[1:02:22] was dressed a man that was anointed a
[1:02:25] man that was commissioned into the job a
[1:02:27] man that could take the blood into the
[1:02:30] Holy of Holies on behalf of the people
[1:02:32] but if yeah if we're Israelites I
[1:02:34] couldn't go in there I would die you
[1:02:37] couldn't go in there if you're not the
[1:02:39] high priest you can't go in
[1:02:40] doesn't matter house and say you were
[1:02:42] had
[1:02:43] not you were how right you were you know
[1:02:45] you could live the law to the leader and
[1:02:47] be very devout but if you were the high
[1:02:50] priest you could not take the blood on
[1:02:52] your behalf and you needed a man to be
[1:02:54] there I'm in a man to be that would take
[1:02:57] the blood in that your sins would be
[1:02:59] forgiven
[1:03:00] hallelujah this is incredibly important
[1:03:03] and I just trust if you don't get
[1:03:04] anything out of the service you'll
[1:03:06] appreciate the work of our high priest
[1:03:08] partly because at the end of the at the
[1:03:11] end of the day if we are translated from
[1:03:14] this world to the next world our
[1:03:16] testimony will my testimony will be he
[1:03:18] did it for me he did it I'm just here
[1:03:20] because I'm a beneficiary of his
[1:03:22] resurrection I'm a beneficiary of his
[1:03:24] grace it's his work he just said I'm
[1:03:26] going to be there if I'm and a piece or
[1:03:29] day me to be there I'm gonna be there
[1:03:30] and you say what about your free will I
[1:03:32] say give you a free will over to him and
[1:03:34] press into the kingdom I mean how do you
[1:03:36] know you've been redeemed you no longer
[1:03:38] once your own will you want his will
[1:03:41] that's how you know you're being
[1:03:42] redeemed so it's no longer what you want
[1:03:44] in your ambitions it's his ambition is
[1:03:46] what he wants
[1:03:48] hallelujah so I trust you can look at
[1:03:50] your life you say well I want to do my
[1:03:51] own thing you need to be redeemed I mean
[1:03:54] while this pressure and things of life
[1:03:56] not just give your life over to him give
[1:03:58] you a will over to him and he'll take
[1:04:00] care of you doesn't matter what pressure
[1:04:02] comes on
[1:04:03] I mean I'm fully persuaded I mean that
[1:04:06] this that the enemy will not defeat thus
[1:04:08] pride right that the enemy cannot defeat
[1:04:11] her
[1:04:11] we will walk out of this world not
[1:04:14] survivors not victims
[1:04:16] we will walk out as overcomers in this
[1:04:18] age by the power of the lamb by the
[1:04:20] power of the blood hallelujah so every
[1:04:24] true believer is not trusting in their
[1:04:26] own ability right but they are trusting
[1:04:29] in God given ability I mean every true
[1:04:32] believer is trusting in the blood of
[1:04:33] Jesus Christ alone
[1:04:35] amen and they see so they but they don't
[1:04:37] only talk about the blood right but they
[1:04:40] see his transforming power changing them
[1:04:43] into his word that's how you know that
[1:04:45] the Bloods been applied to you is that
[1:04:47] you are going from glory to glory right
[1:04:50] you're becoming more like his word every
[1:04:52] day now the Apostle Paul would speak in
[1:04:55] second Corinthians three said but there
[1:04:57] mine's will blind and speaking of Israel
[1:04:58] unto this day remain if the same veil
[1:05:01] and taken away in the reading in the Old
[1:05:03] Testament which Vail has done away in
[1:05:05] Christ but even unto this day when Moses
[1:05:08] is read the Vail is upon their heart now
[1:05:11] I'll say this it's not just the Jews
[1:05:13] that are veils upon the heart I mean
[1:05:15] we're all bored with that kind of
[1:05:16] unbelief Vail hallelujah
[1:05:19] but now nevertheless when it shall turn
[1:05:21] to the Lord that Vail shall be taken
[1:05:23] away now the Lord is that spirit and
[1:05:26] where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:05:28] Liberty and we know if you look into
[1:05:31] that desperate no that just doesn't mean
[1:05:32] you do whatever you want but you're no
[1:05:34] longer a slave you become a son you know
[1:05:36] a slave to the devil anymore you've been
[1:05:38] liberated by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:05:40] and now you're a son or daughter of God
[1:05:42] I mean but we all with an open face
[1:05:46] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:05:48] Lord I changed into the same image from
[1:05:51] glory to glory even as by the Spirit of
[1:05:54] the Lord so now you know that you know
[1:05:57] that the veil has been taken away from
[1:05:59] your heart amen when your eyes come open
[1:06:02] right and you know when your eyes come
[1:06:04] open I mean when you see that God is not
[1:06:07] a God of history he's not a God of
[1:06:09] tradition he's not someone else's
[1:06:11] testimony but he's your testimony I mean
[1:06:14] he becomes alive and real to you
[1:06:16] that's that's when you know your eyes
[1:06:17] are beginning to come open hallelujah
[1:06:20] because there has - God has to open our
[1:06:22] eyes take the veil out of the way that
[1:06:24] we believe that he is and he is a
[1:06:27] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:06:29] him right so so there has to come a time
[1:06:31] where it's not well he was anyone can
[1:06:33] say he was but you gotta believe that he
[1:06:35] is he's the present God and he's a
[1:06:37] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:06:39] Him hallelujah so now so so that's how
[1:06:43] you know the veils been taken because
[1:06:44] people say well how do I know I don't
[1:06:46] understand all things I don't understand
[1:06:48] all things either you got to walk with
[1:06:50] him as you walk with him he opens his
[1:06:52] word to you he becomes more real he
[1:06:54] becomes more alive right but but a good
[1:06:57] way to see is that you're not clouded
[1:06:58] over but you see he's there with you now
[1:07:01] hallelujah now so and and also I'll just
[1:07:05] say this down if the veil has been taken
[1:07:08] away and if we're beholding His image
[1:07:10] we're beholding his word it changes us
[1:07:13] from glory to glory should we not be
[1:07:15] looking at His Word
[1:07:16] right should we not be should we not be
[1:07:19] listening to the message so will not be
[1:07:21] prayerfully listening and reading right
[1:07:23] if we believe who believes this is God
[1:07:26] and printful and if the veil of
[1:07:28] traditions being taken out of your heart
[1:07:30] and you see him in this day I mean then
[1:07:32] reading this prayerfully Amen you are
[1:07:35] changed into the image of the word
[1:07:37] hallelujah since your I was thinking
[1:07:40] your last year you know we had that
[1:07:42] service after camp I said youth right
[1:07:43] the pantry of God's Word I mean wine you
[1:07:47] get in there right in the food food
[1:07:48] pantry you know y'all seen your mom
[1:07:51] doesn't want you writing the pantry but
[1:07:53] she'll be happy if you write God's Word
[1:07:55] I mean get in there and get out the get
[1:07:57] out the courts and the and the and the
[1:07:59] scriptures and begin to cook something I
[1:08:02] meant because you got to believe now as
[1:08:04] you're listening to it and as you're
[1:08:06] reading it is transforming you into his
[1:08:08] image there's a purpose it's not just to
[1:08:10] fill you hid with religion but as that
[1:08:12] God would make you into his image
[1:08:14] hallelujah so I mean are you right the
[1:08:17] pantry raid the pantry you know it
[1:08:20] shouldn't be in all just I just put it
[1:08:22] on your lap it should be when you go
[1:08:23] into the senior sunday-school it should
[1:08:25] be our mind actually sits in the corner
[1:08:27] and listens because you're giving the
[1:08:29] listen I trust you don't mind me saying
[1:08:31] it I mean because you know if you've had
[1:08:33] a wonderful face do you tell people
[1:08:35] about it
[1:08:36] would you say you know you just keep no
[1:08:38] you so I had this I went here is was
[1:08:40] wonderful
[1:08:40] and you just rejoice you tell people
[1:08:42] about it amen because you're full of
[1:08:44] something it's going to come out right
[1:08:46] so if you fill yourself with the word it
[1:08:48] has to come out you can't help it
[1:08:50] hallelujah so that's how it should be a
[1:08:52] meaning but then also you've got to take
[1:08:55] your place in the body I mean I saw all
[1:08:57] of you standing saying hallelujah Amen
[1:08:59] why I said take your place
[1:09:01] well now the devil one doesn't want you
[1:09:02] to take your place he's gonna fight you
[1:09:04] you're gonna fight them back as brother
[1:09:07] pretty soon you're gonna put your finger
[1:09:09] in his face and say get out of here even
[1:09:11] every bluffers Bluffs you it the same
[1:09:13] way you would have tell the devil to get
[1:09:14] lost
[1:09:15] I mean kick the devil off your Mountain
[1:09:16] kick them off your mountain take them up
[1:09:18] your position hallelujah so we should be
[1:09:22] you should be there's untapped resources
[1:09:25] well the ramp says it's untapped
[1:09:27] resources and God untapped that means
[1:09:30] it's never been seen it's never been
[1:09:32] delved into it's never been probed into
[1:09:35] you say well I trust there's some
[1:09:37] prospectors in here I mean you say well
[1:09:40] I've heard it before I read it before
[1:09:41] hear it again read it again you'll find
[1:09:44] things that you never did that you just
[1:09:46] glossed over hallelujah I dare you I
[1:09:49] double dare you
[1:09:52] hallelujah tap into it I don't want to
[1:09:55] be a living Facebook you know you are
[1:09:58] what you eat
[1:09:59] yeah you will become what you behold
[1:10:01] whether you like it or not you may think
[1:10:04] it's ridiculous to begin with but if you
[1:10:06] keep beholding the thing that's what
[1:10:07] you'll become right so what do you want
[1:10:09] to become because if you want to become
[1:10:12] this world this world has an expiry date
[1:10:14] it has no reward for you all it has is
[1:10:16] brokenness amen emptiness sadness that's
[1:10:20] all this world has that's all Hollywood
[1:10:22] has you know they pump out these music
[1:10:24] videos and all these different things
[1:10:25] and it's just people are living in a
[1:10:27] fantasy world and that's the reason they
[1:10:29] try and stay in the fantasy world
[1:10:30] because when they come into the real
[1:10:32] they're unhappy well but we're not
[1:10:34] called to live in a fantasy world being
[1:10:36] a Christian is not a fantasy world it's
[1:10:39] a reality because God is a God of
[1:10:41] reality hallelujah so we're not living
[1:10:43] in a fantasy world people are trying to
[1:10:45] become something and you know I saw this
[1:10:48] thing and I find the link but in Japan
[1:10:51] there's a term but is what happens is
[1:10:53] there's like a million they they think
[1:10:55] it's a million youth young men 16 to
[1:10:58] about 32 and they withdraw from society
[1:11:00] and they basically live in their rooms
[1:11:03] staying with their parents and they
[1:11:04] don't come out because they've if
[1:11:08] something's happened to them maybe
[1:11:10] they'd be made fun of at school or
[1:11:11] something and they withdraw and they
[1:11:14] stop going to school they stop working
[1:11:15] they stop going to university with
[1:11:17] whatever they're doing they just live in
[1:11:19] their rooms and they live off media
[1:11:23] there's like a million of them this is
[1:11:26] this is true I'll get the link it off
[1:11:29] did you show clip on BBC and I was
[1:11:32] amazed and the reason they do that is
[1:11:34] because apparently Japanese culture they
[1:11:36] see it as Japanese culture doesn't help
[1:11:38] the week you got to be strong and if
[1:11:42] you're not strong you nothing so these
[1:11:44] ones have been wounded they've been hurt
[1:11:45] you know one one of them so so what they
[1:11:49] also have is they have these people and
[1:11:51] they're called rental sisters and
[1:11:52] they're and there's this organization
[1:11:54] where these with these women get paid by
[1:11:57] the parents to be like the sister and
[1:11:58] they try and coax the young man out
[1:12:00] develop a friendship try and get him out
[1:12:02] and try and basically rehabilitate him I
[1:12:05] mean he have been rehabilitated they get
[1:12:07] jobs that become normal people once
[1:12:08] again but because of a wounding because
[1:12:11] of like one guy he said his voice was
[1:12:13] too high who's made fun of at school and
[1:12:15] he ended up like this for a couple of
[1:12:16] years now what you know why are you
[1:12:21] saying these things
[1:12:21] we're not here to withdraw and live in a
[1:12:24] fantasy world because I'm sure you could
[1:12:26] agree that is not reality that is living
[1:12:29] living through a screen as a fantasy
[1:12:31] world right be cut but because they
[1:12:33] can't cope with the pressure of normal
[1:12:35] life they become that way because that
[1:12:37] becomes their coping mechanism right but
[1:12:40] our coping mechanism is not to earth
[1:12:42] draw and become like that you say well
[1:12:44] that's in Japan no that's in New Zealand
[1:12:46] that's not just here that's here it may
[1:12:49] manifest differently but people become
[1:12:51] this I can't member what the Japanese
[1:12:52] word for us but they become like that
[1:12:54] we're not called to become like that
[1:12:56] friends we're caught to live in reality
[1:12:58] and our Lord Jesus is our coping
[1:13:01] mechanism right if you can't handle life
[1:13:03] people get strung out on drugs as I
[1:13:05] can't handle life or music or movies
[1:13:07] whatever more that becomes their
[1:13:08] addiction I say let God become your
[1:13:10] addiction let him become your coping
[1:13:12] mechanism is that I can't handle life I
[1:13:15] mean drink drink of excess of this get
[1:13:18] drunk on the Spirit of God hallelujah
[1:13:21] say well does that really happen I've
[1:13:23] experienced it I know what it's like to
[1:13:25] be drunk in the world I know what it's
[1:13:27] like to be drunk in the spirit and that
[1:13:29] is just a perversion of being drunk on
[1:13:31] the Spirit of God hallelujah amen
[1:13:34] there's a there's a young brother
[1:13:35] brother Michael Maloney who's at camp
[1:13:37] and because I shared the testimony and
[1:13:39] after the prayer line there on the last
[1:13:42] service whenever
[1:13:42] that was Sunday night or whatever it was
[1:13:44] he was for 20 minutes staggering around
[1:13:46] and he said to me afterwards he said I
[1:13:49] never knew what you mean but now I
[1:13:50] understand hallelujah because the Spirit
[1:13:53] of God struck him and he was like a
[1:13:55] drunk man hallelujah he said does that
[1:13:58] still happen absolutely it still happens
[1:14:00] I mean brother Brown says you can be
[1:14:02] drunk on the Spirit of God every day of
[1:14:05] your life until you leave this world
[1:14:07] hallelujah glory I'm glad that day hey
[1:14:10] just pass the bottle you know that's
[1:14:13] right that's why you raid the pantry
[1:14:14] right pass it around
[1:14:17] amen have you ever seen someone
[1:14:19] disappointed at a masterpiece of a meal
[1:14:21] no they get happy about it
[1:14:24] amen so you know hallelujah
[1:14:30] amen
[1:14:31] now so we are so we must believe that he
[1:14:35] is but now the problem is I'd say in
[1:14:39] this age is that brother brand will
[1:14:40] preach a sermon called spiritual amnesia
[1:14:42] in 1964 if you want to listen to a
[1:14:45] message go listen to that message his
[1:14:48] homework children will think of the
[1:14:50] tensions later if you don't do it but
[1:14:52] God listen to spiritual amnesia it'll do
[1:14:54] you good it'll do you good and he says
[1:14:57] you know he begins this brother BAM
[1:15:01] begins to speak about how the world the
[1:15:03] Christian world has got amnesia they've
[1:15:05] forgotten who they really are
[1:15:06] and and one way that you can get amnesia
[1:15:09] is be between two opinions as the word
[1:15:12] as the word right or is the world right
[1:15:14] and you and then you get between two
[1:15:17] opinions and then you begin forget who
[1:15:19] you are we're not cause to forget who we
[1:15:22] are this message once God wants you to
[1:15:24] know who you are not to forget who you
[1:15:26] are but then you would know who you are
[1:15:28] right who you are in him so brother BAM
[1:15:30] begins to speak it I just say season
[1:15:32] Jesus seed you of your father the devil
[1:15:33] and his work she'll do
[1:15:35] did you know Cain offered a good
[1:15:36] sacrifice to he is sincere built an
[1:15:38] altar knelt down and worshipped offered
[1:15:40] a sacrifice and prayed to garden of God
[1:15:42] that's all God requires for you to
[1:15:44] belong to church and have an altar and
[1:15:46] pay your tithes and go to church and
[1:15:47] live a good life if that's all he
[1:15:49] requires
[1:15:50] he was unjust to condemn Cain because he
[1:15:52] did the same thing yes sir it's exactly
[1:15:54] right but religion means a covering
[1:15:56] and you can't be covered by your own
[1:15:58] good works there's only one thing that
[1:16:00] God will accept and that's the blood of
[1:16:01] Jesus Christ that's the only covering
[1:16:04] outside of that if you say well I keep a
[1:16:06] Creed that's spiritual amnesia that's
[1:16:08] what happens now notice they forgot
[1:16:11] their word they forgot the Bible they
[1:16:14] they have forgot the promise they're
[1:16:17] trying to live in the glare of what the
[1:16:19] Methodist was what the Baptist was what
[1:16:21] somebody else was that's the promise of
[1:16:23] the day and God speaking it through his
[1:16:25] word and confirming it again and proving
[1:16:27] that it's so and they still don't
[1:16:29] believe it that spiritual amnesia it's
[1:16:31] exactly right total amnesia absolutely
[1:16:33] don't believe it at all he's a French
[1:16:35] soldier I was told a little story he
[1:16:37] says about a French soldier there's a
[1:16:39] bunch of soldiers from in the army
[1:16:41] and they had this amnesia cuz of shock
[1:16:44] on shock on battle so they were
[1:16:46] shell-shocked and they forgot who they
[1:16:49] were because the bombardment of the
[1:16:51] enemy was too great sometimes we can be
[1:16:53] bombarded right this is not a picnic we
[1:16:56] understand that with this is not a
[1:16:58] picnic beau Graham says you have one
[1:17:00] yeah you have one weak spot do you got
[1:17:02] to keep it covered and the devil is the
[1:17:04] write to that one punch hears that and
[1:17:07] and brother says you got to keep that
[1:17:09] spot covered hallelujah so now because
[1:17:13] we not have been we are built the same
[1:17:15] way as the people in the world the only
[1:17:18] difference is we have a seat of
[1:17:19] predestination in our soul right that
[1:17:22] that God quickens byers word it comes to
[1:17:24] life but we have the same spiritual
[1:17:25] realm right we have the same physical
[1:17:28] realm right the only difference is we
[1:17:30] have a soldier on the battlefield called
[1:17:32] faith in God's Word hallelujah we have
[1:17:34] the Living God on the battlefield but
[1:17:36] never will still come in he's not a
[1:17:38] gentleman right he's he's very
[1:17:41] aggressive and he's free you know he's
[1:17:43] very blatant he doesn't care what God is
[1:17:45] doing he'll still step in and just try
[1:17:47] and Rob hallelujah
[1:17:49] so now that's why we got to kick him off
[1:17:52] our mountain and so now these soldiers
[1:17:54] because of because of shell shock I mean
[1:17:57] they forgot who they were and they
[1:17:58] couldn't you know and and and the
[1:18:01] doctors and things they couldn't awaken
[1:18:03] him to realize who they were worse
[1:18:04] they're going to ascend into a
[1:18:05] sanitarium and they were they were on a
[1:18:08] train and the train stopped and
[1:18:10] one of the soldiers got out and he began
[1:18:12] to start walking and the guards just
[1:18:14] said hold on we'll just follow him and
[1:18:16] he walked he came and he looked at
[1:18:18] something and then he walked over here
[1:18:21] and he and he saw you know and
[1:18:22] eventually he came to a path and he came
[1:18:25] to a house and on that house was the old
[1:18:28] man the old man came running down
[1:18:30] embraced him and said I knew you'd come
[1:18:33] home son
[1:18:34] and as soon as the father embraced him
[1:18:36] his amnesia Brooke probably realized who
[1:18:39] his father was hallelujah
[1:18:41] and it's the same thing now if you
[1:18:43] that's why I say raid God's pantry
[1:18:44] because you may find yourself in the
[1:18:47] word but you may find yourself going
[1:18:49] down through familiar places like the
[1:18:51] soldier with amnesia he says I think I
[1:18:53] recognize this but I don't know Walker I
[1:18:55] think I recognize this but that house
[1:18:57] looks familiar
[1:18:57] I'll go have a closer look and then his
[1:18:59] father comes out white sir if you if you
[1:19:02] get into God's Word you may find
[1:19:04] yourself identified there as a believer
[1:19:07] right because that's what this Isaiah
[1:19:10] it's what you feed on is what you'll
[1:19:12] become amen brother I said and the boy
[1:19:15] he said he looked coming out of a porch
[1:19:17] was an old man with a cane and his head
[1:19:19] came out throw his arms around and said
[1:19:21] my son I know you would return they told
[1:19:23] me you were dead but I know you would
[1:19:24] return and the boy came to himself his
[1:19:27] amnesia left them he could identify who
[1:19:29] he was he knowed that was his father Oh
[1:19:31] soldier of the Cross has been shocked so
[1:19:33] me was so much trading so many shocks of
[1:19:36] denomination and creed and things of the
[1:19:38] world why don't you just step off for a
[1:19:40] few minutes and look around at the Bible
[1:19:42] might wander around and you and you
[1:19:45] might find yourself identified here in
[1:19:47] the word as a believer hallelujah and
[1:19:51] that's what we want to do you want to
[1:19:52] find ourselves in the scripture because
[1:19:54] Facebook ain't going to help you
[1:19:56] Pinterest ain't gonna help you Instagram
[1:19:58] ain't going to help you you know social
[1:20:00] media and depression is linked you know
[1:20:03] that's been proven that people who feed
[1:20:05] themselves on social media become
[1:20:07] depressed why is that because a false
[1:20:09] image isn't put in front of people and
[1:20:11] they know subconsciously they cannot it
[1:20:13] never obtain to that all the photo all
[1:20:16] the professional photos are staged it's
[1:20:18] not just hey take a pic this is cool
[1:20:20] it's all staged and there's a lot of
[1:20:22] thought goes into it
[1:20:24] and and and and they're trying to make
[1:20:26] this you know make this false impression
[1:20:27] this is how my life is but they don't
[1:20:30] show you the three hours to actually
[1:20:31] staged the photo right but then people
[1:20:34] just take it as truth and they become
[1:20:36] depressed because they can't obtain to
[1:20:37] it so this only has made me happy you're
[1:20:44] saying that makes you happy
[1:20:45] read this listen to the message you'll
[1:20:46] make you happy hallelujah it's not
[1:20:49] linked with depression hallelujah let's
[1:20:52] beat hates being proven you see the yo
[1:20:55] you're the Apostles weren't there
[1:20:57] Pentecost there Pentecost fully come God
[1:20:59] came and dwelt in them will they
[1:21:00] depressed no they are very happy they
[1:21:03] sterilized wrong people
[1:21:04] hallelujah they're rejoicing amen so
[1:21:08] it's not linked with depression now so
[1:21:11] in the Old Testament we see that the the
[1:21:13] the office of the high priest was vital
[1:21:16] I mean because he had to be the one you
[1:21:19] know so the forgiveness of the sins of
[1:21:20] Israel really hang on that one man okay
[1:21:24] on him only that was the high priest
[1:21:27] Israel could have the perfect sacrifice
[1:21:29] but without the high priest offer the
[1:21:30] sacrifice of wouldn't do any good it was
[1:21:33] the high priest that took the blood and
[1:21:35] once here to sprinkle upon the mercy
[1:21:36] seat for the sins of the people now we
[1:21:39] read those two scriptures there in
[1:21:41] Leviticus 16 and then also Leviticus 25
[1:21:44] because on the day of atonement that we
[1:21:47] read about two things happened one was
[1:21:50] the high priest winning with the blood
[1:21:52] and and and the PTO on behalf of the
[1:21:56] people that their sins would be forgiven
[1:21:58] and number two was when the on the
[1:22:01] fiftieth after the seven Sabbath's on
[1:22:03] the fiftieth year right on the day of
[1:22:07] atonement the trumpet sound was of the
[1:22:10] Jubilee were sent out through the land
[1:22:12] so there was a cycle of Sabbath's but
[1:22:16] there came a point where that cycle was
[1:22:18] broken that everyone could return to
[1:22:21] their position because of the high
[1:22:24] priest going in with the blood that was
[1:22:26] linked with the jubilee trumpet sounding
[1:22:28] hallelujah and now we are living in a
[1:22:31] date now our lord jesus is our high
[1:22:33] priest go read the book of hebrews he is
[1:22:35] our high priest right we don't have a
[1:22:37] high priest year after the order of
[1:22:39] Aaron just a natural man but God became
[1:22:41] our high priest God became flesh
[1:22:43] hallelujah and the high priest and the
[1:22:46] Old Testament took the blood of an
[1:22:48] animal but our high priest took his own
[1:22:50] blood I mean within the Holy of Holies
[1:22:52] our high priest offered himself as a
[1:22:54] sacrifice I mean on our behalf and so
[1:22:58] now these two things are tied together
[1:23:00] where for 49 years there was a cycle of
[1:23:03] Sabbath's where people could be so young
[1:23:05] people were in slavery people had to you
[1:23:08] know sometimes sold themselves into
[1:23:09] bondage because of circumstances of life
[1:23:11] but there came a time when that cycle
[1:23:14] was broken and you see this through the
[1:23:16] law there's a there's a theme in the law
[1:23:17] where there comes a time of an end right
[1:23:19] where a cycle will will be there but it
[1:23:22] always comes to an end because God is
[1:23:23] showing us now that there will be an end
[1:23:25] of the breath there will be a breaking
[1:23:27] of the cycle of the ages wear timers no
[1:23:29] more sinners no more but it's just
[1:23:31] eternity rolling on hallelujah so now
[1:23:34] here we have here we have on this on
[1:23:37] this Jubilee year this this after the
[1:23:40] seventh year of the seventh Sabbath is
[1:23:41] that there be a day of atonement and the
[1:23:43] trumpet would sound and the purpose of
[1:23:46] that trumpet sounding is that every man
[1:23:48] would return to his possession so what
[1:23:51] he rightfully had in the beginning he
[1:23:52] would be restored right and it wasn't
[1:23:55] the man doing it but it was in though it
[1:23:57] was in the law and it had to be enforced
[1:24:00] that if a person wanted to go free on
[1:24:02] that Jubilee year they could go free
[1:24:04] right because the trouble was sounded
[1:24:06] the blood was given and it had to come
[1:24:08] into effect right if the people wanted
[1:24:11] it but if you didn't want to you know
[1:24:12] you're the law also says that if people
[1:24:15] didn't want to go free
[1:24:16] they'd go to thee you know the door of
[1:24:18] the temple amen and the priest would
[1:24:20] bore them in the air and they could
[1:24:22] never go free they belonged to their
[1:24:23] master forever but they had a choice I
[1:24:25] mean would they go free and that's why
[1:24:27] the devil he loves to try and make the
[1:24:29] world seem appealing stay with me
[1:24:31] everything will be fine and he's got a
[1:24:33] knife he's looking to stick it in you
[1:24:35] but you know it's not really that bad
[1:24:37] you having fun
[1:24:39] you're enjoying this right but because
[1:24:41] the devil doesn't want you to leave and
[1:24:43] he doesn't want you to return to your
[1:24:45] rightful position which is your position
[1:24:47] in Christ hallelujah
[1:24:51] this is the time so I'm announcing to
[1:24:53] you and I trust that you you you already
[1:24:55] see where I'm going but we're living in
[1:24:57] that time we've had seven church ages
[1:24:59] seven seven sabbaths you can say but now
[1:25:03] we've come to a time where there's time
[1:25:05] for the church a cycle of revival and
[1:25:08] death to be broken right that there
[1:25:10] would have come to an end of the church
[1:25:11] ages that God would wind up as plan with
[1:25:14] the Gentiles he would call out a bride
[1:25:15] she would return to her rightful
[1:25:17] possession in Christ amen she would go
[1:25:20] free and she would be restored
[1:25:22] Paul ouya and then the rapture will come
[1:25:24] amen so now this is where we're living
[1:25:26] so you know if we if we go to Hebrews
[1:25:31] let's go to Hebrews 10 let's just read a
[1:25:32] little bit more if you don't buy
[1:25:33] hallelujah I'm glad you know you say
[1:25:38] well you're putting all emphasis on the
[1:25:40] work of the Lord Jesus absolutely I mean
[1:25:43] because of it's not you know he he is
[1:25:45] the one who does the work right we are
[1:25:48] not our own we're bought with a price I
[1:25:50] mean we are saved by grace through faith
[1:25:52] it's a gift of God don't let these
[1:25:54] things become some some something
[1:25:56] without any power and of this absolute
[1:25:58] power in those kind of statements I mean
[1:26:00] where we see that it's not we are his
[1:26:02] workmanship hallelujah and we're
[1:26:04] depending on the work of our high priest
[1:26:07] hallelujah so Hebrews 10 and 1 we're
[1:26:10] just going to read it but here he says
[1:26:11] for the law having a shadow of good
[1:26:13] things to come and not the very image of
[1:26:16] the things can never with those
[1:26:17] sacrifices which they offered year by
[1:26:19] year continually make the comers
[1:26:21] thereunto perfect for then would they
[1:26:24] not have ceased to be offered because
[1:26:26] that the worshiper once purged should
[1:26:28] have no more conscious of sins but in
[1:26:31] those sacrifices there is a remembrance
[1:26:32] again made of sins every year for us not
[1:26:35] possible that the blood of bulls and of
[1:26:37] goats should take away sins wherefore
[1:26:39] when he cometh into the world he says
[1:26:41] sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not
[1:26:43] but a body has thou prepared me and
[1:26:46] burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin
[1:26:48] thou has had no pleasure then said I lo
[1:26:52] I come and the volume of the book is
[1:26:53] written of me to do thy will o God above
[1:26:56] when he said sacrifice and offering and
[1:26:58] burnt offerings and offering for sin
[1:27:00] thou wouldest not neither had us
[1:27:02] pleasure therein which are offered by
[1:27:04] the law
[1:27:04] then he said lo I come to do thy will o
[1:27:07] God to take away the first that he may
[1:27:09] establish the second by the which will
[1:27:12] we are sanctified through the offering
[1:27:14] of the body of Jesus Christ once for all
[1:27:16] and every priest standing daily
[1:27:18] ministering and offering oftentimes the
[1:27:21] same sacrifices which can never take
[1:27:23] away sins but this man after he had
[1:27:26] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[1:27:28] sat down on the right hand of God from
[1:27:30] henceforth expecting until his enemies
[1:27:32] be made his footstool for by one
[1:27:34] offering he has perfected for them
[1:27:36] forever them that are sanctified I mean
[1:27:40] so the Apostle Paul is trying to get
[1:27:41] these Hebrews to see that the that the
[1:27:44] the blood of Jesus Christ him being our
[1:27:46] high priest is far greater than the high
[1:27:48] priest of Aaron and the blood of bulls
[1:27:49] and goats but it breaks the sin cycle
[1:27:51] right so once in your every year the
[1:27:54] high priest had to go and every year he
[1:27:55] had to take the blood I mean but it
[1:27:57] doesn't change the people that he was
[1:27:58] going in on the behalf of I mean but
[1:28:01] when our Lord Jesus ascended with his
[1:28:02] own blood amen and that sacrifice was
[1:28:05] accepted and he came back down on you
[1:28:07] know you know on to earth that that was
[1:28:10] done and it was attributed to you
[1:28:12] hallelujah when you're on the cross he
[1:28:15] was on I mean when he was on the cross
[1:28:17] you were on his mind right so now that
[1:28:20] was done for you right and then it came
[1:28:22] into your season where by faith you
[1:28:25] accepted it because it was done on your
[1:28:26] behalf as his name was announced by the
[1:28:29] angel you shall call his name Jesus for
[1:28:31] he shall save his people from their sins
[1:28:33] so he shall deliver them from their sins
[1:28:36] hallelujah so one offering was done and
[1:28:38] that was done on your behalf and that's
[1:28:40] why when you come and believe the word
[1:28:42] becomes a life do you believe it you see
[1:28:44] it manifesting that sacrifice
[1:28:46] manifesting in you or the power of it
[1:28:48] you're following me I mean because we
[1:28:50] don't have to go we don't have to go
[1:28:52] back to Jerusalem he doesn't have to die
[1:28:53] again it's already been done right it
[1:28:56] was done once did you know you know the
[1:28:58] disciples didn't know what was going on
[1:29:00] that was their lamb hanging between
[1:29:01] heavens and earth but it was attributed
[1:29:03] to them because they were part of him
[1:29:05] hallelujah because they were the
[1:29:07] feminist part of him and then and it was
[1:29:10] attributed to them that's why they went
[1:29:12] to the upper room in the spirit that was
[1:29:13] released out of his blood came into them
[1:29:15] and the same life lived out of them
[1:29:18] you know how high priest it's not a you
[1:29:22] know as the as the book of Hebrew said
[1:29:23] that he is touched by the feeling of our
[1:29:25] infirmities so he's not some distant
[1:29:28] high priest somewhere that doesn't
[1:29:29] understand your human condition but he
[1:29:32] became a man that he would know what
[1:29:34] it's like to be bullied he would know
[1:29:36] what it's like to be rejected he would
[1:29:38] know what it's be like to me to be made
[1:29:40] fun of you following me to be
[1:29:43] misunderstood I mean to be marked to be
[1:29:45] scoffed pressure of life to come and
[1:29:48] brother have says here though the Bible
[1:29:50] says he has tempted on all points yet
[1:29:52] without sin so he was tempted by sexual
[1:29:55] pressure everything you can name whether
[1:29:57] we don't with a right to sate or not he
[1:29:59] was tempted by it but yet without sin
[1:30:01] and and he was that way that when you
[1:30:05] come to the same battle Amen that you
[1:30:07] could say Lord Jesus you understand what
[1:30:10] it's like to be in my shoes and he says
[1:30:13] yes I know what it's like to be in your
[1:30:14] shoes I can relate to your present
[1:30:17] condition he knows what it's like to
[1:30:18] lose family right Joseph Joseph was
[1:30:21] there when he was born but when Jesus
[1:30:22] comes the age of 30 Joseph isn't in the
[1:30:24] scripture anymore why is that cuz he
[1:30:26] died he knows what it's like to lose
[1:30:28] family he knows what it's like to be
[1:30:29] hungry he knows what it's you know he
[1:30:31] knows everything you are going through
[1:30:33] or have been through he understands and
[1:30:35] he was made that way that's why he came
[1:30:38] to experience human suffering and pain
[1:30:41] that he can enter into your need
[1:30:44] remember Jesus is not a God's not a
[1:30:47] robot
[1:30:48] he's not just some statue standing there
[1:30:50] he's a living being amen and his
[1:30:53] experiences of walking upon this earth
[1:30:55] he still has those experiences in him
[1:30:57] hallelujah just like experiences of life
[1:31:00] and I don't you know I said it before
[1:31:01] but those who are learning to drive you
[1:31:03] can know all the theory you can know
[1:31:05] everything about the car you can maybe
[1:31:07] build it off the top of your head you
[1:31:08] know it that well but when you get into
[1:31:10] the driver's seat and you put the key in
[1:31:13] the ignition
[1:31:13] take off the handbrake begin to drive
[1:31:16] this is different because now you're
[1:31:20] experiencing what it's like to drive
[1:31:22] it's not theory it's experience amen and
[1:31:26] that experience doesn't leave you
[1:31:28] whether you want it to leave you
[1:31:30] sometimes or not because you did
[1:31:31] thing but you know what I mean but
[1:31:33] there's experiences that it's the same
[1:31:35] thing with him his experiences God knows
[1:31:38] all things but God had to become a man
[1:31:41] to experience what it's like to be you
[1:31:43] that he can understand what you're going
[1:31:45] through that he can relate to you know
[1:31:48] because that's why he's touched by the
[1:31:49] feeling of our infirmities because he
[1:31:51] knows what it's like to be sick he knows
[1:31:53] what it's like to have it you know go
[1:31:55] through great trials hallelujah and he
[1:31:58] still has those experiences in them you
[1:32:01] think yep you know it's like us some
[1:32:03] things we will forget but some things
[1:32:05] will still remember because God is not
[1:32:08] you know what you know what would it
[1:32:10] make you know there's no sense therefore
[1:32:12] we go through this how you are trials of
[1:32:14] life and we worship Him as a redeemer
[1:32:16] and we remember all the good and the bad
[1:32:18] that's happened to us we remember the
[1:32:20] bed we remember the good but then what
[1:32:23] good is it now but then our bodies
[1:32:25] changed and we forget all those things
[1:32:27] what was the purpose of what we just
[1:32:29] went through you say where you got the
[1:32:30] character but we worship Him on that
[1:32:31] side too when the lamb takes the book
[1:32:34] the four and twenty elders cast it
[1:32:36] crowns down and that's a representation
[1:32:38] of you says thou art worthy to redeem us
[1:32:41] back to God by your blood so they knew
[1:32:44] what it's like to be redeemed so they
[1:32:46] knew us like to be lost they know what
[1:32:48] it's like to be under the bondage of
[1:32:50] Satan and to be liberated and those
[1:32:53] people represent you you know it's not
[1:32:55] going to be when you know we're gathered
[1:32:57] around the throne and we will be and the
[1:33:00] crown I don't know how the crown is
[1:33:01] going to come out to crown them but do
[1:33:03] you think we're just going to go Bravo
[1:33:06] look it's going to be the noisiest place
[1:33:09] this place is a library computer well
[1:33:12] that's gonna be like there goes my Lords
[1:33:15] crime Oh a start worthy I'm glad he's
[1:33:17] been crowd I'm so glad I've been
[1:33:19] gathered here he's the one that relieved
[1:33:21] me he's the one the same make he shed
[1:33:23] his blood upon the earth for me or just
[1:33:25] to get a glimpse of him will be
[1:33:26] wonderful hallelujah because we know
[1:33:28] what it's like for who knows what it's
[1:33:30] like to be lost and you're wandering
[1:33:32] through world in you and you know you
[1:33:33] think you've got it all sorted out and
[1:33:35] you don't have nothing so you're just
[1:33:37] bluffing yourself it's fine let's get it
[1:33:39] yeah it'll work out yes this is gonna
[1:33:41] work and you're something around in a
[1:33:42] maze but then a light comes on
[1:33:45] and you look up and hand reaches down
[1:33:48] polarise this child come out of that
[1:33:50] place you know yes Lord deliver me from
[1:33:52] this thicket I can't get out hallelujah
[1:33:55] and you always like to be on the strong
[1:33:56] shoulders of a shepherd he carries you
[1:33:58] back to the sheepfold hallelujah amen I
[1:34:02] know what that's like and and that's why
[1:34:05] we're gonna those experiences we're
[1:34:07] gonna worship Him because of those
[1:34:10] things because you worship true
[1:34:11] worshipers out of Revelation right so
[1:34:14] you're gonna have a revelation your
[1:34:16] redeemed hasn't been revealed to you
[1:34:17] that he died for you that's more that's
[1:34:19] not mummy daddy's story someone else's
[1:34:21] story it's your story where Calvary goes
[1:34:24] from a historical event then you see he
[1:34:26] took your place there he was your son
[1:34:28] offering what's happened it's been
[1:34:30] revealed to you it's anchored in your
[1:34:32] soul you can't deny it any more than you
[1:34:34] can deny your own life hallelujah
[1:34:37] because it becomes a revelation and then
[1:34:39] now you can worship Him as your lamb as
[1:34:42] your blood sacrifice because it's been
[1:34:44] revealed he comes you says I'd die for
[1:34:46] you I redeemed you I purchase your
[1:34:49] salvation hello and then you can worship
[1:34:51] say Lord you are my salvation you're my
[1:34:54] strength and my song hallelujah amen and
[1:34:58] then and then and that's why that's why
[1:35:01] actually trials are so good because God
[1:35:04] is right in the trial he's willing to
[1:35:05] show himself and then you can look back
[1:35:08] from where you've been and yet and
[1:35:10] because what happens is God allows the
[1:35:12] devil to get on your case because God
[1:35:14] wants to reveal part of himself to you
[1:35:16] hallelujah and the eating go through
[1:35:18] great things and you can look back like
[1:35:20] at the end of the day said oh that
[1:35:21] you're lighting the beard think about
[1:35:22] your day I think you have a conversation
[1:35:24] with the Lord Lord Jesus you got me out
[1:35:28] of that car wreck I should have died
[1:35:30] there well this should have happened you
[1:35:33] know and you go back and he's like yeah
[1:35:34] we got through some things today didn't
[1:35:37] we
[1:35:37] oh yeah and then you say thank you Lord
[1:35:40] that was wonderful
[1:35:41] hallelujah because he wants to build a
[1:35:44] relationship you're following me this is
[1:35:46] our high priest he's not a separate God
[1:35:48] some place somewhere but he's down at
[1:35:50] our dress wherever we are he's there
[1:35:53] hallelujah Amen I'm glad he's that way I
[1:35:58] mean that he took on human battles that
[1:36:01] he could under he could relate to us
[1:36:03] hallelujah amen never everything now now
[1:36:10] the devil comes along and says he
[1:36:11] doesn't understand what it's like he
[1:36:14] doesn't let he'd even lived in this
[1:36:15] modern era I tell you what same devil
[1:36:18] was there as the same devil here he may
[1:36:21] have just rebranded it's the same old
[1:36:24] company doesn't matter the logo changes
[1:36:27] the slow go changes maybe the building
[1:36:28] changes the stationary changes same old
[1:36:31] company same old devil he knows so never
[1:36:35] let the devil think oh he doesn't
[1:36:37] understand you he's not interested in
[1:36:39] you no that's a lie that's a lie from
[1:36:42] the pit of hell how God is very
[1:36:44] interested in you that's why this
[1:36:46] message came your way as he wanted you
[1:36:48] to see who he is and who you are in him
[1:36:51] he's very determined that you would
[1:36:53] understand oh yeah
[1:36:55] but he does he oh but he you know he
[1:36:58] never had this problem he was tempted on
[1:37:00] all points Derek go his Oh more homework
[1:37:04] go find the scripture he was tempted on
[1:37:07] all points yet without sin
[1:37:10] and go look at the definition of wall it
[1:37:12] doesn't mean sum doesn't mean on the
[1:37:14] majority all encompassing everything
[1:37:18] everything you can imagine he was
[1:37:20] tempted that way amen that means he was
[1:37:24] tempted by a homosexual spirit amen he's
[1:37:27] tempted by those things peer pressure
[1:37:29] everything that comes against us he was
[1:37:32] tempted worse oh that's just a modern
[1:37:34] think no it's as old as old as old can
[1:37:36] be it's all here hallelujah so never let
[1:37:40] the devil think no don't believe the
[1:37:43] devil's lied that God does not
[1:37:44] understand you and God does not care
[1:37:45] because he understands and he cares he
[1:37:49] careth for you
[1:37:50] he cares for you the seals come open the
[1:37:53] word is open and and what is one of the
[1:37:56] sermons brother and preaches he cares he
[1:37:59] cares for you but then the question is
[1:38:01] do you care do you care do you care
[1:38:04] because he cares I mean what's our
[1:38:07] attitude back hallelujah it's a knell
[1:38:10] hearing is so the high priest now when
[1:38:14] the high priest came out because
[1:38:16] remember only the high priest could go
[1:38:17] into the Holy of Holies and so now when
[1:38:20] he went in with the blood all of us
[1:38:22] rayul they cared about it anyway we're
[1:38:25] waiting is he gonna be accepted was he
[1:38:29] dressed just right you know was he
[1:38:31] anointed just right remember we can't
[1:38:33] member okay just just imagine we're not
[1:38:35] Israel I mean we're not Levites we're
[1:38:37] not part of the process we don't help
[1:38:38] him get dressed whatever more we're just
[1:38:40] there we're on the grandstand it's up to
[1:38:42] him we can't help him in any way we
[1:38:45] can't put our own put we just there and
[1:38:48] here he is you see him going he's
[1:38:51] anointed his dress and maybe maybe
[1:38:53] something was standing saying is that
[1:38:55] right you know you're looking from afar
[1:38:57] off does that look right to you you know
[1:38:59] you can't do anything about it this is
[1:39:01] this is now this is perilous times cuz
[1:39:04] if he's accepted I'm accepted if he's
[1:39:06] rejected I'm rejected and if you read
[1:39:10] you know you go read the scripture not

[1:39:18] chilling out today so good you know not
[1:39:20] some blase kind of attitude if they went
[1:39:22] in that way they died God is not a
[1:39:25] respecter of person right so they
[1:39:27] wouldn't so he had to be anointed right
[1:39:29] dress right everything just right and
[1:39:31] they're waiting and in their silence
[1:39:34] he's been silent was he accepted I
[1:39:37] remember he winnin historically the high
[1:39:41] priest was here the book of Acts read
[1:39:43] about him then he ascended where is he
[1:39:46] he's either living to making
[1:39:48] intercession for us right but the high
[1:39:51] priest has to appear again he's
[1:39:53] following me Jesse no Rome go it's
[1:39:55] enough so so so now he has to appear so
[1:39:57] now here we are outside the courtyard
[1:39:59] you're outside the tabernacle what's
[1:40:01] happening you can't hear anything you
[1:40:04] waiting and then you see the fail come

[1:40:13] out-of-court you see a foot come through
[1:40:16] you see more cat and the Bloods been
[1:40:20] applied to the mercy seat hallelujah the
[1:40:22] blood has been applied and then we can
[1:40:25] rejoice saying he did his job
[1:40:27] Polly is anointed he win it according to
[1:40:30] the Word of God amen he applied the
[1:40:32] blood on my behalf when I could not get
[1:40:34] mercy when I could not apply the blood
[1:40:36] he applied the blood on my behalf and
[1:40:39] then other than a hill is Gimli trumpet
[1:40:41] ring supper go out there Israel
[1:40:46] hallelujah and you might be a slave you
[1:40:48] couldn't have gone around the
[1:40:49] congregation and your tabernacle and
[1:40:51] your and your in the field but then you
[1:40:53] hear a trumpet blowing I'm not going to
[1:40:55] try and imitate it being here the
[1:40:56] trumpet blasts number you're the
[1:40:58] chauffeur go forth and you can put this
[1:41:00] thing down I'm not it olia
[1:41:03] and your taskmaster couldn't stop you he
[1:41:06] had no legal right to hold you anymore
[1:41:08] you could go back to your position
[1:41:10] hallelujah you had the right to go back
[1:41:13] hallelujah and now here we are it's been
[1:41:16] seven Church ages as Jesus three two one
[1:41:20] five what is he how do we baptize what
[1:41:23] kind of God is he all tradition why cuz
[1:41:26] he's been behind the veil he's been
[1:41:29] behind the veil but then now we seen
[1:41:31] Elijah upon the earth a prophet ministry
[1:41:34] upon the earth and then now here he
[1:41:36] comes in spirit for men we're gonna meet
[1:41:38] him in the air right that's the end of
[1:41:39] the coming right but he comes down and
[1:41:41] spirit for it is little man he says now
[1:41:44] I'm waiting for someone
[1:41:45] I'm waiting for someone I'm just your
[1:41:47] brother I'm as helpless as helpless
[1:41:48] gonna be I'm waiting for the angel of
[1:41:50] the Lord and then you hear people's
[1:41:53] testimonies he didn't need to say he was
[1:41:55] there people knew he was there
[1:41:57] just such an atmosphere came into the
[1:41:59] place God came down and that same God I
[1:42:02] believe is here and God came down and he
[1:42:06] says now I take every spirit under my
[1:42:07] control for the glory of God that you
[1:42:09] would know that Jesus Christ is alive
[1:42:11] and he's present and people would come
[1:42:13] before the prophet and all of their
[1:42:15] lives are exposed name
[1:42:17] addresses sicknesses whatever it was
[1:42:19] hallelujah and he'll be standing there
[1:42:21] behind the pulpit and he would point
[1:42:22] people up he didn't say someone over
[1:42:24] here has a backache you know I could
[1:42:27] stand here and say this how it's got to
[1:42:30] the Lord the Lord telling me someone had
[1:42:32] a bad night's sleep over here oh you
[1:42:36] know better Oh someone over here's their
[1:42:38] back aches no it wasn't that way it's
[1:42:40] you you're praying for this this is why
[1:42:42] you're here you have this need this is
[1:42:44] your name I see you come from a
[1:42:46] mountainous place and names and
[1:42:47] everything go go people even receive it
[1:42:49] and then he asked the question who did
[1:42:52] they touch who did he touch who did she
[1:42:55] touch this 30 feet from me they didn't
[1:42:58] physically touch me he says they touched
[1:43:00] the high priests they touch your high
[1:43:02] priests I mean because he's touched by
[1:43:04] the feeling of our infirmities Jesus
[1:43:07] Christ is not a God of history he's not
[1:43:09] a God of our imagination he's a living
[1:43:12] being that's present and emphasizes they
[1:43:15] touch the high priest he say well what
[1:43:17] does that mean he is saying the high
[1:43:20] priest was standing there put on flesh
[1:43:22] and a redeemed son is this okay hey the
[1:43:25] high priest is in you the same Jesus
[1:43:28] it's the same Jesus in the body well I
[1:43:30] can say the high priest is in you but
[1:43:32] the high priest came down into a prophet
[1:43:34] a man in useless vocal cords to speak to
[1:43:37] people to show that he was there in
[1:43:39] spirit form hallelujah so now there's no
[1:43:42] more controversy amen what's happened
[1:43:45] the high priest has come out and he's
[1:43:48] here to declare I've applied the blood
[1:43:50] on your behalf I have redeemed you I
[1:43:53] mean I sprinkled my own blood that it's
[1:43:56] no longer a judgement seat for you it's
[1:43:58] a mercy seat I mean that you and I have
[1:44:01] mercy because I applied when you
[1:44:03] couldn't do it none of us can save
[1:44:05] another you know you know what kind of
[1:44:07] state we're born in none of us can help
[1:44:09] one another and it doesn't matter our
[1:44:11] intentions we can spend our lives we
[1:44:13] could spend a million lives trying to
[1:44:15] learn this and and go to every Bible
[1:44:19] school he's ever been and it wouldn't do
[1:44:21] us one bit of good without him
[1:44:25] applying Hesburgh because with that
[1:44:27] without his blood we're lost
[1:44:29] doesn't matter how religious we are we
[1:44:32] can quote the message word-for-word from
[1:44:34] 1947 1965 from genesis 1:1 to the amen
[1:44:37] and the end of revelation doesn't help
[1:44:39] you so without his blood being applied
[1:44:43] on your behalf you are as lost as lost
[1:44:45] can be right we are in the max that we
[1:44:48] are born into a maximum-security prison
[1:44:50] and is you can't tunnel out you can't
[1:44:53] you can't get on anyway you can't bribe
[1:44:55] the guards the devil doesn't want you
[1:44:56] out you're absolutely stuck we're born
[1:45:00] lost friends doesn't matter you can be
[1:45:02] raised in the message without a new
[1:45:04] birth you're still stuck you're still
[1:45:06] lost I mean but the reason the high
[1:45:08] priest has come out I trust us mean
[1:45:10] something to you is that he wants you to
[1:45:12] know your freedom has been bought I mean
[1:45:14] you're no longer the devil slave I
[1:45:16] remember you have been purchased by my
[1:45:18] blood you have been redeemed by my blood
[1:45:20] and the trumpet has been sounded
[1:45:22] hallelujah this gospel trumpet has been
[1:45:25] sounded that you can come to a
[1:45:27] realization was that sound
[1:45:29] and then something in you cries out the
[1:45:32] blood cries freedom hallelujah that you
[1:45:35] have now a choice you hear the gospel
[1:45:37] trumpet you have a choice will I stay or
[1:45:39] will I go now let's just weigh these two
[1:45:42] things up if I stay I'll be broken I'll
[1:45:47] be spiritually wounded I will try and
[1:45:50] find satisfaction my taskmasters will
[1:45:53] give me all kinds of things he'll give
[1:45:56] me a dead religion he'll give me drugs
[1:45:58] he'll give me YouTube to be buried into
[1:46:01] he'll give me broken relationship to
[1:46:03] broken relationship he will not give me
[1:46:05] peace so that's the state okay that is
[1:46:08] the reality doesn't matter how good it
[1:46:10] looks
[1:46:11] doesn't matter how great the Instagram
[1:46:12] posts are that's the reality why do many
[1:46:15] Hollywood stars and musicians die young
[1:46:17] because they get anointed with the
[1:46:19] spirit they're given all this fame and
[1:46:22] they're not built to handle it and
[1:46:23] they're trying to make a find an escape
[1:46:25] because their souls are tormented I
[1:46:28] don't condemn though I feel sorry for
[1:46:30] people like that because they're trapped
[1:46:32] right but Hollywood doesn't show you
[1:46:35] that side
[1:46:36] they show you the glamorous side it's
[1:46:39] not glamorous there's nothing to it
[1:46:41] nothing lasting so that's the stay okay
[1:46:44] that's the state what if I hear the
[1:46:47] trumpet and I go what's for me well
[1:46:50] let's just think is you okay I just say
[1:46:52] one thing there's eternal life
[1:46:54] there's eternal life there's a rapture
[1:46:57] there's a peace that passes all
[1:46:59] understanding you will know who you
[1:47:01] really are your identity will not ship
[1:47:04] with the sands you'll not be tossed to
[1:47:06] and fro amen you'll know who your father
[1:47:08] is
[1:47:09] I mean you'll know that your father is
[1:47:11] God himself
[1:47:12] hallelujah it's peace this joyous wiggle
[1:47:15] or full of glory remember the greatest
[1:47:18] the world offers is a perversion of the
[1:47:21] Holy Ghost it doesn't matter if it's in
[1:47:24] capsule form pill form full form music
[1:47:26] for whatever's it's just a perversion
[1:47:28] it's just a perversion and when you get
[1:47:32] hit with the Holy Ghost you may say what
[1:47:35] did I do
[1:47:36] just like in the world what happened
[1:47:38] last night I can't remember right but
[1:47:40] you have no regrets you have absolutely
[1:47:42] no regrets and you just want more of it
[1:47:45] you say you're just making this up no
[1:47:47] I've been there hallelujah and his joy
[1:47:51] is wonderful his peace that passes all
[1:47:53] understanding and it's not just a nice
[1:47:56] pie in the sky think it's a reality and
[1:47:58] when brother home came back from the
[1:47:59] curtain of time he says it's so
[1:48:00] wonderful so sublime no words can
[1:48:03] describe how great it is I mean he
[1:48:05] wasn't just painting it up right he
[1:48:07] wasn't just trying to paint it up he's
[1:48:09] saying that's how it really was it was
[1:48:10] so amazing I couldn't describe it
[1:48:13] hallelujah so there's your two decisions
[1:48:17] will you stay you say but this road has
[1:48:24] trials and hardship god that's good
[1:48:29] it's worth it it's worth it because
[1:48:32] God's developing character God's
[1:48:34] creating situations as I said that he
[1:48:36] can actually reveal himself the other
[1:48:37] devil the devil bought this fall into
[1:48:41] the world brought sin into the world and
[1:48:43] he did that that God could express
[1:48:45] himself in his fullness to his people
[1:48:47] how
[1:48:49] God could go to head him before the fall
[1:48:52] and Eve I'm your Redeemer
[1:48:53] I'm your high priest I'm your advocate
[1:48:56] I'm your sacrifice
[1:48:57] I'm your peace - they need peace before
[1:49:01] the fall
[1:49:02] do they need a high priest do they need
[1:49:04] blood why does he think that's all
[1:49:06] do they need they need a guide do they
[1:49:11] need those things know so these are
[1:49:14] there was a big part of God that was
[1:49:15] locked up he couldn't express himself
[1:49:18] and that was the reason he made man is
[1:49:20] that he'd have a relationship with you
[1:49:22] then he'd be able to express his heart
[1:49:24] to you everything he was that he would
[1:49:26] not that you would know him not
[1:49:28] intellectually but you're done by
[1:49:29] relationship right
[1:49:31] so the devil actually just opened the
[1:49:34] door that God could fully manifest
[1:49:36] himself to to us hallelujah he did God a
[1:49:40] favor I'll put it that way you're the
[1:49:41] devil with it he just loses you know the
[1:49:45] devil gets no credit you know he gets
[1:49:48] nothing he's a loser are you with me the
[1:49:51] devil's a loser everything he tries God
[1:49:54] just turns it around for God's good and
[1:49:56] and turns it around for your good
[1:49:58] hallelujah you know you have the devil
[1:50:01] had half a brain cell he would actually
[1:50:03] leave humans alone he would actually
[1:50:06] take his hands off human race because
[1:50:08] that way one they don't need God and to
[1:50:12] God can't reveal himself to them right
[1:50:14] it comes in trials in hardship that God
[1:50:18] comes down I mean it's not and
[1:50:20] everything's fine have you who's been
[1:50:24] desperate in their lives
[1:50:25] you've come to a desperate state now
[1:50:29] what you call upon God without that
[1:50:32] desperate state in that same manner
[1:50:34] no God allows it because God wants it
[1:50:38] because it's part of himself he needs
[1:50:40] you need to know who you you say well I
[1:50:44] don't like to be in a desperate state
[1:50:45] it's a good way to be it's actually a
[1:50:47] good way to be because God wants to come
[1:50:48] upon the scene now I meet you at last
[1:50:51] last Wednesday but Hannah Hannah was
[1:50:56] barren now this is not our high priest
[1:50:58] but God respects the office of a high
[1:50:59] priest
[1:51:00] Hannah was barren
[1:51:02] huh whatever Ike I don't even know the
[1:51:05] term for another wife of you know
[1:51:07] polygamy whatever anyway
[1:51:09] her rival wife I mean whatever it's
[1:51:12] called you know what I mean
[1:51:14] the man had two wives someone help me up
[1:51:17] yes take it one there we go thank you
[1:51:19] hallelujah oh my hey so the second wife
[1:51:25] she had the sons Hannah had nothing she
[1:51:29] gets desperate and she goes to the
[1:51:32] Tabernacles and Eli the high priestess
[1:51:35] death there he's back slidden
[1:51:37] he does yo he has no spiritual sight
[1:51:39] here she is crying out to God and he
[1:51:43] looks at her and says she's drunk
[1:51:46] and and and he actually rebukes her put
[1:51:49] away your wine don't come like this but
[1:51:52] here's you had this burden I must have a
[1:51:54] child
[1:51:55] desperation brings change it brings real
[1:51:58] change if you go to the right sauce that
[1:52:01] brings real change and so God God
[1:52:03] actually respected that Eli does
[1:52:05] backslidden state because he was the
[1:52:06] high priest and he said go thy way may
[1:52:09] God grant your prayer and she received
[1:52:11] at us from God and she received Samuel
[1:52:14] hallelujah now friends I'll tell you our
[1:52:16] high priest is not some fat old man
[1:52:18] who's backslidden right here's here's
[1:52:21] Jesus Christ I'm in the land of God
[1:52:24] hallelujah but if a woman can go to a
[1:52:26] backslidden high priest right and get
[1:52:29] what she needed
[1:52:30] how much more you and I when we go to
[1:52:33] our Lord Jesus how much you how much I
[1:52:37] when we go to him in our out of
[1:52:38] desperation hallelujah how God is prayer
[1:52:42] answering I'm very I'm I I'm absolutely
[1:52:46] uh uh southern poem I need to help me
[1:52:49] again
[1:52:50] but I'm sold out there's nothing he
[1:52:53] cannot answer there is nothing he cannot
[1:52:55] do a man that's yo that's what I believe
[1:53:00] hallelujah I mean so friends now if he
[1:53:04] can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:53:05] infirmities amen
[1:53:07] should we not call upon him in our time
[1:53:09] of need you say well you probably say
[1:53:11] that every Sunday the thing is we have
[1:53:14] to start speaking
[1:53:15] we have to start really praying right
[1:53:18] because he wants to hear from you and
[1:53:20] remember it's not about your condition
[1:53:23] you say well am i worthy to to to
[1:53:26] receive what I need remember you don't
[1:53:27] come into the equation the lamb was
[1:53:30] examined if the lamb was found perfect
[1:53:33] the lamb was offered and the worshiper
[1:53:35] was accepted you're following me right
[1:53:37] and so number one it's it's the Lambs
[1:53:43] condition that mattered not the
[1:53:45] worshipers condition because the devil
[1:53:47] beats us around because we read the
[1:53:49] message we read the Bible and we and we
[1:53:51] see about how you know we we are we made
[1:53:53] into the image of the son and that's a
[1:53:55] bit intimidating yeah Kannada can I be
[1:53:59] intimidating you see how Jesus was how
[1:54:02] he conducted himself you see the life of
[1:54:05] Paul you see the life of life of God and
[1:54:07] brother Branham he said well how am I
[1:54:09] ever going to become like that he's
[1:54:11] following me and and and sometimes it
[1:54:13] can be way up here and we can you know
[1:54:15] we can think how can we ever obtain to
[1:54:16] that well number one I'll say it's not
[1:54:19] about you it's not about how you're
[1:54:21] going to get there it's his blood will
[1:54:23] get you there his word will make you
[1:54:25] this so the pressure actually goes off
[1:54:28] you you have to give yourself you got to
[1:54:32] unreservedly give yourself to his word
[1:54:34] right you can't hold anything back right
[1:54:37] but it's not you that will become us
[1:54:39] it's him if you let him do it so the
[1:54:43] pressure actually goes upon him not upon
[1:54:46] you it goes upon the blood not upon you
[1:54:48] amen why do we put why do we put
[1:54:50] pressure on ourselves why do we put all
[1:54:53] this pressure now the pressure should be
[1:54:54] upon him brother Brahim he preaches the
[1:54:57] breech
[1:54:58] he's more homework I can give you a lot
[1:55:00] I'm not coming back to this class again
[1:55:04] go listen to the breech message
[1:55:06] it's an event taking place the lamb
[1:55:07] takes the book opens the seals brother
[1:55:10] Bram ties his taking the book he says at
[1:55:11] the beautiful picture of this in the
[1:55:12] book of Ruth and you go to the Book of
[1:55:15] Ruth Ruth goes to a threshing floor
[1:55:18] she's a Moabite she has no part of the
[1:55:21] economy of God even said even sees in
[1:55:23] the law no Moabite oh no my bike can
[1:55:26] come into the congregation of Israel if
[1:55:29] have you read that so the law is
[1:55:32] actually against her but she comes to
[1:55:34] the threshing floor she sees where he
[1:55:37] laid down
[1:55:38] she had covers his feet lays down at his
[1:55:42] feet and then he wakes up there's a
[1:55:46] picture of because you're the book
[1:55:47] you're part of the book you understand
[1:55:50] whether worse is my sublime act in all
[1:55:51] the scripture the Lamb taking the book
[1:55:53] the lamb purchasing you or claiming you
[1:55:55] right so now she comes there lays down
[1:55:58] at his feet and he wakes up and then he
[1:56:01] says who are you they said she says I'm
[1:56:06] your near kinsman cover me with your
[1:56:09] with your skirt so now she goes he she
[1:56:14] cannot she cannot redeem her
[1:56:18] father-in-law
[1:56:19] I mean her her mother-in-law other Naomi
[1:56:22] remember she is now his daughter-in-law
[1:56:24] they are widows they can't give back
[1:56:27] their position whatsoever they are stuck
[1:56:29] just gleaning in the field tried to
[1:56:31] survive but yet they have a possession
[1:56:34] naomi has a possession in the land but
[1:56:37] she can't get it so they can't do it and
[1:56:41] and if Ruth put pressure on herself she
[1:56:43] said there's no way even by the
[1:56:44] scripture that I can become part of this
[1:56:46] that I can even help my mother-in-law to
[1:56:49] get back her position but she goes she
[1:56:52] doesn't look at herself the pressure
[1:56:53] goes on boys
[1:56:55] hallelujah no me says he's a near
[1:56:57] kinsman to thee go find where he lays
[1:56:59] gonna lay down there she avoids the
[1:57:02] instructions of her mother-in-law she
[1:57:03] goes there face down at his feet he
[1:57:05] wakes up she says I'm a near kinsman
[1:57:08] cover me with your skirt cover my shame
[1:57:11] come my past redeem me I'm a near
[1:57:15] kinsman the losses and their kinsmen
[1:57:17] must come and redeem us hello yeah and
[1:57:20] then now saw her cry because she
[1:57:23] couldn't help herself but her cry
[1:57:25] put Boaz into action though it may tarry
[1:57:29] it shall be hallelujah time doesn't mean
[1:57:32] anything with God oh it's been years it
[1:57:35] maybe is don't worry about time
[1:57:38] don't let your faith be anchored on
[1:57:39] situation or time or circumstance your
[1:57:42] face should be anchored on the Word of
[1:57:44] God and the Word of God alone that's
[1:57:46] what our face should be upon hallelujah
[1:57:49] and then Sanel she he he gives her six
[1:57:53] measures of barley
[1:57:54] he's the Sabbath holy gives her a
[1:57:58] promise she goes back to her
[1:58:00] mother-in-law and her mother-in-law says
[1:58:02] he will not rest until he's done what
[1:58:05] he's promised you this day oh yeah and
[1:58:08] so now but who caused that to happen I
[1:58:10] want to ask you the question who cause
[1:58:12] had to happen it was rose going to the
[1:58:14] threshing floor I mean that caused Bo
[1:58:16] acid to redeem her he say well I'm
[1:58:19] nothing no don't do you ever think
[1:58:22] you're nothing I trust this means
[1:58:24] something to you you ever think you're
[1:58:26] not worthy or you've gone too far or too
[1:58:28] long or wherever no don't worry lay down
[1:58:31] call upon him hallelujah and you know
[1:58:37] the end of the story he marries her
[1:58:40] redeems now his position restores it to
[1:58:43] her and she hurt her her first life of
[1:58:48] being a mob itís a wood Oh with nothing
[1:58:51] that's eradicated by Union with boys her
[1:58:56] life is no longer she's no longer Ruth
[1:58:59] of Moab but she's Ruth of Bethlehem I
[1:59:02] mean she is mrs. boys obviously him well
[1:59:05] ouya and now this is how high parisi
[1:59:07] it's not I know I trust does he mean I
[1:59:10] trust he's not just it's not a working
[1:59:12] relationship you and God but it's a love
[1:59:16] affair it's a love affair between you
[1:59:18] and God
[1:59:19] I mean then when we talk about high
[1:59:20] priests it's not just some office and
[1:59:22] some distant functionable this is your
[1:59:23] job description there's no he he he came
[1:59:26] to unite himself with you and he came in
[1:59:31] this day and he's present that you would
[1:59:34] understand you don't have to stay
[1:59:36] destitute you're in the stay under the
[1:59:39] slavery of sin I mean but the gospel
[1:59:41] trumpet has wrung out the blood has been
[1:59:44] applied and he steps forth why does the
[1:59:46] high priest come out from the veil as a
[1:59:48] show I applied the blood the blood has
[1:59:51] been applied
[1:59:51] hallelujah and why is this message come
[1:59:54] not that we just have Creek doctrine
[1:59:56] it's more than just Creek doctrines as
[1:59:58] the life of God has come forth Jesus
[2:00:01] Christ has stepped out of history that
[2:00:02] you would know that he has not a God
[2:00:04] that I was but he is amen and that is
[2:00:07] not not this is not a nice storybook
[2:00:09] this is reality but they know that puts
[2:00:15] into force now a restoration hallelujah
[2:00:19] where every man shall return to his
[2:00:20] position and maybe we'll leave it there
[2:00:22] until Wednesday but there's now a force
[2:00:26] this word has a force and this word has
[2:00:30] a force and it's determined I will
[2:00:32] restore my people I was thinking of
[2:00:34] those words I will restore the Lord said

[2:00:52] I will restore you to your position and
[2:00:54] me I will restore the bride to a rifle
[2:00:57] place I will and if you ever hear have
[2:01:00] you ever read those words in the
[2:01:01] scripture I will and it's God saying it
[2:01:04] it happens it's not the devil saying I
[2:01:07] will cuz it doesn't happen it comes to
[2:01:09] nothing but ashes and destruction but
[2:01:11] when God says I will it happens you can
[2:01:15] bet your soul on it it will happen
