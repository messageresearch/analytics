[0:25] [Music]
[0:41] [Music]
[0:42] so
[0:44] [Music]
[0:52] [Music]
[0:56] do
[1:10] good evening science welcome to the
[1:12] house of the lord
[1:14] it is a wednesday prayer meeting
[1:16] old-fashioned way
[1:18] amen um
[1:22] yeah so let's leave all our burdens out
[1:24] there by the door for now
[1:26] and all the things of the week and
[1:29] leave it at jesus's feet and welcome i
[1:32] mean to come and join us because there's
[1:33] a lot to keep us busy
[1:35] but there's a lot to be thankful for now
[1:38] i just had a thought today we
[1:40] um and and me and brother either one was
[1:44] speaking about it
[1:44] is you say sometimes you're working and
[1:48] you go
[1:48] what if somebody that was in a
[1:50] wheelchair that couldn't walk
[1:52] who couldn't move was sitting right next
[1:54] to me
[1:55] and i was working how desperately that
[1:58] person would want to work with me
[2:00] so though i complain i'm working there's
[2:03] people that would gladly do your work
[2:06] because they don't have what you have
[2:07] and sometimes we get so
[2:10] sidetracked with what we do and how we
[2:12] busy and and
[2:13] how important we are in our stuff and we
[2:16] forget that these people
[2:18] that literally will give their legs and
[2:20] hands to do what we can do
[2:23] so we are we can always be thankful and
[2:25] we always can thank him for what he's
[2:27] done for us and do for us every day
[2:30] and so when we come here we really want
[2:32] to come and say lord
[2:33] i know i'm not perfect but you'll get me
[2:36] there
[2:37] you know you'll make me perfect so we'll
[2:40] just wait for everyone to come in and
[2:41] then we'll power in a word of prayer but
[2:44] yeah sometimes you think it goes really
[2:46] bad you know everything's just going bad
[2:48] and everything's wrong and then you
[2:50] walk past someone and they they're in a
[2:52] much better state than you
[2:53] or real worst state than you and you're
[2:55] looking at them and you go oh lord sorry
[2:57] i'm actually
[2:58] i'm really thankful for what i have and
[2:59] you keep walking on and you need those
[3:01] moments
[3:02] because it's god just humbling you again
[3:04] and saying hey you know
[3:06] we all have to walk so let's let's just
[3:08] always say thank you to him
[3:10] a thankful art god sees that and he
[3:13] loves it
[3:14] because he gives so much for us so if
[3:16] we're always thankful god will always
[3:18] give you
[3:19] but if we get the greedy and selfish and
[3:23] sidetracked he's gonna he's gonna bring
[3:25] a trial just to get your attention to
[3:27] get us back there right
[3:28] amen but brother james is preaching
[3:30] tonight not me i just thought i'd
[3:33] say that
[3:33] [Laughter]
[3:36] amen um so let's just bow our heads
[3:39] in a word of prayer and we welcome our
[3:41] lord in our
[3:43] gracious heavenly father father we are
[3:46] so insignificant lord things we do
[3:49] that's that's so of importance every day
[3:51] lord is
[3:52] is actually not that important lord but
[3:55] you
[3:55] are important and what you do in our
[3:57] lives are important to us lord and
[4:00] we just didn't stumble across this
[4:02] gospel lord but we believe
[4:04] by faith that you led us into this place
[4:06] lord
[4:07] where the vindicated prophet came down
[4:09] lord and he spoke to us
[4:11] lord and he said these are elias a call
[4:14] there is a king calling you and he wants
[4:17] a bride
[4:18] and if you could just humble yourself
[4:20] and you can just believe my word
[4:23] and believe the prophet i send and see
[4:25] the signs
[4:26] and just know that it is me that you
[4:28] will bring us into that rest
[4:30] father we don't have to worry about
[4:32] where we work and what we do and how
[4:34] good we are for how long enough we are
[4:36] lord but that we know
[4:38] that you are leading the way as the
[4:40] captain of the host lord a lot of
[4:42] battles has been fought lord and a lot
[4:44] of scars and
[4:45] and a lot of deep hurts maybe happen in
[4:48] our lives lord
[4:49] but you can heal all our diseases
[4:53] lord you can take away all our fears and
[4:56] you can give us
[4:57] all our peace and all our joy
[5:00] lord so we just come to you humbly
[5:01] tonight and say lord
[5:03] we have heard that eliezer call lord we
[5:06] have heard you call our name
[5:08] that was written on the lamb's book of
[5:10] life lord lord even before the
[5:12] foundation of the world lord you already
[5:14] knew
[5:14] we would be right here lord and and
[5:17] it's sometimes so hard to understand but
[5:19] we just want to come and say lord
[5:21] we believe we receive and we just hear
[5:25] lord because
[5:26] nobody else lord has the words of
[5:28] eternal life but you
[5:30] so lord please may you speak may you
[5:32] speak to our hearts tonight and may you

[20:45] christ only
[20:54] in me
[21:14] okay
[21:19] cool
[21:26] god be sure this evening it's great to
[21:28] be in the house of the lord and it's
[21:29] great to be in this presence and
[21:32] i really enjoyed the songs amen
[21:36] i just had a little thought tonight and
[21:40] brother ben had asked me to preach for a
[21:41] prayer meeting i didn't really know what
[21:43] to
[21:44] if we were having one like we normally
[21:45] do or he said what do you want us
[21:47] i like this you know i like sitting in
[21:49] the circle and
[21:50] but i hadn't really prepared my message
[21:52] message that way so
[21:54] i'm still going to read from my notes a
[21:55] little bit but i really feel the lord's
[21:59] given me a thought for tonight and just
[22:02] as a as a minister you know there's just
[22:04] when you when you just things happen
[22:06] around you and something pops up and you
[22:08] go man i just know the lord's
[22:09] in that channel and just brother a man
[22:11] sharing before and i thought you know
[22:13] lord wants to talk to he wants to talk
[22:15] to me that maybe he wants to talk to you
[22:17] as well just in a simple thought
[22:20] so have you got your bibles this evening
[22:22] i want to read from hebrews 12.
[22:29] hebrews 12 we're gonna read five to
[22:38] seventeen
[22:40] i've titled the sermon tonight i'll
[22:43] speak more about it soon but i've titled
[22:45] this message behind the scenes
[22:50] behind the scenes
[22:53] hebrews 12 5
[22:57] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[22:59] which speaketh unto you
[23:01] as unto children my son despise not thou
[23:04] the chastening of the lord nor faint
[23:06] when thou rebuked of him
[23:08] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[23:10] and scourgeth every son whom he
[23:12] receiveth
[23:13] if you enjoy chastening god dealeth with
[23:16] you as sons
[23:18] for what son is he whom the father
[23:19] chasteneth not
[23:21] but if you be without chastisement
[23:23] wherefore all
[23:24] are partakers than your bosses but not
[23:27] sons
[23:28] furthermore we have had we have had
[23:30] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[23:32] and we gave them reverence
[23:34] shall we not much rather be in
[23:36] subjection unto the father of spirits
[23:38] and live
[23:39] for verily for a few days chastised us
[23:42] after their own pleasure but he for our
[23:45] prophet that we
[23:46] might be partakers of his holiness
[23:50] now no chastening of the presence
[23:51] seemeth to be joyous but grievous
[23:53] nevertheless afterward that yieldeth the
[23:56] peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[23:58] them which
[23:58] exercise thereby therefore lift up the
[24:01] hands which hang down in the feeble
[24:03] knees and make strike the paths for your
[24:05] feet
[24:06] lest that which is lame be turned out
[24:08] that way but let it rather be healed
[24:11] follow peace with all men in holiness
[24:12] without which no man shall see the lord
[24:15] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[24:18] the grace of god
[24:19] bless any root of bitterness springing
[24:21] up trouble you and thereby many be
[24:23] defiled
[24:24] lest there be any fornicator or profane
[24:26] person as esau
[24:27] who for one morsel of meat sold is
[24:29] birthright for ye know how afterward
[24:32] when he would have inherited the
[24:33] blessing he was rejected
[24:34] but he found no place of repentance
[24:37] though he sought it carefully with tears
[24:40] and you know sometimes when you are
[24:42] getting chastised it's easy to get
[24:45] really upset and you know but the lord's
[24:48] trying to deal with us and
[24:50] and there is a danger there where you
[24:53] know
[24:53] laissez saw it he he gave and he gave up
[24:55] his birthright just for a more solid
[24:57] bread
[24:57] and i was just thinking that just a
[24:59] quick thought so one more scripture
[25:00] there i want to read
[25:02] remember that time brother branham was
[25:05] he was in the service and the lord was
[25:06] dealing with a girl
[25:08] and she was rebuking him she was hating
[25:11] him for rebuking
[25:12] the way that she was dressing and she
[25:15] didn't repent of her sins that night and
[25:17] later on
[25:18] she said brother branham seen her and
[25:20] and she said ever since then
[25:22] i've just gone so cold i've just she
[25:24] said i could watch my mother burn in
[25:26] hell and it wouldn't worry me at all
[25:27] because she had
[25:28] turned down even though the lord was
[25:30] dealing with her
[25:32] something going on behind the scenes and
[25:35] i just want you to go back up to verse 1
[25:37] in the same chapter
[25:38] just read here we're forcing
[25:42] we also i can pass about with so great a
[25:44] cloud of witness
[25:46] let us lay aside every weight and the
[25:48] sin which thus so easily beset us and
[25:50] let us run with patience that race that
[25:52] is set before us
[25:54] looking unto jesus the author and
[25:56] finisher of our faith
[25:58] i mean let's just bow our heads heavenly
[26:01] father lord we just
[26:03] come to you humbly tonight lord and
[26:05] father we know that you deal with us
[26:07] lord in ways that you can get through
[26:09] and speak to us father
[26:10] lord i just pray that you just sensitize
[26:12] our ears to your word tonight lord and
[26:14] just help us just to speak
[26:16] in faith father we love you and thank
[26:18] you and commit our way to you in jesus
[26:20] name
[26:20] amen amen can take seats
[26:29] you know sometimes walking as a
[26:32] christian can be hard
[26:34] you know i think andy had said it about
[26:35] his friend that he had been
[26:37] been talking talking to and getting
[26:39] baptized you know it's like
[26:41] you would think oh now my travels are
[26:43] going to end but you know you come to
[26:44] find all your troubles
[26:46] begin you know or because the pressure
[26:48] comes on you know the devil doesn't
[26:50] want you to be free he doesn't want you
[26:52] in that freedom
[26:54] and you know and then there's days where
[26:56] you've committed your life to the lord
[26:57] and then
[26:58] but you just don't even feel like a
[26:59] christian you know it's just
[27:01] you feel like man i'm just not good
[27:02] enough but but everyone goes through it
[27:04] it's like these cycles that you go
[27:06] through
[27:07] and and everyone does go through it and
[27:10] sometimes it just seems like
[27:11] everything's falling apart you know
[27:13] just everything goes wrong man you're
[27:14] like why did this happen to me like why
[27:17] didn't it happen it always happens to me
[27:18] and it just seems like
[27:20] well just one thing after another or two
[27:22] things have happened now
[27:23] where's the third you know like it's
[27:24] coming
[27:28] and i remember we had that once they
[27:29] were like oh what's the next thing
[27:30] that's going to go wrong and it's like
[27:31] the fridge blow up or
[27:33] fragile washing machine or something
[27:35] appear to be right
[27:38] and and but to our thinking right to our
[27:41] carnival thinking like man that's
[27:42] just unfair it's just unfair but you
[27:45] know it's not
[27:46] that's just our way of seeing it it's
[27:48] unfair
[27:49] we're like why did god do that why why
[27:51] would if he loves
[27:52] his children why would he do that
[27:56] why would he take my loved one you know
[27:58] these questions that we would
[28:01] but we have to continue to look to jesus
[28:03] because jesus because he's the author
[28:05] but he's also the finisher
[28:08] and if we can just look to that promise
[28:10] you know we can see a little bit deeper
[28:12] than what we're just seeing
[28:13] in front of us there's always something
[28:15] deeper going on
[28:16] because when we use these senses that
[28:18] you know there's different dimensions
[28:20] around us and i think the first three
[28:22] dimensions were light
[28:24] matter and time that elements that make
[28:26] up the world around us
[28:28] but then we know that brother branham
[28:29] talked about there being a fourth
[28:31] dimension
[28:32] and those radio waves that travel
[28:34] through here and so right now
[28:35] there's images that are traveling
[28:37] through and this this these scenes
[28:39] and maybe some of those scenes are a
[28:42] really evil
[28:43] really horrible things that would just
[28:44] be flowing through here but you can't
[28:46] see them but they're here they're radio
[28:48] waves because your
[28:49] phone right now has the capability of
[28:53] picking up that image and displaying
[28:54] something totally evil in front of you
[28:56] so those pictures are traveling through
[28:58] but you can't see them they're behind
[28:59] the scenes of what these sensors are
[29:01] picking up
[29:08] but you have to have a receiver you know
[29:10] as soon as you've got that receiver you
[29:12] can pick that up
[29:13] and turn it into an image amen
[29:18] it's the same with sounds you know
[29:20] though when you speak
[29:22] your voice goes out and it travels on a
[29:24] wave
[29:25] and that it doesn't stop it just keeps
[29:27] traveling and traveling and traveling
[29:29] and things that were spoken years and
[29:30] years ago that that's still traveling
[29:32] though it might be so minute we might
[29:34] not ever have a measurement to read that
[29:36] but it's still there it's still
[29:37] traveling
[29:39] and it can be like in your christian
[29:41] walk though you don't see
[29:43] these things that are there you don't
[29:45] see these natural things but there's
[29:47] things going on behind the scenes of
[29:49] your life that sometimes you don't
[29:50] see and it's unfair why would god do
[29:53] this
[29:54] but they're happening for a reason to
[29:56] bring you up to a place in christ
[30:00] so god's saying why let your hands hang
[30:03] down just because this is happening
[30:04] you've got you've got an attitude you
[30:06] can take to this trial you face don't
[30:08] let your hands hang down you might end
[30:09] up staying that way
[30:12] and so a few weeks ago i was with
[30:15] brother isaac as he was filming this
[30:16] short film
[30:18] and i was just going behind following
[30:20] and filming these things for behind the
[30:22] scenes
[30:23] and as whenever i do something i doesn't
[30:25] matter what it is if it's
[30:26] filming behind the scenes or it's going
[30:29] and doing something else i always say
[30:30] lord what's the
[30:31] what can i take out of this experience
[30:34] what lesson can you show me out of this
[30:36] experience
[30:37] and as i was sitting there i was like
[30:39] man there's so much going on right now
[30:41] that
[30:41] like i actually didn't really know what
[30:44] happened you know you
[30:46] you don't see what it takes to make that
[30:48] film
[30:49] and maybe you don't see what it's taken
[30:51] to make brother impo
[30:52] the way that he is the character that he
[30:54] has you see brother impo
[30:56] and you see the way as your man he's a
[30:58] lovely brother but you don't see
[31:00] the things that he's been through to get
[31:02] him to that position
[31:05] and so as i started thinking about this
[31:07] film i thought
[31:09] you know before there could even be a
[31:12] film right
[31:13] they had to be a director with a script
[31:15] before any of the actors knew anything
[31:17] about the movie
[31:18] or anything about the script there had
[31:20] to be a director that had a plan
[31:22] and wrote it out it's going to be this
[31:23] way because i've got a vision up this is
[31:25] what i want to see at the end
[31:27] and just imagine god he wanted to see
[31:29] this bride spotless and white right
[31:31] and so he had this plan now i've got to
[31:33] write a script so that at the end it all
[31:35] comes out to look like this
[31:38] god had a script for us and so now he
[31:41] puts everything in place
[31:44] so that he can bring that script to a
[31:45] reality at the end right
[31:49] and i was thinking as i looked around
[31:50] you know when people watch this movie
[31:52] they're gonna have no idea
[31:54] the battle that that guy that was
[31:55] recording the sound the whole day had
[31:58] with a great big stream raging behind
[32:01] you know and he's trying to deal with
[32:03] that and us i think i said to him how
[32:05] are you going to
[32:06] deal with the noise in this in this
[32:08] stream you know and he was explaining
[32:10] that but i thought the people
[32:11] don't realize that you know they don't
[32:13] see that they're like man the sound this
[32:14] is incredible
[32:15] but they don't see what it took to get
[32:17] that
[32:18] and as things started to go on you know
[32:21] i was looking
[32:22] watching the sound going the next minute
[32:23] you'd hear this quad bike start up on
[32:25] the neighbor's property
[32:26] and you can hold man that must be so
[32:28] frustrating hey isaac's just got
[32:30] action and i hear this driving up the
[32:32] thing
[32:33] everyone's like all right wait wait it's
[32:36] like okay then he goes faster like
[32:38] action and then i go oh no here's andy
[32:40] starting up the car oh
[32:43] the driveway you know you don't see that
[32:47] i was thinking about i was watching the
[32:49] the lighting team you know because you
[32:51] just see oh man that
[32:52] person's face is just glowing you know
[32:55] it's just glowing but
[32:56] you don't what you don't see is there's
[32:57] a guy holding a shade up over here and
[32:59] he's going like this and
[33:01] we're like you know we need to put some
[33:03] light over here and reflect that on the
[33:05] face you know
[33:06] i didn't even really think about these
[33:07] things before i had seen this happen you
[33:09] know
[33:10] maybe i sort of knew that that did take
[33:12] place but i don't see it as sort of
[33:14] beyond what i seem to see that end
[33:16] result
[33:18] and you know sometimes the sun just had
[33:21] to shine in the right place
[33:23] the sunlight had to be right on the
[33:25] right place of someone to get them to
[33:27] glow that way and it can be like that
[33:28] with the lord you know
[33:29] the sunlight's got to be just in the
[33:31] right place for you to have this glow
[33:33] you know that people can see
[33:38] i thought you know the other thing that
[33:40] i really thought is
[33:41] man you don't see the amount of effort
[33:43] that it takes for this assistant
[33:45] director which is
[33:46] sister shannon to go around and actually
[33:49] make
[33:49] things happen because you know all the
[33:51] directors thinking i want this shot you
[33:53] know i've got to get this shot we've got
[33:54] to be down here in line let's not quite
[33:56] get it there and it's just the
[33:58] director's going hold on we've got a
[33:59] plan you know we've actually got us
[34:01] gotta make this happen you know and so
[34:03] she's going around making things happen
[34:05] and i kind of thought you know it's a
[34:07] bit like the holy spirit really because
[34:09] god's directed this great plan he's got
[34:11] the script
[34:13] and he has the vision at the end but now
[34:15] things have to start to happen so he
[34:17] himself come
[34:18] down in his holy spirit right and begins
[34:20] to start
[34:21] moving and and this has got to happen
[34:23] here and this has got to happen and
[34:24] maybe you don't even realize it maybe he
[34:26] saved your life many times and you
[34:28] didn't even know but he had to bring
[34:30] up to this finished position
[34:34] and yeah i mean this is just this is
[34:37] incredible lord i really can see
[34:39] how you deal with your bride
[34:45] you know and i have found over the years
[34:48] it's a great blessing when you can get
[34:50] to a position
[34:51] in your christian walk where you can
[34:53] start to hear his voice
[34:56] when you can say lord why are you doing
[34:58] this and he just speaks softly to you
[35:00] and starts to lead you and say lord i
[35:02] can okay yes i hear that
[35:05] you know rather than just being in doubt
[35:06] all the time but you know it does take
[35:08] some like i've
[35:09] learned right you know there's times
[35:11] where i've had things happen and i've
[35:13] said that's the lord and it
[35:15] wasn't of the lord you know there's no
[35:16] point in trying to make an excuse for it
[35:18] but then there's times when he said
[35:20] stuff and it's like man that was of the
[35:22] lord and then so you begin to get
[35:24] sensitive to
[35:25] know what's what what's god speaking to
[35:27] me and what's my emotions speaking to me
[35:29] you know
[35:34] we're not maybe excuse the expression
[35:37] but we're not
[35:38] playing a game of poker in life right
[35:40] we're not just playing the odds
[35:42] like what's the chances of this happen
[35:43] when something happens in your life
[35:45] well there was a good chance that that
[35:46] might happen but that's not how god
[35:48] works
[35:49] you know he has a plan and when things
[35:51] start to happen
[35:52] you have to say lord why is why is this
[35:54] happening you know
[35:56] you're doing this for a reason and
[35:59] i i used to get road rage you know if
[36:02] maybe even in my mature years as a
[36:03] christian and you know someone was
[36:05] slowing me down you're driving her if i
[36:07] just want to get home and now someone
[36:08] gets in front of you and they just go
[36:10] like
[36:10] 40 and a 50 or something like man it's
[36:12] 50k through here you can do 59
[36:15] you know and just start getting really
[36:18] frustrated you know and
[36:22] but now i i go lord you know like
[36:26] actually maybe you're slowing me down
[36:28] purposefully
[36:29] because if i was two minutes ahead in my
[36:32] journey i would have
[36:33] been t-boned at an intersection or you
[36:36] just you just don't know
[36:38] so now even though sometimes i like get
[36:41] up there and like
[36:42] and then i go yes lord back off a little
[36:45] bit you know
[36:46] and slow down but he does that and
[36:49] embarrassing enough as it is to say but
[36:50] there's been
[36:51] that many times when i've been driving
[36:53] maybe going a little bit too fast
[36:55] and someone's pulled out in front of me
[36:57] and i've had to slow down a little bit
[36:59] and then you go past the speed camera
[37:00] van or something come in like the
[37:02] foolishness and then but
[37:04] the lord has everything in control you
[37:07] know
[37:07] there are times where he just lets us
[37:09] get burnt because we needed to get burnt
[37:11] you know
[37:12] praise god just the same right
[37:17] amen but when the pressure comes on you
[37:20] know the devil starts to preach to you
[37:23] you know the devil's a preacher too just
[37:25] as the minister deals with you
[37:27] the devil starts to preach with you in
[37:29] those trials and things come
[37:30] but you just have to say no devil boo
[37:33] devil
[37:34] the lord's showing me something the
[37:35] lord's gonna do something here
[37:38] just don't listen to the devil you know
[37:39] though it seems like oh hell's coming
[37:41] against you
[37:42] and everyone hates you and your friends
[37:44] leave just get out devil i'm just gonna
[37:46] keep trusting god i'm just gonna keep
[37:48] walking with god
[37:49] because that's what it takes and don't
[37:51] get mad if
[37:52] mad at god if he doesn't give you an
[37:54] answer while you're in the trial
[37:57] but he's the finisher of your faith so
[37:59] if he's planted
[38:01] a seed in you then he will bring that
[38:03] seed up to harvest
[38:05] it's just the law of how he's created
[38:08] this universe
[38:10] but the best way to let that seed grow
[38:12] is to let it see the sunlight you know
[38:14] that seed can't see sunlight it doesn't
[38:16] grow
[38:17] so when you start getting beaten down
[38:20] you know beating down into the ground
[38:22] and you just go man i just so hard to
[38:24] get out of this rut
[38:25] but as soon as it can just look towards
[38:28] that sun it can begin to grow
[38:30] but as long as the dark clouds are
[38:32] hanging over it you know
[38:34] they just can't grow
[38:38] i was thinking about a story when the
[38:40] lord was just
[38:41] dealing me with this and that brother
[38:44] branham had talked about him rather than
[38:46] me trying to paraphrase it i just wanted
[38:48] to
[38:48] to read it from how he had written it
[38:51] and so it's a bit of a reading but
[38:53] i really enjoy this the story just the
[38:56] lesson that it is in it
[38:58] and it's in well he preached talks about
[39:00] it in a couple places but in 1963
[39:03] god doesn't call a man to judgment
[39:05] without first warning him
[39:08] and one day i come home about four years
[39:11] ago five something like that
[39:13] and this young girl which was eight
[39:14] years old when she was in the cradle
[39:16] role
[39:16] i don't quite know what that means how
[39:18] he sees that but
[39:20] she had been married and had two
[39:21] children and she was laying in the
[39:23] hospital out here at the point of death
[39:26] she was about four months five for the
[39:28] baby and the baby had died and they
[39:30] couldn't operate because she had uremit
[39:32] and they couldn't operate so i had to
[39:34] let the mother die
[39:36] so he can't operate you see the baby
[39:37] would kill her like that so they had to
[39:39] she was just dying that's all it was
[39:41] wasn't no chance for her and i went to
[39:44] see her
[39:45] she had sent for me and i went to the
[39:47] hospital and there
[39:48] she was under the oxygen tent and i
[39:50] raised up the little flat
[39:52] i talked to her a little bit and i said
[39:54] you remember me
[39:56] she said sure brother bill i remember
[39:58] you i said
[39:59] how was it do you understand how sick
[40:01] you are she said i do
[40:03] see that's why i sent for you i said
[40:06] well
[40:06] how was it with you and the lord she
[40:09] said brother bill
[40:10] i'm not ready to go well we got down and
[40:13] prayed
[40:14] and her mother and husband and many of
[40:16] them in the room and her mother and
[40:18] husband
[40:19] started crying and then i asked her and
[40:22] she got right with god
[40:23] paid her vows and come back and made the
[40:25] promise
[40:26] as if and have she been forgiven
[40:30] how she loved him how sorry for her sins
[40:34] the way she had lived and went on with
[40:36] repentance and crying
[40:38] after a while i got up and went out of
[40:40] the building
[40:41] and the next morning they called me up
[40:43] to come back out there and
[40:45] come to find out that they come
[40:48] in that morning for a test to see how
[40:50] the uremic condition had advanced
[40:53] and found out she didn't have a speck of
[40:54] it it was all gone
[40:56] every bit of the uremic poisoning had
[40:58] left it
[40:59] the doctors were so excited till they
[41:01] said my why
[41:02] this we ought that something very
[41:04] strange
[41:05] said will get already and said have it
[41:08] still that way in the morning
[41:09] said we'll keep giving her the
[41:11] penicillin or whatever
[41:12] they was giving her keeping the
[41:14] infections down said we'll operate
[41:16] and take the dead baby out before it sit
[41:18] in something else
[41:21] if she's all right then well
[41:24] two or three times that day they tested
[41:26] her again
[41:27] and that night late they tested her
[41:29] nothing wrong perfectly all right
[41:31] they prepped her took her out from under
[41:33] the oxygen teen everything was fine
[41:35] they was going to operate on her the
[41:36] next morning and take the baby
[41:38] well i went out there and because that
[41:41] this was done i never knew it
[41:43] i never knew the lord told me nothing
[41:45] about it you could ask the people if you
[41:47] wish
[41:48] so they she so that he never
[41:52] he never said he would do it but oh my
[41:54] to see such a thing
[41:55] her husband being a sinner come over
[41:57] said brother branham
[41:58] i want to give my life to the lord jesus
[42:01] i said all right just kneel down here
[42:03] and take hold of your wife's hand
[42:05] and then you walk the straight life
[42:07] together
[42:09] the mother come back she said brother
[42:10] branham you know here's me and my
[42:12] children

[42:15] and out and around the tabernacle and
[42:16] things

[42:19] we'll go up to the older and come back
[42:21] said i'm backslid too brother brennan
[42:23] she said i want to come back to the lord
[42:25] jesus for his goodness to my child
[42:27] well you see that's very nice but you
[42:29] don't come to the lord jesus because of
[42:31] that
[42:33] along towards midnight 12 o'clock her
[42:35] mother dozed off to sleep
[42:37] and she said called her
[42:40] mother said mother and she said yes

[42:59] i know you
[43:00] are she said yes yes sweetheart sid

[43:12] and the little children and be
[43:14] a christian and live for god she said
[43:16] mother i mean i'm going to my heavenly
[43:18] home

[43:21] journey said

[43:25] oh she said now what's the matter
[43:27] so this is the end of the journey said
[43:29] yes mother within a few minutes i'll be
[43:31] gone

[43:35] condition in derelict so she called the
[43:37] nurse the nurse taped
[43:39] taken her respiration everything was
[43:40] normal and within five minutes she was
[43:43] gone
[43:44] she was dead and when i come home
[43:47] in a week or two after that i think
[43:48] brother graham preached the girl's
[43:50] funeral
[43:51] and i come back and media told me that
[43:53] the girl had died that night i couldn't
[43:55] couldn't believe i went to see the
[43:57] mother yeah
[43:59] yeah and i don't know what caused me to
[44:02] do it
[44:02] but i said lord god you owe me an
[44:05] understanding
[44:07] see after me going out there and telling
[44:09] that husband
[44:10] and him coming to the lord you've done
[44:12] all these things for him and all like
[44:13] that and then take this girl's life like
[44:15] that
[44:16] i said you owe me an understanding when
[44:19] you tell god something like that he'll
[44:20] leave you sitting alone
[44:23] he don't owe me nothing i'm in debt to
[44:25] him
[44:26] well he just let me port it out for a
[44:28] few days you know
[44:30] and after about three or four months one
[44:32] day and i was down
[44:34] on the creek bank the lord spoke to me
[44:36] in a vision and said
[44:38] now go to her mother and say this to her
[44:40] mother
[44:41] did not her time come the year before
[44:43] that she was drowning in a creek on a
[44:44] picnic
[44:45] she should have went at that time but i
[44:48] had to take her when she was ready
[44:50] to go and that's why all this happened
[44:52] and why you went out there
[44:54] then i got down and cried i said lord
[44:56] jesus forgive me your poor stupid
[44:58] servant i should have never said that
[45:00] lord
[45:01] and i had went back down to that lady
[45:03] she lived over here
[45:04] market street and i went over to her and
[45:06] said i want to ask you a question
[45:08] she said sure brother bill i said is it
[45:11] true
[45:11] this girl almost drowned she said that's
[45:14] right brother branham
[45:15] said her husband and they had to get her
[45:17] out of the creek
[45:19] they had to use artificial respiration
[45:21] and put her
[45:22] put on pressure and they had to get a
[45:25] machine and pump the water out of her
[45:27] said she had a skirt on they were having
[45:29] a picnic
[45:30] she was out there and stepped in some
[45:32] mud slipped over and
[45:33] in her head and strangled in the water
[45:36] they didn't notice her and
[45:38] directly they seen her coming up and
[45:40] going down and they run
[45:42] in and got her and brought her out said
[45:44] she almost died
[45:46] she said i said that was her time to go
[45:50] see god knows what god knows what he's
[45:53] doing
[45:55] now the lord probably would have told me
[45:56] that if i hadn't have taken the attitude
[45:59] that i did so something's happening if
[46:02] he hadn't have taken the attitude the
[46:03] lord probably would have told him
[46:05] he took the wrong attitude towards
[46:07] something that was happening behind the
[46:08] scenes
[46:11] lord you owe me to tell me about it he
[46:13] don't owe you nothing
[46:15] i stood in a meeting one night and heard
[46:17] an evangelist praying for a sick person
[46:20] said god i command you to heal this
[46:22] person
[46:23] who command god see it isn't even
[46:26] intelligent because god
[46:28] he does what he wants to do can
[46:32] the clay say to the potter why did you
[46:34] make me this
[46:35] see certainly not but the prophet if the
[46:38] prophet will keep so
[46:40] still then seek the lord for an answer
[46:42] then there's an answer there see
[46:44] the reason i said this is because when i
[46:47] hear this i think about the attitude
[46:50] it's the attitude lord you owe me and
[46:52] you know sometimes maybe you haven't but
[46:54] sometimes i've been angry at the at god
[46:56] for the things that we've gone through
[46:58] and the attitude that you take towards
[47:01] that will
[47:02] determine the outcome i wasn't planning
[47:05] on saying this but
[47:07] when we first become christians it was
[47:09] hard you know like we
[47:11] didn't have any of the things we have
[47:13] now we were broke i went filed for no
[47:15] asset procedure bankruptcy basically and
[47:17] we got married you know
[47:19] so we started out with nothing and i had
[47:21] a bad job
[47:22] that sometimes i wouldn't even get paid
[47:24] for like two or three weeks as a boss
[47:27] didn't really have the money and so
[47:29] things were hard and
[47:30] there was a time a point that i come to
[47:33] where we were paying our ties
[47:35] and it was like i pay my tithes and i
[47:38] had no money for food
[47:39] and the only money we had would give us
[47:42] gas to get to church
[47:45] and and i was crying out like lord
[47:48] you why would you do this you know like
[47:50] the only money i can't even feed my wife
[47:53] i've just got married i'm paying my
[47:54] tithes
[47:55] and that money that 50 bucks or whatever
[47:58] it was then would have been the money we
[48:00] needed for food
[48:02] and the devil was preaching to me you
[48:03] know as i was saying before he starts
[48:05] preaching
[48:06] you know why would you want to serve a
[48:07] god like that anyway you know
[48:09] and i just said i i remember just saying
[48:13] no this is what the word of god says
[48:15] this is what i'm going to do and he just
[48:16] kept meeting the needs you know
[48:18] we had a friend there who will become a
[48:20] friend over time and
[48:22] that one night he'd come and just
[48:24] knocked on the door and he had
[48:25] bags full of groceries and he was near
[48:27] just as broke as us
[48:29] and he just said i just felt that god
[48:30] told me to come and give you this and
[48:32] just a few hours before we were praying
[48:34] lord we've got no food like we need to
[48:36] eat we've got no food and then
[48:38] some bags of food come and arrive on the
[48:40] door but i
[48:41] believe that was the attitude by saying
[48:43] i'm not going to let the devil preach
[48:45] the lord will have his way amen and it's
[48:48] attitude you can take
[48:49] it's going to have a great effect on the
[48:51] outcome maybe it won't come right away
[48:53] maybe you do all the right things and it
[48:54] won't come right away
[48:56] but when it does come you'll come out
[48:57] with such a character right
[49:00] amen will make you stronger
[49:05] and whenever you get a powerful
[49:07] testimony you can look back on it
[49:09] and you can see the lesson in it maybe
[49:11] you can help someone else to go through
[49:13] the trial that they're going through by
[49:14] the
[49:15] lessons that you learn and i believe
[49:18] we're coming so
[49:19] so close now to this end time so close
[49:22] to the lord just coming and then just
[49:25] taking us away you know this harvest
[49:27] and so he's got to get if we're going to
[49:29] step out of this body right
[49:31] and step into a glorified body man you
[49:34] just can't step out a dirty man and step
[49:36] in a clean man you know
[49:37] this character of this man has to change
[49:40] first
[49:40] till it's able to step in to that body
[49:46] amen i've heard the sound of it going
[49:49] you know like brother ben's been
[49:50] preaching that further sound over going
[49:52] and he's it's been rustling you know
[49:54] he's been rustling me
[49:56] so we can expect to be getting a
[49:58] transformer we can expect more trials
[50:01] because he's got to get this field right
[50:05] just need to look beyond that sense that
[50:07] we see and just say lord let me look
[50:09] beyond
[50:09] let me look beyond this trial i was
[50:12] thinking about um
[50:14] when the sirians were looking for elisha
[50:17] the prophet
[50:18] and he elisha had been revealing the
[50:22] king's thoughts in his bed chamber right
[50:24] the king would say we're going to go
[50:25] down and take the king of israel
[50:27] and elisha the prophet would see those
[50:30] words and he would tell the king of
[50:31] israel to move
[50:32] and so he said now the assyrian wanted
[50:35] to find elijah and in second kings
[50:37] 6 15. it said and when the servant of
[50:41] the man of god was risen early and gone
[50:43] forth
[50:44] behold a host can pass the city both of
[50:47] horses and chariots
[50:48] and a servant said unto him alas my
[50:50] master
[50:51] how shall we do and he answered fear not
[50:54] for they
[50:55] that be with us are more than they that
[50:58] be with them
[50:59] and elisha prayed and said lord i pray
[51:01] thee open his eyes that he may see
[51:04] and the lord opened the eyes of the
[51:06] young man and he saw and behold the
[51:07] mountain was full of horses and chariots
[51:10] and
[51:10] fire around about elisha yes
[51:13] you know it can be like that here
[51:16] tonight
[51:16] you know how old saying
[51:20] look what the cat dragged in you know
[51:22] and i don't want to say that any cats
[51:24] have walked in here but
[51:25] when this old grumpy man comes walking
[51:27] into church after a bad day you know
[51:30] there's things that we can drag with us
[51:31] you know because if we come with an
[51:33] attitude and you know
[51:34] that's there's spirits that follow that
[51:36] you know and they don't just go oh look
[51:38] it's church tonight we'll just
[51:39] wait out here till he comes out you know
[51:41] they come and sit down and while the
[51:43] preacher's saying man
[51:44] don't like his preaching you know all
[51:46] that sort of carry on
[51:48] but you know i just wonder if sometimes
[51:53] it could just
[51:54] if we could you know brother branham
[51:55] would go to a meeting and those places
[51:57] like not when he went to a church but
[51:58] we'd
[51:59] he'd go to an auditorium somewhere and
[52:02] places where other things happen and
[52:03] he'd walk in there and he could see
[52:04] spirits around and there were people
[52:06] that had gifts where they could see in
[52:07] the spiritual realm
[52:08] and they'd see spirits evil spirits
[52:10] around those places
[52:12] but i just wonder if we could open our
[52:14] eyes and see into that realm maybe
[52:16] there's
[52:17] you know a couple of evil spirits that
[52:18] would hang around but
[52:20] how much more host of angels that would
[52:23] be around
[52:23] you know there's a power that's far
[52:25] greater than any demon power amen
[52:28] amen so i i don't think we should let
[52:31] ourselves get beaten up
[52:32] you know lord i know you're here i know
[52:34] your spirits here
[52:35] in the scripture where
[52:39] where's that scripture at the start
[52:44] we're forcing we also i can pass about
[52:47] with such a greater cloud of witness
[52:49] you know we're compassed about there's
[52:51] people here that are carrying a spirit
[52:53] that can maybe help pray with you and
[52:54] break through something that's been
[52:56] afflicting you
[52:57] it's not like there's not a witness of
[52:58] the power of god amen
[53:00] right amen
[53:04] let's just look past this curtain of
[53:05] time you know look past what we're going
[53:07] through look past
[53:08] pain and hardship it's only for a good
[53:12] you know look past feeling alone we're
[53:15] not alone
[53:17] amen you know
[53:20] i want to have character no matter what
[53:22] it takes right we want to have character
[53:24] and i was saying a couple of the bros
[53:27] the other week maybe it's brother ben
[53:29] how we went to the supermarket and um
[53:31] you know with the covered regulations
[53:33] under level two and they've got a person
[53:34] standing at the door
[53:36] and they're letting they'll stand there
[53:38] and you'll be waiting in line and they
[53:40] look at you and they're like
[53:43] and let you in and you go oh you know
[53:48] you know like and it's just they've got
[53:51] this person off a checkout
[53:53] right and they've put them on door as
[53:56] security and put them in this position
[53:58] of authority
[53:59] to regulate who can come in and who can
[54:01] go out and this person's not trained
[54:03] to be in a position of authority they're
[54:05] just a checkout person you know
[54:07] and so now you take a person without the
[54:09] character
[54:10] to have without the training that it
[54:12] takes to have authority to operate that
[54:14] position
[54:15] and place in there and they get an
[54:16] attitude right they got a bad attitude
[54:18] because
[54:19] they've just been given this position of
[54:20] authority i was like i'm going to tell
[54:22] you what to do
[54:23] you're not allowed to come in here on
[54:25] how you can come in that's right
[54:27] you know as power without character you
[54:29] can see it in the natural realm
[54:32] amen i say help us lord because i want
[54:34] to have character genuine character
[54:36] imagine how powerful a church with
[54:38] genuine character can be amen
[54:42] amen
[54:47] i just got one more scripture i want to
[54:48] read
[54:51] well actually i just want to go back to
[54:53] part of that scripture that i read
[54:55] hebrews 12 verse 9
[54:58] and where it said furthermore we have
[55:01] had fathers of
[55:02] our flesh which corrected us right our
[55:04] parents they corrected us
[55:08] and we gave them reverence right so they
[55:10] smacked us and we still gave our fathers
[55:12] reverence
[55:13] shall we not much more rather be in
[55:15] subjection to the father of spirits and
[55:17] live
[55:18] you know how much more to him for they
[55:21] your parents for they verily for a few
[55:24] days chastised us
[55:26] after their own pleasure so your parent
[55:28] chastise you for their pleasure to get
[55:30] what they wanted
[55:31] but look how different god is this is a
[55:32] real father but he
[55:34] for our prophet i mean he for our
[55:37] prophet that we might be partakers of
[55:39] his holiness
[55:40] amen the trials we go through and are
[55:43] not for god's pleasure they're not for
[55:45] just because he wants to beat you down
[55:47] you know it's not
[55:48] therefore our prophet that we can be
[55:51] partakers of his holiness
[55:54] amen i just want to i had asked brother
[55:57] isaac if he could sing a song
[55:59] and brother amman and it's just a song
[56:02] that we're not when i'm feeling a bit
[56:04] beaten down by the devil
[56:05] it's a song i always put on usually on
[56:08] the way home from work
[56:09] and listen to and sister lutavo was
[56:11] playing it the other morning i was like
[56:13] man i really enjoy that song so just to
[56:15] be something different i asked
[56:16] the guys if they can sing this before
[56:19] i'll probably turn it over to brother ed
[56:21] to
[56:21] read out the prayer requests we've had
[56:23] and we pray
[56:25] so if we can sing the harvest
[56:50] [Music]
