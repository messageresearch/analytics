[44:27] just go to um Romans chapter
[44:31] 1 and then we'll go to Hebrews chap 12
[44:47] again Romans
[44:48] 1:18 and then we're going to go to um
[44:51] Isaiah 59 so all of this may seem a bit
[44:53] of a contrast but I just want to um
[44:57] just lay out a few things I want to take
[44:59] a part three of let us run and I want to
[45:01] take a if I can take a subject about
[45:03] looking unto Jesus I we'll see here what
[45:05] man has done and I'll show you let's
[45:07] just read here Romans 1 and from Verse
[45:09] 18 it says for the wrath of God is
[45:12] revealed from Heaven against all
[45:14] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[45:17] who hold the truth in unrighteousness
[45:19] because that which may be known of God
[45:22] is Manifest in them for God hath showed
[45:25] it unto them for the invisible things of
[45:27] him from the creation of the world are
[45:29] clearly seen being understood by the
[45:31] things that are made even his eternal
[45:34] power and godhead so that they are
[45:37] without excuse because that which when
[45:40] they knew God they glorified him not as
[45:43] God neither were they thankful and
[45:45] became vain in their imaginations and
[45:48] their foolish Hearts was darkened
[45:51] professing themselves to be wise they
[45:53] became fools and changed the glory of
[45:56] the incorrupt able God into an image
[45:59] made like to corruptible man and to
[46:01] birds and forf footed beasts and
[46:03] creeping things whereof God also gave
[46:06] them up to uncleanness through the lust
[46:09] of their own Hearts to dishonor their
[46:11] own bodies between themselves who
[46:13] changed the truth of God into a lie and
[46:15] worshiped and served the creature more
[46:18] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[46:20] amen for this cause God gave them up
[46:23] unto vile affections for even their
[46:25] woman did change the natural natural use
[46:27] and that which is against nature and
[46:30] likewise also the men leaving the
[46:32] natural use of the woman burned in their
[46:34] and their lust one towards another men
[46:36] with men working that which is unseemly
[46:39] and receiving in themselves that
[46:41] recompense of their error which was met
[46:43] and even as they did not like to retain
[46:46] God in their knowledge God gave them
[46:48] over to a reprobate mind to do things
[46:50] which are not convenient being filled
[46:53] with all unrighteousness fornication
[46:55] wickedness covetousness deliciousness
[46:58] full of Envy murder debate deceit uh
[47:00] malignancy Whisperers backbiters haters
[47:02] of God despiteful proud boasters
[47:06] inventors of evil things disobedient to
[47:08] Parents Without understanding Covenant
[47:11] Breakers without natural affection
[47:13] implacable unmerciful who knowing the
[47:16] Judgment of God that they which commit
[47:19] such things are worthy of death not only
[47:22] do the same but have pleasure in them
[47:25] that do them amen and let's just go to
[47:28] um Hebrews
[47:30] 12 I know that was quite a mouthful but
[47:33] we're going to break it down um a bit by
[47:35] the Lord's
[47:39] help Hebrews
[47:44] 12:1 it says
[47:46] wherefore seeing we see we also are en
[47:50] ENC compassed about with so great a
[47:53] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[47:55] every weight and the sin that does so
[47:57] easily beset us let us run with patience
[48:01] the race that is set before us looking
[48:03] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[48:04] our faith who for the joy that was set
[48:07] before him endured the cross despising
[48:09] the shame and is sat down at the right
[48:11] hand of the Throne of God Amen and then
[48:14] let's just go to Isaiah 59
[48:16] just I'm sorry to keep you standing so
[48:18] long but we just go to Isaiah
[48:20] 59 and we'll go to verse 19 and then
[48:23] we're going to read into Isaiah 60 as
[48:26] well and I I'm sure this is familiar
[48:28] to um to us
[48:30] all so Isaiah 59 and
[48:36] 19 it says so shall they fear the name
[48:41] of the Lord from the West and his glory
[48:43] from the rising of the sun when the
[48:45] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[48:47] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[48:48] standard against him and the Redeemer
[48:50] shall come to Zion and unto them that
[48:52] turn from transgression in Jacob sayith
[48:54] the Lord as for me this is my Covenant
[48:56] with them sayith the Lord my spirit that
[48:58] is upon thee and my words which I have
[49:01] put in thy mouth shall not depart out of
[49:03] thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy
[49:05] seed out of the mouth of thy seed seed
[49:08] sayith the Lord from henceforth and
[49:09] forever arise Shine for thy light has
[49:12] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[49:14] upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall
[49:16] cover the Earth and gross Darkness the
[49:18] people but the Lord shall arise upon
[49:20] thee and His glory shall be seen upon
[49:22] thee and Gentiles shall come to thy
[49:24] light and Kings to the brightness of thy
[49:27] Rising amen may the Lord bless his word
[49:29] you may have your
[49:32] seats so we read quite a a contrasting
[49:37] group of scripture there where in Romans
[49:39] chapter 1 we read that they that there
[49:42] was a people at one stage they knew God
[49:44] God was revealed to them they were not
[49:48] and and they knew exactly who God was
[49:50] but then they changed because they did
[49:53] not retain God and their knowledge in
[49:56] their you know in their mind who he was
[49:59] then they change what they worshiping
[50:01] from who he was as a person to the
[50:04] creation am mean so they fashioned
[50:07] something that substituted God to be you
[50:10] know from from God who he really was to
[50:13] another God right and so this scripture
[50:18] is is actually quite incredible because
[50:20] many times we you know we have read
[50:22] Romans 1 and no doubt when you've read
[50:24] it you think maybe of Before the Flood
[50:26] where God walked with Adam and Eve and
[50:28] then God you know revealed his Plan of
[50:31] Redemption but then it didn't take very
[50:32] long for man to walk from from from Eden
[50:36] till finally God was grieved in his
[50:38] heart that he made man and he wanted to
[50:39] wipe out the whole whole uh creation
[50:43] because they turned themselves they they
[50:45] fashion Idols out of what they saw upon
[50:47] the Earth and they did not retain who
[50:50] God was in them in their in their
[50:53] minds right and so now
[50:56] these people that Paul is speaking about
[51:00] is actually not just back there but is
[51:02] today there's a people there this
[51:04] scripture has been fulfilled in our
[51:07] generation right because you can take or
[51:11] even you go back in Jesus's day you know
[51:13] you read Here Comes Here Comes you know
[51:16] John writes that we've beheld eternal
[51:19] life we've we we're actually taken hold
[51:23] of it first John 1 you know the eternal
[51:24] life that was with the bosom you know
[51:26] the bosom of the father we have beheld
[51:29] amen and then so here was a group of
[51:31] people that actually saw God as the as
[51:33] he was because Jesus was the image of
[51:35] the invisible God so everything Jesus is
[51:38] amen is who God was the invisible one so
[51:41] he became known in Jesus Christ right so
[51:44] everything he liked you saw it in Jesus
[51:46] everything he despised you saw it in
[51:48] Jesus how he treated the sick how he
[51:51] treated the Lost how he treated the
[51:53] demon possessed how he treated the
[51:55] religious people
[51:57] amen whoever it was the proud how he
[51:59] treated them the humble and lonely how
[52:01] he treated them amen the SOP phenician
[52:03] woman came to him Gentile came to him
[52:06] you know she had a daughter that was
[52:08] grievously vexed by a devil and then so
[52:11] you know and and she tried to approach
[52:13] him the wrong way son of David have
[52:15] mercy on me but to her he wasn't he
[52:17] wasn't son of David because that's to
[52:19] the Jews but he said oh Lord have mercy
[52:21] and then and then but then Jesus said to
[52:23] her you know said it's not meat to give
[52:27] the you know the bread to the dogs and
[52:30] then that word dog means someone of
[52:32] impure mind and she didn't actually she
[52:35] just said yeah but the crumbs fall under
[52:36] the table and the dog still get it and
[52:39] and she marveled at he marveled at her
[52:41] faith and she received because she came
[52:43] in humility right she came in humility
[52:45] Lord help me help my need she didn't
[52:48] think she was anything and she received
[52:50] what she needed amen but the scribes and
[52:53] Pharisees the proud and the Arrogant
[52:54] ones who had taken
[52:57] who had taken the you know Moses and his
[53:00] word and corrupted
[53:02] it what did he do you bunch of wi of
[53:05] walls you know woe unto you pronounced
[53:07] you know those woes in Matthew 23 and
[53:10] it's interesting because history in my
[53:13] Bible tells me that when when Israel was
[53:16] taken from from the promised land they
[53:19] went with they went with the Torah
[53:21] that's all they had they went into
[53:23] Babylon and then they came out of
[53:25] Babylon and they had the scribes and the
[53:28] Pharisees they had all the ritical ideas
[53:32] they had the synagogue so going into
[53:34] babon being being sent into Babylon God
[53:37] sent them there but they brought all the
[53:39] stuff that was not in the word
[53:41] originally amen and so now friends we
[53:44] have been called out of Darkness we have
[53:46] been called out of a spiritual Babylon
[53:49] it doesn't matter if you living if
[53:50] you're an atheist or you're in a church
[53:53] God had to call you out am mean God had
[53:56] to speak his word and you heard his word
[53:58] and something said I'll Follow You Lord
[54:01] wherever you're leading me and so he so
[54:03] so he's called us out but then the
[54:05] challeng is now that Babylon or what we'
[54:08] have once believed has to be taken away
[54:10] amen because we don't want a fashion and
[54:13] and I'll show you with we're going to do
[54:14] a quick study through bethl bethl
[54:17] started maybe maybe we'll just go there
[54:20] now let's go
[54:22] to no actually yeah let's go to Genesis
[54:26] chap 28 and then we're going to jump
[54:27] back to Romans 1 but bethl bethl started
[54:32] as an incredible
[54:34] place and this is the story if we go to
[54:36] Genesis
[54:38] 28:13 we read here that
[54:42] Jacob had an incredible visitation at
[54:50] bethl now this might you know this may
[54:53] seem a bit heavy to begin with but then
[54:54] it's going to turn Okay so just just
[54:56] just bear with me right so now bethl it
[55:00] says here we you we'll read from verse
[55:02] 13 and behold the Lord stood above it so
[55:05] this is when he has the dream and he no
[55:06] let's go to verse 12 sorry and he
[55:08] dreamed and behold a lad was set on the
[55:11] earth and the toet reached to heaven and
[55:13] behold the angels of God ascending and
[55:15] descending on it and behold the Lord
[55:17] stood above it and said I am the Lord
[55:20] God of Abraham thy father and the god of
[55:23] a um Isaac a land on thou liest to to
[55:26] thee will I give it and to thy seed and
[55:28] thy seed shall be as the dust of the
[55:30] earth and thou shal uh spread abroad to
[55:33] the west and to the East and to the
[55:34] north and to the South and in thee and
[55:36] in thy seed shall all the families of
[55:38] the earth be blessed and I behold that I
[55:40] am with thee and will keep thee in all
[55:42] in all places where thou goest and I'll
[55:44] bring thee again into this land for I
[55:46] will not leave thee until I have done
[55:48] that which I have spoken to thee of and
[55:52] Jacob waked out of his sleep and he said
[55:55] surely the Lord is in the place I knew
[55:56] it not and he was afraid and said how
[55:59] Dreadful is this place this is none
[56:02] other but the house of God and this is
[56:05] the Gate of Heaven so here he was he has
[56:07] this incredible visitation he says this
[56:09] is a dreadful place this isn't an
[56:11] incredible place this is a dreadful
[56:13] place he didn't know it was the Gate of
[56:15] Heaven right he didn't know that this
[56:18] would happen when he laid his head down
[56:19] that night upon that stone he didn't
[56:21] realize this was going to you know he
[56:24] didn't know this was going to happen and
[56:26] then he woke out of the stream he said
[56:27] this is a dreadful place and he called
[56:30] it bethl the house of God so this was
[56:32] the Gate of Heaven I'll put it this way
[56:34] you know this was the entrance to Heaven
[56:36] repent and be baptized in the name of
[56:38] Jesus Christ every one of you and you
[56:40] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[56:42] you will enter into the Straight Gate
[56:45] right but then now we'll see what now
[56:47] bethl we'll see what maned to
[56:50] bethl right so let's go
[56:54] to so this this is what Jacob said of it
[56:57] now this is the first
[56:59] generation amen and then we drop down
[57:02] there and it's not too far well I guess
[57:05] it is a few hundred years afterward but
[57:06] we go to First Kings and 12 and 25 and
[57:10] we see here
[57:12] jobal who's an
[57:16] Israelite now remember and and I and I
[57:19] have to go back and talk about the
[57:20] definations but remember they didn't
[57:21] retain God in their
[57:23] knowledge right that's why they went
[57:25] from worshiping the incorruptable god to
[57:28] worshiping something they made cuz they
[57:31] did not hold him in their knowledge so
[57:33] the as a Generations went on the god
[57:36] that revealed himself to the first one
[57:38] these other ones forgot really who he
[57:41] was
[57:42] okay First Kings 12:25 then jeroboam
[57:46] built built um sheim and Mount Ephraim
[57:48] and dwelt therein and went out from F
[57:50] and built pineal and jbam said in his
[57:53] heart how shall the kingdom return now
[57:56] shall the kingdom return to the House of
[57:57] David if if this people go up to do
[58:00] sacrifice in the house of the Lord at
[58:01] Jerusalem then shall the heart of this
[58:04] people turn again unto their lord even
[58:06] unto um rabom king of Judah and they
[58:10] shall kill me and go again to rabom King
[58:12] of Judah whereupon the king took counsel
[58:14] and made two carves of gold and said
[58:17] unto them it is too much for you to go
[58:19] up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o Israel
[58:22] which brought pardon me thee up out of
[58:24] the land of Egypt and he set one in
[58:26] bethl and he put the other in Dan and
[58:29] the thing became a sin for the people
[58:32] went to worship before one even unto Dan
[58:36] right so he built now so bethl Jacob
[58:39] said this is the house of God this is
[58:40] the Gate of Heaven and then so a few
[58:43] Generations down the road has one of his
[58:46] natural lineage comes upon the Earth and
[58:49] he says now remember a gate is an
[58:51] entrance right so when you go onto a
[58:53] gate you expect what am I going to find
[58:54] there and then so builds this golden
[58:57] calf cuz when he doesn't want them to go
[58:58] to Jerusalem but he's actually saying to
[59:00] the people this is the god you'll find
[59:02] at this gate are you following me this
[59:05] is the image of the god you'll find if
[59:07] you go into this gate and so man had
[59:10] changed
[59:11] bethl God didn't change it man changed
[59:14] it right because they didn't retain they
[59:18] didn't remember what God was in you
[59:22] previously now and then we'll go to Amos
[59:26] Amos 5 and5 I'm just going to read these
[59:27] two more scriptures because here's a
[59:29] Gate of Heaven and then they put this
[59:31] Idol here and then Amos prophesies it
[59:33] all it'll it'll be
[59:35] destroyed right so Amos 5 and5 but seek
[59:39] not bethl nor enter into gilgal pass not
[59:43] to basba before gilgal shall surely go
[59:46] into captivity and bethl shall come to N
[59:50] Seek Ye the Lord and you shall live
[59:52] least he break out like fire in the
[59:54] house of Joseph and devour it and there
[59:56] be none to quench it in bethl so here's
[59:59] the prophecy it'll come to
[1:00:02] not now why did it come to not because
[1:00:04] of what there's nothing wrong with the
[1:00:06] place until what man did with it right
[1:00:09] there's nothing wrong with the word
[1:00:11] there's nothing wrong with this or the
[1:00:13] message until What man does with it amen
[1:00:16] that's why we must we must have the mind
[1:00:18] of Christ I me that the same mind that
[1:00:21] was in the prophet or the same mind that
[1:00:23] was in the apostles all the Believers
[1:00:25] down through that mind must be in you
[1:00:27] amen that when you receive the word you
[1:00:29] don't fashion it into something that it
[1:00:32] isn't
[1:00:34] right amen now let's go to let's go to
[1:00:37] Romans uh back to Romans 1
[1:00:40] again now because we live in a you know
[1:00:43] we live in a day we live in a day the
[1:00:46] son of man's being revealed again as it
[1:00:48] said in Luke 17:30 even thus in this day
[1:00:51] the son of man shall be revealed and
[1:00:53] Jesus Christ the son of man was revealed
[1:00:55] it was was n a prophet making himself
[1:00:57] known it was Jesus the word declaring
[1:00:59] himself so here was God manifested in a
[1:01:01] redeemed son amen here was here was
[1:01:04] everything you know that same Jesus that
[1:01:07] we read about in the
[1:01:09] gospels his body remember we're going to
[1:01:11] meet him in the air right we're going to
[1:01:13] meet him physically in the air right but
[1:01:16] he didn't have to come to Earth in a in
[1:01:18] that body CU he'd already redeemed us
[1:01:20] but he took a redeemed son he took
[1:01:23] someone who was born in sin shaped in
[1:01:25] iniquity come to World speaking lies
[1:01:26] just like us amen someone had to give
[1:01:29] their life over surrender their will
[1:01:31] amen accept the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:01:33] and be transformed he took that man amen
[1:01:37] and he stepped into that man he declared
[1:01:39] himself right but now we have come down
[1:01:42] 50 odd years down the road and so they
[1:01:46] beheld we beheld eternal life this
[1:01:48] generation has beheld eternal life
[1:01:51] manifested in in a man right but because
[1:01:55] they did not glorify him as not the
[1:01:57] prophet now but the one revealing
[1:01:59] himself the word through him because
[1:02:01] they did not glorify him as God God
[1:02:04] turned them over to
[1:02:06] Darkness amen now this Romans 1 has
[1:02:09] repeated itself in this day and hour
[1:02:13] this generation you know the thing is
[1:02:15] though you know we have to understand
[1:02:17] here we are I was born in
[1:02:19] 1985 this world was already in darkness
[1:02:22] in 1985 I was born in an age where God
[1:02:25] has pouring out a pre-tribulation
[1:02:27] judgments where the world is the world
[1:02:30] has already fallen apart I was born into
[1:02:33] it when the world is already fallen
[1:02:34] apart so my frame of reference is this
[1:02:36] is normal without God you say actually
[1:02:39] this is how it should be so then God has
[1:02:41] to come and actually has to take you
[1:02:43] back into his word and say this is not
[1:02:45] how it should be friend amen this is not
[1:02:48] how you should be thinking this is not
[1:02:49] what you should be doing am mean you
[1:02:51] should be loving me and once you fall in
[1:02:53] love with him it's easy amen you just
[1:02:56] fall in love with him and give your will
[1:02:58] over I mean that's the greatest thing
[1:03:00] because Here Comes God Jesus comes in
[1:03:02] flesh he comes to he came to his own
[1:03:05] here the challenge was will they give
[1:03:06] their will will they will they follow
[1:03:09] this Man From Galilee will they follow
[1:03:11] this will this man will they allow this
[1:03:13] man to have rule over us and they
[1:03:15] wouldn't give their will they're like
[1:03:17] Cain we will not surrender to the word
[1:03:19] even though God gave them the
[1:03:20] opportunity God gave Cain the
[1:03:22] opportunity they wouldn't give their
[1:03:24] will over and then was what 7 uh ad
[1:03:28] wasn't that long after when Jesus said
[1:03:31] Jerusalem's going to be destroyed 70
[1:03:33] years later maybe I might be getting it
[1:03:35] wrong Titus comes in you know actually
[1:03:37] he actually besieged the city three
[1:03:39] times first two times he had to withdraw
[1:03:41] and go deal with some other enemy then
[1:03:42] he came in and then it was the Passover
[1:03:45] time he just let them all come in and as
[1:03:47] prophesied it was going to happen and
[1:03:49] then he just annihilated the
[1:03:52] place why what happened because they
[1:03:54] would not had that man crucify him we
[1:03:57] don't want him to rule over me we don't
[1:04:00] want him to rule over us because I'd
[1:04:02] rather worship their own
[1:04:05] self right they'd only they'd rather
[1:04:07] worship what they would rather want to
[1:04:09] do than worship
[1:04:11] Him amen the god of self is a very
[1:04:16] prevalent God in this day and hour amen
[1:04:19] it's all self you know you go to any
[1:04:22] bookstore self-help books so I can help
[1:04:25] myself
[1:04:26] so I can improve myself the whole world
[1:04:29] every facet of your life you can improve
[1:04:32] it yourself and you just pan it to your
[1:04:34] own
[1:04:35] worbs amen what's happening now you've
[1:04:39] made yourself a shrine you prostrate
[1:04:42] yourself I trust you're not in that
[1:04:43] bracket but people do unfortunately and
[1:04:45] they're slaves to
[1:04:48] it
[1:04:50] amen Romans
[1:04:54] now so Romans 1 and 21 because when they
[1:04:57] knew God they glorified him not as God
[1:05:00] neither were thankful but became vain in
[1:05:03] their imaginations and their foolish
[1:05:05] Hearts was darkened so when they knew
[1:05:08] him this world Yo God has declared
[1:05:10] himself you just take one message you
[1:05:13] just listen to the prayer line and and
[1:05:16] God just comes down every heart is naked
[1:05:19] before him there's no you know the devil
[1:05:21] hides in secret and you know you should
[1:05:24] know
[1:05:26] that if that same God can expose people
[1:05:28] back then to set them free he sure can
[1:05:30] do it today amen amen because the spirit
[1:05:33] of God that same God back there in the
[1:05:35] you know 1965 is the same God today
[1:05:38] doing the same thingsall so now this
[1:05:41] word is going to break this down now so
[1:05:44] their imaginations they became vain in
[1:05:47] their imaginations now this word
[1:05:49] imaginations means actually an eternal
[1:05:52] internal discussion so something you
[1:05:55] actually discuss you have a conversation
[1:05:56] with her in your own mind right and it's
[1:05:59] a
[1:06:00] consideration or it's a debate or a
[1:06:03] dispute so your imagine you actually
[1:06:05] they actually begin to reason have an
[1:06:07] internal
[1:06:08] conversation but because they because
[1:06:11] they were vain in their imaginations
[1:06:13] they turned it down right so there
[1:06:16] remember our internal discussion should
[1:06:19] always be
[1:06:20] this amen because we have to remember
[1:06:23] I'll get to Hebrews 12 looking at to
[1:06:25] Jesus remember they they stop looking
[1:06:27] unto Jesus they stop looking unto him
[1:06:31] because if you look unto him you're your
[1:06:34] imaginations will not be vain amen
[1:06:36] because remember we are his workmanship
[1:06:40] we are we are the work of his hands amen
[1:06:43] right but if we think anything less than
[1:06:45] that then our imaginations will become
[1:06:48] vain because then human reasoning comes
[1:06:50] in right and man always tries to shrink
[1:06:53] away you know they don't want to let go
[1:06:56] and let God have his
[1:06:58] way amen
[1:07:01] now now this word imagination no sorry
[1:07:04] and then Ro and then so and then Romans
[1:07:06] uh 1 and 28 even so they did not like to
[1:07:09] retain God in their knowledge God gave
[1:07:12] them over to a reprobate mind to do
[1:07:14] those things which are not convenient
[1:07:16] now this word knowledge actually means a
[1:07:19] recognition or a full discernment or an
[1:07:24] acknowledgement okay so they didn't so
[1:07:26] in their knowledge so they didn't give a
[1:07:28] full recognition this is God revealing
[1:07:31] himself okay and I'm going a bit
[1:07:33] laborious but I want this to sink in
[1:07:35] real real deep I want it to real sink in
[1:07:37] deep and so now so they didn't retain
[1:07:41] God they didn't fully they didn't retain
[1:07:44] what did they think what did they think
[1:07:45] of the days of Noah oh it's just a man
[1:07:47] building a boat he's got a woodwork
[1:07:49] project he's just gone a bit crazy on it
[1:07:50] you know you know they didn't they
[1:07:53] didn't retain it in their knowledge that
[1:07:55] the God that sent their forbears out of
[1:07:58] Eden that made all things amen because
[1:08:01] he's a god of judgment he's a god of
[1:08:04] Mercy but he's a god of judgment amen
[1:08:07] because the cruelty of sin has to be
[1:08:09] dealt with and it was dealt with at
[1:08:12] Calvary where God poured his wrath out
[1:08:16] upon the man Christ Jesus the Wrath you
[1:08:18] should have received he was poured out
[1:08:20] on our lamb amen it wasn't just a nice
[1:08:23] happy kind of sedate death in a hospital
[1:08:26] bed God's Wrath was poured out upon Him
[1:08:29] Hallelujah because sin had to be judged
[1:08:33] Hallelujah and we might come to that
[1:08:34] more later but so they thought Noah he's
[1:08:37] just a crazy man building a boat but his
[1:08:39] children because he kept laying the
[1:08:41] vision in front of them and you know and
[1:08:44] we'll come to that but he kept saying
[1:08:45] that look this is what God showed me
[1:08:48] this is what God is going to do we have
[1:08:50] to start building and they had to they
[1:08:52] had to walk in faith they had to it it
[1:08:55] couldn't been a secondhand Revelation to
[1:08:57] them he following me don't despair am
[1:09:00] mean don't despair right and so it had
[1:09:03] to become real to them and it did
[1:09:09] Hallelujah
[1:09:12] this they in their
[1:09:15] knowledge
[1:09:18] now now this word so and going back to
[1:09:21] verse 25 who changed the truth of God
[1:09:24] into a lie and worshiped and served the
[1:09:27] creature more than the Creator who is
[1:09:29] blessed forever amen now this word
[1:09:33] creature it means an original formation
[1:09:37] that is a thing literally or
[1:09:39] figuratively a building a creation a
[1:09:41] creature or an ordinance now an
[1:09:44] ordinance is something you do so they
[1:09:46] serve the form they begin to serve the
[1:09:49] form more than the one that the forers
[1:09:51] used to approach right and so now if I
[1:09:55] bring it on right on down home to 2017
[1:09:58] people will serve a form of godliness or
[1:10:01] a form of just message religion right
[1:10:04] instead of serving the god that sent the
[1:10:07] word amen that people will be caught up
[1:10:10] in church as and but missing the one
[1:10:13] that is in the
[1:10:14] church amen and we don't want to just
[1:10:16] float along with the message culture
[1:10:18] saying this is what Mommy and Daddy do
[1:10:20] this is what they believe and I'm just
[1:10:22] going along with it you but it's got to
[1:10:24] be personal to you amen the god of bethl
[1:10:28] Hallelujah the god of Abraham Isaac and
[1:10:30] Jacob of the Apostles amen the god of
[1:10:32] William brandom must become real to you
[1:10:35] amen because otherwise it will just be a
[1:10:38] tradition now brother Braham says this
[1:10:40] in world falling apart in
[1:10:43] 1963 he says as long as it's a system
[1:10:46] it's a system the whole system World
[1:10:48] System uh sorry the whole system's
[1:10:50] rotten get away from the thing that's
[1:10:52] exactly what we've got to do before it
[1:10:54] ever comes back you might not believe
[1:10:56] that but this is taped listen added a
[1:10:58] few years from today if there is such a
[1:11:00] thing you'll know whether it's true or
[1:11:02] not one day when the evening lights are
[1:11:04] breaking it's too late then you'll say
[1:11:06] well uh that man could have been right
[1:11:09] it's too late then just exactly what
[1:11:11] Jesus said when he come to the Earth he
[1:11:13] said God had sent them prophets down
[1:11:15] Through the Ages and every time their
[1:11:18] world system would fall apart their
[1:11:19] religious system said what did you do
[1:11:22] with them God sent the prophet they put
[1:11:24] him in a tomb that's exactly and then
[1:11:27] about another generation you wake up and
[1:11:30] realize that that was a prophet what do
[1:11:31] you do garnish the tomb now he brings it
[1:11:33] on to Everyday language for us what do
[1:11:36] you do make a tradition of his
[1:11:39] life they make a tradition of his life
[1:11:42] we must never ever make a tradition out
[1:11:45] of the prophet's life amen we must never
[1:11:48] just make a tradition this is what he
[1:11:50] did this is where he went this what he
[1:11:52] said it can't just become a
[1:11:54] tradition oh I just listened to a tape
[1:11:56] because of tradition you've got to you
[1:11:58] know you should be feeding on that word
[1:12:00] amen cuz there's transforming power in
[1:12:02] that word there's healing in that word
[1:12:04] there's redemption in that word amen so
[1:12:06] we should be feeding on it amen but
[1:12:08] don't let it become a
[1:12:10] tradition whatever you do oh it's Easter
[1:12:12] again don't let it become a tradition
[1:12:14] Hallelujah as should be thank you God
[1:12:16] this is the time we set aside remember
[1:12:17] every day is a Resurrection Day
[1:12:20] Hallelujah we say thank you God we can
[1:12:21] have a special season we remember what
[1:12:24] you did for us amen or when he was born
[1:12:26] or whatever it was but we should never
[1:12:29] let it become a tradition and that's
[1:12:31] what they
[1:12:32] did
[1:12:34] amen so now let's go down to now we're
[1:12:39] back in we're back in
[1:12:41] Romans and it says here now so so they
[1:12:44] didn't retain God in their knowledge and
[1:12:46] they worshiped the creature more than
[1:12:48] the
[1:12:49] Creator and then now he lists all these
[1:12:53] things we've read and we said upon the
[1:12:55] Earth amen we see Sodom Gomorrah out on
[1:12:58] the
[1:12:59] streets but then it comes down to verse
[1:13:01] 32 who knowing the Judgment of God they
[1:13:05] uh that they which commit such things
[1:13:07] are worthy of death not only do the same
[1:13:10] but imp pleas in them that do them and
[1:13:13] then in my Center reference says also
[1:13:15] consent with them that practice them
[1:13:18] amen so they actually look upon these
[1:13:21] things they might not do them themselves
[1:13:23] but they consent or they have PL
[1:13:25] pleasure in watching people do these
[1:13:27] things amen that's why you know it just
[1:13:31] has to come down to Real Simple Truth
[1:13:33] anything that is not of God you know
[1:13:36] this what
[1:13:38] happens Hollywood has an
[1:13:41] agenda right it has an
[1:13:44] agenda it'll Entertain You And in the
[1:13:48] Love Story there's something slips in
[1:13:50] underneath and it begins to change your
[1:13:53] thinking right it Chang it changes your
[1:13:56] attitude towards things but this
[1:13:58] person's such a nice person you know and
[1:14:00] it and it has an agenda because it's
[1:14:01] actually preaching you a a
[1:14:04] message amen he say well the story is
[1:14:06] really awesome but there's but there's
[1:14:08] sex scenes there's all kinds of things
[1:14:10] that shouldn't it says it says in the
[1:14:12] Bible don't even speak about the works
[1:14:14] of
[1:14:15] darkness right don't even talk about it
[1:14:17] but yet we'll enjoy this kind of story
[1:14:20] such a good movie but yeah there's all
[1:14:22] this stuff in that's ungodly but we be
[1:14:25] enjoying it because they're watching it
[1:14:28] amen so you are so you're actually
[1:14:31] having
[1:14:32] pleasure and those people that are
[1:14:34] acting out an act which is
[1:14:38] ungodly amen you say but it's just a
[1:14:41] nice little movie who says it's just a
[1:14:43] nice little movie you say that's awful
[1:14:46] extreme it's such a
[1:14:48] gray World everything's so great what's
[1:14:52] right what's wrong we need to know what
[1:14:55] what's right amen because it'll because
[1:14:58] what'll happen now is people they
[1:15:00] fashion an idol and they say well God
[1:15:03] doesn't mind if I do these
[1:15:05] things are you
[1:15:07] sure you got to think about it you know
[1:15:10] because that is now because what does
[1:15:12] God
[1:15:13] love God loves righteousness God loves
[1:15:16] us to love him right and if you give
[1:15:20] part of yourself to the world you know
[1:15:22] people have I know a lot of you South
[1:15:24] African come out of South Africa maybe
[1:15:26] it's a lot like here you go to church
[1:15:28] you put on your church face you you know
[1:15:30] your Roasters in the oven you say the
[1:15:32] preachers going over 20 minutes what's
[1:15:34] going on you walk out the door and then
[1:15:36] God has forgotten about you have no
[1:15:39] fellowship and you talk about everything
[1:15:40] else well that just really shows what
[1:15:42] was in the heart of the people amen and
[1:15:45] I don't I'm not condemning them because
[1:15:46] they're just caught up in a culture but
[1:15:49] we're going to go beyond a culture into
[1:15:51] a reality amen because what you what's
[1:15:54] on your what you really love you will
[1:15:57] do amen what you really love you will do
[1:16:01] amen and now God isn't looking for
[1:16:03] someone just giving him lip service or
[1:16:06] just flirting with them he's not
[1:16:08] interested in those kind of people he's
[1:16:09] interested in people that say here is my
[1:16:12] whole will here is my whole heart make
[1:16:14] it and take and and make it yours
[1:16:17] Hallelujah that's what he's looking for
[1:16:20] amen and there is power in the blood I I
[1:16:23] guarantee it cuz it happened to me
[1:16:24] there's Power in the Blood where then
[1:16:26] when you really give your will over
[1:16:27] he'll take it and it's a joy it's not a
[1:16:30] burdensome walk it's a rejoicing walk
[1:16:34] hallelujah amen it's exactly it's not a
[1:16:36] burden to be a Christian it's not a
[1:16:39] drudgery for me it maybe sometimes it's
[1:16:42] hard sometimes it's easy but even in the
[1:16:44] hard times you say Glory I don't know
[1:16:46] where I'm going but Lord I'm looking
[1:16:48] unto you Hallelujah that's what we must
[1:16:50] continue to do amen because now looking
[1:16:54] unto Jesus I might just jump there now
[1:16:56] Jesus now he has been revealed in this
[1:16:59] end time right the high priest that so
[1:17:02] so he came out of the Tomb remember Mary
[1:17:06] you know he said to Mary he said don't
[1:17:07] touch me cuz I haven't risen remember
[1:17:09] here's the high priest he was the he was
[1:17:12] the blood and he was the high priest
[1:17:14] that could offer the blood for the sins
[1:17:16] of the people amen he was the prophet
[1:17:18] all those things and he was King all
[1:17:20] those things were in him so he says to
[1:17:22] her don't touch me cuz I haven't
[1:17:23] ascended yet so he went up into glory
[1:17:26] and he offered his own blood Hallelujah
[1:17:29] and then in the Old Testament when the
[1:17:31] high priest went in and he offered the
[1:17:32] blood it was for the sins of the people
[1:17:34] and when he came out the people could
[1:17:36] Rejoice I say cuz the cuz the blood's
[1:17:38] been accepted Hallelujah the sacrifice
[1:17:41] has been accepted for me and so he rose
[1:17:43] up into Glory offered his blood friends
[1:17:45] we have a bleeding religion amen we have
[1:17:47] a power amen this this this must be a
[1:17:50] bleeding gospel I mean so he send it on
[1:17:52] high with his blood and then he came
[1:17:54] came back down amen and then he so so he
[1:17:57] came out from the you could say from the
[1:17:58] holy of holies came back down he said to
[1:18:01] Thomas handle me touch me touch my side
[1:18:04] in my hands hallelujah hallelujah cu the
[1:18:06] sacrifice had been given that's right
[1:18:08] Hallelujah and then after that now but
[1:18:12] he's not just our high priest but he's
[1:18:14] our mediator he's our intercessor amen
[1:18:17] so every day of our life there's a
[1:18:19] bleeding sacrifice amen there is a man
[1:18:22] that's been put in the heavens who was
[1:18:24] God made flesh and he is there
[1:18:26] interceding on your behalf Hallelujah so
[1:18:29] now we have someone who is there
[1:18:32] pleading your case amen because remember
[1:18:35] God's Wrath that should have fallen upon
[1:18:37] you fell upon him at Calvary amen so now
[1:18:40] he's standing in the gap between you and
[1:18:42] a and a and a holy God hallelujah he's
[1:18:45] standing in the Gap there saying father
[1:18:47] forgive them they don't know what they
[1:18:49] do Hallelujah there's a blood there amen
[1:18:52] that is present you say what about when
[1:18:54] he takes the book and he's off The Mercy
[1:18:55] Seat no keep that will happen now it's a
[1:18:59] process of him he's taken the book but
[1:19:01] he's still our high priest remember when
[1:19:04] John you know when he looks around in
[1:19:06] Revelations 5 and he weeps because he
[1:19:08] doesn't see no one's worthy to take the
[1:19:10] book then one of the elders says weep
[1:19:12] not for the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:19:14] has prevailed but when when John looks
[1:19:16] now he sees a lamb he doesn't see a lion
[1:19:20] that's the same person there's not a
[1:19:22] lion and lamb two individual people
[1:19:25] right but when he turns he sees he sees
[1:19:27] a lamb so when he turns he sees a
[1:19:30] sacrifice amen when he turns he sees the
[1:19:32] offering that was placed in his place I
[1:19:35] say when he turns he sees his high
[1:19:37] priest Hallelujah so he still these
[1:19:39] things amen you understand people want
[1:19:42] you know some people they want Mercy to
[1:19:45] be
[1:19:45] over they want it to be done and they
[1:19:49] take quotes and they make an idol right
[1:19:52] and they actually try to say no Mercy's
[1:19:54] over oh just for our families now we
[1:19:55] don't need to outreach anymore we don't
[1:19:57] need to pray and and seek and save the
[1:20:00] lost that's crazy why did Jesus when
[1:20:03] Jesus came into his ministry what was
[1:20:05] the first thing he did gathered his
[1:20:06] disciples Hallelujah hallah I need to go
[1:20:08] by the way of Samaria he was finding the
[1:20:10] lost he was finding the last of that
[1:20:12] Jewish dispensation bring them to
[1:20:13] himself amen so be the same thing with
[1:20:16] the Gentiles if that same God is in you
[1:20:19] amen you'll have a burden God save them
[1:20:21] redeem them get a hold of them amen fill
[1:20:24] your house not just here wherever they
[1:20:25] are doesn't matter where they go as long
[1:20:27] as they birth into your kingdom amen
[1:20:29] living in this word h it should always
[1:20:32] be our heart that Lord I want to see
[1:20:34] someone saved I want to see someone
[1:20:36] healed I want someone to have a closer
[1:20:38] walk with you whatever they do with it
[1:20:40] it's up to them but Lord I want them to
[1:20:41] have a closer walk with you am
[1:20:43] Hallelujah that should be our that
[1:20:45] should be our heart's
[1:20:46] cry so now he is our he is
[1:20:51] our mediator there is one mediator
[1:20:53] between God and man that's the man
[1:20:55] Christ
[1:20:56] Jesus amen
[1:20:59] now job would
[1:21:02] say and we're going to come back to a
[1:21:04] few things but job would say in job
[1:21:07] 9 now a mediator is a go between that's
[1:21:12] what the word means it's actually a go
[1:21:13] between so someone that can go between
[1:21:15] two parties and make
[1:21:17] reconciliation now we know that
[1:21:20] Jesus there's not two Gods there's not
[1:21:22] two Lords there's one amen so God
[1:21:26] himself had to become a man amen because
[1:21:29] no man was found worthy to do it he
[1:21:31] himself had to become a man and be born
[1:21:33] into the human race suffer everything we
[1:21:36] suffered tempted as we were tempted amen
[1:21:38] go through rejection and hardship and
[1:21:40] trial and be misunderstood and you know
[1:21:43] lose family members and all kinds of
[1:21:45] things that he would understand your
[1:21:47] human
[1:21:48] frailties amen he would he would he
[1:21:50] endured you know Joseph died between the
[1:21:53] time he was born and by the time he went
[1:21:55] into his ministry cuz he's not mentioned
[1:21:57] anymore right his own family didn't
[1:21:59] really believe him amen he was rejected
[1:22:02] by the ones he came to
[1:22:03] save amen you know he was you know as a
[1:22:06] 12 year 12y old boy he went into the
[1:22:09] temple when they went to Jerusalem he
[1:22:11] didn't go look at all the stuff that
[1:22:12] boys would normally look at he went to
[1:22:14] the temple and not only went to the
[1:22:15] temple he' opened the Bible and he
[1:22:17] talked to them about the scripture he
[1:22:19] wasn't a normal kind of
[1:22:20] child amen so he would have been made
[1:22:23] fun of he would have been picked off
[1:22:25] you know so he understands what it's
[1:22:28] like what everything we have endureed or
[1:22:31] endure he knows what it's like amen so
[1:22:34] but he had to do that because he had to
[1:22:37] understand what it was like to have
[1:22:38] human frailties amen because it's one
[1:22:41] thing to learn about something as I've
[1:22:43] said probably probably years ago now
[1:22:45] it's like driving a car you can learn
[1:22:47] all about the car but it's when you
[1:22:49] first get in behind the steering wheel
[1:22:51] turn on the ignition and go down the
[1:22:53] road it becomes an experience and it's a
[1:22:56] very different kind of thing so God knew
[1:22:58] the end from the beginning but he had to
[1:23:00] put on flesh he had to come down into
[1:23:03] time to experience what it was like to
[1:23:05] walk in your
[1:23:06] shoes amen this is the god remember
[1:23:09] looking unto Jesus this is the God we
[1:23:11] serve so he is not he is not a distant
[1:23:14] Doty Granddad that doesn't care about
[1:23:16] you amen he's not a distant father that
[1:23:19] does not care amen he's not indifferent
[1:23:22] to your need right he you know he isn't
[1:23:25] some God that cannot be approached amen
[1:23:28] that is too holy to be approached
[1:23:30] because the blood of Jesus Christ gives
[1:23:32] us an approach to his throne of mercy
[1:23:33] and Grace amen but he understands what
[1:23:36] you have gone through he knows what it's
[1:23:38] like to be hungry he knows what it's
[1:23:39] like to be
[1:23:40] homeless amen he knows you know he knows
[1:23:43] everything we have gone through he knows
[1:23:45] what it's lik Amen Hallelujah because
[1:23:47] this is our God remember if you do not
[1:23:49] have confidence in him you'll turn to
[1:23:51] something
[1:23:52] else amen you will turn to something
[1:23:54] else if you do not have confidence in
[1:23:56] God so if you do not believe that he is
[1:23:58] able to do it that he understands your
[1:24:00] need that he he can actually he's walked
[1:24:02] in your shoes amen that he is a
[1:24:05] forgiving loving God are you with me
[1:24:08] amen that his blood is sufficient amen
[1:24:11] that he is your
[1:24:12] Shepherd right amen that he is leading
[1:24:14] you through everyday life if you do not
[1:24:17] have confidence in him you look to
[1:24:18] something else amen and that's what they
[1:24:20] did in Romans 1 is they looked to
[1:24:22] something else and inad of retaining God
[1:24:26] in their knowledge they look to
[1:24:27] something else and they made an idol
[1:24:30] this is what God really
[1:24:31] is amen now job
[1:24:35] 9:24 the Earth is
[1:24:38] given we have it there the Earth is
[1:24:40] given into the hand of the wicked he
[1:24:44] coverthe not where and who is he for my
[1:24:48] days are swifter than a post they flee
[1:24:50] away they see no good they passed away
[1:24:52] as as the Swift ships ship
[1:24:55] as the eagle that hastens to the prey if
[1:24:58] I say I will forget my complaint I will
[1:25:00] leave off my heaviness and comfort
[1:25:02] myself I'm afraid of of all my sorrows I
[1:25:06] know that thou will not hold me innocent
[1:25:09] if I be Wicked why then I labor I in
[1:25:11] vain if I wash myself with snow water
[1:25:15] and make my hands and make my hands
[1:25:17] Never So Clean yet Thou shalt plunge me
[1:25:20] in the ditch and my own clothes shall
[1:25:23] abore me for he is not a man this
[1:25:25] speaking of God he is not a man as I am
[1:25:28] that I should answer him and we should
[1:25:30] come together in judgment neither is
[1:25:32] there any daan uh betwix us that might
[1:25:36] lay his hand upon us both let uh let him
[1:25:40] take his Rod away from me and let not uh
[1:25:43] his fear terrify me uh then would I
[1:25:46] speak and not fear him but it is not so
[1:25:50] with me so job remember they only had
[1:25:53] animal blood
[1:25:55] and he is basically saying if there was
[1:25:56] only someone that could stand between me
[1:25:58] and God and bring us together this is
[1:26:01] what this is what his heart desire was
[1:26:03] amen because you know he did not have he
[1:26:06] did not have God as we have God right he
[1:26:10] did not have a living resurrected
[1:26:13] sacrifice amen he did not have the blood
[1:26:16] of Jesus Christ he only had the blood of
[1:26:17] bulls and goats and remember in his
[1:26:19] trial he only knew give this offering
[1:26:23] amen cuz God with without blood there's
[1:26:25] no remission of sin so he gave this
[1:26:27] offering he didn't know what would
[1:26:29] happen when he went from this world to
[1:26:31] the next world he had no confidence that
[1:26:33] you know that all would be well you know
[1:26:36] he he offered sacrifices on on the
[1:26:38] behalf of his children in fear Le they
[1:26:41] sinned against God he was living in fear
[1:26:43] he was actually worshiping God out of
[1:26:45] fear because he did not have confidence
[1:26:47] you know that all would be well when he
[1:26:49] comes to the end of the road right and
[1:26:51] that's why he's looking for if only I
[1:26:53] had a man that could actually bridge the
[1:26:55] gap that could reconcile me and this you
[1:26:58] know you know this angry God but then
[1:27:00] but then God came down spoke to job and
[1:27:02] he had a revelation now I know my
[1:27:04] redeemer liveth he didn't know that
[1:27:07] before right he didn't know that before
[1:27:09] and he was a man that was God said was a
[1:27:11] perfect man right and then so but then
[1:27:15] he had the Revelation now I know my
[1:27:17] redeemer liveth and so he could he he
[1:27:20] recognized that one day the Redeemer
[1:27:23] would come
[1:27:24] right a redeemer would come a man would
[1:27:27] come and actually reconcile me with God
[1:27:31] hallelujah and he knew amen that he
[1:27:35] would stand upon the Earth he says in my
[1:27:37] flesh I'll see God so he had confidence
[1:27:40] that this now was going to happen this
[1:27:42] changed his whole life right and it's
[1:27:45] the same thing with us now when the lamb
[1:27:47] comes to you you know brother Braham
[1:27:50] says I think it's in the breach or in um
[1:27:52] in God hiding himself in Simplicity you
[1:27:54] know during the start of this um seal
[1:27:56] series he says if we could just lay
[1:27:59] aside our own sinful thoughts the lamb
[1:28:01] would Advance all the way from glory to
[1:28:03] us I mean speaking of when the lamb came
[1:28:06] from The Eternity to take the book and
[1:28:09] so now if we could just lay aside our
[1:28:10] own
[1:28:11] imaginations you know you walk in these
[1:28:14] doors I remember when I was in a I was
[1:28:16] in a Pentecostal Church you know you
[1:28:19] know not very long just sat there heard
[1:28:22] what was going on whatever more but then
[1:28:23] when I I came amongst Believers then the
[1:28:26] Mind battles happened then he tried to
[1:28:28] the devil tries to fill these top two
[1:28:30] inches up with everything and you begin
[1:28:32] to plan this is what I'm going to have
[1:28:33] for lunch this is what I really want to
[1:28:35] do you know and all this just you just
[1:28:37] go off on this big train of thought and
[1:28:39] then the service is over oh the songs
[1:28:40] are done oh that was a quick service wow
[1:28:43] it went so fast why CU you're caught up
[1:28:45] in your own
[1:28:46] imaginations right because where the
[1:28:48] truth is you think the devil the devil
[1:28:51] just doesn't just roll over and play
[1:28:52] dead amen when you know you know when
[1:28:55] Jesus arose took the keys of Hell death
[1:28:57] in the grave of Satan arose triumphant
[1:29:00] he didn't just wave his white flag and
[1:29:01] say well I guess it's not going to work
[1:29:03] out I tried my best he he fights all the
[1:29:06] harder amen so don't be surprised when
[1:29:09] the enemy tries to come in and he
[1:29:12] blindsides you with some thinking that's
[1:29:13] totally contrary to God's word and you
[1:29:15] begin to think where did that come from
[1:29:17] and he tries to make you own the thing
[1:29:20] you got to recognize it for what it is
[1:29:23] amen your enemy you know this is not a
[1:29:25] play fight right there is not some
[1:29:27] pillow fight everyone's patted up and
[1:29:29] you know let's just have some fun and we
[1:29:31] have Hal Time full time that was a neat
[1:29:33] game that's not like that right it's an
[1:29:35] allout War amen the devil is hellbent he
[1:29:40] only has one goal what's his to-do list
[1:29:42] destroy mankind find God's children and
[1:29:45] Destroy them that's his that's his to-do
[1:29:47] list every day that's all he does wake
[1:29:49] up what am I going to do today oh it's
[1:29:51] Monday destroy God's children Tuesday
[1:29:53] what I going to do oh destroy destroy
[1:29:54] God's children it's Easter time destroy
[1:29:55] God's children oh wasn't that oh it's my
[1:29:57] birthday again destroy God's children
[1:29:59] that's all he does amen he has held B on
[1:30:02] destroying you right but if we keep God
[1:30:07] if we know him as as God as his
[1:30:09] character is right that's what I'm
[1:30:11] trying to say in Romans they took who
[1:30:13] God really was and perverted into an
[1:30:15] image that wasn't God Amen so people
[1:30:18] will take scripture or take quotes and
[1:30:20] they'll fashion an idol and they forget
[1:30:23] who God really is
[1:30:25] Hallelujah that's why we've got to
[1:30:27] retain God in our knowledge but now God
[1:30:32] Moses admonished the children of
[1:30:34] Israel let's go to let's go to
[1:30:37] Deuteronomy
[1:30:39] 6:1 and he says it in three places in
[1:30:42] Deuteronomy but he tells he tells the
[1:30:45] families he tells the parents you must
[1:30:48] teach these things to your children and
[1:30:50] to your children's children amen when
[1:30:52] you wake up in the morning speak of him
[1:30:54] amen when you lay down at the end of the
[1:30:56] day speak of him amen you must write
[1:30:58] these things on your door post you know
[1:31:01] just keep the word before you now the
[1:31:03] reason that they did these things is
[1:31:05] because they had to keep the reality of
[1:31:07] God alive among them that it wouldn't
[1:31:10] that it wouldn't become you know like
[1:31:12] Gideon Gideon comes and says if God is
[1:31:14] with us we're the Miracles he had
[1:31:16] something in him obviously he has taught
[1:31:18] in such a way that I'll bring today's
[1:31:20] language Jesus Christ is the same
[1:31:21] yesterday today and forever so he had
[1:31:24] longing if he's still the same God where
[1:31:25] is he amen and it should be the same
[1:31:28] thing amen that we should teach our
[1:31:30] children amen that he's a living God
[1:31:34] Amen that he is the same yesterday today
[1:31:36] and forever that he's mighty to save
[1:31:38] he's Mighty to redeem he is our Shepherd
[1:31:41] amen he will guide us every St of the
[1:31:43] journey he will sustain us through
[1:31:45] life's journey amen he is the strength
[1:31:47] Giver Hallelujah he's our Advocate amen
[1:31:51] he is our peace that's broken down every
[1:31:53] wall amen here is our propitiation for
[1:31:55] sin amen that his blood is still as
[1:31:57] fresh as it was that day amen the
[1:31:59] offering is still there for us amen that
[1:32:02] he's not an Angry God just trying to
[1:32:03] beat us and make us follow a bunch of
[1:32:05] rules but he's a god of love and
[1:32:07] correction that wants to raise us like a
[1:32:09] father does his children and wants to
[1:32:11] express himself and reveal himself to us
[1:32:14] hallelujah that in every situation God
[1:32:16] is wanting to reveal himself amen
[1:32:19] whatever you got to look for him though
[1:32:21] amen look for him in every part of your
[1:32:23] life and you will see him you Lord
[1:32:25] hallelujah just look for where he is so
[1:32:27] they had a burden this was their
[1:32:29] commission amen let's read Deuteronomy 6
[1:32:32] And1 now these are the Commandments the
[1:32:35] statutes and judgments which the Lord
[1:32:37] your God commanded to teach you now I
[1:32:39] just before we keep
[1:32:41] reading you see you uh you know I
[1:32:43] believe brother BR speaks about it he
[1:32:46] speaks about the Beatitudes and someone
[1:32:48] gave him a a gift and it was the
[1:32:49] Beatitudes it was the image of Christ in
[1:32:51] it and so those be there is the
[1:32:54] character and nature of God in this is
[1:32:58] the character and nature of God and so
[1:33:00] that's why Moses was instructing them
[1:33:03] teach these Commandments and statutes to
[1:33:04] your children it wasn't that they would
[1:33:06] just learn some ritualistic form of
[1:33:08] religion but that they would know who
[1:33:10] God really was right now these are the
[1:33:13] Commandments the statutes and the
[1:33:15] judgments which the Lord your God
[1:33:16] commanded to teach you that you might do
[1:33:18] them in the land whether you go to
[1:33:20] possess it that thou mayest fear the
[1:33:22] lord thy God and and keep all his
[1:33:24] statutes and his Commandments which I
[1:33:26] have commanded thee thou and thy son and
[1:33:29] thy Sons Sons all the days of thy life
[1:33:31] that thy days may be
[1:33:34] prolonged now this fear is not a um I
[1:33:37] haven't looked at this one here but it's
[1:33:38] normally a reverential fear and Trust
[1:33:40] just not a being in Terror right because
[1:33:43] you know God wants to be
[1:33:45] reverenced amen God wants to be treated
[1:33:47] with
[1:33:48] respect I mean he you he doesn't want to
[1:33:51] be treated as just some you know he's
[1:33:53] not a Genie that you pull out and rub
[1:33:55] the lamp and say God give me this you
[1:33:57] know he's not someone that you just is
[1:33:59] an erron boy you know that just answers
[1:34:02] our prayers some mascot but he's the
[1:34:03] true and living God hallelujah
[1:34:06] amen he created all
[1:34:08] things now hear therefore o Israel and
[1:34:12] observe to do it that it may be well
[1:34:14] with thee that ye may increase mightily
[1:34:16] as the Lord God of your fathers has
[1:34:18] promised thee that the land that uh that
[1:34:20] floweth with milk and honey here oh Lord
[1:34:23] the Lord our God is one Lord and brother
[1:34:27] said the greatest Revelation you can
[1:34:28] ever have is that Jesus Christ is
[1:34:30] supreme deity amen he's not a second
[1:34:33] person of the godhead that's making an
[1:34:34] idol he is the person
[1:34:38] amen and thou shall love the Lord thy
[1:34:40] God with all thy heart with all thy soul
[1:34:43] and with all thy might now if you have
[1:34:44] the Holy Ghost that becomes easy right
[1:34:48] because remember he imposes something
[1:34:49] upon you but he gives you the ability to
[1:34:52] do it you got to remember that amen amen
[1:34:54] because if you think because you know
[1:34:56] people get in their minds it's been in
[1:34:57] times past this message just rules and
[1:35:00] it's too hard so people leave that's not
[1:35:03] a right image amen now the Right image
[1:35:06] is that God has shed his blood for you
[1:35:08] he's released his Spirit upon the Earth
[1:35:11] amen he comes and dwells in your heart
[1:35:12] when you give your will over to him and
[1:35:14] then that he lives his word out of you
[1:35:18] hallelujah hallelujah amen remember it's
[1:35:21] remember we we just re remember love
[1:35:24] real love is not what you can give I
[1:35:26] mean what you can get it's what you can
[1:35:28] give love is actually a sacrificial
[1:35:30] thing right so now he gave his he poured
[1:35:34] his love out on Calvary and this to me
[1:35:36] this is what this message makes so
[1:35:38] Supreme it magnifies the cross to me it
[1:35:41] magnifies Redemption cu the prophet goes
[1:35:44] you never did it in the first place
[1:35:45] you're Justified and where was it in the
[1:35:47] first place in God's mind before the
[1:35:49] foundation of the world Hallelujah so
[1:35:51] you these things are magnified
[1:35:54] glory be to God and so so these things
[1:35:57] they become and so when it when it
[1:35:59] becomes a greater reality then you love
[1:36:01] him more yeah and when you love him more
[1:36:03] you want to serve him more you want to
[1:36:05] give your life more Lord what can I do
[1:36:08] yeah cuz worship I I was pondering this
[1:36:10] worship is not just singing songs in
[1:36:12] church amen every part of our life
[1:36:15] should be a worship amen every part how
[1:36:18] we treat our spouse how we treat our
[1:36:20] children how we do our job how we dress
[1:36:23] what ever it is it's just a worship
[1:36:25] saying glory be to God I'm redeemed amen
[1:36:28] this is what life should be a
[1:36:30] worship
[1:36:32] Hallelujah
[1:36:34] now um yes and these words sorry verse
[1:36:38] six and these words which I commanded
[1:36:40] thee in this day shall be in thine heart
[1:36:43] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:36:45] unto thy children and shall talk of them
[1:36:48] when thou sest in thy house when thou
[1:36:50] wst by the way and when thou liest down
[1:36:53] and when thou risest up amen you should
[1:36:56] just talk about what bit sure we have to
[1:36:58] talk about natural things but what
[1:37:00] should default setting be glory be to
[1:37:04] God Amen he's redeemed us God loves us
[1:37:07] he's not an Angry God Amen but he's here
[1:37:10] to help us through everything hallelujah
[1:37:12] we're on our way to heaven shouting
[1:37:15] Victory
[1:37:17] amen now and thou shalt bind them for a
[1:37:20] sign upon thy hand and upon thy
[1:37:21] frontlets between thine eyes Thou shalt
[1:37:23] write them upon the post of thy house
[1:37:25] and on thy Gates and it shall be when
[1:37:27] the Lord thy God has brought thee into
[1:37:29] the land which he swear unto thy fathers
[1:37:30] to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give
[1:37:33] thee great and God uh goodly cities
[1:37:35] which thou buildest not and and houses
[1:37:37] full of good things which thou fillest
[1:37:39] not and Wells dig that thou digest not
[1:37:42] Vineyards and olive trees which thou
[1:37:44] plest not uh when thou have eaten and be
[1:37:48] full then beware Le thou forget the Lord
[1:37:51] which brought thee out of the land of
[1:37:53] Egypt eypt from the house of bondage
[1:37:55] he's saying if you if you stay this way
[1:37:58] it doesn't matter what Prosperity comes
[1:38:00] your way you will not forget the Lord
[1:38:05] amen and to me this is what we must
[1:38:08] do amen our children shouldn't just it
[1:38:12] should be more than words coming out of
[1:38:13] our mouth but my heart's desire is when
[1:38:16] they read the children's Bible or or
[1:38:19] they hear something that Jesus would do
[1:38:21] they'd say that's what Daddy would do
[1:38:23] that's what that's like Mommy Mommy
[1:38:25] would do something like that amen cuz
[1:38:27] they see the same God in print is now
[1:38:30] actually in in
[1:38:32] you amen and because that's how remember
[1:38:36] a lot of how we how we raise our
[1:38:38] children is actually
[1:38:40] subconscious amen by our actions by how
[1:38:43] we say things what we say Amen it's
[1:38:45] actually training them a lot more than
[1:38:49] what we say verbally right so now if we
[1:38:52] if we're going through through a
[1:38:54] trial and we even though we don't deny
[1:38:57] the situation we say but God is mighty
[1:38:59] to help us amen he will he will see us
[1:39:02] through this or if they're sick and say
[1:39:04] well God is your healer amen sure
[1:39:07] brother Bram took his family to the
[1:39:08] doctors praise God for
[1:39:09] doctors amen remember he took sister mey
[1:39:13] she had the tumor that was growing right
[1:39:16] went to the consultations God had booked
[1:39:18] in for the surgery he believed that they
[1:39:22] both believe that God could make it
[1:39:23] disappear right but they still they
[1:39:26] still acted the natural way and it was a
[1:39:29] and it but it changed from a hope so to
[1:39:31] a it was actually a faith Revelation
[1:39:34] that he knew that God had would do it
[1:39:36] ask what you will it shall be done let
[1:39:38] it disappear when the surgeon goes to
[1:39:40] touch her am me it wasn't a hope so it
[1:39:42] became a reality and real faith is not a
[1:39:45] hope it'll work it's actually you know
[1:39:46] It's Already
[1:39:47] Done Right Hallelujah now let's go to
[1:39:51] Deuteronomy 4 and6
[1:39:54] so we should
[1:39:56] always remember if mommy and daddy have
[1:39:59] confidence full confidence in the
[1:40:01] Lord your your children will see it
[1:40:05] right and so then they will see some
[1:40:07] conly they'll be trained mommy and daddy
[1:40:09] turn to God then they'll say well my My
[1:40:12] Help Cometh From him as well right and
[1:40:14] that's that's what we need to
[1:40:15] subconsciously teach them that how we
[1:40:18] act and how we spend our time right now
[1:40:21] that now what I'm saying is they they
[1:40:23] should see our first love should be
[1:40:26] him and then now that and that will be
[1:40:30] shown in how we treat our
[1:40:32] family amen
[1:40:35] amen Deuteronomy 4
[1:40:39] and6 and then that is also how they will
[1:40:42] how how you how they see you treat your
[1:40:45] spouse is how they will treat their
[1:40:48] spouse right because they see an example
[1:40:51] This Is How Daddy treats Mommy this is
[1:40:53] how I want to treat one my wife one day
[1:40:56] when I get married or this is how mommy
[1:40:57] treats Daddy this is how I want to treat
[1:40:58] my
[1:40:59] husband right because actually everyday
[1:41:02] life and in conversation they pick up
[1:41:04] what's going on and they may not be able
[1:41:06] to put it into words but they say this
[1:41:08] is the example lived in front of
[1:41:10] me amen Deuteronomy 4:6 keep therefore
[1:41:15] and do them for this is your wisdom and
[1:41:18] your understanding in the sight of
[1:41:20] Nations which shall hear all these
[1:41:22] statutes and say
[1:41:24] surely this great nation is a wise and
[1:41:27] understanding people for what nation now
[1:41:30] remember he's talking to them under the
[1:41:31] blood of bulls and goats but I could say
[1:41:34] we could really say these words right
[1:41:37] for what nation is there so great who
[1:41:39] hath God so nigh unto them remember they
[1:41:42] had God they couldn't even approach him
[1:41:46] they were at the bottom of Mount Si God
[1:41:48] came down on the top there was a
[1:41:49] boundary put around the mountain no one
[1:41:51] could pass up beyond that and he's
[1:41:53] saying God Is So nigh unto us but
[1:41:56] remember the Apostle Paul says but ye
[1:41:57] have not come unto that mountain where
[1:42:00] God could not be touched but you have
[1:42:01] come unto Mount Zion
[1:42:03] Hallelujah right as the Lord our God is
[1:42:07] in all things that we call upon him for
[1:42:11] amen has there any been a people where
[1:42:13] God Is So nigh unto them Hallelujah
[1:42:16] where the word of God is nther even in
[1:42:17] thy mouth amen where that same God
[1:42:20] dwells in you you can't get closer than
[1:42:23] that that's what N means amen glory only
[1:42:26] take heed to yourself and keep your soul
[1:42:28] diligently Le th forget the things which
[1:42:31] thine eyes have seen un least they
[1:42:33] depart from thy heart all the days of
[1:42:36] thy life so don't let a testimony become
[1:42:38] common even your own testimony do not
[1:42:41] let it become common amen we should be
[1:42:44] more you know to me I'm more thankful

[1:43:17] thy heart all the days of thy life but
[1:43:18] teach them to thy sons and thy son Sons
[1:43:21] especially the day that thou s stood us
[1:43:23] before the Lord thy God in Horeb when
[1:43:25] the Lord said unto me gather me the
[1:43:27] people together and I'll make them hear
[1:43:29] my words that they may learn to fear me
[1:43:32] all the days that they shall live upon
[1:43:34] the Earth and that they may teach their
[1:43:37] children and ye came near and stood
[1:43:39] under the mountain and the mountain
[1:43:40] burned with fire uh un the midst of
[1:43:43] Heaven into the darkness clouds and I
[1:43:45] mean Darkness clouds and thick darkness
[1:43:47] and the Lord spake unto you out of the
[1:43:48] midst of the fire you heard the voice of
[1:43:51] words but saw no um um similitude only

[1:44:16] going to show you what's in the back
[1:44:17] parts of God's mind that he's had before
[1:44:19] the foundation of the world and then a
[1:44:20] three OD hour sermon has preached of
[1:44:22] what was in the back parts of God's mind

[1:44:26] things just casually amen but we should
[1:44:28] reverence these things amen we should we
[1:44:31] should be so thankful remember it says
[1:44:32] in Romans 1 they weren't thankful that's
[1:44:35] why they didn't keep them in you know
[1:44:36] you know in their knowledge so we should
[1:44:38] actually be so thankful that God would
[1:44:41] reveal himself in this end time amen
[1:44:44] that he would speak his word upon the
[1:44:46] Earth to call you out of Darkness amen
[1:44:49] that he would declare himself Hallelujah

[1:45:10] even greater day when Jesus came the
[1:45:12] first time amen because the fullness of
[1:45:15] redemption has come amen we're living in
[1:45:17] the days of the body change Hallelujah

[1:45:24] salvation does hallelujah just it's not

[1:45:50] language cuz I want to hear what he said

[1:45:56] should be so thankful that we we we
[1:45:59] understand English amen we don't just

[1:46:03] and that's all you know we are we are
[1:46:06] spoiled amen we're a spoiled
[1:46:09] people hallelujah and we have the
[1:46:12] technology in our hands amen we don't
[1:46:15] have you know I've seen you know
[1:46:17] Christine's grandparents they had the
[1:46:18] big real tooreal tapes imagine a
[1:46:20] thousand of them

[1:46:25] want to listen to this today take it out
[1:46:27] set it up make sure it doesn't become
[1:46:29] spaghetti you know play
[1:46:31] it and we have
[1:46:34] this what do you want to hear I'll I
[1:46:36] could download it right now and play it
[1:46:37] for
[1:46:38] you amen we have this it's incredible
[1:46:42] God's mind spoken through a prophet Amen
[1:46:45] to make this live to make this a reality
[1:46:48] that we're don't just going I don't know
[1:46:49] what this means and I think it's like
[1:46:51] this and this is what it says no it
[1:46:53] becomes plain Hallelujah that we're not
[1:46:56] walking in darkness there's never been a
[1:46:58] great day like this day amen what a
[1:47:01] glorious day so we should teach these
[1:47:04] things that's why you know just like
[1:47:06] that photograph there I you know you
[1:47:08] I've told the children that's God having
[1:47:10] his photograph taken amen that Pillar of
[1:47:13] Fire is the Angel of the C that's Jesus
[1:47:15] Christ in another form Hallelujah and to
[1:47:18] me that's the main part of that
[1:47:19] photograph is not the mouthpiece it's
[1:47:20] the one speaking through the mouthpiece
[1:47:23] Hallelujah not to take away from the
[1:47:24] prophet but you understand
[1:47:27] hallelujah amen and
[1:47:30] now where were we yes uh and then verse
[1:47:33] 13 of Deuteronomy 4 and he declared unto
[1:47:36] you his Covenant which he commanded you
[1:47:39] to perform even the Ten Commandments he
[1:47:41] wrote them upon two tables of stone and
[1:47:44] the Lord commanded me at that time to
[1:47:45] teach you the uh statutes and judgments
[1:47:48] that you might do all them in the land
[1:47:50] where thou go to possess it take you
[1:47:52] there for good heed unto yourselves for
[1:47:55] you saw no manner of sim on that day
[1:47:58] that the Lord spoke unto you in horb out
[1:48:00] of the midst of the fire so he declared
[1:48:03] now this I love the book of Deuteronomy
[1:48:07] it's incredible book but he said he
[1:48:09] declared unto you his Covenant right
[1:48:13] which he commanded you to perform now in
[1:48:16] this day remember we're looking unto
[1:48:18] Jesus I trust it's in your hearts he's
[1:48:21] everything I need his word he is his
[1:48:24] word amen and there strength in his word
[1:48:26] and so now in that day it was if thou
[1:48:29] shal I will it was a conditional
[1:48:32] Covenant amen but in this day it's not
[1:48:35] if thou shal it's I have already made
[1:48:37] you it's an unconditional Covenant where
[1:48:40] he you know it's like in the Old
[1:48:42] Testament two people would come and make
[1:48:45] an agreement and then they would write
[1:48:47] the agreement upon a piece of parchment
[1:48:50] and they would kill an animal and that
[1:48:52] animal would would unite them together
[1:48:54] an agreement they'd rip the thing in
[1:48:56] half and they and they' take each half
[1:48:59] and the agreement was if we do not
[1:49:01] fulfill what we've said we'll be like
[1:49:03] this dead animal amen and so now here
[1:49:07] comes our lord Jesus and he makes a
[1:49:09] covenant between God and man and he's
[1:49:12] hanging brother B says when he's hanging
[1:49:13] on Calvary he's writing a covenant with
[1:49:15] the families of the earth and so here he
[1:49:18] was here's his Covenant he knows you
[1:49:20] can't keep your half cuz you're a fallen
[1:49:22] person anyway Hallelujah and so he says
[1:49:25] I'll become the slain one which unites
[1:49:28] us together and then and then he rips
[1:49:31] the Covenant God ripped the Covenant in
[1:49:33] two and he sent one half up as the body
[1:49:36] and he sends the other half down to you
[1:49:39] amen so the holy spirit is the half of
[1:49:41] the Covenant which is showing that you
[1:49:43] are linked with the other half I mean so
[1:49:46] if the spirit of God is in you I mean
[1:49:48] you're connected with the
[1:49:50] sacrifice Hallelujah and so now he is
[1:49:53] saying now that this is the Covenant he
[1:49:55] declared unto you his Covenant which he
[1:49:57] commanded you to perform now it's in the
[1:49:59] Old Testament but this message has
[1:50:01] declared unto you God's covenant with
[1:50:04] you amen are you following me he is he
[1:50:08] it is declared what God had said would
[1:50:10] be done in this last days and what he
[1:50:12] would do to a people amen you see you
[1:50:15] know you know brother Braham speaks
[1:50:17] about the sign of the Resurrection he
[1:50:19] says about people that once in
[1:50:20] trespassing sins and darkness who once
[1:50:23] were drunkards and bootleggers and
[1:50:24] prostitutes whatever more then God gets
[1:50:26] a hold of them he says those people are
[1:50:29] the sign of the Resurrection hallelujah
[1:50:32] amen because they have been passed from
[1:50:33] Death unto life and it's not them living
[1:50:35] anymore Hallelujah so when you get up in
[1:50:38] the morning and you brush your teeth I
[1:50:40] trust you can brush your teeth and say
[1:50:42] hello sign of the Resurrection how you
[1:50:44] doing amen cuz you are the greatest you
[1:50:46] are the greatest proof the believer is
[1:50:49] the greatest proof that Jesus died and
[1:50:51] he rose again and that this message this
[1:50:54] message is true you are the greatest
[1:50:56] Vindication people want to say I need to
[1:50:58] see proof that that you that God exists
[1:51:00] you say Here I
[1:51:02] Am case study of one do you want do you
[1:51:05] want do you want more case studies to
[1:51:07] prove it you know when they do a you
[1:51:09] know a study they need they need more
[1:51:10] than just one amen and so you are the
[1:51:14] greatest proof that this thing works
[1:51:17] Hallelujah so now we are living in an
[1:51:20] age where
[1:51:23] where man can truly walk with
[1:51:25] God Amen in a greater way than has been
[1:51:29] through past ages amen our the reality
[1:51:33] of the bride's walk you say well I just
[1:51:34] live and I come to church and but God
[1:51:37] comes and he speaks to you and he
[1:51:39] ministers to you amen and this world you
[1:51:43] see this you see the church you know you
[1:51:45] just take the last 100 years look where
[1:51:47] the world has fallen
[1:51:49] to amen look where it's it's incredible
[1:51:52] you know and the people living back
[1:51:54] there if they could see where the world
[1:51:56] would go they think we got to change we
[1:51:58] got to stop something right now we can't
[1:52:00] let it go this way this world is crazy
[1:52:04] brother Ram said it's just a you not far
[1:52:06] from Insanity and to me I say this world
[1:52:09] is insane amen and so now here we are
[1:52:13] we're living in the darkest age of all
[1:52:14] the ages this is the most treacherous
[1:52:17] time to be alive because gross Darkness
[1:52:20] covers the people amen gross Darkness
[1:52:23] covers the people but but as we read
[1:52:26] arise and shine for thy light has come
[1:52:29] and the glory of the Lord has risen upon
[1:52:31] you and then here you are you once in
[1:52:33] that darkness and then the Lord speaks
[1:52:36] to your life he lifts you up takes your
[1:52:38] burden of sin away when you give it to
[1:52:40] him amen takes your nature changes it
[1:52:43] and then now you look at the world very
[1:52:45] differently amen and you're not walking
[1:52:47] in darkness anymore and the world is
[1:52:50] falling but the bride is ascending
[1:52:53] Hallelujah well once you were an enemy
[1:52:55] of God the scripture says but now you
[1:52:57] have been reconciled by the blood of
[1:52:59] Jesus Christ amen and to me that is an
[1:53:02] incredible thing you know we take we
[1:53:05] hold the martys in very high regard and
[1:53:07] we should hey they sold out I mean they
[1:53:10] couldn't just they weren't living in a
[1:53:11] day like this day where we could change
[1:53:13] religion you know like you know in the
[1:53:15] west I could
[1:53:17] disappear I could become a whatever you
[1:53:21] know and there's not a
[1:53:23] I'd say Stokes Valley you know my my
[1:53:25] community there's not a community
[1:53:26] pressure you can't change religion
[1:53:28] because in a lot of places of the world
[1:53:30] you can't just change church amen
[1:53:33] because there's the village pressure
[1:53:34] there's the family pressure you know I
[1:53:36] was up in the highlands and you you know
[1:53:38] up in Papa New Guinea and then this guy
[1:53:40] pointed this way it's all Seventh Day
[1:53:41] Adventist and this way is all uh UPC
[1:53:45] this way is all Catholic that's all this
[1:53:47] is what it is you can't change unless
[1:53:49] the Lord gets a hold of you and the Mars
[1:53:51] were much same way they had to be
[1:53:53] willing to forsake all they knew it was
[1:53:56] death potentially they could be burned
[1:53:58] at the Stak but they weren't
[1:54:01] half-hearted bunch of jellyfish they
[1:54:04] knew in whom they had believed they were
[1:54:06] fully persuaded Hallelujah and so they
[1:54:10] knew hey this could
[1:54:11] happen you know imagine imagine if we
[1:54:14] have a church service you know let's go
[1:54:15] back to the Roman day and forgive me for
[1:54:17] jokes but just think about it you know
[1:54:19] we go back to the Roman day half the
[1:54:21] church has gone and some new people
[1:54:23] coming why is this church so empty well
[1:54:26] actually you know well actually well
[1:54:29] this half the soldiers got them they're
[1:54:31] in the arena today you know or you just
[1:54:34] come in and someone leads us in prayer
[1:54:36] Lord help half our Saints you have a big
[1:54:39] long list they're waiting in the arena
[1:54:42] give them strength help them overcome
[1:54:45] and this is the religion you want me to
[1:54:47] sign up
[1:54:48] to and people did amen they forsook all
[1:54:52] amen hallelujah they were willing they
[1:54:55] rejoiced amen because the light the
[1:54:58] light in their day fell upon
[1:55:00] them Hallelujah and here we are they
[1:55:03] were worshiping a bunch of Idols in that
[1:55:05] day amen and here we are the lights come
[1:55:08] amen and we are living in a greater day
[1:55:10] than that day amen and yet we'll let
[1:55:14] some little
[1:55:15] thing will some little thing Rob us of a
[1:55:18] full Victory amen cast off the works of
[1:55:21] darkness
[1:55:23] amen cast it off amen don't let your
[1:55:25] reasoning say well I'm a good person I'm
[1:55:27] a good boy oh I probably haven't seen in
[1:55:29] a long time when I started to listen to
[1:55:32] brother
[1:55:33] bradam I was lost and undone in the
[1:55:35] world and it convicted me like nothing
[1:55:37] else did I just cry and cry and cry then
[1:55:39] I thought but I'm a good person hello
[1:55:42] everyone who thinks you're a good person
[1:55:44] and I had this dream and there was this
[1:55:46] young guy same age as myself about 21
[1:55:49] and he's walking down a long Sandy Beach
[1:55:51] and he had the little kind of dingy with
[1:55:53] a um with a with an outboard motor but
[1:55:56] it was up in the sand it wasn't down the
[1:55:58] water he was trying to push it into the
[1:56:00] water to travel somewhere else he
[1:56:01] couldn't get it to budge and then
[1:56:03] there's these two brothers natural
[1:56:05] Brothers walking down the beach he says
[1:56:07] I'll TR you know we'll try and help you
[1:56:08] move it it just wouldn't move so so he
[1:56:11] said to them well you just come live
[1:56:12] with us then so he lived with them he
[1:56:15] married one of their sisters then they
[1:56:17] had children and the guy got older he
[1:56:19] became a Granddad and he had
[1:56:20] grandchildren then one day walking along
[1:56:22] with some buddies at night time and it's
[1:56:25] just raining a little bit and he walks
[1:56:27] to across the road and he slips over
[1:56:30] cracks his head on the pavement and then
[1:56:32] in the dream there's rain falling on his
[1:56:34] face gently you see blood coming out the
[1:56:36] back of his head he smiles to himself he
[1:56:39] knew he dying but he says I've lived a
[1:56:40] good life he changed from a normal
[1:56:43] looking old man to this really evil evil
[1:56:45] looking fellow you know with these
[1:56:47] needle teeth and things and there was
[1:56:48] all this quick scenes of violence
[1:56:50] through his life ripped the throw out of
[1:56:52] a person you know terrible things and
[1:56:54] then there was like a globe and people
[1:56:56] who looked exactly like him walking out
[1:56:58] upon the face of the Earth and I woke up
[1:57:01] and a voice said to me and you and he
[1:57:03] thought he was good what about you I
[1:57:06] hadn't killed anyone I hadn't ended up
[1:57:08] in jail I didn't do hard
[1:57:11] drugs amen I was a normal student
[1:57:14] society would say well he's just a
[1:57:16] student I thought I was a good person
[1:57:20] amen
[1:57:22] he thought he was a good yeah yeah so
[1:57:24] you can't you know you can't just don't
[1:57:26] reason in your imagination but I'm
[1:57:28] morally
[1:57:29] good hey we're born
[1:57:31] lost but you have to realize you're lost
[1:57:34] in order to be found amen and even if
[1:57:36] you recognized hey I'm lost you're a
[1:57:39] blessed person cuz there's multitudes
[1:57:41] who don't even know they're lost
[1:57:45] hallelujah amen so don't just don't just
[1:57:48] reason it
[1:57:49] away I'm a good person you got to look
[1:57:52] unto Jesus amen I think we'll just maybe
[1:57:56] we have some musicians to come but
[1:57:58] remember don't just reason away well I
[1:58:00] give I give Sunday mornings to God and
[1:58:02] maybe a Wednesday night or maybe I read
[1:58:04] my Bible read the family altar you know
[1:58:07] don't just and then I do everything else
[1:58:10] you got to give
[1:58:12] everything right you can't just give
[1:58:14] part of your life it's got to be all of
[1:58:16] your
[1:58:17] life amen because how else you know if
[1:58:20] the martys could do it
[1:58:23] we have a power in this
[1:58:24] Blood amen we have an overcoming power
[1:58:27] brother Braham says he says about how we
[1:58:29] you know hold the martyrs in such high
[1:58:31] regard but yet we belittle the faith we
[1:58:33] have to overcome every day amen because
[1:58:37] this is a dark World
[1:58:38] friends but if you keep looking remember
[1:58:41] he's your high priest amen he's your
[1:58:45] mediator he's your guide he's your
[1:58:47] comforter he's your comforter in times
[1:58:49] that are hard amen he's your Shepherd
[1:58:52] you got to look under him remember he's
[1:58:54] your word if you have a question and you
[1:58:56] don't know where to go look into his
[1:58:58] word you'll find it on tape or you'll
[1:59:00] find it in the scripture cuz God will
[1:59:02] min or you'll find it in the ministry
[1:59:04] whatever it is or in Fellowship but God
[1:59:06] will give you an answer and you don't
[1:59:08] need to guess maybe this is what he's
[1:59:10] saying he will he will tell you and you
[1:59:13] don't need to guess
[1:59:14] it amen you know it's like that dream I
[1:59:18] don't have to guess what that means God
[1:59:20] says that he thought he was good what
[1:59:21] about you yeah amen very simple things
[1:59:25] but you know you don't have to guess at
[1:59:27] it God will tell
[1:59:28] you right so we got to keep looking unto
[1:59:32] him because this is a dark
[1:59:35] hour so friends we'll take the opposite
[1:59:38] of Romans 1 because when they knew God
[1:59:42] they were thankful they kept them in
[1:59:44] their
[1:59:46] knowledge their imaginations were not
[1:59:49] vain what's not a vain imagination God
[1:59:51] you always is right your word is true
[1:59:53] change me to match your word that is not
[1:59:55] a vain imagination that's a wise person
[1:59:57] am mean a wise person always says Lord
[1:59:59] you always right and you always know
[2:00:01] what you're doing and you're in control
[2:00:03] of my life doesn't matter what pressure
[2:00:05] comes on you can always say God you're
[2:00:07] in control thank you Lord hallelujah
[2:00:10] mold and shape me to your image that is
[2:00:12] a good imagination amen and so those
[2:00:14] people just take the opposite of rans
[2:00:16] what now those people did not God did
[2:00:18] not give them over to their Darkness
[2:00:20] amen and they did not do those things
[2:00:22] with themselves between themselves but
[2:00:24] they lived a holy Pure Life Lord
[2:00:27] hallelujah and they rejoiced in the
[2:00:29] truth amen hallelujah I trust I can say
[2:00:34] we're one of them
[2:00:37] amen amen let's read well I just want to
[2:00:40] read one more
[2:00:43] thing now there's a position in Christ
[2:00:45] in
[2:00:46] 1960 every man he knew by for knowledge
[2:00:49] therefore if he by for knowledge knew
[2:00:52] who would be saved and who would not be
[2:00:54] saved he could predestinate the word's
[2:00:56] not such a bad word after all he could
[2:00:58] predestinate because he knew who would
[2:01:00] or who would not therefore in order to
[2:01:02] catch those who he would he made a
[2:01:03] propitiation for their sins oh if we
[2:01:06] could just wait I'll just stop here
[2:01:08] people say oh but God's never done
[2:01:11] anything for
[2:01:12] me when John pointed out the lamb he
[2:01:14] says here's the Lamb of God that takes
[2:01:16] away the sin of the world Amen so he
[2:01:19] died for everyone right he died for
[2:01:22] everyone's sin right but we have to
[2:01:25] receive we have to accept his
[2:01:29] sacrifice because some people say well
[2:01:30] God's never done anything for me while
[2:01:32] you were yet sinners he loved us and
[2:01:34] died on the cross and he died for the
[2:01:36] whole world but he knew who would accept
[2:01:38] the
[2:01:39] sacrifice amen so he's already done
[2:01:42] something for me
[2:01:45] glory amen oh if we could just uh we
[2:01:48] want to get um he predestinated us to
[2:01:50] eternal life not that those who would
[2:01:52] lay aside everything and no matter how
[2:01:55] indifferent it would look towards the
[2:01:57] children of the world it wouldn't mean
[2:01:59] one thing to them because they were
[2:02:00] children of God and he called them and
[2:02:02] He sent Jesus that his blood might be an
[2:02:05] atonement a blood atonement to make a
[2:02:07] propitiation or exceptions or a
[2:02:10] cleansing a cleansing process to
[2:02:12] continually not just one time at one
[2:02:15] Revival but ever living making
[2:02:17] intercessions that the Christian has
[2:02:19] kept clean day and night there is the
[2:02:22] blood of Jesus Christ that then makes an
[2:02:24] exception um on the cross there up in
[2:02:27] the presence of God that cleanses us
[2:02:29] constantly day and night from all sin
[2:02:31] and we are safely tucked in tucked in
[2:02:33] how by the Holy Spirit into the body of
[2:02:36] the Lord Jesus and safe Hallelujah we
[2:02:40] have a we have an
[2:02:42] atonement amen but you've got to accept
[2:02:45] it as a
[2:02:47] pardon right so you've got to accept it
[2:02:49] that this is your pardon from a world of
[2:02:52] darkness and being being lost but it's
[2:02:55] it's your pardon that you can be passed
[2:02:56] from Death unto
[2:02:57] life
[2:02:59] amen amen should we just stand shall
[2:03:03] we you say
[2:03:05] well my walk's pretty rugged at the
[2:03:07] moment I don't know how Victorious I am

[2:03:12] sacrifice amen got to keep looking unto
[2:03:15] him in this dark world Amen let's just
