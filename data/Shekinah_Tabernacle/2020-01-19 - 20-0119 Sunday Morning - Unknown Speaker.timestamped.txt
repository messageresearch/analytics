[28:00] sheaf offering and he was crucified and
[28:04] then he lived again because he rose
[28:06] again and then he was Katie come to

[43:31] little path and the whole real real

[43:37] sister Doreen here this morning I I
[43:39] would much rather sit in the pews and
[43:41] listen to you my brother seasoned
[43:43] minister but I understand it's your
[43:45] weekend off so we like really to have a
[43:49] break this morning praise the Lord so
[43:55] this morning I would like to share
[43:57] something that
[43:59] that I've just been looking at over the
[44:03] last last few months just little bits
[44:06] and pieces and and I I testified last
[44:10] night that when the Lord touched my my
[44:14] heart about seven years ago now the the
[44:19] message became a new message and things
[44:22] that over the years that I looked at
[44:27] intellectually and try to understand and
[44:29] try to dig into things and so forth when
[44:31] the Lord starts opening it it's just so
[44:33] simple it's just so completely different
[44:37] and when the Lord opens the word it's I
[44:39] don't know it becomes personal and
[44:42] something that that I found is that that
[44:44] even the deepest doctrine have a life
[44:47] application because it's a life that's
[44:49] lived in us and so forth and it's just
[44:52] it's just wonderful and and I always say
[44:54] that the word is is to me like like a
[44:57] little kid in a candy store these little
[44:59] pink lollies and blue lollies and purple
[45:01] lollies and all sorts of in-between
[45:03] lollies and where do you start you know
[45:06] that's the kind of thing and the word is
[45:07] just like that there's so much in that
[45:09] what I what I just I don't know and I
[45:11] trust this is okay brother Ben but but
[45:14] for me when I read the message is
[45:16] exactly the same spirit that's that's
[45:18] behind the Bible you know where you can
[45:20] read in the Bible and and it's not
[45:23] presented in an intellectual structured
[45:26] way exactly right but you can read the
[45:28] same verse over and over and over and
[45:30] over and get more and more and more than
[45:32] more you read it and for me the message
[45:33] is the same you rested listen to some of
[45:36] those messages and we were we were just
[45:39] sharing I think yesterday or the day
[45:41] before with one of the young brothers
[45:43] that you know you would listen to a
[45:46] message and rejoice in it and enjoy it
[45:48] and get a lot out of it and then you
[45:50] would sit and listen to someone else
[45:51] preaching out of that exact same message
[45:54] and it's like well I didn't see that
[45:56] question I didn't see that quite a night
[45:58] you see because the Lord just keeps on
[46:00] anointing little bits and pieces over so
[46:04] I'm just gonna I guess prop perhaps I'll
[46:08] say this is this is my testimony did and
[46:11] when I say my testimony is just
[46:13] what the Lord is currently kind of
[46:14] making a life to me and and and what I'm
[46:17] rejoicing in this morning and I'll say
[46:21] again if anything is said that that's
[46:23] causing might be a question in your mind
[46:25] or anything go to your pastor you know
[46:28] his place they the Lord has placed him
[46:31] as responsible over your souls and and
[46:35] brother Brennan makes very clear
[46:36] statements that he will see you through
[46:38] and and I pray for your pastor he always
[46:40] needs that you know these things that
[46:43] that happen behind the scenes pressures
[46:46] etcetera they that you often don't know
[46:49] about keeping before the Lord keep on
[46:52] praying that the Lord will continue to
[46:53] open the word for you and so forth I
[46:55] remember I'm sorry this is just kind of
[46:58] personal like I guess but I remember
[47:00] thinking as a young Christian we on
[47:06] earth doesn't minister get something to
[47:08] preach about every week sometimes two or
[47:10] three times a week
[47:11] I mean wages come from I mean you got a
[47:14] really be sharp and I found out you
[47:17] don't have to be shy in fact I'm
[47:19] probably one of the least sharper ones
[47:21] in the room I mean but you know what the
[47:24] Lord is always there the Lord always has
[47:27] something the Lord the Lord always
[47:29] provides and I thank the Lord for them
[47:31] anyway I don't want to take more of your
[47:33] time I wonder if you could stand with me
[47:35] and we can turn in our Bibles to John 11
[47:47] now the young people from church back
[47:48] home will recognize this the service I
[47:52] preached that the little while ago so if
[47:55] if you don't get anything more out of
[47:58] that than you got the first time then at
[48:00] least be my aiming corner okay
[48:04] johnny levin and we're gonna read from
[48:08] verse 41 don't 11:41 the end i took away
[48:22] the stone from the place where the date
[48:23] was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes
[48:25] and said father I thank thee that thou
[48:28] has heard me and I knew that there here
[48:30] is me always but because of the people
[48:32] which stand why I said it that they may
[48:34] believe that they are sent me and we
[48:37] need thus spoken he cried with a loud
[48:38] voice Lazarus come forth and he that was
[48:43] dead came forth bound hand and foot with
[48:45] grave clothes and his face was bound

[48:49] them blue seam and licking go loose him
[48:52] and let him go have we lost the power
[48:58] point okay no problem so I'm just gonna
[49:01] hone in on that on that verse 43 and we
[49:05] need a dust spoke and he cried with a
[49:06] loud voice Lazarus come forth let's just
[49:10] pray one more time maybe as we pray this
[49:16] morning if you ever need on your heart

[50:20] and sisters into your hands this morning
[50:21] and private in the wonderful name of our
[50:23] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may take
[50:26] your seats
[50:29] but I mean is it okay if I take my
[50:32] jacket off
[50:41] hate me
[50:52] is this thing working not quite okay
[50:58] here we go so there's that vest right
[51:01] look at price the world so now we can
[51:04] relax not too much so you fall asleep I
[51:07] mean especially the young ones that were
[51:10] so busy yesterday
[51:11] I understand they they had to get up at
[51:14] 5 o'clock in the morning the Dinkelman
[51:16] so good on you my god biess you for
[51:18] those things so now brother branham
[51:22] speaks about how that that voice that
[51:24] rose lazarus from the date was the voice
[51:27] of the resurrection thank you very much
[51:28] ramela was the voice of the resurrection
[51:31] and how that voice had all the power of
[51:36] heaven behind it now brother Branham
[51:38] speaks about how it's it's not physical
[51:40] power it's the it's the authority like
[51:42] that young policeman like you see the
[51:44] thin little scrawny policeman with a cap
[51:46] hanging over his eyes and so forth but
[51:48] we need put his hand up I mean those big
[51:50] cars have to stop it's the same thing
[51:52] when Jesus stood they I mean he was not
[51:55] much to look at I mean the Bible speaks
[51:57] about not no beauty that we should
[51:58] desire him and so forth but when he
[52:00] spoke I mean all that although all of
[52:03] heaven was behind him and nothing can
[52:06] stop his voice I mean nothing can stop
[52:08] his word from coming to pass and we
[52:10] thank the Lord for that brother Brennan
[52:12] makes the statement he says I believe
[52:14] brother if he hadn't have called him
[52:16] specifically by the name of Lazarus I
[52:19] believe the general resurrection would
[52:20] have spiked in place I mean that's how
[52:22] much power there was in the voice I mean
[52:24] if he just said come forth I mean then
[52:26] all the graves would have come forth I
[52:27] mean that's what I think about him
[52:29] brother Branham says that's right I
[52:31] believe the resurrection of every date
[52:33] thing that ever died would have come out
[52:35] of the grave if they had just said come
[52:37] forth yes sir
[52:38] but he called Lazarus come forth I mean
[52:41] in this morning I'm titling this Lazarus
[52:43] come forth and that voice is called
[52:45] Lazarus by name that same voice is
[52:47] calling us by night in fact the same
[52:49] voice is called us by name I mean and
[52:51] that is when when we get the revelation
[52:54] of who we are that's that voice I mean
[52:56] getting through to us so that we are
[52:59] called by name and respond and we thank
[53:01] God for those things hallelujah but
[53:04] that's how much power the
[53:06] in the word now our brother branham
[53:08] specifically links that voice that calls
[53:11] Lazarus Lazarus out of the grave with
[53:13] the voice of the rapture and I'm just
[53:15] I'm gonna have a few calls in in in
[53:17] between year this morning and I'll trust
[53:19] you you enjoy quotes I'm gonna shout and
[53:22] then a voice and then a trumpet chat and
[53:24] Mason Jay getting the people ready the
[53:26] second I remember these things because
[53:28] I'm gonna spend a bit of time on it
[53:30] so first shot the messenger getting the
[53:32] people ready second is a voice of the
[53:34] resurrection the same voice a loud voice
[53:37] and sanjana live and that's what we just
[53:39] read that called Lazarus from the grave
[53:40] getting the bride together and then the
[53:42] resurrection of the dead sea to be
[53:44] caught up with it now watch the three
[53:46] things takes place the next is what was
[53:48] a trumpet a voice this is a shot a voice
[53:52] and a trumpet but what I want to hone in
[53:54] they he speaks when he speaks of that
[53:55] voice I mean he says it's the same voice
[53:57] that grows Lazarus from the date that's
[54:00] the same voice that you and I have heard
[54:02] that voice that rose Lazarus there's
[54:06] another place in the Bible and brother
[54:08] Branham refers to that quite often
[54:10] another loud voice and that loud voice
[54:13] was when Jesus I mean died on the cross
[54:16] and he cried out with a loud voice and
[54:18] so on but then there's other instances
[54:20] in the Bible many beautiful places and
[54:23] we read a number of places in in in in
[54:25] the Book of Revelations we with John
[54:27] pins down I heard behind me a voice and
[54:31] so for various places that it refers to
[54:33] voice but there's two specific ones I
[54:35] want to also include you revelation
[54:38] chapter five now we're talking opening
[54:41] of the seals happening now and I saw a
[54:43] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[54:44] voice who is worthy to open the book
[54:47] loud voice that same voice then you have
[54:53] I'm sorry revelations chapter 10 which
[54:56] we know so well again that angel came
[54:59] down and cried with a loud voice as when
[55:01] the lion ruler roarer that's the voice
[55:04] we've heard I mean and that voice calls
[55:09] the seven thunders to otta
[55:11] I'm just kind of really having to rein
[55:14] myself in here because I don't want to
[55:15] run I hate too much
[55:18] yeah brother branham speaks about these
[55:20] things and and he links it all to the
[55:22] voice of the resurrection and he makes
[55:25] the statement in Revelation chapter 4
[55:28] part 1 it is the same voice that
[55:30] summoned John come up the same voice and
[55:32] say to John come up is the same voice
[55:34] that will summons the church someday
[55:36] summons the church also the same voice
[55:38] that summoned John to come up is the
[55:40] same voice that summons dead Lazarus out
[55:42] of the grave that same voice of the
[55:44] Archangel it's the same voice that voice
[55:47] that life-giving voice but that voice
[55:51] that takes us from death into life
[55:53] hallelujah from temporal into eternal
[55:56] from part into fullness amen so now I
[56:05] know that we are very familiar with
[56:06] these things but but I'm just gonna kind
[56:08] of take it slow in and and just be Who I
[56:12] am and just relax and it lifts the Lord
[56:14] just kind of open these things so please
[56:17] don't think for a moment I'm kind I'm
[56:19] kind of under estimating you or nothing
[56:21] like this but I'm just gonna kind of
[56:23] slowly work my way through these things
[56:25] just because I'm so rejoicing in these
[56:27] things at the moment there's laws he's
[56:28] opening it so we had that quote and we
[56:32] know these things very well I mean about
[56:34] the the the three parts of the rapturing
[56:38] process and we read that in 1
[56:39] Thessalonians I mean brother Branham
[56:41] referred to it and I'm just gonna focus
[56:43] on it again quickly for the Lord himself
[56:45] shall be seen from heaven with a shout
[56:46] with the voice of the Archangel and the
[56:49] Trump of God shut voice trumpet I mean
[56:51] very clear biblical background for those
[56:54] things so now I'm going to continue the
[56:57] others path of shout voice trumpet for a
[56:59] little bit what was the shot brother
[57:03] emcees it's a messenger the voice that
[57:06] has a message that means so so I let me
[57:09] not confuse things yet okay it's the
[57:12] shot we way God speaks through the
[57:15] messenger to reveal himself to the bride
[57:19] so so to put it bluntly I believe with
[57:23] all my heart that the message we've
[57:25] heard via the Prophet is that shirt
[57:30] I'll put it stronger than that I'll say
[57:32] I believe with all my heart the message
[57:35] that we've heard is the initiation or
[57:38] the first part of the rapture process so
[57:43] now it's the voice where the Ramseys is
[57:46] that same voice now in the bride that
[57:50] same message becoming alive in a bride
[57:54] now I'm gonna say it's the same shout
[57:57] but now it's in bride form it's no
[57:59] longer just in messenger form so now as
[58:02] that message becomes alive in our lives
[58:05] we've got to become the voice and and
[58:09] when I say it that way it's so easy to
[58:11] get under some impression that I have to
[58:14] manufacture something or I have to do
[58:16] something no it's his voice you see like
[58:20] when Jesus stood there all power of
[58:21] heaven was behind him it's that what I'm
[58:23] talking about it's not the vessel it's
[58:25] not us hallelujah and then the Trump I
[58:28] mean that finality of the rapturing
[58:30] process the body changing the the bride
[58:32] taking to the marriage feast and going
[58:34] on to reign with him and so on so now
[58:37] when we listen to the Seventh Seal
[58:38] message and this is this is coming to
[58:41] the things that that over the last few
[58:43] years have just really been such a
[58:44] blessing to me brother Branham makes a
[58:47] statement be that initially really
[58:50] confused me and yes I know I'm slow but
[58:54] you know what when these things just
[58:56] fall into place is so beautiful brother
[58:58] Adam starts preaching the Seventh Seal
[59:00] now I know this this debates around the
[59:03] message stories the Seventh Seal open
[59:05] isn't it open and so on and so on and
[59:07] it's just so much India that that's
[59:10] that's so beautiful of how how I'll just
[59:14] say it I it's it's pressing on my heart
[59:17] to say it the Seventh Seal is him the
[59:22] Seventh Seal is gone and and and I trust
[59:28] this is okay brother Ben but feel free
[59:29] to correct me afterwards if you don't
[59:32] agree but I believe that when revelation
[59:36] Steen came down what it speaks of is the
[59:39] seventh seal stepping down
[59:41] with a book in his hand and the Seventh
[59:45] Seal was actually the first one that
[59:47] opened because for the Seventh Seal for
[59:53] Jesus Christ to come down and open the
[59:55] seals he had to be here he had to have
[59:59] the six Scrolls in his hand
[1:00:01] and I and I know this is strong
[1:00:03] statements and I really hope this
[1:00:05] doesn't upset anyone that I trusted
[1:00:07] she's okay brother Ben but but there's
[1:00:09] so many principles in the Bible so many
[1:00:13] places and I don't want to take too much
[1:00:15] time because that's not really what I
[1:00:16] want to focus on this morning but just
[1:00:18] type after type after type after type
[1:00:21] and for me probably the most beautiful
[1:00:23] one is that woman at the well the
[1:00:26] seventh seal came to her and sat next to
[1:00:30] her and revealed to her she had five
[1:00:34] husbands and she's now with a 6-1 the
[1:00:37] seventh revealed to her that they six
[1:00:39] the seventh the the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:00:42] was open to her and showed her her
[1:00:45] natural part has six her man path has
[1:00:48] six steals the seventh seal reveals the
[1:00:51] six seals I mean I'll just leave that
[1:00:54] there I don't wanna I don't want to
[1:00:56] spend too much time but I trust that's
[1:00:57] okay so now brother Branham makes his
[1:01:00] statement in the seventh see when he
[1:01:02] preaches it now and he sees no can you
[1:01:09] roll on that slide I don't know what's
[1:01:11] happening he says and now as certain as
[1:01:17] I stand in a platform tonight
[1:01:19] I had the revelation that revealed it's
[1:01:22] in a three-fold manner a seventh seal
[1:01:25] nails in a three-fold manner and then he
[1:01:27] says I will speak to you by God's help
[1:01:30] of a fold of it so it's three fold three
[1:01:35] parts three whatever you want to call it
[1:01:37] of the seventh seal and then brother
[1:01:40] Branham says I am going to speak to you
[1:01:42] about the first part of the seventh seal
[1:01:45] the first fold of it and then brother
[1:01:49] Branham starts speaking about the baby
[1:01:52] shoe
[1:01:54] and the dreams and his own ministry and
[1:02:01] when I first read that it was I thought
[1:02:06] he was gonna speak about this evil see
[1:02:07] you now but he's speaking about his own
[1:02:10] ministry what's happening I mean what
[1:02:14] was the shout again I think the message
[1:02:18] that went forth when the Prophet was
[1:02:21] speaking about what when he was breaking
[1:02:23] the Seventh Seal what I was showing is
[1:02:25] the first part of the Seventh Seal is
[1:02:28] the shirt I believe when brother Branham
[1:02:35] was preaching the civil seal I mean he
[1:02:38] was opening the fact that the Seventh
[1:02:40] Seal is exactly the same thing because
[1:02:42] what is the Seventh Seal it's Christ its
[1:02:46] Christ descending it's Christ coming
[1:02:49] down in person and marrying a wife which
[1:02:55] is none other than the rapture process
[1:02:57] the first fold of the rapture process is
[1:03:00] what a shot he comes down so now when he
[1:03:04] opens the civil seal we often look for
[1:03:06] something that's so difficult and so
[1:03:08] hard and mysterious and out of reach and
[1:03:10] so forth and yes it is to the to the to
[1:03:12] the wise and prudent I mean but but God
[1:03:15] has opened these things to us and it is
[1:03:16] so simple and it is so I want to say
[1:03:19] intellectually not not out of reach for
[1:03:22] us and the youngest ones of us can
[1:03:24] understand these things because it's not
[1:03:26] difficult understanding wise but if your
[1:03:31] eyes are closed if we haven't received
[1:03:33] the ear to hear we can never get those
[1:03:36] things hallelujah now I'm just gonna I'm
[1:03:45] just gonna labor day for a moment I want
[1:03:47] to make it very very very clear like
[1:03:50] what brother Branham was doing these he
[1:03:52] was linking the Seventh Seal very very
[1:03:55] clearly with the rapture process and it
[1:03:59] is it is not something that is
[1:04:00] conceptually out of reach because like I
[1:04:03] said it is a bridegroom coming
[1:04:06] and our bridegroom in his descending he
[1:04:10] does it with a shout voice and a trumpet
[1:04:14] so I guess just to be very blunt about
[1:04:19] it what would be the second fold of the
[1:04:22] 7cu the voice what would be the third
[1:04:26] fold of the 7cu the Trump I mean now in
[1:04:31] that wonderful wonderful sermon Christ
[1:04:33] is the mystery of God revealed brother
[1:04:34] Branham he also makes amazing statements
[1:04:39] and I and I want to ask you the question
[1:04:40] what's the thrust of that sermon the
[1:04:44] thrust of the whole crisis the mystery
[1:04:46] Germany's God has a three-fold purpose I
[1:04:48] mean and and I just want to stop there
[1:04:51] for a moment what was was that purpose
[1:04:54] just suddenly something that God thought
[1:04:56] that that God wake up one morning and
[1:04:58] say this is a great idea Eureka
[1:05:00] I mean God doesn't have Eureka moments I
[1:05:03] mean when something is God's purpose it
[1:05:05] always was God's purpose it eternal II
[1:05:08] was because remember eternity goes back
[1:05:11] and it eternally will be his purpose and
[1:05:13] and brother Branham showed us the
[1:05:15] three-fold purpose of God and if we if
[1:05:18] we really put some emphasis on that the
[1:05:20] the the eternal purpose of God I will
[1:05:23] call it that that three-fold purpose of
[1:05:25] God that is his reason for existence
[1:05:28] that's his purpose that's what he wanted
[1:05:30] to achieve that's what he wanted to see
[1:05:33] that's what he wanted to fellowship with
[1:05:38] now remember it's Christ is the mystery
[1:05:42] of God revealed
[1:05:43] what's Christ is the anointing it's the
[1:05:46] life of God it's a life behind the word
[1:05:49] and of course we know these things I
[1:05:53] know this is really simple teaching but
[1:05:55] what's the first purpose Christ
[1:05:58] revealing himself to the bride second
[1:06:02] purpose him getting preeminence in his
[1:06:05] bride third purpose restoring it back to
[1:06:09] Eden restoring the kingdom and so forth
[1:06:11] now I'll just say it this way how did
[1:06:15] God reveal himself in this way that
[1:06:18] first purpose
[1:06:19] revealing himself how did God reveal
[1:06:21] himself in this day
[1:06:23] well a little Kentuckian went onto a
[1:06:26] platform and said remember when I
[1:06:30] preached to you sir is this a time I
[1:06:34] mean and he made statements like those
[1:06:36] things were prophecy but it's near
[1:06:38] history that little Kentuckian
[1:06:42] I mean reveal to us who God is that
[1:06:46] little Kentuckian took this word that
[1:06:50] was ink on paper and he might this will
[1:06:53] alive so that this word can now walk
[1:06:56] around I mean and we can all be this
[1:06:58] word and we become that way so what am i
[1:07:02] doing now Christ is the mystery three
[1:07:05] fold purpose the first purpose was the
[1:07:08] shot the first purpose was God making
[1:07:11] himself known and he made himself known
[1:07:13] like I said through elisa messenger he
[1:07:16] lisa is what get me a bride i mean get
[1:07:19] me right i'm coming down you know i'm
[1:07:21] gonna meet her I mean but give me a
[1:07:23] bride ready prepare that bride I mean
[1:07:25] and the bride is prepared in that
[1:07:27] threefold process hallelujah
[1:07:30] I mean so in the bride now receives this
[1:07:33] message now I'm taking you back to
[1:07:35] revelations Tina what does the bride to
[1:07:37] do she eats the book when she eats the
[1:07:41] book she what you are what you eat
[1:07:44] I mean spiritually speaking you are what
[1:07:46] you eat I mean we're not supposed to
[1:07:49] become youtube we're not supposed to
[1:07:51] become the internet we're not supposed
[1:07:54] to be anti Google we're supposed to grow
[1:07:57] into the world you are what you eat I
[1:08:00] mean this bride is this bride will be
[1:08:05] Eagles and Eagles will feed on eagle
[1:08:08] food I mean and that's what we eat and
[1:08:11] what's happening now is when this bride
[1:08:13] now receives through ILI's of the word
[1:08:16] that he sent to reveal himself I mean
[1:08:19] this bride now becomes that word so
[1:08:22] what's the second part of the threefold
[1:08:24] purpose the voice the second part is him
[1:08:29] getting preeminence in us I mean
[1:08:33] him being the main one us becoming him
[1:08:38] oh that I need to qualify some of these
[1:08:42] things lace of self and more of him
[1:08:44] dying to self relating Christ lived
[1:08:47] through us hallelujah and then of course
[1:08:50] the last portion of that is brother
[1:08:51] Ramses and when she really knows who she
[1:08:54] is the rapture will go I mean which is
[1:08:57] what the trumpet part I mean hallelujah
[1:09:00] back to Eden that's the third purpose I
[1:09:03] mean so he reveals himself to us he gets
[1:09:06] preeminence in us and then it takes a
[1:09:09] song which is exactly the rapture
[1:09:10] process again which is exactly the
[1:09:12] Seventh Seal again so now there's a few
[1:09:15] things that that started opening up to
[1:09:18] me that that I just and as I say I know
[1:09:20] I'm slowing and I just trusted you're
[1:09:22] awake enough to stay with me and that we
[1:09:25] can just rejoice in these things this
[1:09:26] morning so the shirt was revealing the
[1:09:31] bridegroom was relieved was revealing
[1:09:35] the Seventh Seal which is the revelation
[1:09:38] of the second coming like I said which
[1:09:40] is the revelation of the ravaging
[1:09:42] process which is the revelation of the
[1:09:45] fullness of the word the threefold
[1:09:49] purpose and the rapture and the seventh
[1:09:52] seal is exactly the same event in fact
[1:09:57] is exactly the same person and it's
[1:10:01] expressed in three folds and those folds
[1:10:03] are sharp voice trumpet now it becomes
[1:10:09] clearer to me everyday how it seems like
[1:10:13] every pretty near every major sermon
[1:10:15] brother Branham preached after the seals
[1:10:18] was on one thing and that was on the
[1:10:22] seventh seal pretty near every sermon he
[1:10:25] preached was along these lines him
[1:10:28] coming down him being here the presence
[1:10:31] of God unrecognized all those things him
[1:10:33] actually making known to us hey hang on
[1:10:36] it was not just a Kentuckian that was
[1:10:38] here there was more he was preaching who
[1:10:41] is this Melchizedek I mean he was
[1:10:43] preaching all those things
[1:10:45] he's prison here I mean recognize the
[1:10:47] sign of the Messiah was performed how
[1:10:49] many times were the sign of the Messiah
[1:10:51] performed in the past every time the
[1:10:53] sign of the Messiah was was performed it
[1:10:55] was showing Melchizedek was here the
[1:10:57] first time was what when he came to
[1:11:00] Abraham Sarah behind him in the teen the
[1:11:03] second time what Jesus was here on earth
[1:11:05] he says yes you had six husbands and so
[1:11:08] forth or Peter I know you you've used
[1:11:11] your father's name is Jonas and so forth
[1:11:13] I mean the sign of the Messiah and that
[1:11:15] same sign of the Messiah was performed
[1:11:16] again in this day saying what I mean
[1:11:19] this year again
[1:11:21] I mean Messiah Melchizedek is here again
[1:11:23] the same word is here again I wanna say
[1:11:26] the same fullness of the word is here
[1:11:28] again hallelujah I mean so the shout
[1:11:32] really was the open Word of God
[1:11:33] expressed through the seventh angel
[1:11:36] messenger first but then becoming alive
[1:11:39] in us hallelujah I put it this way the
[1:11:43] shout was the son of man revealing
[1:11:46] himself firstly through a son of man
[1:11:52] hallelujah now I'm gonna just say this
[1:11:56] is me this is how I understand it and
[1:11:58] this is how I believe it but really I
[1:12:01] believe the son of man ministry I mean
[1:12:04] was really only the third pole part of
[1:12:07] brother branham's ministry yeast his lap
[1:12:10] over period and so forth but when he
[1:12:12] started breaking that word he moved on
[1:12:16] into death eagle anointing he moved on
[1:12:19] into the seventh seal so to speak the
[1:12:24] first and second pools were partly under
[1:12:27] a man anointing under a church age
[1:12:29] dispensation
[1:12:31] but the third pole goes further now
[1:12:33] remember I'm not saying later Decius
[1:12:35] finish don't get me wrong but I believe
[1:12:37] as he's pulling us into him as he's
[1:12:40] becoming one with his bride now remember
[1:12:41] brother Ramses the marriage takes place
[1:12:43] here I mean and as we becoming one with
[1:12:46] him we are now in a bride age I mean
[1:12:48] because he's not calling us Church
[1:12:50] anymore he's calling us bride but what
[1:12:52] the churches are still in the church age
[1:12:54] I mean so I'm not saying we dine
[1:12:57] I'm not saying we're in the Millennium
[1:12:58] now I'm not saying we know glorified
[1:13:00] bodies now I'd be very disappointed if
[1:13:02] that was the case I mean but the reality
[1:13:04] is we are no longer in laodicea these
[1:13:08] people around us that's in later this
[1:13:10] year but we have been called higher
[1:13:12] he said come up higher John I mean and
[1:13:15] John represented the bride and he said
[1:13:17] come up higher come into me come become
[1:13:19] one with me I've got more for you than I
[1:13:21] have for the laborers I've got more for
[1:13:24] you than I have for the Gleaners I've
[1:13:25] got more for you than I have for all
[1:13:27] those people out in working in your
[1:13:29] vineyards and stuff you are mine and I
[1:13:31] am yours and this is what we have and
[1:13:33] the race doesn't matter I mean that's
[1:13:36] what God is saying to this bride and
[1:13:37] he's revealing it to the bride
[1:13:39] but he's revealing it in simplicity and
[1:13:41] he revealed it and he started that
[1:13:43] process through a little Kentuckian who
[1:13:46] who grew up with a bad name because of
[1:13:50] his family because of his father's
[1:13:51] alcohol problem and so forth had really
[1:13:53] no religious background whatsoever and
[1:13:55] people would pull their noses up and say
[1:13:57] best guy he doesn't even have a he
[1:14:00] hardly has a seventh grade education how
[1:14:02] can he do this and that's the point God
[1:14:05] doesn't need our intellect
[1:14:07] I mean God doesn't meet our abilities
[1:14:10] God needs only our availability
[1:14:13] I mean God only needs us to die so
[1:14:16] completely to self so that he can be
[1:14:19] glorified in us so that he can use us
[1:14:21] and so that he can get the glory so that
[1:14:23] we not bigshots
[1:14:24] so it's not this big preacher or this
[1:14:26] big brother or this big sister or
[1:14:28] nothing like that so that God can be
[1:14:30] lifted up because he said if I be lifted
[1:14:32] up I will draw all men unto me
[1:14:34] hallelujah I mean I believe that third
[1:14:38] pole was the Eagle anointing or
[1:14:41] laypeople at this place
[1:14:43] this this way I believe at the third
[1:14:45] pole that Eagle anointing was fully in
[1:14:48] place and it was really completely now
[1:14:53] present in Word form now I just want to
[1:14:59] place the emphasis slightly different to
[1:15:02] start making a point now so I'll ask
[1:15:05] again
[1:15:05] be with me what was the shirt
[1:15:09] the message that means forth now I'll
[1:15:13] ask you this question now what was the
[1:15:16] message was the message
[1:15:19] the little Kentuckian was the message i
[1:15:22] mean was the Stander's hallelujah a
[1:15:27] little Kentucky and speaking for a week
[1:15:32] long in March 1963 yes and no because
[1:15:39] yes God used that vessel to express
[1:15:41] himself through yes that was the ELISA
[1:15:43] that God spoke those things through but
[1:15:45] the reality is it wasn't his voice it
[1:15:50] wasn't his ideas in fact brother Brahim
[1:15:52] said himself he said I would have had it
[1:15:54] completely wrong but the angel came and
[1:15:56] it was he's where that was expressed I
[1:15:59] mean so yes in one way it was brother
[1:16:02] Brennan because he was the vessel that
[1:16:03] God was using but the word the
[1:16:05] inspiration the life came from something
[1:16:07] different I mean and that was that
[1:16:09] Melchizedek that was the god behind him
[1:16:12] what's the voice well the same thing is
[1:16:15] that same message now in a bride
[1:16:17] I mean and as this bride eats the book I
[1:16:20] mean like I said we become the word but
[1:16:22] the bride is of this age is coming to
[1:16:24] maturity I mean and we're getting a
[1:16:27] personal revelation of the same message
[1:16:29] that brother Branham got I mean and and
[1:16:31] brother Branham according to some of
[1:16:33] those testimonies he made the statement
[1:16:35] that he says I've got to get out of the
[1:16:37] way so that you can come up to where I
[1:16:39] am I mean God that you take now brother
[1:16:42] Andy I loved I just loved hell the more
[1:16:45] the Lord was preaching this morning
[1:16:46] through the songs and things already I
[1:16:48] was so rejoicing when I when I heard
[1:16:50] those things that it was a brother
[1:16:51] Hadley riff referred to I think it was
[1:16:54] he referred to the the wife sheaf Jesus
[1:16:57] was our wife she the firstborn of many
[1:16:59] brethren
[1:17:00] but in our die also I believe it would
[1:17:03] be al-qaeda to say that we've had a wave
[1:17:06] sheaf brother branham was the first one
[1:17:08] in this die to count to come to this
[1:17:10] bride age if I can call it maturity I
[1:17:13] mean but we he came to he lives that
[1:17:15] example I mean but we're not trying to
[1:17:18] be like brother Burnham I mean we want
[1:17:20] to be like God we want his life with us
[1:17:22] I'm
[1:17:22] but he's the first wave sheaf that came
[1:17:25] to maturity in this age and there's a
[1:17:27] whole crop to follow I mean the wave
[1:17:29] sheaf was just the first one but by
[1:17:31] God's grace this whole crop that follows
[1:17:34] hallelujah
[1:17:35] so now this bride is supposed to come to
[1:17:38] exactly the same position I mean we can
[1:17:41] so easily say who is this Melchizedek
[1:17:43] well mecki mecki ascetic was day in 1963
[1:17:46] 1964 1965 whenever it was I mean and and
[1:17:50] and he turned his back to the to the
[1:17:52] congregation and so forth
[1:17:53] know that say Melchizedek is here I mean
[1:17:57] but same with that same person that same
[1:17:59] Christ that I mean he's in the process
[1:18:02] of descending I mean that same Christ is
[1:18:05] now living through a many men but bride
[1:18:07] and whereas in the time of Jesus I mean
[1:18:11] he was expressing himself through a
[1:18:13] virgin born vessel now he's expressing
[1:18:16] himself through redeemed vessels
[1:18:18] hallelujah and he is the message God is
[1:18:23] the message I mean he's the voice he's
[1:18:28] the life it's not of ourselves so I ask
[1:18:32] you this question and I've already
[1:18:34] answered that I know and I mean this is
[1:18:36] not as if this is new to you now but
[1:18:38] he's the bride the voice alongside like
[1:18:41] brother Branham yes and learn because we
[1:18:44] are the vessels but again the voice the
[1:18:48] true voice the true life I mean he's him
[1:18:50] behind us is that simon cassidy so who's
[1:18:56] the one that shouts and who's the one
[1:18:58] that is the voice and for that matter
[1:19:00] who is the one that that blows the
[1:19:02] trumpet I mean you see he said in 1
[1:19:06] Thessalonians he said I will be Saint I
[1:19:09] will be same in a sharp voice trumpet
[1:19:13] brother branham axe is very very
[1:19:15] well-known statement can I have the next
[1:19:17] slide please
[1:19:19] three things happens a voice is a voice
[1:19:22] a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen
[1:19:24] before Jesus appears now shut Jesus does
[1:19:27] all three of them when he's descending
[1:19:31] in the process of dissension
[1:19:35] in his second coming in his second son
[1:19:42] of man coming put it this way I mean he
[1:19:45] does all three things he shouts he's the
[1:19:50] voice in the bride the voice of the
[1:19:52] Archangel and he blows the trumpet calls
[1:19:55] us back now when I ask you another
[1:19:59] question we read that portion about
[1:20:03] Lazarus when Jesus was standing there
[1:20:06] calling Lazarus out of the grave who was
[1:20:10] it was it Jesus well yes because Jesus
[1:20:18] is the name of God but I'm asking you
[1:20:19] really more specifically was it that man
[1:20:22] Jesus that was standing there no he did
[1:20:27] not have physical power in that frail
[1:20:29] body to be able to call Lazarus out of
[1:20:32] the grave it was the life of God that
[1:20:34] anointed that body that call letters out
[1:20:38] of the grave so I'll put it this way it
[1:20:40] was the voice behind the voice I mean
[1:20:43] like we're seeing in that Jubilee song I
[1:20:46] mean it's the voice behind the voice in
[1:20:50] the time of Jesus it was the voice of
[1:20:52] the behind the voice it wasn't the flesh
[1:20:53] part I mean it wasn't the flesh part
[1:20:56] that rosary Lazarus it was the god that
[1:20:58] indwelt that vessel I mean so now again
[1:21:01] I want to ask you this question I mean
[1:21:03] when the shot went for senior died like
[1:21:06] I said was it brother Bram was it the
[1:21:09] little Kentuckian yes and no but the
[1:21:11] reality is the the life behind it I mean
[1:21:14] the voice behind the voice that's what
[1:21:16] called us
[1:21:17] I mean hallelujah we have a voice behind
[1:21:21] the voice but we received it as a shout
[1:21:24] and I trust this is not going to confuse
[1:21:25] you I'll get to that in a little bit if
[1:21:27] you don't you should just hang on
[1:21:30] now now I'm gonna ask this doesn't it
[1:21:36] sound like I'm confusing the shout and
[1:21:38] the voice now I mean so I'm just gonna I
[1:21:43] just want to share a few things just to
[1:21:45] kind of place that a little bit but
[1:21:48] just be with me it was God's voice
[1:21:51] speaking at the time of Lazarus it was
[1:21:56] God's voice speaking through the prophet
[1:21:58] and it's now God's voice speaking again
[1:22:03] can I have the next slide we read the in
[1:22:08] Revelations thing and cried with a loud
[1:22:09] voice as when a lion roar I mean II had
[1:22:12] cried seven thunders uttered their
[1:22:14] voices so now what's happening here is
[1:22:19] this is the shout this is the shot this
[1:22:25] is the son of man expressing through a
[1:22:29] son of man in 1963 the opening of the
[1:22:32] seven seals but yet it says voices
[1:22:37] because what's voice is God speaking
[1:22:39] I mean it's God's voice is God's Word
[1:22:42] this expression of God's will so now
[1:22:46] when brother Branham was speaking it
[1:22:48] wasn't him speaking as a man it was God
[1:22:51] speaking we were hearing God's voice we
[1:22:54] were hearing the heavenly angel speaking
[1:22:56] through that vessel and that verse when
[1:22:59] it speaks of like I said when it speaks
[1:23:00] of that seven thunders uttered a voices
[1:23:02] it was God's mystery behind the things
[1:23:06] that was actually just spoken through a
[1:23:08] voice of a vessel there was a voice
[1:23:11] behind the shout and the voice was God
[1:23:14] speaking is that clear enough
[1:23:16] I trust that that's very simple so now
[1:23:19] when I also read a second part of a
[1:23:21] quote I had earlier I'm just going to
[1:23:26] quickly run through the first part the
[1:23:28] same voice that summoned John come up
[1:23:29] it's the same voice that all summons to
[1:23:30] church Sunday is the same voice as
[1:23:32] summons did Lazarus so then he sees
[1:23:34] Christ is the voice of the Archangel now
[1:23:40] remember Christ is the mystery of God
[1:23:42] reveal him he's anointing his word his
[1:23:47] life is descending but he is the life
[1:23:52] behind it I mean with hallelujah we are
[1:23:57] now mrs. Jesus Christ when we get in
[1:24:00] that union with him
[1:24:01] and he is the voice the power the life
[1:24:06] behind the name is that song he's the
[1:24:08] life behind the name I mean it's the
[1:24:10] life behind the name I mean it's his
[1:24:12] life behind us and we are now mrs. Jesus
[1:24:15] Christ we bury same name and it's the
[1:24:17] same life behind us I mean it's the same
[1:24:20] voice of the resurrection that's
[1:24:22] expressed through us now I mean so then
[1:24:27] what about the voice paths I mean we've
[1:24:30] spoken about the shell so now that same
[1:24:32] Christ is now living in a mini man but
[1:24:34] bride I mean and and and brother branham
[1:24:36] at that reason and he and he and he
[1:24:38] spoke about I'll write this trial once
[1:24:40] more I'll write this trail once more now
[1:24:44] now we did we write it in our generation
[1:24:47] he wrote it through the Prophet he wrote
[1:24:51] it through the shout part but the same
[1:24:53] life that same person that same God he's
[1:24:56] now writing this trial now in the bride
[1:24:59] he's here that same voice that same word
[1:25:03] is now expressing himself I mean now
[1:25:05] through a mini man but bride this time
[1:25:09] through redeemed vessels I mean how can
[1:25:11] we be worthy how can we ever be worthy
[1:25:14] how can we ever offer our vessels to God
[1:25:17] if it was not for the blood of the Lamb
[1:25:20] I mean if he did not cross the breach
[1:25:22] that's why we need a breach before we
[1:25:24] can have I mean the seals revealed where
[1:25:26] he needed to cross the bridge in order
[1:25:28] to be able to make the path open so that
[1:25:30] we could become one with him we could
[1:25:32] never cross that bridge from outside we
[1:25:34] could never merit anything we could
[1:25:36] never offer him anything we could never
[1:25:38] bribe him we could never convince him we
[1:25:40] could never meet him halfway he provided
[1:25:42] everything he crossed the breach I mean
[1:25:44] and he made the way I mean we were just
[1:25:47] in caught up in church ages man ages and
[1:25:51] so forth but he made the way to bring us
[1:25:54] into the ego age
[1:25:57] hallelujah he is now reflecting himself
[1:26:00] through mini redeem vessel vessels now
[1:26:04] the same voice I mean like I said the
[1:26:08] same God that expressed himself through
[1:26:10] the shaft he's now the voice behind this
[1:26:13] list behind this voice behind our voices
[1:26:16] so now I want to ask you another
[1:26:20] question
[1:26:22] he's the shout pass things brother
[1:26:28] Brahim is deep that vessel is gone and I
[1:26:33] know this is a trick question
[1:26:36] the shout is the voice calling out to a
[1:26:42] bride the shout is the ill either call
[1:26:45] the shout is go find a wife now these
[1:26:53] members of the bride that hasn't heard
[1:26:54] the shout yet but they not mostly that
[1:26:59] it's sometimes happen but most of them
[1:27:00] don't just go onto internet and randomly
[1:27:02] start listening to brother bands
[1:27:04] messages and hear through thee most of
[1:27:08] the time they hear through you through
[1:27:10] me and when you speak to them as a
[1:27:14] member of the bride they are hearing the
[1:27:15] shaft they are hearing the ill either
[1:27:18] call you understand what I'm saying so
[1:27:21] this is not trying to bring some weird
[1:27:22] new doctrine and confusing shout voice
[1:27:24] trumpet but what I'm saying to you is
[1:27:26] the process of us receiving the call is
[1:27:29] the sharp the process of of him
[1:27:33] revealing to to us who he is is the seer
[1:27:36] is the shot what God is doing this
[1:27:39] morning through the ministry he's
[1:27:42] shouting he's revealing who he is but
[1:27:45] first part I mean of the three fault
[1:27:47] purpose and when you now go home and you
[1:27:51] and you think about these things and
[1:27:53] those things become alive in your life
[1:27:55] then you become the voice then you
[1:27:57] become the shout again for the next
[1:27:59] person I mean that's the whole process
[1:28:01] of disciple I mean we everyone come up
[1:28:04] to maturity and then is able to pass on
[1:28:07] the seed again I mean because we come
[1:28:09] into that side
[1:28:10] process so to answer my own question I
[1:28:13] mean the shot is not past I mean it's
[1:28:16] still shouting it's still calling I mean
[1:28:18] and I believe it will continue to come
[1:28:20] until the last one is in hallelujah the
[1:28:26] shot is not limited to books and types
[1:28:29] the shot is not limited I mean to do a
[1:28:33] stack of mp3s or a SD card the shot is
[1:28:36] not limited to that God is shouting and
[1:28:39] he's shouting through you and sometimes
[1:28:41] without you opening your mouth he shouts
[1:28:43] I mean sometimes why someone just
[1:28:46] looking at your life they become thirsty
[1:28:48] your life is speaking louder than your
[1:28:50] words sometimes I mean that's still
[1:28:53] shouting god is still shouting and what
[1:28:55] is it that shouting is not yuge not the
[1:28:58] vessel
[1:28:58] I mean it's God's a God that's living
[1:29:01] through the vessel is God that's
[1:29:02] manifesting himself through the vessel
[1:29:04] it's God getting preeminence in the
[1:29:06] vessel which is what the whole point of
[1:29:08] the second purpose I mean we received
[1:29:10] the shot but God comes and he gets
[1:29:12] preeminence in us hallelujah I mean and
[1:29:16] he becomes the boss brother and speaks
[1:29:20] so beautifully in that Christ is the
[1:29:22] mystery any any mic statements about
[1:29:24] about Paul the prisoner that's all under
[1:29:27] the shout path where we become
[1:29:31] completely subject to him and I'll just
[1:29:35] throw this in as a as a side comment
[1:29:37] many times we've suffered under under
[1:29:41] under hard hit chips and different
[1:29:43] things and naturally speaking we have a
[1:29:47] fear or a frustration or a complex or
[1:29:51] hurts associated with each other but
[1:29:57] headship is so crucial to our Christian
[1:30:00] walk because part of the show part of
[1:30:03] this voice process part of the second
[1:30:05] part of the three fold purpose is ask
[1:30:08] becoming completely subject to his
[1:30:10] nature hallelujah I just leave that day
[1:30:17] what's the purpose of the voice in the
[1:30:20] time of Lazarus the voice called him
[1:30:22] from the grave it awakened him in this
[1:30:27] day can I have that next quote please
[1:30:34] before the message calls the bride
[1:30:36] together see the shout and the at
[1:30:37] the same one he with a loud voice he
[1:30:39] screamed at with a shout and a voice and
[1:30:42] well as arose with a loud voice he cried
[1:30:44] Lazarus come forth and the voice wakes
[1:30:46] up the sleeping bride the sleeping did I
[1:30:49] mean it reminds you of that parable of
[1:30:51] the five foolish and the five wise
[1:30:53] virgins I mean and you know what they
[1:30:57] all heard the shout I all heard the
[1:31:01] message but only five of them had oil in
[1:31:05] the lamps only five of them had the
[1:31:07] complete rebirth experience only five of
[1:31:11] them was filled with the Holy Ghost part
[1:31:15] of that process so now these various
[1:31:19] avenues where I can go from here and I
[1:31:21] just want to focus on one particular
[1:31:23] direction some that is called wake up to
[1:31:33] this revelation I mean this is it this
[1:31:38] is what I've been waiting for this is
[1:31:40] what I've been made for I'm an eagle
[1:31:42] I've always been made to be an eagle and
[1:31:46] others might just see it as better
[1:31:50] doctrine a better explanation of the of
[1:31:53] the Bible
[1:31:54] a group of nice people or whatever it is
[1:31:57] and never become that voice hallelujah
[1:32:02] some wakes up to the revelation oh no
[1:32:05] I'm undone I don't have what I thought I
[1:32:08] did that voice goes forth to wake they
[1:32:13] brought up hallelujah and the voice I
[1:32:16] believe the purpose of the voice is to
[1:32:19] wake us up to the fact that the rapture
[1:32:21] is on the rapture broses is on the mere
[1:32:24] fact that the shot went forth showed the
[1:32:27] rapture is on the rapturing process if
[1:32:30] the
[1:32:31] stumbles you if I say the rep cheese on
[1:32:35] hallelujah now I'm just I'm just like
[1:32:39] bring these things please forgive me
[1:32:41] I'll just I'll just be myself but I'll
[1:32:46] ask again the shaft God revealing
[1:32:49] himself to his bride does God only use
[1:32:53] brother branham to do that no he doesn't
[1:32:55] he uses all sorts of vessels today I
[1:33:02] love her brother Brennan put CD and I
[1:33:05] think I had that quote before I'm just
[1:33:11] gonna read that last part when God when
[1:33:15] Jesus stood there any cold Lazarus he
[1:33:17] said he answered year mi and he come
[1:33:21] from the dead after he was dead in his
[1:33:23] body rotten when you hear that you think
[1:33:28] of Isaiah standing in the temple I mean
[1:33:32] and when when he was touched with a coil
[1:33:34] of fire I mean he responded saying Here
[1:33:37] I am Lord seeing me I mean when that
[1:33:40] voice of the Archangel really touches
[1:33:42] you I mean you really personally become
[1:33:45] a carrier of the light I mean you get
[1:33:48] the Commission not only brother Branham
[1:33:51] had a commission every member of the
[1:33:52] bride has a commission because what we
[1:33:54] carriers of the world we carriers of the
[1:33:57] most important possible thing that can
[1:34:00] ever be on this earth I mean hallelujah
[1:34:03] you might not be able to preach like I
[1:34:05] said but you can shine your light you
[1:34:08] can shine your lamp you can testify I
[1:34:10] mean and people around you can be
[1:34:12] thirsty because of the life you live
[1:34:14] before you we have bright bringing forth
[1:34:18] bright by the life of Christ being
[1:34:21] reflected through members of the bride
[1:34:23] amen and we are just carriers of that
[1:34:25] same seed the Bible speaks in revelation
[1:34:29] about that voice of many waters and
[1:34:32] brother Ramses is the voice of ministers
[1:34:34] and and preachers and so forth I mean
[1:34:36] how he's revealing himself through those
[1:34:38] through all those different vessels and
[1:34:40] through the fivefold ministry and so
[1:34:41] forth but I want to say this morning
[1:34:43] brothers and
[1:34:44] the voice of many waters doesn't stop
[1:34:46] with a fivefold ministry I mean the
[1:34:49] voice of many waters is the same voice
[1:34:51] it's the same resurrection I mean it's
[1:34:53] the same life it's the same weight and
[1:34:55] that where his experiences expressed
[1:34:57] through the whole body I mean the whole
[1:35:00] purpose was that the voice would express
[1:35:02] himself through us as we become scum as
[1:35:06] we become completely subject to him now
[1:35:12] I'm just gonna have me in for a moment I
[1:35:13] trusted you some of you are struggling I
[1:35:15] see tiredness of the week in kicking him
[1:35:18] but I trust that most of you can can
[1:35:20] kind of stay with me so I'm just gonna
[1:35:23] hone in a little bit on that voice bath
[1:35:25] and and this is we we practical
[1:35:28] day-to-day life application comes in how
[1:35:33] does God get preeminence in his bride
[1:35:37] well I can see it we had a wave sheaf in
[1:35:40] the other day how did he get preeminence
[1:35:42] in the Prophet God said to him go out on
[1:35:48] the mission field mother-in-law said no
[1:35:52] the Prophet listened to mother-in-law
[1:35:54] and suffered heavily brother Branham
[1:35:59] even make my statements lighter in his
[1:36:01] life he said that some of the some of
[1:36:03] the illnesses and things he suffered is
[1:36:05] perhaps because he didn't listen to God
[1:36:07] that first time when he called me
[1:36:09] Safford and we can think God is unfair
[1:36:13] God so God is not unfair God was doing
[1:36:16] something very spacial the tea in the
[1:36:18] hand of Jehovah was doing something in
[1:36:20] that prophets life I mean and then you
[1:36:23] then you see how it becomes a lot more
[1:36:24] subject to God can you see what's
[1:36:26] happening here I mean he's being
[1:36:28] submitting now I mean so now brother
[1:36:31] Branham has his own voice experience
[1:36:33] where he himself has to come become
[1:36:35] subject to the voice that God is even
[1:36:37] speaking through him I mean he's gotta
[1:36:40] as a person subject himself completely
[1:36:42] to the world and then he goes to South
[1:36:44] Africa and God says to him this is how
[1:36:48] you do it and this is how you do it and
[1:36:51] those guys stand against him and even
[1:36:54] his closest friend
[1:36:56] turns against him inside to umbrella
[1:36:58] banham I think uses eyes and think you
[1:37:01] honestly wrong those guys say to him
[1:37:04] does the angel only speak to you but God
[1:37:07] had told him what was God doing it was
[1:37:10] preparing a vessel that's completely
[1:37:12] subject and brother branham when you
[1:37:16] read it I feel so sorry for him because
[1:37:18] it was really cool
[1:37:20] he tried everything naturally possible
[1:37:22] to stand for the right thing and I just
[1:37:25] didn't give him an option and he
[1:37:27] suffered for it why because God was
[1:37:31] preparing him for a third pool and God
[1:37:35] had him had to have him completely
[1:37:37] subject to himself in order to give that
[1:37:40] complete open word through him so what
[1:37:43] was God doing in the hand of Jehovah
[1:37:45] preparing him to use him as a vessel
[1:37:49] that's how God always does it in the
[1:37:53] voice path of your walk hallelujah even
[1:38:00] when God gave him that that vision of
[1:38:03] the fishing and so forth
[1:38:05] God seek Him you always try to explain
[1:38:07] you get you the lines dangle that God at
[1:38:11] you till the last minute
[1:38:12] I mean pull those things out of the
[1:38:15] Prophet so that why he would do what the
[1:38:19] angel places on his heart to do no
[1:38:21] matter what mother-in-law sees no matter
[1:38:23] who the what who says God must be the
[1:38:27] boss God must be the head that's the
[1:38:30] process of the voice the second part of
[1:38:33] the three fold purpose trust you're
[1:38:35] still with me on those things so now
[1:38:39] when God put that vessel through all
[1:38:40] those trials what was the result
[1:38:42] a subjected vessel and vessel hallelujah
[1:38:47] and I trust you will recognize this that
[1:38:50] knows what he wants done with his word
[1:38:51] but will have thus saith the Lord or she
[1:38:55] will keep still and I'm speaking she
[1:38:57] because I'm speaking about us of course
[1:38:59] I mean the width that garden in brother
[1:39:01] Branham was to mature that vessel so
[1:39:03] that he could Thunder forth the word
[1:39:05] through him I mean so that he could have
[1:39:08] thus saith the Lord
[1:39:09] and that brother branham being the wife
[1:39:12] she fan out I could show us the example
[1:39:14] of what God wants to do to us I mean we
[1:39:17] God wants us to become completely
[1:39:19] subject hallelujah the work that God is
[1:39:26] doing in our lives is a work in the soul
[1:39:30] that's the main focus a work way by his
[1:39:35] perfecting our character because our
[1:39:38] character is all that we get to take
[1:39:40] with us when we get out of here so we
[1:39:45] need trials and peace you know when we
[1:39:48] read in the Bible how suffering for a
[1:39:51] little while is more than gold and all
[1:39:53] those things in the Bible naturally
[1:39:55] speaking we think doesn't make sense
[1:39:57] naturally speaking we think do we really
[1:40:00] need that but it is more than gold it is
[1:40:04] the best thing possible for us in fact I
[1:40:08] will go as far as to say and I hopefully
[1:40:11] will get you to some of those things
[1:40:13] this life was not made to be easy
[1:40:16] God did not put us on this earth
[1:40:19] and I'm not saying this sarcastically or
[1:40:22] to look down on anyone but God did not
[1:40:24] put us here on earth
[1:40:26] to like the charismatic scam the big BMW
[1:40:30] and claim the big Mercedes and claim the
[1:40:32] big house that's rubbish that's
[1:40:34] completely out of God's plan
[1:40:36] I mean God did not put us to achieve all
[1:40:39] those big things God put us here to do
[1:40:41] what one sane character and that's in
[1:40:44] the soul
[1:40:45] I mean and God is willing that cheat in
[1:40:49] the hand of Jehovah who was willing to
[1:40:51] let 68 million martyrs be killed through
[1:40:54] the Dark Ages so that he could perfect
[1:40:56] his church that same God that allowed
[1:40:58] six million Jews to be killed so that he
[1:41:00] could bring them to their homeland so
[1:41:02] that he can reveal himself to the
[1:41:03] hundred forty four thousand that same
[1:41:05] God will three stain the hand mature us
[1:41:08] perfect us form us so that we can become
[1:41:11] just like the wife chief in our die is
[1:41:13] subject to his word completely so that
[1:41:16] the voice is now manifested and alive in
[1:41:18] this bride I mean now I just want to say
[1:41:21] this just niches
[1:41:23] think about the 68 million martyrs over
[1:41:25] the last 2,000 years
[1:41:27] can God closed the mouths of lions yes
[1:41:31] he did it for Daniel I mean can God
[1:41:35] quench the fire or protect from the fire
[1:41:38] he did it for the for the three in the
[1:41:41] in the fiery furnace by why didn't he
[1:41:46] for so many of those souls
[1:41:47] I will fade to the Lions I was sold into
[1:41:51] pieces they were burnt at the stipple
[1:41:53] that God loses power no of course not
[1:41:57] I mean God was allowing it sometimes we
[1:42:01] have this perception that if we don't
[1:42:03] ask and God doesn't answer us
[1:42:04] immediately or we seek and it doesn't
[1:42:06] heal us immediately or God doesn't
[1:42:08] change our circumstances I mean that God
[1:42:10] is being unveiled that God is not true
[1:42:11] to his word or that we don't have enough
[1:42:13] faith or we start breaking our faith
[1:42:15] down and all sorts of stuff that's not
[1:42:17] real
[1:42:17] we need trials we need hardships we if
[1:42:23] we think of God is just a genie that we
[1:42:25] you know we wipe the bottle and he comes
[1:42:28] out yes I grant you three wishes okay
[1:42:30] what can I do for you today god I want
[1:42:32] to be healed I want to be rich I want
[1:42:34] car doesn't work that way
[1:42:36] we will never grow in God we will just
[1:42:39] become a stupid little nagging child
[1:42:41] that's from Tantrums God why didn't you
[1:42:44] give me my big Mystery's today I mean
[1:42:47] that makes us babies but when we ask God
[1:42:51] and we cry before God like the Prophet
[1:42:53] death and it doesn't give us our healing
[1:42:56] immediately
[1:42:56] I mean thing is when character is
[1:42:59] developed then it is when character
[1:43:01] comes we brother Branham says if I
[1:43:04] prayed for five hundred tonight and not
[1:43:05] one of them gets healed I will still
[1:43:07] preach divine healing in the morning
[1:43:08] because God is God and His Word is truth
[1:43:11] that's a mature sign a mature son is not
[1:43:15] the one that every time he he you know
[1:43:17] mom and dad is a credit card company
[1:43:19] every time I need something more just
[1:43:21] give me the card I mean that's not how
[1:43:24] God works can he do it yes of course and
[1:43:28] easy the same yesterday today and
[1:43:29] forever yes of course he is but it's the
[1:43:32] best possible thing for us if it doesn't
[1:43:34] just answer our prayers like that
[1:43:36] he needs to give us patience and all
[1:43:39] those things he needs to build us a and
[1:43:41] that's the only way he does it
[1:43:43] I mean he's for allowing all sorts of
[1:43:45] hardships to come across her path if we
[1:43:47] really look at it through God's eyes
[1:43:49] then we rejoice in our suffering then we
[1:43:51] get excited when God is allowing things
[1:43:53] to happen in our life because then we
[1:43:55] can say my my I wonder what this is
[1:43:57] going to achieve if we're honest with
[1:44:00] ourselves most of us can look back over
[1:44:02] our lives and think back at some of the
[1:44:04] hardest things we went through and we
[1:44:07] can say I came out to be the person I
[1:44:09] came out with some spiritual growth I
[1:44:12] came out stronger or I came out with
[1:44:15] more compassion for my brothers and
[1:44:17] sisters
[1:44:17] I mean it's so often that you see
[1:44:20] someone that's really judgmental and
[1:44:22] hard and other people and so forth and
[1:44:24] then God puts them through something and
[1:44:25] suddenly the whole attitude changes I
[1:44:28] mean we need that because in a human
[1:44:31] makeup we just self focused and we're
[1:44:33] just all prideful and we just want
[1:44:35] everything to work for me I mean the
[1:44:39] best for me but my god stop us from
[1:44:42] those things
[1:44:54] I wanted to I just want to take you even
[1:44:56] to Jesus Christ himself for a moment he
[1:45:00] now if you battle with the Garda this is
[1:45:03] gonna throw you but he needed to become
[1:45:07] so completely subject to the Father's
[1:45:09] will that he had to say I can do nothing
[1:45:14] until the father shows me first
[1:45:18] brother random hones in on how Jesus at
[1:45:21] that Pool of Bethesda stepped over many
[1:45:23] people that were perhaps more sick than
[1:45:26] when he prayed for but God sent him to
[1:45:30] that one and I thank God that I'm the
[1:45:33] one that he touched when the angel came
[1:45:35] by camy he sovereignly found the
[1:45:40] father's will and executed the father's
[1:45:43] will and if he just moved with human
[1:45:45] compassion I mean you and I because we
[1:45:47] care for people I mean we would like to
[1:45:49] heal everyone in the room clear up the
[1:45:51] whole pool of bethesda but he found the
[1:45:54] Father's will brother Aaron refers to
[1:45:55] her pool when that when that soothsayer
[1:45:58] was behind him everyday and harassing
[1:46:00] them and harassing them and one day God
[1:46:02] gave him permission and Dana cast the
[1:46:04] spirit yeah I mean but until that point
[1:46:06] God formed his character through it I
[1:46:08] mean my god help us to become so subject
[1:46:12] that we will take that same approach
[1:46:13] Jesus had to before he went to the cross
[1:46:16] I mean he prayed that pray that I always
[1:46:18] referred to father let this cup pass me
[1:46:22] that's what Jesus the word praying that
[1:46:26] the word will not be fulfilled he was
[1:46:29] the lamb he was the lamb that was
[1:46:31] prophesied from before the foundation of
[1:46:32] the world I mean in God's mind was
[1:46:35] already signed he was that lamb now and
[1:46:38] he was praying against the will of God
[1:46:40] but not my will
[1:46:43] a thy will be done that's how much that
[1:46:46] vessel had to subject himself to the
[1:46:48] world don't you think our vessels should
[1:46:51] do the same hallelujah and he prophesied
[1:46:56] and he said she will know what he once
[1:46:58] done with his word or she will keep
[1:46:59] still hey man I thank God for it
[1:47:06] brother Brad makes a statement this is
[1:47:08] so much promises today making made among
[1:47:11] Christian people so many ministers
[1:47:12] promise the people a false thing if
[1:47:14] you'll just come to Christ all your
[1:47:15] troubles is settled I tell you when you
[1:47:17] come to Christ they then begin hey how's
[1:47:21] this for sales talk praise God
[1:47:23] come to Christ so your troubles can
[1:47:26] begin but you see it's a path of growth
[1:47:28] and the end thereof is with him on the
[1:47:31] throne amen hallelujah this Christian
[1:47:34] Road is not a flower bit of ease it's a
[1:47:36] battle from the very hour you start
[1:47:38] until your spirit set free by death
[1:47:41] right so that's pretty blunt and pretty
[1:47:44] clear there's not a point were you gonna
[1:47:47] be poof free of all the trials on this
[1:47:52] side but there's gonna be a point but
[1:47:55] it's not on this side the mind battles
[1:47:57] that you're struggling with the
[1:47:59] struggles the pressures and so forth
[1:48:01] like good for you I mean but Antley
[1:48:03] those things crush you my God give you
[1:48:05] grace to grow through it become stronger
[1:48:08] through you are not on no picnic you're
[1:48:11] on a battleground hey I mean life was
[1:48:15] not meant to be easy I hope I haven't
[1:48:17] spoiled it for you but once we get to
[1:48:20] that place we recognize life was not
[1:48:23] mean to be easy and we stopped expecting
[1:48:25] that somehow some utopia will happen on
[1:48:28] this earth with life would suddenly
[1:48:29] become easy we can actually make peace
[1:48:31] with the fact that life is not easy and
[1:48:34] then it becomes easier because with my
[1:48:37] peace for the fact that life is easy
[1:48:38] it's not easy save me price of all I
[1:48:41] hope that doesn't confuse you now I'm
[1:48:47] just gonna bring this into the context
[1:48:49] now of the threefold purpose again it
[1:48:51] won't be too much longer so just just
[1:48:53] all along also like brother cadre I'm
[1:48:55] about to close so now in the three fold
[1:49:00] purpose now in that first purpose God
[1:49:02] reveals himself to the to the bride now
[1:49:06] the third purpose and I'm just gonna
[1:49:09] skip over the second purpose for a
[1:49:10] moment the kingdom is restored and we
[1:49:14] rule with him
[1:49:15] we reign with him you know we sit on the
[1:49:18] white throne during the why
[1:49:19] from judgment we're gonna rule the earth
[1:49:21] with him
[1:49:24] but brother banner makes a beautiful
[1:49:27] statement in the church age book that
[1:49:29] points directly then back to the second
[1:49:31] purpose and that is unless we suffer
[1:49:34] with him we cannot reign with him unless
[1:49:39] there's a second purpose you don't get
[1:49:41] to the third purpose you know what Satan
[1:49:44] was offering Eve in the Garden of Eden
[1:49:47] Satan was offering Eve you can be like
[1:49:52] God you can be equal with him without
[1:49:56] subjecting yourself to the word first
[1:49:58] that's still Satan's way I mean Satan is
[1:50:02] in the emancipation of the woman and the
[1:50:05] in some answer patient of the children
[1:50:07] and emancipation of all sorts of stuff
[1:50:09] because he doesn't want he'd ship but
[1:50:12] God's Way is you come the threefold way
[1:50:14] I reveal myself to you you submit
[1:50:17] yourself completely and then I place you
[1:50:20] to rule with me I mean go back to that
[1:50:23] quote the reason for this is that
[1:50:24] character simply is never made without
[1:50:27] suffering so if you say hearing you
[1:50:31] thought well maybe God will pass me over
[1:50:33] on this one well there's only two
[1:50:35] choices you're gonna get character with
[1:50:37] suffering or no character without
[1:50:40] suffering so if you want the character
[1:50:43] if you want the state purpose if you
[1:50:46] wanna sit with him on the throne well it
[1:50:49] comes with a package praise the Lord and
[1:50:51] included in that package
[1:50:53] is suffering but the suffering is not to
[1:50:56] break up just like I say this is tender
[1:50:58] hand I'm just gonna start start over
[1:51:01] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:51:02] reign with him you have to suffer to
[1:51:04] reign the reason for this is a character
[1:51:06] simply he's never made without suffering
[1:51:08] character is a victory not a gift so
[1:51:11] again it's not something that you can
[1:51:13] buy from count down and buy top dollars
[1:51:16] for it's something that is hard work
[1:51:20] over a long period man without character
[1:51:24] control because power
[1:51:26] apart from character is satanic but
[1:51:29] power with character is for
[1:51:32] like I said if you come through the
[1:51:34] threefold purpose then when you get to
[1:51:37] the Trump part and you're taken back to
[1:51:39] Eden condition and you sit on the throne
[1:51:41] with him and so forth then you are ready
[1:51:44] to rule with him because why then you
[1:51:47] will know what he wants done with these
[1:51:49] words then you will not have your own
[1:51:52] ideas then even if everyone disagrees
[1:51:54] with you you do what God wants you to do
[1:52:02] that's it that's the big difference
[1:52:05] between the first and second pull focus
[1:52:07] and the third pull experience you see a
[1:52:10] first and second pull focus and an
[1:52:12] outsider's was with respect is God I'm
[1:52:16] see kill me God I'm struggling sorted
[1:52:19] out please
[1:52:20] but a third pull focus is character
[1:52:24] Eagle anointing is character God's
[1:52:30] eternal purpose for us is character you
[1:52:38] put up that mix Lloyd again well
[1:52:42] Graham's is a persecuted Church God
[1:52:43] called him persecuted God looked upon
[1:52:45] the persecutions now speaking to this
[1:52:47] murnian Church idea God looked upon the
[1:52:50] persecutions and gave them grace to bear
[1:52:53] it he looked upon his two relations and
[1:52:55] gave them victory over death looked upon
[1:52:57] their poverty and give them riches in
[1:52:59] him I mean he gave these spiritual
[1:53:04] blessings for the physical sufferings
[1:53:05] they had the Church of Smyrna passed
[1:53:08] through the fiery furnace of
[1:53:10] tribulations but was a sweet-smelling
[1:53:12] savior unto him so now as I start
[1:53:17] winding down now I'm gonna gonna speak
[1:53:20] about Lazarus a little bit I'm taking
[1:53:24] you back to that last verse again what I
[1:53:27] read in the opening scripture
[1:53:32] hmm when he had thus spoken he cried
[1:53:36] with a loud voice Lazarus come forth but
[1:53:41] you know when you read that when I read
[1:53:45] that this this time it it just jumped
[1:53:47] out at me as if he was saying release
[1:53:50] the spell he was saying unleash this
[1:53:54] mighty power
[1:53:55] it's like unleashing a racehorse you
[1:53:57] know when before they go before they let
[1:53:59] him out of those those pits or whatever
[1:54:01] they really and they place by throbbing
[1:54:04] to go and they ready to go and and it
[1:54:06] was as if God was saying two letters
[1:54:08] come forth
[1:54:09] I mean explode go forth I mean released
[1:54:12] the energy released the Bearer release
[1:54:14] the testimony and so forth and that
[1:54:17] testimony was unleashed on Galilee when
[1:54:21] Lazarus came forth and now and we don't
[1:54:25] have time to read it but we really bear
[1:54:27] hell there was a feast made and and
[1:54:29] Lazarus was invited to the feast and how
[1:54:31] the Pharisees and and the the leaders
[1:54:34] they wanted to kill Lazarus what did he
[1:54:36] do he was the evidence of the
[1:54:39] resurrection I mean do you think they're
[1:54:42] gonna love you I mean do you think
[1:54:44] they're gonna like to have you around I
[1:54:47] mean there was one day who had already
[1:54:49] tasted death but he cannot die again
[1:54:52] I mean spiritually speaking I mean he
[1:54:55] was already they was already resurrected
[1:54:57] and no matter what I said I could not
[1:54:59] disprove it because he had the
[1:55:00] experience that's what God brings every
[1:55:03] member of the bride to when God reveals
[1:55:07] himself to us what's he revealing he's
[1:55:09] revealing his attributes but it's not
[1:55:12] putting them down in a Sunday School
[1:55:13] class since I remember one of my
[1:55:15] attributes is to be Redeemer repeat
[1:55:18] after me Redeemer he's not saying it
[1:55:21] that way
[1:55:21] God is letting you fall and then
[1:55:25] experience Redemption God is letting you
[1:55:30] get sick and experience healing God is
[1:55:33] letting you get all stressed out and
[1:55:36] frustrated and then give you that peace
[1:55:39] then one thing you can say yes I believe
[1:55:41] you jehova sholom because I've
[1:55:43] experienced Jehovah Shalom
[1:55:45] I mean so we're gonna have a much better
[1:55:48] relationship than Eve head then Adam had
[1:55:51] because they were in perfect conditions
[1:55:53] God good say to Adam I am your healer
[1:55:57] and Adam would say whatever what do you
[1:56:00] want me to do here God but when he says
[1:56:03] to us I'm your healer we say yes God I
[1:56:05] know because I've experienced him you
[1:56:08] see why God allowed the fault to happen
[1:56:10] and where I go I gotta let all these
[1:56:11] things it was all part of his purpose
[1:56:13] because God needed to express those
[1:56:16] attributes by experience to this bride
[1:56:20] and Lazarus was wandering around and
[1:56:23] some people came just for the first and
[1:56:26] second pool wow he did a good trickier
[1:56:30] look at this guy he rose this guy from
[1:56:32] the dead that it changed their lives no
[1:56:34] I kind of wonder how many of those
[1:56:37] people who actually stole Asura's and
[1:56:39] alive after he died were perhaps part of
[1:56:43] those who cried the Hosanna and ended up
[1:56:46] being part of the same crowd
[1:56:47] I mean who say crucify him in our day it
[1:56:52] sounds like this well he did wainy many
[1:56:55] mighty miracles and yes he was a good
[1:56:57] man but he went off the rails in there
[1:56:58] that's what it sounds like they think
[1:57:00] the same of you and me yes there are
[1:57:03] good people they nice and they do nice
[1:57:04] stuff for you but hey something's wrong
[1:57:08] with him I mean of course they call the
[1:57:11] hare the master of the house Beelzebub
[1:57:12] how much more wise I mean many different
[1:57:17] approaches but the reality is for
[1:57:20] Lazarus it was real for Lazarus he had
[1:57:24] the experience no one could take it away
[1:57:26] anymore you see it wasn't Lazarus that
[1:57:29] they hated they hated the God that was
[1:57:31] able to do that I mean they hated the
[1:57:34] God that was proving that the life that
[1:57:36] he expressed to Lazarus showed up that
[1:57:39] they were lifeless that there was
[1:57:41] nothing lead that they just had formed
[1:57:42] but they just pretended but there were
[1:57:45] just a bunch of Pharisees who walking
[1:57:47] around trying to be more holy than the
[1:57:49] next one but they have no life behind
[1:57:51] the name they had no voice behind the
[1:57:53] voice they had no power of God
[1:57:55] manifested through them and I'm gonna
[1:57:57] say to you
[1:57:58] this brothers and sisters we sometimes
[1:58:01] tend to measure power of God by how many
[1:58:04] miracles God does every five minutes
[1:58:06] that's not how he works because Judas
[1:58:10] Iscariot came all the way through
[1:58:12] justification all the way through
[1:58:13] sanctification and under sanctification
[1:58:15] only he was able to do many mighty
[1:58:18] miracles mighty things the Devils were
[1:58:22] subject to him but he needed to go all
[1:58:25] the way to the rebirth and he couldn't
[1:58:28] because he was not a predestinated eagle
[1:58:30] but eagles will go all the way hey me
[1:58:38] they were brother Branham preaches souls
[1:58:42] that I imprisoned now and he speaks
[1:58:44] about how part of the third pole is to
[1:58:46] preach to these eternally lost how they
[1:58:50] were some people walking around on this
[1:58:52] earth who could never be alive eternally
[1:58:55] who were already in hell now so just
[1:58:59] people in prison now but you see there's
[1:59:03] a flipside to that
[1:59:05] these people walking around on this
[1:59:07] earth that can never die these people
[1:59:12] walking around on this earth with that
[1:59:14] voice of the Resurrection has become so
[1:59:17] one with him you can blow up at
[1:59:20] embalming their body you can blow this
[1:59:22] body to smithereens payme
[1:59:25] but they cannot die because they have
[1:59:28] eternal life in them they've become part
[1:59:30] of life the Living God has manifested
[1:59:33] himself through them and all you would
[1:59:35] do is do them a favor because that were
[1:59:37] just released him from the soul pictures
[1:59:40] hallelujah in closing I spoke about how
[1:59:47] that same voice of the Archangel is now
[1:59:49] expressing himself through this Brian
[1:59:53] and I want to say Lazarus come forth let
[1:59:58] the life in you speak let the life that
[2:00:03] was that was that has now become one
[2:00:05] with you be manifested to those around
[2:00:08] you that are still in need remember not
[2:00:12] everyone is
[2:00:12] the ego some people can only access the
[2:00:16] first and second pull through you but
[2:00:19] they some that will receive it as ego
[2:00:21] food they will be born and they will
[2:00:24] grow up and I will come in the same
[2:00:27] image and I will reflect the same guy
[2:00:31] Lazarus come forth it stand together
[2:00:35] wonder if I can ask him to these the
[2:00:38] musicians to come trust that this has
[2:00:45] been not been too much all over the
[2:00:47] place and that the Lord will just shake
[2:00:50] it all up and put it in the right
[2:00:51] direction in our you know hearts you
[2:00:55] know that song this old world can even
[2:00:57] hold me well we have won praise the Lord
[2:01:02] maybe you need to come help me sing does
[2:01:06] anybody else know the song you do praise

[2:06:53] just want to say one thing you know
[2:06:54] people people have come you know come
[2:06:56] and they've even spoken to me saying and
[2:06:59] how brother BAM he tells the story of
[2:07:00] the of the shepherd and he's got the
[2:07:03] little lamb that they're dead its leg
[2:07:05] was broken song comes along that says
[2:07:07] why how's the slim get a broken leg and
[2:07:11] the ship it's in I brokered sleep people
[2:07:14] are shocked what why would you break
[2:07:16] your own lamb's leg see well I sort
[2:07:18] straying it was going off doing its own
[2:07:20] thing so I had to do something to bring
[2:07:21] it back to me so our ladders think get
[2:07:24] broker then I can pull my love and show
[2:07:26] my care for now it's by my side the
[2:07:28] whole time
[2:07:29] people don't understand why God allows
[2:07:31] trials and hardship ma you know and
[2:07:34] people say how can a loving God allow
[2:07:35] such things to happen to us but it's
[2:07:38] amazing when you you know because when
[2:07:39] brother Brown tells a story like that
[2:07:41] it's in the scripture and you read
[2:07:43] Psalms 51 I won't read the whole song
[2:07:45] but this is some that David wrote when
[2:07:47] they when Nathan the prophet came unto
[2:07:49] him after he had gone and to best
[2:07:51] sheepish after Nathan win and said
[2:07:53] you're the man you know you're yo you
[2:07:55] took your eyes yo yo yo you killed your
[2:07:58] I took his wife you did all these things
[2:08:00] and then he would say he traded me a
[2:08:02] clean heart O God who knows that son but
[2:08:04] then he comes down to verse 8 he says
[2:08:07] make me to hear joy and gladness that
[2:08:09] the bones which thou has broken may
[2:08:12] rejoice so he was he was he was tying
[2:08:15] exactly what heaven was worth with
[2:08:17] Bathsheba and his son died because the
[2:08:19] child died he said his parallel net with
[2:08:22] bones being broken to God allow that to
[2:08:24] happen that David would come back to God
[2:08:26] again so everything works for our good I
[2:08:29] mean he has our best interest in mind
[2:08:33] I mean so I think we can just rejoice
[2:08:36] I've had a cold
[2:08:40] wasn't a man calling me wasn't a church
[2:08:43] calling me as we heard it wasn't a
[2:08:45] Kentuckian calling me God came and
[2:08:48] called me he's called us to a high and
[2:08:51] holy calling on you glad you know
[2:08:55] brother Graham said about the widow
[2:08:57] woman there then Elijah went to the
[2:08:59] Gentile widow woman he said that she was
[2:09:01] the same caliber as the Prophet that's
[2:09:04] why he was sent to her this word has
[2:09:08] come to you because you're the same
[2:09:10] caliber as this word as our Lord Jesus
[2:09:13] you may not think yourself much but God
[2:09:15] he put your life a greater value than
[2:09:17] his own blood hallelujah amen see or
[2:09:21] think yo you are nothing I'm worthless
[2:09:24] no you're more valuable than this whole
[2:09:26] world you're more valuable than this
[2:09:28] whole universe to god you are so never
[2:09:31] ever let the devil think you're
