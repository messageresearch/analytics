for your glory Lord we commit the service into your hands and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen thank you musicians I'm a good evening everyone bless you like to welcome you all here tonight trust you all I mean doesn't matter if you had had a fight to get here or a breeze you're here that's the main thing praise the Lord let's um let's go to the Book of Isaiah and we'll go to chapter 6 as i Sexson in verses one to five on trustus is familiar to everyone here but the word never gets old see Isaiah six verses one to five we're gonna go to Exodus chapter three in verses 1 to 4 Isaiah 6 and one sees here in the year that King Uzziah had died I also saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphim's each one had six wings with Twain with twain he covered his face with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and he cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke Dean said I was me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of knowing of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts I mean let's go to Exodus 3 can you turn that down a bit not used to hearing myself Exodus 3 verses 1 to 4 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and Moses said I'll now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto Him now the myths of the bush and see had Moses Moses and he said here am I may the Lord bless his word this night you may you may have your seats trust you haven't come here just to go through a religious service brother Brahim speaks about Moses on the backside of the desert the air and he says he says that he was he was going down perhaps an old familiar path one hot morning perhaps and then all at once there came a bush on fire and the bush did not consume well it was altogether unusual he says it in a few places like that where he went was going down an old familiar path maybe he had been down that path you know he was there on the backside desert for 40 years maybe he went down that path once a year so 40 times or 80 times I don't know but you know it's like church sometimes we you know some of us been raised in church you know we've been to services three services you know since we're from the cradle and it becomes a familiar old path you know we come to church we sing a few songs someone gets up and prays you know there's a special there's a testimony or Sunday school or whatever it may be you know you've got to get your church clothes on and you know you've got to get there and you know it becomes a very familiar place it comes a very you know you know you normally sit in the same seat you know normally certain song leaders will pick particular songs they like and it becomes familiar and and even the minister will have a certain mannerisms and how he will minister and how his hands will go and you know it becomes familiar but in familiar times God can come and it can turn from just being a familiar thing to an unfamiliar thing we see Isaiah was here ago or maybe licious now Moses for a little but Moses was on the backside of the desert for forty years and God was molding him through that time that he had ever visitation and he would then go down to Egypt and he would deliver his people out of Egypt now the most important thing is in life as you meet God for yourself I mean it's more than anything in the world as you meet him I mean where the word becomes more than someone else's testimony or more than just pages in a Bible or more than even the prophets voice on tape but if it becomes a living elevate to you hallelujah where he goes from a God of a god of history or God of maybe what he'll do in the future do becomes a present God and that's what Jesus Christ he is the same yesterday and brother are emphasized today and forever and I believe we should we should emphasize the same thing he's the same today and and there he was he was there on the banks of it is that then God made him and God made him for a specific purpose and brother branham tells us that the devil cannot take our lives until we have finished our earlier fulfilled our purpose upon the earth so nothing can take you from this mortal coil until God is finished with you hallelujah so if you've still got life in your body you've got a purpose upon the earth and you should say Lord I want to live my purpose out whatever the purpose may be I want to I want to fulfill it now we understand in the scripture that every believer had a struggle they had a battle sometimes just getting out of bed can be a struggle getting to church on time can be a struggle right but the main thing is you get there hallelujah you can have all this turmoil in your mind and and the devil fights you you know who has the devil there before you trying to get the church right that's everything in God just plain sailing and then you had some turbulence and you should have realized all the Devils up ahead because my destination is God's presence and that's why there's this turbulence that I'm sailing through right now we should expect it we shouldn't be surprised we shouldn't come into this place condemned right just because we've had a fuss at an argument and whatever more you know the kids are fine then then they start acting up and this one does this and this one everything's going backwards and and you wonder why you should say a blessings on its way holy and blessings always like when you land in Wellington 99.9 percent of time there's turbulence he's got tariff levers on its way I've been a land fellow a doesn't matter what the wind is doing I'm going to land and it's the same thing with the Lord the devil always fights before the blessing comes and as soon as the promise is given that's when the battle really happens right it's not before the promise but when the word becomes alive personally to you it's quick into your soul then the battle really sets in because the devil is trying to push you off your promise push you away from your promise take your faith away we're going to stand flat-footed on the trial so I will not be moved hallelujah so Moses you know he had a he had a you know he had some battles on the backside of the desert he had some tough times but there were nothing compared to the tough times he was about to enter hallelujah but he stood the main thing is he was in the presence of the burning bush and everything Moses lack was in the presence of God hallelujah went beyond just a natural scene of looking for pasture and there's my sheep and watch out for dogs and whatever predators were there he was in God's presence and it was very different holy and it changed them now Isaiah that we read about Isaiah was a contemporary of King Uzziah and actually were basically the same kind of age and brother Bram says that King Uzziah became he wrote Isaiah because he stood for God you know God gave him great victories and and he admired the king and the other King and the prophet they're both godly men but the thing is you've got to come to a place where all human human things to lean against you know you can't you to stand alone with God and sometimes even godly influence has to be taken out of the way where God can deal with you amen we've got to come to a place where all humanity is put to one side and God comes down hallelujah so King Uzziah he came to a place where he has lifted up and pride you know you've got to stand alone with God you understand what I'm saying you can't depend upon the person next to you it's you and God it's young God right we're in a body we need each other but ultimately it's you and God aim it's a king uzziah we know he got lifted up and pride he wanted through the priests office and he took a sensor and he wanted to be a priest and the priest tried to stop him but said I'll do it anyway and he was smoking with leprosy anywhere as he was banished from the throne and this is where now Isaiah comes it let's go down to the temple you're about 40 under how old he was maybe about 40 years old his hero had just fallen in an unexpected way and now he was in dire straits and these enemies coming up on the border things are happening in the kingdom is jeopardy and here you are and the one man you could depend upon who was really the king the nation would either rise or fall because of the King if the King was godly the nation flourished if the King was ungodly it fell into ruin so here was the one that and no doubt you know as like in any royal court there's different ones it's like politics different ones are trying to hold this sway over the king and have it as influence and get his peerage and different things and so there's always different things going on a court hears the prophet of God he's trying to stand in this and King Uzziah well Isaiah had confidence in him well at least he's standing but then he fell in his own accord so now here comes you sire I mean so here comes Isaiah he's in dire straight and he goes down to the temple I doubt very much he was cheerful that day he had a burden now Lord what's happened God God needed that to happen because Isaiah was going to write 66 books of the you know there's 66 chapters in Isaiah and he and he goes from before there was anything to the end it's like the Bible within a book but God had to get him to one side to reveal himself to the prophet so he couldn't lean on the king any more God had to bring him out from that influence that influence had to die in order for a heavily influenced to come and it's the same thing with you and I friends we need a heavenly influence more than just human influence upon us but God has to influence us because you'll be influenced by two powers God or the devil it depends who you want to be influenced by and I would personally be God influenced me my years of living God's keep part of history and influenced me hallelujah so now here he was and he was under he was he was he was and he was trouble then he went to the temple he went to the best place and he began to pray and I doubt very much he expected what he experienced I mean but he went to a familiar place but something unfamiliar happened isn't it strange using the temple of something unfamiliar happened to him God came down God came into the temple God came out of us and to his temple revealed himself where he should reveal himself that's the same thing here friends this is God's house we gather to worship God we don't gather here just to go through a human system of religion and sing our songs and say our prayers and go outside we come here to be in contact with God Almighty that Jesus would come and meet with us probably and I'm glad Jesus meets with us in this place I mean by the thing as the devil tries to distract us and and trouble us and we get caught up in life let's throw it off amen amen I think we should just push possible that's why I say I mean you say I was was pushed out of one side so God could get a hold of Isaiah and God could speak to him and it was more than just him learning the five books of Moses God spoke to him amen and he saw he saw the Lord High and lifted up ask you could are singing no they what must have been like to be Ezekiel he's in captivity they see stir he sees the cherubims and he sees the Lord upon his throne there he is he's bi you know it became a probably a familiar place he's in captivity this as we were going to live it became familiar I think God came into a familiar place to him and God spoke to him I wonder what it would have been like you wouldn't have been the different I mean you wouldn't have been the same after being in that kind of presence you would have been the same and I'll say friends that same God is present that same God is here that same God is among us I mean they're same God has to meet our needs I mean in the word the Bible the message will become flesh in you and I I mean we don't serve an idea or cunningly devised fables of man we serve the true and living God hallelujah but he wants to get us to a place where he can influence us amen amen now many times God actually use hardship to get our attention let's go to Psalms 51 51 51 we're all very familiar with it it was David wrote it after after he thought he had gotten away with you know committing adultery with Bathsheba having her husband killed we are told that Nathan the prophet comes to King David two years after he had but Bathsheba's husband killed Uriah two years later he thought he got away with it but in the Prophet comes to him and tells him a story there's two men in the kingdom one had many sheep one had one then the man with many sheep had a guest coming he took the one sheep from the one man killed it and fitted to his guest and the kings because the King doesn't like in Justice's blood begins to boil he says that man should die and the prophet point that I'm saying you're the man you took you took Bathsheba's you had many he took his one and you had him killed and he and and and he realized he had done it and the reason he had done it is because he began his heart begin to wonder from God he began to stop fighting battles he sat back in a in a relaxed way and as in his palace and he began to wander we can wander we can be sitting in church and be wandering walking around I pray Lord let's not wander may our hearts be stayed on thee the here he is he says have mercy upon me have we all got it open Isaiah I mean Psalms 51 verse 1 have mercy upon me O God according to thy loving-kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions my sin is ever before me against me I mean sorry against the the only have I sinned and done evil in my sight that thou mightest be justified when now speakers and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part now a sharp make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I will be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice it's going to stop right there brother Brown tells a story he says shepherds would break when a lamb would stray the ship would would break its leg and then heal it and in that and that sheep would stay close and the reason he said the Shepherd does that is because he wants to show the love for the Sheep because the sheep's train that's right here in the scripture because David as acquainting him being because we know with Bathsheba the child they had the first job they had died the son died he equates that with a bone bring broken but he's equated what happened to him weh wrote the psalm as God actually broke a bone the bone that make me to hear joy and gladness at the bones which thou has broken may rejoice he following what I'm saying so he's actually saying that his heart was wandering and he caused him to sin and do this great evil and then God allowed it as like a bone was broken that now he could actually come back to God and God too could could restore him restore the jaws of your other salvation creighton he McLean huh God knows how to get our attention but are we are we listening when he's trying to get our attention because sometimes he'll he'll bring hardship and he's actually trying to get you to come back sometimes hardship comes and you got to plow through it because you got to know who you are you following me sometimes you hate we all know when we're carnal we all know we're mr. Fleishman mr. flesh man is wandering around very much alive we know don't we here is watch at world but we also know when God is alive and flesh man is dead and we also know when the devil's trying to push us back and push us down hallelujah we know that and it's the most times we're going to know who we are and who God is and we've been sent to this earth who have been commissioned we're being called I meant to take a word to the four corners of the earth and we may as well start a next door right we're here now there's the scripture is full of times when man steps into the prints of Almighty God it's often in desperate circumstances drive from there we read about Isaiah we read you know we could read even about the Apostle Paul he say well that wasn't desperate yeah in a different way it was desperate he was filled with anger he wanted to go wipe out the Christians he went on the road to Damascus everything against him was against the true and living God and he didn't know it but there he was but then he met the very God he learnt about he knew a lot about Jehovah but then he met Jehovah and it's two very different things when you learn about him and then you meet him and then he meets he meets the actually the God he was fighting which was Jesus a min which was in the first church he met him on the road to Damascus and then that was a very different kind of experience are you following me I just say let's go beyond just just going through the motion let's go beyond it I mean I'm not reading the yo-yo we read the scripture something else should say that's for you that's for me he's the same God he's not a different God he's not someone else's God he's here to be met hallelujah he's the same God in the Old Testament as years and than you now we have a lot of sometimes well actually often you know the devil is always here to fight us always he's the first one in church and he's the last one to leave amen he is he's here to fight you he's here to withstand you he said withstand you coming to your position Amy it's just like it says in the book of we weren't turned up I think it's a Cariah it says there's the High Priestess tyranny and and he's in dirty garments and the Devils on his right hand to withstand him and then the angel the Lord that comes and and rebukes the devil he leaves and then the high priest comers that change from duty governments to to clean high priest garments so the devil was there to withstand the high priest coming to his position as the same thing with you and I the devil's here to withstand us and to fight us and to tell us it's not yours it's our land it's our promise it's our inheritance amen Allu yeah so we should withstand the devil he says withstand the devil and he will flee he shall he shall flee thought he might flee he shall yet it was stand him yeah and he shall flee from you amen he's come here to rob destroy and kill now sometimes sometimes we come to a place where God can be walking right with us and we don't know it yeah and then this resurrection now that's very much true you go to Luke chapter 24 and you know the you know the scripture they were in a familiar place there in Jerusalem else familiar the Messiah had been crucified he was in the tomb they saw him go to Calvary they saw him hang there on the cross they heard him say Father forgive them they don't know what they do they saw him said and father into thy hands I commit my spirit they saw him die and they felt the earthquake they saw the Eclipse they saw all those things and they saw his body be put into the tomb and they saw it sealed up and here they were and they're waiting for the day after the Sabbath the day after the Sabbath the Sunday the Resurrection Day they don't know it was a resurrection day even though Jesus told them many times that he'd be given to the hands of sinful men be crucified the third day he'll raise again he told them that he told them the promise of the hour but it was it didn't quite sink in because they were too caught up with what they saw what they were used to you know I tell you the rapture will be something we're not used to the body change will be something that we won't be used to it'll be a very different kind of moment and a twinkling of an eye these atoms are going to be changed it'll be something we have not experienced I don't know where we'll be we could be you know and beard we could be here that'd be wonderful wouldn't it Oh actually on our way to work Monday morning only they can be Vanessa but you know we could be anywhere then there's gonna be you know before we even realize it and so there they were there are in a familiar place but unfamiliar things were happening and then they went to the tomb the woman went to the tomb first now what I'm talking to you about is more than a story right it's a prophecy brother Brown says modern events are made clear by prophecy and he goes to Luke chapter 24 and he says that that's the the death burial resurrection is a prophecy and a prophecy has to be fulfilled a prophecy as speaking of future events that will happen and people will live out those events right people got because because when God speaks a prophecy like for example he knew Moses would be Moses going down to Egypt but in but when he gave the promise to Abraham Moses hasn't mentioned his particular name is not spoken in the prophecy but God in his mind sees Moses is going to take that role God's like a great director he's got a script and he knows who his actors are going to be when when when when Isaiah prophesied the voice of one crying in the wilderness it didn't say John the Baptist will be the voice but he was the act of fulfilling that role when God spoke that forth in his mind he saw John standing on the riverbank as the voice crying in the wilderness hallelujah when there's the prophecy he shall be a light to the Gentiles that was Jesus but also Paul's ministry Paul said I'm a light to the Gentiles so when God spoke that forth in God's mind he saw Paul hallelujah so God has actors in his mind he knows you gonna fulfill a-- they just speaks of forth and then at its season and lives aloo you and so now here we are let's go back there let's go back to thee the prophecy it was the Messiah amen he was there they were believers they were there right there was the rejecters the scoffers the mockers the critics the indifferent they were there they were there they're in a familiar place let's go see how the how the believers were they were down they had questions they weren't sure exactly what was going on but they were there they were looking for him and what he was used to be like but he was an hour in a different form and now he is walking with them he is walking with the two on the way to Emmaus let's go before that he was with he he wasn't there in the tomb that believers go to the tomb where he was they saw him go in it as a dead form wrapped up sealed-up tomb they come back a few days later where is he gone and marries they're saying where have you laid him that I can carry him away and they took spirit as spices to anoint his body then you all about death and spices and burying people but then know too much about someone who died who came back to life on the ruin of court because Jesus says I lay my life down and I'll take it back up again I've never seen that happen they saw Lazarus come out of the grave but the resurrection the life called him forth but now they are going to see the resurrection life bring himself back back to life hallelujah under his own power and then so here she is and she turns around and she sees a young man thinks it's a gardener here he is where have you taken him that I can carry him away this is her burden where's the Messiah that I want to anoint with spices he's dead but he wasn't dead he is alive he was alive and then so then she just said one word Mary and her eyes came open it's you rabbi hallelujah that changed her whole life amen it was a familiar place but God did an unexpected familiar thing amen and then and then and then that happens she runs tells the disciples and there's two disciples walking on the way to Emmaus they're not rejoicing that the whole life is falling apart they had invested everything with this Jesus of Nazareth they had burned every Bridge they're following this man and now he had been crucified he had done nothing wrong but he had been crucified the the church treasurer committed suicide Judas right and The ministers were held up in some place and they were going back to Emmaus this is where they were and they were going down a familiar path something unexpected happened the main thing is they are talking about what God was doing in their day and when you talk about him in your day that's when he draws near one who draw near don't you want him to come that's why it's so important you want to think on the right things ponder ponder those things in your heart like Mary did talk talk about what he's doing in this day amen and then and then he begins to walk with them and they didn't recognize because he was in another form that they didn't recognize and then now they begin to actually try and fill him in he says why you said what you said what as if he didn't know amen as if he didn't know and then and then they said oh you know this this Jesus of Nazareth we believe to be a yo we believed he was the Prophet and the other Messiah but now he's dead he's been he's been crucified and now his body's been taken somewhere and people says he's alive and we don't know and he begins to say Oh fools and slow of heart to believe and then he starts at Moses and he goes all the way down to the scripture and he says did he do this was he like a prophet like unto Moses and was he you know what you know was he was he crucified or killed between two male factors he goes through all of the scriptures concerning him and it's more than a Bible study it's more than learning something the Messiah is there trying to get them to see where they are in the scripture I mean to try and get him to see they are in the script to show them what the next scene is going to be and the scenes that have been hallelujah that they don't try and start in the opening scene that's already done and the closing scene as well from the future but we're but he's trying to show them what pages are on right now and it's the same thing here friends and then and then here they were they you know they walked for six hours with him and he and he's telling everything about himself in the scripture then they come to one of their houses and then he he goes as if he's going to keep walking on but they constrain him to come in we're going to constrain Jesus to come and Amy got to constrain him stay with me don't walk on come in with me hey they weren't even sure who he was and he's a personal God he's a person he's not an idea he's a living being and then so they yeah and then they constrain to come in and then they sit down and then they're about to have a meal and the one who's the head of the house normally breaks the bread they placed him as the head of the house and he broke the bread and their eyes came open because he did something that he did before his crucifixion they realized Lord it's you and he disappeared and in a six hour walk became a one hour sprint or hardened to however long they ran back to tell the rest of them he's risen he's risen and that's what we need to really tell each other he's risen he's alive he's present I met him the other day he spoke to me he quickened his word to my soul he's a living God he's present here olia because there's not a God of history he's not an idea he's a person to meet hallelujah and then so now brother Bram comes down and he says now that's a prophecy and we're now living out the fulfillment of the prophecy I mean when the Messiah comes upon the scene the Son of Man is revealed the hope it means something to you and he takes a profit vessel and he speaks through that vessel amen and to God's elected they hear the voice behind the voice it becomes more than just tapes and books and I trust it's not common to anyone I trust has never become common well I've been raised in when did it quicken you alive when did it speak to your heart and become a living reality where it's not some something stale or some information but it becomes a living word amen to you personally he says now we are living that these modern events around us and made clear by Luke 24 amen hallelujah we've seen now I know I know I spoke this at our first camp but we've seen people crucify him we've been down I'm just gonna count here we are wherever this goes it'll go we've been discouraged we've been down have we not we've been hurt we've been disappointed yeah we've been wondering what's going on and if we just went back into the scripture and said actually that was a prophecy and now it's got to be lived out hallelujah and we're living it out and you find yourself as the actors of those who are about to go to the upper room amen to receive the Holy Ghost now we know we've already received the Holy Ghost oh I trust you have but it's all part of Resurrection season it wasn't just Jesus came out of the tomb when the windows the day of Pentecost they were once dead in trespasses and sin even though they are following the Son of Man but on the day of Pentecost they came alive they were quickened by the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead came and dwelt in them and quicken them they became living witnesses of the resurrection hallelujah and this is what we have become the Upper Room you know there's many places where we can look in the scripture where people are in familiar places and God comes in an unexpected way and you got to be looking for it right we've got to look beyond well this is church and this is Wednesday and you know yes we got to look beyond it what to expect you know when we come through the doors or when we close our eyes for a word of Prayer even for just the food and the morning we should expect to come down and God to meet it with us and God to commune with us and God to speak to us shouldn't we hey man yes amen I'm glad we have a God of the present hallelujah now this always say you're the right approach to God and and I'll just close with these statements but the woman who touched the hem of His garment had to reach down and touch his touch the hem of His garment she had to come and humility to get what she needed the woman with the alabaster box had to come to a place where she didn't care what everyone else thought of her him what she was doing she wasn't invited to that party but she knew that someone had to do him a service someone had to anoint him someone had to make him welcome and no one else did so she thought I'm going to take everything she render she saw hell I don't know how she saw but she looked at and saw how he was treated and she's seen within herself that is not right I'm not gonna let those cold formal religious people treat the Messiah like that so she ran back to her house and she didn't just get a little bit of petty cash she got Oliver earning and it didn't matter how she ended jesus knew what she had done but he wasn't he wasn't worried about that she was coming to give an offering hallelujah and then as she went she got the alabaster box I trust it's more than a story I trust you can say I've been there I've been there I've given my Omen held back a little bit of a safety deposit under my mattress she grabbed all of her cash out Adam under the mattress ran to the Apothecary no you're no doubt the Apothecary guy said yo took one look at her oh it's you again you know what do you want she points up to maybe some fancy talk thing I want that one that one what are you gonna pay with her worth puts all the money on the desk by thinking I know how you got that stuff she didn't care you got to come to a place where you don't care what others think what others are doing I mean I don't worry what others are doing God what are you doing what are you moving me to do and then so she would have got the box she bought it she ran in she didn't ask permission she asked permission of Simon the Pharisee or now she just went in broke the alabaster box anointed anointed his feet you know took her here and and and and and and whipped on his feet took his feet by her hands and whipped on them washed them with her tears and then what wiped his feet what his feet with her here hallelujah and the prophets is that the smell of Jesus got honor by her by her washing his feet hallelujah I trust the smell of Jesus gets on us I mean Yana said well I'm saying the smell of his feet got upon her hallelujah and then and then jesus said to her thigh sins are forgiven go in peace amen she was not she was determined maybe it was a familiar place for I don't know she knew how to get in but an unexpected thing drove her to it and she and she and she broke the alabaster box on her and anointed him did him a service King David had three mighty men he was he was there was full Philistine Garrison's around Bethlehem and her soul longs for the water of Bethlehem and he just said oh my he didn't make it command he said oh I wish I could drink from that well that I drank from when I was young and these three mighty men they just something in them just said our king wants a drink and the water he is not going to do any good he wants that well there well you mean that well by the Philistines that well and something in them said let's go get it hallelujah and they took their swords or their weapons and they had one purpose we're going to cut through all formality paths are all indifference cuts are all strife and worry and tomorrow and yesterday and burdens and trouble and whatever more thick they cut through at all and they got a drink because their burden was my king needs a fresh drink hallelujah and then they filled up the bucket and they killed their way 1 2 3 they kill I don't know how many they killed but what enemy got in their way discouragement pride what the neighbor was doing ill feelings elder indifference your negative thoughts whatever maybe they cut down everyone hallelujah brother Brahim says our king wants a fresh drink maybe she'd cut through all indifference and formality whatever it may be all doubts of unbelief and devils and let's get out give our king of fresh drink of Pentecost of water hallelujah we can really break through and say Lord here's a fresh drink I want to give you a fresh worship afresh afresh rejoicing a fresh worship for what you've done that that way you've done for me is not stale it hasn't become common it's still bubbling it's still wonderful it's still glorious holy that's what we want to do amen and here we are on a Wednesday in a familiar place maybe in an unexpected day or service but I'm just going to leave it there what are you gonna do we're here to cut down every evil we should not be I think as was the brother from from Canada senator I can't remember his name but he said we're not peacekeepers were Satan we are hated conquer we're here to take David lost his entire all of their loved ones when Zig leg was taken and his burden was i'm not going to leave one more I'm not going to leave them hostage and he went back and he took back everything the devil had taken from him I mean I mean those Raiders every well we just call it devil because that's what the devil does he tries to come and steal yeah come and take from us and we should have it in our soul no I'm not going to leave one piece I'm not going to leave one person I'm not gonna leave one one bit of what he's taken I'm going to get it all back and I will not rest until I've got a total victory over my enemy hallelujah and he did that he went and he got back everything that was his how about you you're the first Church age it says I have one thing yes because thou has left thy first love now if you leave something it's your responsibility to go get it it's like thou has left our keys thy Keys thou has left he said well they might need to go find them I can't function without them thou has left our phone and I'm using very silly illustrations but if you have left your phone you had it at one time but you've walked on left it somewhere so you've got to go get it back right now we're living in a time friends where where we have restored back to the original Pentecost not a zoo sir Street Pentecost but the original Pentecost the original Pentecost was God was and his people and his fullness right before the ephesian church age really said and there was a period of time where they weren't in a church age anymore I mean hadn't even gone into one year they hadn't left their first love yet right the Antichrist spirit hadn't come in with just deeds but they had they had godness fullness and the enemy wasn't there yet in that way we are here we are living in a time of restoration we're living at a time when God is present we're living in a time where all things are ours by Jesus Christ we're living in a time where we don't have to sit back and say well that someone else's testimony God don't do those things over more because God does everything now right he's still a healer he's still a redeemer he's still an outpour of a lot of his holy spirit he's still a transformer he still makes people scream and shout and live right after their that's happened to them he still births people into the kingdom acts 2:38 youngins ms real Christmas the church world thinks they are he still bristle because that's the only ones the word can produce as acts 2:38 screaming crying shouting whooping youngins hallelujah glorious creatures I think they are hallelujah but the main thing is you had a look at what your life was after you met him and you and and and if your life is transformed and you're living by the Word of God overcoming every day then you met the right guy and you've got the right experience but we shouldn't sit back and be worried about formalism and try to keep all things together the devil is a you know you going to a graveyard we've gone to our Art Gallery and it's just a bunch of statues right not well even modern artists statues or graveyards just tombstones there's no life there it's all dead right that's what the devil wants to make people he wants to make it like it's a morgue amen but we're not embalmed with with with preservative we're embalmed with bolt and bars for another over but we're be transfused with the blood of God to bring life and joy and Thanksgiving and reality of his word heaven hallelujah huh you know receiving the Holy Ghost is not just you have an idea now I haven't hey man what good would the what do you think we would have a book of Acts Church if they set up there and they said well it's nine days brethren I think we've got it now I really believe we've got it didn't you feel nice after you you know they said no wait Jesus said wait till her and Jude from power from on high and they didn't know necessarily what they're looking for Jesus didn't say now on the day of Pentecost the the pillar of fire is going to come into the room and he's going to separate himself upon it my spirit is going to come and dwell that way in you and you're gonna act like a bunch of drunk people and Peter's gonna stand him and say this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel he didn't explain it that way he just said wait he just said wait and they waited for the reality and the reality came and they set the world on fire hallelujah and if your whole heart is now given over to him Simon the sorcerer he didn't receive the Holy Ghost because he wanted the Holy Ghost for money he got baptized he was walking with the believers but he was actually honest can I buy this this is not working for me because this whole heart wasn't given over to the Lord he wanted to use it for his own ambition and that's why he didn't receive it right brother Aaron tells us stories like a boxcar it gets packed up and I'll just use a shipping container I think boxcar some people might not know what a boxcars a shipping container you pack it right and then it's sealed up right it's locked it's sealed and sent to its destination but first that shipping container has to be checked has it been packed right if it's packed wrong then all the goods can be broken and then all it is is a call to the insurance company this is broken right so it's going to be packed right and when it's packed right then the seals put on and then it's sealed until it gets to its destination and no one can break that seal until it gets there it's the same thing with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost comes and inspects our lives and when we're packed right well how you packed right you got to give everything you are to him all of your ambition all of your hopes and plans all of your desires you can't hold you do not have something in reserve I mean you can't have anything in reserve and say lord I give you my heart but this part of me I'll keep like a way out or a exit or something you know if this doesn't work I'll try this no you can't do that you've got to jump in yeah amen who's ever been on a really high place and jumped into some water and there's that brief second we're like should I should I should I should but then once you do you know you can't stop because you've jumped you owe you you've jumped your whole self in it's too late I mean you're now you know falling you can't you can't you know that same thing with the Lord you can't just you know you can't have a rope tied to you and then say now I'm going to jump and you actually kind of abseiling down no you can't do that you've got to jump you've got to give your whole self every part of you you have to surrender to him if you seek me with my your whole heart then you shall find me not was just a little bit of yourself well everyone else is doing it and you know it seems like a good idea and you know maybe mommy and daddy might like me more so give it a go no you've got to jump man you've got to jump and once you jump I tell you the splash is wonderful hey I never regretted it I don't mean that as a joke hey you'll never regret it but there's always that fear cuz you got to die it's going to be a real death death the self yeah deny yourself take up your cross and follow him it's going to be nice but what about everything I want know if there's a pool I would just jump and you say even if not I'll say Lord I'm coming anyway I'm coming anyway there's something in there for me and and I'm gonna come get it thank you hallelujah
