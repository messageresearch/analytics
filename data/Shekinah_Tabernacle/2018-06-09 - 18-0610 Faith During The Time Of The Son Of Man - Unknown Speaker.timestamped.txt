[36:54] oh god bless you great have you both
[36:56] Amen let's um yeah let's just turn to
[37:00] the scriptures turn to Matthew chapter
[37:03] 15 and their trusty ones had a good week
[37:10] we're gonna read Matthew 15 read from
[37:17] verse 10 there we go Matthew 15 verse 10
[37:28] we're gonna read down to verse 28 of a
[37:33] lengthy reading but here with me it says
[37:37] and he called the multitude and said
[37:40] unto them hear and understand not that
[37:43] which cometh which goeth into the mouth
[37:46] defileth a man but that which cometh out
[37:49] of the mouth this defileth a man then
[37:52] came his disciples and said unto Him
[37:53] knowest thou that the Pharisees were
[37:56] offended after they heard the saying but
[37:59] he answered and said every plant which
[38:01] my Heavenly Father hath not planted
[38:03] shall be rooted up he says let them
[38:09] alone they be blind leaders of the blind
[38:12] and if the blind lead the blind they
[38:14] shall fall into the ditch the in'
[38:16] answered Peter and said unto Him declare
[38:18] unto us this parable and Jesus said are
[38:21] you also yet without understanding do ye
[38:24] do not yet understand that whatsoever
[38:29] entereth in it the mouth goeth into the
[38:31] belly and is cast out into the draught
[38:35] but those things which proceed out of
[38:38] the mouth come forth from the heart and
[38:41] they defile the man proud of the heart
[38:43] proceeds
[38:44] I mean proceed evil thoughts murders
[38:46] adulteries fornications there
[38:49] false witnesses blasphemies these are
[38:52] the things which defile a man but to eat
[38:55] with unwashen hands defileth not a man
[38:58] now notice so we've just read this and
[39:00] we're just gonna continue reading on so
[39:03] he's saying it's not what you do
[39:04] physically with unwashed hands and what
[39:06] they were all caught up and it's what
[39:08] comes out of your heart defiles you what
[39:10] comes out of the mouth and then we come
[39:12] into this immediately after this he's
[39:14] showing then then we have this story of
[39:18] those rinsing how the scriptures written
[39:21] here then Jesus went thence and departed
[39:23] into the coasts of Tyre and and Sudan
[39:26] and behold a woman of cane and came out
[39:29] of the same coasts and cried unto him
[39:31] saying have mercy on me O Lord what's
[39:34] what's coming out of her heart now just
[39:36] just what what's coming out of her heart
[39:37] have mercy on me O Lord thou son of
[39:40] David my daughter is grievously vexed
[39:42] with a devil but he answered her not a
[39:45] word and his disciples came and besought
[39:47] him saying send her away for she cries
[39:50] after us was she's actually only crying
[39:53] after him anyway and but he answered and
[39:56] said I am NOT sent I am not sent but
[39:59] unto the lost sheep of the house of
[40:00] Israel then came she and worshipped him
[40:04] saying the Lord help me but he answered
[40:07] and said it is not meet to take the
[40:10] children's bread and to cast it to dogs
[40:12] and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat
[40:17] of the crumbs which fall from their
[40:19] master's table then jesus answered a
[40:22] sinner said unto her o woman great as
[40:25] thy faith be it unto thee even as their
[40:28] will and her daughter was made whole
[40:31] from that very hour I mean let's just
[40:34] bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[40:36] gracious father we're so thankful that
[40:38] Lord you are present among us Lord Jesus
[40:41] by your grace you have come down it's
[40:44] not just us being identified with you
[40:46] but you've come to be identified with us
[40:48] Lord by your Redemption and father we
[40:50] just want to pray as we have read from
[40:52] your scriptures now Lord I probably say
[40:55] to every service but anyone can that can
[40:57] read can read your word but it takes you
[40:59] to make it live so father Lord you being
[41:01] the great author of your word may
[41:03] and manifest at now Lord anchored into
[41:06] every soul Lord may we walk out of this
[41:08] place Lord changed Lord more like you
[41:12] molded and shaped into your image Lord
[41:14] take your word and by your Holy Spirit
[41:15] may you just engrave it into the tables
[41:17] of our hearts father Lord may you grant
[41:20] that Lord we just want to commit the
[41:21] service into your hands Lord we just
[41:23] think of the fray homely in Arizona
[41:26] Lord Jesus brother Daniel's mother
[41:29] they're going into Hospice
[41:31] father I pray Lord you would be very
[41:33] present Lord be law these last don't
[41:36] know how long Lord she will remain on
[41:38] the earth being up in years but father
[41:40] you know Lord that time and Lord we just
[41:43] pray that she'll be ready to cross Lord
[41:45] that when she leaves this world she'll
[41:47] go into your presence Lord Lord may you
[41:50] grab that father we want to pray for a
[41:51] little sophocles Lord with a high
[41:52] temperature father may he touches body
[41:55] Lord take that away from him father Lord
[41:57] may you heal them completely Lord for
[41:59] your glory and Lord we also want to pray
[42:02] for brother Andy and brother Adrian
[42:03] father Lord may you just be with them as
[42:06] they're ministering soon or Lord I don't
[42:09] know what the time is time difference
[42:11] exactly but father may be a resurrection
[42:13] day Lord God and Vietnam Lord may many
[42:16] of your children go from death to life
[42:18] father by your word anointing them as
[42:21] they Lord take them out of the way and
[42:23] speak through them the words of life
[42:24] father Lord there would be a
[42:26] resurrection day in Vietnam father may
[42:28] you grant it Lord and we just want to
[42:30] commit ourselves into your hands as well
[42:32] Lord in Jesus Christ name Amen
[42:35] I mean God bless you all you may have
[42:37] your seats this morning so I've got a
[42:42] few technical things difficulties going
[42:45] on but just just be with us today so I
[42:48] want to talk about faith during the time
[42:51] of the Son of Man now we understand that
[42:55] the scripture is repeated the same Jesus
[42:57] that walked in the on the shores of
[42:59] Galilee is here not in that physical
[43:01] format the same God as among us and we
[43:03] see his people here approach him in that
[43:07] day they approach him in this day in the
[43:09] same manner we have the scribes and
[43:10] Pharisees they they mocked or made fun
[43:13] of them they got their reward but there
[43:15] were people like this this Gentile
[43:17] and we read about that she approached
[43:19] him and she got her reward and it all
[43:22] depends how you approach the work today
[43:24] as what you'll get you'll either get a
[43:26] good reward or a very bad one it's like
[43:28] the woman with the blood issue she said
[43:30] if I could but touch the hem of His
[43:31] garment I'll be made whole she knew that
[43:34] he had what she needed and she was
[43:37] determined that she will get what she
[43:39] needs and it must be the same thing
[43:41] because this society we live in is very
[43:44] much because you know there's good
[43:46] things about the society but there's bad
[43:48] things it's good that the state can look
[43:50] after us if we're homeless
[43:51] right so it's so in that way it's good
[43:53] but in a way it's bad because we can
[43:55] just sit back and someone else will take
[43:57] care of it you know there's not a you
[43:59] know it's just as she'll be right mate
[44:00] let's just cruise let's take it easy
[44:02] there's not a real grit determination
[44:05] you know I must get what I need you
[44:08] understand and I'm talking about
[44:10] spiritual things more in that way will
[44:11] you just sit back and watch the world go
[44:13] by and nothing's all that bad and you
[44:15] know it's all fine we've got to throw
[44:17] that off right we should have some
[44:20] determination and I'll walk with God God
[44:22] you have precious promises you've given
[44:25] them given them to me I mean by your
[44:28] sacrifice of Calvary
[44:29] I want to possess those promises I don't
[44:32] just want a little bit of the
[44:33] inheritance
[44:34] I want everything you've given me I want
[44:36] to possess the whole thing I want to see
[44:37] how it works I want to try it out I want
[44:40] to test it I want to test into the
[44:41] fullness of its abilities I don't just
[44:43] want to look at it I want to possess it
[44:45] you ever seen a child Christmas or
[44:48] birthday they just open a present take
[44:49] off the wrapping and they leave it in
[44:51] the box
[44:51] have you ever seen a child like that
[44:53] they don't say well that's nice and I'll
[44:56] just leave it here and no they're
[44:57] ripping the thing out you know they're
[44:59] taking the taking out of the package
[45:00] they're not worried about breakfast in
[45:02] are worried about anything else they
[45:03] want to play with their toy and then
[45:05] they get on it the may like a bike and
[45:07] they're up and down and up and down up
[45:09] and down and you know they want to see
[45:11] what it can do we should be like that
[45:13] with the Word of God don't just look at
[45:16] the wrapping and say well that's nice
[45:18] wrapping or bad wrapping or whatever you
[45:20] consider it you know look what has he
[45:22] given me as the Bride of Christ what has
[45:24] he given me I want to enjoy it when
[45:27] someone gives a gift they want to see
[45:28] the person enjoy that
[45:30] I mean they want to see do they really
[45:32] enjoy what I've given do they really
[45:34] appreciate it and it should be the same
[45:36] thing with us now God has given us his
[45:38] word it's been unveiled in this hour
[45:40] we're not guessing at it we know what we
[45:43] know our position in Christ we know what
[45:45] his promises are for us we shouldn't
[45:47] just say well that's nice we say I want
[45:49] to enjoy this I mean I want to enjoy
[45:51] this word and see what God has done for
[45:53] me right so this woman had a
[45:56] determination she wasn't willing just to
[45:59] look at this you know discouragement
[46:02] that she could have just gone off from
[46:03] the first from the first instance he
[46:06] just did he just ignored her she knew
[46:09] this is the source of the healing of a
[46:11] over of a daughter right and then but
[46:15] then she approaches him as a son of
[46:17] David she's a Gentile she has no claim
[46:19] on him a son of David but he just fled
[46:21] ignores her and then even the disciples
[46:24] say send her away for she Christ after
[46:26] us okay our faith is going to go beyond
[46:30] it's got to go beyond people
[46:33] discouraging us or beyond circumstances
[46:35] that don't work our way
[46:37] amen if you have real faith you know
[46:39] it's there for you it's not all it's not
[46:42] I hope it'll work you know to work you
[46:44] know the promises yeah amen you know it
[46:46] will manifest you're going to piss
[46:48] through the discouragement right you're
[46:50] a pest through the circumstance she was
[46:52] determined she was determined she had
[46:55] nothing else to lean on she only had the
[46:57] source of the the fountain of eternal
[47:00] life and she knew it was him right we
[47:03] have to be this way friends we need a
[47:05] bit of gumption we need a bit of rawness
[47:07] you're a bit of determination I will not
[47:10] leave you till you bless me
[47:12] amen on I'll leave your presence till
[47:14] you change me I mean I'm not leaving
[47:16] till you transform me renew me whatever
[47:18] I need wash me cleanse me by your word
[47:21] I'll not leave your presence until you
[47:23] change me that should be our
[47:25] determination I mean as a bride is going
[47:27] to walk out of this earth victorious I
[47:30] want to be in that number I don't just
[47:32] want to be under the effect of a group
[47:34] of a church but I want to take a rapture
[47:36] like as many of we
[47:38] we'll feel the pull of the hour but
[47:40] they'll be left behind don't feel just
[47:42] to pull of the hour be left behind feel
[47:44] the pull respond and and go right
[47:48] because it's why the atmosphere so I
[47:49] such a charged atmosphere where God's
[47:51] children gather because God's there it
[47:53] wants to get your attention he wants to
[47:56] wake you up out of this lady or C&H wake
[47:58] up children it's time to go we don't
[48:01] want to just sit back and he said that's
[48:03] pretty intense gods and teens because
[48:06] God wants you to walk on streets of gold
[48:08] he wants you there more than you want to
[48:10] be there he wants to give you a body
[48:12] change more than you want it right he's
[48:14] intense hallelujah
[48:17] there's a power in this room amen to set
[48:19] you free if you'll receive it so she had
[48:23] a bit of discouragement and it was God
[48:26] Himself was the one who was trying to
[48:28] throw her off God does that sometimes to
[48:31] you what's the heat because he really
[48:34] wants to see as your as your faith
[48:36] genuine or is it just because
[48:38] everything's going well do you worship
[48:40] Him because life is easy or because you
[48:43] receive some kind of blessing I move
[48:45] being lost and I'm done I pray God and I
[48:47] was I was going to be kicked out of the
[48:49] Hall as in at university I had no money
[48:51] I said god I need a job and I got a job
[48:53] the next week think God answers prayer
[48:56] whatever condition you babe you know you
[48:58] may be in but what I'm saying is you
[49:01] don't just want to just because he's
[49:03] good to you
[49:04] I didn't worship him just cause he was
[49:05] good to me I wish him now because he
[49:07] died for me he redeemed me right many
[49:10] people say why he's good to me he's a
[49:11] good God he's going to be more than just
[49:13] a good god to you right
[49:15] I don't worship him because things are
[49:17] just going well that's irrelevant the
[49:20] status of life here and it's irrelevant
[49:21] you worship Him because of who he is and
[49:24] because he's revealed themselves to you
[49:26] that's why we're Christians is it not
[49:28] because he's the very lord of glories
[49:30] made himself known through the same time
[49:32] message Jesus Christ has been revealed
[49:34] he's made himself known unto you and
[49:36] that's why you worship Him I trust
[49:38] that's why not because life is good or
[49:40] bad or whatever worship him anyway
[49:43] because the devil that's why the devil
[49:45] he said do you know you know he said to
[49:47] God about job the only reason Jobe
[49:49] worships you is because everything goes
[49:51] well
[49:52] I'll prove that's wrong God has to have
[49:56] some jobs and your trial may never be as
[50:00] Extreme as Jobs was but you're still
[50:03] having but a hardship because God is
[50:05] willing to show Satan you see this one
[50:07] actually is perfect
[50:08] this one is perfect there's none like
[50:10] them in this place because they worship
[50:13] me doesn't matter if it's good or bad
[50:14] they still love me the Lord giveth the
[50:17] Lord taketh away blessed be the name of
[50:18] the Lord
[50:19] that was job's response he didn't
[50:21] understand what was going on he didn't
[50:23] have the understanding we have even have
[50:25] the revelation we we have all he had was
[50:27] take the lamb it's gonna be without
[50:29] blemish off of the lamb you're accepted
[50:31] that's all he had that's nothing
[50:33] compared to what we have right and you
[50:36] he could stand there just on that
[50:38] sacrifice because God said so because
[50:40] God ordained this way and he just stood
[50:42] there on that he didn't understand he
[50:44] said if a tree or a tree you know you
[50:46] know he could see a nature God and
[50:48] nature of flower comes up in the
[50:50] springtime comes in his beauty autumn
[50:52] time it dies he goes into the ground
[50:54] comes back to life again you know that
[50:56] you're the next spring he saw the death
[50:58] burial resurrection of nature they said
[51:00] a man he dies where does he go he had no
[51:02] idea it he could stand there on that on
[51:05] that lamb sacrifice amen and we've had
[51:10] someone go beyond the curtain of time
[51:11] and come back I mean if he can tell
[51:14] someone where their addresses and what
[51:15] they're wrong with them and you know I
[51:17] believe that same vision is true right
[51:20] so we've had we've had evidence in this
[51:23] hour not just in the word but in this
[51:24] hour if someone has gone beyond the
[51:26] curtain of time amen
[51:29] so we have a lot more we know our
[51:31] Redeemer liveth right I know my redeemer
[51:34] lives not because someone told me
[51:37] because he came to me amen and I know
[51:40] that there'll be a day that I'll stand
[51:41] on this earth with him hallelujah I
[51:44] trust you can say yeah that's happened
[51:46] to me too because it changes everything
[51:49] because life is but a vapor but yet when
[51:52] all things are done we'll still be
[51:54] rejoicing in him so now if she was I'm
[51:58] just going to break this down but
[51:59] remember we read before the scripture
[52:01] Jesus says it's what comes out of the
[52:03] heart defiles the men what comes out of
[52:06] your heart
[52:06] what do you speak that really defiles
[52:08] you so I'm taking notes interesting how
[52:10] he talks about that he goes and then
[52:12] this account is here
[52:13] he's showing what actually also comes
[52:15] out of your heart will redeem you will
[52:17] help you will heal you will deliver you
[52:19] your response right and so he answered
[52:23] and said I'm not sent but the lost house
[52:25] of a lost sheep of the house of Israel
[52:28] being came she and worshipped him saying
[52:30] lord help me so she changed her approach
[52:32] because he is Lord of all so it's just
[52:35] Lord helped me not son of David because
[52:37] she wasn't a Jew he's only son of David
[52:40] to the Jew so she had no approach to him
[52:42] that way but Lord
[52:44] he's Lord of all so lord help me so now
[52:48] she's a prey and she's coming even more
[52:49] humble just help me help me but then he
[52:53] answered and said it's not meet to take
[52:55] the children's bread and cast it to dogs
[52:57] he's saying you're not even worthy to
[52:59] receive her any of us Oh
[53:02] put yourself in her shoes what would
[53:05] have you done oh this is a judgmental
[53:07] God Oh huh look how critical he is oh
[53:10] I'm done I'll find something else she
[53:13] wasn't like that she knew that this was
[53:16] the only source she knew it was him she
[53:19] knew this is what he need what she
[53:21] needed for her daughter was in him and
[53:23] nothing discouraged her because she knew
[53:26] the source right and she kept going
[53:28] until I get ahold of that source and she
[53:33] said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the
[53:36] crumbs which fall from their master's
[53:37] table I may be that Lord but I'll Here I
[53:40] am they still get something they still
[53:44] get something hallelujah then jesus
[53:47] answered and said unto her o woman great
[53:49] is thy faith I'd like that when he when
[53:52] he would write my epitaph or whatever
[53:55] greatest though his faith was great her
[53:58] faith was great
[54:00] she stood great tests great adversity I
[54:03] tried to even discourage her but she
[54:05] still kept going
[54:07] what about is that you it has to be you
[54:10] if this is Gentile faith when the Son of
[54:13] Man was here the first time it'll be
[54:14] Gentile faith when he returns right to
[54:17] this same faith we'll be in a people now
[54:19] so I trust you can say yeah this is me
[54:22] doesn't matter what my family does what
[54:24] people say what people do I'm walking on
[54:27] with you Lord Jesus I'm walking on amen
[54:32] beard unto thee even as thou will and
[54:35] her daughter was made whole from that
[54:38] very hour amen you mean you can go to
[54:42] God and you can get what you need and a
[54:44] devil can be cast off someone absolutely
[54:47] absolutely
[54:48] it happened here it happens now that
[54:51] same God is present upon the earth he's
[54:54] not just up in heaven he's present I
[54:55] mean we can't touch the hem of his
[54:57] garment by faith that's what he said
[55:00] that's what Paul says in the book of
[55:01] Hebrews we have a high priest we can
[55:03] touch by the feeling of our infirmities
[55:05] right and he is still our high priest
[55:08] that's why brother Branham was there and
[55:09] and and he point someone out in the
[55:11] audience you this is what you're praying
[55:13] for this is what's wrong with you this
[55:15] person listen they said who did they
[55:17] touch they're 20 30 feet from me they
[55:19] touch the high priest they couldn't
[55:22] touch me because they're there they
[55:23] touch the high priest because the high
[55:24] priest was on the platform revealing I
[55:27] mean through that vessel what they
[55:29] needed because they by faith that's the
[55:30] high priest the high priest was there
[55:33] hallelujah and that same high priest is
[55:35] present amen that is not pie in the sky
[55:40] whatever you want to that's reality
[55:42] that's reality that same Jesus that was
[55:45] there is here amen
[55:47] I believe it no this isn't perseverant
[55:56] and here's the word made manifest you
[56:01] can tell him the word and he'll say Amen

[56:06] will say I don't know about that seed

[56:10] he's going
[56:11] he don't know where he come from he's in
[56:14] an awful shape that woman wasn't that

[56:21] got ahold of something you didn't have
[56:24] to baby here and spray her and say now

[57:24] the Pentecostal Church today we've got
[57:26] Pentecostal babies that's just being
[57:28] sprinkled and sprayed with this and that
[57:30] the other till they run out to a bunch
[57:32] of hybrids what we need today as a house
[57:35] cleaning from the pulpit all the way to
[57:37] the janitor and start over again and get
[57:39] some genuine faith born into the people
[57:42] what's a genuine faith take God at His
[57:44] Word

[57:48] circumstance what do you think about it
[57:50] what do you think take him at his word
[57:52] real genuine faith is only believe the
[57:55] word right that is real genuine faith
[57:58] it's not how you feel I mean because if
[58:01] you just go by feeling you'll feel
[58:02] wonderful one day and you'll feel
[58:04] terrible the next and when you're
[58:05] feeling wonderful you think I'm ready
[58:07] for a rapture when you're feeling
[58:08] terrible you think how am I ever going
[58:10] to get there and the devil takes your
[58:12] feelings and beat you around

[58:37] Lazarus oh I love that you say brother
[58:40] branham I being this way a long time but
[58:42] even now brother bran the doctor told me
[58:45] I had a heart trouble I might die at any

[58:52] even now Lord whatever you ask God God
[58:56] will give it to you he's sitting at the
[58:58] right hand of the Father to make
[58:59] intercession even now Lord whatever you
[59:02] ask God God will give it to you I can
[59:05] see him this is now Jesus Lazarus tomb
[59:08] he goes there this is a woman's faith in
[59:10] the time of the Son of Man he goes in
[59:12] Mary and Martha have already called for
[59:14] for Jesus to come Lazarus was sick he
[59:17] doesn't go he he actually goes the other
[59:20] way and then he's dead he's been in the
[59:23] grave for days now I'll go wake him and
[59:25] then when they both go out does it oh
[59:27] you know if you had come Lord my my
[59:30] brother wouldn't have died but even now
[59:31] even now I know he can come back to life
[59:34] even now I trust you have that in your
[59:37] heart even now lord I may be in the
[59:39] state for a long time but even now even
[59:41] now you can change me even now you can
[59:44] change my situation even a content I
[59:46] look at your work even now Lord I've
[59:49] been in this slump for a long time even
[59:51] now even though challenge God
[59:55] that's my silent scream challenge God
[59:57] don't just sit he's wanting to see what
[1:00:00] are you gonna do I've been this way even
[1:00:03] now we don't have to put up with the
[1:00:07] status quo we don't have to wait for a
[1:00:09] new years to turn or turn a new leaf and
[1:00:11] make a resolution because that doesn't
[1:00:13] do any good anyway don't weigh for a
[1:00:14] time and the county say even now right
[1:00:16] now in the present even now Lord I can
[1:00:24] see him he wasn't much to look at way to
[1:00:27] by sorry about there there we go
[1:00:34] actually yeah we'll read it then we'll
[1:00:36] come back to that technology now see I
[1:00:41] can see him he wasn't much to look at at
[1:00:43] the bottom of the court the Bible said
[1:00:44] there's no beauty that we should desire
[1:00:45] him he wasn't a great big six-four
[1:00:49] he was a little frail fellow he
[1:00:51] straightened up his little frame up
[1:00:53] stopped and the shoulders as he was he
[1:00:56] said he was grain as bed before your
[1:00:58] city is all before he he stooped in his
[1:01:00] shoulders like they said thy brother
[1:01:02] shall rise again oh my she said yes Lord
[1:01:04] I know he'll raise again at the last day
[1:01:07] was what he said this for the account
[1:01:09] but that's not what he's wanting to get
[1:01:11] you to understand because we all
[1:01:13] understand yes one day one day it'll
[1:01:15] happen one day we'll take a rapture one
[1:01:18] day we'll be fine
[1:01:19] one day I'll be healed God doesn't want
[1:01:21] you to pull off one day he wants you to
[1:01:23] bring into the present and this is where
[1:01:25] they were they're staying before the
[1:01:27] tomb God Jesus is speaking to speaking
[1:01:30] to Mary or Martha and she says yes one
[1:01:33] day he'll raise again the general
[1:01:34] resurrection be sure I said no don't
[1:01:36] don't look there we look here I am the
[1:01:39] resurrection life leave Earth Alice do
[1:01:42] you believe this I am presently now the
[1:01:44] resurrection the life Jesus asked her
[1:01:46] amen
[1:01:47] and so he wants to ask you the same
[1:01:50] question
[1:01:51] he wants you to have the same faith not
[1:01:53] in the not in the not in the future now
[1:01:57] even now presently now I know them Jews
[1:02:04] believed in the general resurrection see
[1:02:06] I know he will raise at that last day he
[1:02:09] was a good boy and God will raise him up
[1:02:11] at the last day I can see Jesus say but
[1:02:13] I am the resurrection and the life I am
[1:02:16] NOT I will be I was I am present tense
[1:02:20] and he still is the resurrection and the
[1:02:23] life present tense the Son of man
[1:02:26] present tense
[1:02:28] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:02:30] and forever today is the main part we
[1:02:33] should emphasize he's the same today as
[1:02:36] he was yesterday I am the resurrection
[1:02:41] life he that believeth in me shall never
[1:02:43] die
[1:02:43] oh my he said I am the resurrection life
[1:02:46] saith the LORD he that believeth in me
[1:02:49] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:02:51] whom so ever liveth and me shall and
[1:02:54] believeth in me shall never die so you'd
[1:02:55] believe without us she said yea Lord I
[1:02:58] believe you I believe you're just what
[1:03:01] you said you
[1:03:02] it's what comes out of the heart we're
[1:03:06] taking the officer from defile it
[1:03:07] redeems it's it's free it heals right
[1:03:11] what comes out of the heart what's your
[1:03:13] confession he's the high priest of our
[1:03:15] confession a profession so he can only
[1:03:18] act based on your confession his hands
[1:03:22] are tied until you confess it he can't
[1:03:25] do anything until you ask him right so
[1:03:29] so what are you confessing what are you
[1:03:31] professing it's entirely up to you now I
[1:03:36] believe you just I believe you're the
[1:03:39] Son of God I believe you're the lord of
[1:03:41] heaven that came down here on earth and
[1:03:43] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[1:03:45] you I believe that you're the son of God
[1:03:47] that was to come upon the earth
[1:03:48] oh my something has to happen something
[1:03:52] has to happen things were coming like
[1:03:54] this coming together oh my said where
[1:03:58] have you buried him see something has to
[1:04:01] happen when you have this kind of faith
[1:04:03] when you have this kind of confession
[1:04:05] just like Hedy right she said the right
[1:04:07] she said the right words that's nothing
[1:04:09] but the truth brother Brenham when he's
[1:04:11] telling about the squirrels then God
[1:04:13] came down ask what you will you got sick
[1:04:16] parents you've got a sister in the
[1:04:18] wheelchair you know you're poor ask for
[1:04:21] a million dollars it'll fall in your lap
[1:04:23] right now he challenged her but then but
[1:04:26] then she saw the her two boys and they
[1:04:29] are believers and God came down she said
[1:04:31] I want the salvation of my two boys
[1:04:33] spirit of God fell upon them they were
[1:04:35] laughing at the whole thing God got
[1:04:37] ahold of them right and they became
[1:04:39] believers because she responded to the
[1:04:41] testimony that's nothing but the truth
[1:04:44] this parent testimony and the same God
[1:04:47] that was there you say well brother
[1:04:49] Browns gone we can't have that kind of
[1:04:50] result yes you can when the word goes
[1:04:53] forth you say there's nothing something
[1:04:54] should anchor in your soul that's
[1:04:56] nothing but the truth hallelujah I
[1:04:58] believe God have given what you need
[1:05:00] I happen to believe the same God was
[1:05:04] theirs here I'm just that maybe if you
[1:05:07] call me crazy I'm very happy being this
[1:05:10] way because he's present he's with us
[1:05:12] he's holding us by the hand we don't
[1:05:15] need to work at
[1:05:16] he's working it out amen
[1:05:19] that's nothing about the truth brother
[1:05:20] branham and she received salvation amen
[1:05:24] for her two sons for her family under
[1:05:26] the third poll she received that and
[1:05:27] it's more there should be more than a
[1:05:29] story to you there should be yes Lord
[1:05:32] you are the same God today we have the
[1:05:34] same kind of needs with the same kind of
[1:05:36] burdens we can't humanly do it we need
[1:05:39] you to come and do it but it all depends
[1:05:42] on your response if she laughed they
[1:05:45] would have stayed unbelievers if she was
[1:05:47] indifferent she would have stayed they
[1:05:50] would have stayed unbelievers if she
[1:05:52] doubted they would have stayed their way
[1:05:53] but something interstate I believe that
[1:05:55] she didn't say where you got to show me
[1:05:57] a squirrel show me evidence she said
[1:05:58] just believe that a man as she got what
[1:06:01] she needed
[1:06:03] hallelujah now we're going back to this
[1:06:06] I said I'd read it no he says here he
[1:06:14] says he that exalts himself shall be
[1:06:15] abased the way up as always as down
[1:06:18] always remember she never had seen a
[1:06:21] miracle she was a Gentile but she had
[1:06:24] faith to speak of the woman we read
[1:06:25] about she had never seen a miracle she
[1:06:27] was a Gentile but she had faith she was
[1:06:29] something like the harlot Rahab she said
[1:06:32] to the spies she didn't say well wait
[1:06:34] till I see how Joshua Combs is here or
[1:06:37] how does your generals how do they look
[1:06:39] at what kind of swords to do use what
[1:06:42] kind of instruments have you got what
[1:06:44] kind of warfare she said I've heard that
[1:06:46] God's with you that's good enough for me
[1:06:48] I want mercy she believed faith cometh
[1:06:51] by hearing and hearing the Word of God
[1:06:52] watch for this saying for the Saint
[1:06:56] Jesus here because she was persistent
[1:06:57] and coming now first she called him son
[1:07:00] of David but but now now she had as a
[1:07:05] Gentile no claims on him of son of David
[1:07:07] but when she said Lord he gay he was her
[1:07:11] Lord but not son of David to it she had
[1:07:13] the right approach to God's gift and
[1:07:15] that's the only way ever to receive
[1:07:17] anything is to come the right approach
[1:07:21] right you got to come the right way and
[1:07:23] you'll get what you need
[1:07:29] amen now we're just gonna one day there
[1:07:37] won't be a PowerPoint now I am the
[1:07:41] resurrection and life I hope you don't
[1:07:44] mind that's reading he that believeth in
[1:07:47] me shall never die
[1:07:48] my he said I'm resurrection life saith
[1:07:50] the Lord he that believeth in me though
[1:07:53] he were dead yet shall he live but
[1:07:56] whatever liveth shall I believe with him
[1:07:58] me shall never die believe without us
[1:08:00] she said yay Lord I believe you I
[1:08:02] believe so I'm just rereading this again
[1:08:04] because I want to get down to the bottom
[1:08:06] leave it the others she said yeah Lord I
[1:08:08] believe you I believe you're just what
[1:08:11] you said you were I believe you're the
[1:08:13] Son of God I believe you're the Lord of
[1:08:14] Heaven that come down here on earth and
[1:08:17] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[1:08:19] you I believe that you're the son of man
[1:08:22] that was going to come upon the earth
[1:08:23] oh my something has to happen something
[1:08:26] has to happen things were coming like
[1:08:28] this something our coming together
[1:08:30] oh my seed where have you buried him
[1:08:33] come and see here he goes a little lady
[1:08:36] belong to certain church tried to argue
[1:08:39] with me not longer a scientist Church
[1:08:41] note everything scientifically she said
[1:08:43] Reverend Branham do you mean to tell me
[1:08:46] that you believe he was divine I said I
[1:08:49] know he was divine she said he was just
[1:08:51] a man I said he was more than a man and
[1:08:54] you've got to have the same corner he
[1:08:56] was more than a Jew he was more than
[1:08:58] just a prophet he was the God prophet
[1:09:01] right now we're just gonna go but a
[1:09:08] certain direction he says now in Hebrews
[1:09:10] 11:6 but without faith it's impossible
[1:09:12] to please him for he that cometh to God
[1:09:15] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:09:18] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:09:21] Him right it's not casually seek Him or
[1:09:24] just to stab in the dark kind of seek
[1:09:26] Him diligently he rewards those that
[1:09:29] diligently seek Him right so if you but
[1:09:32] first you've got to know that he is not
[1:09:34] that he was I trust you haven't received
[1:09:36] this because of Western tradition that
[1:09:38] this is the Word of God because
[1:09:41] Western civilization by tradition says
[1:09:43] this is God's Word
[1:09:44] right but you've got to receive it more
[1:09:46] than tradition you got to actually have
[1:09:48] a revelation this is God in print right
[1:09:50] you've got to say this is more than a
[1:09:52] having many authors however long ago
[1:09:54] this is God in print right you actually
[1:09:57] actually have to have that understand
[1:09:59] you know that revelation this is more
[1:10:02] than some scribe this is God and print
[1:10:05] form it's more than just a nice nice
[1:10:08] book of ethics this is God in print
[1:10:10] right so you gotta believe that he is
[1:10:12] you had to believe his word --is and
[1:10:14] he's a reward of them that diligently
[1:10:16] seek him now that woman diligently
[1:10:20] sought him out and got what she needed
[1:10:22] there should be the same thing today but
[1:10:25] now also there's a change in people when
[1:10:28] they actually get in contact with them
[1:10:30] because now they're not looking at in
[1:10:32] just natural life they're looking to
[1:10:34] where they're going okay and then so
[1:10:37] here in Hebrews 11 further down this is
[1:10:40] after he's spoken about Abraham and
[1:10:41] Isaac and Jacob but all those different
[1:10:44] heroes of faith we we call us his
[1:10:47] Hebrews 11 it says these all died in
[1:10:49] faith having not received the promises
[1:10:51] but having seen them afar off and were
[1:10:54] persuaded of them and embraced them and
[1:10:57] confessed that they were strangers and
[1:10:59] pilgrims on the earth for they that say
[1:11:02] such things declare plainly that they
[1:11:04] seek a country so they didn't even
[1:11:06] receive the promise but they sort of
[1:11:08] far-off and even just seeing it afar off
[1:11:11] they embraced it their whole lives were
[1:11:13] changed because they saw the promise of
[1:11:15] far-off
[1:11:16] how about those with a promise is not
[1:11:18] afar off anymore but it's come nigh
[1:11:21] right the promise of the body changes
[1:11:23] and far off it's not it's not a hundred
[1:11:26] years away or maybe ten years away the
[1:11:29] promise is here you know it's not just
[1:11:31] all one day of people will be made in
[1:11:33] His image the promise is here right oh
[1:11:36] one day that people will grow into the
[1:11:37] fullness of the statue of Christ it's
[1:11:39] not one day it's now right if they can
[1:11:43] embrace the promises of far off and say
[1:11:45] we you know we are seeking a you know
[1:11:48] we're just strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:11:50] earth how much were people where the
[1:11:51] promise is not afar off
[1:11:53] that's what I'm saying the problems this
[1:11:55] is so up-to-date today
[1:11:57] this is today's newspaper the messages
[1:12:00] today's newspaper it's incredible to see
[1:12:03] the things that brother Bram said and
[1:12:04] now very much manifested it's not afar
[1:12:07] off it's here I mean so so if that was
[1:12:11] their testimony that we're just
[1:12:13] strangers and pilgrims on the earth
[1:12:14] we're just passing through
[1:12:15] how much more you and I we're very much
[1:12:18] Pilgrims and strangers we're very much
[1:12:20] in transit I've got my passport I've got
[1:12:23] my visa I'm just waiting for my plane
[1:12:26] hallelujah I trust that your how you
[1:12:30] live more than just yes that's true but
[1:12:32] and you say yes I'm waiting for my
[1:12:34] boarding call holy a my bags are packed
[1:12:37] I'm not turning back I'm not looking you
[1:12:40] know for any other place I'm on my way
[1:12:42] and truly if they had been mindful of
[1:12:45] that country from whence they came out
[1:12:47] of they might have had opportunity to
[1:12:50] have returned but now they desire a
[1:12:53] better country that is and heavenly
[1:12:56] where of God is not ashamed to call to
[1:12:58] be called their God for he has prepared
[1:13:00] for them a city they were not even
[1:13:04] mindful of the place they left this is
[1:13:07] how real the promise was afar they
[1:13:09] embraced it but it wasn't so real to
[1:13:12] them they weren't even mindful where
[1:13:13] they came from how about you and I amen
[1:13:19] he has proved it and it's not just
[1:13:21] prepared for the Emmis city he's
[1:13:22] prepared for us a city I mean we had a
[1:13:25] prophet come and tell you about the city
[1:13:27] tell you about the new body you're gonna
[1:13:29] step into so it's not just you know
[1:13:31] we're aware of where we're going and
[1:13:33] where we're going to live hallelujah so
[1:13:36] we shouldn't even be they weren't
[1:13:37] mindful where they came from
[1:13:38] I'm not mindful of the world I came out
[1:13:40] of I'm not even mindful of it oh yeah
[1:13:44] there's no I wouldn't I would there be
[1:13:46] my worst nightmare to have an
[1:13:47] opportunity to go back into it you know
[1:13:51] if it's such a great place why are we
[1:13:53] here
[1:13:53] all those who came out of the world if
[1:13:56] it's such a wonderful place why are you
[1:13:58] why are you not in it why have you come
[1:14:00] out amen if it's so great why are you
[1:14:03] here young people look at your parents
[1:14:05] if the world is so great why they
[1:14:07] yeah it's not a great place there's
[1:14:09] nothing for us there hallelujah
[1:14:13] I'm glad our inheritance isn't upon this
[1:14:15] earth it's in heaven amen
[1:14:19] now I like this this is this is just a
[1:14:22] leaper I love it how the people that
[1:14:26] came to the Lord that humanely should
[1:14:29] have received the promise were rejected
[1:14:31] like the scribes and Pharisees or the
[1:14:33] religious ones and those who are broken
[1:14:35] and full of this man for example full of
[1:14:38] leprosy the outcasts of society you know
[1:14:41] the Gentiles who here didn't even have a
[1:14:42] portion of the inheritance they came and
[1:14:44] got what they needed the illiterate
[1:14:46] fisherman became apostles the woman at
[1:14:49] the well became I mean she evangelized
[1:14:51] the whole city
[1:14:52] hallelujah she had greater success and
[1:14:54] the priests hallelujah I'm glad that's
[1:14:58] how God works don't you
[1:15:00] Amen now here we are and it came to pass
[1:15:03] when he was in a certain city behold a
[1:15:06] man full of leprosy so not just the
[1:15:08] start of leprosy he was full of leprosy
[1:15:11] who seeing Jesus fell on his face and
[1:15:13] besought him saying lord if thou wilt
[1:15:17] thou canst make me clean and he put for
[1:15:21] this hand and touched him saying I will
[1:15:23] be thou clean and immediately the
[1:15:26] leprosy departed from him now he was a
[1:15:29] man he was full of leprosy leprosy is a
[1:15:31] type of sin in the Bible we know this
[1:15:33] man was full of sin Hey not just the
[1:15:37] start of sin entering in his life and he
[1:15:38] starting his backslide or whatever it is
[1:15:40] the world he was full of it he was it
[1:15:43] was a fully mature sickness but he knew
[1:15:46] that the Lord could heal him here's the
[1:15:49] fountain of healing here's the one who
[1:15:51] can heal this incurable disease he's a
[1:15:53] very source of it if thou will and of
[1:15:55] course he will eventually he is the
[1:15:58] fountain of healing
[1:15:59] he's a fountain of deliverance he's the
[1:16:01] founder of restoration of redemption of
[1:16:03] forgiveness amen
[1:16:06] he's and he wants to pour out amen he
[1:16:10] wants to give himself he wants to pour
[1:16:12] himself out so of course he say if thy
[1:16:14] will and the loss of course I will this
[1:16:17] is why I'm here this is my purpose of
[1:16:19] being manifested
[1:16:20] flesh is that the sick would be healed
[1:16:22] the loss would be found I mean the
[1:16:24] Brooklyn would be healed the
[1:16:26] demon-possessed would be made whole
[1:16:28] again
[1:16:28] hallelujah sways upon the earth I mean
[1:16:31] my people would be gathered to me
[1:16:34] hallelujah you have the same I trust you
[1:16:38] can say the same thing if that will of
[1:16:40] course a little sour will he had the
[1:16:42] right faith I know you can do it I just
[1:16:45] come he didn't say now you're obligated
[1:16:47] to me God this if I will I will and
[1:16:52] immediately the leprosy departed from
[1:16:55] him hallelujah we have to have their
[1:16:58] save got a faith he can and he will and
[1:17:01] he does not I might not not a maybe you
[1:17:06] know this is me if he's healed now if
[1:17:09] one of us promises a true all of us
[1:17:11] promises are true okay so if he's a
[1:17:14] healer
[1:17:14] he's a deliverer right and if he's a and
[1:17:17] also if he's a healer he fills with the
[1:17:19] Holy Ghost right and if he heals I'm
[1:17:22] just using the healing but to show all
[1:17:23] of his attributes are true if that's
[1:17:25] true right so if he's healed you I mean
[1:17:29] he will deliver you right if he's healed
[1:17:32] you he'll transform your body amen if
[1:17:36] he's healed you he'll take you in a
[1:17:37] rapture the same faith then get healing
[1:17:40] is the same way they can take a rapture
[1:17:43] he follow me Abraham had the same faith
[1:17:46] from what from from the first time we
[1:17:49] said depart out of thy country I'll take
[1:17:52] you to another place that same faith
[1:17:54] that took him there was the same faith
[1:17:56] that made him receive the promised son
[1:17:59] Amen we what why do we belittle our
[1:18:02] faith why do we put our human
[1:18:05] understanding on our faith a faith
[1:18:08] worked one time it'll work the second
[1:18:10] time and it'll work the next time and it
[1:18:12] work the next time but how God answers
[1:18:15] that faith is purely up to him right
[1:18:17] because sometimes you know if he just
[1:18:19] did this all the time would have no
[1:18:20] character because faith worketh patience
[1:18:23] and we'll come into that later
[1:18:24] so God God will heal us instantly he's
[1:18:27] the divine healer God or maybe precious
[1:18:29] of time maybe he'll use doctors maybe
[1:18:32] changing diet whatever will be God wants
[1:18:34] to show
[1:18:34] himself with all those different ways
[1:18:36] god is not a cookie cutter David took
[1:18:38] the sling he killed Goliath there's no
[1:18:40] record of of using a sling anymore he
[1:18:43] picks up a sword one time he goes into
[1:18:45] the battle there's some bleep race Lord
[1:18:47] should I go he says no don't go do this
[1:18:49] and he does another way and he wins the
[1:18:51] battle
[1:18:51] you know God you gotta be sensitive God
[1:18:53] how are you leading me through this
[1:18:55] trial
[1:18:56] I'm glad God's that way I'm glad God's
[1:18:59] not just a 1d or 2d you know he wants to
[1:19:03] express the fullness of his character to
[1:19:05] you you just have to be still and know
[1:19:08] that He is God amen no let's just
[1:19:13] continue this and he charged him to tell
[1:19:15] no man that go and show thyself to the
[1:19:18] priest and offer for thy cleansing
[1:19:21] according as Moses commanded for a
[1:19:22] testimony unto them but so much the more
[1:19:25] went there a Fame abroad of him and
[1:19:27] great multitudes came together to hear
[1:19:30] and to be healed by him for their
[1:19:31] infirmities and he withdrew himself into
[1:19:34] the wilderness and prayed
[1:19:36] hey that's what happens now they say now
[1:19:42] his Gentile faith as well that was a I
[1:19:44] think there was a Jew that leper now
[1:19:46] back in the Gentile faith this is the
[1:19:48] story of the Centurion now the Centurion
[1:19:51] had a understanding of God more than the
[1:19:54] scribes and Pharisees and we're going to
[1:19:56] see this and when Jesus was incident at
[1:19:58] Capernaum I'm trying to build faith
[1:20:00] today okay I want you to really if we
[1:20:03] could you know it's like Elijah with a
[1:20:05] servant there there in Dothan wherever
[1:20:07] they are you know the you know there
[1:20:09] yeah yeah the servant goes out and he
[1:20:10] any any basically oh you could say goes
[1:20:12] out in the morning put some milk bottles
[1:20:14] by the front front gate he sees all the
[1:20:16] Syrians camped about the city and he
[1:20:17] panics he goes to Elijah and says where
[1:20:20] we're surrounded we're gonna die
[1:20:22] basically they're gonna take the city
[1:20:23] that are after you and I'm your servant
[1:20:25] everything's going bad and Elijah is
[1:20:27] just relaxed don't worry about it
[1:20:29] everything's fine when's breakfast ready
[1:20:32] you know I'm just dramatized a little
[1:20:34] bit but but he wasn't he wasn't worried
[1:20:36] and he just prayed and he stood in his
[1:20:38] service still panicking he just says
[1:20:40] Lord open open the boy's eyes he sees
[1:20:44] the army of heaven
[1:20:45] encamped about the Prophet
[1:20:48] that servant was now more distressed
[1:20:50] about the army of heaven than the Syrian
[1:20:52] one he forgot about the Syrian one
[1:20:54] because he was now supernatural army
[1:20:56] that army was on the side but if God
[1:20:58] opened our eyes and saw the angels in
[1:21:00] the three and and any open their eyes we
[1:21:02] could see God here right we would be a
[1:21:05] lot more you know all the burdens of
[1:21:07] last week and next week and next month
[1:21:09] they'll just disappear because you'd
[1:21:11] understand God's with me yeah you know
[1:21:14] the armies of heaven a present
[1:21:15] hallelujah tis more for us and against
[1:21:18] us I mean and that's why Elijah's not
[1:21:21] worried and he goes out there smite them
[1:21:23] blind who you looking for and the very
[1:21:26] one that they're looking for they they
[1:21:27] can't even recognize them and they lead
[1:21:29] them to the capital Samaria I mean young
[1:21:32] you know there is a story but the
[1:21:35] Prophet wasn't worried prophet wasn't
[1:21:37] worried we shouldn't be worried right we
[1:21:40] shouldn't be worried he said well I
[1:21:41] don't feel the whole bunch but what does
[1:21:43] your faith tell you I happen to believe
[1:21:46] when he said and when he promised to me
[1:21:47] I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee I
[1:21:49] just believe it I just I just spent
[1:21:53] simple it's like a child you tell them
[1:21:55] something that's okay and they go off
[1:21:57] they just take it
[1:21:58] childlike faith they don't work it out
[1:22:01] and how's this going to happen and you
[1:22:03] know I do so many different things in
[1:22:05] the day will you be here and here and
[1:22:06] here know this okay
[1:22:07] he'll never I will never leave thee nor
[1:22:10] forsake thee thank you lord
[1:22:13] I happen to just take him at his word
[1:22:18] now here he comes into Capernaum and
[1:22:25] they came unto Him a Centurion
[1:22:27] beseeching him said Lord my servant life
[1:22:29] at home sick of the palsy grievously
[1:22:31] tormented and jesus said unto him saith
[1:22:34] unto him I will come and heal them now
[1:22:36] this is the Jews they need laying on of
[1:22:38] hands as a Josh more reducing like
[1:22:41] Jiraiya says daughter Jesus went into
[1:22:42] dry sirs house you know she was dead he
[1:22:45] your he dross called him to go to the
[1:22:49] house being a Jew but now he's a Gentile
[1:22:52] the Centurion answered said Lord I'm not
[1:22:55] worthy that thou should us come under my
[1:22:57] roof but Speak the word only and my
[1:23:00] servant shall
[1:23:01] be healed right for I'm a man under
[1:23:04] Authority having soldiers under me see
[1:23:05] this man yeah you know I just like his
[1:23:07] thinking soldiers under me and I say to
[1:23:10] this man go and he goes and to another
[1:23:12] come and he cometh into my servant do
[1:23:14] this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it
[1:23:16] he marvelled and said to them that
[1:23:19] followed their sounds you I have not
[1:23:22] found so great faith no not in Israel
[1:23:26] that's how great and the reason his
[1:23:28] faith was so great is because this
[1:23:31] centuries he just speak the word and my
[1:23:33] servant shall be healed
[1:23:34] so the servant had I mean the Centurion
[1:23:36] had a revelation that if God sends his
[1:23:39] word that's exactly the same as him
[1:23:41] being there so him sending his word that
[1:23:45] he'd be healed by his word was exactly
[1:23:47] the same to the Centurion as if Jesus
[1:23:49] himself was in the room right and this
[1:23:53] is Gentile faith he has sent his word
[1:23:56] upon the earth right he has sent his
[1:23:59] word upon the earth and its fullness has
[1:24:02] been poured out amen that's why so G so
[1:24:05] his if his word is here because he is
[1:24:08] his word he is present does Gentile
[1:24:12] faith right he's already sent his word
[1:24:14] it's already been released he's already
[1:24:16] here to do what he said he would do
[1:24:19] hallelujah that's real Gentile faith
[1:24:22] although Gentiles how are we today
[1:24:25] hallelujah now beer be this in mind that
[1:24:30] Roman knew that every sickness and
[1:24:32] disease was subject to his word now if
[1:24:35] you can realize the same it's all over
[1:24:38] see when you can realize the same that
[1:24:40] every demon every sickness every disease
[1:24:42] every affliction is subject to the word
[1:24:45] of God just speak the word and my
[1:24:47] servant will get well amen it's already
[1:24:51] done he's already we have to
[1:24:56] I trusted the same faith God's here I'm
[1:25:00] not talking about these four walls
[1:25:01] wherever you are I trust he's with you
[1:25:04] wherever you go right he's already sent
[1:25:08] his word upon the earth now
[1:25:14] my brethren count it all joy when you
[1:25:16] fall into divers temptations knowing
[1:25:19] this that the trying of your faith
[1:25:20] worketh patience faith trying of your
[1:25:24] faith worketh patience but let patience
[1:25:26] have her perfect work that ye may be
[1:25:29] perfect and entire wanting nothing so
[1:25:33] when your faith has tried it works
[1:25:34] patience we all need patience right in
[1:25:38] this instant world we need patience and
[1:25:41] that's when our faith has tried as when
[1:25:43] it seems that the promise is lingering
[1:25:45] but God is looking to test you do you
[1:25:48] serve Him just because he's like an
[1:25:49] errand boy or a you know magic rabbit
[1:25:53] foot that you rub and you get what you
[1:25:54] want or is it because he is God faith
[1:25:59] worketh patience now therefore being
[1:26:05] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:26:07] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:26:11] whom also we have access by faith into
[1:26:13] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[1:26:16] in hope of the glory of God and not only
[1:26:20] and not only so but we glory in
[1:26:23] tribulations also do we glory in
[1:26:29] tribulations
[1:26:30] hallelujah things are going terrible
[1:26:32] glory to God God has a purpose of doing
[1:26:35] it they meant just like the Sarah
[1:26:38] Phoenician woman there you know that
[1:26:40] that that God was trying to discourage
[1:26:42] when it when she is going to get healing
[1:26:43] for her daughter right God has a purpose
[1:26:46] of doing it to see to see what's really
[1:26:49] in you right and now also act okay
[1:26:54] mister yeah and not only so we glory in
[1:26:57] tribulations also knowing that
[1:26:58] tribulation worketh patience we have to
[1:27:01] have supreme confidence you have to have
[1:27:04] supreme confidence that he is your head
[1:27:07] hey when I died when I when I totally
[1:27:10] died out to myself was born again by his
[1:27:13] spirit I was actually giving all of my
[1:27:15] rights and my own ability and putting
[1:27:18] all the responsibility of me upon him I
[1:27:21] am now his responsibility you are not
[1:27:24] your own you're bought with a price the
[1:27:25] scripture says
[1:27:26] right so if he is it if I am his
[1:27:29] responsibility he is obligated to look
[1:27:31] after me so I am now his problem I'll
[1:27:35] put it that way
[1:27:36] I am his problem I was my own problem it
[1:27:38] didn't go very well but then when I
[1:27:40] became his problem he's obligated to his
[1:27:42] word he's going to look after me but
[1:27:44] then I have to have confidence that he
[1:27:46] will look after me right and God allows
[1:27:49] many situations in our life to come
[1:27:52] because he wants to see do you really
[1:27:55] trust me do you really love me
[1:27:59] each other he challenges your faith he
[1:28:02] wants actually see do you really love me
[1:28:05] amen and if you love him you trust him a
[1:28:08] lot more than just trust right amen no
[1:28:14] and patience experience and experience
[1:28:18] hope and hope maketh not ashamed because
[1:28:21] the love of God is she'd abroad in our
[1:28:24] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[1:28:26] unto us amen
[1:28:30] now but in the and the Greek this is
[1:28:33] from the Strong's Concordance patience
[1:28:35] is a cheerful or hopeful endurance
[1:28:40] cheerful or hopeful a cheerful and your
[1:28:43] endurance
[1:28:45] Amen this is patience right and in hope
[1:28:49] hope is not like English hope well what
[1:28:52] we would define as hope as hope and
[1:28:54] English is like a stab in the dark like
[1:28:56] someone who goes and buys a lot of
[1:28:58] ticket and I prayed is known here and I
[1:29:00] said well I hope I win the lotto they
[1:29:01] don't know they just like a stab in the
[1:29:03] dark let's see if it works
[1:29:04] but Bible hope is not that way Bible
[1:29:07] hope is witches of the primary way to
[1:29:09] anticipate usually with pleasure she
[1:29:11] under I say I'll use my this is the beam
[1:29:15] dictionary this kind of Hope is like an
[1:29:18] expectation was his expectation it's
[1:29:19] going to happen right so it's not a hope
[1:29:22] it works your under expectation at will
[1:29:24] that's real Bible hope right so it's not
[1:29:27] will our hope as promises are true your
[1:29:29] under expectation cuz you know they're
[1:29:31] true amen and the hope maketh not
[1:29:34] ashamed right and hope maketh not
[1:29:37] ashamed because the love of God is she'd
[1:29:39] abroad in our hearts
[1:29:40] the Holy Ghost which is given it up yo
[1:29:43] unto us so we have an evidence right
[1:29:46] that the expectation will be met
[1:29:48] hallelujah I trust you have that
[1:29:51] expectation my trust is not here it's in
[1:29:54] here because of it's in here it's gonna
[1:29:56] stay true but this thing all a lot of
[1:29:59] things go on up there
[1:30:01] we don't worry about that one
[1:30:04] be not I mean if it's in here it's
[1:30:05] anchored it's anchored because God has
[1:30:07] anchored you're his word into your heart
[1:30:10] Amen now and out of the heart the mouth
[1:30:13] speaketh now we could go to the woman at
[1:30:19] the well the woman at the well her faith
[1:30:23] was we know when Messiah cometh he'll do
[1:30:25] these things so she had she wasn't
[1:30:28] looking she was looking at scriptural
[1:30:30] vindication deceitful as him or not
[1:30:33] because she he just said to her go get
[1:30:36] your husband she says I have none you
[1:30:38] know you're right that's right Jesus
[1:30:40] said you've had five the one you're with
[1:30:41] is not yours and so he was discerning
[1:30:44] what was going on in her life and it
[1:30:46] wasn't someone here as a backache or or
[1:30:48] a knee pain or you know someone as a
[1:30:51] financial need that statistically you
[1:30:55] could get that in any crowd and then
[1:30:57] people take that as God discerning no
[1:30:59] that's not God deserting that's just a
[1:31:01] guess right some what I could well
[1:31:05] someone here will have a financial need
[1:31:11] Amen oh that was God no that's just a
[1:31:14] guess because in a big enough crowd
[1:31:17] someone has Polly knee pain someone is
[1:31:20] not well and body.feel someone you know
[1:31:22] you will yeah we're human we have these
[1:31:26] things but if God comes and says this is
[1:31:29] your name you there in that dress you're
[1:31:32] this and this is your your name and this
[1:31:35] is your address and it will help you
[1:31:36] this and this and this you go find it
[1:31:39] and you've come here for this and the
[1:31:40] person next year
[1:31:41] you see God come down and brother brands
[1:31:43] mercies is this one and then one Nick
[1:31:44] she's got this one Nick she's got this
[1:31:46] one if she's got this and in those kind
[1:31:48] of meetings the people on the other end
[1:31:50] of the row actually got out because they
[1:31:51] don't want an one themselves to be
[1:31:53] discerned
[1:31:54] and that happened thousands and
[1:31:56] thousands of times we know where Messiah
[1:31:58] cometh he'll do these things Peter
[1:32:00] speaks to them he that changed her life
[1:32:03] hallelujah because that light struck
[1:32:05] that see to know that came to life and
[1:32:07] she realized I'm not a Samaritan who's
[1:32:10] who's an outcast of my village that's
[1:32:12] not my identity my dinner is I'm a child
[1:32:14] of God I trust you've heard the voice
[1:32:17] behind the voice amen because if you
[1:32:21] heard their voice behind the voice God
[1:32:22] is wanting to get you to realize you're
[1:32:24] a son of mine your daughter of mine I
[1:32:26] purchase your salvation I mean when when
[1:32:29] when Mary are the thoughts in Matthew
[1:32:31] chapter 1 when Jesus's name is spoken by
[1:32:33] the angel says you shall call his name
[1:32:35] Jesus for he shall save his people from
[1:32:39] their sins hallelujah so if you've been
[1:32:42] delivered have you been delivered from
[1:32:44] your son nature I mean the name of Jesus
[1:32:46] been manifested in your life that's why
[1:32:51] I love that name hallelujah amen
[1:32:56] right now Abraham we are the children of
[1:33:01] Abraham by faith if you're a natural son
[1:33:05] of Abraham good for you well daughter
[1:33:07] that's nice but I like being a Gentile
[1:33:09] they have their promise but I'm gonna be
[1:33:11] honor I'm gonna be at a wedding supper
[1:33:13] when they receive the same God I know
[1:33:15] right they're all on the economy of God
[1:33:18] but I'm glad I'm I'm glad I fall in this
[1:33:20] lot you know I'm glad I'm like Rahab I'm
[1:33:22] glad I'm like the woman at the well I'm
[1:33:24] glad I'm like the leper right I'm glad
[1:33:26] I'm like those kind of people I'm glad
[1:33:28] I'm like Peter I'm glad I'm like even
[1:33:30] Paul religious up to us beyond his
[1:33:33] eyebrows thank God came and spoke to him
[1:33:35] a man and transformed his life I'm glad
[1:33:38] I'm like most kind of people hallelujah
[1:33:42] there's nothing wrong with rejoicing as
[1:33:44] they it's not gonna hurt anyone
[1:33:47] I never seen someone get hurt with
[1:33:49] people are rejoicing they won't hurt you
[1:33:51] too much okay no I don't think it will
[1:33:53] at all no Romans 4 and being not weak in
[1:33:57] faith he considered not his own body now
[1:34:00] dead and when he was about a hundred
[1:34:03] years old neither yet the deadness of
[1:34:06] Sarah's womb
[1:34:07] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:34:08] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:34:11] giving glory to God and being fully
[1:34:14] persuaded that he that had promised was
[1:34:16] able also to perform you have to have
[1:34:20] you judged him have you actually become
[1:34:24] fully persuaded that he is able this is
[1:34:27] what God you know the big challenges do
[1:34:29] you believe his word completely I mean
[1:34:33] Abraham he only had one promise really
[1:34:35] you're gonna have a promise son he's
[1:34:37] fully persuaded but then when you go
[1:34:39] wait they just keep reading this but you
[1:34:41] go read about Abraham's life and it may
[1:34:46] appear to be a different story but this
[1:34:47] is now a God riding through the Apostle
[1:34:49] Paul after the cross
[1:34:50] anyway Romans 4 22 and therefore it was
[1:34:53] imputed to him for righteousness now it
[1:34:55] was not written for his sake alone that
[1:34:57] it was imputed to him but also for but
[1:35:00] for us also to whom it shall be imputed
[1:35:04] if we believe on him that raised up
[1:35:05] Jesus our Lord from the dead who was
[1:35:08] delivered for our offense and was raised
[1:35:10] up again for our justification abraham
[1:35:15] staggered a few times it appears he back
[1:35:18] slid went you know left the land a
[1:35:19] couple of times told both kings in those
[1:35:22] lands that Sarah was his sister and he
[1:35:24] she was the half-sister but you know
[1:35:26] we're not married
[1:35:27] you're beautiful they'll kill me to take
[1:35:29] you say we just brother and sister he
[1:35:31] did all these kind of things any and and
[1:35:34] it's even in the scripture where he
[1:35:35] where God comes John says you're gonna
[1:35:37] be the father of Nations and he laughs
[1:35:39] at the feet of God right you read about
[1:35:43] in the scripture but yet all that human
[1:35:47] fail you know no failure when when so
[1:35:51] Moses was writing that account under the
[1:35:53] blood of bulls and goats
[1:35:54] so all those failures were still
[1:35:55] recorded but then now when Paul was
[1:35:57] writing about Abraham's life after the
[1:36:01] cross god only sees the good right and
[1:36:05] he was fully persuaded his his final
[1:36:09] obituary is that he was strong he
[1:36:12] staggered not at the promise of God but
[1:36:15] was strong I mean
[1:36:19] he's taken all the problems of God
[1:36:21] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[1:36:22] glory to God and being fully persuaded
[1:36:24] that that what he had promised he was
[1:36:27] also able to perform amen
[1:36:33] he says put it back and therefore see
[1:36:37] and he considered not his own body now
[1:36:39] did he didn't even bring into account
[1:36:43] his physical being
[1:36:45] Amen this is this is faith again at the
[1:36:49] end time but brother Graham says this
[1:36:52] here's interesting he says and Jehovah
[1:36:54] Jireh 64 and we'll close with this he
[1:36:56] says but in this covenant I have already
[1:36:59] made you a father of many nations I
[1:37:02] he and he's already it's all
[1:37:03] unconditional the Covenant is purely
[1:37:06] Grace just absolutely grace only thing
[1:37:09] they had to do to maintain this covenant
[1:37:11] will stay and abide in the land and
[1:37:13] every blessing went with the Covenant
[1:37:16] was with them the only thing they had to
[1:37:18] do was stay in that land now we find out
[1:37:20] when they went down to Egypt they lost
[1:37:22] their blessing but not their covenant
[1:37:24] the Covenant was still the Covenant was
[1:37:27] still there they lost the blessing but
[1:37:29] not their covenant because the Covenant
[1:37:31] was Grace unconditionally that's the
[1:37:34] same thing our land is the Word of God
[1:37:37] right you may people may leave the land
[1:37:40] but the Covenant is still there they
[1:37:43] just let they just lose the blessing we
[1:37:45] don't want to lose the blessing right we
[1:37:48] want to stay in our in our land amen
[1:37:51] okay can we we have we have the
[1:37:54] musicians please just leave it there you
[1:38:00] know just as they come the
[1:38:03] syrophoenician woman at the beginning
[1:38:05] will cease from Canaan but in another
[1:38:06] part of scripture she's called a sorry
[1:38:08] Phoenician woman she was she was did
[1:38:13] earnest she'll get what she needs she
[1:38:15] didn't take it haphazardly right and we
[1:38:19] need to be the same kind of way we
[1:38:22] should be I believe we need to be more
[1:38:25] sincere and our approach to God and how
[1:38:29] we come to church and how we you know
[1:38:31] this is a house of prayer
[1:38:33] right we should spend time I believe
[1:38:37] seeking his face because you know I
[1:38:42] don't I don't believe we should just
[1:38:44] take it haphazardly walking with them so
[1:38:48] I'm trying to say our approach should be
[1:38:49] with sincerity and we should be did
[1:38:51] Ernest write and say Lord Here I am you
[1:38:57] know I don't I don't take it for granted
[1:38:59] that you've called me to be your bride
[1:39:01] that I'm the Bride of Christ I don't
[1:39:03] take that for granted I want to keep you
[1:39:06] amen I want to approach you reverently
[1:39:08] and with love and respect
[1:39:10] not just to Here I am did it and leaf

[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:05] god bless your friendship a I can't keep
[1:51:15] quiet about this I need to share this
[1:51:17] Sam
[1:51:18] if these tears it's joy and emotions and
[1:51:23] everything together so it started where
[1:51:31] I needed to go back to South Africa and
[1:51:35] knowing that to get a ticket is
[1:51:38] expensive and I need to get there
[1:51:42] and for such a long time I didn't know
[1:51:46] should I go should I stay and the Lord
[1:51:50] showed me he showed me that I needed to
[1:51:53] go and I started the process and in that
[1:51:59] time my mum was still alive so I prayed
[1:52:06] I said lord I know you showing me I need
[1:52:09] to go it's a lot of money and I went to
[1:52:16] find out how much the tickets cost and
[1:52:19] everything and I'm well on my way there
[1:52:23] I prayed I said lord please my baby is
[1:52:29] special and my you provide in every need
[1:52:35] and I got the and the was is special and
[1:52:42] I got the price and I drove back and I
[1:52:46] said Lord you know that I can't exactly
[1:52:52] have booked the tickets now I don't have
[1:52:56] the money yet but and you know the
[1:53:00] tickets
[1:53:00] the price may vary so I'm asking for
[1:53:05] $2,000 then I know that whatever will
[1:53:11] happen I would have enough that was the
[1:53:14] Friday morning
[1:53:16] that Friday night I received a text
[1:53:19] saying if you want to come I can help
[1:53:25] from South Africa that was the first
[1:53:30] prayer answered the next week when I
[1:53:37] looked into the account it was exactly
[1:53:39] two thousand dollars on the dot I had
[1:53:45] the ticket was one thousand four ninety
[1:53:49] nine and then Daniel stick it with I
[1:53:52] even had enough to pay for his visa and
[1:53:56] everything
[1:53:57] even with my emergency certificate that
[1:54:01] I need to apply for that came through in
[1:54:03] one day
[1:54:04] Daniel's visa came through not as fast
[1:54:09] as I would have had but in the Lord's
[1:54:11] time going there everything went to plan
[1:54:18] everything wins according to the Lord
[1:54:22] plane and we celebrated mums life so
[1:54:30] many people came afterwards and said
[1:54:32] that was one of the nicest funeral
[1:54:37] because it wasn't a funeral it was an
[1:54:39] absolute celebration and I praise the
[1:54:42] Lord for that so the next morning that
[1:54:45] was the Monday after I arrived did you
[1:54:48] Tuesday morning
[1:54:49] so I during that weekend I said okay
[1:54:54] well I should get my passport sorted as
[1:54:56] soon as possible I don't apply for it
[1:54:59] and I'm so there you can always start
[1:55:01] the process you start the process online
[1:55:03] and then to make the process or quicker
[1:55:08] than to go and stand any queue you do it
[1:55:11] through the bank but they could have
[1:55:13] like the only the first appointment I
[1:55:15] got was a week in so I said okay that's
[1:55:19] pushing a bit for time so me and my
[1:55:23] brother decided we'll go and stand in
[1:55:28] the queue
[1:55:29] so we decided which way in which her
[1:55:33] face would be the best one and the
[1:55:35] quickest one so all that's coming from
[1:55:40] South Africa the quickest one believe it
[1:55:42] or not was right bang in the middle of
[1:55:44] Pretoria in the city that's not the best
[1:55:47] place to be at all
[1:55:49] so my brother said okay he'll go with me
[1:55:53] and driving there he said okay you
[1:55:56] should know we can understand in a queue
[1:55:58] for about eight hours see no we not
[1:56:01] we've prayed about this it's sorted you
[1:56:03] see no not a now but I said no no no you
[1:56:07] see he said I could well I took the day
[1:56:10] off to spend time with you as it's
[1:56:11] always been told me the queue that's
[1:56:12] right
[1:56:13] and um so we got the wish there stood in
[1:56:17] the first queue and he said okay now you
[1:56:19] just go and find out so that was outside
[1:56:21] not even inside the building you gon
[1:56:24] find out and I said okay no no we're in
[1:56:28] the wrong key the other one is inside
[1:56:30] okay so you go inside you stand in a
[1:56:33] queue you get a number and then when I
[1:56:36] call your number you go have your photo
[1:56:38] taken your finger prints and all of that
[1:56:41] and um so that was the first queue was
[1:56:45] half an hour the next one we said they
[1:56:49] probably around half an hour maybe a
[1:56:52] little bit more and got my finger way we
[1:56:57] know went to the fingerprints and
[1:56:59] everything she said but did you tell him
[1:57:03] at the front that keep applied online
[1:57:04] and he did everything online
[1:57:06] I said yes I did I could just wait and
[1:57:08] she went out and came back took the
[1:57:11] photo and when I got the new ticket for
[1:57:14] the next step priority was on the ticket
[1:57:18] and I basically just sat down and I
[1:57:21] called my number so in all in all it was
[1:57:24] probably an hour and a half and I looked
[1:57:28] at all the through the whole experience
[1:57:29] and I just looked at my brother and I
[1:57:32] every now no then I would say you see
[1:57:35] it's going quicker than you thought
[1:57:36] it's good we've prayed about this and
[1:57:38] when we got out and looked at him
[1:57:41] said you see this has been prayed
[1:57:44] through its sorted you'll see we hour
[1:57:48] and a half in we're good to go
[1:57:50] we've got time it's still breakfast we
[1:57:53] can go and have a breakfast so then the
[1:57:58] week went on and I was really because I
[1:58:03] still had to apply for my visa to get
[1:58:05] transferred and they said that would
[1:58:07] take at least in working dice to get
[1:58:09] that sorted as well so I knew I'm
[1:58:11] pressed for time and it's not just by
[1:58:16] not just the fact that you push your
[1:58:18] ticket Daniels visas also just so the
[1:58:22] seventh or that
[1:58:23] yeah the seventh of June so I had to
[1:58:26] move that as well if I move when I move
[1:58:29] my ticket and so I really prayed that in
[1:58:34] the second week because my dad's
[1:58:36] passport took about just over a week run
[1:58:40] about a week so I thought okay now then
[1:58:42] we're okay we'd be good mine one didn't
[1:58:46] it took longer so I only most of you
[1:58:49] know only received my passport on
[1:58:52] Tuesday so through everything the Lord
[1:58:56] has showed so much of himself and just
[1:59:01] with every day got passing and for even
[1:59:07] for my dad he'll come back and he said
[1:59:09] all the script he just read was all
[1:59:11] about faith and we should believe and I
[1:59:13] said well over got the same one was done
[1:59:17] pious soul be a David and the Lord's
[1:59:20] timing don't do it on your own this is
[1:59:25] hard this is not an easy trip it's hard
[1:59:28] and I'm sad to stay moaning I think it
[1:59:33] was around eleven how God that takes
[1:59:36] passport is ready now I need to go back
[1:59:39] and I need to go back and there long
[1:59:41] queue that was they was there pick up
[1:59:44] queue their collections one so I need to
[1:59:46] go back to go in standing that cute so
[1:59:50] we got there and that queue was outside
[1:59:52] the building going around
[1:59:55] so we went in and we talked to the the
[1:59:59] guy in front we explained the situation
[2:00:01] he said well I'm sorry I can't help you
[2:00:05] you need to go stand in the queue so at
[2:00:08] first I thought oh man we've explained
[2:00:11] everything could you just help and while
[2:00:15] we stood there my dad was with me while
[2:00:17] we stood there so that was 12:30 we got
[2:00:21] there and just a backtrack I found
[2:00:25] because I had to make an appointment for
[2:00:27] the visa and I couldn't get one so I
[2:00:29] found him and I explained the situation
[2:00:31] so they said okay just be there around
[2:00:34] 2:00 now I know okay 12:30 hi
[2:00:39] 2 o'clock it's the other side of
[2:00:41] Pretoria so we still need to get the
[2:00:43] we're pushing it's so me and my dad was
[2:00:49] standing there and he was praying and I
[2:00:53] was praying silently and we just talked
[2:00:56] and I watched the man standing at the
[2:00:58] door and everybody went that came they
[2:01:02] everybody tried their best to get it
[2:01:04] sneaked in and I just had compassion
[2:01:07] remember I started talking and said well
[2:01:10] that poor guys only doing his job if he
[2:01:13] leads everybody in with a different
[2:01:15] story
[2:01:16] I mean it's just the process and I'm
[2:01:20] Blighty he said no no but don't worry
[2:01:24] the key is actually going up it's not
[2:01:26] that long you'll see it at least at an
[2:01:28] hour and so finally we got in I think
[2:01:34] that was about quarter to two now half
[2:01:37] half past 1:00 we finally in the
[2:01:40] building now I need to stand in the next
[2:01:42] queue to get my number
[2:01:43] you can I get my number you go stand in
[2:01:46] the next cue to go clicked your passport
[2:01:48] I said half past 2:00 you we actually
[2:01:52] should leave now to be the boy 2 o'clock
[2:01:55] for the visa and so when I got the the
[2:02:01] guy that wrote my number they gave me my
[2:02:04] number I looked at him I said sir is
[2:02:06] there any way
[2:02:07] that you can help me I've got a two
[2:02:10] o'clock appointment for my visa it's the
[2:02:12] other side is there any way you can help
[2:02:15] me he gave me my number
[2:02:17] he said just give me a minute go and
[2:02:21] stay and he said okay I looked at my
[2:02:23] number number 680 yeah all right here we
[2:02:27] go
[2:02:28] I have no idea where they are in the
[2:02:30] line and in the queue but okay
[2:02:33] and I stood aside and he looked at me it
[2:02:37] was not even two minutes he looked at me
[2:02:39] he said what's your number
[2:02:40] I see 680 said okay come and he got up
[2:02:46] he got my passport he said okay just
