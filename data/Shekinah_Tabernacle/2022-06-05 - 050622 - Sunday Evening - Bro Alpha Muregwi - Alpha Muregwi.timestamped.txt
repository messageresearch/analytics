[8:20] each day
[8:23] so they quickly decided that they
[8:24] wouldn't be winding down we had to go
[8:26] strong right until the end
[8:28] and when we're laborious and the kingdom
[8:30] of god that's what we do we go strong to
[8:32] the end we're not winding down man
[8:34] we're going for it um
[8:36] brother malcolm were you here this
[8:38] morning like when we shook hands and all
[8:40] that
[8:41] i knew it i looked
[8:43] belinda
[8:47] okay
[8:48] i was told you were i was looking i was

[8:52] looking face and i couldn't see it
[8:54] [Laughter]
[8:56] come up here bro could you please come
[8:58] and open in prayer and just bring a
[9:00] greeting
[9:11] [Music]
[9:21] gracious father
[9:23] we have been so blessed oh god
[9:27] the way that you've come and
[9:30] we've been able to create an atmosphere
[9:32] of worship because
[9:34] you delight in the worship of your
[9:37] people
[9:38] but you're also searching oh god for a
[9:41] people that would worship you in spirit
[9:43] and in truth
[9:46] because lord you were tired down through
[9:48] all those years
[9:50] because of man-made systems
[9:54] but lord i believe over this weekend
[9:56] you've found some fountains of living
[9:58] water
[10:00] ones that lord have experienced life's
[10:03] challenges
[10:06] and have overcome
[10:09] because you said lord it would be those
[10:11] overcomers that would sit with you in
[10:13] your throne
[10:16] and lord even to the extent of judging
[10:19] angels
[10:21] so what a commission you've given us
[10:24] and what a blessing of god because
[10:26] as you allow the different expressions
[10:29] of the five-fold ministry
[10:31] to lord speak and
[10:34] we've heard our our names revealed in
[10:37] the book
[10:39] sometimes lord you've got to go
[10:41] deep
[10:42] down
[10:43] pastor god all of the outward feelings
[10:47] and emotions and get right down on the
[10:49] inside of the inside and
[10:51] various ministries you've used oh god to
[10:54] fulfill these things
[10:57] so we're thankful for you lord you you
[10:59] are a complete
[11:01] package oh god
[11:04] and we just pray lord that in this last
[11:07] service you would
[11:08] just by the sweetness of your holy
[11:10] spirit once once again come
[11:12] lord we like our brother was saying we
[11:15] we don't don't we
[11:16] just want to phase out
[11:19] the the meeting we want to be able to
[11:21] wind up even further
[11:24] because lord we want to take that
[11:26] anointing we want to take that aloha
[11:30] we want to take that divine love with us
[11:33] when we journey back up north we want to
[11:35] take oh god that fire of a revival with
[11:39] us
[11:40] so lord we ain't winding down we're
[11:42] winding up
[11:44] we're building up oh god until it builds
[11:47] such a rapturing faith amongst us
[11:50] that lord we could be on our way home
[11:52] and head home to glory
[11:55] thank you jesus
[11:56] but we're already booked in oh god we we
[11:59] got our token in our hand
[12:01] lord we we got our seats all already
[12:04] prepared
[12:06] and father
[12:08] as your word is declared in a moment in
[12:10] a twinkling of an eye
[12:12] there'll be a change
[12:13] so we look forward to even lord what you
[12:16] would bring to us
[12:18] uh this this afternoon this evening
[12:22] and we just want to say amen amen amen
[12:26] thank you lord for all of these things
[12:28] we commit the service into your hands
[12:30] i'm asking these things in the blessed
[12:33] name of our lord and savior jesus christ
[12:36] amen thank you jesus so we just want to
[12:39] greet you all in the precious name of
[12:41] our lord jesus christ
[12:44] um from the shekinah glory tabernacle up
[12:47] north
[12:49] because i i can say because
[12:51] brother freddie said we had been going
[12:53] for about 40 years it's just about 35
[12:55] years and ben pinched the name from us
[13:02] but you know there's
[13:04] there's some great things that come out
[13:05] of the shekinah glory
[13:08] brother ben and i've got some
[13:09] testimonies to
[13:11] to be able to take home
[13:13] because out from the shekinah glory
[13:15] comes the glory of the lord
[13:18] and the glory of the lord is on display
[13:21] in the hearts of his people
[13:23] so i've seen that on display um
[13:26] while we've been here
[13:27] and uh
[13:29] you know
[13:30] i was saying the trees we we hadn't had
[13:33] an anniversary and we've been we're just
[13:35] about 35 years now
[13:38] and i was thinking man i'm gonna have to
[13:41] coach the church on how to say nice
[13:43] things about me
[13:45] i might just play the video
[13:48] brother ben i might play the video
[13:50] before i make the announcement
[13:52] coaching them on how to say nice things
[13:54] about their pasta
[13:56] but you know what i was so blessed when
[13:58] i when i heard our bro here
[14:01] mentioning about
[14:03] those nuggets
[14:05] on how to
[14:06] build up a church
[14:09] how to have such a respect for the
[14:11] ministry
[14:13] and i think these fellows are like
[14:16] they're like
[14:18] jonathan's armor bearer
[14:22] you know they stand by the side of the
[14:24] pasta
[14:26] and everyone is in their place
[14:29] everyone's there to fulfill a part of
[14:31] the vision
[14:33] and they're moving in that way it's like
[14:37] you know when jonathan went up to
[14:40] to go against a garrison
[14:43] him and his armor bearing the armor bear
[14:45] is
[14:45] he's not saying bro you sure we
[14:48] we can take this
[14:50] [Music]
[14:51] now all the armor bearers said was
[14:54] all that is in your heart
[14:58] will do it
[14:59] when jonathan felt that he could go up
[15:02] against that garrison
[15:04] the armor bearer doesn't doesn't
[15:06] hesitate
[15:08] that's what blessed me watching the
[15:10] things unfold today over this weekend is
[15:12] seeing
[15:14] these brothers that got up and
[15:16] and what we call they give their
[15:19] their toe toho
[15:21] behind the ministry
[15:23] you know they give their their vision
[15:27] of what has been happening over the last
[15:29] 10 years
[15:31] and what has made this anniversary the
[15:34] an anniversary to remember
[15:37] that's an anniversary like an
[15:39] anniversary of the passover
[15:42] when the death angel was writing and the
[15:44] applying of the token that was an
[15:46] anniversary for every year
[15:49] and here you have
[15:51] an anniversary of the success of a
[15:53] church
[15:54] you know a birthing of the church as i
[15:56] was hearing some of the the different
[15:58] trials and tests that you all would have
[16:00] been going through
[16:02] you know to get it that far and i
[16:04] understand that you know the birthing of
[16:06] of the fellowship the raising of these
[16:09] things the challenges that you face
[16:11] the ups and downs the the prayer
[16:14] meetings
[16:15] you know the prayer meetings over
[16:16] wellington
[16:18] the prayer meetings that would drive
[16:20] back
[16:27] those things to drive away old idols and
[16:31] you know drugs and pee and all of these
[16:34] kind of addictions
[16:36] and that's exactly how
[16:38] we were birthing the church in times
[16:39] like that
[16:40] we would have all night prayer meetings
[16:44] we would have prayer meetings
[16:46] for
[16:47] seven weeks
[16:48] day after day
[16:50] to bring that kind of revival because
[16:52] every revival starts from prayer trace
[16:56] any revival in the scripture and you'll
[16:58] find every revival came from prayer
[17:01] and that prayer takes dedication that
[17:03] takes those ones that were gathering
[17:06] around david that takes mighty gentiles
[17:09] to catch the vision
[17:11] and then each one walking in the vision
[17:14] in the way that god had expressed it
[17:17] when i see all the troubled water that
[17:19] we've been uh been through in the last
[17:21] three years
[17:22] and that's kept the bride apart
[17:25] for three years and you know that just
[17:27] allowed i was saying to brother freddie
[17:28] that's just allowed some of that hermit
[17:30] mentality to come on us
[17:33] you know and that hermit mentality is
[17:36] quite comfortable for some of us
[17:38] and it's a place where when we gather
[17:41] together we have such an appreciation
[17:43] of the goodness and the grace of god
[17:45] because we're back amongst believers
[17:48] we're back in the safety zone of the
[17:51] city of refuge christ
[17:53] we're backing amongst those that love
[17:55] him
[17:56] we're backing amongst those that have
[17:58] stood for the word and then we see the
[18:01] results of these things and it's just
[18:03] such a blessing to me
[18:05] you know to see these things and we want
[18:07] more of that
[18:08] we want more of that that's why i was
[18:10] saying in my prayer how that we want to
[18:12] take the revival we want to take the
[18:14] fire i believe we got some fires burning
[18:16] pretty bright up up from where we are
[18:18] too
[18:20] i've been really enjoying the worship
[18:22] i'm going to steal some of brother
[18:24] isaac's songs and maori eyes them as we
[18:26] call it
[18:29] but i've been really enjoying that and
[18:31] it's been such a pleasure to see
[18:33] you all in action it really is i've been
[18:36] been so blessed with that
[18:38] the worship
[18:40] you know we really have enjoyed that as
[18:41] well and if i could just impart
[18:44] a little thought for you a little nugget
[18:47] i i would say this from job chapter 38 i
[18:50] think it's around about verse 31.
[18:53] kenneth now
[18:54] bind the sweet influences of pleiades
[18:59] [Music]
[19:01] amen
[19:03] because what was those sweet influences
[19:05] of pleiades
[19:07] many times we were under the sweet
[19:09] influences of pleiades and we thought it
[19:11] was us
[19:12] because the sweet influences of pleiades
[19:15] was the seven stars that he had in his
[19:18] hand
[19:20] and we've been under the sweet
[19:22] influences of the seven star
[19:25] the prophet's message
[19:26] and without us even being aware of it
[19:29] he's watched over us he's blessed us
[19:31] he's kept us
[19:33] and then that sweet influence of the
[19:35] semester pleades
[19:38] actually led us to orion
[19:40] [Music]
[19:43] and there was only one time that was
[19:45] mentioned in the message about orion you
[19:48] realize that
[19:49] and that was when sister hope was on a
[19:51] deathbed
[19:53] and sister hope on a deathbed said i
[19:57] feel the great wings
[20:01] of orion
[20:03] coming to take me home
[20:07] that great rings of of orion is christ
[20:11] himself
[20:13] so the sweet influences of pleiades can
[20:16] you bind it
[20:18] can mandates blind the sweet influences
[20:22] of pleiades
[20:23] mandates can't do it
[20:25] can viruses
[20:28] bind the sweet influence of of pleiades
[20:32] can government policies bind the sweet
[20:34] influences of pleiades i say no
[20:37] absolutely not
[20:39] we are still under the benefits
[20:42] of those sweet influences
[20:45] lori
[20:46] but the sweet influences of pleiades led
[20:49] us to orion
[20:53] amen but what he is doing is he is
[20:56] loosing the bands of orion
[20:59] he's breaking the seals off of these
[21:01] books
[21:02] that's what i've been seeing in these
[21:03] meetings
[21:04] how that the lord has been breaking the
[21:06] seals of the books
[21:09] breaking away the inferiority complexes
[21:11] the superiority complexes
[21:14] breaking us away from any rough habits
[21:18] because sometimes you've got to go down
[21:20] into the refinery sometimes we've got to
[21:22] be down in the threshing floor
[21:24] to get rid of all of our chap to get rid
[21:26] of all of our humanity
[21:29] to get rid of anything that would hinder
[21:32] the breaking forth of the word from our
[21:34] soul
[21:36] so i'm thankful for those things
[21:38] brethren that's what i've felt in my own
[21:40] heart that he has been loosing
[21:43] the bands
[21:46] of orion
[21:47] so that the very resource the gene seed
[21:50] that god placed death in your soul
[21:53] can be liberated for a final ride
[21:57] isn't it the final ride we're just
[21:59] before the rapture
[22:01] we're not talking about being in seed
[22:03] time brethren we are in harvest time
[22:05] this is the harvest time it's almost
[22:08] home time and in harvest time the fruit
[22:10] has to be on the vine
[22:12] so once those seals have been broken up
[22:14] your heart we've been loose the bands of
[22:17] orion
[22:18] then watch the bride and watch the fruit
[22:20] because that's what i've been watching
[22:22] in these meetings
[22:23] i've been watching that fruit i've been
[22:25] watching the musicians
[22:27] play i've been watching the singers sing
[22:30] amen create creating an atmosphere for
[22:33] the word
[22:34] and i was so blessed brother

[43:42] praise the lord
[43:45] brother alpha you're going to get
[43:46] through about one line of your notes up
[43:48] here bro it's fire
[43:51] anything you touch is going to catch
[43:53] fire
[43:55] you felt it too brother malcolm didn't
[43:57] you
[43:58] it goes man you start then it's off
[44:01] but that's the anointing of god and
[44:02] that's what he promised when we gather
[44:04] together he'll be there so
[44:06] and and that's the atmosphere we need
[44:08] for the word of god to go forth
[44:10] amen
[44:11] um we've got something a little for you
[44:13] now just before brother alpha comes
[44:15] we've got um just two worship songs
[44:18] um
[44:19] one of them
[44:21] is it's actually a new song which
[44:23] the only people that have heard it are
[44:25] the band and maybe a few
[44:27] people that are friends with the band
[44:36] you've all heard it then
[44:39] um
[44:41] i just want to explain a little bit
[44:43] about the song
[44:45] [Music]
[44:46] and it's funny because brother freddie
[44:48] and different ones have said things this
[44:50] morning and over the last few days that
[44:52] i was going to touch on when saying this
[44:54] but
[44:56] i'll start with this there's two things
[44:58] that i've done right in my life only two
[45:00] really and the first one is i've said
[45:02] yes to the call of the lord it's the
[45:04] first thing i've done right it's the
[45:06] most best decision you could ever make
[45:08] and the second thing that i've done
[45:09] right is that i have offered myself to
[45:11] the lord said lord here i am then this
[45:13] is me
[45:14] this is all i've got
[45:16] and
[45:18] believe it or not i haven't got much to
[45:20] offer the lord
[45:22] i haven't been natural at many things at
[45:24] all in my entire life i'm
[45:26] like the only thing i was natural at was
[45:28] accounting
[45:29] and that's not a very you know
[45:31] accounting it naturally came to me but
[45:32] nothing else did music it didn't come
[45:34] naturally i picked up went on the drums
[45:36] the first time i couldn't hardly play a
[45:37] beat it was so frustrating my brothers
[45:39] would get on there and just first time
[45:41] they're away boom they'll pick up the
[45:42] guitar and start playing i picked up the
[45:44] guitar i couldn't play nothing nothing
[45:46] worked it was everything was a struggle
[45:48] every
[45:50] that's like like the man that came to
[45:52] jesus
[45:53] the boy you know
[45:54] he just came with his lunch this is all
[45:56] i've got now it was a poor solution
[46:01] to a great need to a great problem
[46:04] five loaves like fish in a few loaves
[46:07] to 5 000 people but he brought it anyway
[46:09] and said this is all i've got this is
[46:10] what i'm going to offer
[46:12] you and i'm not saying there's just a
[46:15] bit of false humility the lord knows i'm
[46:17] not very good at stuff i i just like i
[46:19] finished school at 12 essentially i
[46:21] don't have an education i was thinking
[46:22] when i was 18 i'm like lord i've got no
[46:24] brains in me i haven't learned stuff
[46:25] most other people have learned things i
[46:27] haven't learned anything stopped school
[46:29] at 12.
[46:30] i thought lord the only thing i've done
[46:31] my whole teenage years is thought about
[46:33] you thought about wisdom and folly
[46:35] that's actually all i thought about when
[46:36] i boiled it down man what have i got to
[46:38] show for my
[46:40] high school education nothing because i
[46:42] stopped schooling my parents kept me at
[46:43] home everywhere i was went to school i
[46:45] just stayed at home by myself
[46:47] did nothing
[46:48] didn't learn anything my
[46:50] great parents but maybe education wasn't
[46:52] a great hive on the list
[46:55] i'm saying that because
[46:59] if you've got just you just have to
[47:01] offer the little that you've got
[47:02] honestly just offer this offer what
[47:04] you've got
[47:06] and and
[47:07] just do it if you
[47:09] the lord can take whatever and make
[47:10] something of it
[47:12] and
[47:15] because
[47:17] i guess i can say this it frustrated me
[47:18] a few about a month ago because i said
[47:20] lord i can't even sing i'd like to just
[47:21] be able to sing and praise you sometimes
[47:23] lord i just worship
[47:24] and i thought lord i've never really
[47:26] written a song that i can
[47:28] just
[47:29] i can kind of play katana enough to
[47:31] string together an idea so i thought
[47:32] maybe lord if i could string something
[47:34] together and then if you give me a voice
[47:35] that i can sing something to your lord
[47:36] for all the good things you've done for
[47:38] me
[47:39] and then i closed my eyes one day at
[47:41] night and i just pictured myself
[47:44] before the throne of god
[47:46] and i can see the throne there and i can
[47:49] see
[47:50] i can see the lord on his throne and i
[47:52] can hear
[47:54] all the angels singing
[47:56] maybe they've got three octaves
[47:58] they can sing from here to here i have
[48:00] about a three-quarter octave to sing and
[48:01] they've got this massive range and
[48:02] they're singing this
[48:04] these beautiful songs
[48:06] praising god singing holy holy holy
[48:10] and here's me up there with not a lot to
[48:13] offer but
[48:15] i felt like
[48:17] there was something in my heart that
[48:18] said god
[48:22] could i be so bashful that maybe i could
[48:24] interrupt their singing and say look
[48:27] you guys are nice it sounds nice and all
[48:29] but there's no heart to it
[48:32] i may not have i might not sound very
[48:34] good i may not be able to put much
[48:35] together but i've got heart with mine
[48:36] because i know what it is to be lost and
[48:38] i i know what that one seated on the
[48:40] throne has done for me he
[48:43] he's my savior i don't know what he is
[48:45] to you but to me he's my savior
[48:47] to me he's given me so many good things
[48:49] in my life and
[48:50] if i could just have this opportunity
[48:53] and if i'd be so bold to say you angels
[48:55] cannot join in on this one you can maybe
[48:57] do backing vocals if you like but it's
[48:59] not your song
[49:01] i said lord
[49:02] lord if i'm in that atmosphere lord
[49:04] could you could you give me a song that
[49:05] i could sing lord i could say bring me a
[49:07] guitar
[49:09] let me just strum out a little song lord
[49:11] to to show lord that
[49:13] [Music]
[49:14] you're the almighty god
[49:17] you're the almighty god
[49:20] [Music]
[49:23] and what would you stand this morning
[49:24] and i want you to when we sing the song
