thank you my brother got to stay tuned [Music] so many times i've questioned certain circumstances or things i could not i mean understand [Music] many times in trials weakness bless my vision my frustration gets so out of hand [Music] it's then i am reminded i've never been forsaken [Music] i've never had to stand the test alone as i look at all the victories the spirit rises up in me through the fire my weakness is made strong [Music] oh he never promised that the cross would not get heavy on the hill would not be hard to climb [Music] he never offered victory without fighting but he's had help with always come in time just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says or giving but just hold on [Music] our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again [Music] so when the load gets heavy and darkness does surround me and the devil whispers you are on your own i turn my eyes to jesus [Music] pour my heart out to him and he whispers he whispers to me you are not alone it's then i am reminded [Music] i've never been forsaken never ever been forsaken jesus always turns up right on time as i look at all the past victories and the spirit rises up in me i know that all god's promises his promises have been lost to me well he never promised that the cross would not get heavy all the health would not be hard to climb he never offers victory without fighting he said help will always come in time so remember when you're standing in that valley of decision and the adversary says giving just hold on [Music] our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire once again
