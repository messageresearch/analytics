[25:02] up here
[25:12] amen I think
[25:18] so it's muted sorry
[25:32] okay um good morning everybody what a
[25:34] blessing it is to be here um in early
[25:37] February I was referred by my doctor to
[25:40] have some tests due to some irregular
[25:42] symptoms after two MRI scans I saw a
[25:46] neurosurgeon who said that although my
[25:48] brain was clear not surprise
[25:50] unfortunately there was a mess
[25:52] consistent with cancer in my throat at
[25:55] the base of my tongue which he said was
[25:57] very serious
[25:59] he ordered further tests and referred me
[26:01] to an ear- noos and throat
[26:03] specialist the following day was Bible
[26:05] study I was anointed with oil by Pastor
[26:08] Ben and brother kuin and we prayed for
[26:09] healing in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[26:13] especially during the appointments in
[26:14] the following days the fear and
[26:17] uncertainty fired plenty of unpleasant
[26:20] shots my way I had to keep focusing on
[26:23] him and his promises on Jesus Christ and
[26:27] his promises this brought rest in fully
[26:30] surrendering this whole situation to the
[26:34] Lord 3 days ago on Thursday I was with
[26:37] the earos and throat specialist and he
[26:40] was planning to further investigate the
[26:42] mass in the base of my throat after much
[26:45] poking and prodding he stopped with the
[26:48] scope down my throat and looked puzzled
[26:52] he asked me to confirm my name and then
[26:54] he asked for proof of my ID because in
[26:57] his opinion the throat in the three
[26:59] schemes was a different throat to the
[27:02] one that was sitting in the chair in
[27:03] front of
[27:04] himall his diagnosis was a perfectly
[27:08] healthy tongue and throat with no
[27:11] further followup required so I'm giving
[27:15] testimony of God's healing hand and give
[27:18] all praise and glory to him praise the
[27:20] Lord
[27:35] amen praise the Lord that's the god that
[27:37] we serve this morning you know when we
[27:40] when we fully trust in him and don't
[27:42] doubt Just Surrender it all to the Lord
[27:44] that's when that happens and I I I I I
[27:48] don't feel scared in saying that's when
[27:51] it happens every
[27:53] time because he can't fail so if we
[27:56] surrender and fully believe
[27:58] then that's always the
[28:01] outcome praise the Lord let's stand this

[41:14] speak to our hearts Lord just want to

[41:23] control we those who are streaming as
[41:25] well Lord we thank you for this opport
[41:27] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[41:30] bless you friends you can you can have
[41:32] your seats uh this morning so I want to
[41:35] I want to speak about I really want to
[41:36] continue on from last Sunday about but
[41:38] not so much about the eagle anointing
[41:40] but I want to talk about the uh about
[41:42] how the bride and the spirit say come
[41:45] there's are people who have come into
[41:47] the world that are saying the same thing
[41:49] as the spirit of God now this is very I
[41:52] think it can never be emphasized enough
[41:54] to to say what the word has already
[41:57] declared because you got to look at now
[42:00] there's so many voices in this age
[42:02] there's never been the ability I don't
[42:04] think upon the face of the Earth where I
[42:06] can be standing here I can just hold my
[42:08] phone or sitting in the car or wherever
[42:10] people have their deep and meaningful
[42:12] epiphanies and they and they share it to
[42:14] the world and literally everyone who's
[42:16] connected to the internet can listen to
[42:18] what they're saying and even if they
[42:20] can't maybe understand it in the live
[42:22] stream they can go and put captions on
[42:24] it can be translated into their into
[42:26] their language and it's about 97%
[42:28] accurate so there's so many voices that
[42:30] are that are in this world incredible
[42:32] number of voices and everyone has a soap
[42:34] box they can stand on and say what they
[42:36] think is the right thing to say but I'm
[42:38] so thankful we can we can say what a
[42:40] Vindicated word has already said you
[42:43] know we can we can stand here and we can
[42:45] declare this message Works amen that
[42:48] that it is not the mind of a man as
[42:50] brother Braham said and I pray these
[42:52] things aren't just catchphrases to us
[42:53] but he says you're not feeding on the
[42:55] mind of a man so you're not you're not
[42:56] spirit feeding on his thoughts but
[42:58] you're feeding on the body word of the
[43:00] son of man so you're you're feeding on
[43:01] more than just the ideas of a man from
[43:03] Kentucky but you're feeding on the voice
[43:05] of God Amen that his word would sustain
[43:07] and you and transform Our Lives now we
[43:11] need to say what the spirit says right
[43:14] this scripture is being lived out in
[43:16] this day the spirit and the bride say
[43:18] come so they're saying the same thing
[43:20] that you know it's been ever since the
[43:22] fall man uh God has been wrestling or
[43:24] trying to get man in his hand that man
[43:26] will say the same thing as God says but
[43:29] you know because of man's Fallen nature
[43:31] and how the devil's enticing Spirits the
[43:33] devil's always got man to say something
[43:35] different or add or take away but I
[43:37] believe I'm looking at the choir here
[43:39] this morning that say what the spirit
[43:41] says amen because if you look at what
[43:43] the spirit you know what God has backed
[43:45] up I think we should say Amen too amen
[43:48] because if he's amened it he'll amen it
[43:50] again I'm so I'm just trying to find my
[43:52] feet here um if you don't
[43:55] mind amen see
[43:58] now what is what is um see we we
[44:01] finished off last Sunday speaking about
[44:03] the Welsh policeman being the Welsh
[44:05] Revival so he he embodied that Revival
[44:08] where where the men who are looking for
[44:10] this revival came over from America I
[44:12] think it was they did not need to go to
[44:13] a building to find it but he was the
[44:15] personification of the Revival he was
[44:18] the manifestation of it he says and you
[44:21] as as this policeman would say you're
[44:22] standing in the midst of it cuz I am the
[44:24] Welsh Revival so there has to be a
[44:26] people upon the Earth that they say the
[44:28] same thing the spirit says that it's no
[44:30] longer just ink on paper anymore but
[44:32] it's in a living manifestation so you
[44:36] know brother B makes some statements and
[44:38] and so I'm just going to read a bit here
[44:40] but he says this in the church age book
[44:42] and I tell you if you ever want to um
[44:44] you know instead of Doom scrolling read
[44:46] through the church AE book on your phone
[44:48] you know you'll find a lot more
[44:49] beneficial but he says there it is he's
[44:51] sending a Vindicated Prophet he's
[44:53] sending a prophet after almost 2,000
[44:55] years he's sending someone who is so far
[44:57] from organization education and the word
[44:59] of religion world of religion there John
[45:01] the Baptist and Elijah of old he'll hear
[45:03] only from God and and he'll have thus
[45:04] sayith the Lord and speak for God he'll
[45:06] be God's mouthpiece And he as it is
[45:08] declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the
[45:10] hearts of the children to the fathers so
[45:13] back to the original Faith he'll bring
[45:14] back the elect of the last day and
[45:17] they'll hear a Vindicator Prophet give
[45:18] the exact truth as it was with Paul he
[45:21] will restore the truth as they had and
[45:22] those elect with him in that day will be
[45:25] the ones who truly manifest the law and
[45:27] be his body and be his voice and will
[45:29] perform his Works Hallelujah do you see
[45:32] it there's a people that will be his
[45:34] body will do his works and will have his
[45:36] voice amen so there will be a people
[45:38] just like this Welsh policeman they will
[45:41] be the living manifestation of his word
[45:43] in their day so that's why it's so
[45:45] important that we say what the spirit
[45:48] has said amen so he says here a moment
[45:52] momentary consideration of church
[45:54] history will prove how accurate this
[45:56] thought is in the dark ages the word was
[45:57] almost entirely lost to the people but
[46:00] God sent Luther with with the word the
[46:02] Lutheran spoke for God at that time but
[46:03] they organized again the pure word was
[46:05] lost for organizational Trends towards
[46:07] dogma and Creeds and not the simple word
[46:10] excuse me they could no longer speak for
[46:12] God then God sent Wiley and he was the
[46:13] voice uh with the word in his day the
[46:16] people who took his Revelation from God
[46:17] became living Epistles read in h of all
[46:19] men for their generation when the
[46:21] methodists failed God raised up others
[46:24] and it and so it has gone on through the
[46:26] years until in this last day there'll be
[46:28] another people in the land who under
[46:30] their Messenger will be the final voice
[46:32] to the final age you see this voice has
[46:35] to live it can't just be press play and
[46:37] Obey no God never sent a mechanical VI
[46:40] device to preach the gospel though it
[46:42] was stored on that that we could hear
[46:43] the voice of the message right but it
[46:45] was to be lived amen God never intended
[46:47] that the message stay on tapes and books
[46:49] and bibles just in print form but God
[46:51] has always intended his word be a living
[46:53] manifestation and a living people amen
[46:55] where the voice of God God Thunders out
[46:58] through a Sanctified dedicated life to
[47:00] God I me because we're going to realize
[47:02] that we have power in this day amen
[47:04] we're not just here as sitting ducks or
[47:06] your helpless uh helpless Damsel in
[47:08] Distress no we've been rescued amen
[47:10] we've been purchased we've been gathered
[47:12] we're no longer hidden behind the bars
[47:14] of unbelief and questions of man and the
[47:17] fog and opinions of man no we've been
[47:19] we've been brought down from that Tower
[47:21] amen the dragon's being slain amen we're
[47:23] being delivered amen I trust you have
[47:25] this morning amen so we're no longer
[47:27] Damsel in in distress but our great
[47:29] Prince amen the great king of glory amen
[47:31] who ransomed us now comes and lives in
[47:33] us and he gives the final kick to the
[47:36] devil to his bride to do hallelujah amen
[47:39] because why the work of God will be
[47:40] finished through you and I amen we're
[47:42] not waiting for the prophet to come back
[47:44] he will one day in the resurrection
[47:46] it'll all be over then anyway but you
[47:47] see we're not waiting for someone to
[47:49] come back and type all the Mysteries and
[47:50] make it all clear it's already happened
[47:52] I mean we're not sitting wondering is it
[47:54] true or is it not we've seen him prove
[47:56] it to be true that's why I think so many
[47:58] people who stand on soap boxes on the
[48:00] internet what life do they produce I
[48:02] mean what is the Vindication of what
[48:04] they're saying but you can go back and
[48:06] virtually every message that was
[48:07] recorded and you can hear God come back
[48:09] in behind that and vindicate it over and
[48:13] over and over again it was common
[48:15] knowledge in that day the angel of the
[48:16] Lord was with brother brandham his
[48:18] contemporaries it wasn't something that
[48:20] was just hatched up later they knew it
[48:22] was there CU they experienced that
[48:23] presence of that angel they knew he was
[48:26] with him
[48:27] right so it wasn't a mystery back then
[48:29] they were all well aware of it you see
[48:31] but that same Angel is with his word
[48:33] today amen God always backs up his word
[48:37] amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord see
[48:41] as we come down to this last age I don't
[48:43] have this um the the scripture here but
[48:47] but if we go to Revelations chapter 3
[48:49] Let's just read something quickly cuz I
[48:51] think we can if there's ever a people
[48:54] that can rest in the ability of God
[48:57] it is us if we ever rest in his ability
[49:01] that God has so Stripped Away man's
[49:03] opinions in this day that we can take
[49:05] the word as it is written and we can
[49:08] have confidence God will produce it how
[49:10] he wants to produce it right
[49:12] amen amen to Revelations 3 and we'll go
[49:15] to this is we know this is for our age
[49:17] but let's just read Revelations 3:14 and
[49:19] unto the angel of the Church of Lady
[49:21] oans uh write these things sayith the
[49:24] amen the faithful and true witness the
[49:26] the beginning of the creation of God
[49:29] Amen so when so so so the Lord is
[49:31] declaring the F you know uh he's
[49:33] declaring who he is in this age as the
[49:36] amen so who has the finalist say you
[49:39] know someone who who who gives the amen
[49:41] that's the final Authority he's the
[49:42] chief Authority he's not an opinion he
[49:45] is the he's not even an opinion he's the
[49:47] authority he has the final say I mean he
[49:49] is the absolute and every situation so
[49:52] God is saying this is who I'm this is
[49:54] how I'm going to be made known in this
[49:56] age as the amen amen so now the spirit
[49:59] is going to speak very expressly in this
[50:01] day with full Authority am mean to prove
[50:04] this is me amen this is not see we're
[50:06] not following ideas of man we're not
[50:08] following some tradition that's been
[50:10] handed down and it's dead and it's just
[50:12] a nice idea of culture no we follow the
[50:15] word of God that's living in this day
[50:17] amen remember the spirit and the bride
[50:19] say come okay so so what what whatever
[50:21] the spirit has declared we will say the
[50:24] same thing amen and that's just not an
[50:27] empty paring of it no the life of that
[50:29] word will come into you and I and will
[50:31] manifest it we will be the body of the
[50:33] Lord amen so he says he is the amen so
[50:36] and you he is the faithful and true
[50:38] witness how many times brother B you
[50:40] even preached this message yo he'd say a
[50:42] true witness testimony of a true witness
[50:44] he preached those kind you know and and
[50:46] I think even in that sermon he's just
[50:47] talking about hunting trips and God
[50:49] doing things in the wilderness he says
[50:51] that same spirit is here what is it
[50:53] that's the amen the faith on true
[50:55] witness coming down proving his word to
[50:57] you and I that we can say the same thing
[51:00] as the spirit says you know I'm so
[51:02] thankful we've got something to say in
[51:03] this age amen we don't just have some
[51:06] something hatched up in a Bible School
[51:07] somewhere but we've got a word from God
[51:10] Amen that we can we can declare that
[51:12] it's true is living and I say you are
[51:14] the testimony you're the evidence of it
[51:16] just like the Welsh policeman was the
[51:18] Welsh Revival you say you are the
[51:20] manifestation the proof that this
[51:22] message is Right amen because You' have
[51:24] been brought out of Darkness into light
[51:26] you come out of Darkness into religious
[51:28] Darkness you didn't come out of darkness
[51:29] and stand in darkness no whom the son
[51:31] has set free is free indeed am mean
[51:33] there's a total Deliverance among the
[51:35] people of God it doesn't matter what
[51:38] cage the devil tries to put you and you
[51:39] got to realize no that thing a lying
[51:41] vanity I'm going to say what the spirit
[51:44] says and the spirit says whever the son
[51:46] is set free is free indeed amen that I
[51:48] can do all things through Christ Jesus
[51:50] what strengthens me I'm more than a
[51:52] conqueror that's what the spirit says
[51:54] that's what the bride should say am mean
[51:56] we should that give T testimony and
[51:58] witness of what God has already
[52:01] declared am me because you can only live
[52:03] as high as your testim of of your
[52:05] confession if you confess you're never
[52:07] going to get anywhere guess what you're
[52:08] never going to get anywhere if you
[52:10] confess you never overcome guess what
[52:12] you won't overcome if you confess you're
[52:14] depressed and down and nothing's going
[52:16] to ever come right you're going to live
[52:18] by that because there's power in your in
[52:20] your voice life and death is in the
[52:22] power of the tongue amen if you confess
[52:25] there's nothing to this truth it won't
[52:26] won't affect you like it should amen but
[52:28] if you say yes Lord you're right your
[52:30] word is true you did purchase my
[52:32] salvation on Calvary you're here to
[52:34] deliver you're here to set me free
[52:36] you're here to encourage me Lord You're
[52:38] My Strength you're my shield you're my
[52:40] guide you're more than able Lord you
[52:42] know the way Lord I don't know the way I
[52:44] tell you what he'll come in behind that
[52:46] he'll say amen I will give the amen to
[52:48] your confession amen because why he is
[52:50] the high priest of our profession or our
[52:52] confession so I think we should always
[52:54] confess good even if it looks bad
[52:56] confess
[52:57] good amen it looked bad for it bad you
[53:01] it looked bad for Shadrach Meshach and
[53:02] abedo but they confess look we're not
[53:04] bowing to this image we're not bowing to
[53:07] this thing if we burn we burn if we
[53:08] don't God can deliver but you know it
[53:10] looked bad but they just confessed God's
[53:12] word was right and they weren't going to
[53:14] change their life based on what they
[53:15] were facing they they stayed with the
[53:18] word of
[53:19] God Amen then then what happened the
[53:21] amen walked in the fire with them amen
[53:23] the amen the faithful and true witness
[53:25] testified that they were his amen and
[53:28] even if they burnt they were still his
[53:29] amen the outcome didn't really matter
[53:31] the fact is they made up their mind the
[53:33] amen has spoken in Babylon and said
[53:35] you're my children you're circumcised
[53:37] sons of Abraham I'm going to walk with
[53:40] you amen praise the Lord friends he's
[53:43] still as much alive today as he was then
[53:46] amen this world has been burning seven
[53:48] times hotter amen the pressure's been on
[53:50] but I tell you the equalizer and the
[53:52] Overcomers in the building amen he's in
[53:54] our lives so it doesn't matter how bad
[53:56] things get get don't look at how bad
[53:57] things get you should look at how great
[53:58] your God is amen because remember here's
[54:01] the amen we are not this world is not
[54:03] going to end in complete failure for the
[54:06] believer it ain't going to end in
[54:08] complete failure it cannot cuz it's been
[54:10] prophesied we will overcome amen that we
[54:12] will leave this world triumphant amen we
[54:15] will leave this world not just you know
[54:17] not just surviving
[54:19] overcoming amen because you got to
[54:21] realize you got to come to a place where
[54:23] this you and the spirit say the same
[54:25] thing you see Gideon was threshing weed
[54:27] in secret he was not saying what God had
[54:30] said about the children of Israel he
[54:31] knew he was of the tribe of Manasseh he
[54:34] knew he was the son of Abraham he knew
[54:36] he was in the promised land but he was
[54:38] not confessing what God Said would
[54:40] happen if they followed God in that land
[54:42] and so he was hiding he was afraid he
[54:44] was threshing weed in secret but then
[54:46] the spirit the angel of the Lord came to
[54:48] him and and made him changes confession
[54:52] because when the angel of the Lord spoke
[54:53] to Gideon he said you're a mighty man of
[54:55] Valor I mean and here's a man hiding in
[54:58] secret just trying to survive and hide
[55:00] in caves like they all did but God had
[55:02] to awaken him saying look this is not
[55:04] what I say about you Gideon I call you a
[55:06] mighty man of Valor you're not a
[55:07] weakling you're not a shrimp you're not
[55:09] a loser you're Victorious amen so then
[55:11] what happened is God begin to work in
[55:13] his life to prove to him what he told
[55:15] him when he was threshing wheat what has
[55:17] God done in our Our Lives friends I mean
[55:20] we were thought we were from New Zealand
[55:22] from Africa somewhere from some place
[55:24] and we're just part of that culture part
[55:25] of that thing but then God came down
[55:27] amen into our lives and awaken us saying
[55:30] no you're my bride you're a virtuous
[55:31] woman amen you're bone of my bone Flesh
[55:34] of My Flesh life of my life you are part
[55:36] of me amen you're more than a person

[55:44] amen that is of the devil amen you got
[55:46] to realize no I'm a daughter of God I'm
[55:47] a Son of God sure I walk in humility but
[55:50] never let amen what color of your skin
[55:52] people racism is of hell and never ever
[55:55] let that spirit to control you and push
[55:57] you down no we're the children of the
[55:59] most high God doesn't matter what color
[56:02] you are that's irrelevant God's a god of
[56:04] righty he put a SE Gene in the in your
[56:06] soul before the foundation of the world
[56:08] Amen and you operate according to that
[56:11] hallelujah amen we should never knuckle
[56:14] down for no devil telling tell us we're
[56:16] no good we're nothing no that is not the
[56:19] confession of the Bride that's not the
[56:21] confession of the spirit amen that
[56:22] doesn't what God does not say those
[56:24] things about you amen there no second
[56:27] class citizen in his bride amen we're
[56:29] all part of the same body doesn't matter
[56:31] what language we speak where we're from
[56:32] our age that has got nothing to do with
[56:35] it amen we're all one in Christ Jesus so
[56:37] therefore we should walk that way we
[56:39] should talk that way we should treat
[56:40] others that way amen we are not
[56:43] downtrodden we're not nothings we're not
[56:45] no hopers no God has given us hope am
[56:48] mean he's given us expectation he's
[56:49] given us faith I mean to realize that we
[56:51] are not going to end in defeat but we're
[56:54] going to walk out Victorious amen and
[56:56] God has been pouring in Victory after
[56:58] Victory after Victory Amen to prove I'm
[57:02] with you I'm here I'm in charged amen
[57:05] you cannot lose everything's going to
[57:07] come out fine amen you trust in me amen
[57:10] I will carry you through amen I'm your

[57:15] healer I'm your all in all I'm your
[57:17] savior trust in me amen hallelujah
[57:20] because God when God looks at himself he
[57:23] never thinks I can't do it
[57:26] we should hear God's confession about
[57:27] himself I'm the Supreme one I'm the
[57:31] almighty there's none besides me there's
[57:33] no one equal with me amen I made all
[57:36] things by me all things consist amen I'm
[57:39] the sustainer I'm the Redeemer I'm the
[57:41] almighty God hallelujah even angels look
[57:44] dirty in my sight that's how high and
[57:45] holy I am amen but by the blood of Jesus
[57:48] Christ amen he so transforms your life
[57:51] amen that you're as holy as he is Holy
[57:53] you're as righteous as he is righteous
[57:55] amen you're sinless as he is
[57:58] sinless hallu was there a scripture for
[58:00] that absolutely he became sin who knew
[58:03] no sin that you become the very
[58:05] righteousness of God in
[58:08] Christ Hallelujah so when our God speaks
[58:11] about himself and now he's not arrogant
[58:14] he's not boastful he's just saying it it
[58:16] is that as it is he doesn't he doesn't
[58:19] need to talk himself up I mean he
[58:21] doesn't need to try and play himself out
[58:22] he's not a spin doctor he just tells the
[58:25] truth Hallelujah so he knows who he is
[58:28] amen he is not he is not some scared
[58:31] little wimp in the corner that that you
[58:34] got to pluck up some courage to take on
[58:35] the bad guys though he knows who he is
[58:38] amen and it's why it's so important we
[58:40] confess who our God is based on what his
[58:43] confession about
[58:46] himself
[58:47] hallelujah amen has our God ever
[58:51] lost can he
[58:53] lose will he lose no so what should the
[58:57] spirit and the bride say the same
[58:59] thing amen I trust this is real personal
[59:01] today we're going to have a I you know I
[59:03] think we can we we can rest we can cease
[59:06] from our own works we can cease from you
[59:09] know us trying to figure things out and
[59:11] make things happen no we can rest in his
[59:13] ability amen you know you know the
[59:15] Lord's in your
[59:16] corner has you ever seen a wrestling
[59:18] match more than one guy and you got you
[59:20] know there's two in the ring but you
[59:22] know the guy's got to tap out and get
[59:23] the other guy in who's ever seen that
[59:25] kind of thing
[59:27] the guy the guy on the outside of the
[59:29] Ring can do nothing until he gets tapped
[59:32] in that's right he can't do nothing you
[59:34] know he can be yelling at you you
[59:37] yelling at his teammates encouraging him
[59:39] saying just tap me in tap me in I I can
[59:42] get this guy I know how to pin him and
[59:43] make him look like a piece of origami on
[59:46] the mat he can't do nothing until he
[59:48] gets tabbed in how many times do we try
[59:52] and take the Devil by the and he's like
[59:55] he's worse than a slippery eel yeah he's
[59:57] a Slicker of Slickers he's like Mercury
[1:00:00] you just
[1:00:02] Quicksilver but you just tap in the Lord
[1:00:04] one time who's ever who's ever tried to
[1:00:06] fight a battle let's you know let's all
[1:00:08] be honest we've tried to work out things
[1:00:10] tried to make things work and then we
[1:00:12] just find our face on the M again down
[1:00:14] discouraged and but then somehow we just
[1:00:16] get a hand in and we just tap tap the
[1:00:18] Lord in and then you sit back and and
[1:00:21] your things just totally unfold and
[1:00:23] you're carrying the Victor out you think
[1:00:24] man how did that happen yeah and if you
[1:00:27] say well cuz I tagged him in Hallelujah
[1:00:31] he's still the same for us now you got
[1:00:33] to call him on the scene you got to call
[1:00:36] him on the scene he's a present help in
[1:00:37] time of trouble am mean he's not some
[1:00:39] distant God who's indifferent to what
[1:00:41] you're going through no see see the what
[1:00:43] does the Lord say I'm with you I'll
[1:00:46] never leave thee nor forsake there's
[1:00:47] probably a probably a scripture I
[1:00:49] probably refer to every sermon I'll
[1:00:51] never leave thee nor forsake thee I'm a
[1:00:53] present help in time of trouble I mean
[1:00:55] the Lord is NY amen you can't you know
[1:00:58] we can't think he's some distant thing
[1:00:59] now we should confess he's with me
[1:01:01] wherever I go he's with me amen and the
[1:01:04] hard times he with me good times he's
[1:01:05] with me this is the this should be the
[1:01:07] confession of the
[1:01:09] Bride
[1:01:10] hallelujah amen praise the Lord I'm so
[1:01:13] thankful that we can we can we can
[1:01:15] testify of God how he wants to be
[1:01:17] testified of cuz we're saying the same
[1:01:20] thing he's not three people he's not two
[1:01:22] people he's one person he's the Supreme
[1:01:24] one amen praise the Lord
[1:01:27] now we are are we still there okay we'll
[1:01:30] go to the next one he says yes sir the
[1:01:32] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:01:33] God it as its own mouthpiece So it's
[1:01:35] talking its own opinions as opposed to
[1:01:37] the word of God so God is turning on her
[1:01:39] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:01:41] and the bride for the voice of God will
[1:01:42] be in her yes it is for it says in the
[1:01:45] last chapter of Revelation 17 ver verse
[1:01:47] the F and the bride say come once more
[1:01:50] the world will head direct from God is
[1:01:51] at Pentecost but of course that word
[1:01:54] bride will be repudiated as in judge
[1:01:56] strong as in the first age amen so once
[1:01:59] more he says the the voice of God will
[1:02:02] be in her yes it is so remember this is
[1:02:06] where God's voice is going to come from
[1:02:08] the word of God comes into you
[1:02:10] transforms your life and it speaks
[1:02:13] out right it's quite quite a simple
[1:02:16] thing it comes in then it manifests out
[1:02:20] hallelujah amen so the so the voice of
[1:02:22] God is in you brother Braham says that
[1:02:25] if a a anointed man spirit filled man
[1:02:29] takes the word of word of God in his
[1:02:31] heart speaks it across his lips he says
[1:02:33] it's the same as deity speaking nothing
[1:02:36] can stand before that man that's what he
[1:02:39] says I mean so he's saying basically
[1:02:41] it's not that man speaking anymore or
[1:02:43] that woman it is God himself taking a
[1:02:46] vessel of clay using their vocal cords
[1:02:49] using their lips using their tongue to
[1:02:51] speak his word through them hallelujah
[1:02:54] hallelujah this is this is the condition
[1:02:56] he's put you in by his blood amen amen
[1:02:58] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so he
[1:03:00] says once more the world will he direct
[1:03:02] from God is at Pentecost I believe this
[1:03:04] is the this is a time where the world is
[1:03:06] hearing from God Amen cuz cuz what
[1:03:08] happened on the day of Pentecost it was
[1:03:10] the Fulfillment of Prophecy you know
[1:03:12] when when when the Holy Ghost came down
[1:03:14] filled them in the upper room they
[1:03:15] walked out like drunk people amen you
[1:03:18] know you know you know the uh the the
[1:03:20] Jews outside were making fun but Peter
[1:03:22] said no we're not drunk as you suppose
[1:03:24] but this is that spoken by the prophet
[1:03:26] Joel amen so now so so so Peter put them
[1:03:30] back into the scripture saying the
[1:03:31] prophecy you've read about you've heard
[1:03:32] about in the synagogues is living right
[1:03:34] in front of you that we are the
[1:03:36] embodiment the manifestation of what
[1:03:38] Joel was inspired to write I mean so now
[1:03:41] it was the world was hearing direct from
[1:03:43] God because the world was seeing God put
[1:03:45] on flesh am mean so was no longer
[1:03:48] prophecy it was now reality amen so now
[1:03:50] we can look at you should be look
[1:03:51] yourself in the mirror and say God by
[1:03:53] his Supreme Grace has made me the
[1:03:56] Fulfillment of
[1:03:58] Prophecy Lord amen you take even acts
[1:04:02] acts two Real Simple Thing repent be
[1:04:04] baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:06] for the remission of sin and you shall
[1:04:07] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:04:09] the promises to you to your children
[1:04:12] those are as far off in New Zealand and
[1:04:15] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:04:18] amen so now you have become the
[1:04:19] embodiment of that word it's no longer a
[1:04:22] nice idea on to argue about in the
[1:04:24] scripture because people will debate
[1:04:26] about baptism all the time it's no
[1:04:27] longer a debate it's now a
[1:04:30] reality amen so now what are you now you
[1:04:33] are the become the voice of God to this
[1:04:35] world why CU because the world is seeing
[1:04:38] God manifest himself hallu
[1:04:42] hallelujah amen I'm so thankful that we
[1:04:45] that that that God has made us such that
[1:04:47] we're more interested in living the
[1:04:49] world than debating it this world is
[1:04:51] full of debate on the scripture and
[1:04:53] brother and sisters about this last
[1:04:55] agage he says he says you have the word
[1:04:57] you have more Bibles than ever but
[1:04:58] you're not doing anything about the word
[1:05:00] except dividing and hacking it into
[1:05:01] pieces taking what you want leaving what
[1:05:03] you don't want you're more you're not
[1:05:05] interested in living it but debating it
[1:05:08] and I'm so thankful the Lord has made
[1:05:09] you and I that we're interested Lord I
[1:05:12] want you to live that's actually all I
[1:05:14] care about Lord is for you to live in my
[1:05:16] life am mean you to you to be glorified
[1:05:19] in my life Lord I'm not interested in
[1:05:20] debates and arguments and all these
[1:05:22] things those things don't help no one
[1:05:24] amen number one helps people is when
[1:05:27] they see the power of God the sweetness
[1:05:29] of the Holy Ghost living out of your
[1:05:31] life that they recognize there's
[1:05:33] something different about you more than
[1:05:35] how you dress more than how you talk all
[1:05:37] those things but there's a life that is
[1:05:39] coming out of you and they can see this
[1:05:41] person's more than just religious but
[1:05:43] there's a presence they love to be
[1:05:45] around like there's people in our lives
[1:05:47] friends of ours they're not Christians
[1:05:48] at all but they love to be around us and
[1:05:51] I believe it's not well certainly not me
[1:05:53] but you know maybe it's Christine's
[1:05:54] cooking and her loveing Hospitality but
[1:05:56] you know but but but they just love to
[1:05:58] be around us and I believe it's because
[1:06:00] the Holy Ghost they're attracted that
[1:06:01] that they don't know what they're being
[1:06:03] drawn to but it's God I believe it's the
[1:06:06] Lord amen and and and I'm sure you've
[1:06:08] got people in your lives like that they
[1:06:10] just love to be around you amen they may
[1:06:12] not see what you see or even have any
[1:06:14] kind of Faith but there but there's
[1:06:16] something in them that that that is
[1:06:19] attracted amen I believe that's one of
[1:06:21] the greatest things you could ever have
[1:06:23] is you have a atmosphere around you of
[1:06:25] the Holy ghost that's different to the
[1:06:27] spirit of the world amen amen so we're
[1:06:30] interested we're interested in living it
[1:06:31] not not debating it am mean you see
[1:06:36] now this world has its own
[1:06:39] voice and it declares because if you
[1:06:42] look here in Revelations 3 again he says
[1:06:44] because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:06:46] increase with Goods have need of nothing
[1:06:48] so there's a so the world is saying one
[1:06:50] thing but the spirit of God is saying
[1:06:52] another thing right so so this world is
[1:06:56] is is speaking but it's not in harmony
[1:06:58] with the word of God but when a when
[1:07:00] when anyone amen surrenders their life
[1:07:02] to the Lord and God fills them with the
[1:07:04] Holy Ghost then they will begin to say
[1:07:06] the things that the spirit says I mean
[1:07:09] you see now this is this is the sad
[1:07:12] state of this world we live in but God
[1:07:15] God has God has changed us in such a way
[1:07:18] that we can see the spirit and the bride
[1:07:20] are saying come we're saying the same
[1:07:21] thing now brother says about this the
[1:07:23] preacher called to live his I mean the I
[1:07:26] mean the the preachers called to
[1:07:27] preachers talking about sermons and live
[1:07:29] it too if you can't live it then stop
[1:07:31] preaching it but you're supposed to live
[1:07:32] your sermons he says all right here was
[1:07:34] voices oh we need in Jeffersonville
[1:07:36] thousands of lived voices I say we need
[1:07:39] thousands of lived voices here in the
[1:07:41] Wellington region I mean the Thunder of
[1:07:43] God thundering out in sweetness and
[1:07:45] Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking
[1:07:48] around in the Earth today without a
[1:07:49] blemish am mean yes sir real Christians
[1:07:52] that's Thunder against the enemy if you
[1:07:55] want to give the devil a black eye you
[1:07:58] live this way right it's not much how
[1:08:00] much you can jump and holler and scream
[1:08:02] and run and all these things no it's an
[1:08:04] undefiled it's a pure holy Sweet Life
[1:08:07] That's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:08:10] I mean the devil don't care how much you
[1:08:11] can how loud you can Hollow the devil
[1:08:14] don't care how much you can jump or how
[1:08:15] much you do this or shout but What Hurts
[1:08:17] The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy
[1:08:20] life consecrated to God say anything to
[1:08:23] him call him anything just as sweet as
[1:08:25] it can be and move right on oh my that
[1:08:28] throws him away that's the Thunder that
[1:08:31] shakes the devil hallelujah amen ain't
[1:08:35] that powerful amen because yo that's the
[1:08:37] great secret it's not how much you got
[1:08:39] in your top two inches that shakes the
[1:08:40] devil it's a sweet loving holy life
[1:08:43] that's why it's so important never have
[1:08:45] any ought against anyone at all ever
[1:08:49] never have any ill feelings never have
[1:08:52] any kind of wall hardness but never let
[1:08:55] that come come into your heart
[1:08:56] whatsoever always be sweet loving kind
[1:09:00] never let any or come in whatever you do
[1:09:03] because that's what because that's the
[1:09:04] devil's great sneaky tactic as he say if
[1:09:06] I can just get ought in that person that
[1:09:09] because of them and what they've done
[1:09:11] you know it'll become a filter that that
[1:09:13] person will just will operate through
[1:09:15] that
[1:09:16] filter you know like someone for example
[1:09:18] they get a be in their Bonnet about
[1:09:20] someone they will look through at
[1:09:22] everyone else through that filter and
[1:09:24] that's the thing I'll talk about not
[1:09:26] necessarily referring to that person but
[1:09:27] they'll start operating differently
[1:09:30] based on that filter who's who
[1:09:32] understands what I'm meaning right so so
[1:09:34] we should never oh well this person you
[1:09:36] know they've done this to me or they say
[1:09:38] this or they believe this therefore I'm
[1:09:39] going to swing the other way and go to
[1:09:41] extreme that's that is not the right way
[1:09:44] to
[1:09:45] live God has ordained that the word walk
[1:09:47] right down the
[1:09:48] middle love and Holiness loving
[1:09:51] everybody do they agree with you no but
[1:09:53] you can love them anyway the Lord amen
[1:09:56] have they been mean to you yeah but you
[1:09:57] can still love them right you can see
[1:09:59] see we should you it doesn't matter what
[1:10:01] people have done to us in our lives we
[1:10:03] should have it that when we pray for
[1:10:05] them or you know we should feel sorry
[1:10:08] for them we should never feel angry or
[1:10:10] bitter or resentful or or they deserve
[1:10:12] that they deserve to be here in the
[1:10:14] tribulation they no we should never have
[1:10:16] that in our minds we should be Lord I
[1:10:19] want them in glory land I want them to
[1:10:21] join the Holy Angel Band too Lord
[1:10:23] irrespective of what they've done
[1:10:26] where where you where their current
[1:10:27] direction is we should never say well
[1:10:29] they should have done better this is
[1:10:30] their fault blah blah blah no we should
[1:10:31] never feel that
[1:10:33] way we should always have a sweet loving
[1:10:37] Pure Life cuz that will that's the
[1:10:39] Thunder that shakes the devil amen
[1:10:42] because the devil hates that life that's
[1:10:43] the thing that that's the thing that
[1:10:45] really shakes him yeah the devil laughs
[1:10:48] at all kinds of other things but when he
[1:10:49] sees that life amen because remember the
[1:10:53] the bride the spirit of the I'd say come
[1:10:56] but it's a living thing it's more than
[1:10:58] just saying words cuz anyone can read
[1:11:00] that scripture but it's got to be
[1:11:02] manifested it's got to be living amen
[1:11:04] amen and you got to realize now if
[1:11:06] you're saying come we know we have a
[1:11:08] message and if you got a message the
[1:11:11] reason we can say come is because we got
[1:11:13] a destination for them right we don't
[1:11:16] just have an empty just come to a
[1:11:17] building come to some theology come to
[1:11:20] this understanding even more than just
[1:11:22] saying come to God Senter prophit no
[1:11:25] it's come to The Living Waters come to
[1:11:27] Christ revealed in this day trust it
[1:11:29] didn't offend anyone you see because
[1:11:31] because the message is more than God
[1:11:32] said to Prophet right you know if the
[1:11:35] disciples you know if John if the
[1:11:37] Disciples of John were saying look God
[1:11:39] sent a prophet and messiah's there
[1:11:41] they've missed the whole thing right
[1:11:43] Messiah was on Earth so the purpose of
[1:11:45] John was to point the the the people to
[1:11:48] the Messiah and he did but if the
[1:11:50] Disciples of John just were pointing
[1:11:51] people to John they they've missed the
[1:11:54] whole message
[1:11:55] right and Messiah his word is upon the
[1:11:58] Earth right now right this message was
[1:12:00] to introduce Jesus Christ to the
[1:12:04] world and it's done that did it not
[1:12:06] introduce Jesus Christ to
[1:12:08] you amen so we're got a place that
[1:12:10] people can come come find rest amen even
[1:12:14] this church when I was really birth you
[1:12:16] know we that prayer meeting we first had
[1:12:18] I know pretty much none of us were here
[1:12:20] back then but you know just a few of us
[1:12:22] but the you know the Lord repeated a few
[1:12:24] years ago he said if you remain humble
[1:12:25] my word will continue to go forth and
[1:12:27] I'll bring my people here and they'll
[1:12:29] find rest so in other words if we remain
[1:12:31] humble a call will go out come come take
[1:12:35] the Waters of Life freely come find Rest
[1:12:38] by his great great pools of water and
[1:12:40] you know come come come lay down under
[1:12:42] the Shady trees and you know all these
[1:12:45] things come find rest and we've seen
[1:12:48] people find rest for their souls amen
[1:12:51] why cuz the call went out come but
[1:12:54] there's got to be a humility behind that
[1:12:55] call it can't be an arrogant call we
[1:12:58] can't be arrogant thinking we're better
[1:12:59] than the person on the street we're not
[1:13:01] better than them we're not better than
[1:13:03] the people that come here on a Saturday
[1:13:05] we ain't better than anyone it's God's
[1:13:07] Supreme Grace that found us it's God's
[1:13:10] Supreme Grace that keeps us we ain't
[1:13:12] better than anyone else so never get
[1:13:14] that in your mind oh we're better than
[1:13:16] the oh just the nominal church and we're
[1:13:17] this and what no no forget
[1:13:20] it who found you you didn't find
[1:13:22] yourself who keeps you it ain't you
[1:13:26] who's leading you well it shouldn't be
[1:13:27] you it's him
[1:13:31] hallelujah amen praise the
[1:13:33] Lord I'm just trying to find where I am
[1:13:35] now there's there's always wait let's
[1:13:38] see if I can find this here now brother
[1:13:40] raham speaks about as we read here about
[1:13:43] that we would be um white rment would be
[1:13:47] received okay come to me and you know
[1:13:51] and white Rond that thou mayest be
[1:13:53] clothed
[1:13:55] now brother B says that the
[1:13:57] isav that that that we're called to put
[1:13:59] on that we can see is
[1:14:01] free but there but there's a price in
[1:14:04] those garments because in order to say
[1:14:07] come to you know in order to say the
[1:14:08] same thing as the spirit says we're
[1:14:10] going to be separated to him right we
[1:14:13] can't be caught up in the things of the
[1:14:14] world and this is really really boils
[1:14:17] down to what's going on in our hearts
[1:14:19] cuz we can look the part we can dress
[1:14:21] the part we can speak the part but
[1:14:23] what's going on here right because it's
[1:14:25] really a separation and here is really
[1:14:27] the most important thing then it'll be
[1:14:29] everywhere else right so now he says
[1:14:32] here he says that there is a price to
[1:14:34] pay for those garments and that is the
[1:14:37] price of Separation now many people
[1:14:39] think of Separation as of I can't do
[1:14:41] this I can't do that I can't do here
[1:14:44] that may be part of it but that's not
[1:14:46] real separation that's a that's a
[1:14:48] monastery mentality living in some place
[1:14:51] somewhere you know that's not real
[1:14:54] separation it's a separation in the
[1:14:55] heart cuz remember we're separated from
[1:14:57] one thing but we're separated from one
[1:15:00] thing to another thing so for example
[1:15:02] when I was when I was in the world I was
[1:15:04] separated to the world I thought like
[1:15:06] the world I partied like the world I
[1:15:09] drank like the world I gamed like the
[1:15:12] world I didn't even like the world I was
[1:15:14] separated to the World by my first birth
[1:15:16] right but then the Lord interrupted that
[1:15:19] and said no no no you're separated to
[1:15:21] the wrong thing you're mine child you're
[1:15:23] mine my son so what did he do he came
[1:15:26] into my life I gave my life over to him
[1:15:28] then he separated my me to him so from
[1:15:32] the world to him amen now there's a
[1:15:35] great power in that now there's a call
[1:15:38] that always go out goes out in every age
[1:15:40] his um sorry Lily I you I don't have too
[1:15:42] many pictures today but we'll get to
[1:15:43] some now okay she says put pictures in
[1:15:46] so now here they are worshiping the
[1:15:47] golden Cal then then then Moses comes
[1:15:49] down from the mountain and he makes this
[1:15:51] call who is on the Lord's Side I mean so
[1:15:54] so when before Moses came in with this
[1:15:57] call there was everyone was mixed
[1:16:00] everyone was doing their own thing they
[1:16:01] were worshiping the Cal they worshiping
[1:16:03] the god of their imagination whatever's
[1:16:05] hashtag trending on some social media
[1:16:07] thing but then A call came into the camp
[1:16:10] who's on the Lord's Side come unto me
[1:16:12] and something in the sons of Levi said
[1:16:14] yes amen I'm coming amen so they
[1:16:18] gathered themselves to Moses why cuz
[1:16:20] there was a call and God was basically
[1:16:22] saying I want to put a new garment on
[1:16:24] you I want to put white garments on you
[1:16:26] but the cost was they had to separate
[1:16:28] themselves from what was going on to to
[1:16:32] Moses amen I tell you that separation is
[1:16:35] worth it it pays off amen it really pays
[1:16:39] off because you got to realize you know
[1:16:41] the devil gets it in your mind well
[1:16:42] you're just going to be put in a prison
[1:16:44] and have no fun I'll tell you what
[1:16:46] friends you ever meet God it's the most
[1:16:48] fun you ever have in your life it's the
[1:16:50] most fulfilling joyful life you could
[1:16:53] ever have cuz I remember many a many a
[1:16:55] morning any day of the you know any day
[1:16:57] of the week waking up with a hangover
[1:16:59] not remembering what I did just full of
[1:17:01] regret amen but I remember being at camp
[1:17:03] meetings drunk on the spirit realizing I
[1:17:05] was drunk on the spirit staring around
[1:17:07] praising God there wasn't a hangover
[1:17:09] there was no regret amen it was just all
[1:17:12] awesome and I wanted more of it
[1:17:14] hallelujah amen so it depends what you
[1:17:16] separ it's worth being separated to God
[1:17:19] Amen it doesn't just pay off in death it
[1:17:21] pays off in life amen it pays off for
[1:17:23] every day of your life is worth it amen
[1:17:26] so never let some enticing Spirit try
[1:17:28] and tell you there's nothing to serving
[1:17:30] God there's everything amen there's youo
[1:17:33] this word is full of reality amen it's
[1:17:36] it's it's not Theory it's reality amen
[1:17:38] the moving of the spirit is a real thing
[1:17:41] am mean for God to transform a life it's
[1:17:43] a real thing am mean it's more than just
[1:17:45] a you know more than just a trying to
[1:17:47] patch up your life no God changes Our
[1:17:50] Lives Hallelujah now this price yeah you
[1:17:55] these white garments might yeah you see
[1:17:57] this is why there's such a thing in this
[1:17:59] day there's a cause for basically any
[1:18:01] group under heaven right now there's
[1:18:05] striving environment
[1:18:07] anything
[1:18:09] pollution race gender countries War
[1:18:13] whatever it is wokeism all these things
[1:18:16] there's causes what is it trying to do
[1:18:18] it's trying to break our
[1:18:20] separation it's trying to it's trying to
[1:18:23] it's trying to steal white robe off
[1:18:25] people that's what it's trying to do cuz
[1:18:27] it's cuz it cost separate you got to be
[1:18:29] separated from those things to have this
[1:18:31] white robe right so we can't be caught
[1:18:34] up in the ideology of this world it
[1:18:36] doesn't matter how close to home it gets
[1:18:38] I tell you before Titus came and
[1:18:40] destroyed Jerusalem it was real close to
[1:18:42] home to the Israeli you know the Jewish
[1:18:45] Christians that they were being
[1:18:46] oppressed by Rome they were living in
[1:18:48] Jerusalem cuz Jesus said when when the
[1:18:51] enemy en campuses about the city pray
[1:18:53] that your flight's not in Sabbath on
[1:18:54] snowy day and just flee to the hills he
[1:18:56] prophesied of it right so for the Jewish
[1:18:58] Believers back then there was a real
[1:19:00] pressure from their from their
[1:19:02] unbelieving neighbors because there was
[1:19:03] a there was this pressure building up
[1:19:06] we're going to overthrow these Romans
[1:19:08] look at what they've done to us look
[1:19:10] look what they've done to your blood kin
[1:19:11] it was real close to home for those
[1:19:13] Jewish Believers there I mean they
[1:19:15] weren't indifferent to it they could
[1:19:17] relate to the sufferings of their
[1:19:18] countrymen because they were one of them
[1:19:21] but they realized they're more than just
[1:19:22] a Jew they're part of God I mean so so
[1:19:25] so when all that stuff happened and
[1:19:26] imagine the pressure maybe maybe your
[1:19:29] you know your neighbor here Levi comes
[1:19:31] along he says
[1:19:33] Benjamin you see what they did to my
[1:19:35] daughter the other day see what these
[1:19:37] Romans are doing we're going to have a
[1:19:38] meeting Benjamin there's an uprising
[1:19:41] we're getting weapons in we're going to
[1:19:43] we're going to kill the serpent the
[1:19:45] words prophesied we're going to be free
[1:19:47] we're going to be free Jehovah's going
[1:19:49] to send his Messiah you better be you're
[1:19:51] either for us or against us Benjamin
[1:19:53] which one are you look you're one of us
[1:19:55] you're a circumcised son of Abraham went
[1:19:57] to the same synagogue we're the same
[1:19:59] family you better you better side with
[1:20:01] this otherwise you're a traitor to your
[1:20:03] nation imagine the pressure they're
[1:20:05] under but they had white robes on they
[1:20:09] were separated from those things because
[1:20:12] they realized God was greater than what
[1:20:14] was going on and then Messiah told them
[1:20:16] doesn't matter what they try and do that
[1:20:18] that place was doomed and I I'm sorry to
[1:20:21] say it friends this world is doomed no
[1:20:23] one will make any country great again
[1:20:25] it's gone but God has given us white
[1:20:28] ropes to be separated from every pull of
[1:20:30] this world that we can walk undefiled
[1:20:32] and white that when the Call Comes we're
[1:20:34] going
[1:20:36] home do I am I not sad for this world
[1:20:38] I'm sad for this world people are dying
[1:20:41] suffering everywhere but the only answer
[1:20:44] is not us trying to rebuild a nation or
[1:20:46] a continent or a group am mean our only
[1:20:48] hope is the Lord Jesus Christ The Prince
[1:20:51] of Peace coming amen so if we want to
[1:20:53] keep these white robs be separated from
[1:20:55] those things amen sure you pray for
[1:20:57] those people pray God open their eyes
[1:20:59] that there's a way out of this place and
[1:21:01] they're not going to go into a Slaughter
[1:21:02] you ever look at that you look at a
[1:21:04] documentary of that Siege of Jerusalem
[1:21:06] that was a horrible
[1:21:07] thing that was a horrible thing blood
[1:21:10] literally rolled out the streets when
[1:21:12] the Romans butchered everyone it was
[1:21:13] terrible the things they endured and
[1:21:16] when I maybe I put it on the WhatsApp I
[1:21:18] don't know but when I saw that and I
[1:21:20] just saw the saw the energy of those
[1:21:22] Jewish people trying to deliver their I
[1:21:25] bleed I cried for that oh God these
[1:21:27] people put such an effort into trying to
[1:21:29] deliver their Kingdom trying to deliver
[1:21:31] their Capital but you already prophesied
[1:21:33] it's gone and they gave their lives for
[1:21:37] nothing we don't want to be in that
[1:21:39] category I don't know why I've gone this
[1:21:40] way but here I am we don't want to be
[1:21:43] caught up in those things it won't help
[1:21:45] nothing because this world is being
[1:21:47] prophesied it's doomed well should we
[1:21:49] plan for the future absolutely should we
[1:21:52] have Ambitions absolutely should we make
[1:21:53] have families get married absolutely
[1:21:56] maybe in 100 years maybe tomorrow but
[1:21:58] live enjoy life in the
[1:22:01] Lord don't be don't be in despair with
[1:22:04] this world's you know what's going to
[1:22:06] happen God has it in his hand but I'm
[1:22:08] saying be separated from it don't be
[1:22:10] pulled by all these things no matter how
[1:22:12] close to home it is to you you know you
[1:22:14] can maybe put yourselves exactly in in
[1:22:17] in that suffering but be separated from
[1:22:19] it cuz there's power in that separation
[1:22:22] amen when the angel of the Lord came to
[1:22:24] came to um uh Manar and his wife came to
[1:22:27] the wife of Manar about Samson being
[1:22:29] born and the instructions were that she
[1:22:31] was commanded to keep herself from from
[1:22:34] strong drink and all these things amen
[1:22:36] strong drink and so if I can find it
[1:22:38] drink not wine nor strong drink no eat
[1:22:41] uh eat not any unclean thing so be
[1:22:43] separated and but there was a purpose in
[1:22:45] that separation it wasn't to make her
[1:22:47] life hard it was the fact that out of
[1:22:49] her was going to come a deliverer I mean
[1:22:51] that would start to break the Yoke of
[1:22:52] the enemy amen that Samson would be born
[1:22:54] out of that family and you know what the
[1:22:56] name man no means
[1:22:59] rest it means rest so here's a man and
[1:23:02] his wife living in a chaos of the time
[1:23:05] of Judges but they're living in rest and
[1:23:09] he's told be
[1:23:10] separated and the deliverer is going to
[1:23:12] come out of you what happens when a
[1:23:14] church is separated to God what happens
[1:23:17] when a body of people love the Lord one
[1:23:20] heart one mind one Accord what happens a
[1:23:24] the the the deliverer comes forth I mean
[1:23:27] the Lord comes down begins to set
[1:23:29] captives Free Break the bands of the
[1:23:31] Philistines of people's lives break that
[1:23:33] cruelty of sin off people's lives why
[1:23:35] because there's are people that are
[1:23:36] separated because we we see the value of
[1:23:38] Separation we've seen the power of
[1:23:40] Separation we've seen what it
[1:23:43] does
[1:23:45] amen
[1:23:49] hallelujah and what did it produce it
[1:23:51] produce Sam well you say well Samson
[1:23:53] didn't give his heart to God forget that
[1:23:56] it brought a deliverer he killed more in
[1:23:58] his death than in his life amen so he
[1:24:01] actually died
[1:24:04] Victorious amen but that's what that's
[1:24:07] what that's what separation produced he
[1:24:10] picked up a Jawbone of a of an ass of a
[1:24:12] donkey he killed a thousand men carried
[1:24:15] the gates of Gaza and the frames 40 odd
[1:24:18] miles up a hill he did incredible things
[1:24:21] why cuz he was separated to God Amen
[1:24:24] brother R says he wasn't some big muscle
[1:24:27] Hulk guy Hulk smash kind of a guy he was
[1:24:29] a little bitty shrimp but he had he was
[1:24:32] living in that Nazarite vow and that's
[1:24:35] what gave him the power amen because he
[1:24:37] was separated to the Lord he was saying
[1:24:39] or living what the spirit
[1:24:41] said amen friends if a man under the
[1:24:46] blood of bulls and goats didn't even
[1:24:49] give his whole life to the Lord if he
[1:24:51] could do this how much more people that
[1:24:55] don't just give part of their lives but
[1:24:57] have given everything and they're not
[1:25:00] under the blood of bulls and goats but
[1:25:01] they're under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:25:03] and God doesn't just come and anoint
[1:25:05] them from time to time but God comes and
[1:25:07] dwells in their vessel amen how much
[1:25:09] more what we could do what God could do
[1:25:11] in you and I amen when we speak his word
[1:25:14] and God comes in behinds it and amens it
[1:25:17] amen to prove that it's true prove our
[1:25:19] life is right oh Lord come live in a
[1:25:22] greater
[1:25:23] way Hallelujah I'm going to I'm going to
[1:25:25] wind up soon but you know here's another
[1:25:28] one the prodical
[1:25:30] son when he was raised up in his in his
[1:25:33] father's house he wasn't separated to to
[1:25:36] how his father wanted life to be his
[1:25:38] heart was in the world he wanted to go
[1:25:40] out and try things and live he thought
[1:25:42] it so restricted you know you just just
[1:25:45] working for his father didn't see the
[1:25:47] value of where he was living so he he
[1:25:51] took his inheritance he went and wasted
[1:25:54] it all but then it said then he came to
[1:25:56] himself he came to himself he realized
[1:25:59] actually the separation of being
[1:26:01] separated from the pig pen cuz he cuz
[1:26:04] his heart caused him to end up in a pig
[1:26:05] pen and that's where every human heart
[1:26:07] that's unconverted you end up in a pig
[1:26:09] pen somewhere it may look fancy may look
[1:26:12] horrible but it's still a pig pin
[1:26:13] nonetheless but you see now what he did
[1:26:15] is he came to himself in the pig pin and
[1:26:17] he realized to be to be in his father's
[1:26:20] house to be separated from this thing
[1:26:22] was far more valuable than trying to
[1:26:24] just live off this you know the scraps
[1:26:26] of a
[1:26:27] pig brother Ram says that the angel of
[1:26:30] the Lord came into the pig pen and made
[1:26:33] him come to himself Hallelujah you see
[1:26:36] the value of a Praying Mom and Dad

[1:28:03] when you think about every trial we've
[1:28:04] come through every crunch Point what is
[1:28:07] the conclusion of our whole the matter
[1:28:11] we come to a place that we confess what
[1:28:13] God has said is right isn't that right
[1:28:16] really you know when all the Mind
[1:28:18] battles go away and we look into the
[1:28:20] word we go into our source of strength
[1:28:22] what do we do we begin to to say the
[1:28:24] same thing the spirit has already said
[1:28:27] hallelujah amen and what is God showing
[1:28:30] us teaching Us in those things that he
[1:28:32] has actually put his ring of authority
[1:28:35] on your
[1:28:36] hand amen remember we're not saying what
[1:28:39] a Bible School says not saying second
[1:28:41] opinions 8 says we're saying what he has
[1:28:44] already said amen so now he's got the
[1:28:46] best robe amen now he's now he's been
[1:28:49] given this ring of authority and he's
[1:28:51] got shoes on his feet so now he can walk
[1:28:55] who's ever ran across stones and bare
[1:28:58] feet who's ever run yeah I remember so
[1:29:01] so my grandparents uh live next door to
[1:29:03] me growing up they had prickles in their
[1:29:05] grass man they had prickles who knows
[1:29:07] prickles right we had to we had to kind
[1:29:10] of map out in our minds where to run to
[1:29:12] get to their front door it wasn't a
[1:29:14] straight line it was there and there
[1:29:16] around the tree and up here because we
[1:29:17] had to avoid all the prickles but then
[1:29:19] when we had shoes on I'm gone straight I
[1:29:23] ain't making these detours these
[1:29:24] needless detours because I've been
[1:29:26] dressed in a way that I can walk
[1:29:28] straight am mean that the that the
[1:29:30] conditions of the world that I'm walking
[1:29:32] are not going to make me Veer left or
[1:29:34] right I mean why cuz I got shoes on my
[1:29:36] feet and it's the same thing with you
[1:29:38] and I amen when the Lord has placed
[1:29:40] shoes on our feet amen that that that we
[1:29:42] don't have to change our path based on
[1:29:45] what's Happening from the outside no but
[1:29:47] because of what's on the inside we can
[1:29:49] walk straight in the word of God I mean
[1:29:51] we don't have to vear left or right and
[1:29:53] worry about what's going oh no this
[1:29:55] prickle can't get I can see it I know it
[1:29:57] can affect me but I'm dressed right God
[1:29:59] has given me the best robe he's put
[1:30:01] shoes on my feet I mean and the reason I
[1:30:04] can walk straight is because now I'm
[1:30:06] saying the same thing as he
[1:30:08] is
[1:30:10] hallelujah
[1:30:12] amen friends we got a message we've got
[1:30:15] a I was going to wrap up just as the
[1:30:18] last one all all the pictures little all
[1:30:20] the
[1:30:21] pictures the woman at the well
[1:30:24] went from debating with the
[1:30:26] Messiah to to declaring come see a man
[1:30:31] right so
[1:30:33] her and and the Lord said the same thing
[1:30:37] here was the bride put into action how
[1:30:39] long did it take it to be put into
[1:30:40] action a brief conversation now I
[1:30:43] haven't I you maybe go read John 4 and
[1:30:46] see and maybe time yourself from when
[1:30:48] they start talking to when she starts
[1:30:50] running just a few minutes just a few
[1:30:53] minutes in the presence of the Lord amen
[1:30:57] caus her to drop her water pot drop her
[1:30:59] old life drop the complexes remember she
[1:31:02] went to the well by herself cuz she
[1:31:04] wasn't welcome with the woman so she
[1:31:06] went as an outcast but then she went
[1:31:09] back into that same city telling the
[1:31:11] same people that did not make her feel
[1:31:12] welcome come see a man come see a man
[1:31:15] who's told me all over that is this not
[1:31:17] the Messiah amen so she went there
[1:31:19] complexed and troubled but just in those
[1:31:21] few moments amen the Lord by revealing
[1:31:24] himself to her set her free of all those
[1:31:26] things and she began to act and speak
[1:31:28] not based on her past but acted on who
[1:31:31] she was in
[1:31:32] him amen what was it because why the
[1:31:35] spirit and the bride were saying come
[1:31:38] amen and then the people came out heard
[1:31:40] the Lord speak and and they said now we
[1:31:42] believe him not because of what your
[1:31:44] testimony but because of what he said
[1:31:46] what you have said and what he said is
[1:31:48] the same
[1:31:49] thing we have a message
[1:31:51] friends we have a god
[1:31:54] that heals delivers saves gives rest
[1:31:59] gives peace and and we have remember she
[1:32:03] did not take them back to a well with no
[1:32:05] one there he was there waiting we do not
[1:32:09] take a people to an empty place we have
[1:32:12] a word that lives and that's why it's so
