quickly um just like everyone who was partakers of doing the bathroom renovations can you stand to your feet please sister priscilla you can't stay on your can anyone please stand everyone who helped with the bathrooms please because we know sister belinda helped too god bless so i'd like to thank each and every one of you who helped it's a big job the showers can be put into but i wanted to do

like to say thank you very much mr priscilla brother matt everyone who yeah it looks real nice so god bless you really appreciate it so let's stand and we're going to um just go straight to the scripture now it's been a good day amen i really appreciate yeah i'm so thankful that you're like brother ed was saying that you know the lord's brought us together i'm so glad we live in a season of unity and it's god made unity it's not man-made unity amen let's um so yeah just amen i really appreciate it amen so we're going to go to romans chapter 11 and then we then we're going to go to isaiah 52 and 14 to romans 11 and um from verse 13. romans 11 13 we're going to read down to verse 24. for i speak to you gentiles and so much as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify my own office if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh they speak of the jews and might save some of them for if either casting away for sorry for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall be the receiving of them but life from the dead for the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy and so are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and thou bring a wild olive tree work grafted in among them and with them partakers of the root and the fatness of the olive tree boaster boasts not thyself against the branches but if thou boast thou beareth not the root but the root thee thou will say then the branches were broken off that i might be grafted in well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standeth by faith be not high-minded but fair for if god spared not the natural branches take heed least he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which foul severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shall be cut off and they also if they abide not not still in unbelief shall be grafted in for god is able to graft in them again for if thou wert cut off of the olive tree which is well by nature and were graft contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery least ye should by wise in your own conceits that the blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be coming we're going to read one scripture from isaiah 42 uh sorry 52 and verse 14 if i have this down correctly yeah so we're just going to read this one verse here isaiah 52 and 14. and sorry as many were astonished at thee his visage was so mad more than any man and his form more than the sons of men amen let's be our heads in a word of prayer this afternoon lord jesus lord i'm so glad there was a call come home and by your grace you allowed us to come back to you lord we just so glad we can lord this easter season this resurrection season but lord we just want to look into your word to look at the cause of the resurrection what prices were paid lord and i just want to ask may this not be some intellectual idea but may it anchor down into our souls lord you paid a great price for us lord we want to give you glory for it tonight lord as we partake of communion and foot washing we remember your death till you come lord we praise your great name we thank you we just pray you just anoint speaker and hear one more time may you personally visit all of our hearts lord oh may we praise your name lord thank you we're built to do so we thank you for this opportunity to be in your presence once again in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats uh this evening i know i'm not going to be too long here but i want to speak about the price of being grafted in it was a great price we just read in the scripture that he was marred more than any man now when something's mad it's def it's disfigured he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities a chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed it was a great cost i just i just pray this is real because you know i never ever want communion foot washing to be a ritual oh this is this on the calendar we're going to go through this motion but or easter for that matter or any religious holiday that we can't but i trust it'll just mean more to us every day what the lord has done for us his great plan of redemption even brother brown would say when he spoke about christ being the masterpiece how you know god had his first masterpiece in eden with with with adam and even but satan slipped under the walls of god's word and marred that masterpiece but god being god cannot be defeated and and and and he began to rebuild that masterpiece and it was it was bigger to manifest and you know abraham and different ones until finally headed up into jesus christ the masterpiece was standing on the earth but that was only the first part of the masterpiece there had to be a second part of that masterpiece which was the woman now when you think of grafting who's ever done grafting before anyone done any grafting so what you do is you take a a living tree or a little you know when i was when i did grafting was on my friend's orchard when i was about eight or nine you know and you know so anyway so you take a stick it just looks like a stick but you want the fruit that you know is in that stick and then you have to cut the the tree or whatever that you want to put that stick into this has got to be a wounding there's got to be a cutting and then but also the one you put in has got to be cut also and you push it together and you bind it up then the life that's in the roots now goes into that branch and it produces fruit now brother brown says a lot of things about uh you know different citrus fruit living off say tangerines growing off an olive tree because i mean i mean i mean a orange tree because of grafting now when i talk about us being grafted in i want to use what the apostle paul just said about how the gentiles have been grafted in but there's a great price for that grafting there was a lot of cutting there was a lot of wounding and it was a great price that was paid in order that we would be connected with christ that we would bring forth his life so when brother speaks about the masterpiece he says like with michelangelo michelangelo had in his mind what moses should look like and he stood there with a big slab of marble and because he was con he was commissioned to make it but he had hit in his mind this is what moses would look like and he spent toilets hours sanding chiseling at first but then sanding it down honing it down looking at here moving the light maybe look at different angles until finally what was in his heart now was manifested in front of him and he got so inspired he picked up his hammer and cried out speak because he was so he just thought now this thing must live because it's so real to him and he took it and you can actually see it on the knee of of of the statue he took the hammer and smacked it on the knee and you know it was and then so people said well that's now a flaw in the masterpiece but brother brown says it's the floor that makes the masterpiece it's the floor it's the wounding it's the it's the disfigured place makes the masterpiece you know because you know i don't understand how god can through death bring life i don't understand that but god in his great infinite wisdom realized that he would he would have to redeem us and it took death hallelujah remember it's not just it's not just him that's got to die to redeem us and be raised we got to die we can't just partake because if we partake of just the life of god without a death will bring forth our own fruit this is what he says the denominational world has done they're not dead but they're holding on to their own creeds they're producing their own fruit but those who really die hallelujah those who really die die to themselves let the word be born in them don't produce their own life anymore they produce his life so was the flaw now you think about when you know jesus you know god was so i you know i i so enjoyed this morning just that one thought there's jesus in gethsemane i could just live on this for a long time because you think about it you know god was a god was a know jesus was a man like you and i brother brown said he could have had got married had children he could have done a whole lot of things but but he was looking beyond the natural no you know and and he was looking to another kind of wife that he wanted to redeem and so the only difference we know is he you know he was born he bypassed the original sin he knew who he was but he had a body like our bodies he was tempted on all points yet without sins he could be tempted he could be tried he got wary he got sick he had hard days he had great days you know he had struggles he had temptations and pressure and people pulling on him all kinds of ways and and it would have been like brother branham where brother brown knew when someone actually loved him and some were just a hypocrite but saying brother brown we appreciate you so much but he could see beyond it by that gift and see that person was lying so jesus would have been much the same way so he went through a lot of things but he had to make a choice he wanted to grafton a people he wanted a grafton a people he didn't want to just like adam adam was right there in the garden and and he was sad he's he's alone and god was just reflecting and adam his own loneliness and it's like when jesus was here his whole purpose was i want to gather my wife i don't want to walk this wall alone i want to walk with somebody somebody who'll accept me you know christianity is polished up too much if we could go stand there on mount calvary when jesus is gasped with his last breath and he's marred more than any man and the blood's coming down and you know people are mocking him making fun of him and you know and he's not hanging there with a loincloth he's stripped naked in front of his disciples you know there's nothing glamorous in that there's nothing that's you know you could polish up didn't matter what filter you put on your instagram post it looked ugly it would look messy but it was the greatest achievement that a man could ever achieve where he laid down his life for his friends hallelujah it didn't matter if the whole world went so you know a certain way he had a people that he was going to redeem and he was determined not my will but thy will be done he knew that god's will was more important than his own will hallelujah so to me it's incredible where he could because he knew what he was going to go through he wasn't walking up there blind you know when you know when he's standing on mount transfiguration moses and elijah are preaching to him and it says in one of the gospels they told him what he had to accomplish in jerusalem so they preached to him a service i know how long but they would have run through all the scriptures all the types and shadows i don't know how much time it took probably not that long but anyway after that visitation he realized this is why i've come into the world hallelujah it became real real and i believe they would have would have spoken to him with a lot of passion a lot of you know a lot of intensity because no one else could do the job there wasn't someone else to do the job he was the one who had to do the job and yet all of that on his heart and he could look beyond now and look into into the future hallelujah amen for this cause i've come into the world he went to calvary with one scripture that he'd come forth i'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption i'll not leave his soul in hell or suffer my holy one to see corruption he went to the he went to calvary with that on his heart he had a revelation hallelujah he had a revelation you can put me in the grave i'm going to come out of the grave no man takes my life from me but i lay it down and if i lay it down i'll bring it back up again hallelujah see when is a man but he had to make a choice that's because he wanted a grafting if i can put it that way he saw you and i he didn't want us just to walk this life as religious people or whatever kind of people he wanted his own life to pulsate through us hallelujah hallelujah you know i went back and i listened to the last part of brother impal's service on wednesday he makes a lot of statements powerful statements right where he speaks about we should believe and thank god they're coming home he said our young people are coming back i'll go go watch what's the whole thing but if not what's that portion the last part he's burdened about it hallelujah because i believe it was god was burdened about it because we need to look beyond what we see and we need to look to the promise we need to i you know i pray god just anchors him in our souls actually it's been taken care of hallelujah you know what an incredible statement you think of a man hanging on across mud more than any man and he says it's finished it's finished that was his final statement and he bowed his head and he gave up the ghost he actually gave his life he released his own life to die he says it's finished now when you think about something being finished to me to me he's saying more than just my life is finished or my suffering's done he's actually saying now the payment for the sin of the world has been paid hallelujah if something's been paid then a purchase can be made right now we don't have to say well i hope it's going to work we know it's going to work because it already has worked has it worked on you and i hallelujah has it worked on you and i did he take us from being vile sinners or just religious people pharisees or wherever we're from doesn't matter where we came from transformed us by the power of his blood now we're walking in units of life has it worked yes it's a yes yes it's worked amen so if it's worked on you and i why would it not work on somebody else hallelujah amen so now it is finn i hallelujah now when he says it's finished this word finished it means to conclude something it means to accomplish to make an end i mean to pay uh from the thais dictionary it means to perform the last act which completes a process now as i said to me it's more than just his life finishing but he's purchased all salvation maybe i'm just going to say some things but i trusted anchors deep he purchased all salvation all deliverance all liberty all healing all of it so he he purchased my salvation your salvation our family salvation our love on salvation it doesn't matter where they are he purchased it doesn't matter their age he purchased it he purchased their deliverance from unbelief from the demons of hell he purchased it harlow because he purchased it for you and i he pushed it for them amen so what it is finished and that's why really when you think about it we should be the most thankful people thank you lord thank you lord not just for our own salvation i'm not talking about just for ourselves and looking back at the past of what he's done for us but no if he's done something in the past for us then he'll do it in the future for us because he's the same god amen hallelujah you following me i trust this kind of means something i mean to be saved in the past we can thank him because it's easy to look back but what about with the eyes of faith looking forward and saying lord you did it there you're this and you purchased that and this here hallelujah so we can begin to thank god amen thank you for my family hallelujah and i heard a brother pray i don't know where it was but he says i'm thanking you lord he begins to list a whole bunch of things i'm thanking you lord for my salvation i'm thanking you lord for my family salvation i'm thanking you all for healing i'm thanking you lord for healing this person just because he's praying for all the needs in the church i'm thanking you lord for the wayward when the and the ones who have gone off and the ones who are entering it i'm thanking you lord for them coming home hallelujah and by the end of that prayer i was just like amen holy that's how we should be i'm thanking you lord they're coming you know what i love is it's not how you know it's not us in our mind working out how it's going to happen that's irrelevant how it's going to happen it's that god is going to begin to act amen i think we had the scripture this morning he ever liveth to make us into sessions for us hallelujah so if he's gonna intercede for us i mean that means he's gonna act on our behalf we have an advocate jesus christ our high priest he's working on our behalf so his work on our behalf he'll do things we cannot do hallelujah that's why we should be thanking god whoever thanks god in prayer you thank god for things you don't even see thank god for the current state maybe very opposite what do you thank him for but you begin to thank him amen hallelujah it is finished he was mad more than any other human being that's because he had to what a price that had to be paid to graft a sin [Music] that we would be partakers of his life that it wouldn't be us living no more it would be him living brother bam says this and i think it's a mighty conqueror before any victory can be won there must be great prices paid oh what prices sometimes they're very deep they can make great scars are tearing down but in order to have the mountain you've got to have the valley before you can have the sunshine you've got to get the rain before you can have the light you've got to get the night before we can have right we've had to have wrong we would never know what wrong was but in order to conquer and to win the greatest battle was ever won one stepped out of glory many years ago he did not take upon himself the form of an angel he did not come as some great person but he was going to prove it did not take muskets and bullets and atomic bombs to win a war he clothed himself in humility like a little baby was born in a manger there was not even a place for his birth when he come i want you to look at the different material of warfare what he used i'm going to stop there he didn't use argument he didn't use pressure he used something very different now adam's race was all in bondage there they were without hope without god without chance without mercy without anything that could help them the great enemies of the lower regions of the lost had them shut up in darkness there was no way out there was no one could help nothing could be done it looked like a total complete loss but our hero who came down from the portals of glory condescending down for there was not a man on earth that could do the job they were all as worldly speaking in the same boat we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies none of us could help each other we stood helpless defeated chaos in every hand all united we could not keep the laws and ceremonies finding their weaknesses and so forth we could not do it and it seemed like the whole human race was laid waste and then he come and he came down because he was in the beginning the bible said he was the word he was the logos that went out of god and the logos in the beginning was the word and he became the word then when he ascended up on that glorious day of easter he became not only the word but he became the high priest of his own word oh what a glorious thing brother neville just think of it he's not only the word but he is the high priest of his own word how could we doubt it how could we walk to him and not believe that we receive what we ask for for he is the word and the intercessor of the word the logos became word and the word became flesh and the same flesh that was word received up in the glory now is the high priest making intercession by himself to his word oh that's what it takes that's the material that the church has got what a weapon there's never been one like it he was the word and when he come he was born in a manger he came to use the weapon of l-o-v-e love to conquer the world not with army bullets not with machine guns and tanks but he come in a different manner he come in the form of love he was god's love one time as little boy i used to think that christ loved me and god hated me because christ died for me but god had something against me but i come to find out that christ is the very heart of god god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have eternal life now he come first to conquer and the thing that the devil has put in the world was hatred and he come to conquer hatred when we win our battles and so forth in the world's battles it always leaves continually a hatred because battles of that is of the enemy but christ come with love to conquer hatred to love those who were unlovable he come with a different weapon and he humbled himself made him a little lower than the angels to suffer death and to give an example and when he was here on earth he walked among men hallelujah he paid a great price it wasn't an easy thing for him to do but yet because of love because he was god's redemption manifested he was determined hallelujah and he did the job now here we are i'm not going to be much longer but here we are in 2021 here we are it seems like a very late hour i'll say this it doesn't matter how dark the world gets our god is greater his sacrifice is still more than enough the power that he released through the blood is still more than enough amen he released the power by his holy ghost that day amen that conquers all devils right conquers all sickness conquers all unbelief conquers all superstition conquers all prejudice conquers all malice strife envy conquers it all hallelujah and it doesn't matter how much this world is unbelieving or whatever it is doesn't matter how gross darkness is on the people there is a light that shineth greater than the darkness because the darkness is just absence of light but when light shines darkness flees hallelujah did he win as a man and he humbled himself to the death of the cross you know it's very easy to talk about the glory of the resurrection but it started with a un selfish decision which led to death to bring forth life now what about you and i death must happen for life to come forth i'll say it's very easy for us to get stuck in our ways this is how church goes i just go i'm going to preach to myself especially this is how church goes this is what this is what will happen we'll sing these songs these people will praise like this the pray the other parts will preach this way we'll go and have lunch and this is just how it works and we get to an expectation and that expectation is really there's no scale i have but it's really well below what it should be right if we have god who created heavens and earth hallelujah that came to dwell he died that he'd dwell on you and i i mean that god would come and live and do things far beyond we could do you know there's no one greater than our god no devil no complex no unbelief no superstition no trouble no indifference i mean nothing no lukewarmness is greater than our god hallelujah no no scars of the past nothing nothing of that is greater than our god hallelujah amen he is more powerful than anything but in order for him to live there must be a death hallelujah and it's not many times people get put pressure on different age brackets in the church saying they've got to come to their place and hurry up actually it's all of us have got to start with the death from the pastor to the janitor amen we've all got to die if we want to have a resurrection season you say well we're in the bright age it can be far greater than what we're experiencing right this can be a far greater revival hallelujah i love that brother moses speaking about the different brothers they had the bible they brought a revival hallelujah we have the same bible the same god maybe a different season but he's the same one otherwise he can produce the same things amen so why on earth should we ever live below our privilege holy but we serve a supernatural god amen that can come and live in our life and shake your world amen but it's up to us are we willing to stay dead are we willing to die not to build a barricade of quotes and scriptures as an excuse of just being a formal believer you know because it's very easy to build a a fortress of quotes and scriptures and you know but i'm mature now and i've seen too much and you know and people make an excuse why they can't walk in their first love but jesus was in his first love all the time i have a joy set before me i've got a joy when he calls his disciples he is calling a part of his joy come walk with me peter james and john he went to the woman of the well come walk with me mary magdalene come walk with me harlow because he had a joy set before him holla he knew would cause his death he didn't just want to be with him he wanted to be in them hallelujah and in order for them to be grafted in holy he knew every stripe he'd receive he knew the crown when he put on his head he knew his bed would be ripped out he knew all the laughter the mockery and the everything he'd go through that didn't make him shrink back and all you know humanly yes but it didn't make him lose his first love hallelujah now if he walked you know his ministry started in jordan under death and finished in a death to bring forth life what about you and i we can't just now as i said hello you're here but i'm preaching to myself we can't continue on as we are there's more there's more to have there's more to experience i mean there's more of god to live hallelujah because many times we're pulling out i hear saying how on earth how on earth can the revival continue down to another generation and we look at everything that we have trouble and we look but we should just thank god and worship and love him hallelujah what did that little baby bear do when when they went and trashed brother brown's tent he just found the molasses bucket and he ended up wearing all that he just got in there and the mother was saying come on church is finished get out of there you know this guy guy's turned up and we don't know what he's gonna do and you know get out of the word you know stop being so happy and then he wasn't he was you know one of them yeah part of him god that's mama calling me but this is too good and you know and then finally he ends up wearing the whole thing and then he goes out there and mama wasn't upset i even just grabbed and started looking and the other cub just started looking hey what happened they had a good old revival because of what he was feeding on hallelujah and everything in the word we need revival it's in the bible hallelujah it's in the message amen the spirit of god is here to anoint this word and make it live in you and i it's not coming it's here that's why he rose i meant the spirit of god would anoint this word i would live in our lives hallelujah yeah so sometimes we get so worried about things happening around us but we can begin to praise god i'm thanking you lord i'm thanking you lord for my healing i'm thanking you lord for my deliverance i'm thanking you lord for the family circle being unbroken on that day i'm thank remember we've already been told it the reason john ryan could walk around and say thank you lord praise the lord i'm healed because god told him thus saith the lord he wasn't trying to work himself up i mean but when the word is quickened to you i mean when the promise is made alive and as i said on friday i wish i had it on the big screen that this quickening power is here to quicken every promise on the grounds to you and i every promise on the grounds is alive to you and i that means that every salvation of our family is for us you know i was thinking hallelujah we have a believer's culture no i'm not talking about dress nationality cuisine no no there's a culture in the believer to behave a certain way and if you look at moses he had a culture pharaoh i'm not compromising with you i'm bringing everyone with me we're not leaving one hoof behind and he was determined we're all coming there was a culture that's what i'm talking about culture i mean and that same life is in you and i although that same determination should be you and i satan you're not keeping them you may have had them for decades or years or whatever more we may have just woken up to the fact hey our children need to be saved hallelujah it's good to wake up to that realization because now you can go to prayer about it you know brother caid's preached a sermon i was telling brother armand he preached a sermon trouble brings purpose hallelujah holy amen so trouble in our life should bring purpose and that purpose should not be to complain but that purpose should be to drive ourselves to god say god undertake for me because troubles come hallelujah and it should bring us purpose hallelujah hallelujah there is more to have there is more to have there's more in this word that we have i don't even think we've touched the sides of it yet oh there's a reality of god you know there is untapped resources in god the prophet tells us untapped resources so i say god may we not be distracted by this world but may we be so gripped what what are you gripped by i want to see jesus live i want to see the one that died for me i want to see his presence move in our lives our homes and our jobs wherever we go there'll be an atmosphere around us doesn't matter what troubles around us i want to see jesus live hallelujah and a good way to start at a shop bit of love not be so hard on people but shall better love better long suffering hallelujah amen hallelujah there's more can you imagine let's go to the passover night hallelujah they're about to partake of the lamb that lamb there was healing in that lamb they walked 40 years in the desert a desert is not an ideal place to walk for 40 years by the way their clothes were still good their shoes were still good caleb had an inner strength because of that lamb he had an inner strength 84 years old give me my mountain he had a sword in his hand a promise in his heart he got that mountain hallelujah all because they went out of egypt by the strength of the lamb hallelujah that was just under a lot of bulls and goats now how much more you and i we're leaving this world we're leaving this world but we're taking all of everyone with us that we can our family's coming i just believe it we must start confessing it lord i'm thanking you lord for my family i'm thanking you lord for my loved ones i'm thanking you lord they're coming i don't know how they'll come that's your business god that's your business they might be on the other side of the world i'm that's not my problem that's god's problem but we start thanking them lord i'm thanking you lord somehow some way they're gonna come hallelujah that's how we should be well it's impossible god works in the impossible that's where he steps on the battlefield say here i am i'm going to prove myself hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen they left great price was paid for them to leave egypt a lot of blood was shared the token was applied the blood was applied on the door lintel everything so their body spirit soul the blood was applied they walked out those who believed went into the promised land they got their promise i believe we're promise getters whatever you want to call it are we we're not just talking about saying maybe one day no no we're there to possess we're there to possess every promise this is who we are that's how we're built to be that's not something we become that's just how we're built i mean by the baptism of the holy ghost we're built that way hallelujah he was wounded now we're just going to maybe transition to the communion bars what do you think about it lord he took the bread and he break it i don't know what was going through his mind when he took the bread and he broke it but no doubt because he because he was led by vision remember so no doubt when he was told about what he would suffer he saw it by vision this is just me so he saw the beatings the mockery the rejection he saw it by vision and then he saw himself living out that vision because of a choice so when he looked at his disciples he picked up the bread he broke it maybe say this is my body which is broken and he saw it come through his mind or something you may just see this the disciples just saw this but what that represented what he knew that would mean but he wanted some people to be grafted hallelujah he was singing of you and i those sacred hands took that bread and break it hallelujah because he wanted us to be part of this bread we're one bread we're one body we're not divided hallelujah be knew the cost that we would come and be grafted in that his life will come forth [Music] as i said it took a death it'll take a death a greater consecration we want to see god more i'll take a greater consecration it'll take a death there's a lot of things maybe we're going to die out too but it's worth it it's worth it when we're around the throne there'll be no regret we won't be i missed out on that and i can't believe i didn't see that one and not to do that no i missed there won't be any of that that won't even be near our mind but thank god thank god you got me here lord thank god you put something in my soul for you it wasn't me that chose he said to his disciples you didn't choose me i chose you hallelujah hallelujah amen amen let's go to first corinthians 11. [Music] let's read the scripture here hallelujah i love him don't you [Music] where would we be i love that this morning he knew we needed him in this day hey man we're gonna go to first corinthians 11 and 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this during remembrance of me and after the manna also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this bad me do ye as off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that drink eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many a weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat carry ye one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will i sit in order when i come so this is an open communion table but we have to examine ourselves lord is there unconfessed sin in my life do i need to put something right lord examine me right because we can't take of this unworthily amen but if we confess it all and lay it all in the lord's hands but it's all up to you amen but what a to me it's always a sacred moment lord you'd you were marred more than any man that by your grace i'd be grafted in as a from a while being a wild olive tree grafted into the hallelujah amen and by your death you purchased my salvation everything i need off for this earthly journey and you it's been paid for it's been paid in full friends hallelujah amen so brother brother ear brother could be in you want to come forward amen we're just going to you just want to come forward we're going to ask the lord to bless we know there's not as literal body and blood just it's just symbolic or emblems we're just gonna let's just stand together shall we tonight so we're gonna ask the lord to bless these and then we're going to then you can have your seats and pray and whenever you're ready come forward come forward and you can partake of the communion so let's bow heads gracious eternal father oh lord lord my heart is filled with joy lord because of what you've done lord i'm not trusting in my own ability lord to make it to heaven lord as the prophet said and i so agree i'd hate to try and get to heaven on my visions or my preaching or any miracles he is he said i'm only trusting in the blood of jesus christ to get me there and lord i just say amen lord i hate to try and get to heaven and anything i could do it myself lord what a failure but lord you're not a failure lord and you're the one we're depending upon lord jesus you're our perfect sacrifice lord you're our perfect lamb that was accepted on our behalf and because you were accepted we're accepted in the beloved so dear god as we gather here tonight lord i just pray lord that you would you would just uh may we just come soberly sincere lord with great sincerity in our hearts dear lord if there's any sin in our lives lord may we put it right may we confess it to you lord i just want to lift this congregation into your presence by prayer praying o god that you would forgive them lord of any wrongs and he sins lord jesus father may just wash us in your blood dear god we we don't want to come here and drink and eat unworthily lord but lord want to examine ourselves now father i pray you'll touch our lives oh god and lord may my whole lives be under your blood dear lord i pray you're just blessed this bread oh lord how would it be lord when you lifted it up and you broke it lord jesus knowing what you would have to go through that lord soon after that moment [Music] you
