[14:28] and see that light hey and that peace
[14:31] and that will end the eternal pneus of
[14:35] that you can take your seats we've got a
[14:38] special today I don't want to give too
[14:41] much away Isaac will you tell you when
[14:44] you when he wrote that song and the
[14:49] inspiration at that point you want some
[14:54] beat were there yep yep yeah okay the
[15:00] song is called um go tell John them and
[15:03] can you put the words up on the screen
[15:05] by the end ok now it's quite a weirdy
[15:08] songs a lot of words to it so you've got
[15:12] to kind of take snippets of breath when
[15:13] you get a chance it's one of those songs
[15:15] but um the idea of the song is that sort
[15:21] of types John and his time that he had
[15:25] wondering whether Jesus was the Christ
[15:27] and then the typeset to this day some
[15:29] people think knows that brother branwell
[15:31] of someone else and all that sort of
[15:32] things so that the verse is that the
[15:34] first light the first verses are
[15:36] essentially John thinking is that your
[15:38] do we look for another and then the
[15:39] answer that Jesus gave to John was look
[15:45] at what's happening this is my word come
[15:49] to pass so you don't have to worry as it
[15:50] true or not it's actually coming to pass
[15:52] in the idea of the song is that God
[15:54] interpreters own word by bringing it to
[15:56] pass so people can fast and argue and
[15:58] everything over it but God just goes
[16:00] hidden does it anyway and those that
[16:02] recognize it just enjoy it coming to
[16:04] pass so that's what the songs about if I
[16:09] get it wrong forgive me because I don't
[16:11] really not that well and this song we
[16:13] was written about the same time as do
[16:14] believe but I didn't really put it
[16:15] together so it's kind of like his
[16:17] brother so I kind of stole a few little
[16:19] strong patterns and that from that one
[16:21] came at the same time he kind of over
[16:23] let
[16:26] it's quite a fast song if I get it wrong
[16:29] i'm just going to stop and carry on i'll
[16:31] just do what I do don't worry about me
[16:35] okay and I might hand if I can't play
[16:38] probably might when I did flooring my
[16:40] elbow went funny and I can't actually
[16:42] hold the keys down very strong on the
[16:46] stands at chords so yeah it was worse on
[16:50] Wednesday or the last day I played I
[16:51] could hardly push the strings down I'm
[16:53] surprised I made it through but we'll
[16:55] see how we go
[17:06] is it you or do we look for another I
[17:12] can hear John say his eagle eyes we're
[17:18] getting clouded
[17:20] over seem to have lost his way John's
[17:26] disciples went to Jesus told him all
[17:31] that John it's a
[17:34] Jesus and then with the message and this
[17:40] is what he said
[17:43] go tell John that the lame they walk go
[17:48] tell John that the blind they see go
[17:53] tell John that the date erase the
[17:57] captives they have all been granted
[18:00] Liberty go tell John when my prophet
[18:05] speaks believe it receive it in your
[18:08] heart you don't have to understand it it
[18:13] stands all alone and I'll interpret it
[18:16] by bringing it to pies you don't have to
[18:20] understand it it stands all alone and
[18:24] I'll interpret it by bringing it to find
[18:28] is it him or do we look for another I
[18:33] have heard some say is this elijah that
[18:40] Malachi spoke

[35:17] Corinthians 15 verses 51 down to about
[35:26] 57
[35:50] first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51
[35:54] says behold I show you a mystery we
[35:57] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[36:00] changed in a moment and the twinkling of
[36:04] an eye at the last trumpet for the
[36:06] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[36:08] be raised incorruptible and we shall be
[36:11] changed for this corruptible must put on
[36:13] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[36:16] immortality so when this corruptible
[36:19] shall have put on incorruption and this
[36:21] mortal shall have put on immortality
[36:22] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[36:25] that is written death is swallowed up
[36:28] tree o death where is thy sting o grave

[36:35] Heavenly Father was so grateful for your
[36:38] word Lord and his brother branham said
[36:40] many times before he would start
[36:42] preaching or do you would say let's just
[36:43] turn to the word because well we know
[36:45] that your words won't fail Lord but our
[36:47] words failed many times they always fail
[36:49] but we're so glad that we have your word
[36:51] that's an anchor for our soul that's a
[36:54] light to our path what it leads us and
[36:58] it guides us and it makes us sure Lord
[37:01] as we go through life when we get more
[37:03] responsibilities Lord and we get we
[37:05] begin to have to lead people we realize
[37:08] Lord that we lead the wrong way and we
[37:11] lead into failure and misery but we are
[37:13] so happy that we can follow your
[37:16] leadership and follow your word and it
[37:17] gives us courage Lord to press on nine
[37:20] Lord that if we follow the truth and if
[37:22] we follow you that it's eternal and that
[37:24] its strong and secure so we just thank
[37:26] you for being here in our midst this

[37:34] lawton that um some of us here I've got
[37:36] an invested interest than that with our
[37:38] children being the other just pay your
[37:39] bliss not only our children but all the
[37:41] children the young people that go Lord
[37:43] may they meet you in a powerful way may
[37:46] their lives be changed mat not just be a
[37:48] just an emotional decision as they get
[37:52] sort of worked up with your friends and
[37:54] that but may it may there be something
[37:56] just sink down in his soul Lord that
[37:58] would change the life and those that
[38:00] already changed us may they be something
[38:02] more for them
[38:02] to give them strength and to keep them
[38:05] set on the path of righteousness so I
[38:08] just want to commit ourselves um we
[38:09] thank you for this good day we thank you
[38:11] for your blessings and we thank you for
[38:13] the victory and Jesus Christ pray this
[38:15] in Jesus name Amen praise the lawd you
[38:18] can take your seats this morning okay
[38:23] the subject that I want to speak on this
[38:27] morning is called land land and it's a
[38:33] funny scripture to read and try and tie
[38:36] it into land but it does eventually end
[38:39] up to be to do with land the scripture
[38:41] that we just read and I just find it
[38:45] fascinating that the subject of land
[38:48] this essentially the six inches of soil
[38:51] it sits underneath our feet here you can
[38:54] almost tie the whole gospel into it it's
[38:56] an amazing thing and I just love how the
[38:59] Lord has made creation and has made
[39:03] everything that if we would just stop
[39:04] and look around and take care and
[39:07] observe that we can see the fingerprints
[39:10] of God through everything and I'm not
[39:15] overly mechanically minded but there are
[39:18] some people here that I know that I and
[39:20] they see like a maybe a vehicle and they
[39:24] appreciate how the vehicle works and the
[39:27] mechanics of it and then they appreciate
[39:29] even will win open up the hood and they
[39:32] can see just how wonderful it's made of
[39:34] how this part works on that part and
[39:36] that works there and there and it all
[39:37] works together I don't really do that
[39:43] yes but i like the word of god not that
[39:48] they don't but I just enjoy how you see
[39:52] it and look so good then you go and look
[39:53] into it and you see her every part fits
[39:55] all together and works perfectly it
[39:58] never ceases to throw my soul every time
[40:00] you might think it's such a simple thing
[40:02] and you start looking into it and you
[40:03] realize this is complex but it all works
[40:06] together so well and land has been one
[40:09] of those little studies that I've done
[40:10] that I've just really enjoyed so can you
[40:12] bring up the first slide dear brother
[40:14] Andy oh I don't have a clicker sorry so
[40:16] maybe i might do brother Tim's think
[40:18] we've got the yeah what did brother I'll
[40:23] record it the finger technology will get
[40:25] that okay that's our scripts for their
[40:27] next one I want to just quickly run over
[40:30] what I want to cover seems like a lot so
[40:32] maybe I go fast so you and this is where
[40:36] i'm going with us this is one of those
[40:37] ones where it just it's not really just
[40:39] a mismatch of information like my other
[40:41] one it's kind of got a sequence of
[40:43] events that it goes through and we're
[40:44] going to first talk about the principle
[40:47] of naturalness natural and spiritual
[40:49] land so we're going between the two so
[40:51] we're going to take the natural then
[40:53] we're going to take the spiritual as we
[40:54] go through so it's going to go back and
[40:55] forth okay we're going to go through the
[40:57] first principle that natural or
[40:59] spiritual land isn't owned period it
[41:01] doesn't get owned by man then then we
[41:04] could look into God's ownership of all
[41:06] natural and spiritual land and then
[41:08] we're going to look at a natural and
[41:09] spiritual promised land and then we're
[41:13] going to look at surrendering of
[41:14] governance of a natural and spiritual
[41:16] end and then we're going to look at
[41:18] possessing and subduing natural and
[41:20] spiritual end sounds complicated but
[41:22] it's not and then the natural and
[41:24] spiritual lamb passing away and then
[41:26] there's a new natural and spiritual land
[41:28] so it's all just talking about land but
[41:30] it's just different cycles that the land
[41:32] goes through and that we go through as
[41:34] we are the same so bring on the next one
[41:35] brother oh this is how I started to get
[41:39] this one this is um there's a little
[41:43] pocket Ricky a ring you buy though if
[41:46] you've been to brother John's house and
[41:48] the carpeted coast as you turn into his
[41:50] road is a little wrist area there with a
[41:52] picnic table
[41:53] and it's got a few apple trees and it's
[41:56] got a church across the road and then
[41:58] there's they've got this some little
[41:59] stand there and we went there with the
[42:01] children the other week and I just read
[42:03] this bit of information you can't read
[42:06] it but I'll just read it out some of it
[42:08] and it says that Ricky o Ranga
[42:10] translated into English means the gate
[42:12] or gateway to heaven so John doesn't
[42:16] realize this but he lives and they're so
[42:18] John lives in heaven tell him that he'll
[42:22] enjoy that he's a more spiritual than
[42:24] the rest of us obviously but I just
[42:28] talks about the history of Ricky are any
[42:30] and then it says there was a there was a
[42:33] moldy man called more puku and he was
[42:38] under attack in another area and he went
[42:39] down to Ricky a ring and he basically
[42:41] claimed it for his own and later on when
[42:44] the settlers the Europeans arrived he
[42:46] ended up selling half of the land that
[42:48] he owned and then they built a dairy
[42:53] farm and different things there as time
[42:55] went on and then and about the 60s more
[42:58] activity was happening and why can I so
[42:59] that the place to virtually shut down oh
[43:03] thank thnx here's the park here and his
[43:05] st. andrew's church was built in 1907 I
[43:08] think they had their first service there
[43:09] this was back in the days where when you
[43:11] settled a place you built a church that
[43:13] was what you did it doesn't happen
[43:16] anymore when they settled a place they
[43:17] build a stadium or something like that
[43:19] sports stadium or a movie theater or
[43:21] something but there was us now that got
[43:24] I got thinking about the fact that this
[43:27] man went in the topless land and then he
[43:30] owned the land in he sold it and it got
[43:32] me thinking about here the fact that
[43:34] this man never really owned anything
[43:36] okay so that's where I got this I Diego
[43:42] okay so now the principle of of natural
[43:45] land land not being owned who owns land
[43:48] or has owned land okay so you don't
[43:53] really own it okay you don't own it now
[43:56] I'll show you why and this is an
[43:58] important principle in the study brother
[44:02] Andy looks at a property that he likes
[44:03] he thinks I want to buy that land so he
[44:06] goes and he
[44:07] he puts on his before it he gets it then
[44:12] he does as fills out his agreement to
[44:16] purchase this land he fills that out and
[44:19] then he purchases pays the money than he
[44:24] purchases as land and then next one then
[44:29] brother and he owns a nice barn house he
[44:33] thinks he does okay but brother Andy has
[44:36] only purchased that land under the
[44:38] governance of the New Zealand government
[44:40] so the New Zealand government has come
[44:42] in here and they have essentially taken
[44:46] ownership are taken governance of this
[44:48] land and they have said they have made a
[44:50] law that says you may buy from us the
[44:53] right to occupy a piece of land so
[44:56] they've formed a law that says you can
[44:57] now if you go through these channels you
[45:00] can buy this land you can you can buy
[45:02] the rights to occupy a piece of land
[45:04] okay brother Andy doesn't own it he just
[45:06] bought the rights to occupy it under the
[45:08] current government government okay he
[45:11] doesn't own it now let's say it's
[45:13] 1939-1945 forces go to the next one and
[45:21] the Japanese turn up here and Andy had
[45:25] brought his land in 1939 and he was all
[45:28] set to raise his family now if things
[45:32] hadn't gone as well as what they went in
[45:34] World War two and the Japanese made it
[45:36] all the way here and they took over New
[45:37] Zealand they would take over the
[45:40] governance of this country and then
[45:42] brother Andy's agreement that he had
[45:44] with the current government whose piece
[45:46] of paper that he owns the land would now
[45:48] be if they decided null and void you no
[45:51] longer own this piece of land because
[45:53] the people that you bought the right to
[45:55] to occupy it don't have the rights to
[45:58] give it to you anymore so so if
[46:00] governance changes then the land that we
[46:05] might think that we own we don't own any
[46:07] more because we never did owner in the
[46:08] first place now the principle of Landers
[46:11] that's very important it always goes to
[46:13] the strongest person that wants at the
[46:15] most always now
[46:19] the many countries could take this land
[46:22] away from the New Zealand government but
[46:23] they don't want to they say you can keep
[46:26] that but if they wanted to they would be
[46:28] many countries that could come here and
[46:29] take it from the New Zealand government
[46:31] and then all of our agreements that we
[46:32] have with the new zealand government
[46:33] would be done that's the principle of
[46:36] land now sometimes no just go next one
[46:43] soundtrack as we go through this it just
[46:46] becomes more and more clear now we are
[46:49] spiritual land okay we've got natural an
[46:53] hour we'll go to the spiritual we are
[46:54] spiritual end that's the principle of
[46:57] this whole thing I just like this
[46:59] picture because I like old pictures and
[47:01] I like people hard-working men and women
[47:03] that look after the family fun and that
[47:08] I just like it so I put this picture the
[47:09] ads hasn't got much to deal with
[47:10] spiritual land but it makes you feel
[47:12] good doesn't it makes you feel like
[47:14] wholesome okay yeah now this is just my
[47:22] scripture on spiritual land Jesus talked
[47:25] about the side that went forth to so et
[47:27] types he said sorry and forth to so many
[47:30] sowed seeds and to land and then he
[47:32] ended up saying well you're the land and
[47:34] then the seed that got some was the
[47:35] words I've got into your land okay so
[47:38] that's that's just to show that we are
[47:39] spiritual land you know if we receive
[47:42] the tower grounders ready and we receive
[47:44] the word into our land then it brings
[47:46] forth fruit but other people the seed
[47:49] comes and then other things come in and
[47:51] take away that seeds so that seed word
[47:54] of god never grows in their land okay so
[47:56] so we are spiritual end that's the
[47:58] scripture here now the same principle
[48:01] applies to spiritual land think about
[48:06] this one spiritual land our spiritual
[48:09] and we don't own it we govern it someone
[48:14] else occupies it but we don't own it
[48:17] okay just just like natural land we
[48:20] don't own natural land we just we either
[48:22] govern it and we own it we occupied all
[48:25] we just occupied in some cases on a more
[48:27] simplistic system of governance
[48:31] we they don't have a government
[48:33] essentially someone could walk into a
[48:34] piece of land and say I'm going to own
[48:36] all this piece around or govern all this
[48:38] piece here i'm going to occupy he's the
[48:39] governor and you occupy all wrapped into
[48:41] one but as we get more complex we form
[48:43] governments and they work it out but
[48:45] essentially our spiritual land is the
[48:47] same we don't own our spiritual and we
[48:49] govern it and we occupy it we don't
[48:51] occupy it sorry someone else does but it
[48:53] has to be occupied every piece of land
[48:56] in this world somebody has somebody his
[49:00] governorship over it and even if they
[49:02] didn't use it there are some people that
[49:04] actually could occupied if they wanted
[49:05] to next now the next step that we have
[49:12] is now the principle that God actually
[49:17] owns all land he owns the whole lot now
[49:22] we talk about ownership this is
[49:24] ownership so the scripture here says
[49:26] it's a little bit me to see but I can't
[49:30] see the psalm I think it's 24 7 says the
[49:32] earth is the Lord's and the fullness
[49:35] thereof to me that sounds like ownership
[49:38] so he's saying I own this okay and I
[49:43] like to love this one another is 66 once
[49:45] is thus saith the Lord the heaven is my
[49:46] throne in the earth is my footstool
[49:48] whereas the house that you abou done to
[49:50] me and where is the place of my rest he
[49:52] calls the earth is footstool he owns it
[49:56] he can call it what he wants to we call
[49:58] it home because a footstool okay now
[50:04] spiritual and the next part of that
[50:09] versus the earth is the Lord's in the
[50:12] fullness thereof the world and they that
[50:14] dwell therein so not only has he got
[50:18] ownership of all the natural land he's
[50:22] also saying I own all the people that
[50:24] dwell in that on the earth as well and
[50:27] it includes all the spiritual and so now
[50:31] with this basis of ownership when we own
[50:38] something like like if I owned this
[50:41] battery I can actually own this battery
[50:43] I can't own land but I can own this
[50:45] probably simply because I can put it in
[50:47] my pocket and take it with me wherever I
[50:48] go and hang on to it me having ownership
[50:53] of this battery means that I can do
[50:56] whatever I like with this battery if I'd
[50:58] like to keep it I keep it if I don't
[51:01] want it I can throw it away but you
[51:04] can't tell me what I can and can't do
[51:05] with this battery if it's my battery I
[51:07] have a I decide what I want to do with
[51:10] this battery if I've got ten batteries
[51:12] and only want two batteries I can just
[51:14] get rid of the other eight batteries
[51:16] that's the principle of ownership it's
[51:20] very important principle because that's
[51:25] why you get scriptures like second
[51:27] Timothy 226 but in a great house there
[51:29] are not only vessels of gold and a
[51:30] silver but also I've wood and of earth
[51:33] and some to honor and some to dishonor
[51:36] God saying I want these ones but I don't
[51:38] want those ones and Paul says who are we
[51:43] to revile against God or speak against
[51:45] God so wise you wave you maybe that's
[51:47] why have you done this wavy done that he
[51:49] can do what he wants with the things
[51:50] that he owns he doesn't have to ask us
[51:53] would you mind if I did this with my
[51:55] property he does all things according to
[51:57] the counsel of his own will now that's
[52:00] why also Romans 9 13 he says as it is
[52:02] written Jacob have I loved and Esau have
[52:04] I hated I want this one I don't want
[52:07] that one and whys have to just accept it
[52:11] because that's the way that ownership
[52:13] the first principle of ownership and we
[52:18] don't own ourselves I'll even give you a
[52:21] funny thought you look at you think this
[52:24] is my body the fact of the matter is
[52:28] it's not yours at your parents they lent
[52:30] it to you to dwellin you think about it
[52:33] you didn't even have a body they let you
[52:35] part of the body to live in this body's
[52:37] not even mind that's how frail with the
[52:39] human being is I think God that we serve
[52:42] an eternal powerful God that we can
[52:46] trust them
[52:49] okay now with this idea of ownership God
[52:57] owns all this he owns all this land ok
[53:00] he sees the whole lot just like I might
[53:04] own a lot of batteries but the thing
[53:07] about goddess and I love this this
[53:11] thought here thank God looks at all this
[53:16] natural land and he said you know what
[53:21] the whole lot of land there but you know
[53:23] what he would look all around it all
[53:26] over all the continents and the
[53:29] mountains the dry areas that cold areas
[53:33] the green areas the brown dark areas
[53:37] Baron parched areas and he would have
[53:40] thought I'd say what I want I want that
[53:46] piece there that's what he said Wallace
[53:53] don't want that I want that piece I want
[54:04] that piece that's what he said
[54:11] ok
[54:14] God made Abraham we know the story that
[54:17] he he gave a promise to Abraham he said
[54:20] Abraham I'm going to make a covenant
[54:22] with you there's this piece of land here
[54:25] and I'm going to give it to you because
[54:27] I will actually want that land for
[54:28] myself and I want you there to go and
[54:31] possess and I want that land and that's
[54:34] why we call that a promise land he had a
[54:37] promise that was now a promised land now
[54:43] something happened the moment that God
[54:46] spoke to Abraham and said I'm going to
[54:48] give you that land something happened
[54:51] that very moment that God spoke there to
[54:54] Abraham and that was us God issued now a
[55:00] challenge to the current governance of
[55:02] that land because that land was under
[55:04] governance and it was under occupation
[55:06] he issued a challenge to the present
[55:09] governance of that land saying I'm after
[55:13] you and I'm going to take over that land
[55:16] because there was a governance there
[55:18] that had it under control and there were
[55:21] people there that were occupying it and
[55:22] they were quite happy but the minute
[55:25] that God made a promise to Abraham that
[55:26] same minute had to be I'm issuing a
[55:29] challenge to you and I'm going to come
[55:31] and get it head to be okay this is not
[55:38] part of my sermon but I just loved the
[55:39] scripture here and Psalm 137 verse 1
[55:42] says by the rivers of Babylon where we
[55:44] sat down yea we wept when we remembered
[55:46] Zion we hang our harps upon the Willows
[55:48] and the midst thereof well there they
[55:50] carried us away for the air they that
[55:52] carried us away captive required of us a
[55:54] song and they that wasted us required of
[55:56] us mirror saying sing us one of the
[55:58] songs of Zion how shall we sing the
[56:00] Lord's song in a strange land if I
[56:02] forget yo Jerusalem it my right hand
[56:04] forget her cunning if I do not remember
[56:05] thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of
[56:08] my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above
[56:10] my chief joy there was something more
[56:16] than just a promise it was a deep
[56:20] feeling of something inside these people
[56:23] that that was their land and when they
[56:24] were out of it something in them stirred
[56:27] and that's the anyone that there's a
[56:31] promise over their life when you're out
[56:32] of that is something in you that's
[56:34] desiring it so much because there's a
[56:36] promise there where we sit down we wept
[56:40] when we remembered Zion we remember what
[56:42] that promise was that's more than just a
[56:44] word it's actually makes people act a
[56:46] certain way all the different landing
[56:52] could have chosen all these different
[56:53] regions he just said I want that piece
[56:56] that's my piece all these other
[56:58] countries people keep it I want that
[57:02] piece a promised land okay now we get to
[57:10] the spiritual aspect of it we are land
[57:14] okay all the different people that there
[57:21] are all the different people I want that
[57:25] person I want that land gods made a
[57:30] promise to us I want that land I know
[57:32] there's a lot of other land but I want
[57:35] that land I want that land that's what I
[57:38] want that's the land that I want why
[57:41] don't you take it all I just want that
[57:43] land I just want that one God does what
[57:47] he wants with what he owns I want that
[57:49] one I want that one we are there now
[57:54] promised land now the same thing
[57:58] happened that the moment that promise
[58:01] went forth for us I want that land the
[58:04] same thing happened God issued a
[58:07] challenge to the current governance of
[58:08] this land on after you and the current
[58:12] occupiers up after you I'm after you I'm
[58:17] after that piece of land so you guys
[58:19] enjoy being there well you can because
[58:21] I'm coming after it to get it that's
[58:25] that's
[58:27] yeah that's the same thing that he said
[58:29] that's the promise according estres nice
[58:33] n happen before the foundation of the
[58:34] world that we should be holy and without
[58:35] blame before him and love I'm so glad
[58:39] that God issued that challenge towards
[58:41] the current occupier of this land and
[58:44] you know what you'll be surprised to it
[58:47] actually is we know it's the enemy but
[58:51] there's another funny thought there
[58:53] praise the Lord next one okay now now we
[59:02] get to this point the idea of surrender
[59:05] surrender of land okay I'm going to talk
[59:14] about this one first this is the
[59:16] Japanese in World War two they had ideas
[59:20] to take over the world to take over
[59:22] certain part of the Pacific and for a
[59:25] while there they did quite well but the
[59:28] Allied forces obviously did better and
[59:30] they kept on they fought and they were
[59:32] essentially fighting over who has
[59:34] governance of the Pacific of the land
[59:38] there was a fight for governance in two
[59:40] major powers both wanted governance of
[59:42] this land and they fought and fought and
[59:44] fought for years and no doubt each
[59:47] different army was strategizing every
[59:49] month and every year that went by they
[59:52] were strategizing to to get governance
[59:54] of this land and in the end the Japanese
[1:00:02] didn't have enough strength and them
[1:00:04] either money or armed forces wherever it
[1:00:07] was they eventually ran out of strength
[1:00:09] to continue fighting for governance of
[1:00:12] the land they were worn down year after
[1:00:15] year after year because their whole
[1:00:17] country was at war whereas a country
[1:00:20] like America was at and essentially at
[1:00:22] peace so they could manufacture vehicles
[1:00:25] and tanks and planes and everything and
[1:00:28] just keep shipping these things to the
[1:00:29] Pacific and keep shipping young men
[1:00:31] across because they weren't being
[1:00:32] attacked in their country so they could
[1:00:33] prosper and eventually the Japanese saw
[1:00:38] that their predicament was dire and
[1:00:40] after that
[1:00:42] Americans dropped two nuclear bombs on
[1:00:44] them they just realized we cut we cannot
[1:00:48] continue the fight for governance of
[1:00:49] this land we give up and the deal was
[1:00:56] with the Americans the deal was you the
[1:01:01] American said that the Japanese you must
[1:01:03] give us a full and unconditional
[1:01:05] surrender sign here surrender with no
[1:01:09] strings attached and you seed all your
[1:01:11] governance over to us and that's what
[1:01:16] they did and this one's of signing of
[1:01:17] the paper here this was Japan
[1:01:20] unconditional surrender this was them
[1:01:24] absolutely giving up governance of their
[1:01:27] country to the Allied forces to the
[1:01:30] mainly the Americans now when they did
[1:01:34] that that meant that every agreement
[1:01:37] we've talked about at the start if we
[1:01:39] agreement that that any Japanese man had
[1:01:43] helped with his current government any
[1:01:46] agreement that a that a weapons
[1:01:47] manufacturing company you'd have with
[1:01:49] the government all of that stuff have
[1:01:51] stopped the agreement doesn't stand
[1:01:53] anymore because there's a new governance
[1:01:55] in town the old governance is gone and
[1:01:57] there's a new governance that now calls
[1:01:58] the shots now I'll venture to say that
[1:02:01] there would have been some stubborn
[1:02:02] Japanese men and women and families in
[1:02:04] the air that weren't going to give up
[1:02:06] hey don't we know that now life
[1:02:09] sometimes is some stubborn things but
[1:02:11] the reality is that you don't you no
[1:02:14] longer have governance of this land so
[1:02:15] any agreement you think you had or you
[1:02:17] think you can do it's gone any occupier
[1:02:20] of that land that that thinks
[1:02:21] differently he doesn't have rights
[1:02:24] anymore like what he used to have
[1:02:25] because there's a new governance and the
[1:02:27] land is a new governance now that
[1:02:30] weapons factory may continue to think he
[1:02:32] can make them all just keep making them
[1:02:34] but he's got the whole of the a low
[1:02:36] force now instead of them attacking the
[1:02:38] whole of the Pacific the whole of the
[1:02:39] Ehlo force is going to attack his
[1:02:40] factory and he won't stand he doesn't
[1:02:43] have any chance it's like that in our
[1:02:46] lives to when governance changes in our
[1:02:49] life there's still stubborn things that
[1:02:50] think they can hang on but
[1:02:52] the reality is there's a new governance
[1:02:54] and as Jesus Christ now this is the
[1:03:00] Japanese now bring on the next one I
[1:03:03] just put this in because I this is one
[1:03:07] of the stubborn men I showed this at the
[1:03:11] Bible study this man fought for 29 years
[1:03:14] after World War Two and the Philippines
[1:03:17] he didn't realize the ward stop you
[1:03:19] thought they were still at war so he
[1:03:20] waged his war against the Allied forces
[1:03:22] for another 29 years he wouldn't accept
[1:03:26] that the wall was finished a few people
[1:03:28] meet him and tried to tell him the war's
[1:03:29] over he wouldn't accept that he thought
[1:03:31] you're lying you're trying to deceive me
[1:03:32] you're trying to you know get me from
[1:03:34] giving up the Philippines so in the end
[1:03:37] has um commander had to travel there
[1:03:39] personally and say and issue him orders
[1:03:41] to say you can now stop fighting so you
[1:03:46] fought for 29 years sometimes you get
[1:03:48] stubborn Devils that just think they can
[1:03:51] hang around and keep going but their
[1:03:54] their rights to occupy their rights the
[1:03:57] governor done when Jesus Christ takes
[1:03:59] over your life next one oh okay now I
[1:04:06] want to bring this on just a wee bit to
[1:04:09] try and think about governance okay now
[1:04:13] Ln gets occupied but it also gets
[1:04:16] governed now you just look at the New
[1:04:19] Zealand system we've got governance the
[1:04:20] new occupation and we if we buy a piece
[1:04:24] of property we buy the rights to occupy
[1:04:26] it from the government okay if the
[1:04:28] government thinks you're okay you can
[1:04:30] buy it and occupy now with our spiritual
[1:04:36] end we don't actually own it but because
[1:04:40] we've got free moral agency we govern
[1:04:47] our land okay now people say well the
[1:04:51] devil does well we actually govern our
[1:04:54] land the issue that we have us when
[1:05:00] we're born our governance the only
[1:05:04] governor's that we know
[1:05:05] I held up with us where a carnal fallen
[1:05:10] being okay so so the so the way we
[1:05:14] govern is from that carnal fallen man
[1:05:17] that hates God that's the facts of it
[1:05:21] this carnal man hates goddess entity
[1:05:23] with God it never can come into
[1:05:25] agreement with God it always has to
[1:05:27] fight against God that's our natural
[1:05:29] carnal man and that's what Paul says for
[1:05:32] to be carnally minded is death but to be
[1:05:34] spiritually minded is life and peace
[1:05:36] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:05:38] against God well the carnal governance
[1:05:40] is enmity against God for it is not
[1:05:43] subject to the law of God neither indeed
[1:05:44] can be so then they that are in the
[1:05:46] flesh cannot please God okay so here we
[1:05:48] are we're born with this carnal
[1:05:51] governance now the next thing to do when
[1:05:57] we're like that we set up occupiers in
[1:06:00] our land people come and ask us cannot
[1:06:02] occupy it well because we're fighting
[1:06:05] against God we've got a common enemy
[1:06:06] that fights against God to which is
[1:06:09] Satan and all his demons so they come in
[1:06:11] and they can easily make agreements with
[1:06:13] us I'll have this piece of land here in
[1:06:14] occupied yeah sure I'll have this piece
[1:06:17] yep yep yep so we need all these Devils
[1:06:20] occupy our land because that's all the
[1:06:23] carnal man knows he's not going to say
[1:06:25] to God come and occupy my land he's not
[1:06:29] going to say that because he is enmity
[1:06:30] with God so so the only occupies we end
[1:06:34] up with a devil's that's why you leave a
[1:06:38] little child on their own leave them to
[1:06:41] their own devices they will grow up
[1:06:43] essentially evil without any guidance
[1:06:45] and a man if he doesn't have any
[1:06:47] guidance of life will end up essentially
[1:06:49] evil now we've got we've been tamed in a
[1:06:53] way by the Word of God within our laws
[1:06:54] and things like that but and man isn't
[1:06:56] here at the evil that's why before the
[1:06:57] flood they got to a point where God said
[1:07:00] of the people every thought and as heart
[1:07:02] as evil continually meaning every part
[1:07:05] of his land is just Devils taking up the
[1:07:08] whole thing there is no God in the land
[1:07:10] whatsoever and then the land okay now
[1:07:13] that's and now our carnal will is the
[1:07:16] governor so we've let all these things
[1:07:17] happen
[1:07:19] so that the and this is a funny thought
[1:07:25] but the challenge that God issues when
[1:07:28] he says I want that land I want this
[1:07:30] land who's he issue when he says I'm
[1:07:33] going to come and take it over he's got
[1:07:36] to take over the governance first then
[1:07:38] he can tell the occupiers where to go he
[1:07:39] doesn't just hit it the occupiers that
[1:07:41] he's got to take over the governance now
[1:07:43] who's the governance me my carnal nature
[1:07:46] is governing it so who does God start to
[1:07:50] now i might say fight against what i
[1:07:52] don't mean to destroy us but who does he
[1:07:54] have to battle against me my stubborn
[1:07:57] carnal nature that hates God he's got to
[1:08:02] start to orchestrate things and we
[1:08:04] wonder why sometimes and our life things
[1:08:06] it's time to change they're not as
[1:08:07] easiest what they used to be things are
[1:08:09] happening why God's battling against us
[1:08:13] he starts his war against us carnal
[1:08:16] nature it hates him he says I've got to
[1:08:19] get you out of the way I've got to
[1:08:20] defeat you cuz I want that land I've got
[1:08:26] a I've got to take over governance of
[1:08:28] that land because I want that land so
[1:08:32] God begins this this fight this battle
[1:08:35] against me my carnal nature it hates
[1:08:37] them and he starts orchestrated circum
[1:08:40] says that the things start to get hard
[1:08:41] but we we fight on anyway and we press
[1:08:43] on and we battle but then there comes to
[1:08:48] a point where we're all come down
[1:08:50] different roads but it comes to a point
[1:08:51] where we say it just gets all too much
[1:08:55] and we say I just can't take this
[1:08:56] anymore now a lot of the times depending
[1:09:01] on our nature it might be just by love
[1:09:02] we just think I give up I can't take
[1:09:05] this anymore but however we are God
[1:09:07] knows how to best defeat this enemy and
[1:09:11] it's at a certain point we say lord I
[1:09:14] give up I surrender and i'm the current
[1:09:18] governor of this land and I know I've
[1:09:20] made all these agreements with all these
[1:09:21] occupiers and sold them all this land
[1:09:24] and they're all happy dwelling there but
[1:09:26] the the persistent
[1:09:31] force of love of God that's coming
[1:09:33] against us eventually overwhelms us and
[1:09:35] we give up and we say lord I surrender
[1:09:37] now just like what the Japanese to the
[1:09:40] Americans were there's only one
[1:09:42] agreement that can be made that's a
[1:09:44] unconditional surrender God doesn't say
[1:09:47] if we say look I'll surrender this much
[1:09:49] but I still want to do this okay then
[1:09:52] let's keep battling against it against
[1:09:54] you he'll keep battling until you
[1:09:56] finally say till he has to drop a couple
[1:09:57] of nuclear bombs you finally say look
[1:09:59] that's it we've had enough you keep
[1:10:02] doing it till he say it till you till we
[1:10:04] give up he did the same thing with Paul
[1:10:08] Oh Paul was battling battling battling
[1:10:10] him even God said to and Paul it's hard
[1:10:13] for you to kick against the pricks this
[1:10:17] battle you're waging is hard and then
[1:10:21] Paul Paul gave up all surrendered now
[1:10:26] this is why eventually when we surrender
[1:10:28] we say i cede all control over to the
[1:10:30] new governance and who has that new
[1:10:32] governance as Jesus Christ I i cede all
[1:10:35] control over to the new governance of
[1:10:37] this land and then essentially we become
[1:10:43] under their governance now this is why
[1:10:46] Paul said Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[1:10:48] Christ as I'm not governing this land
[1:10:52] anymore I'm now a prisoner I'm under
[1:10:54] this new governance he's surrendered but
[1:10:58] he agreed to it because he's a we've got
[1:11:00] free moral agency he agreed to it I
[1:11:01] agree to surrender and yet there was a
[1:11:04] force against us that actually wanted
[1:11:06] our land because remember the most
[1:11:08] powerful force will get the land that
[1:11:12] wants it that's the nature of land is a
[1:11:13] fight and the most powerful one God's
[1:11:15] always the most powerful us he will
[1:11:16] always get his own all that the father
[1:11:19] had given me will come every battle that
[1:11:21] I wage or one for the land so now Paul
[1:11:25] becomes a prisoner
[1:11:30] I'll make it through this now you have
[1:11:38] been got the situation now as we move on
[1:11:41] through the process of this land let's
[1:11:45] go back to the natural now we're going
[1:11:53] to start from when the children of
[1:11:55] Israel we're in the land so they crossed
[1:11:57] over Jordan there in the land now
[1:11:58] they've kept they've that it's a type of
[1:12:01] surrender there in there that Holy Ghost
[1:12:02] there in the land now there was there
[1:12:05] are going to be three things that are
[1:12:07] going to hinder this new governance the
[1:12:10] full possession taking full possession
[1:12:11] of the whole land there's going to be
[1:12:12] three things that will hinder it okay
[1:12:14] sorry about the small words I don't
[1:12:16] realize how small it would be but the
[1:12:19] first hang on so the point is you're in
[1:12:23] the land the new governance is coming
[1:12:25] and it wants to take get rid of all the
[1:12:28] current occupiers and make the land
[1:12:31] fruitful because the promise was here is
[1:12:34] this land here you're going to possess
[1:12:36] it plus it's a land flowing with milk
[1:12:38] and honey you're not just going to
[1:12:40] possess it you're going to get a lot of
[1:12:42] benefits from it now when you think
[1:12:44] about milk and honey those are making
[1:12:47] types or components to speak of when you
[1:12:52] talk about land because if you think
[1:12:53] about milk well to have milk you need
[1:12:56] sheep and cows and goats and things like
[1:12:58] that and camels will to have that you
[1:13:00] need pasture so then they have passed
[1:13:02] you need nice not a lot of land so that
[1:13:04] mean comes the milk now to have honey
[1:13:06] you need flowers any vegetables you need
[1:13:09] all those sorts of things to have the
[1:13:10] honey so there might be two small things
[1:13:12] but it shows that if you can get those
[1:13:14] two things out of a bland your land is
[1:13:17] under control and it's bringing forth
[1:13:18] what it should be if you don't get milk
[1:13:20] or honey from a land then you obviously
[1:13:23] your land is covered in bush and scrub
[1:13:24] and it's not producing anything so if
[1:13:27] you get milk and honey so now the
[1:13:28] promise was you'll possess the land but
[1:13:30] it will be flowing with milk and honey
[1:13:31] you'll actually bring forth fruit from
[1:13:32] it okay this there were two things with
[1:13:34] the promise two components to it now the
[1:13:38] first thing that
[1:13:40] would stop things from happening a lack
[1:13:43] of faith in the promise the second thing
[1:13:48] that would stop a full possession of
[1:13:50] getting this would be other inhabitants
[1:13:53] because remember these other people that
[1:13:54] are made the agreement with the old
[1:13:55] government they're all still there they
[1:13:57] haven't gone anywhere they're all still
[1:13:59] there when the when the agreement was
[1:14:03] signed with the Japanese all the
[1:14:04] soldiers were all still on their battle
[1:14:05] fronts they were everywhere they were
[1:14:06] all still there they didn't go away they
[1:14:08] all stayed there and the devil's such a
[1:14:10] stubborn guy that he won't even move
[1:14:12] here just say no I'm staying here you
[1:14:14] got no right to I don't care it make me
[1:14:15] leave that's what he's like they're all
[1:14:18] still there other inhabitants when they
[1:14:20] crossed over into the land all the other
[1:14:22] inhabitants are all still there some of
[1:14:24] them didn't even know the agreement had
[1:14:25] been made but you know what this land is
[1:14:26] now changed government's now the third
[1:14:30] thing is a curse and the land that's a
[1:14:33] very important factor to take note of in
[1:14:34] the natural there's a curse actually in
[1:14:36] the land itself even though it's a
[1:14:38] promised land it was still cursed it was
[1:14:41] still going to just bring forth now
[1:14:43] let's just read this Joshua 1411 says
[1:14:48] this is caleb speaking and this is
[1:14:51] talking about his faith in the promise
[1:14:52] the sources attitude which caused him to
[1:14:54] move forward and conquer his attitude
[1:14:58] was and this is after they've been in
[1:15:00] landed for quite a few got 30 40 years
[1:15:02] he said as as yet I am as strong this
[1:15:05] day as I was in the day that moses sent
[1:15:08] me as my sent me as my strength was then
[1:15:14] even so is my strength now for war both
[1:15:17] to go out and to come in now therefore
[1:15:19] give me this mountain we're of the Lord
[1:15:22] spoke in the days in that day well they
[1:15:26] hurt us and that day had the Amalekites
[1:15:28] thought it and it comes with air and
[1:15:30] that the cities were great and fenced if
[1:15:32] so be the Lord will be with me then I
[1:15:34] shall be able to drive them out as the
[1:15:36] Lord's sorry for not reading that well
[1:15:39] but the attitude was God's made a
[1:15:44] promise and I'm going to go and get it
[1:15:47] he didn't hold back he said
[1:15:50] I can do it because the promise has been
[1:15:52] made so I'm going to press on and go and
[1:15:54] get it that's the only attitude that
[1:15:57] works and Christianity God made the
[1:15:59] promise I'm going to go and I'm going to
[1:16:00] get it it doesn't work if you say well I
[1:16:03] made the promise but I don't know if I
[1:16:04] really can and all that that doesn't
[1:16:06] work Caleb said God made a promise I'm
[1:16:08] going to press on and go and get it okay
[1:16:11] so so for f because if you don't have
[1:16:14] that that's gonna let would have hundred
[1:16:16] the children of Israel from Ashley
[1:16:17] possessing it if they had a lack of
[1:16:18] faith in the promise because if you have
[1:16:20] faith in it you'll then go ahead and act
[1:16:21] on that faith okay you press on that's
[1:16:25] what a crisp that's why we called
[1:16:26] soldiers why because we fight we press
[1:16:28] on my brother it was talking about you
[1:16:30] know we we've had a hard week but we're
[1:16:32] here what do you think we're not going
[1:16:33] to be here no we're here because that's
[1:16:35] how we operate that's what a soldier
[1:16:37] does he presses on now number two other
[1:16:41] inhabitants and number three cursed in
[1:16:42] the land I want to read Exodus 23 29 God
[1:16:46] said to the children of Israel I will
[1:16:48] not drive them out before the in one
[1:16:50] year less the land become desolate and
[1:16:52] the beasts of the field multiply against
[1:16:54] thee by little and little I will drive
[1:16:56] them out from before thee until thou be
[1:16:58] increased and in here at the land so now
[1:17:02] he's talking about these two all
[1:17:03] together right because he's saying if I
[1:17:05] just drive them all out there are still
[1:17:07] less curse in the land that if I take
[1:17:10] out the current occupants the lamb will
[1:17:13] just get over growing the vineyards will
[1:17:15] break down the the animals will all run
[1:17:19] away the plants flowers will all die the
[1:17:21] wild beasts will move on the vines will
[1:17:24] grow everywhere and when you turn up
[1:17:25] there it'll be a mess it'd be worthless
[1:17:27] land because it's not under control he
[1:17:30] had to he had to actually drive the
[1:17:33] inhabitants out as fast as only as fast
[1:17:36] as that the children of Israel could go
[1:17:38] in there and take possession and
[1:17:40] occupation of it to keep it under
[1:17:42] control it's a very important principle
[1:17:45] because all we've got the land well if
[1:17:47] God drove them all out and they stood on
[1:17:49] just the side of Jordan the land would
[1:17:52] have been worthless to them even though
[1:17:53] they had it all now it's possible that a
[1:17:55] Christian sometimes gets to that state
[1:17:56] where he's got the land but it's just
[1:17:57] overrun and worthless to him we don't
[1:17:59] want to get to that state but this is
[1:18:01] very important to our
[1:18:02] spiritual state of land this is a young
[1:18:07] stand that went quite easily yep good
[1:18:08] okay that's a long quote there but I
[1:18:15] want to read it now this is now talking
[1:18:19] about the spiritual promised land and I
[1:18:21] really want to read this quote so just
[1:18:22] be with me this is brother Barron
[1:18:24] talking now from a spiritual perspective
[1:18:25] of possessing that land okay they've
[1:18:29] never found a better way for a baby to
[1:18:31] get water once then to cry for it could
[1:18:34] you give them a balance a junior you're
[1:18:36] only three days old but now when you
[1:18:38] want when you want your bottle raise up
[1:18:40] the spell and ring it see if it works
[1:18:42] that don't work the baby cries for what
[1:18:43] he wants that's God's provided way the
[1:18:46] louder you cried don't whup that the
[1:18:48] little fella he's only following God's
[1:18:50] provide away he wants something that's
[1:18:52] right it's the only way he knows to call
[1:18:54] his mother scream for it cry for that's
[1:18:55] right God recommends this for his
[1:18:57] children God recommends us for his
[1:18:59] believing children he did not
[1:19:01] intellectual speeches not some great
[1:19:03] theology to teach he wants you to cry
[1:19:05] for your needs that's right cry for it
[1:19:06] if you're too stiff and starchy you'll
[1:19:09] never get it if you're ready to lumber
[1:19:11] yourself up a little and cry God will
[1:19:13] give it to you he likes the hairs
[1:19:14] children cry cry your needs to God God
[1:19:17] wants it that's his provided way cry out
[1:19:20] for it that's the way the baby cries
[1:19:22] that's the way he wants you to cry cry
[1:19:24] how long how long does a baby cry until
[1:19:27] he gets satisfied and that's the way the
[1:19:29] believing Christians to do god's child
[1:19:31] if you see that God made the promise
[1:19:33] don't give it up cry out till it's
[1:19:36] answered cry out till you see God
[1:19:39] vindicate his word when God vindicates
[1:19:42] his word and proves its here then you
[1:19:44] don't have to cry no more you gotta walk
[1:19:48] away and thank him for it until you do
[1:19:50] that scream out and you get it I like
[1:19:52] that persistent holding on not a hybrid
[1:19:54] plant not one that has to be babied and
[1:19:56] Peter them packed around Christians are
[1:19:58] real genuine borned articles of God they
[1:20:00] fight for their position and fight till
[1:20:03] he finished on this earth every move of
[1:20:05] it as a fight God told Moses that he'd
[1:20:07] give him the land he told Joshua every
[1:20:09] place the sole of your foot treads that
[1:20:12] I've given you they had to fight for
[1:20:14] every inch of it so do we fight for
[1:20:16] every
[1:20:16] every inch of it it isn't something to
[1:20:18] be babied and pitted and a round like
[1:20:20] that and say well I'll take you over
[1:20:21] there see what you think about it then
[1:20:24] you pass your opinion that's know where
[1:20:26] to come come with a determination come
[1:20:28] that you're going to stay there till
[1:20:30] it's over stay there until God answers
[1:20:32] and vindicates a man that believes in
[1:20:33] God can see the presence of God feel the
[1:20:35] presence of God sense the presence of
[1:20:36] God and know he's here so now he's
[1:20:41] saying when you turn up to this land go
[1:20:45] for it just be a madman almost seriously
[1:20:52] that's the way we're supposed to be good
[1:20:54] at all don't don't sit back and think oh
[1:20:57] no be aggressive when there's a fight
[1:21:00] that takes aggression now I know take
[1:21:02] strategy but at some point it takes
[1:21:04] aggression it takes determination to
[1:21:05] fight and that the full position of the
[1:21:11] land now once you run it receive the
[1:21:12] Holy Ghost full position it will hinder
[1:21:14] us if we don't do that that's one of the
[1:21:17] main things 100 us we don't actually
[1:21:18] have enough determination to go and get
[1:21:19] it we can sit back and just leave it or
[1:21:21] we can and I believe will still be saved
[1:21:23] but that's not what we're called to do
[1:21:25] our captain and said go move forward
[1:21:28] that's what we've been called to do
[1:21:37] ok
[1:21:40] now the second thing that will hold us
[1:21:43] that could hold us back is now these
[1:21:47] Devils strongholds now what they are as
[1:21:51] they are all the agreements and
[1:21:52] everything that we had made before the
[1:21:53] new governance came in and all complexes
[1:21:57] and ideas and thought patterns and
[1:21:58] everything that the devil had put in
[1:21:59] that he'd been established that he'd
[1:22:02] established in the land hey maybe he
[1:22:03] found out that God was after us so
[1:22:05] what's he going to do build the walls
[1:22:07] bigger build them bigger do this do that
[1:22:09] they like me suck their life as much as
[1:22:11] they can because I can see the army
[1:22:12] approaching from the north so these all
[1:22:19] these strongholds of there but they
[1:22:23] don't have any right to be there once
[1:22:25] the new governance comes in they don't
[1:22:27] have any right to stay they don't have
[1:22:30] their only there because they choose to
[1:22:33] be there but they don't have a right to
[1:22:34] stay there they all have to go because
[1:22:36] there's a new governance in place now
[1:22:39] this is an important one here the curse
[1:22:40] and our flesh that we have to recognize
[1:22:43] is that in our flesh if we just get left
[1:22:52] our flesh will start to grow get
[1:22:55] overgrown just like land if you leave
[1:22:57] land this up there's a curse and the
[1:23:00] actual land itself that if you just
[1:23:02] leave it but we'll just get overgrown
[1:23:04] and the only way that you can ever get
[1:23:08] that land under control is not to try
[1:23:10] and teach her or anything but as to
[1:23:11] subdue it see that when you're coming up
[1:23:14] I subdue you have dominion over it
[1:23:17] subdue it that's the only way you can
[1:23:21] ever get that under control this is why
[1:23:23] Paul says but I keep my body under
[1:23:25] subjection lest by any means when I have
[1:23:29] preached others i myself should be cast
[1:23:31] away there is no place in the Bible
[1:23:33] where you can wear it tells us to train
[1:23:35] our flesh the only thing that ever says
[1:23:37] to us as subject subject because with on
[1:23:41] this flesh it's cursed this flesh is
[1:23:43] actually still cursed the land is
[1:23:45] actually still cursed it's still cursed
[1:23:47] so so God actually has to as much as he
[1:23:52] wants to throw out the
[1:23:54] enemies in our life he has to make sure
[1:23:56] that we can actually go and subdue that
[1:23:58] piece of land that we gained as he
[1:24:00] throws it out if he just threw it all
[1:24:02] out and we don't know how to subdue that
[1:24:04] land and and keep it under control it
[1:24:07] will just get over grindr we all be in a
[1:24:08] worse state than we were when we started
[1:24:10] okay so if you if there's make sure you
[1:24:17] recognize what does your flesh I don't
[1:24:19] want to go to church hey that's just
[1:24:22] your flesh subdue it you know subdue it
[1:24:25] keep it under subjection these these
[1:24:27] thoughts that you might think or you
[1:24:30] might get an asst place where you start
[1:24:32] to not focus on the lord as much and you
[1:24:34] start to think these certain ways and
[1:24:35] you'll think you're really bad no
[1:24:37] there's just a few weeds coming up from
[1:24:39] your from your carnal flesh coming up
[1:24:41] don't let the devil condemn you with
[1:24:43] that that's just these weeds coming back
[1:24:44] up just subdue it again so no down
[1:24:47] that's not me you don't that's the old
[1:24:50] government you don't have governance
[1:24:52] here anymore do you remember that you
[1:24:53] were defeated the old governance is gone
[1:24:55] because sometimes it throws Christians
[1:24:58] off you know they or new Christians they
[1:24:59] think it's them it's it's just the old
[1:25:01] governance trying to rise up and in him
[1:25:03] and he's trying to make agreements hey
[1:25:05] if you get if you go to father he'll
[1:25:07] start making these old forming old
[1:25:09] agreements again have you seen that
[1:25:10] backsliders a backslide than their form
[1:25:12] old agreements with all these Devils
[1:25:13] again you know that's what happens but
[1:25:16] always daily surrender your life to the
[1:25:20] governance of the Lord Jesus but this
[1:25:24] this curse in our flesh will never go
[1:25:27] away until either the rapture or death
[1:25:30] so just subdue it we're called to subdue
[1:25:33] it we're called to lay hold on the
[1:25:36] promise and move forward by faith we're
[1:25:39] called to possess the land so believe in
[1:25:43] and face any deal with us and then when
[1:25:46] we take the land just possess it and
[1:25:48] subdue it and in that order Nick what if
[1:25:54] I got okay i'm gonna i'm almost there
[1:25:57] with this one because i don't want to
[1:25:59] leave it like it's all just as hard
[1:26:00] fight slog because the land goes through
[1:26:04] one more two more cycles before we get
[1:26:06] to
[1:26:07] the real promise land that we're after
[1:26:10] now this natural earth that we have that
[1:26:15] we see and it is this curse that's just
[1:26:20] a cursed land but there's two stages
[1:26:27] that this cursed land is going to go
[1:26:28] through before it's an it's perfect
[1:26:33] state again and the first thing is this
[1:26:36] top six inches of soil brother man talks
[1:26:38] about is going to be totally burned or
[1:26:41] maybe more than success it'll go down so
[1:26:43] deep that it will every bit of any
[1:26:46] sinner anything that's in this
[1:26:47] particular globe he's going to just burn
[1:26:50] it burn it right down and then he's
[1:26:52] going to make an new heaven and a new
[1:26:54] earth but he said it's going to be the
[1:26:56] same one because often thought about
[1:26:58] when I get my new body what I look like
[1:27:00] me you know it's a new body so maybe I
[1:27:03] won't look like me you won't recognize
[1:27:04] me well I look at the top here and I
[1:27:06] think well it's going to be the same
[1:27:07] earth it's not a different earth it's
[1:27:09] the same with this earth is going to go
[1:27:12] through a process where the curse of Sun
[1:27:15] that's in it at the moment that we have
[1:27:16] to combat and fight against is
[1:27:18] eventually going to be done away with
[1:27:20] that whole curse of sin God said I curse
[1:27:23] the ground for your sake that curse is
[1:27:25] going to be gone is going to do away
[1:27:27] with that curse and we're going to get a
[1:27:28] new earth sea and that there's plenty of
[1:27:32] scriptures about this is nevertheless we
[1:27:33] according to his promise look for a new
[1:27:35] heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[1:27:36] righteousness I just want to read this
[1:27:38] quote here from brother Brennan masseuse
[1:27:40] there you are that's the word of the
[1:27:41] Lord he promised that it must come and
[1:27:43] now if you notice how this happens it's
[1:27:44] beautiful how God does it the bride goes
[1:27:47] forth with the groom and then after that
[1:27:49] the wicked is burn with unquenchable
[1:27:50] fire and the world has been purified
[1:27:53] reproduces herself everything has to do
[1:27:55] that has to go through a state of
[1:27:57] purification volcanic will break forth
[1:27:59] in this and that great last time the
[1:28:01] world will burst and bleach and go forth
[1:28:03] and all those cesspools of sin and all
[1:28:06] that's upon the earth will be molded
[1:28:07] into nothing it'll burn with such a
[1:28:09] fervent heat that it would be like the
[1:28:11] bleach that sense the color of the ink
[1:28:13] back to its original creation so will
[1:28:16] the fire from God be so hot that'll turn
[1:28:17] every filthy thing back to its
[1:28:19] conditioning
[1:28:20] game when Satan and all sinners burned
[1:28:22] up and everything and then she'll come
[1:28:23] forth as beautiful as she was in the
[1:28:25] Garden of Eden that's right he's talking
[1:28:28] about this natural land that we see
[1:28:29] every better son that's been occupied
[1:28:32] upon an every evil thing it's just going
[1:28:34] to be done away with that whole curse is
[1:28:37] going to be gone and it's going to be a
[1:28:39] new heaven and a new earth and there's
[1:28:41] going to be then life will come forth
[1:28:43] out of it pure life without any curse
[1:28:45] you don't have to worry about weeds
[1:28:46] anymore you're not there to worry about
[1:28:48] wild beasts overtaking everything it's
[1:28:50] not going to be that way it's going to
[1:28:51] be absolutely pure there'll be no not
[1:28:55] one speck of sin that's the process this
[1:28:57] natural land is going through at the
[1:28:58] moment we still have to tame it and
[1:29:00] subdue it and all that but there'll be a
[1:29:01] time when we won't have to it'll be
[1:29:03] absolutely pure and there'll also be a
[1:29:06] holy city I like this one and John saw
[1:29:09] the holy city New Jerusalem coming down
[1:29:11] from God out of heaven prepared as a
[1:29:13] bride adorned for her husband and I
[1:29:15] heard a great voice out of heaven saying
[1:29:17] behold the tabernacle of God is with men
[1:29:18] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:29:20] shall be his people and God himself
[1:29:22] shall be with them and be their God and
[1:29:23] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[1:29:25] eyes and there shall be no more death
[1:29:26] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:29:28] there be any more pain for the former
[1:29:30] former things are passed away and he
[1:29:34] that SAT upon the throne said behold I
[1:29:36] make all things new I like that I make
[1:29:39] all things new this old cursed earth is
[1:29:43] going to be meeting you next one okay
[1:29:48] now we get to my scripture that I read
[1:29:51] at the start this Old Earth is got to go
[1:29:54] through the same process thus this piece
[1:29:57] of land here has to go through the same
[1:29:58] process it's still got this curse on it
[1:30:00] well though we subdue it and everything
[1:30:02] it's still got a curse it's still going
[1:30:05] to go through the same processes that
[1:30:07] the natural earth went through we've got
[1:30:10] to have a new pure eternal body we've
[1:30:12] got to be remade to be new and pure and
[1:30:14] eternal no no molecule of sin anywhere
[1:30:17] now there's two ways that we achieve
[1:30:19] that the way that God achieves it the
[1:30:23] first way is either as by death when we
[1:30:26] die but the second way is what we're
[1:30:30] approaching now is what they call a body
[1:30:32] change a wrap
[1:30:33] a body change and that's why secretly
[1:30:38] says for we know that FA earthly house
[1:30:40] of this tabernacle were dissolved so
[1:30:42] they say we die we have a building of
[1:30:44] God and house not made with hands
[1:30:46] eternal in the heavens for unless we
[1:30:48] groan earnestly desiring to be clothed
[1:30:50] upon with their house which is from
[1:30:52] heaven with our new house a new pure one
[1:30:55] but then he talks about behold I show
[1:30:57] mr. we shall not all sleep but we shall
[1:30:58] all be changed and the moment in the
[1:31:00] twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet
[1:31:01] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[1:31:03] be raised incorruptible and we shall be
[1:31:05] changed for this corruptible but this
[1:31:07] cursed land must put on incorruption and
[1:31:10] this mortal must put on immortality we
[1:31:15] go through this process now that we go
[1:31:18] through this change from Mortal to
[1:31:21] immortal t from corruption to end
[1:31:23] corruption and maybe those hearing my
[1:31:27] voice may go through the if the Lord
[1:31:31] doesn't Terry go through the second one
[1:31:34] which is the rapture which is a body
[1:31:35] change and that that is to get rid of
[1:31:38] the soul do away with this carnal flesh
[1:31:41] last time that's what it's for to do
[1:31:44] away with it purifier so then we get our
[1:31:47] we get our new and new tabernacle and
[1:31:49] then we are new land has got no Kirsten
[1:31:52] and it's just a pure perfect land and
[1:31:54] then we gon dwell in a in the new land
[1:31:57] us we will come back and dwell here but
[1:31:59] it won't have the curse of sin that is
[1:32:01] caught it'll be a new and perfect land I
[1:32:04] read down to here but I want to read the
[1:32:06] last one from first when these 15 verses
[1:32:09] verse 57 but thanks be to God which give
[1:32:13] us giveth us the victory through our
[1:32:15] Lord Jesus Christ he says therefore my
[1:32:19] beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable
[1:32:22] always abounding abounding and the work
[1:32:26] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[1:32:29] your labor is not in vain in the Lord
[1:32:35] i'm looking forward to as much as i
[1:32:37] enjoy a good fight i'm looking forward
[1:32:39] to rest but while we're here it's a
[1:32:43] fight and while we're here we I'm so
[1:32:49] glad that the Lord said that we will be
[1:32:52] one and the COS emeka says no longer I
[1:32:55] that loveth but Christ liveth and me
[1:32:56] it's no longer me that has to try and
[1:32:58] strategize and all that I just
[1:33:00] surrendered his governance and it's and
[1:33:02] when I say my old man when my old man
[1:33:05] said I it was i but when the new man
[1:33:08] says I it's me and Jesus that's the big
[1:33:12] difference and he's the commander in
[1:33:13] chief he's the husband so the husband
[1:33:16] and wife can both say I but the the
[1:33:18] husband says the direction i like it how
[1:33:21] the Lord does that I say I but I know
[1:33:24] it's the Lord it's I surrender to the
[1:33:25] Lord and that says direction and he will
[1:33:28] conquer every enemy but don't be scared
[1:33:36] don't hold back Paul says we're not them
[1:33:41] that drawback to perdition but then that
[1:33:43] press on to the saving of the soul we're
[1:33:45] not we're not ones that just draw back
[1:33:47] in a scared we're not scared we have
[1:33:49] been given promises we read in the Old
[1:33:52] Testament of all the times that God
[1:33:54] undertook and we can't see one place
[1:33:55] where it failed so we have to realize
[1:33:57] how can you fail and a lot of the times
[1:34:00] all the trials we go through adjust to
[1:34:02] for us to learn I won't fail trust me
[1:34:05] trust me press on trust me I won't fail
[1:34:09] praise the Lord let's um let's um stand
[1:34:14] up and we'll sing um let's let's just
[1:34:19] pray as we stand and then we'll sing um
[1:34:21] the old song we were able to go up and
[1:34:23] take the country Heavenly Father was so
[1:34:29] grateful to not today Lord to know that
[1:34:34] we've surrendered our governance over to
[1:34:36] you Lord that the only thing that we
[1:34:40] ever did when we govern things ourselves
[1:34:41] was make a make a mess of our life
[1:34:43] Lawton and
[1:34:46] let any old thing happen in our life and
[1:34:50] Lord our life was full of misery full of
[1:34:52] pain full of heartache full of hurt full
[1:34:55] of confusion full of darkness but Lord
[1:34:59] we're so grateful that you decided that
[1:35:02] you wanted us Lord and that you you in
[1:35:05] spite of us you came down and Lord your
[1:35:11] overtook us by your great love Lord and
[1:35:14] those of us here can say like Paul all
[1:35:16] I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ well

[1:35:21] happy to be serving you were happy to be
[1:35:22] under your governance at such a
[1:35:24] wonderful thing or than to to see you
[1:35:27] just establish our lives Lord into to
[1:35:33] just cut all those old agreements that
[1:35:36] that our old man had made and all those
[1:35:38] Devils just to see you drive out each
[1:35:39] one of them one at a time little by
[1:35:43] little you said your drive to mount Lord
[1:35:44] and to see in our own lives Lord how
[1:35:47] little by little you're driving these
[1:35:49] things out lauda maybe continue to be
[1:35:52] strong and faith as Paul said I've
[1:35:53] fought a good fight I've kept the faith
[1:35:55] may that be our testimony lord afford a
[1:35:59] good fight I've kept the faith Lord we
[1:36:01] know the fight essentially isn't with
[1:36:03] each other or anything it's actually
[1:36:04] with ourselves Lord and the more we
[1:36:07] surrender to you and overcome ourselves

[1:36:17] encouraged may they go from strength to
[1:36:18] strength may may your word always get

[1:36:32] from if it's from you if it's your
