you see all the hands that have been raised you see the needs behind every hand I I pray father you'd meet them Lord according to your riches and glory and Lotus who are about to read your great Eternal Word Lord we just want it to be imparted into our lives Lord change us oh God to match your word Grant it father we love you so much and we thank you Lord for this evening in Jesus Christ's name amen amen so well-known scriptures we know James 4 and 7 and 8 says submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee from you draw night to God and he'll draw night to you cleanse your hearts ye Sinners and purify your I mean sorry cleanse your hands he Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats tonight I want to speak about tapping into the resources of God where brother Braham said that there's untapped resources in God there's parts of his character that have not been really tapped into until it's full well maybe if I could say full potential like like like we can access in this day you know we have an ability this day to to to draw a night to God and we know that you know many people use the scripture say well I'm drawing night to God and they do some human kind of effort to do that but really the reason there's got to be a reason why we want to draw night to God you know we need him to come on the scene like never before you know we need God more than ever today you know we really need him amen every day we needed more than the day before you know we need him in our lives and we need his presence we need his guidance and his counsel and his love and his protection and his hand of Deliverance and so so you know there's a reason why we draw night to God now it's amazing when you think about it that God has built us to to draw night to him you know he wants us to be closer to him that we want to be closer to him you know he wants us right by his side and you know he loves us with an unfailing love and you know he wants us to draw night to him that we can tap into his attributes now brother bam says this about the contest you know there's a contest there's a test of strength and we where we have the um um we have the test strength we used to have the Indians used to put a fire and they would put so many men on this side of the end of the rope and so many on this end and the tug of war the contest of strength would pull the losing party across the fire now we know there's many things that that we could base us upon for a few minutes of contest but I want to speak of these for these minutes quickly upon the greatest contest there is that is between the church and Satan that great test of Satan and we want to speak of the great strength of God in his church amen so he says now this now this great contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven and Satan was kicked out into the Earth and then he become an enemy to God's people and since then he's used all of his strength and his strategy to try and pull God's people across the fires or into his fires and we know that who has the most power God does and God when he gave his power his people the best thing that he could to combat Satan with was his word now because the word is God who's stronger than God so the word is God and the word became our strength God in the church became its strength to pull Satan to his own fires that he has made and the tug goes on now Jesus said in Mark 16 in my name they shall cast out devil so there's a great contest of strength going on and it's the power of God in his church against Satan and his power now as we just read we know who the greatest one is which is God he's more powerful than the devil can ever be now in a tug of war match the strongest one is the anchor on the end many times people think who are pulling they think they're doing the job but it's actually the anchor just standing there with you I can't make them you know can't make them move forward you know and you know our anchor is the Lord Jesus Christ I mean he's the strongest one there ever was you know he can't be pulled amen and when you realize that you know where where the Bible says I don't have the scripture on me it says he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has passed shall not come to the condemnation but has passed from Death unto life now that condemnation Jesus speaking about there in John chapter 5 is the great white Throne judgment so if you hear his words and believeth on him that sent him right you shall not go to the condemnation now that is not just a Baptist give your life to the Lord give your heart to the Lord kind of justification in scripture that's a bright scripture I mean where God Reveals His word to you and you believe it amen God sets you on a course not to the great white Throne judgment amen but to the New Jerusalem Hallelujah sets you on a course into a Rapture amen and and so now if that's the case we cannot be pulled into the devil's fire Hallelujah show going on but if you're real if your name is really on the Lamb's Book of Life you cannot be pulled into that fire it's impossible for you to be pulled in amen maybe others sure but you can't be pulled in I mean so now if you can't be pulled in then there's only one thing you can do pull him in amen so now there's a test of strength going on where we can pull the devil into his fires I mean we can pull him onto his face drag him through the mud Into the Fire amen because God wants to prove his strength in the church amen he doesn't see brother Brown says God hates a powerless religion amen because God is full of Power full of Might full of ability amen and he put that ability because of his life that came into the church that same ability is in you and I tonight amen so we have the privilege of pulling Satan Into the Fire hallelujah amen we have the privilege I mean to make the devil look like a fool that's really the Lord in you that makes the devil look like a fool amen because remember a testimony is that the Lord's doing it's not us we can't boast Amen in any testimony because it's what God has done that matters right so there's a test of strength going on now we are we have an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast which entered in uh into that is within the veil I mean so so we have an anchor so so there's an anchor on our rope which is the Lord Jesus Christ he's the Anchorman he's the main one you know I don't know if you've ever seen like kids doing tug of war there's two adults on the end maybe you know and the kids think they're gonna pull the other team over it's just really the anchor guy pulling it like this right you know it's the same thing with the Lord we think yeah praise the Lord you know we're really doing something that's really God in us just pulling pulling the devil into his fire amen but we have an anchor of the Soul now brother Brown would speak about a lover so you say it'd be like someone flying a kite and then the then the clouds come down and they can't see they can't see where their kite is but because they feel the tug they know the kite's there now the storms of life can come in trouble can come in amen it looks like you're separated from God you don't know what's going on but you still feel that tug I mean you still feel you're anchored somewhere Hallelujah in that anchor I mean that Anchor Holds both sure and steadfast now if something's think it it cannot move I mean when Anything Is Anchored it can't move God makes you immovable you're fixed amen I have an anchor that keeps me whole steadfast and sure when the sea blows roll anchored in the rock that makes me hold grounded safe and sure and the savior's love this anchor when I was out um Yonder beyond the spray one day one day God took this poor Lost Sinner and pulled him through that spray yes sir and brought him over here and anchored me in there put his arms around me and everything else no matter what it is amen my soul looks up to thee see have an anchor steadfast and Shore so no matter what it is if it's peer pressure amen if it's mind battles whatever it is things going on in the world things going on in the family things going within and without doesn't matter what it is amen my soul looks up to thee amen amen Heaven anchor steadfast and sure see we're not called just to drift with the world we don't just have some Dragnet that we're holding on to like a you know there's such a thing that Yachts have when they're when they're deep in the ocean they have a they have a sea anchor but that sea anchor is not fixed to anything on the ground you know something that just drags behind the boat we don't have that kind of an anchor we have something that's anchored to the Rock of Ages himself amen that's where our anchor is so no matter what it is we're not going to drift with the storms we're going to stay steadfast because he's keeping us steadfast Hallelujah it doesn't matter what the rest of the world is doing amen westang steadfast with this word amen and it's worth every every inch of it amen Hallelujah now God has attributes we know we know enem was to be you know and then before the foundation of the world there was attributes to be a father to be a son to be a provider to be a redeemer to be protected to be a God to be a husband to be a comforter to be a counselor you know all those things are in him but now he has to he had to he didn't just want to keep those parts of his or all of his character to himself he wanted to express it to someone and we know that he couldn't express it to the universe he couldn't express it to the animals he couldn't express it to just the planet Earth without human life but he but he but he put a part of himself upon the Earth his children that in order that he could express himself to his son son and daughter there in the Garden of Eden and now we understand that without the fall he could not express his full character as full nature they knew him as Creator they knew him as father they knew him as as you know as their God and all those different things but they never knew him as as uh Redeemer they never knew him as sacrifice they never knew him as a high priest because they didn't need a high priest with because they didn't have any sin they didn't need a redeemer because they were never lost you know that you know they never knew him as Advocate or guide because they were never lost they never needed comforting so there's many parts of his character that he could never express to Adam and Eve before the fall so really all the devil did was actually unleash the full character of God upon human beings amen by bringing sin into the world so really in a way in a strange way this may sound a bit strange you know he did us a favor by bringing sin into the world because you imagine it you could you know Adam Eve you know maybe this is just my little thoughts but you know if you never really need someone you can kind of take them for granted they've always been there you know yeah and literally they've always been there you know talk about just Adam and Eve in the garden yes he's wonderful we love his presence we love him with all our hearts he gives us such a wonderful place to live but but but there's never been a time where where he's really reached down and redeemed us and saved us and you kind of kind of take you know it's really when when crisis comes and someone steps to the Forefront of that crisis and somehow you know navigate through it and comes out the other side you know it's it's in crisis when you appreciate people's character for what they really are amen it's not when everything's just fine and bubbly and happy and things it's when trouble comes in that character can really come out and manifest itself and in those times of great trouble and that character comes out you really appreciate that person amen don't you think so I mean you really appreciate what they're really made of because it's it's in those times I mean what they're really made of comes out Hallelujah I'm not pausing for a um effect I'm just thirsty but you see and then and then so the Lord now because of what the enemy did he could become a redeemer he could become a savior he can become a Healer they were never sick before but then now they'd get sickness amen he would you know you know he'd be their Advocate their high priest he'd be their Defender their Shield their bucker I mean all these great attributes of God you know could now be manifested to Adam and Eve and now it's the same thing so it was in crisis when really God's heart came out yeah just like with the prodigal son when The Prodigal Son came home you know the heart of the father came forth when he was just happy to see his son come home you know the other son had a you know elder brother syndrome didn't understand what it was like to be lost and you know it didn't have the same heart as his father did that was really his real nature coming out it wasn't necessarily how well the farm was looked after and you know the you know the increase to the crops and the you know the you know the herds and all those things that wasn't really who he was that was part of him but that wasn't his core self who's with me tonight remember when is when his son came home Hallelujah his real heart came out so when a crisis came into his life of what's he going to do now sure he was longing day after day for his son that path he walked down to go into the world he has expected him to come back and he had times of prayer where the piece of God just came over me knew he was going to return but then finally it happened so really what's he going to do in that circumstancy yeah because he didn't just stand there and wait for the sun to come grovel his feet he ran to his son amen he ran to the one that was lost and now is found amen hallelujah so it was that time of great crisis really Express what was in the father and now it's the same thing with you and I times of great crisis is when God loves to show himself he loves to show his strength love to show his ability amen and we have we have the uh privilege of tapping into every attribute of God Hallelujah amen we have that praise God Amen you know you look at the Book of Ruth you know there's you know as we read in our opening scripture draw Knights of God and he'll draw a night to you now now there's an initial time of course where God finds you none of us were seeking him doesn't matter if you thought you were you weren't it was him finding you amen it was him going running after you amen and then he found you you gave your life to him but then there's a time now where you can draw night to him now and then so it's initiated it's initiated by us as opposed to him Hallelujah but the reason that all happens is because there's really a deep calling to the deep as brother Ram said like there has to be if there's a deeper if there's a hunger in here for something there's got to be something there to satisfy that hunger right so if there's a longing for salvation there's got to be a savior there before that longing for salvation can never be in a human soul amen so so the whole reason we draw an eye under Hermes because there's a deep calling to the Deep and I'm so thankful that God just doesn't leave us with an unsatisfied longing he never leaves us just with a you know I didn't really get that thing you know he satisfies every longing it may be in a long period of time but in his time he'll do it right amen yeah because remember the fruits of the spirit the patience there is patience with God we're going to have patience with him all right yeah God will answer in his time our schedule is not his schedule but I think 100 of the time that's a good thing as opposed to a bad thing right so so now we have the ability to draw night to God and he'll draw night to us now if you look in the Book of Ruth you know there's the initial time where where where Ruth you know follows follows Naomi you know they leave Moab we know Ruth is a moabite the law says she can't even come into the congregation of Israel but we know that you know if there's always a if there's a hunger to come in there's always a way in you know Grace overshadowed the law and Ruth came in amen just like you and I we had no Covenant with God God made no promise with us but Grace overshadowed that amen and he gave away for the Gentiles to come in aren't you glad for that Hallelujah and so now Ruth you know she you know she says to her mother-in-law because her mother-in-law says look you know there's no point following me to Israel you know are you going to wait for me to have another son I'm going to be you're going to be old he's going to be young how's this all going to work just you know just go back home and we know offer you know embrace your whipped and went home but Ruth said you know your God will be my God your people my people will you die I'll die and so she just made up her mind I'm following them I'm you know I'm following you wherever you go and so there was initial meeting when when Ruth would be in boaz's field and she just found herself in the right right place at the right time as uh you and I just happened uh it seems like coincidence that we just happened to come across the Lord and the right season of life right time and but God orchestrates everything you know and then so so there's that initial meeting and even Boaz says stay in this field don't go to another field you'll stay in my field but then now in order for Redemption to happen that that everything Naomi lost would be restored back to her we know that Ruth had to be married by Nick Kinsman remember there was a law in the in the Old Testament of the law of the Kinsmen Redeemer and that would be that if a family member sold themselves into slavery or went into whatever more that a near Kinsman could could go and redeem that person back to what they fell from but it had to be a person who was who who was who was blood relation they had to be able to do it and willing to do it and we know Boaz met all those qualifications amen he had to be near Kinsman he was he had to be able to do it and he was able to do it he'd be willing and he was willing same thing with our Lord Jesus Christ had to be related to you and I remember Adam was the son of God we are the sons and daughters of the most high God Amen and our new birth shows that it's not our first birth it's our new birth shows that we're her sons and daughters like it says in Galatians because you are Sons you receive the Holy Ghost you don't become a son or daughter of God when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive it because you are Hallelujah I like that don't you I mean so so you know so had to be relation he had to be able to do it and who could who could undo the curse only God as a man could do it remember by one man sin came into the world so man would ever come and undo it amen but we all know we're born in sin shaped iniquity come to World speaking lies doesn't matter you take every prophet of the Bible even Joseph there was one Mark against Joseph he told his father to tell a lie to Pharaoh you know before they win him because it was an Abomination to the Egyptians for anyone who was a Shepherd so Joseph they're coming to the throne room he just says to his dad's you don't don't say you're a Shepherd you know that was the one Mark against his whole life because every man has to fail so not one of us of all human record could actually redeem man back to God had to be one come from Glory One Day become a man to redeem us hallelujah amens who had to be related able to do it and willing to do it and we know that Joy set before our Lord was us redeemed that's why he went to Calvary The Joy set before him endured the cross despising the shame Hallelujah I trust I trust this is all right tonight amen so there came a point in in Ruth's experience where she had to she actually caused or she caused Boaz to become her Kinsmen Redeemer So within him was the attribute of Kinsmen Redeemer there's an attribute of that within him but Ruth actually caused it to be manifested amen tsunomi her father um her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boas of our Kindred with whose maidens thou was behold he went with Bali tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make uh not thyself known unto the man until he hath done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lieth down thou shall Mark the place where he shall lie brother Brown says that's Calvary Mark where he lied lie down there and thou shall go and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he'll tell thee what thou shall do and she said unto all that thou saith unto me I will do we're going to be willing to do all that the word says not just part of it you know this was a kind of a sticky situation too put herself into but she humbled herself to the word of God and she said to her mother-in-law all that you say I'm going to do it not just part of it not the convenient part just all of it amen and then so now and then so Ruth goes down uncovers boaz's feet now this is just jumping down a bit and he says to I have it here right let's actually go to the Bible I don't have this in here properly but I'd like you to read this because I think it's pretty neat I know I've brought it up before but I just want to show you how we can we we have the ability by God's grace to actually cause us attributes to be manifested in our lives amen so we're going to Ruth we'll go to chapter three and then we go down to we go down to verse eight I don't have that here do I no I don't I thought I'd put that in okay so so Ruth 3 and verse 8 maybe you wanna you wanna put that up it says here now and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself Behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered I am Ruth I'm handmade spread therefore thy skirt overline handmade for thou art are near Kinsmen so now here she is she's gone down to the threshing floor and she's actually causing that attribute of kins and Redeemer to come out and be manifested out of Boaz to her amen because she's saying I'm a near Kinsman to you cover you with my skirt so cover my shame cover my old life cover where I came from cover all of my dark past and my widowhood and all those things in the idolatry in my past all those troubles cover who I was and make me someone new and the only one that that she could be made knew was that she would be United with Boaz I mean so because she went down to the threshing floor there and lay at his feet it actually caused him to step forth and manifest that attribute of Kinsmen Redeemer in her life now this is where I want to go do here also he said bring the vow that thou has upon thee and behold and hold it and when she held it he he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the City and when she come to her mother-in-law she said daughter and she told all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of Bali give gave he me for he said go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day amen so this stirred up Boaz he's I've got to do something about this amen here she has come to me is my near Kinsman and I know the state of her family I know her State and it's within me to undo to give her her new identity to change to change her name to change her station from a from a moabite that's not even in the Covenant of God to bring her into the family of Israel by marriage Hallelujah and this is exactly what he did amen so so by her going to him caused him to be that attribute of kins and Redeemer to come out of manifest in his life Hallelujah to me this is an uh immensely powerful where where she has given six measures of Bali because we know that this is the this is the promise actually because the seventh the seventh uh is always a mystery which is Christ so now the seven seal is Christ himself we know there's six Cities of Refuge in the Old Testament the seventh is Christ Jesus would would turn the six water pots from water into wine and he's the seventh hallelujah amen so to me now Boaz is giving her a down payment saying say I'll give you this but you're going to get me soon Hallelujah I like that amen so to me that yo Hallelujah to me to me this just shows Yo God gives us a down payment but we're going to get it all amen hallelujah way to get the whole new Heavens A New Earth New Jerusalem eternity new bodies Hallelujah no more sin no more trouble no more sickness no more being pulled by spirits and all this kind of troubles going on and things and you know we're just going to have glory after Glory but we can have glory after Glory right now amen because we can we can tap into the attributes of God and pull the devil across his fires amen pull him into his own fire Hallelujah but you see now Ruth had to act and so upon the word and so we have to act upon the word amen when Moses Moses had to believe and this is speaking about the burning bush but Moses had to act upon it act upon what God's word said he wanted to see whether that was God or not he said while Moses act upon what I tell you now listen here tonight brother sister if you want to know who God is just act upon what he says here repent everyone you'd be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you'll become a miracle that's his promise that's what he said act on his word and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you unto your children oh that's just for the apostles and then there's a fire off as many as the Lord Our God shall call that's where the promise is too amen so so we have the privilege to act upon his word then he in faith then he fulfills that word now brother bear speaks about when drawing night to God is to think about how lovely he is think about how wonderful he is just fill your thoughts with how good he is and how great he is in your find his anointing start coming to you I mean the atmosphere around you will begin to change amen and that's what God wants to do he wants to he wants to meet with us amen that he can manifest his attributes in our life Hallelujah so it just just keep thinking on them now to me this is powerful this appearing of the Angel fright and the little little virgin that's speaking about Mary she had been taught that the days of Miracles was passed but she had been but she had seen something happen the angel told her said Hail Mary hell means to stop and he had a message for her when that when an angel comes it's got a message for you and the Holy Spirit God's angels here tonight with a message for every believer just keep him on your mind keep thinking about him how lovely he is how sweet he is of his promises if you're sick get this on your mind heals wounded for my transgressions he was bruised from my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with the stripes I was healed keep your mind centered like that something will happen to you all of a sudden there'll be something drawn nigh to you and anointing will come on you and take you out of that chair you'll go draw night unto the Lord and he'll draw night unto you now when you begin to think our lovely it he is it really makes you relaxed hey who's at that experience you'd be all tensed and troubled then you think how great the Lord Jesus is and what he's done for you and what he's doing and his promises and how he's met God of his word he's never lied he's never failed he never backs up on a promise and you know he's there to keep you there to guide you there to calm you down and you know there to watch over you and your children and keep everything okay and you know and then you begin to think about that and it makes you relaxed now when you get into that relaxed State then your spirit is open and God can minister to you you know it's one of the greatest things brother says is just relax and submit yourself to the Holy Spirit and watch what he will do I mean so it's so important in this age full attention don't be tense just be relaxed now that doesn't mean be lacks relaxed and lacks at two very different things I'm not talking about being lacks now I'm talking about relaxing resting in his ability resting in his promises resting in his word it's like when Abraham was um Abraham was um Walking with God and God revealed himself as al-shaddai to him which means which means the almighty God the breasted one I mean like a mother breastfeeds her baby and Abraham has just been told by God just come and nurse off me strength at the promise we manifested so just rest if you see a little baby all squirming and kicking and fussing but as soon as it starts breastfeeding it relaxes it's happy right as a God is saying just nurse off me nurse off my promises and then draw strength from me I'm the strength Giver Hallelujah and then you'll see that yo all the tension will begin to leave no in spite of what's going on you'll be relaxed in the storm you know imagine imagine the Apostle Paul you know the first storm strikes the ship he said to them they shouldn't have left but they left anyway 14 days no no sunshine just storm continuously but then but then he began to pray because he could because because God made a covenant with him because remember the blood of Jesus Christ puts us on speaking terms with him right it puts us in that condition that's why I put that quote there by the front door I like to read that when I walk in I realize I'm in this condition Lord you put me in this condition Lord that you can speak to me and I can speak back to you and it's your blood that puts me in that condition it's not what I think I can do to achieve it it's what his achievement has done that matters amen so now the Apostle Paul could tap into the Lord and and and and tap into his attributes as guide and comforter and counselor and so he began to have a prayer meeting bobbing up and down in a storm but the angel Lord came to him and told him no one's going to perish the boat's gonna sink but everyone's Gonna Save their life you're going to Rome Paul what I told you in the beginning it's going to be fulfilled in your life doesn't matter what's going on you're gonna get there and friends we're not getting a boat to roam we're getting a Rapture to Glory so you're going to realize what God has told you is going to be fulfilled amen doesn't matter what storm comes in Trouble Comes whatever's going on the angel of the Lord has come in this generation to tell you you're my bride you're my queen I'm going to take you to Glory Hallelujah so we can have confidence that's why Paul when he got bitten by the ass bear he just shook it off in the fire he shook it off because subconsciously said no this thing can't harm me I'm going to Rome that was a deadly snake and everyone was watching and saying man he must have been a real sinner you know you know he somehow he survived the storm but now well Karma's got him I don't know what they would say in those days you know just bad cow kamish mama you know what you reap is what you sow yeah yeah one's free anyway you know but because he had because subconsciously it was revealed to me he's going through him that thing didn't bother him and then they thought he's some kind of a god it's amazing public opinion can swing in a moment you know and it's always a big pendulum thing you know I just read the book of Acts the other day and thinking you know Paul just goes preacher somewhere preach as the Lord Jesus people get saved the Holy Ghost fills people and then a riot breaks out these men are come to turn the world upside down you know they come to destroy all these things it's like man just calm down but that's what the devil does he takes it he takes not even a molehill and makes it a mountain of a real big deal same things happened today you know sensationalism all these things against the word of God but you see so if you just keep your mind on him see don't get don't get tense because of your tense you can miss the moving of the spirit of God you can miss God's blessing someone can be right next to you having a glorious time but because you're tense and stress you can miss the whole thing and I think that's why God told us pardon me about a month ago when we had that tongue's interpretation the last thing he said to us is I have not left and you know if you get fixated on this is wrong and this is going on and this tension and trouble in my family whatever more you've been going to think well I don't feel God God must have left that's why to me he said I have not left so it must never be tense just relax you say there's a lot of there's a lot of unknowns let God take care of those quantities let God deal with those things as brother Isaac preached a while ago Jesus has been in your future he's already seen it now it comes back to tell you how it's going to go he leads you into it I mean so I think we can just rest and we can rejoice amen and we can draw not to God you know Cornelius Cornelius spent time in prayer during night to God and it brought eternal life to his household and those who had church with him one man praying loving the Lord he says you know the angel comes and says your prayers and your arms have come up before God now go get Peter he'll teach you the words of eternal life he'll tell you and then he Peter came about a house meeting Peter came at a house meeting and God filled them as as he was preaching the word so I think it drills benefits eh just think on the Lord you say well what Good's that going to do well his his presence come down and change the whole picture I mean some bestsetting sin some trouble in your mind or something that you just can't overcome he just comes down and breaks that thing I think it's good remember because like brother bam says worry has helped no one if we could have every single human being upon the planet from Adam and Eve all the way down down now we ask them the same question did worrying help you at all no would be the answer whatever it's translated from doesn't matter that would be their answer but what about faith and then the Heroes of Faith would say absolutely I subdue kingdoms Queen survives of fire the mothers receive their dead back to life you know would say faith faith made us float above the Judgment Hallelujah Enoch would say faith took me in a Rapture amen yo they would say faith you're delivered me from many enemies Hallelujah so Faith work saying amen so that's why the Apostle Paul would say and be not drunk with wine wherein is in excess but be filled with the spirit Harley speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God in the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God that's why he says speak speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs Hallelujah you're drawing not to God it's not just filling your mind with something for the sake of it no it's actually that God will draw night to you who wants that who wants more of him it's like you just wake up in the morning it's like you're on Sunday night at Camp the whole day you may be working you may be getting shopping maybe looking after kids you may be clean but it's like you're but it's like you're at camp I don't think that's too far-fetched I don't think that's Pie in the Sky kind of a thought we can have that you know brother Brown says that a man can be drunk every day of his life till God takes him home drunk in the spirit that is others try the other one but doesn't really help them too much amen so now we can we can live in such a way that we can live closer to God and tap into his attributes now I put this up on the brothers and sisters I just want to repeat it if we if we'd stay close to God and loved him and just kept living for him and not trying to push things over but just live for God and live a pure holy life and live and pray every day keep yourself refreshed in his presence God will take care of the rest of it he will adopt the people into his own beloved body the church and when the Rapture comes you'll be found without a blemish because you're living in the presence of the king there's the secret friend do you want the secret that's the secret amen just love him and walk on and he'll take care of the rest of it that's a lot to take care of but I hate you do it all you know he's very good at it amen so this is this is so important who's uh praise the Lord I trust you're having a good time I'm enjoying myself amen so God God is God is able but you see now we can we have the privilege of tapping it takes Faith to tap into the attributes of God now you read through the gospels this yo Jesus does you know heal so many people now we know that it took faith in whatever the people did to get what they had need of out of God we know that it's very simple you know we know that the you know the woman with the blood as you touch him of His Garment she got healing the you know the um soldiers and the scribes and Pharisees beat him and hit him and things they got nothing but condemnation right because they did not believe oh well if you had Faith how could you strike our lord Jesus but you see they had unbelief driving their life but she had faith and so because she had a need now she could tap into that he is the he is the Divine healer right he is the source of all healing amen and she got what she had need of now Rahab Rahab only heard of the testimonies of what God did to Egypt but then when the spies went to her she began to repeat back to them what they had lived through so they had lived through all the plagues in Egypt they lived through the past overnight they lived through going the Red Sea they lived through you know fighting the um you know seahon and OG and the amorites and all those things so they lived through the testimony that she was telling them and then but the thing is because she believed that God was coming that way and God was going to take the city but she had faith that she could actually get Redemption salvation out of a God that just seems to be a god of wrath see real faith it doesn't matter what state we're in real Faith always asks there must be Mercy for me in that one Hallelujah because here she was she was she was in Jericho man that place is going to go down it's going to be destroyed everyone's going to be killed but then yeah and and she knew it was going to happen you know if you read that chapter it says that you know this you know the fear of all the the fear of them has become of the Israelites has has come upon all of our soldiers a lot of people that have no heart they have no morale anymore but yet he said but yet she says give me a true token yet you know since I've shown you kindness show kindness to my father's house and give me a true token Hallelujah this is the you know so to me this is astounding that a gentile that's living in a day of judgment could get Mercy kind of speaks of you and I we're living in a day of judgment we're living in pre-tribulation time I don't know if you've realized that amen but but as the tribulation is about to walk in amen Mercy's present amen Mercy steps in as well hallelujah amen as hell has opened itself upon the Earth amen all of Heavens turn loose also amen I'm so thankful for that amen that we can have a true token and we know that that true token is not just a Scarlet court amen it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so we can tap into we can tap into the attributes of God if you need healing you can tap into it if you need Deliverance you can tap into it see everyone is going to experience an attribute of God one day they're going to be judged at the white Throne judgment so everyone's going to experience a part of God's character but we can experience all of his character what do you mean by judge well he received our judgment that down Calvary and a judge doesn't also find guilty he finds not guilty Hallelujah so remember a judge can condemn or pardon and we have been abundantly pardoned by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen the Rahab um I'm the Harlot Rahab when she heard when she hid the spies she was a gentile and outcaster prostitute but she heard she didn't say you bring up Joshua here and let me take a look at him lets me see how tall and how handsome he is how it comes us here how he Grims himself how big is how big of his shoulders she didn't care what he looked like she said I've heard all what God did for you there you are I don't care what Joshua looks like I don't care whether he's got a PhD or an lld or hasn't got nothing I know God is with you I want protection Hallelujah so amen we can do the same thing we're not caught up with the personality of the messenger if I never go to Sabino Canyon in my life I don't mind if I never go to Jeffersonville in my life I don't mind I really don't mind because I'm caught up with the word hey those things would be cool I like to do the tourist thing I like to travel but you know that's not going to make me a believer I don't need to go to the I'd like to see the Tomb in Jerusalem but I don't need to go to believe that he rose because he's met me he found me amen he's alive today Hallelujah so amen so I don't need to know how big tall whatever I just want protection see she tapped into an attribute that none of those other people in Jericho tapped into and because she tapped into that attribute of Deliverance and salvation her family received the benefit of it Hallelujah amen dryas came to a point where everything failed around him his church couldn't help him the doctors couldn't help him but then he began to realize that there was a god of History who had raised from the dead I mean who could raise the dead and he went to find him Hallelujah he went to find him see something stood up in him that Jehovah that I preach about that Jehovah that I read about in the you know you know in the in the Torah that Jehovah that we say is still alive he's still a god of Miracles today I mean I can still meet him like Gideon did or Joshua daughter Moses did or you know Elijah or Elisha or you're the shooting white woman or anyone like that I can I can meet the same God and he realized that this God of history I mean there was a god of History who could raise the dead and he went out to find them and the Bible says that you know we must believe that he is for he that cometh the God must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen so what do you have need of he rewards those that diligently seek Him amen not just a little bit of a you know casual thing on a Sunday but Larry Lord I need you I need an answer Lord You're My Guide you're my shepherd Lord what would you have me do Lord I need counsel Lord I need understanding amen and he's a rewarder of people that diligently seek Him who's had that experience amen whether you've needed you've needed wisdom you've needed something you Lord yeah I've come to a Crossroads in my life the world's pulling me this way you're pulling me this way or you know it seems right to go with the crowd or what should I do and then he comes on the scene because you're seeking him Hallelujah I'm so glad that our God is a rewarder of them to diligently seek him Hallelujah amen and you see now like Rahab Rahab she wanted protection or even Jarius we'll just go back to him amen he found that God of History because that God of history is walking in flesh in his day Hallelujah and even when he heard when he found Jesus there and and and and he hadn't received the news yet that his daughter was dead he thought this is going to be all right Hallelujah but in the messenger Council room's household distressed and said don't trouble the master she's gone but he says no no it's okay isn't it good when you're facing even worse than use and there's still small voices it's gonna be okay I've got this Hallelujah and then he brought not just healing into his house but Resurrection amen so it shows what we what we place in God's hand he multiplies it amen heat that makes it far greater than than what we think will happen like Rahab she didn't just get salvation for herself but for her whole household it wasn't just for her it was for her whole house although it was probably greater than she imagined amen Noah God him and him and his house saved Hallelujah amen so yeah it's it's what we put in his hands you know brother bear likes to dramatize and I like to dramatize too he said that that boy that had that lunch you know Jesus had been preaching you know I've been it's you know it was you know they didn't have food to feed the multitudes and there's a little boy that you know was walking to school one day and he heard a noise and it was the crowd Jesus ministering to the crowd he just decided I'm gonna go see what's going on you know so he gets about school he said well I'm gonna get a whooping anyway I'm late so hey I'm just gonna you know what's the point I must make it count or something and you know and then he finds himself he's carrying a school lunch and then he finds himself in front of one of the disciples because because no doubt that disciples like you know they're getting worried we need to feed the people what are we going to do and then the boy just says look I've got my lunch and then Jesus receives that and then he feeds thousands of people Hallelujah so whatever you put in God's hands he multiplies above more than you even realize what it can do you know maybe the boy would have thought well I can I can share a bit with her maybe a few a few people it didn't just feed a few people it fit a whole bunch of people it fed everyone and there were leftovers you know Jesus believes in leftovers Hallelujah amen sometimes people get so stressed about food and things Jesus believes in leftovers he made leftovers praise God I like that maybe I just like food too much but hey you know we shouldn't be so worried about these things is that okay amen see now that little boy that little lunch he had wasn't very much in his hands but when he let what he had going to Jesus hands it fed thousands and maybe what little faith you say well I wish I had great faith but what little faith you got you've got faith enough to come to church who's got that faith I mean you're all here and those streaming right amen then if you've got that much Faith why don't you just give it over into the hands of Jesus and it'll feed thousands if you there's not much in your hands but once in his hands then it'll do Miracles if you let that Faith get in his hands Hallelujah it'll do more than you realize I'm so limited but put it in his well you think you're living to put it in his hands the become unlimited what God can do Hallelujah amen praise the Lord I'm just gonna I mean you can take this whole thought through the whole Bible the believer tapped into attributes of God that others didn't you know like Jesus would say in Luke chapter four maybe I'll just close with this here um this has got to Luke chapter four and then and then we'll have the musicians and this is this is here in uh Luke 4 and then verse 24 and he said Phil I say unto you no Prophet is accepted in his own country but I tell you the truth many widows are in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months that Great Famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was a liar sent saved unto sarapa a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow you know brother Graham says that that Widow was the same caliber as the prophet that's why the prophet went to her amen and when the word comes your way God's saying you're the same caliber as me not in your Humanity now but that seed on the inside of the inside of you many times we think we're worthless but God says you're worth more than ten thousand worlds you know they found asteroids out there in the cosmos that you know it's full of platinum or whatever precious metals and they want to try and bring it to the Earth and it's and its value is so vast it'll just break the whole Market of things just just just one asteroid it's not even a world it's just an asteroid we're worth far more than those things amen but unto and and many lepers were in Israel in the time of so um Elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed say saving Naaman the Syrian see these ones had the ability to tap into God's provision and healing power remember Naaman Naaman was real upset when he was told to dip in the Jordan but remember it's a deep calling to the Deep and God wants to give it to you more than you want to receive it so he had to Humble himself and he got his healing Hallelujah but God's put an ability it's not in your mind how smart you are what you think you always put a faith in you that you can tap into his attributes just like what who saved here he gave you Faith to tap into attribute of Savior amen who's received the Holy Ghost you know who's experiencing Redemption you're tapping into attributes that other people haven't been able to tap into necessarily it healer a god you go through all of us you know you realize he's your father why is that because he revealed that attribute to you I am your father and we know he's not a father like an Earthly father who's limited and can fail and has a you know but he's a true father anyway that's a whole nother subject but let's have the musicians tonight but you're glad he's given you a faith when you have need you can draw on God you can draw night to him he draws nice to you amen that you can you can tap into his character and amen every Divine promise of God tonight Hallelujah I mean let's um amen I like that song My Hope Is In The Lord let's sing that shall we amen let's um let's stand let's just sing a couple of songs and then we'll hey man let's just love the Lord tonight I mean I stand In Awe within the presence of the Lord amen amen how can you
