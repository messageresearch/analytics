========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] god bless you all this morning welcome to the house of god it's good to be it's good to be here i was um didn't make it to the service on wednesday um but i um i was actually asleep when it started because i was quite sick but i watched it a little ways through and when i was watching i think brother um there was a message on there brother ben was spoke a little bit afterwards and i felt in my heart that i wanted to be there i thought i actually really want to really want to be there like looking at it and thinking i want to be in that place rather than sitting here and um that made me feel a bit like a christian actually [Music] when it's a natural feeling that comes up you think well i felt that i didn't actually work hard to feel it it just went pop there it was you don't have to try and think oh no i should be there because brother branham said you know if we're a real believer we can't wait for those church doors to open yonder and be there you know but it's nice when it just comes up and you think you know the lord's i said to shannon afterwards you know the lord's done something in my life somehow because i that just came up naturally it wasn't it was a thought that was within my heart so i'm glad that the lord is he's like a master builder in our life and he just works in mysterious ways in ways that we can't understand and he works in our life and he's actually doing things all the time it's like if you have a computer you know you see the screen and there might be like three two windows opened up you're doing a little bit of stuff but that computer is always buzzing and there's always a lot of stuff going on things are being updated it's just it's working real hard you can't see it though you just see your little screen whatever app you've got open or something but and you don't know what it's doing in the background and that's what it's like with the lord you know when we commit our life to the lord he's faithful he's always working changing us and doing little things all the time and we've got no idea what's going on but he's just doing it good and then until one day you have that thought pop up and you think well where'd that come from that was just the lord he's been working somewhere and changing me from glory to glory he's changing me let some stand this morning let's actually sing that song it's not on the list but i want to do that one from glory to glory he's changing me his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of god shown to the world

me one more time lord this is not him that falls and it gets back up hallelujah he deserves all the glory amen praise the lord amen thank you musicians thank you brother isaac amen morning everyone god bless you praise the lord amen let's go straight into the scripture today we're going to go to matthew 27. and um good to have everyone here sister kay god bless you god bless you good to have you here amen great to have everyone else as well god bless you um so in matthew 27 and we are going to verse 27. oh sorry we're going to read from uh yeah we'll read from verse 27. then the soldiers of the governor took jesus out into the common hall and gathered under him the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe and when they platted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews and they spit upon him and they took the reed and smote him on the head and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off of him and put on his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name and they compelled him to bear his cross and when they were coming to a place called golgotha there is to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingle with gall and when he had tasted thereof and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that they that might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there and they sit over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews and then there were two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and one on the left amen and we're going to go to nehemiah and read from nehemiah 8 and verse 10 just just one this may seem a bit uh we'll just see how it ties together um nehemiah 8 and 10. i just want to take the last part of this first but we'll just read the whole whole whole scripture here near my 8 and 10. this is nehemiah speaking to the people of israel after they had read the law to them and he says here then he said unto them go your way eat the fat drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our lord neither be sorrow neither be sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer amen let's just come before the lord this morning together gracious lord jesus lord truly we have come to give you all the glory lord you are alpha and omega you're the beginning in the end you are the almighty not just the mighty one you are the almighty you're the creator of heavens and earth your supreme deity there's none besides the oh god there's not three in one lord you are all in all lord we want to praise your mighty name dear god we thank you we can gather today and lord we know as lord many times lord we feel very insufficient to be here lord stand here and open the pages of your word because we know lord if you do not come and make your word live lord then we're just going through a religious motion and that's not why we're here lord you see our hearts desires to be in your presence our god too lord to be changed lord jesus renewed oh god be renewed in the spirit of our mind and go from glory to glory and lord we want to pray your word would wash us today oh god may you have absolute control over every life here lord jesus mine as well lord take the service under your divine hand oh god because you deserve all the glory we give you all the glory honor and praise we give you our lives father we also want to remember those who couldn't be here today who are sick and body lord we thank you you are mindful of them so may be their portion we especially want to remember brother andy lord who is ministering your word oh god brother andrews father up in auckland lord i pray you'd anoint him lord may you fill his mouth with your word oh god father may you speak to hearts lord jesus transform lives lord may you father may signs follow the word this morning lord the supernatural way for your glory up there lord meet your children's needs and may be very present here as well father we commit our lives into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning i want to um take a bit of a thought you know brother brown he makes uh you know i was i was reading through the message that day on calvary and brother brown makes some incredible statements in there if you haven't listened to that message recently go listen to it again you know we read here you know we have joy unspeakable full of glory you know there's a reality to the christian walk it's not all on our mind it's not just a mental illusion i mean but there's a reality of having a real joy of the lord you know there's a reality of having a peace that passes all understanding you know this is a real gospel we believe you know this message is is the true and living gospel it's not some man's idea it's not some culture that we adapt to but it's god and flesh amen that you know that the lord we want to take his word and come and live in our lives now we serve the true and living god now i know this is probably not foreign to us we shouldn't be shocked by those kind of statements but you know our god meets every need you know he's here he's here in this end time to gather his elect he's here to fight our battles amen he's here amen to redeem to restore to renew our god he's here to keep us in our first love amen he is he is determined that he'll have a bride that does not become cold lukewarm formal and powerless amy but she will be the final voice of the final age where god will take a people and speak his word through them i mean it will not be their own thoughts their own ideas it will be god expressed i mean his word expressed amen because we believe amen that we have been restored to the gospel of saint paul i mean so we've been restored to a bible gospel to a bible doctrine to a bible christianity to a bible holy ghost i mean not another spirit but the spirit of the lord jesus christ now i love it where the lord he hears our cries and there's one scripture that um that that that blessed me uh this week was in in exodus where where the lord speaks to moses he says i've come down i've heard the cries of he says and the lord said unto him i've been i have surely seen the affliction of my people which in egypt and have heard their cry by the reason of their task masters for i know their sorrows so he says i've heard their cry and i say he's he's heard outcry he hears our cries i mean for the reason the things that afflict us and he knows our sorrows he's not unmindful of what goes on in our lives amen he says i've heard their cry and this incredible thing when god hears our prayer hallelujah amen now we're just going to have a smorgasbord today but i trust that there'll be a pattern through this somewhere but you know i just want to continue on from last week where where brother brown makes a statement he says now remember this the church christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of acts right so remember the book of acts was the acts of the holy ghost and the apostles it wasn't the acts of human people it was the acts of the holy ghost in them that did those things but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless we know lukewarm means and webster tells us to lack conviction right so it'll make us it'll try and make us lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works which are the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army so that being an invincible army is unconquerable you cannot be you cannot be defeated in the in the campaign you may lose a battle here and there but you'll win the war hallelujah so she'll be in a a people that cannot be conquered now we live you know it's very important that we say what the spirit says now after every letter to every church age it says to him that have an ear hath here let him hear what the spirit says into the church but it's very important that we speak what the spirit says right it's it's absolutely vital we do not speak what another spirit says because remember a a word is a thought expressed and a thought comes from an inspiration right and either comes from heaven or from hell there's two sources of inspiration there's not a whole bunch of smorgasbord this too right so so the words we speak they're inspired from two places and now if we tell ourselves there's nothing to this it's a whole bunch of emotional work up that's why people look at these they say it's just emotion these people just get a bit excited there's no reality to it it's just a mental workup that's a lie of the devil i mean there's a reality to this i mean there's a real joy a real peace a real shout a real dance i mean that the that the lord gives because of revelation hallelujah so now he'll try and always so the devil will try and tell us things and he wants us to speak his thoughts amen but so but we shouldn't speak what he says we should speak what the spirit has said to us amen so we want to we are called to hear what the holy ghost is saying and speak that it's very important we speak what the word says about you you don't speak what the devil says about you if you look at the bible it's full of a whole bunch of nobodies you know the the the outwash the out and out not the up-and-ups it was the it was the unlikelies that became the heroes of faith i mean david was such an unlikely his father didn't pick him to come before samuel but his other brothers were picked but that was god's king right there hallelujah you know you take moses a runaway prophet there the backs are the dares that he thought he was he had gone too far gone too long but god had not changed his mind about him amen the woman at the well was the unlikely hallelujah amen she wasn't one of the you know whatever people in society she was she was an outcast of society but god said no that's one of my seed and i've got to go find her hallelujah peter j peter james and john they weren't in the in the inner circle of the sanhedrin in the religious world they were fishermen but yet one was ordained to have the keys to the kingdom hallelujah so god uses the unlikely now this word joy or rather let's go here first so we need to speak what the spirit says to the church it's very and and and the spirit always speaks the word of god it's not adding or taking away from the word it is the word right the spirit of god will always direct us into the scripture won't take us out of the scripture it'll take us into the scripture that's why this message to me is the holy ghost speaking because it takes us back into the scripture where does it take us back into scriptural baptism in the name of lord jesus christ scriptural repentance a scriptural new birth a scripture way to dress and act and you know conduct ourselves and our families in a church in society it takes us back into that amen amen so he says here he will be definitely this is satan he'll be definitely thought to today as when christ will stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them so there is a there is a unconquerable force in revelation it cannot be conquered i mean it could not be conquered when god came down to moses and said i've heard the cry of my people and i've come down to deliver them i'm sending you to do the job moses could not be conquered when that revelation anchored into his soul that this is my job description i'm going to do what god has told me to do and god's gonna back me up it's not me fighting the battle but god's come down to fight the battle for me he wasn't defeated he wasn't defeated in the palace he wasn't defeated when they crossed the red sea he wasn't defeated at sinai any trouble that came in he was he wasn't defeated why because he's walking by that revelation i mean the apostle paul when he met god on the road to damascus i mean none of none of the churches or or religious spirits around her culture could conquer him doesn't matter if he was in prison he didn't quit he praised god didn't matter if he was shipwrecked or got bitten by the adder or whatever it was beaten you know had to run or whatever you know things that happened to him nothing conquered that revelation and a soul i mean because he was committed i met god i mean when he stood before king agrippa he was in physical change but physical chains aren't the problem it's spiritual chains of unbelief that's the problem he even said to king agrippa i wish you were like me except for these bonds i mean so who was really the prisoner it wasn't paul i mean it was king of gripper and all those all those people who thought they were something but they had nothing because they didn't have christ they were lost and they should have really said paul i want one you have be merciful to me so nothing stopped him because revelation prevailed even even when they said we're going to cut off your head in the morning boy sharpening the axe right now he said death death where's your sting grave where's your victory thanks be to god that gives me the victory amen he wasn't he you know he didn't shrink back he said well maybe my purpose is done i've i've run a good race i've fought a good fight i've kept the faith and there's a crown of life awaiting me and not only just me but all those that love his glorious appearing hallelujah now where nehemiah said about joy you know this word joy if you look into it in the hebrew it means a strength it means a fortified place it means a defense so the joy of the lord is your defense the joy the lord is your stronghold the joy of the lord is your fortress or your rocks it's more than just a happiness oh i'm happy he's there for i'm strong no no the joy of the lord is your defense right so the joy of the lord that comes into your soul i'm not talking about a temporal joy one day you're happy next day you're sad i'm not talking about a human joy i'm talking about the joy of the lord when he comes in when he comes in when you meet him there's a defense in that because the devil comes along and to me it's like the shield of faith that's the revelation that that quenches the fiery darts of the devil i mean when he tries to fire those fiery darts in your mind you'll never overcome you're never going to get the victory the word is not true for you you know god doesn't move that way anymore i defy that kind of idea oh we're in the bright age we don't need the gifts anymore i defy that kind of idea you know god always adds he never takes away hallelujah he added from justification he added sanctification then he added the gifts of the holy ghost and he added himself coming and dwelling in the church i mean that's an addition amen so we are justified by faith are we not we're still sanctified are we not he didn't take that away i mean we still have the gifts do we not amen do we have the holy ghost yes we have so he just adds he doesn't take away so in the bright ages all that god is now poured into the church not just in measure but in fullness and that is our portion in this hour we don't just have a you know we're not here just to sit and just absorb a lecture or some teaching this is not a place for intellectual speech if you want insulin if you want intellectual speech go to a university summer you'll hear it but this is not a place or some formal morgue this is not a place of an intellectual speech this is a place where god comes down and he meets us and we can let off the pressure in his presence we can praise him because why because of revelation we can shout because of revelation we can praise him not because of emotional excitement because oh that person is doing it so i'll do it no it's got to be personal to you hallelujah so the joy of the lord is our defense holy where that gloomy coldness comes around you of of of unbelief and the devil tries to say well you just got to mature you know you know one thing that makes me sick people say just enjoy your zeal because it'll come to an end i hate that kind of talk i think i think just get a whole bunch of gasoline and just pour on the fire you know just keep enjoying your walk it'll get better it'll get greater we'll get more just yo but people seem to think when you're coming on fire then you just call off and sit down no no this is not what this is the apostle paul never called off and sat down he just became a brighter burning flame hallelujah he was in a prison and god poured in you think about yeah what i love about john the revelator he was not in some nice church office when he received the book of revelation he's on the isle of patmos which was a prison colony it wasn't a nice fancy island he didn't he wasn't sitting on a beach in the aegean sea having a good time he was in prison but yet the lord poured into him over a couple of years i think it was i mean the book of revelation he says i was in the spirit on the lord's day there he was in prison he says no now i'm in the spirit of the lord i was transported forward in time i had to see to the very end of all things amen wouldn't have that changed his life highly i saw the lamb step forth what did you see today john i heard you shouted in your cell what was going on oh boy i was weeping but then i started shouting why because i saw the lamb i saw my lamb i leaned on his bosom upon the earth i saw him do many mighty things i saw him i mean when he resurrected but i saw him in heaven he stepped forth to claim us you and i the title thee that adam lost amen and all of heaven and earth and under earth heard me shout glory and blessing be unto the lamb why could he do that because of revelation anchored into his soul hallelujah amen you know paul was so moved by he says i knew a man that went to the third heaven he speak of himself but he was so gripped by that hallelujah it was so real to him holy and then we have the prophet on this day tell us he went beyond the curtain of time he says i saw you all there now many people thought he was just looking at the people in the building and sure some of them were there i mean but i believe he's looking all those who came and met jesus christ in this age as you and i so i saw you over there we were young that was past 90 when he was late when she was led to the lord but she was a young beautiful woman again hallelujah you know and and what is it really you think when when the holy ghost comes into someone's life that's a bit of heaven if i can put it that way coming and down it's a down payment that you have a reservation at the wedding supper feast right it's god telling you you actually have an invitation no one can make can take that invitation from you but you actually have it it's actually in your possession hallelujah and actually you already had the you know in a way it's like it's like the rsvp you're saying because you because you're built to have it you know god is not wondering you know he doesn't just have a whole bunch of invitations and throw it out like someone's standing on the street trying to give out something you know he knows who's going to end up there and that's why the word came your way because he knew you'd end up there hey we should be happy about this i mean he knew you would end up there in spite of your humanity and your trouble and your struggles and your ups and downs and you know all those things chemical imbalances whatever's going on i mean he looked beyond those things because those things won't get you to heaven remember we are not going in a rapture because we're in some state of nirvana where troubles don't bother us anymore and hardship doesn't bother us and and there's no trials that is not a rapture ready state a rapture really status when you repent be baptized name the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost where god brings a birth to you amen he comes and dwells new seals you to the day of your redemption that traps you're ready oh but i've just started my walk you don't worry about that you just keep walking you just keep walking amen there would have been some babies just before they crossed jordan there would have been some babies born before they crossed jordan amen so they just brand new on the walk but they they weren't 40 years in the wilderness like caleb and joshua but they were born in a season they crossed out into the land hallelujah same thing with you and i you know i think i said about what daniel's dedication he turned up just to leave you know you know because we're at the end of all things you know what i mean but that's how i feel babies born believing they're a believer so why you just turned up to leave hallelujah because they might not become fully born i mean i mean i mean fully grown you'll follow me amen so the joy of the lord is our fortified place it is our hiding place a mighty fortress martin luther said is our god hallelujah so the joy of the lord is our fortress that we can run into when the enemy comes against us battles us in our mind we have a place to run into amen what is that joy you know brother makes a statement and maybe i'll just read it but he he says in that message that day on calvary he said what did calvary do to you not for not just for you you know everyone needs a day on calvary everyone needs a true down calvary not just saying a sinner's prayer not just i'd say repenting a little bit but everyone needs a day on calvary where they go and die at calvary where they go up the hill hallelujah and they literally die to themselves and to everything you know what i love about someone who's had a dark calvary the devil dies there too that thing that once afflicted amen stays there nailed to the cross you can't have a darp in calvary and walk on in victory in the devil's still on your back the things you take there should stay there hallelujah i believe that i believe there's a real deliverance this is not seven steps to coping with your problems this is a transformation center there's not seven steps to living with your devil i just negotiate with him you'll get peace no there is no peace for him and we're not here to give him peace we're here to give him trouble we're here to give him a heart attack we're here to stress him out we're here to bother him hallelujah you know the other devil gets bothered when he is cast out he gets angry we know the devil gets angry when he is cast out and out of heaven in revelations 12 says he has great wrath because he knows he has a short time so he has a bad day he's going to have a real bad day he's having bad days right now but you know we actually had a tormentum you know i think i've said this before but you know we are the devil's devil i said that in cape town they kind of looked at me like this but you know a devil means a tormentor right we know what devil means is tormentor so we're here to torment the devil so we're the devil's devil why why we're talking to him because we're not willing to give him us he can't own us he can't you know we never sure it says in the book of ephesians that we once walked according to the prince of the power of the year the spirit of now working the disa spirit i mean the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so one time we walked and we were under his rulership and we could have been religious doesn't matter religious not religious whatever but we were under his influence but god rich and mercy came one day amen and and and cast the devil out of our life that we're no longer under the devil's leadership anymore but under god's leadership we're under the leadership of the word so now that makes the devil mad because he lost the sinner that he thought he had and he doesn't and and he's like a bully he's not willing to just let something go he wants to take it back but then that's why he comes against you again but then because the lord has got a hold of you he's enthroned in your heart there's nothing in you that wants his his shiny stuff hallelujah so that makes the devil mad because he's a bully so now it torments him he says how on earth did these people that i once made do all kinds of stuff and they were my little puppets on my strings how on earth did they come to a place where now they don't want what i have and i've tried to give them the best look i've been spending six thousand years making this civilization this is the best i have this took a lot of effort to build this you know this this world kingdom but now they don't want it that torments him because he doesn't have a he doesn't have an answer to the problem right but we have the answer to the devil's question brother brown says which is the lord jesus christ himself hallelujah you know so we torment the devil we give them sleepless nights this should make someone happy you mean that you mean i you know i bother satan absolutely when you get when you get down on your knees to pray the kingdom of hell shakes so you caused a whole bunch of earthquakes to go on down and helm and all the shock absorbers in the world can't stop that shaking hallelujah amen so the joy of the lord is our strength amen now jesus came to do a job it says here in hebrews chapter 2 he says but we see jesus who has made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth upon me and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he's not ashamed to call them brethren amen so we've been cleansed by the blood he caught he's not ashamed to call you brethren he's not he's not ashamed of you he's proud of you we are his victory i mean saying i will declare thy name until my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i'll i will put my trust in him this is this is verse 13 of hebrews 2 and again behold i am the children which god hath given me for as much sin as the children i partake as a flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death for all this lifetime subject to bondage so this was the purpose cheat now make this real personal don't just make it some vague worldwide thing and yeah he took you know he destroyed the power of death and no no he did that in your life he did that personally for you i mean so when when you had a reel that down calvary now when i speak about that down calvary i mean a real birth right not just being justified not just it's good you've got to start your journey but when you really meet god that's what i'm talking about that's a reel down calvary where your birth and he comes and he fills you with the holy ghost right so now now if if god has come down into our lives he's actually destroyed the power of death because real death is separation from god eternal separation right that's real death not i'm not talking about this thing dying i'm talking about eternal separation from god that's real death right so now he came into our lives that he might destroy the power of death that is the devil so he might destroy the power of death in you hallelujah this is what you know this should be a joy to us i can't die i can't die hey this thing can expire i just move house and it's an upgrade too so it's a good you know that's why i think the apostle paul said yo too delivers christ but to die is gain right so because he had a whole new body which is an upgrade to this body can't get sick can't get tired can't get weak can't have trouble can ever grow old hallelujah hallelujah so now and deliver them who through the who through fear of death for all their lifetime subject to bondage so what does he do he delivers us from the fear of death hallelujah who's not afraid to die why because we know should should this heart stop beating that there's someone there to actually carry me across the chasm there's a lifeboat brother i'm saying send out the lifeboat when he says when i come to the edge of the end of my life's journey i'm going to cross river jordan he said i'm going to take the helmet off and the sword down i'm going to call out for the lifeboat of of the lord to come and the lifeboat will come and carry me across hallelujah that's more than poetry that should be a reality to you and i that i'm not afraid to die death brother ron spencer said many years ago is just a travel bus that gets us to where we want to go that should give us a joy isn't that a you know shouldn't that be a defense because the devil says no no you're guilty but then the blood says you're not guilty you know he says no you can't go to heaven because um you know you have to be sinless to go to heaven and the blood says no i've made them sinless holy i've actually cleansed them i mean they're thoroughly been pushed to their sin i mean they've been washed thoroughly there's no you know it's not behind the air that's still dirty you're under a little toe there's a bit of dirt no no thoroughly cleansed hallelujah amen that now these so now there's a people upon the earth that are not afraid to die because everyone who's afraid to die is actually subject to the bondage of the fear of death that's why people try to extend their lives they try and do all kinds of things go on diets whatever move different you know climates and so on and eat certain ways nothing wrong with all those things but you know but people live in such a fear because they're trying to extend their life just a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more but those who are now liberated from the fear of death we're a liberated people aren't we remember it's not what you have done it's what he has done that matters so don't just have in your mind well i've been good enough for long enough and done this no it's the blood and only the blood right it's only the blood of jesus christ we're relying in the prophet said i'm i would hate to try and get to heaven on my preaching i tried to i'd hate to try and get to heaven on my miracles any supernatural down in my life i'd hate to try and get to heaven on that all i'm relying on to get to heaven is the blood of jesus christ amen that's how we should be so we have been liberated from the fear of death amen hallelujah now jesus would say in john 5 because he speaks of joy as well but the joy of the lord is not human joy it's not your joy there's a human joy and there's a joy the lord there's two joys right now he would begin to speak in john 15 about i am the vine and ye are the branches he that abideth for me and i on him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing so you know we know that as the vine brother brown says if that vine ever puts forth another branch it will write a book of acts behind it so now when the holy ghost comes along and births you into the kingdom what's that that's the vine putting forth another branch hallelujah and the life that's in the branch i mean in the vine goes into the branch which is you and i and brings forth fruit so it's not you and i trying to manufacture fruit it's actually god making the fruit and you and i of love joy meekness temperance faith and godliness and all those things right he says he says if you abide if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch as withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit and so so shall ye be my disciples as the father has loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love if you love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love now notice this these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you right you're saying i'm the vine you're the branch right you're saying now now you're abiding if you abide in me and my words abide in you now for his words to abide in us that is not our mental recollection or saving his word into our human brain into our human spirit right now it's he himself the logos the word himself coming and dwelling in your soul that's the word that's how we abide in christ is when he himself comes and dwells him by the baptism of the holy ghost amen so that's how the word abides in you it's not by your memory of it it's good to remember the scripture it's real helpful amen you know it's good to remember quotes and scriptures it's good to absorb those things and you know but but that is not what he's saying by if my words abide in you you know i think it's the jehovah's witness they um you know they believe that if they forget jehovah they're not saved anymore yeah if they get alzheimer's they don't have salvation anymore because they forget jehovah this is not what it means by the word abiding in you right because your mind can go your spirit can go but if your soul is sealed and you can't lose that salvation rights is not our mental ability to to to remember the word amen but it's if his word abides in your soul then ask what you will and it shall be done unto you now to ask what we will it's really it's really if our will has surrendered to god then our prayers will not be selfish prayers our prayers will be according to his will you know many people they you know you know they become believers and it becomes a deed of the of the message culture and they look and this deed is they look at certain things around in life and they say am i allowed this or am i not allowed this and it becomes an un uh unpersonal detached walk with god because they're looking at a list of do's and don'ts and i think can i am i allowed this and then and then they look at what other people do and they kind of gauge it well they do it and they do it's therefore i can do it or they don't do it so i can't do it or what will these people think so i better not do it all these people think this so i better do this and it becomes a list of do's and don'ts that is not walking with god that's actually just keeping a list of human-made things it actually should be lord is this thing pleasing to you will this what i'm about to do see watch speak whatever it may be will it bring me closer to you or will it take me further away from you will it grieve your spirit or will you welcome you into my presence that's how it should be right oh am i allowed to do this now we're talking to the girls about this you know are we allowed when am i allowed to phone and all these different things you know it's not no that's a that you know that's by the buy but you bring that into walking with the lord or is this allowed can i you know no it should be lord is this pleasing to you what what's what's not you know now the word opinion is the wrong thing to say about the word but you know what's your opinion how do you feel about this what do you what is your mind if i put it there what is your mind on this thing can i watch it again the scripture says all things do in the name of lord jesus christ so we go on youtube we go on tick-tock i pray we never go on those things you know we go on whatever social media places name there can you do that in the name of the lord can you talk about other people like you do in the name of the lord can you think about other people how you think in the name of the lord right oh i hate brother isaac i can't do that i don't i can say that because he's my buddy but you know i can't say that or i can't say he's a horrible person and say in the name of the lord jesus christ i say this no because that's not what god thinks about brother isaac brother isaacs is the son of god and that's how god sees him he's redeemed washing the blood you know he he's going in a rapture i believe and that's what that's how god sees him so that's how god sees him i should speak about him that way are you following me amen we can't just you know run people down all these things no can you do it in the name of the lord can you watch that you know there's so many messages and and and different films and music and things oh it's such a nice story no but what is it what's the underlying current of something you know we were told we went out and saw friends the other night now telling us about you know the movie frozen two a frozen one it's such a nice story but in there is as is communing with the dead as witchcraft all these different things but it's such a nice story no but what is the underlying thing that's in it you know and can i watch what witchcraft name lord jesus christ well that's a no should be you know i hope it's a i don't know it shouldn't be a well i'm not your loading no it should be a no it should be a definite note here oh but we can't have any fun no no walking with the lord is the greatest fun it is the most satisfying portion it is the best thing to know the lord jesus christ i mean to actually have a joy that cannot be extinguished and to have a peace that passes all understanding amen we can be looking at the worst trial in our lives and shout and praise in the storm hardly know that our god's got our back amen to know that yo you just think about i i often think what is it like around when we see him you know it says in the book of revelation if i can find it maybe if i but it says those who are sealed in their forehead we'll see them face to face those that have the seal of god in their forehead will see him face to face hallelujah can i be happy for a bit i'm going to be happy for it that's me that scripture's talking about me i've been sealed by the spirit of god i mean by the seal of god i'm gonna see him face to face and i remember when i was quite young in my christian walk i thought i'd miserably failed in something you know the devil twisted around my mind where the scripture says that there's no no more uh blood or no more sacrifice for sin if you sin willfully so the devil twisted in my mind it's basically god says don't do that and you do it there's no more blood for you any and and my heart fell like a lead balloon that's how i felt i felt i'm done but then i remember the story that brother brown told about billy paul when he was making his decision when he was young is he gonna go keep smoking drinking going to the world or what and brother braham told him when he was standing by i think the garage and he put his arms out like this and his shadow made like a cross on the on the garage wall he says look billy you're standing here you're at a crossroads it's either you go with the lord this way or you're going to the world you have to make your choice and we all have to make our choice right we've got to make a choice and and in that moment when my heart fell felt like a lead balloon and i felt like i had nothing i said lord i might as well put that one arm down that would go towards the world i have nowhere to go and i said least lord i get an opportunity to stand before you and tell you i love you and you can cast me to hell if you want i love you there that's how i felt i got nowhere else to go why there's nothing that that's half out and the next morning and i still had a heart that was like a lead balloon i went to church the next morning hallelujah i had a glorious time in the presence of god why because you know but that gives a joy that gives a defense because the devil's trying to drag you off the road come back to me i've got pleasures i've got all these awesome things look all your friends are doing it it's so cool and look at this and you just need to fit in and be like this and you know but that stuff comes to an end and there's no satisfaction to it right yes you know but if we walk with him hallelujah you know if we walk with him there's actually a satisfaction there's a joy and if you have the joy the lord is your strength or i say as your defense say but devil i've burned every bridge and i'm not a construction worker i'm not going to rebuild those bridges and go back into the world i'm not a civil engineer i don't want to build those things i burnt every bridge i'm going on with the lord well how do you know he'll receive you i say if i have this feeling in my heart for him right now if this is if this is actually who i really am i believe it is if i have the same spirit when i go to the other side i believe he'll receive me amen amen so he's saying that you are the vine no i'm the vine near the branches so he says if your words if my words abide in you you shall ask what you will it shall be done unto you as they're saying now when we ask what we will it's really when we surrender ourselves that it's not our human emotion into prayer it's actually we become neutral and let him pray because many times we've made up our mind and then we go pray about it oh lord can you do this but in your mind you've made up what you want but in in in order especially if there's a selfish motive behind it right but now if you ask what you will now if you look at now what is the will of god it's his word so he's not willing that any should perish right he is a god of mercy he's a god of redemption he's a god of healing he's a god of restoration he he wished above all that you prosper in health right so those things are in his will those are us as well so we pray according to his will what do we get then it shall be done unto you amen how god answers is his prerogative we know that now herein is my father glorified i'm just repeating this again that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so i have loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you why is that because we're abiding in christ because he's in us right and that your joy might be full so if his joy is in us right because he's in us and our joy becomes full amen and then he says in john 16 and 22 how are we going for time now john 16 and 22 and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you hallelujah so he says so there'll be sorrow you're gonna have sorrow now but i'll see you again this is before he's just about to go to the crucifixion but i'll see you again and your heart shall rejoice amen we see the holy ghost moving we see him come manifest himself become a god of realities to us what is that that makes our heart rejoice i mean you're still with me in this pilgrimage lord you're still walking with me you're with me and in me to the end of the world you know you know he promised he'll never leave us nor forsake us but it does sure feel real good when you feel his presence close eh it feels real good when you know he's there and you feel you feel his anointing and oh hallelujah amen so your your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you why can't why can no man take it from you because no man gave it to you right if god remember it's actually god that gives revelation sure he may use an instrument of a tape or or the bible or a preacher you know and it'd be spoken under inspiration or read under inspiration but it's god it's god that gives the revelation right so sure man may water or plant but god gives the increase god makes it live so that's why that's why when it comes to real revelation on the word no man can take it from you and there's a joy that comes with real revelation hallelujah wasn't it a joy to found out there was there was a way of escape for you it wasn't a joy to find out there was a offering for you there was blood for you there's room at the fountain for you wasn't that a joy and there's a joy to actually be into the fountain hallelujah and to be washed and to be cleansed amen there's a joy when god steps on the scene and fulfills his word in your life doesn't that bring a joy hallelujah amen to this joy that i have the world didn't give it to me the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away hallelujah he says in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it you amen now brother brahm says this now i'm just going to read this a bit lengthy but when he preached the sermon this day on calvary or that day on calvary he said you know this is really an easter kind of a message but it's good to review these things because if you look at that down calvary there's the question now what did it do for you what did it do what did it do too you got to make it real personal you know like brother man preacher sermon what thinking of christ and we watched a um cloverdale skit of the prodigal son or welcome home it's called and there's brother kyle morton as the preacher who's being led down to a dump and there's a boy who ran away from home he's now living as a transit on the street and and and this preacher goes down to the dump and he begins to preach on a soapbox and here's this guy and he wants to go home and go back to the lord and different things but then he asked the question he just says why thank you of christ and that should be the question really to us what think ye of christ what do you think of him is he just something your parents do or some annoying thing that you know about or some religion or some code of ethics or some good man or you know a prophet or is it or is he lord god almighty why think ye of christ you know is he a task master what think ye or is he the lover of your soul your redeemer your friend your savior what think ye holy and i was thinking about it after i was thinking he's the greatest one because you're going to answer that question he's the greatest one there's ever been greatest one there ever is jesus thank the father and i said those things says what thinking of that day on calvary well thank you jesus thanked the father that that he hid it from the educated and shrewd and wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would come to calvary now watch jesus said watch now he stated it the works that i do he's doing them right now the works that i'm doing now healing the sick raising the dead opening the eyes of the blind these works shall you do also you'll do these if you believe in me you do these works and then a greater than this shall you do for i go to my father a little while and the world won't see me no more but you'll see me that's how you know you're not in the of the world because you see him right because the world can't see him yet you'll see me i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world i will not leave you comfortless i'll pray the father he'll send you another comforter which is the holy ghost whom the world cannot receive but you can receive him now notice the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer cast out devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers the holy ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what calvary meant it took stooped degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of god and i put myself in there he took a stoop poor wretched bingoing hallelujah and lifted him into a place to be a son of god to heal the sick to impart eternal life by giving the holy ghost to obedient believers men who are once unbelievers to be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life how much greater is it to say this sick woman laying here i can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but greater than this shall you do i'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see that the greater thing is that's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do it a son of god can jesus said whosoever sends ye remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins ye retain to them they are retained now here is where the catholic church and many others make their big mistake they go and say i forgive your sins that isn't it how did they how did they get their sins forgiven in the bible peter asked that question on the day of pentecost they said what can we do to be saved how can we get it this uh this that you all got he laid down the prescription he told them what to do he said repent every one of you towards god and be baptized name the lord jesus christ what for the remission of your sin that's the greater works how many you preachers this morning how many of you listening to my word on magnetic tape and that was me are willing to go to calvary this morning and look what god did there for you and forsake your denominational creeds and preach the gospel hallelujah it's in your lap now what are you going to do with it he says for repentance or remission of sin must be preached in his name to all the world beginning at jerusalem hallelujah glory there you are what does calvary mean to you what did that day do to you did it stuff you out with some theology did it make you a stuffed shirt or did it make your christian sold out hallelujah sins remitted greater works than this shall you do you see who are the yeas are don't you greater works than this remitting sins in the name of jesus christ but through creeds and denominations so forth has bound you down to a place till you're still serving the world tell me any man any woman come can come to calvary and try to be a big somebody because somebody said something tell me where you can look in the face of calvary in its right light that day in calvary how can you have your down calvary and come out a stuffed shirt what does a stuffed shirt mean a stuffed shirt means look at me i know it all i know all the mysteries i know all the doctrines i know everything listen to me that no that's a stuffed shirt so how can you ever have a down calvary come out a stuffed shirt how can you ever come out as a puppet for some organization and preach some man-made doctrines why don't it humble you to the word of god if you ever go there you'll come out humble how can you want to be some big something in your organization with a feather in your hat when this when jesus christ the son of god humbled himself to be a hacked up body to a spitted face until shame and disgrace and they stripped his clothes off they crucified him before the world despising the shame how can you go to calvary and come away anything different than what he was a disgrace and shame oh you say they'll kick me out let them kick have your day at calvary god will have his way with you let me quote that again have your day at calvary god will have his way with you amen so if someone's really had their down calvary how could they come out of stuff shirt how can they think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread you know you know the answer to everyone's problems no no if you really have a down calvary you'll come out in humility hallelujah surrender to the word of god that's a real humility to submit yourself underneath the word of god and let him be the king of your life amen amen he says now now here's where we lose our position now this is the same message now if you don't watch we try to look back at what we was says what the devil wants us to look back at what we was and as long as we look back at what we was that sacrifice means nothing to us oh can't you see it church i would i would not try the job i can't and neither can you there's no need of trying you're lost to begin with as long as you look at what you've done but don't look at what you've done look at what that down calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question your sins be a scarlet they are white as wool red like crimson white like wool then you have no sin you're perfectly sinless no matter what you've done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted jesus christ as your savior your sins are forgiven anything is forgiven is remitted and forgot about then what does it do it gives you after that condition his spirit to follow him and do as he did for others who is following him i mean i mean others who are following on he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing i want to say is jesus never lived for himself now there's another evidence of have you had your day in calvary jesus never lived for himself he his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life now you say you go to church you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when had come to the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others hallelujah he said oh this is hard but it's the truth we've got to come to that fact recognize what calvary did for you he really ever sat down and said what did it do for me we look at it and say oh yes that's fine that isn't it if the son of god had to go to kauri for crucifixion every man must go to calvary he must also have a calvary you must have that day of calvary i've got to have that day of calvary that settles the sin question don't shake hands with the preacher nor be shook into the church not coming by letter or some profession but come and buy a birth he never gave a letter he never gave a profession he gave a birth that's how we come and then from that automatically we're christians living we're living christian lives hallelujah yes what did that what did that down calvary do for you oh i think i'm just going to leave it there i'm going to leave you with that question because we're going to think about did it make you a stuffed shirt did you say oh that's a nice story that's a nice idea or did you really have a down cover yourself and die and be born again and be transformed hallelujah because if you really had that down calvary then the joy of the lord is your strength amen because you know the sin question is settled hallelujah amen we have the joy this morning have you had that down calvary he said this is an awful simple thing to speak about no this is vital because it's just like pilgrim's progress people came people came to the end of the way and there's one guy who didn't go to calvary and get his testimony i think it is and he tried to get into the pearl he tried to get into the city but without that testimony that he had to go to calvary to get he didn't get in the gate right and he and and he said the christian back on the path he said no no all my four bees have gone this way this is the way to go but but christian said to him but you've got to go by by the cross you've got to go this way you've got to get a testament no no all my four bees have gone this way that'll be fine and he came to the end and he realized he didn't have that testimony and he wasn't let in we want to carry our testimony in here that you've had that down calvary and it changed your life and then by that you know the sin question is settled and it doesn't matter if this building explodes right now and if and then we all go into powder you know where you're going you know and whom you have believed amen let's pray this morning then the musicians can come up i just want to ask you a question with every head bowed this morning have you had that down calvary have you really had that down calvary that your life has been transformed it's been renewed not just an emotional thing though emotion comes with it but have you really met him have you really given your entire life and said lord i wanted i want to have a calvary if you haven't had a calvary this morning i admonish you in the name of the lord jesus christ follow him up the hill that day when the sin of the world was on his shoulders when he died in your place go die with him those things of your first nature the body of your past those things will die there right there too if you have that down calvary amen i'm going to pray gracious father you see every head that's bowed here lord jesus everyone in the room lord i just want to pray to god i just want to ask lord may we all have a down calvary lord and i pray dear god that when we think about what that day lord just that statement just jumped out of me so much what did it do for you lord i was lost and undone lord i was so undone [Music] but lord you allowed me to have a day on calvary lord to die out lord to be identified with you the great lamb of god lord more than an emotional thing lord but lord you lord you did a work o god lord that your blood lord there's still room at the fountain lord where a sinner can be plunged beneath that lord that flood and lose all their guilty stains so dear god i just want to pray for each one here lord if there's anyone here and lord no doubt by the number of people here there are people here who have not had that down calvary maybe they've gone to an altar maybe they've made a profession but lord they've never had that day where they've really died out they've really wrestled it out with you and lord laid them whole selves on the altar all their affection um all their affections hopes and plans and all their desires and all that they are lord they've rarely died out and be born again lord we know it's more than just a phrase of a new lord saying a new birth or being born again it's a real experience lord it's a real happening where a sinner lays their lives down and when they stand up after that experience they don't raise up a sinner no more they raise up as a new creature a new creation in christ jesus so dear god i just want to pray father that lord that you would give all of us here at calvary lord jesus that we would go despising the shame and and and the ridicule and all those things lord you lord you are spit on you're rejected you're beaten you're made fun of lord you are you're mad more than any man but lord you you had a joy set before you lord that's why you went to calvary lord you had a joy that was us redeemed oh god so lord i pray father the lord that joy of the redemption that you purchased us that day might anchor into our hearts oh god may may the joy of the lord be our strength father when we feel down or gloomy lord it's really just the enemy trying to rob us of our victory trying to get us earthbound and our thinking and carnal lord i just want to pray that may we not be in those kind of states but lord may your joy be our fortress may your joy be our defense and our strength that when we feel those things come upon us oh god may we run into you may we begin to think upon what you've done for us lord what that day on calvary did for us lord oh what a day that was lord and i want to thank you that every man woman and child in this room can have that day on calvary so may you grant it to them oh god may may nothing quench that holy thirst lord to have a day on calvary father i just want to commit everyone here into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray that everyone would have lord they would meet you father i'd be born again lord there's a spirit in the land we know the prophet fought against it when he said the days of miracles have passed people would say that god don't do those things anymore that the days and miracles have passed that there's no there's no reality like that anymore it was in the past but we're in a modern time and and god don't do those things no more lord jesus we know that's a lie from the pit of hell where spirits come around and say that all you need to do is accept the message and now you're going in a rapture that's not true lord sure we've got to accept the word but we're going to meet you we're going to be born again we're going to be buried in your name name of the lord jesus christ that will come forth in newness of life not on the titles of god but in your name lord and we've got to really meet you and and and receive the same holy ghost lord that was poured out on the day of pentecost because you are the same yesterday today and forever and if you birth your children lord how you birth them in the beginning you'll birth them now because we've been restored back to a book of acts again so i want to pray to god lord maybe we just mentally worked up something but father i pray dear god that we would be able to look back in our lives maybe even at this moment lord and we say we know that we know that we know because we've met you and our lives have been transformed granted dear god i want to commit everyone into your into your care now father into your hands in
