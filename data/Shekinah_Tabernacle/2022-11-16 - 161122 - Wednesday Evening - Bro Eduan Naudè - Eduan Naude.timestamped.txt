[22:55] have a wonderful time with you
[22:58] amen amen
[23:01] thank you very much
[23:03] really nice atmosphere here thank you
[23:05] brother Josh
[23:09] I might be a little biased but I love it
[23:11] when he sings
[23:13] can we go to the scriptures please thank
[23:16] you musicians
[23:19] I won't do like brother Armando just say
[23:21] thank you musicians not you be seated
[23:23] I'll try and learn eh
[23:29] amen uh Psalms 1 uh
[23:33] 136 we actually read it this morning
[23:35] well I did in um daily Altar and it
[23:39] struck me
[23:42] um
[23:43] I put into upon this thought and as you
[23:46] know but the Cadre and everyone and
[23:49] there's some confirmation that needs to
[23:51] come our way to say this is what I want
[23:54] you to speak on as the Lord would say
[23:57] Psalms 136 and we will start reading
[24:00] from verse 23.
[24:03] or just read the three verses
[24:06] and then we'll jump to John 9.
[24:10] Psalm 136 who remem us in our low estate
[24:15] for his Mercy endure forever and hath
[24:18] redeemed us from our enemies for his
[24:21] love or for his mercy endureth forever
[24:23] who giveth food to All Flesh
[24:26] for his Mercy endures forever and it's
[24:29] still here on this Earth right now
[24:31] oh give thanks unto the god of Heaven
[24:35] for his mercy endureth forever and if we
[24:38] can just quickly jump to John 9 from um
[24:42] from verse 6.
[24:51] from verse 6 John 9.
[24:55] when he had thus spoken he spat on the
[24:58] ground and this is now Jesus speaking to
[25:00] the uh and demonstrating his power to uh
[25:03] to the blind that was born blind
[25:06] spat on the ground and made play of the
[25:10] spittle and he Anointed The Eyes of the
[25:12] blind man with a clay
[25:14] and said unto him go wash in the pool of
[25:17] silhoum which is by interpretation sent
[25:21] he went his way therefore and washed and
[25:23] came seeing and if we drop down there to
[25:25] verse 11
[25:27] this is now where they're talking to
[25:28] this blind man he answered and said the
[25:31] man that is called Jesus made lay and
[25:33] anointed my eyes and said unto me go to
[25:36] the pool of Siloam and wash and I went
[25:39] and washed and I received sight and
[25:41] dropped down to verse in 25 if you may
[25:44] he answered and said whether he be a
[25:47] sinner or not speaking of Jesus
[25:49] I know not one thing I know that is
[25:52] where I was blind now I see
[25:56] may I quickly just jump while we stand
[25:58] Standing to verse 4 of John 9 where
[26:01] Jesus is speaking and saying I must work
[26:04] the works of him that sent me while it
[26:07] is day the night cometh where no man can
[26:10] work as long as I am in the world I am
[26:13] the light of the world
[26:16] Lord bless his reading of his word you
[26:18] may be seated
[26:19] and I'll take the comfort of standing
[26:24] right so um apologies that this might
[26:27] feel all over the show and um all over
[26:30] the place I thought maybe uh I had so
[26:33] many thoughts and I was trying to sort
[26:35] of get them all together I think um
[26:39] I think the the title might explain it
[26:41] and and my title I would think for
[26:43] tonight for this little message is is
[26:45] the testimony in the revelation
[26:48] so whatever you've received wherever
[26:51] your new walk when are you looking past
[26:52] when you're looking right now where are
[26:54] you walking
[26:55] the testimony of that what have you
[26:58] received the the truth that you have the
[27:00] the faith that is that is that is
[27:02] building and and growing
[27:05] so just see this as all small little
[27:08] pieces of Mana that you that you may
[27:10] pick up
[27:11] um like the Israelites there in the in
[27:13] the desert and then stop chew on one of
[27:16] the two pieces and then move on because
[27:18] I will move on and we'll pick up another
[27:20] piece and we'll we'll we'll have a uh a
[27:23] gastronomical uh Jubilee tonight yes I I
[27:26] truly believe we will now oh brother
[27:30] Chris welcome I saw you there from the
[27:33] back end there's only one guy that can
[27:35] enter in uh I love that hey oh man you
[27:38] should have given us a special or
[27:40] something man you you sing Next Level oh
[27:43] it's good to be happy here
[27:45] um
[27:46] yeah so I had this thought right and I
[27:48] was I was sharing this with brother
[27:49] brother Arman now um me being a bit of
[27:53] sometimes a drama uh type of guy I'm
[27:56] thinking Jonah and in the Wayland that's
[27:58] this has come now over the pool but a
[28:00] bit
[28:01] um and is sort of trying to the Lord is
[28:03] trying to build our faith muscles the
[28:05] Lord is trying to to to stir up
[28:08] something in us to say there's not long
[28:10] to go you need to get in your position
[28:13] you need to pray you need to you need to
[28:16] stand in the Gap you need to be in the
[28:17] breach you need to claim your family and
[28:20] claim your friends and claim those that
[28:21] is are far off and um
[28:24] you be the spearhead of this Warfare of
[28:28] this war of these soldiers right
[28:31] so there I was thinking about a good old
[28:34] Jonah and um
[28:38] in the belly of the whale in the fish
[28:41] and uh
[28:42] one thing he said now as soon as he and
[28:45] this is the attitude that I like about
[28:46] if you look to you know towards the
[28:48] prophets I was talking about David as
[28:50] well the attitude immediately when they
[28:53] when they face the trial when they see
[28:56] they were wrong when they made the the
[28:58] wrong choice and they went the wrong way
[29:00] um there's this repentance there's this
[29:02] coming back to the Lord immediately as
[29:04] quick as I can rush to him because you
[29:06] know where the truth is it's here okay
[29:09] we've got one goal we've got one
[29:11] objective on this Earth as to glorify
[29:14] the Lord Jesus Christ and while we're
[29:16] doing that people will see that people
[29:18] start asking questions and their seed
[29:20] will be will be planted right and that's
[29:23] that's where we're going so this Jonah
[29:24] he's in in the Billy of the wild now
[29:26] imagine you were sitting next to him
[29:28] maybe where you are now in your
[29:30] spiritual walk you might agree with them
[29:32] right but you were sitting there uh
[29:36] and you're looking at the circumstance
[29:37] now
[29:39] uh sorry to spoil your your little
[29:41] Hollywood picture maybe or your cartoon
[29:43] but the the belly of the whale wasn't
[29:45] that big that he could walk around and
[29:47] push up his hands and have a little
[29:49] Jubilee in there it was
[29:52] endless yeah it was it was you know it
[29:56] was not comfortable you know if I can
[29:58] get that cross right if he had to move
[30:00] you know arms was like and there he's
[30:04] saying I will once again turn my face to
[30:07] the to the temple I will pray all this
[30:10] around me is lying vanities
[30:12] now you're sitting there
[30:15] next to him
[30:18] Jonah you were you were losing it
[30:20] you you are Looney you're crazy you're
[30:23] insane just open your eyes well I can't
[30:26] because I'm blind because I'm in the
[30:28] belly but in that moment now to the
[30:32] world I can't explain this but that this
[30:35] there's your faith right there's your
[30:37] there's your testimony of the Revelation
[30:39] that he received right there Lord I
[30:42] wasn't in your will you came you brought
[30:45] this I saw the Tempest of the water
[30:47] still when you tossed me over the boat
[30:49] and all of a sudden
[30:51] I'm in this predicament
[30:53] but once again I will face turn my face
[30:55] towards the temple I will pray upon the
[30:57] Lord
[30:58] and he will receive he will get me out
[31:01] of this little predicament this
[31:02] conundrum right what did he do spit him
[31:04] out and he went and he turned that whole
[31:07] city around right
[31:10] through the grace of God
[31:12] yeah right so
[31:13] with that thinking about crazy thinking
[31:16] about we need to change our thinking we
[31:18] need to we we can't be we can't be in
[31:20] this world and thinking like
[31:22] the circumstance is impossible what with
[31:25] the situation I'm finding the trial I'm
[31:28] having the yada yada yada we we can't
[31:31] think like that anymore we can't be in
[31:34] the scene we can't be here and and and
[31:36] and the the five senses that's deceiving
[31:39] us their brother being sent on the 16th
[31:41] beautiful beautiful message and it's
[31:43] just inspired me again
[31:45] and if you look back in the scriptures
[31:47] but by faith Abel offered unto God a
[31:51] more excellent Sacrifice by faith
[31:54] Abraham when he was tried when he was
[31:56] trialled when he said when the Lord said
[31:58] go and sacrifice Isaac
[32:02] again now he's standing next to him and
[32:04] you're walking up this hill and you hear
[32:06] I need to do this
[32:08] but the Lord promised you
[32:10] see sand people and you're taking the
[32:13] only one and he's gone
[32:15] it would it will not make sense right
[32:18] but by faith
[32:21] he comes and he delivers him now what
[32:24] I'm trying to say there and I might be
[32:27] jumping a bit but
[32:28] take Easter
[32:31] Now Easter now I need to find my notes
[32:34] for Esther
[32:35] knew what was coming for her people the
[32:39] king gave a Grace gave her time
[32:42] and prepared her to equip her for this
[32:44] trial that was coming
[32:45] so when we preach and when the ministers
[32:48] come and when people are talking and
[32:49] ministering and so
[32:51] we we we're never away from trial so as
[32:55] I'm standing here I'm in a trial right
[32:58] the Lord is is really refining us and
[33:02] and polishing us and saying well I want
[33:05] the Spotless bride and we've got this
[33:08] Christ of La crust of Life still on us
[33:10] so here he equipped us he he give us
[33:14] Grace and he prepare us and equip us for
[33:16] the trial he's not going to throw you in
[33:18] something that you cannot handle it's
[33:21] scriptural it's in the word and it's a
[33:23] promise hold on to their promise so
[33:26] whatever is coming just just know just
[33:29] know
[33:30] okay so I'm back where my original note
[33:32] so God and all the prophets now are
[33:36] looking down
[33:37] and I'm telling you they are looking in
[33:40] all of us and waiting for us to
[33:42] recognize that and awaken the faith that
[33:47] they had that they know it's already in
[33:50] US
[33:51] because Hebrews 13 8
[33:54] and showed us uh sorry and tell us
[33:58] so they told us they showed us they had
[34:01] the signs and wonders it is in us so
[34:03] they sitting there and waiting the time
[34:06] is coming time is nigh what are you
[34:08] doing pick up your faith pick up your
[34:10] sword witness and experience God on a
[34:15] Sunday and a Monday and a Tuesday and
[34:17] and make him part of your life every
[34:19] step pray without ceasing like brother
[34:21] man said you know walk this walk
[34:23] it doesn't matter up and down
[34:26] again taking a step back you are outside
[34:28] of that it is it is
[34:31] you can tell me I'm Looney you are
[34:33] outside of that realm here
[34:36] use your faith that you have to put
[34:38] yourself and say like Paul said nothing
[34:41] moves me
[34:42] right
[34:44] now
[34:45] I am in this flesh and I might not be
[34:48] where I ought to be but by God's grace
[34:50] I'm no longer where I used to be
[34:54] now with that I want to make a little
[34:56] introduction there to parfani that's
[34:57] been that's joined us I love that guy he
[35:01] is
[35:04] I I love him and he's he's like a dad he
[35:06] knows that I I don't have to
[35:08] I don't have to lie
[35:10] um
[35:11] but you can go no behind my back and you
[35:15] can I talk to him about stories just
[35:16] don't tell him too much detail
[35:18] of this guy where I was
[35:21] right
[35:24] um yeah I'll tell you a little story
[35:26] right so
[35:28] so there I was and uh uh and me and
[35:31] Lundy could have been our first trial
[35:33] actually
[35:34] and um
[35:37] a lot of things happened
[35:39] and I
[35:41] I had a massive uh temper
[35:43] right maybe my boys would say I still
[35:46] have a massive temper but
[35:48] um
[35:49] stormed out of the house their house
[35:51] right and I jumped there in my car where
[35:54] I wanted to now London knows when I'm
[35:56] angry I'm seeing black and and I know
[36:00] where I'm going so she doesn't want me
[36:01] behind the steering wheel so she loved
[36:04] me and um
[36:06] and and I just wanted to get away I want
[36:09] to get away from the situation and at
[36:11] that point I could argue as much as I
[36:13] want I was innocent I wasn't innocent I
[36:16] was never innocent right so anyway
[36:18] fleeing from the situation right
[36:21] and there I am and we're screaming
[36:24] outside and yelling and crying and not
[36:26] flying and I smash my own car I I hit my
[36:31] car dancing I'm like why not my
[36:35] dad-in-law's car
[36:40] you know you do not think when you're
[36:43] just in that state and you never want to
[36:45] be in that state right it is horrible
[36:49] and no yeah bless bless my mom-in-law
[36:52] also the softest person ever on this
[36:55] Earth beautiful Christian and she comes
[36:58] down the steps and oh what is what is
[37:00] this rigmarole and I just in my you turn
[37:04] away from this and you go back in the
[37:05] house
[37:06] okay so here comes Paul funny
[37:09] right
[37:11] now you can imagine in yourself now
[37:14] again let's take this General situation
[37:16] the guy next to Jonah the imaginary guy
[37:18] right
[37:19] I'm thinking he would come here and he's
[37:21] going to to polish me
[37:23] he's going to flatten me he's going to
[37:25] throw me over the wall
[37:26] and he comes with this gentleness he
[37:29] comes in his what is wrong and he puts
[37:32] his arms around us and he prays first
[37:34] thing he does he prays
[37:36] and I just break down I just let it go
[37:39] and they're dissolved the the whole
[37:42] scenario the whole situation dissolves
[37:45] there was many many more of those right
[37:48] it didn't just stop there but now there
[37:51] there's an example there's someone
[37:52] that's and
[37:55] it was yeah you could almost say it was
[37:58] in that moment that I knew Lundy as a
[38:00] keeper just
[38:02] looking at the household looking at the
[38:04] health that's there you know and um and
[38:08] and and looking at
[38:10] I needed that I needed that stability
[38:13] and well if you know my dad as well
[38:16] um man of the word and and really in it
[38:18] but
[38:19] I took my journey I took my wrong turn
[38:23] and here is not another hand on this
[38:27] Earth placed here to just leave me back
[38:29] just to bring me a little bit a little
[38:31] bit back
[38:34] a bit more recently I would say just
[38:37] when you sincerely call on the Lord so I
[38:39] start I want to start sort of changing
[38:41] now sorry I didn't start my timer here I
[38:44] want to start uh change it to
[38:47] um the testimony to what you've received
[38:50] up to now
[38:51] the Revelation now how do you utter it
[38:54] how do you
[38:56] um enjoy explain it to someone that's
[38:58] maybe there in the world how do how did
[39:01] that condesa how do you how do you
[39:03] dialogue with that right
[39:05] now just a quick testimony after the
[39:07] camp
[39:08] um before the camp me and Josh came up
[39:10] for a bit of prayer because you know the
[39:12] season changes we know we're going into
[39:14] Camp mode and you know um the the the
[39:17] our bodies are impacted by that you know
[39:20] I my my nose bleed you know so many
[39:24] times and then people that knows when it
[39:26] bleeds it doesn't stop just within
[39:28] seconds so then there's a whole
[39:30] rigmarole need to go sit down but
[39:33] and after the camp you know you would be
[39:36] trialled
[39:37] so I'm standing there and but Andy it's
[39:39] you that gets trial there when you brush
[39:41] your teeth hey when you can't speak back
[39:42] to the to the devil so I'm I'm in the
[39:45] bathroom
[39:46] and and the nose starts bleeding
[39:48] and in my in my mind in my spirit I'm
[39:52] I'm talking to the Lord and say Lord
[39:53] just take this away I really I really
[39:56] don't like this I don't want I don't
[39:57] want this I just it just it's it's just
[40:00] awful it's just you know it hampers your
[40:03] your speed your your Cadence you know
[40:05] now you need to sit and pause and think
[40:07] maybe I should think upon the Lord while
[40:09] I'm doing that but at that moment I did
[40:11] and um
[40:13] and I walk into because I had to blow my
[40:16] nose right so the testimony from the
[40:18] prayer is that at Camp the only time my
[40:21] nosebleed bled was when I blew my nose
[40:23] not no other time and ironically that
[40:26] was on London's birthday in the mornings
[40:28] so I couldn't even happy birthday
[40:30] because I um was in the conundrum but
[40:34] anyway coming back now and and I blew my
[40:37] nose I had to and I and I can feel it
[40:40] starts bleeding and I'm saying Lord I
[40:43] just don't want it and I come into the
[40:45] mirror look in it and I say like that
[40:47] and I speak spake it out I spoke it and
[40:49] I said like this and it's bleeding and I
[40:53] plug a little bit of toilet paper and I
[40:55] pull it out threw it in the toilet paper
[40:58] and I'd stop bleeding oh good no but
[41:00] this is not
[41:01] this is not normal
[41:03] and and I even I didn't even share with
[41:06] Lanny now forgive me that I didn't share
[41:08] this because in myself I thought it was
[41:11] going to bleed again I thought I'm going
[41:12] to walk out the bathroom or whatever
[41:14] sniff sniff and whatever and it starts
[41:16] bleeding again
[41:17] and I never did and it hasn't since so
[41:20] I'm going praise the Lord yes this is a
[41:23] small thing but it's a big thing because
[41:25] you have to trust them there and he
[41:27] wants to see what you do with your faith
[41:28] and that smaller situations what do you
[41:31] do with your faith when you when you
[41:33] we're in big situations
[41:36] okay absolutely so the Revelation that
[41:40] you've received
[41:42] what do you do with it and how do you
[41:43] witness now I've got a few papers here
[41:46] well the one I think is a prayer request
[41:49] and uh the other one is just a blank
[41:51] paper
[41:52] but you don't you don't grab you go
[41:55] you've received the Revelation here's
[41:57] here's your here's your nugget here's
[41:59] your little Mana for the day right
[42:02] um
[42:03] actually I should have put it the other
[42:05] way around
[42:06] you've received meat and veggies you've
[42:09] received over years and years of of
[42:12] coming to the message
[42:14] um talking to the Lord how he's opened
[42:17] up his word
[42:18] um he's received he's given so many
[42:20] things and then you look back you go but
[42:23] that's not how I understood it then this
[42:25] is so much different because of
[42:27] Revelation right
[42:28] now you start witnessing to someone do
[42:30] you take this paper and you go
[42:34] do you know the soup and Seed
[42:37] so taking Sunday's message
[42:41] do you come there with wrath so you come
[42:43] there with to be different do you come
[42:45] there with
[42:46] there's only one true baptism
[42:49] what is your attitude when you start
[42:51] witnessing right and how do you add it
[42:53] is not it is not easy I grant you that
[42:56] but how do you do that the Lord must
[42:58] tell you that right so in his word he he
[43:01] does I'll give you another little
[43:03] testimony um
[43:05] we were in the car the one day we were
[43:07] um that was when we're slaughtering the
[43:09] the sheep for um for Robin and we had
[43:12] such a wonderful time because that was
[43:13] just after our Easter services and
[43:16] um driving back in this friend of mine
[43:19] um
[43:20] now brother man can witness do this we
[43:24] never spoke about gospel we've we've
[43:26] just we spoke about rugby we spoke about
[43:28] the Free State we spoke about South
[43:30] Africa we spoke about beautiful right to
[43:33] sort of
[43:35] get a channel open up a channel be
[43:37] friendly how can we how can we share
[43:39] this
[43:40] in the future so I jump in the van with
[43:42] him he takes me home and basically the
[43:45] first thing he asked me is like what
[43:47] church do you go to
[43:49] I said well okay Lord I wasn't ready for
[43:52] that I would still have blood on my
[43:53] fingernails so how do I share this
[43:56] now his angle was and none not not his
[44:02] fault or anything not good or bad but
[44:04] his angulars what makes us our gospel
[44:07] different
[44:09] do we different to who
[44:11] right now by the Lord's Grace I wanted
[44:14] to go there because that's the that's a
[44:16] question he answered so or the question
[44:18] he asked I'll answer him that way
[44:21] but by the Lord's Grace he just pulled
[44:23] me back and he said okay
[44:26] give them give them
[44:28] scriptural truth
[44:30] give him scriptural truth I said well
[44:32] firstly
[44:34] I need to know who I am I worshiping
[44:37] what's my identity who am I worshiping
[44:40] where is he what is he what is his name
[44:45] who am I talking to am I talking to
[44:47] three five or seven people
[44:49] who is this where is he does he have a
[44:51] telephone right so I sort of broke that
[44:54] down and say
[44:56] started with a bit of a LOM but for a
[44:58] bit of um Genesis and I said now he's
[45:02] got all these attributes and he says I'm
[45:05] a redeemer but what am I redeemed of
[45:09] so how how do I get saved
[45:14] okay so then we look at baptism I said
[45:17] okay so I go to the book of Acts and it
[45:18] says oh repent of me baptized and you
[45:22] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[45:23] Spirit I said okay
[45:25] and then I said but now I'm redeemed but
[45:27] I still don't know what am I redeemed
[45:29] off
[45:30] sin right right so where is this sin
[45:33] how to understand sin what is sin
[45:36] when when is it sin and when is it not
[45:39] so by the Lord's Grace I could explain
[45:41] it in that way
[45:43] that it is not different to any belief
[45:47] there's a lot of difference yes but I
[45:49] might my attitude was not to go and find
[45:51] and pick the differences my my attitude
[45:55] was here's the truth how can I expose
[45:58] you to that
[45:59] whether you agree or not I can just come
[46:01] back to the infallible word of God right
[46:05] just now recently today actually talked
[46:07] to one of my colleagues
[46:09] and she actually she's a Buddhist and
[46:11] she started acknowledging that there is
[46:14] a great one on the way allegedly they
[46:18] might they should already be here
[46:20] that would have a neutrality and a peace
[46:24] with wisdom
[46:27] now looking through my lenses I know
[46:30] that there's one on on the way and if we
[46:33] look at the prophet's life he says that
[46:35] it might be overdue already
[46:38] um
[46:39] and then I go well how do I witness do
[46:41] this now how did I actually want to go
[46:43] one back and say what did I share so
[46:46] what did I make her say that and how
[46:49] does she respond
[46:50] because we were talking about she's
[46:52] going to Sri Lanka and the life the the
[46:54] the the the the the countries the
[46:56] turmoil the war the everything and I go
[46:59] yeah yeah and and she knows I'm a
[47:01] Christian she knows I've got a bit of a
[47:03] spiritual eye and I'm saying well
[47:07] what I'm what I'm seeing is when I go to
[47:10] when I go to the scripture and I see
[47:12] David and I see there's this Wars and
[47:15] his hands were made for war but I feel
[47:18] that this age is coming to the end where
[47:20] we go into Solomon and we go into wisdom
[47:23] we're going to peace
[47:25] and I go I feel we're getting to that
[47:27] age to that end of that season where we
[47:30] have to have this war
[47:32] but it will end and she also had a end
[47:35] date so she talked about some something
[47:37] like February or whatever according to
[47:39] the stars and Saturn and whatever so
[47:42] again I said I said I uttered I said
[47:44] awesome and she goes no that's not
[47:46] awesome because you know the world's in
[47:47] normal turmoil I say this yeah it's not
[47:50] awesome
[47:51] but it's got an end date it's got an end
[47:54] date right
[47:55] so
[47:56] and and that's the way I I didn't like
[47:59] well I mentioned the scriptures never
[48:01] never mentioned Jesus or but you can you
[48:04] can infiltrate you you you can be the
[48:07] reconnaissance you can be you know we we
[48:10] are specialized troops soldiers right
[48:13] and we were chosen we were hand-picked
[48:16] right we are not that little foot
[48:19] soldiers that came in and you know still
[48:21] went behind the years the Lord has given
[48:23] us a lot of ammunition a lot of
[48:26] Revelation what do we do with it
[48:29] if we want to be that spearhead if we
[48:32] want to be the three from David if we
[48:34] want to be that hand-picked
[48:36] we we've got to move we've got to change
[48:38] we gotta show we gotta we gotta uh get
[48:43] in school and they go you're different
[48:46] why are you different
[48:49] you've got to swim against the grain
[48:50] you've got to achieve above what you
[48:53] think is possible
[48:54] that's where the faith faith muscles
[48:56] comes in
[48:58] and that brings me to how do I minister
[49:01] to other people should we focus on what
[49:02] what our differences is or should we say
[49:05] what do we agree on with our bravery
[49:07] Brethren from other churches from other
[49:09] groups
[49:11] and again I just want to reiterate
[49:13] infallible word of God that's still
[49:15] living today and I'm still getting
[49:17] Revelation today I don't have to go
[49:19] anywhere else right if you have time if
[49:22] you have patience just sit down and
[49:25] listen to the Lord the Lord the the the
[49:27] word is so so rich uh I was just reading
[49:32] the daily altar there at the back and
[49:33] I'm like this is this is awesome this is
[49:37] such good manner for us in today and
[49:42] yeah so never stagnate never stop
[49:44] walking now just push on
[49:47] I was also listening to um brother
[49:49] Dawson Riley's testimony you are man
[49:52] that's such a good testimony but that
[49:54] showed me God comes in Simplicity as
[49:56] well and God comes God comes your way
[49:59] you know he comes and he sits with you
[50:02] what do you what do you do no I'm a lion
[50:04] hunter ah okay so you know are you crack
[50:07] shot are you good yeah yeah I'm not too
[50:09] bad and you know that starts the
[50:11] conversation and then liaison Manson
[50:15] weeks on the Lord comes
[50:18] throw up a rock
[50:20] see what happens
[50:22] see Faith rise see that there's
[50:25] something different see that thus saith
[50:27] the Lord has just been spoken you know
[50:29] see see faith in action
[50:32] right and then you can make what that
[50:36] what you want but the Lord's come your
[50:38] way he's speaking on your level he's not
[50:41] a cookie cut to God kids he's not a
[50:43] cookie cut the God he will speak to you
[50:45] in your way if you like your music if
[50:47] you like your your reading time if you
[50:50] like I don't know spending time with
[50:52] that and Mum he will find a way to come
[50:55] to speak to you on your level and talk
[50:58] to you and saying I love you I've got a
[51:01] plan for you you have not stopped we are
[51:03] right now we have to still walk I've got
[51:06] this massive plan for you come with me
[51:09] right
[51:11] and that brings me on to
[51:16] to worship God in the midst of trouble
[51:19] so like I said we all have trials
[51:22] because you've received the revelation
[51:24] of who he is who is control
[51:27] who has placed you here where you are
[51:30] now wherever you are in your life and
[51:32] who has greater things planned for you
[51:34] you've got to have confidence in him if
[51:37] he brought in I I'm I testify if he
[51:39] brought me from that Old Blue bull
[51:41] supporter to where I'm now he goes you
[51:45] you you you can you can you can make it
[51:49] I can see the end
[51:52] amen and with that I want to testify and
[51:54] this is the Bold statement for tonight
[51:56] so if you want to press record now or
[51:58] stop the video I don't know the worst
[52:01] place that you've been since you've
[52:03] received the revelation of who Jesus
[52:05] Christ is is still better than the best
[52:08] place without that
[52:10] I can testify I've been in really really
[52:13] good places we've done service here for
[52:16] Christ maybe a little small testimony as
[52:18] well where we are counseling people
[52:21] that's in need through the word and with
[52:24] the knowledge that we have and I don't
[52:26] want to take that away again if I refer
[52:28] back to brother Bean's message on Sunday
[52:30] if I I came in here in this message and
[52:33] go for 30 years I've been lied at so I
[52:36] wanted to approach it with the wrong
[52:37] attitude and God bless him he he said no
[52:40] that's not the way so praise the Lord
[52:43] I had the best place where I served him
[52:47] where I found you know when I was in
[52:49] solitude when when he comes to me speaks
[52:52] to me and you know I used to I used to
[52:55] write poems to the Lundy you know and
[52:57] that was my way to you know went over
[53:01] um but that that all began that all
[53:03] began in in service here it All Began
[53:06] because of I was seeing his Beauty and I
[53:08] I couldn't Express that how do I express
[53:09] it and you know start writing that and I
[53:12] had an awesome time in that and still
[53:15] really and well if you think now the
[53:17] opposite the worst day and I've had
[53:19] pretty bad days since I've been in a in
[53:23] this message and since I've been this
[53:25] the the Christian I am today
[53:28] it's still better
[53:29] it's still better and I have to say that
[53:31] I have to truthfully honestly say that
[53:34] while I was in that deepest deepest
[53:36] trial and it's very you know it's
[53:38] reasonably recent that in that I still
[53:43] had Joy
[53:44] I didn't look at
[53:46] but I had Joy it could not be stolen and
[53:49] I could just glorify his name through
[53:51] everything
[53:54] and like I said Paul said these things
[53:57] do not move me so can we walk past that
[53:59] can we get now to say whatever your
[54:03] circumstances I mean where's where's
[54:04] pravin I thought no hey that month's now
[54:08] you're struggling with your with your
[54:09] leg you know you the attitude that you
[54:12] approach that
[54:14] you know how much you have changed so if
[54:17] you approach that now four years ago you
[54:20] know and how you approached it now and
[54:22] saying
[54:23] Lord you've got no attention you know we
[54:26] had the one day now where Josh broke his
[54:29] Tower Jonah got his leg open and get
[54:31] seven stitches on the same day I said
[54:34] Lord you've got my attention
[54:36] you know
[54:37] brother I meant you preached at me you
[54:40] preached me on Wednesday that's why I
[54:42] was so quiet
[54:44] I said yep yeah I'm I'm listening Lord
[54:46] I'm listening and if that was a way to
[54:49] get my attention Praise Him
[54:52] what flies with this right
[54:54] um
[54:55] I really want us to pray this
[54:58] if you stop and think how many how many
[55:01] things they are to pray for how many
[55:03] people to pray for and not only for
[55:05] healing eh there's people just that
[55:08] one's just a little hope
[55:10] you know and that's
[55:12] um Dawson Reilly's testimony is talking
[55:13] about a little lift you know
[55:16] oh that tastes let's go and listen it it
[55:18] is incredible the way the Lord worked
[55:22] and and lifting him in times when he was
[55:25] just really just down
[55:28] um so I really want to pray for these
[55:29] people that
[55:30] um
[55:31] needs a hand needs a hand of the Lord
[55:33] and needs a little a little persuasion
[55:36] maybe that needs you know just that that
[55:38] light
[55:39] so can we put up that last slide I think
[55:42] it says Josh slides
[55:44] um
[55:45] from a little piece there in adoption
[55:49] and if there's anything that burns
[55:51] within my heart and I hope never leaves
[55:54] me in my years to come and a little
[55:56] context remember where I was now and the
[55:58] best place I could ever be
[56:00] now taking that
[56:02] before the message all right now but the
[56:05] best place you you spiritually have been
[56:07] right
[56:08] put yourself there
[56:12] um that'll never forget what happened
[56:14] last Sunday morning as a week it has
[56:16] done something in my life now I like
[56:18] this it's revolutionized my life I want
[56:21] you to be revolutionized in your life to
[56:24] go out there and say
[56:26] the faith I have
[56:28] you know the joy I have

[56:56] because there's no way to explain it you
[56:58] cannot find words because it isn't lay
[57:00] in the English dictionary or no other
[57:04] dictionary because it is an eternity no
[57:06] yesterday no tomorrow I like this it's
[57:09] all present tense
[57:12] and so I'm feeling pretty good in an
[57:15] hour from now I don't feel so well and

[57:38] mean that's already there and now he's
[57:41] saying you are so close you can you can
[57:44] make this we are seeing the finishing
[57:46] line that door of the Ark is creaking as

[57:56] want uh for Your Life by what the Lord
[57:59] wants in your life

[58:03] it felt so well into the scriptures of
[58:06] of Hebrew 13. and that's the present
[58:09] tense God maybe present tense in your
[58:12] whole life and every aspect of your life
