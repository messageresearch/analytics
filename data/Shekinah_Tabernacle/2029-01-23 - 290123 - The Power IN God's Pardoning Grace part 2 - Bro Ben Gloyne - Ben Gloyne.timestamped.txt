[5:29] it's good to be in the house of God this
[5:32] morning and to be refreshed in the Holy
[5:35] Ghost because the Lord's going to pour
[5:36] out of spirit upon us then we're going
[5:38] to be blessed in a powerful way this
[5:39] morning I mean we don't meet in vain we
[5:41] don't meet a God that doesn't hear or
[5:43] that's just an
[5:45] an imagined thing but we come to the
[5:48] Living God this morning
[5:50] amen that that changes lives and that
[5:53] makes us New Creations and the god that
[5:56] gave us power to become sons of God and
[5:59] it's that power that we desire this
[6:01] morning the life-changing power to
[6:03] become Sons and Daughters of God uh this
[6:05] morning and that's that's what the
[6:07] Lord's going to do for us so let's um
[6:08] let's stand we're in for a great time in
[6:10] the Lord we always get what we expect
[6:12] you know and the lord loves to feel
[6:14] welcome he likes to feel constrained he
[6:16] doesn't he doesn't barge in like a rude
[6:19] salesman trying to offer us product if
[6:21] you don't want it he'll just back away
[6:22] but you know if you really want it he he
[6:24] just wants to pour out his Blessing and
[6:26] his goodness upon us so let's let's have
[6:28] the right attitude and our heart to
[6:30] really desire that God would bless us in
[6:31] a powerful way and we will receive that
[6:34] let's just open a prayer this morning

[39:57] Lord and they said unto Moses because
[39:59] there was no graves in Egypt thou has
[40:02] taken us away to die in the wilderness
[40:03] wherefore hast thou doubt thus with us
[40:06] so to carry us forth out of Egypt is not
[40:11] this the word that we did tell thee in
[40:13] Egypt saying let us alone that we may
[40:15] serve the Egyptians for it had been
[40:17] better for us to serve the Egyptians
[40:20] than that we should die in the
[40:21] wilderness and Moses said unto the
[40:23] people of um and said unto the people

[41:47] what you want to do Lord in Jesus
[41:48] Christ's name amen God bless you may
[41:51] have your seats this morning so last
[41:54] Sunday just a very quick recap I was
[41:55] talking about the power in God's pardon
[41:57] and Grace and he's talking about the how
[41:59] there's power and God's pardon to take
[42:01] you out of every prison and every
[42:02] trouble and you know and but you know
[42:04] there's a pro you know you know there's
[42:06] a time when we need to you know look
[42:08] into where we have been and realize
[42:10] we're not there anymore
[42:11] it's a very it's yeah it's a very
[42:13] important thing that that we realize
[42:15] where we have been but we're not there
[42:16] anymore we're not back there anymore so
[42:19] the so the people of Israel they always
[42:20] had this problem of the slave mentality
[42:22] complex where it didn't matter really
[42:25] unfortunately how how free they were how
[42:27] much God undertook for them they were
[42:29] still living back in Egypt in their
[42:30] minds but God never wanted them to be
[42:33] living as slaves back in Egypt in their
[42:35] minds he wanted them to realize that
[42:38] they were God's chosen people as as God
[42:40] even called Israel his son and he called
[42:43] them out of Egypt to walk with him and
[42:45] serve him and be in the promised land be
[42:47] in their inheritance amen so we've got
[42:49] to realize we all have a past you know
[42:51] it doesn't matter where we come from
[42:53] what we've done we may have been the
[42:54] rankest sinner in the world or we could
[42:56] have had just a proud religious spirit
[42:57] being raised up in church we've all had
[42:59] a past right and we've all come from
[43:01] somewhere right but then God doesn't
[43:03] want us to live in the past he wants us
[43:05] to live in the future I mean he wants
[43:07] many people are defined by their past
[43:10] maybe a defining moment in their life
[43:12] you know can be a very terrible thing
[43:14] can be a very good thing but you know
[43:16] many many times it's the negative things
[43:17] of our life that hold us back and those
[43:20] negative things unfortunately for human
[43:22] beings Define us they you know really
[43:24] dictates our path how we think how we
[43:26] act how we treat one another and and and
[43:29] it controls us but we're going to
[43:31] realize that that that's not our portion
[43:33] we're going to realize that that that
[43:36] our portion is actually the fullness of
[43:37] the Holy Ghost it's the fullness of the
[43:39] word it's actually we are the sons and
[43:41] daughters of the most high God and and
[43:43] really who he is should Define us you
[43:46] know you're on how we walk how we act
[43:48] how we dress the things we say the
[43:49] things we do everything that we do think
[43:53] and say should be controlled or governed
[43:55] by him he should be our defining moment
[43:58] now I was thinking about this I want to
[44:00] as a as a bit of a uh subject or
[44:03] something I want to talk about going
[44:05] back to the spot where you drown Satan
[44:07] you know I was thinking about the Hutt
[44:08] River you know you know you know you're
[44:09] the Google Maps or this world knows the
[44:11] Hutt river is the Hutt River but there's
[44:13] but there's a couple of special pots uh
[44:16] spots in that River where where Satan's
[44:18] been drowned you know we talk about
[44:21] baptizing someone we talk about drowning
[44:22] Satan I mean we're we're he and his sins
[44:25] and all the past are washed out into the
[44:27] into the ocean and you know we bear them
[44:29] no more you know there's a this world
[44:30] has a pollution problem but it's not
[44:33] just a natural pollution problem it's a
[44:34] spiritual pollution problem you know and
[44:36] and all the rubbish ends up in the sea
[44:38] you know there's in the Pacific Ocean
[44:40] and the Indian Ocean I think even in the
[44:42] Atlantic there's these great garbage uh
[44:44] heaps where the currents will take all
[44:46] the plastic all the waste and they'll
[44:47] just all this plastic floats on top of
[44:50] the water you know and and and and and
[44:52] actually in the spiritual we have
[44:54] garbage heaps too it's called The Sea of
[44:56] God's forgetfulness amen where where our
[44:58] past and who we were who we thought we
[45:00] were as washed away amen and and it's
[45:04] just taken by the current of the Holy
[45:05] Ghost far far away
[45:07] I mean some people they have actually
[45:09] started companies to to to recycle that
[45:11] plastic and reuse it I say good on them
[45:13] but in the spiritual we don't want to
[45:15] recycle and dredge up our old past but
[45:18] the devil wants us to live in that way
[45:19] and dredge up how we used to think and
[45:21] things we used to do but you know we've
[45:23] got to remember the day that Satan got
[45:24] drowned Hallelujah you know you know
[45:27] when we actually literally you know
[45:28] we're not literally but but ourselves
[45:30] because remember because when the blood
[45:31] of Jesus Christ God's Great Partners
[45:33] accepted into a life and that person
[45:35] gets baptized in the name of our Lord
[45:37] Jesus Christ they are showing not this
[45:40] not just this world but they're showing
[45:42] Heaven and Hell whose side they've
[45:44] picked amen and then also it's you know
[45:47] outward yo yo yo so it's an outward sign
[45:49] that an inward work has been done so
[45:51] that inward workers once upon a time
[45:53] when we were born Satan was on the
[45:55] throne of our heart he was ruling our
[45:57] life doesn't matter how moral we are how
[45:59] just we think we are what kind of a good
[46:01] person we think we are he was on the
[46:03] throne but they had to come a time where
[46:05] there was a revolution because he never
[46:06] meant to be on our Throne the Lord Jesus
[46:08] is meant to be on the throne of our
[46:09] heart so so God sends God sends his
[46:12] anointed word our way and then then a
[46:14] revolution takes place Faith begins to
[46:16] rise and the devil's cast out God comes
[46:18] in Hallelujah and then what happens is
[46:20] he's dethroned and then outwardly Now by
[46:23] that by baptism you're telling everyone
[46:25] you're all life is dead I mean to the
[46:28] works of the flesh are dead what used to
[46:29] govern you the spirit of the devil is
[46:31] dead out of your life and now you're now
[46:33] resurrected with the Lord walking in
[46:35] newness of life
[46:37] Hallelujah and it's very important where
[46:39] we go always go back to that spot where
[46:41] Satan got drowned it may not have been
[46:44] in the heart River may have been
[46:45] overseas somewhere but you've got to
[46:47] have a point in your life we can go back
[46:49] in your testimony and the Word was more
[46:51] than a story it was more than a history
[46:53] it's more than what brother Bram did or
[46:55] or or or the apostles or one of the
[46:57] prophets but God steps out of History to
[46:59] you and his word is quickened to your
[47:01] life and it comes to life in you and
[47:03] you're a new creature in Christ Jesus
[47:05] the supernatural work happens you've got
[47:07] to have that moment in your life amen
[47:09] where the word is more than quotes and
[47:11] ideas but it's a living reality because
[47:13] he is the word and he is alive forever
[47:16] more hallelujah we're going to realize
[47:18] there yeah we must have these spots
[47:21] amen now as many as believed were
[47:24] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ why
[47:26] would happen is because when the word
[47:27] you know Faith cometh by hearing and
[47:29] hearing the word of God and when the
[47:31] word comes into a life then Satan I
[47:33] believe is dethroned Hallelujah
[47:36] amen because we're going to realize that
[47:38] you know we have you know you know the
[47:40] Apostle Paul would say it like this in
[47:42] Romans 6. what shall we say then shall
[47:44] we continue in sin that Grace May abound
[47:45] God forbid how shall we that are dead to
[47:48] sin live any longer therein know ye not
[47:51] that so many of us as we're baptized
[47:52] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[47:54] death therefore we are buried with him
[47:56] by baptism into death that like us
[47:58] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[48:01] the glory of the father even so we
[48:02] should walk in newness of life for if we
[48:05] have been planted together in the
[48:07] likeness of his death we shall also be
[48:09] in the likeness of his resurrection
[48:10] knowing this that our old man is
[48:13] crucified with him that the body of sin
[48:15] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[48:17] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[48:19] is free from sin amen so now if you be
[48:22] dead with Christ we believe that we
[48:24] shall also live with him knowing that
[48:26] Christ being raised from the dead dieth
[48:28] no more
[48:29] death has no more dominion over him for
[48:32] in that he died he died unto sin once
[48:35] but in that he liveth he liveth unto God
[48:37] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[48:40] dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[48:43] through Jesus Christ Our Lord so there
[48:45] has to come a time when we reckon this
[48:47] right there's a revelation strikes our
[48:49] hearts actually I'm dead to sin
[48:51] you know I'm not a lot it doesn't live
[48:53] in my life anymore I'm dead to it amen
[48:55] I'm crucified to it it's crucified to me
[48:58] amen so so so so the effect of it's been
[49:01] killed to me and it's not part of me
[49:03] it's just it's just gone I mean because
[49:05] this word reckon means to take an
[49:07] inventory
[49:08] I mean it is an estimate it's to come to
[49:10] a conclusion
[49:11] so it's good to take an inventory
[49:14] Hallelujah a stock take is what you have
[49:16] on site right brother Kabir knows about
[49:18] stock tanks amen but yes but it's good
[49:20] to take an inventory of of what you have
[49:23] amen because when God comes in
[49:25] everything looks different who's had
[49:27] that experience the world looks
[49:28] different the birds chirp nicer and the
[49:31] sun's brighter and the leaves are
[49:32] Greener and the world is Lovelier and
[49:34] why because you've become a new creature
[49:36] Hallelujah but it's not just it's not
[49:39] just the world that seems different or
[49:41] your brother and sister that looks
[49:43] different it's your enemy looks
[49:45] different
[49:45] brother William says if you want to see
[49:47] God in his Universe you get God on the
[49:49] inside and you'll see God in his
[49:51] Universe right get him on the inside
[49:52] watch now the birds sing different in
[49:54] the trees even your enemy looks
[49:56] different when God comes on the inside
[49:58] amen he's in his Universe he's a new
[50:01] looking out showing you the Magnificent
[50:03] part of his universe but he says here
[50:04] you know even your enemy looks different
[50:06] when God comes on the inside so when God
[50:09] comes on the inside you can really see
[50:11] your enemy for who he is and what he is
[50:14] amen he looks totally different see
[50:15] before the enemy comes in he's this big
[50:19] powerful force that's just your slave
[50:21] master you can't beat him you can't
[50:23] outsmart him you try and turn a new Leaf
[50:25] he just turns it back you have all your
[50:27] good intentions he just throws it back
[50:28] at your face and he's a cruel being
[50:31] right this first birth we're born with
[50:33] is a cruel task master you know it'll
[50:36] it'll make you do things that you just
[50:37] live and regret you know how many people
[50:39] in this world they just live with years
[50:40] of regret I wish I didn't do this and I
[50:43] wish my marriage didn't break up because
[50:44] of this and I wish this didn't happen my
[50:46] family's like listen I lost my business
[50:48] because I did some selfish thing and
[50:50] this happened and people just live with
[50:51] years of regret now the believer's not
[50:54] meant to live with regret I mean because
[50:56] we've got to realize that all things
[50:57] work together for good those that love
[50:58] God and are called according to his
[51:00] purpose they might not seem good in the
[51:02] very moment that thing but it's working
[51:03] for your good amen it's bringing his
[51:05] character into your life I mean it's
[51:07] it's God used it to reveal himself in
[51:09] the trial Hallelujah but you see how
[51:12] many people live with regret we don't
[51:13] need to live with regret amen
[51:16] hallelujah amen see and then and then so
[51:19] the enemy
[51:20] he looks different you see him for who
[51:22] he is
[51:24] Hallelujah when you when you look at the
[51:26] enemy when God's on the inside you're
[51:28] actually looking through God's eyes
[51:29] he shows you through revelation of his
[51:31] word who the enemy is
[51:33] and you know it's like a spirit that
[51:35] torments fights in your mind a mind
[51:37] battle that seems so big so impossible
[51:39] that you cannot overcome it but when God
[51:41] comes on the inside you see it for what
[51:43] it is and what saint Isaiah 14 is as as
[51:46] as Isaiah would say about Lucifer son of
[51:49] the morning says you'll exalt yourself
[51:50] up you're on high but you'll be brought
[51:52] down to the sides of the pit
[51:54] you'll be brought down to Hell to the
[51:56] sides of the pit it says they that see
[51:58] thee shall narrowly look upon thee and
[52:00] consider thee saying is this the man
[52:02] that made the Earth to tremble that did
[52:03] Shake kingdoms that made the world as a
[52:06] Wilderness and destroyed the cities here
[52:08] all that open not the house of his
[52:09] prisoners so it says and they that see
[52:12] thee shall narrowly look upon thee so
[52:14] not everyone's going to see him not
[52:16] everyone sees the devil in this day you
[52:18] know the greatest thing an enemy can do
[52:20] is think that the one they want to
[52:22] destroy doesn't believe they exist
[52:25] amen that means that means you've won
[52:27] the battle because if your enemy doesn't
[52:28] even believe you exist you can do what
[52:30] you want and your enemy will blame me
[52:32] everything else but you for what you're
[52:33] doing you see but but it takes our eyes
[52:36] to come open to realize amen what the
[52:39] enemy's doing in this day and the word
[52:40] of God has exposed amen the enemy
[52:42] brother man says the opening of the
[52:44] seals exposed to Satan in his works
[52:46] praise the Lord so we're not ignorant to
[52:48] his devices amen we know what he's doing
[52:50] in this day and so we've been given eyes
[52:52] of Revelation to look upon him and see
[52:54] him for what he is because because I I
[52:57] do not believe this this scripture I
[52:59] just read is for on the other side when
[53:02] we're in glorified bodies I believe it's
[53:03] in this day we'll really see Satan say
[53:06] is this really the man is this really
[53:08] the spirit this anointed chair of the
[53:10] covereth that always come down Fallen as
[53:12] Satan done all these things is this
[53:13] really him that did weaken the Nations
[53:15] that yo made the world the Wilderness
[53:18] and the reason we can look down upon him
[53:19] and look at it like this is because
[53:20] we've been raised up especially in the
[53:23] expression places in Christ Jesus as far
[53:25] above him and we can see him for what he
[53:27] is there's not some big monster some big
[53:30] and you know your Invincible dragon
[53:33] but he's a defeated being under our feet
[53:35] was this the thing that tormented me all
[53:37] my life was this a spirit that troubled
[53:39] my grandfather now my father and now me
[53:42] and but now it's defeated was really
[53:43] just this alcoholic spirit that troubled
[53:45] my family the stubbornness or this Pride
[53:47] or indifference or whatever it was
[53:49] resentment this you know you know you
[53:52] see family traits
[53:54] those aren't personality traits those
[53:56] are spirits passed down but you see God
[53:59] has to have someone upon the Earth where
[54:01] that spirit is defeated right he will
[54:04] have a witness upon the Earth that they
[54:06] have a testimony that the spirit that
[54:08] seemed like it just felt like it could
[54:09] do whatever it wanted to me came to its
[54:12] end and it was now under my feet because
[54:14] remember it wasn't that just that
[54:16] generation of of Israel that was beaten
[54:18] by task Masters and slave drivers it was
[54:21] a generation before that they were 400
[54:22] years
[54:23] that was a long time that's longer than
[54:25] New Zealand's been a nation that we know
[54:27] it today it's longer than America's been
[54:29] a nation that's a very long time right
[54:32] so so this generation where slave
[54:34] masters and remember it wasn't just the
[54:35] men it was actually the spirits on them
[54:37] that was causing that see if those demon
[54:40] powers weren't on the Egyptians they
[54:42] wouldn't have beaten the Israelites you
[54:44] know it's not it's not in Man Without a
[54:46] demon anointing to do that to another
[54:48] man right it's it's a demon anointing
[54:51] that makes One race above the other and
[54:53] it tries to destroy races that's demon
[54:55] oppression that's a demon Spirit doing
[54:57] that you see so so it wasn't just the
[55:00] men it was the spirits passed down
[55:01] because remember well we know in the
[55:03] west like like you know in English names
[55:05] people have names like Baker and
[55:07] smirthing different names and and
[55:09] because that was the family business was
[55:12] passed down through a family so I'll say
[55:13] maybe the Egyptian Soul was great
[55:15] Granddad was a slave master now I'm a
[55:17] slave master and my son's going to be a
[55:19] slave master weak because it's the
[55:20] Family Trade it's what we do what the
[55:22] spirit has passed down generation to a
[55:24] generation and there's generations of
[55:27] Israelites that were beaten and
[55:28] oppressed but God was going to have a
[55:30] witness upon the Earth whether there be
[55:32] a generation rise up that this thing's
[55:34] going to stop and it's not going to be
[55:36] them that's going to stop it it's God's
[55:37] going to come upon the scene and bring a
[55:39] prophet to deliver Amen to bring them
[55:41] out of bondage and it's going to stop by
[55:43] God hallelujah that they would not
[55:45] wasn't them that brought themselves out
[55:46] of Egypt it wasn't them that drowned
[55:48] their slave masters it was God himself
[55:50] amen that did it Hallelujah and then so
[55:53] they could see those ones it was such a
[55:55] big difference the same man that was
[55:56] beating them a few days ago was the same
[55:59] one that was faced out in the Reds he
[56:00] drowned amen when when Israel came out
[56:03] of Egypt police they could look upon
[56:05] their enemy because remember God wants
[56:07] you to know your enemies being defeated
[56:09] he doesn't want you to live in fear
[56:11] saying one day your enemy can come and
[56:13] get you that's why he wanted to bring
[56:15] them to the Red Sea there remember God
[56:17] brought them there they weren't just
[56:19] running haphazard and found themselves
[56:21] in that place God told Moses you can go
[56:23] ready to walk here go here go here
[56:25] you'll end up here God LED them to that
[56:28] spot it wasn't Israel it wasn't Moses
[56:30] saying let's just run east and see where
[56:31] we get to no God ordain their steps and
[56:34] the Reason God did that is because God
[56:36] wanted to bring their enemy that tore me
[56:38] to them for generations to destruction
[56:40] that Israel would see that enemy can get
[56:42] me no more he's not going to cross the
[56:44] Red Sea after me because he can't get
[56:46] through the Red Sea and that's like it's
[56:48] like when we come through the blood of
[56:49] Jesus Christ those spirits that have
[56:51] been come down and taught me to just
[56:52] trouble us in our minds driven us around
[56:54] amen it is destroyed they are defeated
[56:56] they're cast back into hell where they
[56:58] belong why because the blood of Jesus
[57:00] Christ loses us from all sin amen it
[57:03] loses from all demon oppression it
[57:04] looses from all trouble Hallelujah
[57:06] that's why they could see because God
[57:08] wanted them to know their enemies
[57:10] defeated and God wants you to know when
[57:13] you come through the blood of Jesus
[57:14] Christ that tormenting spirit that drove
[57:17] your drove your life is no longer in
[57:19] control of your life that it's been
[57:20] drowned in the blood of Jesus Christ I
[57:22] mean that's why we can have a good
[57:24] old-fashioned Pentecostal meeting
[57:27] hallelujah we're making a dance on the
[57:29] Shore Bank when we look back into the
[57:30] blood of Jesus Christ and see our enemy
[57:32] is dead I mean because remember this is
[57:35] a message of restoration and of
[57:37] redemption amen and Redemption has two
[57:39] parts it's by Blood and it's by power I
[57:42] mean when they came out of Egypt they
[57:43] came under the blood of the Lamb by
[57:45] Blood but then it was by the power of
[57:46] God brought them out amen it's the same
[57:48] thing with his anointed word amen the
[57:51] blood of Jesus Christ has come I could
[57:52] say into full effect in this day amen he
[57:55] showed us in the life of brother Brown
[57:56] where a man could speak creation that no
[57:59] Spirit could stand before him and God
[58:00] was showing the world this is what
[58:02] Calvary achieves this is what my blood
[58:04] does it will take a redeemed son and
[58:07] show that no Spirit can stand against
[58:09] him and he's trying to show you this is
[58:12] what happens to a Christian when they
[58:14] come under the blood of Jesus Christ the
[58:16] Holy Ghost indwells him no Spirit can
[58:18] stand before them does not even cancer
[58:20] nothing that's the great thing of the
[58:22] fear of the age it can not stand before
[58:24] them Hallelujah and God can take that
[58:26] person and speak creation through the
[58:29] ellipse
[58:30] that's the power of the Cross it's
[58:32] nothing new it's the power of the Cross
[58:34] amen but God had to shout in this day
[58:36] because we're going to walk from this
[58:37] Dimension to another dimension I mean
[58:40] we're going in a Rapture Hallelujah
[58:42] amen so we're Redeemed by Blood and by
[58:45] power amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[58:47] I'm so thankful for that this morning
[58:50] Hallelujah they begin to dance because
[58:52] they saw that their enemy was dead
[58:56] Hallelujah and you've got to see I trust
[58:59] you've had you've had moments in your
[59:01] life where with that spirit that used to
[59:03] drive you because remember it says in
[59:04] Ephesians 2 we all walked according to
[59:07] the spirit of this world the prince of
[59:09] the power of the air Ephesians 2. we all
[59:10] had our our conversational manner of
[59:13] Life governed by that doesn't matter if
[59:15] you're raised in church you may have
[59:16] been birthed in this church you've still
[59:18] got to have a time where that Spirits
[59:19] cast out of your life and God takes the
[59:21] Throne of your heart Hallelujah so so so
[59:24] the enemy goes from being the king of
[59:26] your life to just now something trying
[59:28] to influence your life it's like when
[59:30] God's trying to get your attention
[59:32] calling you his Spirit influences you
[59:34] the devil may be on the throne but but
[59:36] God is influencing you and then he'll
[59:38] bring you to a spot of full surrender
[59:40] and then the devil's dethroned and God
[59:43] comes in and then now it's just the
[59:45] enemy trying to influence you
[59:46] and but God running your life
[59:50] Hallelujah
[59:51] so there's a big difference now
[59:54] between being tormented or being bound
[59:56] by a spirit
[59:58] and being and being bound by a memory of
[1:00:00] a dead Spirit those are two different
[1:00:02] things but the thing is those two things
[1:00:05] can govern you like it's you're still
[1:00:07] it's still in you
[1:00:09] right but there's two very big different
[1:00:11] things there so we don't want to be
[1:00:13] bound by a spirit of unbelief or by a
[1:00:16] memory of a dead spirit
[1:00:18] right because because it's so amazing
[1:00:20] the power of the Mind
[1:00:21] the power of our human Spirit can can
[1:00:24] can actually bring sickness Upon Our
[1:00:26] Lives father Brownwood would would have
[1:00:28] many times people in the prayer line
[1:00:30] and then and then and then he began of
[1:00:33] course the Lord would show him what is
[1:00:34] what is happening in their lives and
[1:00:36] he'd say to one this isn't he him in
[1:00:37] 1956 he says you have a very strange
[1:00:41] nature that is a deep thinker you're
[1:00:43] always Crossing Bridges before you get
[1:00:45] to it it's always a bad thing never
[1:00:48] happens the way you plan it to happen
[1:00:50] and by that it's developed a peptic
[1:00:53] condition in the stomach giving you
[1:00:54] stomach trouble that's right isn't it
[1:00:57] sir if that is right raise your hand is
[1:00:59] that right nothing couldn't be nothing
[1:01:01] else God Almighty knows it you now throw
[1:01:04] aside every negative thoughts and go
[1:01:06] home and eat your supper and praise God
[1:01:08] and give him praise for it so so this
[1:01:10] man was a deep thinker but in his mind
[1:01:13] it was always negative so every bridge
[1:01:15] he had crossed in his mind what's going
[1:01:16] to happen next well it's going to be
[1:01:17] negative there's going to be trouble you
[1:01:19] know and this works so much in his
[1:01:21] Spirit it gave him stomach trouble so he
[1:01:23] couldn't eat his food no more so maybe
[1:01:25] just thinking man something's wrong with
[1:01:26] my stomach but actually what was wrong
[1:01:27] is he's being tormented by a spirit a
[1:01:30] spirit was anointing his mind so you've
[1:01:32] got to watch where your thoughts go are
[1:01:34] they positive thoughts of Faith or
[1:01:35] negative or unbelief where are your
[1:01:37] thoughts going see it depends what
[1:01:39] you're you know because the devil will
[1:01:40] enter into a conversation with you and
[1:01:42] he wants you to respond and he knows how
[1:01:45] you're white he knows how you think so
[1:01:46] he always try and use how you're built
[1:01:48] remember he studies you
[1:01:50] yeah he studied you he studied your
[1:01:52] parents your grandparents your
[1:01:53] great-grandparents you're all the way
[1:01:54] studied you know he's got a file on
[1:01:56] everyone he knows how you're built and
[1:01:58] so he will use how you're made how God
[1:02:00] actually made you and wanted you to be
[1:02:02] against you amen so so here's a man you
[1:02:05] know he's got this yo he's always has
[1:02:06] these negative thoughts now always you
[1:02:09] know always bad things and it's made
[1:02:11] it's given him a stomach condition
[1:02:13] so that's why brother says now you just
[1:02:15] throw aside your negative thoughts go
[1:02:17] home and eat your supper and praise God
[1:02:20] you've got to throw aside your thinking
[1:02:23] and start thinking a different way
[1:02:25] why because his thinking had given him a
[1:02:28] a a a physical trouble that's how
[1:02:31] powerful this human spirit is
[1:02:34] right so now now how much more then if
[1:02:37] we're Bound by the memory of a dead
[1:02:40] spirit
[1:02:41] see
[1:02:43] there's such a lie in the world today
[1:02:45] that we had to spend years working
[1:02:47] through problems
[1:02:48] with the spend years working through
[1:02:50] things
[1:02:52] no I just say no that's not how it works
[1:02:55] the only thing you've got to work
[1:02:56] through is actually exposing the devil
[1:02:59] and when he's exposed he can be cast out
[1:03:01] see but if you always say because you
[1:03:03] know this is not this is not something
[1:03:05] you just kind of merge in it's not like
[1:03:07] slow moving traffic
[1:03:09] you know like a traffic jam like we're
[1:03:10] going up to otaki in holidays you know
[1:03:12] you're going 20K now and there's the
[1:03:14] merge you're slowly going into it and
[1:03:16] then you slowly go but it takes a long
[1:03:17] time
[1:03:18] you're slowly going into it and you
[1:03:20] slowly go out of it it takes years no no
[1:03:22] with God you just go through the merch
[1:03:24] and it's done and you're not traveling
[1:03:26] at 20 you're going at 100. amen so it's
[1:03:29] not just all these things troubling you
[1:03:30] no more it's actually no no you're free
[1:03:33] but the thing is what has to happen is
[1:03:35] is that spirit because the devil hates
[1:03:37] to be exposed he but when he's exposed
[1:03:40] he can be cast out
[1:03:42] he is he always needs a human shield
[1:03:45] the devil must have someone to work
[1:03:47] through and he needs a human shield to
[1:03:49] hide behind as soon as soon as he's
[1:03:52] exposed he can be shot amen he can be
[1:03:54] taken out right but the thing is he will
[1:03:57] use the human shield and how he uses
[1:04:00] human Shields as reasoning
[1:04:02] you know I think well well well you know
[1:04:04] this is just how it's meant to be this
[1:04:06] is how my parents were and well if you
[1:04:08] only knew my past you'd know why I'm
[1:04:09] this way reasoning keeps them there but
[1:04:12] if you realize actually whom the sun is
[1:04:14] set free is free indeed I don't have to
[1:04:16] live bound I don't have to be dictated
[1:04:18] to by my past I can walk in units of
[1:04:21] life then you can expose the enemy
[1:04:24] I mean you start to feel uncomfortable
[1:04:26] when you've been going to talk a line of
[1:04:27] conversation you know God's beginning to
[1:04:30] discern your thoughts and you get
[1:04:31] uncomfortable that's the devil getting
[1:04:32] uncomfortable
[1:04:34] and he wants to hide try and shut down
[1:04:36] that conversation when you feel
[1:04:37] uncomfortable don't just shut it down
[1:04:39] open it up
[1:04:40] cause the enemy because because he's
[1:04:42] making you feel that way because he's
[1:04:43] going to be exposed you know people get
[1:04:46] angry mad sad or glad it's because the
[1:04:48] enemy's being exposed or if you're glad
[1:04:50] the enemy's not exposed you're free but
[1:04:53] if you're mad or sad you know upset well
[1:04:55] this and this happened and this no it'll
[1:04:57] come down actually this is a stronghold
[1:04:59] of the enemy it doesn't belong in my
[1:05:01] ground I want a full renovation
[1:05:04] oh look I'm not just gonna you know
[1:05:06] you've seen pictures of like China
[1:05:07] there's like this big big freeway and
[1:05:09] then there's this house in the middle of
[1:05:11] it because that person refuses to sell
[1:05:12] who's seen that kind of thing it's like
[1:05:15] eight Lanes each way then there's this
[1:05:17] house in the middle This Old House
[1:05:18] there's like a wall around it because
[1:05:20] that person refused to sell and now now
[1:05:22] that whole I'm not I'm not saying it's
[1:05:24] good they built the motorway whatever
[1:05:25] but you know it's like the devil he
[1:05:27] refuses to sell
[1:05:29] he wants his house in here he's used to
[1:05:32] living there he used to living in that
[1:05:33] complex in that stronghold you know but
[1:05:36] but but we serve a God and it's up to
[1:05:38] you though are you willing to let him
[1:05:39] keep his house there you've got to
[1:05:40] divert traffic around the problem or
[1:05:42] he's going to bulldoze that thing down
[1:05:44] and by the Holy Ghost and take him out
[1:05:46] completely
[1:05:48] I mean because many times we always
[1:05:50] doctor symptoms and we don't go to the
[1:05:52] root cause
[1:05:54] right we always talk about symptoms but
[1:05:56] what's the root cause you say well I
[1:05:58] just can't forgive that person because
[1:05:59] they did this and this and this happened
[1:06:01] you know what they said here that's all
[1:06:02] symptoms what's the root cause
[1:06:04] unforgiveness you got to take out the
[1:06:07] root cause you can you can baby the
[1:06:08] symptoms all the days you want but it
[1:06:10] won't help you nothing I mean you've got
[1:06:12] to come down and get rid of the root
[1:06:14] cause what is it unforgiveness and it
[1:06:15] pride is a big thing
[1:06:17] Pride will Pride will manifest itself in
[1:06:19] many different ways a Pity party's Pride
[1:06:22] no because Pride always wants to draw
[1:06:24] attention to oneself but a Christian
[1:06:26] wants your attention to one I'm in the
[1:06:29] Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so we've
[1:06:31] got to you know so
[1:06:34] if you're not free of those things the
[1:06:36] Lord is here to free
[1:06:37] right but if you've been freed of if you
[1:06:39] can go back in your life and say I
[1:06:41] remember that day I remember that hour
[1:06:43] where the Lord came in and the devil was
[1:06:45] cast out
[1:06:46] Hallelujah then all that can happen now
[1:06:49] is it's the memory of a dead Spirit can
[1:06:52] torment you
[1:06:54] and the reason that that can happen is
[1:06:56] because people say well you've got to
[1:06:57] work through things now
[1:07:00] no you don't need to work through
[1:07:01] nothing as I said the only thing you
[1:07:03] need to work through is actually
[1:07:04] exposing that into me praying and it's
[1:07:06] cast out they're now walking units of
[1:07:08] life
[1:07:09] amens it's not just okay so you so you
[1:07:11] have some counseling whatever you pray
[1:07:12] God comes on the scene and then you've
[1:07:14] got to work through it again no no
[1:07:15] you've just got to see see the children
[1:07:17] of Israel were working they didn't
[1:07:19] reckon they were free
[1:07:21] let's go back to Egypt why did you bring
[1:07:23] us out here to die Moses why'd you do
[1:07:25] this and all this trouble and they
[1:07:27] forgot the very God that brought them
[1:07:28] out was leading them right God didn't
[1:07:31] say now walk that way and I'll catch up
[1:07:33] later he said no God will send his Angel
[1:07:35] before you and you've got to follow him
[1:07:37] here's the pillar of Fire by night and A
[1:07:39] Cloud by day and they had to follow him
[1:07:41] so God went before them right Hallelujah
[1:07:44] so it's the same thing with us we're
[1:07:46] going to realize that he he he wants to
[1:07:48] lead us
[1:07:49] Hallelujah he doesn't just send us on
[1:07:52] our way and then that's it amen but no
[1:07:55] but you see the devil hates to be
[1:07:57] exposed
[1:07:59] amen he hates to be exposed now
[1:08:02] brother M sees this in the revelation of
[1:08:04] Jesus Christ is now see the carnal mind
[1:08:06] shuns it because the carnal mind knows
[1:08:09] not one thing about it what's that the
[1:08:10] supernatural power of God no wonder the
[1:08:12] carnal mind does not because it's Satan
[1:08:14] in that carnal mind
[1:08:15] and Satan is exposed and Satan does not
[1:08:18] want himself exposed you notice how
[1:08:20] horrible it is for Satan when he thinks
[1:08:22] he's going to be exposed watching one of
[1:08:24] the services watch the action of the
[1:08:26] people you watch out on the meeting just
[1:08:28] for Satan's going to be exposed over a
[1:08:30] certain person you see their face
[1:08:31] changing you see they don't know what to
[1:08:33] think all at once the Holy Spirit comes
[1:08:35] down exposes that devil oh he hates that
[1:08:37] kind of a meeting that's the reason
[1:08:39] we've had such a battle because the word
[1:08:41] of God exposes the devil see tells what
[1:08:45] he is now many people think well if I
[1:08:48] could just go back to brother Baron's
[1:08:50] day God will discern my life and I can
[1:08:51] walk free but you know the word of God
[1:08:53] is still a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:08:54] tense of the heart amen he is still in
[1:08:57] the Discerning business he's still in
[1:08:58] the business of exposing the devil in
[1:09:01] our lives see many times the preacher
[1:09:03] will stand up here or other ministers
[1:09:05] who are called by God and they'll preach
[1:09:06] along a certain line they have no idea
[1:09:08] why they're going that way God knows why
[1:09:10] they're going that way because you need
[1:09:12] it to go that way I mean because God
[1:09:14] knows what we have need of praise the
[1:09:16] Lord aren't you glad that he's mindful
[1:09:17] but we've got to by faith say I receive
[1:09:19] that Lord and walk on with it amen amen
[1:09:22] is no law yes no good just sitting there
[1:09:24] as an armchair commentator at the end of
[1:09:26] a match saying well this happened and
[1:09:28] this happened and wow that was spoken
[1:09:29] and can't believe he preached out in my
[1:09:31] life no you can't just talk about it
[1:09:33] you've got to absorb it you'll let God
[1:09:35] change your life
[1:09:36] hallelujah amen because remember it says
[1:09:39] in Hebrews 4 and 12 for the word of God
[1:09:41] is quick and Powerful sharper than any
[1:09:43] two-edged sword piercing even to
[1:09:45] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit in
[1:09:47] the joints and of the joints and Marrow
[1:09:49] and as a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:09:51] Tents of the heart amen so the word of
[1:09:54] God divides I'll put it this way between
[1:09:56] your soul the real you and the spirit of
[1:09:58] the enemy
[1:10:00] see what happens is if we think the
[1:10:02] enemies works for us we'll never be free
[1:10:04] of it because who's going to cut their
[1:10:06] arm off right you know it's like if I
[1:10:08] think this phone is actually physically
[1:10:10] part of me and you say we're going to
[1:10:11] get rid of that photo say no you can't
[1:10:13] take part of me away because it's part
[1:10:15] of me right but but but but if you
[1:10:18] actually give me the Revelation no it's
[1:10:19] not physically part of you you can be
[1:10:21] free of it if you want to I'll say man
[1:10:23] this thing is such a curse you know I'm
[1:10:25] just using as an example you know it's
[1:10:26] such a curse please take it from me and
[1:10:28] you'll gladly give it up but you see if
[1:10:30] you think that just be having a stubborn
[1:10:32] spirit and being unforgiving and you
[1:10:34] know yo yo you're holding resentment and
[1:10:36] just always well I've got to fuss
[1:10:37] against someone you know there's always
[1:10:39] because it's about and thinking oh well
[1:10:40] I've always got to have a mind battle
[1:10:42] and all these things if you think well
[1:10:43] that's just how you're built you'll
[1:10:45] never be free of it but if you realize
[1:10:46] it's the enemy you can say Lord take
[1:10:48] this thing from me because it's not part
[1:10:49] of me I mean Jesus would say that I have
[1:10:52] no pardon the devil he has no pardon me
[1:10:54] right but the thing is because we are
[1:10:56] born with a spiritual Amnesia God has to
[1:10:59] reveal himself to us as he walks with us
[1:11:01] and he reveals who we are and who the
[1:11:04] enemy is in our lives
[1:11:05] Hallelujah and you're glad that the word
[1:11:07] of God can actually divide
[1:11:09] amen between Soul and Spirit between
[1:11:12] even even the soul and your own emotion
[1:11:15] hardly because why the devil hides an
[1:11:17] emotion
[1:11:18] amen I'm so thankful that his word
[1:11:20] divides between us
[1:11:23] and the enemy that we can see things
[1:11:26] that are actually not the not actually
[1:11:28] part of us that we can be free of it
[1:11:29] amen who's following me so far and I'm
[1:11:32] so thankful we can look into the word of
[1:11:34] God and and look at this law of perfect
[1:11:36] Liberty we say this is my portion
[1:11:38] anything less of this is not my portion
[1:11:40] I don't want it
[1:11:41] Hallelujah so we don't need brother
[1:11:43] Brown to come back and discern Hearts
[1:11:45] again the word of God Jesus Christ
[1:11:47] himself amen does it through the
[1:11:49] ministry and through the bride of Christ
[1:11:51] Amen brother van was saying Christ is a
[1:11:53] mystery God revealed he says well uh
[1:11:55] does not uh Hebrews the fourth chapter
[1:11:57] say the word of God is quicker and
[1:11:59] sharper than a two-edged sword and can
[1:12:01] discern the very thoughts of the mind
[1:12:02] and he was that word and when that word
[1:12:05] is preeminence in the man the same thing
[1:12:07] takes place again for it's the word Amy
[1:12:10] to saying he doesn't say preeminence in
[1:12:11] the prophet preeminence in the man
[1:12:13] preeminence in you and I am in the word
[1:12:15] of God can come and discern
[1:12:17] separate between the soul are you with
[1:12:20] me holy that's why it's so powerful if
[1:12:22] God has preeminence in our life then the
[1:12:24] Lord can use us to actually expose the
[1:12:26] enemy
[1:12:27] not our favorite preacher no no not not
[1:12:31] someone from overseas it can be in our
[1:12:33] midst in our own lives when God has when
[1:12:35] his word has preeminence that he is
[1:12:37] number one and our feelings our opinions
[1:12:39] what we think our cultural background
[1:12:41] our upbring whatever that takes second
[1:12:43] place amen and God's word is always
[1:12:45] right Hallelujah who wants to be that
[1:12:47] kind of a life I mean that a trouble
[1:12:49] comes up in your home and your family
[1:12:52] whatever and God can discern this is
[1:12:53] really what's going on through you
[1:12:55] Hallelujah I am in paragraph 283 if you
[1:12:59] want that from Christ The Mystery of God
[1:13:00] revealed I mean and when that word is
[1:13:01] preeminist in the man the same thing
[1:13:02] takes place again for it is the word
[1:13:06] Hallelujah
[1:13:08] amen see we have to come to a come to a
[1:13:11] place I'm going to come back to what I
[1:13:13] really want to talk about I just want to
[1:13:14] lay this as a foundation now so we have
[1:13:16] to come to a place where Where We Know
[1:13:18] The Enemy by his attacks amen where
[1:13:21] where we can see that any any spirit
[1:13:24] or any person who tries to disagree with
[1:13:26] God's word remember that's your enemy
[1:13:28] and when and you know when it's a person
[1:13:30] it's not the person it's your enemy it's
[1:13:32] the spirit on the person
[1:13:33] so you're going to realize that anything
[1:13:34] that puts a question mark over God's
[1:13:36] word that's the enemy doing that right
[1:13:39] because God never puts a question mark
[1:13:41] on his word he puts a name in he says
[1:13:43] yes that's me that's true amen it's
[1:13:45] alive it's for you Hallelujah
[1:13:48] amen but you see now we all have a pass
[1:13:51] as I've said
[1:13:52] and our past if we let the enemy can
[1:13:55] torment us when we forget that we've
[1:13:57] been freed
[1:13:58] now Rahab had a past
[1:14:01] Rahab had a real past
[1:14:03] e the Lord now she was living remember
[1:14:05] she was Rahab the holler brother says in
[1:14:08] one place it was actually her parents
[1:14:09] put her out into that livelihood to
[1:14:11] support them
[1:14:12] and so Rahab Rahab had a past now now
[1:14:16] she's Rahab the Harlot but you see when
[1:14:18] she heard the testimonies of what God
[1:14:20] did Amen in in Egypt parting the Red Sea
[1:14:24] the plagues all those different things
[1:14:25] and you know and when the Israelites
[1:14:27] defeated the uh two kings the ammonites
[1:14:30] you know Argan Bashan or what um oh no
[1:14:33] sorry the two kings the amorites seahon
[1:14:36] and OG you know
[1:14:37] she somehow she realized well she
[1:14:39] realized that that Israel's were in the
[1:14:42] path of Israel Israel is going to take
[1:14:44] Jericho and take the promised land he
[1:14:46] you know she said that the heart of all
[1:14:48] the men of war and things in the city is
[1:14:50] gone because of them
[1:14:51] see the fear of God falls on the devil
[1:14:55] when you walk towards him
[1:14:58] well you may not realize that he said
[1:14:59] well I'm just a believer I'm just no no
[1:15:01] no if God is in you the devil shakes
[1:15:04] when you come close see it shouldn't be
[1:15:06] us being afraid of him no he's afraid of
[1:15:09] us amen but you see he uses fear and
[1:15:12] intimidation to get us to think he's
[1:15:13] bigger than you he ain't bigger than you
[1:15:15] amen you're bigger than him and the
[1:15:17] reason you're bigger than him because
[1:15:18] you got the biggest daddy for Hallelujah
[1:15:20] and your daddy can beat up anyone else
[1:15:22] in existence right so you know you know
[1:15:24] your kids will say my daddy's bigger
[1:15:26] than your daddy my daddy is going to
[1:15:27] beat you up well we've got the biggest
[1:15:28] daddy Harley and he defeated the devil
[1:15:31] that down Calvary hallelujah amen so the
[1:15:33] enemy is actually afraid of you amen
[1:15:36] amen when you get to when you realize
[1:15:38] who you are and you're the most powerful
[1:15:40] people in the world you're not just some
[1:15:42] pushed out groups somewhere no you're
[1:15:44] the most powerful people in the world
[1:15:45] the reason this world has not fallen
[1:15:47] into other chaos is because of you
[1:15:48] you're still here hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:51] you realize that the UN has nothing on
[1:15:54] you amen amen you think you know you
[1:15:56] know they're trying to arm the Ukraine
[1:15:57] all these things get weapons of war and
[1:15:59] try and develop Hypersonic missiles
[1:16:01] you're better than a Hypersonic missile
[1:16:02] you're more powerful than the whole
[1:16:04] arsenals of of all the armies of the
[1:16:06] world you are one prayer can change the
[1:16:07] whole world and God inspires you
[1:16:09] Hallelujah so we're going to realize
[1:16:11] that we are not defeated we're not alone
[1:16:13] our God is with us
[1:16:16] Hallelujah so so Rahab Rahab would
[1:16:19] testify to the two
[1:16:21] um spies about about the condition of
[1:16:23] the city about about what their God did
[1:16:25] for them in Egypt different things and
[1:16:27] it's amazing because judgment was coming
[1:16:29] to her City but somehow because Faith
[1:16:31] Rose in her heart see there must be
[1:16:33] Mercy there somewhere this God of Wrath
[1:16:36] is coming amen this you know destroying
[1:16:38] Angels coming Joshua and the armies of
[1:16:40] Israel are coming where we're toast but
[1:16:42] there's got to be mercy here somewhere
[1:16:43] for me Hallelujah so so here she was
[1:16:46] this this this Harlot asked for mercy
[1:16:49] and she obtained Mercy Hallelujah see no
[1:16:53] when true faith comes in that Jesus
[1:16:56] Christ is the Lord God Almighty and he's
[1:16:57] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:16:59] what happens is the first cry that comes
[1:17:01] out of that heart is Lord there must be
[1:17:03] Mercy for me
[1:17:04] that was her first question surely there
[1:17:07] must be somewhere and
[1:17:10] and then the Spy said well you just you
[1:17:12] just get in your house this Scarlet
[1:17:13] chord you have this token put it out
[1:17:15] your window and everyone who gets under
[1:17:17] this token shall be saved amen see so so
[1:17:20] you look at her life it was once she was
[1:17:23] she was governed by that last spirit
[1:17:24] that took her into halatory right she
[1:17:26] was being driven by the spirit but when
[1:17:28] Faith came that thing was cast out of
[1:17:30] her life and now what was actually Faith
[1:17:32] was motivating her it wasn't unbelief
[1:17:34] motivating her going into the Heart Tree
[1:17:36] life no it was Faith to get her family
[1:17:38] in I mean that was the thing that was
[1:17:40] driving her
[1:17:41] Hallelujah and then we know the rest of
[1:17:44] the story Israel walked around Jericho
[1:17:46] and everything in Jericho was destroyed
[1:17:50] all the men that she slept with all the
[1:17:52] horrible things she did that was all
[1:17:55] dead
[1:17:55] Hallelujah because God knows how to get
[1:17:58] rid of your past amen and it wasn't just
[1:18:00] this men that were destroyed it was
[1:18:02] actually the spirit on her and on them
[1:18:03] got cast out they were gone they had
[1:18:06] known to work through anymore
[1:18:07] Hallelujah so she could look back you
[1:18:10] know you think about that when when when
[1:18:11] when the Wolves fell down flat and her
[1:18:14] and her house was on the top of the wall
[1:18:16] and it came down to ground level and it
[1:18:19] was all fine and the people were fine
[1:18:21] and they walked out Holly and the two
[1:18:23] spies came in and got them out and yo yo
[1:18:25] they saw the destruction of Jericho
[1:18:26] they'd say
[1:18:28] we have walked into a new world
[1:18:31] we've walked into a new world we may be
[1:18:33] living in the same place but this is a
[1:18:35] totally different world because now the
[1:18:37] lord god Jehovah is in control of this
[1:18:40] world and it's not Pagan idolatry it's
[1:18:42] not a spirit of lust driving me no more
[1:18:44] I'm free well hallelujah we're under the
[1:18:47] under the leadership of Joshua amen
[1:18:50] praise God so she walked into a new
[1:18:52] world so so the only thing she could be
[1:18:54] tormented by was by flashbacks
[1:18:58] of her past
[1:19:00] she didn't have to work through nothing
[1:19:02] she was free
[1:19:04] you see and then her Freedom was further
[1:19:06] cemented because she she married Salman
[1:19:09] who was one of the princes of Judah
[1:19:11] hello so she married into the tribe of
[1:19:14] Israel right and to the tribe of Judah
[1:19:16] and so her identity was normal what she
[1:19:19] was but now what she became
[1:19:21] Hallelujah and that was her defining
[1:19:23] moment in her life it wasn't her past it
[1:19:26] was her present and her future by that
[1:19:28] Union with Solomon amen she was a
[1:19:30] totally new creature hallelujah it's the
[1:19:33] same thing with you and I I trust I
[1:19:34] trust you're following me today I trust
[1:19:36] we can go to the Red Sea and do a dance
[1:19:38] Hallelujah we can see our enemies
[1:19:40] actually dead amen and it's just a it's
[1:19:42] just a torment
[1:19:45] of a memory
[1:19:46] that can control us now
[1:19:49] it's not it's not our it's not who we
[1:19:52] see we're not that person if you've
[1:19:53] really met God
[1:19:55] you're a new person you're a new
[1:19:57] creature you're not the old the old you
[1:19:59] is gone God drowned he's gone she's gone
[1:20:01] enter the sea into the garbage dump you
[1:20:04] know they're in the Pacific you know the
[1:20:05] current's taking them far away and
[1:20:07] you're not going to go dredge that
[1:20:08] person up Hallelujah you don't want that
[1:20:11] person back amen because you're a new
[1:20:13] creature you've been transformed
[1:20:15] hallelujah amen so she could she could
[1:20:18] only be tormented worth by memories
[1:20:23] now if someone told her well you know
[1:20:25] you've just got to work through this now
[1:20:28] what happens that resurrects it just
[1:20:30] makes those memories more real
[1:20:33] but she could just say hold on
[1:20:35] you think of the wedding day I don't
[1:20:36] know how the Jews do it exactly but you
[1:20:38] know it used to be back in the day that
[1:20:40] the um that the minister would say well
[1:20:41] if anyone has any cause that this Union
[1:20:44] should not go ahead speak now forever
[1:20:46] hold your peace can you imagine there'd
[1:20:48] be some Israelite girls have been
[1:20:49] watching Salomon all the way through the
[1:20:51] Wilderness you know we're going to marry
[1:20:53] him I'm going to be the one he's a
[1:20:55] prince man he's loaded you know he's
[1:20:57] he's got all the money I'm gonna you
[1:20:59] know I'm gonna marry into royalty I fit
[1:21:01] the bill look I'm a daughter of Abraham
[1:21:03] done nothing wrong being in the church
[1:21:05] perfect believer you know here I am in
[1:21:07] the young people's doing all kinds of
[1:21:08] things I'm going to marry that man and
[1:21:10] then Here Comes This Here Comes This
[1:21:11] Harlot woman
[1:21:13] that got saved out of Jericho she
[1:21:15] doesn't deserve Mercy see if you have
[1:21:16] never received Mercy you can't give
[1:21:18] Mercy she she has no right she should be
[1:21:20] a slave she should be a slave in Israel
[1:21:22] that's it but God has a way of putting
[1:21:25] people together
[1:21:27] amen because remember we are remember
[1:21:28] the brighter crisis shown in types and
[1:21:30] shadows in the scripture right and we
[1:21:32] live according to our types right amen
[1:21:34] so here she is she's you know at the
[1:21:36] altar with salmon the Rabbi says these
[1:21:38] things maybe one of the young Israelite
[1:21:40] girls who who thought I'm gonna get him
[1:21:42] just stands up can't hold it anymore
[1:21:44] don't you know what she did don't you
[1:21:47] know what she did and maybe someone
[1:21:48] would have said hold on
[1:21:50] where are the men
[1:21:52] where are those that did the crime bring
[1:21:54] them where are they they're Six Feet
[1:21:56] Under
[1:21:57] they're dead they're gone there's no
[1:22:00] more living witness because God took
[1:22:01] care of her past that she could walk on
[1:22:04] in her future hopefully it's the same
[1:22:06] thing with you and I God wants you to
[1:22:07] know he's taking care of your past
[1:22:09] remember the sin question was settle
[1:22:12] that down Calvary in his mind and his
[1:22:14] heart isn't settled in yours
[1:22:16] hallelujah amen so she could walk on she
[1:22:19] married Salman and her past didn't
[1:22:22] dictate her future
[1:22:25] Hallelujah and if she ever got
[1:22:27] flashbacks
[1:22:30] and you know someone came along and said
[1:22:32] well you've just got to work through it
[1:22:33] what does that do just try and resurrect
[1:22:35] those spirits
[1:22:37] no
[1:22:39] we're free
[1:22:41] there's a demarcation in life
[1:22:43] where the old you once lived and then
[1:22:46] that person dies because you're United
[1:22:48] to another right and now a new life is
[1:22:51] living amen you're walking in newness of
[1:22:53] life
[1:22:54] Hallelujah so she could always go back
[1:22:56] it's in a hold on I miss a salmon of
[1:22:59] Judah
[1:23:01] this is who I am now this is who God saw
[1:23:04] me to be amen not who I was it's who I
[1:23:07] am that defines me how about you right
[1:23:09] now is it is it is it your past I say oh
[1:23:12] people say you've just got to work
[1:23:13] through something no all you need to do
[1:23:15] is expose the enemy get him cast out and
[1:23:18] walk on in Freedom realizing that your
[1:23:21] past doesn't have to hold you back
[1:23:23] well so many things happen well no our
[1:23:26] defining what you define us in our life
[1:23:29] he found me
[1:23:30] he found me this message found me Jesus
[1:23:33] Christ stepped out of history and he
[1:23:35] found me maybe it's through a booklet
[1:23:37] through a table through a preacher what
[1:23:38] it was but Jesus found me amen we went
[1:23:41] more from more than a story and this is
[1:23:43] where I'm born and this is this is my
[1:23:45] parents and this is all these things but
[1:23:46] they know he found me and I could cry
[1:23:49] Abba Father my father my father you know
[1:23:51] actually who you are who you came from
[1:23:53] because if you're real because remember
[1:23:54] people people always look for their
[1:23:57] origin
[1:23:58] and then they become more like the
[1:24:00] origin than maybe they would have
[1:24:01] normally you know you know you're
[1:24:04] because why they're looking for identity
[1:24:05] and what does this message do it gives
[1:24:08] us identity it gives us a Heavenly
[1:24:10] identity a true identity that we are
[1:24:13] Sons and Daughters of the most high God
[1:24:15] Amen that we're not just from this world
[1:24:17] here no we're from Heaven amen we came
[1:24:19] from God and we're going back to God
[1:24:21] Amen and if we came from God and going
[1:24:24] back to God God's the power of his blood
[1:24:26] loses us that the enemy has no hope no
[1:24:30] more we're a free people
[1:24:32] Hallelujah so so we have to reckon as I
[1:24:35] said from uh Romans 6. wrecking
[1:24:39] yourselves also to be dead indeed unto
[1:24:40] sin but alive through God I mean unto
[1:24:43] God through Jesus Christ Our Lord we're
[1:24:45] going to take inventory
[1:24:47] don't be don't be don't be governed by
[1:24:50] by flashbacks
[1:24:52] well then why do I still remember
[1:24:53] because the reason we're still allowed
[1:24:55] to remember is because God God wants us
[1:24:57] to be thankful
[1:25:00] Hallelujah because if you are thankful
[1:25:02] for you from where you came from
[1:25:04] Hallelujah I mean you'll be thankful to
[1:25:06] where you're going
[1:25:08] Hallelujah why because you can Rejoice
[1:25:10] thank you God I maybe not what I want to
[1:25:12] be
[1:25:13] but thank God I'm not what I used to be
[1:25:16] Hallelujah that's the main thing you
[1:25:17] know maybe you know I see the word I see
[1:25:19] the fullness of the Statue of Christ and
[1:25:20] I see what the bride is meant to be well
[1:25:22] you know and say Lord I want to become
[1:25:25] that hey we're still maturing we're
[1:25:27] still growing we're still walking right
[1:25:30] but thank God we're not what we used to
[1:25:31] be the Lord has taken us higher he
[1:25:34] smolders uh our character has changed us
[1:25:36] amen so we can now walk on
[1:25:39] that we don't have to be bound
[1:25:41] by our old life Hallelujah
[1:25:46] amen
[1:25:48] praise God
[1:25:50] Hallelujah we can we can walk free
[1:25:55] amen now
[1:25:58] he says and by faith Moses if you're a
[1:26:00] sinner raise up your eyes and look now
[1:26:01] if you've been indifferent if you've had
[1:26:03] little squabbles and little things what
[1:26:05] make what difference does it make you're
[1:26:07] going to die one of these days what day
[1:26:09] maybe today you don't know now from now
[1:26:11] you may be in Hell or you may be in
[1:26:12] heaven but you have got to choose now
[1:26:15] if there's anything in your life that
[1:26:17] isn't right you choose Now by faith you
[1:26:19] say well I just can't get even with her
[1:26:22] I can't get even with him no matter what
[1:26:24] they've done choose life choose life for
[1:26:27] Jesus said of your heart
[1:26:29] and from your heart you don't forgive
[1:26:31] every person their transgression neither
[1:26:33] does your heavenly father forgive you so
[1:26:35] just get that close if there's one order
[1:26:38] in your heart against any person sinner
[1:26:40] or Saint you're in danger of Hellfire

[1:26:58] morning what where are you allowing your
[1:27:00] imagination to go I mean your memories
[1:27:03] to go because remember the devil will
[1:27:04] always take our memories and say look
[1:27:07] what you were
[1:27:08] but then it never updates to me I know
[1:27:10] I've said it a lot but you know there's
[1:27:11] power in this mind
[1:27:13] you're going to think about the true and
[1:27:15] right things of the word of God because
[1:27:16] remember the devil take us always back
[1:27:18] to our deepest darkest failures but then
[1:27:21] he never takes us to his deepest darkest
[1:27:24] failure what was his deepest darkest
[1:27:26] failure he took the Prince of Life and
[1:27:29] he crucified him on Calvary releasing
[1:27:31] eternal life to the world the blood of
[1:27:33] Jesus Christ was shed upon the Earth to
[1:27:35] redeem us back to God that was the
[1:27:37] devil's greatest failure he thought he
[1:27:39] had him that day amen then he sat down
[1:27:41] on his lazy boy with his with his coffee
[1:27:44] down in Hell thinking finally it's done
[1:27:46] and I've won the day and he just he just
[1:27:47] he just earned himself his greatest
[1:27:49] defeat I mean because the Son of God
[1:27:51] came down booted in the dark take the
[1:27:53] keys of Hell death and the grave of
[1:27:55] Satan and then Rose triumphant
[1:27:56] Hallelujah see you've got to take the
[1:27:58] devil back to his deepest darkest
[1:28:00] failure hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:04] man because his deepest darkest failure
[1:28:06] gives us our greatest brightest victory
[1:28:09] hallelujah what are we doing now we're
[1:28:11] walking in the power of that victory
[1:28:13] amen amen into every Divine promise of
[1:28:15] God Amen so what do you see this morning
[1:28:17] your enemy or do you see your savior
[1:28:19] what are you looking at this morning if
[1:28:22] you're sick and your doctor says you
[1:28:23] can't get well lift up your eyes to the
[1:28:25] Cross where he was wounded for our
[1:28:27] transgressions with the stripes we are
[1:28:29] healed don't look at what the doctor
[1:28:30] says he's working in science Faith Works
[1:28:33] in the realm of the spirit and God let
[1:28:35] us think on these things now while we
[1:28:37] raise our hands God sees them Hallelujah
[1:28:40] see we've got to get to a place
[1:28:42] where where where Christ just means so
[1:28:45] much to us
[1:28:46] this is why we have testimonies it makes
[1:28:48] it cause us to love him more remember he
[1:28:51] can't love us any more than it already
[1:28:52] has
[1:28:54] for God so loved the world he gave his
[1:28:55] only begotten son whosoever believes in
[1:28:57] him shall not perish but have
[1:28:59] eternal life right so the fullness of
[1:29:01] his love was displayed that day on
[1:29:03] Calvary
[1:29:04] but our love for him can increase
[1:29:07] that's why he gives us testimonies
[1:29:08] that's why he proves his word in your
[1:29:10] life amen because he wants you to know
[1:29:13] that he's alive that he's able amen that
[1:29:16] I Help Cometh From him we can trust in
[1:29:18] him in every situation amen any and it
[1:29:21] makes him mean so much more to us
[1:29:24] brother I'm says in remembering the Lord
[1:29:26] in 1962 so when the church gets to that
[1:29:28] place where that Christ means so much to
[1:29:31] us that we thirst to get in his presence
[1:29:34] and with each other it's a life-giving
[1:29:37] resource see when we get into that spot
[1:29:39] that that's what we hunger for to get
[1:29:42] into his presence and with each other
[1:29:44] see if we want to get into his presence
[1:29:45] you can't condemn another mortal in his
[1:29:48] presence you can't hold anything against
[1:29:50] anyone in his presence amen you can have
[1:29:53] the worst day but when you get into his
[1:29:54] presence that'll just evaporates I mean
[1:29:56] you're going to be having all the
[1:29:57] trouble you can be in the most
[1:29:58] Troublesome moment in your entire life
[1:30:00] you just get into his presence and it
[1:30:03] all comes into perspective amen we where
[1:30:05] he reminds you you're you're my daughter
[1:30:07] you're my son I love you I care for you
[1:30:09] I mean you're in my care you're in my
[1:30:11] last book of life you can't be lost holy
[1:30:14] all these troubles are just temporary
[1:30:16] things and they're actually working a
[1:30:18] far more eternal weight of Glory as the
[1:30:20] Apostle Paul would say hallelujah amen
[1:30:22] so if that's it it's a life-giving
[1:30:24] reason sauce it says no devil can can
[1:30:27] can ever overtake you
[1:30:29] Hallelujah not even death even death
[1:30:32] itself is defeated there oh what a hope
[1:30:34] what a place refresh ourselves and in
[1:30:36] doing so remembering Christ was the one
[1:30:38] who made it possible for us he was the
[1:30:41] one who did these things for us we must
[1:30:43] remember him
[1:30:44] so if I remember once we were aliens and
[1:30:47] without God Gentiles carried away with
[1:30:49] dumb Idols but remember Christ died not
[1:30:51] just for the Jew but for every creature
[1:30:53] of Adam's Fallen race Christ died
[1:30:56] Hallelujah so we're going to realize
[1:30:57] that we ever get to that place who wants
[1:31:00] to be in that place this morning that we
[1:31:02] just hunger and thirst to be in his
[1:31:03] presence that's all we want law I want
[1:31:05] to be in your presence Lord I Want To
[1:31:06] Worship You Lord I want to I want to
[1:31:08] feel the brush of angels Wings Lord I
[1:31:10] want to feel your anointing come down
[1:31:11] lord and so I can Praise You In a
[1:31:13] greater way like at all these weights of
[1:31:15] life can be lifted off and Lord I just
[1:31:17] want to be that Lord that's why you died
[1:31:18] Lord that that I can step into your
[1:31:21] presence once it was death to go into
[1:31:23] the holy of holies now it's death not to
[1:31:24] go in and to the very presence of God
[1:31:27] Amen but his blood has given us away in
[1:31:29] Access amen into his presence amen so if
[1:31:32] we get to that place where Christ means
[1:31:34] so much to us
[1:31:35] that'll change everything
[1:31:37] means more than our job more than
[1:31:40] trouble more than family feuds more than
[1:31:42] pain more than sickness heartache sorrow
[1:31:45] memories he means so much more than
[1:31:47] those things
[1:31:48] Amy I believe it will revolutionize our
[1:31:50] Christian walk
[1:31:51] amen that we have a total abandonment to
[1:31:54] God
[1:31:55] hallelu into his word
[1:31:58] Hallelujah
[1:32:00] praise the Lord
[1:32:02] amen
[1:32:04] now the Apostle Paul I'm just going to
[1:32:05] finish with this
[1:32:07] the Apostle Paul says in Galatians 6 but
[1:32:10] God forbid that I should Glory save in
[1:32:11] the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:32:14] whom the world is crucified unto me and
[1:32:16] I unto it see Paul had a moment he had a
[1:32:19] moment on the road to Damascus and that
[1:32:21] changed his whole life that was his
[1:32:22] defining moment of his life Hallelujah
[1:32:25] and he and he said years down the road
[1:32:27] to King Agrippa I was not disobedient to
[1:32:28] the heavenly vision and brother Adam
[1:32:30] even said the same thing after the Ohio
[1:32:32] River he said I was not disobedient to
[1:32:34] the heavenly vision and look at
[1:32:36] everything that's happened because he
[1:32:37] was not disobedient to that heavenly
[1:32:38] vision here we are today amen worshiping
[1:32:41] and spirit of the truth because of that
[1:32:42] amen be says now he says for in Christ
[1:32:46] Jesus neither circumcision availeth
[1:32:48] anything nor uncircumcision but a new
[1:32:51] creature
[1:32:52] so the thing that avails or has has
[1:32:55] force that can be exercised that's what
[1:32:58] a veileth means one of the meanings it's
[1:33:00] not it's not being uncircumcised or
[1:33:02] being circumcised it's not a work of the
[1:33:05] flesh no it's being a new creation in
[1:33:07] Christ Jesus that has great power but if
[1:33:11] the enemy tries to bring up memories of
[1:33:13] what the old man
[1:33:15] and you live under the shadow of those
[1:33:17] memories then that's not going to Avail
[1:33:19] like it should because we're trying to
[1:33:21] fix things that have already been fixed
[1:33:23] you know we're trying to reconcile
[1:33:24] things that God has been wiped off as
[1:33:26] Ledger he's written pardon over your
[1:33:29] book and thrown into the sea of his
[1:33:30] forgetfulness it's it's a done deal it's
[1:33:32] gone but we try and work through things
[1:33:35] that don't need working through see what
[1:33:37] we really need to work through is we
[1:33:38] need to go back to that time that's why
[1:33:40] you know if I'm repeating myself well
[1:33:43] I'm just I just fail to repeat myself we
[1:33:45] need to go back to that time when you
[1:33:46] met God where he pulled on your heart
[1:33:48] you respond and he changed your life
[1:33:50] because when that moment happened the
[1:33:52] devil got cast out he got defeated amen
[1:33:56] and you got transformed the Holy Ghost
[1:33:58] came in and you can look back and say
[1:34:00] whatever I was before that date I'm not
[1:34:03] that person
[1:34:04] beforehand I'd just be up and down in a
[1:34:06] cycle never getting you never overcoming
[1:34:08] just same trouble same thoughts same
[1:34:10] ways but then that day but God Richard
[1:34:13] mercy and now sure I've got battles sure
[1:34:15] I've got struggles but I'm going upward
[1:34:17] there's an upward trajectory and
[1:34:19] becoming more like him overcoming more
[1:34:21] every day why because the Overcomer has
[1:34:23] stepped into the house amen and he's
[1:34:25] come to take over your life like Joshua
[1:34:27] was told by the captain of the hostess
[1:34:29] you know Joshua says have you he forced
[1:34:31] or against it says no I but I come as
[1:34:33] the captain of the host of the Lord so
[1:34:35] basically he said no I have come to take
[1:34:37] over this battle I'm not on your side
[1:34:39] you're on my side right it's the same
[1:34:41] thing with our lord Jesus he has come
[1:34:43] when he steps into your life what is he
[1:34:45] doing he's come to take over your human
[1:34:47] battles amen and that wasn't just to
[1:34:49] take Jericho I always take it was to
[1:34:51] take the whole Promised Land
[1:34:53] hallelujah it's the same thing with you
[1:34:55] and I when the Holy Ghost comes in amen
[1:34:57] it's not just to to unseal the land that
[1:34:59] you can walk into the Holy Ghost no it's
[1:35:01] not just that is that you would take
[1:35:02] every Divine promise of God because the
[1:35:05] devil remember when you look at the word
[1:35:07] and there's promises that you've never
[1:35:08] seen before the Lord begins to Quicken
[1:35:10] it the devil says that's not for you you
[1:35:13] can't have that your family's not coming
[1:35:15] you can't just say that how dare you say
[1:35:18] you're worthy to obtain that
[1:35:21] see and then he tries to get us stuck
[1:35:22] right there we're going to realize
[1:35:24] brother it says when the cricketing
[1:35:25] power of the Holy Ghost comes in it
[1:35:27] gives you it actually gives you right to
[1:35:29] every Divine promise of God
[1:35:32] Hallelujah she gotta Kick the devil off
[1:35:35] and keep walking on
[1:35:36] amen and what is the fullness of the
[1:35:38] adoption that's the change of the body
[1:35:40] I mean so so the Lord comes in to take
[1:35:42] over a whole human walk
[1:35:45] Earthly walk until these bodies are
[1:35:47] changed
[1:35:49] Hallelujah so I ask you the question
[1:35:50] what are you defined by
[1:35:53] people are defined nations are defined
[1:35:55] by founding documents
[1:35:57] America is still defined by the
[1:35:59] Declaration of Independence
[1:36:01] and their spirit is still that way we're
[1:36:03] going to be an independent country
[1:36:05] for good and bad right but but it was a
[1:36:09] document that was signed but it but the
[1:36:11] contents of that document had to be
[1:36:12] fought for for it to come into action
[1:36:14] remember they didn't just have their
[1:36:15] first Congress they were independent and
[1:36:17] then the king of England said enjoy it
[1:36:20] you know you're in trouble anyway no
[1:36:22] they there was there was conflicts
[1:36:24] terrible things happen and the men that
[1:36:26] signed that document were willing to
[1:36:28] lose it all some were tortured terribly
[1:36:31] you know many of them were very rich men
[1:36:33] and they lost everything one man I can't
[1:36:35] remember his name but but but but the
[1:36:37] enemy General the British general
[1:36:38] actually set up as headquarters in his
[1:36:40] house and he told Washington to fire on
[1:36:42] his house because the enemy was within
[1:36:43] it he didn't say no don't fire your
[1:36:45] cannons at that house it's mine he said
[1:36:47] no blow it up the enemies in my house I
[1:36:49] want you to blow it up amen because they
[1:36:51] are willing to lose it all to be free it
[1:36:53] should be the same thing with you and I
[1:36:54] we've received an open book in this day
[1:36:56] right we've received our Declaration of
[1:36:58] Independence I mean we're an independent
[1:37:00] woman
[1:37:01] that's actually a quote I think from
[1:37:03] Brother Brown she's an independent woman
[1:37:04] the bride of Christ we're not hitched up
[1:37:06] with any organization we just hessed up
[1:37:07] with heaven with God himself right so an
[1:37:10] open book has come down but we've got to
[1:37:12] fight for the contents of the book
[1:37:14] amen the Holy Ghost is here to give you
[1:37:17] the victory but you've got to go fight
[1:37:18] the battle you've got to put your feet
[1:37:20] on the promise say Lord that promise is
[1:37:22] mine amen Divine Healing it's in the
[1:37:25] land it's my it's it's in the book amen
[1:37:27] Miracles is in the book speaking in
[1:37:29] tongues is in the book The Baptism of
[1:37:31] the Holy Ghost it's in the book amen
[1:37:33] salvation for my family it's in the book
[1:37:35] Deliverance is in the book breaking the
[1:37:37] cycle of generational spirits and things
[1:37:39] it's in the book amen the the Rapture
[1:37:42] it's in the book Hallelujah every Divine
[1:37:45] promise is in our founding document
[1:37:49] Hallelujah
[1:37:51] but what are you going to do are you
[1:37:52] going to let this Define you
[1:37:55] good I'm glad there's a correction there
[1:37:57] or are you going to let here comes the
[1:37:59] no or you're going to let your pastor
[1:38:00] find you
[1:38:01] there we go
[1:38:03] but it's up to you
[1:38:05] it's up to you it's your choice
[1:38:08] are you gonna let your memories hold you
[1:38:10] down I'm I'm just closing I'd be what I
[1:38:12] want you to think of it because you
[1:38:13] gotta look at your thought life where
[1:38:15] does it go
[1:38:16] where does it go where does it like if
[1:38:18] it could be written up here you know
[1:38:20] like in uh you know like Wikipedia when
[1:38:22] you look at Nations and things you
[1:38:23] there's like um the economy and it's
[1:38:25] like split up into like this graph like
[1:38:27] New Zealand will be mainly dairy stuff
[1:38:29] and Timber and different things and you
[1:38:30] know but what would the percentage of
[1:38:33] your thought life be
[1:38:34] would it be your past

[1:38:38] this you know this problem this
[1:38:41] financial problem you know the kids this
[1:38:44] Pro what is your thought life full of
[1:38:47] you know if you could chart it up what
[1:38:48] would it be or would it be God's
[1:38:51] promises

[1:38:55] God's promises I'm so glad I'm a
[1:38:57] believer I'm so glad he found me he's

[1:39:13] positive things
[1:39:14] and sure maybe the enemy says yo but
[1:39:16] this is happening this happening but but
[1:39:18] then you've got to come down and say but
[1:39:19] God
[1:39:20] rich and mercy
[1:39:22] he doesn't see the devil had never has
[1:39:24] the final say he thinks he does but God
[1:39:26] always has the final say Amen says so
[1:39:29] you've got to think about that what
[1:39:30] where are my thoughts going I'm just
[1:39:31] going to finish with this this is my
[1:39:33] last thought
[1:39:34] where do your thoughts go on the day

[1:39:38] but
[1:39:39] how do you think about them well you got
[1:39:41] to think about family and future but how
[1:39:43] do you think about is it negative
[1:39:45] is the is the conclusion smoke bombs
[1:39:48] craters destruction
[1:39:50] or is it streets of gold
[1:39:52] like brother man says about being sick
[1:39:53] you just have in your mind by the Lord a
[1:39:55] well body
[1:39:57] that's your age

[1:40:06] negative of your children well what's
[1:40:08] going to be made more the negative of
[1:40:09] your children you think about no lord
[1:40:11] they're yours they're put in my care
[1:40:14] your word says that that the Holy Ghost
[1:40:17] is for them

[1:40:21] promise so Lord I want to create an
[1:40:23] atmosphere now my home around me of
[1:40:25] power that they'll just fall into it
[1:40:27] Hallelujah
[1:40:30] so go back to the spot where you drowned
[1:40:33] Satan
[1:40:34] that's a good spot
[1:40:36] and remind them I mean let's have the
[1:40:38] musicians this morning
[1:40:40] Hallelujah

[1:41:13] you know I I so love it there's there's
[1:41:15] a moment in here where he gets off
[1:41:18] he exits scene right uh you know stage
[1:41:20] left he doesn't come back he has his
[1:41:23] last his last I don't want his the last
[1:41:26] words out of his lips will be maybe no

[1:41:41] Hallelujah so we've got to look at
[1:41:43] things through that kind of lens
[1:41:45] my trouble has an expiry date the devil
[1:41:47] hasn't expiry date sin hasn't expired a
[1:41:50] sickness has an expiry date I don't I
[1:41:52] ain't got one hallelujah it's like I so
[1:41:55] I don't mean a joke but I saw this meme
[1:41:57] how how someone had this Himalayan rock
[1:41:59] salt and it said on a blurb like 20
[1:42:01] million years ago the salt was made and
[1:42:03] it's got an expiry date on it like for
[1:42:05] next month is it funny how something
[1:42:07] that's 20 million years old that hasn't
[1:42:09] gone off is going to go off now
[1:42:10] and but that's what the devil does for
[1:42:12] you you have a blurb on your life you
[1:42:14] come from God and go back to God he
[1:42:16] tries to put a man-made expiry on you
[1:42:18] saying you're you're gonna end you're
[1:42:20] going to perish
[1:42:21] which one are you going to go by I'd
[1:42:23] rather go by God's non-expiry date for
