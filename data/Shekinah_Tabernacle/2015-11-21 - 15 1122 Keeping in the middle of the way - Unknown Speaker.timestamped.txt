[45:49] 35 I want to um sorry can you turn this
[45:52] down Brother Andy I just want to uh
[45:55] really touch on a few things that we
[45:57] spoke about Thursday night I thought it
[45:58] was be good to bring bring this
[46:01] morning and uh let's just read let's
[46:04] just read the entire chapter of Isaiah
[46:08] 35 let's see here so the Wilderness and
[46:11] the solitary Place shall be glad for
[46:14] them and the desert shall rejoice and
[46:16] Blossom as the rose it shall Blossom
[46:18] abundantly and rejoice even with joy in
[46:21] singing The Glory of Lebanon shall be
[46:23] given unto it the Excell Excellency of
[46:26] carel and Chiron they shall see the
[46:28] glory of the Lord and the Excellency of
[46:29] our God strengthen ye the weak hands and
[46:32] confirm the feeble knees say to them
[46:34] that are of a fearful heart be strong
[46:36] fear not behold your God will come with
[46:39] vengeance even god with a recompense and
[46:42] he will come and save you then the eyes
[46:44] of the blind shall be opened and the
[46:45] ears of the deaf shall be unstopped then
[46:47] shall the lame man leap as a as in heart
[46:50] and the tongue of the dumb sing for in
[46:52] the wilderness shall Waters break out
[46:54] and streams in the desert and the
[46:56] parched ground shall become a pool and
[46:58] the Thirsty land Springs of water and
[47:00] the habitation of dragons each shall uh
[47:03] where each lay shall be grass with reeds
[47:05] and rushes and an Highway shall be there
[47:08] and a way and it shall be called the way
[47:10] of Holiness the unclean shall not pass
[47:12] over it but it shall be for those the
[47:14] wayfaring men uh though fools shall not
[47:17] ear therein no lion shall be there nor
[47:20] any ravenous Beast shall be shall go up
[47:23] thereon it shall it shall not be found
[47:25] but the redeemed shall walk there and
[47:28] The Ransom of the Lord shall return and
[47:30] come to Zion with songs and everlasting
[47:32] Joy uh upon their heads they shall
[47:35] obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and
[47:37] sighing shall flee away Hallelujah may
[47:41] the Lord bless his word you may be
[47:46] seated praise the Lord
[47:49] now uh I I hardly I feel like I've got a
[47:52] bit too much hair on my FK this morning
[47:54] but I want to I want to I know brother
[47:57] Isaac preached on balance a couple of
[47:58] weeks ago and I think I couldn't find
[48:00] the recordings they've disappeared into
[48:02] somewhere so I don't know what he
[48:03] touched on but I want to uh speak
[48:06] about uh I want to speak about this
[48:08] chapter here and I want to
[48:11] really uh if I could give this a a title
[48:14] in some way I say where are you on the
[48:17] road we understand that there is one way
[48:19] it's not it's not a two-way traffic
[48:21] there's one way and we read there a
[48:24] highway there shall be and a way and it
[48:27] shall be called the way of Holiness the
[48:29] unclean shall not pass over it but it
[48:31] shall be for those the wering men
[48:33] through Falls shall not a therein and we
[48:36] read a bit later in verse 9 it says but
[48:39] the redeemed shall walk there so there's
[48:40] a way within the highway that the
[48:42] redeemed shall walk down amen and we
[48:45] understand that a that any road that is
[48:47] built properly uh is is graded so the
[48:51] water and the trash gets washed off to
[48:53] either side and on either side there's a
[48:55] guttering or there's a ditch and if the
[48:58] ditch becomes deep enough it can become
[49:00] a trench and what happens now is as we
[49:03] go on our Christian walk God allows
[49:06] influences to to come into our lives and
[49:09] if we respond in our Humanity we will
[49:12] end up on either side either ditch and
[49:15] if we keep responding in our Humanity
[49:17] the ditch will be dug deeper and will
[49:19] become a trench and you'll put sandbags
[49:22] there you'll put concrete there and
[49:23] you'll reinforce you know with you are
[49:26] because we understand the scripture
[49:28] tells us that every man is right in uh
[49:31] in his own eyes but the Lord pth the
[49:34] heart so everyone thinks they're on the
[49:36] way you know if we were honest with
[49:39] ourselves and I and I asked everyone in
[49:42] this room you would say I'm in the
[49:43] middle of the road amen they would let's
[49:46] just be honest because every man is
[49:49] right in his own eyes so every man
[49:51] thinks that they are they they are where
[49:53] they should be now this pth it means to
[49:57] to balance to measure out by weight or
[49:59] Dimension to analyze to equalize through
[50:02] idea of leveling so it's actually to you
[50:05] know to equal to meet to ponder to waste
[50:07] it's actually to you know weigh it up
[50:09] you the Lord the Lord weighs up you know
[50:12] which way we may lean because if we like
[50:15] it or not you know there's a human part
[50:18] of us and that human part loves to
[50:21] justify itself and that human part loves
[50:24] to be religious
[50:27] amen so God will God will allow things
[50:30] to come into our lives to keep us to
[50:33] actually either bring us out of a ditch
[50:35] or to keep us in the middle of the way
[50:37] and it's also God allows everything to
[50:40] happen in our lives good and bad ugly
[50:42] and and beautiful whatever you want to
[50:44] put it because God is testing God is
[50:47] proving rather what is in you amen God
[50:50] is proving is it is it is there Dr in
[50:53] there is there is there rust is there
[50:55] things that need to be removed cuz
[50:57] remember we are the clay here is the
[50:59] Potter and the Potter he you know takes
[51:01] up the clay and if there's any
[51:02] impurities he just breaks the vessel on
[51:05] the wheel again and molds it up and
[51:07] continues the process until there's only
[51:09] clay and then once once the once the
[51:12] vessel is molded into into the image
[51:15] that the Potter has in his mind then
[51:18] it's ready for the furnace then it's
[51:20] ready to be really to be tried amen I
[51:23] remember doing you know at school if
[51:26] there's any perfection in any Pottery
[51:28] you did it just blew open in the
[51:31] Kil God isn't that way God's work is
[51:36] perfect but we have to understand that
[51:39] God allows things to happen to see which
[51:41] way you going to lean that's right amen
[51:44] God will cause things that like
[51:46] job God knew s youo Satan God had
[51:50] fellowship with Satan and he said have
[51:52] you considered my servant job you know
[51:54] all the story very well but you got to
[51:56] bring it down into your address because
[51:58] God was telling God was telling Satan
[52:01] this man is perfect he was born like any
[52:03] other man he had he had problems like
[52:06] any other man but God said this man is
[52:08] perfect and the reason brother Braham
[52:10] tells us the reason he believed or God
[52:13] knew he was perfect is because God
[52:15] because job was trusting in God's
[52:17] provided way which was the lamb and
[52:19] that's why job could be justified in his
[52:21] stand is because he stood upon what God
[52:24] had provided which was the shed blood of
[52:26] an innocent one and that's why he could
[52:28] he could stand there and tell his
[52:30] friends I'm not a secret sinner this is
[52:32] not because I've been good or bad but
[52:34] God I don't understand it but God has
[52:36] allowed these things to happen and then
[52:38] he stood upon that word and then finally
[52:40] God in his timing Came Upon the scene
[52:42] and then God explained the whole picture
[52:44] to him what was going on but the reason
[52:46] that job could stand is because he
[52:48] believed in he knew the lamb was God's
[52:50] given way and because he could stand
[52:53] upon the word those other influences
[52:56] didn't move him off the way amen he
[52:59] didn't let other people sh he didn't let
[53:02] his closest friends yeah his closest
[53:05] friends came to him and they sat there
[53:08] and he was astonished and they wait till
[53:09] he opened his eye mouth and spoke and
[53:12] then what was in their heart begin to
[53:14] come out because because everyone around
[53:16] us they see they see people in different
[53:19] situations why is this person going
[53:21] through this and why is this person
[53:22] going through this and in their human
[53:24] reasoning
[53:26] they'll say it's because of this and
[53:27] this and this job's friends did the same
[53:30] thing and God told job pray for your
[53:33] friends or maybe he spoke to them
[53:35] himself I can't remember but he said get
[53:36] job to pray for you to offer a sacrifice
[53:39] because his friends were actually the
[53:41] ones that were in
[53:42] error amen I just want you to think it
[53:44] deep because sometimes you know it's
[53:47] such a fallacy in this day where
[53:49] especially the modern Church they
[53:51] everyone has a word for someone I have a
[53:53] word for you do you are you sure they
[53:56] had a word word for job amen and where
[54:01] did it end them up they're on the
[54:03] they're in a ditch someplace because of
[54:05] their human
[54:07] reasoning I just I just want these
[54:09] things to sink deep we have to be led by
[54:12] God we cannot be led by our emotion we
[54:15] cannot be led by our personality we
[54:18] cannot by led by these five senses or
[54:20] how we feel about it we have to be led
[54:23] by the spirit of God and the word that
[54:25] is the only thing you can you can't
[54:27] trust your senses I I tell you right now
[54:30] if you trust your senses you go off on
[54:32] some ditch some place and then because
[54:34] it feels right or you think it's right
[54:36] you'll begin to fortify your position
[54:39] you know the bigger people dig under the
[54:41] ground and they put concrete and all
[54:43] these different things it's the harder
[54:44] to get the people out
[54:47] amen but trust me if you're in a trench
[54:50] or in a bunker someplace God is not
[54:53] going to leave you in the bunker but
[54:55] it's harder to flush someone out that's
[54:57] in some nuclear bunker that is just
[54:58] someone in a ditch but he knows exactly
[55:01] what's needed to Spring you out of that
[55:04] kind of
[55:06] condition so every road has a ditch on
[55:08] either
[55:10] side now brother Bram says this in in
[55:13] Hebrews chapter
[55:15] 1 because I just want to read this
[55:17] because when I read this I marveled and
[55:18] I have we to understand our Humanity
[55:21] works against
[55:22] us and it's not 99% of the time it's not
[55:26] the devil who's the problem it's you
[55:28] that's the problem it's actually you
[55:30] find you the reason you're in that
[55:32] situation is because of you hey this is
[55:34] I'm preaching to myself you know as well
[55:37] the reason how how did I end up this way
[55:39] me remember the devil is defeated on
[55:42] Calvary he he's a bluff he has no power
[55:45] you hear the prophet in the prayer line
[55:47] time of time Satan you're a bluff you're
[55:48] defeated Jesus defeated you 2,000 years
[55:51] ago and I met an angel to give me this
[55:53] Divine call and he calls Satan's hand
[55:55] and Satan's exposed and defeated amen
[55:58] how many times we said Satan you're a
[56:00] liar you're a bluff and the devil has to
[56:02] recognize I'm a bluff so now Satan has
[56:06] been defeated but now you have to be
[56:08] defeated you have to overcome
[56:11] yourself the greatest enemy the prophet
[56:13] of God said the greatest enemy I have is
[56:16] William brandham he didn't say Satan he
[56:18] didn't say all of hell he said he said
[56:20] William brandham is my greatest enemy if
[56:22] I can just get this man out of the way
[56:25] God can work Hallelujah and if that was
[56:27] for Malachi 4 how much more for the
[56:29] bride of
[56:30] Christ amen so now so so just listen to
[56:35] this this is in Hebrews chapter 1 and
[56:38] then they used to talk about the Highway
[56:40] of Holiness now if you read over that
[56:43] there's in Isaiah 35 now notice there
[56:46] shall be a highway and a way now and is
[56:48] a conjunction see a highway it wasn't a
[56:50] Highway of Holiness it shall be a
[56:52] highway and a way and it shall shall be
[56:55] called the way of Holiness not the
[56:56] Highway of Holiness and the way the road
[56:58] is in the middle of the road it's built
[57:00] like this so that the waters will wash
[57:02] off the trash on both sides keep the
[57:03] road clean if you don't you have puddle
[57:06] standing on your road all the time if it
[57:09] isn't built right the way is the middle
[57:11] of the road now on this side when people
[57:14] get converted their minds are set right
[57:16] on Christ and if they're just a little
[57:20] scholarly so they're built a certain way
[57:23] and don't keep under
[57:25] they'll get real cold and stiff and
[57:28] starchy and indifferent so that's one
[57:31] side and then if they're just a little
[57:34] bit nervous so a little bit emotional a
[57:36] little bit
[57:38] nervous um and if you don't watch you'll
[57:41] just get radical and Wild on this
[57:45] side now are people built a little bit
[57:47] scholly yes are people built a little
[57:50] bit nervous yes it's different
[57:52] personalities so God gives you a certain
[57:55] personality but that can be used against
[57:58] you basically if all you get out of the
[58:00] service is you can't walk this way we
[58:04] believe we're saved by grace but
[58:06] sometimes we forget we walk this walk by
[58:08] grace alone so if you think it's you
[58:10] keeping yourself you'll fall and if you
[58:13] and if you keep things as yourself
[58:14] you'll continue to fall until finally
[58:17] you recognize hey God I can't do this I
[58:19] can't walk this walk without
[58:21] you if we inject our own Humanity
[58:25] at all 1% of us or Point whatever
[58:29] percent of us is too much in this
[58:33] walk amen am Christianity is not about
[58:37] us walking this walk Israel wanted to do
[58:40] something and they failed give us the
[58:42] law they basically said in in the book
[58:44] of Exodus we want to do something and
[58:46] then as soon as the law begin to come
[58:48] out of Moses's mouth they begin to
[58:49] recognize we cannot do this and in their
[58:52] Zeal and and in their good intentions
[58:54] they still
[58:55] failed right amen amen you got you got
[58:59] to bring it on Home friends this is this
[59:01] is just how it is with us our our good
[59:03] intentions many times is Antichrist
[59:06] hallelujah amen our will is Antichrist
[59:09] human will is Antichrist unconverted
[59:11] will is
[59:13] Antichrist even in good
[59:17] intentions now so they go into
[59:21] Sensations and everything but the real
[59:24] Church CH the real same gospel right in
[59:28] the middle of the road it's not cold and
[59:30] starchy neither is it fanaticism it's a
[59:33] real good old warm gospel heartfelt love
[59:37] of God going right down the middle of
[59:39] the road calling from both sides calling
[59:42] from both sides that's right now that's
[59:45] what and we're going to and how are we
[59:47] going to get that church right out of
[59:49] the word the year mundam now Paul wanted
[59:52] to get this church right in the middle
[59:54] of the road
[59:55] you see how we how we you know Paul even
[1:00:00] says in First
[1:00:01] Corinthians amen he says in 1
[1:00:03] Corinthians 11 and let's just let's just
[1:00:05] go to this because the failure people
[1:00:10] fail when they look through natural eyes
[1:00:12] yes people fail when they look through
[1:00:13] and it doesn't matter you know how long
[1:00:16] they've been Christians or you know
[1:00:17] brother bham standing in the Gap he
[1:00:19] preaches a sermon standing in the Gap
[1:00:21] and he and he and he's just had a great
[1:00:23] experience where he's lost his love for
[1:00:25] the people because Christ he was being
[1:00:27] rejected every door was closing he says
[1:00:30] you know when he's preaching the seals
[1:00:31] he says heaps of my friends I know
[1:00:33] thousands or whatever he said are going
[1:00:35] to leave me because of this and it's
[1:00:37] Christ unveiling himself and we
[1:00:40] understand that the scripture had to be
[1:00:41] fulfilled behold I stand at the door and
[1:00:43] knock because that's for the church
[1:00:45] World Jesus was kicked out of the church
[1:00:47] world and that was lived out in brother
[1:00:49] braham's
[1:00:50] Ministry and if he looked at it through
[1:00:52] spiritual eyes he would have understood
[1:00:55] this a scripture being fulfilled but we
[1:00:57] don't like to be rejected you know
[1:00:59] people don't like to be rejected they
[1:01:01] don't like to be put in a box you see
[1:01:04] and so he begin to lose his love for the
[1:01:06] people says I'm just going to go up to
[1:01:08] Northern British Colombia or Canada
[1:01:10] wherever I'm just going to be a hunter
[1:01:11] cuz I always wanted to be a hunter and
[1:01:13] I'll take my family up there and you
[1:01:16] know we'll just go up there and when the
[1:01:17] Lord says go preach this or go speak to
[1:01:19] this person I'll stomp out of the
[1:01:20] Wilderness and say thus sayith the Lord
[1:01:22] and then go back yes you go go listen to
[1:01:25] the service and so what happens now is
[1:01:28] is is because he was being rejected and
[1:01:30] he was looking it through human eyes now
[1:01:32] all this was examples for us this why
[1:01:34] this happened to the prophets we could
[1:01:36] look at how someone filled with the Holy
[1:01:38] Ghost in their position he was an
[1:01:40] adopted son of God in his position but
[1:01:43] yet he he he began to pull
[1:01:47] away under his Humanity he was pulling a
[1:01:50] certain way because of how the people
[1:01:52] were
[1:01:52] responding and because he was looking
[1:01:55] through natural eyes amen he wasn't
[1:01:57] looking but the Lord because of see the
[1:01:59] Lord because brother BR he was driving
[1:02:01] past a place and there was all these
[1:02:02] bums on the side warming themselves and
[1:02:04] there were some bums came into a
[1:02:06] restaurant and one looked like him and
[1:02:07] one looked like his cousin Fletcher or
[1:02:09] whoever it was and God said if you
[1:02:11] continue down this way that you want to
[1:02:13] go you'll end up like that and your wife
[1:02:15] will leave you you lose everything will
[1:02:17] he still be saved yes but his Humanity
[1:02:20] was driving him a certain way which was
[1:02:22] not the way God wanted him to go
[1:02:25] so God in his grace turned him back
[1:02:27] around so now these things these happen
[1:02:31] these things happen to you amen that's
[1:02:34] right where things come into your life
[1:02:36] but then how are you going to respond to
[1:02:38] it are you going to respond in a natural
[1:02:40] way and you can reason it out and
[1:02:42] justify your actions or are you going to
[1:02:45] surrender it to God and yield yourself
[1:02:47] to God that you can keep in the middle
[1:02:50] of the
[1:02:51] way now 1 Corinthians
[1:02:53] 11
[1:02:54] now let's go to let's just go to verse
[1:02:58] 29 I just want to read a couple of
[1:03:00] verses here or verse 28 but let a man
[1:03:03] examine himself this is Paul speaking of
[1:03:05] the of the uh uh
[1:03:07] communion so let a man examine himself
[1:03:10] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:03:12] of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:03:14] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:03:16] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:03:20] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:03:22] and sickly among you and many sleep now
[1:03:26] this Discerning the Lord's body he's not
[1:03:28] speaking about the unleavened bread and
[1:03:30] the and the wine being the Lord's body
[1:03:32] he's speaking about the body of Christ
[1:03:35] he's saying because they do you have not
[1:03:37] discerned the Lord's body many are seek
[1:03:40] uh sick and weak and many sleep so what
[1:03:44] happened with the Corinthian Church is
[1:03:46] they they became carnal in their walk
[1:03:49] and you can see that in in you know in
[1:03:51] the first chapter where Paul said you
[1:03:53] know you say I'm of Paul I'm of I'm of
[1:03:56] you know sephus and I'm of you know
[1:03:58] Apollos and all these different ones you
[1:04:00] know these different Ministries and what
[1:04:02] it happened is the people begin to look
[1:04:03] through natural eyes and they were
[1:04:05] looking at Ministries and they were
[1:04:07] comparing Ministry with Ministry and how
[1:04:09] people are built if they're scholarly
[1:04:11] what will they enjoy more more teaching
[1:04:14] if they're a bit more nervous and a bit
[1:04:15] more you know emotional they'll enjoy a
[1:04:18] bit more evangelism so in so in their
[1:04:21] carnal mind they begin to make camps in
[1:04:23] the church because because they like
[1:04:24] other Ministries over other Ministries
[1:04:27] instead of looking through God's eyes
[1:04:29] and say these are different gifts in the
[1:04:31] body and they complement one another to
[1:04:33] build us in the fullness of the Statue
[1:04:34] of Christ but they were looking through
[1:04:36] their carnal mind and and what happened
[1:04:38] they were still in church they were
[1:04:40] still worshiping the god you your know
[1:04:43] God they still walking in the message of
[1:04:44] the hour because they were obeying the
[1:04:46] message of the hour they believe the
[1:04:47] messenger and all these different things
[1:04:49] but they were carnal in their walk you
[1:04:52] understand so they were look looking
[1:04:54] through natural eyes and not spiritual
[1:04:57] eyes and so this is happening he says
[1:05:00] the reason many are sick and S your
[1:05:02] sleep actually means dead there because
[1:05:03] you're not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:05:06] you're not Discerning that your brother
[1:05:07] and sister is the Tabernacle of the
[1:05:09] Living God because in our in our natural
[1:05:13] Humanity we'll look at each other and
[1:05:15] say this person's like this and this
[1:05:17] person's like this and or this person's
[1:05:20] personality just jars with me that's
[1:05:23] right Hallelujah right why is this
[1:05:25] person this way God made them that way
[1:05:28] because iron sharpens iron you
[1:05:31] understand sometime now God allows
[1:05:34] people to come in am same fil you they
[1:05:38] they're all the bride totally different
[1:05:40] personalities different approach
[1:05:41] different way of doing things and God
[1:05:44] causes two opposing personalities to
[1:05:46] come together to bring them both into
[1:05:49] the middle you got to look at the big
[1:05:52] picture this walk everything it doesn't
[1:05:54] matter if it's in here or on the street
[1:05:56] in your job in the school God brings
[1:05:59] people your way Amen to mold you a
[1:06:01] certain way it's actually for your
[1:06:04] benefit oh I just I just can't see out
[1:06:07] either with this person that's for your
[1:06:09] benefit but you got to you got to say
[1:06:11] well how do I how do I respond because
[1:06:14] if you respond naturally you're not
[1:06:17] going to get the benefit and because
[1:06:19] remember if I pull a certain way like
[1:06:21] tiger wall if I pull a certain way and
[1:06:23] you I don't agree with it you'll pull
[1:06:25] the other way and you'll find yourself
[1:06:28] not in the middle of it you'll find
[1:06:29] yourself on the other side you'll find
[1:06:31] yourself in you know in the other ditch
[1:06:35] and that happens when we do not look
[1:06:37] spiritually at things if we look
[1:06:40] carnally at things you'll you you'll
[1:06:42] pull in the opposite direction yes sir
[1:06:45] that's right our humanity is such an
[1:06:47] enemy you see so they weren't Discerning
[1:06:50] they weren't because what happens I
[1:06:53] think brother Marcus said this to me I
[1:06:55] can't remember yeah he did in Fellowship
[1:06:56] he said if we put someone in a box they
[1:06:59] are of no use to us they can't benefit
[1:07:01] us in any way that's right because you
[1:07:04] because you've labeled them you say over
[1:07:05] here this is what you are I've I've
[1:07:07] indexed you a certain way and that's it
[1:07:10] good but God allowed that person to come
[1:07:13] into your life to benefit
[1:07:15] you you see so if we put them in a box
[1:07:19] you know some people some people are
[1:07:23] built more
[1:07:24] legal that's right some people are built
[1:07:27] more liberal that's right but every man
[1:07:30] thinks he's right in his own eyes yeah
[1:07:33] everyone thinks they are not liberal or
[1:07:34] legal there but they're right down the
[1:07:36] middle but God will allow God will
[1:07:39] allow legalists and liberal liberals to
[1:07:42] be in the same church that's right to
[1:07:45] bring both of them into the
[1:07:48] middle Amen to bring both in the middle
[1:07:51] but remember if you put them in a box
[1:07:53] you want you just go this way more
[1:07:55] because that person's
[1:07:57] wrong amen you'll put them in a box and
[1:08:01] you'll just because you know we love to
[1:08:02] hold our defend our point of view I'm a
[1:08:05] defender of the faith I'm an example of
[1:08:07] the message right that's right you
[1:08:09] building a bunk of friends basically it
[1:08:12] doesn't mean just be tossed to and fro
[1:08:14] by everything but you should know in
[1:08:16] whom you have belief but you can't just
[1:08:18] index people say this is this and
[1:08:20] because if you put someone in a box you
[1:08:22] lose your love for them and then you
[1:08:24] think the reason the love is going is
[1:08:26] because of them it's because of you amen
[1:08:30] you got to think about it now amen so we
[1:08:32] don't want to you know God Cain asked
[1:08:36] God am I My Brother's Keeper and he was
[1:08:39] his brother's keeper right let's go to
[1:08:41] Hebrews chapter 3 we are our Brother's
[1:08:46] Keeper but then how do you how do you uh
[1:08:49] how do you apply that how do you apply
[1:08:52] that now Hebrews chapter
[1:08:57] 3 and let's just read I just want to
[1:08:59] read from verse 7 down to verse 13 or
[1:09:03] 14 cuz Paul now Paul is speaking to the
[1:09:06] Hebrews here he says wherefore is the
[1:09:09] Holy Ghost saith now here's some
[1:09:12] homework read Hebrews 3 and 4 wherefore
[1:09:14] as the Holy Ghost saith today if you
[1:09:16] will hear his voice hard did not your
[1:09:18] hearts as in the provocation in the day
[1:09:20] of Temptation in the wilderness when
[1:09:22] your fathers tempted me proved me and
[1:09:24] saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was
[1:09:27] grieved with that generation said they
[1:09:28] do always ER in their heart and they
[1:09:32] have not known my ways so I swear in my
[1:09:34] wrath they shall not enter into my rest
[1:09:37] take heed Brethren least there be any uh
[1:09:40] be in any of you an evil heart of
[1:09:42] unbelief and departing from the Living
[1:09:43] God but exalt one another daily while it
[1:09:46] is called today least any of you be
[1:09:49] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:09:51] sin for We Are Made part partakers of
[1:09:54] Christ if we hold the beginning of our
[1:09:56] confidence steadfast until the end so
[1:10:00] Paul Paul is Paul is admonishing them
[1:10:02] saying to exalt exalt one another now
[1:10:06] this word exalt has many different
[1:10:08] meanings in the Greek it says to call
[1:10:10] near to invite uh uh uh to invoke by
[1:10:14] imploration exaltation consolation to
[1:10:17] beseech to comfort to to give exaltation
[1:10:20] to entreat and to pray yes amen so it
[1:10:23] has many different you know has many
[1:10:25] different meanings so to you know to to
[1:10:28] exalt one another
[1:10:30] daily is not always to beat people over
[1:10:33] the head say brother BR said this that's
[1:10:36] right you need wisdom we need wisdom we
[1:10:39] need we need so much wisdom in this day
[1:10:41] now because if one of us ends up in the
[1:10:44] ditch the whole body of Christ you know
[1:10:47] goes a bit sideways that's right amen if
[1:10:50] one of us is you know one way if one of
[1:10:53] us is sick we all suffer spiritually and
[1:10:56] physically amen so to exalt you know it
[1:11:01] means even to you know to pray to
[1:11:04] comfort and even even where brotherr
[1:11:06] says that love is corrective and it is
[1:11:09] corrective but how I've been thinking
[1:11:12] about this how is that correction
[1:11:14] applied is it always a stick in saying
[1:11:16] do this and you shouldn't do this and
[1:11:18] this is wrong and this is right and you
[1:11:20] know sometimes it is but it love doesn't
[1:11:24] always correct that way amen amen cuz at
[1:11:30] the end of the day if you see if someone
[1:11:33] is lacking in an area or you say they're
[1:11:35] too liberal or they're too legal
[1:11:37] whatever box you want to put them in
[1:11:40] they have to want what you
[1:11:42] have amen they have to want what you
[1:11:45] have you can't you know if if people and
[1:11:49] that's and this is this has been the
[1:11:50] problem especially in this country you
[1:11:52] go back 30 years brotherly kindness has
[1:11:54] been destroyed and people who are
[1:11:57] dogmatically right people look at them
[1:11:59] and they say I don't want that that's
[1:12:01] right but doctrinally they may be
[1:12:03] correct and doctrinally they might see a
[1:12:06] further part of the word than these
[1:12:07] other people but because how it's
[1:12:09] applied and what it produces cuz people
[1:12:12] just see you know you look at a car you
[1:12:14] can say how great the car is and what
[1:12:16] you know but if it looks like a big rust
[1:12:18] bucket that needs that basically needs
[1:12:20] to be thrown into scrap I'd say I don't
[1:12:22] want to buy that
[1:12:24] car amen and and and you take the same
[1:12:27] thing into the message where people live
[1:12:30] a certain life and people look at that
[1:12:31] and say I don't actually want that I
[1:12:34] don't want my family to be produced in
[1:12:37] that kind of way now remember the family
[1:12:40] is Sovereign in itself husbands we're
[1:12:42] all built
[1:12:44] differently amen but if you see a real
[1:12:46] love and harmony sure there's ups and
[1:12:48] downs and bumps and all these kind of
[1:12:49] problems whatever more but if you see a
[1:12:51] real Harmony in a family amen then
[1:12:53] people will say I want that I want that
[1:12:58] and what does that do remember because
[1:13:00] the true way is down the middle calling
[1:13:02] from both sides that's right
[1:13:06] amen you know sometimes we don't
[1:13:10] sometimes it's actually wrong to be
[1:13:12] proven right that's right Amen to win an
[1:13:16] argument if you lose the brother or
[1:13:17] sister but win the argument you've lost
[1:13:20] right amen you've you've totally lost
[1:13:22] you've totally that's not Christ like
[1:13:24] just to say I'm right this is right
[1:13:25] you're wrong cuz you've lost the brother
[1:13:28] and then it's harder to win that brother
[1:13:29] the scripture says than to win a win a
[1:13:32] win a castle win a
[1:13:33] fortress amen so you got to look at
[1:13:36] things see that's so carnal to come down
[1:13:39] and say this is how it is and that might
[1:13:41] be 100% true but you got to use wisdom
[1:13:44] you say there's more it's more than just
[1:13:46] winning an
[1:13:47] argument you got to think of your
[1:13:49] brother's Soul your sister's
[1:13:51] Soul because you can you can treat
[1:13:53] someone a certain way and they can go
[1:13:55] through Years cuz they've pulled the
[1:13:56] other way you
[1:13:57] see and yeah I've seen it around people
[1:14:02] have have have fallouts 20 years ago 30
[1:14:05] years ago they go around the mry bush a
[1:14:07] couple of times around the mountain and
[1:14:09] they're having the same Fallout with the
[1:14:11] same people and neither of them have
[1:14:12] grown at all amen right that's right
[1:14:16] I've seen it I've seen it and why
[1:14:19] because the first time they were carnal
[1:14:21] in what they did and they haven't
[1:14:23] learned from what they did and they're
[1:14:25] still carnal but yet quoting the prophet
[1:14:28] yet quoting the scripture yet right in
[1:14:30] their own eyes well this person did this
[1:14:33] to me and this person did that to me
[1:14:34] what did Jesus do for
[1:14:36] you amen cuz ultimately you cannot let
[1:14:40] and the devil will play on it so much
[1:14:42] this person's like this so I can't
[1:14:43] worship like this this person's like
[1:14:46] this so I can't sing how I want to sing
[1:14:48] this person's like this so I can't pray
[1:14:50] how I want to pray that's right and what
[1:14:52] happens is is that person actually
[1:14:55] becomes God to you because that person
[1:14:57] begins to dictate to you how you can
[1:14:59] worship God and how you can walk with
[1:15:01] God that's right but they did this to me
[1:15:04] they may have done those things but it
[1:15:07] was done for a reason that you would
[1:15:10] lean upon God and not lean upon your own
[1:15:12] self Israel you read Hebrews there you
[1:15:15] go into Exodus allowed them to be
[1:15:18] delivered gloriously and go in the
[1:15:20] desert 3 days and drink bit of water and
[1:15:22] go through those great big hardships
[1:15:25] because God wanted them to completely
[1:15:27] depend upon him that when they came to
[1:15:30] the promised land because that was their
[1:15:32] schooling was the Wilderness amen they
[1:15:35] were going through their schooling and
[1:15:37] God wanted them to be that way and and
[1:15:39] suffer those things that when the real
[1:15:41] test came which was possessing their
[1:15:43] land it wasn't going through the the law
[1:15:46] came that the law would God would be
[1:15:49] worshiped by that law in The Inheritance
[1:15:52] it wasn't for the wilderness user in the
[1:15:54] promised land so that whole journey was
[1:15:56] just them being schooled am and so they
[1:16:00] could but the problem is they were still
[1:16:02] slaves you know they were taken out of
[1:16:05] Egypt but Egypt wasn't taken out of them
[1:16:07] you look at Moses you know when when
[1:16:10] Jacob Joseph brought Jacob down into
[1:16:13] Egypt you know uh Joseph told Jacob do
[1:16:17] not tell Pharaoh your Shepherds cuz this
[1:16:20] is an Abomination to the Egyptians and
[1:16:23] look at Moses Moses is is in in
[1:16:25] Pharaoh's house he's next on the throne
[1:16:28] and then God because God's going to take
[1:16:30] Egypt out of Moses what happens a few
[1:16:32] days from then he's doing what's an
[1:16:34] Abomination to the people that he had
[1:16:36] ruled over and he had these sheep he was
[1:16:38] actually doing something there was an
[1:16:40] Abomination amen and God allowed that
[1:16:43] and those 40 years in the desert because
[1:16:46] God had to take Egypt out of Moses amen
[1:16:49] that when Moses came to a season where
[1:16:51] now you're going to deliver my my people
[1:16:53] he was
[1:16:54] ready amen and
[1:16:57] so God has to take all
[1:17:01] dependency of this guy am he he he
[1:17:06] causes things in life to take full
[1:17:09] dependency out of this guy amen so I can
[1:17:11] fully depend upon him and that's God's
[1:17:14] way of schooling his children it's not
[1:17:17] by education and learning you know and
[1:17:19] just say this is how this is the form
[1:17:21] that we do things but it's being
[1:17:23] surrendered to God that when when you
[1:17:25] feel like you're going through the
[1:17:26] grinder is because God's saying look to
[1:17:29] me and sometimes you may have to bear
[1:17:31] things and have to carry burdens and and
[1:17:34] and afflictions sure sometimes but he's
[1:17:36] proving he's saying can you bear it do
[1:17:39] you have the patience and the
[1:17:40] perseverance to Bear what you've been
[1:17:42] what's been put upon your shoulder cuz
[1:17:45] God is proving his salvation in you God
[1:17:48] is proving to the devil that the cross
[1:17:49] was enough that the blood was enough
[1:17:51] that I'm redeeming my children I've
[1:17:53] taken the book I mean I'm gathering what
[1:17:55] belongs to me to myself and they're
[1:17:57] becoming more like me that's right so he
[1:17:59] allows things to happen because God
[1:18:02] saying Satan look here's my bride she
[1:18:04] won't fall like Eve did she won't fall
[1:18:07] like the first church did she's
[1:18:08] predestinated not to fall Hallelujah and
[1:18:11] then so it's proven Satan says okay just
[1:18:13] give me a
[1:18:14] go and nine times out of 10 it's
[1:18:17] everyday things things come into life
[1:18:19] it's a little bit pressure comes on Amen
[1:18:22] you know a man it doesn't matter man
[1:18:26] woman child they are what they are under
[1:18:28] pressure that's right they are not what
[1:18:30] they are when everything's
[1:18:32] fine and so God was proving what was in
[1:18:36] Israel in that Wilderness Journey he was
[1:18:39] proving what was really in their hearts
[1:18:41] because they could rejoice when their
[1:18:43] enemies were destroyed and they had that
[1:18:45] good old Pentecostal meeting there on
[1:18:46] the other side of the Red Sea and Miriam
[1:18:48] playing the Tambour they're all dancing
[1:18:50] they could all Rejoice but that didn't
[1:18:53] prove what was in them yes it was a
[1:18:55] Wilderness Journey which proved what was
[1:18:58] in them amen so God is wanting to prove
[1:19:02] really what's in
[1:19:04] you
[1:19:06] Hallelujah and the Beautiful Thing is
[1:19:08] whenever something when failure comes up
[1:19:11] when something comes to mind I may have
[1:19:12] a massive blind spot that I have no idea
[1:19:15] about but then when God allows that to
[1:19:17] be exposed and I fall then I can
[1:19:20] actually say God now you can deal with
[1:19:22] it am because God is a gentleman he
[1:19:24] doesn't Force you through a pipe and
[1:19:26] make you overcome amen he doesn't Force
[1:19:29] you through a pipe and make you you know
[1:19:31] be be delivered of things but God allows
[1:19:34] it things to happen that imperfections
[1:19:37] in me can come out amen and you say Lord
[1:19:43] take this and then when he really does
[1:19:45] take it the same situation will come
[1:19:47] up and you'll just cruise over that's
[1:19:50] right amen
[1:19:53] amen hey God is looking for Perfection
[1:19:56] that's right God is looking for a
[1:19:58] Perfection yes and we know the blood of
[1:20:00] Jesus Christ one by one offering we're
[1:20:02] perfect he perfected them that are
[1:20:04] Sanctified so he gave a perfect offering
[1:20:07] to make a perfect people if it was
[1:20:09] imperfect offering it could never make
[1:20:11] the people perfect that's right amen but
[1:20:14] then he takes that power you know he
[1:20:16] takes that transforming power of His
[1:20:17] Holy Ghost and then he molds and shapes
[1:20:20] you into a mature cuz perfectionist not
[1:20:22] only sinless Perfection but it's also a
[1:20:25] maturity a completeness a fully grown
[1:20:28] person this be no you know don't be
[1:20:31] babies anymore where you need milk you
[1:20:33] should have been we from the milk and
[1:20:34] Taken full meat by now cuz there's a
[1:20:37] spiritual growth that must take
[1:20:39] place and so God is now you know this is
[1:20:43] how God this is how God
[1:20:46] operates now I was going to read
[1:20:49] this the thing is though God God is
[1:20:52] always God uses
[1:20:55] man every time so if we are one way or
[1:21:00] another God will allow people to be
[1:21:03] among us to bring us into the middle and
[1:21:07] not only to bring us into the middle but
[1:21:08] they mean they may need to come into the
[1:21:11] middle and you take this is in the
[1:21:13] patmas
[1:21:14] vision and this is speaking this is
[1:21:17] speaking of of of John Wesley now in
[1:21:20] John Wesley's day the church Church John
[1:21:23] Wesley did not believe in
[1:21:25] predestination here's the here's the
[1:21:27] messenger to the age he didn't believe
[1:21:28] in predestination George Woodfield and
[1:21:30] these ones they they pre he was a
[1:21:32] contemporary he preached
[1:21:34] predestination you think why would why
[1:21:36] would a man who's a church age messenger
[1:21:38] believe less of the word than others God
[1:21:41] built them this way that's right cuz he
[1:21:43] says it was certainly so
[1:21:45] now but by election God chose His Bride
[1:21:48] by election before the foundation of the
[1:21:50] world put their names on the L Book of
[1:21:53] Life sland uh before the foundation of
[1:21:55] the world before the ever the world ever
[1:21:57] began God in his mind being infinite and
[1:22:00] we use the word sometimes as
[1:22:02] predestination but it is a sure hanger
[1:22:05] in this church age that we live in it
[1:22:07] was certainly a great thing used in the
[1:22:08] days of the martyrs cuz they certainly
[1:22:10] believed it but it got away from it now
[1:22:13] to the legalist ideas the legalist
[1:22:16] teaching the church which come brother
[1:22:19] says which was a good thing because all
[1:22:21] of it had gone calvinistic in England
[1:22:24] till they didn't even uh they didn't
[1:22:26] even have revivals anymore and John
[1:22:29] Wesley come along preaching the Armenian
[1:22:31] Doctrine which balanced it up God will
[1:22:34] always balance it up that's right so so
[1:22:38] the church well they said well
[1:22:39] everyone's predestinated we don't need
[1:22:40] to go preach we don't need to go have
[1:22:43] revivals CU everyone who's going to be
[1:22:44] there is going to be there and and the
[1:22:46] whole church went to seed on that idea
[1:22:47] that's right right so God built John
[1:22:49] wisley a certain way to preach you know
[1:22:52] but their their method of sanctification
[1:22:54] was a SE self- sanctification and it was
[1:22:57] works but God built them that way to
[1:23:00] swing the church into the middle yes
[1:23:02] amen so God you say would God absolutely
[1:23:05] he did that that's right and if that was
[1:23:07] the same if that was that way in the
[1:23:09] Philadelphian age how much more now in
[1:23:11] the bride age when God doesn't want his
[1:23:14] bride leaning one way or another on the
[1:23:16] humanity and their feelings and I feel
[1:23:18] this this way but God to me the message
[1:23:20] is balanced that's right amen the
[1:23:23] message is is perfectly balanced and so
[1:23:25] God built his you say well that was
[1:23:27] Elijah speaking in the later part of his
[1:23:30] ministry he said I must decrease he must
[1:23:32] increase so it wasn't just Elijah
[1:23:34] speaking it was God himself speaking he
[1:23:36] says in the seventh seal message he says
[1:23:38] well maybe I'm just building a platform
[1:23:40] for that great one to
[1:23:42] come and people take that quote and they
[1:23:45] say I'm I'm the man but they're all
[1:23:47] wrong cuz he speaking of Christ himself
[1:23:49] stepping upon the scene which he had
[1:23:51] said now I must increase he must
[1:23:53] increase the word must
[1:23:54] increase God you see so you know so God
[1:23:58] will allow people to come to balance us
[1:24:01] in a certain way especially now that we
[1:24:04] have because we have the mind of Christ
[1:24:06] in this age they have the mind of Christ
[1:24:08] so if we really have the mind of Christ
[1:24:10] you can't have two minds the bride is
[1:24:12] not
[1:24:14] schizophrenic amen you can't have two
[1:24:16] minds operating you can't have two Wills
[1:24:18] operating there's only one will you know
[1:24:21] I don't know if they're them online yet
[1:24:23] but if you haven't you know with the
[1:24:25] convention there was up in ker K Brother
[1:24:27] Joseph leanza preached a wonderful
[1:24:29] services on the will
[1:24:32] yeah and now so our will can't operate
[1:24:36] and God's will can operate at the same
[1:24:38] time that's right and the Lord's PR says
[1:24:40] Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed
[1:24:41] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:24:44] done that was the first thing that was
[1:24:46] prayed thy will be done if it is our
[1:24:49] will being done we'll lean certain ways
[1:24:53] and we'll justify ourselves but we're
[1:24:55] leaning AER if you lean if you lean too
[1:24:58] far for too long you end up in a
[1:25:00] ditch amen so it's not our will our will
[1:25:04] is Antichrist against God and Romans 1
[1:25:07] says there's not one that seeks after
[1:25:08] God not one because they all want their
[1:25:10] own will to do their whatever they want
[1:25:12] to do that's why we have to cast down
[1:25:15] reasoning and imaginations that exalt us
[1:25:17] out of the word of
[1:25:19] God Amen so we have to be willing
[1:25:22] that we lay our will down see brother
[1:25:25] brandham you say about pre you're
[1:25:28] standing in the Gap his will he said I
[1:25:30] never wanted to do this I wanted to be a
[1:25:32] Trapper his whole life he wanted to be a
[1:25:33] Trapper so when he lost the feeling for
[1:25:35] the people his will began to come up
[1:25:38] again he says I want to go hunting again
[1:25:41] cuz he wanted to be a Old Testament
[1:25:42] prophet in the wilderness cuz he loved
[1:25:44] hunting he loved the Wilderness that was
[1:25:45] his will coming up again amen so we our
[1:25:50] will canot operate and God's will that's
[1:25:53] right you it it just it just doesn't
[1:25:55] work but I'm justified in in what I
[1:25:58] believe I justified in my position your
[1:26:01] will cannot operate in God's will your
[1:26:05] thinking cannot operate with God's
[1:26:10] thinking now Jesus says this in Matthew
[1:26:13] chapter
[1:26:14] 7 forth what judgment ye judged you
[1:26:17] shall be judged and with what measure
[1:26:20] you meet it shall be measured to you
[1:26:23] again why beholdest thou the moat which
[1:26:26] is in thy brother's eye remember I'll
[1:26:29] just read it but considerest not the
[1:26:31] beam that is in thine own
[1:26:34] eye or how wil thou say to thy brother
[1:26:37] let me pull out the moat out of thine
[1:26:39] eye and behold a beam is in thine own
[1:26:42] eye thou hypocrite First cast out the
[1:26:44] beam out of thine own eye then Thou
[1:26:47] shalt See Clearly to cast out the moat
[1:26:49] out of thy brother's eye you see it's
[1:26:52] such an important thing when we
[1:26:55] pray when we pray it shouldn't be we're
[1:26:58] not we shouldn't be trying to change
[1:27:00] God's mind when we pray we say Lord
[1:27:02] change my thinking change my mind amen
[1:27:05] amen because of someone you know we all
[1:27:08] think we're right yes I think I I'll be
[1:27:12] I think I'm right I think I'm down the
[1:27:14] middle amen that's just I'll just be you
[1:27:18] know if I'm the only honest one here
[1:27:19] that's fine but but that's how I feel I
[1:27:21] believe I'm right cuz every man thinks
[1:27:23] he's right in his own eyes you see so it
[1:27:26] takes God unless God if unless you pray
[1:27:29] that's why thy will be done thy kingdom
[1:27:32] come thy will be done and so we must
[1:27:34] pray in a way because if just say if I
[1:27:36] have a problem with someone it shouldn't
[1:27:39] be now now I get my ammo and I justify
[1:27:41] myself and or that person's wrong cuz
[1:27:44] remember the Judgment that you give that
[1:27:45] same judgment will be given to you it
[1:27:47] should never be that it should be Lord
[1:27:50] examine me remember there's a forest in
[1:27:53] my examine me take out my imperfections
[1:27:57] that when I Can See Clearly that's why
[1:27:59] he said this when you can see clearly
[1:28:01] then you can help your
[1:28:03] brother amen then you can help your
[1:28:05] sister that's right but if you're going
[1:28:07] you know there's this thing you know
[1:28:09] it's in Psychology but brother speaks
[1:28:11] about it's called
[1:28:13] imprinting where things there's there's
[1:28:15] key events in our life that are that
[1:28:17] that are just imprinted into us that's
[1:28:20] right just just complet
[1:28:22] it's molded our our entire
[1:28:25] character and God allows those
[1:28:29] things for certain
[1:28:31] purposes now if something is if
[1:28:34] something is taken carnally in the
[1:28:36] Christian work it'll imprint upon me and
[1:28:39] then I will look through those glasses
[1:28:41] that's right amen and all of my
[1:28:44] decisions and everything every way I see
[1:28:46] things will be based upon that thing yes
[1:28:49] amen amen it's called a clouded spirit
[1:28:51] and you know in another term where it
[1:28:53] becomes the filter that we look
[1:28:56] through that's right and I can and
[1:29:00] people you know unless God shows that to
[1:29:03] the
[1:29:04] individual they will say I'm looking
[1:29:06] through perfect glasses what do you mean
[1:29:09] I'm looking through the word brother
[1:29:10] look it says this
[1:29:12] here amen
[1:29:15] so we have to be very careful amen where
[1:29:20] if something comes out if there's a
[1:29:21] disagreement or something you know the
[1:29:23] last thing how can love leave a leave a
[1:29:27] body it's how the members treat each
[1:29:30] other and how they respond to others in
[1:29:33] the church that's how love leaves oh
[1:29:36] that this person's here that person's
[1:29:38] here yes that's right oh and then and
[1:29:40] then they put in a
[1:29:43] box are you
[1:29:45] God I'm saying things pretty flat today
[1:29:47] but I think I think this is this is just
[1:29:49] how it's coming out so you know are you
[1:29:51] got is this is this how they're going to
[1:29:53] end
[1:29:54] up is that you know because the problem
[1:29:56] is we take a photo of people we put it
[1:29:58] in our mind and every time we see them
[1:30:00] it could be years the photo comes out
[1:30:02] this is how they are are they still that
[1:30:05] way oh this person did they did that to
[1:30:07] me years ago have you forgiven
[1:30:10] them but they did a catastrophic thing
[1:30:13] to my life it's totally ruined me has it
[1:30:16] it may be terrible but have you forgiven
[1:30:19] them perfect faith is based upon
[1:30:21] forgiveness you read about the scripture
[1:30:23] perfect faith I want perfect Faith it's
[1:30:25] based upon forgiveness if you cannot
[1:30:28] forgive then you cannot have perfect
[1:30:30] Faith so it actually comes down to you
[1:30:34] you can even go to them say look when
[1:30:35] you did this and this I forgive you they
[1:30:38] might never ever apologize yes that
[1:30:41] actually doesn't matter that's right
[1:30:43] it's if you can forgive them leave it at
[1:30:46] the feet of Jesus Christ and move on
[1:30:48] that is the challenge remember things
[1:30:51] things happen happen and God is saying
[1:30:53] how are you going to deal with this but
[1:30:55] I'm justified in my position you may be
[1:30:58] hey Jesus he came to his own his own
[1:31:00] received him not he could have called
[1:31:02] Legions of angels he could have just
[1:31:04] leveled Jerusalem just like this hey
[1:31:06] cursed the Fig Tree he said J just he
[1:31:09] could call he he could have just called
[1:31:11] fire from heaven you know his you know
[1:31:12] his disciples say should we call fire
[1:31:14] from heaven he says you don't know the
[1:31:17] anointing that's on you because I saw
[1:31:19] Elijah do these things you know the
[1:31:20] story
[1:31:22] y that's right and so Jesus could have
[1:31:25] been fully Justified just to cause the
[1:31:28] you know all those religious demons
[1:31:31] there he could have just caused those
[1:31:32] people just to vanish to nothing he
[1:31:34] could have done it that's right and he
[1:31:37] would have been
[1:31:38] Justified the very God that they were
[1:31:40] claiming to serve had was standing among
[1:31:42] them and they totally rejected him and
[1:31:44] it's Humanity CU remember he was a human
[1:31:47] in his Humanity he could have done that
[1:31:48] and he would have been perfectly
[1:31:49] Justified that's right but when he was
[1:31:51] on the cross he said Lord forgive them
[1:31:54] they don't know what they're
[1:31:56] doing amen can we can we and you and you
[1:32:00] mean you look at that scene and say of
[1:32:02] course they know what they're doing
[1:32:04] they've rejected you and they you know
[1:32:06] this man will not have rule over us he
[1:32:09] will not be our
[1:32:11] King you know she could say they
[1:32:13] actually know what they're doing he call
[1:32:15] himself God he was God he is
[1:32:17] God and he said father forgive them they
[1:32:20] don't know what they're doing
[1:32:23] and no one's ever been crucified has
[1:32:25] anyone ever been scorched and rejected
[1:32:28] and basically uh face public
[1:32:31] execution Jesus suffered all those
[1:32:34] things he said father forgive me I mean
[1:32:36] father forgive them sorry they don't
[1:32:38] know what they're doing right and we
[1:32:40] want to be like
[1:32:43] Jesus amen
[1:32:47] am now we must be able to look
[1:32:52] we must be able to look
[1:32:54] beyond the
[1:32:57] situation and you must be able to look
[1:32:59] it through through through spiritual
[1:33:00] lives and
[1:33:02] everything everything in life you have
[1:33:04] to look beyond your five senses your
[1:33:07] five senses lie to you every day your
[1:33:09] emotions lie to you every day but if you
[1:33:12] can take it back into the word and you
[1:33:15] can identify the bigger picture remember
[1:33:18] this whole life is a character building
[1:33:21] process
[1:33:22] yes doesn't matter before you met the
[1:33:24] Lord you always were the Lords just came
[1:33:26] a season where you recognized him and
[1:33:28] gave your life so everything in life the
[1:33:31] parents you have the background the
[1:33:33] country you were born in you know the
[1:33:35] influences at school or wherever you
[1:33:36] went that was God molding and shaping
[1:33:39] you for a certain work to be molded in a
[1:33:43] certain
[1:33:44] way but if we look it because there's a
[1:33:47] fine thing there's a fine line now
[1:33:50] there's such a fine line between
[1:33:53] identifying a scar and being
[1:33:55] healed and identifying a scar and
[1:33:58] nursing
[1:33:59] it so people people can identify because
[1:34:03] some things are ter are terrible things
[1:34:04] that happen in life I'm not I'm not
[1:34:06] sugar coding anything there's great I
[1:34:08] know even sitting there's great pain of
[1:34:11] of the past painful things that have
[1:34:13] happened but there's a fine line between
[1:34:16] identifying it and it being healed and
[1:34:20] identifying it and actually nursing
[1:34:22] it
[1:34:24] amen because in hospital someone goes
[1:34:28] into Hospital you say what a massive
[1:34:29] wound on that person but then there
[1:34:31] comes a process of time where you say
[1:34:33] look at what they're doing to the person
[1:34:34] you see the healing process you know
[1:34:36] take
[1:34:38] shape so if the person just looks at the
[1:34:40] wound of what happened you know they're
[1:34:42] missing what what the doctors are doing
[1:34:44] to them you see
[1:34:48] so and the devil can use our own
[1:34:51] personal it because he always uses you
[1:34:53] were wronged there Jesus was wronged all
[1:34:56] the
[1:34:57] time Believers have always been
[1:35:00] wrong but God allows
[1:35:03] that to see what are you going to do are
[1:35:06] you going to nurse that thing it wasn't
[1:35:08] you know I didn't ask for this no one
[1:35:10] asked for life you know what happens in
[1:35:12] life no one asked for
[1:35:14] it you know no one no one said yeah I I
[1:35:18] wanted that trial I wanted that pain I
[1:35:21] wanted that
[1:35:22] suffering who loves
[1:35:25] trials I've never heard a Christian say
[1:35:27] I need another
[1:35:29] trial I want a bad one this time I want
[1:35:32] a real bad one I've never I've never
[1:35:34] heard anyone say
[1:35:36] that and and we can we can come through
[1:35:39] a
[1:35:40] trial but if but if you keep it you know
[1:35:43] if it's still if it's still the devil
[1:35:44] will will will will anoint your memory
[1:35:47] and take you back to that place and open
[1:35:50] that wound and make it as Roar and as
[1:35:52] painful as it when it first happened and
[1:35:54] he'll even magnify it many
[1:35:56] times
[1:35:57] amen and and that is actually
[1:36:00] identifying a scar and nursing
[1:36:03] it because a scar a wounding can take
[1:36:07] you into a ditch as
[1:36:09] well amen but if you keep your eyes upon
[1:36:13] the Lord that's why such power and just
[1:36:16] giving it to really giving it to him and
[1:36:18] every time the devil brings you away you
[1:36:20] say Lord you say that's done
[1:36:22] it's under the
[1:36:23] blood
[1:36:26] amen now we can't let
[1:36:32] so I just want to read
[1:36:37] this now this is in raising gas's
[1:36:40] daughter in
[1:36:42] 56 he was a God man he was divine he was
[1:36:46] virgin born god Jehovah god um
[1:36:49] overshadowed a little virgin and brought
[1:36:51] forth for the Virgin bornn Son of God
[1:36:53] and that was a tabernacle or the living
[1:36:55] place of Jehovah himself Jehovah walked
[1:36:58] in a tabernacle of Flesh and paid the
[1:37:01] price for sin don't you ever let him be
[1:37:04] a prophet he was the god of the prophets
[1:37:06] sure was he was more than a good man he
[1:37:09] was the god of the Good Men now out here
[1:37:14] in this little old sea tossed about says
[1:37:16] when he's on the boat remember sleeping
[1:37:18] 10,000 Devils of the sea swore that
[1:37:21] drown him while he was laying back there
[1:37:24] tired you know the devil takes advantage
[1:37:26] of you when you get tired or warn out he
[1:37:30] does you the same way you just get a
[1:37:32] little tired and worn out and get
[1:37:34] discouraged certainly he caught Jesus
[1:37:37] right at that weak spot tired and weary
[1:37:42] yes so the devil you know he even says
[1:37:44] in one
[1:37:46] place he and Christ revealed his own
[1:37:49] word so so the devil looks for weak
[1:37:51] spots when you're weak and he says
[1:37:56] now so so this is the beginning of
[1:37:59] Christ is revealed in his own word it's
[1:38:00] like there opening comments now where I
[1:38:03] come to the conclusion to talk on was
[1:38:04] this because knowing that we say we
[1:38:07] mustn't just just say because we're
[1:38:10] gathered together to just haphazardly
[1:38:12] speak on anything but it's something
[1:38:14] that will help stabilize the people for
[1:38:17] we are going to pass through dangerous
[1:38:19] treacherous Waters where already sailing
[1:38:22] through them and sometimes I guess it's
[1:38:25] much uh with you like it is with me it
[1:38:28] seems like that so much of it it's such
[1:38:31] a scary I was just talking to a young
[1:38:33] Minister and his wife in the room a few
[1:38:35] moments ago and both them are nervous
[1:38:38] just like the rest of the world rest of
[1:38:40] human beings on Earth I said remember
[1:38:42] Satan's got a Punch coming at you I
[1:38:45] don't care who you are uh he's got a
[1:38:49] right to that one punch
[1:38:51] which would had you rather be that punch
[1:38:54] be blind or be arthritic sitting in a
[1:38:57] chair or be nervous see he's got
[1:38:59] somewhere he could punch you he's got a
[1:39:02] right to that open place now that's the
[1:39:05] spot you've got to keep covered all the
[1:39:07] time and he says and to see this nervous
[1:39:10] age that we're living in he changes his
[1:39:11] course so there is
[1:39:14] a there's a there's an open place in all
[1:39:17] of us the devil has a right for that one
[1:39:19] punch that's right you got to keep it
[1:39:22] covered all the time how do you keep
[1:39:24] that covered don't walk in your Humanity
[1:39:26] whatever you do because if you walk in
[1:39:28] that Humanity the devil can use your own
[1:39:30] Humanity against you and swing you one
[1:39:33] way or another
[1:39:36] yep
[1:39:38] now you say well how
[1:39:42] does so both both legalists and
[1:39:46] liberalists say they love the Lord Jesus
[1:39:49] but how someone Acts shows actually what
[1:39:52] they
[1:39:53] are I'm just going to read so this is a
[1:39:55] marriage and
[1:39:56] divorce he says see you find yourself on
[1:39:59] two different roads and neither one of
[1:40:01] them is right now that's hard to say
[1:40:04] that but it's the truth we find
[1:40:06] ourselves on two different roads one
[1:40:08] going this one going one way one going
[1:40:11] the other now let's see what truth is
[1:40:14] now listen and see if this sounds
[1:40:16] sensible to you for instance if I get
[1:40:19] ready to go overseas now I'll take my
[1:40:21] own family I'll call my wife up to me
[1:40:25] and I'll say we're going uh well I'm
[1:40:27] going overseas dear now here is the
[1:40:29] legalist
[1:40:30] side now my wife I'm going to lay the
[1:40:33] Lord down on you if you flirt with any
[1:40:35] man while I'm gone when I come back
[1:40:37] you're a divorced woman and I don't want
[1:40:39] you making eyes I don't want you
[1:40:41] flirting you understand that I'm your
[1:40:43] husband if you do it I'm going to put
[1:40:45] you away when I come back then she
[1:40:47] reaches and gets me by the tie and say
[1:40:49] my good man I want to tell you something
[1:40:52] see that if you make eyes at any woman
[1:40:56] or take any woman out or flirt with any
[1:40:58] woman you're going to be divorced man
[1:41:00] when you come back why wouldn't that be
[1:41:03] a happy home that's the legalist all
[1:41:05] right now the other side the other side
[1:41:08] is now that if I go overseas and I make
[1:41:11] a mistake and go over and say well now
[1:41:13] look I'll take this woman out oh it's
[1:41:15] all right with my wife she don't care my
[1:41:18] wife say I'll go out with this man it's
[1:41:20] all right with Bill he don't care if I
[1:41:22] don't care then there's something wrong
[1:41:25] with me I don't love that woman right
[1:41:28] and if I and if she don't care there's
[1:41:31] something wrong with her she's my life
[1:41:33] uh wife I don't want another man fooling
[1:41:36] with her she's my wife that's the
[1:41:38] correct way of it there's both of them's
[1:41:41] got a truth but not the exact truth now
[1:41:44] when I go overseas to make it right my
[1:41:46] little family gathers around and we pray
[1:41:49] with one another and I commit them to
[1:41:51] God and they commit me to God and when
[1:41:54] we um when we go overseas I go overseas
[1:41:57] now I know she loves me I have
[1:42:00] confidence in her and I love her and
[1:42:03] she's got confidence in me as long as I
[1:42:07] love her like that she don't have any
[1:42:10] worry about me taking any other woman
[1:42:12] out as long as she loves me right why
[1:42:16] there's no need of me thinking about any
[1:42:19] man's going to go out with her because
[1:42:20] she's my wife and I believe her and I
[1:42:23] believe if I would actually do something
[1:42:25] wrong make a mistake and go out with
[1:42:27] some woman and return back and would
[1:42:29] confess it to her and tell her meter I
[1:42:31] didn't mean to do that I just got caught
[1:42:33] in a trap this woman just run right out
[1:42:36] to me and grabbed me by the arm and and
[1:42:38] started so and so I believe she'd be
[1:42:41] understanding I believe she would
[1:42:43] forgive me for it but I wouldn't want to
[1:42:46] do it for nothing because I love her
[1:42:49] though she would for forgive me I I
[1:42:51] wouldn't do it I wouldn't hurt her for
[1:42:53] nothing though I know she'd forgive me
[1:42:56] for it I don't want to hurt her and
[1:42:58] that's the way it is with
[1:43:01] Goden if I with ailo love which is human
[1:43:04] love Fellowship love can make a man feel
[1:43:07] that about his wife What about agapo
[1:43:10] love the Greek meaning the love of God
[1:43:12] what would that make me do about Jesus
[1:43:15] Christ as long as I want to do it and
[1:43:18] it's in my heart to do it well as long
[1:43:21] as in my heart to do it I go do it
[1:43:24] legalism won't let me do it but because
[1:43:27] that I know I get punished for doing it
[1:43:30] but the real truth of it is is when the
[1:43:32] love of God comes into your heart till
[1:43:35] you want to do it that's the truth of it
[1:43:36] there's two schools not legalism or
[1:43:39] Calvinism it's both legalism and see
[1:43:43] that's what he said so he said if you
[1:43:44] really love the
[1:43:46] Lord you will you know he said the
[1:43:49] liberal he said the liberal rul they say
[1:43:51] it's like we just don't care and the
[1:43:53] legalist say well you better not do it
[1:43:55] cuz you'll get punished but if you
[1:43:57] really love him if you have a real Godly
[1:44:00] love for him then you won't want to do
[1:44:04] it why what's your because what you know
[1:44:05] what's the motive behind it you won't do
[1:44:07] it because you love him not because
[1:44:10] you're scared you'll be punished for it
[1:44:12] but because you love you're in a love
[1:44:13] relationship you and God and you also
[1:44:16] wouldn't want to do it cuz you wouldn't
[1:44:17] want to hurt him cuz he knows because he
[1:44:20] know knows that he cares for you and you
[1:44:22] care for him so why would you want
[1:44:24] anything to come into the relationship
[1:44:26] which would Mar the
[1:44:28] relationship amen it's divine love only
[1:44:32] true divine love can keep a Believer
[1:44:34] down the middle of the road it's not how
[1:44:36] much they understand how much they know
[1:44:38] or any any human human
[1:44:41] element it's the love of God and it's
[1:44:44] only the the real love
[1:44:47] see one way to lose the love of God is
[1:44:50] to operate in a carnal realm that's
[1:44:52] right amen if you operate in a carnal
[1:44:56] realm you'll lose your love for your
[1:44:58] brother and your sister that's right
[1:44:59] you'll lose your love for God that's
[1:45:01] right it's guaranteed because you're not
[1:45:03] walking in the spirit anymore but you're
[1:45:05] walking after the
[1:45:07] flesh
[1:45:09] amen so now as I just wind this
[1:45:13] up you know we want
[1:45:17] to it says it says and Above All Above
[1:45:23] All Things Have fervent charity among
[1:45:25] yourselves for charity shall cover the
[1:45:28] multitude of sins love love shall cover
[1:45:31] the multitude of
[1:45:33] sins and that's how you know the devil
[1:45:37] the devil if he
[1:45:39] can if the body isn't United and there's
[1:45:43] gaps in you there's there's separation
[1:45:45] in the body then the devil can get into
[1:45:47] those gaps and he can divide the Sheep
[1:45:50] even more yes amen and then how does he
[1:45:53] do that oh that brother said this to me
[1:45:56] or this sister said this or this
[1:45:57] happened to this and then and then it
[1:45:59] just
[1:46:00] snowballs yeah and that's how that's how
[1:46:03] the devil can get in and then you can
[1:46:06] and then you can justify yourself and
[1:46:08] say well you know the reason the devil
[1:46:12] came in is because he shot that person
[1:46:13] with something and now he's trying to
[1:46:14] poison the whole group amen but it's not
[1:46:18] always that
[1:46:19] way it's it's how you react to when
[1:46:23] things come your way it'll either allow
[1:46:26] the devil in more or it'll push the
[1:46:28] devil away that's right amen it's how
[1:46:31] you react not not what the other person
[1:46:34] you know Christianity I just came to the
[1:46:38] conclusion the Lord Christianity is all
[1:46:40] about me this world has been created for
[1:46:44] me amen everyone in my life is actually
[1:46:47] for me that's very selfish but if you
[1:46:50] think think about it God built this
[1:46:52] Earth that you could be here and God
[1:46:54] made this world the way it should be to
[1:46:55] mold you in a certain way amen and he
[1:46:59] brings the word your way to mold you in
[1:47:00] a certain way so it's all about you
[1:47:02] that's right a it's actually not about
[1:47:04] the other person it's actually about you
[1:47:08] we see we see David when he's rejected
[1:47:11] epsilon's you know there's a coup
[1:47:13] epsilon's come in he's fleeing for his
[1:47:15] life you know and there's that crippled
[1:47:17] up guy shimi whatever his name is of the
[1:47:19] House of Saul that's right daddy said
[1:47:21] Remember the House of David House of
[1:47:23] Saul after Saul Jonathan died there was
[1:47:25] Civil War then finally David came upon
[1:47:27] the throne the house of Saul was put
[1:47:29] down and then so here's a crippled up
[1:47:31] guy from the house of Saul and he's and
[1:47:33] he's cursing David and throwing stones
[1:47:35] at him and all these things and one of
[1:47:36] his body guards draws his sword says am
[1:47:38] I going to let the head of that dog you
[1:47:40] know leave his head on things he curses
[1:47:42] my king and David says God told him to
[1:47:46] do it that's right God told him to do
[1:47:49] it and I bet you if if you know if we
[1:47:52] went back into that time and you asked
[1:47:54] him shimi did you see an angel did he
[1:47:55] say curse David now he prob said no I
[1:47:58] just I just hate the guy amen but David
[1:48:02] could see the bigger picture because
[1:48:04] even even in that great time of distress
[1:48:07] God was testing David God was testing
[1:48:10] him to see are you cuz he could said
[1:48:12] yeah take his head off that guy's head
[1:48:13] would have been taken off and it would
[1:48:15] have been
[1:48:15] wrong you see but David cuz he wasn't
[1:48:19] looking through just a car away he was
[1:48:21] looking he was looking through spiritual
[1:48:23] eyes he could say no leave him alone God
[1:48:25] told him to do that that's right
[1:48:28] amen and David David had his falling his
[1:48:32] failings and all these things but David
[1:48:34] you know David was the perfect king
[1:48:37] that's right amen that's right I'll call
[1:48:39] you know you know Christ will be the son
[1:48:41] of David he's a man after my own heart
[1:48:44] he's a perfect
[1:48:46] King and so he was in the middle of the
[1:48:49] road I'll put it that way way cuz Christ
[1:48:51] was displaying himself in his life and
[1:48:54] then so in everything you could say God
[1:48:56] allowed that God calls why did David how
[1:48:59] come David did so well you know he could
[1:49:02] have killed Saul twice he could have
[1:49:03] done all these things but he knew God
[1:49:06] told him to do
[1:49:08] it amen he could be he could behave
[1:49:11] himself wisely that made Saul fear Him
[1:49:13] all the more it says because he knew God
[1:49:16] told him to do
[1:49:17] it amen what do mean the brothers trying
[1:49:21] to kill
[1:49:22] me amen trying to get the whole nation
[1:49:25] against me organize churches to come
[1:49:27] against
[1:49:28] me amen now I'm in the wilderness with
[1:49:31] these Gentiles that have that actually
[1:49:33] have no part of the promise but they
[1:49:35] believed he was coming into Power
[1:49:37] Hallelujah GL God allowed all that cuz
[1:49:41] God was proving because a king a king
[1:49:44] isn't just a king when everything's all
[1:49:45] Rosy and peachy and everything's nice a
[1:49:48] king is a king under pressure someone in
[1:49:51] someone in command it really proves what
[1:49:53] they're made of under pressure when the
[1:49:55] chips are down which way are we going to
[1:49:57] go and so God was proving this is what a
[1:50:00] king this is what a man in leadership is
[1:50:03] really like amen when the pressure and I
[1:50:06] our sister as well we should all be able
[1:50:08] to see ourselves in
[1:50:11] David you say well you're spiritualizing
[1:50:13] things too much David spiritualized it
[1:50:16] and God put it in his word amen maybe
[1:50:19] God told them to do it how you because
[1:50:22] if you can see it that way then you
[1:50:25] won't carnally respond I don't believe
[1:50:27] because you can see the bigger
[1:50:30] picture
[1:50:32] amen God's wanting to mold
[1:50:35] us
[1:50:40] now I just want to read
[1:50:45] this he says now this is in the era of
[1:50:48] God's Deliverance in 56 today is a
[1:50:51] compromising time that's

[1:52:12] trousers match my coat I want my
[1:52:14] experience to match God's Bible That's
[1:52:17] the matching time if you want to match
[1:52:19] something match experience against
[1:52:20] Paul's amen that's what we need today
[1:52:23] it's a matching time with Paul's faith
[1:52:24] in the Bible that's our example right
[1:52:27] real matching time don't try to match
[1:52:29] your neighbor match some Saint uh match
[1:52:32] some of the Saints in the Bible if
[1:52:34] you're a saint act like a saint walk
[1:52:36] like a saint dress like a saint talk
[1:52:38] like a saint pray like a saint believe
[1:52:40] like a saint dress like a saint be a
[1:52:42] saint live a saint die like a saint go
[1:52:44] to heaven like a saint amen
[1:52:47] amen where this is the mirror
[1:52:51] amen match if you want to help your
[1:52:54] brother or sister match the
[1:52:57] mirror amen say Lord take my cleanse me
[1:53:01] of my secret faults David prayed amen
[1:53:04] that's what we should be praying that
[1:53:06] God can that God can take us in such a
[1:53:08] way cuz the devil will try and pull you
[1:53:11] into a ditch amen he'll try and
[1:53:13] overthrow you any way you can he'll do
[1:53:15] it as long as you go off the way that's
[1:53:18] all he needs you to do that's all he's
[1:53:20] wanting to do amen and God's as I said
[1:53:24] God is proving your salvation God is
[1:53:26] proving you he said he says in
[1:53:29] Deuteronomy 8 those 40 years in the you
[1:53:32] know these 40 years in the desert and
[1:53:34] you you in the wilderness was to prove
[1:53:36] you and to Humble you Moses was telling
[1:53:38] Israel to prove what's in
[1:53:41] you and
[1:53:42] so I trust when we look when we look at
[1:53:47] everything that
[1:53:48] happens
[1:53:50] do you look at things
[1:53:52] carnally or do you look at things
[1:53:55] spiritually through a spiritual eye
[1:53:57] because if you look at things through a
[1:53:59] spiritual eye the whole church can turn
[1:54:01] against you but yet you still won't lose
[1:54:04] your love for them or for the
[1:54:07] Lord amen and sometimes God will allow
[1:54:11] that to happen to test you on
[1:54:14] it
[1:54:16] amen this person's at fault are they
[1:54:21] this person did wrong they may have and
[1:54:23] they may be at fault but it was
[1:54:25] happening now to test what's in
[1:54:27] you amen amen we don't want to be carnal
[1:54:31] and pull different ways and I don't want
[1:54:33] to I don't like concrete I don't want to
[1:54:35] build a
[1:54:37] bunker
[1:54:39] amen but my feelings I feel this is
[1:54:42] right the feel you this is Paramount if
[1:54:46] you can't take what you're doing into
[1:54:48] here you forget about what you're doing
[1:54:49] doing you should just throw it away
[1:54:52] because if you're led by your feelings
[1:54:54] you will end up in a ditch that sures
[1:54:57] the
[1:54:58] world
