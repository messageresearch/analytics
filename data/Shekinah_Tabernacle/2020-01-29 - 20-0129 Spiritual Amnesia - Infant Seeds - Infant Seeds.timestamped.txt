[0:50] hallelujah
[0:52] god bless you Saints isn't it good to be
[0:55] in the house of the Lord one more time
[0:58] you know the Lord is so good to us as
[1:02] mercy is new every morning and that
[1:05] mercy doesn't stop in the morning it's
[1:08] just new and the evening and continues
[1:10] because he's a merciful God you know he
[1:13] you know the Lord has come down and the
[1:15] same time to reveal himself and you know
[1:17] you know to many of these a lion but to
[1:20] Johnny saw a lamb a man and I believe
[1:23] that when we look we see mercy and love
[1:26] we see a scepter extended towards us and
[1:30] we have the opportunity to touch that
[1:32] scepter and receive our inheritance and
[1:35] if there's anyone here or hears this if
[1:38] you haven't received your inheritance
[1:41] today is the day you know right now in
[1:44] this place as the ingredients for your
[1:47] the greatest experience that you've ever
[1:50] had in your Christian walk just here not
[1:53] because it's any special day or
[1:55] unspecial day or busy or whatever but
[1:57] God is here and we've gathered in his
[1:59] name so who who here is as interested
[2:03] and taking that opportunity on board
[2:05] who's interested in that fine
[2:08] opportunity tonight we can enter in and
[2:11] have an expectation you know real
[2:14] expectation that tonight the Lord is
[2:17] going to speak to me and I believe that
[2:20] he'll come to me and speak to me I have

[2:46] wants to enjoy fellowship with us and so

[36:40] our hearts laughter's just with such a
[36:43] privileged people Lord Jesus Lord we
[36:47] just so thankful Lord that you chose
[36:48] ours Lord that this would be your place
[36:51] of your dwelling law and father I just
[36:54] pray that you take control of the
[36:57] service tonight Lord put any binding
[36:59] spirit just in subjection to the word

[37:13] the service to you in Jesus name Amen
[37:16] hallelujah Thank You musicians
[37:27] the Lord's been working with me since
[37:30] last year over this thought and rather
[37:34] being asked of our one of the preach and
[37:35] I like it when I can say yes I've got
[37:37] something you know sometimes he had
[37:39] asked to preach like a kind of hit of
[37:41] stop praying what what I'm gonna say
[37:42] that the Lord's been working and so I've
[37:46] got a lot of mail to deliver and you
[37:48] know every now and again you check your
[37:50] mail and you go down there and you see
[37:52] what something they're like oh you know
[37:53] sweet that's Kristin's car that's
[37:55] probably guess the outro in it like that
[37:57] now but sometimes you know there's bills
[38:00] or something you know - ministry of
[38:02] justice a ticket or something that's
[38:03] unpaid and it's like man I don't want to
[38:05] open that letter I'm just going to stick
[38:07] it back in the box but you've got to
[38:10] deal with it later as well or that can
[38:13] come back so I just want to deliver what
[38:16] I've got on my heart and I just pray
[38:17] that you'll see that it's not me as the
[38:20] law this it's trying to get this thought
[38:22] across so I got a lot of hay on the fork
[38:25] and I promise I'll be em I'll try I know
[38:28] it's Wednesday but I'll try and be
[38:30] shorter than Andy so we can turn a few
[38:34] got my slide show up peace First Samuel
[38:40] 15 verse 1 that's on the border if you
[38:42] want to read it there
[38:59] First Samuel 15 1 Samuel also said unto
[39:03] the unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint
[39:07] me to be king over as people over Israel
[39:09] now therefore hearken now unto the voice
[39:12] of the words of the Lord thus saith the
[39:14] Lord of hosts
[39:15] I remember that which I'm elected to
[39:18] Israel now I'm gonna be taking a lot of
[39:21] spiritual from the natural and what I
[39:24] read tonight so a malika's the flesh
[39:26] right a malika's as something that we've
[39:29] got to deal with and he's saying I
[39:31] remember which I'm elected to Israel how
[39:34] he laid and wait for him and the way
[39:36] when he came up from Egypt
[39:39] now go and smite a Malik and utterly
[39:42] destroy all that they have and spare
[39:44] them not that both slay man and woman
[39:46] infant suckling ox and sheep and camel
[39:49] and s so the Lord add his blessings to
[39:55] the word and you can take your seats
[39:56] I've got quite a few scriptures to start
[39:59] so Ezra we're on their journey out of
[40:03] Egypt and heading to the promised land
[40:05] but aim a liquid Wade laid and wait
[40:09] while they were on this journey he had
[40:11] laid him wait just to try and get into
[40:14] the camp just to try and get some things
[40:16] into them and he's so cunning he just
[40:19] slips them but God doesn't forget God's
[40:23] going to deal with Emily their enemy
[40:26] must be slayed every part of our flesh
[40:28] man must be brought into subjection to
[40:30] this word and you can't speak anything
[40:35] we've got to be diligent search out
[40:37] everything nothing nothing can be left
[40:40] there we read from Ezekiel 9 verse 1
[40:46] I've just been studying on this today
[40:49] and it's going to be hard not to go off
[40:50] on a tangent he cried also in mine ears
[40:53] with a loud voice saying cause then that
[40:56] have charged over the city to draw near
[40:58] even every man with his destroying
[41:00] weapon in his hand and behold six men
[41:03] came from the way of the high gate which
[41:06] life toward the north every man a
[41:08] slaughtering weapon in his hand
[41:11] and one man among them was clothed in
[41:14] white linen weather writers inkhorn by
[41:16] her side and they went and and stood
[41:19] beside the brazen altar so this now is
[41:23] typing into these these last vials that
[41:26] are going to be poured out at judgments
[41:28] that are going to be poured out at the
[41:29] end time and one of these these men have
[41:31] come up with these slaughtering weapons
[41:33] to slay and there's one here there's
[41:36] clothes of white linen with a writer's
[41:38] inkhorn it's a holy spirit and the glory
[41:41] of God if Ezra was gone up from the
[41:43] cherub whereupon he was to the threshold
[41:46] of the house and he called to the man
[41:48] clothed with linen which had the writers
[41:50] inkhorn by his side and the Lord said
[41:54] unto him go through the midst of the
[41:56] city go through the midst of the city
[41:58] through the midst of Jerusalem and set a
[42:03] mark upon the foreheads of the men that
[42:05] sigh and cry for the abominations that
[42:08] are done
[42:09] and the nuts thereof and to the others
[42:12] he said in mine hearing go ye after him
[42:14] through the city and smite let not your
[42:17] eyes spare neither have you petty slay
[42:20] utterly old and young both maids and
[42:22] little children and woman but come not
[42:24] near any man upon whom as the NARC and
[42:26] begin at my sanctuary then they began at
[42:29] the ancient men which were before the
[42:30] house their seeds that get into our life
[42:35] and the same you know it's funny that
[42:38] these angels are going to come and pour
[42:40] up the last seven plagues on the earth
[42:42] and at the same time God is sending
[42:45] those same destroying angels to destroy
[42:47] the Amalekites that have got into our
[42:50] own lives because we can't take an
[42:52] Amalekite into the promised land so
[42:54] we've got to deal with them and I'm
[42:58] going to put it in the mouth of a third
[42:59] witness and Joshua 6:17 and the city
[43:04] shall be accursed
[43:05] even it and all that are there unto the
[43:07] Lord only Rahab the harlot shall live
[43:09] she and all that are with her in her
[43:11] house because she had the messengers
[43:14] that was seen I see seven Rahab's
[43:17] I see you know that except that the
[43:19] messengers into a house that's
[43:21] just don't want to tangents and yeah and
[43:25] anyways keep yourself from the accursed
[43:27] thing let list you make yourselves a
[43:29] curse when you take up the occurs things
[43:31] and make the camp of Israel a curse and
[43:34] trouble it see when you take of an
[43:38] accursed thing of the world it actually
[43:40] comes in and it changes an atmosphere
[43:43] with you and it and it actually hex an
[43:45] effect on the whole camp so that's why
[43:47] it's so important that we pull together
[43:49] as one body that's why it's so important
[43:52] we talk and we fellowship and and
[43:53] sometimes you don't even have to be
[43:55] direct if something that's coming it
[43:56] just comes out just why your
[43:57] fellowshipping joshua and has had an arm
[44:02] and it's army they had a promise that
[44:04] they were going to take this promised
[44:07] land right but they crossed over jordan
[44:11] and we've we've crossed over jordan and
[44:13] you're on your on your journey in your
[44:14] promised land but there were squatters
[44:16] in the land right there's a Malick's in
[44:18] your land that had got to be dealt with
[44:25] so the people shouted when the priests
[44:28] blew with trumpets I just I like all the
[44:32] shouting and popping a trumpet so just
[44:34] that seems to go hand in hand and it
[44:36] came to pass when the people heard with
[44:38] the sound of a trumpet and the people
[44:41] shouted with a great shout that the wall
[44:43] fell down flat so that the people went
[44:46] up into the city every man straight
[44:48] before him and they took the city and
[44:50] this power and your voices are believer
[44:52] and you can shout to your enemy you can
[44:54] shout to a Malik and you can command
[44:56] them and those walls can be broken down
[44:57] but you have to speak to your enemy you
[45:00] have to know who it is that speaking
[45:02] because it's not you that's speaking to
[45:04] your enemy and they utterly destroyed
[45:08] all that was in the city both men and
[45:10] woman young and old sheep the nest with
[45:12] the edge of office order now I like it
[45:15] that their enemy is slain with the edge
[45:17] of the sword because there's only one
[45:19] way to slay here in in the end that's to
[45:20] bring it into subjection to the word so
[45:23] the Lord's just been working with me on
[45:25] this thought of of infant seeds seeds
[45:28] when they're just young just young and
[45:32] the reason that we sometimes miss
[45:35] these little seats and they get in us
[45:36] because we can get amnesia and Satan was
[45:42] very cunning in his own thoughts and how
[45:44] he could get into the bride you know
[45:45] that rich rag and it went after the went
[45:48] after the manchild it thought of it
[45:49] could deal and it could deal with the
[45:51] child if it can use the seed it's the
[45:54] easiest time to to get something in and
[45:57] he can get something into you easy if he
[45:59] comes after the seed he went after Jesus
[46:01] when he was a child because that was the
[46:02] most vulnerable time to get him but you
[46:06] can't defeat the plant God but we can
[46:10] take a lesson from that and we can go as
[46:12] seed while it's small while it's in this
[46:14] infant stage and then but we have to
[46:19] recognize what's actually taking place
[46:21] in our generation what's actually taking
[46:23] place and then he said what what's
[46:25] happened because when you lose sight of
[46:27] that you get amnesia because you forget
[46:31] the purpose of why we're here in
[46:36] questions and answers now what let me
[46:39] give you a little twister here just a
[46:41] minute I would say how many has the Holy
[46:44] Ghost all of you raise up your hand I'd
[46:46] say all right I'll see if you have the
[46:49] Bible said that they that had the Holy
[46:52] Ghost saw it and cried day and night for
[46:55] the abominations done in the city
[46:57] now how many hand would go up how many
[47:00] of you can't rest at night so full of
[47:02] joy the power of God and so sad for the
[47:04] people that's lost that night day and
[47:08] night you weep and cry for the
[47:10] abominations you won't see who would be
[47:13] in that city how many is that's in the
[47:16] church that's what the Bible said the
[47:17] holy spoke holy spirit evidence was now
[47:22] you know that I I believe that you can
[47:27] sigh and cry and your heart it might not
[47:30] be so much outwardly seen but as you go
[47:33] through the city you're just crying and
[47:35] you're upset and you can't stand the
[47:38] things that are around you but may we
[47:41] never get so so cold that we that we're
[47:45] not touched by the Sun
[47:49] he told the ceiling angel a zq9 that's
[47:52] right he said take go through the city
[47:55] set a mark upon those who saw him cry
[47:57] for the abominations dead in the city
[47:59] the rest of them let the destroying
[48:01] angel destroy them no matter how much
[48:04] members there was how many things
[48:06] they've done seed put a man with an ink
[48:08] corn Rider and a man with an ink worn
[48:11] rider dressed in white which represented
[48:13] the holy spirit come forth and put a
[48:15] mark upon all of them that cider cried
[48:18] for the abominations done in the city
[48:19] now you say and watch what he said
[48:23] they're also slay utter utterly little
[48:25] children old woman babies kill them all
[48:27] little children yes when Joshua entered
[48:31] the land of Canaan he said don't you let
[48:32] one of them live that's a cute little
[48:35] baby a little of malachite or
[48:36] am i right killer you remember he'll
[48:39] grow up to be an Amalekite
[48:40] he'll pollute the camp and when those
[48:43] little things come back like that
[48:44] disagreeing with the Word of God get rid
[48:46] of that thing I don't care what
[48:48] denomination it belongs to you say well
[48:53] they're good I don't care how good of
[48:55] people they are if they're contrary to
[48:57] that word get the thing out of you it's
[48:59] a growing little Amalekite looks cute
[49:02] looks innocent
[49:04] it looks like it's alright but you don't
[49:06] have anything to do with it you stay
[49:08] away from it well brother Brennan might
[49:11] go down here because well I don't you
[49:13] just remember any Amalekite anything
[49:15] that denies the words stay away from it
[49:17] have nothing to do with it a little
[49:19] how many believes that that's the truth
[49:21] sure it is see stay away from it stay
[49:25] away from it there's something rising up
[49:27] stay away from it if there's any
[49:30] question in your mind whether this is
[49:32] right wrong stay away from it now I want
[49:39] to go back to my thought my title of
[49:41] spiritual amnesia and we're going to go
[49:43] to a loss and this is what brother
[49:45] Brennan top for a scripture but I'm
[49:48] trying to merge three things together
[49:50] here with all this hey that's on the
[49:52] fork I'm trying to merge together the
[49:54] problem the cause and the remedy so we
[49:58] can overcome and not grow an Amalekite
[50:02] so Amos 3 verse 1 here this word that
[50:08] the Lord has spoken against you O
[50:10] children of Israel against the whole
[50:12] family which I brought up out of the
[50:15] land of Egypt saying he's speaking to
[50:17] you that have come up out of the land of
[50:19] Egypt you only have I known of all the
[50:22] families of the earth therefore I will
[50:24] punish you for all your iniquities can
[50:27] two walk together except they be agreed
[50:29] well a lion roar in the forest when he
[50:32] hath no prey well a young lion cry out
[50:35] of his den if he have taken nothing can
[50:38] a bird fall on a snare upon the earth
[50:40] where there is no gen for him shall one
[50:43] take up a snare from the earth and have
[50:45] taken nothing at all
[50:46] shall a trumpet be blown in the city and
[50:49] the people not be afraid shall there be
[50:51] evil in the city and the LORD hath not
[50:53] done it surely the Lord God will do
[50:56] nothing but he revealed his secret unto
[50:58] his servants the prophets the lion hath
[51:01] wrought who will not fear the Lord God
[51:03] hath spoken who can not but prophesy now
[51:08] I want to speak a bit about Amos and
[51:10] then come back and just look at this
[51:12] text a bit more but you know brother
[51:15] Brennan tells a bit of history will
[51:17] drama rises Amos because we don't know a
[51:20] lot about him in the Bible and I think
[51:24] we can parallel a lot of what I'm also
[51:26] seeing into this day and age maybe he
[51:29] was even seeing this day when he wrote
[51:31] this prophecy and as an Amos appeared in
[51:35] Israel in a time when when it was in
[51:38] great prosperity that they had
[51:40] possession of the land and all things
[51:41] were good and you know the churches were
[51:46] big I'm sure that it was a time when
[51:49] everybody was settled and not worried
[51:51] and not didn't have any fear didn't have
[51:53] any fear of the enemy and I bet this
[51:58] Amos he just sort of appeared from
[52:00] nowhere you know he doesn't have any
[52:02] fellowship cards he doesn't have any
[52:04] association to any church he nobody even
[52:08] knew who Amos was
[52:12] and I was thinking you know like just
[52:17] because Israel was in this time of
[52:19] prosperity and god bless Israel when
[52:21] they were what when they were when they
[52:23] were doing right god bless Israel but
[52:25] just because they were being blessed
[52:27] that didn't mean that they were doing
[52:28] all things good to be blessed for a time
[52:31] and that fall again and to the true
[52:33] believer I see a blessing it it's not
[52:36] monetary I mean I don't need a monetary
[52:40] blessing of up to be in the will of the
[52:42] Lord following the will of the Lord I'd
[52:43] rather my blessings come and seeing the
[52:45] power of God
[52:47] display seeing the power of God works so
[52:51] amos wasn't fooled by any of the riches
[52:53] in the city as he went through Jerusalem
[52:55] you know he was a country man he was a
[52:58] herdsmen and he seemed to just appear
[53:01] out of nowhere he didn't have this great
[53:02] family name is it to be FIRREA was a lot
[53:06] like brother Brennan it seems to be just
[53:09] the pattern that God uses as prophets
[53:12] you know they won't see how could any
[53:17] good thing either come out of Kentucky
[53:19] I mean Nazareth you know that's just
[53:23] God's pattern it's the way he does
[53:24] things the wise men at that age wouldn't
[53:27] even consider one that come from such a
[53:29] place then as quick as these prophets
[53:31] showed up they disappear and they
[53:33] quickly forgotten
[53:35] it was from Cain seed that came forth
[53:38] the first civilization there Enoch built
[53:40] but ceased seed were herdsmen they
[53:42] weren't they weren't part of this the
[53:44] city life wasn't part of God's seed
[53:47] there was something about the city that
[53:49] should make the seed of God's eye and
[53:51] crying you for the wickedness that's
[53:54] done there and you know I'm not trying
[53:56] to preach shall I go move out to the
[53:58] country but you know like I enjoy the
[54:00] open space I love the country I come
[54:02] into the city all right man I just I
[54:04] don't want to be here something just
[54:07] inside me I just oh I just makes me
[54:09] uncomfortable and nervous in my own skin
[54:12] so as Amos was coming through the city
[54:15] it wasn't the attractions that we're
[54:17] catching as a tension you know I can
[54:20] imagine
[54:21] say if Amos flow into Wellington today
[54:25] and there's many beautiful things you
[54:26] know I wonder if he went out over to
[54:28] peripera Beach beautiful beach and I
[54:31] wonder if he just looked over the top of
[54:33] those half maybe two dozen half-naked
[54:36] woman and just come then what a
[54:37] beautiful beach see out to Kathy Island
[54:40] what a beautiful beach
[54:41] so it wasn't aimless he was looking and
[54:43] going how can how can these people bet
[54:47] do this how have we gone so far away
[54:48] from the Word of God he didn't actually
[54:50] notice any of that beauty all he seen
[54:53] was the Sun done in the city there was
[54:58] no beauty that could they could calm his
[55:01] grieving heart because he was carrying
[55:03] the word of the Lord he had a message
[55:04] for the people amen
[55:08] I imagine he was a bit of an oddball you
[55:10] know he probably looked like a bum
[55:11] amongst us fashion city looked a bit
[55:14] old-fashioned and he had nowhere to
[55:17] preach had no pulpit no one would accept
[55:19] them into their pulpit to preach no
[55:22] fellowship card but he had a message he
[55:25] had thus saith the Lord to get across to
[55:27] the people so I wonder how he would be
[55:30] received today if he come but thus saith
[55:33] the Lord would anybody have a time to
[55:35] hear him but anybody receive what he had
[55:38] to say I find that not many people would
[55:41] believe what he had to say there might
[55:42] be a small group I'd be a small group
[55:45] here that would they would hear what
[55:46] Amos had to say he had preached the word
[55:49] for sure and it would be the original
[55:51] seed now I wondered what if Amos was to
[55:54] start a prayer line and start the what
[55:57] have he come into this church and he
[55:59] started a prayer line and he started to
[56:01] discern your thoughts
[56:02] oh my because that's where Satan plants
[56:07] as unfit seeds right that's the
[56:09] battleground and that's where he plants
[56:11] these little thoughts just little seeds
[56:14] and I just wonder you know like thinking
[56:19] back on brother Brennan's discernment
[56:21] line he'd be there and he have a prayer
[56:22] line and as he started to discern the
[56:24] people's thoughts as they come up the
[56:26] prayer line other ones behind would
[56:28] start leaving the prayer lines start
[56:30] getting out because they had something a
[56:33] little Amalekite a little seed there
[56:35] they might go to church be good people
[56:37] right
[56:38] but they just didn't want to deal with
[56:40] that Amalekite you have to be prepared
[56:43] to deal there's nothing wrong with
[56:45] having a wrong seed there if you're
[56:46] willing to deal with it God puts his
[56:48] finger on any go Lord I've got to deal
[56:50] with that I hope no one in here would
[56:54] get out of the prayer line why did
[56:58] Israel keep backsliding and letting in
[57:00] worldly ism the reason is as time went
[57:03] on they forgot they forgot what God had
[57:06] done for them they had forgot the
[57:08] battles that they had fought they forgot
[57:10] the men that had died died in the fight
[57:13] they had forgotten the martyrs they
[57:16] forgot that amnesia and the more time
[57:20] that went on since those battles the
[57:23] more they forget it's easy to forget I
[57:25] was thinking the other day what about
[57:27] that mass shooting that happened down in
[57:29] Christchurch whoever hears about that
[57:31] now it's never on the news the only
[57:34] thing I ever hear about on the news is
[57:36] guns are bad we need a banner what about
[57:39] the guy that did it what about the
[57:40] people that died all we hear about his
[57:41] gun see we live in such a corrupt world
[57:44] such a corrupt world it's easy to forget
[57:46] and the general public doesn't even
[57:48] think twice of it I haven't heard a
[57:50] single person say anything to me about
[57:51] it for months
[57:55] so when we leave this church and to me I
[57:59] would say when you come off that street
[58:02] and you come across that footpath you
[58:04] look up that's the most beautiful sight
[58:08] there is in the city it's the most
[58:10] beautiful places in the city there is
[58:12] nothing in this city that should attract
[58:14] your attention more than coming to this
[58:17] place anything else out there is just
[58:19] vanity it's just vain okay maybe some of
[58:22] your homes are beautiful but churches
[58:24] you all come together and it's just
[58:25] beautiful all together you know but when
[58:31] I go out of this building I don't see
[58:33] beauty out there I don't see anything of
[58:35] this world
[58:36] that's going to hold me here because
[58:39] I've caught a glimpse of my heavenly
[58:41] home and there's nothing that's going to
[58:43] hold me here
[58:49] spiritual amnesia and of his voice would
[58:52] be here tonight and Birmingham I would
[58:55] claim the same thing to the churches the
[58:58] very God you claim to have served will
[59:00] destroy you someday I'm not speaking to
[59:02] this audience here these tapes go around
[59:04] the world now remember that is true then
[59:07] he found out when he come into the city
[59:09] oh all this stuff I wonder he must have
[59:12] felt to look and see the decay of the
[59:14] people of God to whom he was seen I
[59:17] wonder brother branham's really just
[59:21] talking about how he feels I wonder how
[59:24] he would receive from now I wonder if if
[59:28] he would come and I wonder would we
[59:30] cooperate with him what we given our
[59:32] best would we give him our attention
[59:34] would we repent and be told us that we
[59:36] should go back to the word of the Lord
[59:38] and do what the way the Lord said so I
[59:41] wonder what our sisters would do about
[59:44] their Bob here what they would if they
[59:45] would lately here grow out again if Amos
[59:48] come on he would preach it I'm telling
[59:51] you that because it's the word of the
[59:52] Lord some get out on the street there
[59:54] and mow the yard out in the yard when
[59:56] men he found them in that day with a bad
[59:59] case of a disease spirit have I know
[1:00:01] Anna preached on a Wednesday night I'm
[1:00:03] not going to write anything until Monday
[1:00:05] facts and information and because people
[1:00:07] seem to have lost the memories of what's
[1:00:09] taking place they turn their back on the
[1:00:12] facts and we even see people that have
[1:00:15] had great experiences even our friends
[1:00:17] that have had great experiences with the
[1:00:20] Lord and they forget those experiences
[1:00:22] that they've had and that causes amnesia
[1:00:24] and you you can't lose your salvation
[1:00:26] that you lose your identity you start to
[1:00:29] live below your privileges because you
[1:00:31] don't realize who you are you forget and
[1:00:34] I where we're in a battle and we must
[1:00:38] fight don't lose your identity while
[1:00:42] everybody else is rejoicing and shouting
[1:00:45] and singing the praises of God and you
[1:00:47] just feel so down and robbed it because
[1:00:49] you've lost your identity other causes
[1:00:55] I found this interesting other causes
[1:00:57] include head and brain injuries and I
[1:00:59] thought isn't that just true because
[1:01:01] this is where the battleground is
[1:01:02] so it's a head injury that causes you to
[1:01:05] lose your memories
[1:01:07] and when Satan comes in and that little
[1:01:09] battleground and plant seeds and it
[1:01:11] causes you to get amnesia be sober as a
[1:01:17] devil walketh around as a roaring lion
[1:01:19] seeking whom he may devour
[1:01:21] you know this there's so many things we
[1:01:26] just let little Amalekites come in we
[1:01:28] need to be so ready to fight this enemy
[1:01:31] you can you can become you know these
[1:01:35] little seeds when they grow up they grow
[1:01:37] into that full malachite so for the sake
[1:01:41] of a little little wine for my stomach's
[1:01:43] sake it seems like it's okay you know it
[1:01:46] seems innocent like it's not hurting
[1:01:48] anyone I'm not getting drunk it's just a
[1:01:50] little innocent seed but you've got to
[1:01:53] look at when that seed grows up and it
[1:01:55] just when it's a little sprout it looks
[1:01:57] just like the wheat right it just looks
[1:01:59] the same but what our kids because
[1:02:01] they've got a drinking problem but you
[1:02:04] sowed the seed as a baby got to be so
[1:02:08] careful what Amalekites we let into our
[1:02:11] life may be so innocent to us but it's
[1:02:15] so damaging for someone else and brother
[1:02:19] branham speaks of three other things
[1:02:21] that will cause spiritual amnesia and
[1:02:23] it's preaching a different doctrine than
[1:02:25] what brother ben's preaching and you
[1:02:27] start to question well is this right
[1:02:29] well that's right I don't know all I'm
[1:02:31] just going to leave the message because
[1:02:33] I don't know what's right you've got to
[1:02:35] know who you're following and you've got
[1:02:37] to have trust in what you believe don't
[1:02:39] get between two opinions that will pull
[1:02:41] you away now there is a place when you
[1:02:48] get this amnesia you might get like
[1:02:50] Nebuchadnezzar who was exalted himself
[1:02:53] one time and godly didn't think he was
[1:02:55] an animal and he left out in the
[1:02:57] wilderness and eat grass like an ox and
[1:02:59] as his grow down his body like eagle
[1:03:01] feathers and he had become the heart of
[1:03:03] a beast in them see that was M neva
[1:03:05] because he had forgotten that he was
[1:03:07] king he had forgotten that he was a
[1:03:09] human being and he thought he was an
[1:03:11] animal so he acted like an animal
[1:03:13] because he forgot he was a human being
[1:03:16] that's so easy today and we forget
[1:03:19] sometimes what the Christian Church is
[1:03:21] we act like the world that shows that
[1:03:24] we've got spiritual amnesia because that
[1:03:26] you don't act like a Christian you act
[1:03:28] like the world you receive the heart of
[1:03:30] the world and it causes this I want to
[1:03:34] be a Christian I'm going to be you know
[1:03:36] trying to stay the other when I first I
[1:03:40] was an atheist before I got converted I
[1:03:44] hated the idea of Christianity and when
[1:03:48] the Lord showed me and numbers and pet I
[1:03:51] didn't know I didn't I had no idea what
[1:03:53] the gospel was I had no idea but I just
[1:03:55] see that there's a God I'm gonna serve
[1:03:57] them so if you're gonna be a Christian
[1:04:01] be a real Christian don't be a lukewarm
[1:04:02] it's just fear and it has no virtue to
[1:04:05] it all it has no strength you crush them
[1:04:08] walk at all I'm gonna skip details
[1:04:11] because I'm a ripple through the message
[1:04:14] and it's Satan getting in with a little
[1:04:16] seed and at that time that seed looks
[1:04:19] innocent just a little doctrine but as
[1:04:21] it begins to grow that seed grows into a
[1:04:24] tree and the tree doesn't look like the
[1:04:26] word so we've got to watch they're
[1:04:28] shocked and because of that shock now
[1:04:31] it's cause people when they see little
[1:04:33] things like tombs like bride age and all
[1:04:37] these other things that come up because
[1:04:39] of shock because of a false doctrine now
[1:04:42] they're scared shocks caused them to
[1:04:44] have amnesia amnesia and rather been
[1:04:47] took my story again on Sunday morning
[1:04:49] when he talked about those French
[1:04:51] soldiers they come back from it was
[1:04:53] moving him the guard was just following
[1:04:57] him to see what he would do and my son
[1:04:59] and the amnesia broke and left them now
[1:05:04] maybe there's been someone you know
[1:05:06] that's had shock in their life that's
[1:05:08] called systemic injury in their life
[1:05:11] then they've got amnesia and now you can
[1:05:13] bring them back by bringing them back to
[1:05:15] the word and just fellowshipping and
[1:05:18] going through the scriptures I kind of
[1:05:20] thought like those two that were on the
[1:05:22] road from the males and they were sad
[1:05:24] they were said the Christ had just risen
[1:05:27] from the dead and they were said
[1:05:29] they had the worst amnesia ever but look
[1:05:32] what Jesus did he started a fellowship
[1:05:35] Oh false life harder you know it's so
[1:05:37] easily forgotten the promises and as he
[1:05:40] fellowship then it were what about this
[1:05:41] and what about this and the amnesia
[1:05:43] broke and they recognized that it was
[1:05:46] Jesus Christ among them sometimes we
[1:05:49] need a instead of casting people off all
[1:05:51] the leaders don't see the message maybe
[1:05:53] we just need to get past our own
[1:05:55] thoughts and hurts and just fellowship a
[1:05:58] little bit just fellowship talk about
[1:05:59] the word let the amnesia break amen
[1:06:07] you could be the one that draws near to
[1:06:10] that person so this is my foundation my
[1:06:16] foundation I want to point out what
[1:06:19] brother Branham is showing us as the
[1:06:21] thrust of this message in M Niva you
[1:06:24] know up until 1963 s preaching sermons
[1:06:27] man age sermons he's trying to help you
[1:06:29] along the road grow as a Christian but
[1:06:32] after 9:00 after 1963 he says ministry
[1:06:35] changes and he keeps saying like what
[1:06:37] the Lord did remember sunset mountain
[1:06:39] remember this remember this remember the
[1:06:42] visions and he's pointing back he's
[1:06:43] looking back to something that's taken
[1:06:45] place I read from the unveiling of God
[1:06:50] now my subject this morning I trust that
[1:06:53] God will revealed us and each time the
[1:06:55] few who would take the tapes and listen
[1:06:57] I hope and trust that you have had a
[1:07:00] spiritual understanding of what God has
[1:07:03] been trying to get over to the church
[1:07:05] without saying it right out see it's a
[1:07:09] thing sometime we have to say things in
[1:07:11] such a way that it might thin down and
[1:07:13] might bring some to go out some to leave
[1:07:15] and some to ponder over but it's done
[1:07:18] that's done purposely it must be done
[1:07:20] that way then it must be that some would
[1:07:24] say you mean God would purposely do a
[1:07:26] thing like that he certainly did and he
[1:07:29] does you this way you can so often
[1:07:33] someone will text me and they'll say oh
[1:07:36] do you know where brother Branham see
[1:07:38] this I can't find it anywhere in the
[1:07:41] message
[1:07:42] and it's like brother Brennan so often
[1:07:47] you cannot find a direct quote for what
[1:07:49] God has revealed to you because God is
[1:07:50] revealing this message to you personally
[1:07:52] but things are said that you might catch
[1:07:55] it but it's not revealed to the public
[1:07:56] and you can't find a direct quote in
[1:07:59] your searching search right now it's in
[1:08:01] there but God's revealed it to you but
[1:08:02] you can't find it it's hidden from the
[1:08:05] public so just coming back to his
[1:08:10] scripture that he took for amnesia he
[1:08:13] said well a lion draw in the forest when
[1:08:16] he hath no prey the Lions not going to
[1:08:18] give us victory raw if he has no prey he
[1:08:21] rules because his quarters pray well the
[1:08:23] young lion cry out of his Dean of the
[1:08:25] taken nothing no he's not
[1:08:27] he said he's taken nothing can a bird
[1:08:29] fall upon us near we're no gina's from
[1:08:32] do you understand what what the prophets
[1:08:35] saying here nothing's not done for no
[1:08:37] purpose is a purpose why these things
[1:08:39] are done shall one take up a snare of
[1:08:42] the earth and having taken nothing at
[1:08:44] all now this prophecy he's picking up
[1:08:48] from Amos
[1:08:49] he's relating it into his own his own
[1:08:51] ministry shall a trumpet be blown in the
[1:08:54] city and the people not be afraid shall
[1:08:57] there be evil in the city and the LORD
[1:08:59] hath not done it surely the Lord God
[1:09:01] will do nothing but he revealeth secrets
[1:09:03] unto the prophets the lion hath roared
[1:09:06] who will not fear the Lord God hath
[1:09:09] spoken who can but prophesy now I just
[1:09:13] want to bring this back into Revelation
[1:09:15] 5 and just pick it up here and I saw and
[1:09:20] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:09:22] throne a book written within and on the
[1:09:24] backside sealed with seven seals and I
[1:09:27] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:09:29] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:09:33] book and to loose the seals thereof has
[1:09:35] the book been open has the seals been
[1:09:37] open amen and no man in heaven nor on
[1:09:43] earth neither under earth was able to
[1:09:45] open the book neither to look thereon
[1:09:47] and I wit much because no man was found
[1:09:51] worthy to open the book and to read the
[1:09:53] book neither to look thereon then who
[1:09:55] opened the book
[1:09:57] wasn't brother Brennan that was opening
[1:09:59] the book no man was worthy and one of
[1:10:04] the elders saith unto me weep not behold
[1:10:07] the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:10:09] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:10:11] and to loose the seven seals thereof so
[1:10:15] he's saying there in the name of the
[1:10:18] lion hath roared who will not fear that
[1:10:21] the Lord God has spoken
[1:10:22] who can but prophesy the Lord God has
[1:10:26] spoken who shall not fear yet we can
[1:10:30] walk around in this world and act as if
[1:10:33] we have no fear of God on us and and not
[1:10:35] take seriously the things that are
[1:10:37] taking place right now it has never been
[1:10:40] an event since Jesus Christ rose from
[1:10:43] the dead like what's happened in your
[1:10:44] generation and yet it just walked
[1:10:48] day-to-day life and not even think twice
[1:10:50] about the sin that's around us we have
[1:10:53] to be so on guard of leading their
[1:10:55] Amalekite come into our life amen
[1:11:00] brother Branham would point up to that
[1:11:02] cloud and he would say that's our judge
[1:11:04] up there you know but as the seals
[1:11:07] unveiled we begin to swing a minister an
[1:11:10] evangelist gets up in the pulpit and
[1:11:12] he's tearing stripes a few hands
[1:11:14] shouting preaching like I don't preach
[1:11:16] and he's but I'm hoping that you don't
[1:11:19] because some people say Manny was just
[1:11:21] preaching at me I hope you don't see a
[1:11:23] lion I hope you see a lamb as it was
[1:11:26] being slain because he's he's loves you
[1:11:29] and has ministry is to help pull you
[1:11:32] from that condition and pull you up into
[1:11:34] your promise you've got to see the land
[1:11:38] and if the Word of God came to us then
[1:11:42] God came to us you cannot separate God
[1:11:45] in His Word something change from was
[1:11:48] what it was all the way through the
[1:11:50] church ages and marriage takes place
[1:11:52] here now so the bride had been wearing a
[1:11:56] veil for 2,000 years when we got married
[1:11:59] I don't know how they do it now because
[1:12:01] traditions just seemed to get worse and
[1:12:03] worse and worse but when we got married
[1:12:05] my wife wore a veil over her face and as
[1:12:08] she come up
[1:12:10] she was veiled and she couldn't see
[1:12:13] through that veil clearly she could see
[1:12:14] in the Eze looking through maybe like a
[1:12:16] glass darkly but she couldn't see me
[1:12:18] clearly and the bride's been walking
[1:12:21] 2000 years with that veil over her face
[1:12:24] and then when Christ come in 63 and he
[1:12:27] unveiled the word he took that veil off
[1:12:29] her face because when the marriage takes
[1:12:31] place
[1:12:32] I took the veil off her face and now she
[1:12:34] sees me as face to face and that's
[1:12:37] what's happened in this generation the
[1:12:46] unveiling of God when this veil has took
[1:12:49] off the word the traditions has taken
[1:12:52] off the word as Jesus once said when you
[1:12:54] see me you see the father see God and
[1:12:58] his word as one now you understand when
[1:13:01] the word is manifested what does it see
[1:13:04] jesus said search the Scriptures you
[1:13:06] think you have you believe God believe
[1:13:09] also in me if I do not the works of my
[1:13:12] father then don't believe me but if I do
[1:13:14] the works I and my father are one when
[1:13:17] you see me you have seen the father and
[1:13:20] when you see the word manifest you see
[1:13:23] the father God because the word is the
[1:13:26] father the word is God and the word may
[1:13:30] mean efest as God Himself taking his own
[1:13:33] word and manifesting it among believers
[1:13:36] now nothing can make it love but
[1:13:38] believers just believers and then
[1:13:42] another one there if one would come
[1:13:46] today like that that would be rejected
[1:13:48] just the same they had a bad case of it
[1:13:51] and so we have today the spiritual signs
[1:13:54] and the preaching of an ordained
[1:13:55] Messenger of God never stirred them any
[1:13:58] more the woman could laugh right in
[1:14:00] their face and say I don't have to go
[1:14:02] and hear such stuff as that if that
[1:14:04] hasn't repeated again
[1:14:06] what is it spiritual amnesia exactly
[1:14:08] that forgotten that God and his word is
[1:14:11] the same he cannot change it I mean they
[1:14:15] had amnesia
[1:14:18] now the profits gone brother branham's
[1:14:22] gone but the word never left the word
[1:14:25] come to us and the word stayed the
[1:14:27] profit had to go because he had to
[1:14:29] decrease just as when Jesus came the
[1:14:32] profit had to decrease so the word could
[1:14:34] increase Jesus was the word and the word
[1:14:37] is here to increase and by coming into
[1:14:40] you you make it live and you start to
[1:14:43] manifest the word and the word is on
[1:14:45] display to this world but when you begin
[1:14:50] to mess what God's doing you get to come
[1:14:53] into this place of amnesia because you
[1:14:55] don't take what's taking place serious
[1:14:58] enough because of you knew what was
[1:15:00] taking place it would be so serious and
[1:15:02] nothing else mattered nothing else
[1:15:05] matters
[1:15:05] God's here with me and he's manifesting
[1:15:08] and he's judging this world he's about
[1:15:10] to pour out all these vials of plagues
[1:15:12] and judgments and because we forget it's
[1:15:16] like we let things come in that we
[1:15:19] should never let come into our life and
[1:15:24] I just wonder you know if every now and
[1:15:26] again we ourselves don't get struck with
[1:15:28] a better debt amnesia and I'm talking
[1:15:30] about myself too I'm preaching to myself
[1:15:32] this message I just wonder you know we a
[1:15:36] little bit of YouTube here a little bit
[1:15:38] of YouTube there these things and then
[1:15:40] you notice I was talking to a friend
[1:15:42] about this you know because this is what
[1:15:45] happens to me I start watching something
[1:15:47] and I'm like man I've got to get there
[1:15:49] I'll start watching a guitar video like
[1:15:51] now I got to get that guitar but it's
[1:15:53] just a seed it's just an analogy and if
[1:15:56] you do the same with the word then the
[1:15:57] word becomes more and more real and you
[1:15:59] do the same with the word teach train up
[1:16:09] a child in the way he should go and when
[1:16:11] he is old he will not depart from it now
[1:16:13] I believe that this scripture can also
[1:16:16] fit in to a believer we know it doesn't
[1:16:19] matter how old you are when you come in
[1:16:20] you're just a babe now there's gotta be
[1:16:22] something poured into that life while
[1:16:25] he's young it's a trip to Train and so
[1:16:28] that he grows up in the right way
[1:16:29] just that whether you're kids as well
[1:16:31] naturally
[1:16:32] but you're so vulnerable in that early
[1:16:34] stage of life and so I want to relay it
[1:16:40] better the conversation I had and it
[1:16:42] doesn't matter who said it the after the
[1:16:44] conversation the Lord started showing me
[1:16:46] how it related in a spiritual sense so
[1:16:49] one of my friends is it's quite hard on
[1:16:52] his kids you know go swimming that wear
[1:16:55] pants you know the message says we're
[1:16:57] parents or that we're parents and he's
[1:17:00] separate the boys swimming from the
[1:17:02] guilty
[1:17:02] he's quite hard line on them and so my
[1:17:05] friend says well you know and I always
[1:17:07] actually thought the same way too until
[1:17:10] maybe recently when as kids grow up
[1:17:12] they'll resent that because that was
[1:17:14] forced upon them and the Lord started
[1:17:17] dealing with me and saying you know what
[1:17:19] that's true but there's something that
[1:17:22] changes that and because I know my
[1:17:24] friend really well and I know how much
[1:17:27] time he pours into the life of those
[1:17:29] kids that no one else sees and so those
[1:17:32] kids now have a respect for him and a
[1:17:35] love for him because he's every night
[1:17:37] and the word showing them so that it's
[1:17:40] not just a law to them they actually
[1:17:42] know why they're doing it and he spends
[1:17:44] that time now they're not going to do it
[1:17:46] because it's law they do it be out of
[1:17:48] respect for father because they love
[1:17:51] that and they want to please dad and I
[1:17:53] think it's the same in our own Christian
[1:17:55] walk the Lord was saying you know what
[1:17:57] that's the same for a believer when
[1:17:59] dad's got your heart
[1:18:01] he doesn't have to force law down your
[1:18:04] throat because you want to do it because
[1:18:05] you want to please dad what is dead like
[1:18:07] and dad taught me this
[1:18:09] I love dad so much I'm gonna stay with
[1:18:11] us and that's what we should be like we
[1:18:13] have to have a relationship with God
[1:18:16] amen as Paul said you know all things
[1:18:20] are lawful for me that not all things
[1:18:22] are expedient because some things are a
[1:18:24] seed that will grow into a big ugly tree
[1:18:26] I can do it and the Lord won't condemn
[1:18:29] me if I'm got the seed of God in my
[1:18:31] heart I'm saved but it's not going to be
[1:18:33] good for my Christian walk it's not
[1:18:35] gonna be good for those around me
[1:18:39] we need to cast out those sprouts kill
[1:18:42] the young he'll our Young Amalekites I
[1:18:48] just want to give a few examples of how
[1:18:50] Satan has perverted and started tearing
[1:18:53] apart civilization in a short space of
[1:18:56] time because I don't know if you've
[1:18:58] noticed but in a short space of time you
[1:19:00] go you take back 17 years and you see
[1:19:03] what Satan has done in this ages just
[1:19:06] shocking and we should be so concerned
[1:19:08] about it we should be we shouldn't just
[1:19:11] accept that as the normal we should we
[1:19:13] should be we should be protecting our
[1:19:16] young we should be protecting the weaker
[1:19:18] ones on the Lord because when we
[1:19:20] entertain something we're actually
[1:19:22] entertaining the Spirit that's behind
[1:19:24] that thing and we're invite we're
[1:19:26] creating an atmosphere so I want to just
[1:19:31] give a couple of things for examples and
[1:19:33] I'm not condemning anybody if they do
[1:19:36] any of these things or anything I'm just
[1:19:37] using these four examples because this
[1:19:39] is what the Lord's laid on my heart to
[1:19:41] show and then I'm going to put it in
[1:19:44] your court and then you can consider
[1:19:46] whether the seed of what either you do
[1:19:48] is an Amalekite or not right so you see
[1:19:51] where I'm going you you test yourself so
[1:19:56] for an example kids like to sing these
[1:19:59] songs and clapping dances and all stuff
[1:20:02] and so one thing that caught my
[1:20:06] attention is that Ryan ringa roses
[1:20:09] pocket full of posies a tishoo a tishoo
[1:20:11] we all fall down
[1:20:13] ashes and the water ashes and the sea we
[1:20:15] all jump up with a 1-2-3 really fun for
[1:20:18] the kids right really fun but what's
[1:20:21] what's the spirit behind that behind
[1:20:24] that right because it goes back to the
[1:20:27] Great Plague and II and England and 1665
[1:20:30] called Black Death it was a horrible
[1:20:33] plague and it killed quarter of London's
[1:20:36] population the Roses referred to the
[1:20:40] rash that would break forth and the body
[1:20:42] and the posies would refer to the
[1:20:46] flowers that they used to carry to stop
[1:20:49] the smell of the infection and then the
[1:20:52] following thing was a
[1:20:53] ritesh ooh and death we all fall down
[1:20:55] because it was no cure for the black
[1:20:57] death plague i had no medicine they died
[1:21:00] and so many people died ashes in the
[1:21:02] water ashes into the sea they had to
[1:21:04] just cremate bodies and get rid of the
[1:21:06] ashes was a horrible thing now what's
[1:21:09] the spirit behind that song what's that
[1:21:13] what are we entertaining with it see
[1:21:16] then I come into this church here and
[1:21:18] there's all these young and I see father
[1:21:21] Abraham had many sons many sons had
[1:21:25] father Abraham I am one of them and you
[1:21:28] are - Iceman yeah you know what's the
[1:21:31] spirit behind it
[1:21:33] hallelujah the kids rejoicing you're
[1:21:35] teaching them in the way you want to
[1:21:36] grow up see there's a spirit behind both
[1:21:38] of those things and the first one might
[1:21:41] not be wrong on the natural the kid
[1:21:43] doesn't understand what it's singing
[1:21:45] right it doesn't know but it's a little
[1:21:47] of Malachi that looks innocent but when
[1:21:49] it grows into the tree what is their
[1:21:51] black death look like it's ugly another
[1:21:57] example as cartoons and children's
[1:21:59] movies all right and I didn't even know
[1:22:02] what's out there these days but Satan
[1:22:04] only has to plant a seed through that
[1:22:05] now you look at a kid it's funny how you
[1:22:09] can give a kid this tablet and he'll
[1:22:12] take that and you'll like it a mini bus
[1:22:15] and you can go away and do something you
[1:22:19] come back and they'll be like this and
[1:22:20] then you can come back 24 hours later
[1:22:22] it'll be like this because that's just a
[1:22:25] direct channel from from hell straight
[1:22:28] into your child's eyes so you've got to
[1:22:31] be so careful what's coming through that
[1:22:33] channel has like back when I was a bit
[1:22:36] younger a long time ago and we had
[1:22:39] things called SpongeBob and SquarePants
[1:22:42] seemed like such a little innocent
[1:22:44] little cartoon I never even considered
[1:22:46] it now when I go back and look at it I
[1:22:49] see that through that whole movie was
[1:22:51] Masonic symbolism everywhere just
[1:22:53] preparing people for all this horrible
[1:22:56] evil that's only come on the earth when
[1:22:58] the bride leaves and they just really
[1:22:59] accept it because it's already being
[1:23:02] programmed into them when the little of
[1:23:05] Malachi grows up
[1:23:07] this is why it's so important not to
[1:23:10] forget where we're at and not get
[1:23:13] amnesia the seriousness of the day and
[1:23:19] then you look at these video games when
[1:23:23] they first started out and they're a
[1:23:25] Tetris block game blocks go together you
[1:23:29] know so innocent just a little little it
[1:23:32] was such a cute little baby you know and
[1:23:34] then it went into snakes and ladders and
[1:23:36] we should have started to get a bit
[1:23:38] worried when a snake came on the game we
[1:23:40] didn't and then it turned into Sonic the
[1:23:42] Hedgehog you know and I was just
[1:23:44] progressing a little bit is still quite
[1:23:46] innocent but then it starts turning into
[1:23:48] this they're going ugly monster right it
[1:23:52] starts turning into these first-person
[1:23:55] shooter games where now the person has
[1:23:58] the gun and you're playing remember this
[1:24:01] the screen that's captivated their
[1:24:03] attention now you've got the gun and
[1:24:05] you're going around Oh something has
[1:24:12] transitioned and this Amalekites
[1:24:14] starting to grow up a little bit and
[1:24:16] it's starting to look real ugly now I
[1:24:18] would hate to know where games are now
[1:24:20] but when I left the world there was a
[1:24:22] game called Grand Theft Auto and it was
[1:24:25] such a horrible game that it would send
[1:24:27] you out on a mission and the city in Los
[1:24:29] Angeles and it would tell you to go and
[1:24:32] do the most greatest violent crime
[1:24:34] against a woman and that's accepted by
[1:24:37] the world that's okay what are that
[1:24:40] what's been injected what are the but it
[1:24:43] just started off as just a little
[1:24:44] Amalekite just a little seed so cute so
[1:24:48] innocent could it grow up so I know I'm
[1:24:53] running out of time and I just want to
[1:24:55] give one more one more example because
[1:24:58] it's won this one the Lord's laid on my
[1:25:01] heart for years and I've never really
[1:25:03] shared so when I was growing up we lived
[1:25:08] out in the country a mum and dad
[1:25:10] wouldn't let us sudden sight and play
[1:25:12] computer games we did have a PlayStation
[1:25:14] but we very rarely played it on a rainy
[1:25:17] day and we certainly weren't allowed to
[1:25:18] play what
[1:25:19] we see played today but we had this
[1:25:24] natural human instinct in us and that's
[1:25:26] his brother giant Brian Jones says our
[1:25:30] eyes are in our front and means were a
[1:25:31] predator we're a hunter we don't have
[1:25:33] eyes on the side of our head
[1:25:35] we're not a bunny hugger we eat meat so
[1:25:38] this natural instinct and me as a child
[1:25:41] with this hunting instinct and so we
[1:25:45] would go around and we would see what
[1:25:46] we've ins we can make to go and hunt the
[1:25:48] birds and hunt the rabbits we'd go and
[1:25:51] cut down the neighbors gum tree and take
[1:25:53] a stick out at the top of it and leave
[1:25:54] the tree lying on the ground and make
[1:25:57] our bow and arrow and mum and dad taught
[1:25:59] us to respect those weapons are
[1:26:01] dangerous you've got to be careful as we
[1:26:04] got older you know I think maybe seven
[1:26:06] dad bought us a slug gun and now we
[1:26:10] start a target shooting and he would see
[1:26:12] that targets and we'd line these targets
[1:26:14] up shoot the target says great fun but
[1:26:17] dad taught us that you should never
[1:26:19] point a gun at each at anybody whether
[1:26:22] it's a toy
[1:26:23] whether it's loaded unloaded you don't
[1:26:25] point a gun at someone that's dangerous
[1:26:27] so we had other toys in the house like
[1:26:29] those little spring-loaded things that
[1:26:32] shoots a little sucky dart and Adam we'd
[1:26:35] go and we'd shoot targets in the house
[1:26:37] and shoot sometimes light bulbs became
[1:26:40] targets but there drummed it into us if
[1:26:44] I shot it at my sister you'd never point
[1:26:49] a gun at someone it's dangerous it's a
[1:26:51] weapon and never point a gun at someone
[1:26:54] so as I grew up we had this respect for
[1:26:57] firearms and we got bigger firearms on
[1:26:59] the farm I think when I was 10 I got a
[1:27:00] 22 and dad would let me go out on I
[1:27:03] shouldn't say that I used to sneak the
[1:27:07] 22 out of the gun safe and go and shoot
[1:27:09] rabbits on the farm and but we had
[1:27:13] respect but you see now how perverted
[1:27:16] the world has come that Satan wants to
[1:27:18] plant seeds and the children with
[1:27:22] weapons
[1:27:22] what's the seed what comes what's what
[1:27:26] does the tree grow into now you go into
[1:27:29] the warehouse and they've got all the
[1:27:31] rows of games and the
[1:27:33] rose got some games and you get to this
[1:27:35] row and on this side it's completely
[1:27:38] filled with gang games and this side
[1:27:40] it's completely filled with it's like
[1:27:41] the biggest toy oil in the shop and the
[1:27:45] kids are all fighting each other and
[1:27:46] it's so innocent as really is innocent
[1:27:48] but it's just it's planting a little of
[1:27:51] malachite and that seed has to grow up
[1:27:54] into a tree
[1:27:55] we have to be so careful what we
[1:27:58] entertain in our life because you're
[1:28:01] sowing into the child's life when it's
[1:28:03] young and it's just like that lovely
[1:28:05] malachite seed you have to consider what
[1:28:07] it's going to grow into but because of
[1:28:10] any Jie when we get so blase as to say
[1:28:16] about what's going on and we forget the
[1:28:18] seriousness of the hour that that we're
[1:28:21] living in kids have got a plate but we
[1:28:23] can choose what we sow into their life
[1:28:25] because now we're living in an age where
[1:28:28] we see mass murders everywhere
[1:28:30] kids are walking into school with a
[1:28:31] machine yeah bubble bubble churches
[1:28:33] getting blown up because the kids have
[1:28:35] just had it drummed into them
[1:28:36] first-person shooter games shooting in
[1:28:39] the house of shooting each other
[1:28:41] it's just Satan is just perverting he's
[1:28:44] just prover ting we've got to be so
[1:28:47] careful what we entertain don't get
[1:28:51] amnesia in the state come back to the
[1:28:53] word take a reality check
[1:28:56] amen take a reality check in here
[1:28:58] because everything we do right now and
[1:29:01] this time should be according to this
[1:29:03] because what's the other option you
[1:29:06] either love for God or or you're going
[1:29:07] to be partaker of the place and I don't
[1:29:10] want to be a partaker of those breaks
[1:29:12] lord help us so if you can't do
[1:29:15] something in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:29:17] then don't do it
[1:29:18] I just want to finish with a quote
[1:29:23] spiritual amnesia how can you be a
[1:29:27] Christian and deny the word you can't do
[1:29:30] it God is the word if the word is in you
[1:29:34] you and the word are the same all the
[1:29:37] word is you are amen what part of of
[1:29:43] what we've just been talking about as
[1:29:45] part of
[1:29:46] word all the word is you are or should
[1:29:49] be Amen if I'm living in this generation
[1:29:52] what this portion of the word has
[1:29:54] promised for this generation I've got to
[1:29:57] be that if I'm going to be a Christian
[1:30:00] I've got to be identified with all that
[1:30:02] the Bible preachers and stands for
[1:30:05] hallelujah gonna call me a Holy Roller
[1:30:08] anyhow I feel pretty religious right now
[1:30:10] yes sir amen I've got to be identified
[1:30:15] with everything that the Bible claims
[1:30:16] and give it claims and if I haven't been
[1:30:19] stricken with this modern-day spiritual
[1:30:21] amnesia I will be and can be identified
[1:30:25] with us and then I just pray I pray
[1:30:29] sincerely that you can be identified
[1:30:31] with this and you can consider the hour
[1:30:34] that we love them
[1:30:35] consider the seriousness of what's
[1:30:37] taking place because the world doesn't
[1:30:40] see what you see even even the churches
[1:30:43] that really sincerely worship God they
[1:30:46] don't see what you see they're lucky if
[1:30:49] they've even been invited to the wedding
[1:30:51] let alone still wearing a veil you're a
[1:30:54] lucky you're a blessed chosen people
[1:30:56] let's make the most of what God has
[1:30:58] given to us I mean let's just stand and
