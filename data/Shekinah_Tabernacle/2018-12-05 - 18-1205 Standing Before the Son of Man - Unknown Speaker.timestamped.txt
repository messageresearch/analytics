[32:02] and he showed me a pure river of water
[32:05] of life career clear as crystal
[32:07] proceeding out of the throne of God and
[32:09] of the Lamb and the myths of the street
[32:12] of it on either side of the river were
[32:14] was there the Tree of Life which bare
[32:16] twelve manner of fruits and yielded her
[32:18] fruit every month and the leaves of the
[32:21] tree were for the healing of the nations
[32:23] and there shall be no more curse but the
[32:26] throne of God and of the Lamb shall be
[32:28] in it and his servants shall serve him
[32:30] and they shall see his face and his name
[32:34] shall be in their foreheads and there
[32:37] shall be no night there and they need no
[32:39] candle neither light of the Sun for the
[32:42] Lord God giveth them light and they
[32:44] shall reign forever and ever I mean

[33:56] it as well look be their portion too in
[33:59] Jesus Christ name Lord I ask
[34:00] amen I mean God bless you all you may
[34:03] have your seats tonight I know
[34:09] I want to take a subject and basically
[34:14] everyone you feel very insufficient but
[34:15] this one I want to speak about when we
[34:18] stand before the Son of Man
[34:20] you know this life is we you know we
[34:24] understand in the scripture that it sees
[34:25] but this life is but a vapor you know we
[34:28] are not really living for the now you
[34:30] know there's one inevitable thing of
[34:33] everyone here in this room should time
[34:35] would tarry is that we all die
[34:37] you know should time go on we'll all die
[34:40] we'll all have a funeral service someone
[34:43] who'll carry our casket in and people
[34:45] will say some words and then they'll
[34:46] either you'll be cremated or put in the
[34:49] ground or you'll become a memory on this
[34:51] earth that's inevitable you know we
[34:53] can't man's trying to ultimately that
[34:56] want to merge themselves with machines
[34:58] and become immortal they'll say but I
[35:00] don't believe they'll be able to do it
[35:01] but there will come a time where if time
[35:04] should go on that we'll all be dead I
[35:06] know it wasn't expecting a hallelujah
[35:09] from that statement but you know they'll
[35:11] come a time where your last breath will
[35:14] be breathed your heart will stop you'll
[35:16] go somewhere and I just want to just
[35:19] think about you know if we could just
[35:20] you know we get so caught up sometimes
[35:23] in our situation of life and the things
[35:25] we may be struggling with and the things
[35:27] and even our own flesh wars against us
[35:30] you know how an emotion our own desires
[35:33] our own this body you know our
[35:35] temperament that we inherited from our
[35:37] family and that we weren't we would
[35:39] never have picked even our own selves
[35:41] and we some sometimes find it hard to
[35:43] look in the mirror at the person we are
[35:46] and you know who's had days like that we
[35:48] all have these battles you know and and
[35:50] where the maybe the next bill payment
[35:54] will come for all you know you're this
[35:55] you're there and this pressure and the
[35:56] family this pressure at school is
[35:58] pressure at your job there's pressure
[36:00] and the nation pressure in the world
[36:02] there's these struggles but if we could
[36:05] just look past those I mean if we could
[36:07] just really just look past everyday life
[36:11] and maybe next week and next month and
[36:13] Christmas and New Year and you know and
[36:15] look beyond to really we're we're going
[36:18] to end up we need to look beyond these
[36:21] five senses
[36:22] amen to really look you know because
[36:25] when we read that one day we'll stand
[36:27] before the Son of Man you know I trust
[36:29] that it's everyone's hearts desires that
[36:32] when you get to stand before him that
[36:34] day he will say these words to you he'll
[36:36] say well done my good and faithful
[36:38] servant enter into the joys of the Lord
[36:41] hallelujah and he'll bid gee I don't
[36:44] know how it'll be exactly but our name
[36:46] will be called the redeemed will be
[36:48] gathered round the throne and your name
[36:49] will be called and you'll stand before
[36:51] the Son of Man and he will have a crown
[36:53] to place on your head and he'll say well
[36:56] done and you know how sometimes witness
[36:58] people you really look up to in life and
[37:00] you do something for them and and theirs
[37:02] and they thank you for it out of the
[37:04] bottom and they say thank you for doing
[37:05] that for me I so appreciate you doing
[37:07] that for me but in your heart you you
[37:09] just think it was nothing I mean because
[37:11] you love and appreciate them you know
[37:13] maybe it could have been a very hard
[37:15] task and maybe taking a very long time
[37:17] but when you hear that gratitude from
[37:19] them and your heart you just swell up
[37:21] with pride and you say you know you
[37:23] maybe just said thank you but in
[37:24] yourself you just say it was nothing it
[37:26] was a joy hallelujah to to do that for
[37:30] you and you know not that we're looking
[37:32] for rewards you understand that you know
[37:34] we don't serve God out of trying to earn
[37:37] our salvation or earn the rapture it's
[37:39] given by the grace of God without money
[37:41] or price we just have to receive for
[37:43] salvation we just got to accept him
[37:45] accept this word that's all we need to
[37:48] do hallelujah remember when you when we
[37:51] cuz we will stand there one day we will
[37:53] stand there just like you're sitting
[37:55] here now you will stand there and then
[37:57] you will stand before him you will see
[37:59] him face to face I mean just like we're
[38:02] here today and that world is more real
[38:04] than this world at first life is but a
[38:06] vapor who seen some vapor who seen some
[38:10] smoke and you watch it and it was-- and
[38:12] then where does it go and he can t
[38:15] remember really what it did amen who's
[38:19] on a real hot day you take a real cold
[38:21] drinking you just breathe it out and
[38:22] just all kind of where did that go
[38:26] that's how our life is it comes it goes
[38:29] is gone and where are we but there will
[38:33] come a time which had this life is very
[38:35] temporal
[38:37] but there will come a time where we will
[38:40] stand before him and that'll be a great
[38:44] moment and I trust even if you're not
[38:47] now by the end of the service something
[38:49] and you will settle in your heart and
[38:51] you'll say Lord I want to stand there
[38:53] see you face to face I want to hear
[38:56] those words not that I will receive
[38:58] anything I don't care about no crown as
[39:01] as brother Burnham he would tell the
[39:03] story of a man called Oh
[39:05] hallelujah I love was dying
[39:08] and I thought he'd died they'd gathered
[39:10] round his deathbed and they thought he
[39:12] died he came back and they're all
[39:13] startled and and they said where'd
[39:16] you go he says well I was there and I
[39:19] was an angel and you know invited me
[39:21] through a you know through the gate I
[39:24] went through the gate and and and then
[39:26] an angel you know they said here's your
[39:28] here's your crown here's your robe but
[39:31] he says I don't care about no crown no
[39:32] robe and they and they asked well what
[39:35] kind of a reward do you want he says I
[39:36] just want to stand there and look at him
[39:38] for a thousand years and I trust that as
[39:42] as as brother bran would say you know I
[39:45] trust that's the attitude of every
[39:46] Christian we just want to get a look at
[39:49] him just to see the one who redeemed us
[39:51] see the one who purchased our salvation
[39:53] seen the one when he took your sin
[39:56] hallelujah he took your sin but that you
[39:59] could not place his Oh God I'll pay it
[40:01] for them hallelujah I'll carry their
[40:04] grief Oh Oh I'll carry their wounds
[40:07] they're playing their hurt
[40:08] hallelujah I'll put on human flesh that
[40:10] I'll understand what it's like to be a
[40:12] child I'll understand what it's like to
[40:14] be a teenager I'll stab what it's like
[40:16] to be an adult
[40:17] oh oh so all understand what it's like
[40:20] to be rejected and despised and used and
[40:22] evil spoken of and ridiculed hallelujah
[40:26] I will I will do that
[40:28] you know it's amazing experiences do not
[40:31] leave you they meant you think of some
[40:35] great traumatic experience it's still
[40:37] very part of you and you can just think
[40:39] it for a second and your heart maybe
[40:41] begins to pound the same feelings that
[40:43] rush through your body come back because
[40:45] it's a part of you you can't get rid of
[40:48] it for nothing you know our Lord
[40:50] Jesus will carry those words hallelujah
[40:53] he weren't just when he came out of the
[40:55] grave
[40:56] there was no delete button just pushed
[40:57] and he forgot the suffering he knew what
[41:00] it was like he carries that hallelujah
[41:03] he's the high priest can be touched by
[41:04] the feeling of our infirmities brother
[41:07] Branham would he would there was someone
[41:09] who came forward for prayer and I don't
[41:12] know what they were what was wrong with
[41:14] them but he was praying for them and he
[41:15] says Lord you understand holy and the
[41:18] person was healed hallelujah our God
[41:21] isn't a robot our God isn't some distant
[41:24] thing who doesn't care about you he
[41:26] cares a lot about you he cares more
[41:28] about you than anyone in this earth ever
[41:31] will care for you even even your spouse
[41:34] your soulmate
[41:35] he cares way more no one there's no one
[41:37] who cares for you like Jesus cares for
[41:39] you hallelujah I'm so glad that's true
[41:44] amen and those that are sealed we read
[41:49] their they shall see his face and his
[41:52] name shall be in their foreheads glory
[41:56] to God I trust this means something to
[41:58] you
[41:59] now this brother Branham would speak
[42:02] about going beyond the curtain of time
[42:06] you know I scribbled this out but my
[42:08] writing scary so I just I just copied it
[42:11] quickly but he says now he speaks about
[42:14] this is from the rejected King in and
[42:17] this is just the first service where he
[42:18] speaks about about going me on the
[42:20] curtain of time I trust when you hear it
[42:22] it means something to you remember we're
[42:25] all going to die if time should tarry
[42:27] the Lord made a door open that we don't
[42:30] have to go to be lost
[42:31] mmm buddy he made a door that we can go
[42:34] off and be saved
[42:35] holy that we can go to you know heaven
[42:37] is far greater than the greatest
[42:38] greatest thing you can imagine it's
[42:41] greater than the best camp experience as
[42:43] the it's greater than the best service
[42:45] you've ever been and it's far greater
[42:47] nothing can compare to being there even
[42:50] for a moment how great it is hallelujah
[42:54] where where he said now he said and God
[42:58] let me press the battle but if it comes
[43:01] to dying
[43:02] I am no
[43:03] mom or that would be a joy it would be a
[43:06] pleasure to enter from this corruption
[43:09] and disgrace
[43:10] he says if I could make up yonder 1
[43:14] billion miles high a square block and
[43:17] that's perfect love so you see as a
[43:19] billion miles high there's a square
[43:20] block of perfect love and every time
[43:23] each step this way it narrows so it gets
[43:26] from a block of square block approval up
[43:28] every time you come this way narrows
[43:30] narrows gets less and less right each
[43:33] step at Darrow's until you get down to
[43:35] where we are now it would be merely a
[43:38] shadow of corruption that little
[43:42] something we can sense and feel that
[43:44] there is something somewhere he says he
[43:47] says that's how great it is you know cuz
[43:50] if you think about just a square block
[43:51] of perfect love a billion miles away and
[43:53] every time you come closer gets less and
[43:55] less and less and less until it comes to
[43:57] you and we have glorious times you know
[44:00] when it comes to you Allu yeah and it
[44:03] just feels like nothing matters and he's
[44:05] the greatest thing in the world and as
[44:07] love just fills your soul and you don't
[44:09] want to leave those places you just say
[44:11] Lordan but can I just remained like this
[44:13] forever and ever and ever and ever
[44:15] that's merely a shadow he says of
[44:19] corruption he's just a just merely a
[44:21] show so it's a nothing compared to their
[44:24] that little something we can sense and
[44:26] feel that there is something somewhere
[44:29] we don't know what it is he says oh my
[44:32] precious friends my beloved darlings of
[44:34] the gospel my begotten children under
[44:36] God listen to me your pastor you I wish
[44:39] there was some way I could explain it to
[44:41] you there's no words I couldn't find it
[44:43] it's not found anywhere but just beyond
[44:47] this last breath is the most glorious
[44:49] thing that you ever there's no way to
[44:52] explain it there's no way you just can't
[44:55] do it I just can't do it but whatever
[44:58] you do friend lay aside everything else
[45:00] till you get perfect love get to a spot
[45:04] where you can love everybody every enemy
[45:08] everything else you mean when you first
[45:11] met him everything was wonderful nothing
[45:15] mattered remember that moment
[45:17] remember that time the trees looked
[45:19] greener the sky looked more wonderful
[45:22] you know you know you see a sunset
[45:25] that's like Lord you just painted that
[45:26] just for me
[45:27] whose if you know what I'm talking about
[45:29] the world is just greater even you know
[45:32] everyone around you is just nicer
[45:35] hallelujah
[45:36] that's not psychology that's not emotion
[45:40] that's God doing that when you look at
[45:43] the world and the world seems different
[45:45] but it's the same Amen you know what I'm
[45:47] talking I trust you know what I'm
[45:48] talking about
[45:50] Alleluia it is lay aside everything
[45:53] until you get perfect life perfect
[45:54] lovers the Holy Ghost oh yeah this is
[45:58] only perfect love will enter into that
[46:00] place now let's just imagine if I may
[46:03] maybe this I would you see but we're in
[46:08] the rapture
[46:08] well we are in the rapture but the dead
[46:10] in Christ are here you see the Apostle
[46:13] Paul when they're being credible you see
[46:15] Irene Eason Polycarp of Martin and you
[46:18] see Mary and Martha and Elizabeth and
[46:20] all the different ones through the
[46:21] scripture great heroes of faith you see
[46:23] your white cliff who translated the
[46:26] Bible into English and you know Tyndale
[46:28] and all these great heroes of faith
[46:29] maybe people you admired you see brother
[46:32] Burnham and different ones who've gone
[46:33] on before wouldn't that be incredible to
[46:36] see them but then we caught up there's a
[46:39] deep calling to the deep I pray this
[46:41] goes beyond just a service is a deep
[46:44] calling to the deep I trust you have it
[46:46] and you something and you says I'm not I
[46:48] don't I don't belong in this world I
[46:50] don't belong in this world I have to
[46:53] live here I've got to exist and you know
[46:55] I want to whatever but ultimately I
[46:58] don't belong here I belong in another
[47:00] place and there's a longing there's a
[47:03] deep calling to the deep and that's like
[47:05] a you know as as it says in Jeremiah
[47:08] let's go to Jeremiah 33 and 11 shall we
[47:13] you know this Bible's our love leader
[47:17] Amen I trust it's a love letter to you
[47:22] you say that's just emotion anything
[47:25] without emotion brother Brahim sees his
[47:26] deed I believe in half out religion
[47:30] hallelujah cuz heartfelt religion will
[47:32] see you through it'll hold you you won't
[47:34] hold it
[47:35] hallelujah Jeremiah 33 11 you ever see
[47:41] brother Branham and the deep thought the
[47:44] deep he prays his Lord when he get to
[47:47] the end of the way and the arms are all
[47:48] stacked and we get up to your house and
[47:50] he you know finishes his prayer and he
[47:52] wipes his eyes his sorry I'm crying like
[47:55] a baby but there's something when I just
[47:56] talk about him right he was a man's man
[47:59] right but he wasn't a statue he had
[48:03] heartfelt religion but he was a man's
[48:05] man brother Perry Greene gave a
[48:07] testimony when they were in hunting yeah
[48:08] your brother Graham said the first
[48:10] person to brush your teeth is a
[48:12] you know you know so he was a man you
[48:16] know he was a man's man but he had a
[48:18] heart right he wasn't just some you know
[48:20] and you see him there are thousands of
[48:23] people say sorry
[48:24] you know that's crying when he's talking
[48:26] to him because there's just something
[48:28] about him when he draws close amen
[48:30] Jeremiah 33 and 11 it is the voice of
[48:34] joy the voice of gladness the voice of
[48:39] the bridegroom and the voice of the
[48:41] bride the voice of them that shall say
[48:44] praise the Lord of Hosts for the Lord is
[48:47] good and His mercy endureth for ever and
[48:49] of them that shall bring the sacrifice
[48:51] of praising to the house of the Lord for
[48:54] our will cause to return the captivity
[48:56] of the land as at the first saith the
[48:59] Lord hallelujah so he's saying that this
[49:05] is how it's going to be it's going to be
[49:07] the voice of joy now this is talking
[49:09] about you he's not just chunk Jeremiah's
[49:11] not just talking about this thing but
[49:13] this is how as it was at the first it
[49:15] shall be now in the beginning they had
[49:17] their first love right before their feet
[49:20] before the church age started the you're
[49:23] the bride of the first age they had a
[49:25] first love hallelujah

[49:31] know what a first love really is
[49:33] amen he's wonderful doesn't matter if
[49:36] you have it all though you have nothing
[49:37] you've got him and that satisfies
[49:40] that lasts it means something halleluyah
[49:43] doesn't matter what people will look at
[49:45] the street that you like it doesn't
[49:46] matter i'm inverters now a lighter
[49:49] brighter is my day and is such a joy to
[49:51] walk with him i mean but there's the
[49:54] voice of gladness who's glad from a
[49:57] heart i mean the voice of the bridegroom
[49:59] we've heard the voice of the bridegroom
[50:01] this message is the voice of the
[50:02] bridegroom and the voice of the bride
[50:04] you've got to respond I mean this this
[50:07] message is a message of love divine love
[50:09] hallelujah
[50:10] that's what I experienced when I first
[50:12] heard it I wasn't in a church I just had
[50:14] the tapes in the Bible and all I heard
[50:16] was love I didn't hear law and rules and
[50:18] thou shalt I heard the vine love
[50:20] hallelujah give yourself to me the Lord
[50:22] said and I'll fill you and he did
[50:24] hallelujah and it's been glorious ever
[50:27] since I heard from another land I'm here
[50:29] I heard from where I'm going to I trust
[50:32] you've heard the same voice I mean when
[50:34] you've heard the voice of the eternity
[50:36] speak and there's something and you're
[50:38] responding saying yes their voice Buller
[50:40] I'm part of that voice as a brand of
[50:43] Bragg number one hallelujah I am the
[50:46] voice of God are one because we are the
[50:48] bride and he's the bridegroom they
[50:49] become one something does it mean
[50:52] something to you I mean there's a deep
[50:55] calling to the deep the voice of a bride
[50:57] was the voice of a bride and the
[50:59] bridegroom so honey I can't wait I don't
[51:03] want to be a part anymore hallelujah you
[51:06] understand it's a longing hello yeah
[51:10] Amen you say what is he I don't know I
[51:12] don't understand you meet him and you'll
[51:14] understand what I'm talking about
[51:17] Alleluia there's a deep calling to the
[51:19] deep brother bram spoke about beyond the
[51:23] curtain of time in the regions of the
[51:25] Blessed
[51:25] he says there's not a word to that would
[51:28] speak it friends perfect wouldn't even
[51:31] touch it that's how great it is he said
[51:34] everyone's young there's no sickness to
[51:36] Zee sorrow pain bad thoughts bad days
[51:40] everything's just perfect hallelujah
[51:43] everyone's young hallelujah
[51:45] he says sublime wouldn't even touch it
[51:48] that's how great it is I think if we
[51:52] could just look beyond the curtain a tie
[51:54] it would change a lot of things
[51:57] sometimes you know the devil wants to
[51:59] keep us earthbound
[52:00] he wants to keep her he wants us
[52:02] overcharged with the kids of life that's
[52:04] a sneer that's come upon the earth and
[52:06] we can't escape but if if Jesus says
[52:08] that would come upon the whole earth
[52:10] where do you live are you you and the
[52:13] earth yes I trust you are let's not come
[52:17] in Houston to whoever I hope you don't
[52:20] have a problem you know in space
[52:22] somewhere you're upon this earth right
[52:24] so this nice try and we'll try and
[52:26] stretch you and overcome you and you'll
[52:27] be over care overcome with the cares of
[52:29] life you know don't look at those things
[52:32] the devil wants to keep the earth bound
[52:33] God wants you in heaven Jesus wants you
[52:36] in heaven that's why this message is a
[52:38] rapture call hallelujah and so now we
[52:41] don't you know we're going to look
[52:43] beyond the curtain of time that's why
[52:45] you know when the Holy Spirit moves
[52:47] that's eternity reaching down that's
[52:50] heaven coming down into the room and
[52:52] guys try to tell you just beyond the
[52:54] river just through this rail I mean
[52:57] there's a world that is far more real
[52:58] than this world and God's trying to get
[53:00] your attention you belong in that world
[53:02] I've come to get you to this world
[53:04] hallelujah that you want to know and
[53:06] understand you don't belong here you're
[53:08] in destination is not the grave or the
[53:11] tribulation your end destination is
[53:13] heaven hallelujah that's why this
[53:16] message came and brother Brahim cities
[53:18] lying on the bed just for his translated
[53:20] beyond the curtain of time and heaven
[53:21] was actually just above the doorframe it
[53:25] wasn't far away sometimes we think is
[53:27] blump here but beyond Pluto someplace
[53:29] far away no it's just there
[53:31] it's just in a dimension moving faster
[53:33] than this dimension it's right there
[53:36] God's not far away God's not far away
[53:39] someplace someplace someplace someplace
[53:40] he's here heaven is here also colors
[53:44] here but heaven is here that's the main
[53:47] thing hallelujah yes and then he found
[53:50] himself before he realized he was there
[53:53] hallelujah why because the Holy Ghost
[53:56] was in him and it took him there and he
[53:59] is wondering what's going to happen when
[54:02] I die cuz he thought he'd just like
[54:03] whoops of smoke floating around he goes
[54:05] brother nibble he can't shake his hand
[54:07] or any
[54:07] he says the West was smart and her voice
[54:09] said to him Jonah see the past occurred
[54:11] in a time I believe this do you believe
[54:13] it
[54:13] I believe he was taken there and brother
[54:16] has he don't help me so much and before
[54:17] he knew it he was there and he put his
[54:20] hand on his head he had a full head of
[54:21] hair and he saw his body laying on the
[54:23] bed and then he sees everyone hello yeah
[54:27] amen and then and then it's a time for
[54:30] him to go back he says do I have to go
[54:31] back to that thing he said brother Bram
[54:35] says this world is a dump
[54:36] now I remember a dump you got a silver
[54:39] street dump that's not a dump
[54:41] that's clean when I was young
[54:44] this is in Gisborne that was a real dump
[54:46] it was just bulldozed everywhere and
[54:48] bulgar added just stunk and it was
[54:51] rancid horrible thing that was a dump I
[54:54] went there to this dump I thought this
[54:55] is not where's the dump I'm looking for
[54:57] the dump you know you go up this
[54:59] concrete and you know you drive up you
[55:02] just push your stuff over the side a
[55:03] front-end loader pushes it off it does
[55:05] whatever that wasn't Ginsburg dump that
[55:09] place didn't even stink I'm a where's
[55:11] the rubbish you know but a real dump it
[55:15] stinks there's rats there's diseased
[55:18] seagulls
[55:19] all manner of stuff maggots moving
[55:21] around the whole thing moves and you
[55:23] know and you taste it before you see it
[55:25] and see the smell it is that strong he
[55:28] says that's what this world is like and
[55:30] it can be polished up and it can be
[55:32] clean and the nicest clothes and we can
[55:34] think we're a million dollars and it's a
[55:36] dump you get a look at where's your
[55:39] priority you know so many people worry
[55:42] about the cares of the we need to worry
[55:44] about this life we need a job we need an
[55:47] education we need to live right but
[55:51] don't make it your all where your heart
[55:55] is that's where you where your heart is
[55:57] that's where your treasure shall be also
[55:59] are you investing in the bank of heaven
[56:01] this world is broke this world as
[56:04] brokers just digits as brother Isaac was
[56:06] saying and it's all going to fall over
[56:07] and they're predicting the United States
[56:10] is already going into recession because
[56:13] of some market thing I can't explain it
[56:14] I won't try but it's happened in the
[56:16] previous about six recessions with the
[56:21] amount of income you get from different
[56:23] bonds and things that basically goes
[56:25] from instead of a profit it kind of goes
[56:27] inverse and goes down some kind of I
[56:30] shouldn't see it anything anyway but
[56:32] it's happened in the last recessions and
[56:34] we're here and it's going down where is
[56:37] it going to go doesn't go up it's going
[56:39] to go down so where are your treasures
[56:42] I've got treasures in heaven I trust
[56:46] you've got treasure in heaven because at
[56:48] the end of the day this world is not
[56:51] going to be this world anymore
[56:53] there's going to be a holy fire come
[56:55] down and it's going to be renovated and
[56:57] the saints of God that are deemed are
[56:59] going to be here and a holy New
[57:01] Jerusalem and it's going to be more
[57:03] wonderful than you can even imagine
[57:06] hallelujah but the main thing as we get
[57:09] to see him that's the main thing brother
[57:14] Branham you know because you got to
[57:15] think about it really what do we what
[57:18] are we Christians for we're not
[57:20] Christians this so we can explain from
[57:22] Genesis to Revelation and and and from
[57:25] 1947 to 1965 and have it all together
[57:27] just right it's more than that it's
[57:30] actually not that it's the life of God
[57:32] the word becoming flesh in you that you
[57:35] know the author of the book that's the
[57:37] main thing you know the voice behind the
[57:39] voice amen that's the that is the main
[57:42] thing if you know him we're all going to
[57:44] step through a door right and some step
[57:47] through that door death a lot younger
[57:48] than others right but we're going to go
[57:50] through the door who's going to catch
[57:52] you when you go through the door that's
[57:54] the only thing that matters right
[57:56] brother brems 14 he shot he's losing
[58:00] blood in the hospital they don't have
[58:01] blood transfusions in those days he
[58:03] begins to drop he begins to fall and he
[58:05] and he said there's no mama there no
[58:07] daddy there no one to catch him he cries
[58:09] out there was no God there right came to
[58:13] that boy and all that and then he you
[58:16] know tried to bargain with God nee and
[58:17] he came back to life because he had a
[58:19] job to do upon the earth but at the end
[58:21] of the day what matters do we know her
[58:25] more do we not know him if you know him
[58:28] it'll pay off it'll pay off a lot and
[58:32] you wrote one regretted for a
[58:35] second hallelujah because you'll see him
[58:38] and there won't be a voice saying depart
[58:40] from me either work iniquity there'll be
[58:41] a voices well done my good and faithful
[58:44] servant he didn't say well done my good
[58:46] and successful servant well done my good
[58:49] and faithful what if we're cool to do
[58:51] let's be faithful to it I'm in John the
[58:54] Baptist he ended up in prison he thought
[58:57] you know his you know his eagle eyes
[58:59] filmed over he's wondering about the
[59:01] Christ year he sent his servants to you
[59:03] know his disciples to go ask Jesus and
[59:05] now the one or do we look for another
[59:06] and they came back with the report and
[59:09] he rested he said though he was the one
[59:12] he probably thought well as my life been
[59:15] worth it I've been however long from a
[59:19] young child to 30 or whatever in the
[59:22] wilderness eating locusts and wild honey
[59:23] preached for six months end up in this
[59:26] place but I guarantee you when the crown
[59:30] of life is put on that glorious head
[59:31] there'll be a voice saying well done my
[59:33] good and faithful servant hallelujah it
[59:38] depends we want to be good and faithful
[59:41] amen all Lord but we know it's him if we
[59:47] ever there to Tim in us that makes us
[59:49] good and faithful
[59:50] yeah we just yielded ourselves to him
[59:52] and he does it
[59:54] amen brother Bram tells the account of
[59:58] of brother Bosworth he's come down to
[1:00:03] the ends of his life and he's there by
[1:00:06] his deathbed and he asked brother
[1:00:08] Bosworth what is the what's the greatest
[1:00:13] time of your life he's a man that's
[1:00:16] dying I don't know how old he is maybe
[1:00:18] in his eighties he served God 60 odd
[1:00:20] years what's the greatest time of your
[1:00:22] life and brother Bosworth says right now
[1:00:25] because he's the one that I've lived for
[1:00:27] it's going to walk through that door
[1:00:30] and I'm going to go with him hallelujah
[1:00:33] and that's what happened and that should
[1:00:37] be the thing on our hearts more than
[1:00:39] anything that whenever it happens the
[1:00:42] one that we have looked for the one who
[1:00:44] were felt as presents come and meet us
[1:00:48] and wash your our sins away and confirm
[1:00:50] to us you're mine and I've redeemed you
[1:00:53] I've bought you
[1:00:54] wholly more than a motion more than a
[1:00:57] nice idea more than just because mummy
[1:00:59] and daddy do it but because it became
[1:01:01] real hallelujah trusts come real to you
[1:01:04] you say well I've never felt anything
[1:01:06] take him at his word Thank You Medes
[1:01:09] word the devil lies to us and says it's
[1:01:11] not real it's just emotion no I felt a
[1:01:13] lot of emotion in my life but when he
[1:01:15] comes it's very different from just
[1:01:17] emotion I mean when he comes it's very
[1:01:19] different than just a feeling
[1:01:21] hallelujah it's very different it's a
[1:01:23] reality hallelujah he's a real being
[1:01:26] he's not just an idea this is not
[1:01:28] something that's just been crafted for
[1:01:29] 2,000 years to control people that's God
[1:01:32] come down reveal his word saying is
[1:01:35] there's not an end when you die it's
[1:01:37] just the beginning this life is but a
[1:01:39] vapor this life is like a dream you know
[1:01:41] how you had some crazy dream you work
[1:01:43] out well that was crazy right one day
[1:01:46] we'll wake up right one day we'll be an
[1:01:49] eternity and we'll think that was crazy
[1:01:52] Alleluia so he asked brother Bosworth
[1:01:58] yes do you realize where you're going
[1:02:01] he says yes but brother Branham all I
[1:02:04] love from the past 60 years has been for
[1:02:07] Christ and any minute he will come in
[1:02:10] that door to take me home and that
[1:02:16] should be the attitude that should be
[1:02:17] more than just in here because it sounds
[1:02:19] good it should something be in here
[1:02:21] saying any minute I could be this could
[1:02:24] be the last moment upon the earth but
[1:02:25] any minute now he's going to come
[1:02:27] through that door and take me home
[1:02:29] hallelujah that should be the attic
[1:02:33] attitude of every every Christian I
[1:02:35] think I mean let's go to you know we
[1:02:42] read I don't know if we read it but but
[1:02:43] revelations 21 and 4 it says he shall
[1:02:46] wipe all tears away from their eyes you
[1:02:50] know
[1:02:52] I don't know how it's gonna be but when
[1:02:55] we see him it's gonna be wonderful it's
[1:02:58] gonna be the greatest thing to stand
[1:02:59] before him hallelujah and it's gonna
[1:03:03] mean a lot it's gonna mean a lot I mean
[1:03:06] you think we're gonna be you know when I
[1:03:08] actually get really excited I get very
[1:03:09] quiet
[1:03:10] I don't shower I actually get very quiet
[1:03:13] and you know I don't know what how
[1:03:15] you're gonna be it doesn't really matter
[1:03:16] all different but there's gonna be
[1:03:18] something we see him as he is as I said
[1:03:21] to be wonderful to see all the other you
[1:03:22] know the dead in Christ race and see
[1:03:24] them but they will pale in comparison to
[1:03:27] when we see him hallelujah and it will
[1:03:30] be the most glorious moment of our lives
[1:03:33] and you'll say Lord thank you you
[1:03:35] allowed me to come to this place because
[1:03:37] it wasn't me that got me here it's you
[1:03:39] that got me here where I was saved by
[1:03:42] your grace and my walk is by your grace
[1:03:44] and the rapture is by grace as your
[1:03:47] divine influence upon my heart and its
[1:03:49] reflection in the life it's your doing
[1:03:51] this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous
[1:03:53] in our eyes hallelujah and that's why in
[1:03:56] reality we know no flesh will glory in
[1:03:58] his presence because we know that it's
[1:04:02] him that got us there where were we
[1:04:05] revelations 21 and 4 and God shall wipe
[1:04:08] away all tears from their eyes and there
[1:04:12] she be and there shall be no more death
[1:04:14] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:04:18] there be any more pain for the former
[1:04:20] things are passed away
[1:04:23] and he and he that said upon the throne
[1:04:25] said behold I make all things new and he
[1:04:28] said unto me write for these words are
[1:04:31] true and faithful and he said unto me it
[1:04:35] is done I'm looking forward to hearing
[1:04:37] that it is done I'm Alfred I make at the
[1:04:40] beginning in the end and I will give
[1:04:41] unto him that is athirst of the fountain
[1:04:43] of water of life freely
[1:04:45] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:04:47] things and I will be his God and he
[1:04:49] shall be my son hallelujah it'll be
[1:04:53] worth it it'll be worth it every try
[1:04:56] along the a long life's journey you know
[1:05:00] the Apostle Paul comes down to his last
[1:05:03] day upon the earth he's really written
[1:05:05] to timber
[1:05:06] the a crown of life lace for me on that
[1:05:10] other side and all them that lovers
[1:05:12] glorious appearing he comes down to the
[1:05:14] end of his life he spent a lot of time
[1:05:16] and in jail he's being beaten
[1:05:19] he's been stoned he's been shipwrecked
[1:05:22] he's been all kinds of things he was in
[1:05:25] such a place he writes to Timothy bring
[1:05:28] my other coat that's how cold he is in
[1:05:30] prison he doesn't have underfloor
[1:05:32] heating like the prisons we have in this
[1:05:33] country there's no underfloor heating
[1:05:35] there but he comes down and you just
[1:05:38] think about that if you could stand
[1:05:40] there and watch the beheading of the
[1:05:42] Apostle Paul you probably are you'll
[1:05:45] probably ask him what's the greatest
[1:05:46] moment of your life right now because
[1:05:49] I'm going to put my neck down here and
[1:05:51] extra swords gonna fall and I'm going to
[1:05:52] be with him and this is the moment I've
[1:05:55] been looking for I was carried up to the
[1:05:56] third heaven it was glorious I had
[1:05:58] visitations of his presence it was
[1:06:00] glorious but now it's gonna be permanent
