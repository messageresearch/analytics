[44:38] the sons of men
[44:40] as is now revealed unto his holy
[44:42] prophets and apostles by the spirit the
[44:45] gentiles should be fellow heirs of the
[44:47] same body and partakers of his promise
[44:49] in christ by the gospel whereby i was
[44:53] made a minister according to the gift of
[44:54] the grace of god given unto me by the
[44:56] effectual working of his power unto me
[44:59] whom less than least of all saints is
[45:01] this grace given that i should preach
[45:03] among the gentiles the unsearchable
[45:05] riches of christ and to make all men see
[45:08] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[45:10] which from the beginning of the world
[45:12] hath been hidden god who created all
[45:13] things by jesus christ to the intent
[45:16] that now unto the principalities and
[45:19] powers in heavenly places might be known
[45:22] by the church the manifold wisdom of god
[45:25] according to the eternal purpose which
[45:27] he purposed in christ jesus our lord in
[45:29] whom we have boldness and access with
[45:31] confidence by faith by the faith of him

[47:22] worship you together in spirit and in
[47:24] truth we praise your great name lord be
[47:26] with all those who are not here as well
[47:28] today lord we're the second body or
[47:29] traveling or wherever they may be o god
[47:31] be their portion for your glory in jesus
[47:34] christ's name amen
[47:36] amen god bless you friends you can have
[47:37] your seats uh this morning i want to
[47:40] continue on uh with that thought uh my
[47:43] thought of um
[47:44] speaking about head chip that was a
[47:46] couple of sundays uh uh wednesdays ago
[47:48] um
[47:49] i think it's weird it's been over a
[47:50] month since i've stood here on a sunday
[47:52] but here we are
[47:54] anyway so i want to talk about so
[47:57] the headship you're under is what's been
[47:59] revealed to you
[48:00] where uh
[48:02] where we must recognize the supreme
[48:05] deity of jesus christ
[48:07] it's absolutely essential that we
[48:08] realize he's not just a second person or
[48:11] a person of the godhead but the fullness
[48:13] of god he bodily dwelled in him that he
[48:15] was god made flesh right so he wasn't
[48:18] just a god he wasn't just a prophet or a
[48:20] holy man or something like that but he
[48:22] was the god the almighty king of glory
[48:24] made flesh and dwelt among us and it's
[48:27] very important because if we realize the
[48:29] hatred we're under then we can realize
[48:31] the authority that's been given in that
[48:32] headship where um
[48:35] because as we read here in ephesians
[48:37] we'll go into it later that there's the
[48:39] apostle paul was saying there's a time
[48:41] now where the principalities and powers
[48:43] in heavenly places might be made known
[48:45] to the church or by the church and
[48:47] another translation says it'll be
[48:49] through the assembly so it's not just
[48:51] something that would be head knowledge
[48:52] or something that's a nice idea that's
[48:54] theory but it would be a reality of all
[48:57] the powers and principalities and
[48:58] heavenly places will be made would be
[49:00] made known through you oh god you know
[49:03] whether it be healing or or salvation
[49:05] you know deliverance or prophecy or
[49:07] whatever it may be all the powers that
[49:09] are in heaven we may would be made known
[49:11] through your life
[49:12] now we read here in in in revelations 3
[49:16] you know some people think you know
[49:17] what's the point of reading about a
[49:18] former church age now
[49:20] we know that a church age is a span of
[49:22] time in history right we know we're
[49:23] living in the seventh church age because
[49:25] the seventh church age you know when
[49:27] when the lord describes that age you say
[49:29] you're rich increase with goods have
[49:31] need of nothing and we know that this is
[49:32] this time i mean there's never been a
[49:34] time when the whole world has been rich
[49:36] and increased with goods you know even
[49:38] when this is years ago now in papua new
[49:40] guinea the first church however went to
[49:42] a pentecostal church and and there was a
[49:44] sunday school lesson before the service
[49:46] and and and the brother was preaching
[49:48] about revelations three saying look
[49:50] we're rich and increased with goods
[49:51] and in our mind you say no you're a
[49:53] developing world you're very poor but in
[49:55] there you know from what where they have
[49:57] been to where they are now they're very
[49:58] rich increase with goods i mean so the
[50:00] whole world has come into this condition
[50:02] so it's not hard for us to realize we
[50:05] are living in the ladies and church age
[50:07] now but the thing is that with god
[50:09] there's not an abrupt start and a stop
[50:11] there's an overlap from one age into the
[50:13] other age just like you know we can see
[50:16] this where when when when when salvation
[50:18] came to the jews here in the upper room
[50:20] it was all jewish believers but it was
[50:22] prophesied that god would take a gentile
[50:24] people for his namesake so what started
[50:27] happening is then then you come to acts
[50:29] chapter 10 and cornelius who was a
[50:31] gentile in this house with gentiles they
[50:33] came in and they received the same holy
[50:35] ghost that they did in the upper room
[50:36] and peter they said thereafter they
[50:38] received the holy ghost said can we
[50:40] forbid water saying they have received
[50:41] it like we did exactly in the upper room
[50:43] so now the gentiles started to come in
[50:46] and then and then god called the apostle
[50:48] paul and then and then he always went to
[50:50] the synagogues and he preached you know
[50:52] jesus christ being the messiah according
[50:54] to the scripture but then there was a
[50:56] blindness coming upon them so there came
[50:58] a time where we're sure jew and gentile
[51:00] were coming in but there was an overlap
[51:02] where the jews were being blinded and
[51:03] the gentile eyes were coming open and
[51:05] then finally he said see you find
[51:07] yourselves i'm worthy of eternal life
[51:09] low we turn to the gentiles
[51:10] so so then so sure there's been jews
[51:13] through this
[51:14] a few number through history that have
[51:15] received christ but as a nation as a
[51:18] great body of people they've been
[51:19] blinded but they have three and a half
[51:21] years of salvation amen when we go to
[51:24] the wedding supper in the sky that's
[51:25] when the two prophets come down and
[51:27] preach jesus christ to them the same god
[51:29] we know they will receive right but but
[51:31] there's an overlap time
[51:33] and it's the same thing even now you
[51:34] know that you know there's an awakening
[51:36] going on in israel because there's a
[51:38] blinding of the gentiles but an
[51:39] awakening of the jews
[51:41] amen so we're living in that time so
[51:43] don't let your eyes be blinded
[51:45] amen but may your eyes be open amen may
[51:47] our lands be burning trim and clear amen
[51:49] full of the holy ghost so there's an
[51:51] overlap always between one age and
[51:53] another now this where we read in
[51:55] revelations 3 saying i've set before
[51:58] then open door
[51:59] and and no man can shut it now this was
[52:02] a this was an open door where where
[52:04] where if we we won't look at it today
[52:06] but you look at the philadelphian age
[52:08] where where there was a methodist
[52:10] movement but then it grew into
[52:11] other movements and then and then and
[52:13] then just at the end of that age the the
[52:16] baptism in the name of jesus christ came
[52:18] back into manifestation where people
[52:20] were restored back to true water baptism
[52:22] in the name of jesus christ and
[52:24] and and and the truth of the supreme
[52:26] deity of jesus christ was being restored
[52:28] to the church so that was the open door
[52:31] that god had opened
[52:33] and no man could shut it
[52:35] amen so so
[52:37] going from that agent to this age
[52:38] there's a door open of revelation that
[52:40] would pour his strength into the church
[52:43] amen amen amen he says here he says
[52:47] brother brahm says here now he says an
[52:49] uh uh open door what was it it was the
[52:51] revelation of the supreme deity supreme
[52:54] deity of jesus christ not being a second
[52:56] person of a trinity but being god
[52:58] himself made flesh and dwelling among us
[53:00] he says and i noticed thou has a little
[53:02] strength and have not denied my name now
[53:05] the first time the name has been spoke
[53:06] of since one of the early ages you know
[53:09] because during the dark ages they lost
[53:11] his name
[53:12] and luther came out with a name and he
[53:13] was alive and was dead that's right was
[53:15] that father son and holy ghost but here
[53:17] comes out the name of jesus again and
[53:19] between these two ages here in between
[53:21] it's an open door it's a revelation that
[53:23] he was the deity the revelations of his
[53:26] deity
[53:27] amen so
[53:29] this is very powerful because we must
[53:31] realize and i'm sure i'm probably
[53:32] preaching to the choir but we're going
[53:34] to realize our god is supreme
[53:36] he is not just a god he's not just part
[53:38] of the godhead he's all that god was was
[53:40] poured into christ and all that christ
[53:42] was is poured into the church right so
[53:44] jesus christ is the name above all names
[53:47] i mean we do not have some headship
[53:49] that's got to negotiate with the enemy
[53:51] to try and get things done he's the
[53:53] supreme god amen no one's gonna ask him
[53:55] anything when he wants to do something
[53:57] he doesn't right he doesn't have to ask
[53:58] permission he just does what he wants to
[54:00] do because he's supreme i mean so we
[54:03] must realize that he's a supreme one
[54:05] because if we realize if our headship is
[54:07] supreme then nothing can stop us ain't
[54:10] because nothing could stop him
[54:12] the only thing that can stop us is
[54:13] yourself
[54:14] amen the devil's been defeated but now
[54:17] you've got to get yourself whooped out
[54:19] amen amen so i trust it's been revealed
[54:22] to you that it was actually it wasn't
[54:23] the blood of a jew that saved you well
[54:25] nor was it the blood of a gentile it was
[54:27] the blood of god that was shed that day
[54:28] on calvary as the apostle paul would
[54:31] speak there in acts 20 28 take heed
[54:34] therefore unto yourselves and to all the
[54:35] flock
[54:36] over which the holy ghost hath made you
[54:38] overseas to feed the flock of god which
[54:41] he hath purchased with his own blood
[54:44] so he makes it very clear it was the
[54:45] blood of god it wasn't the blood of a
[54:47] jew or a gentile or a holy man it was
[54:49] the blood of god himself
[54:51] that was shed now
[54:53] there is great power in this blood
[54:55] where it is there is such power in this
[54:58] blood that it can change a person that
[55:00] they won't vary from the word one bit
[55:03] amen there's power this is not us trying
[55:05] to reform ourselves this is the supreme
[55:07] power of god the supreme deity coming
[55:10] into you and manifesting his word out of
[55:12] your life
[55:13] amen he would say brother brown was
[55:14] saying condemnation by representation oh
[55:17] brother god said it happens
[55:19] he says and that settles it it's always
[55:21] god said so jesus died that he might
[55:23] breed back oh hallelujah only the blood
[55:25] can do that only through the chemistry
[55:27] of the blood of jesus christ can breed
[55:29] back again a person that won't vary one
[55:32] word from what god said amen so there's
[55:35] power in the blood to change our nature
[55:37] we were born wrong to begin with but
[55:39] there's transforming power in his blood
[55:41] to breed us back let's see he's just
[55:42] using that kind of language to change
[55:44] our hearts that we won't vary from one
[55:46] word of god i mean there's power in that
[55:49] it's not our human mind trying to trying
[55:51] to keep this word now i may repeat
[55:53] myself but the devil's a liar i just
[55:55] want to just stand all over his
[55:57] face this morning
[55:58] amen because we're not here to play
[56:00] church we're not here to play religion
[56:01] amen no we're here to serve the living
[56:03] god
[56:04] amen this is not just a group thing this
[56:06] is a individual revelation
[56:08] amen because if you realize your god's
[56:10] unstoppable you become unstoppable i
[56:12] mean no weapon formed against you shall
[56:14] prosper i mean there'll be a lot of
[56:16] weapons a lot of mind battles a lot of
[56:17] doubts and flusterations may be formed
[56:19] against you but it won't prosper against
[56:21] you none amen if you realize that your
[56:23] handship is supreme
[56:25] hallelujah
[56:27] amen because real hatred elevates a
[56:29] person into god's ordained position for
[56:31] them amen caleb realized that they that
[56:34] that it wasn't moses saying the land is
[56:37] yours he realized that it wasn't moses
[56:39] saying this is the ten commandments it
[56:41] wasn't the ten commandments of moses i
[56:43] mean it wasn't moses idea it was god's
[56:45] idea and so caleb came under the
[56:47] headship of the pillar of fire that
[56:49] delivered them out of egypt amen and he
[56:51] received his inheritance right because
[56:53] he realized it wasn't it was not moses
[56:56] being their head
[56:57] god was there here amen the supreme
[57:00] deity was their head
[57:02] amen as the same thing with you and i
[57:04] will realize that this message is not a
[57:06] healing ministry only it's not even a
[57:08] prophet's ministry only but is jesus
[57:10] christ revealed i mean then it will
[57:12] elevate you into your god-ordained
[57:14] position as a bride of christ maybe when
[57:16] you hear the voice behind the voice amen
[57:18] where it goes from a mental remember
[57:20] faith is not accepting a bunch of facts
[57:22] and saying that's true that's not faith
[57:24] that's that's just a mental recognition
[57:27] that is correct no faith receives it and
[57:29] then god reveals it
[57:31] amen it's vice versa to human
[57:33] understanding
[57:34] amen he and caleb and joshua are under
[57:37] different hatred because they realize it
[57:38] wasn't moses
[57:40] that was leading them god was their head
[57:43] and because of that they could look
[57:44] beyond the humanity of moses they could
[57:46] look beyond his you know his his his his
[57:49] humanity they could look beyond that and
[57:51] they could see god and they received a
[57:53] reward from god
[57:55] we've got to do the same thing friends
[57:57] to look beyond the humanity of one
[57:58] another look beyond the humanity of the
[58:00] prophet
[58:01] amen and hear the voice behind the voice
[58:03] now
[58:04] it's very important that we realize that
[58:06] god has given us instruction
[58:09] to defeat every enemy
[58:12] this is why the angel of the lord comes
[58:14] you read through the book of judges the
[58:16] angel lord would reveal himself to
[58:17] gideon different ones to bring
[58:19] deliverance right i wasn't just now do
[58:21] this because i just want you to do
[58:22] something no no there are specific
[58:24] instructions to bring deliverance now
[58:26] when the angel of the lord spoke to
[58:28] samson's mother now the angel of the
[58:31] lord is god in angelic form right we
[58:33] understand that don't we right it is not
[58:35] just an angel as a messenger it's
[58:37] actually god in angelic form he would
[58:39] change his veil to be an angel then he'd
[58:40] go speak and um manoa sampson's father
[58:44] thought it was actually just a man
[58:46] because that's what he looked like that
[58:47] was the form he took on you go read
[58:49] their in judges but it was god they
[58:51] realized it was god they're afraid we're
[58:52] going to die because we've seen god but
[58:54] the angel of the lord gave a specific
[58:56] instructions to samson's mother
[58:58] aiming telling her don't drink any
[59:01] strong drink or wine or eat any unclean
[59:03] thing because out of you is going to
[59:04] come a deliverer out of you if i can put
[59:07] it this way it's going to become a
[59:08] messiah so she had to be a separated
[59:11] person in order that deliverance would
[59:13] come forth out of her
[59:14] for israel
[59:16] so it wasn't just now don't don't drink
[59:18] wine or have strong drink or any unclean
[59:21] thing for for no reason there's a
[59:23] specific reason behind it and god is
[59:25] showing us here that if we because
[59:27] remember a woman types the church in the
[59:28] bible if we could be separated unto god
[59:31] their messiah can be born in our midst
[59:33] and bring deliverance amen can actually
[59:35] destroy the enemies that are trying to
[59:36] destroy us
[59:38] so it's very important we realize that
[59:40] the instructions of the message is to
[59:41] bring deliverance it's not just to make
[59:44] us live a different kind of a life for
[59:45] the sake of it no that deliverance would
[59:47] come healing would come demon spirits
[59:49] would be cast out amen the holy ghost
[59:51] would be received amen protocols would
[59:54] return people from the other side of the
[59:55] ocean god can get a hold of them and
[59:57] bring them home amen bring them home to
[59:59] him geography is nothing to god i mean
[1:00:01] so that's why we've got to realize
[1:00:03] there's a reason we live a sanctified
[1:00:05] holy life as that deliverance would be
[1:00:07] born
[1:00:08] amen the messiah would be born i mean
[1:00:10] not just some not just some fallen man
[1:00:12] that just gives us heart to delilah and
[1:00:15] the strength of god but the word itself
[1:00:16] would come into full manifestation
[1:00:19] hallelujah that's why we're gathered
[1:00:20] that's what this message is sent to
[1:00:22] achieve as you're listening to uh the
[1:00:24] air is not seed with the the the seed is
[1:00:27] not here with the shook and you know
[1:00:28] he's saying that the seed there's time
[1:00:30] for the full manifestation of the
[1:00:32] fullness of god's power to be made known
[1:00:34] i mean it's not just a partial reality
[1:00:36] but the full reality of his word all
[1:00:38] that god is would be manifested in a
[1:00:40] people and i'm just thinking that's our
[1:00:42] day this is our time
[1:00:44] hallelujah i made you think well you're
[1:00:45] just excited over nothing no i'm excited
[1:00:47] over the word of god because we're
[1:00:49] living in the season of a full
[1:00:51] deliverance living in a season where
[1:00:53] people can really meet god and their
[1:00:55] lives can never be the same and then go
[1:00:57] from victory to victory hey some
[1:00:59] victories may be hard there's gonna be a
[1:01:00] lot of dying out but god can live in a
[1:01:02] people in such a way that they can look
[1:01:04] back and say every devil's come under my
[1:01:06] feet
[1:01:07] hallelujah amen this is the hour of it
[1:01:10] you say well they god would never choose
[1:01:12] me god chooses the unlikelies of the
[1:01:14] scripture i mean look at rahab she was a
[1:01:16] harlot look at tamar look at you know
[1:01:18] look at all the ones he he picked the
[1:01:20] woman at the well you know the woman
[1:01:22] with the alabaster box matthew was a tax
[1:01:24] collector all the the other
[1:01:26] apostles were you know they couldn't
[1:01:28] even read sign their own names but god
[1:01:30] used him as a mighty power
[1:01:33] amen so god's the same with us never
[1:01:35] ever think that you know you know god
[1:01:37] would never choose you know he's chosen
[1:01:38] you
[1:01:40] amen he's already put your name in his
[1:01:42] book but we've got to realize that our
[1:01:43] name is in his book
[1:01:45] hallelujah
[1:01:47] amen
[1:01:48] praise god now
[1:01:51] so
[1:01:52] if we can i trust we can get to a place
[1:01:54] and and and i believe that we're we are
[1:01:57] there but
[1:01:58] you know brother brown would say this
[1:01:59] and faith once delivered to the saints
[1:02:01] it's god's eternal spoken word by born
[1:02:05] again people by prayer asking god and
[1:02:07] god's obligated to his word
[1:02:09] when that real not put on not make
[1:02:11] believe but a real settled faith is in a
[1:02:13] man's heart that don't vary from god's
[1:02:16] word a bit it's god's word being spoken
[1:02:18] by mortal lips that's the faith that was
[1:02:21] once delivered to the saints i mean so a
[1:02:24] real faith that's settled in a man's
[1:02:25] heart that don't vary from god's word so
[1:02:28] he never said that a real faith is you'd
[1:02:29] be uh you
[1:02:31] you'd have no trouble you'd have no mind
[1:02:33] battles you'd have no trouble going on
[1:02:35] no no that's not the faith you're
[1:02:36] talking about but a real settles faith
[1:02:38] in a man's heart
[1:02:39] that it can't vary it don't vary from
[1:02:41] god's word a bit
[1:02:42] that's the faith that's once delivered
[1:02:44] to the saints
[1:02:46] right so i believe we can we are now
[1:02:49] this is you know
[1:02:50] really i'm just telling you who you are
[1:02:52] you know we need to realize who we are
[1:02:54] because the prophet said once she
[1:02:55] realizes who she is
[1:02:57] then the rapture will go when the bride
[1:02:59] realizes who she is amen that we are
[1:03:01] we are the word made flesh today
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:05] so now
[1:03:08] we're living in an hour where the
[1:03:10] fullness of god has been all the power
[1:03:12] of heaven's been turned loose upon the
[1:03:13] earth
[1:03:14] right we can we can say how dark the
[1:03:17] world is you know we can read in
[1:03:18] revelations 9 the bottomless pit's open
[1:03:20] there's all these demon powers being
[1:03:21] released but we know that's not the end
[1:03:23] of the story because when john saw that
[1:03:26] happen in revelations 9 then in
[1:03:27] revelations 10 he says then i saw
[1:03:29] another mighty angel to sin so christ
[1:03:31] himself an angelic form came down upon
[1:03:33] the earth aiming to put his feet on one
[1:03:35] foot on the sea and one upon the land so
[1:03:37] the powers that came out of the sea
[1:03:39] multitudes peoples nations and tongues
[1:03:41] right of people right and the powers
[1:03:43] that come out of the earth out of
[1:03:44] america different places you know those
[1:03:47] powers the anointing of god comes down
[1:03:50] and subdues those in your life
[1:03:52] amen that you can receive the full
[1:03:54] inheritance of god's word
[1:03:56] amen amen because because it says in
[1:03:58] revelations 10 that his feet were his
[1:03:59] pillars of fire well where are those
[1:04:01] where is the pillar of fire today it's
[1:04:03] in you
[1:04:04] right it's a new amen trip that so if so
[1:04:06] if his feet are in you if i put it there
[1:04:08] the pillars of fire the pillow fires in
[1:04:10] you then that gives you dominion over
[1:04:12] all the unclean spirits of this world
[1:04:16] i mean so we can say how dark the world
[1:04:18] is but we really should say how light
[1:04:20] the world is
[1:04:21] in terms of the illumination by the
[1:04:23] gospel of jesus christ amen that we that
[1:04:26] the that the holy ghost is no longer
[1:04:28] bound by man's creeds and traditions
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:32] it was bound
[1:04:34] so it could just come out partially
[1:04:36] through the church ages that's why
[1:04:38] luther all they had was just shall live
[1:04:39] by faith but those who truly justify by
[1:04:41] faith they were sealed to the kingdom by
[1:04:43] the holy ghost but they but but it
[1:04:45] wasn't exactly when you read the book of
[1:04:47] acts and and compared the lutheran
[1:04:49] movement it wasn't the same because it
[1:04:50] was restoring back
[1:04:52] and then and then wesley was a bit
[1:04:54] closer second worker of grace a
[1:04:56] sanctified life right so they believe
[1:04:58] that joshua lived by faith and they are
[1:04:59] sanctified a bit closer to the book of
[1:05:01] acts but it wasn't there
[1:05:03] and then now we have the pentecostal
[1:05:05] restoration of the gifts
[1:05:06] now now the gifts of the spirit are
[1:05:09] multiplied through the earth it's a bit
[1:05:11] close to the book of acts but it's not
[1:05:13] the book of acts yet
[1:05:14] why because in the book of acts it was
[1:05:16] god living in the people not just
[1:05:18] anointing them directing him by his
[1:05:20] spirit
[1:05:21] amen where it wasn't the original book
[1:05:23] of acts there was no traditions of man
[1:05:25] mixed up with the faith of the believers
[1:05:27] right but you get to about acts 15 or 16
[1:05:30] it says and some of the pharisees that
[1:05:32] believed on jesus said unless people
[1:05:35] become you know obey the law of moses
[1:05:37] they cannot become christians
[1:05:39] well there's there's a very big problem
[1:05:41] with that picture
[1:05:42] because the problem with that picture is
[1:05:44] these pharisees who say basically you've
[1:05:46] got to become a jew before you can
[1:05:47] become a christian
[1:05:48] and they're still calling themselves
[1:05:50] pharisees
[1:05:51] that's a problem
[1:05:53] it should really be no no no they're
[1:05:54] christians if they're really born again
[1:05:56] by the holy ghost gods burn all the
[1:05:58] traditions of man out of them there'll
[1:06:00] be no pharisee ideas lingering around so
[1:06:02] they just become part of the group
[1:06:04] that's why it's so important don't just
[1:06:06] feed off the spirit of god
[1:06:08] people can live in the atmosphere of god
[1:06:09] but not have god in them so they can
[1:06:11] enjoy the meetings they can enjoy a camp
[1:06:13] and they can and they're just living off
[1:06:15] an atmosphere and that's just a camp
[1:06:17] experience or a church experience but by
[1:06:18] monday you'll back down where you were
[1:06:20] don't just feed off an atmosphere for a
[1:06:22] time let that atmosphere come into you
[1:06:24] which is the holy ghost himself right
[1:06:26] and then when you go monday having
[1:06:28] sunday on a monday and then sunday on a
[1:06:30] tuesday and sunday on a wednesday then
[1:06:32] you have wednesday as well so you having
[1:06:33] sunday wednesday on thursday and then
[1:06:35] sunday wednesday on a friday then
[1:06:37] saturday the same thing on sunday we've
[1:06:39] got sunday wednesday sunday on a sunday
[1:06:41] and just builds hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:44] so don't just ride an atmosphere but let
[1:06:47] that atmosphere come unto you
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:51] praise the lord he says and feast the
[1:06:53] trumpet says while this group down here
[1:06:54] has said two thousand bound two
[1:06:57] two hundred thousand bound at the river
[1:06:59] euphrates has been bound for two
[1:07:01] thousand years also that church has been
[1:07:02] bound has bound the holy ghost nearly
[1:07:04] two thousand years under martyrdom back
[1:07:06] there and under the church ages it's
[1:07:08] been bound not at the river euphrates
[1:07:10] but the door of creeds and dogmas that
[1:07:11] the holy spirit can't work in the church
[1:07:14] because of man-made systems she is going
[1:07:16] to be liberated she's coming back that's
[1:07:19] what the bible said and those two meet
[1:07:22] one another on the battlegrounds lucifer
[1:07:24] and michael again like in the beginning
[1:07:25] they have been bound for two thousand
[1:07:27] years almost
[1:07:28] almost 2 000 years is from the feast of
[1:07:30] the trumpet so he's saying that it's
[1:07:31] been bound but she's going to be
[1:07:32] liberated and i'll say she's been
[1:07:35] liberated
[1:07:36] right our liberations happen
[1:07:38] i mean if you've really met god you're
[1:07:39] liberated you're free whom the son is
[1:07:42] set free is free indeed amen you're not
[1:07:43] bound by traditions or or cultural this
[1:07:46] is how i was raised these kind of
[1:07:48] understandings no we we have been loosed
[1:07:50] from those things amen to believe god
[1:07:52] and spirit and truth to worship such you
[1:07:55] say well is it possible for traditions
[1:07:57] to make the word of god no effect
[1:07:59] absolutely because jesus would say in
[1:08:01] mark 7 13 says making the word of god of
[1:08:04] none effect through your tradition which
[1:08:06] you have delivered and many such like
[1:08:08] things do ye see saying that your
[1:08:10] traditions remember they had the they
[1:08:13] had the law
[1:08:14] they had the law the jews had the law
[1:08:16] now the purpose of the law wasn't just
[1:08:18] them to have a you know sure a big part
[1:08:20] of it was that they would be able to
[1:08:23] access god right they could worship god
[1:08:25] their sins could be covered by the blood
[1:08:27] but moses gave very clear instruction
[1:08:29] god spoke through moses saying that if
[1:08:31] you follow my word then every man will
[1:08:34] dwell under his fig tree with his own
[1:08:36] vineyard in his own land and peace
[1:08:38] right so basically saying that whenever
[1:08:40] the enemy would come against you if you
[1:08:41] stand for my word then i'll stand for
[1:08:43] you and i will fight your battles right
[1:08:46] that was a big part of the law it wasn't
[1:08:47] just keeping ceremony but the thing is
[1:08:50] they brought in the tradition the
[1:08:52] traditions of man
[1:08:54] and they forgot there was actually power
[1:08:55] in that word
[1:08:57] and then so now they're sitting under a
[1:08:58] roman empire
[1:09:00] trying to politically say how can we
[1:09:02] keep this thing going
[1:09:04] because traditions that came in and made
[1:09:06] the word of god no effect to them
[1:09:08] because there's no power anymore in
[1:09:10] their religion
[1:09:11] right but the true but the true word has
[1:09:15] power
[1:09:16] amen when there's no tradition there
[1:09:18] there's power there's power to transform
[1:09:21] lives there's power to heal the sickness
[1:09:22] power to raise the dead there's power to
[1:09:24] break conflict complexes take fear away
[1:09:27] take trouble amen to cast demon spirits
[1:09:30] out that there be peace
[1:09:32] amen
[1:09:34] right so
[1:09:36] we don't want to allow tradition or make
[1:09:38] this message a tradition
[1:09:41] right because it can become a tradition
[1:09:44] but may it never become a tradition
[1:09:45] might always be a living word a living
[1:09:48] reality a heartfelt religion
[1:09:50] amen now
[1:09:52] we know that the angel of the lord
[1:09:54] accompanies the message always
[1:09:57] so wherever the word of god is the angel
[1:10:00] of god is there to manifest it
[1:10:03] right that it's not just us trying to
[1:10:05] fulfill it but it's him coming and
[1:10:07] anointing us that it's fulfilled in our
[1:10:09] lives now this is very important because
[1:10:12] when we realize that it's not it's
[1:10:14] actually god anointing us
[1:10:16] delivers word
[1:10:18] god inspiring us quicking us making it
[1:10:21] alive
[1:10:22] amen that it's not just us trying to
[1:10:24] fulfill it
[1:10:25] that this open door of revelation has
[1:10:27] given great power
[1:10:29] amen the revelation of the supreme death
[1:10:31] of jesus of jesus christ has given great
[1:10:34] power to you and i
[1:10:37] praise the lord i hope you're still here
[1:10:39] now
[1:10:40] brother brown would say the patmos
[1:10:41] vision he says the greatest of all
[1:10:43] revelations is the deity the supreme
[1:10:45] deity of our lord jesus christ he says
[1:10:48] you can't get the first base until you
[1:10:50] believe that so basically says you can't
[1:10:52] even start your walk until you believe
[1:10:54] that jesus christ is the supreme deity
[1:10:56] remember god is not just some ether
[1:10:58] thing without any personality or ideas
[1:11:00] or thoughts or no his name is jesus
[1:11:03] right
[1:11:04] amen remember the highest name given is
[1:11:06] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:11:08] amen so you can't even start your walk
[1:11:11] until you believe that i mean that's
[1:11:12] what peter said when he would when he
[1:11:14] would preach the first ever sermon there
[1:11:16] on you know yo yo the day of pentecost
[1:11:18] where he says that god has made the same
[1:11:20] jesus both lord and christ he's
[1:11:22] basically saying he's he is the supreme
[1:11:23] one
[1:11:24] amen and then he said he said repent
[1:11:27] place he said repent and see the deity
[1:11:29] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:11:32] for the remission of your sins and then
[1:11:34] you're ready to get in the spirit the
[1:11:36] first thing that you have to know is the
[1:11:38] deity of christ i'm alpha and omega i'm
[1:11:40] the a to z there's no more but me i was
[1:11:42] at the beginning i'll be at the end i am
[1:11:44] he that was which is and shall come the
[1:11:46] almighty think of it that's what the
[1:11:48] trumpet said that's what john was told
[1:11:50] in the book of revelation chapter one
[1:11:52] amen so he is not just part of god he is
[1:11:54] god
[1:11:56] hallelujah amen as isaiah would say in
[1:11:58] isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born
[1:12:01] unto us the son is given and the
[1:12:03] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:12:05] and his name shall be wonderful counsel
[1:12:07] of the mighty god the everlasting father
[1:12:09] the prince of peace i mean where brother
[1:12:11] brown would ask a question to a to a
[1:12:13] jewish rabbi saying you know because you
[1:12:16] know he's saying oh no jesus was just a
[1:12:18] man because he read the new you know
[1:12:20] apparently we're the new testament and
[1:12:22] and then so and then so brother and ask
[1:12:23] them why would your prophets ever make a
[1:12:25] mistake i said no of course not so he
[1:12:28] asked him now well then who was who was
[1:12:30] isaiah referring to in isaiah 9 6.
[1:12:33] you know well
[1:12:34] would would messiah be god
[1:12:37] he said absolutely but then but then the
[1:12:38] rabbi said but if i you know if i preach
[1:12:41] that to my people i'll be i'll be
[1:12:43] drinking branch water eating soda
[1:12:44] crackers basically i wouldn't have any
[1:12:47] um income or employment and brother i
[1:12:48] said i'd rather be eating eating soda
[1:12:50] crackers drinking branch water and
[1:12:52] preaching the truth then then be having
[1:12:55] a big massive church somewhere see but
[1:12:57] so he could himself see that when isaiah
[1:12:59] said that that the messiah would be god
[1:13:02] himself and jesus fulfilled the
[1:13:04] requirements
[1:13:05] his life manifested that i mean so he
[1:13:08] wasn't just a man he was god made flesh
[1:13:11] amen absolutely important now
[1:13:14] brother baum says about this open door
[1:13:16] he says we can see that jesus is the
[1:13:17] door he's the door of the sheep this is
[1:13:19] from john 10 i believe and notice that
[1:13:21] it speaks now of the door opening what
[1:13:24] is that but a revelation of him and that
[1:13:26] revelation is the opening is opening up
[1:13:28] to bring us strength to illuminate the
[1:13:31] word and to glorify his name that's what
[1:13:33] revelation
[1:13:35] does it gives us spiritual strength
[1:13:38] amen when god revealed to you you're
[1:13:40] you're his son or you're his daughter
[1:13:41] that gives you strength over the enemy
[1:13:43] when you realize actually god's my
[1:13:45] father yeah my natural father and mother
[1:13:47] sure they just brought me here but god's
[1:13:49] my real father i mean it gives you
[1:13:51] strength because you realize actually
[1:13:53] this this culture doesn't define me
[1:13:55] right my natural birth doesn't even
[1:13:57] define me no the word of god defies me
[1:14:00] because god is my father it gives you
[1:14:02] strength when you realize actually i'm a
[1:14:04] son of god i don't have to put up with
[1:14:05] the devil's nonsense no more i'd have to
[1:14:07] put up with depression and pride and you
[1:14:10] know pity parties and feeling sorry for
[1:14:12] myself no it open it gives you a
[1:14:13] strength
[1:14:15] amen i trust we've had that experience
[1:14:17] i've had that experience amen and it's
[1:14:18] to illuminate the word so the word goes
[1:14:20] from just letters on a page in stories
[1:14:22] to a living reality
[1:14:25] amen and to glorify his name that's what
[1:14:27] revelation should do shouldn't it
[1:14:28] glorify his name and when god reveals
[1:14:30] saying to you it doesn't make your stuff
[1:14:32] shirt you just love him more well it
[1:14:34] glorifies his name
[1:14:37] amen it was in the midst of the last two
[1:14:39] ages that the revelation of the deity of
[1:14:41] jesus christ blossomed out before us yes
[1:14:43] we knew he was god how else could he be
[1:14:45] our savior but to know that he was the
[1:14:47] only god or god alone that he was the
[1:14:49] alpha and the omega that is jesus was
[1:14:51] both lord and christ making him lord
[1:14:54] jesus christ the father the son and the
[1:14:56] holy ghost all one person it's been lost
[1:14:58] since the first church ages but now we
[1:15:00] see it again the revelation of who he
[1:15:02] was has come back indeed the godhead is
[1:15:05] not a three-person god with one
[1:15:06] personality for it takes personality to
[1:15:09] make a person if there's one personality
[1:15:12] there is but one person but they who
[1:15:14] believe in three persons have a three
[1:15:16] god godhead and are guilty of breaking
[1:15:18] the first commandment
[1:15:20] amen but the revelation of the godhead
[1:15:22] is back now the true church can be built
[1:15:24] in strength again after all this time
[1:15:26] she finally knows who her lord is once
[1:15:29] again we are baptizing the name of the
[1:15:31] lord jesus christ just as they did at
[1:15:33] pentecost and that's why the word builds
[1:15:36] us in strength it doesn't make us
[1:15:38] lopsided it doesn't make us wobbly and
[1:15:40] weak no it builds our character to be
[1:15:41] strong i mean it gives us a grit and a
[1:15:44] you know uh your
[1:15:45] a determination it doesn't make us
[1:15:47] jellyfish it gives you gives you a
[1:15:48] backbone like a like a saw log you know
[1:15:51] it makes us strong amen because remember
[1:15:53] those that know their god shall be
[1:15:55] strong and do exploits amen so the
[1:15:57] church is built in strength you say i'm
[1:15:59] weak today no no you're strong
[1:16:01] i'm the devil wants you to think you're
[1:16:03] weak you're strong in the lord i mean
[1:16:04] he's made you strong he hasn't made you
[1:16:06] weak hallelujah you may be going through
[1:16:08] a battle but you're still strong it
[1:16:10] doesn't matter the size of the battle
[1:16:11] you've still got a strength right
[1:16:13] hallelujah
[1:16:15] amen so we are being built in strength
[1:16:18] again that's what faith does strengthens
[1:16:20] us
[1:16:20] amen faith does not weaken us it
[1:16:22] strengthens us encourages us establishes
[1:16:25] us in the faith
[1:16:26] amen it's very very important
[1:16:30] now paul would say in hebrews 1
[1:16:33] he says god who at sundered times in
[1:16:35] diverse manners spake and times past
[1:16:37] unto the fathers by the prophets hath in
[1:16:39] these last days spoken unto us by his
[1:16:41] son whom he hath appointed air of all
[1:16:43] things by whom also he made the worlds
[1:16:46] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:16:48] and the expressed image of his person
[1:16:50] and upholding all the things by the word
[1:16:52] of his power when he had by himself
[1:16:55] purged our sins sat down on the right
[1:16:57] hand of the majesty on high being made
[1:16:59] so much better than the angels as he has
[1:17:01] by inheritance obtained a more excellent
[1:17:03] name than they then he goes and he and
[1:17:05] he differentiates between god but
[1:17:08] between christ right and between men and
[1:17:10] between angels
[1:17:11] you know he makes that very clear that
[1:17:13] that he's the expressed image of his
[1:17:15] person so he's saying that all that god
[1:17:16] was you see in christ that's why jesus
[1:17:18] said you know philip or one of them said
[1:17:21] trust the father it'll it'll satisfy us
[1:17:23] and he says have i been so long with you
[1:17:25] and you don't know me who has seen me
[1:17:27] have seen the father right so he was the
[1:17:29] image of the invisible god
[1:17:31] amen as paul would say in colossians he
[1:17:34] says who is the image of the invisible
[1:17:35] god the firstborn of every creature for
[1:17:38] by him are all things created there in
[1:17:40] heaven that are in earth visible and
[1:17:42] invisible whether they be thrones or
[1:17:44] dominions or principalities or powers
[1:17:46] all things were created by him
[1:17:48] and for him
[1:17:50] now it's very important that we realize
[1:17:52] that god and his word are one amen you
[1:17:55] can't separate god in his word now this
[1:17:58] may be elementary but it's very powerful
[1:18:00] when we realize who's here
[1:18:02] who's here our hate ship is here brother
[1:18:04] makes it very clear in christ the
[1:18:05] mystery god revealed the headship is
[1:18:06] here right our head is here we're not
[1:18:08] looking sure we're going to meet him
[1:18:10] physically in the air but the headship
[1:18:11] of the word is here christ himself in
[1:18:13] spirit form us here right to camp off
[1:18:16] our lives
[1:18:17] amen so now it says in psalms 107 he
[1:18:20] sent his word and healed them and
[1:18:22] delivered them from their destructions
[1:18:24] oh that men would praise the lord for
[1:18:26] his goodness and for his wonderful works
[1:18:28] to the children of men and let them
[1:18:30] sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving
[1:18:32] and declare his works with rejoicing now
[1:18:36] we might take this and think that his
[1:18:37] word he sent his words is like you send
[1:18:39] something that's separate from you
[1:18:41] but when god sends this word it's
[1:18:43] actually himself coming to do a job
[1:18:45] amen as it says in john 1 and 1 in the
[1:18:47] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:18:50] with god and the word was god it to me
[1:18:53] so so john here is inspired to to to
[1:18:56] write to us and say you're god's
[1:18:57] speaking through him saying now that the
[1:18:59] word is god
[1:19:01] right if you leave the word you've left
[1:19:03] god
[1:19:04] it's that symbol if you stay with the
[1:19:05] word you're staying with god if you
[1:19:07] start with the word you're walking with
[1:19:08] god but if you leave it for your own
[1:19:10] understanding where you've left god
[1:19:12] right so the word and him are one so
[1:19:15] when he sent his word and healed them
[1:19:17] he's actually coming and and bringing
[1:19:19] healing
[1:19:20] right it's not a separate you can't see
[1:19:22] break god and his word they are one and
[1:19:23] the same so when he sends his word to
[1:19:25] the earth that is god being revealed
[1:19:27] amen right down to the prophets of the
[1:19:29] old testament it was a partial
[1:19:31] revelation that's why when jesus asked
[1:19:33] the disciples who did men say that i am
[1:19:35] they said some say you're elias or
[1:19:37] jeremiah or one of the prophets and the
[1:19:38] reason they said that is because what
[1:19:40] they saw jesus do they say that reminds
[1:19:43] you of moses or that reminds you of
[1:19:44] jeremiah that reminds me of elijah
[1:19:46] because they because they saw a part of
[1:19:48] god was manifested in those prophets but
[1:19:51] all the prophets where the fullness of
[1:19:52] god had body was now in christ jesus
[1:19:54] right so so that was just a partial
[1:19:56] revelation of god down through but now
[1:19:58] we've come to the fullness of god has
[1:20:00] been made known
[1:20:02] so it's not just part of his nature part
[1:20:04] of his character it's all of him
[1:20:06] hallelujah that's why we're not just
[1:20:08] saved by faith but god comes and fills
[1:20:10] us with the holy ghost right that's why
[1:20:12] divine healing is is manifested in this
[1:20:14] day because he's a healer right we've
[1:20:17] seen redemption we've seen all that he
[1:20:18] is the prince of powers and powers in
[1:20:20] heavenly places had been made known
[1:20:22] through the through the church
[1:20:25] amen
[1:20:27] hallelujah see because many people think
[1:20:29] they
[1:20:30] they get a romantic notion if they could
[1:20:32] just go back 2 000 years ago and and
[1:20:35] walk the shores of galilee with jesus
[1:20:37] then they could really then they could
[1:20:39] really pull their hearts out to him and
[1:20:40] he could answer every question
[1:20:43] all people think if they could just go
[1:20:44] back to the time of the prophet
[1:20:47] then god would come down reveal their
[1:20:48] needs through that prophet
[1:20:50] and you know you're through brother
[1:20:52] brown's ministry because the son of man
[1:20:53] was revealed there and then they could
[1:20:55] just know everything and you know all
[1:20:56] would be well but that but but people
[1:20:58] fail to realize that that same word is
[1:21:00] here
[1:21:01] right that same god is now present in
[1:21:03] 2022. he didn't die
[1:21:06] when jesus ascended in acts 1 that
[1:21:08] wasn't the end of it that same god came
[1:21:10] and dwelt in the disciples right
[1:21:12] and when the prophet left in 65 that
[1:21:15] same mighty angel christ himself was
[1:21:16] still upon the earth gathering us to
[1:21:19] himself
[1:21:20] right so he has not he has not
[1:21:22] diminished one iota
[1:21:25] amen he has not diminished empower
[1:21:27] ability right just because his physical
[1:21:30] form that was here two thousand years
[1:21:32] ago is not here upon the earth does not
[1:21:34] make him any weaker does not make him
[1:21:36] any less able to save or to heal or
[1:21:38] redeem or answer questions or bring
[1:21:40] peace he's still the same god
[1:21:43] because he and his word are one
[1:21:46] so i can say wherever his word is the
[1:21:48] angel lord is there to confirm that word
[1:21:51] then he is right here because he is his
[1:21:54] word
[1:21:55] right that same god is right pray you
[1:21:57] know i think if we could just really
[1:21:58] open our spiritual understanding and see
[1:22:00] the one that moves in our services
[1:22:03] right the one that comes to camp with us
[1:22:05] and this is around the world wherever
[1:22:07] wherever the children of god are god
[1:22:08] begins to move the anointing begins to
[1:22:10] fall that's that same one it's as if
[1:22:12] jesus literally walked in the room
[1:22:15] in the physical form right because it's
[1:22:16] the same god that's like that you're the
[1:22:18] one with the blood or she's saying if i
[1:22:19] just touch the hem of his garment i can
[1:22:20] be made whole we can still touch the hem
[1:22:23] of his garment by faith
[1:22:25] hallelujah he's still the same god just
[1:22:27] like blind bartimaeus called out them
[1:22:29] with his faith that made him stand still
[1:22:31] we can still make him stand still and
[1:22:33] meet our need
[1:22:34] as he's walking through this age
[1:22:37] praise the lord
[1:22:39] amen we can pour our hearts out to him
[1:22:41] right now and he can answer us exactly
[1:22:44] like he did in the days of his flesh
[1:22:46] praise to god because remember remember
[1:22:48] he praise the lord because he is his
[1:22:51] word now
[1:22:53] gentile faith realizes this
[1:22:56] there is a centurion that had a sick
[1:22:58] servant listen this is matthew 8 i won't
[1:23:00] i won't read it just to save a bit of
[1:23:02] time but you know jesus jesus was was
[1:23:06] approached by the centurion and the
[1:23:08] centurion says i've got a sick i've got
[1:23:10] a sick servant you know he's at home and
[1:23:13] jesus says you know i'll go i'll go and
[1:23:15] heal him yeah i'll come he because he's
[1:23:17] graviously tormented with palsy but then
[1:23:19] the centurion said i'm not worthy that
[1:23:21] you should come under my roof right but
[1:23:23] speak the word only and my servant shall
[1:23:25] be healed because i'm a man under
[1:23:27] authority and i call someone he goes
[1:23:29] here i call someone else he goes there
[1:23:32] and so you know but you know so so
[1:23:35] because i can see the authority that
[1:23:37] that i have you have in a far greater
[1:23:39] measure
[1:23:40] you just speak the word
[1:23:42] and it will be so
[1:23:43] and jesus heard it and he marveled
[1:23:45] saying i've not seen faith like there's
[1:23:47] no not in israel
[1:23:48] because
[1:23:49] the roman centurion realized that he
[1:23:52] actually recognized the supreme deity of
[1:23:54] jesus christ
[1:23:56] and that that's what brother that's what
[1:23:57] brother bram said in blind bartimaeus he
[1:23:59] said what was that roman doing he was
[1:24:01] recognizing the supreme deity of jesus
[1:24:03] christ i mean because he realized that
[1:24:05] jesus words had power absolute power
[1:24:08] that's what said you don't physically
[1:24:09] need to come and put your hands upon my
[1:24:11] servant and say be well but just speak
[1:24:14] the word only and he had gentile faith
[1:24:16] because he realized that jesus speaking
[1:24:18] his word or jesus sending his word was
[1:24:20] exactly the same as if jesus physically
[1:24:23] walked into his house physically laid
[1:24:24] hands upon the servant physically prayed
[1:24:27] for him and then physically walked away
[1:24:29] so jesus sending his word is exactly the
[1:24:31] same as if he steps into this room
[1:24:34] right lays his hands upon you talks to
[1:24:36] you says you're going to be well that's
[1:24:38] exactly the same he doesn't physically
[1:24:40] need to come here and do it because he
[1:24:42] sent his word and he and his word are
[1:24:44] exactly the same being
[1:24:47] amen so god has sent his word and it
[1:24:50] will accomplish that which is sent to do
[1:24:52] amen so if he sent his word and he says
[1:24:54] i'm going to have a bride made in my
[1:24:56] image i mean she's going to be made in
[1:24:58] his image he's going to be made in the
[1:24:59] image of the world amen so now you say
[1:25:01] well i'm sick well he but he sent his
[1:25:03] word and he healed them all and we can
[1:25:05] realize the very god amen because he is
[1:25:08] his word he sent a word upon the earth
[1:25:10] and that and that word to us is not
[1:25:12] condemnation
[1:25:14] that word is not judgment that word is
[1:25:16] not destruction that word is salvation
[1:25:19] it's deliverance it's healing it's
[1:25:21] identity
[1:25:22] amen and just as that centurion was a
[1:25:25] man under his ship because to be a man
[1:25:27] in authority you're going to be a man
[1:25:28] under authority
[1:25:30] man or woman right so so to be in
[1:25:32] authority you're going to be under
[1:25:33] authority
[1:25:34] right so if you're under your own
[1:25:35] authority you're not going to have any
[1:25:37] authority right but if you're under the
[1:25:38] authority of the word of god then you'll
[1:25:40] have the authority of the word of god
[1:25:43] right and then no enemy can stand before
[1:25:45] you
[1:25:46] hallelujah because to be in authority
[1:25:48] you've got to be under authority
[1:25:50] i mean so the centurion was under
[1:25:52] authority and he was in authority
[1:25:54] because he was under the authority but
[1:25:55] it was just an authority of a roman
[1:25:57] government
[1:25:59] but he realized that jesus had authority
[1:26:01] that was far greater than him and his
[1:26:04] word had absolute power and i pray if we
[1:26:06] can just grasp that today he says i've
[1:26:08] got a need but he sent his word
[1:26:11] amen to heal he sent his word to deliver
[1:26:14] you say well i don't know the answers to
[1:26:16] this problem you don't need to know the
[1:26:18] answer or how it's going to happen i
[1:26:20] mean here's the answer as long as you
[1:26:22] know
[1:26:23] the one who is the answer then then the
[1:26:25] answer will come
[1:26:27] because jesus is the answer to every
[1:26:28] question
[1:26:30] amen so this so this centurion
[1:26:33] recognized the supreme deity of jesus
[1:26:35] christ
[1:26:36] amen that's why that's why i said just
[1:26:38] but speak the word and my servant will
[1:26:40] live
[1:26:41] and that's why it's so important in the
[1:26:43] service are you reading the word
[1:26:44] listening to the mess say lord speak to
[1:26:45] me
[1:26:46] you know my need but speak to me release
[1:26:48] your word to me that becomes such a
[1:26:50] reality
[1:26:51] amen amen hallelujah
[1:26:54] and jesus had never seen faith like that
[1:26:56] in israel
[1:26:57] i mean more than more than dries more
[1:26:59] than anyone there he but that was
[1:27:01] gentile faith amen and that faith i
[1:27:05] believe is living in our hearts
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:10] amen he was he was demonstrating
[1:27:13] gentile faith
[1:27:15] and his attitude was right his attitude
[1:27:18] was that jesus had supreme authority or
[1:27:20] has his supreme authority over sickness
[1:27:23] and he believed and agreed what jesus
[1:27:25] said
[1:27:26] it's so important that we agree with the
[1:27:28] word you want you want the power of god
[1:27:30] to flow through your life agree with his
[1:27:32] word
[1:27:32] you don't agree you don't have to grab
[1:27:34] my humanity but agree with his word
[1:27:36] right i agree with his word
[1:27:38] amen because it says in in romans 8 and
[1:27:41] 16 that the spirit itself beareth
[1:27:43] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:27:46] children of god
[1:27:48] so now if your spirit bears witness with
[1:27:50] him there's an agreement
[1:27:52] right
[1:27:53] and and and that declares that you're a
[1:27:56] child of god so there's something in
[1:27:57] your spirit that doesn't agree with the
[1:27:59] word you've got the wrong spirit
[1:28:01] right because that that bearing witness
[1:28:03] is if you truly have the holy ghost
[1:28:05] you'll say amen to every word
[1:28:07] irrespective of it makes you happy sad
[1:28:09] or glad or mad or
[1:28:11] whatever whatever it does
[1:28:13] you know it might tear strips off your
[1:28:14] back it may shake you tip you up and
[1:28:16] shake you upside down yeah but you'll
[1:28:18] say amen
[1:28:19] right if you've got the right spirit but
[1:28:22] if you don't have the right spirit then
[1:28:23] you'll kick against it but the reason
[1:28:25] but but the only way you can have the
[1:28:26] right spirit is if you have the holy
[1:28:28] spirit within you
[1:28:29] right remember our devil will never say
[1:28:31] amen to the word
[1:28:33] he'll never say preach it in glory and
[1:28:35] hallelujah i'm so glad no
[1:28:37] a demon spirit will never say that if i
[1:28:39] said no that's not true it's not for you
[1:28:41] it cannot be so that's not right no
[1:28:43] that's for another age that's an unclean
[1:28:45] spirit speaking there but the spirit of
[1:28:47] god will say amen
[1:28:49] remember it's not just no it's not just
[1:28:51] anointed preaching it's anointed it's
[1:28:53] anointed pews
[1:28:54] i mean there's not just anointed worship
[1:28:56] man there's a noise that worship is
[1:28:57] everywhere i mean we're all part of this
[1:28:59] together we all come and create an
[1:29:01] atmosphere
[1:29:02] hallelujah
[1:29:04] amen just like you know the girls have
[1:29:05] been on the word sometimes and gabe's
[1:29:07] i'm like you know you know this lilian
[1:29:09] and and i'll say gabe just be a
[1:29:10] worshiper in the pew that's more
[1:29:11] important
[1:29:12] let's create an atmosphere hey little
[1:29:14] girls can create atmospheres
[1:29:16] they can they can change your whole
[1:29:18] world zone raise their hands and praise
[1:29:20] god and spirit of god can fall upon you
[1:29:22] amen so we're not just here to sing this
[1:29:23] is not singing
[1:29:25] this is worship
[1:29:26] giving a spiritual sacrifice to god and
[1:29:28] god come down and inhabit our praise and
[1:29:30] break the yoke of the enemy and change
[1:29:32] lives
[1:29:33] hallelujah so
[1:29:35] our spirit must bear witness with his
[1:29:39] lord amen that we are the children of
[1:29:40] god so if something and he disagrees
[1:29:42] with the word you have the wrong spirit
[1:29:44] that's just as plain as i can say it now
[1:29:46] brother braham says in the interval he
[1:29:47] says oh man what's the matter with you
[1:29:49] if you're a child of god your spirit
[1:29:50] will say god's word is right and you'll
[1:29:53] live that kind of a life to back it up
[1:29:55] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[1:29:57] that believe that's right and my name i
[1:29:58] shall cast out devil so forth and heal
[1:30:00] the sick and do things today you say
[1:30:02] them days of miracles is past look where
[1:30:04] you're living
[1:30:05] there you are don't take an intellectual
[1:30:07] take an experience with god
[1:30:09] when your experience agrees with this
[1:30:11] bible and every word is true your
[1:30:13] jehovah my spirit bearing record with
[1:30:15] his spirit yours we're sons and
[1:30:17] daughters of god and we've passed from
[1:30:19] death unto life
[1:30:20] it's true
[1:30:22] amen someone can say something to you
[1:30:24] real harshly you know just take
[1:30:28] the truth of what they're saying
[1:30:31] right if there's truth in there take it
[1:30:33] on board sometimes we've got to really
[1:30:35] sift through it but if there's truth in
[1:30:36] there take it on board
[1:30:38] right don't just throw the whole thing
[1:30:39] away because you didn't appreciate how
[1:30:41] we said sure we could we should say
[1:30:42] things in love so don't get me wrong
[1:30:45] but you got you want to take the truth
[1:30:46] out of whatever it says
[1:30:48] right that's what we're going to do amen
[1:30:50] now
[1:30:52] we live in an hour where the full word
[1:30:54] has come into manifestation
[1:30:55] right this is this is not alien to us
[1:30:57] right when christ opened the seals open
[1:31:00] the book of redemption brother ram says
[1:31:03] in the breach he says you know you know
[1:31:05] he's reading the portion where he says
[1:31:06] you know a strong eye um angel cried
[1:31:08] who's worthy to open the book
[1:31:10] and brother says maybe i'm just feeling
[1:31:12] this way but let him come forth now
[1:31:14] and open the book so it was an event
[1:31:16] those sermons were actually an event
[1:31:17] taking place he said i was praying all
[1:31:20] day and then he came to me in the room
[1:31:21] he says i was you know came with the
[1:31:23] understanding i was about to come with
[1:31:24] the understanding i had then he came
[1:31:26] into the room and actually showed me
[1:31:27] what it was
[1:31:28] right so now what's happening now is as
[1:31:31] that book is actually christ being
[1:31:32] revealed
[1:31:34] right everything it was everything adam
[1:31:35] lost is now coming to
[1:31:37] the possession of the believer
[1:31:39] so it's christ being may be made known
[1:31:41] brother it said that the opening of
[1:31:43] those seals is revealing christ
[1:31:45] right so now when the word comes open
[1:31:47] there's a power released through that
[1:31:49] word
[1:31:50] right but the amount of word that's open
[1:31:52] gives a certain amount of power now we
[1:31:54] read there in hebrews 1 that he upholds
[1:31:58] all things by the word of his power
[1:32:00] that's verse three
[1:32:02] so it says the word of his power not the
[1:32:04] power of his word the word of his power
[1:32:07] so when his word is released there's a
[1:32:09] power associated with that word so now
[1:32:11] for example
[1:32:12] moses moses brought the law that was a
[1:32:15] part of the word it was only under the
[1:32:17] blood of bulls and goats so there was
[1:32:18] not a power in there to transform a
[1:32:20] heart from unbelief to faith
[1:32:23] right it could not change it could not
[1:32:25] take sin nature out
[1:32:27] but it gave them overcoming power if
[1:32:29] they stayed with it to defeat their
[1:32:30] enemies
[1:32:31] right so there was a certain amount of
[1:32:33] power in it that's why david was
[1:32:35] anointed he could kill a lion a bear and
[1:32:36] goliath that's why the mighty men who
[1:32:38] gave themselves to david did the
[1:32:40] exploits they did it was supernatural
[1:32:42] things
[1:32:43] right because there was power with that
[1:32:44] word but there wasn't a full measure
[1:32:47] you know because it was just one under
[1:32:49] the blood of bulls and ghosts and two it
[1:32:50] was just a portion of the word
[1:32:53] right now we can go through the prophets
[1:32:55] and show that but let's just go all the
[1:32:56] way down now when jesus came he was the
[1:32:58] fullness of the word
[1:32:59] right so so in him
[1:33:01] he you know he breathed on the disciples
[1:33:03] said receive you the holy ghost so now
[1:33:05] the one that was prophesied of coming in
[1:33:07] the ultimate god indwelling a people
[1:33:10] right he's saying now now you can
[1:33:12] receive it because his blood was shed
[1:33:14] right and then they went to the upper
[1:33:15] room and because he released the word
[1:33:18] you know full measure
[1:33:20] for that day
[1:33:21] right
[1:33:22] the power of god came into the people
[1:33:24] that they weren't just trying to adhere
[1:33:25] to a law but never being able to live it
[1:33:28] but that god would come into a people
[1:33:30] and then his life in them would actually
[1:33:32] fulfill the law
[1:33:33] right so they did not just have to say
[1:33:35] you know it wasn't in their mind oh i
[1:33:37] shall not covet lord help me not to
[1:33:39] covet you know
[1:33:40] oh but my neighbor's got this and you
[1:33:41] know because in the law
[1:33:43] they were told thou shall not but they
[1:33:45] didn't have a power and ability to
[1:33:47] actually fulfill it because they were
[1:33:49] fallen man still even though they were
[1:33:50] god's chosen people but now when the
[1:33:53] spirit of god came in
[1:33:54] on the day of pentecost then god came in
[1:33:57] and then there's a thou shall not covet
[1:33:59] well that's gone out of them
[1:34:02] right if they say surrender to the holy
[1:34:04] ghost within them then there's no
[1:34:05] coveting
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:08] right you see there was a power there
[1:34:09] but the thing is god knew
[1:34:11] that the church would go from a quick
[1:34:14] manifestation of maturity in the book of
[1:34:16] acts and eventually it would die and go
[1:34:18] down to the dark ages to to come forth
[1:34:20] again right there had to be a death
[1:34:22] burial resurrection of the church itself
[1:34:24] as jesus would say you know when the
[1:34:26] greeks came said sirs we would see jesus
[1:34:28] and jesus would say well unless a corn
[1:34:30] of wheat dies goes into the ground and
[1:34:32] dies it'll abide alone if it comes forth
[1:34:34] it'll bring forth much fruit so so they
[1:34:37] were like confused because they wanted
[1:34:38] to see god and and and this is the
[1:34:40] answer they got but but they they were
[1:34:43] being told he was he was telling them
[1:34:45] that unless actually i go to calvary i
[1:34:49] die and i come forth again then my life
[1:34:51] comes into you you'll never see god
[1:34:53] because it takes god to come in for you
[1:34:55] actually to see him hallelujah right
[1:34:58] because because jesus said the world
[1:34:59] seeth me no more but you shall see me
[1:35:02] right so the world does not see him but
[1:35:04] the believer shall see him and that's
[1:35:06] why people on the street say where is
[1:35:07] jesus we say well we see him
[1:35:10] right because he's in us he's working us
[1:35:11] he's fulfilling his word he's gathering
[1:35:13] a people we see jesus i trust when you
[1:35:15] look at one another you say i see jesus
[1:35:18] right i see his word we can discern the
[1:35:20] lord's body and say i see jesus
[1:35:23] amen so now
[1:35:24] and then and then even the name of the
[1:35:26] first age of of ephesus and the greek it
[1:35:29] means to aim at and to relax
[1:35:31] so they aimed at the high calling in
[1:35:33] christ you read um
[1:35:35] ephesians 4 we won't go into it now but
[1:35:38] but but the apostle paul was saying he
[1:35:39] gave the five-fold ministry till we all
[1:35:41] come to the fullness of the statue of
[1:35:42] christ this is this is chapter 11. so
[1:35:44] he's saying he's saying in chapter one
[1:35:46] you've received the holy ghost you know
[1:35:48] you've been born again but we're going
[1:35:49] to grow
[1:35:51] we're to be perfected not
[1:35:53] not a sinless perfection but a maturity
[1:35:56] right because the blood perfects us sin
[1:35:58] what we're sinless say
[1:36:02] he became me that i become him by his
[1:36:04] grace so he became sin who knew no sin
[1:36:06] that i become the righteousness of god
[1:36:08] through christ that's scripture right so
[1:36:10] we're going to believe that amen we
[1:36:11] should walk you know it should be our
[1:36:13] living testimony
[1:36:14] he became me that i become him
[1:36:17] praise god the thing is so so so they
[1:36:20] aimed at the high calling but then they
[1:36:21] relax so so then and then even even when
[1:36:24] the church ages started you read there
[1:36:26] in uh revelations too am i going too far
[1:36:29] shall i go down to second gear
[1:36:31] are we going to go up the hill
[1:36:32] let's keep going okay so in in
[1:36:35] revelations 2 it says but remember from
[1:36:37] where you have fallen speaking of the
[1:36:39] ephesian age they had already fallen
[1:36:41] from their first love
[1:36:43] right and what caused the fall is that
[1:36:45] the pharisees came in like i said in
[1:36:47] acts 15 they said they're christians but
[1:36:50] they're not they brought contention
[1:36:51] among the church and instead of the
[1:36:53] believers actually overcoming that and
[1:36:55] staying in their first love it dragged
[1:36:57] them down
[1:36:59] that's why we should never let arguments
[1:37:01] and fussing and fighting drag us down
[1:37:02] from our first love
[1:37:04] right those things will come do you
[1:37:06] think the devil wants us to walk in joy
[1:37:08] the devil wants no one happy that's why
[1:37:10] there's a mental health crisis in this
[1:37:12] world he does not want anyone happy he
[1:37:14] wants them broken discontented trying to
[1:37:17] live in some fantasy world to escape
[1:37:18] reality but god wants us to be happy
[1:37:22] he wants happy christians
[1:37:25] amen amen that's what he wants he wants
[1:37:27] us to be happy
[1:37:28] that doesn't mean we'll we won't have
[1:37:29] trouble but he wants you to be happy
[1:37:32] praise god
[1:37:33] i'm glad aren't you glad
[1:37:35] you know so to be all like isolated and
[1:37:37] all like tense and stuff that's not
[1:37:38] being spiritual
[1:37:40] no but to have joy of the lord and to be
[1:37:42] able to walk among anyone and and still
[1:37:45] know who you are and be a living witness
[1:37:47] that's that's actually being spiritual
[1:37:50] jesus did not get all funny and you know
[1:37:52] isolated and things at all it's more
[1:37:53] spiritual to be a wife no no he went
[1:37:55] among everyone
[1:37:57] but it didn't rub off on him he rubbed
[1:37:58] off on them
[1:38:00] see so we've got to rub off on everyone
[1:38:02] don't let them rub off on you
[1:38:04] amen
[1:38:06] praise the lord so so so the church went
[1:38:09] down into a dark age we know that the
[1:38:11] truth was literally locked locked away
[1:38:14] in the catholic church you know that
[1:38:15] couldn't read the bible nothing but then
[1:38:17] they but then the uh revel uh
[1:38:19] reformation started to come because
[1:38:21] there's a resurrection coming forth
[1:38:23] now
[1:38:25] and then finally we've come to this age
[1:38:26] i'm just going to jump ahead a bit but
[1:38:28] you see that's when
[1:38:29] the uh in the philadelphian age which is
[1:38:32] the age before this one there's an open
[1:38:33] door
[1:38:34] opening of revelation to give the church
[1:38:36] strength
[1:38:37] right so now there's a restoration of
[1:38:39] the gifts but then god had to restore
[1:38:41] his word to bring a full strength into
[1:38:43] the church
[1:38:44] right that's why he said elijah at the
[1:38:46] end time that we would not just continue
[1:38:48] the cycle of revival and death
[1:38:51] why because you look through church
[1:38:52] history you see church history with the
[1:38:54] book of judges it's basically the same
[1:38:55] thing they come and possess the land
[1:38:57] then they fall into idolatry it's a
[1:38:59] cycle and then and then and they call
[1:39:01] out to god god sends a revival and then
[1:39:03] they walk in victory again but then they
[1:39:05] fall into idolatry again and then the
[1:39:07] cycle repeats it's a cycle of revival
[1:39:10] and death
[1:39:11] but now there had to come a word that
[1:39:12] would bring a power that would break
[1:39:14] that cycle
[1:39:16] right that it wouldn't just perpetuate
[1:39:17] that it's the all right praise the lord
[1:39:19] we're having a revival then we go down
[1:39:20] to death then we organize no god
[1:39:22] ordained that the cycle would be broken
[1:39:25] and that's why
[1:39:26] that's why in revelations 10 when when
[1:39:29] when when the seven thunders uttered
[1:39:31] their voices john was about to write but
[1:39:34] he was sold right at not it's sealed to
[1:39:35] the time of the end yeah right so in
[1:39:37] those seven thunders is a power to break
[1:39:40] that cycle of revival and death that we
[1:39:43] wouldn't just come back to the ephesian
[1:39:45] age again and aim at but relax
[1:39:48] right but we would aim it and become
[1:39:51] right because remember we can only live
[1:39:52] by the anointing that is here that's why
[1:39:55] the martyrs in the dark ages they are
[1:39:56] anointed to give their lives that's all
[1:39:58] they could do
[1:39:59] right they gladly went to the arena or
[1:40:00] were tortured or saw an asunder a great
[1:40:02] horrible death but they are anointed it
[1:40:04] wasn't them physically saying out of
[1:40:06] stubbornness
[1:40:08] it wasn't human stubbornness that made
[1:40:10] them become martyrs no they were
[1:40:12] anointed under the ox sacrificial
[1:40:14] anointing of the holy ghost to give
[1:40:16] their lives
[1:40:17] right and then you come into the age of
[1:40:19] sardis with martin luther and things as
[1:40:21] the man man anointing great wisdom they
[1:40:24] translate the bible knew many different
[1:40:26] languages they were anointed to do that
[1:40:28] that's the only thing they could do they
[1:40:30] were anointed that way and then we're
[1:40:31] coming to this age now in this age we
[1:40:34] are not under the man age anointing
[1:40:36] we're under the eagle anointing amen
[1:40:39] right so now you can only live by the
[1:40:40] anointing that you're under
[1:40:42] right you are you can only live by that
[1:40:44] anointing so if you're under the eagle
[1:40:46] anointing you're lifted up above the
[1:40:50] things of this world
[1:40:51] you can see
[1:40:53] things for what they are
[1:40:55] what the other four the other three
[1:40:56] anointings of the lion the ox and the
[1:40:58] man they're all land-based creatures
[1:41:01] right the flying eagles the only one
[1:41:02] that actually get lift off and you can
[1:41:04] look further
[1:41:06] right so when something comes upon the
[1:41:08] land we don't get caught up in it
[1:41:11] right
[1:41:12] if it's if it's black lives matter
[1:41:14] coronavirus whatever conspiracy flat
[1:41:18] earth whatever's trended or trending we
[1:41:20] have an eagle anointing
[1:41:22] that lifts us up and we can see that
[1:41:24] thing and say
[1:41:26] that's just another distraction let's
[1:41:27] keep flying
[1:41:29] that's just another distraction that's
[1:41:30] not going to help me none that thing
[1:41:32] down there now let's just let's just go
[1:41:34] higher i want to go towards the sun
[1:41:36] i want to go towards the so when i want
[1:41:38] to go above the storm
[1:41:40] right because we're living in an age of
[1:41:41] so many distractions and voices but if
[1:41:44] you're really under the holy ghost in
[1:41:46] this age you'll be lifted up all above
[1:41:48] those things
[1:41:49] hallelujah so now john said don't don't
[1:41:52] write what the seven thunders say
[1:41:54] because it's for the time of the end
[1:41:56] then so the prophet comes malachi 4
[1:41:58] comes and he's given the commission to
[1:42:00] go and you know the seven seals are
[1:42:02] going to be opened and remember in
[1:42:04] revelation there is supernatural power
[1:42:06] released in revelation so when the seals
[1:42:08] come open which brother rams asks is
[1:42:11] that the seven thunders or not he says
[1:42:13] no i mean he says yes it's the
[1:42:14] revelation of the seven thunders is the
[1:42:16] seals
[1:42:17] right so through that ministry god
[1:42:20] released a power upon the earth that
[1:42:22] there be a people now that would break
[1:42:25] the cycle of revival and death
[1:42:28] they wouldn't just have revival and die
[1:42:30] and get cold lukewarm formal and
[1:42:32] powerless but they would stay in revival
[1:42:35] until god takes them home hallelujah and
[1:42:38] we're living in that hour right now i'm
[1:42:40] saying this is not coming this is here i
[1:42:42] mean when the when this message found
[1:42:43] you supernaturally god was releasing a
[1:42:46] power into your life to break the cycle
[1:42:48] of revival and death i mean that you
[1:42:50] will stay in revival you will not go
[1:42:52] down unto death i mean nothing the devil
[1:42:55] does against you no no argument no
[1:42:57] fussing no fighting no stewing no
[1:42:59] trouble will drag you down
[1:43:02] back to where it wants to drag you down
[1:43:03] because that's what causes death as
[1:43:06] fussing and fighting and fractions and
[1:43:08] walls and trouble and whatever more no
[1:43:10] we're anointed not to do that
[1:43:14] hallelujah we're anointed to go beyond
[1:43:16] that that we can actually stay in
[1:43:18] revival remember you can only live by
[1:43:20] the anointing you're under
[1:43:22] this is not us saying i'm sick of that
[1:43:24] time we're going to have a different
[1:43:25] season no this is god saying this
[1:43:27] there is power in the open world
[1:43:30] to cause us that the cycle of revival
[1:43:33] and death will be broken
[1:43:36] amen some people told me a while
[1:43:39] ten years ago this will just last three
[1:43:40] years
[1:43:42] three and a half years i said no no it's
[1:43:44] burning on
[1:43:45] it's burning off because we don't have a
[1:43:47] man-made tank of oil man-made tank of
[1:43:50] natural ability and just enthusiasm we
[1:43:53] are connected to the great gusher of the
[1:43:55] holy ghost oil himself and he's pouring
[1:43:58] through every member giving illumination
[1:44:00] of the word and every heart and it's not
[1:44:03] going to stop
[1:44:05] amen it cannot stop because it's god
[1:44:08] that means that's why i say that in this
[1:44:10] hour every power and principality i
[1:44:12] didn't even touch it but we'll get to it
[1:44:14] maybe later every power and principality
[1:44:16] in heavenly places having me has been
[1:44:18] made known through the church
[1:44:21] because we're living in a season of
[1:44:23] revival not jesus death what is revival
[1:44:26] when an awakening to who you are
[1:44:29] right it's an awakening do you realize
[1:44:31] who you are not what you will not what
[1:44:34] you know
[1:44:35] it's who you are not who you were
[1:44:38] when you realize who you are it changes
[1:44:40] your thinking oh yes right yeah yeah i'm
[1:44:43] sure my dad will see this i love him but
[1:44:44] you know
[1:44:45] we're dna tests he had a dna test done
[1:44:48] now he's from south africa i share this
[1:44:50] with the youth you know he's from south
[1:44:51] africa he's from cape town he always
[1:44:52] said growing up we're english
[1:44:54] you know even though he can trace part
[1:44:56] of his forebears back to the original
[1:44:58] dutch settler families in the cape and
[1:44:59] different things and he's no no we're
[1:45:01] english he gets a dna test he has no
[1:45:03] english blood in him at all
[1:45:05] sure he's got irish scottish and welsh
[1:45:07] but in the uk that's a very different
[1:45:09] thing to english
[1:45:10] you know we may think it's all the same
[1:45:11] but no no it ain't the same
[1:45:13] but he's mainly scandinavian he's got
[1:45:15] jewish the balkans he's got a bitter
[1:45:16] asian a bit of indian enemies got all
[1:45:18] kinds of things
[1:45:20] but when he got that dna results back
[1:45:22] the results of his i could say well his
[1:45:24] dna
[1:45:25] it made him think differently about
[1:45:27] himself
[1:45:29] right so now we can think about
[1:45:31] ourselves one way but then when the test
[1:45:34] comes back
[1:45:35] what we begin to think about ourselves
[1:45:38] very differently
[1:45:39] hallelujah it's like you know there's
[1:45:40] been people who've been neo-nazis in
[1:45:42] germany they find out they're jewish
[1:45:44] they become jewish
[1:45:46] right so their environment conditioned
[1:45:48] them to be neo-nazis
[1:45:50] but then they got a test done
[1:45:52] they got a test and say actually in my
[1:45:54] veins is jewish blood and then so their
[1:45:57] identity they always were jewish but an
[1:45:59] awakening had to happen for them to
[1:46:01] realize i'm actually i'm a jew i'm not a
[1:46:03] neo-nazi right so it's the same thing
[1:46:05] with you and i when the test comes back
[1:46:08] and you begin to realize that my dna now
[1:46:11] i'm not talking about this guy i'm
[1:46:12] talking about this guy
[1:46:14] right when you realize your true dna is
[1:46:16] not based on your lineage but your true
[1:46:19] dna is from heaven i mean it makes you
[1:46:21] begin to think differently about
[1:46:23] yourself and it makes you think
[1:46:24] differently about other people
[1:46:26] right because grace can only be extended
[1:46:28] if it's been received right you cannot
[1:46:31] give grace you cannot give forgiveness
[1:46:33] or pardon or anything unless you've
[1:46:35] received it but then when he when he
[1:46:37] gives you grace he opens your eyes as an
[1:46:40] awakening you're part of me you're from
[1:46:42] heaven so your whole mind changes
[1:46:46] it changes your thinking about the
[1:46:47] country you live in where world events
[1:46:49] are going changes you think about you it
[1:46:52] changed your thing about the devil
[1:46:54] because it once yeah it used to be once
[1:46:56] upon a time that he'd come and whisper
[1:46:57] in your ear and you'd just listen all
[1:46:59] day
[1:47:00] that was a it was a hands-free
[1:47:04] call all the day
[1:47:05] you know good
[1:47:07] know i'm unhappy i don't feel like this
[1:47:10] and there's a devil in your ear but then
[1:47:12] when but then god opens your eyes
[1:47:14] he said no satan you're not my boss
[1:47:18] depression is not my boss anxiety is not
[1:47:20] my boss you know whatever it may be
[1:47:22] depression suicide anxiety trouble
[1:47:25] stress
[1:47:26] none of those things are my boss
[1:47:28] because the test came back
[1:47:30] and i'm from somewhere else and you're
[1:47:33] ordained because remember if you realize
[1:47:34] who you are then you realize who the
[1:47:36] enemy is
[1:47:37] right and you realize who your father is
[1:47:39] right so it's not just you realize who
[1:47:41] god isn't who you are you realize who
[1:47:42] the enemy is and his position right
[1:47:45] because if we've been elevated to be
[1:47:46] joining us with christ he's under your
[1:47:48] feet right but you've got to put him
[1:47:49] under your feet it's not just something
[1:47:51] that happens by us moses you've got to
[1:47:52] speak to your enemy you've got to
[1:47:54] address him and you've got to tell him
[1:47:56] where to go
[1:47:57] and not just please mr devil no you've
[1:47:59] got to command him because if we're
[1:48:01] under authority we have authority right
[1:48:03] in the authority of supreme deity which
[1:48:05] is jesus christ we have supreme
[1:48:06] authority not power but authority just
[1:48:09] like a policeman you can get the
[1:48:10] smallest policemen in existence
[1:48:13] right and they can be a scrawny thing
[1:48:15] you can basically just flick them over
[1:48:16] but when they put that badge on the head
[1:48:18] on and they you know they're in the
[1:48:19] uniform all
[1:48:21] of the state is behind them
[1:48:23] the authority of the state is behind
[1:48:25] them and if you go against their orders
[1:48:27] you can get arrested
[1:48:30] physically it doesn't matter their
[1:48:31] stature but the authority that they
[1:48:33] carry now we carry the authority of the
[1:48:35] badge of a believer
[1:48:37] right but we've got to actually put it
[1:48:38] into action
[1:48:40] we can't just sit back and say someone
[1:48:42] else will do it no you know there's a
[1:48:43] there's a um
[1:48:45] there's a uh what is it called
[1:48:48] whatever it's called it'll come to me
[1:48:49] maybe tomorrow but
[1:48:51] there's a yeah phenomena i'll put it
[1:48:53] that way it's a it's a human psychology
[1:48:55] thing
[1:48:56] that that if if someone comes across an
[1:48:59] accident and there's no one else around
[1:49:01] they will intervene
[1:49:03] you know some people maybe not but like
[1:49:05] vast majority will intervene but if
[1:49:06] there's a crowd there
[1:49:09] they will think someone else will take
[1:49:10] care of it
[1:49:12] that's actually a psychological thing
[1:49:15] now we can't be like that if the crowd's
[1:49:17] around
[1:49:18] we've got to be if we see a problem
[1:49:19] we've got to deal with it
[1:49:21] we can't say someone else will pray or
[1:49:22] someone else will do it no no we need to
[1:49:24] go before the throne of grace right we
[1:49:26] need to call one one one amen the real
[1:49:29] one one i'm talking about spiritual
[1:49:30] things now you understand so it's not
[1:49:32] just our brother so-and-so sister son so
[1:49:34] no what about you and i yeah
[1:49:36] what about us we can't just get under
[1:49:38] that conditioning someone else will pray
[1:49:39] or someone else or labor or no what
[1:49:41] about you and i yes lord there's a need
[1:49:44] if grace has been received then grace
[1:49:45] can be extended
[1:49:47] the powers of heaven can be extended
[1:49:50] to someone else i'm just going to close
[1:49:51] with that
[1:49:52] but
[1:49:53] i trust you've had the test
[1:49:56] what i trust he's revealed to you the
[1:49:58] results
[1:49:59] amen you come from god you go back to
[1:50:01] god
[1:50:02] hallelujah the powers of god has been
[1:50:04] released in this age to break the cycle
[1:50:05] of revival and death
[1:50:07] that's why you know people come against
[1:50:09] the mess and say there's nothing to it i
[1:50:10] said hold on you've come too late
[1:50:12] i've seen him move
[1:50:14] i've seen him do incredible things i've
[1:50:16] seen him promise what he promised he
[1:50:17] would do it's not just it see it's no
[1:50:20] lie it's good to testify of what
[1:50:22] happened in brother brown's life with
[1:50:23] jesus christ but really in reality we
[1:50:26] don't even
[1:50:27] don't get me wrong
[1:50:28] we have our own testimony
[1:50:31] we have our own testimony it's good to
[1:50:32] relate his testimonies we should but it
[1:50:34] but it's not just well god lived back
[1:50:36] there now where has he gone i don't know
[1:50:37] we're waiting for him to come no that
[1:50:39] same god lives here that same god
[1:50:41] manifests his word here in our lives
[1:50:44] right real handship is actually a
[1:50:46] personal wait this just
[1:50:48] we have the sorry hallelujah i just i'm
[1:50:50] about to close he says now therefore
[1:50:52] it's the word see egypt is the word
[1:50:54] right now
[1:50:56] say he the word how do you know it's
[1:50:57] right he the word is vindicated he the
[1:51:00] word properly vindicated as the headship
[1:51:02] the headship of the church his word is
[1:51:04] the headship he is
[1:51:06] probably identified vindicated by his
[1:51:09] own spirit being in the church itself
[1:51:10] the person showing for themself and
[1:51:12] vindication is a direct proof to the
[1:51:14] entire body you don't need creeds then
[1:51:16] denominations has perished but the
[1:51:18] headship itself recognized in the body
[1:51:21] by personal identification see
[1:51:23] identifying themselves proves the
[1:51:25] headship to the body then we are united
[1:51:28] under one vindicated headship which is
[1:51:30] christ the word of god not under a
[1:51:33] church what is personal uh vindications
[1:51:36] or personal identifications is when he
[1:51:38] reveals his word to you and it lives
[1:51:40] glory right that's a personal
[1:51:43] vindication
[1:51:44] right so that's the proof
[1:51:46] that you're under the headship of the
[1:51:47] word as one your spirit bears witness
[1:51:50] completely with it
[1:51:52] right and you see his word living out of
[1:51:54] you
[1:51:55] he proves his word in your life
[1:51:57] right
[1:51:58] and maybe we'll go into that next time
[1:51:59] but um can the musicians come this
[1:52:02] morning
[1:52:03] i think we can rejoice
[1:52:05] amen we're not just looking for god to
[1:52:07] do something he's doing a lot
[1:52:09] i mean he's pouring himself out changing
[1:52:11] our lives
