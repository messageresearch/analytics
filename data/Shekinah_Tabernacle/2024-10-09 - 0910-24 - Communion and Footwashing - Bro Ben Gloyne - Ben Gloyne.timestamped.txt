[23:06] great to have everyone here amen Let's
[23:09] uh let's just turn into the scripture
[23:10] sorry I don't have a slideshow I thought
[23:12] I made one but evidently no so um let's
[23:16] go to Exodus chapter 12 I want to
[23:18] continue I want to speak about applying
[23:20] the
[23:21] token which um which is really where I
[23:25] should have got
[23:26] to uh on Sunday but any who so Exodus 12
[23:30] I'm going to read just 21 and 22 and
[23:33] then we're going to as a context we're
[23:34] going to go to Esther chapter 7 and so
[23:37] let's just read Exodus 12 and 21 and
[23:41] 22
[23:43] um I can find it
[23:46] here and it says here then then Moses
[23:49] called for all the Elders of Israel and
[23:51] said unto them draw out and take your
[23:53] lamb according to your families and kill
[23:55] the Passover and you shall take a bunch
[23:57] of hsip and dip it in the blood that is
[23:59] in the Basin and strike the lentil and
[24:00] the two side posts with the blood that
[24:02] is in the Basin and none of you shall go
[24:05] out uh at the door of his house until
[24:08] the morning amen and then we're going to
[24:11] go to uh uh Esther chapter 7 and and
[24:14] verse one just as a bit of a um context
[24:22] here so Easter Easter 7 and one
[24:30] and this is just the context he says so
[24:31] the king is there all there he says so
[24:34] the king and hmon came to came to
[24:37] banquet with Esther the queen remember
[24:38] Queen Esther invited them to this
[24:40] banquet and the King said again unto
[24:42] Esther on the second day of the banquet
[24:44] of wine what is thy petition Queen
[24:46] Esther and it shall be granted then and
[24:48] what is thy request and it shall be
[24:49] performed even to half of the Kingdom
[24:52] yeah to half the kingdom then Esther the
[24:53] queen answered and said if I have found
[24:55] favor in thy sight oh King and if it
[24:57] pleased the king let my life be given uh
[25:00] let my life be given me at my petition
[25:02] and my people at my request for we are
[25:04] sold I and my people to be destroyed to
[25:07] be slain and to perish but if we have
[25:09] been sold for Bond men and Bond woman I
[25:12] had held my tongue although the enemy
[25:15] could uh not countervail the king's
[25:17] damage then the king of hazaras answered
[25:19] and said unto Esther the queen who is he
[25:22] and where is he that does presume in his
[25:24] heart to do so and isther said the
[25:27] adversary and in enemy is this wicked
[25:29] hmon then hmon was afraid before the
[25:31] king and the queen and the King arising
[25:34] from the banquet of wine and his wrath
[25:36] went into the palace garden and hmon
[25:39] stood up to make requests for his life
[25:41] to Esther the queen for he saw that
[25:43] there was evil determined against him by
[25:45] the king then the king returned out of
[25:47] the palace Garden into the place of the
[25:49] banquet of the wine and hmon was Fallen
[25:51] upon the bed where where on Esther was
[25:54] then said the king will he Force the
[25:55] queen also before me in the house as the
[25:57] word went out of the king's mouth they
[25:59] covered Hon's face and habon one of the
[26:02] chamber I mean yeah chamber said before
[26:05] the king behold also the Gallow 50
[26:08] cubits High which hmon had had made for
[26:11] Mori who had spoken good for the king
[26:14] standeth in the house of hmon then the
[26:16] king said hang him thereon so they
[26:18] hanged hmon on The Gallows that he
[26:20] prepared for morai then was the king's
[26:23] wrath
[26:24] pacified praise God Amen so let's bow
[26:26] heads in a word of prayer this night
[26:29] amen Lord Jesus thank you Lord truly
[26:30] there's none like thee Lord there's
[26:32] nothing no one anywhere comp pi to Lord
[26:35] who you are and the promise we have in
[26:37] you and father as we approach your
[26:39] communion table Lord I pray you prepare
[26:40] our hearts father Lord we just commit
[26:42] Our Lives completely into your hands
[26:44] once again we ask you to forgive us of
[26:45] our wrongs our sins our iniquities Lord
[26:47] cover us in your blood Lord father I
[26:49] pray this would be a very special
[26:51] communion night for each and every one
[26:52] of us Lord and I pray you'd bless the
[26:54] reading of your word which we have just
[26:55] read Lord For Your Glory in Jesus
[26:57] Christ's name amen amen amen God bless
[27:00] you friends you can have your seats
[27:01] tonight so I want to I want to speak
[27:05] about applying the token now we know
[27:06] brother Braham he speaks about apply the
[27:08] token with your prayer who's you know
[27:11] anyone who's heard the message the token
[27:12] or anything you brother BR makes these
[27:14] statements you got to apply present your
[27:16] token with your prayer now we know this
[27:18] is not a a just a phrase you say as you
[27:21] pray but the token we know is the Holy
[27:23] Ghost and so to apply the token is to
[27:26] let God take over your life and the
[27:28] situation you're in because if we look
[27:30] at uh where we read there in Exodus the
[27:33] Israelites had two options they could
[27:35] either apply the blood and be safe under
[27:37] the blood because when the blood when
[27:39] the lamb was killed and when the when
[27:41] the blood was applied to the house they
[27:43] were actually giving preeminence to the
[27:45] lamb in their home the lamb was number
[27:47] one he was the head of the home and when
[27:49] they applied the blood the saving power
[27:51] and delivering power and protecting
[27:53] power in that blood of the Lamb came
[27:55] into manifestation so they did not have
[27:57] to do anything else but to apply the
[28:00] blood that's all they needed to do now
[28:02] so there was two options one they could
[28:04] they could apply the blood and let off
[28:06] the pressure and let the blood do the
[28:08] work they could do that or they could
[28:11] stand on the outside of the house and
[28:12] say I'm going to defend my house from
[28:14] the death angel cuz I'm a I'm a
[28:16] circumcised Covenant
[28:19] Jew one would have died and the other
[28:21] would have lived the one who tried to
[28:24] protect the house in their own strength
[28:25] would have died right because they came
[28:27] out from outside the blood those who are
[28:30] under the blood were safe and this is
[28:32] what happens with Believers
[28:34] unfortunately is what happens is people
[28:36] try and protect their house in their own
[28:37] strength have they prayed long enough
[28:40] have they been dilatory enough have they
[28:42] done what they required to do in their
[28:44] own strength and it tears people apart
[28:48] because instead of trusting in the blood
[28:49] of the Lamb they're trusting in their
[28:51] own ability to keep living out of the
[28:53] home to keep the token applied and it's
[28:56] all about them have they prayed enough
[28:58] Have you listened enough have you read
[29:00] enough we all know the pressure that
[29:02] comes right but but but that's a
[29:03] humanistic pressure of human ability
[29:06] trying to keep the death angel away God
[29:09] never intended your ability to keep the
[29:11] death angel away God intended the blood
[29:13] of the Lamb to keep the death angel away
[29:16] that's why he said apply the blood Amen
[29:19] in the evening time so you have those
[29:21] two options now Jesus uh if I can find
[29:23] it he would he would rebuke the scribes
[29:26] and Pharisees speaking about how they
[29:28] they devour widow's houses let's see if
[29:30] I can find this here if my if my uh yeah
[29:34] Matthew Matthew 23 and4 he says W unto
[29:37] you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for
[29:39] you devour widow's houses and for a
[29:41] pretense which is a show make long
[29:43] prayer therefore you shall receive the
[29:45] greater damnation now to to devour a
[29:47] Widow's house we know he was Naturally
[29:50] Speaking of basically he devoured the
[29:51] Widow's house taking all the Widow had
[29:54] right so really it is what it is it's
[29:56] it's actually targeting the vulnerable
[29:58] able making them to do something instead
[30:01] of applying the blood cuz when something
[30:03] is devoured like have you ever see like
[30:05] a I mean you see a a pride of lions
[30:08] devour a wilderbeast or something it was
[30:10] a wilderbeast then it gets chewed up so
[30:13] what it was is not what it becomes it
[30:15] gets devoured right so what happens is
[30:17] when people try and they come under a a
[30:20] a Pharisee Spirit trying to in their own
[30:23] uh you know what do you call it
[30:25] sincerity trying to protect their house
[30:28] In Their Own Strength their Joy gets
[30:31] devoured their peace gets devoured their
[30:33] Victory gets devoured why because
[30:35] they've come under the wrong way of
[30:38] doing it but those who are under the
[30:40] blood amen doesn't mean You' stop
[30:42] praying doesn't mean you just become
[30:44] indifferent doesn't mean you become LAX
[30:46] but it's different when you pray under
[30:48] the blood than when you pray Through
[30:50] Your Own Strength because your own
[30:51] strength is you know I see a timer and I
[30:54] pray have I prayed long enough have I
[30:55] done this enough have I you know it
[30:57] turns into almost like like a Muslim
[30:58] kind of tradition of I got to pray five
[31:00] times a
[31:02] day prayer is not NE it can be long it
[31:04] can be short but the main thing is you
[31:06] touch Heaven amen right because remember
[31:09] prayer is a mighty weapon I think you
[31:11] it's a it's a lyric from um I can't
[31:13] remember her name but she wrote the song
[31:14] it'll take a stronger wi than this right
[31:16] and and and prayer is a mighty weapon
[31:18] but it puts God in control so real
[31:21] prayer puts God in control of your
[31:23] situation amen amen because really
[31:26] prayer is Lord change my mind to match
[31:29] your mind in the Battle of in that's
[31:32] right and you and you let God take
[31:34] control so when you're applying the
[31:35] token you're praying in faith committing
[31:38] the whole situation into the Lord's
[31:40] control because remember when they
[31:42] killed the lamb the lamb became the head
[31:44] of the house the lamb the blood had
[31:46] preeminence right amen so this is this
[31:49] is really what applying the token means
[31:50] is you let you let the Holy Ghost take
[31:53] over your battle amen amen it's I mean
[31:56] it's very it's very it's very uh
[32:00] straightforward but you can either do it
[32:01] in your own strength and be devoured or
[32:04] you can trust the blood and let off the
[32:05] pressure and rejoice amen right you can
[32:08] either be under the token of the Holy
[32:09] Ghost Rejoice or you can be
[32:11] devoured busting apart because it's the
[32:14] the pressure is on you the pressure is
[32:16] not on me the pressure is on the lamb
[32:18] amen amen the blood's been applied the
[32:20] Holy Spirit abides amen hallelujah
[32:22] hallelujah so you can now trust now in
[32:24] his
[32:26] ability praise God H so we don't want to
[32:29] stand on the outside the door of our
[32:30] house to protect our family with our own
[32:33] strength I'm going to be dilator I'm
[32:35] going to be devel I'm going to be
[32:36] sincere we can be all those things but
[32:38] don't step outside the blood see we're
[32:40] not looking for the devil to fight
[32:42] that's right the devil come and fight
[32:44] you he'll become looking for you right
[32:46] but the thing is we don't I'm not on a
[32:48] mission humanly to uh storm
[32:50] hell because if I do anything in My Own
[32:53] Strength it's going to miserably fail
[32:55] right like brother bam uh makes a
[32:57] statement here and if I'm sorry I don't
[32:59] have it up here but um he says
[33:01] now he says he says um he so he's
[33:04] talking about a a a young ladies um come
[33:06] for prayer and and and he instructs her
[33:10] now just drive down a post right there
[33:12] in your mind on this platform tonight
[33:14] the prayer of faith was prayed for me
[33:16] and Satan the blood of the Lamb was put
[33:19] between me and you so you might as well
[33:22] go Hallelujah you can come up to that
[33:24] post and yeah but the thing is you here
[33:26] will come a sip uh them he says don't
[33:29] punch at it don't punch in it you punch
[33:31] a snake see you if you just keep saying
[33:34] I rebuke you I rebuke you he'll bite you
[33:36] see just ignore him walk away from him
[33:39] he's defeated anyhow there you are don't
[33:41] punch at him see oh and say oh the Lord
[33:44] rebuke him the Lord rebuke him h no no
[33:46] don't do that see you're weakening what
[33:48] you really believe by doing that right
[33:52] you got to realize when when when the
[33:53] prayer of faith is made right you got to
[33:56] put a steak down God you heard my prayer
[33:59] I'm under the token you hear my prayer
[34:02] it's done go on Victorious AML right but
[34:05] if you keep looking it because what
[34:07] happens is the devil wants you to keep
[34:09] rebuking him and that weakens what you
[34:12] really believe is because your focus
[34:14] goes from the one who brings Deliverance
[34:16] to the one who's tormenting you right so
[34:18] it actually makes the devil a lot bigger
[34:20] than what he really is ien so we've got
[34:22] to keep our focus on the blood of the
[34:24] lamb and not the enemy
[34:27] amen but people get you know I'm going
[34:29] to rebuke the devil I'm going to deal
[34:30] with them you know when you come under
[34:32] the anointing that's the time to speak
[34:35] amen because remember we read that there
[34:36] in um we read that there in ether
[34:39] because E before this banquet of wine
[34:42] she knew hmon had had had had caused a
[34:44] death sentence to be signed upon herself
[34:46] and her people but she was going to
[34:48] apply the token you see she was going to
[34:50] bring the king into her battle see she
[34:53] did not decide well are my servants I'm
[34:55] going to storm Hon's house and we're
[34:57] going to deal with with them she would
[34:58] have died she would have failed am mean
[35:01] Hon's guards would have wiped her out
[35:02] and wiped her servants out but what did
[35:04] she do she didn't humanly fight it but
[35:06] she came under the blood amen how did
[35:09] she come under the blood she called the
[35:10] token the king amen into the battle
[35:14] right she had a banquet of wine amen and
[35:16] that moved the heart of the king so what
[35:18] happened now the enemy was there she
[35:21] came in prayer to the king I'm just kind
[35:24] of bringing into our language right we
[35:25] know the story she invited hmon and to a
[35:28] banquet of wine right a banquet of wine
[35:30] we know is the stimulation of the
[35:31] revelation of the Holy Ghost right so
[35:34] when the spirit of God begins to move we
[35:35] begin to Rejoice maybe a song maybe a
[35:37] message maybe at church whatever you
[35:39] know and we get inspired we get in you
[35:41] know we begin to Rejoice God anchors
[35:43] Revelation our heart that's the time to
[35:45] speak to your enemy that's the time to
[35:47] talk to your king your token amen and
[35:50] and tell him what the enemy is doing in
[35:52] your life right so she applied the token
[35:55] by bringing the king into her battle
[35:57] amen and then the king said what's your
[35:59] request Esther so what's she doing she's
[36:01] not moving carnally now she's moving in
[36:03] the spirit right and now she speaks
[36:06] under the inspiration of what's needed
[36:07] for that moment saying this man yeah
[36:10] this wicked man hymon is against me he's
[36:13] trying to destroy me and you know
[36:15] destroy my people amen what' she do she
[36:19] applied the token right she did not try
[36:23] and do it in her own strength yeah you'd
[36:25] say of course that'd be ridiculous for
[36:27] to grab a sword and try and take out
[36:29] hmon himself but that's just as
[36:31] ridiculous as us humanly trying to
[36:33] protect our family you'll drive yourself
[36:36] mad yeah you will drive yourself mad if
[36:38] you're so you get so concerned about the
[36:40] age we live and our families and all
[36:42] these things don't don't go mad by it
[36:45] apply the token amen trust the
[36:48] protecting delivering power of the blood
[36:50] of the Lamb amen amen that he will he
[36:53] will intercede and he'll work on your
[36:55] behalf amen and he will take the battle
[36:58] under his control you say well what
[37:00] about here well that's nice for Esther
[37:02] what about here well I remember one
[37:04] prayer meeting a few years ago sister
[37:06] Vanessa replied the token and having
[37:09] prayer prayer meeting here you just here
[37:11] in the in you know in the house brother
[37:12] kabin wasn't even saved them what
[37:14] happened the presence of God came down
[37:16] she called out what was she doing
[37:18] claiming her family claiming her husband
[37:20] what was happening she was applying the
[37:22] token Hallelujah here he is and yubin
[37:26] praise the Lord
[37:28] Amen brother arand we know the story his
[37:30] parents came here the first time
[37:31] fighting with his dad and walked outside
[37:33] and he said God your Prophet said I can
[37:35] call you on a conference what was he
[37:37] doing he was applying the token by
[37:40] inviting God into the battle Hallelujah
[37:43] e I'm just going to use the just the
[37:45] different examples but the same thing
[37:46] because you'll see this is how you apply
[37:47] the token right so now what so so what
[37:50] did he do he he called God on the scene
[37:52] he was applying the token and we know
[37:54] the rest of the story God dealt with his
[37:56] parents they got baptized and before
[37:57] they flew back to South Africa you know
[38:00] they're they're different people today
[38:02] why because someone applied the token
[38:04] right and maybe didn't know the
[38:05] mechanics of it but the Dynamics is the
[38:07] important thing Hallelujah we know dve
[38:10] is not here tonight but what happened
[38:11] begin to apply the token the token the
[38:14] Holy Ghost begin to work through
[38:15] different parts of the body Hallelujah
[38:17] and he's been transformed by the Holy
[38:19] Ghost you know one day he said to his
[38:21] dad I'll never serve God what's he doing
[38:24] now serving God what happened the token
[38:26] was applied
[38:29] amen hallelujah you know brother Braham
[38:31] when he was grounded there he's flying
[38:33] and he's grounded at the airport in
[38:35] Memphis there's a there's a woman there
[38:38] and she and she's got a son who's on his
[38:40] deathbed what is she doing you know no
[38:43] doubt growing up you know she would say
[38:45] to him now come on you know come to
[38:47] church let's pray together she was
[38:49] living her life in front of him and
[38:50] brother Braham says here if I can find
[38:52] it he says now he says then you apply
[38:55] the token at wait he says get Ready
[38:57] Clean Up believe it let your children
[39:00] let your family let your loved ones see
[39:01] it in you that's right it'll take effect
[39:04] yes sir then applying the token in
[39:06] prayer with consideration with with
[39:08] believing apply it with such love and so
[39:10] forth till you know it's going to take
[39:12] it's it's going to take place that's all
[39:15] apply it in confidence believing it's
[39:17] going to help when you talk to that
[39:19] child when you talk to your husband when
[39:20] you talk to your wife you talk to this
[39:21] loved one believing it's going to help
[39:23] just stand there and say Lord I've
[39:25] claimed them they're mine I'm getting
[39:27] them for you Lord apply it and create
[39:29] that atmosphere around you that they'll
[39:32] just drop right into it oh you are you
[39:34] are if you've got the token you create a
[39:36] spirit around your of power that when
[39:38] you walk people know you're a Christian
[39:41] amen they love for you to say something
[39:42] to them they believe your word what you
[39:45] say they hold on to it see that's it see
[39:48] the token has a power it's the it's the
[39:50] presence of God himself in your life and
[39:53] when you walk around the world you go to
[39:55] your job you go to school you wherever
[39:57] you are people know there's a difference
[39:59] what's this guy's different she's
[40:01] different and it's more than how we
[40:03] dress there's a life amen that's on
[40:05] display Hallelujah and even it says in
[40:08] Timothy 3 it says not a novice L being
[40:10] lifted up with pride he fall into the
[40:12] condemnation of the devil moreover he
[40:14] must have a good report of them which
[40:16] are without least he fall into reproach
[40:18] and the snare of the devil so he must
[40:20] have a good report of them without amen
[40:23] so when people see you they see that's a
[40:25] Christian I may not agree with what they
[40:27] believe I might think they've gone off
[40:28] the deep end but that's a Christian how
[40:31] they conduct themselves what they do
[40:33] what they say their honesty Integrity
[40:34] all those things is a proof amen so so
[40:38] she no doubt was living a life in front
[40:41] of her son but the son went Wayward now
[40:43] it's amazing God will allow things it
[40:45] looks like things are going wrong but
[40:46] they're actually going
[40:48] right amen humanly we say man this is
[40:50] this is bad but God says no he's
[40:52] actually right on schedule she's right
[40:54] on schedule amen she's where I need her
[40:56] to be amen the thief on the cross he had
[40:58] to end up there he wasn't falsely
[41:01] charged and ended up there he he he was
[41:03] really a thief he really deserved he
[41:05] said we deserve to be here to the other
[41:06] Thief right so his life was actually
[41:09] programmed that way for him to end up
[41:10] there to see the lamb before amen the
[41:13] Lord Jesus gives us
[41:15] life so God knows what he's doing so you
[41:18] know no doubt she would have told him
[41:19] come on you know let's go to church
[41:21] let's pray together let's read the Bible
[41:22] and do the best she can at his mom but
[41:24] you know it seemed like he was just
[41:26] going the other Direction anyway but
[41:28] then but then she she she applied the
[41:31] token and so she brought God into the
[41:34] battle she brought God into the battle
[41:37] maybe it was when when when he was young
[41:39] started to call upon God that God would
[41:41] come on the scene but God answers in his
[41:43] time God answers in his time amen so you
[41:46] may appli the token years ago don't
[41:48] don't ever let it in your mind saying it
[41:50] hasn't taken effect it's not working God
[41:52] in his season he may let someone run a
[41:54] long time for many years but he'll get
[41:56] them am amen do we not believe that amen
[42:00] hallelujah so now she's she's praying
[42:03] and you know she prayed through
[42:05] Hallelujah she sees a vision of brother
[42:08] Brown walking down her Street in front
[42:10] of her house with a briefcase you know
[42:12] her suon he has no idea that's just
[42:15] taking place he's on a plane it's you
[42:16] it's grounded there at the airport you
[42:18] know he starts walking cuz you know
[42:20] there's a big delay or whatever and he
[42:22] leaves his briefcase here at the airport
[42:23] or wherever he's staying and you know
[42:25] he's just looking at a hunting uh shop
[42:27] he's he's window shopping you know then
[42:29] he hears a voice say keep

[42:34] walking it's a lot of miles apparently
[42:35] from where he heard the voice to where
[42:37] he ended up at her house but he just
[42:39] started walking what was happening
[42:41] because she applied the token Elijah was
[42:44] on her on his way amen because what
[42:47] happened is when she applied the token
[42:49] she identified herself in the scripture
[42:51] I'm that shite woman amen and then she's
[42:54] leaning there over the gate there's
[42:55] joing her back because before on she got
[42:58] that dream or that Vision she's waiting
[42:59] for it to be fulfilled she's waiting
[43:01] she's waiting and then he's walking down
[43:03] the street ends up in this colored
[43:04] District way from wherever he is but
[43:06] he's just following that voice and then
[43:08] and then and then you know he says good

[43:27] little shotgun Shanty but God was in
[43:29] that place and you know he be you know
[43:32] she be to Sor describe to brother Brown
[43:34] the situation CU her son was on the bed

[43:47] the shunamite woman in the Bible but
[43:48] where's my Elijah there he was right in
[43:51] front of her amen and then she and then

[43:55] you know she prayed first and he said
[43:58] you've you could tell he has she sorry
[44:01] has talked to the Lord before yeah amen
[44:04] and then brother Braham started to pray
[44:06] and then when he was praying Amen
[44:08] brother BR said he uh put his hands on
[44:10] the uh son's feet started praying for
[44:13] him and he started praying and then the
[44:14] boy was saying it's dark and he said
[44:16] it's getting lighter mama and he came to
[44:19] healthy normal and well years later he
[44:21] bumped into brother bumped into on a
[44:23] train station he said I'm not only
[44:24] healed I'm saved amen hallelujah what
[44:28] happened she applied the token in spite
[44:31] of what was going on she didn't let that
[44:34] make her burst because the pressure
[44:37] wasn't on her it was on her token
[44:39] Hallelujah it was on the Lord himself
[44:42] right so she did not she did not know
[44:44] the mechanics of it but she sure knew
[44:46] the Dynamics of
[44:49] it
[44:51] amen praise the Lord that's why we must
[44:54] present our token with our prayers which
[44:58] is that's why let the Lord take over
[45:01] your prayer
[45:02] life let him pray through you Amen Let
[45:05] Him inspire you What's happen then it's
[45:07] no longer you praying it's God praying
[45:09] amen hallelujah amen then we can stand
[45:13] with confidence saying Thank You Lord
[45:16] the answer is on its way or rather
[45:18] you've given the answer but it's going
[45:19] to come into manifestation the Lord amen
[45:22] I'm going to leave it there right but
[45:24] that's how that's applying the to you
[45:26] say I've been doing that for years good
[45:28] praise the Lord amen but you see what it
[45:31] is in summary amen you you let God take
[45:35] over your battle just like Esther
[45:37] did that's applying the token I know
[45:41] it's a simple thing but it's a powerful
[45:42] thing so you got two
[45:44] choices you can go outside and fight the
[45:46] death angel or you can stay under the
[45:49] blood trusting the power the saving
[45:52] delivering power of the blood of the
[45:53] Lamb what are you going to do I think
[45:56] I'll stay under the blood am cuz it
[46:00] works amen praise the Lord amen so let's
[46:04] turn to let's turn to 1 Corinthians 11
[46:07] shall we because I'm so thankful I still
[46:10] you know brother arand and I were
[46:11] talking as we were we were we were bring
[46:15] tonight this token Works am this message

[46:25] not an empty thing brother good many
[46:27] here sister Shannon one of those same
[46:29] prayer meetings called where's the god
[46:30] of Elijah that's right he brought she
[46:33] invited the Lord of hosts into her
[46:36] battle amen that works Hallelujah we are
[46:40] so many testimonies of the token coming
[46:42] and working God's delivering power the
[46:45] power of that token grabbing lives
[46:47] saving lives delivering lives amen so
[46:50] this this ain't a this a this ain't just
[46:53] a you know Pie in the Sky kind of deal
[46:55] this is it really does work
[46:57] and I'm so thankful you know we sing a
[47:00] song maybe we'll sing it um before we
[47:01] actually uh well after the communion or
[47:05] yo but yo the blood will never lose its
[47:07] power I mean we never ever have to come
[47:10] to a day where the blood just vanishes
[47:12] from our lives and we're going to go
[47:13] fight this battle in our own strength no
[47:15] the blood will never lose its power it
[47:17] doesn't matter what the what comes out
[47:19] of the pit of Hell it cannot conquer the
[47:21] blood of Jesus Christel amen Lord amen
[47:25] so let's go to First
[47:27] Corinthians amen and let's
[47:30] um let's let's go to verse 23 of uh 1
[47:35] Corinthians 11: 23 he says for I have
[47:38] received of the Lord that which also I
[47:41] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[47:43] the same night in which he was betrayed
[47:45] took bread and when he had given thanks
[47:47] he broke it and said take eat this is my
[47:49] body which is broken for you this do in
[47:51] remembrance of me after the same manner
[47:54] also he took the cup which he had s
[47:56] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[47:58] my blood this do you as often as you
[48:00] drink it in remembrance of me for as
[48:03] often as you drink this bread and eat
[48:05] sorry for as often as you eat this bread
[48:07] and drink this cup you do show the
[48:09] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[48:11] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[48:14] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[48:16] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[48:18] but let a man examine himself and so let
[48:20] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[48:22] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[48:24] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[48:26] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[48:29] body for this cause many are weak and
[48:31] sickly among you many sleep for if we
[48:33] would judge ourselves we should not be
[48:35] judged but when we are judged we sh we
[48:38] are chastened of the Lord and we that we
[48:41] should not be condemned with the world
[48:43] wherefore my brethren when you come
[48:45] together to eat t one for another and if
[48:47] any man hunger let him meat at home that
[48:49] you come not together unto condemnation
[48:51] and the rest will I set in order when I
[48:54] come so we want to examine ourselves
