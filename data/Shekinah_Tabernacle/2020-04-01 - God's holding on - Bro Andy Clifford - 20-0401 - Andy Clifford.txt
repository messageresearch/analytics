powerful song service brother PD really appreciate that and I had a really amazing time it's amazing you know what we can you know when we come together and we just step outside the box and think differently we can still have a glorious time mmm so yeah I just want to praise the Lord and very thankful for this opportunity to share the word amen and especially quite quite a quite a supernatural event to how the sermon came about and how the Lord orders things and yeah it was just the Lord about probably three weeks ago maybe three weeks ago one of the visiting ministers was preaching their belief and whatever some one of the thoughts was how God holds on to us and you know and I got inspiration too in the service and I wrote a song and I shared that song on the whatsapp - was she had something and I shared the song underneath it about how the Lord so glad you held me you know and the Lord has held us and will hold us and holds us through everything from before the world ever began from even in his mind he held us and we'll go through I'm going to explore that but anyway so I was just writing this song you know and like I was just playing it and thinking about the song and then Brahman on the day that I shared this song on the what set Raman brings in the family altar for that day I don't know what version it was but and it was the whole the whole quote was about how the Lord holds on and then and then I don't know what happened I think it was it might have been that Wednesday night and and then it was actually not meant to be me preaching and I didn't know this I haven't checked the roster but Benz is our brother and his preaching mix Luke answer honestly I didn't know but as I cook I was like man it must be this because then I that day it was that day before he said that I was just sitting in my lazy boy and I'm not lazy in the lazy boy but I was sitting at me and and I got I got inspiration with this song and I was like maybe because I was also going to minister to Pakistan and I didn't I was contemplating what to preach on and then when she brought that quota I just went maybe the law wants me to preach on how the Lord's help will hold on to us through everything and especially through this time of the pandemic and so I just I just started putting some notes down because I didn't hear very long I had about 10 minutes so I just started putting some notes down and the whole thing pretty much the whole discourse of what where we will go tonight came out straight away and I've just refined it a bit and put quotes in there and stuff you know to back up what I'm saying but the whole discourse everything just came out flowed out and then that night Ben Ben sees ie and I think brother hand is preaching next week on the Wednesday I was like man the Lord is ordering these things since I just wanted to share that testimony that hid the Lord is an image and I love you well I've never preached to you guys on on zoom' before I've done a lot of preaching on soon but if anyone feels like a meaning you can't in your microphone Amen because I like hearing a means I don't get and I don't get much of him from the via to me so I'll be nice to get some from from the local I don't think they know about a meaning over there but we'll teach them amen anyway I don't want to go any further because the with this so it's just this bow a hit and miss just remember to the Lord Father we are so grateful Lord that we can gather together here Lord Lord on the zoom and what I pray you bless the connection and I just want to add my amen to brother beans prayer that the anointing would be in every room and be a feeling it would be in every bedroom whoever wherever is listening and father I pray that you would bless each service in each home yes my car Lord there is an interaction happening all over this region right Aeneas Lee Lord where you're getting praise Lord it's spread over a wide bandwidth of geography Lord and and you're getting praise from a web of of Lights that a Lord situated here in the Wellington region and wherever else who may be tuned in' and I'm just so grateful Lord Jesus that that we can do this and I ask you bless the service will speak to us a nice I pray Lord that the burden of the word would be expressed people in Jesus Christ's name so as you probably already Minister honored called he held on amen and so we're just gonna and just before we and read the scripture from turning the future into Colossians 1 verse 17 you know we're being apprehended by by the son of men amen Jesus Christ is apprehending us and he's apprehended us and then he hops just some thoughts in before we read the scripture he holds creation together and then he holds the atoms together he holds churches together as hot he's hold marriages together I'm arguing he holds tomorrow he holds the past yes he holds the keys of death and hell and I knew in our heart and he holds prediction he holds him I mean we never need to worry fear have any sort of anxiety or anything at all in his hand just read from Colossians chapter 1 verse 17 and he is before all things and by him all things consist amen may the Lord bless us with even to sit together to introduce favorably to exhibit stand near and this is I want to focus a little bit on this a bit later to constitute and to you know elaborating on constitute nations have a constitution that holds them together as a foundation right and we have also been given a constitution and its constitution that the people fight so much because if we lose sight of our identity which is based in the constitution of heaven and what in our identification of our promised land then the devil we lose our identity and and that you end up becoming corrupted like those denominations and like the people of the world fights that but as will enter into it a little bit later the Lord has restored and holds the Constitution in his hand irin and he is in your hand but Christ in you institution man no man can pluck it out of your hand no has he a man and pluck you out of the of the Lord's hand that's right I'm pregnant bomb absolutely secure in providing your life has been completely surrendered and everything is laid out and you have been born again while the Holy Ghost yes revelation team chapter one speaks of the mighty angel come again this is the baptism of the Holy Ghost after 1963 so after 1963 when the Lord opened his seals and revealed himself the fullness of the Holy Ghost themself Christ and his fullness came down and those that get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this age receive him receiving justification they don't just receive a part or a partial but they receive everything the Lord of glory himself in his formation that's right and he's holding the Constitution in his hands and he is enforcing that the devil completely submits to all of the elements and articles of that Constitution and no matter what happens no matter where you go no matter how far you fell or where you came from the Lord will ensure and enforce that Constitution for you I want to read a quote from so on brother Branham says there is only one holds the future that's gone so he holds the future let him hold you amen very simple and very elementary but you see we often find ourselves trying to take control trying to administer from our own memories and affections and and our own ideas or or we have got walls up and sometimes we don't realize these walls are up as much as he holding you you have to allow them you have to allow them to hold and mold you without your mind getting in caught up in it right without you resisting the Lord and resist the devil I mean Amen that's right glory mmm now I want to read from Philippians chapter 3 we won't have time to turn to B so if you just want to if you can turn if you like but I'm just going to read that I may know him and the power of his resurrection Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death he means by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after Earth now focus and listen to this clearing that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus I mean here we find the pivotal thought of where we're going tonight that I may apprehend that well which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus I mean man Peter is an important Lord in there and we will get further and deeper into this very soon remember you pretended pretended you before the world ever began and all of your descendants and and all of the people that came before he apprehended the chromosomes the apprehended the bloodlines to form you because he saw your he he knew you before societies people were around to shape your personality and to shape the battle that he has set before you so many can have a certain battle in your life a certain ring that would make you a certain way because you would have to be that way an eternity and all things consist he holds the universe he holds every Exum and every energy particle and every light Photon everything is under and before him that's where all things consist and there is a constitution that holds it and he spoke it out of his mouth speaks of message in mistake though to to ever hand you to Orry and to keep you and he does this through Edom anointing ministry a bit later he'll he holds that message in his hands let's just continue this background here in Psalm 139 Jenna verses 7 to 10 it says here whither shall I go from by spirit shall I flee from by presence if I ascend up into heaven thou up there in my bed in hell behold thou out there take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea even there shall thy hand leave me and my right hand remember this right hand the Lord is not afraid to to rescue somebody from the pizza from of the spear you know it doesn't even if you've blown the down the darkest deepest trenches of depression even if you bleed down into alcoholism so deep and so entrenched you think that you've gone beyond but you haven't gone beyond because he will still lead you he's still holding you and he's ready to cleanse you to bring you back thank you Lord to bring you back to the way he's holding you he won't let you go he can't let you go because you're part of them he you you see in and that's why you know he says in that day you shall know my father and your and me and I'm a new ally and so if he says under my father you're amazing you were already part of him and that's why he pretended your forefathers are apprehended your lineages to construct you to bring you forth because he had a certain place in the temple he had a certain place in the City of God for you hallelujah you meant part of it you are part of this maybe that's why he's holding you and he's doing everything he does he's holding you in your right hand and you have fallen so far and he would rescue the people from the violence in his heart and he would make it clean by the bleach of his blood thank you Jesus he wouldn't make the violence hot clean because he's holding that hot and holds your heart in his hands your heart is hell even now and if as you see the journey of Israel as you see in the Old Testament as you see in the New Testament with the Apostles even though the Lord's holding you even though even though you know that you are securing him your faith will be challenged you will be tested because the Lord has proven what he has inside you proving your faith and having fourth gold you know there's a reason why these things have to happen and there is a worship that needs to come forth and that's why you see no matter how far we go you may get sick God will hold you you make full flat on your face God will hold you he will be with you amen no matter where you go no matter what happens to you God will hold you he will keep you I mean you see God himself as we've written as we just spoke has tabernacled and men again a man has come down to two mana game and you are having a feast with him Halloween there is a communion taking place in your heart and yes you are having a preview of miniature feast of tabernacles we all go to Jerusalem we all have a millennial condition the preview of a fellowship with the King down into your heart in your life come down and enjoy themselves [Applause] we're about to head into a season where circumstances may not be very good different sponsors may be very dire they may be very hard but you see God will Tabernacle with us God's not gonna they may not be taken away and no signs of God's disapproval neither the bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us his love is elective a man which he has which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes yes I'm so glad hallelujah you know this is a very powerful thing for me because yeah you know in the life I come from and probably most of us if not all of us with with we have fought this battle and the battle is you have to prove yourself to be accepted in a circle of people or a circle of friends you know growing up until you into the into the fellowship of the beloved where it's not based on your performance it's not based on how what you can bring to the table it's based on a lectin election it's based on the form you don't have to be by the divine appointment but the Constitution that he's holding in his you don't have to prove yourself to be part of the Chicana Tabernacle you don't have to perform to be anything special you are special and you see that you see we do and before we get the Holy Ghost and before we are in the economy of God and recognizing these things you know we there's a striving that happens in the schoolyard there's a striving that happens on the street is a striving that happens in your business in your career and there's a striving amongst all the children even in the church is a striving to be a check that is a striving to to be cool because of the fall because of human nature so because of that it becomes ingrained in us and you see I just love this and if you could just meditate on this just if you struggle with that just meditate on this his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his lovers are lifted which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes we know we shall know because he said son amen and it's that voice he says my voice carry me you should say right now lord help me to hear that will help receive that be something but lord help me to accept how do we know because he said some and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his third and placed us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said conducting myself with joy we don't know holes but we know who he's holding you wants to do is he wants you to question your question your identity don't question the game reason with the devil little reasonings because the side and submitted to the word and you aren't accepted you are being held because God said so in John chapter 10 verse 27 to 30 it says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me yes and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's I and my father are one I'm so glad he said that I'm so glad and you may go through songs but I tell you now God has sent you a message Elijah the Prophet hallelujah remember whose hand Elijah the Prophet was in the seventh angel the seventh star was in the hand of Jesus Christ and we'll read that in a minute he's in the right hand and he sent a message hallelujah and he sent this message and he holds a lighter in his hand because he's sending a word to him coming through the message to all of you all of you sure of this opportunity that is here right now amen where it's still is the entertainment that's like Goliath is on the ground with the virus and yet the Challenger of the world or the entertainment or but ill the filth of spirits they just held like that because they can't do anything the world is at a standstill and the people are sober minded and now it's time to act hallelujah young man you see this message there is a message and God has sent messages to every age the oddest hit messages to every generation is he speaks and he uses that message to older people to grab the people amen to take the people from a corrupted situation from a judgment from from from going the wrong way because God is in his mind has to rest the desire of God would be allowed to go to the very to the very edges of judgment and from the from the hold of you it was you see and these messages they are unique because good when God sends a message he's sending that message to grab a hold of the people he's sending this message to to bring the people up into and this is quite a awesome thought but when people come fully into the message of their age and a bid generation you see they get caught up into a place where they're not affected the laws of the land not affected by the corruption of evil spirits they not affected by the judgment that surrounds the people of the message is a higher order they are of a diplomatic immunity does anyone who want diplomatic immunity amen so I will just explain that a little bit but message is pleasing the other sermon but I just want you know I want to just for you to realize diplomatic immunity is let's say the embassy of Australia here in Wellington and the embassy is not New Zealand law it's actually Australian law yeah and those people those ambassadors of Australia that represent Australia that represent the constitution of Australia they are under Australian law and they can pretty much do anything if Australian law says that they can take any like drugs or whatever just for want of a better you know so if they can do that then they're allowed to do that in their embassy and they have an immunity from the New Zealand law from anything that little New Zealand can come upon them now there is lots of tags and strings and everything because of humanity and Satan's Kingdom but let me tell you that we're of a government that's fire of its indirectly shall be no increase shall be no end of its increasing should continue to push for there is no limitations this is the kingdom of Jesus Christ under diplomatic immunity from all of the evils of this world all the evils that Satan could put up on this world all the corruptions all the judgments all the sicknesses plays community amen just like this round had diplomatic immunity in motion they did not get touched by the plagues a message of Moses a message of Moses they had diplomatic immunity they had their own he didn't condition hallelujah that was completely above it was completely separated God puts a difference between you in the world puts a difference between his people grace God has put those people and medicine different looks a wall between you see under that message of Noah let's go to the message of Noah right now you see when Noah brought the message the message culminated in the ark and God brought the people under the message of Nora up into the above the judgments and completely separated from the elements of the world amen and they were caught up about the judgments in to know is missing and they made it to the new earth louia and is the Moses God help the people and kick them from every plane a man under the message of Joshua God kicked right hand let me just show you how much God can get you to the edge and still protect you it goes beyond imagination argue to even figure it out let's just believe it just be dispelled because when you see right hands testimony she believed the message she believed the message of the Prophet even though she wasn't on vacation she was a Gentile just like you and she believed the message and she said I believe us Joshua and I'm going to it's going to be predicted captain Tanner when the walls came down and judgment struck of the whole world to the next of a house women the walls fell down crumble to the ground and harassed amen hebrews 12:2 it says here looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him Amen hello joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of God amen amen when he was on help there u smade au dis burial and resurrection held in the mind of God because he knew that one day you would be here and no matter what the situation there would be a worship coming for in the Holy of Holies the glory your shuttle was God a man not distracted by the things is always amazing you go from being a man shake my man cut down my man used by man to judge people and you become a tree again just like you were holding a man let's let's go to Revelation chapter 1 he says here now look where the stars are headed to the city verses 13 to 18 it says here and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and good about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool and white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire as fleet like unto fine brass and I'm very happy about his feet they place judgment on the enemies of your soul those feet place judgment on all of the enemies of your soul friend they put them under subject subjection for you so that you can hold has made him hold you let him within you hold to the promises of the very appearance of evil shall we listen to them you'll be challenged a challenge yes we challenged and we challenged but this is the faith challenge this is the challenge that we face and then but we must fight as we must gain increase our courage Lord yes not umbrageous amen you see the Lord will fight our battles but we must wait on him move ahead we cannot pull back we just wait on the Lord and when he moves we moves when he speaks we speak amen bringing us to that place where we like Jesus can be led by the vision of the Father amen he's holding you he's not gonna let you go don't let the devil ever tell you that he's going that he's got a loose script because he ain't got a loose grip man his grip is eternal his grip cannot be broken Robin and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars amen getting out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the Sun Shine at than a strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not let him let him come to you right now even and Leia's right hand on you and then tell you fear not my child fear not my bride fear not fear anything these things yes this is all temporal don't observe lying manatees yes sir please go design he went there liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forevermore amen I have the keys of hell and of death so yes see he holds the seven stars in his head and you see when this star when that messenger was he was speaking and he was under the king of kings he would come down and he would he would take himself into a beautiful place and he will keep you in cause he made us our and he's for you let's not say that you set back on the takes to the enemy purpose for you he's got a purpose that you will rise he's got a land that needs to be dispossessed he's gonna use you and he's causing you to razor and even in the season when we're lost into our homes and we can't do anything there is a great opportunity that you just seem flaming arrows [Applause] [Music] [Applause] enjoy amen you know the Lord Himself comes down through the message of the star you know he was holding myself I'm gonna hold them in mine so that you can rise up and be who you really are an eternity [Music] he's holding he was

is faith in this place to change lives amen amen I'm gonna close hallelujah where is it here sit here glory oh not be a glorious thing about sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough yeah so accept them think about them our sinful thoughts all the reasoning and thinking and all the busyness and all the pressures all the responsibility if they can just be later so I just lay them aside and he would advance all the way from glory tonight to make himself known to any of you remember he's got the book in his hand the lamb advancing from glory for intercessions all right to make claims now for his Redemption yeah amen and further along than the same message to the bridge he says now o the whole creation legs in his hand now he's covered in his head on which the whole plan of redemption is sealed by sip and mysterious seals in this book that he took in this book now and he alone can reveal it to them so ever he will he's got it in his hand amen thank you revelation ten

theology not just from your pastor or from the brothers or from anyone else from your mom or your neighbour from heaven or Lord speaks I could from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the
