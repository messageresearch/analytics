[30:44] oh how I love the Lamb of God isn't it
[30:56] wonderful that when we listen to the
[30:58] songs were they from a different tongue
[31:03] that it's still blesses our hearts
[31:06] because there is something pure when you
[31:08] sing from your heart and from your
[31:11] convictions there's something pure about
[31:14] that just want to say something about
[31:20] this song when you speak we sing in
[31:23] there we're seeing when you speak will
[31:27] you let me hear and often we we're
[31:29] expecting this voice to come at us but
[31:35] sometimes it's not a voice sometimes
[31:38] it's something you see some sometimes
[31:41] it's something you feel sometimes it's
[31:44] silence and I pray that we be mature
[31:48] enough to listen to every voice that he
[31:52] sends us everything that he says that
[31:55] we'll be mature enough to listen to that
[31:59] voice whether it's a still voice loud
[32:02] voice a direct voice and maybe a voice
[32:07] that says no and that is my prayer for
[32:12] us in this time let's stand and we'll
[32:17] sing that
[32:20] [Music]
[32:31] Lord I know I'm ready to walk into your

[42:39] of Luke in chapter 2 and read the
[42:44] scripture three three places in the
[42:50] scripture I'd like to read the first is
[42:53] and is in Luke chapter 2 and so burning
[42:56] noelia

[43:06] for you you pray for us and we'll see
[43:08] each other again so I hope you have a
[43:10] good time at home so we've looked Luke
[43:15] two and four
[43:20] and it sees here and Joseph I'd like to
[43:24] thank all the brothers as well it helped
[43:26] with putting a new audio snake and the
[43:29] fallback speaker and things as brother
[43:31] John said was too about technical
[43:32] difficulties but thank you people on who
[43:34] came and helped install it and you know
[43:36] I wish sometimes that we lived in the
[43:39] day we had no electricity life would be
[43:42] simple but hey we can still use these
[43:44] things for God's glory so Eddie I'm
[43:46] sorry Luke 2 and verses 4 to 7 it says
[43:50] here it says and Joseph also went up
[43:55] from her up from Galilee out of the city
[43:58] of Nazareth into Judea unto the City of
[44:01] David which is called Bethlehem because
[44:04] he was of the house and lineage of David
[44:06] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[44:09] being great with child and it and so it
[44:12] was that while they were there the days
[44:14] were accomplished that she should be
[44:16] delivered and she brought forth her
[44:20] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[44:22] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[44:24] manger because there was no room for
[44:27] them in the end Hebrews chapter 2
[44:36] um yes brother John was saying you know
[44:39] we were in a Christmas season and I want
[44:42] to my mind is very much my heart is very
[44:45] much on this part of the scripture at
[44:48] this time but let's just read this here
[44:54] it says so Hebrews 2 and 5 to 7 it says
[44:58] for unto a for unto the Angels hath he
[45:02] not put in subjection the world to come
[45:05] where whereof we speak but one in a
[45:08] certain place testify earth saying who
[45:11] was man that thou art mindful of him who
[45:14] was the son of man that thou visitest
[45:16] him they are made of some little lower
[45:20] than the Angels our crown has him with
[45:22] glory and honor and that has set him
[45:24] over the works of thine hands and it
[45:28] says here thou has put all things in
[45:30] subjection under his feet for in that he
[45:33] put an all subjection under him he left
[45:35] nothing that is not put under him but
[45:37] now we see not yet all things put under
[45:40] him but we see Jesus who has made a
[45:43] little lower than the Angels for the
[45:44] suffering of death crowned with glory
[45:46] and honor that he by the grace of God
[45:48] should taste death for every man for it
[45:51] became him for whom are all things and
[45:53] by whom are all things and bringing unto
[45:56] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[46:00] the captain of their salvation perfect
[46:02] through sufferings and we've got one
[46:05] more scripture and first samuel chapter
[46:08] 22 then after we read this we'll pray
[46:14] see us here there's a bit of a context
[46:16] here now remember we read that Jesus was
[46:19] the lineage of David and when I talk
[46:22] about Bethlehem and and David and in
[46:25] Jesus and us as well it's first samuel
[46:29] 20 to 1 and to David therefore departed
[46:32] thence so this is when he's on the run
[46:33] from Saul and escaped to the cave
[46:35] Abdullah and when his brethren and all
[46:38] his father's house heard it they went
[46:40] hither to him and notice everyone and
[46:43] everyone that was in distress who was
[46:45] distressed and everyone that was in debt
[46:47] who had a debt they could not pay
[46:49] everyone that was discontented gave
[46:51] themselves under him and he became a
[46:53] captain over them and were with him
[46:55] about 400 men I mean this bow heads in a
[46:59] just in a word of Prayer
[47:00] gracious father we have opened the pages
[47:03] of your Holy Scripture Lord we have read
[47:05] father some verses and Lord we're
[47:08] praying now as we come to this part of
[47:10] the service Lord may you make them alive
[47:12] in every soul father may you anoint your
[47:14] word to every heart father may you give
[47:17] us attentive ears Lord and may your
[47:20] night not just our ears but our hearts
[47:22] to receive your word and father may it
[47:24] anchor down into our souls and change
[47:26] our lives father and Lord we just want
[47:29] to commit each one into your hands be
[47:30] with those who couldn't be here today
[47:32] Lord may they feel the same atmosphere
[47:34] that is among us father and may you just
[47:37] strengthen us by your word today Lord we
[47:39] want to commit the service into your
[47:40] hands may you just take speaker in here
[47:43] Lord under your control we just yield
[47:45] ourselves to you as your prophet told us
[47:48] the greatest gift anyone could ever have
[47:49] is to get themselves out of the way
[47:51] that's a gift to get ourselves out the
[47:53] way that you can come and live through
[47:54] us Lord and father may you grant it for
[47:56] your glory alone we ask these things in
[47:59] Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may
[48:02] have your seats this morning so I want
[48:06] to talk about warrior sons of Bethlehem
[48:09] now we read here yo we've come into a
[48:13] Christmas season and many people are
[48:16] looking back to us first coming but I
[48:18] want to I want to speak of a second
[48:20] coming and I want to speak about David
[48:24] and then Jesus now we understand that
[48:26] there's a reason and the Prophet tells
[48:29] us why Jesus had to be born in Bethlehem
[48:31] because Bethlehem means the house of
[48:33] God's bread and he is the bread that
[48:35] came down from heaven amen so he had to
[48:37] be born there he couldn't be born in
[48:39] Jerusalem or one of the great cities of
[48:41] refuge he had to be born in Bethlehem
[48:43] because he is the God's bread it means
[48:47] he had to come out of the house of God's
[48:48] bread which is what Bethlehem means and
[48:50] also he is the water of here's the well
[48:53] of salvation there's a well there amen
[48:55] so these things are manifested in Jesus
[48:57] Christ and now we also every true
[49:01] believer is born
[49:02] Bethlehem not a physical place but
[49:05] you're born if you've been born again in
[49:07] Christ I mean you've been born in
[49:09] Bethlehem Amen so now David
[49:13] we understand was a great warrior king
[49:15] and he foreshadowed Jesus Christ now
[49:18] there's a people upon the earth where
[49:22] we're gonna read about David's mighty
[49:23] mean now I just pray that the Lord will
[49:25] just helped me this morning I kind of
[49:29] feel a bit I just pray it in the channel
[49:32] but David David was a foreshadow of
[49:34] Christ now he came out of Bethlehem amen
[49:37] and so he became a great warrior he was
[49:41] anointed by Samuel and we know that the
[49:43] start of his life he was just looking
[49:45] after his daddy's sheep but he had an
[49:47] atmosphere after the Prophet anointed
[49:49] him with the anointing oil said the
[49:51] Spirit of God was with him from that day
[49:53] forth and and he went back to look after
[49:55] his daddy's sheep but now there was an
[49:57] atmosphere around him a man just wasn't
[49:59] just a natural birth he had but the
[50:01] Spirit of God came into his life and he
[50:03] began to sing and he begin to worship
[50:05] because God wants more than a
[50:07] performance God wants more than just
[50:09] that maybe a pretty arrangement of music
[50:12] but a real worship comes from the heart
[50:14] a real worship comes from a person who
[50:16] has actually met God that's a real
[50:18] worship amen when we worship God
[50:20] according to revelation I mean that is a
[50:23] real a real worship when you understand
[50:25] it's more than here but it's down here
[50:27] Jesus you saved me Jesus you redeem me I
[50:30] was lost and undone without God or his
[50:33] son but he reached out his hand for me
[50:35] amen we begin to sing these kind of kind
[50:38] of songs you know I'm actually
[50:39] left-handed sudheer how about that I
[50:41] mean when we sing these kind of songs I
[50:44] mean it's more than just a hit knowledge
[50:46] or more than just some nice words amen
[50:49] but there's a revelation our souls and
[50:50] we can truly worship God in spirit and
[50:53] in truth
[50:53] I mean Sir David would you know he would
[50:56] plan us hopin he would begin to play and
[50:58] God would come down and you know and
[51:00] then and in the and in the devil sent in
[51:03] yo the enemy came in just in a small way
[51:06] in a lion and a bear and he defeated
[51:08] these two animals and then he came
[51:10] against Goliath and we know that the
[51:13] Philistines when they were attacking
[51:16] with our camp that came into Judah and
[51:18] David came from the tribe of Judah so
[51:21] they came they came on to David's
[51:23] inheritance and so here he is now
[51:25] standing in his inheritance and the
[51:27] enemies come upon his inheritance and
[51:29] that's why he could look at them and say
[51:31] how dare these this army of
[51:33] uncircumcised philistine defied the
[51:36] armies of the Living God and he stood
[51:38] there and he had a revelation this is my
[51:41] land this is my ground I'm going to
[51:43] defeat this enemy whatever enemy comes
[51:46] against me it's gonna fall hallelujah
[51:49] and it must be the same with you I mean
[51:51] because it's not just David Amen who
[51:53] came out of Bethlehem or Jesus the great
[51:56] warrior hallelujah
[51:57] he didn't just conquer a land he
[51:59] conquered hell death in the grief amen
[52:01] he conquered everything that could be
[52:02] conquered hallelujah he gave us an
[52:05] example I mean this is how you do it
[52:07] boys
[52:08] only the church I'll show you how it's
[52:10] done hallelujah and so now David's
[52:13] standing in his land
[52:14] when Goliath came against them you know
[52:16] there's a reason he picked up five
[52:17] stones because he knew that Goliath had
[52:20] brothers so he he just realized hey if
[52:23] I've got to kill all five I'll kill all
[52:25] five I mean I've got I've got I've got a
[52:28] day amen
[52:29] why no fault then the other one will
[52:31] fall the third one will fall the fifth
[52:33] one will fall amen they'll all die
[52:35] because they're in my land and one will
[52:38] chase at the house until chased ten
[52:40] thousand a member the thing is the army
[52:42] of Israel knew it could be done but the
[52:45] Prophet tells us that was revealed it
[52:47] was revealed to David that it could be
[52:49] done and when it's revealed to you it
[52:51] can be done that's a lot different than
[52:53] just knowing it can be done I mean so
[52:55] when it's revealed to you I mean that he
[52:58] is the same yesterday today and forever
[52:59] where he's revealed to you I mean and
[53:01] who is the fullness of joy
[53:03] amen peace of passes all understanding I
[53:06] mean when these things and no weapon
[53:08] that's formed against you shall prosper
[53:10] when it's revealed to you not just I
[53:12] know that that's a nice first when it's
[53:14] revealed to you then you can go into
[53:16] action then you can really you know push
[53:19] the enemy back then you can really call
[53:21] us Bluff a man and say Satan you're
[53:24] nothing but a bluff I mean by the blood
[53:26] of Jesus Christ I cast you out of this
[53:28] place
[53:29] hallelujah we have a right to do these
[53:31] things when it's revealed
[53:32] I trust has been revealed to you amen
[53:36] friends we see him coming into power I'm
[53:39] going to jump to the right the end of my
[53:40] service right now he'll stand with him
[53:43] in this day he'll draw a sword
[53:45] I mean he'll draw their sword and stand
[53:48] with this rejected King this is our
[53:51] lovely Lord Jesus he'll draw their sword
[53:54] I'm made in God get him a fresh drink of
[53:56] worship
[53:57] I mean Oh get him a cool drink of water
[53:59] from the Wow hallelujah where the enemy
[54:02] has has been stir well all all
[54:04] garrisoned up and fortified up I mean
[54:07] where the devil swore he says God's
[54:10] children will not worship Him in spirit
[54:11] and in truth they'll not drink of the
[54:13] well amen of Bethlehem who will stand
[54:16] with me who will stand with in the sour
[54:18] with a sword drawn with this word in
[54:21] their mouth not in the habit in their
[54:22] mouth hallelujah two injured sword who
[54:26] will stand someone has to make a stand
[54:28] and a mastaba you I miss not someone
[54:31] else to do it miles over you and mouths
[54:33] will be me hallelujah you know we don't
[54:37] play church
[54:38] we don't play religion this is not just
[54:41] something we do on the side of life this
[54:43] should be our everything I'll walk with
[54:45] God should be our everything and
[54:47] everything in life we do we say we where
[54:49] we go whatever we do should be because
[54:52] it should be this should be in the
[54:54] scripture hallelujah and if it
[54:56] contradicts it check it out or change
[54:58] what you do in the very least we're not
[55:01] here to play the devil's not here to
[55:04] play neither are we
[55:05] the devil doesn't play games how I got
[55:07] you ha ha ha no he doesn't play games he
[55:09] wants to destroy you
[55:11] just like he put six millions used to
[55:13] death in the concentration camps I mean
[55:16] that same spirit that was turned against
[55:17] them has turned against you and they
[55:19] were physically put to death but the
[55:21] devil wants you to spiritually die amen
[55:25] so this cuz spirits don't die the people
[55:27] just die and this world has been
[55:30] fashioned by those same spirits
[55:32] we don't play games I trust you don't
[55:34] play you play around this is serious I'm
[55:37] going to heaven I mean I'm not going to
[55:40] a fictitious place I'm really going to
[55:42] that place
[55:43] I'm really going to be in his presence
[55:45] hallelujah let's draw our swords friends
[55:49] I mean see here come here come geez now
[55:52] said David was born out of Bethlehem and
[55:54] you can go read it in the scripture when
[55:57] he became King they conquered the
[55:58] fullness of the promised land go read it
[56:01] when he when he became king you read and
[56:03] I think second Samuel they possessed the
[56:05] fullness of the land now that's just a
[56:07] shadow that's just a natural land but
[56:09] then Jesus came out of Bethlehem here
[56:12] come here come the great warrior our God
[56:14] is a mighty warrior you know that he's
[56:16] not just a nice little person meek
[56:18] little lowly piece he he's a warrior I
[56:22] mean he's got a sword in his mouth your
[56:24] sword
[56:25] amen he's in battle hallelujah just like
[56:29] the battle even this morning I mean
[56:31] there's a battle can you receive his
[56:32] word and be free although he doubted and
[56:34] throw it aside and The Devil's
[56:36] whispering in your ear don't pay
[56:38] attention as brother John Cena can come
[56:40] quietly or can come shouting hallelujah
[56:42] and you probably can guess what kind of
[56:44] voice is now speaking to you amen but
[56:48] the thing is now we don't want to be
[56:50] bogged down by tradition we don't want
[56:52] to be bogged down by all this as a way
[56:54] of life and this is just accepted in our
[56:56] culture it's got to be going beyond that
[56:58] it's got to go beyond just this is how I
[57:00] was raised and this is what my parents
[57:02] told me this is what my church tells me
[57:05] it's going to go beyond that and it's
[57:07] going to become a living reality see
[57:10] here come the great warrior Jesus they
[57:13] cried out for a messiah and they got a
[57:15] baby they cried out for a great general
[57:18] to drive the Romans away they got a baby
[57:20] and God sent them what they needed many
[57:24] times we we we misunderstand the way God
[57:28] sends things so they sent them a baby he
[57:31] said them I'll become flesh and I'll
[57:33] lead the you know I'll lead the way and
[57:35] he conquered everything that could be
[57:37] conquered we read there in Hebrews
[57:40] chapter 2 that he became a captain to
[57:46] make it captain of their salvation
[57:46] perfect through sufferings
[57:52] verse 10 there Hebrews 2 so he became a
[57:56] captain now I trust he's your captain
[57:59] that he has brought you because you're
[58:02] you're a member of son as a position so
[58:05] a son and a daughter is the same it's
[58:06] not just all men in heaven you know his
[58:09] sons and daughters but a son in the
[58:11] Bible's up as a position so he'd bring
[58:14] many sons unto glory that's you as he
[58:18] brought you unto glory he's lifted you
[58:19] up I meant out of the miry clay
[58:23] hallelujah and he's now made a captain
[58:25] of their salvation perfect through
[58:26] sufferings so now our Lord Jesus as I
[58:29] said when he when he went up Calvary
[58:32] that day he defeated hell he defeated
[58:35] death I mean he took the sting of death
[58:38] because Paul would pull his hip was
[58:41] about to be chopped off and he just
[58:43] cried out dis where his ice thingy grave
[58:45] where is thy victory
[58:46] thanks be to God through our Lord Jesus
[58:48] Christ it gives us the victory I mean
[58:50] because yo the devil had a stinger and
[58:53] he and and any and he put that into
[58:55] every man woman child that had been born
[58:57] I mean he put the stinger into Adam he
[59:00] put the stinger into Eve he put the
[59:02] stinger and desist and all the way down
[59:04] through everyone but now here comes
[59:06] another one and he looked like everyone
[59:09] else and he was mad more than any man
[59:12] you know he was just a man like us but
[59:14] he was the Word made flesh and so here
[59:16] he was on Calvary and then now that
[59:18] stinger of death was was hovering around
[59:20] him he comes the greatest victory and it
[59:22] looks like a great defeat looks like a
[59:24] great defeat all the disciples are
[59:26] crying out we thought he was going to
[59:28] save us we thought he was going to
[59:30] deliver us we believed he was the
[59:31] Messiah and there he is hanging on a
[59:33] cross dying by the cruelest death that
[59:35] could be imagined and there's a sting of
[59:37] death hovering around them and then it
[59:40] went to inject itself in because he says
[59:41] it's finished
[59:42] he gave consent I lay my life down
[59:44] hallelujah and in the sting of death
[59:46] went into him but the stair couldn't be
[59:49] pulled out I mean just like a be the
[59:52] devil's like a be a man he's got that
[59:54] stinger but you know when a bee stings
[59:56] you and it tries to pull its stinger out
[59:58] and get separated out of its body and it
[1:00:00] dies hallelujah so now here's here's the
[1:00:03] devil with his great stinger hovering
[1:00:05] around
[1:00:06] and then he sinks it into the flesh of
[1:00:07] our Lord Jesus Christ to kill him amen
[1:00:10] but then the stinger stays then he tries
[1:00:12] to pull it out but he can't pull it out
[1:00:14] and he rips and the steering gets ripped
[1:00:16] out so now he's just a bunch of noise I
[1:00:18] mean he's just a distraction like a fly
[1:00:21] hovering around hallelujah that's what
[1:00:24] he is today I mean this has no hold of
[1:00:27] you head the grave couldn't hold Jesus
[1:00:29] the grave
[1:00:30] how could and how he took your sins on
[1:00:32] himself to help on your behalf
[1:00:35] pal couldn't hold him the grave couldn't
[1:00:38] hold him you think some Roman seal over
[1:00:40] some term could hold him coming forth I
[1:00:42] mean what a joke but the devil did his
[1:00:44] best
[1:00:45] amen the devil lit his best but then now
[1:00:48] you know we he conquered hell death in
[1:00:52] the grave he conquered everything that
[1:00:55] could be conquered he took it all he he
[1:00:58] captured it all hallelujah he's our
[1:01:02] captain amen
[1:01:04] no David we see was on the run from Saul
[1:01:08] and people gathered to him people
[1:01:12] gathered to him it was more than just
[1:01:15] his family because we read there let's
[1:01:18] just put it back up it says and everyone
[1:01:21] that was in distress notice these people
[1:01:23] everyone that was in distress and
[1:01:25] everyone that was in debt and everyone
[1:01:28] that was discontented gathered
[1:01:30] themselves under him and he became a
[1:01:32] captain over them and there were with
[1:01:34] him a four hundred men so it doesn't say
[1:01:36] and everyone that was happy and everyone
[1:01:40] they had lots of money and everyone that
[1:01:43] was content gave themselves it was the
[1:01:46] ones in debt in distress discontented
[1:01:48] they gave themselves to David as a set
[1:01:51] member David as a type of our Lord Jesus
[1:01:53] Christ he is a fugitive in this world a
[1:01:56] man he is a fugitive in this world it
[1:01:59] says in the later scene church age that
[1:02:01] he's on the outside of the church world
[1:02:02] knocking trying to get back head
[1:02:04] he's been cast out I mean he's been cast
[1:02:06] out but says now everyone that was in
[1:02:10] distress discontented and did they
[1:02:12] gather themselves to David hallelujah
[1:02:15] and it's the same thing with us right
[1:02:17] now there's a reason they
[1:02:18] gathered to him the Prophet tells us
[1:02:21] they knew he was coming into power they
[1:02:24] knew he would be king one day even
[1:02:27] though he's on the run
[1:02:28] they knew he'd be King one day and I
[1:02:30] trust that when you see him in this hour
[1:02:33] you know he's going to sit on the throne
[1:02:35] of David in the Millennium you know he's
[1:02:37] coming into power
[1:02:38] you know the Millennium is soon a merit
[1:02:41] Trust is something as stirs in your
[1:02:42] heart amen my captain my Lord Jesus is
[1:02:45] going to sit on the throne of David in
[1:02:47] the Millennium hallelujah now the same
[1:02:52] anointing that when upon David now came
[1:02:55] upon the men that gathered with them
[1:02:58] amen and we'll read here if you got your
[1:03:01] Bibles handy second samuel 23 the same
[1:03:06] anointing now i'm trust this is this is
[1:03:08] probably quite familiar to most of us
[1:03:09] but you know when you read the Bible and
[1:03:13] the exploits that the believers did it's
[1:03:15] not Hollywood it's not choreographed in
[1:03:18] some way and they basically just look at
[1:03:20] some unnamed enemy and he falls over and
[1:03:22] dies these are real people
[1:03:24] these are trained warriors that they
[1:03:26] fought against but the same anointing
[1:03:28] that that came upon David and he killed
[1:03:31] Goliath with a slingshot amen as the
[1:03:34] same anointing that came upon the ones
[1:03:35] that gathered to him and it should be
[1:03:37] the same thing with us now this the same
[1:03:40] word I mean this this message that's
[1:03:43] come in the same time it's more than
[1:03:44] words a mental life as Jesus Christ has
[1:03:47] been released through the mouth of a
[1:03:49] prophet I mean that same anointing I
[1:03:51] mean that was released through his words
[1:03:53] comes on to the believer amen in the
[1:03:55] same life that was in him as now on you
[1:03:57] so the same the same one that defeated
[1:04:00] the enemies back their defeats them in
[1:04:02] your life hallelujah because why because
[1:04:05] that same anointing that was just like
[1:04:07] Jesus and the disciples he gathered them
[1:04:09] I mean he became a captain he gathered
[1:04:12] you know illiterate fisherman
[1:04:14] prostitutes
[1:04:16] amen drunkards publicans sinners
[1:04:19] whatever they were they gather
[1:04:20] themselves to Jesus I mean then on the
[1:04:23] day of Pentecost the same anointing that
[1:04:24] was in him separated into the believers
[1:04:27] hallelujah and they cast out devils like
[1:04:29] he did
[1:04:30] they they took control of every
[1:04:32] situation like he did hallelujah
[1:04:34] they were not bad by the pressure of the
[1:04:36] world I mean like he wasn't bowed
[1:04:39] hallelujah it should be the same thing
[1:04:41] with you and I I mean because on the you
[1:04:43] know we'll come back to bed
[1:04:46] amen it's just like when when the
[1:04:48] Apostles are dragged before the
[1:04:49] Sanhedrin the same people that condemn
[1:04:51] Jesus to death and they and they
[1:04:53] threaten them do not preach in his name
[1:04:55] do not speak in his name anymore and
[1:04:58] they stand there saying well surely
[1:05:00] please me nor God you decide hallelujah
[1:05:03] and they were beaten and they were they
[1:05:05] were cast out and then they had a prayer
[1:05:07] meeting now the enemy was trying to put
[1:05:09] a fear in them that they wouldn't just
[1:05:12] like the Philistines garrison the well
[1:05:15] around Bethlehem to try and keep them
[1:05:17] from their source of life I mean which
[1:05:20] is the Holy Ghost in you he'll try and
[1:05:22] put a complex and you try and put some
[1:05:24] pain in you some unbelief in you that
[1:05:26] will keep you from the your well wholly
[1:05:29] because the well is meant to run free a
[1:05:31] member then they had a time of Prayer
[1:05:33] and God came down shook the place and it
[1:05:37] gave them boldness and they went out
[1:05:39] preaching I mean they got in touch with
[1:05:41] the well hallelujah and it's the same
[1:05:44] thing with you and I friends the devil
[1:05:45] will try and cut your prayer life he'll
[1:05:48] try and cut your joy can't your time
[1:05:50] with the word Amen cut that from you cuz
[1:05:53] if he can then where's the water God
[1:05:56] Amen we don't want to be like that you
[1:06:02] say well the enemies have it a go just
[1:06:04] have a pre-meeting
[1:06:05] you say but there's only me have a you
[1:06:07] and God have a pre-meeting
[1:06:08] Amen Lord Jesus is no one else around I
[1:06:11] would have a prayer meeting with you
[1:06:12] hallelujah we say well how can he pray
[1:06:15] he can take your lips and pray himself
[1:06:17] through you amen now and these are the
[1:06:22] mighty men whom David ahead these are
[1:06:26] the discontented this is the ones and it
[1:06:28] these are the distressed I mean I didn't

[1:24:34] your natural lineage and traits you
[1:24:36] don't have to be a slave to it Jesus is
[1:24:39] here to set the captive free I mean
[1:24:41] there has to be a people to break the
[1:24:42] cycle amen of a violence or whatever it
[1:24:46] is you see family things come through
[1:24:48] can be alcohol spirit or something comes
[1:24:50] through there's going to be someone that
[1:24:52] breaks the cycle amen and your mouth
[1:24:54] will stand up and say Here I am to do to
[1:24:58] do business I mean I'm going to cut
[1:25:00] through this this Philistine garrison
[1:25:03] hallelujah we can do it friends I'm
[1:25:11] sorry oh yes I do I read it to you in
[1:25:13] English then in there David's when Davis
[1:25:17] desire was to have a fresh drink he
[1:25:20] probably had some old warm stagnated
[1:25:21] water up there he was drinking but he
[1:25:23] happened to think of that fresh water
[1:25:25] down there at Bethlehem the house of
[1:25:27] God's bread and he said if I only had a
[1:25:29] drink from that well and those men
[1:25:31] pulled their sword and fought 15 miles
[1:25:34] of Philistines not because he asked him
[1:25:37] to do it but because they knowed he
[1:25:39] wanted it I love that because he knowed
[1:25:43] he wanted it and they cut them
[1:25:44] Philistines all the way to the well
[1:25:46] while two of them fought the other one
[1:25:48] got a bucket of water and fought their
[1:25:49] way back all the way back and handed it
[1:25:51] to David talked about Galland hallelujah
[1:25:55] friends let's get him a drink of water
[1:25:58] who will stand with me in the stellar I
[1:26:01] mean let's not worry about one is a
[1:26:03] majority in God who knows that one is a
[1:26:06] majority I mean you don't have to have a
[1:26:08] big group around you one is a majority
[1:26:10] hallelujah if it's you and God you
[1:26:12] outnumber everything everyone and
[1:26:14] everything you are there's more on your
[1:26:16] side amen Elijah you know was there and
[1:26:19] his servant went out brother Brown says
[1:26:21] to to put the milk bottles out by the
[1:26:23] front door and he saw and then the
[1:26:25] Assyrians were camp around the city
[1:26:26] where they were and now he was scared Oh
[1:26:28] what are we going to do we're going to
[1:26:30] perish and Elijah just prayed Lord
[1:26:32] opened the man's eyes and then he looked
[1:26:34] and he saw the army of heaven was
[1:26:37] encamped around one man
[1:26:39] and can't drown one man and that was a
[1:26:41] man under the blood of bulls and goats I
[1:26:42] mean what about the bride of Jesus
[1:26:44] Christ under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:46] hallelujah this far more with me then
[1:26:49] against me hallelujah we don't need to
[1:26:51] worry about how many Devils there are it
[1:26:53] doesn't matter
[1:26:54] they're all full they'll all fall to the
[1:26:57] name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen
[1:27:04] think about it David that godly man said
[1:27:07] God's better died drink from these drink
[1:27:09] it from these friends that put their
[1:27:11] life in jeopardy
[1:27:11] he made a drink offering poured it out
[1:27:13] upon the ground to the Lord give it to
[1:27:15] the Lord he's the one worthy of it not
[1:27:17] me and they put the very type of Christ
[1:27:19] himself with his own eternal life within
[1:27:21] him the smitten rock poured his life
[1:27:23] upon the ground as a sin offering for us
[1:27:25] that this word could live I mean why did
[1:27:30] he die not just to forgive us of our
[1:27:31] sins but his word would live in you
[1:27:34] hallelujah and I and you should be able
[1:27:37] to say this morning I trust you can
[1:27:38] identify with these things he's talking
[1:27:40] about me I mean he's describing me in
[1:27:43] this generation Alleluia
[1:27:47] he says this come stand with me by my
[1:27:51] side who stands in a terrible place I
[1:27:53] challenge today and I'm going to echo
[1:27:55] his words I challenge today these tapes

[1:28:03] things got to be fulfilled with a
[1:28:05] brethren come stand by my side and pull

[1:28:15] good friend drink of fresh Pentecostal
[1:28:17] water that's his desire today all of it

[1:28:26] Malachi the fourth chapter return the
[1:28:28] faith of the children back to the
[1:28:30] fathers again who would stand this
[1:28:31] morning like David we know that David is
[1:28:34] coming into power Jesus Christ is going
[1:28:36] to take the world here and here it's the
[1:28:38] earth he's going to be king over the
[1:28:39] earth he's rejected today he's a
[1:28:42] fugitive among his people because he's a
[1:28:44] fugitive to the world always was but
[1:28:46] today he's a fugitive to his own church
[1:28:49] they reject them they love their creeds
[1:28:51] and big
[1:28:53] I think they treat instead of the word
[1:28:54] they won't let him be manifested they
[1:28:57] won't let him be manifested they won't
[1:28:59] let him be preached in his power I want
[1:29:02] him to be manifested whatever the enemy
[1:29:04] doesn't want I want they don't want him
[1:29:07] to live I want him to live I want it to
[1:29:10] go beyond just you know I want him to
[1:29:13] manifest through me amen this is the
[1:29:15] this is the promise of Christmas I give
[1:29:17] you a gift of eternal life and it's more
[1:29:21] than just saying yes I accept it you've
[1:29:23] got to accept it but it's going to come
[1:29:24] and live in you wholly the life I now
[1:29:27] live I mean you shall live also
[1:29:30] hallelujah
[1:29:31] I wouldn't they weren't there to be
[1:29:33] preaching as power they have cut away
[1:29:36] from it like the Bible said that do so
[1:29:38] in revelation 17 no I think I'm gonna
[1:29:42] close with this what are they doing
[1:29:44] today going up here today in all going
[1:29:47] in this Council of Churches Catholicism
[1:29:49] Protestantism uniting together making
[1:29:51] the mark an image of the beast and
[1:29:52] Protestants following right for a
[1:29:54] Pentecostal is everywhere Dybbuk trees
[1:29:57] going into Rome from Pentecost and from
[1:29:59] the charismatic movement it's all gone
[1:30:02] amen and coming back saying it's the
[1:30:06] most spiritual place and it takes us
[1:30:08] everywhere else they're opening up and
[1:30:09] giving understanding of the stations and

[1:30:13] being injected to this word oh your

[1:30:40] house of David basically him our Savior
