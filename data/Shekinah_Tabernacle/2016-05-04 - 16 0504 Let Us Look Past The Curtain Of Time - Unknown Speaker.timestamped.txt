[7:01] um if you'd like to turn with me
[7:04] to uh Genesis chapter
[7:09] 8 okay Genesis chapter
[7:13] 8 and I want to read
[7:17] from verse
[7:21] six and it came to pass at the end of 40
[7:24] days that Noah opened the window of the
[7:27] Ark which he had made
[7:30] he sent forth a raven which went to and
[7:32] fro until the waters were dried up from
[7:33] off the Earth also he sent forth a dove
[7:37] from him to see if the waters wereit
[7:40] from off the face of the Earth but the
[7:42] dove found no rest for the soul of her
[7:44] foot and she returned unto him into the
[7:47] ark for the waters were on the face of
[7:49] the whole earth then he put forth his
[7:52] hand and took her and pull her in unto
[7:54] him into the ark and he stayed yet
[7:56] another seven days and again he sent
[7:58] forth the dove out of the Ark and the
[8:01] Dove came into him in the evening and lo
[8:04] in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked
[8:06] off so Noah knew the waters were abated
[8:10] from off the Earth and he stayed yet
[8:12] another seven days and sent forth the
[8:14] dove which return not again into him
[8:19] anymore and I just want to read let's go
[8:21] to Matthew chapter
[8:24] 3 the end of Matthew chapter
[8:28] 3
[8:30] and verse
[8:36] 13 then I want to go A Song of Solomon
[8:40] again then cometh Jesus From Galilee to
[8:43] Jordan unto John to be baptized of him
[8:47] but John forbade him saying I need I
[8:49] have need to be baptized of thee and
[8:51] cometh thou to me and Jesus answered and
[8:54] said unto him suffer it to be so now for
[8:57] thus it becometh us to fulfill La
[8:59] righteousness then he suffered
[9:02] him and Jesus when he was baptized went
[9:05] up straight away out of the water and
[9:06] low the heavens opened unto him and he
[9:09] saw the spirit of God descending like a
[9:11] dove and lightning upon him and L a
[9:13] voice from Heaven saying this is my
[9:15] beloved Son in whom I'm well
[9:18] pleased amen we just go to Song of
[9:20] Solomon Chapter 2
[9:28] again
[9:34] and
[9:37] we'll and we'll read from verse 13 down
[9:40] to verse
[9:46] 14 sorry verse 12 down to verse 14 in
[9:50] Song of Solomon 2 the flowers appear on
[9:53] the earth the time of singing birds has
[9:55] come the voice of the turtle we know
[9:57] that word is the turtle dove is heard in
[9:59] our land the Fig Tree pth forth her
[10:01] green figs and the vines with the tender
[10:04] grape give a good smell Arise My Love My
[10:07] Fair one and come away oh my Dove Thou
[10:10] Art In The Cliffs of The Rock and the
[10:12] secret places of the stairs let me see
[10:15] thy countenance let me hear thy voice
[10:17] for sweet is thy voice and thy
[10:19] countenance is comely amen may the Lord
[10:22] bless his word you may be
[10:23] seated I want
[10:25] to I want to take a I want to read some
[10:29] from Brother
[10:30] brandham Where he
[10:34] related um he he's related going past
[10:39] the curtain of time there in rejected
[10:42] King you know when he was there and he's
[10:45] lying on his bed early in the morning
[10:46] and he wondered what it's like to go
[10:49] into the next world are you just a vapor
[10:51] what's it like and then a voice said to
[10:53] him would you like to see beyond the
[10:54] curtain of time he said it just help me
[10:56] so good and then he was taken instantly
[10:59] ly before he even was aware of it he was
[11:01] out of his body and he was looking down
[11:03] at his
[11:04] body and he was young again he had a
[11:07] full head of hair his green grassy
[11:10] Fields all these sisters in white came
[11:12] to him our precious brother then there's
[11:14] all these other you know men came robed
[11:16] in white again and said our precious
[11:18] brother you know if you had not come we
[11:20] would not be here and you know because
[11:23] he preached the gospel and one was
[11:24] pointed out said you you remember her
[11:26] and and he says no and and he says she
[11:29] was 90 years old when you led her to the
[11:31] Lord and if you didn't go she wouldn't
[11:34] be here and then he said oh where's
[11:37] Jesus I want to see Jesus and then he
[11:39] says uh you know that same voice said to
[11:41] him he's a little bit higher uh you'll
[11:44] go and then they said you'll go and
[11:45] present us to him and then and then um
[11:49] but first you'll be judged for your
[11:51] ministry and then he says well will Paul
[11:54] be judged and and then he said yes and
[11:58] he and and he rejoiced because he
[12:00] preached the same thing Paul preached he
[12:02] says if Paul and his group's accepted my
[12:05] me and my group will be accepted and the
[12:07] people there in Paradise will scream
[12:09] back to him we know we're resting on
[12:11] that
[12:13] Hallelujah and so he said he said after
[12:17] that he said I could never be the same
[12:19] William brandom as I was
[12:21] before and as as he was going back into
[12:25] his body they kept telling him keep keep
[12:27] pressing the battle
[12:29] and he said he words could not describe
[12:31] how great that world is well your words
[12:34] words could not describe how he said
[12:36] it's beyond perfect it's beyond Sublime
[12:39] it's you know it's just it's just words
[12:42] could not describe how great the region
[12:44] of the regions of the Blessed Are and he
[12:47] said whatever you do don't miss that
[12:48] place you need perfect love to get there
[12:51] and if you have the Holy Ghost you have
[12:52] perfect love and then he sings at the
[12:54] end of that way he prays he says know he
[12:57] he sings this song I'm so homesick and
[12:59] blue I want to see Jesus I'd like to
[13:02] hear those sweet Harbor bells chime it
[13:04] would brighten my path it would vanish
[13:06] all fear and he says Lord let us look
[13:10] past the curtain of Time Lord let me
[13:13] look past the curtain of Sorrows and
[13:15] fear let me view that Sunny bright climb
[13:19] it would strengthen our faith and it
[13:21] would vanish all fear he says Lord let
[13:24] them look aast the curtain of
[13:27] time and I was thinking as I just
[13:30] thought about
[13:32] this Noah and this is maybe I just trust
[13:35] a Lord will put this out right but we
[13:37] could just know when he when he said let
[13:40] them look past the c a time I believe he
[13:42] was talking about us because this isn't
[13:44] a prayer he says let's just he said he
[13:46] said let us bow our heads just a moment
[13:48] and he and he and he and he and he
[13:50] recounts the song in prayer he says let
[13:53] them look past the curtain of time if we
[13:55] could just if it would just anchor into
[13:58] our SS just a little bit the place we're
[14:01] going
[14:02] to where Jesus says I trust this mean
[14:07] something to you where Jesus says I go
[14:09] to prepare a place for you and if I do
[14:12] I'll come again and I'll receive you
[14:14] unto myself that where you are you'll be
[14:18] he doesn't say where you are he says
[14:20] where I no say where I am there you'll
[14:22] be in John 14 I go to prepare a place
[14:26] and then Paul in in in second
[14:28] Corinthians chapter 12 he didn't speak
[14:31] of himself but it was himself he says I
[14:33] knew a man I knew a man in Christ above
[14:36] 14 years ago speaking about his own self
[14:39] wherefore in body I cannot tell or
[14:41] whether they out of the body I cannot
[14:43] tell God knoweth such a one caught up
[14:47] into the third heaven so remember
[14:48] there's Heavens there's the atmospheres
[14:50] then there's the second heaven which is
[14:52] the Stars the universe but the third
[14:54] heaven is the heaven that we're going to
[14:56] that is the third heaven so say caught
[14:58] up to the thir third heaven and I knew
[15:00] such a man whether in body or out of
[15:02] body I cannot tell God knoweth how that
[15:04] he was caught up into paradise and heard
[15:07] unspeakable Words which is not lawful
[15:09] for a man to utter of such a one will I
[15:12] Glory yet of myself I'll not Glory but
[15:15] of my infirmities for though I desire to
[15:18] Glory I shall not be a fool for I will
[15:21] say the truth but now I forbear least
[15:24] any man think of me above that which he
[15:26] seeth me to be or that heareth of me and
[15:30] least I be exalted above measure through
[15:32] the abundance of the Revelation that was
[15:34] given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[15:36] messenger of Satan Buffet me I mean
[15:39] sorry it was given to me a thorn on the
[15:41] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[15:43] me Le I should be exalted above measure
[15:47] now Paul was speaking about himself when
[15:49] he says I knew a man he was talking
[15:51] about himself he was taken up into that
[15:54] realm
[15:56] amen and to us
[15:59] to us we have heaven we have a taste of
[16:01] Heaven down here amen we come into the
[16:05] presence of the Lord we come in contact
[16:07] with eternity yet where these time
[16:09] beings you know we we we don't
[16:12] understand all things we don't see all
[16:14] things but yet we see Jesus amen there's
[16:17] a faith that God puts in us that we that
[16:19] we we we we know that that that we're
[16:22] not from this world but we're in this
[16:25] world and we know that God has called us
[16:27] through his word and yet we have
[16:29] struggles we have hardship we have
[16:31] stress and pression and and depression
[16:34] and hardship but yet there's something
[16:36] in us that we long not to be here
[16:40] anymore we have a longing that one day
[16:43] we could just look Pastor curtain a time
[16:46] to know that our Fair's been paid how do
[16:48] you get there Jesus Paid It All Jesus
[16:51] Paid your ticket to get there and then
[16:54] brother Ram says You must have the token
[16:56] which is the life of Jesus the Holy
[16:58] Ghost in you and if you have that then
[17:00] you have what you need to get there you
[17:02] have the ticket in your hand to get on
[17:04] the Gospel Ship to go to the other land
[17:07] Hallelujah you already have what you
[17:09] need to get there and if you have it
[17:11] it's as if as if you're there because
[17:14] you have what you need to get there
[17:17] Hallelujah but if we could just look
[17:19] past a curtain of time now Noah Noah you
[17:23] we sing the song we'll probably sing at
[17:25] the end Noah drifted on the flood many
[17:27] days but he was looking you know he had
[17:31] been through a great disaster it would
[17:33] have been a terrible thing to be it
[17:34] would have been glorious to be in the
[17:35] ark but to hear the sound of outside and
[17:39] to feel it Lift Off the Earth and hear
[17:41] the screams and see that you know just
[17:43] in your mind try and fathom the
[17:46] destruction and no doubt he would have
[17:48] seen a bit of it because the scripture
[17:50] says he was moved with fear he prepared
[17:52] an ark to save the save's family so
[17:55] there would have been a great grip come
[17:57] upon him I've got got to build this Ark
[17:59] God's made a way of Escape but it must
[18:01] be built and he's given me I found Grace
[18:03] in his sight I don't know why but it
[18:05] says says in their Genesis but he found
[18:07] Grace in the sight of the Lord so he
[18:09] didn't deserve it he didn't earn it it
[18:10] was just given to him and he was moved
[18:13] and he built the ark and it would have
[18:15] been an incredible thing to be in there
[18:17] and it would have been amazing to
[18:19] recognize you're in God's provided way
[18:21] but it would have been incredible thing
[18:23] to hear the destruction on the outside
[18:25] so his whole world was destroyed and
[18:28] then he would have been looking for a
[18:29] Deliverance out of this boat when are we
[18:32] going to go back on the land when is it
[18:34] going to you know you know when are we
[18:36] going to build again when are we going
[18:37] to see the new world and he sent a dove
[18:41] and God he you know he sent the crow The
[18:44] Raven I can't remember exactly which one
[18:46] but they're the same type of bird and
[18:48] that one it left and it never came back
[18:50] cuz that's a scavenger it can eat
[18:51] anything but a dove it can't eat where
[18:54] the crow eats it it doesn't have any
[18:56] Gall it can only eat certain things and
[18:58] so that's why the Dove came back and and
[19:01] the second time the Dove came back it
[19:03] had that Olive uh branch in its mouth so
[19:07] it was signifying that by him coming
[19:09] back into the ark it was signifying to
[19:11] Noah your days of suffering in this Ark
[19:13] are over amen he was actually signaling
[19:17] to Noah God was showing Noah the days
[19:20] that you're going to be in this boat is
[19:21] coming to an end and you're going to
[19:23] walk out into a new world
[19:26] Hallelujah and then now
[19:28] but that was just a shadow and then
[19:31] Jesus came who was the bridge between
[19:34] eternity and time he was Jacob's
[19:37] Ladder Jacob was there asleep and he he
[19:40] saw a ladder come down from heaven and
[19:42] angels descending and ascending and
[19:44] there was God on the top of the ladder
[19:46] and you know of course that ladder could
[19:48] not anchor on anchor on Jacob cuz he was
[19:52] an unconverted man even though he was a
[19:54] promised son he was a Believer but then
[19:57] that Jesus
[19:58] God had to become a man that an anchor
[20:00] could anchor on a man and then so the
[20:03] bridge between eternity and time the
[20:05] gulf was was was was
[20:08] bridged and God was signifying when
[20:10] Jesus went down when Jesus was born God
[20:14] was signifying here's eternity man's
[20:17] suffering days have come to an end amen
[20:20] suffering man that would walk in
[20:22] darkness would approach God through the
[20:25] blood of bulls and goats that time was
[20:27] coming to an end
[20:28] amen eternity became flesh and dwelt
[20:32] among us and then now the spirit of God
[20:35] descended upon him like a dove they
[20:38] signifying here is the end of man's
[20:41] suffering Hallelujah we could just look
[20:44] past a c in a time we're 2,000 years
[20:48] down the road and then brother brandham
[20:50] he preached a sermon the wings of a snow
[20:53] white
[20:54] dove and if you look at a prophet's life
[20:57] the they're living out things and
[21:00] they're representing they're actually
[21:02] representing you see you see Abraham was
[21:04] representing something when he took
[21:06] hagga and then he took Sarah the Bond
[21:09] woman and the free woman giving birth of
[21:11] two different lines of children you know
[21:13] two different Sons he was actually
[21:15] playing out a part of God Moses was a
[21:18] God to the people the things he did in
[21:20] his life that was God being played out
[21:22] and so now when a prophet comes upon the
[21:24] Earth you know his life is ordered and
[21:27] God is explain things in his life now if
[21:31] you go back if you go back from this is
[21:34] a 1965 he preaches that sermon if you go
[21:36] back to 1933 now he says the spirit of
[21:39] God descended on the river like a dove
[21:42] was the pillar of fire came back on the
[21:44] Ohio River and when the pillar of fire
[21:46] comes God is doing
[21:49] something when he when he appeared to
[21:51] Moses he was taking he was taking Israel
[21:54] out of bondage their suffering days were
[21:56] over and and they were going to go to a
[21:58] land that belonged to them they weren't
[22:01] going to be uh be under the slave
[22:02] master's whip anymore but they were
[22:04] ordained that they would sit in their
[22:06] Vineyards and they would enjoy the fa
[22:07] land and build houses and live in peace
[22:10] if they walked with God so their days of
[22:13] suffering were over and then now and
[22:16] then now when Jesus came the first time
[22:19] the pillar of fire was there in a man
[22:23] God and flesh and it was signifying the
[22:26] days of suffering Humanity being a slave
[22:29] to sin being a slave to sin nature that
[22:32] was going to be done away with amen
[22:35] because all those in the Old Testament
[22:36] they were still that the blood bus and
[22:39] goats could not undo sin nature so even
[22:41] though they were Believers that sin
[22:43] nature still govern them that's why you
[22:45] see David David was a man after God's
[22:47] Own Heart and we'll and we and we'll
[22:50] Embrace him one day we'll see him over
[22:52] there and he always said I'll not you
[22:54] know he said I kept the Lord ever before
[22:55] me that I sin not against him right the
[22:58] writ his word is always before me and
[23:00] you know but then when he saw bash
[23:02] Sheba uh his because he was unconverted
[23:06] there was nothing in there to keep this
[23:08] flesh in subjection so when he saw bash
[23:11] Sheba he he he committed adultery with
[23:13] her did all those things had had her
[23:15] husband killed all those different
[23:17] things because of sin nature was ruling
[23:19] his life amen but yet he still one of
[23:22] gods but then now this side of Calvary
[23:25] we have something where the life of God
[23:27] comes into you and if you yield yourself
[23:29] to it it'll take control and it will
[23:32] give you dominance over everything of
[23:34] the Flesh and then so Jesus
[23:37] came and that was signifying the end of
[23:40] man's suffering under sin and that's why
[23:44] you know Paul could write and Paul met
[23:45] the same Pillar of Fire and God came and
[23:48] dwelt in him and he began to write how
[23:50] we're no longer you know we shouldn't be
[23:52] a slave to sin anymore and we're free in
[23:55] Christ because he experienced those
[23:57] things
[23:58] and then now we come down 2,000 years
[24:00] down to the end and the pillar of fire
[24:03] appears on the Ohio River and a voice
[24:06] speaks out of it saying as John the
[24:08] Baptist forun the first coming of Christ
[24:10] so your message will forun the second
[24:12] coming and so it was signifying now
[24:15] because you know was signifying God was
[24:17] saying your man's suffering this world's
[24:21] suffering your sin is going to be done
[24:23] away with I mean in terms of there's
[24:26] going to be a wiping off of the Earth
[24:28] there's going to be a time when the
[24:29] millennium's going to come and God's
[24:31] children are going to be resurrected and
[24:33] there's going to be a time of peace upon
[24:34] the Earth and Israel is going to be back
[24:37] in it Homeland and God is going to wind
[24:40] up his plan because we read in
[24:42] Revelations 10 and said he said and he
[24:45] and he cried out with a loud voice those
[24:47] seven voices you know Thunders out of
[24:48] their voices that time should be no more
[24:52] and actually in my mind it says that
[24:54] there shall be no more delay so God is
[24:57] declaring that I'm I'm going to wind up
[24:58] my plan I'm going to burn the devil I'm
[25:02] going to burn all of his minions I'm
[25:04] going to vaporize all of his workings
[25:06] I'm going to restore Eden it's been
[25:09] 2,000 years say now is the end of man's
[25:11] suffering
[25:13] hallelujah amen that that eternity
[25:16] eternity visited the earth once again
[25:18] amen through a through a Ministry of a
[25:21] prophet and so now he was signifying so
[25:24] God was saying just like in Noah you he
[25:27] brought a message on a dove wings of a
[25:28] snow white dove then Jesus came on the
[25:31] wings of a dove eternity came into being
[25:35] in flesh and then now here we are the
[25:38] ministry remember he was to forun the
[25:41] second coming and but you say well
[25:45] brother Brown's Ministry is come and
[25:47] gone isn't he meant to introduce Jesus
[25:50] like John did he did he introduced him
[25:53] as the
[25:53] word amen you read the seven Cal Min um
[25:57] um sermon he says maybe I'm just laying
[25:59] a f a platform for that great one to
[26:02] come and some people take that say I'm
[26:04] him but he but that's not it's not
[26:06] another eighth messenger he's actually
[26:09] saying I'm laying that platform and what
[26:10] who was the platform for he introduced
[26:12] Jesus the word he introduced the lamb to
[26:16] you amen he introduced he introduced the
[26:19] son of man was
[26:21] introduced but in the first coming there
[26:23] are two different bodies but Jesus
[26:26] didn't come have to come in a body flesh
[26:28] to pay the price of redemption it
[26:29] already been done so he took a redeemed
[26:32] son to show what the power of the
[26:34] calvary did he took a redeemed son
[26:36] stepped into that son and revealed
[26:39] himself Hallelujah so then he comes to
[26:42] the end of his ministry and he preaches
[26:44] a sermon on on the wings of a snow white
[26:48] dove and he speaks of when he's he
[26:51] speaks it every seven years in his life
[26:54] this this this terrible stomach sickness
[26:58] would afflict them and even in his
[27:00] ministry he had to go off the field
[27:02] because it was so bad and then he had
[27:05] this he had this I can't remember it was
[27:06] a vision or dream you should go and
[27:07] listen to the sermon there's like this
[27:09] little black squirrel thing and he was a
[27:12] young kid by a tree in this thing jumped
[27:14] off a limb and actually jumped down into
[27:16] his throat and was tearing at his you
[27:18] know you you know you know inside his
[27:20] stomach but then the Lord said don't
[27:22] worry he's only 6 in long so he's going
[27:25] to come to his end
[27:28] and then and then finally he had another
[27:31] dream or vision and he's out there in
[27:34] the desert and the same thing that that
[27:37] that he saw as a boy jumping into him
[27:39] tearing his tummy that same thing jumped
[27:42] off but it fell it it actually missed
[27:44] him fell into a cactus Bush and impaled
[27:47] itself on the
[27:49] thorns and then the Lord told him go up
[27:51] into sabido Canyon and he walks up there
[27:54] and he walks along a path that he knows
[27:56] and he sees that thing
[27:58] he sees that thing
[28:00] dead amen and then he continues walking
[28:05] and he sees a pure Snow White
[28:08] Dove amen and he said so what is what is
[28:13] what is this it's not just a story or a
[28:15] prophet has a vision it's symbolizing
[28:18] now God is telling him your enemy's dead
[28:21] you'll suffer no more from this thing
[28:24] amen right the end of his life
[28:28] and God to me this is just me but to me
[28:30] God is showing now why was the dove
[28:32] there why was he saying now this is the
[28:35] end of your suffering every type of Dove
[28:38] is in the scripture it's symbolizing the
[28:41] end of man's suffering I'm going to do a
[28:44] furtherance of my
[28:45] plan amen he says normally there's no
[28:48] white doves up there you go you go
[28:50] listen or read it very unusual thing he
[28:53] just left it there he recognized God was
[28:56] showing himself something amen and that
[29:00] was the end of his suffering and God was
[29:03] showing to us now through the ministry
[29:05] of of the Prophet this is the end of
[29:08] man's suffering I'm going to put an end
[29:11] of all the works of the enemy he may war
[29:15] against you and try and wear you out and
[29:20] try and destroy you and we live in these
[29:24] bodies and we fight all kinds of things
[29:27] and we think we've won the battle but
[29:29] yet another enemy rears its head and
[29:30] we're going to fight another battle and
[29:32] it seems like just an onward taking one
[29:35] trench and then taking the other trench
[29:38] and going into that bunker and clearing
[29:40] that bunker out like an endless just a
[29:42] Warfare grinding along in the trenches
[29:44] who feels like that sometimes amen but
[29:48] there's an end to it amen there's an end
[29:50] to the suffering there's an end God God
[29:53] is not an author of of of frustration he
[29:56] knows what he's doing but there's an end
[29:59] to all these things if we could just
[30:01] look at where we're going if God would
[30:04] just let us look past the curtain of
[30:07] time amen where he was said the voices
[30:11] said keep pressing the battle if you
[30:14] only and he and he couldn't describe the
[30:16] place but he wanted to describe the
[30:18] place and it's more real than this room
[30:21] you're sitting in it's more real than
[30:23] the body you're in it's more real than
[30:25] your next breath
[30:28] Hallelujah if we could just look past a
[30:30] an eternal place that's been prepared
[30:33] for you think of it when when if you
[30:36] wanted to throw a surprise party for
[30:38] someone you'd make it how they would
[30:40] like it would you not I mean you would
[30:42] prepare it that they would enjoy the
[30:44] place and God knows what you like God
[30:47] knows the kind of places you like to go
[30:49] scenery in nature and mountains or Hills
[30:51] or beaches or whatever it is rugged
[30:55] places and he's prepared it brother says
[30:57] the Millennium will be be it'll have
[30:59] mountains there'll be valleys there'll
[31:01] be deserts cuz some people like deserts
[31:04] some people like mountains some people
[31:05] like plat land some people like all
[31:08] kinds of things because he's prepared a
[31:10] certain way because he knows how people
[31:11] like things amen but the voice this
[31:16] voice that we've heard if you could just
[31:19] I wish I had words but if we could just
[31:21] look past the curtain a
[31:23] Time Amen to recognize our suffering
[31:27] we just have a a few years upon this
[31:31] Earth and if the Lord should take us a

[32:01] few and been has been full of evil
[32:04] basically he hadn't been enjoying you he
[32:06] you know he didn't say there was

[45:01] this the reason you're feeling may be
[45:03] how you're feeling or how God spoke to
[45:07] you and you can always go back to that
[45:10] time I trust you've had that time is

[45:16] because he wants you to recognize you're
[45:19] my son or you're my
[45:21] daughter amen I've laid claim on you and
[45:24] you're coming to be where I
[45:26] am Hallelujah and the works of the enemy

[45:49] mind he doesn't change his mind amen so
[45:53] when he when he chose you before the
[45:55] found foundation of the world he wasn't
[45:58] worried with what you would go through
[46:00] in this little space of time amen that
[46:03] would that that would change his mind
[46:05] that it' actually change his mind
[46:07] halfway through your life oh no actually
[46:09] no I actually can he can't change his
[46:12] God cannot change his
[46:15] thinking God doesn't change his
[46:18] mind
[46:20] amen well you say Well it he said it you
[46:23] know he it said that God you know
[46:26] repented that even made man he wasn't
[46:29] wishing I wish I never made man he was
[46:32] just sad in how they ended
[46:34] up

[46:39] he told Moses Moses I'll wipe out Israel
[46:42] and I'll start with you and he said no
[46:46] and then Moses said no block my name out
[46:47] of the book they actually said God
[46:51] repented he he didn't change his mind he
[46:53] knew Moses would do that
[46:56] amen he knew Moses would throw himself
[46:58] in the breach so he was doing that to
[47:01] see what is in you
[47:03] Moses amen what is in you Moses I'm
[47:07] going to show you what's in you
[47:09] Moses

[47:40] you know what's my 5ye plan all those
[47:42] things are good we should have a plan
[47:46] but don't be so caught up in in that
[47:49] little space that you lose sight of
[47:52] really where you're
[47:53] going whatever you do
[47:56] don't get so because if you just get
[47:58] caught up in natural things then the
[48:00] pressures of Life can wear you down sure

[48:05] have hardship and we'll have stress
[48:07] we'll have burdens that's all part of
[48:09] living but if you keep your eyes on the
[48:12] wrong thing if you keep your eyes on the
[48:14] burdens and the stress then they can
[48:16] wear you down but if you keep your eyes
[48:18] on Eternal things then then he'll give
[48:21] you the strength to go through those
[48:23] things amen you got to know whom you

[48:28] why I always just pray Lord let us look
[48:31] past the curtain the
[48:33] time every day if we could just see that
[48:37] place that's if we could really just
[48:39] have a
[48:40] glimmer and in a way we do when we feel
[48:42] his presence we have a glimmer of that
[48:44] place CU we know it's not just our mind
[48:46] working this out it's not just us trying
[48:48] to live a certain way but
[48:50] God and he actually reinforces I'm in
[48:54] control everything's going going to be
