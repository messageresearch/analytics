[13:21] praise the lord how you're feeling good
[13:24] okay let's um let's stand this morning
[13:26] and let's commit the service to the lord

[13:30] we're going to have a good time this
[13:31] morning welcome to all those that are
[13:33] streaming in
[13:34] we are
[13:36] sad that you can't all we can't all be
[13:38] here together but we make it work this
[13:39] is how life works we just we press on we
[13:41] make it work so um
[13:43] we're going to have a great time

[13:48] you are as well
[13:50] the lord is good he's omnipresent
[13:51] meaning he's here and everywhere at the
[13:53] same time that's the
[13:54] that's the nature of god you know we
[13:57] that's why he could you know it was it
[13:59] was better for the lord to go away
[14:01] because he said if i go i can i can
[14:02] actually then be everywhere when he was
[14:04] here on earth he was just in one place
[14:05] at one time but then he could because
[14:07] he's omnipresent the almighty god he can
[14:09] be at all places
[14:11] at one time which is
[14:14] mind-boggling but that's god
[14:17] but a god that can create a universe
[14:19] like he has i'm sure he's got a method
[14:21] of being everywhere at the same time

[53:28] the clothes yet good now daniel 11 and
[53:31] 32
[53:33] says here
[53:37] and such as do wickedly against the
[53:39] covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries
[53:42] but the people now he's talking about
[53:44] you and i but the people that know their
[53:46] god shall be strong and do exploits
[53:49] hallelujah i like that they shall be
[53:51] strong it's not they might be they will
[53:53] be they shall be like i think brother
[53:55] paul said on wednesday shall is a lot
[53:57] stronger than you will
[53:58] amen shall amen so you may be seated
[54:02] this morning god bless you may the lord
[54:04] bless the reading of his word i'd like
[54:05] to continue on so i've got a few
[54:08] uh i just trust this comes out right
[54:10] because you just think about just the
[54:12] power of the the potency of the word of
[54:14] god in this last days where god is
[54:16] bringing your people to the full
[54:18] manifestation you know today you know
[54:20] now we are the sons of god not we'll
[54:23] we'll be one day right today we are the
[54:25] sons of god and i want to so we went
[54:27] last sunday we went through the process
[54:29] of of god removing the stony heart so
[54:32] you know that stony heart you can't get
[54:34] nowhere with god you know your human
[54:35] reasoning is exalted above the word of
[54:38] god but then he gives you a heart of
[54:39] flesh so your heart is you can be molded
[54:42] and shaped by the word of god you
[54:43] believe yes the word is true but then he
[54:45] gives you a new spirit because you can't
[54:48] even you know with the spirit you're
[54:49] born with you know you can't even get
[54:51] along with yourself or your neighbor or
[54:52] your family where you're fighting
[54:53] fussing whatever more and he gives you a
[54:56] new spirit he delivers you from smoking
[54:58] drinking habits of the world whatever it
[55:00] is but that but that's not the final end
[55:02] is that then he puts his spirit within
[55:05] the middle of that new spirit and by the
[55:07] holy ghost within you he causes you to
[55:10] walk in his word
[55:11] amen so
[55:13] what a tremendous power that is when we
[55:15] realize when we've received the holy
[55:17] ghost as jesus is the christian on the
[55:19] inside of us it's not us trying to be a
[55:21] christian us trying to live the
[55:23] christian life but he is the christian
[55:25] on the inside of us but then he says and
[55:27] you shall dwell in the land of your
[55:29] fathers so you will return back to the
[55:32] land of your fathers now we know when we
[55:34] speak of land here we're not speaking of
[55:36] a physical geographical location uh in
[55:39] the old testament we understand that it
[55:42] was speaking of the promised land but
[55:44] the old testament is a shadow of the new
[55:46] and so
[55:47] we know that the land that is spoken of
[55:49] here is actually the baptism of the holy
[55:52] ghost the promises we have in the lord
[55:54] as the apostle paul would take he would
[55:56] parallel the journey that israel would
[55:58] have in hebrews three and four he will i
[56:00] know you know these things but i just
[56:01] want to keep it in front of you because
[56:03] many people they think well the old
[56:05] testament it's all past is there's no
[56:07] point reading it no more it doesn't
[56:08] apply but the apostle paul would tell
[56:11] timothy that all scripture is inspired
[56:13] for doctrine for correction for reproof
[56:16] all scripture i mean so he did not say
[56:18] just the new testament now he says no
[56:20] all scripture so all scripture applies
[56:23] and we can see in the old testament as
[56:24] the shadow and the new testament is the
[56:26] reality so where ezekiel is saying you
[56:28] shall dwell in the land of your fathers
[56:31] he's saying that you shall return to a
[56:32] place where your fathers dwelt and they
[56:34] occupied and so now we're living in a
[56:37] time where the land that we've returned
[56:39] to is
[56:40] entering into christ in reality
[56:43] where we're no longer just going to
[56:44] church and going through the motions but
[56:45] you really meet the lord you enter into
[56:48] a new dwelling place and then you enter
[56:50] into a new you enter into into an
[56:52] eternal rest
[56:53] amen so so so the land that our fathers
[56:56] dwelt in is is the original pentecostal
[56:59] book of acts land
[57:01] i mean of the holy ghost this is where
[57:03] he says you shall dwell he's not saying
[57:05] that you'll dwell in another place or a
[57:07] modern kind of trend of the way he says
[57:09] no you will dwell in the land of your
[57:10] fathers i mean so if we look into the
[57:12] land of our fathers we can see the power
[57:15] of god living in their lives i mean it
[57:17] wasn't just a new religious thought it
[57:20] wasn't just changing their religious um
[57:23] you know religious belief system but it
[57:25] was a birth into a kingdom i mean it was
[57:27] a transforming power came into their
[57:29] lives and changed their thinking change
[57:31] their outlook changed their nature amen
[57:33] where peter was once a cow that ran from
[57:35] from the testimony of a woman and some
[57:37] other people when he was you know out of
[57:40] you're outside jesus and pilate's
[57:42] judgment hall he's warming himself by
[57:43] the fire and people come to him one
[57:45] after aren't you one of them aren't you
[57:48] an apostle uh you know even your speech
[57:50] your you know your accent betrays you're
[57:52] a galilean and he would deny the lord
[57:55] thrice as the lord told them to do but
[57:57] just that little bit of pressure he ran
[57:59] he cursed and denied the lord so he
[58:01] needed he needed to enter into this land
[58:04] and so when he entered into this land he
[58:05] could stand boldly on the day of
[58:06] pentecost and preach the first ever
[58:08] church service
[58:09] you have crucified the very messiah you
[58:12] know and you know he would he would he
[58:13] would preach that and then he would
[58:14] stand before the sanhedrin and he wasn't
[58:16] bowed by them
[58:18] where before a few days before that he
[58:19] was he was bowed just by a man or a
[58:21] woman giving ask him aren't you one of
[58:23] them but now he's standing before the
[58:25] same ones that crucified the messiah he
[58:27] says what shall we do should we please
[58:29] god or man you tell us
[58:31] amen and and you know he was beaten they
[58:33] just went away rejoicing i mean the more
[58:35] they are afflicted they just praise god
[58:37] hallelujah so why because so this is the
[58:40] land of our fathers where they would not
[58:42] bow or compromise amen to the popular
[58:46] opinion of the day they stay true to the
[58:48] word
[58:49] hallelujah you see signs wonders
[58:51] miracles done that was the land they
[58:53] dwelt in
[58:54] amen hallelujah now we'll probably go
[58:57] into that at another time but that's a
[58:58] yo we live in a powerful amazing place
[59:01] the believer does right now amen it's
[59:03] just not a place of theology it's not a
[59:06] place of just reasoning amen but it's
[59:08] almighty god pouring himself into you
[59:10] and i that his word is manifested out of
[59:13] our lives
[59:14] hallelujah
[59:16] amen so now if we're going to dwell on
[59:18] that land now if the land is christ
[59:20] which it is the anointed word that lives
[59:22] in us then we we we will be his people
[59:26] amen we're not a different people we
[59:28] become his people now what i love about
[59:31] the you know the plan of redemption
[59:34] where god in his great grace
[59:37] you know actually allowed the jews to be
[59:40] blinded that we could come in where
[59:42] originally we were not part of the
[59:43] original covenant we weren't we didn't
[59:45] even come into the equation
[59:47] but where god is there is always a way
[59:49] of grace to whosoever will and so he
[59:52] allowed he allowed the jews to be
[59:54] blinded that us gentiles who weren't
[59:56] even in his covenant could come in
[59:58] hallelujah you know he would he would be
[1:00:00] he would allow himself to be forsaken by
[1:00:02] the ones he was meant to come to that
[1:00:04] you and i could have a chance
[1:00:06] amen and you know when it's all said and
[1:00:08] done and the jews eyes come open it'll
[1:00:10] be like it'll be like joseph and his
[1:00:13] brethren when joseph reveals himself to
[1:00:15] his brethren and they're crying out this
[1:00:17] great wailing and going on they've
[1:00:18] realized that the one that they sold as
[1:00:20] a slave the one they hated and despised
[1:00:22] and were jealous i mean was the very one
[1:00:24] that saved their lives and now had
[1:00:26] revealed them reveal themselves to them
[1:00:29] and he said don't be angry don't be sad
[1:00:31] god allowed this that life would be
[1:00:33] preserved amen so one day the very one
[1:00:36] that they said crucify him away with
[1:00:37] this man they'll realize he was the very
[1:00:39] one that would deliver them the very one
[1:00:41] that was their messiah and he would say
[1:00:43] don't cry no more it's all over you did
[1:00:46] this your forebears did this that life
[1:00:47] could be saved and the life that he
[1:00:50] saved it wasn't just some abstract
[1:00:51] person so it was me
[1:00:53] hallelujah it was you it was me amen god
[1:00:56] allowed that for me to come in
[1:00:58] hallelujah
[1:01:00] amen where paul would write in romans 9
[1:01:03] if you want to put it up romans 9 and 23
[1:01:07] he says
[1:01:08] he says this here we should never let
[1:01:09] these things come common
[1:01:11] we live in a great land
[1:01:13] a land flowing with milk and honey a
[1:01:15] land flowing with healing and
[1:01:17] deliverance amen a peace that passes
[1:01:19] understanding amen
[1:01:22] we're a real shepherd dwells amen
[1:01:24] that'll guide you through the darkest of
[1:01:25] ours where you don't know the way to go
[1:01:27] he knows the way he'll lead you through
[1:01:29] that way you may think all is lost but
[1:01:31] he says nothing's lost amen i'll see you
[1:01:34] through just keep your eyes on the
[1:01:36] shepherd keep your eyes on the word you
[1:01:38] may say that there's no hope yes there's
[1:01:40] hope amen with the lord there's always
[1:01:42] hope
[1:01:44] hallelujah we have a we have a real
[1:01:46] shepherd
[1:01:47] amen he's not a hiring that quits when
[1:01:49] stuff gets
[1:01:50] tough and hard no he's among his sheep
[1:01:53] he's among his sheep this morning i mean
[1:01:55] he's with you in the storm don't ever
[1:01:56] think he's too far away don't ever think
[1:01:59] he's forgotten you he can't forget
[1:02:01] israel i mean he can't forget you
[1:02:04] he says even a woman that's had a child
[1:02:06] can forget a child but i cannot forget
[1:02:07] you and i don't understand how a woman
[1:02:09] could ever forget having
[1:02:11] birthing a child to the earth
[1:02:14] he says yet it's possible but yet i
[1:02:16] cannot forget
[1:02:17] amen romans 9 and 23 and that he may
[1:02:20] make known unto the sorry
[1:02:22] and that he might make known the riches
[1:02:25] of his glory on the vessels of mercy
[1:02:27] which he had for prepared unto glory
[1:02:29] he's talking about you
[1:02:31] are you a vessel of mercy this morning i
[1:02:34] mean that's what you've been made for
[1:02:35] that's why you've been fashioned for
[1:02:37] irrespective of your troubles and you
[1:02:39] may hate your own personality and you
[1:02:41] don't fit in different things but you're
[1:02:42] still a vessel prepared for mercy you're
[1:02:44] not a vessel made for wrath
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:49] hallelujah even us whom he hath called
[1:02:52] not of the jews only but also the
[1:02:53] gentiles as he saith also an osi which
[1:02:56] is hosea i will call them my people
[1:02:59] which were not my people and her beloved
[1:03:02] which was not beloved she should say
[1:03:04] this morning i'm beloved
[1:03:06] i'm his beloved
[1:03:08] hallelujah once upon a time i wasn't but
[1:03:10] now i am i mean by the blood of jesus
[1:03:12] christ i'm his beloved
[1:03:15] i mean all of his love has been poured
[1:03:17] out upon me i mean not just some
[1:03:19] trinkling gift like some girlfriend he's
[1:03:21] flirting with no his wife
[1:03:22] all that he is he's poured in
[1:03:25] i mean all of heaven is behind you all
[1:03:27] the jesus is behind you hallelujah he's
[1:03:30] not just putting you on some limb
[1:03:31] somewhere seeing if he'll make it
[1:03:32] through he's determined i remember the
[1:03:34] people that know their god shall be
[1:03:36] strong
[1:03:37] and do exploits you say i'm weak in
[1:03:39] faith no the word says you're strong you
[1:03:42] shall be strong hallelujah
[1:03:46] amen and her beloved wishes not beloved
[1:03:48] and it shall come to pass that in that
[1:03:50] place where it was said unto them they
[1:03:52] are not my people there shall they be
[1:03:54] called the children of the living god
[1:03:57] hallelujah so we were so once upon a
[1:04:00] time we were not his people but god and
[1:04:02] his grateful knowledge says they shall
[1:04:04] be my people i'll take a people that
[1:04:06] would ever part of the covenant or the
[1:04:07] promises and they shall be my people and
[1:04:10] i will be their god hallelujah this is
[1:04:12] part of being in the land of our fathers
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:15] amen
[1:04:17] hallelujah now this word dwell this is
[1:04:20] going back to ezekiel where we read here
[1:04:22] in verse 28 now this word dwell
[1:04:25] has a very rich and diverse meaning if
[1:04:27] you look in the strong's concordance
[1:04:29] it means properly it means it means to
[1:04:31] sit down
[1:04:33] specifically as judge
[1:04:35] in ambush and quiet now we could spend
[1:04:38] some time here so we're here to judge
[1:04:43] because every it's it because what are
[1:04:45] we to judge judge righteous judgment
[1:04:48] that's not judgment jesus said judge not
[1:04:51] lest you be judged right that means
[1:04:53] judgment to condemnation but he also
[1:04:56] says judge righteous judgment he won't
[1:04:58] say two things that conflict you need
[1:04:59] the understanding that's why people say
[1:05:01] oh don't judge jesus said don't judge
[1:05:03] they don't have the understanding
[1:05:05] because that's why if he said that and
[1:05:07] he meant it that way he would never have
[1:05:08] said judge righteous judgment
[1:05:11] right so we've been given discernment
[1:05:13] to judge between right and wrong
[1:05:16] to judge between right and nearly
[1:05:19] right
[1:05:21] right remember eve the whole world fell
[1:05:24] into this
[1:05:25] sin trap that we're in
[1:05:27] because the serpent the devil anointed
[1:05:30] the serpent and he changed the scripture
[1:05:31] just by one word or two it was mostly
[1:05:34] truth so it was nearly right but it was
[1:05:37] wrong
[1:05:39] right
[1:05:40] but we we if we have the mind of christ
[1:05:42] today if you have the holy truly have
[1:05:44] the holy ghost you have the mind of
[1:05:45] christ the mind of the word then you can
[1:05:48] judge amen you can judge between right
[1:05:52] and nearly right
[1:05:53] not just right and wrong amen
[1:05:56] and then so to sit down especially as
[1:05:59] judge
[1:06:00] we have to judge the devil a liar
[1:06:03] oh don't be against the no no we're
[1:06:06] against the devil the prophet says he
[1:06:07] hates me and i hate him we're allowed to
[1:06:09] hate someone
[1:06:11] that's the devil we don't hate people
[1:06:14] right
[1:06:15] we never hold anything against a person
[1:06:17] it's a spirit in the person that's the
[1:06:19] bad thing
[1:06:20] right so we have to be able to judge him
[1:06:22] a liar
[1:06:23] where's that thought coming from that
[1:06:25] makes you feel withdrawn and down and
[1:06:27] depressed that's not god filling your
[1:06:28] mind with that you're gonna be able to
[1:06:30] judge where the thought comes from it
[1:06:32] should be able to come through a filter
[1:06:34] is this drawing me closer to the lord is
[1:06:36] it making me love her more does it make
[1:06:37] me love my brothers and sisters more
[1:06:39] does it make me appreciate them more or
[1:06:41] does it make me feel withdrawn and i
[1:06:42] don't fit
[1:06:44] that second part is not god
[1:06:47] we should be able to judge those things
[1:06:48] in ambush
[1:06:50] we ambush the devil quite regularly
[1:06:53] he gets ambushed in church
[1:06:55] he comes along thinking that he's going
[1:06:57] to take over and just the whole thing's
[1:06:58] going to go to nothing but then the god
[1:07:01] sets a trap where we're going to praise
[1:07:02] god god comes down he gets cast out
[1:07:05] there's an ambush going on maybe i
[1:07:07] shouldn't have told him that but he's
[1:07:08] been in too many of them but he's a
[1:07:09] creature of habit he never learns from
[1:07:11] his mistakes
[1:07:12] amen
[1:07:13] now by implication this word dwell uh by
[1:07:16] obligation to dwell means to remain
[1:07:19] you're going to remain in this place
[1:07:21] you're not going to be cast away
[1:07:22] speaking of being if you're sealed into
[1:07:24] the holy ghost you can't be unsealed
[1:07:26] right this is the land we dwell in
[1:07:29] um it's cause actively it's to settle or
[1:07:33] to marry
[1:07:34] hallelujah so there's gonna be a uniting
[1:07:38] you're gonna dwell in this land there's
[1:07:39] gonna be uniting in this land
[1:07:41] it's not just uh well i'm just living
[1:07:43] here and taking occupying time in this
[1:07:45] this religion no no you're being united
[1:07:48] hallelujah being united
[1:07:51] not to a church
[1:07:53] not to a religious thought not to a
[1:07:55] bunch of doctrine this is not what this
[1:07:56] is about it's being united to the
[1:07:59] resurrected lord jesus christ the living
[1:08:01] word
[1:08:02] paulus he says you shall dwell here you
[1:08:05] shall get married
[1:08:07] in this land
[1:08:08] hallelujah there's a uniting i'm doing
[1:08:10] this because i want you see you're not
[1:08:12] one and not two you become one
[1:08:15] and between you and god there's no
[1:08:16] separation you actually just merging to
[1:08:18] the other
[1:08:20] if i could do that i could that my
[1:08:21] fingers stick together and they become
[1:08:22] one finger because you and god become
[1:08:24] one
[1:08:25] hallelujah so it means to it means to
[1:08:28] marry
[1:08:29] so there's a uniting going on
[1:08:32] in this land amen hallelujah
[1:08:35] now
[1:08:37] brother brown would preach invisible
[1:08:38] union of the bride as a thanksgiving
[1:08:40] message he comes down towards the end of
[1:08:42] his message
[1:08:44] and he and he and and he says well you
[1:08:46] may say what has all this got to do with
[1:08:48] thanksgiving
[1:08:49] what you talking about brother branham
[1:08:51] it's quarter to nine you didn't say
[1:08:53] nothing about thanksgiving he says what
[1:08:55] a message for the occasion to me yes
[1:08:57] indeed he says the pilgrim fathers were
[1:09:00] very thankful for the newfound way of
[1:09:02] life that's the ones that came from the
[1:09:03] old world and they came to america being
[1:09:05] separated from the old english
[1:09:07] denominations and creed they could marry
[1:09:09] to the new anointed word of their age
[1:09:11] that's right the new anointed word of
[1:09:13] their age for their day
[1:09:15] i mean so we can be thankful as pilgrims
[1:09:17] like abraham separated ourselves from
[1:09:18] all things of the world all of our
[1:09:20] associates abraham was a pilgrim god had
[1:09:23] separated us from all the dead religions
[1:09:25] i'm speaking across the nation now all
[1:09:26] the dead creeds to what separate us and
[1:09:29] open to us a new land
[1:09:31] a new message for this day so he says
[1:09:33] that the pilgrim fathers they left their
[1:09:35] old all the all the oppression of the
[1:09:37] old world's religious systems and they
[1:09:39] came to a new world to be united to the
[1:09:42] word
[1:09:43] i mean because they came for freedom of
[1:09:44] religion that's why they moved if i can
[1:09:46] say that word they just move across the
[1:09:49] atlantic and they settled right so we
[1:09:50] can rejoice as well because we have left
[1:09:54] unbelief
[1:09:55] we have left unbelief in the word we
[1:09:57] have left reasoning against the word we
[1:09:59] have left the world right we have left
[1:10:02] its systems we've
[1:10:04] left it's religion
[1:10:06] it may be atheism as gnosticism whatever
[1:10:08] ism we left it
[1:10:10] he says you don't you're not meant to
[1:10:12] dwell in those things
[1:10:14] you're not meant to dwell in some formal
[1:10:16] religious setting
[1:10:18] that's not your dwelling place i want to
[1:10:20] marry you
[1:10:21] i want to unite myself with you i'm
[1:10:24] going to bring you to this land bring
[1:10:25] you into the holy ghost that you'd be
[1:10:27] united with me
[1:10:29] hallelujah so we can say what a
[1:10:30] thanksgiving
[1:10:32] this is not thanksgiving actually every
[1:10:33] day is a thanksgiving when you meet the
[1:10:35] lord jesus christ every day is a
[1:10:37] thanksgiving thank you lord for saving
[1:10:39] me thank you lord for making me whole
[1:10:42] thank you lord for healing my broken
[1:10:43] spirit thank you lord for guiding me
[1:10:46] thank you lord for teaching me thank you
[1:10:48] lord for keeping me in the way thank you
[1:10:50] lord for saving me thank you lord for
[1:10:52] washing me of all my past i have no
[1:10:54] baggage it got destroyed
[1:10:56] hallelujah you know
[1:10:58] i don't know anyone who's ever traveled
[1:11:00] through an airport and been rejoicing
[1:11:02] that their baggage got lost
[1:11:04] you never see happy people at the
[1:11:06] baggage claim counter
[1:11:07] hello how are you i've been on a flight
[1:11:09] for 58 hours and my baggage isn't here
[1:11:13] i'm so happy today i've never seen that
[1:11:15] it's always frowns and you know
[1:11:18] but they traveled from one place to
[1:11:19] another and their baggage got lost
[1:11:21] sometimes it doesn't turn back up again
[1:11:25] you know i remember we
[1:11:26] flew this is where my parents were in
[1:11:27] american samoa and it was like this
[1:11:30] pencil plane from american samoa to
[1:11:32] western somalia to get a plane to new
[1:11:33] zealand you had to get weighed yourself
[1:11:36] to be allocated on this pencil plane it
[1:11:38] wasn't just the baggage you got way
[1:11:39] because i had to divvy up the weight and
[1:11:41] one time i flew into up here and um no i
[1:11:45] oh i think maybe it was when we checked
[1:11:46] and wherever it's like where's my bag oh
[1:11:48] you'll get it the next day i'll turn up
[1:11:50] to new zealand the next day
[1:11:52] that's my whole life in that bag
[1:11:54] all my clothes all i was was in that bag
[1:11:56] and uh and and he just said no it'll
[1:11:58] it'll come later
[1:12:00] thank you
[1:12:01] it was not the next day's a few days
[1:12:03] after that but you know in case of being
[1:12:06] a believer
[1:12:07] the lord gets a hold of you you move
[1:12:10] you get translated into the kingdom of
[1:12:11] his dear son by the blood of jesus
[1:12:13] christ you're once in one place
[1:12:16] in sin thinking you were the king and
[1:12:18] you knew what you were doing you had it
[1:12:20] all figured out and man had the best
[1:12:22] opinion and this is you know there's
[1:12:23] nothing to it to god or whatever more
[1:12:25] but then god said no no you're not meant
[1:12:27] to be there i'm going to move you i've
[1:12:29] even given you a passport to travel
[1:12:32] hallelujah you may not have realized it
[1:12:34] but you had it in your face to travel
[1:12:36] amen and then but then in the process of
[1:12:38] moving when you get to this new land
[1:12:40] there's no baggage claim counter
[1:12:42] because it gets destroyed it's not just
[1:12:44] left behind it's gone
[1:12:45] amen in the blood of jesus christ
[1:12:48] hallelujah so this kind of travel it's
[1:12:50] good when your baggage goes missing and
[1:12:52] we don't go claiming it either who wants
[1:12:54] their pass back
[1:12:56] i'm glad people are a bit quicker off
[1:12:58] the trigger this sunday
[1:13:00] oh they're paying attention yes see
[1:13:02] because the blood takes care of it
[1:13:04] doesn't just cover it up it's not just
[1:13:05] putting a back shed of god's memory and
[1:13:07] then pulled out when it's inconvenient
[1:13:09] no the blood annihilates it
[1:13:11] it's gone
[1:13:13] where did it go there's like you had a
[1:13:14] lot of baggage
[1:13:15] it's in the blood the seed of his
[1:13:17] forgetfulness
[1:13:18] and the scripture says that the sea is
[1:13:20] so deep even the adders can't get down
[1:13:21] to the bottom of it so the devil can't
[1:13:23] even he may try and swim in there he
[1:13:25] can't get down to where it is
[1:13:26] it's gone
[1:13:28] he'll just drown himself hopefully blow
[1:13:29] up with the pressure
[1:13:31] you know why not let them implode down
[1:13:33] there in the darkness
[1:13:34] see you later bye you know so we can
[1:13:36] rejoice talk about a thanksgiving
[1:13:39] amen we've been moved
[1:13:41] hallelujah and the baggage of sin and
[1:13:43] our past is gone it may be in our minds
[1:13:45] but you got to remember we we cannot we
[1:13:48] should not let a memory torment us
[1:13:50] i mean we should not let a memory
[1:13:52] torment us even though maybe the emotion
[1:13:54] comes back it's so real and no it's been
[1:13:56] done it's been dealt with
[1:13:58] holy just like the israelites after they
[1:14:00] crossed the red sea they were still
[1:14:02] carrying slave yo whip marks scars on
[1:14:05] their backs
[1:14:06] and maybe maybe when they saw them or
[1:14:08] felt them or saw them on maybe their
[1:14:10] loved ones that maybe could have brought
[1:14:11] the emotion back
[1:14:12] of of of the beatings and the trauma
[1:14:15] but then they then those let their mind
[1:14:18] wander a bit further
[1:14:19] where they came to a sea and they
[1:14:21] thought we're actually going to get
[1:14:23] massacred and god brought them there
[1:14:25] because god wanted to destroy their
[1:14:26] baggage their baggage was alive their
[1:14:29] tormentors were very much alive but he
[1:14:30] wanted them dead
[1:14:31] amen so he brought them there and he had
[1:14:34] moses raise up his staff and the sea
[1:14:36] parted and they journeyed over and it
[1:14:38] wasn't just for them to journey over and
[1:14:40] then the cedar you know it closed in the
[1:14:42] egyptians be on the one side no no god
[1:14:44] set up an ambush
[1:14:46] hallelujah we think the devil's on our
[1:14:47] case it's actually an ambush against him
[1:14:50] i mean you have trouble in your life a
[1:14:52] spirit troubling you it's actually an
[1:14:54] ambush
[1:14:55] that that thing's going to be killed out
[1:14:56] of your life i mean then they cross the
[1:14:58] israelites cross and the devil thinks i
[1:15:00] can cross too if they can do it i can do
[1:15:02] it and he comes to the right part of the
[1:15:04] sea and god just says raise your staff
[1:15:05] and then the sea comes over them and
[1:15:08] they all drown
[1:15:09] hallelujah and it's like your sin and
[1:15:11] the blood of jesus christ amen you
[1:15:13] should be able to stand on the riverbank
[1:15:15] and look back and see your dead sin
[1:15:17] drowned in the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:19] hallelujah it's dead
[1:15:21] it's gone
[1:15:23] hallelujah
[1:15:24] and so all you can be tormented by now
[1:15:26] is a memory
[1:15:28] but remember the devil always says
[1:15:30] remember this bit
[1:15:32] the most traumatic painful bit you say
[1:15:34] no devil devil let's just fast for the
[1:15:36] tape this much because this is where the
[1:15:39] torment pain happened but this is where
[1:15:40] you got drowned
[1:15:42] hallelujah and then what's the next part
[1:15:44] of that me rejoicing over your defeat
[1:15:47] hallelujah let's just let's just replay
[1:15:49] that bit a whole bunch
[1:15:51] sit here satan i'll give you some
[1:15:52] popcorn watch this
[1:15:53] you know he remembers it you need to
[1:15:55] remind him though because he's nothing
[1:15:57] but a bluff
[1:15:59] amen you've got to remind the devil that
[1:16:01] he got defeated
[1:16:03] that day
[1:16:04] hallelujah amen because we've got to
[1:16:07] remind satan we need to if you have no
[1:16:09] one to testify to and you're feeling
[1:16:11] down testify to the devil say devil
[1:16:14] you're giving me this you're you're
[1:16:16] making me feel this way so i'm going to
[1:16:18] tell you a few things hallelujah there's
[1:16:21] a time you know that time you you once
[1:16:23] ruled my life but i gave my life to the
[1:16:26] lord jesus christ and you got dethroned
[1:16:29] and then to show you and all of hell and
[1:16:31] all of heaven whose side i'm on i went
[1:16:32] and got baptized in the name of my
[1:16:34] redeemer the lord jesus christ i took on
[1:16:36] a new name do you remember that day i do
[1:16:38] it was great
[1:16:40] hallelujah i even got a video look what
[1:16:42] happened
[1:16:43] hallelujah amen and do you remember
[1:16:45] satan amen where where there was that
[1:16:48] meeting i was in and god filled me with
[1:16:50] the holy ghost
[1:16:52] changed me forever you remember that day
[1:16:54] you got sealed out and i got sealed into
[1:16:57] the kingdom
[1:16:58] hallelujah i tell you what you just
[1:17:00] start to remind the devil of all the
[1:17:02] things god has done for you
[1:17:04] you won't be sad anymore
[1:17:07] hallelujah
[1:17:08] amen so we can rejoice because we have
[1:17:10] been united amen to the lord jesus
[1:17:14] christ just like he said the pilgrim
[1:17:16] fathers could be united i mean to the
[1:17:18] anointed word for their age which is the
[1:17:20] lord jesus so we can say what a
[1:17:21] thanksgiving i mean we have been united
[1:17:24] to the living word in this day remember
[1:17:26] jesus is the word
[1:17:27] he's not just like you know the girls
[1:17:30] watch um they used to watch a lot of
[1:17:32] they still do but you know like
[1:17:34] children's cartoon um christian
[1:17:37] cartoon stories of the bible on youtube
[1:17:40] and jesus is like this hippie guy
[1:17:41] walking on the shores of galilee oh come
[1:17:44] here that's all right yeah love everyone
[1:17:46] you know but there's just one very one
[1:17:48] dimension like this hippie laid back
[1:17:49] jesus i don't think he's necessarily all
[1:17:51] that way all the time
[1:17:53] but we're not just united too
[1:17:56] but many people say oh i'm united to
[1:17:58] that guy and here's the word there but
[1:18:00] this is the word here
[1:18:02] you can't you can't divide jesus in the
[1:18:04] word because they are the same
[1:18:06] amen so there's a uniting
[1:18:08] that's a writer
[1:18:10] jesus is the word why we we want to
[1:18:12] become one with the word
[1:18:14] amen amen and so
[1:18:17] in the old testament this was shown now
[1:18:19] i um i have the uh where where the
[1:18:22] apostle paul speaks about in hebrews
[1:18:24] chapter 9 if you want to put up hebrews
[1:18:26] 9 and 17 but it's in the book of exodus
[1:18:28] where where after after moses received
[1:18:31] the law
[1:18:33] and he read it to the people
[1:18:35] he took the blood of bulls and goats
[1:18:38] and he sprinkled the book
[1:18:40] and he sprinkled the people and he
[1:18:42] sprinkled all of the um oh let's just
[1:18:45] read it here hebrews uh sorry uh verse
[1:18:49] 17. we go down to verse 17 of hebrews 9.
[1:18:52] for a testament is a force after men are
[1:18:55] dead otherwise it is of no strength at
[1:18:57] all while the test data liveth
[1:18:59] whereupon neither the first testament
[1:19:01] was dedicated without blood
[1:19:03] for when moses had spoken every precept
[1:19:06] to all the people according to the law
[1:19:08] he took the blood of cows and of goats
[1:19:10] with water and scarlet wool and hyssop
[1:19:12] and sprinkled both the book and all the
[1:19:15] people
[1:19:17] saying this is the blood of the
[1:19:18] testament
[1:19:19] which god hath enjoined unto you
[1:19:22] he says moreover he sprinkled with blood
[1:19:24] both the tabernacle the vessels of the
[1:19:25] ministry and almost all things are by
[1:19:28] the law purged with blood
[1:19:30] and without shedding of blood there is
[1:19:32] no remission so he read the
[1:19:35] law the word if i can do this
[1:19:37] and he took the blood
[1:19:39] and the
[1:19:40] and this and you know the different
[1:19:41] elements he mixed them together and he
[1:19:43] sprinkled the people
[1:19:45] and the word with the blood saying that
[1:19:47] this blood actually unites you with the
[1:19:49] word
[1:19:50] right so now you're not two separate
[1:19:52] entities you're one
[1:19:55] right there's a uniting by the blood by
[1:19:57] the blood of the lamb
[1:19:58] i could say it like this they were
[1:20:00] united with the word
[1:20:02] this was done in type
[1:20:03] i mean to show what the lord jesus would
[1:20:05] do in this day
[1:20:07] now the thing is not not everyone
[1:20:11] so so they were now meant to embody that
[1:20:14] word
[1:20:15] right so their very life was meant to be
[1:20:17] a manifestation of the scripture
[1:20:20] amen but the thing is not everyone mix
[1:20:23] that word with faith
[1:20:25] as as uh paul would say in hebrews four
[1:20:28] and one and two he says let us therefore
[1:20:30] fearless the promise being left of of us
[1:20:33] of entering into his rest as any of you
[1:20:35] should seem to come short of it for unto
[1:20:37] us was the gospel priest as well as unto
[1:20:40] them but the word preached to not profit
[1:20:42] them not being mixed with faith in them
[1:20:45] that heard it
[1:20:46] so they were all sprinkled
[1:20:49] but it was only those who had a heart of
[1:20:50] faith manifested it
[1:20:52] right now faith and human reasoning
[1:20:54] can't mix
[1:20:56] faith real faith is revelation of the
[1:20:58] word of god it goes beyond human
[1:21:00] reasoning
[1:21:01] right human reasoning doesn't cannot
[1:21:03] come into the equation
[1:21:05] because
[1:21:07] the 12 spies that moses first sent out
[1:21:10] they were they were in this event
[1:21:12] where the where the book was sprinkled
[1:21:14] with the blood and the people sprinkled
[1:21:16] that same blood to enjoying it together
[1:21:19] but only two of those spies mix that
[1:21:21] word with faith
[1:21:23] caleb and joshua and the other ten spies
[1:21:26] they they saw the same land they saw the
[1:21:29] same giants they saw the same walls they
[1:21:31] saw the same armies they saw the same
[1:21:33] everything
[1:21:34] caleb and joshua didn't just go to some
[1:21:36] little village in the back of a valley
[1:21:39] somewhere and say this is the land we'll
[1:21:41] take it look this is what i saw no no
[1:21:43] they saw all and they did not disqualify
[1:21:46] the testimony of the other spies when
[1:21:48] they came back
[1:21:49] but they said god is more than able for
[1:21:51] us to take it
[1:21:52] let's go get it now
[1:21:54] why because because the word was joined
[1:21:56] to them by the blood but it was mixed
[1:21:59] with faith so they believed that word
[1:22:01] right it was revealed to them that the
[1:22:03] lord was going to manifest that word in
[1:22:05] their lives and part of that word was
[1:22:07] they would dwell in the land
[1:22:09] i mean so so their reasoning
[1:22:12] their reasoning did not get in the way
[1:22:15] well their reasoning didn't even come
[1:22:16] into the equation because their faith
[1:22:17] said it's mine
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:20] now
[1:22:22] reasoning we must be careful because
[1:22:24] reasoning can just be a thin veneer of
[1:22:26] unbelief
[1:22:27] right because but the thing is if you
[1:22:29] think about it if we were transported
[1:22:31] back into caleb and joshua's day and we
[1:22:33] asked those ten spies do you believe in
[1:22:35] jehovah god
[1:22:36] absolutely that's his prophet there
[1:22:38] moses
[1:22:39] i'll tell you about the red sea i walked
[1:22:41] through it
[1:22:42] you should have heard the day when the
[1:22:43] death angel came through i was there i
[1:22:46] was safe because i applied the blood
[1:22:48] we've been eating manna
[1:22:50] of course i believe he's a god of
[1:22:51] miracles
[1:22:52] but
[1:22:54] their faith wasn't it was just human
[1:22:55] faith it wasn't revealed faith
[1:22:58] because when the first obstacle came
[1:23:00] along of can you believe the word they
[1:23:02] reasoned it away saying we're just
[1:23:03] grasshoppers and as i've said before
[1:23:06] they didn't go they didn't knock on the
[1:23:07] doors of jericho or malachite stronghold
[1:23:10] and say can you have you got five
[1:23:12] minutes to fill out a survey
[1:23:14] are we a in your site the same size are
[1:23:17] we b taller than you or we see about
[1:23:19] grasshopper level they didn't ask them
[1:23:20] that
[1:23:22] i know it sounds ridiculous but they
[1:23:23] didn't go ask them how are we compared
[1:23:25] to you can you stand who will measure
[1:23:26] you and you measure us and all that's
[1:23:28] that's that's that's grasshopper range
[1:23:30] no they just reason that
[1:23:33] that we're just little in there so we're
[1:23:34] grasshoppers
[1:23:37] but caleb and joshua
[1:23:39] they believed
[1:23:41] they said we're more than able to take
[1:23:42] the land
[1:23:44] and so
[1:23:46] because faith and human reasoning can't
[1:23:48] mix they had to surrender their
[1:23:51] reasoning and take faith
[1:23:53] right
[1:23:54] so they had to surrender their reasoning
[1:23:56] against the word and to say no god said
[1:23:58] it's gonna be
[1:24:00] amen and that's how we should be today
[1:24:02] no
[1:24:04] they were united so so in shadow there
[1:24:06] or in type moses sprinkled the people of
[1:24:09] the book and the people
[1:24:11] with the blood both he says this is what
[1:24:13] god has enjoined he enjoined the people
[1:24:15] in the word now
[1:24:16] this was done in the old testament under
[1:24:18] the blood of bulls and goats but it
[1:24:19] could not write that word in their
[1:24:20] hearts
[1:24:21] so the same sinful desire that they that
[1:24:24] caused them to sin in the first place
[1:24:26] and they took the offering to the to the
[1:24:28] priest then they were forgiven you know
[1:24:30] the blood covered that sin they still
[1:24:32] left with that same desire
[1:24:34] but under the blood of jesus christ by
[1:24:36] the holy ghost god burns out that old
[1:24:39] nature he burns out those old desires
[1:24:42] he doesn't just suppress the member now
[1:24:44] this is christianity is not how to
[1:24:46] suppress your carnal nature and look
[1:24:49] like a christian 12 steps
[1:24:51] no
[1:24:53] it's god comes in and changes our nature
[1:24:56] right we really are born again we really
[1:24:58] do become new creatures he really does
[1:25:00] transform us
[1:25:01] hallelujah so it's not seven or twelve
[1:25:04] or whatever many steps to suppress your
[1:25:06] carnal nature to be a christian it's not
[1:25:08] that way it's god comes and changes your
[1:25:10] nature
[1:25:11] hallelujah
[1:25:13] amen so the apostle paul was saying in
[1:25:16] second corinthians three and one
[1:25:18] i trust everyone i'm about to climb
[1:25:19] everyone's awake
[1:25:21] everyone's doing okay
[1:25:23] yep god praise the lord
[1:25:25] amen second corinthians three and one
[1:25:26] the apostle paul would speak about how
[1:25:29] they
[1:25:30] actually the people the believers be
[1:25:32] became living epistles
[1:25:35] just as you could say in shadow caleb
[1:25:37] and joshua became living epistles
[1:25:39] because they said caleb said i want my
[1:25:40] mountain
[1:25:42] he got his mountain
[1:25:43] amen they took the land
[1:25:46] hallelujah what did they do they they
[1:25:48] they manifested the word the word was
[1:25:51] living in them
[1:25:52] remember because the old testament law
[1:25:54] was not made for the wilderness it was
[1:25:56] made for the promised land
[1:25:58] the whole purpose of it was to be in the
[1:26:00] land not to be in the wilderness
[1:26:04] and it's the same thing with the word of
[1:26:05] god the whole purpose of it is for the
[1:26:07] holy ghost to write it in your heart
[1:26:10] right to be in the land to dwell to be
[1:26:12] united to the lord he says do we begin
[1:26:15] again to commend ourselves or need we as
[1:26:17] some others epistles of commendation to
[1:26:20] you or letters of commendation from you
[1:26:23] you are our epistles written in our
[1:26:24] hearts known and read of all men for as
[1:26:27] much as you are manifestly declared to
[1:26:29] be the epistle of christ minister by us
[1:26:32] not by not written not sorry with ink
[1:26:35] but with the spirit of the living god
[1:26:37] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[1:26:40] tables of the heart so the apostle paul
[1:26:42] was telling them actually you are living
[1:26:45] epistles
[1:26:46] right written not by inc so not by man's
[1:26:49] ability not by trying to memorize it in
[1:26:51] the mind all those things are fine but
[1:26:54] it was by the holy ghost taking the word
[1:26:56] and writing it into the hearts of the
[1:26:57] people they became living bibles
[1:27:00] right why because they were dwelling now
[1:27:02] in a new land amen they had been united
[1:27:06] now if we have been united to the king
[1:27:09] it's fundamental that we take his name
[1:27:12] amen right it's very fundamental because
[1:27:15] if we are if you know if we go to
[1:27:17] ephesians i believe it's chapter three
[1:27:21] if i have it here if not well i'll turn
[1:27:23] to it
[1:27:28] yeah ephesians 3
[1:27:31] and we're going to go to
[1:27:33] um ephesians 3 and 9 because remember we
[1:27:35] want to well we must be united to the
[1:27:37] king of this land
[1:27:40] right
[1:27:41] who wants to become one with jesus
[1:27:44] right
[1:27:45] so
[1:27:46] here we are in ephesians three
[1:27:54] and we're going to start from verse nine
[1:27:56] it's hard yeah i love the book of
[1:27:57] ephesians so it's kind of hard to just
[1:28:01] read a bit
[1:28:04] okay ephesians three and nine and to
[1:28:06] make all men see what is the fellowship
[1:28:08] of the mystery which from the beginning
[1:28:10] of the world hath been hidden god who
[1:28:12] created all things by jesus christ to
[1:28:14] the intent that now unto the
[1:28:16] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:28:17] places maybe might be known by the
[1:28:19] church the manifold wisdom of god
[1:28:22] according to the eternal purpose which
[1:28:24] he purposed in christ jesus our lord
[1:28:27] in whom we have boldness and access with
[1:28:29] confidence by the faith of him wherefore
[1:28:32] i desire that you faint not at my
[1:28:33] tribulations for you which is your glory
[1:28:36] for this cause i bow my knees unto the
[1:28:38] father of our lord jesus christ of whom
[1:28:40] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:28:42] named
[1:28:43] so what's the family name
[1:28:45] the lord jesus christ right jesus said i
[1:28:47] come in my father's name and you receive
[1:28:49] me not what name did he come in jesus
[1:28:52] right so the family name is jesus
[1:28:55] right so the inhabitants of this land is
[1:28:57] called the lord jesus christ
[1:28:59] amen amen that he would grant you
[1:29:02] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:29:03] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:29:05] and the inner man that christ may dwell
[1:29:08] in your hearts by faith that ye being
[1:29:10] rooted and grounded in love may be able
[1:29:12] to comprehend with all the saints what
[1:29:14] is the breadth and length and depth and
[1:29:15] height and to know the love of christ
[1:29:17] which passes knowledge that ye might be
[1:29:20] filled with all the fullness of god now
[1:29:22] unto him that's able to do exceeding
[1:29:23] abundant above all that you may ask or
[1:29:25] think according to the power that
[1:29:27] worketh in us unto him be glory in the
[1:29:29] church by christ jesus throughout all
[1:29:31] ages world without end amen
[1:29:34] i mean so the family name as as we have
[1:29:37] established is the lord jesus christ and
[1:29:40] this is why when the when when peter
[1:29:42] would preach on the day of pentecost
[1:29:45] and and they were pricked in their
[1:29:46] hearts realizing they crucified the
[1:29:48] messiah
[1:29:49] they asked they asked the disciples men
[1:29:52] and brethren what shall we do to be
[1:29:53] saved
[1:29:54] and so here here is peter he's preaching
[1:29:57] the first ever service it's not even
[1:29:58] peter preaching it's actually jesus by
[1:30:00] the way within and preaching he says
[1:30:03] repent every one of you and then yeah
[1:30:05] for the remission of sin and you shall
[1:30:07] receive the gift of the holy ghost so
[1:30:08] the promise is unto you and your
[1:30:09] children those that are far off as many
[1:30:12] as the lord our god shall call right so
[1:30:14] so this was this was he said you've got
[1:30:16] to repent so you've got to lay aside all
[1:30:18] of your sin lay aside your reasoning
[1:30:22] lay aside your religion
[1:30:23] lay aside your baggage lay aside your
[1:30:26] guilt
[1:30:27] lay them all put them at jesus feet
[1:30:29] turn from them and be buried in his name
[1:30:32] amen in baptism
[1:30:34] see there is one door into heaven
[1:30:37] that's through the lord jesus christ he
[1:30:39] says i'm the door to the sheepfold we
[1:30:41] know in the old testament sheepfolds
[1:30:43] didn't have doors the shepherd was the
[1:30:45] door to the sheepfold so at night when
[1:30:48] the shepherd led his sheep into the
[1:30:50] sheepfold he actually lay across the
[1:30:52] opening of the of the sheepfold and he
[1:30:54] became the door
[1:30:56] amen and jesus is the door
[1:30:59] right
[1:31:00] so if we want to enter into the
[1:31:02] sheepfold
[1:31:03] we have to we have to come his provided
[1:31:06] way now i'm telling you these things
[1:31:08] because when the devil comes away and
[1:31:09] tries to say you ain't gonna make it you
[1:31:12] say devil hold on
[1:31:14] i'm going to give you a history lesson
[1:31:18] hallelujah so it's very important to
[1:31:20] keep these things in our forefront
[1:31:21] because we must remember we are safe
[1:31:23] because we've come god's provided away
[1:31:26] right more than an anointing more than a
[1:31:28] feeling more than i was having some sort
[1:31:30] of nirvana kind of experience or i was
[1:31:32] down or whatever it's not based on
[1:31:35] feeling it's based on i've come
[1:31:36] according to god's word
[1:31:38] amen because that's how that's how god
[1:31:40] god is not going to judge us even by our
[1:31:43] sincerity he's going to judge us by us
[1:31:45] coming his way
[1:31:47] amen you know if a doctor said listen
[1:31:51] you have this almond in your body you've
[1:31:53] got to drink this
[1:31:56] it's been proven
[1:31:58] we can have a whole bunch of testimonies
[1:32:00] of people who have taken this medicine
[1:32:02] you know and they could say it worked
[1:32:03] for them
[1:32:05] right
[1:32:06] if i don't actually take the medicine
[1:32:09] it's not the doctor's fault for
[1:32:10] prescribing it it's not the medicine's
[1:32:12] fault either it's me choosing not to
[1:32:15] take it
[1:32:16] right so it's the same thing with
[1:32:18] salvation it can be it can be presented
[1:32:20] to us because we could look at let's
[1:32:22] look at all the patients that have taken
[1:32:24] the prescription
[1:32:26] let's let's let's ask the apostle paul
[1:32:29] how did that prescription go for you
[1:32:32] he says well i was a pharisee of the
[1:32:33] pharisees i was hell-bent against the
[1:32:36] sect of jesus of nazareth this cult and
[1:32:38] i was going to destroy it but the very
[1:32:40] god i thought i was serving revealed
[1:32:42] himself to me on the road to damascus
[1:32:44] and said my name is jesus
[1:32:46] and then i i had to repent i was
[1:32:48] baptized in his name i got filled with
[1:32:50] the holy ghost and the very thing i was
[1:32:52] trying to destroy i gave my whole life
[1:32:54] to build
[1:32:56] and then it finally came down to the
[1:32:57] crunch you know what i loved about
[1:32:58] wednesday brother paul
[1:33:00] paul and silas were in the jail
[1:33:02] they did not know they'd be set free
[1:33:05] they did not know you know brother silas
[1:33:07] yes brother paul you know brother silas
[1:33:09] if we begin to sing
[1:33:11] god's going to shake this place we're
[1:33:13] going to be set free
[1:33:14] yes yes that's that's exactly why we're
[1:33:16] going to sing because we're going to be
[1:33:17] free you know no they did not sing and
[1:33:20] praise god because of freedom they
[1:33:22] praise him because he was their god
[1:33:24] and he was their everything and they
[1:33:26] were saved it didn't matter if they
[1:33:27] rotted in that prison and died i mean
[1:33:30] they knew where they were going you know
[1:33:31] it's amazing when paul was standing
[1:33:33] before king of king agrippa and chains
[1:33:35] who was really the one in chains
[1:33:37] it wasn't the apostle paul he was a free
[1:33:40] man
[1:33:41] there was no sin debt there was no
[1:33:42] baggage that would you know stop him
[1:33:44] getting into heaven that was done with
[1:33:46] it was king agrippa king agrippa was on
[1:33:49] trial that day
[1:33:50] it wasn't the apostle paul if we looked
[1:33:53] at the natural scene to be no no um
[1:33:56] the apostle paul's on trial no no no no
[1:33:58] king agrippa was on trial
[1:34:00] because he was he was a living epistle
[1:34:03] standing before him
[1:34:05] and he was because remember the apostle
[1:34:07] paul he had eternal life
[1:34:09] he's passed from judgment
[1:34:11] but now here's his here's actually the
[1:34:13] word examining the king agrippa
[1:34:15] are you going to receive me not the just
[1:34:18] i'm not talking about the man talking
[1:34:18] about the word
[1:34:20] right and it was you know it's just like
[1:34:21] when the apostles were
[1:34:24] you know brought before the sanhedrin
[1:34:26] it was a sanhedrin on trial
[1:34:29] do you know they got a lot of times at
[1:34:30] mercy
[1:34:31] they had jesus before them
[1:34:33] the very king of glory
[1:34:35] they had the apostles more than once
[1:34:37] before them
[1:34:38] most people only get one opportunity
[1:34:39] they had about three
[1:34:41] they turned it down every time that was
[1:34:43] their decision
[1:34:44] but so you see it's not actually you're
[1:34:46] gonna think the work we are free people
[1:34:50] hey
[1:34:51] who's free
[1:34:53] the blood has loosed you
[1:34:54] amen from every debt
[1:34:56] every guilt all shame
[1:34:59] all bad memories all bad experiences
[1:35:02] religious not religious whatever it's
[1:35:04] all been taken care of i mean there's
[1:35:06] not just a little bit of us that's oh
[1:35:08] you know no no it's gone amen
[1:35:11] hallelujah
[1:35:12] irrespective of what the devil tries to
[1:35:14] put down your throat he said no no no
[1:35:16] my perfect lamb was received
[1:35:18] his name is jesus
[1:35:20] hallelujah so so there was king agrippa
[1:35:23] and it was the apostle paul actually was
[1:35:25] the free man in that in that trial no
[1:35:27] here's paul and silas they didn't know
[1:35:29] they were going to be freed but they
[1:35:30] just worshipped because they worshipped
[1:35:32] because god is so good
[1:35:34] holy they're in stocks they've been
[1:35:35] beaten but god is so good
[1:35:37] hallelujah you may be having a bad day
[1:35:39] but god is so good you may be having a
[1:35:41] lot of trouble but god
[1:35:43] is so good god rich in mercy not just to
[1:35:45] anyone but to you
[1:35:47] hallelujah
[1:35:51] we should be excited
[1:35:52] shouldn't we be happy
[1:35:54] the world's falling apart that's okay
[1:35:56] god's got this god's got us in the palm
[1:35:58] of his hand
[1:36:00] hallelujah we can just rest
[1:36:02] amen so i love that very much they just
[1:36:04] praise god
[1:36:05] and god just said i'm gonna let you out
[1:36:06] of this they weren't meant to stay there
[1:36:07] that's fine remember the trial you're in
[1:36:10] don't don't just believe you're in it
[1:36:12] forever
[1:36:14] right there's an end
[1:36:16] there's an end of that trial
[1:36:18] so the apostle paul took the medicine
[1:36:21] and he'd say about that and then he'd
[1:36:23] say you know i was in prison yeah
[1:36:26] actually i was chained to a
[1:36:29] some soldiers
[1:36:31] but he didn't let being chained to a
[1:36:32] dead man
[1:36:34] hold him back
[1:36:35] he didn't say well i can't pray and god
[1:36:38] can't reveal the new testament to me
[1:36:39] because i'm having this kind of a day it
[1:36:41] was more than a day it was a long time
[1:36:43] right he was chained to soldiers or
[1:36:45] chained to a prison wall but yet he
[1:36:47] could pray and god poured in most of the
[1:36:49] new testament into his life
[1:36:51] you know
[1:36:52] we are still chained to a dead man
[1:36:55] this this carnival flesh right we're
[1:36:57] chained to it
[1:36:59] amen death will set it i mean the body
[1:37:00] change will set us free of this nature
[1:37:02] you know this guy that's why i think
[1:37:04] it's going to be the greatest the longer
[1:37:05] you live the more not because you're
[1:37:07] getting older you just want to get rid
[1:37:08] of this guy
[1:37:09] amen so it's going to be a wonderful
[1:37:11] time when when these bodies are changed
[1:37:14] but we should not allow this thing to
[1:37:16] hinder god pouring himself in amen amen
[1:37:20] amen so he took the he took the medicine
[1:37:23] and he'd say you know they were
[1:37:25] sharpening her axe
[1:37:27] because the emperor said his head's got
[1:37:29] to come off
[1:37:30] and and and i actually heard the axe
[1:37:32] being sharpened on the
[1:37:34] on the wheel
[1:37:36] but he but it didn't it didn't worry me
[1:37:39] because i knew i had a crown of life
[1:37:42] waiting for me
[1:37:43] and it was just a nice idea he knew it
[1:37:45] was there and he all said it's not just
[1:37:47] for me but all those that love the
[1:37:48] lord's glorious appearing
[1:37:50] hallelujah so he took the medicine
[1:37:53] and it worked
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:56] what about stephen the first martyr
[1:37:59] he says lord don't lay this to the
[1:38:00] charge i see the son of god at the right
[1:38:02] hand of the father majesty on high i see
[1:38:04] jesus
[1:38:05] hallelujah
[1:38:07] it worked for him
[1:38:08] amen what about the martyrs did it work
[1:38:11] for them it worked for them
[1:38:12] they were fed the lions sawn us under
[1:38:14] all kind of horrible things i often
[1:38:16] think you know
[1:38:18] because god anoints us to overcome
[1:38:21] whatever we have to face
[1:38:22] right he anoints us that we will not
[1:38:24] give and we will not recant we cannot
[1:38:27] because we've been married
[1:38:29] we can't you we can't deny him because
[1:38:31] he's part of us we're part of him right
[1:38:34] but they're there in the coliseum now
[1:38:35] this is just me that's how i feel about
[1:38:37] it you know they hear the roar of the
[1:38:39] lions the crowd and all these things
[1:38:41] they're there
[1:38:43] but if you begin to think
[1:38:45] in a few moments
[1:38:47] you know the one we love
[1:38:49] you know the lord jesus
[1:38:51] that found us in slavery or wherever we
[1:38:52] were in
[1:38:53] the end of prostitution slavery
[1:38:56] being someone you know just a thief on
[1:38:58] the street no good rotten whatever or
[1:39:00] maybe some religious proud person
[1:39:01] thought that or something but then jesus
[1:39:03] came
[1:39:04] you know that one we feel this presence
[1:39:06] come close
[1:39:07] when we pray when we gather this great
[1:39:09] anointing comes and that sweet humble
[1:39:10] feeling comes over us we just love them
[1:39:12] and want more of them you know in a few
[1:39:15] moments it may be via that line but in a
[1:39:17] few moments i'm going to be standing in
[1:39:18] the presence of the one that loved me
[1:39:21] hallelujah
[1:39:22] and the gates would open they would go
[1:39:24] to victory hallelujah
[1:39:27] amen they would say that medicine worked
[1:39:30] hallelujah and down all the way down
[1:39:32] through the ages into this day
[1:39:35] amen you know it just wasn't brother
[1:39:37] bosworth that you know when he was dying
[1:39:40] he was on his deathbed and for hours
[1:39:42] people he would sit up and shake
[1:39:44] people's hands of believers that had
[1:39:45] gone on
[1:39:47] you know that he led to the lord
[1:39:49] and then brother brown came and saw him
[1:39:51] and said you know brother bosworth
[1:39:53] you know when's the greatest time of
[1:39:54] your life he says right now
[1:39:56] because the one that i've loved all
[1:39:58] these years is gonna walk through the
[1:39:59] store and take me home
[1:40:02] you know um
[1:40:04] brother red shell's wife i can't
[1:40:06] remember her name she had that same kind
[1:40:07] of experience
[1:40:08] it's on a death bed she'd sit up and
[1:40:09] shake people's hands there was no one in
[1:40:11] the room but they are in another
[1:40:12] dimension
[1:40:13] hallelujah
[1:40:15] yes so the ones that
[1:40:16] but the one that we love
[1:40:19] did the medicine work
[1:40:20] they could say absolutely
[1:40:23] you know when christine had that bike
[1:40:24] accident in switzerland and they gave
[1:40:26] her tramadol in the in the hospital and
[1:40:28] she had the anaphylactic reaction and
[1:40:29] she was actually she found herself
[1:40:31] leaving her body you know and her auntie
[1:40:33] or someone was there crying at her bed
[1:40:34] and things you know she said it because
[1:40:36] she knew she was dying
[1:40:38] but she said it was the greatest thing
[1:40:41] it wasn't scary
[1:40:42] there was no fear it was just joy
[1:40:45] and she and as she was leaving her body
[1:40:46] because she came back because she's
[1:40:47] still with us but you know where but she
[1:40:50] but you want to tell her auntie don't be
[1:40:52] sad
[1:40:53] it's a great thing
[1:40:55] if we just knew what was beyond the
[1:40:56] river
[1:40:58] and that's why the lord comes down and
[1:41:00] he and he ministers to our hearts we
[1:41:02] feel his anointing because he wants us
[1:41:03] to know there is a land beyond the river
[1:41:06] it's not human excitement it's not just
[1:41:08] emotion whatever it's there's more than
[1:41:09] that but he wants you to know you're
[1:41:11] part of that great eternal land
[1:41:14] hello that's why you're united with them
[1:41:16] now
[1:41:18] amen
[1:41:20] hallelujah
[1:41:22] amen so
[1:41:24] so peter would preach that on the day of
[1:41:25] pentecost that and the people would they
[1:41:27] would give their lives to be baptized in
[1:41:29] his name taking on his name
[1:41:31] and then in cornelius's house the
[1:41:33] gentiles received the holy ghost while
[1:41:35] peter was preaching but he says since
[1:41:37] they've received the holy ghost like
[1:41:38] weed in the beginning can we forbid
[1:41:40] water
[1:41:41] so they were baptized in name of the
[1:41:43] lord jesus christ
[1:41:45] amen
[1:41:46] but some people say but what about jesus
[1:41:48] in matthew 28 19 because he said baptize
[1:41:50] them in the name of the father the son
[1:41:52] and the holy ghost and people say i'd
[1:41:54] rather take jesus words because it's in
[1:41:56] read in my bibles red letter bible i'd
[1:41:58] rather take that above what peter said
[1:42:00] but they don't understand that what is
[1:42:02] the name
[1:42:03] that's why i love it you have a prophet
[1:42:05] yay tall
[1:42:07] had an open book
[1:42:09] and he just asked a question what's the
[1:42:10] name
[1:42:11] what's the name and then you when you
[1:42:13] read it again you think well what is the
[1:42:15] name it's such an easy thing to skip
[1:42:17] over baptize them in the name of the one
[1:42:19] name of the father son holy ghost
[1:42:21] and he asked just ask the question
[1:42:22] what's the name
[1:42:24] so jesus said i come in my father's name
[1:42:26] and you receive me not his name is jesus
[1:42:29] right
[1:42:31] right and it's one name it's not names
[1:42:34] he didn't say repeat these words as you
[1:42:36] immerse people in water he says baptize
[1:42:38] them in the name
[1:42:40] of the father the son and the holy ghost
[1:42:42] that's the lord jesus christ
[1:42:46] so when peter said that on the day of
[1:42:47] pentecost he wasn't contradicting what
[1:42:49] jesus was saying because the same jesus
[1:42:51] that said in matthew 28 19 is the same
[1:42:53] jesus speaking through peter because god
[1:42:56] cannot there's no actual contradiction
[1:42:57] in the scripture
[1:42:59] right it's actually perfect but we need
[1:43:01] to understand you see how it ties
[1:43:02] together
[1:43:04] amen and he also said in mark he says
[1:43:06] him that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:43:07] be saved
[1:43:09] amen
[1:43:10] so you can take those things say devil
[1:43:12] here you go
[1:43:14] you try and put this fear and things in
[1:43:15] my lap i'm just going to put this into
[1:43:17] your lap
[1:43:18] what do you do with this
[1:43:21] amen we've got to take the devil back to
[1:43:22] the word too
[1:43:25] amen it's not just reminding the lord of
[1:43:27] his promises you to take the devil back
[1:43:29] into the words and the devil i've come
[1:43:31] according to god's provided way i've
[1:43:33] entered into the straight gate
[1:43:35] s-t-r-a-i-t it's spelt which is a narrow
[1:43:37] passage of water i've entered in the
[1:43:39] gate
[1:43:39] you know and i'm walking along the
[1:43:41] narrow way
[1:43:42] hallelujah the lord allowed me because
[1:43:44] he says many are many few there are that
[1:43:47] will find it
[1:43:49] so the lord now i'm not
[1:43:51] you remember when i speak about these
[1:43:53] things i'm just happy i'm in
[1:43:55] you know you get something like your
[1:43:57] favorite food or something i'm just
[1:43:58] happy i've got it maybe i'm like a
[1:44:00] little child on the inside but i'm just
[1:44:01] happy i'm in so i'm not throwing anyone
[1:44:03] out you must understand but jesus said
[1:44:05] few there are that will find it
[1:44:08] right i'm just happy i found it well the
[1:44:10] lord found he said no no come this way
[1:44:13] thank you lord
[1:44:15] hallelujah
[1:44:17] amen so
[1:44:18] now i'm just gonna
[1:44:22] wrap this up
[1:44:24] but he says
[1:44:26] so the lord says now
[1:44:30] this is the way we should go in
[1:44:32] and we should take the devil back to
[1:44:34] those moments
[1:44:37] and it says in the book of colossians
[1:44:38] whatever you do in word or deed to all
[1:44:40] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:44:42] so baptism is a deed
[1:44:44] but we should take that into our life
[1:44:46] think is everything i do in my life can
[1:44:48] i do in the name of the lord
[1:44:51] we might be stopping doing a lot of
[1:44:52] things
[1:44:54] but let's just let's just keep that in
[1:44:55] mind
[1:44:56] so we can be super thankful if i can put
[1:44:59] it that way that the lord has caused us
[1:45:01] to be united with the new anointed word
[1:45:04] of this age
[1:45:06] amen which is
[1:45:08] the lord jesus christ the word
[1:45:10] amen
[1:45:12] hallelujah
[1:45:14] now i feel like i'm going to go off into
[1:45:15] another thought so i'm just going to
[1:45:16] read a couple of quotes
[1:45:19] and then i'm going to
[1:45:20] stop
[1:45:21] okay
[1:45:23] now he sees an identification
[1:45:26] who wants so he says now
[1:45:29] what was his mind to do the mind that
[1:45:31] was in christ
[1:45:32] always to stay with the father's word
[1:45:35] no matter how no matter what looked
[1:45:37] glossy and what looked this way it
[1:45:39] didn't make any difference to him the
[1:45:41] father's word is what counted everywhere
[1:45:44] when he met the devil he never used his
[1:45:45] own power to defeat him he used the word
[1:45:48] because that was him
[1:45:50] did you ever think he never wrote a book
[1:45:52] when he was on earth as far as we know
[1:45:54] he never wrote he never wrote but one
[1:45:57] time that was in the sand then erased it
[1:45:59] out probably afterwards why didn't he
[1:46:00] write a word because he was the word see
[1:46:03] he lived the word we don't need so many
[1:46:05] books when you become a written epistle
[1:46:07] of god see
[1:46:09] that's what god wants to be wants you to
[1:46:11] be images of him
[1:46:14] right she wants to take his word
[1:46:16] right in our hearts and then we become a
[1:46:18] living bible
[1:46:20] amen
[1:46:20] he says in sirs we would see jesus the
[1:46:22] things he said he says he that believeth
[1:46:24] on me saint john 14 12 the works that i
[1:46:27] do shall you do also see
[1:46:29] we'll do the same works think the same
[1:46:31] thoughts live the same type of life if
[1:46:34] the spirit of god is in you it makes you
[1:46:36] live like christ christ like then you
[1:46:38] become a written epistle read of all men
[1:46:41] christ in you reflecting his light out
[1:46:43] of you as god was in christ reconciling
[1:46:46] the world to himself and reflected god
[1:46:49] from his own body no man has seen god
[1:46:51] any time but the only begotten of the
[1:46:53] father has declared him god was in
[1:46:55] christ and what god and sorry and what
[1:46:57] christ's attitude was was god's attitude
[1:47:00] because the two work together the spirit
[1:47:02] and the flesh unite together
[1:47:05] he says
[1:47:06] so he says the two come together become
[1:47:09] one
[1:47:10] and it should be the same thing with
[1:47:11] us and the lord
[1:47:13] right it's not we're not two we become
[1:47:15] one why because we dwell in the land of
[1:47:17] our fathers where there is a marrying
[1:47:20] going on
[1:47:21] where we are married to the lord jesus
[1:47:23] christ where it's not we're no longer
[1:47:25] two
[1:47:26] but we're one
[1:47:27] so now this is a challenge but jesus
[1:47:30] said
[1:47:31] if you
[1:47:32] he says because they asking the question
[1:47:34] show us the father
[1:47:37] he says have i been so long with you you
[1:47:38] don't know me
[1:47:40] now that same god is in you and i
[1:47:43] right so if i can put it this way when
[1:47:45] people see us they should see jesus
[1:47:48] right they should see so that doesn't
[1:47:50] mean you're going to grow a bed like
[1:47:51] this and wear a robe like he did and no
[1:47:53] no it's not about external appearance
[1:47:55] well unless it's but we do dress
[1:47:57] according to the scripture we understand
[1:47:58] that but it should be our nature our
[1:48:00] attitude
[1:48:02] the life that comes out of us should be
[1:48:03] jesus
[1:48:04] should be the word
[1:48:06] right that we are living epistles read
[1:48:08] known of all men
[1:48:10] amen can we have the musicians please
[1:48:12] this morning
[1:48:14] we're just going to finish there because
[1:48:15] i feel like i'm going into a whole
[1:48:17] different
[1:48:18] segue so i'll i'll keep that for another
[1:48:21] time
[1:48:22] i shouldn't say segway but a whole
[1:48:24] nother thought
[1:48:26] amen but we can have a real thanksgiving
[1:48:28] can't we
[1:48:30] amen we have left
[1:48:32] amen this world behind we have left
[1:48:35] doesn't matter what we came out of we've
[1:48:37] left it behind and the lord has brought
[1:48:39] us to a new land
[1:48:40] to himself to be united to himself
