[25:03] For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name
[25:05] amen amen amen God bless you friends you
[25:08] can have your seats tonight so I want to
[25:10] speak tonight about walking in the peace
[25:12] of God walking in the great Shalom or
[25:14] peace of God now this incredible scene
[25:17] that we just read here a woman would
[25:20] would would uh uh gate Crasher party she
[25:24] wasn't invited but yet she she had a
[25:26] longing she had a need when she saw the
[25:27] Lord Jesus Jesus there she she knew that
[25:29] he was uh he could she could see by him
[25:32] in his position where he wasn't made
[25:34] welcome his feet wasn't washed like the
[25:36] rest of the guests he wasn't anointed
[25:38] like the rest of the guests he wasn't
[25:39] kissed and made welcome like the rest of
[25:41] the guests he was in the corner with
[25:42] dirty unwashed feet and when she saw him
[25:44] in that condition something moved on her
[25:47] heart God moved on her heart and she
[25:48] realized she had to make him welcome in
[25:50] that place incredible she wasn't invited
[25:53] she wasn't welcome but yet somehow she
[25:55] got through and it goes to show that
[25:57] when the faith ever struck break the
[25:58] heart of someone every obstacle will go
[26:00] to one side amen because God will allow
[26:03] that person to get where they need to
[26:05] get amen so she got there that's the
[26:08] main thing the main thing is she got
[26:09] there I mean didn't matter what state
[26:11] she came in she got there amen and the
[26:13] same thing with us that doesn't matter
[26:14] what state we arrived in amen he didn't
[26:16] leave us in that state when we left I
[26:18] mean can you imagine what it would have
[26:19] been like she she came in under one
[26:22] emotion and she came out with another
[26:24] emotion I mean she came in she knew she
[26:27] was rotten dirty filthy lost troubled
[26:30] and you know all kind of anxiety no
[26:32] doubt but yet in spite of all those
[26:33] things the need to get to jesus' feet
[26:36] prevailed over all those things but yet
[26:38] when all was said and done she realized
[26:40] her State when she was at the feet of
[26:42] the Messiah and I'm sure we all remember
[26:44] that kind of a time when we remember I
[26:46] remember the time when I was lost and I
[26:47] really needed the Lord you know just
[26:49] like this woman did and yet you know
[26:51] when she came there and then when she
[26:53] heard those incredible words thy faith
[26:56] has saved thee yeah go in peace peace
[26:59] she came with no peace she left with
[27:01] peace amen she came with trouble she
[27:04] left with peace she came lost she went
[27:06] out found amen she came broken but she
[27:09] went out whole amen what an incredible
[27:11] thing because she realized that Jesus
[27:14] was more than a prophet more than more
[27:16] than just another man but this is the
[27:17] Lord God Almighty was made flesh and she
[27:20] knew what she needed she could only get
[27:23] from him the rabbis couldn't give it
[27:25] religion couldn't give it nothing could
[27:27] give it but he could give it amen so so
[27:29] he uh and and he allowed her cuz Jesus
[27:33] says all that come to are no wise cast
[27:35] out so the Lord Jesus knew her State
[27:37] knew her condition just like Simon would
[27:39] say if if if he was really a prophet he
[27:42] would know what manner of woman this was
[27:43] and he was more than a prophet he knew
[27:45] her true State amen even you know you
[27:48] know he he knew her true state but
[27:51] because she had a desire he allowed her
[27:53] to come
[27:55] now imagine those words you're not sure
[27:58] you're going to be received you know
[27:59] you're you're there you're caught up in
[28:01] the moment you know you're pouring your
[28:02] life out before the Lord and then
[28:04] finally he begins to talk and notice he
[28:06] doesn't talk to her first he talks to
[28:09] her critic he talks to his critic and he
[28:11] talks to her critic cuz he's going to
[28:13] put the critic in his place and he's
[28:14] going to put her in her place I mean she
[28:17] so so he's going to put the unbeliever
[28:18] in his place and put the believer in her
[28:20] place amen so now here he begins to
[28:22] address Simon and begin to speak to him
[28:24] and you know even even his own
[28:26] confession would really condemn him what
[28:27] was and his heart would condemn him but
[28:29] you know her heart just cried out for
[28:31] mercy and then finally she heard those
[28:34] words thy sins are forgiven what she
[28:37] wanted she got I'm so thankful when we
[28:39] come to the Lord we get what we need
[28:40] amen we don't get half of what we need
[28:42] we get all that we need amen and then
[28:45] and then he said thy faith has saved
[28:47] thee go in peace now words have immense
[28:51] power words have incredible power words
[28:54] will start World War I words started
[28:57] World War II they started World War I
[28:59] amen it was a reaction to an action sure
[29:02] but it was words that started it someone
[29:04] had to stand up and say we're going to
[29:05] do this we're going to attack this
[29:07] Hitler swept Germany the Lutheran Church
[29:09] everything into war by words anointed
[29:12] words amen you know there's a Saying
[29:14] sticks and stones may break my bones but
[29:16] words will never hurt me that's not true
[29:18] sticks and stones may break my bones but
[29:20] but words can hurt and Scar me words
[29:23] have great power and the influence of
[29:26] those words upon your life will actually
[29:29] dictate how powerful they are in your
[29:31] life amen if the devil told you you're
[29:33] lost you're not really going to take
[29:35] much and you saw him as he really was
[29:38] you're not going to really take that
[29:40] even with a pinch of salt that's going
[29:41] to be like water off a duck's back but
[29:44] then he can tell the same thing to
[29:45] someone else it can mean a lot to him a
[29:47] lot to them right words have great power
[29:50] now I'm just I am going somewhere with
[29:52] this and just I'm just trying to sort
[29:54] myself out here but you
[29:56] see the thing that influenced es you the
[29:58] most has the greatest impact in your
[30:00] life all right the thing that influences
[30:03] you the most it can be a friend it can
[30:05] be a a a friend Circle it can be a job
[30:08] it can be someone at work but but it's
[30:11] it can be your family I trust it's God
[30:14] more than anything amen that his words
[30:16] mean more to you than any anyone other's
[30:19] words Hallelujah like God says one word
[30:22] to you it sets you in a Rapture
[30:24] condition amen if you realize the
[30:27] influence of it if you realized the one
[30:28] who's speaking because remember it was
[30:31] Jesus it was more than a prophet
[30:32] speaking to this woman it was the
[30:34] resurrection and the life was speaking
[30:36] to her more than a prophet more than a
[30:38] religious leader the resurrection and
[30:40] the life the Lord God Almighty the
[30:42] Eternal one became flesh and spoke words
[30:44] of life to her amen so now a lot of
[30:47] people spoke a lot of words to her
[30:49] there's a reason she ended up the way
[30:50] she did maybe she ended maybe she
[30:53] started in a broken home maybe her
[30:54] father didn't love her maybe she was
[30:56] thrown out on the street Maybe she was
[30:58] sold into prostitution by her parents we
[31:00] don't know but words had power over her
[31:03] life maybe a lot of men told her you're
[31:05] trash and you're worth
[31:07] nothing we can only surmise these things
[31:09] but she ended up that condition because
[31:11] of a lot of words right if her parents
[31:14] picked it up in their arms said I love
[31:15] you I care for you you're matter to me
[31:17] you're more you know you're mine I doubt
[31:19] and and and said that over you know God
[31:21] tells us over and over again I love you
[31:24] I care for you you're mine amen you're
[31:27] not the de devil you never were you
[31:29] never will be you're my child doesn't he
[31:31] say that service after service you open
[31:32] your Bible what is he what is this I
[31:34] just read three words when I from from
[31:37] cover to cover in the cover also I love
[31:41] you amen see so so if she if she was
[31:44] raised in that kind of a home I I doubt
[31:47] very much she would have ended up the
[31:48] way she did but words were spoken at her
[31:51] and they had impact but now someone else
[31:54] was going to say some words to her and
[31:56] it was going to change her life forever
[31:59] amen because remember the Lord Jesus say
[32:01] thy faith has saved thee go in peace
[32:05] Hallelujah wouldn't we love to hear
[32:07] those words wouldn't you love to be in
[32:09] her kind of position and hear the
[32:12] Supreme judge the Supreme one say thy
[32:15] faith has saved thee go in peace
[32:18] Hallelujah do you know he spoken that to
[32:21] you do you realize he's spoken that to
[32:23] you the message of the hour is summed up
[32:25] by those words thy faith has saved thee
[32:28] go on peace Brother brah would stand and
[32:30] he'd preach the message Shalom it'd be
[32:32] the start of 1964 he'd preach it twice
[32:35] now to me it's very significant he had
[32:37] preached it at at the start of a new
[32:38] year because normally at the start of a
[32:41] new year you are thinking about what has
[32:43] happened in the previous year now if you
[32:46] could just if we could just go back to
[32:48] that time he had just been through 1963
[32:51] very significant year in the whole
[32:53] history of the Earth where where God
[32:55] would commission him to go to
[32:57] Jeffersonville and the Seven Seals are
[32:59] going to open the Lamb's Book of Life is
[33:01] going to be revealed the title deed to
[33:03] the Earth is going to be revealed and he
[33:05] be to be inspired by God to preach words
[33:07] to the bride of Christ he' say in the
[33:09] first seal I no longer call you church
[33:11] but I call you bride and he begins to
[33:13] address the bride of Christ begin to
[33:15] tell them where they came from and where
[33:16] they're going and he would he would open
[33:18] the the lamb himself would step forth
[33:20] and Break Forth the book of redemption
[33:23] and give the revelation of it to the
[33:25] prophet that we could receive it and
[33:27] live from it
[33:28] amen he would stand and he would preach
[33:30] sermons like the token saying You must
[33:32] have the literal life of God in you more
[33:35] than an emotion more than an anointing
[33:38] but the presence of God himself must
[33:40] dwell in you and that's how you know the
[33:42] blood is applied amen glory to God Amen
[33:46] he would preach messages like Christ is
[33:48] the mystery of God revealed and he would
[33:50] tell the people I'm going to tell you
[33:52] the back parts of God's mind amen and
[33:54] he'll be to tell tell them how how the
[33:57] mystery of Christ has unfolded to this
[33:59] very day Hallelujah and so he would he
[34:03] begin to preach these kind of a sermons
[34:04] then he would stand in 1964 and say it's
[34:07] shalom gross Darkness covers the people
[34:10] but the the the glory of the Lord is
[34:12] risen upon thee so now he's he's looking
[34:15] back with what has happened and now
[34:17] because of what has happened something
[34:18] greater is unfolding now because
[34:20] remember every season gives forth to
[34:22] another season we had summer praise God
[34:26] that gives forth to Autumn then that
[34:28] goes forth to Winter then get that gives
[34:30] forth to spring so if you're standing in
[34:31] winter you know Spring's coming right so
[34:34] if you're standing in a cold season of
[34:35] your life Spring's coming hallelujah
[34:38] amen if you you have the cold wind of
[34:41] indifference is blowing in your life
[34:43] Spring's coming amen amen you can be
[34:45] look forward to another season we know
[34:47] even families brother Bram says go
[34:49] through day and night cycles so if
[34:51] you're living in a night cycle
[34:52] everything's going a bit Rocky the day
[34:54] is coming amen hallelujah So Different
[34:56] Seasons give way to New Seasons and then
[34:59] so he would stand and he would say now
[35:01] it is peace and and he speaks the
[35:04] message Shalom it says now we're going
[35:06] to tell you what it's all about and he'd
[35:08] say that the peace of God has risen upon
[35:11] the people hallelujah hallelujah that is
[35:14] not the wrath of God it's not the
[35:16] trouble of God it's not anything
[35:18] negative it's the peace of God he says
[35:20] to the bride Shalom or God's peace be
[35:23] upon thee now this woman was instructed
[35:25] by the Lord thy faith has saved thee
[35:28] go in peace amen so so he she sorry she
[35:32] is told by the Messiah walk in my peace
[35:35] my peace be upon thee you the trouble
[35:38] you came with you're not walking out
[35:40] with it I've taken care of it you've
[35:41] placed it upon me and now you're walking
[35:43] out of my peace isn't it amazing that we
[35:45] can we can trade trouble for peace we
[35:48] can we we can trade a broken life for a
[35:50] whole life amen we can we can try trade
[35:53] the you know um Spirit of heaviness for
[35:56] the Garment of joy
[35:58] hallelujah praise God Lord amen so so so
[36:01] brother BR would preach these things
[36:03] because he's trying to he's trying to
[36:05] get the people to see now this is a
[36:06] different season we've had a night
[36:08] season we've had a troubled season but
[36:10] now it's the time of God's peace to rule
[36:13] and me it's time for the peace of God to
[36:14] rule in the people's hearts amen it's
[36:17] not the Peace of man ruling where which
[36:19] is based upon circumstances and how good
[36:21] your finances are and how good your jobs
[36:23] going and different things that move
[36:25] like the wind but no the peace of God is
[36:27] far deeper and stronger and greater and
[36:29] more stable than the Peace of of
[36:32] humanity cuz the humanity just gives a
[36:34] peace that can change right but God
[36:36] gives a peace that does not shift
[36:39] Hallelujah so now the greatest the
[36:42] greatest influence That Came Upon her
[36:45] life was the voice of the Messiah saying
[36:47] thy faith has saved thee go in peace and
[36:50] that word faith is the word Soo and it
[36:52] means just not not just save from sin
[36:54] but save from sickness but in the
[36:57] definition of it it means to remove
[36:59] every obstacle that would stop you from
[37:01] receiving the messiah's
[37:03] blessings hallelujah amen so her faith
[37:06] caused her to receive the blessings of
[37:08] the Messiah what what is the true
[37:11] blessings of the Messiah that thy sins
[37:13] be forgiven thee that there's nothing
[37:15] between thy soul and thy savior amen
[37:17] there's the chasmine bridge the blood
[37:19] completes I me makes you one unit with
[37:21] God himself amen so she would now walk
[37:23] in that peace now you're got to realize
[37:25] now the greatest influence in her life
[37:27] was now his words and there's no record
[37:30] that he that that sorry she ever saw him
[37:32] again maybe she was in the upper room
[37:34] maybe she wasn't we don't know but just
[37:36] based on this we're saying maybe she
[37:38] never saw him again in this in this
[37:40] flesh but yet she would spend the rest
[37:43] of her life living in the peace of God
[37:46] because his voice so gripped her life
[37:49] that when he spoke those things to her
[37:51] life she got up Justified hallelujah
[37:53] hallelujah she got up she didn't she
[37:55] didn't get up the way she went down amen
[37:57] and she walked out of there amen with
[37:59] the peace of God ruling in her heart
[38:02] hallelujah amen it's amazing how
[38:05] testimonies make different people react
[38:06] in different ways many testimonies cause
[38:10] trouble doesn't mean they didn't
[38:12] happen Mary would have a visitation of
[38:15] Gabriel there had been 800 years of of
[38:18] of No Doubt dads with with with with
[38:20] young young daughters who read the
[38:23] prophecy of Isaiah and said my
[38:25] daughter's going to be the one and for
[38:27] 800 years there would have been maybe an
[38:29] excitement in the family she's going to
[38:31] be the one that's going to bring forth
[38:32] Emanuel but finally God came to the came
[38:36] to one of the most sinful places in
[38:38] Israel Bethlehem at that time came to a
[38:41] woman that wasn't even considered and
[38:43] Gabriel was sent to her and said Mary
[38:45] you're highly favorite of God you're
[38:47] going to have the Messiah now she began
[38:50] to testify about this and her testimony
[38:53] wasn't just words but her her body begin
[38:55] to change how she walked begin to to
[38:57] change what she ate begin to change can
[38:59] you imagine maybe the day before she's
[39:01] enjoying her favorite meal with with um
[39:04] Joseph I don't know what kind of food
[39:06] they would have had maybe it's Egyptian
[39:07] I don't know maybe she having a kebab
[39:09] Turkish I don't know but then the day
[39:11] after that her taste buds change she
[39:15] can't control this there's a Life coming
[39:17] to her her whole life has changed and
[39:19] then then you know maybe her belly
[39:20] begins to swell all these things and she
[39:23] tells she tells Joseph Joseph yesterday
[39:26] was different
[39:28] what happened you're going to the well
[39:30] you go there every day no this was
[39:31] different Joseph I walked past a man
[39:34] there's always men on the way to the
[39:35] well you live in a city this was a
[39:37] different kind of a man there was a
[39:38] presence around him like I'd never
[39:40] experienced in my life he was about six
[39:42] foot tall Olive complexion head down to
[39:44] here robed in white and he knew me my
[39:46] knew me by name said Hail Mary and I
[39:49] stopped I thought how does he know my
[39:51] name and then he be to tell me the
[39:53] prophecies that we read about last week
[39:55] in Isaiah I was going to be the
[39:57] fulfillment of that Hallelujah now this
[40:00] didn't cause Joseph to
[40:02] Rejoice he was troubled in his heart he
[40:04] was going to privately put her away
[40:06] because he just couldn't understand what
[40:08] was going on so even even a sincere
[40:11] believing Israelite staggered at Mary's
[40:16] testimony did this make Mary doubt it
[40:18] didn't make Mary doubt why cuz the words
[40:21] of the Angel so anchored in her heart
[40:24] amen that she couldn't shake it amen
[40:25] just like I say the words of theeven
[40:27] seven th Angel this message has anchored
[40:29] into our hearts amen that's gripped Us
[40:31] in such a way like Mary and it becomes
[40:34] more than just a testimony of her words
[40:36] but it becomes a lived voice it becomes
[40:38] a living reality she couldn't help
[40:40] herself um she couldn't stop herself
[40:43] being pregnant she couldn't stop herself
[40:45] walking different talking different
[40:47] eating different but there's a life
[40:48] within her that took over her own life
[40:51] amen you think about this woman she was
[40:54] the only one at the feet of Jesus that
[40:55] day she was the only only one that heard
[40:57] those words when she went back to her
[41:00] house maybe she walked past all the same
[41:02] people she hurried past going
[41:04] there the next day she was a different P
[41:07] She was different person from then on
[41:09] but the next day she was still that
[41:10] different person and then maybe maybe
[41:13] her neighbors got curious and said what
[41:14] happened to you you're not standing on
[41:16] the corner anymore you're not doing
[41:18] these things anymore what happened to
[41:20] you and she began to describe how she
[41:22] got into Simon's house you mean you were
[41:24] there how did you get in Were you
[41:26] invited I wasn't invited well how'd you
[41:29] get in well I heard there's This Man
[41:31] Called Jesus and I saw him and something
[41:34] moved in my heart I had to get all my
[41:36] money I had I had to go buy that
[41:37] alabaster box that old Jones has in his
[41:39] in his Apothecary I had to go get it
[41:41] something moved in me I couldn't stop
[41:42] myself and I found myself at his feet
[41:45] and she would just relate the testimony
[41:47] of being in that presence trying to
[41:48] describe the presence of God to people
[41:51] who weren't there trying to just that
[41:52] the magnitude of being in the presence
[41:54] of the Creator and realizing your own
[41:56] State and all of of her all of her um
[41:58] reasoning left her and she realized who
[42:00] she was but she knew what she needed and
[42:02] she got what she needed and then she
[42:03] heard a voice it was his voice she
[42:06] didn't he what did what did he say to
[42:08] you did he condemn you did he kick you
[42:10] away I thought he was a holy man yeah he
[42:13] is a holy man he's the holy man amen but
[42:16] he said thy faith is saved the go in
[42:17] peace praise the Lord and they would say
[42:20] you mean Jesus Nazareth you mean that
[42:23] guy that doesn't belong to any Bible
[42:25] school I hear the priest call be alab he
[42:29] teaches false Doctrine he says we should
[42:31] eat flesh and drink blood that's
[42:33] directly contrary to the book of Moses
[42:35] he just causes trouble in synagogues he
[42:37] heals on the Sabbath none of the
[42:40] Pharisees like him the Sadducees are sad
[42:41] you see at him and you know no one's
[42:43] happy the high priest doesn't like
[42:46] him why are you believing his
[42:50] words and she would just say I can't
[42:53] explain it but he's more than a man yeah
[42:57] he's more than a man that word told me
[43:00] he's the word remember that I'm sinless
[43:02] and I'm and I'm walking in his peace now
[43:05] it's amazing when people try and
[43:07] quantify or work out what you
[43:09] believe compared to the denominations
[43:11] they think we're a bunch of cult they
[43:13] think we're crazy people we follow some
[43:16] man I follow the man Christ Jesus the
[43:17] word by the way Hallelujah and they say
[43:20] no that thing's just some wild thing
[43:22] there's no power to it there's no
[43:23] reality to it if they told that to her
[43:26] she'd say I beg to
[43:27] differ I'm not the same woman anymore
[43:31] I'm not the same person anymore and I'd
[43:33] say well how did you change yourself no
[43:35] I didn't change me he changed me how did
[43:37] he change me by the word he spoke to me
[43:40] amen his word changed my life amen it
[43:42] transformed my life it brought me to
[43:44] life I mean I realized who I am and
[43:46] where I'm going and I'm walking in his
[43:48] peace doesn't matter what the critic
[43:50] would say to her she had the experience
[43:53] the word was real to her so she could
[43:56] walk in that peace from that day till
[43:58] whenever she went into eternity she
[44:00] could walk under the peace of God
[44:02] hallelujah now this is the same thing
[44:04] with you and I friends it doesn't matter
[44:06] don't pay attention to the critic's
[44:08] voices don't let the critic be your
[44:10] absolute brother Braham says in the
[44:12] message absolute the one who leads you
[44:14] from the truth becomes your absolute
[44:16] don't let the critic be your absolute
[44:18] don't let this culture be your absolute
[44:20] don't let your friend Circle Be Your
[44:21] absolute let the word of God himself be
[44:23] your absolute let him be your biggest
[44:26] influence amen that you are more
[44:28] important to please him than this please
[44:30] this
[44:31] world Hallelujah so she walked on now
[44:35] walking in the peace of
[44:38] God hallelujah we walk in that same
[44:42] peace you got to realize what really
[44:44] what has
[44:45] you amen I say the Lord Jesus Christ has
[44:49] you amen amen the Apostle Paul would
[44:52] would would say this in um Second
[44:54] Corinthians let's try and find it here
[44:56] you know it's it's kind of scary when I
[44:57] make notes even slides and it's never in
[44:59] order but you know let's go to 2
[45:01] Corinthians chapter 4 because this peace
[45:05] is far greater than being this peace is
[45:08] not a lack of trouble the peace of God
[45:11] does not rule in an absence of trouble
[45:14] the peace of God rules in spite of
[45:16] trouble it rules in trouble I mean
[45:18] because God you can you imagine the
[45:21] critics this woman would have had first
[45:23] she had a bad name and now she had a
[45:25] worser name she's not a prostituted
[45:27] anymore but now she's a follower of
[45:30] Jesus she was accepted in society a
[45:32] little bit the Pharisees would buy her
[45:37] now she is kicked out of every Circle
[45:39] but she was walking under the peace of
[45:41] God now second Corinthians 4 we start
[45:44] from verse 8 I love the testimony of the
[45:47] Apostle Paul amen amen if you ever feel
[45:50] down and out need strength just read
[45:52] these words we are troubled on every
[45:54] side yet not distressed we are perplexed
[45:57] but not in despair persecuted but not
[45:59] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[46:02] should we read that again we're troubled
[46:03] on every side this is a time of trouble
[46:07] amen yet we are not distressed why could
[46:09] he say these words because the same one
[46:12] that met that woman was the same one
[46:14] that met him on the road to Damascus
[46:16] amen the same one that forgave her of
[46:18] her sins was the same one that forgave
[46:19] him of his sins I mean here's a Pharisee
[46:22] of the Pharisees but yet he began to
[46:23] walk in the peace of God maybe he would
[46:26] just intellect know the seven compound
[46:28] names of Jehovah I'm not going to try
[46:29] and rattle them off but one is Jehovah
[46:31] Shalom the Lord is our peace and you
[46:34] know it intellectually but when he met
[46:35] that God on the road to Damascus it went
[46:37] from an intellectual idea to a reality
[46:41] amen he had far more trouble after he
[46:43] met the Lord than before he was well
[46:45] thought of in every Circle he was in
[46:47] people would have been honored Simon
[46:49] would have loved to have Paul a soul of
[46:51] tarus at his
[46:54] Feast who's going to be your next guest
[46:56] next year
[46:57] Saul of tarus all the young Rabbi the
[46:59] young Pharisee he's real he's he he's
[47:03] amazing he was accepted he didn't have
[47:06] trouble but then when Jesus came his way
[47:10] he had trouble amen he would he would he
[47:13] would have a free night in a in a prison
[47:15] many places he was beaten he was
[47:18] Shipwrecked bitten by snake stoned
[47:20] rejected chased all kind of thing but
[47:25] yet friends
[47:27] May the peace of God rule in our hearts
[47:30] I mean May the external not control us
[47:33] but may the inside of the inside if God
[47:36] is in there I pray he is May that peace
[47:38] rule you have dominion over your life
[47:40] amen for We Are Trouble on every side
[47:42] yet not distressed we are perplexed but
[47:44] not in despair persecuted but not
[47:46] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[47:48] always bearing about in the body the
[47:50] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[47:52] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[47:54] our body for we which live are always
[47:56] delivered unto death for jesus' sake
[47:58] that the life also of Jesus might be
[48:00] made manifest in our mortal flesh so
[48:02] then death worketh in us but life in you
[48:05] we have the same Spirit of Faith
[48:06] according as as is written I believed
[48:09] therefore have I spoken we also believe
[48:11] and therefore speak knowing that he
[48:13] which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[48:14] raise up us also by Jesus and shall
[48:17] present us with you for all things are
[48:19] for your sakes that the abundant grace
[48:21] might through the Thanksgiving of many
[48:23] rebound to the glory of God for which
[48:25] cause we faint not though our outward
[48:27] man perish yet the inward man is renewed
[48:29] day by day for our light Affliction
[48:31] which is but for a moment worketh for us
[48:34] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[48:35] of Glory while we look not at the things
[48:38] which are seen but the things which are
[48:39] not seen for the things which are seen
[48:41] are temporal and I say it cannot give
[48:43] you peace but the things which are not
[48:45] are Eternal and give you the peace of
[48:49] God Amen he would say in he would say in
[48:52] um Philippians 4
[48:54] and6 this is the man that we just this
[48:57] was this was his life perplexed but not
[49:00] in despair distressed but not you know
[49:03] persecuted not forsaken this was him he
[49:06] would write to the Philippians remember
[49:07] remember the Apostle Paul what he wrote
[49:10] was experience amen it wasn't a nice
[49:12] idea he hatched up some poetic kind of
[49:15] thing that he just kind of lyrically put
[49:17] together no it was it was an experience
[49:20] he preached and he preached it with
[49:22] passion and he lived what he preached I
[49:24] mean he experienced what he preached and
[49:26] so in Philippian Ians 4:6 he say be
[49:28] careful for nothing but in everything by
[49:30] prayer and supplication with
[49:32] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[49:33] known unto God and the peace of God
[49:36] which passes passeth all understanding
[49:39] shall keep your hearts and Minds through
[49:42] Christ Jesus so he's giving you a very
[49:44] important key especially for this end
[49:46] time where Mental Health crisis has gone
[49:48] through the roof and taken the roof with
[49:50] it amen where where where mental health
[49:53] problems are never been like it is in
[49:55] this day but he giving us real good
[49:58] instructions this is how you let the
[50:00] peace of God keep your hearts and your
[50:03] minds through Christ Jesus remember our
[50:05] hearts are our seat of our emotion
[50:08] people's emotions have gone wild in this
[50:10] day people are anxious they're stressed
[50:12] they're all troubled they always people
[50:14] cross Bridges and then the next bridge
[50:16] to the next Bridge before they ever come
[50:17] to the first bridge and they just sing a
[50:19] big train wreck in front of they're
[50:21] panicking and they have to take all kind
[50:22] of medications and now if you have to
[50:23] that's up to you but you know God's a
[50:25] doctor all those you know if you need to
[50:27] take if you need to go to the doctor go
[50:29] right but there's something greater than
[50:30] medication that can keep your
[50:32] heart amen and and our and and minds of
[50:36] course that's our thoughts right that's
[50:38] our thought pattern so if we want the
[50:40] peace of God to keep us then we must be
[50:44] careful for nothing now this word
[50:46] careful doesn't mean we just are real
[50:48] loose and sloppy and you know just real
[50:50] laxidasical but this be careful this
[50:53] word careful means to be anxious to be
[50:56] troubled with cares to care about
[50:58] something but it's also to seek to
[51:01] promote one's interest this is this word
[51:04] careful so don't try and promote your
[51:07] own
[51:08] interest amen amen don't be don't don't
[51:12] be anxious don't be troubled with cares
[51:14] sure life is full of trouble but who do
[51:16] you put the trouble into whose hands
[51:18] whose hands hold the trouble do you keep
[51:21] it yourself or do you give it to him do
[51:23] you give it to the Lord do you commit
[51:25] All That You Are into his hands or do
[51:28] you bottle it up and hold on to it
[51:29] yourself I say if you hold on to
[51:31] yourself you'll become a very anxious
[51:33] stressed person amen the peace of God
[51:36] will not keep your heart but if you give
[51:38] it to him the peace of God which passes
[51:40] all understanding you say how can a man
[51:43] who is troubled on every side and not
[51:45] distressed and be perplexed but not in
[51:48] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[51:50] down but not destroyed how can a person
[51:52] that that that Liv that out so many
[51:54] times say that the that the peace of God
[51:57] can keep your heart and mind he lived it
[51:59] out he experienced
[52:01] it praise God Amen so don't be don't
[52:05] don't be don't be anxious about
[52:09] anything it doesn't mean we won't feel
[52:11] anxious but don't hold on to it don't
[52:13] let it dominate your life don't let
[52:16] unbelief consume you give it to the Lord
[52:18] if you have fears give it to him if
[52:21] you've got cares we all have cares we're
[52:22] human aren't we we have
[52:24] emotions amen give it to to him
[52:27] hallelujah amen don't be anxious about
[52:29] these things see if we try and control
[52:31] our own lives if we try and be the
[52:33] master of our own destiny we will be
[52:35] anxious people cuz we're trying to rule
[52:38] it but if you commit all your cares into
[52:40] his hands amen with in prayer and
[52:44] supplication with
[52:46] Thanksgiving always have Thanksgiving in
[52:49] your prayers we should be the most
[52:51] thankful people that there's ever lived
[52:54] amen we're living in Satan's Eden but
[52:56] yet we're not of Satan's Eden amen God
[52:58] has called us out of Darkness into his
[53:00] glorious light amen the glory of the
[53:02] Lord has risen upon us gross gross
[53:04] Darkness covers the people but the light
[53:06] of the Lord is risen upon thee amen we
[53:08] should be the most thankful amen if if
[53:11] if all you can pray is thank you Jesus
[53:13] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus I think
[53:15] that's a good prayer if you mean it from
[53:17] your heart you're so thankful that he's
[53:18] found you so thankful that he keeps you
[53:20] amen he guide you through trouble amen
[53:22] he'll navigate you through storms am
[53:24] mean don't be helpless don't think
[53:26] you're helpless don't think you're
[53:27] hopeless if you think that way you'll be
[53:30] anxious amen but sure if you realize the
[53:33] enemy one of my favorite quotes from how
[53:35] can I overcome is where brother Bram
[53:37] says you you say you're not sick you're
[53:39] sick you say you don't have a cancer
[53:41] it's a cancer it's a cancer but he says
[53:43] but you got to realize the one that's in
[53:45] you has already overcome this thing
[53:49] that's real overcoming that's perfectly
[53:51] sensible now you take that not just to
[53:54] sickness but to every trouble that comes
[53:57] your way you've got to realize the
[53:59] spirit of God within you has already
[54:01] overcome that thing am mean it says
[54:03] that's how you overcome you recognize
[54:05] your enemy but you recognize the one in
[54:07] you has already conquered that enemy
[54:09] amen how long's the battle going to go
[54:11] for I don't know but who's going to win
[54:13] hallelujah amen don't just don't just
[54:15] give one punch at it if the devil don't
[54:17] move keep punching him keep praising God
[54:19] don't quit just because the devil's
[54:21] still standing there he's bluffing you
[54:24] he's bluffing you are you going to call
[54:25] him at his bluff you going to give into
[54:27] his bluff it's really up to it's you
[54:30] know it's up to us what are we willing
[54:32] to die
[54:34] for when you get ready when you're
[54:37] willing to die for anything that's when
[54:38] you're willing to live for
[54:40] it amen amen if you're willing to die
[54:43] for the gospel that's when you're
[54:44] willing to live for it if you're willing
[54:46] to die to yourself that's when you can
[54:48] live for it amen Jesus said whosoever
[54:51] saveth saveth his life shall lose it and
[54:55] whoever loses his life my sake shall
[54:57] keep
[54:57] it right how do you lose your life you
[55:00] give it to him you see so don't be
[55:03] anxious don't look at the wall of giants
[55:04] around you you say well I can't win this
[55:07] battle but Jesus can there's no way my
[55:10] situation can change H jid Legions did
[55:14] the woman of the well did Peter did amen
[55:17] how many others did Moses's
[55:20] did amen Israel's situation changed
[55:23] David's did amen all the Believers down
[55:26] Through the Ages they had a time where
[55:27] the situation changed job's
[55:30] did praise God Amen so if we remember
[55:33] the Lord Jesus always makes a way of
[55:35] Escape but you've got to look for that
[55:37] way of Escape Lord show me the way of
[55:39] Escape out of this trial say I can't see
[55:42] it but we don't walk by sight we walk by
[55:45] faith you got to believe the Lord Jesus
[55:47] is going to take you through and he's
[55:48] going to give you the victory in every
[55:50] situation amen so don't be anxious for
[55:53] nothing but in everything in prayer and
[55:54] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[55:56] request be known un be known unto God
[55:59] and the peace of God which passeth all
[56:01] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[56:03] Minds through Christ
[56:05] Jesus shall keep your hearts not maybe
[56:08] shall the Apostle Paul knew what he was
[56:10] talking about amen I think we can take
[56:14] God at his word and walk the same way he
[56:17] did amen with every trouble see don't be
[56:20] anxious amen don't be worried just let
[56:22] God just realize that God when you
[56:25] really meet
[56:27] that's when the peace of God that passes
[56:28] all understanding enters into your heart
[56:30] brother Braham says in Hebrews chapter 5
[56:33] and 6 he says but in this place we come
[56:35] by faith through Grace God called us we
[56:37] hang our we lay our hands on the head of
[56:40] the Lamb of
[56:41] God we hear that swinging Hammer we hear
[56:44] that voice I thirst give me drink father
[56:46] lay not the sin to their charge they
[56:48] don't know what they're doing see by
[56:50] faith we feel his death um there in our
[56:54] stead way down in our hearts comes a
[56:55] deep settled peace when a voice says
[56:58] your pardon now go and sin no more now
[57:01] by Grace then we walk away not with the
[57:03] same desire but but a desire never to
[57:07] sin no more or do anything wrong the
[57:09] peace that passes all understanding has
[57:12] entered our
[57:14] heart praise God so if God has done a
[57:18] work that you just want to serve him now
[57:20] remember peace of God does not equal
[57:22] absence of trouble absence of anx worry
[57:26] things going on the peace of God comes
[57:29] in and it's it doesn't make sense how we
[57:32] can stand in trouble and be
[57:35] rejoicing how can see humanly it makes
[57:38] no sense how can a people stand when
[57:41] they see the world falling apart they
[57:42] see trouble in every hand but lift up
[57:44] their heads and know their redemptions
[57:45] during n amen be full of joy unspeakable
[57:48] full of Glory why it's a peace that
[57:51] passes all human understanding amen so
[57:54] this woman walked out
[57:56] with the peace of God over her
[57:59] life
[58:01] she she was influenced by those words
[58:04] for the rest of her
[58:06] days
[58:08] amen Simon didn't get anything out of
[58:10] that
[58:11] Feast the footwash flunky and all of
[58:14] Simon's servants were more influenced by
[58:17] Simon than they were Jesus they knew he
[58:20] was a prophet they knew he did Miracles
[58:24] they they heard all the testimonies
[58:26] right but yet the influence of Simon was
[58:29] more important upon their life to them
[58:32] than the very Messiah coming into
[58:33] Simon's house and their actions proved
[58:36] it if they were if they believe that the
[58:39] influence you know if they really did
[58:40] believe Jesus was a prophet and his
[58:42] influence was the greatest one the foot
[58:44] wash flunky would have washed his feet I
[58:46] don't care if I get fired hey if this is
[58:48] the last time here it's going to be a
[58:49] good day I mean the man who anointed
[58:51] with oil said I don't care I'm going to
[58:52] anoint him if I get fired it's going to
[58:54] be my last time in this place I might as
[58:56] anoint the greatest one the last the
[58:58] last person I ever get an opportunity to
[59:00] anoint in this place might as will be
[59:01] him amen the one who kissed and made
[59:04] welcome said well if I'm if I'm not
[59:06] going to welcome anyone else in this
[59:07] place I'm going to get fired what I'm
[59:08] about to do it's going to be the Lord
[59:10] yeah but you see the influence of Simon
[59:13] was more
[59:15] important than this
[59:17] one but yet and it's amazing Jesus would
[59:21] Jesus would identify their actions the
[59:23] source of their actions as Simon himself
[59:25] when you know opening scripture he would
[59:27] say um uh he turned to the woman said
[59:31] unto Simon seeth thou this woman I
[59:33] entered thy house thou gave me no water
[59:35] for my feet who but who had the bowl not
[59:37] Simon the footwash flunky you gave me no
[59:40] kiss who the one who kiss May welcome
[59:42] the one who did that with my head you
[59:45] did with oil you did not anoint he
[59:47] wasn't doing it someone else was doing
[59:49] it but the influence upon them came from
[59:51] Simon I pray the influence Upon Our
[59:54] Lives comes from the Lord Jesus amen
[59:56] that everything we do is him in action
[59:59] amen that the greatest influence in our
[1:00:01] lives is Redeeming Grace amen that he
[1:00:04] has he has called us out of Darkness
[1:00:06] into marvelous light that truly we can
[1:00:08] stand in this day where there's trouble
[1:00:10] on every hand but trouble's not in US I
[1:00:12] mean and the reason trouble's not in US
[1:00:14] is because not because there's no
[1:00:15] trouble but because we know the one who
[1:00:17] can speak peace we know the one that can
[1:00:20] give the answer we know the one that can
[1:00:22] meet the need amen that we're not here
[1:00:24] ringing our hands saying how's it all
[1:00:26] going to work out we can say thank you
[1:00:27] Jesus I don't know how you're going to
[1:00:29] do it I don't know when you're going to
[1:00:31] do it but I believe you're going to do
[1:00:32] it amen you can have see the Apostle
[1:00:36] Paul his greatest Victory like Abraham's
[1:00:39] greatest Victory is when he surrendered
[1:00:41] himself and became a prisoner amen
[1:00:44] Abraham would Abraham would wrestle it
[1:00:47] out praise God and then he paid ties to
[1:00:50] malesic amen see he Abraham had to come
[1:00:54] to a place where what God said was
[1:00:56] greater than what he thought what he
[1:00:59] heard what he
[1:01:01] imagined amen he came to a place where
[1:01:04] that Revelation had preeminence in his
[1:01:05] life amen where the peace of God ruled
[1:01:08] in his life amen and then Sarah had to
[1:01:10] have the same kind of visitation where
[1:01:12] she believed the word
[1:01:15] amen praise God hallelujah you see she
[1:01:20] realized if God said so it settles it
[1:01:23] that's it he is the amen part of how he
[1:01:26] introduced himself to this age says I'm
[1:01:28] the amen the beginning of the creation
[1:01:30] of God Amen means finality it means so
[1:01:33] be it he has the last say Amen so when
[1:01:36] she heard those words thy faith has
[1:01:38] saved thee go in peace she heard the
[1:01:40] amen speaking to her she heard the final
[1:01:43] say she heard the supreme authority she
[1:01:45] did not hear an opinion she did not hear
[1:01:47] an argument she heard the final
[1:01:49] Authority saying thy faith has saved
[1:01:51] thee go in peace so whenever any voice
[1:01:54] counted his voice she said no you're not
[1:01:56] the amen you don't have the final say
[1:01:59] he's already spoken it over my life amen
[1:02:01] I have the peace of God I'm walking on
[1:02:04] Amen and God would stand in this day and
[1:02:06] he would prove his word he would speak
[1:02:09] his voice to a redeemed son of man amen
[1:02:11] and what is it it is the Amen on the
[1:02:14] scripture praise God we have heard the
[1:02:16] final Authority on the word amen we
[1:02:18] don't have a collection of Bible schools
[1:02:20] to tell us what the Bible means we have
[1:02:22] had given a direct word from God to
[1:02:24] reveal Christ in the scripture
[1:02:26] amen so now if he has said you never did
[1:02:29] it in the first place I trust these
[1:02:30] words really grip you amen he's not just
[1:02:34] you know the prophet doesn't just preach
[1:02:36] sermons this is not just stories right
[1:02:40] there's not just good teaching and nice
[1:02:41] things no this is the words of life in
[1:02:43] print formall amen so when you begin to
[1:02:46] read it when when you know when the
[1:02:47] Apostle Paul would say that he has
[1:02:50] broken down the middle wall of partition
[1:02:51] between us who's the US he's talking to
[1:02:54] he's talking to me God is letting me
[1:02:57] knowu amen hallelujah you read the book
[1:03:00] of Ephesians put you in the book amen
[1:03:03] I've been predestined to the adoption of
[1:03:05] sons I believe that the amen has told me
[1:03:08] that amen the amen has said that I am as
[1:03:11] bone of his bone flesh is flesh Life Is
[1:03:13] Life I'm part of him the amen has said
[1:03:16] that so now if he has spoken these
[1:03:18] things should it not grip us more than
[1:03:21] everything that's around us shouldn't
[1:03:23] our lives be dictated to by the amen of
[1:03:26] God more than what other people say amen
[1:03:29] amen we you know we need to realize that
[1:03:31] the that the critic's voice will not be
[1:03:34] silenced just because God has spoken no
[1:03:36] that's when the critic is actually
[1:03:38] Amplified he speaks in a greater way but
[1:03:41] his voice doesn't mean if you're
[1:03:43] influenced by the word of God greater
[1:03:45] than the critic the critic doesn't mean
[1:03:48] anything amen
[1:03:51] am but doesn't it hurt you when people
[1:03:53] criticize absolutely
[1:03:56] doesn't it trouble you yes it does but
[1:03:58] yet there's a peace of God that passes
[1:04:00] all understanding when I realize the
[1:04:02] Supreme one has purchased my salvation
[1:04:05] the Supreme one has said
[1:04:07] Shalom that was God speaking not him God
[1:04:10] used brother Brown to speak to me
[1:04:13] peace this world is falling apart but
[1:04:15] you've got peace what peace do I have
[1:04:18] not my own peace not a human
[1:04:20] manufactured peace the peace of God Amen
[1:04:22] and I'm walking in it Hallelujah
[1:04:26] amen Paul would say in in Colossians 3
[1:04:29] and let the peace of God rule in your
[1:04:32] hearts to which also ye are called in
[1:04:34] one body and be ye thankful let the word
[1:04:37] of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[1:04:40] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:04:41] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:04:44] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[1:04:45] Lord and whatsoever you do in word or
[1:04:47] deed do all in the name of the Lord
[1:04:49] Jesus giving thanks to him and the
[1:04:51] father by him that's right so he's
[1:04:54] saying you got to let the peace of God
[1:04:56] rule in your heart well how do I let it
[1:04:58] rule my emotions begin to think about
[1:05:00] what he's done for you begin to meditate
[1:05:03] upon his
[1:05:05] testimonies that's how you let it rule
[1:05:07] see the devil wants you to to forget
[1:05:09] everything God's ever done he tries to
[1:05:12] explain he even tries to explain away
[1:05:14] from you what God's done in your life
[1:05:16] does he not he does it to me he tries to
[1:05:18] make us remember
[1:05:19] this we God gives us a testimony because
[1:05:23] he wants you to realize you're his child
[1:05:26] right because remember this is an age of
[1:05:27] identity people are identifying as many
[1:05:30] different things but then when God comes
[1:05:31] down and says you're one of mine that
[1:05:33] settles everything right so God has
[1:05:35] called us saying we are his children
[1:05:37] should we not walk in that
[1:05:40] identity amen there's people identify as
[1:05:42] many things out there and they push
[1:05:44] against every kind of barrier every kind
[1:05:45] of social Prejudice because they say I'm
[1:05:49] this but they have nothing backing them
[1:05:51] up apart from their own
[1:05:53] self-will what about the people where
[1:05:56] all of Heaven is behind amen what about
[1:05:59] a people where God has said you're my
[1:06:01] daughter you're my son I've called you
[1:06:02] by my grace amen it's not just us
[1:06:05] claiming something it's God claiming
[1:06:07] you amen so if you begin to think about
[1:06:10] all he has done I probably I feel like a
[1:06:12] broken record from months on in but if
[1:06:13] we really if we keep our minds on What
[1:06:16] the Lord Has Done and he's not stopped
[1:06:20] he hasn't
[1:06:21] quit amen that's how you let the peace
[1:06:23] of God rule in your heart
[1:06:27] sing songs speaking in wisdom
[1:06:29] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[1:06:31] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[1:06:34] Grace in your hearts to the Lord You'
[1:06:36] been to think on the Lord what happens
[1:06:37] an atmosphere comes around you amen the
[1:06:40] peace that's within comes
[1:06:42] out praise the
[1:06:44] Lord amen and I trust and well from
[1:06:48] experience what God can change your
[1:06:50] whole outlook you you can have the worst
[1:06:53] day of your life and you start thinking
[1:06:55] about the Lord start singing his songs
[1:06:57] that's it and it becomes the most
[1:06:59] glorious
[1:07:00] time Paul and Silas around midnight
[1:07:02] started singing to the Lord in an inner
[1:07:04] prison I don't know what they did from
[1:07:06] the time they arrested to the time they
[1:07:07] got in there but there was a gap of time
[1:07:09] between the time they were thrown in the
[1:07:11] time they started
[1:07:13] singing amen the main thing is they
[1:07:15] started singing talking about how God
[1:07:17] was to them the peace of God was ruling
[1:07:19] them they were beaten they were in a
[1:07:22] prison they didn't know what was going
[1:07:23] to happen but that didn't matter to them
[1:07:24] cuz they knew who whom they have
[1:07:25] believed hallelujah amen I want a good
[1:07:28] outcome in this thing no the main thing
[1:07:30] is Lord live do what you want to do Lord
[1:07:34] praise God that's why Paul when he got
[1:07:35] to the end of his road because he he had
[1:07:38] been living under the peace of God when
[1:07:39] he heard that that the death sentence
[1:07:41] had been signed your head's coming off
[1:07:43] boy he didn't throw a tantrum he didn't
[1:07:45] say what a waste of time God if you're
[1:07:48] so powerful look at me look what you've
[1:07:49] done to my life no he said praise God
[1:07:53] I've got a crown amen hallelujah I'm
[1:07:55] going to put it
[1:07:57] on and not just me but everyone else
[1:07:59] that loves his glorious appearing amen
[1:08:01] so God would allow those troubles to
[1:08:04] come into his life that the peace of God
[1:08:06] would be flowing through his life that
[1:08:09] when we read the word of God what's that
[1:08:13] it's the peace of God coming into US
[1:08:15] yeah we can draw strength from Paul's
[1:08:17] trouble isn't that
[1:08:18] funny just like the Psalms God had
[1:08:21] Psalms that needed to be written how's
[1:08:24] he going to write them is he going to
[1:08:25] put David in an ivory Tower with no
[1:08:26] trouble no he's going to put them in a
[1:08:28] time of great trouble a time of a lot of
[1:08:31] distress a lot of trouble going on in
[1:08:33] his life because he had songs that had
[1:08:35] to be written yeah God had songs in him
[1:08:37] that had to be
[1:08:38] written God puts us in trouble he wants
[1:08:41] to express he didn't want to express
[1:08:42] David he he didn't want to express Paul
[1:08:44] he wanted to express Christ out of him
[1:08:47] amen so that's why we shouldn't throw
[1:08:48] attention when Trouble Comes our way say
[1:08:51] praise God you want to express yourself
[1:08:52] in me Lord hallelujah when when when
[1:08:55] when strike our Liv sickness whatever it
[1:08:56] is praise God when our family go
[1:08:59] sideways praise God you want to express
[1:09:02] something in my life I'm not a crazy man
[1:09:03] I know where I'm standing if the Apostle
[1:09:06] Paul can stand there and rejoice with
[1:09:07] far worse you know have I ever been in
[1:09:10] prison no have I been beaten go imagine
[1:09:13] if I came home from a missionary trip
[1:09:15] you want to see the scars I got beaten I
[1:09:17] got thrown in that prison I got stoned
[1:09:19] here were you discouraged no praise the
[1:09:22] Lord I'm walking in the footsteps of the
[1:09:24] Apostle Paul
[1:09:26] Hallelujah you know what I mean I think
[1:09:28] we should turn trouble into joy we
[1:09:31] should look at things a bit
[1:09:34] differently some people aren't uh what
[1:09:37] do you call it but
[1:09:39] hey always look at the good side of
[1:09:44] things you know the armac company girl
[1:09:46] story I'm going to close with this we'll
[1:09:49] not but I just enjoy it I enjoyed this
[1:09:51] this afternoon I was it I have such a
[1:09:53] good time sometimes anyway
[1:09:55] you just think about God God's
[1:09:58] awesome you know it's amazing the
[1:10:00] prophet would take a story that Moody
[1:10:01] first told but he'd make it live and
[1:10:04] he'd say there was a girl and she was an
[1:10:06] orphan girl she it was like a Cinderella
[1:10:08] story but it really happened just like
[1:10:10] we're living a story it's really it's
[1:10:12] really happening this is not this is not
[1:10:14] a fantasy world we live in this is
[1:10:16] reality I mean when she was a she was an
[1:10:18] orphan girl she went and lived out on
[1:10:20] this big Ranch and you know with her
[1:10:21] cousins and her and her um well their
[1:10:24] parents whatever more
[1:10:25] and this Ranch wasn't theirs but it was
[1:10:27] owned by this armor company a big
[1:10:29] wealthy family from
[1:10:30] Chicago and uh one day the son of the
[1:10:33] owner of this company who owned the
[1:10:35] ranch was going to come to the ranch and
[1:10:37] just have a look around and things you
[1:10:38] know the story just enjoy it with me I
[1:10:40] mean so so here here was this woman you
[1:10:42] here was this young lady she was
[1:10:43] destitute she was orphan she was made
[1:10:45] fun of by her cousins and you know they
[1:10:47] would see see words have power and they
[1:10:49] would tell her she's good for nothing
[1:10:50] she's going to be our be be be the
[1:10:52] servant they probably never thanked her
[1:10:54] a day in her life for everything she did
[1:10:56] for them probably just told her off and
[1:10:58] beat her made fun of her and you know
[1:10:59] tried to tear her down those words
[1:11:02] dragged her way down but then the armor
[1:11:04] company son came to the ranch and the
[1:11:07] sisters well her cousins thought that
[1:11:09] they're going to marry this boy and then
[1:11:11] they put on a big party big ho down
[1:11:13] Shing in the barn and all these things
[1:11:14] and you know she's not invited it's
[1:11:18] amazing who God invites and who people
[1:11:20] think should be there are two different
[1:11:21] Polar Opposites amen because I wasn't
[1:11:24] invited by man God invited me I mean I
[1:11:27] wasn't man wasn't looking for me I thank
[1:11:30] God but God was looking for me I mean so
[1:11:32] so there she was she was out the back of
[1:11:34] the party and you know probably your
[1:11:35] bare feet raggedy dress play feeling
[1:11:37] sorry for herself that she wasn't welcom
[1:11:39] in the thing but you know but then but
[1:11:41] then she heard some footsteps as she's
[1:11:43] tipping dishw water over the fence and
[1:11:45] it was the son it was the arm company
[1:11:46] boy son and and and you know she felt
[1:11:49] embarrassed because the state she was in
[1:11:50] and and and she had heard how rich he
[1:11:52] was and you know he would he would say
[1:11:54] to her I've been I've been I've watching
[1:11:55] you I've been watching you God's been
[1:11:57] watching us the whole time God's been
[1:11:59] watching us the whole time and our
[1:12:01] Brokenness he sees and he cares and our
[1:12:04] times are upset we're trouble we don't
[1:12:06] know the way he sees and he cares and
[1:12:08] he's Mindful and he bears with us amen
[1:12:11] amen and there so there she is feeling
[1:12:13] all embarrassing things by the way she
[1:12:15] was dressed and he said you I've been
[1:12:16] watching you and you know I I came out
[1:12:18] here not to look for the ranch you know
[1:12:20] my dad owns this and we know what goes
[1:12:22] on here anyway but I'm here looking for
[1:12:24] a wife I'm here looking for character
[1:12:26] and he said I
[1:12:28] believe that's you and maybe she be to
[1:12:33] think why is he saying this to me did
[1:12:35] you you have that feeling when God first
[1:12:37] called you you feel about this big my my
[1:12:40] fingers are together by the way you
[1:12:42] think how on Earth could he ever forgive
[1:12:44] me and save me but yet something's
[1:12:46] pulling you to him and she was pulled to
[1:12:48] this man and then so he said he said you
[1:12:51] know in a year's time I'm going to come
[1:12:54] and get I'm going to spend a year get us
[1:12:56] a nice big house in Chicago I'm going to
[1:12:58] send the money for the dress all these
[1:12:59] things and in a year's time we're going
[1:13:01] to get married maybe gets that on one
[1:13:03] KNE and says will you marry me remember
[1:13:05] that moment where God said will you
[1:13:07] marry me will you become one with me
[1:13:09] will you enjoy eternity with me praise
[1:13:12] the Lord I trust we're going down memory
[1:13:14] lane this is how the peace of God rules
[1:13:16] in your heart amen and of course you
[1:13:19] said yes Hallelujah maybe he picked her
[1:13:22] up gave her a big kiss I don't know and
[1:13:24] then and then he left
[1:13:26] the next day for her was exactly the
[1:13:29] same as the first day she was living in
[1:13:32] the same house she was doing the same
[1:13:34] chores her cousins were still mean am
[1:13:37] mean her their parents were probably
[1:13:38] still mean to her they thought she was
[1:13:40] nothing but she came under the influence
[1:13:43] of a different word hallu a different
[1:13:45] sound amen so the peace of God if I'm
[1:13:49] put it that way begin to rule in her
[1:13:50] heart he's coming back for me amen
[1:13:55] Hallelujah he's coming back for me amen
[1:13:58] so the days were the same the chores
[1:14:00] were the same the cousins were the same
[1:14:03] come friends one day one day to the next
[1:14:07] was probably you live the same kind of
[1:14:09] life but what happened in the middle of
[1:14:11] that is when God came and interrupted
[1:14:12] your life and met you and changed your
[1:14:14] life that means you're the same person
[1:14:16] well actually you're a different person
[1:14:18] living in the different house but in the
[1:14:20] same way maybe the same job the same
[1:14:22] family the same everything like she did
[1:14:24] the woman with the alabaster the box
[1:14:25] right but she was transformed by the
[1:14:27] word she heard and this I'm a company
[1:14:30] girl I put it that way her whole life
[1:14:32] was transformed on the inside by what he
[1:14:35] promised
[1:14:37] her hallelujah hallelujah so before that
[1:14:40] happened she thought what's my future
[1:14:42] what's what does my future hold I'm
[1:14:44] nothing I'm never going to get married
[1:14:46] I'm going to be stuck here for the rest
[1:14:47] of my life but when he spoke those
[1:14:50] words she realized I'm leaving I'm not
[1:14:54] staying here he's coming to get me and
[1:14:57] she be to make a countdown and then the
[1:14:59] money came for the dress and she bought
[1:15:02] the dress and it fitted just right and
[1:15:05] you know the closer the days got the
[1:15:07] scorning and the making fun of the of
[1:15:09] the cousins became became worse cuz
[1:15:12] maybe she just bouted out one day maybe
[1:15:14] she had a smile on her face she didn't
[1:15:16] have the day
[1:15:17] before praise the Lord and they said
[1:15:19] what's up with you I'm getting married
[1:15:23] and maybe they laughed at her more fun
[1:15:25] of her who are you marrying the armor
[1:15:28] company boy that you couldn't win he
[1:15:30] came looking for me Hallelujah but it
[1:15:34] was more than words because the dress
[1:15:37] came this came different things came and
[1:15:39] then the day finally came she was
[1:15:41] standing on the porch in her wedding
[1:15:42] gown and they gathered just to see what
[1:15:45] was going to go on they thought man this
