[11:40] good evening brothers sisters apology
[11:44] step and ideas are late but on my way
[11:47] here I thought no I'm not late perfect
[11:51] timing are we here
[11:54] yeah I listened to a sermon today I
[11:59] actually don't know what is the sermon
[12:01] from brother branham but he he was
[12:03] talking about the green ticket shirt and
[12:05] the 42 inches deer and all this kind of
[12:09] thing so I don't know what is it
[12:10] differently spoke to me sorry was that
[12:13] Spirit of Truth and I was thinking about
[12:19] so well yeah it's it's it's me and
[12:23] Joshua's first time here song leading
[12:26] together we've always been part of the
[12:28] band and I was just thinking wow man
[12:30] what a what a privilege yes for me but
[12:33] what a glorious time that there's a
[12:36] quickening you know we see like last
[12:40] last Wednesday's pre-meeting you know
[12:42] that the children praying having those
[12:44] freedom levity and then and then
[12:47] the sincerity and the deepness that come
[12:48] through that prayer is oh it was almost
[12:52] unexpected for me and then I sat back
[12:54] and said well why is it you must expect
[12:57] this we are living it it's it's not a
[13:00] doctrine that we just you know trying to
[13:02] get into them it's a it's a pure life
[13:04] that we try to live and love and my
[13:09] question that I put to myself and that
[13:12] I'm going to put to you with this
[13:15] quickening that is in the word this
[13:17] quickening that they may prophesy before
[13:20] Jesus come what will you do if your kid
[13:27] comes to you and I take an example from
[13:29] brother Branham he said to this brother
[13:33] that went hunting with him with a green
[13:35] ticket shirt he said you've got a
[13:36] brother with epilepsy and his brother is
[13:40] seven 800k miles away and he said go to
[13:45] him and when he gets another attack
[13:48] ripped the shirt off his back and say in
[13:51] the Lord of you know in the name of the
[13:53] Lord Jesus it will not happen again no
[13:55] I'm just paraphrasing and I thought now
[13:58] if one of my kids come to me with a thus
[14:02] saith the Lord and it's and I'll take an
[14:06] example from us fly to South Africa
[14:08] there's a brother my dad maybe or
[14:12] someone with diabetes with some sort of
[14:14] sickness with something that that needs
[14:18] obedience you know I need to step in
[14:21] faith and do that will we do it to fly
[14:27] to Auckland there's one thing to drive
[14:29] through the next town is another thing
[14:31] but when the squeakin income are we
[14:34] ready for it and I pray that we that we
[14:38] can get to that point in that expectancy
[14:41] in our lives that we know we can we can
[14:44] trust these discernment and the
[14:47] authority and the boldness that's going
[14:49] to be harvested through them and yeah I
[14:54] just want to leave a big I don't want to
[14:56] I don't want to be the preacher
[14:59] Pablito velvet yeah let's stand and sing
[15:04] we gotta start somewhere and I think the
[15:08] little light that we need to shine needs
[15:10] to be a big light there's a lot of
[15:13] darkness around us but I've seen what a
[15:15] little match can do in a dark little Hut

[15:21] light so can we yeah be that like today

[39:19] you don't mind we're gonna read the
[39:20] whole chapter
[39:29] this is here Genesis 23 verse 1 it says
[39:32] and Sarah was a hundred and seven and
[39:34] twenty years old these were the years of
[39:37] the life of Sarah and Sarah died and in
[39:40] Kidd Yarborough and the same as Hebron
[39:44] in the land of Canaan and Abraham came
[39:48] to the to mourn for Sarah and to weep
[39:51] for her and Abraham stood up from before
[39:53] his dead and spake unto the sons of Heth
[39:55] saying I'm a stranger and a sojourner
[39:57] with you give me a possession
[40:00] give me a possession a burying-place
[40:02] with you that I might bury my dead out
[40:04] of my sight and the children of Heth
[40:07] answered Abraham and said unto Him hear
[40:09] us my lord thou art a mighty Prince
[40:11] among us and the choice of our simple
[40:13] cos bury thy did none of us shall
[40:16] withhold from the his Sepulchre but that
[40:19] thou mayst bury thy did and Abraham
[40:21] stood up and bowed himself to the people
[40:23] of the land even to the children of here
[40:25] and he communed with them saying if it
[40:28] be your mind that I should bury my dead
[40:31] out of my sight hear me and treat me and
[40:34] treat from me to Ephron the son of Zohar
[40:40] which he hath which is in the end of his
[40:43] field for so much money as is worth he
[40:46] shall give it me for a possession for a
[40:49] bearing place among you and if from
[40:51] dwell among the children of Heth and
[40:54] ephron the hittite answered Abraham and
[40:56] the audience of the children of Heth
[40:57] even to all that went in at the gate of
[41:00] a city saying nay my lord
[41:02] hear me the field which I the field give
[41:07] IV in the cave that is therein I giveth
[41:09] thee in the presence of the sons of my
[41:12] people give I at the berry the idea and
[41:15] Abraham bowed down himself before the
[41:17] people of the land and spake unto Efron
[41:20] in the audience of the people of the
[41:22] land saying but if thou wilt give it I
[41:25] pray thee hear me I will give the money
[41:28] for the field take it of me and I'll
[41:31] bury my dead there and everyone answered
[41:33] Abraham saying unto Him my lord hearken
[41:35] unto me the land is worth four hundred
[41:37] shekels of silver what does that betwixt
[41:40] me and thee bury therefore they did
[41:43] and Abraham Harkin under Efron and
[41:45] Abraham Wade to you from the silver
[41:47] which he had named in the audience of
[41:50] the sons of Heth four hundred shekels of
[41:51] silver current money which with the
[41:54] merchant and the field of Ephron which
[41:56] was mikela which was before memory the
[41:59] field and the cave which was therein and
[42:01] all the trees that run the field and
[42:03] were and all the borders roundabout were
[42:06] made sure and to Abraham for a position
[42:09] and the presence of the children of Heth
[42:10] before all that went in at the gate of a
[42:13] city and after this Abraham buried Sarah
[42:16] his wife and the cave of the field of
[42:18] Machpelah before memory the same as
[42:21] Hebron in the land of Canaan and the
[42:24] field and the cave that is therein was
[42:26] made sure unto Abraham for a possession
[42:29] of a burying-place by the sons of Heth
[42:32] amen may the Lord bless his word you may
[42:34] have your seats like to I trust this is
[42:38] a very familiar scripture to us all you
[42:42] know we are approaching Christmas and
[42:44] Christmas is not tinsel and Santa Claus
[42:47] Christmas is eternal life coming
[42:50] Christmases as a memorial of God gave us
[42:54] eternal life and that life was
[42:56] manifested in his son and there was a
[43:00] purchase that went on where God
[43:03] purchased a burying place for his loved
[43:06] ones for his precious ones now we read
[43:09] here in Genesis 23 where Abraham is a
[43:13] shadow bought a field and he bought a
[43:16] cave and he bought it to bury his
[43:19] beloved wife that had died now notices
[43:23] were as we read there they wanted to
[43:26] give him the field but he would not just
[43:28] just just take it he wanted to buy it
[43:30] and he wanted the boundaries of the
[43:33] field to me to be made sure and he
[43:36] wanted to wanted it to be in such a way
[43:38] that there would be known no dispute I
[43:40] belong this field belongs to me this is
[43:43] its boundaries this is this is how wide
[43:46] it is how long it is you know this is
[43:49] the definite boundaries of the field no
[43:52] one can lay claim against this field or
[43:54] any part of this field no one can say
[43:56] well
[43:56] belongs to me because I've made a public
[43:59] testimony in your eyes this field
[44:01] belongs to me we have to find the
[44:03] boundaries of the field we have to find
[44:06] what is in the in the field and we have
[44:08] also defined what I'm placing in the
[44:10] field now these things are very
[44:11] important because God God has God is in
[44:15] such a way that he doesn't want his
[44:17] enemy to have any claim upon anything
[44:21] that belongs to him he wants to and he
[44:24] has I believe by His grace to find a
[44:27] burying place for his beloved ones and
[44:30] that burying places in Christ Jesus amen
[44:34] let's go to Colossians three and three I
[44:36] believe it is if you don't mind reading
[44:38] a few a few scriptures you have
[44:47] Colossians three and three there
[44:57] that's is here well will read from this
[45:02] just read verse three that's all I want
[45:03] he says for ye are dead so the believers
[45:07] actually did did in crush you died to
[45:10] yourself you're not your natural life
[45:12] shouldn't be alive anymore I mean our
[45:15] natural traits that came down through
[45:16] our family the negative one should be
[45:19] gone amen
[45:21] ye are did this is Paul the Apostle Paul
[45:24] saying ye are dead and your life is hid
[45:27] with Christ in God amen and everyone
[45:30] should be able to say Amen I died one
[45:33] day and I was born again
[45:34] I was birthed than you not just a
[45:37] thought not just a nice feeling but I
[45:40] was literally my nature was changed
[45:42] everything how I looked at things was
[45:44] changed the things I once hated I loved
[45:47] and the things I once loved or hated I
[45:49] now hate it means that now there's a
[45:52] burying-place we are dead in Christ now
[45:55] Abraham as I see it he bought this field
[45:58] and this is the same place now this is
[46:02] in the promised land
[46:03] now the promised land we know to the
[46:06] juice as as Palestine we they are now
[46:09] and but but our promised land
[46:13] our inheritance is in Christ now the
[46:16] prophets were spiritual people I'm sure
[46:19] you can all agree with me
[46:20] they weren't carnal people they didn't
[46:22] want to be buried like Joseph you know
[46:26] you read in the book of Hebrews chapter
[46:27] 11 it says by faith Joseph spake
[46:30] concerning his bones when you are
[46:32] delivered when God says the deliverer to
[46:35] you to take you out of slavery out of
[46:37] Egypt and you gone to the inheritance
[46:39] into the promised land
[46:40] take my bones with me I mean with you
[46:43] don't leave my bones here no doubt he he
[46:46] could have had a very wonderful tomb in
[46:47] Egypt because he saved the whole Empire
[46:50] they meant he had the Heather Spirit of
[46:53] God upon him and he he saved without
[46:56] Joseph they would have gone into that
[46:58] famine and they would have had nothing
[47:00] to eat and and the Empire would have
[47:03] collapsed that that's how implies
[47:05] collapse and fail is a cyclone you go
[47:09] study history so so
[47:10] one man in the hands of God saved the
[47:13] whole place and we know that was you
[47:15] know for a greater purpose than just
[47:16] saving Egypt but he would have had a
[47:18] wonderful tomb they would have honored
[47:20] this man this man kept my dynasty going
[47:23] this man kept my my maybe my father
[47:25] Pharaoh on the throne by the knowledge
[47:28] he had he could had a great tomb but he
[47:31] was a spiritual man he said don't bury
[47:34] me in this place don't leave me down
[47:36] here whatever you do take when when God
[47:39] brings you up and he will take my bones
[47:42] carry them with you
[47:44] amen and take them up to take them up to
[47:47] the promised land
[47:48] and and the believing Jews no doubt when
[47:52] they looked at the sarcophagus or
[47:54] whatever that the bones are placed and
[47:56] they could have seen that as a as a
[47:58] memorial or as a promise God said to our
[48:01] forebears that these bones are not going
[48:04] to stay here they're going to leave and
[48:06] if they're gonna leave we're going to
[48:08] leave the land - and when they carried
[48:10] those bones up Joseph wanted to be
[48:13] buried in the promised land when when
[48:15] his father Jacob died Israel died he
[48:18] wasn't buried in Egypt they they took
[48:20] his body up into the Promised Land and
[48:22] no doubt he could have had a great tomb
[48:24] as workers Joseph was a very wealthy man
[48:26] but there are spiritual people they knew
[48:28] that there was no resurrection in Egypt
[48:31] doesn't matter how wonderful the term
[48:34] was how great the pyramid could be the
[48:36] architecture it could have been one of
[48:38] the seven wonders of the world they
[48:40] didn't want to be buried in a wonder of
[48:42] the world they want to be buried in a
[48:43] place where Israel where resurrection
[48:45] was coming hallelujah and that's why
[48:47] their bones were there and Abraham
[48:50] Abraham was spiritual amen he met the
[48:53] king of you know he was a sojourner it
[48:55] sees he says I'm a stranger among you
[48:57] I'm a sojourner and Paul picks it up he
[49:01] was looking for a city whose builder and
[49:03] maker is God and he was walking upon the
[49:08] ground when that city is going to come
[49:11] hallelujah the New Jerusalem is going to
[49:13] come on that piece of the earth he was
[49:15] walking around looking for the city the
[49:18] builder maker is God is because he met
[49:20] the king of that city and so that's why
[49:23] I believe he
[49:24] buried his wife yeah he bought the field
[49:26] in that place and he buried his wife in
[49:28] that place and Abraham himself was
[49:30] buried in that cave is because in your
[49:32] resurrection was going to be there I
[49:34] mean there's a new hit yeah you know the
[49:36] New Jerusalem was going to sit upon that
[49:38] place here's a spiritual man
[49:40] hallelujah now our promised land as I
[49:44] said it's not a is not a piece of real
[49:47] estate upon the earth amen
[49:50] but our promised land is in Christ Jesus
[49:52] hallelujah and so now I just that you're
[49:59] a believer not because it makes good
[50:02] families
[50:03] not because it answers the question of
[50:06] where did I come from and where I where
[50:08] am I going
[50:08] not just because you know it gives you a
[50:13] peace of passes all understanding and
[50:15] maybe it can you know
[50:16] Abraham was blessed with material things
[50:19] maybe some people they try and be
[50:20] Christians because they get some
[50:21] material blessing you know I trust it it
[50:24] goes beyond that I trust you're a
[50:26] believer beyond all those things and our
[50:29] nice family and nice relationship and
[50:31] yeah I trust it goes beyond that but I
[50:34] trusted the reason you're a believer is
[50:35] because you found a place where there's
[50:37] a resurrection coming amen and you want
[50:40] to be buried in that place I mean you
[50:42] want to be living in that place where
[50:44] there's going to be a resurrection and
[50:46] that's why it's so phenomenal to me
[50:48] amen where there's a people can be upon
[50:50] the earth and God can draw them to a
[50:52] burying place
[50:54] hallelujah and they can be buried in
[50:56] Christ Jesus hallelujah and they have an
[51:00] understanding there's a resurrection
[51:02] coming out of this place I don't want to
[51:04] be buried in the world I don't want to
[51:06] be buried in some church system or some
[51:08] religion someplace I'm going to be
[51:10] buried in the resurrected Jesus Christ
[51:12] all of my life I want to be did in my
[51:14] life hidden God with Christ hallelujah
[51:17] so Abraham made sure the boundary
[51:21] because he had an understanding that the
[51:25] devil it's like Moses Moses died his
[51:31] body was buried in a hidden place
[51:34] somewhere says in Jude
[51:37] Satan was disputing with the Archangel
[51:40] about the body of Moses where is he gone
[51:43] because his dead carcass belongs to me
[51:46] but he was buried from the brave city
[51:49] died on the mountain he had angel
[51:50] pallbearers to pack him away someplace
[51:53] they meant he did and said now that he
[51:57] was disputing where's his body and the
[52:00] Afghan you just said the Lord rebuke
[52:01] thee
[52:01] should we read this let's go to Jude
[52:05] because some of you're looking at me
[52:07] like what is this guy on about let's go
[52:12] to Jude and Jude is only one chapter we
[52:23] just have to start reading cuz I don't
[52:24] know where it is
[52:25] he's here yeah first night I've actually
[52:32] got it underlined he says yet Michael
[52:37] the Archangel disputed about the body of
[52:40] a when contending with the devil he
[52:43] disputed about the body of Moses does
[52:46] not bring against him a railing
[52:47] accusation but he said the Lord rebuke
[52:49] thee they had a contention where's his
[52:52] body it belongs to me it was buried in a
[52:55] secret place hallelujah because it
[52:58] wasn't the devil's property what do you
[53:00] mean it's just this is just flesh yeah
[53:03] but this earth doesn't belong to Satan
[53:05] this world that you live upon doesn't
[53:07] belong to Satan he thinks it belongs to
[53:10] him
[53:10] but it belongs to the children of God
[53:12] Amen it belongs to it belongs to us this
[53:16] earth belongs to you you know it belongs
[53:18] to you you know the you know we're you
[53:20] you've got probably earth this whole
[53:22] earth belongs that are redeemed sons and
[53:24] daughters of of Adam hallelujah this all
[53:28] belongs to us and now so so there's a
[53:32] secret place where we can be buried
[53:35] Alleluia this means the world to me this
[53:38] is what Christmas is all about Christmas
[53:41] isn't about just why did why did Jesus
[53:43] why was any boy why was he born why was
[53:47] he born in a manger what does the
[53:50] Christmas tree
[53:50] about well God was gonna say I'm gonna
[53:53] open up a burying-place
[53:54] where it's not gonna just be a parcel of
[53:57] land in Palestine that's gonna be a
[53:59] place that everyone can come and die in
[54:01] and can remainin and it doesn't matter
[54:05] if they have a they're alive and remain
[54:07] or they die in Christ Alleluia they are
[54:11] they are his purchased possession and
[54:13] there's no dispute of the contents of
[54:16] waters in Christ the devil has no claim
[54:20] just like the children of Heth they had
[54:22] no claim on the case
[54:24] they had no claim of anything within the
[54:26] boundary of that field amen
[54:28] because Abraham made it sure this all
[54:31] belongs to me and he made it sure it's
[54:34] repeated twice in the chapter it was
[54:36] made sure so here's now a lamb of God
[54:39] and he takes out else ends up Calvary
[54:42] that day he pays the price in full he
[54:46] pays the price and full hallelujah Peter
[54:49] he gives a full payment I'm in the devil
[54:52] and you know the great temptation said
[54:54] to Jesus if you just bowed down to me
[54:57] I'll give you all the kingdoms of the
[54:58] world but he wasn't going to receive it
[55:02] without paying for it first because he
[55:04] knew he was going to fall into it anyway
[55:06] hallelujah but he said no you can't give
[55:09] it to me I'm gonna buy it
[55:10] hallelujah I'm gonna buy it in full so
[55:13] it now belongs to me
[55:14] Amen then that's exactly what did it he
[55:17] went up Calvary he redeemed the earth he
[55:19] redeemed all of his children a mere past
[55:22] and present and future hallelujah he
[55:25] paid it in full I mean when the when the
[55:27] Saints of the Old Testament were under
[55:29] the blood of bulls and goats they went
[55:31] into paradise they had to wait because
[55:34] they couldn't have sinned higher because
[55:36] they're under the blood of bulls and
[55:37] goats and the blood of bulls and goats
[55:38] only covers sin they are in a waiting
[55:41] place hallelujah
[55:42] wouldn't we it would have been a
[55:43] glorious time amen cuz it wasn't a place
[55:47] of torment it was called paradise it was
[55:49] a wonderful place and no doubt they had
[55:51] a testimony meeting after testimony
[55:53] meeting and they are waiting when do you
[55:55] think it's going to happen I don't know
[55:57] and then another one comes through the
[55:59] door well it's happening in your age all
[56:01] this happened then another one comes in
[56:03] through the door
[56:04] what happened who are you I'm John the
[56:06] Baptist what did you fulfill I'm the
[56:08] voice of one crying in the wilderness oh
[56:10] why and Isaiah says to prepare the way
[56:13] the Lord yes and I pointed him out and
[56:17] there he is
[56:18] do you think they would have that would
[56:19] have got excited I mean they would have
[56:21] they would have been off their seats
[56:23] hallelujah because the time had come to
[56:25] an end this may be the last Christmas
[56:27] friends they were upon the earth and I
[56:30] say glory hallelujah what do you mean
[56:34] don't you want to grow old and and and
[56:36] see you girls grow up and get married
[56:38] whatever more it would be nice but not
[56:40] rather go to heaven I'd rather just take
[56:43] us off
[56:43] Lord take us all to heaven and then and
[56:46] then so John's there and then Lazarus
[56:50] came he's only there for a brief time
[56:53] where are you I got sick and died what
[56:58] happened well I was friends with this
[57:00] man called Jesus of Nazareth and then
[57:02] John says what he Salema God I and and
[57:06] death and and Lazarus I know I believe
[57:09] it but he didn't come I don't know why
[57:11] he didn't come and then they having
[57:13] fellowship and then he hears his name
[57:14] called he says I'm sorry I'll come back
[57:16] and tell you more later and he comes
[57:18] back into his body hallelujah
[57:20] and in the thief on the cross turns up
[57:22] and he won sing you all who's this great
[57:24] person and he just says I was just a
[57:26] thief and I was hanging on a cross in
[57:28] agony and I looked at the man next to me
[57:30] and he was more than a man I said Lord
[57:33] remember me when you come into your
[57:34] kingdom
[57:34] hallelujah and he and he said today
[57:37] you'll be with me in paradise and Here I
[57:40] am now where is he
[57:42] hallelujah see someone else came through
[57:44] the door then they send it on high glory
[57:47] to God why cuz they're waiting for the
[57:50] deed to be clean they're waiting for all
[57:52] those things that the devil had against
[57:54] them to be struck off hallelujah and
[57:57] they were struck off because it says in
[57:59] Matthew when Jesus arose as many of the
[58:02] Saints arose with him who were they they
[58:05] were the Saint under the blood of bulls
[58:07] and goats I mean waiting waiting for
[58:09] that perfect blood to come amen and the
[58:12] perfect blood came and they rose with
[58:14] him hallelujah amen isn't as one
[58:19] amen and then so now here he comes
[58:25] there's 120 in an upper room because you
[58:29] don't have to literally die for
[58:30] everything to be struck off against you
[58:32] they meant you can be in this body
[58:35] walking around living your same old kind
[58:38] of life you got oh you know you go to
[58:42] school you go to your job you go to the
[58:45] supermarket you do whatever you do and
[58:47] you can be walking along and there can
[58:51] be nothing held against you the devil
[58:54] has no claim on you hallelujah
[58:57] he has no accusation he can bring forth
[58:59] he's got no evidence
[59:02] amen there's nothing he can say against
[59:04] you you can be walking around in the
[59:06] flesh now I trust you're saying he's
[59:09] describing me Amen because there's got
[59:13] to be a people upon the earth hallelujah
[59:16] with a devil the accuser of the Brethren
[59:19] sees in Revelations 12 was cast down I
[59:21] mean so his accusations he can't accuse
[59:24] you before God day and night anymore now
[59:27] there comes a time in heaven and we
[59:29] won't read it be go read revelations 4
[59:31] and 5 with a saint sir around the throne
[59:34] and John is weeping because he sees a
[59:37] book in the right hand of yo you know of
[59:39] God Almighty and no one's worthy to take
[59:42] the book and loose the seals now there's
[59:44] one person not in that scene the Old
[59:47] Testament Saints are there the angels
[59:49] are there God is there that are redeemed
[59:52] to their because this is thou has
[59:54] redeemed us out of every kindred nation
[59:56] and tongue by thy blood the redeemed are
[59:58] there the lamb is there Satan's not
[1:00:02] there hello lujah so there comes a time
[1:00:04] when Satan used to be able to go up
[1:00:06] before God and accuse you like he did
[1:00:08] with job and job one but then there
[1:00:11] comes a time where he's cast down
[1:00:13] hallelujah and it comes at the time of
[1:00:16] the taking of the book and we're living
[1:00:18] in that time where he's taken the book
[1:00:20] and he's loose
[1:00:22] he's loose the seals and the Bible the
[1:00:24] prophets he became a new book to me and
[1:00:26] he would go and preach things like what
[1:00:29] drew justification really is
[1:00:31] and justification that we believe is not
[1:00:33] like Lusa preached it it's a lot greater
[1:00:36] yes Amen where we're brother Bram said
[1:00:40] it's like someone would come before me
[1:00:41] and say brother Branham I forgive you
[1:00:43] for smoking and drinking and doing all
[1:00:45] those bad things you did the other day
[1:00:47] and he says forgive me but I never did
[1:00:49] it in the first place I never even did
[1:00:52] it he says that's what true
[1:00:53] justification is the just shall live by
[1:00:56] faith I mean you're justified by faith
[1:00:57] right true justification is you never
[1:01:00] did it in the first place hallelujah and
[1:01:04] now you say well but I was there I was
[1:01:08] in sin I was doing all kind of bad
[1:01:10] things but what was really causing you
[1:01:13] to do it I'm gonna ask this question
[1:01:15] here we go into maybe we're gonna push
[1:01:18] out I now hope you ponder on this now
[1:01:21] the sin nature that you're born with is
[1:01:24] that really yours new it's not really
[1:01:30] yours where does it come from it came
[1:01:33] from Satan I mean by hydrating the human
[1:01:36] race and the Garden of Eden Amen that
[1:01:39] brought a fallen a fallen nature into us
[1:01:42] but it doesn't actually belong to you
[1:01:44] it's not the real you Amen you may have
[1:01:48] doesn't matter how many years you live
[1:01:49] upon the earth until finally Jesus finds
[1:01:52] you and you surrender your life you give
[1:01:54] your heart to him amen and you're born
[1:01:56] again you're really you're actually
[1:01:58] birthed you're nature's changed your
[1:02:01] walk in units of life hallelujah amen
[1:02:05] doesn't matter what that span is it can
[1:02:07] be if you're young I've heard
[1:02:08] testimonies of five people at five
[1:02:10] surrender your life to God my brother
[1:02:12] Tim proteases he is five years old and
[1:02:14] he gave us heart to Jesus Christ he says
[1:02:17] he's never taken it back hallelujah his
[1:02:20] um his a sister over in Canada I can't I
[1:02:23] think it's brother Cole Morton's wife I
[1:02:25] might be wrong she was in a meeting five
[1:02:27] years old asleep under a Pew God comes
[1:02:29] down she wakes up she says dad I want to
[1:02:32] give my life to Jesus and she comes and
[1:02:34] surrenders their life to Jesus Christ
[1:02:35] you can never be too young hallelujah
[1:02:39] it's just whenever God calls say Here I
[1:02:40] am Lord amen and so now but you see
[1:02:44] that span of and the attributes of the
[1:02:47] you know the things you did they don't
[1:02:49] actually belong to you the other devil
[1:02:52] likes to hold our Passover us remember
[1:02:54] this remember this remember this
[1:02:56] remember this and you've got to really
[1:02:59] look at him look him in the eye and say
[1:03:02] Satan do you know why that happened is
[1:03:05] because you perverted the human race and
[1:03:10] that fallen nature is yours it's not
[1:03:13] actually mine it doesn't that never blow
[1:03:16] it was never my rightful possession amen
[1:03:20] I trust you could say Amen you say but I
[1:03:22] did a lot of bad things no but that is
[1:03:24] that is sin operating in your life sin
[1:03:28] is unbelief smoking drinking whatever it
[1:03:32] may be that's just the manifestations
[1:03:34] that's the attributes of sin but real
[1:03:36] sin is unbelief in the word Amen but
[1:03:40] there comes a time when faith comes
[1:03:42] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:03:44] Word of God and something and you says I
[1:03:46] believe it and it belongs to me and your
[1:03:49] life is gloriously changed hallelujah
[1:03:52] and then you come to a point where you
[1:03:54] recognize that that that person you look
[1:03:57] in the mirror and say that person is now
[1:03:59] I don't know who the old guy was that
[1:04:02] old man is dead hallelujah and I don't
[1:04:04] want them to come back alive again
[1:04:06] they've got to recognize that you you
[1:04:08] actually have a nature change where
[1:04:11] because faith comes into your heart and
[1:04:13] you're born again you receive the nature
[1:04:16] you should have had in the beginning and
[1:04:19] that's the real you that's who you
[1:04:22] really are
[1:04:23] amen hallelujah you know that's right
[1:04:28] isn't it you know and so that old nature
[1:04:30] isn't even yours to begin with you say
[1:04:33] but I was there I saw it happen
[1:04:35] no that wasn't yours that wasn't you oh
[1:04:39] I can even say it wasn't really you
[1:04:40] doing it amen you got to look at it
[1:04:44] because don't let the devil holds
[1:04:46] because he accuses you do you think you
[1:04:48] can go on a rapture do you think you're
[1:04:50] free from all sin do you think you're
[1:04:52] perfect and virtuous brighter Jesus
[1:04:55] Christ
[1:04:55] you know remember all the things you did
[1:04:58] those hands that you used to praise God
[1:05:00] you should do all kinds of things and
[1:05:02] the mouth that priest him and gives him
[1:05:04] glory settle different kinds of things
[1:05:06] and the mind we thought you know the
[1:05:08] things you think about you know any any
[1:05:11] holds that against us sometimes quite a
[1:05:13] lot actually you get over it you have to
[1:05:16] show Satan I never did it in the first
[1:05:18] place now let's go back to what the
[1:05:21] first place where's the first place
[1:05:23] because it's more than just a nice
[1:05:25] saying now where is the first place now
[1:05:27] Joe came towards the end of his great
[1:05:30] trial and God comes down and speaks to
[1:05:33] Joe and God speaks out a whirlwind to
[1:05:35] Joe and he begins to ask ask him where
[1:05:38] were you when I laid the foundations of
[1:05:41] the world and the morning stars the sons
[1:05:43] of God shouted for joy
[1:05:44] where were you Joe now sometimes people
[1:05:47] read that in the end they think oh God's
[1:05:48] trying to make him real little but he's
[1:05:50] also trying to get to see you're with me
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:54] you were before there was a molecule or
[1:05:56] anything I saw you Joe
[1:05:58] I saw you shouting I saw you rejoicing I
[1:06:02] saw you victorious
[1:06:04] I saw you overcoming this is what God
[1:06:06] then but God's thoughts do not change
[1:06:09] our thoughts change sometimes we can
[1:06:11] lean a little bit this way about a
[1:06:13] subject then you things can come and
[1:06:15] then we lean this way about a subject
[1:06:16] God doesn't do that God thinks a thought
[1:06:19] and it's done hallelujah so when he
[1:06:22] thought of you amen when he thought of
[1:06:26] you he didn't see you being beaten by
[1:06:28] the enemy he didn't see you wandering in
[1:06:30] darkness he didn't see you wondering
[1:06:32] which way is up and down I meant he saw
[1:06:34] he's shouting in his presence redeemed
[1:06:37] overcoming hallelujah washed in his
[1:06:40] blood
[1:06:40] sinless maiden as image hallelujah
[1:06:44] that's what he saw
[1:06:46] because remember God has a family album
[1:06:49] and I'm gonna put some photos up not now
[1:06:53] but maybe watch night cuz I've been
[1:06:56] thinking about those photos quite look
[1:06:57] but God has a family album that's called
[1:07:00] the Lamb's Book of Life and he took a
[1:07:02] photo of you at your best
[1:07:03] and your best wasn't when you thought
[1:07:05] you're in the bloom of youth or whatever
[1:07:07] it goes beyond that
[1:07:09] any any and he has a family album and
[1:07:12] now he's determined that the image he
[1:07:15] has in the family album you grown to
[1:07:18] that image you become that image that's
[1:07:21] what he wants he wants to see because
[1:07:23] this is the negative that is the
[1:07:25] positive hallelujah just like our firm
[1:07:28] was developed all those things and then
[1:07:30] so now he's determined this negative
[1:07:33] will become the positive
[1:07:35] hallelujah aim it so you say what does
[1:07:39] this got to do with Christmas we have a
[1:07:43] gift of eternal life
[1:07:45] God bought us a burying-place
[1:07:49] hallelujah now I think I have another
[1:07:55] that's just about don't worry about
[1:07:58] Joseph your read Hebrews living is by
[1:08:00] faith Joseph when he died bade mention
[1:08:03] of the departing of the children of
[1:08:04] Israel engaged in commandment concerning
[1:08:06] his bones
[1:08:08] now I said those spiritual people when
[1:08:13] we read their Genesis it speaks about
[1:08:16] how Sarah died in Hebron Hebron was a
[1:08:20] City of Refuge Christ is our refuge
[1:08:24] these things that you read about in
[1:08:26] Genesis is more than stories and the
[1:08:28] places they are and things happen in
[1:08:30] those places it's not just I you stay
[1:08:32] there and you know God is showing us a
[1:08:34] pattern he's showing us things in that
[1:08:37] young but I want to somehow emphasize we
[1:08:43] have a burying-place it's more than
[1:08:48] being your life is you are dead in your
[1:08:50] life as head in Christ is the most
[1:08:53] wonderful thing the most wonderful thing
[1:08:57] you can ever state of being you could
[1:08:59] ever be in
[1:09:01] Alleluia it's more than religion it's
[1:09:04] more than just a nice feeling or just a
[1:09:08] doctrine you know when we turn it when
[1:09:10] we speak about predestination that your
[1:09:13] destiny is determined it's predetermined
[1:09:16] by God hallelujah it's more than just a
[1:09:19] it's more than just a nice phrase
[1:09:23] you know or more than just a nice idea
[1:09:25] no God guided our steps God brought us
[1:09:29] down to this moment
[1:09:30] hallelujah he brought us here there's a
[1:09:34] reason he brought us here it wasn't just
[1:09:35] to see if he could do it there was a
[1:09:37] purpose and he wanted to express himself
[1:09:40] to us that we would know him and we
[1:09:45] would know this burying-place
[1:09:47] he say cuz if you miss if you miss this
[1:09:50] place
[1:09:51] you've missed at all it's the same as as
[1:09:56] you're gonna receive the Holy Ghost this
[1:09:59] life has to come into you it's the same
[1:10:01] thing because by one spirit were
[1:10:04] baptized into one body amen and so if we
[1:10:09] miss that we've missed at all but if
[1:10:11] we've got that we've gained at all
[1:10:13] that's how vital it is you know jesus
[1:10:17] said verily verily absolutely absolutely
[1:10:19] you must be born again and we're born
[1:10:22] again by the word by the seed in
[1:10:24] corruptor which is the Word of God now
[1:10:26] we have some musicians to come I don't
[1:10:30] want to be too long tonight but as we go
[1:10:33] as we are in this Christmas season and
[1:10:36] all the tinsel and all the commercial
[1:10:39] and all these different kind of things
[1:10:41] the world has made it
[1:10:42] don't forget Jesus was born a babe was
[1:10:47] born in a manger that God would give us
[1:10:50] a bearing place that he would take his
[1:10:53] blood life like Abraham did and bury her
[1:10:56] in a place that in a certain season
[1:10:59] she'll come forth you know brother
[1:11:02] Graham talked about when the Saints
[1:11:03] arose yeah I think Matthew 28 or 27
[1:11:07] Sarah and Abraham were walking through
[1:11:10] the streets of Jerusalem
[1:11:12] hallelujah they were waiting for it to
[1:11:14] happen and then they arose because
[1:11:17] they're buried in the right kind of
[1:11:18] place and I trust now when when we come
[1:11:23] you say I want to be buried I want to be
[1:11:27] buried in him not Anna creed or
[1:11:30] something man is fashioned but by
[1:11:33] because he is the word of God
[1:11:36] only buried in him and he says Peter
[1:11:40] says very straight he says repent be
[1:11:43] baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:11:45] the remission of sin and you shall
[1:11:47] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if
[1:11:49] you do this you will be placed in the
[1:11:51] burying place I think well if that's the
[1:11:56] way to get in I'm going that way I trust
[1:11:59] you can say I'm so glad I did whenever
[1:12:01] God moved on your heart and Here I am in
[1:12:04] this burying place and I can't get out
[1:12:06] Sarah couldn't get out of that cave she
[1:12:08] was dead I know it sounds very
[1:12:11] ridiculous but she was dead she couldn't
[1:12:12] get out of the cave and if you're really
[1:12:14] dead in Christ you can't get out and you
[1:12:17] don't want to get out
[1:12:18] I'll stay in this place until the body
[1:12:20] change hallelujah
[1:12:24] I'm it I want no this thing I'm so glad
[1:12:28] I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm yours so glad
