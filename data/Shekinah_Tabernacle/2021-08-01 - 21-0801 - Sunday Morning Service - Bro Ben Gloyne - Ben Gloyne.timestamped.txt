[7:56] marching to the tune of onward christian
[7:59] soldiers she is dressed right she's

[59:20] we're going to go to luke chapter 8.
[59:23] it's actually a continuation of the um
[59:26] same
[59:29] same account so mark 4 and 35.
[59:38] hey man says
[59:41] i mean who's happy to be a christian
[59:42] today just everyone's happy to be a
[59:44] christian i'm pretty happy to be a
[59:45] christian amen praise the lord today so
[59:48] verse 35 and the same day when even was
[59:51] come he saith unto them let us pass over
[59:53] onto the other side
[59:55] and when they had sent away the
[59:56] multitude they took him even as he was
[59:59] in the ship and there were also with
[1:00:01] them other little ships and there arose
[1:00:03] a great storm of wind and the waves beat
[1:00:05] into the ship so it was now full
[1:00:08] and he was in the hinder part of the
[1:00:09] ship asleep on a pillow and they awake
[1:00:12] him and say unto master carest thou not
[1:00:15] that we perish so basically don't you
[1:00:17] care lord they're in this situation
[1:00:19] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[1:00:21] the sea and said unto the sea peace be
[1:00:23] still
[1:00:24] and the wind ceased and there was a
[1:00:26] great calm and he said unto them why are
[1:00:29] ye so fearful how is it that ye have no
[1:00:32] faith and they feared exceedingly and
[1:00:34] said to one another what manner of man
[1:00:36] is this that even the wind and the sea
[1:00:40] obey him i'm going to go to luke chapter
[1:00:42] 8 and verse 40.
[1:00:44] this is when he has uh the lord is
[1:00:46] returned he goes over to gatoria uh sets
[1:00:49] legion free
[1:00:50] and then he returns back and this is uh
[1:00:53] this is waiting him on the seashore as
[1:00:55] he comes back
[1:00:57] so luke 8 and 40
[1:01:02] and it came to pass that when jesus was
[1:01:04] returned the people gladly received him
[1:01:06] for they were waiting for him and behold
[1:01:08] there was a man named
[1:01:10] jarius and he was a ruler of the
[1:01:12] synagogue and fell down at jesus feet
[1:01:14] and besought him that he would come into
[1:01:16] his house for he had
[1:01:18] uh for he had only one daughter about 12
[1:01:21] years of age and she lay a dying but as
[1:01:24] he went the people
[1:01:26] thronged him
[1:01:28] i mean this our heads are word of prayer

[1:03:44] name amen
[1:03:46] amen god bless you friends you may have
[1:03:47] your seats this morning i'd like to if i
[1:03:50] could title this i'd like to talk about
[1:03:52] don't miss your blessing during the
[1:03:53] trial
[1:03:55] it's amazing how you know we can be so
[1:03:57] caught up in what our five senses
[1:03:59] declare
[1:04:01] but brother braham tells us in the same
[1:04:03] church age and if you want to read on
[1:04:04] about god's elective love and things
[1:04:06] it's it's it's a very good chapter of
[1:04:08] the church age book to read but he says
[1:04:10] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[1:04:12] no signs of god's disapproval
[1:04:15] neither are bright skies and still water
[1:04:17] signs of his love and approval
[1:04:19] his approval of any of us is only in the
[1:04:21] beloved his love is elective which he
[1:04:24] had for us before the foundation of the
[1:04:26] world does he love us oh yes but how do
[1:04:29] we know we know because he said so
[1:04:32] and the and manifested that he did love
[1:04:35] us for he brought us to himself and gave
[1:04:37] us of his spirit placing us as sons and
[1:04:41] how shall i prove my love to him
[1:04:44] by believing what he said and by
[1:04:46] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:04:49] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[1:04:52] come to pass hallelujah so this is how
[1:04:55] we should be we should always conduct
[1:04:56] ourselves with joy in every trial you
[1:04:59] know it's amazing how we read there were
[1:05:01] you know mark where the disciples are
[1:05:03] traveling on you know to the other side
[1:05:05] and you know they only waited until the
[1:05:07] ship became full they're about to sink
[1:05:09] they're on that crucial moment of they
[1:05:11] were going to drown then they wake the
[1:05:13] master wouldn't it be good to bypass all
[1:05:15] that trouble just wake him i mean
[1:05:16] because he's in our ship today i mean we
[1:05:19] don't need to try and sort out in our
[1:05:20] own strength get worried and stressed
[1:05:22] you think about it the very creator of
[1:05:24] heavens and earth was asleep in the ship
[1:05:26] with them he wasn't just up in glory
[1:05:28] somewhere he was right there he was
[1:05:30] right there and they're in the storm all
[1:05:32] troubled worried about it but the reason
[1:05:33] the storm came is god wanted to show i
[1:05:37] am the resurrection in the life i am the
[1:05:39] creator of all things i'm in charge of
[1:05:40] every situation you know i am here in
[1:05:43] your boat i mean to meet your needs to
[1:05:45] trouble you know calm every storm but to
[1:05:48] show my power in the trial that's what
[1:05:50] he wanted to do to show his power in the
[1:05:52] trial but many times we miss it
[1:05:55] we miss the blessing he wants to give us
[1:05:57] because we're so caught up in me me my
[1:05:58] my oh poor me this has befallen me
[1:06:01] instead of waking the master in the ship
[1:06:03] and letting him come on the scene and
[1:06:05] take over
[1:06:07] that's how we should be we should
[1:06:08] conduct ourselves with joy amidst the
[1:06:10] trials
[1:06:11] hallelujah
[1:06:12] that he has allowed his wisdom to come
[1:06:14] to pass
[1:06:16] now it's amazing how if you just take
[1:06:18] the children of israel when they went
[1:06:20] through the wilderness
[1:06:21] you know it wasn't very far long after
[1:06:24] they had a good old-fashioned
[1:06:25] pentecostal meeting on the red seashore
[1:06:28] they saw their enemies were drowned they
[1:06:30] they realized they were free god had
[1:06:32] brought them out with a mighty hand and
[1:06:34] an eighty or your uh 80 80 old
[1:06:37] ish woman picks up a tambourine miriam
[1:06:40] begins to dance and all those your women
[1:06:42] of israel begin to dance they begin to
[1:06:44] rejoice and moses gets anointed begins
[1:06:46] to sing the song of moses they begin to
[1:06:48] shout i mean because they saw that god
[1:06:50] had defeated their enemy and drowned
[1:06:52] their past was drowned behind them and
[1:06:54] they were going on just like the prophet
[1:06:55] tells us it's like our pastors drowned
[1:06:57] in the blood of jesus christ our old
[1:06:59] nature our sin everything held against
[1:07:01] us is drowned in the blood of jesus
[1:07:03] christ and we can look back and start
[1:07:05] shouting and praising god because we're
[1:07:07] a free people but it didn't take very
[1:07:09] long for them after that incredible
[1:07:11] moment to begin to murmur and complain
[1:07:14] because they were walking according to
[1:07:16] what they saw but we know the wilderness
[1:07:18] journey every part of that journey god
[1:07:21] wanted to prove himself that he was in
[1:07:23] control he was there for their every
[1:07:26] need he was there to supply not even
[1:07:28] just natural blessings and natural you
[1:07:30] know food and things but spiritual
[1:07:32] blessings
[1:07:33] right to reveal himself in those
[1:07:35] hardships but they begin to murmur and
[1:07:37] complain
[1:07:39] you think about it when when moses would
[1:07:41] be recounting of of of the you know that
[1:07:44] wilderness journey in deuteronomy he'd
[1:07:46] say in deuteronomy 1 26
[1:07:48] notwithstanding you would not go up but
[1:07:50] rebelled against the commandment of the
[1:07:52] lord your god
[1:07:53] and you murmured in your tents and
[1:07:54] because because the lord hated us
[1:07:57] i doubt very much they thought he hated
[1:07:59] them without dancing on the red seashore
[1:08:02] that's how god loves us look he brought
[1:08:03] us through these things
[1:08:05] but then they begin to because their
[1:08:06] situation changed
[1:08:08] see we should have the same kind of
[1:08:10] attitude always towards god
[1:08:12] doesn't matter if we're on the hilltop
[1:08:13] and the valley and the fire and the
[1:08:15] flood
[1:08:16] just got the victory we should have the
[1:08:17] same kind of attitude lord you love me
[1:08:20] you called me by your word you called me
[1:08:21] by your grace you brought me to yourself
[1:08:23] so it doesn't matter what's happening in
[1:08:25] life hallelujah anyway
[1:08:28] amen that's how we should be because the
[1:08:30] lord hated us
[1:08:32] he has brought us forth out of the land
[1:08:34] of egypt to deliver us into the hand of
[1:08:35] the amorites to destroy us
[1:08:37] and the whole congregation so this is
[1:08:40] the attitude that that israel had god
[1:08:42] hates us that's why we're in this
[1:08:43] problem god doesn't hate god never hated
[1:08:46] them he says out of egypt i've called my
[1:08:48] son
[1:08:49] amen he even says i have a scripture
[1:08:51] here
[1:08:52] you know that he even picked them up and
[1:08:54] carried them like a father
[1:08:56] from egypt into the promised land
[1:08:58] but they got to a
[1:09:00] kind of a mindset that well god hates us
[1:09:03] this way he's come here to destroy us
[1:09:05] but
[1:09:06] you know
[1:09:07] that's what happens when
[1:09:09] the word is not mixed with faith
[1:09:12] the apostle paul would say in hebrews 4
[1:09:15] he'd say for unto us was the gospel
[1:09:18] preached as well as unto them speaking
[1:09:20] of the children of israel in the
[1:09:21] wilderness but the word preached did not
[1:09:23] profit them not being mixed with faith
[1:09:25] in them that heard it so they heard it
[1:09:27] but it was just information to them it
[1:09:29] didn't anchor down into their hearts by
[1:09:31] faith and so what was happening now is
[1:09:33] that when every time the situation got
[1:09:35] bad they begin to murmur and complain
[1:09:37] but those who really believe the word
[1:09:39] like caleb and joshua you know we're the
[1:09:41] caleb and joshua outfit brother ram says
[1:09:43] we're going to go possess every promise
[1:09:45] right the word was mixed with faith and
[1:09:48] their faith overcame every problem now
[1:09:51] as i said on wednesday i'm just going to
[1:09:52] repeat the same quote brother brown
[1:09:54] speaking perseverance and he's and he's
[1:09:56] and he's relating the story of the woman
[1:09:59] from mexico that had the dead baby but
[1:10:00] she got past all the ushers and the
[1:10:02] people holding and she got to the
[1:10:04] prophet for because she believed if she
[1:10:07] she could just get that man to pray for
[1:10:08] her baby the baby was going to come back
[1:10:10] to life
[1:10:11] he said she was persistent she stayed
[1:10:13] all day the undertaker's calling for a
[1:10:15] baby she stayed all day anyhow the
[1:10:17] usher's trying to keep her out of the
[1:10:18] line and she stayed anyhow turned down
[1:10:21] every way but she stayed why she had
[1:10:24] perseverance why faith caught a hold
[1:10:26] faith said it's so and faith knows no
[1:10:29] difficult faith knows no defeat when
[1:10:31] you've got faith you have perseverance i
[1:10:34] mean because i was anchored into her
[1:10:35] heart my baby's gonna live again she
[1:10:37] wasn't looking at the deadness of the
[1:10:39] baby the coldness no pulse whatever but
[1:10:41] she was determined if i can just get my
[1:10:43] baby to that man of god
[1:10:46] it was gonna come back to life and
[1:10:47] because she was it was anchored in her
[1:10:49] heart it could be so she wasn't
[1:10:51] wondering she knew and if we could just
[1:10:53] let our five senses go and take god only
[1:10:56] at his word faith would anchor into our
[1:10:58] hearts for every situation amen and
[1:11:00] we'll walk with god because faith knows
[1:11:02] no difficult
[1:11:03] that doesn't mean we'll have no
[1:11:05] difficulty but your faith doesn't know
[1:11:07] difficulty
[1:11:08] sure will have difficulty but faith
[1:11:10] doesn't know it
[1:11:12] amen remember faith makes things
[1:11:14] possible
[1:11:16] all things are possible to them that
[1:11:17] believe
[1:11:18] it doesn't mean it'll make it easy but
[1:11:20] it'll make things possible just a
[1:11:22] challenge god see the great challenge
[1:11:24] has always been can man walk with god in
[1:11:26] spite of every situation
[1:11:29] can we trust him through everything
[1:11:31] can we walk with him i i believe we can
[1:11:34] that's why he died on calvary to gather
[1:11:36] people to himself that they can walk
[1:11:38] with god irrespective of their up
[1:11:40] they're down the whole church goes this
[1:11:42] way family's going this way trouble's on
[1:11:44] every hand but they can walk with god
[1:11:47] and that's what we're called to be and
[1:11:49] that's what the lord has made us by his
[1:11:51] grace but it depends what you're leaning
[1:11:53] upon israel was leaning upon their five
[1:11:55] senses and they failed in the wilderness
[1:11:57] but some of them like caleb and joshua
[1:11:59] lent upon faith and they were victorious
[1:12:01] so what are we leaning upon today
[1:12:04] amen
[1:12:06] now the apostle paul would say in second
[1:12:08] corinthians 4 and 16
[1:12:10] for which cause we faint not but though
[1:12:13] our outward man perish yet the inward
[1:12:15] man is renewed day by day for our light
[1:12:17] affliction is but for a moment
[1:12:19] worketh for us
[1:12:21] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[1:12:23] of glory
[1:12:24] it doesn't matter what trouble you're
[1:12:26] going through you're going to put it
[1:12:27] into this category this is working out
[1:12:28] for my benefit it is working a far more
[1:12:31] eternal weight of glory worketh for us
[1:12:33] far more exceeding an eternal weight of
[1:12:36] glory i mean so everything the apostle
[1:12:38] paul went through he classified it as a
[1:12:40] light affliction but for a moment it had
[1:12:42] an expiry date it was going to come to
[1:12:44] an end this was not his eternal state
[1:12:46] that he was going to be in whether he's
[1:12:48] in a prison on a ship when it's in a
[1:12:50] storm he was beaten run out of a city
[1:12:51] whatever was happening he says this is
[1:12:53] just a light affliction but is working
[1:12:56] for me a far more exceeding eternal
[1:12:58] weight of glory
[1:13:00] amen he says while we look not at the
[1:13:02] things which are seen by the things
[1:13:04] which are not seen for the things which
[1:13:06] are seen are temporal
[1:13:08] everyone say temporal
[1:13:10] that means it's got expiry date that
[1:13:12] means it's going to come to an end
[1:13:14] remember every season is not permanent
[1:13:17] winter is not permanent hallelujah
[1:13:19] spring is not permanent summer's not you
[1:13:21] know autumn that's all there's always a
[1:13:23] change and brother ram says we go
[1:13:24] through night seasons we go into day
[1:13:26] seasons but we don't stay in a night
[1:13:28] season a night season's where everything
[1:13:29] seems like we're just rocky and
[1:13:31] everything's going there's trouble and
[1:13:32] you know about a day season everything's
[1:13:34] going fine you know we don't stay in
[1:13:36] those states
[1:13:37] there's always a change so there will be
[1:13:39] you're not stuck
[1:13:41] right we're not called to be stuck the
[1:13:42] devil thinks you're stuck but yeah even
[1:13:44] tries to tell you you're stuck in
[1:13:45] whatever state if you're facing some big
[1:13:48] big giant but no no you're not stuck the
[1:13:50] lord wants to take you through
[1:13:53] hallelujah
[1:13:55] amen any and then he would say in in the
[1:13:58] next chapter after he has outlined how
[1:14:00] we have a theophany body waiting for us
[1:14:02] in the heavens already he says for we
[1:14:04] walk by faith and not by sight he was a
[1:14:07] man and i'm going to go into him later
[1:14:08] he was a man who went through incredible
[1:14:09] things
[1:14:10] he was beaten he was shipwrecked he got
[1:14:13] bitten by a poisonous snake amen he was
[1:14:16] rejected he was made fun of he was run
[1:14:18] out of the city the same people who
[1:14:20] thought he was a god the next minute
[1:14:22] stoned him and threw his body outside
[1:14:24] the city amen he had a lot of trouble in
[1:14:26] his life but he says none of these
[1:14:27] things move me hallelujah he wasn't
[1:14:29] caught up in the current moment he was
[1:14:31] in i mean but he he knew he had a
[1:14:33] theophany body waiting for him he knew
[1:14:35] if the last breath here was the first
[1:14:37] breath there hallelujah he wasn't moved
[1:14:40] by any of these troubles though he had a
[1:14:42] lot of trouble
[1:14:44] hallelujah why because he walked by
[1:14:46] faith and not by sight
[1:14:49] hallelujah
[1:14:50] he would say in hebrews chapter 12
[1:14:52] wherefore seeing we also can pass by
[1:14:55] about was so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:14:57] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:15:00] sin which just so easily beset us and
[1:15:02] let us run with patience the race that
[1:15:04] has set before us i think that's quite
[1:15:05] applicable since we're in olympic kind
[1:15:07] of season you know but look where we can
[1:15:10] pass about why is so great a cloud of
[1:15:12] witnesses i tell you if paul can run and
[1:15:14] overcome we can if arenas could run and
[1:15:17] overcome we can if timothy could run and
[1:15:19] overcome we can amen those in the dark
[1:15:22] ages are burnt to the stake sawn asunder
[1:15:24] whatever happened if they could overcome
[1:15:26] if they could look that thing in the
[1:15:28] faith and say i cannot recant i could
[1:15:30] not be moved here i stand i cannot
[1:15:32] change my mind my mind's been made up
[1:15:34] i've met the lord i'm going into glory
[1:15:36] doesn't matter what you do to this body
[1:15:38] i'm going to walk with god if they can
[1:15:40] overcome amen we can make it too
[1:15:42] hallelujah if the prophet could stand in
[1:15:44] an age of trouble and and unbelief and
[1:15:46] religion amen preach a pure word of god
[1:15:49] and bring a real baptism of the holy
[1:15:50] ghost of the church we can stand and
[1:15:52] overcome too
[1:15:54] hallelujah if noah could stand in his
[1:15:55] day we can stand
[1:15:57] hallelujah
[1:15:59] amen that's a great cloud of witnesses
[1:16:03] hallelujah and they're cheering us on
[1:16:05] you know we're the final runner we're
[1:16:06] the final voice to the final age i mean
[1:16:09] there's no other age after this the next
[1:16:11] stage is a millennium but before that
[1:16:12] there's a rapture of a church hallelujah
[1:16:14] and we're here to run this last lap i
[1:16:17] mean so we should keep our eyes on the
[1:16:18] finish line amen it's too late to quit
[1:16:21] it's too late just to you know what i
[1:16:23] think the biggest nonsense ever is
[1:16:26] people who hang around the ark
[1:16:28] thinking the world's got something for
[1:16:29] me there were people as it was in the
[1:16:32] days of noah there were people hanging
[1:16:33] around the ark
[1:16:35] oh but maybe noah's right but these guys
[1:16:36] my i just want to see what's out there
[1:16:38] and you know it's like dark dingy arc i
[1:16:40] don't really want to go in there and you
[1:16:42] know my friends are out there you know
[1:16:44] people say well everyone else is doing
[1:16:45] it where everyone else
[1:16:46] drowned so i don't want to be what
[1:16:48] everyone else is doing i hope you know i
[1:16:50] have that stings i hope it stings
[1:16:52] you know but people were hanging around
[1:16:53] the ark but then the door closed
[1:16:56] that's okay no we'll open it well god
[1:16:57] closed it no it didn't close it so i
[1:17:00] wouldn't hang around and say well i'll
[1:17:02] see what the world has for me and this
[1:17:03] no i just get in
[1:17:05] get into christ as fast as you can and
[1:17:07] stay in don't go out
[1:17:10] hallelujah
[1:17:12] amen that's what i do
[1:17:14] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:17:16] finisher of our faith
[1:17:18] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:17:19] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:17:22] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:17:24] throne of god
[1:17:25] that's what we should do we're called to
[1:17:27] run
[1:17:28] hallelujah you know it's amazing the
[1:17:31] apostle paul would say in philippians 3
[1:17:33] he says but what great things were
[1:17:35] gained to me those i counted lost for
[1:17:37] christ yeah doubtless i accounted all
[1:17:39] things but lost for the excellency of
[1:17:42] the knowledge of christ jesus my lord
[1:17:44] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:17:46] things and to count them but dung that i
[1:17:49] may win christ
[1:17:50] so the things that he had to let go of
[1:17:52] he put them into one category dung
[1:17:56] that's what he you know there wasn't the
[1:17:57] oh i love these things but these things
[1:17:59] are horrible no all the same category
[1:18:02] he counted them but dung
[1:18:04] hallelujah
[1:18:06] where am i here we are
[1:18:08] yes and and be found in him not having
[1:18:11] mine own righteousness which is of the
[1:18:13] law but that which is through the faith
[1:18:16] of christ the righteousness which is of
[1:18:18] god of god by faith that i may know him
[1:18:21] and the and the power of his
[1:18:23] resurrection now everyone loves that hey
[1:18:26] we're the anointed bride in the last
[1:18:28] days
[1:18:29] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:18:30] all he poured into christ he's poured
[1:18:32] into the church i mean we've got
[1:18:33] overcoming power i mean we've got the
[1:18:35] power spoken word of creation i mean the
[1:18:38] god that made heavens and earth dwells
[1:18:39] in us
[1:18:40] hallelujah and though this mortal body
[1:18:42] be you know expire we have one eternal
[1:18:45] in the heavens waiting for us already
[1:18:46] amen
[1:18:47] yeah a believer can't die no more than
[1:18:49] god can die
[1:18:51] we love that don't we that's what we
[1:18:52] sign up for
[1:18:54] isn't it but that's not all of it that's
[1:18:56] not the whole package
[1:18:58] he says and the fellowship of his
[1:19:00] sufferings
[1:19:01] being made conformable unto his death if
[1:19:04] by any means i might obtain unto the
[1:19:06] resurrection of the dead now
[1:19:09] so we love the power of his resurrection
[1:19:11] and we also hallelujah but we sign up
[1:19:13] for the fellowship of his sufferings as
[1:19:15] well
[1:19:16] now this word fellowship it means a
[1:19:18] partnership
[1:19:20] it means a participation is in the greek
[1:19:23] so to fellowship
[1:19:24] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:19:26] isn't just knowing about it as an idea
[1:19:29] it's experiencing it you participate
[1:19:33] right it's it's it's to have a communion
[1:19:36] so to become one with
[1:19:38] amen is to have a fellowship
[1:19:41] now sufferings
[1:19:42] of course it means something that is
[1:19:44] undergone that is a hardship or a pain
[1:19:47] it can be an emotion or an influence an
[1:19:49] affliction it's a suffering so he says
[1:19:51] that will numb in the power of his
[1:19:52] resurrection but also the fellowship or
[1:19:55] the partnership or the participation or
[1:19:57] the communion of his sufferings
[1:20:00] so if jesus suffered
[1:20:02] then the church the bride suffers
[1:20:04] this is all part of it it's part and
[1:20:06] parcel we love the we love the baptism
[1:20:08] of the holy ghost shouting praising god
[1:20:10] hallelujah god takes over our lives and
[1:20:12] makes us new creatures but then there is
[1:20:14] a fellowship of his sufferings
[1:20:16] and this is the thing that stumbles
[1:20:19] people
[1:20:20] how can a god who is full of love and
[1:20:22] mercy and grace
[1:20:24] who is so powerful
[1:20:26] that he could just like this make the
[1:20:28] devil just be completely annihilated all
[1:20:30] his works
[1:20:31] why does he allow his believing children
[1:20:34] that he is loved with an unfailing love
[1:20:37] go through hardship
[1:20:39] but he does
[1:20:41] you know it's amazing the apostle paul
[1:20:43] would um you know he'd go into a city
[1:20:45] for example he says in acts 14. this is
[1:20:48] this is part of the new testament church
[1:20:49] imagine we're we're we're we're new
[1:20:51] believers
[1:20:53] and he says and when they had preached
[1:20:55] the gospel to that city and taught many
[1:20:57] they returned again to lystra and to
[1:20:59] iconium and antioch
[1:21:01] confirming the souls of the disciples
[1:21:04] and exhorting them to continue in the
[1:21:06] faith and that we must through much
[1:21:08] tribulation enter into the kingdom of
[1:21:10] god so he's saying
[1:21:12] this faith works there's overcoming
[1:21:14] power in this faith amen but then we but
[1:21:17] through great trib through much
[1:21:18] tribulation
[1:21:19] enter into the kingdom of god so he says
[1:21:21] this is all part of it there's going to
[1:21:22] be tribulation you're going to have
[1:21:24] trouble and maybe sometimes that trouble
[1:21:27] will be maybe without measure you just
[1:21:28] can't seem to just you know keep it all
[1:21:30] together and you seem so overwhelmed by
[1:21:32] it but through this you're going to
[1:21:33] enter into the kingdom of god
[1:21:36] hallelujah you know it's the same today
[1:21:39] i think some some christians today have
[1:21:41] the impression
[1:21:43] that the only kind of atmosphere that
[1:21:45] god works in
[1:21:46] is when it's all calm
[1:21:48] and we have our favorite worship
[1:21:49] instrumental music playing in the
[1:21:51] background and we're sitting on our
[1:21:52] favorite chair with our favorite cup of
[1:21:54] coffee in our bible in the other and
[1:21:56] that's how now the atmosphere is right
[1:21:58] now god can work
[1:22:00] that's an instagram kind of a christian
[1:22:03] that's not bible christianity
[1:22:06] that's not bible christianity that's but
[1:22:08] but and so people have this idea now now
[1:22:10] i'm calm they that wait upon the lord
[1:22:13] and they just weigh
[1:22:14] and the atmosphere's the lighting
[1:22:16] everything's just nice and now god can
[1:22:17] minister to me
[1:22:19] no
[1:22:20] not always but that's what people think
[1:22:22] because they think that you know you're
[1:22:23] gonna be calm no it's in great trial
[1:22:27] and struggle
[1:22:28] and where god
[1:22:29] it's like you're on a knife edge you're
[1:22:31] gonna lose it all or gain it all those
[1:22:33] kind of situations that's when god comes
[1:22:35] on the scene
[1:22:36] but if we think he's just works in a
[1:22:38] certain way we miss how he really works
[1:22:40] and we misunderstand what we're going
[1:22:42] through and we think how can god ever
[1:22:44] meet me in this mess well actually god
[1:22:46] meets people in mess
[1:22:48] that's where he meets
[1:22:50] so and then because of this and then
[1:22:54] um
[1:22:55] and and and it can only be that certain
[1:22:57] way and then if it's not then
[1:22:58] something's wrong and it just can't be
[1:23:00] god and if we have that attitude we can
[1:23:02] miss our moment because we begin to
[1:23:05] question why which can lead us to
[1:23:07] blaming god for our trouble
[1:23:10] that's because what does the devil try
[1:23:11] and do he tries to whisper in your ear
[1:23:14] that you get on his team and blame god
[1:23:16] remember he's the accuser of the
[1:23:17] brethren
[1:23:18] he thinks that god is not big enough he
[1:23:20] can't save he can't redeem he can't
[1:23:22] gather a people he can't make a people
[1:23:24] love him and what does he do tries to
[1:23:25] whisper in urea
[1:23:27] to try and join him
[1:23:29] in agreement with the devil
[1:23:31] oh god really loves you why are you
[1:23:32] going through this why is this happening
[1:23:34] why is this person
[1:23:36] oh you know it's and it's all god's
[1:23:38] fault because we're never wrong
[1:23:40] we're just a victim of circumstance
[1:23:42] are we
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:46] god is always right
[1:23:47] god is always correct god is never wrong
[1:23:50] he's never partially wrong he's always
[1:23:52] right he's not even partially right he's
[1:23:54] completely right all the time i mean so
[1:23:57] we must never get angry or upset at god
[1:24:00] amen you know the children of israel god
[1:24:02] brought us out here this is god's fault
[1:24:05] this is why i'm hungry that's why this
[1:24:06] is why we're thirsty this is why we're
[1:24:07] in this desert it's god's fault
[1:24:10] it's his it's his fault no it's not
[1:24:12] the word wasn't mixed with faith
[1:24:17] you see
[1:24:18] driest
[1:24:20] driest's
[1:24:21] life here is a perfect example
[1:24:24] of god stepping into trouble
[1:24:26] to reveal himself
[1:24:28] brother bram says in raising driest's
[1:24:30] daughter remember
[1:24:32] jesus had gone to the other side to get
[1:24:34] one soul he went through a big storm
[1:24:38] to get the maniac in the tombs but now
[1:24:40] we had to come back again
[1:24:42] and dreist was waiting for jesus to
[1:24:44] return because he was a secret believer
[1:24:46] he knew that he knew that jesus could
[1:24:48] heal his daughter
[1:24:49] but jesus had gone away somewhere
[1:24:52] but he was coming back
[1:24:54] you could imagine the feeling when you
[1:24:56] see maybe just to dramatize it a bit
[1:24:58] maybe it's before dawn
[1:25:00] driest is there waiting at the dock
[1:25:02] and he begins to see the disciples ship
[1:25:04] that he saw sailing that way
[1:25:06] returning
[1:25:07] imagine the you know he has this burden
[1:25:09] of his daughter who's slowly getting
[1:25:10] worse and worse and worse and all the
[1:25:12] doctors can't help all the prayers he's
[1:25:14] lifted to god haven't haven't haven't
[1:25:16] haven't helped well the answer is coming
[1:25:18] but the way he thinks would help you
[1:25:20] know his doc you know his daughter's
[1:25:21] getting worse but he sees the
[1:25:22] discipleship coming to the dock
[1:25:26] imagine now the joy that i've been
[1:25:28] raising in his heart the answer's on its
[1:25:30] way
[1:25:31] hallelujah the answer's on its way
[1:25:35] amen then he begin to see i'll drive
[1:25:37] thought if i could only see him now i
[1:25:40] will express oh what will i do i'll lose
[1:25:42] my jobs he had to wrestle it out he had
[1:25:45] to be willing to forsake all and lose
[1:25:47] his church losers standing in the
[1:25:49] community to actually invite jesus into
[1:25:51] his house and that's how we should be as
[1:25:53] well don't worry about your friends god
[1:25:55] will take care of your friends don't
[1:25:57] worry about your standing who cares
[1:25:59] about it
[1:26:00] i'd rather just walk with god
[1:26:03] now
[1:26:04] and then
[1:26:06] he says he says what will i do maybe i
[1:26:08] better not go he walked in and looked at
[1:26:10] the little girl she's almost gone
[1:26:12] what had happened
[1:26:14] right down in his heart so he's looking
[1:26:16] at his seat we think that god moves when
[1:26:17] there's no trouble
[1:26:19] sometimes
[1:26:20] right she's almost gone what had
[1:26:23] happened right down in his heart god
[1:26:25] began to work jesus a driest
[1:26:28] this is your time
[1:26:31] you know god gets christ's division and
[1:26:34] god works on both ends of the line see
[1:26:36] so god is saying so dry god is bringing
[1:26:39] this situation into his life because
[1:26:41] this was jarius's time
[1:26:44] if he if he began to question god and
[1:26:47] get mad at him he would have missed his
[1:26:48] moment
[1:26:49] and his daughter would have died and
[1:26:51] stayed dead
[1:26:53] but because god was working in this
[1:26:55] great time of trouble
[1:26:57] he says this is your time many times you
[1:26:59] know
[1:27:00] we can't miss our blessing in the trial
[1:27:04] he says dries this is your time
[1:27:07] this time was the greatest crisis that
[1:27:09] ever struck his house
[1:27:11] but it but
[1:27:12] but it had struck
[1:27:14] and it caused a secret believer to come
[1:27:16] and openly invite the lord jesus to his
[1:27:18] house
[1:27:18] and he says this isn't this isn't the
[1:27:20] same other than raising driest his
[1:27:22] daughter against you so dryas got the
[1:27:24] feeling pretty good after he met jesus
[1:27:26] went walking along he said now i've got
[1:27:28] a real hope
[1:27:30] my girl's going to be all right
[1:27:32] have you ever been in this kind of
[1:27:33] situation you know you have the answer
[1:27:35] with you jesus in the ship
[1:27:37] right and you're on your way to see him
[1:27:39] fulfill his word
[1:27:40] but then but then
[1:27:42] greater trouble strikes
[1:27:44] he says he says i've got a real hope now
[1:27:46] my girl's going to be all right yep
[1:27:49] he will go in there and he'll minister
[1:27:50] some way he will lay his hands on her
[1:27:53] and the first thing you know that girl
[1:27:55] will start getting better she'll get all
[1:27:57] right yes sir what did he have a
[1:27:59] preconceived idea this is what jesus is
[1:28:01] going to do
[1:28:02] how many times do we pray for things we
[1:28:04] have in our mind this is how god's going
[1:28:06] to do it this is how god's going to save
[1:28:07] this person's how god's going to bring
[1:28:09] this person in this is how i'm going to
[1:28:10] get healed this is how i'm going to you
[1:28:12] know and we have this preconceived idea
[1:28:15] god goes beyond preconceived idea you
[1:28:17] know we think it's going to be a certain
[1:28:19] you know we're like god's project
[1:28:20] manager
[1:28:22] and today you're going to do this and
[1:28:23] then you're going to do this and this
[1:28:24] person's going to say this and this is
[1:28:26] going to no no god's his own project
[1:28:27] manager he will bring to pass his word
[1:28:30] how he sees it should come to pass
[1:28:32] right and we have to trust him however
[1:28:34] it's happening hallelujah
[1:28:37] amen so so he thinks you know i've got
[1:28:39] real hope now jesus is with me this is
[1:28:42] how it's going to happen he's going to
[1:28:43] lay his hands on her and she's going to
[1:28:44] start getting better and he and he make
[1:28:47] himself believe that
[1:28:49] pushing right along with the crowd
[1:28:50] feeling pretty good what was happening
[1:28:52] his mental faith was being worked up
[1:28:54] who's this coming here comes a man
[1:28:57] usually a message of sorrow they had
[1:28:59] ashes on their heads imagine drastic you
[1:29:01] know jesus is with them it's going to be
[1:29:03] okay his house is just around the corner
[1:29:05] down that alley but then a man comes
[1:29:07] running covered in ashes crying broken
[1:29:09] upset
[1:29:10] and he comes into this
[1:29:13] and they come running here he had i
[1:29:14] wonder what's happened up the street
[1:29:16] wonder what's taking place and here
[1:29:18] comes this runner
[1:29:19] said drast do you know me
[1:29:21] this is the man with the ashes on his
[1:29:23] head all upset
[1:29:24] and dry says yes
[1:29:26] trouble not the master anymore dries and
[1:29:28] dry says oh why oh why what's happened
[1:29:31] your daughter's already dead don't
[1:29:32] trouble him
[1:29:33] oh i can see him just go back down just
[1:29:37] start at just as he starts to sink like
[1:29:39] peter did
[1:29:40] he turns his eyes
[1:29:42] now this is the secret imagine if he
[1:29:44] just
[1:29:45] jesus you came too late
[1:29:47] you should have been here yesterday
[1:29:49] if you were here yesterday as i thought
[1:29:51] you would have been here she wouldn't
[1:29:52] have died
[1:29:53] and got angry with god no no god's gonna
[1:29:56] display his power in the trial he wasn't
[1:29:58] willing to let his own emotion and how
[1:30:01] he felt what god should do
[1:30:03] override what god was gonna do if he did
[1:30:06] that he would have missed the blessing
[1:30:08] now and then so he turns
[1:30:12] he turns his eyes to see what jesus is
[1:30:15] going to say about it
[1:30:16] why don't you see what he says about it
[1:30:19] if you say well the world turns me down
[1:30:22] see what he says about it doctor says
[1:30:24] i'm going to die see what he says about
[1:30:26] it see what he says about it so jarius
[1:30:29] turned his little head to see what jesus
[1:30:31] said about it i can see those lovely
[1:30:33] eyes look over to him said fear not only
[1:30:36] believe
[1:30:37] thou shall see the glory of god glory
[1:30:41] that was the word that's what we should
[1:30:43] do
[1:30:44] trouble comes in
[1:30:46] you know
[1:30:47] a curveball comes something you don't
[1:30:48] even expect you're blindsided we say see
[1:30:50] what jesus says about it don't don't
[1:30:53] don't respond according to your
[1:30:54] carnality you should respond what jesus
[1:30:57] what do you say about this situation
[1:30:58] though i know how shall be saved amen
[1:31:01] only believe all things are possible
[1:31:03] holy this is just a light affliction
[1:31:05] working for your good hallelujah all
[1:31:07] things work together for them that love
[1:31:08] god and called according to his purpose
[1:31:10] amen
[1:31:11] hallelujah remember our lord jesus has
[1:31:13] the final say
[1:31:15] the devil don't have the final say we
[1:31:16] don't have the final say he has the
[1:31:18] final say
[1:31:19] hallelujah now if we could just just
[1:31:21] just reverse this a bit back to the
[1:31:23] disciples in the boat during the storm
[1:31:25] you know that storm was whipped up
[1:31:28] it caused the disciples to wake jesus
[1:31:32] in order for the lord to show his power
[1:31:34] and authority and this is what trials
[1:31:36] are made to do
[1:31:37] trials aren't made to wear us down to
[1:31:39] powder
[1:31:40] trials are engineered that god will
[1:31:43] reveal his power
[1:31:45] during the trial
[1:31:47] hallelujah so trials are good
[1:31:50] amen
[1:31:52] i speak on behalf of everyone here amen
[1:31:56] many people unfortunately miss the
[1:31:57] blessing during the trial because their
[1:31:59] eyes are fixed on the current situation
[1:32:02] as i said before the lord said he said
[1:32:04] the lord your god which goeth before you
[1:32:06] this is speaking of moses addressing the
[1:32:08] children of israel before they cross the
[1:32:10] jordan this is deuteronomy 1 again the
[1:32:12] lord your god which god before you he
[1:32:14] shall fight for you according to all
[1:32:16] that he did for you in egypt before your
[1:32:17] eyes and in the wilderness where thou
[1:32:20] has seen how that the law thy god bear
[1:32:22] thee as a man doth bear his son
[1:32:25] in all the way that they went until he
[1:32:27] came into this place so
[1:32:29] this is what god was saying through
[1:32:31] moses i have actually carried you as a
[1:32:33] son as a man carries his son i have
[1:32:35] borne thee from egypt into this place
[1:32:37] but
[1:32:38] the people who just walking by the five
[1:32:40] senses they said what do you mean we've
[1:32:42] been hungry we've been thirsty we've had
[1:32:45] trouble you know we we
[1:32:47] we've drank bitter water there though
[1:32:49] you know yo mara there we've had all
[1:32:51] this trouble what do you mean you've
[1:32:52] bore us he bore them
[1:32:56] he bore them why because in every step
[1:32:57] of the journey god wanted to reveal his
[1:32:59] power
[1:33:02] i say lord jesus may may may we
[1:33:05] in every trial
[1:33:06] say thank you jesus you want to show
[1:33:08] yourself in this trial to me just like i
[1:33:11] i well i think i haven't said it
[1:33:12] recently but brother tim dodd said when
[1:33:14] his first wife passed away he said lord
[1:33:16] help me to look around as i walk through
[1:33:18] this trial because i may never walk
[1:33:20] through this trial again teach me what
[1:33:22] you want to teach me during this trial
[1:33:24] because remember some trials we go again
[1:33:27] and again and again because until
[1:33:28] eventually we see god's hand in it but
[1:33:30] some trials are very unique there may be
[1:33:32] one kind of a situation in life
[1:33:34] i said lord teach me in that situation
[1:33:37] teach me something because i may never
[1:33:38] walk through it again
[1:33:41] life is meant to be a guided tour
[1:33:44] the lord is the guide and we're on a
[1:33:45] tour we came from god go back to god
[1:33:48] that's a tour
[1:33:49] right this is not our fixed abode but if
[1:33:51] it's going to be a guided tour we need
[1:33:53] to listen to the guide which is the word
[1:33:55] we need to pay real good attention
[1:33:57] especially when it gets trouble it gets
[1:33:59] dark it gets gloomy you don't know which
[1:34:01] way to go no the guide will show you
[1:34:03] through but if you get you know but
[1:34:05] you've got to listen to him if you don't
[1:34:06] listen to him you'll get lost
[1:34:09] but you always you know if you call out
[1:34:10] he'll he'll find you wherever you are
[1:34:13] hallelujah amen
[1:34:15] amen brother brown would speak about
[1:34:17] this and i know
[1:34:18] speaking about the three hebrew children
[1:34:20] into the fiery furnace
[1:34:22] one day down in a great nation under a
[1:34:24] great bondage they come hebrew children
[1:34:26] we know as shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:34:28] and it came to a place where they had to
[1:34:31] make a decision that something had to be
[1:34:33] done they had their faith was put to a
[1:34:35] test and when your faith is put to a
[1:34:38] test then don't fail
[1:34:40] stay right with what you believe
[1:34:42] what do we believe god's in control god
[1:34:45] will see us through
[1:34:46] i don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:34:47] god's going to do it that is the end of
[1:34:49] it
[1:34:50] hallelujah
[1:34:52] amen and when your faith is put to a
[1:34:54] test i'll just repeat this again then
[1:34:55] don't fail stay right with what you
[1:34:56] believe and when their faith was put to
[1:34:58] a test and they went to a crucial hour
[1:35:01] not only did they um not only do they go
[1:35:04] to an ash heap but they went into a
[1:35:06] fiery furnace but satan could not
[1:35:08] destroy them for god's purpose wasn't
[1:35:10] yet fulfilled they could go in there
[1:35:12] with this hope i know my redeemer liveth
[1:35:15] they could go in there with this hope
[1:35:17] here we are assured that god is able to
[1:35:19] deliver us from this fiery furnace but
[1:35:22] nevertheless we'll not bow down to the
[1:35:24] image satan could not could not take
[1:35:26] them he could not drown noah in the
[1:35:28] flood until the purpose of god had been
[1:35:30] finished he could not burn up the hebrew
[1:35:32] children until the purpose of god had
[1:35:34] been finished he could not kill job with
[1:35:36] boils and troubles until the purpose of
[1:35:38] god
[1:35:39] had been finished neither could the
[1:35:41] lions eat daniel until god's purpose had
[1:35:43] been finished neither could death and
[1:35:45] old age take abraham until the purpose
[1:35:47] of god had been finished and neither can
[1:35:49] it take you or can it take me until the
[1:35:52] purpose of god of our life is finished
[1:35:54] so we gather from their consolation
[1:35:56] and why does god let trouble come god
[1:35:59] harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth
[1:36:01] and makes it obey him and those troubles
[1:36:04] bring us into a closer fellowship with
[1:36:06] god
[1:36:07] hallelujah why we got trouble god wants
[1:36:09] to bring us close to himself
[1:36:11] hallelujah but if we if we don't see
[1:36:13] god's hand in the trouble
[1:36:15] well what are we going to do we're going
[1:36:16] to miss the blessing we're going to miss
[1:36:18] what god wants to reveal to us of
[1:36:19] himself
[1:36:20] amen i like that god harnesses trouble
[1:36:23] lord you've harnessed this trouble
[1:36:24] you've harnessed this sickness you've
[1:36:26] harnessed this trouble in my family
[1:36:27] whatever is your harnessing this trouble
[1:36:29] to bring me into a closer fellowship
[1:36:30] with you
[1:36:32] hallelujah
[1:36:34] you know we think often that if the
[1:36:36] grace of god has come upon our lives
[1:36:38] which it has that god will keep us from
[1:36:39] trouble
[1:36:40] do we not think that so yeah we you know
[1:36:42] because
[1:36:43] we we mistaken and i'll get to it later
[1:36:45] that we think god's love is like a
[1:36:46] parental care
[1:36:48] where god will try and keep us from all
[1:36:50] harm like we would our children
[1:36:52] but you know brother makes this
[1:36:53] statement
[1:36:54] he says now remember
[1:36:56] when god has counted you worthy
[1:36:59] god has counted you worthy when you have
[1:37:01] a test
[1:37:03] now don't fail this
[1:37:05] to get this now when the prophet says
[1:37:06] sound like that i listen it's like i had
[1:37:08] a lecturer who didn't give out any um um
[1:37:12] he didn't give out many handouts but he
[1:37:13] says now when i repeat something you
[1:37:14] should write that down
[1:37:16] he said that and he and he repeated
[1:37:17] quite a few things so we wrote them down
[1:37:19] so when the prophet says now i don't
[1:37:20] fail to get this i'm like lord i don't
[1:37:22] want to fail to get this
[1:37:25] when you have a trial or a test
[1:37:27] it shows the grace of god has found you
[1:37:30] found you favor with god and god
[1:37:32] believes you'll stand the test
[1:37:34] hallelujah so you ever if you're going
[1:37:36] through a test what's happened that's an
[1:37:37] evidence that the grace of god has found
[1:37:39] you and found you worthy amen found you
[1:37:41] able to overcome
[1:37:43] hallelujah
[1:37:45] amen
[1:37:46] oh life is tough things have gone
[1:37:48] sideways the grace of god has found me
[1:37:50] this is why this is going on hallelujah
[1:37:53] amen i love that
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:56] you found how do you know you found
[1:37:58] favor with god you're going through a
[1:37:59] test
[1:38:01] hallelujah you remember he did the same
[1:38:04] thing by job

[1:38:08] well actually god had a testimony
[1:38:10] meeting with satan about job yeah god

[1:38:34] servant job he's a perfect man he was
[1:38:36] just under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:38:38] but god would say he's perfect
[1:38:40] hallelujah he's a perfect man there's
[1:38:42] none like him in all the earth now if
[1:38:44] god can look at his servant under the

[1:38:47] perfect man how much more the people

[1:39:20] man my he's my pride and joy

[1:39:35] he says let me have him once said i'll
[1:39:38] make him curse you to your very face
[1:39:40] i'll make him curse you god said he's in
[1:39:42] your hands but don't you take his life
[1:39:44] see god had confidence in job amen and
[1:39:47] when it looks like everything has gone
[1:39:49] wrong god's giving you a trial he's got
[1:39:51] confidence in you

[1:40:14] god didn't give him some support system

[1:41:02] raise your hands and just get lost and
[1:41:04] worship and praise god but that's not
[1:41:06] the only response god's looking for

[1:41:10] life what are you going to say to the
[1:41:11] situation how are you going to respond

[1:41:20] wife sister karen's had brain bleeds
[1:41:21] again and you know in hospital but he
[1:41:23] when he put through a prayer request he
[1:41:26] said help me to conduct so pray for his
[1:41:28] wife of course but help me to conduct
[1:41:30] myself as a son of god during this trial
[1:41:33] i thought that's a blessed man they even
[1:41:35] have that kind of a mindset lord help i
[1:41:37] need prayer that i'll conduct myself
[1:41:38] because sure he will be you know as a

[1:41:44] worried sure he's upset sure he's
[1:41:46] concerned but he says lord may those
[1:41:48] things not override me but i conduct
[1:41:50] myself as a son of god how do we conduct
[1:41:52] ourselves the sons of god believe the
[1:41:54] word of god take every need to god in
[1:41:56] prayer cast out cares upon him because

[1:42:08] and this is for my good i found favor
[1:42:10] with god and that's why i'm going
[1:42:11] through this test because he knows i'm
[1:42:13] gonna make it i'm gonna overcome i'm
[1:42:15] gonna walk through this and walk out the
[1:42:17] other side packing the victory
[1:42:19] hallelujah
[1:42:20] he's made us to do it
[1:42:22] this is not on your shoulders it's on
[1:42:24] god's shoulders but he has confidence in
[1:42:26] you what are you gonna say in the trial
[1:42:30] lord i he's able uh he's able i know
[1:42:33] he's able i know my lord is able to
[1:42:36] carry me through
[1:42:38] amen
[1:42:39] hallelujah god is giving you a test see
[1:42:42] what you'll do about it amen no wonder
[1:42:44] peter said these fiery trials why count
[1:42:47] it a joy it's more precious to you than
[1:42:49] gold
[1:42:51] and many times we him and her oh well
[1:42:54] it's just well it's just something god
[1:42:56] give you to overcome he knows you'll do
[1:42:59] it
[1:42:59] he's put his trust in you see it's one
[1:43:02] thing for man to put trust in god
[1:43:05] there's nothing for god to put trust in
[1:43:07] man
[1:43:08] that's why he gave you his holy spirit
[1:43:10] because he has confidence in you that
[1:43:12] you'll overcome
[1:43:13] he has faith and confidence in you
[1:43:16] amen
[1:43:19] hallelujah this is from the smooth
[1:43:20] church again he says now the lord god
[1:43:22] almighty says i know
[1:43:25] there he is walking in the midst of his
[1:43:26] people there he is the chief shepherd of
[1:43:28] the flock but does he hold back the
[1:43:31] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[1:43:34] no he does not he simply says i know
[1:43:37] your tribulation i am not at all
[1:43:39] unmindful of your suffering remember the
[1:43:41] disciples response before they woke
[1:43:43] jesus don't you care that we perish
[1:43:46] are you not aware of our situation that
[1:43:48] we're in and you're into
[1:43:49] don't you care cause he cares his eye is
[1:43:52] on the sparrow and i know he watches me
[1:43:55] you think about every sparrow that flies
[1:43:56] by god sees all of them god says when
[1:43:59] they're born god sees that they have
[1:44:00] enough food god sees when they pass from
[1:44:02] this life and we are worth more than
[1:44:04] many sparrows we are worth our soul is
[1:44:07] worth more than ten thousand worlds you
[1:44:10] can't even put a digits behind that how
[1:44:11] much it's worth one soul is worth more
[1:44:14] than ten thousand worlds
[1:44:16] hallelujah so
[1:44:19] he is not unmindful of our suffering
[1:44:22] that's why he even became a man to
[1:44:24] understand our suffering to understand
[1:44:27] what it's like to be rejected and hated
[1:44:28] and despised and spit on and you know
[1:44:31] cursed and made fun of and all those
[1:44:33] things he would understand and go
[1:44:35] through trials and hardship be sick he
[1:44:37] says what a stumbling block this is to
[1:44:40] so many people
[1:44:42] like israel so what's the stumbling
[1:44:44] block
[1:44:45] that god knows our tribulation but he
[1:44:47] doesn't take it from us necessarily
[1:44:49] that's a stumbling block because i
[1:44:50] thought he was a god of all love
[1:44:51] wouldn't he just keep us from it
[1:44:54] like israel they wonder if god really
[1:44:56] loves them
[1:44:58] how can god be just
[1:45:00] and loving if he stands by and watches
[1:45:02] his people suffer that's the question
[1:45:04] isn't
[1:45:05] how can it be this way
[1:45:07] this is what they asked in malachi 1
[1:45:09] verses 1 to 3 the burden of the word of
[1:45:12] the lord to israel by malachi i have
[1:45:14] loved you sad the lord yet you say when
[1:45:16] has thou loved us
[1:45:18] was not esau jacob's brother saith the
[1:45:21] lord yet i loved jacob and i hated esau
[1:45:25] and laid his mountains and his heritage
[1:45:26] waste for the dragons of the wilderness
[1:45:28] you see they could not figure out god's
[1:45:31] love and this is how the devil gets us
[1:45:33] because we're in our human mind trying
[1:45:34] to work out god's love and the devil
[1:45:36] comes along says yes see he doesn't love
[1:45:37] you the way you think he should love you
[1:45:41] they thought that love meant no
[1:45:43] suffering
[1:45:44] they thought that love meant a baby with
[1:45:46] parental care what's a baby with
[1:45:48] parental care they never hurt themselves
[1:45:51] they're out of harm's way they get
[1:45:53] picked up you know they get they get
[1:45:55] looked after that's that's parental care
[1:45:57] right
[1:45:58] but god said that his love was elective
[1:46:00] love the proof of his love is election
[1:46:04] no matter what happened his love is
[1:46:06] proven truly by the fact that we were
[1:46:08] chosen unto salvation because god hath
[1:46:11] chosen you to salvation through
[1:46:13] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:46:15] of the truth he may commit you to death
[1:46:17] as he did paul he may commit you to
[1:46:19] suffering as he did job that is his
[1:46:21] prerogative he is sovereign that means
[1:46:23] that's his
[1:46:24] choice but it is all with a purpose if
[1:46:28] he did not have a purpose then he would
[1:46:30] be the author of frustration and not of
[1:46:32] peace his purpose is after we have
[1:46:35] suffered a while we would be made
[1:46:36] perfect be established strengthened and
[1:46:39] settled who wants to be that
[1:46:41] amen perfect established strengthened
[1:46:43] and sealed as job said he put strength
[1:46:46] in us that's job 23 uh the be part of
[1:46:48] verse six
[1:46:50] we you see he himself suffered
[1:46:53] he learned obedience by the things that
[1:46:55] he suffered he was actually made perfect
[1:46:57] by the things that he suffered hebrews 5
[1:46:59] 8 and 9. though he were a son yet he
[1:47:02] learned obedience by things which he
[1:47:04] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:47:06] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:47:08] unto all them that obey him in plain
[1:47:10] language the very character of jesus was
[1:47:13] perfected by suffering
[1:47:15] and according to paul he has left his
[1:47:17] church a measure of suffering that they
[1:47:19] too by their faith in god while
[1:47:21] suffering for him would come to a place
[1:47:24] of perfection why did he want this james
[1:47:27] 1 2 to 4 my brethren cannibal joy when
[1:47:30] you fall into divers temptations knowing
[1:47:32] this that the trying of your faith
[1:47:34] worketh patience but let patience have a
[1:47:37] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[1:47:39] entire wanting nothing
[1:47:42] why does he stand by the reason of this
[1:47:44] is in romans 8 17 and 18 and of children
[1:47:47] then heirs ears of god and joint is with
[1:47:50] christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:47:52] that we may also
[1:47:55] that we may be also glorified together
[1:47:57] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:47:59] present time are not worthy to be
[1:48:01] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:48:03] revealed in us unless we suffer with him
[1:48:06] we cannot reign with him if he wants to
[1:48:08] be an overcomer to sit down in his
[1:48:10] throne as he sat down in his father's
[1:48:12] throne right
[1:48:14] unless we so
[1:48:16] we have to suffer to rain the reason for
[1:48:18] this is that character simply is never
[1:48:20] made without suffering character is a
[1:48:23] victory not a gift
[1:48:26] we all want to be like jesus
[1:48:29] it's a victory not a gift oh but i've
[1:48:32] got the holy ghost yeah but you've got
[1:48:34] to keep yourself dead daily that he can
[1:48:36] grow and take over your life
[1:48:38] right a man without character can't
[1:48:40] reign because power apart from character
[1:48:43] is satanic but power with character is
[1:48:46] fit to rule and since he wants us to
[1:48:49] share even his throne on the same basis
[1:48:51] that he overcame is set down at his
[1:48:53] father's throne then we have to overcome
[1:48:55] to sit with him and a little temporary
[1:48:58] suffering we go through now is not
[1:49:00] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:49:03] glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:49:05] he comes oh what treasures are laid out
[1:49:07] for those who are willing to enter into
[1:49:10] his kingdom through much tribulation
[1:49:13] who are willing to enter into his
[1:49:16] kingdom through most tribulation are we
[1:49:17] willing this morning
[1:49:19] whatever it may be lord i want to enter
[1:49:21] into your kingdom
[1:49:23] think it not strange concerning the
[1:49:25] fiery trials that are to try you now
[1:49:27] this word strange it actually means
[1:49:28] something foreign
[1:49:30] so so don't think it's like a novel
[1:49:31] foreign thing when you have these fiery
[1:49:34] trials
[1:49:35] you know everyone in the world has
[1:49:37] trials too eh
[1:49:39] they have hardship too so there's
[1:49:41] nothing that comes upon us that's not
[1:49:42] common to man
[1:49:44] many things are just what's called the
[1:49:45] grab bag of life
[1:49:47] you know you just pull something out of
[1:49:48] the grab bag of life it may be sickness
[1:49:50] maybe distress trouble whatever but it's
[1:49:51] just but it's what you do with it when
[1:49:54] it lays in your lap well this isn't fair
[1:49:56] no god wants to show his power in this
[1:49:58] so it's up to you are you willing to go
[1:50:00] through much tribulation to enter into
[1:50:02] the kingdom of god
[1:50:04] this is what peter said it is strange
[1:50:06] that god wants to develop a christ-like
[1:50:08] character that comes through suffering
[1:50:09] no sir and we all have trials we are all
[1:50:12] tried and chastened as sons
[1:50:15] not what not one but goes through that
[1:50:18] the church now listen to this the church
[1:50:20] that is not suffering and is not being
[1:50:22] tried hasn't got it it isn't of god
[1:50:27] hallelujah
[1:50:29] we get all the stress there's trouble in
[1:50:30] the church we're being tried well ever
[1:50:33] well if it was a it was a flowery bed of
[1:50:36] ease
[1:50:37] says the prophet tells us we're not of
[1:50:39] god
[1:50:41] hallelujah
[1:50:43] praise the lord i think we're doing good
[1:50:45] we're off the right track
[1:50:49] hallelujah why because god has to test
[1:50:51] that the genuineness of our faith will
[1:50:53] be tried
[1:50:54] see real love is not proven when
[1:50:56] everything's going fine real love is
[1:50:58] proven when everything's yo
[1:51:01] stuff's hit the fan there's trouble you
[1:51:03] know
[1:51:04] you gotta make decisions you got to lay
[1:51:06] down your life or pick up that you know
[1:51:08] either pick up that resentment or lay it
[1:51:10] down pick up that unbelief or lay it
[1:51:12] down pick up that pain or lay it down
[1:51:14] deny yourself pick up your cross and
[1:51:16] follow him you gotta yeah it's all those
[1:51:17] kind of decisions
[1:51:19] amen hebrews 12
[1:51:21] 6 and 8 for whom the lord loveth he
[1:51:24] chastised and scourgeth every son whom
[1:51:27] he receiveth but if you be without
[1:51:29] chastisement
[1:51:31] where we're of all our partakers then
[1:51:33] you are bastards and not sons
[1:51:36] amen
[1:51:37] so god's love is elective
[1:51:40] don't misunderstand the love of god
[1:51:43] how does it how do i know he loved me
[1:51:44] because he called me
[1:51:46] he predestined me for the foundation of
[1:51:48] the world
[1:51:50] hallelujah he decided to love me
[1:51:53] amen before there was anything amen see
[1:51:56] eventually the disciples woke jesus and
[1:51:58] i said i think in the beginning why
[1:52:00] don't we just bypass trying to fix the
[1:52:02] problem and complaining about the
[1:52:04] situation and just wake the master
[1:52:06] i think it's a good way remember they
[1:52:08] were boatmen they they had basically
[1:52:10] been born on the sea of galilee they
[1:52:11] knew how the storms operated you know
[1:52:13] they knew how the boat worked they
[1:52:14] probably built the thing
[1:52:16] but
[1:52:17] they should have just bypassed all them
[1:52:18] trying to fix it and just wake the
[1:52:20] master
[1:52:24] see
[1:52:25] the devil always tries to get us at a
[1:52:26] low point
[1:52:28] he says brother brahms isn't looking to
[1:52:30] the unseen
[1:52:32] uh just as a great um he says people in
[1:52:34] here this may seem strange to you
[1:52:38] but but it's not he says satan is always
[1:52:40] near
[1:52:42] to try and get something fumbled up in
[1:52:44] your mind
[1:52:45] but tonight set your affections on
[1:52:47] things above where christ sits at the
[1:52:50] right hand of god and remember the bible
[1:52:52] says the same yesterday today and
[1:52:53] forever and if his spirit be he reveals
[1:52:56] things today as he did in days gone by
[1:52:58] heavens and earth will pass away but his
[1:53:00] words shall not pass have faith in god
[1:53:03] don't doubt it says satan comes in tries
[1:53:05] to fumble things up in our mind is it
[1:53:08] true is it not true what have i got to
[1:53:09] do tomorrow what happened last week with
[1:53:11] this person he tries to fumble up our
[1:53:13] mind but he says don't
[1:53:15] think on those things
[1:53:17] set your affections on things above
[1:53:21] he says in raising dries his daughter
[1:53:22] again now out here on this little old
[1:53:24] sea tossed about ten thousand devils of
[1:53:26] the sea swore that drowned him while he
[1:53:28] was lying back there tired you know the
[1:53:30] devil takes advantage of you when you
[1:53:32] get tired of war out
[1:53:34] who's had that situation you're all
[1:53:36] feeling good and you're all alert and
[1:53:38] had good sleep and rest it the devil
[1:53:40] doesn't really hang around there but
[1:53:41] it's when you get worn out and tired
[1:53:43] your nerves get on edge you just need to
[1:53:44] rest you know you're all this is when he
[1:53:46] turns up because the devil's a coward
[1:53:50] he does you the same way you just get a
[1:53:52] little tired and wore out and get
[1:53:54] discouraged
[1:53:56] normally when people are worn out and
[1:53:58] tired discouragement comes with that
[1:54:00] sometimes we just got to sit back and
[1:54:01] say i'm just tired this is why i feel
[1:54:03] this way
[1:54:06] certainly he caught jesus right there at
[1:54:08] that weak spot tried and weary he was
[1:54:11] laying back there in the back of the
[1:54:12] boat
[1:54:13] rocking around and the bible said that
[1:54:15] the storm came down upon the sea and
[1:54:17] began to toss the boat the disciples
[1:54:19] said caress thou not that we perish he
[1:54:21] said where is your faith looking around
[1:54:23] in the great winds and waves obeyed him
[1:54:25] what was he doing crossing a rough sea
[1:54:27] that night because one soul in gadara
[1:54:30] was ready to receive him one soul in
[1:54:32] gadara don't you know that the trouble
[1:54:34] you may be going through might be you're
[1:54:35] on your way to one soul
[1:54:37] that they would meet the lord this is
[1:54:39] why you're in the storm right now that
[1:54:41] actually on the other side of the storm
[1:54:42] is a soul that's crying out
[1:54:44] and god uses his body to go and get that
[1:54:47] soul
[1:54:48] so never ever just look at the you know
[1:54:50] there's a problem trouble comes words
[1:54:52] become very internal
[1:54:53] me me me why why why you know you look
[1:54:56] at the big picture
[1:54:58] this is work this light affliction is
[1:55:00] working a great far more exceeding
[1:55:01] weight and glory for me and you may not
[1:55:05] realize that actually
[1:55:07] when this when you awake the master
[1:55:09] and he deals with the storm
[1:55:11] there's a soul on the other side
[1:55:14] you know if the disciples now we know
[1:55:15] they couldn't drown and jesus couldn't
[1:55:18] drown but if you go into that very
[1:55:19] moment if they didn't wake him up
[1:55:21] they would have been swimming
[1:55:23] the boat would have gone down
[1:55:25] right they had to wake him up
[1:55:28] call them on the scene
[1:55:31] we don't want to get caught up in too
[1:55:32] much of our trials we need remember god
[1:55:35] puts blitz in trouble's mouth and makes
[1:55:37] it allow us to have a closer fellowship
[1:55:39] with god
[1:55:41] hallelujah but you see the problem is
[1:55:42] there this this age that we live in um
[1:55:45] and and i'm trying to come down to a
[1:55:47] close here the problem with the age that
[1:55:49] we live in is we are conditioned this
[1:55:51] age is conditioned to look at the
[1:55:53] natural blessings and equate them with
[1:55:55] spiritual blessings
[1:55:57] he said you know this is the later
[1:55:58] seeing age that we live in we know that
[1:56:00] you know people are conditioned to
[1:56:01] quantify how spiritual or how blessed
[1:56:04] the believer is based on their material
[1:56:06] possessions
[1:56:08] say in revelations 3 and 17 because thou
[1:56:10] sayest i am rich increase with goods and
[1:56:12] have need of nothing and knows not that
[1:56:15] they are wretched miserable poor blind
[1:56:16] and naked but this age is saying i'm
[1:56:19] rich increase with goods i have need of
[1:56:21] nothing i'm self-sufficient i don't need
[1:56:23] anything
[1:56:24] this is the way we are even as i said
[1:56:26] when i first went to papua new guinea i
[1:56:28] went to a pentecostal church there they
[1:56:30] were having a bible study no actually a
[1:56:32] preacher was preaching on this very
[1:56:33] verse and saying look we're richard and
[1:56:35] chris with goods
[1:56:36] and in our mind in the first world no
[1:56:39] they're not but relatively to where they
[1:56:40] were a generation ago to where they are
[1:56:42] now their risk increase with goods
[1:56:45] but you see they so but they think
[1:56:47] people think oh god's blessing me
[1:56:48] because i have all this material things
[1:56:50] that can be a sign of god's blessing but
[1:56:52] not not necessarily
[1:56:54] but if hardship comes and our bank
[1:56:55] account becomes just a whole bunch of
[1:56:57] zeros with no number before it you know
[1:57:00] we think oh god's forsaken me and no i'm
[1:57:02] in trouble and how's this ever you know
[1:57:04] going through this trial no no don't
[1:57:06] acquaint
[1:57:07] don't don't
[1:57:09] put on power of natural things with the
[1:57:11] blessings of god
[1:57:13] right just because you have no money
[1:57:15] doesn't mean god hates you or is
[1:57:16] displeased with you just like doesn't
[1:57:18] mean if you have a billion dollars
[1:57:19] suddenly fall into your life that god
[1:57:20] loves you it doesn't work that way but
[1:57:22] this age has been conditioned that way
[1:57:24] that if you're doing prosperity if
[1:57:26] you're prospering then god is blessing
[1:57:28] you
[1:57:29] no
[1:57:30] not at all but you see what's that basic
[1:57:33] now everyone's faith is based on what
[1:57:35] they can see with their five senses look
[1:57:38] at my bank account it can all go
[1:57:39] tomorrow
[1:57:40] you know it wasn't long ago in germany
[1:57:42] between the world wars that the german
[1:57:45] mark was you know the valley just
[1:57:46] dropped out through the bottom and a
[1:57:48] wheelbarrow of of their money barely
[1:57:50] bought a loaf of bread
[1:57:53] you know and it's happened in other
[1:57:54] countries as well but you know it can be
[1:57:56] all gone tomorrow oh the new zealand
[1:57:58] dollar is doing well it can be all gone
[1:58:00] tomorrow and then where will we be we
[1:58:02] shouldn't be in despair say praise god
[1:58:05] holy now lord you really you're still
[1:58:06] jehovah gyra
[1:58:08] you provided a meal yesterday you'll
[1:58:10] provide it today you'll feed me in this
[1:58:12] great time of trouble this is this is
[1:58:14] how this should be our attitude hey amen
[1:58:17] hallelujah
[1:58:19] amen so this agent forge has been
[1:58:21] conditioned to think that what we see
[1:58:22] with our five senses yeah we think
[1:58:24] praise the lord we've got new you know
[1:58:26] we've we've got new chairs holy the
[1:58:28] lord's blessing us and we can be sitting
[1:58:30] on the floor
[1:58:31] wouldn't really make any difference
[1:58:33] you know let's not get caught up with
[1:58:34] the five senses
[1:58:36] to see if the lord loves us or not no he
[1:58:38] said in his word he loves us he sent
[1:58:40] this message to you
[1:58:41] and what is it it's a love letter
[1:58:44] you're my bride come walk with me
[1:58:47] amen
[1:58:48] so now but it's amazing the apostle paul
[1:58:51] now
[1:58:52] you know the apostle paul was a real
[1:58:53] person eh
[1:58:55] he had the same emotional realm like us
[1:58:57] he had troubles you know but he was a
[1:59:00] human he wasn't some sometimes we take
[1:59:02] the heroes of faith we place them on
[1:59:03] some big pedestal up here and think
[1:59:05] they're super human they weren't
[1:59:07] superhuman they were like us
[1:59:09] the bible says that elijah was a man of
[1:59:11] like passion so he was like us
[1:59:13] right the woman in the bible too you
[1:59:14] know they're all so the apostle paul
[1:59:17] you would think here he is
[1:59:20] he's now sitting this is the book of
[1:59:21] philippians
[1:59:23] he never ever had a pity party
[1:59:26] he never ever felt sorry for himself he
[1:59:28] never questioned god why he never did
[1:59:32] he would say in philippians 1 and 12
[1:59:34] this is the time and where one time when
[1:59:36] he was in uh in prison
[1:59:39] i would say you should understand
[1:59:41] brethren
[1:59:42] that the things which happen unto me
[1:59:44] have fallen out rather until the
[1:59:45] furtherance which is the progress or
[1:59:48] advancement of the gospel
[1:59:51] so so that my bonds in christ are
[1:59:53] manifest in all the palace and in all
[1:59:55] other
[1:59:56] places so he's saying i'm in prison
[2:00:00] but this actually worked out for the
[2:00:01] furtherance of the gospel
[2:00:03] why because he was such a living witness
[2:00:06] that actually advanced the gospel now if
[2:00:08] you look at his current state he's in
[2:00:10] prison
[2:00:11] how is that yo
[2:00:12] he's down and out
[2:00:14] obviously god has turned us back from
[2:00:16] because look god said he'll fight our
[2:00:17] battles deliver us from our enemy you
[2:00:19] know we'll be overcoming all these
[2:00:20] things and but the man's in prison he's
[2:00:22] going to be the first church age
[2:00:24] messenger he's in prison but that's a
[2:00:26] natural eye
[2:00:27] but spiritually he's saying brethren you
[2:00:29] need to realize
[2:00:30] this is actually advancing the gospel
[2:00:33] this is actually working god is this
[2:00:34] isn't god's program that i'm here
[2:00:37] hallelujah now what if he sat there in a
[2:00:40] pity party
[2:00:41] do you think the gospel would have been
[2:00:42] advanced
[2:00:44] no remember he's a human like you know
[2:00:46] he had a decision to make
[2:00:47] was this situation going to make him
[2:00:49] bitter
[2:00:50] against god or better
[2:00:52] because there's the two things every
[2:00:54] everything that comes in life it's a
[2:00:56] fork in the road will it make me bitter
[2:00:58] will it make me better
[2:00:59] but it's your choice which way you go
[2:01:01] it's like you're driving a car should i
[2:01:03] turn left or right
[2:01:05] now the bitter road can seem a lot more
[2:01:07] comfortable because unfortunately humans
[2:01:08] get that way naturally but you've got to
[2:01:10] have an eagle vision and say no no this
[2:01:13] will make me better i'll not let this
[2:01:15] rule me but but the lord will use this
[2:01:17] if i send it to him as a trophy of his
[2:01:19] grace that he can use this down the road
[2:01:21] for someone else
[2:01:23] amen
[2:01:24] now the apostle paul would say in romans
[2:01:26] 8 28 and we know all things work
[2:01:28] together for good to them that love god
[2:01:30] and to them that was called according to
[2:01:32] his purpose he was a man that was
[2:01:34] shipwrecked as i've said he was bitten
[2:01:36] by a poisonous snake he was beaten he
[2:01:38] was stoned he had to run for his life
[2:01:40] you know many things happened to him he
[2:01:42] says all things work together for good
[2:01:44] when i stoned i was working for good
[2:01:46] when i was shipwrecked i was working for
[2:01:48] good when i was running out of that city
[2:01:50] it was working for good me now we may
[2:01:52] not understand how that specific moment
[2:01:55] was working for good but that was
[2:01:57] developing a character in him and making
[2:02:00] him a greater living testimony
[2:02:04] hallelujah
[2:02:05] i love these words because this was not
[2:02:07] just a nice idea that came to paul he
[2:02:09] lived this out
[2:02:11] for whom he did for know he did also
[2:02:13] predestine to be conformed to the image
[2:02:15] of his son that he might be the first
[2:02:17] born among many brethren we know all
[2:02:19] things work together for our good day
[2:02:21] where you are right now if you're a
[2:02:23] really cool elected son or daughter of
[2:02:25] god is working for your good
[2:02:27] hallelujah
[2:02:29] remember he did yeah whom he did for no
[2:02:31] he did also predestinate to be conformed
[2:02:33] to the image of his son that he might be
[2:02:35] the firstborn among many brethren
[2:02:37] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[2:02:39] he also called and whom he called them
[2:02:42] he also justified and whom he justified
[2:02:44] them he also glorified what shall we say
[2:02:46] to these things
[2:02:48] if god be for us who can be against us
[2:02:50] he that spared not his own son but
[2:02:52] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[2:02:55] not with him also freely give us all
[2:02:57] things who shall lay anything to the
[2:02:59] charge of god's elect it is god that
[2:03:01] justifieth
[2:03:03] who is he that condemneth it's christ
[2:03:05] that died yet rather that has risen
[2:03:07] again who is even at the right hand of
[2:03:09] god who who also maketh into session for
[2:03:12] us who shall separate from the love of
[2:03:14] christ shall tribulation he went through
[2:03:17] tribulation or distress he had distress
[2:03:19] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[2:03:22] pearl or sword as is written for thy
[2:03:25] sakes we are killed all the day long we
[2:03:27] are accounted as sheep
[2:03:29] for the slaughter
[2:03:31] now in all these things we are more than
[2:03:32] conquerors through him that loved us for
[2:03:34] i am persuaded that neither death nor
[2:03:36] life nor angels nor principality nor
[2:03:39] powers nor things present nor things to
[2:03:40] come nor height nor depth nor any
[2:03:42] creature shall be able to separate us
[2:03:44] from the love of god which is in christ
[2:03:46] jesus our lord all those things tried to
[2:03:48] separate him and that's what the devil
[2:03:50] does he tries to separate us from the
[2:03:52] love of god but he is but the apostle
[2:03:54] paul based on experience was persuaded
[2:03:56] nothing can separate me
[2:03:58] hallelujah it should be the same thing
[2:04:00] with you and i
[2:04:02] hallelujah
[2:04:04] the apostle paul never blamed god for
[2:04:05] the state he found himself in
[2:04:08] i said lord jesus help us to be the same
[2:04:10] in every situation to conduct ourselves
[2:04:13] as sons and daughters of god
[2:04:16] now he would say in ephesians i've just
[2:04:18] got a couple more scriptures to read in
[2:04:19] them and then and then we'll quit
[2:04:22] he says in ephesians 5 be not drunk with
[2:04:24] wine we're in a success but be filled
[2:04:27] with the spirit speaking to yourselves
[2:04:29] in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[2:04:32] singing and make making melody in your
[2:04:34] heart to the lord
[2:04:36] giving thanks always for all things
[2:04:38] under god and the father name of our
[2:04:40] lord jesus christ now i just want to
[2:04:43] point something out he did not put
[2:04:45] conditions on this
[2:04:47] if you're happy sing songs
[2:04:49] if you're rejoicing if everything's
[2:04:50] going well be this way no he says in all
[2:04:52] things
[2:04:53] he says giving thanks always for all
[2:04:55] things unto god
[2:04:57] that it that was that that's all things
[2:05:00] you have a bad day thank you lord having
[2:05:02] a great day thank you lord having a
[2:05:04] terrible week hallelujah having a bad
[2:05:06] year glory to god
[2:05:08] thank you lord praise your name anyway
[2:05:11] amen
[2:05:13] hallelujah david would say in psalms 34
[2:05:16] i'll bless the lord at all times
[2:05:18] all times his praise shall continually
[2:05:21] be in my mouth you know if you've got
[2:05:22] the praise of god in your mouth you know
[2:05:24] you can't i can't have anything else
[2:05:26] right you've got a capacity you must
[2:05:28] fill it up with the praise of god my
[2:05:30] soul shall make her boast in the lord
[2:05:32] and the humble shall hear thereof and be
[2:05:34] glad oh magnify the law with me let us
[2:05:37] exalt his name together i sought the
[2:05:39] lord and he heard me and delivered me
[2:05:40] from all my fears they looked upon him
[2:05:43] and were lightened and their faces were
[2:05:44] not ashamed this poor man cried and the
[2:05:47] lord heard him and saved him out of all
[2:05:49] his troubles the angel of the lord and
[2:05:51] command uh encampeth about them that
[2:05:54] fear him and delivereth them o taste and
[2:05:56] see that the lord is good blessed is the
[2:05:58] man that trusteth in him oh fear the
[2:06:01] lord ye his saints for there is no want
[2:06:03] to them that fear him
[2:06:06] so i'm going to ask you the question
[2:06:09] in your trials do you miss the blessing
[2:06:12] do you miss the almighty god wants to
[2:06:14] reveal his power in your trial doesn't
[2:06:16] matter how big it is how small is he
[2:06:17] wants to reveal himself in that trial
[2:06:19] but if we're caught up in what we see in
[2:06:21] the poor means we'll miss it
[2:06:23] but if we look to the lord remember you
[2:06:26] have found favor in the sight of god
[2:06:27] that's why trials have come upon you the
[2:06:29] grace of god has come upon you and and
[2:06:32] the reason
[2:06:33] that happens or what is shown by that is
[2:06:36] what a trial has happened
[2:06:38] hallelujah so you're blessed you say i'm
[2:06:40] going through the worst part of my life
[2:06:41] ever you're very blessed hallelujah
[2:06:44] that's why i should lift up you know you

[2:06:50] heads and know your redemption draweth
[2:06:52] nigh hence i look down at these things
[2:06:53] in the trouble no lift up your heads
[2:06:56] look up to him
[2:06:57] why because your redemption draweth nigh
[2:07:00] so i said lord jesus help us to conduct
[2:07:02] ourselves like sons and daughters of god
[2:07:04] in the trial not to miss his hand in the
[2:07:07] trial
