[45:35] home
[45:36] god bless you good to have all the
[45:37] visitors here if you could just have
[45:40] your seats we're just going to have a
[45:41] bit of housekeeping before we turn to
[45:43] the scripture so we've had a you know
[45:53] the church has evolved from the 11 er
[45:57] you know a living of us that we had in
[46:00] the very beginning five years ago
[46:01] there's a few more of us now and so I've
[46:04] been wanting to kind of just place
[46:09] everything in its order but also to see
[46:13] the church evolve you're the officers in
[46:15] the church how they operate to see them
[46:17] evolve into how the Bible of the message
[46:19] says a church should function and so a
[46:24] part of that is um so brother could bin
[46:26] if you could come up here please come
[46:27] stand by my side I mean so as we all
[46:30] know brother Campinas our deacon we love
[46:32] him dearly and but we know that we know
[46:35] that it's not only that we love him
[46:36] but I believe that he's a real deacon
[46:39] and we've all seen him how he operates
[46:42] how he conducts himself you know he
[46:45] doesn't he doesn't you know he he
[46:49] handles every situation in a very godly
[46:51] manner and that's very important because
[46:53] we know a deacon as the policeman of the
[46:58] church he's here to keep the order of
[47:00] the church and you know make sure that
[47:02] everything is how it should be this is a
[47:03] deacons responsibility a deacon is not a
[47:06] glorified uh sure you know I'm just
[47:09] laying these things out because we need
[47:10] to be reminded of these things
[47:11] this is I want to empower every officer
[47:14] in the church they can function how they
[47:15] should so a deacon is not a glorified uh
[47:18] sure
[47:19] so brother could be and he can delegate
[47:20] this job even though he does it very
[47:23] well and you see his training in
[47:24] warehousing
[47:25] to put everything in its place and you
[47:27] can see that there's been training for
[47:28] for this place but the families in the
[47:31] right place so it all works out but
[47:32] that's not as main function as main
[47:34] function is to be a policeman of the
[47:36] church to to keep order that when the
[47:38] word is going forth or witness you know
[47:40] singing is happening that that this
[47:42] order in place so it's not there's
[47:44] nothing in place that can disrupt the
[47:45] spirit moving because we all want to
[47:47] have an environment where God is welcome
[47:49] and God comes down and God meets us this
[47:52] this is what we want this is why we have
[47:54] things in place that's why we have
[47:55] church order and so so if he wishes to
[47:59] delegate the job of ushering you're
[48:02] welcome to do that should you wish do so
[48:04] if you get deputized
[48:05] it's um that that's that's all up to to
[48:09] to brother convene so now and and the
[48:13] message God hiding himself in simplicity
[48:15] brother brems dedicating the expansion
[48:18] of the tabernacle before he preaches the
[48:19] seals and he says and any any scissors
[48:22] is now this may seem a little rude but
[48:25] this is not a place to visit he's
[48:27] speaking of the sanctuary of the church
[48:28] now we know we don't have a sealed-off
[48:31] sanctuary we can't put a wall in the
[48:33] landlord won't let us do it and even if
[48:35] we did would be too small you know but
[48:37] this is this is a place this is God's
[48:40] place we've we've dedicated this for the
[48:43] service of God and there's plenty of
[48:45] other places where we can go visit each
[48:47] other and the wonderful thing about us
[48:50] is I believe there's no cliques among us
[48:51] we all love each other we would love to
[48:53] spend time with each other we love to
[48:55] talk to each other so it's hard to
[48:57] separate and go our separate ways after
[48:59] a service bishop when God comes down
[49:00] we're all happy and we're being
[49:02] delivered and we feel you know rejoicing
[49:04] and you know we want to have fellowship
[49:06] and so on but this is not the place to
[49:07] have that after service okay so you can
[49:10] go we have put a black line on the wall
[49:12] you know on the floor so feel free to
[49:15] have fellowship that side of the line or
[49:16] go on to the kitchen or go outside
[49:18] you're more than what but please do do
[49:21] not speak in here say God bless you
[49:24] hello but you know
[49:25] keep it to a bare minimum if you want to
[49:27] have any kind of discussion please take
[49:29] it out he says now it's not a place to
[49:32] visit it's a place of worship
[49:34] we should never even murmur a word
[49:36] inside here outside of worship to one
[49:37] another unless it's absolutely necessary
[49:39] see we should never rally around we
[49:42] should never run through the building or
[49:43] let our children run through the
[49:44] building and so doing this feeling not
[49:46] long ago that of doing this we
[49:48] constructed it so we could take care of
[49:50] all that now we can't do that but we
[49:51] still want to have the same thing
[49:52] implemented okay because we should
[49:55] respect you know you know this place
[49:58] here we pay the same rent as we did
[50:00] downstairs and it's far bigger God as
[50:03] God has been good do you say well that's
[50:05] just a natural thing I believe God
[50:06] inspired the landlord who's not even a
[50:08] believer that I know of to allow us to
[50:10] have this place and Rick and and if you
[50:13] ever search for rent for anywhere else
[50:14] it's far more expensive we couldn't
[50:16] afford it so I believe God has given
[50:18] this to us and we don't have to sit up
[50:20] and pack up every service and you know
[50:22] have a hall or someplace we're gonna
[50:23] place it's always set up it's always
[50:26] dedicated to the service of God so I
[50:28] think we should appreciate this place
[50:29] you know I know you do but I think we
[50:31] should appreciate it more thank you Lord
[50:33] that you've allowed us to have this this
[50:35] little place amen and so now we have the
[50:40] city of course many people are strangers
[50:42] that Tabernacle folks know this that the
[50:43] building's going to be dedicated to the
[50:45] service of the Almighty
[50:46] therefore dedicating ourselves let's
[50:48] remember when we enter that sanctuary be
[50:50] still to one another and worship God so
[50:53] when you come in this door please just
[50:55] this is the sanctuary of God okay now
[50:59] and if you want to visit each other
[51:01] there are places that you may visit each
[51:02] other but never walking around where you
[51:04] can't hear yourself thinking that some
[51:06] person comes and they just don't know
[51:08] what to do see there's so much noise and
[51:10] things it's just humanly I've seen it in
[51:12] churches until it makes me feel real bad
[51:13] because we don't come into the sanctuary
[51:16] Lord to meet each other we come here to
[51:18] worship God then we go to our homes this
[51:20] sanctuary is dedicated to worship amen
[51:24] and then he says and then this is from
[51:26] church order and then I'm so a deacon is
[51:29] asking a question he says now in respect
[51:32] to the order of the church we try to do
[51:34] according to the way we understood it
[51:36] given in the dedication of the new
[51:37] church
[51:37] so there's what I just read so this is
[51:39] after this and now our deacons putting
[51:41] question to brother Brown he says now
[51:42] that's correct you're doing right now
[51:45] this is supposed to be deacons I suppose
[51:47] cause it's right here it's a deacons job
[51:49] to keep the order it's not my job to
[51:51] keep the order of the church
[51:52] my job is dedicated to spiritual things
[51:54] the word the Deacons did a cap to keep
[51:56] the order of the church trustees are the
[51:58] finances and to look after the building
[52:00] Sunday School Superintendent the
[52:02] teachers there for the Sunday school
[52:03] music and audio that's their job
[52:06] musicians that's their job you see so
[52:08] we're gonna I wanted to see it all
[52:10] separate it out because I'm wearing too
[52:12] many hats and I still hold on to these
[52:14] heads I need to let go because as part
[52:16] of why we're doing this now so it's a
[52:19] deacons job and by doing so so there's a
[52:22] person saying we have often people often
[52:23] get mad at us then brother ham says they
[52:25] do it me too they'll do it any man see
[52:28] that person that does that there's
[52:29] something wrong with that person so if
[52:31] brother could be a member it's the
[52:32] office even if it's my children it
[52:34] doesn't matter hood as if brother
[52:36] convinces can you please and you've seen
[52:38] him I'm sure you've seen him in the past
[52:39] he doesn't come in as first little
[52:41] whimper you know commands you to drag
[52:43] them out he comes in a godly way he
[52:46] comes in a respectful way I mean I'm
[52:49] sure you've all seen it so when he comes
[52:51] you he doesn't have a you know he
[52:54] doesn't have a bone to pick with you it
[52:55] doesn't have some vendetta but he sees
[52:57] this is this is not right but he does it
[52:59] Ikuo he does it in a godly way okay and
[53:03] so so they're not right with God for the
[53:06] Spirit of Christ is subject to Christ's
[53:08] teaching so people so people who come
[53:10] against the deacon in the wrong way I
[53:12] mean this is what brother Bray I'm
[53:13] saying um he says for the Spirit of
[53:15] Christ is subject to Christ teachings
[53:17] Christ house Christ Odyssey and any man
[53:19] or any woman any person child that will
[53:21] get angry with a godly deacon that would
[53:24] tell them or any parent would get angry
[53:25] with a deacon really we want everybody
[53:28] in this church that we can but it would
[53:30] only cause trouble somewhere else and he
[53:32] says there's a thorn or a rabbit and the
[53:34] woodpile we used to say that person
[53:36] isn't right this is brother brems words
[53:38] he says now if they leave there's only
[53:40] one thing to let them go pray for them
[53:41] see then maybe some of the Deacons go to
[53:43] their house sometime find out why they
[53:45] left and ask them what was wrong then
[53:47] enough they see if he can reconcile them
[53:50] if they can't
[53:51] two or three witnesses with him that
[53:52] they might be understood then if they
[53:54] can't be understood then it stole before
[53:56] the church if they're a member of the
[53:57] church and then there they go so brother
[54:00] cabinas also if you have a need and you
[54:02] can't get to me and you need prayer or
[54:04] you need we need some counseling brother
[54:07] cabinas is also on the job and he's very
[54:10] wise men I believe how he handles things
[54:12] Amen so this is all part of a deacons
[54:14] job and I said god bless you brother
[54:17] could be and also brother Edwin has
[54:27] taken over charge of the logistics and
[54:29] everything related to the music as well
[54:30] the so brother Isaac can focus on the
[54:33] recording and everything he's doing
[54:35] because we want to divide out all the
[54:36] work so if you have any music any
[54:39] questions or comments or something about
[54:40] the music go see brother in one a man
[54:43] cuz he's now in charge of music
[54:47] now let's stand shall we just as we read
[54:50] the scripture crab that slideshow please
[54:53] brother David okay so we're going to
[54:57] Luke chapter 19
[55:15] so look 1935 237 oh no we're gonna keep
[55:26] reading gamble against up in verse 35 he
[55:28] says and they brought and they brought
[55:31] him to Jesus this is this is the cult
[55:34] and they casted garments upon the cult
[55:36] and they set Jesus thereon and as he
[55:40] went they spread their clothes in the
[55:41] way and when he was come nigh even now
[55:44] at the descent of the Mount of Olives
[55:46] the whole multitude of the disciples
[55:48] began to rejoice and praise God with a
[55:50] loud voice for all the mighty works they
[55:53] had seen saying blessed be the king that
[55:58] cometh in the name of the Lord peace in
[56:00] heaven and glory in the highest and some
[56:02] of the Pharisees were among the
[56:04] multitude said said unto Him master
[56:09] rebuked by disciples and he answered
[56:11] said unto them I tell you that if they
[56:13] should hold their peace the stones would
[56:16] immediately cry out what a scene but
[56:19] then now look that but now this is Jesus
[56:22] now he's coming and he says and when he
[56:24] has was come near he beheld the city and
[56:27] wept over it saying if thou had known
[56:29] even though at least in this thy day
[56:34] the thing which belong unto thy peace
[56:36] but now they are hid from thine eyes for
[56:39] the days shall come upon thee that that
[56:42] enemy shall cast a trench about thee and
[56:44] can pass the round and keep thee and on
[56:47] every side and they shall lay thee even
[56:51] with the ground and thy children within
[56:53] thee and they shall not leave thee one
[56:56] stone upon another because they all know
[56:59] us not the time of our visitation I mean
[57:04] this just this just bow heads in a word
[57:06] of Prayer gracious father we have read
[57:09] your word Lord we have come to this or
[57:11] this part of the service may you just
[57:14] take control of every spirit to have
[57:16] preeminence Lord and get glory to
[57:18] yourself
[57:18] father we commit this time into your
[57:20] hands and Jesus Christ then we ask amen
[57:23] amen you may have your seats this
[57:25] morning so it's quite a quite a contrast
[57:28] of a scene we just read here comes Jesus
[57:31] he's coming up and I know you know this
[57:34] story very well but but let's just go
[57:36] back there here comes a man on a on a
[57:38] donkey and and many many men no doubt
[57:42] have written into that gate on a donkey
[57:44] before well this is a different kind of
[57:46] meeting this man has has spoken to two
[57:49] storms and they've been still he spoken
[57:51] to dead people they came back to life
[57:53] again he spoke to all manner of sickness
[57:55] and they were healed hallelujah he cast
[57:58] out many devils he did many incredible
[58:01] things and here and here he was riding
[58:03] on this donkey and the multitude begin
[58:05] to be caught up in a vortex of prophecy
[58:08] being fulfilled and they begin to
[58:10] rejoice Hosanna blessed be the man that
[58:13] comes in the name of the Lord and they
[58:15] lay their garments down this was a
[58:17] procession like no one had ever seen
[58:19] before the people were caught up and
[58:21] worshiping around Roger and and
[58:23] rejoicing because here comes their king
[58:26] helu here comes the he comes the Messiah
[58:29] up into the city and they're all
[58:31] rejoicing but now look at what happened
[58:34] when Jesus beheld the city I want to
[58:38] really I pray if this would just be
[58:39] anchored to every every heart now this
[58:44] is when he beheld the city so these were
[58:46] the people that are beholding him
[58:47] Hosanna blessed be as he that comes in
[58:50] the name of the Lord and thou worshiping
[58:52] him as he as he came into the city but
[58:55] then he beheld the city and wept over it
[58:59] he wasn't rejoicing he was weeping he
[59:03] was crying he was broken he was upset by
[59:06] what he saw saying if thou had us
[59:09] knowing even now at least in this day
[59:13] the things which belong unto thy peace
[59:17] or my at least see but now it has hid
[59:21] from mine eyes he's saying if you had
[59:23] only know the things that belong to your
[59:27] peace if you only knew what you really
[59:30] possessed what was really in titled to
[59:33] you this was the city of the kings this
[59:36] is where the temple was many great
[59:38] prophets had walked through the gates
[59:39] many kings had walked through the gates
[59:41] that incredible things in the city
[59:43] because there were things that were
[59:45] allotted to the city amen but he said if
[59:47] we only knew if you only knew which
[59:51] belonged unto thy peace but they didn't
[59:54] know this is why he whipped do you know
[59:57] what belongs to you he whipped over
[1:00:00] these things and now the word beheld if
[1:00:05] I can just I just get the definition if
[1:00:07] you don't mind me trying to use a bit of
[1:00:08] technology here
[1:00:20] the would be held here at so in the
[1:00:23] Greek it's used only in certain past
[1:00:25] tenses and it means properly to see
[1:00:30] figuratively or blah implication that
[1:00:33] means in the perfect sense only perfect
[1:00:35] tense only to know to be aware to behold
[1:00:38] to consider to look on to perceive it's
[1:00:42] not just a casual a glance he's really
[1:00:45] beholding everything that's in the city
[1:00:47] here's these people they're rejoicing in
[1:00:49] this man riding in this donkey Hosanna
[1:00:51] to the highest and here he's looking at
[1:00:54] them and as I said on Wednesday when
[1:00:56] when Jesus beheld the scribes and
[1:00:58] Pharisees what did he see when he was
[1:01:01] looking into these people because God
[1:01:03] when God looks at a person he doesn't
[1:01:05] look at maybe their facial expression or
[1:01:08] even what they're saying he goes beyond
[1:01:10] the veneer of the mask that we can put
[1:01:13] on he goes beyond the veneer of what we
[1:01:16] can try and project I mean but he looks
[1:01:18] down he looks even past your spirit he
[1:01:20] looks into your soul Emme he looks into
[1:01:23] really what is in you holy is like he
[1:01:26] saw the woman at the well I'll say he
[1:01:27] beheld the woman at the well I mean even
[1:01:30] before he went there he says I need to
[1:01:31] go by the way of Samaria because one of
[1:01:33] my children are there hallelujah and all
[1:01:36] the rest of her village said this is a
[1:01:37] woman that that she's not accepted in
[1:01:39] our village anymore she's an outcast in
[1:01:41] our village I mean because she had too
[1:01:44] many husbands that's why she went to the
[1:01:46] well at the time she did because she
[1:01:47] wasn't welcomed with the other woman I
[1:01:49] mean so so if men looked at that woman
[1:01:52] you'd say I don't I wouldn't want her as
[1:01:54] a neighbor but he comes the very God
[1:01:56] made flesh hallelujah he's looking for a
[1:01:59] part of himself and he beholds one in
[1:02:02] her brokenness and her sadness and her
[1:02:06] in her state of just being unsatisfied
[1:02:08] with life cannot find lovin in the right
[1:02:12] places here she is in her brokenness in
[1:02:14] her rejection and God beholds her and
[1:02:17] says this is mine this is one of mine
[1:02:21] but then when he looks at the scribes
[1:02:23] and Pharisees they may they could have
[1:02:25] quoted all of the old testament from
[1:02:27] even from back to front
[1:02:29] upside down whatever way they want to
[1:02:31] put it whatever language they could have
[1:02:33] quoted it
[1:02:33] could have said all the right things
[1:02:34] done all the right things they could
[1:02:37] have said look at my lineage it's
[1:02:38] perfect that's why I can be a priest a
[1:02:41] member when he beheld them he said
[1:02:43] you're of your father the devil and his
[1:02:45] works you do what a contrast what a
[1:02:48] great contrast and now I put it in your
[1:02:51] lap this morning what does he behold
[1:02:53] when he beholds you Amen because the
[1:02:56] same Jesus in a different form was
[1:02:57] walking in this generation and when he's
[1:03:00] walking upon the earth hallelujah to
[1:03:02] find his elect at once to find his
[1:03:05] beloved ones hallelujah and there's many
[1:03:08] churches around but what happens when he
[1:03:10] beholds you what does he see
[1:03:12] I would ask I pray with all my soul Lord
[1:03:17] may you see a part of yourself I don't
[1:03:20] have a picture here but I was looking
[1:03:21] I've been pondering you know how there's
[1:03:25] especially in South Africa there's all
[1:03:27] the slag heaps is all the waste dirt and
[1:03:29] rock and stuff that's there there's
[1:03:31] piles of it in Johannesburg or maybe
[1:03:33] used to be and people of mining
[1:03:35] companies have have gone and they've
[1:03:37] remind all of those waste heaps and
[1:03:39] they've got tons of gold out of them now
[1:03:42] if you look at a photo of these things
[1:03:44] many times just looks like a big mound
[1:03:45] of dirt there's nothing really a value
[1:03:48] nothing's growing on it there's no life
[1:03:50] there and to me that's humanity we may
[1:03:55] have this kind of natural life don't
[1:03:57] talk about eternal life where see
[1:03:59] where's the precious metal so where's
[1:04:01] the precious park just a big mound and
[1:04:04] here comes Jesus now because because the
[1:04:06] devil looks at you any pie thinks
[1:04:08] there's no real value always make you a
[1:04:09] little slave you'll be a slave down here
[1:04:11] you'll just look after this little thing
[1:04:13] there's no great really value in these
[1:04:14] people but when God looks at you I trust
[1:04:18] he sees I can see a big waste heap but
[1:04:21] in that waste heat this gold and this
[1:04:23] one and that waste heap there's
[1:04:24] something for the Masters use and we
[1:04:26] know gold represents deity in the
[1:04:28] scripture hallelujah so I trust when he
[1:04:30] looks at you I mean he he's not looking
[1:04:33] at the dirt he's not looking at maybe
[1:04:35] the no life he's looking at the gold
[1:04:37] holy that's buried in the dirt
[1:04:39] amen I trust that's what he does
[1:04:42] and you've got to look at yourself and
[1:04:43] say Lord I'm more than a bunch of dirt
[1:04:46] walking around some life in it you know
[1:04:48] I've seen you on Wednesday when God just
[1:04:50] came down in the pre meeting I was
[1:04:51] thinking how great is our salvation how
[1:04:54] great do you really appreciate how great
[1:04:56] it is I mean the salvation of the Lord
[1:04:59] is an incredible thing it's not just a
[1:05:01] haphazard you know maybe just a casual
[1:05:04] thing you say some sinner's prayer it's
[1:05:06] so greater than that I mean what God
[1:05:08] would take your people who are not a
[1:05:09] people and call them by his own name and
[1:05:12] get them to himself I mean watch them in
[1:05:15] their in his own blood
[1:05:16] amen redeem them lift them up to the
[1:05:19] place they should be hallelujah his
[1:05:22] salvation is incredible it's so great I
[1:05:25] mean do we really appreciate what he's
[1:05:27] done amen to take your people who are
[1:05:30] not a people take just a bunch of wasted
[1:05:33] humanity what the devil thinks of you
[1:05:36] amen and and not only just just wash
[1:05:40] them but put his own life in them I mean
[1:05:43] that they became a they become
[1:05:45] identified in him I mean that everything
[1:05:48] hears they become who you you know
[1:05:54] there's a reason why John saw the book
[1:05:57] being taken and he said everything in
[1:06:00] heaven and in earth and under the earth
[1:06:02] heard him cry out glory honor pal
[1:06:07] hallelu here's rejoicing I mean because
[1:06:10] he lost yeah he saw the lamb come forth
[1:06:12] I mean to lay claim on what belong to
[1:06:14] him hallelujah and he knew he was part
[1:06:17] of that book
[1:06:18] amen brother I said John saw John that's
[1:06:20] why he was rejoicing
[1:06:22] hallelujah should be the same thing with
[1:06:24] us I mean when we see when we see this
[1:06:26] message come clear to you
[1:06:27] hallelujah and God is trying to tell you
[1:06:29] you came from eternity you're going back
[1:06:31] to eternity I mean you should be able to
[1:06:33] see yourself in there you should be able
[1:06:35] to see yourself as the eternal attribute
[1:06:37] of God holy that God will come down and
[1:06:40] find you Amen this is not some casual
[1:06:43] just a church or just some nice idea of
[1:06:46] something this is God's Redemption being
[1:06:48] experienced
[1:06:49] hallelujah we're going to be rejoicing
[1:06:51] around the throne and I came to the
[1:06:54] conclusion a while ago if it's an
[1:06:56] eternity it's going to be manifested
[1:06:59] upon the earth

[1:08:15] weep he doesn't say if they only knew
[1:08:17] what belonged to their peace but now
[1:08:21] it's hid from their eyes I trust when he
[1:08:23] beholds you he wouldn't be weeping for
[1:08:25] sadness he'd be weeping for joy I mean
[1:08:28] they know what belongs to their peace I
[1:08:30] mean they know what belongs to their
[1:08:32] salvation I've given to them hallelujah
[1:08:35] they know who I am they know what I've
[1:08:37] done for them hallelujah I trust that so

[1:08:47] on the mountain by the way I'm saying
[1:08:49] prophecy being fulfilled this is what
[1:08:51] was happening in that day prophecies
[1:08:54] being fulfilled now we see what takes
[1:08:57] place now in the book of Zechariah the
[1:08:59] nineteenth chapter xix verse Secor I one
[1:09:02] of the prophet
[1:09:02] spoken the spirit saying this rejoice
[1:09:05] greatly o daughters of Zion hello
[1:09:08] that's you Amen shout o daughters of
[1:09:12] Jerusalem we're not with we're not the

[1:09:31] whinnies when we meet him in the air now
[1:09:33] you see him here
[1:09:34] during his appearing and he's appeared
[1:09:37] among us hallelujah the Centurion now
[1:09:40] I'm not jumping around but once you to
[1:09:42] understand something if God is his word
[1:09:45] and if God has sent his word he is
[1:09:48] present I mean if God has sent his word
[1:09:51] he is present the Centurion understood
[1:09:54] this because the Centurion said to Jesus
[1:09:56] he said I've got a sick servant and
[1:09:58] Jesus says I'll come to your come to
[1:10:00] your houses no I'm not worthy you come
[1:10:02] under my roof just speak the word only
[1:10:04] amen and he'll be healed because of
[1:10:07] Centurion you if God sent His Word
[1:10:09] that's exactly the same as he physically
[1:10:12] standing there in a physical form I mean
[1:10:15] because of the he and his word are the
[1:10:16] same holy and that is Gentile faith I
[1:10:19] mean that is Gentile faith you can
[1:10:21] understand if his word is present he is
[1:10:24] present a man so therefore everything
[1:10:26] God is present I mean cuz the whole
[1:10:29] books come open I mean we don't have a
[1:10:31] partial revelation we have a full
[1:10:33] revelation of who he is I mean the days
[1:10:35] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:10:37] he shall begin to sound all the mystery
[1:10:39] of God should be finished everything God
[1:10:43] is this characters nature everything is
[1:10:45] is it's not a mystery to us
[1:10:47] hallelujah so we should I trust you have
[1:10:50] the same thing God sent his word his
[1:10:53] word is upon the earth that's that's
[1:10:55] Jesus is upon the earth hallelujah
[1:10:58] everything heaven as is present I trust
[1:11:02] you I trust it means something to you
[1:11:04] now thy King cometh unto thee many times
[1:11:10] Jesus comes in a way we don't understand
[1:11:12] we think oh he should come another way
[1:11:14] no this is how he comes
[1:11:16] Allu you having salvation lowly riding
[1:11:20] upon the ass upon the fall the cult of
[1:11:22] an ass now what's the matter with those
[1:11:24] scribes cuz they're saying tell your
[1:11:26] disciples to be quiet and he said if
[1:11:28] they hold their peace the rocks will
[1:11:30] immediately cry out and I pray you
[1:11:32] probably heard people say it many times
[1:11:34] I don't want a rock to take my place I
[1:11:36] don't want some some piece of stone to
[1:11:38] take my place
[1:11:40] amen now what's the matter with those
[1:11:42] scribes or the matter with those priests
[1:11:44] what's the matter with those religious
[1:11:46] people this was right 487 years before
[1:11:50] it happened and by vindicated prophet
[1:11:52] and was already put into writings and
[1:11:55] called the Bible it Scrolls to the Old
[1:11:57] Testament has already put in the Bible I
[1:11:59] mean why couldn't they see that that's
[1:12:01] that prophecy being fulfilled the same
[1:12:03] reason they can't see it today they took
[1:12:05] the word of God and made of none effect
[1:12:07] of the people by teaching for traditions
[1:12:09] the commandments for doctrine the the
[1:12:12] traditions of men hallelujah now let's
[1:12:17] go to 2nd Samuel 5 because when a king
[1:12:22] when a king comes into us into power on
[1:12:26] his throne it actually joins the people
[1:12:30] and the king together there's a uniting
[1:12:32] taking place let's go to 1st Samuel I'm
[1:12:38] sorry second Samuel 5
[1:12:50] see this here
[1:12:54] he says so sick and Samuel five one two
[1:12:57] three then came all the tribes of Israel
[1:13:00] to David under here bran and spake
[1:13:03] saying behold we are thy bone in my
[1:13:05] flesh we're becoming one where your boat
[1:13:09] we are thy bone and thy flesh also in
[1:13:11] times past when Saul was king over us
[1:13:13] thou wast he that leadeth out and
[1:13:15] brought on Israel and the Lord said to
[1:13:17] thee thou shalt feed my people Israel
[1:13:20] and thou shalt be a captain over Israel
[1:13:21] so all the elders of Israel came to the
[1:13:24] king to Hebron and King David were made
[1:13:26] a league with them in Hebron before the
[1:13:28] Lord and they anointed David king over
[1:13:31] Israel we we are by bone and thy flesh
[1:13:36] we are your body this is what he's
[1:13:39] saying to them we are your body now this
[1:13:44] is what should have happened when Jesus
[1:13:45] came into Jerusalem he comes like king
[1:13:48] unto thee and it should have been
[1:13:50] he should know we know he wasn't
[1:13:53] ordained to become an earthly king and
[1:13:55] that part of his ministry that's for the
[1:13:57] Millennium when he becomes son of David
[1:13:59] but this is what should have happened he
[1:14:01] comes the king and they should have
[1:14:03] cried out to him we have our bone and my
[1:14:05] flesh you become the head will be your
[1:14:08] body I mean whatever intelligence you
[1:14:11] have I mean we'll carry it out I mean
[1:14:13] whatever your thoughts are we'll carry
[1:14:16] it out whatever your desires are we'll
[1:14:18] carry them out I mean just like david's
[1:14:21] mighty men he doesn't say you must go
[1:14:23] get me a drink of water from the well of
[1:14:25] Bethlehem he says I long I long for a
[1:14:28] drink and finally I could drink that
[1:14:29] water again and three of his mighty men
[1:14:32] took the smallest of his desires and
[1:14:34] made it the greatest of his commandments
[1:14:36] amen and they cut their way through
[1:14:38] those Philistines and they brought a
[1:14:40] fresh drink of water back to their king
[1:14:42] hallelujah now if that's if that's just
[1:14:44] three men they just have an earthly king
[1:14:46] under the blood of bulls and goats the
[1:14:48] blood of bulls and goats didn't connect
[1:14:50] them to you didn't connect them together
[1:14:52] David as a type of Christ I mean but if
[1:14:55] that is just earthly Pete earthly men
[1:14:57] under the blood of bulls and goats his
[1:14:59] smallest desire became the greatest
[1:15:01] commandment now how much more the Bride
[1:15:03] of Christ amen that have been united to
[1:15:06] their head by the blood of Jesus
[1:15:07] Christ amen that al King is not we
[1:15:10] become one without King I mean that the
[1:15:13] smallest of his desire becomes our
[1:15:15] greatest commandment that's how it
[1:15:17] should be I mean what is pleasing to you
[1:15:19] I want to be identified with you guys I
[1:15:22] want to be identified with your word not
[1:15:24] just the nice bits I mean but the not
[1:15:27] nice bits
[1:15:28] I mean the bits that being a bringer
[1:15:30] approach I mean the bits that make me
[1:15:33] look like an oddball to the world I want
[1:15:35] to be identified with those boots the
[1:15:37] bits that make me an outcast I want to
[1:15:39] be identified with those boots because
[1:15:41] that's all part of them you know we can
[1:15:43] all stand and we can rejoice and we can
[1:15:45] air fellowship with anyone who who
[1:15:47] claims Christianity jesus paid it all
[1:15:50] you get a wonderful fellowship and you
[1:15:53] know you can you can rejoice in certain
[1:15:55] things but when it comes down to
[1:15:56] different things even basic things like
[1:15:58] baptism you don't need the Prophet tells
[1:16:01] us you don't need a revelation for
[1:16:02] baptism it's all in the scripture you
[1:16:04] just go read it and it makes sense even
[1:16:06] things are that people say I have
[1:16:07] nothing to do with that and it's crazy
[1:16:09] because that's the one thing that you
[1:16:11] are showing this world of the next world
[1:16:13] I'm being buried with my husband I'm
[1:16:16] taking on his name amen I'm being United
[1:16:19] with him in baptism they'll come forth
[1:16:21] in Eunice of life even that part
[1:16:23] Malta's you say why that's not important
[1:16:26] and and that's their attitude is we
[1:16:28] don't care what the word says we're not
[1:16:30] worried about it we're not interested we
[1:16:32] don't want to be identified what does
[1:16:35] that know that's the casual relationship
[1:16:36] I don't want to catch your relationship
[1:16:39] I want to be married hallelujah on being
[1:16:42] United a man I trust you've experienced
[1:16:45] the same thing hallelujah so we are his
[1:16:49] bones in his flesh now let's go let's go
[1:16:58] here now this is speaking of this is
[1:17:01] speaking of our day he says then shall
[1:17:04] come all the tribes of Israel are
[1:17:06] waiting I haven't yeah for Zions sake
[1:17:10] now Zion we know speaks as the Bride of
[1:17:12] Christ it's not just a place in the
[1:17:15] promised land it speaks of you it speaks
[1:17:18] of you here's the Zions sake I'll not
[1:17:21] hold my
[1:17:21] peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will
[1:17:24] not rest now will go read in Revelations
[1:17:27] after this that the New Jerusalem speaks
[1:17:29] of you that's not just a physical city
[1:17:33] there's a people that are part of that
[1:17:35] city amen and so when he's talking about
[1:17:38] Jerusalem that's why that's why the Son
[1:17:41] of Man in this age when he came down
[1:17:43] revealed himself through a prophet he
[1:17:45] came to Jerusalem he came to the
[1:17:46] churches and he whipped if they only
[1:17:52] know and the peace that really belonged
[1:17:54] to them if they only knew the day of
[1:17:56] their visitation he came the greatest
[1:17:58] ministry that's ever been recorded God
[1:18:01] came down into a generation and what are
[1:18:04] thee and then what the religious world
[1:18:06] say why are these people rejoicing tell
[1:18:08] them to stop and here's the people to
[1:18:10] get liberated from Doc denominationalism
[1:18:12] they get liberated from the world they
[1:18:15] begin to see who they are in him and
[1:18:17] they begin to rejoice and the church
[1:18:19] world says have nothing to do with this
[1:18:21] and he comes in for it here comes the
[1:18:22] Prince of Peace Jesus Christ Himself
[1:18:25] being revealed through a prophet
[1:18:27] amen here he comes and the people don't
[1:18:29] want it and it causes it it causes the
[1:18:35] Lord to weep behold I stand the door and
[1:18:38] knock If any man hear my voice and they
[1:18:42] open that's the speaking of this age we
[1:18:46] don't want to be we don't want to kick
[1:18:50] him out what does he see when he beholds
[1:18:53] you he beheld and he beheld a city and
[1:18:56] he wept what does he see when he beheld
[1:18:59] you the rich young ruler I'm just gonna
[1:19:02] go this way for a little bit the rich
[1:19:04] young ruler epitomizes this age he was
[1:19:08] rich and he's increased with Goods
[1:19:10] brother bran one of the last services
[1:19:12] here preaches his leadership and he's
[1:19:15] speaking to Pentecostal people people
[1:19:17] have seen the you know times
[1:19:19] interpretation miracles signs and
[1:19:21] wonders and he's speaking about divine
[1:19:24] leadership and he takes the rich young
[1:19:26] ruler and he says now he rejected the
[1:19:29] leadership of eternal life and he's
[1:19:32] telling these people don't reject the
[1:19:34] leadership of he
[1:19:35] colonel life amen even though and they
[1:19:37] and and you can hear the service is so
[1:19:39] quiet and probably no doubt they're
[1:19:41] sitting there saying what is he talking
[1:19:43] about we seek God's Spirit move we see
[1:19:45] healing we see deliverance we seal
[1:19:48] different kinds of things and he's
[1:19:49] telling them don't turn down the
[1:19:52] leadership of eternal life you must
[1:19:55] receive the leadership of eternal life
[1:19:57] which is Christ hallelujah you've got a
[1:20:00] and here's the rich generally takes a
[1:20:02] rich young ruler rich increased with
[1:20:03] Goods and he thinks and then he he
[1:20:07] rejects me but Jesus that sees in the
[1:20:09] scripture beheld him and loved him he
[1:20:12] beheld this man this young man and loved
[1:20:14] him he had qualities that he loved but
[1:20:17] he said now you see your identity that
[1:20:19] you hold so dear of your riches and your
[1:20:22] place in society oh my what do my
[1:20:25] friends think of me what does my group
[1:20:27] think of me what will my work colleagues
[1:20:29] think of me I don't care what they think
[1:20:32] of me amen
[1:20:33] who would you rather please I mean what
[1:20:37] is what is my family think of me who's
[1:20:40] going to be judging you on that day if
[1:20:43] you come up in the second resurrection
[1:20:45] remember this messages as a rapture call
[1:20:47] but we've got to think now who who were
[1:20:50] really caring about but what will this
[1:20:53] person and the rich young ruler in his
[1:20:55] mind I was looking at the painting a
[1:20:56] couple of nights ago I just begin to cry
[1:20:58] we have it at our house and Jesus is
[1:20:59] just it's just you know the picture
[1:21:02] Christ in the rich young ruler and Jesus
[1:21:05] kind of motioning like this to the poor
[1:21:06] he's looking at the rich young ruler the
[1:21:08] rich young ruler is kind of downcast
[1:21:10] like this because he's may actually made
[1:21:12] up his mind but then he just had to
[1:21:15] unfortunately he said the wrong thing he
[1:21:18] weighed it up he took he took what must
[1:21:22] I do to inherit eternal life
[1:21:24] he asked the right questions I trust you
[1:21:27] asked that question too what can I do to
[1:21:29] inherit eternal life this is what I need
[1:21:31] he knew that his synagogue and his
[1:21:34] priests couldn't give him eternal life
[1:21:35] even though he followed it to the leader
[1:21:38] and then he comes to the very fountain
[1:21:40] of eternal life he says just sell your
[1:21:43] goods give to the poor take up your
[1:21:46] cross and follow me
[1:21:48] and he goes away say it and then but
[1:21:52] brother Bram links that parable and in
[1:21:55] the rich man and Lazarus together and he
[1:21:57] said there's a certain rich man and he
[1:21:59] increased with Goods and he pulled down
[1:22:01] his bonds and built bigger barns and all
[1:22:03] these things and then finally he said to
[1:22:05] himself one night you can rest my soul
[1:22:08] all as well and that night the Lord came
[1:22:10] to him said you know your life is
[1:22:12] required of you this night and he died
[1:22:13] and he went to hell so here was a man
[1:22:17] trying to find comfort in his riches
[1:22:18] rich and increased with Goods he says
[1:22:21] now I have need of nothing I have
[1:22:22] everything that I've wanted but he was
[1:22:25] Richard Palmer's will blind and naked
[1:22:26] and he didn't know it now
[1:22:29] that is this age that man epitomizes
[1:22:33] this age we don't want to fulfill that
[1:22:35] part of the scripture amen but you've
[1:22:38] got to be willing to take what does
[1:22:40] everyone think of me peer pressure is a
[1:22:42] real thing peer pressure is a real thing
[1:22:45] not just when you're young when you're
[1:22:46] old because you get set in a certain way
[1:22:49] well this is me and this is my identity
[1:22:51] this is what I've been doing for years
[1:22:52] and you get sitting a certain way and
[1:22:54] then Jesus comes your way and then
[1:22:57] you've got a and then there's a peer
[1:22:58] pressure what will my buddies think of
[1:23:00] me we've been through so much together
[1:23:02] well Jesus is coming and telling you I'm
[1:23:05] going to be your buddy and we're going
[1:23:07] to go through a whole bunch of different
[1:23:08] things which those buddies know nothing
[1:23:10] about I mean I and I just won't leave
[1:23:13] you like they may leave you I'll never
[1:23:15] leave thee nor forsake thee hallelujah
[1:23:17] and so now you gotta weigh it up like he
[1:23:20] did and you gotta take everything Moses
[1:23:22] was another rich young man and he took
[1:23:25] being the next Pharaoh he weighed that
[1:23:27] up against leading these people into a
[1:23:29] promised land these bunch of slaves and
[1:23:31] he esteemed being being led by Christ
[1:23:34] greater riches and all that of Egypt I
[1:23:38] trust because he wanted to be identified
[1:23:41] he wanted to be identified with these
[1:23:43] bunch of slaves he wanted to be
[1:23:45] identified with a with a god and a
[1:23:47] burning bush amen he wanted to be
[1:23:49] identify with him so he says I'm gonna
[1:23:51] unite myself to him and I'm gonna
[1:23:53] forsake this throne you got to be
[1:23:56] willing to do such things they meant you
[1:23:59] can't just you can't just walk yeah
[1:24:00] there's always been
[1:24:01] approach with the gospel the way every
[1:24:04] generation has been her approach no
[1:24:05] would have had a lot of approach it's
[1:24:07] gonna rain and the Sun does yell back
[1:24:10] and ever has it's gonna rain prove it
[1:24:15] I believe it you're crazy he's a madman
[1:24:20] but faith is the substance of evidence
[1:24:22] is the evidence of things hopeful
[1:24:25] so he actually possessed the faith it
[1:24:27] was revealed to him it's gonna rain and
[1:24:29] no man could shake him no one could
[1:24:31] shake him he started building that Ark
[1:24:33] and he didn't care what everyone made
[1:24:35] fun of you think of all the websites
[1:24:37] imagine if there was a man mention if we
[1:24:39] lived in the days of Noah because it's
[1:24:40] repeated again mention all the websites
[1:24:42] he you Google's Noah
[1:24:45] first prolly 10 pages false prophet
[1:24:49] expert nor exposed YouTube channels all
[1:24:53] about how Noah's wrong but no I just
[1:24:56] said no God told me it's gonna rain
[1:24:59] prove it prove it I'll show you by how I
[1:25:02] live I'll prove it by my building I'll
[1:25:06] prove by getting my family under the
[1:25:07] syphilis I'll prove by showing them God
[1:25:10] said it's gonna rain we're going to
[1:25:12] build the sport I'm going to prove it by
[1:25:14] Highland brother grant preached works as
[1:25:16] faith Express and he brings it down into
[1:25:18] his own life having to show the what's
[1:25:20] been revealed to him of the ministry he
[1:25:22] had aim it as expressed in his life and
[1:25:25] God comes out the end of that service to
[1:25:27] confirm he's telling the truth
[1:25:29] hallelujah and he did that many times
[1:25:32] now are you willing to be there approach
[1:25:34] what have you been one of what do you be
[1:25:37] the ninth person on the ark what have
[1:25:40] you actually said no I'm gonna identify
[1:25:42] myself with this man and his ministry
[1:25:45] and what he's doing you got to be
[1:25:48] willing to amen
[1:25:52] that's the same thing Paul the Apostle
[1:25:55] Paul said to Timothy he said you are not
[1:25:59] ashamed of me don't be ashamed of me
[1:26:02] I mean the gospel or has messenger or my
[1:26:06] chain they meant there are things there
[1:26:09] there are whole groups of Christendom
[1:26:11] that actually say that Paul was the
[1:26:14] Antichrist
[1:26:15] they actually do believe it they believe
[1:26:18] he was the Antichrist and they have
[1:26:21] there they try and prove it in some way
[1:26:23] but you had to be able to bear the
[1:26:26] approach and that day of the messenger
[1:26:28] and everything that was said against him
[1:26:32] so here's a man he's a convicted felon
[1:26:35] he's been in jail he stirs up trouble
[1:26:38] wherever he goes
[1:26:40] that's I believe he that this been
[1:26:43] saying gospel has been given to that man
[1:26:45] that man he's only got one coat loose
[1:26:48] got this affliction in his flesh and he
[1:26:50] can't see sometimes in all these
[1:26:51] problems
[1:26:52] he's the messenger from God you had to
[1:26:56] be the reproach and God is the same in
[1:26:58] every generation I mean just like if
[1:27:01] you're living in Germany there's Martin
[1:27:02] Luther you'd say I believe this man is
[1:27:05] preaching the truth and I've come out of
[1:27:07] Catholicism what this this high-tempered
[1:27:10] German monk used to be a monk he's just
[1:27:12] got an axe to grind against the Catholic
[1:27:14] Church I believe it's him
[1:27:16] I believe the just shall live by faith
[1:27:18] what this guy at least dad look he got
[1:27:20] caught up at although I believe that's
[1:27:22] him
[1:27:22] John Weasley the same thing I mean bring
[1:27:25] it down on her the same thing in this
[1:27:27] hour I mean with this messenger I mean
[1:27:30] with this prophet that we've received I
[1:27:31] mean everything this you you got to be
[1:27:34] there approach because what does it
[1:27:36] produce
[1:27:37] it doesn't jesus said he said search the
[1:27:40] scriptures and actually in the Bible
[1:27:41] says ye search the Scriptures for they
[1:27:44] are they are the way to eternal life and
[1:27:47] they are they which testify in them you
[1:27:49] think you have eternal life they are
[1:27:51] they that testify of me he says ye
[1:27:53] searched them but they testify of me and
[1:27:57] they were looking at him saying this
[1:27:59] man's Beelzebub Alleluia but the
[1:28:03] disciples that they said I'm going to be
[1:28:04] identified with this man he died you
[1:28:08] know no doubt they would have testimony
[1:28:10] services what did he do he raised the
[1:28:13] dead and healed the sick and calmed the
[1:28:14] storm and cursed the fig tree and all
[1:28:16] those things well how did he die he died
[1:28:19] on a cross oh so you mean the government
[1:28:24] didn't like what he said
[1:28:27] the the churches didn't receive him and
[1:28:29] he died the worst punishment that could
[1:28:32] be that yo that could happen yeah hmm
[1:28:35] that's a bit funny people ice had a
[1:28:39] brother Brown died a car accident hmm
[1:28:41] they just don't understand the scripture
[1:28:44] but you had to be there approach you
[1:28:46] following what I'm trying to say you got
[1:28:49] to be there approach because there's
[1:28:51] something more there's something more
[1:28:54] than just a prophet's ministry that's he
[1:28:57] uniting where he would take a vessel
[1:29:00] speak through that vessel hey well Peter
[1:29:03] was Peter winter Cornelius this house
[1:29:05] this is not crazy Peter goes to pour
[1:29:06] nearly I mean Cornelius house he
[1:29:08] preaches the Gentiles and while yet
[1:29:10] Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:29:12] fell upon them they're sealed into the
[1:29:13] kingdom they men said Jesus came and
[1:29:16] dwelt in those Gentiles and it's the
[1:29:19] same thing at the end now amen they got
[1:29:23] United for Zions sake I will not hold my
[1:29:27] peace and for Jerusalem's sake I'll not
[1:29:29] rest until righteousness thereof go
[1:29:31] forth as brightness and salvation
[1:29:33] thereof as a lamp that burners amen and
[1:29:36] the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness
[1:29:38] and all the kings like glory and thou
[1:29:41] shalt be called by a new name amen I'll

[1:37:55] shows him the son does likewise that's
[1:37:57] John 5:19 I mean so he says now this
[1:37:59] harmony is said now exists between the
[1:38:01] groom and his bride he shows her his
[1:38:04] word of life she receives it she never
[1:38:06] doubts it therefore nothing can harm oh

[1:38:35] rise it up again here is a secret of
[1:38:37] this the word is in the bride as it
[1:38:40] wasn't Mary the bride has the mind of
[1:38:42] Christ for she knows what he does
[1:38:45] once done with his word amen she
[1:38:48] performs the commandment of the Lord in
[1:38:50] his name for she has thus saith the Lord
[1:38:52] because we have the true interpretation
[1:38:54] of the scripture I mean then the word is
[1:38:57] quickened by the Spirit and it comes to
[1:38:59] pass amen I trust you've seen that in
[1:39:02] your own life amen it comes in and got
[1:39:04] quickens and you see it manifested

[1:39:11] that is planted and watered it comes to
[1:39:13] full harvest serving its purpose
[1:39:15] those in the bride do only his will amen
[1:39:20] no one can make him do otherwise they
[1:39:23] have thus saith the Lord or they keep
[1:39:24] still they know it has to be God and
[1:39:27] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:39:29] word he did not complete all his work
[1:39:31] well in his earthly ministry so now he
[1:39:34] works in and through the bride she knows
[1:39:36] that for it was not yet time for him to
[1:39:39] do certain things that he must now do
[1:39:41] but he will fulfill he will now fulfill
[1:39:44] through the bride that work which he
[1:39:46] left for the specific time he didn't
[1:39:49] come to New Zealand and his earthly
[1:39:50] journey he didn't go to South Africa
[1:39:53] there's a lot of places he didn't go but
[1:39:56] he goes in his bride to finish his work
[1:39:58] hallelujah mmm buddy says they do not
[1:40:02] have their own will I'm glad that's the
[1:40:05] case I'm glad we don't have our own
[1:40:08] world when Jesus came to the greatest
[1:40:10] the greatest victory he had wasn't guess
[1:40:12] M&E where he laid down his own will
[1:40:15] he said not my will he wasn't rejoiced I
[1:40:18] think I said it last Sunday he wasn't
[1:40:19] rejoicing now I'm going to go to the
[1:40:21] cross now I'm going to die cute humanly
[1:40:24] he wasn't rejoicing because he knew the
[1:40:26] agony he knew the painting knew the
[1:40:28] sorrow he knew the rejection that he had
[1:40:30] to experience so he wasn't rejoicing in
[1:40:32] that way and it's the same thing with us
[1:40:35] many times we we come to agus M&E you
[1:40:38] have to have your own guests M&E where
[1:40:40] you lay aside your own will and what you
[1:40:43] think about everything everything and
[1:40:46] say not my will but thy will be done
[1:40:48] amen you have to come to that point
[1:40:51] hallelujah now this is from a song
[1:40:58] Hosanna
[1:41:00] it says break my heart for what breaks
[1:41:03] yours everything I am for your kingdom
[1:41:07] cause as I go from nothing to Eternity
[1:41:09] now I put this in Google Translate so I
[1:41:12] don't know if it's exactly right but
[1:41:13] break my heart for what breaks yours
[1:41:18] this should be very true whatever breaks
[1:41:23] his heart because if we're one we have
[1:41:26] the same mind we have the same motive
[1:41:28] and objective with the same heart amen
[1:41:32] so what whatever breaks his heart should
[1:41:35] break yours whatever hurts him should
[1:41:38] hurt you
[1:41:39] amen that's what it must because if his
[1:41:43] spirit is on you brother om says
[1:41:45] he said if Beethoven's and me I'll write
[1:41:49] music if Michelangelo if the spirit of
[1:41:51] Michelangelo is in me I'll paint great
[1:41:53] masterpieces if the spirit of John
[1:41:55] Dillinger's and me I'll shoot guns and
[1:41:57] south he says if I have the Spirit of
[1:41:59] Christ in me then I will do the works of
[1:42:01] Jesus Christ and he says not two people
[1:42:04] could live in the same place one has to
[1:42:06] be dead in order for the second one to
[1:42:08] come in images is no longer me living

[1:42:20] amen and we understand in reality this
[1:42:23] is not necessarily just what the world
[1:42:27] does what really broke the heart of
[1:42:29] Jesus Christ
[1:42:30] it was what the religious people were
[1:42:32] doing it's what the church was doing he
[1:42:35] came to his own but his own received him
[1:42:37] not but as many as received him gave he
[1:42:41] power to become the sons of God even
[1:42:43] those that call on his name that's what
[1:42:46] broke because he came here was he was
[1:42:48] the Lamb he was the very God that gave
[1:42:50] the law and Mount Sinai
[1:42:52] now became flesh I mean to lose the
[1:42:54] people from that law having to put a

[1:47:54] Vatican my my my focus is not on world

[1:48:00] because when his bride counts to
[1:48:02] maturity they all come in I mean then
[1:48:04] the rapture will go
[1:48:05] I mean his focus is like I've seen about
[1:48:08] Abraham 25 years of Abraham's life these
[1:48:11] nations rise nations fall civilizations
[1:48:14] are founded new land is discovered all
[1:48:17] different things are happening in the
[1:48:18] world it's not in the scripture it's not
[1:48:21] in the scripture why is it not in the
[1:48:23] script
[1:48:23] it's not important to God goddess
[1:48:25] Abraham come out Kolia come to a new
[1:48:28] land and then he takes his son by the
[1:48:30] hand that's what's important to God amen
[1:48:44] and it's the same thing today
[1:48:45] here he is calls you finds you
[1:48:48] gathers you to himself he knows all the
[1:48:51] stuff must happen he says he puts it in
[1:48:53] their hearts to do his will see
[1:48:56] everything you see in the world is
[1:48:57] actually God putting in their hearts
[1:48:59] he's doing his will
[1:49:00] nothing's out of cater the devil there's
[1:49:02] nothing over our God all his prophecy is
[1:49:05] turning sure a man is totally in step
[1:49:08] with his timepiece he knows exactly
[1:49:10] where down to the picosecond what's
[1:49:13] going to happen hallelujah he's not
[1:49:15] getting anxious and worried he sees his
[1:49:18] word being fulfilled and that's what his
[1:49:21] focus is upon his bride upon as he lik
[1:49:23] lady his focus is upon you hallelujah
[1:49:28] now this is from first Corinthians 13
[1:49:33] charity we know is divine love
[1:49:36] it's suffereth long now this is more
[1:49:40] than nice scriptures that people may
[1:49:42] speak about it a wedding this is to be
[1:49:45] manifested in a people Amen because our
[1:49:48] Lord Jesus is a person he's a reality
[1:49:51] he's not an idea he's not a nice thing
[1:49:54] he's a person and if he comes into you
[1:49:57] then he'll manifest these things charity
[1:50:01] suffereth long and is kind charity
[1:50:04] envieth not charity vaunteth not itself
[1:50:07] is not puffed up does not behave itself
[1:50:10] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[1:50:13] easily provoked now when I'm reading
[1:50:16] this I trust you and go back in your
[1:50:17] life and say I've seen this and we
[1:50:22] understand that if the Holy Spirit is in
[1:50:24] you then you'll believe every word
[1:50:26] because he cannot deny Zone word I mean
[1:50:30] if his spirit of the earth spirit of the
[1:50:31] author is in you you'll say Amen
[1:50:34] and even if you say I cannot obtain two
[1:50:36] that you'll say Lord caused me to become
[1:50:38] that and you will become a member you're
[1:50:41] not that he cannot deny his own word he
[1:50:44] cannot you cannot say that's just a
[1:50:45] man's opinion that's just the Apostle
[1:50:47] Paul's your opinion the Apostle Paul
[1:50:49] writes if any man is spiritual among you
[1:50:51] let him acknowledge what I read to you
[1:50:53] as the commandments of the Lord amen
[1:50:58] rejoice is not an iniquity this is why
[1:51:02] this should be in you thinketh no evil
[1:51:05] rejoice is not iniquity but rejoices in
[1:51:08] truth beareth all things believeth all
[1:51:11] things hopeth all things endureth all
[1:51:14] things
[1:51:15] hallelujah I trust you say that's me
[1:51:22] that's to be in the bride now what is he
[1:51:30] I'm gonna wrap this up cuz I've kept you
[1:51:34] when he beheld you I choked that member
[1:51:38] we've come up into a rapture season this
[1:51:41] may be the last if we're here until
[1:51:43] Christmas I always think about Christmas
[1:51:45] Christmas is such a big calendar time
[1:51:47] for Christians and they have their
[1:51:49] manger and I think about his first
[1:51:51] coming at least several things Jesus has
[1:51:55] come again the second time he's walking
[1:51:57] upon the earth and just like in the
[1:52:00] first time they missed him and they
[1:52:02] didn't want him and they rejected him
[1:52:04] and he wept because if they only knew
[1:52:07] what belonged to their peace if they
[1:52:09] only knew and what now is but they
[1:52:13] didn't know but here we are coming into
[1:52:16] another Christmas season and I trust
[1:52:19] when you when you approach the season
[1:52:22] you've got to think now you came the
[1:52:25] first time you weren't born in December
[1:52:27] this is when we celebrated you came the
[1:52:30] first time the world just turned you
[1:52:31] down
[1:52:32] very few received them and now here I am
[1:52:35] seven billion people upon the earth but
[1:52:38] there's something in me that's caused me
[1:52:40] to receive you in this season and the
[1:52:43] world will you know the rapture will go
[1:52:45] and no one will really know we've gone
[1:52:48] it'll just come you think about Jesus
[1:52:50] coming upon the earth the first time
[1:52:51] hundreds of prophecies being fulfilled
[1:52:53] the word becoming manifested God's God
[1:52:57] became flesh and dwelt among us
[1:53:00] incredible things happened but just
[1:53:03] passed through and it was done and it
[1:53:07] was gone and here we are in a second
[1:53:13] coming in the days of Sodom and and and
[1:53:16] Noah that shall be when the Son of Man
[1:53:18] is revealed and the same son of man was
[1:53:21] revealed through a prophet and it came
[1:53:24] and it fulfilled Scripture and the
[1:53:26] things he said is still being manifested
[1:53:28] upon the earth and as bright as be the
[1:53:31] Bride of Christ is being called and then
[1:53:32] we'll be done and she'll be taken up to
[1:53:35] the wedding supper and the world will go
[1:53:38] on now I say all that because we don't
[1:53:43] want to let it pass us by you say well
[1:53:46] if I meant to be there I'll be there I'm
[1:53:48] not I'm not no don't say that you and I
[1:53:51] say Lord this is my season I want
[1:53:54] another day of my visitation I don't
[1:53:56] want to take it haphazardly I don't want
[1:53:58] to take it casually I mean we have one
[1:54:00] life to live
[1:54:01] amen and here's walking he is passing
[1:54:03] this way just like he went through
[1:54:06] Jericho amen and Zacchaeus went up in a
[1:54:09] tree he saw him in the tree
[1:54:11] amen he's come to this hole in the
[1:54:13] ground here amen any and he knows you're
[1:54:16] here

[1:54:20] trusted something in you says Lord I

[1:54:24] me may you not see my pain and my hurt
[1:54:28] and my sorrow I have you but see
