there is no unlike you lord jesus lord god as each day goes by father we we realize more and more how great you are often often time lord god we we fail to realize how great you are nor we can only appreciate that by you being more personal to us by us lord falling deeper in love with you becoming more conscious of your presence that special personal protection that you place around our lives lord god we need to be more aware of that father because lord god with that sensitivity that level of consciousness father lord the love that it creates in our hearts father takes care of all our problems takes care of all our insecurities and complexes lord the besetting sins things that we can't seem to shake lord the solution is just lord for you to be more real to us to know your presence is right next to us lord god father we ask for more events closer walk with you lord deeper consecration lord that you would be more than just a sunday service more than something we read of in the bible or hear your prophets speak about lord god that we would meet you like jacob met you like your prophet mitch my father well that's that's how we are all to meet you from the eldest to the youngest from the maturest one here to the babe in christ lord we all need to meet you we ask lord god in this dark hour that we are living in in this closing hour of time where every trace of light is being stamped out the devil is trying his hardest to stamp out the light the lord god you could look on the earth like you did before the flood and as noah found grace in your sight lord these people at shekinah tabernacle would find grace in your sight the saints in taranaki would find grace in your sight in this dark hour lord jesus that lord god as you revealed your mind your will to noah lord you would come personally to us reveal your thoughts to us lord we would appreciate how much you love us father lord we know you love us but make it very real in our hearts that love that you have toward us and lord god ignite our love toward you that's what we need lord jesus it's a love relationship that's what revelation is closeness with you like your prophet said lord he says i may not know the book very well but i know the author very very well that's what we want lorne we're not we may not be able to explain all things but we want to know in our hearts that we have met you father we thank you for the worship lord god we ask your blessing upon the preaching of the wind lord i'm i'm flesh and blood and i have a lord recovering from a cold and i need you to protect and preserve my voice and i ask that you would do that and i pray lord that each one would be attentive this morning the things that you have for us may we be greatly blessed questions answered lives given direction lord may you be glorified in this service we pray in jesus name amen amen and amen praise the lord god bless you everybody thank you all musicians you all know who i am most of you do so i don't need to introduce myself you may ask where brother ben is and why he's not up the front he said i'm part of the furniture he said just come up so i'm here and what brought me this way was the premiere that brother isaac and his crew had been preparing for some time it's very unusual to see the church at the movies there's some great talent and god bless you brother isaac for the work that you're pointing in and the burden that the lord has given you and if the lord wills it to make the big film one day then wouldn't it be wonderful that was the last great feature film that was ever made on the prophet of god the time will tell so may lord bless you in your efforts god bless you everybody and we see some from taranaki michael and and margaret's moved this way and of course murray and moved and i mean it's just shocking terrible but i i know many of you and your yeah it's a good yes a sign i would come to this church if this church was in wellington not that there's anything wrong with our church but this is a nice group of people and and the lord is blessed you are the good past and good ministry and musicians and just everybody here you're very nice group and i pray that the lord would bless us all this morning um thank you brother ben for asking me to preach i don't go anywhere to preach i don't announce my coming i just turn up but if the lord lays on his heart to ask me and if he asks me i don't advertise myself then yes i'll take the meeting so we want to go into the scripture this morning and read from revelation chapter 15 verse 5 to verse 8 of revelation chapter 15. i bring you greetings from my parents back home they asked me to extend their greetings to you all i i mentioned the brother already this morning that i'm here so he hasn't asked me to relay greetings so i'm not going to pretend that he did [Laughter] anyways revelation 15 verse 5 to verse 8. john recording this book we know this is the revelation of jesus christ not the revelation of saint john but the revelation of jesus christ and after that i john looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was open and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts garden with golden girdles and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels this is one of the cherubim now and this cherubim is the eagle gave unto the seven angels seven golden veils full of the wrath of god so that means we had a very specific time in history now where the wrath of god is to be poured out who liveth forever and ever he's an eternal god without beginning without ending he is melchizedek and when these vials were going to be poured out the bible says in verse 8 this is our key scripture this morning and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no man watch this no man was able to enter into the temple there's there's no more ministry being able to be carried out until the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled very serious scripture let's pray one more time lord god take the scripture father in this late hour of uncertainty of chaos and confusion in the world and lord bring stability to our thinking bring stability to our hearts and lord god we would see how you are relating to us in an hour such as this we need not be afraid nor concerned but we can sing lord as we sung thank god i am free because of your blood in this hour where mercy is phasing out and judgment is being ushered into its fullness lord make this clear to all of us i pray help me lord to be as clear and concise as i can be and lord god we would cross examine our hearts take inventory of our lives seek our salvation with fear and trembling because it's a late hour and lord god time is short and like those wise virgins father we want to be ready so the lord when we are caught away we are caught away as that ready bride having the spirit on the word that we have received in our day we ask these things in your name amen amen god bless you may and take your seats this morning and for a subject i want to i want to speak on something that really was impressed on my heart to look into around the time that covert uh settled in last year now this worldwide pandemic was was something where everybody had a scripture everybody had a quotation about it everybody had a theory behind it but i believe that when events of this magnitude are taking place that there is a scriptural answer the answer is in the scripture the answer is in the message of the hour and even though you may not have all things revealed to you that does not mean there is no answer but that god has a season and a time to reveal to you personally what he wants to make known in the time that he has chosen and i'm sure that all of us can vouch for the fact that that there are times where you pray to the lord about something that you are wondering about in the word and you pray and you and you get out your sledgehammer and you begin to smash away at the scriptures and the quotes to make them fit your theory of what you think this thing means in the word but the best thing to do with any scriptural question is to put your sledgehammer away and say lord show me in your time what this means in the word and forget about it just forget about it one day maybe months later years later the ministry will come perhaps and say one thing that strikes a chord and in simplicity the answer is given maybe one day you'll have interactions with somebody out there on the street a heathen who will say one thing do one thing that settles the answer that you're looking for and if you have that attitude then you'll be a teachable son and daughter of god you will not be slanted in your understanding you will not be trying to push an agenda you're not a prophet like our prophet was we're not seers we're all reading the same message reading the same bible but we need the same god to give us his interpretation of the word not ours and so with this event that was really ushered in last year and has continued right up to now a thought that really came to me was from revelation 15. and i want to speak this morning on when the sanctuary becomes smoky when the sanctuary becomes smoky and i know that you are a very well taught church and you have very good ministers in this church and i'm comfortable to preach this in your church because you're trained in the word and this is not something that i would preach to beginners but if we are seasoned in the word then i believe that you will have the understanding to follow what is happening in the scripture because this scripture is for right now and i would again say go back home afterwards read these scriptures pray about these things the ministers elaborate on these things because it's a late hour and you need to be conscious of the time that you're living in for many still in the ranks of the message these things are only concepts in their mind of what god is doing but the word needs to come deep down into the heart so by god's grace as we look at this thoughts i pray that the lord would bless you he would sober you and that you would be more zealous and fervent in this finishing hour that we are living in when the sanctuary becomes smoky praise the lord i want to open with a quotation of our prophet the first seal of 1963 this is the only quotation i'm going to read i'm not a big quote reader i just read one quote to set the scene and then we'll hit our thought the prophet said in the first seal he said here is the plan of it here's the great plan of god the first thing happens is that there is an announcement in the heavens first what happened a seal is open first thing a seal opens what is that he said a mystery is unfolded because when the seal is broken the mystery that was contained hidden by the seal is now able to be made known a mystery is unfolded and when a mystery unfolds a trumpet sounds because the trumpet in the bible is a disturbance a political disturbance a natural disturbance but it disturbs it he says and it declares a war and then he says and a church age is open and so forth he says what is the war part what is the war part he says the angel of the church catches the mystery of god not fully yet revealed that's why you need a prophet right if there's no william branham there's no mystery revealed he catches the mystery of god not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of god and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him he goes forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war in other words this message is going to cause people to react to either before it or against it but it will cause a reaction because that's what the trumpet does it declares a war don't be surprised don't don't question how the greatest message 2000 years could cause such a reaction because that's what war is a conflict of two sites and then god takes his messenger with the elect of that age and he lays them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon them who rejected it a temporary judgment listen to the last part again after he has declared his mystery the the church age messenger god then takes the messenger off the scene and the elect who was sealed under that message all go off the scene as they did for seven church ages then god at the end of each age drops a plague on the age on the people who rejecting the message of the prophets the plague only comes because the prophet his message is rejected remember when the people rejected samuel samuel got a complex because they would not listen to him and the lord says he says it's okay he says they have not rejected you samuel they rejected me so when when our prophet is being put in the crosshairs and gunned at by all kinds of people it's god that they are against and so god now in the last days is going to pour out not just a plague but seven plagues seven vials on the last age for rejecting not a portion of the word the fullness of the word you think for seven ages it was part word part word so a plague would fall a plague not all the plagues a plague would fall but when you have the fullness of the word you get seven plagues for rejecting it seven vales with the roth of god poured out on those who shun what you are here receiving this morning remember to sit in the church doesn't make you bright it makes you a church goa because in matthew 25 was a parable of virgins they were wise and foolish and the difference between wise and foolish was that the wise had the spirit with the word but the foolish had the word without the spirit that's the difference that's all it is one has the word with the spirit the other has the word without the spirit so they are equally versed in the word in this quote the prophet is saying that the order of events is that a church age begins the ephesian age opened a seal opened for that age a mystery that was contained under that seal was revealed by the messenger of the age and his message was a sounding of a trumpet revelation 10 verse 7 says when the seventh angel sounded trumpet-sounding then when he's sounding his message there is a war in the unseen realm unseen realm war spirits that start moving into flesh causing reaction to the message either moving of the holy spirit or fallen angels demon power getting into flesh and a war started and then at the end of the age god drops a plague on the age and for seven church ages around the conclusion of each age plagues major plagues move throughout the earth now we are not looking this morning of what happened over seven church ages we are in 2021 amen where seven vials will be poured out after the bride is gone amen you're not here for that but where you're living today is in a time where mercy is being phased out that the wrath of god might come in its fullness but as mercy is coming to an end and the fullness of god's wrath is to be poured out you are seeing a blapping over a blending time where mercy and judgment are present together on the earth now watch when moses built the tabernacle when solomon built the temple all of that was a shadow of the temple in heaven because in revelation 20 john said he was seeing the temple in heaven he saw the ark of god in heaven he sees an angel offering incense from a censer in heaven these are all temple things if you don't understand the temple how the services were carried out you will never fully understand the book of revelation because that's the heavenly temple so when when moses built the tabernacle when solomon built the temple they were only building in material form what was first seen in heaven what was first seen in heaven when when enoch built the pyramid he's building it after the pattern of the stars that's in the second heaven but where god is is the third heaven amen our prophets he was liking noctu he was building a people amen when moses built the tabernacle he's building it after the pattern god showed him in the mountain mount sinai our prophet in the last days did not build a pyramid of stone he built a pyramid in flesh but the pattern he's building it after for him to build a church a super church in the last days the only way he can do that is to be lifted up into heaven and see the reality right in order to know how to build it on the earth so in 1960 the prophet is taken beyond the curtain of time where he sees your eternal representation he sees your theophany body he sees the pattern and then when his when his spirit comes back into the flesh body he's preaching the word to form a church into the image of the word representation he saw of you when he went beyond the curtain of time so the last day moses is building in flesh like what moses built in material form as a tabernacle we understand praise the lord so these things were only a shadow of eternity a shadow of heaven praise the lord now how was john able to see all these things because his spirit was caught up amen and for you to understand the economy of god you need your spirit to be lifted up into a higher realm beyond this realm where all the influences are trying to keep you earth bound to take you beyond that that you would understand god's thinking then you'll know how to move then you'll be like a laser-guided missile because jesus didn't go about praying for everybody jesus didn't go about healing everybody he did only what the father showed him he went to the pool of bethesda many were sick and afflicted he goes to one that's the one the spirit unction him to speak to and when you are more in tune with god you are you are dealing with specific needs by the leadership of the holy ghost and everybody else will misunderstand you and be highly offended by it because you are conscious of the leadership of god doing only what he wants you to do saying what only he wants you to say amen you're not trying to please all the others that are around you amen you want to live pleasing only him the lord jesus christ god him god himself so in our scripture in revelation 15 verse 5 we saw that john says the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was open how can the word be shut was open and john is the bride isn't he when john said it was open now if you're rising up in these last days saying the word is not open that's not a good pattern of john because john said i was caught up by the holy ghost the word was truly open and i tell you if the word's not open you've not been quickened by the holy ghost yet now watch when did the temple open well when it says it was open it's already past tense it was opened not it was open when i saw it it was at that time revelation 15 it was already open when did it open when you turned to revelation 11 under the seventh trumpet under the seventh trumpet the bible says there was a great voice saying the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our lord and of is christ and at the last verse of revelation 11 under the seventh trumpet the bible says the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened under what the seventh trumpet what's the seventh trumpet brother branham said our seven seals is israel's seven trumpets so if the bible says in revelation 11 that for the jews under the seventh trumpet the word is opened then if that is a shadow of our seventh seal what is the seventh seal the word opening up heaven the word opening of heaven so when you read revelation 8 1 it says there was silence in heaven the space of half an hour when you read revelation 10 verse 1 an angel descended it doesn't say anything about anything being open does it and the next verse of revelation 10 or verse 3 has an open book in his hand but if you want more detail just read the seventh trumpet because the seventh trumpet is the same as our seventh seal and it says under the seventh trumpet revelation 11 the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened praise the lord and the seventh trumpet is for the jews elected jews 144 000 are going to hear the opening of the word if they're going to hear it you've got to hear it first so the seventh seal is not open yet that can mean nothing to the jews until it's been opened to you i know on an age level the word is open because our prophet preached to an age but the same angel that came to the prophet is the same angel who must make personal visitation to you to open up the word so that you can say the word is open amen otherwise you're in church hearing me preach this morning and it sounds good and you can scribble notes but it's not actually open to you because you're still living in fear and bondage and privilege amen now when jesus died on calvary 2000 years ago his death rent the veil of the temple that's what the bible says and he said it is finished behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from top to bottom god rent the veil and that veil what did it shield off the holy of holies right remember there were two veils but this fail was the veil between the holy place and the holy of holies and when jesus died that barrier between the holy place and the holy of holies was done away with meaning that you can now look into into the very throne room of god because the holy of holies and the temple as a physical structure was only a shadow of the presence of god almighty in heaven and only the high priest could look into the holy of holies but if there's no more veil more than one can look in now think about this when adam and eve before they fell they were in the garden of eden the garden of eden was a type of the holy of holies is that right because in the garden of eden was the tree of life the tree of life was the ark of the covenant and the tree of life was god god himself and theophany form in the garden having fellowship now when adam and eve fell the bible says in verse 24 of genesis 3 that god put cherubim at the gate to the garden of eden lion ox man and eagle preventing god's son and daughter from having access to god's presence right now lion ox man and eagle and they were the barrier between eden and the garden so when god said to moses moses build me a tabernacle he then describes how the tabernacle is to be made and he says and make a veil and stitch stitch into the veil cherubim right exodus 25 stitch into the veil cherubim lion ox man and eagle were stitched into the veil embroidered into the veil right so nobody else but the high priest on the day of atonement could pass through that barrier once a year to cleanse the sin of the of of israel only once a year but apart from that one time which was a day of atonement once a year he could never go beyond the barrier so the lion oxman and eagle prevented man from having access to the throne room of god but when jesus died what does the bible say the veil that had the lion ox man and eagle stitched into it was torn so those cherubim that were preventing access to god's presence will move the sign and jesus could pass through and those that he died for could pass through the veil how can the word be shut how can the word be shut how can the temple in heaven be closed to god's sons and daughters praise the lord and what jesus accomplished on calvary in the physical realm was only a reflection of what god was doing in eternity praise the lord you know we would not know these things if there was no profit we would be hearing a feel-good message this morning pay your tithe say nice things to one another shake hands keep your grudges to yourself that will not put you in a rapture a man will make you a good christian but you're not going in a rapture a man bad tempered peter is going in a rapture man short fused paul was going in a rapture because god is looking at the gene not not at your ability to conceal your flaws god is looking at the gene amen because until until you're changed and the atoms you're going to have problems some of you i'm going to have trouble with and likewise you toward me because we're flesh amen we understand that we can take courage can we so revelation 15 when you look at verse 5 and 6 john says in verse 5 and verse 6 of revelation 15 says i looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was open but when was it opened two thousand years ago for seven church ages a messenger for each age would catch the mystery of god and declare the mystery so the word has been opened more and more and more over 2000 years till in the last days the word is completely open and you sing that song here the word is open sin is broken there's nothing holding me anymore because the word is open for the gentiles the jews were blinded so that god could get himself a gentile wife but when the last of you is sealed when the last of you is sealed there's no more need for the blood for gentiles anymore and then this mystery that we have had the opportunity to hear and receive now will go to the jews via two prophets amen by our two prophets our prophet had the ministry of moses elijah and jesus christ and one man but in revelation 11 you've got two prophets one with the ministry of moses one with the ministry of elijah both revealing jesus christ preaching to a nation and of the nation the elected ones 144 000 receive it and are sealed now think about this think about this those jews if you understand how god will deal with the jews you understand how god's dealing today that those jews are a nation and god says in the word revelation 7 144 000 will be sealed and there are 12 000 from every tribe now since 1948 all these jews have been coming back to the land and none of them know what trade they're from none of them know there were two captivities israel went into captivity judah went into captivity and those from the israel captivity when the assyrians came in but they're known as the lost tribes yet all these jews are coming back and of those jews some of them are from the historic captivity of israel and they don't know what tribe they're from so god has two prophets in revelation 11 who are preaching jesus but those two prophets have to have discernment to know what tribe everybody is from amen because in in daniel chapter 12 when michael comes down who is jesus christ he is delivering the names written in the book but he has to know who you are to call your name amen and and for israel he has to know what tribe they're from so in our day we had a prophet and we saw that at the end of many meetings the people would stand on the platform next to the prophet and the angel of the lord through the prophet would say you are mrs so and so and you live at this address and this is your problem go in the name of jesus christ you're now healed praise the lord but you know what that was the discernment of the book of life flesh life natural life and people say and they say when brother branham was doing the discernment line that was when the lord was truly speaking through him that's when he was genuine but during the preaching it is a bit like that no the end of the meeting when the people came out that was the discernment of the book of life flesh life but during the preaching he is discerning the lamb section during the preaching he's saying you are bright you are eternal your dwelling place is heaven amen you are the queen and this is your destiny and you don't have to accept your sickness and affliction he's discerning the the lamb section that's the important part but nobody wants to know about the important part they just focusing on well your name is mrs smith and you live at such and such a street in new york and this that but that's the natural section showing what he was doing during all the preaching and brother banham said the same holy spirit that is speaking now through the discernment is the same holy spirit's been preaching the last hour with all his stuttering and all the times he got his phrasing back to front the same holy spirit was speaking so these two prophets will reveal jesus to the jews and of them 144 000 will be sealed and in this day we have thousands in the ranks of the message a message has gone forth and of the masses a specific number are being sealed praise the lord and you want to know that you are one of them being sealed we don't come to church to walk out feeling unsure and condemned hearing the minister called me a buzzard no we come here to walk out saying i am brain i am brian we don't preach uncertainty you are bright amen these seven angels we read of in revelation 15 they come out of the temple in heaven and they are bearing the vials of god's wrath so where is the judgment coming from from god himself do you think god has been blindsided by a pandemic it's caught god by surprise volcanoes are erupting with greater frequency than ever before there's been an acceleration of earthquakes in ever before that man is degenerating faster you think that's caught god by surprise this morning or is it that this has come from his throne room to to to do what to fulfill his word to fulfill his word they have been sent by god these angels these seven angels are seven church age messengers and one of those angels is your prophets your prophets whose books you often let collect dust and cobwebs on the shelf he's one of the angels they are going forth with a message of mercy and judgment dependent on your attitude to the word all dependent on your attitude to the word and let me tell you young people regardless of where you are old even as well if you don't enjoy the things of god just tell the lord i tell the lord i told the lies lord reading the bible is boring i replace the bible i get confused lord but make it enjoyable i love you lord but sometimes very tedious to read your word i don't understand all the these and the vowels and the baguettes and and i and and the wording is so confusing but make it plain if you find listening to the prophet is boring if you find the ministry here is boring tell the lord he already knows he already knows god likes a good honest heart and i was telling ben last night what the lord liked about david he was a very good repenter very good repenter and when when when saul had disobeyed the lord god said to saul via samuel i have chosen me a man after mine own heart well god by his foreknowledge knew all the mistakes that david would make and before david had even made a mistake that's recorded in scripture god said he's a man after my heart it's it's it's stated before the fact not afterwards amen so before you came to flesh god knew all the mistakes that you would make but while you were an eternity sin you are a son after my own heart you are a daughter after my own heart why because when you make when you go wrong and the preaching of the word identifies the error you can say lord i'm sorry take that out of me i can't fix this i can't address this but you can and the lord likes that honesty and that honesty can only come from the gene of himself in your soul for you to say that amen because the prophet said the evidence of the holy ghost is that you can receive receive the word accept it lord i can't live it i can't line up with it i but i know it's the truth and lord i need you to make it real because i can't live it i burn out after 10 minutes but you make it live that's the attitude god likes in his sons and his daughters that's why he says and i love this son i love that door look at them make a mistake again man i love them just did the same thing that they were told not to do this wrath of god is coming from heaven and these angels we read of they are gert as jesus was girts in revelation 1 dressed as jesus is dressed in revelation 1 and the prophet said see he's the judge he's a supreme judge and when you see these seven angels coming forth they dressed just as jesus is dressed in revelation 1 verse 13 they are dressed to judge my dress to judge a message of mercy and judgment jesus is the high priest and supreme judge and each messenger was a priest of the age and he would bring down the wrath of god to the age all dependent on your response to the word for your day and these angels here are carrying a vile vile speaks of judgment in the bible you know when when saul was anointed as king he was anointed with a vile but when david was anointed as king he was anointed with a horn of oil showing god's perfect will for him to rule his people israel but upon saul came the judgment of god and yet saul was elect saul made it the prophet sin he just wasn't supposed to be king as in the permissive will of god to reign to hone david's character that's all to make him the fit king that's why he was there amen and and your boss is there not not maybe to be bribed but to hone your character to make you fit to rule amen now where we are living today we are coming to the end of mercy mercy is not over don't think that this morning don't think that mercy is finished mercy is still present because you're here where the word is in the bride is where mercy is which is the blood for the age so mercy is still here but where we are today in 2021 is that the time is running out time is short and we will soon be taken away amen we are not waiting for the coming of the lord the lord has come in word form but what we are waiting for is the catching away of the coming brother eugene brown said he says the the rapture is just for you to change dimensions to go to the wedding supper just to it's just to transport you that's all it's for it's to transport her that's already married you're not going there to be married you're married here but you have to be transported via the body change to go to the marriage supper that's all it's for but if you're not married here as much as you're looking forward to raps you're not going in it the bridesmaids are not going in it foolish virgins are not going in it only she who is married now by the celebrant of the prophets is going praise the lord and we are looking forward to the catching away of his coming and that's where we are coming to right now and when you go the blood leaves the earth for the gentiles no more mercy no more mercy and when god is announcing changing of dispensation in the bible there's an earthquake when you look at the book of revelation there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake when the law was given on mount sinai there was an earthquake in the days of noah the bible said the foundations of the earth were broken amen an earthquake when jesus died on calvary there was an earthquake and our prophet rebuked los angeles he says you're like capernaum and you'll go beneath the sea one mile plumbed down into the sea there'll be an earthquake to finish off the gentile dispensation amen and after the ministry of the two prophets to the jews in revelation 11 there's one more earthquake revelation 16. another earthquake to finish off the ministry of two prophets to the jewish age so where we are right now is a time where a great earthquake is going to happen and when that happens millions of innocent people will lose their lives that's not that's not funny it's not something to glorify but that's the truth millions of innocent people will die and when that happens there's no more mercy and when that happens people get religious when two large towers fell everybody got very religious it doesn't matter how they fell but they fell they were there in the morning they were not there in the afternoon and everybody got very religious were burning candles going to cathedrals until everything settled down they were back into sin again right think about a pandemic and lockdowns everybody's bonding together being a real team spirit and when it's all normality is restored it's back into sinning again that's what it's like so so when this event happens it's going to be a great awakening for people there's a serious event but nobody knows the significance behind the event but the bride because she knows it's only a few days now and we're out of here but before that is a time to reach out as god has made you to intercede for those who are not in the position that you were in now is your time to do that because then it's too late and like noah you'll be standing on the bow of the boat preaching to the eternally lust because when noah went into the ark the bible says god shut the door noah didn't reach an alton and close it god shut the door and then for seven days there was a waiting time before the flood struck the wrath of god was poured out in its fullness and so in those seven days noah is standing on the ship preaching to the lost and they're still mocking him because there's no rain you think the earth that people are going to believe the world has been going to burn by fire the world is never burnt by fire in noah's day there was never a flood they couldn't understand how could how could the world be overflowed with the water it's never happened before it was a joke but it won't be a it wasn't a joke anymore right once the event had happened because they had seen it the world has never burnt by fire before it's never happened and you're standing there saying the lord is going to burn this earth with fire we're going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked and that is a joke but god is going to do it and it will not be a joke when that earthquake happens for that space of time that's the last part of that third paul ministry preaching to the eternally lost preaching to the lost the mercy seat which it is now becomes the judgment seat because you can come and kneel and cry at the altar pick up your bible pick up a message book it would be no good now is the time of salvation now is a time of salvation not tomorrow not after the meeting now is a time of salvation to walk with the lord you realize things have gone every man has to appear before god whether you are a believer or an unbeliever all stand before god and when you are raptured when the book of corinthians you stand before the judgment seat of christ not to be condemned because you are son of daughter of god but to be judged by the deeds done in the body for reward to be given amen and so that you can be shown before the bride of all ages and show unto your prophets show unto your prophets this is a man this is a daughter who heard your message think about what i'm saying right now you are going to be showed personally to jesus christ personally to the saints of all ages and to your prophet amen your life will be announced by god to all this is what my son did and and you will be rewarded based on how the holy spirit moved you in this life how you serve god in this life not not by works but by the moving of the holy ghost in your life this is not about this is not the great white throne judgment that's that's after the second resurrection that's that's for those whose names are on the book of life or not on it but for you you're in the lamb section and after your erection you stand before god to be announced before all and don't you want to be proud of how you've served them in this life not standing there man i wish i'd done more but you know the paradox of it saints is that wherever you are right now is exactly where god wants you exactly even if you're seriously messed up that's exactly where god wants you you can do nothing more and nothing less than where god wants you to be so even if you should say man i wish i'd done more but the prophet he was in his 50s he says if i'm going to do anything for the lord i need to do it now i mean the man that led millions to christ and we haven't led to people are they but yet what he had done was exactly what the lord wanted him to do and what the law wants you to do you will do but it might not feel very spiritual you might not feel very important or very anointed but it's what god raised you up for to do praise the lord amen and knowing these things serve god with all your heart you can stand boldly before him and be announced to all the saints of all the ages we are the bride saints and we are under the bleeding word of the age we are the blood of jesus christ to the age amen so when the veil was rent on calvary when jesus died paul says in hebrews chapter 10 it says brethren we have boldness boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus the blood of jesus is what the word for your day jesus says father sanctify them through thy truth what does the blood do it's the sanctifying source of the body it cleanses the body the spirit of the body is in the bloodstream and man that's why in the old days when they were bleeding people to cure disease they were killing them because the bloodstream was the carrier of the spirit of life and in the spiritual the blood is the word because it's the carrier of what the holy spirit and by the blood which is the spirit on the word you can go into the throne room of gods but if the word is not open then there's no blood which makes you unable to go into the throne room of god no unbeliever can access gods but you can because the blood was not shed for the world the blood was shed for the elect in the world and you can go boldly and not timidly not one of the lord will hear my prayer today go boldly in boldly got a problem go boldly before lord you ever need go boldly go confidently because you are his son you are his daughter he wants to hear you talking to him ideally more than you're talking to anybody else and we are not often bold to talk to the lord and present our needs we feel like we are we've asked the lord for 20 years how much more should we ask him keep asking like that woman lord avenge me of my adversary avenge me on my adversary just that that man that she had preached got so fed up he just did something about it go before the lord again and again and again until you get what you need amen so these seven angels with seven vials are our church-age messengers dressed like the lord is dressed they are dressed to judge but they are also clothed in linen because they are also part of the bride now you're the bride of jesus christ revelation 19 verse 8 says and to her the bride was granting that she should be arrayed in fine linen and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints not the righteousness of god the righteousness of saints the life that you lived for him here on the earth they are bright members like you are brother branham is not just our prophet he's our brother amen he's not just the the the leader of the age he is one of the bride he's one of you he's dressed as you addressed he just had a special ministry for you but he's one of you we know those that love him call him brother not jesus not worshiping jesus we call him brother amen now think when when this is happening in revelation 15 the temple is filled with smoke what does that mean what does that mean when god instructed moses to build a tabernacle he built the tabernacle and there was the day of ceremony and the bible says then a cloud covered the tents of the congregation and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle and moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the lawn fill the tabernacle you you can't stand in the presence of god rather than when he was caught up in the constellation of angels he was paralyzed for hours afterwards paralyzed couldn't feel his body when solomon built the temple on the day of inauguration to chronicle seven now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the house and the priests could not enter into the house of the lords because the glory of the lords hand filled the lord's house so that means now if the heavenly temple is filled with smoke no priest can go in no ministry of intercession can be carried out you understand the thought now this time that we are moving into now praise the lord and again in exodus 16 in exodus 19 where the glory of the lord came down on mount sinai and nobody could go up into the mountain to touch the mountain was death that's a very great god that we serve very great god that you serve very powerful god that we need to be more conscious of in isaiah 6 isaiah says this he says in the year that uzziah died i saw the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up his train filled the temple above him stood the seraphims and so on and so forth the whole and they were saying the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cry what does that mean an earthquake the place shook and the house was filled with smoke from his glory from his voice the voice of the lord is going forth in these last days not just what our prophet said but when brother bends up preaching andy james all the ministers in this church when they speak it's god's speaking with all their humanity all their mistakes all the things that you know about them that's still god's speaking amen and to turn that down is to bring down the wrath of god you know you may not respect the man but respect his gift respect his ministry respect his message that's the important thing and the prophet says if you can't respect your pastor god can't bless you you can't respect just one another god can't god can't bless you this smoke that filled the temple is god's presence think of that how god's presence can manifest to judge or to bring favor to bring grace the presence of god can come down and it's not always a good thing depending on how you are relating to god when he comes down you see when the bottomless pit was open in revelation 9 that's hell a dimensional world was opened when when the mighty angel came down with a book in his hand that opened up a world didn't it it opened up heaven because a book to open this book gives me access to information and the information it gives me access to is heaven which is the word in revelation 9 we've got another angel don't we he's not descending he's falling from heaven falling from heaven and in his hand is something a key what does the key do you put it in the door and you unlock the door to gain access to what is beyond the door so both angels have appeared on the earth at the same time in the last days both opening up a world one is opening up heaven by the opening of the book the other is opening up hell by the turning of the key and when hell is opened smoke came out of the pit and what was behind the smoke demons the smoke had the coming of the demons the people could not see the devils because of the smoke praise the lord so we see that the devil has smoke that he can fill the earth with a great smoke screen nobody can see the activity of devils on the earth today you know everything that you hear on the news that's broadcast in the media and the papers is a great smoke screen that's got everybody captivated but behind all that information is the moving of devils praise a lot and behind this message is the moving of another spirit and that's the holy spirit of god where is the holy ghost it's not out there it's in the message of the hour the holy ghost is on the word for your day amen amen the smoke came from the glory of god we see it can be a sign of god's favor or a sign of god's displeasure when korah nathan and abby ram and the 250 princes challenged moses the prophets they came before the tabernacle and the glory of god came down in displeasure and they were there to challenge the prophet for the age and the glory of god came down not to show that he was well pleased with these people trying to find faults with moses birth and why moses said that people fell off the bridge and they can't find evidence for it the lord the lord came down in displeasure and the bible says there was an earthquake the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up all those that murmured against moses and a plague went forth throughout the camp and aaron had to get a censor and stay the plague because the glory of god had come down not for a good reason but to execute those that would murmur against his vindicating prophet i tell you every time i hear the prophet speak i never hear a liar i do not hear a liar when the prophet speaks and the more that you spend in this message and you go on your journey in life the rich it becomes there is no way that we were deceived impossible is it totally impossible amen no priest could go in when the glory of god was present in the sanctuary showing that the smoky sanctuary in revelation 15 is ending the days of intercession after the bride is gone it's ending the day of intercession the day of mercy and you find in isaiah chapter six when the temple in heaven was filled with smoke isaiah was then sent forth to speak a message to those who had heirs and would not hear eyes that would not see and he prophesied for the devastation of the land because they rejecting his message amen amen this message that saves you noah's message that saved his family condemned the world condemn the world our profit was gun barreled straight you know he was gun barrels straight i've heard nobody else ever preached like he did gun barrel straight called and by his grace you have have had a chance to hear these things to be raised under these things amen so in revelation 19 verses 11 to 15 when you go to the marriage supper via the rapture which is the mode of transportation when you are away and you're standing at the judgment seat of christ being announced before the lord being announced before the saints of all the ages being announced before your prophet then enjoying the great supper while that's happening two prophets are preaching to the jews on the earth the same message that you've had the chance to receive and once they have preached 144 000 are sealed by the holy ghosts then those prophets and those sealed jews are martyred and then jesus returns to the earth with his sealed bride which is you and i amen that's revelation 19 that's his third coming that's his physical coming there's three comings of the lord the first one was 2 000 years ago jesus born in flesh to die to pay the bright price amen you were chosen to be his bride before the foundation of the world and he paid the price on calvary second coming is perugia word his presence here today second coming that's the lord's third coming revelation 19 his glorified flesh with his glorified brides amen coming back to the earth for armageddon for armageddon and armageddon is the outpouring of the seven vials to purge the earth for the millennium because when moses and elijah in revelation 11 are preaching the bible says they smite the earth with plagues is that what the bible says they smite the earth with plagues so that's not the seven vials in the tribulation that's those prophets causing it not to rain that's the prophets causing the water to turn the blood that's the prophets doing that but when jesus returns with his in glorified form with glorified bride amongst the brightest seven men and glorified flesh who are the angels for their age bearing the viles to pour on the earth to purge it you understand now that means that when our prophet was here he must have been bringing plagues on the earth too if moses and elijah are plaguing the earth while they're preaching jesus against the enemy then our prophet as he's preaching the message of bringing plagues on the earth pick up a rock and throw it in the air thus saith the lord judgment will strike the worst case i believe england will be sunk someday los angeles is going to go beneath the scene he's calling down plagues while he's preaching salvation people want to feel good gospel they don't want to feel good but you need to be shaken up in this hour amen so here they come now to purge the earth and so in revelation 16 these vials have been poured out and you're reading of what is in each veil but they've been poured out together a great cleansing of the earth and there's no intercession it's all judgment amen when esther came into her position as queen she pronounced judgment didn't she the king performed her word says the adversary is that wicked haman and the king the king that gave the order for the hanging but she spoke and the lord performed the king performed their words you speak you speak those seven angels are bright aren't they that bright they power the lord performs they pour the lord performs you realize saints if you're a son of god and somebody will not listen you can wipe the dust of your feet you you do the action and god will perform the cursing that's the power that you have as a son and daughter of god led by the holy ghost amen praise the lord let's turn in our bibles to ezekiel chapter nine i was saying brother ben last night i said ben on a wednesday night i'll try and preach for one hour because people work hard that time on a sunday you fall asleep that's your problem you stay up late on a saturday night that's your problem ezekiel 9 verse 1 and 10. the bible says he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice speaking to ezekiel saying cause them that have charge over the city of jerusalem to draw near this is ezekiel 9 verse 1 and 2 every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the north every man slaughter weapon in his hand but among those six men was one other man the seventh man among them who was clothed with linen with a writer's ink on by his side and they went in these six angels with the slaughtering weapons they went and stood by the brazen altar of sacrifice they stood there whilst the seventh man clothed in linen with the writers in corn went forth to seal people first so in ezekiel 9 and ezekiel 10 you're seeing the same thing that we are reading of even in revelation 7 and revelation 8. in revelation 7 verses 1 to 3 you have an angel ascending from the east sealing 144 000 juice right and then in revelation 8 the next chapter you've got jesus himself pouring out the sensor of fire upon the earth to purge it but before the earth is purged in revelation 8 verses 3 to 5 the jews were sealed and that is put there to show how god deals with the gentiles before god purges the earth he seals his bride first the jewish type is given to show how god is dealing with gentiles and now here in ezekiel 9 we are seeing the same scenery that intercession is coming to an end and the judgment the wrath of god is going to be poured out you follow good intercession is coming to an end and the wrath of god is going to be poured out now these six men they are angels and they have a slaughter weapon and you can't see them with this eye but when ezekiel was caught into heaven he could see them a hundred years ago as well isaac made a film from world war one there was a world war which suddenly stopped nobody can explain why the war stopped but john could because when john was in heaven he saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that they should not blow but nobody on the earth saw that they just saw bullets mustard gas death toll increasing armaments being produced that's all they saw but in heaven john saw four angels allowing wind to blow god said to these angels go forth and let the wind of war blow and they they are receiving more revelation in heaven because they are just going forth letting the wind of war blow and then finally an angel flies and says now hold the four winds now receiving more instruction in heaven and our angels stop the winds and on the earth the war stopped and nobody knows how you follow and the media can can write whatever they want but brother branham could tell us why and when that angel spoke to those four angels holding with the winds allowing them to blow he says hold the winds that they no longer hurt the earth do you know who that angel was that commanded the four other angels to hold the winds that was jesus that same angel that gave the instruction for the wind to stop blowing was the same angel who came to the prophet while world war one was still raging in 1916 and he said to our prophet don't drink don't smoke don't hurt your earth don't defile your body in any way do not hurt this earth and that same angel who spoke to the prophet saying don't hurt this earth in 1916 while the war was raging then in 1918 spoke to four angels and says stop the war no more hurting of the physical earth same angel but we read of history but unless you read what's happening in eternity you won't understand why see so in the unseen realm right now in this world today that's falling apart coming apart at the seams america is coming apart at the seams and new zealand will follow we are doing okay right now but we will surely fall apart because in the unseen realm are angels with slaughtering weapons standing by the brazen altar and the prophet said brass is judgment judgment for what sin the altar of sacrifice was made to address sin jesus died on the altar of the cross for sin and but the waiting for intercession to end waiting for the ceiling angel to go forth and seal all ordained to this message to receive it amen now you don't see the angels but what are you seeing you're seeing an arms race you're seeing great nations forming pacts getting jealous against america pushing america away starting to rally together building their armaments better armaments america's getting scared and these kings of the east the bible speaks of revelation 16 are doing this because they are anointed by six angels we're slaughtering weapons and the slaughtering weapons are what nuclear weapons aircraft with missiles all the latest technology to desecrate the earth that's the slaughtering weapons that you see in the physical but in the invisible it's angels standing next to the brazen altar with a slaughtering weapon waiting for the man in linen but you don't see a man in linen you see brother ben right you see brother ben preaching the word you see andy preaching the word you hear the prophet preaching the words you see the children see their parents trying to raise their children in the admonition of the lord that's what they see but in the invisible it's an angel in linen with a righteous incorn going forth to seal before the wrath of god is unleashed how do we follow amen but they can do nothing those nations until the last one has come in that's the consolation you have nothing can happen doesn't matter how unstable the climate is nothing can happen until we are gone amen until you are gone this man who is clothed in linen is jesus the high priest was always dressed in linen on the day of atonement the most important day in the jewish year was a day of atonement where sin would be absolved sin would be done away because what would happen saints is that for the past year everybody had been very sinful but on the last day of the year all the sin of the past 360 days or 365 days would be erased by that atonement thereafter if you send it's not covered because the atonement only covered from here in the past year but anything after that atonement is not covered until the next day of atonement you understand now it's only covering up to that time but you go out and sin straight after there's no blood for that that's that's serious now because revelation is the day of atonement what is the seventh seal jesus dressed as the high priest in revelation 8 verse 1 standing before the altar of incense to offer incense which are the prayers of the saints to cleanse the sanctuary of sin and once the sanctuary has been cleansed of sin he takes the censer of fire and he casts it on the earth to bring judgment on the earth to cleanse the earth that's this time that's the seventh seal you tell me the seventh seal is not open what is happening under the seventh seal is revelation eight three two five an angel standing before a golden altar offering up incense which are your prayers of intercession now there's no if there's no seven seal open there's no intercession your prayers are powerless praise the lord it's in the bible it's an open book amen and when those days come to an end he takes those fiery coals that formerly would stir up the incense as a sweet savour that would please the lord do you know why the bible says there was silence in heaven because the day of atonement was the most solemn day of the year and on the day of atonement all of israel would gather in front of the tabernacle because they knew that their high priest was going to represent them before jehovah and he was going to take the blood and if he was not accepted he would die he would die if he was not accepted and if he never came back out if he never returned then he was not accepted and they were not accepted so while he is in the sanctuary where you can't see him they are all outside praying and when they're praying they are praying quietly not a noise silence because every day in israel in jerusalem at the time of the offering of incense which was every morning and every evening they were all quietly praying and that's what's happening in revelation 8 verse 1 the silence is the offering of incense time where people are praying saying lord accept us because if he don't accept them they're dead as a nation they're cursed now finished but when he appears if he comes back into plain view that means he's been accepted the blood's been accepted and you've been accepted because he represented you so what was revelation 10 that's the high priest coming out of the holy of holies the mighty angel came from heaven the holy of holies to the earth the outer court where the congregation is and when you see him that means you have been accepted and you can rejoice but if there's no seventh seal open then there's no jesus who's come to tell you you are accepted before the father amen that's all this is not very mysterious isn't it it's just what it is it's very self-explanatory in the bible saints praise the lord and jesus said he says i pray for them he says i don't pray for the world i pray for them which thou has given me for they are thine amen is that that's jesus a lasered guided missile i'm not praying for everybody i'm praying for those whom you've given me amen jesus prayed we have a ministry of intercession we are reflecting jesus on the earth you know that a priest he reflects he represents a people to god the prophet represents god to the people but you represent your family to god your unsaved loved ones to god the youth to god you represent them in your ministry as a priest you need to be taught how to operate how to live as a priest bible says you've been made kings and priests unto gods amen amen this is the day where the ceiling is coming to an end now in revelation 8 verses 3 to 5 as i just mentioned the bible says after the silence in heaven there was another angel who was jesus himself he stood at the golden altar he held a golden censer there was given unto him much incense two thousand years of the prayers of the saints being offered up that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints that's what it represents upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand and then once it's all gone up the angel takes the sensor fills it with fire and casts it into the earth once all the intercessory prayer has gone up and he takes that sensor fills it with fire no more incense with this one cast it in the earth go and pray all you want in the cathedral no more mercy amen this is the day you have a very important position amen amen because the seventh seal is jesus and the seventh seal is here it's open he is here amen there were lightnings voices thunderings a great earthquake a day of atonement where where he's seen as the high priest for you he's the high priest amen but if you are not identified with that blood he's not the high priest he is supreme judge what do you see when you look up in the sky and you see the cloud what do you see do you see the supreme judge or do you see the high priest see when i look up i see the i see the high priest but if you're not connected with them you only see the judge because the seven church ages he majored as high priest but his minor role was the judge but in the last days his major role as the judge and minor role as high priest this is the fullness of judgment striking the earth when intercession is finished and that's where we're at right now the phasing out of mercy for gentiles center will be filled to cleanse the earth in the book of genesis there was sodom and gomorrah and sodom and gomorrah has appeared in the last days as it was in the days of sodom as it was in the days of life but before the golden censer of fire was poured out as fire and brimstone in genesis 19 there was genesis 18. lord if there be 50 in sodom but what if there be 40 lord if there be 40 i will spare well what if it'd be 30 all the way down to lord if there be 10. the lord said if there's 10 i'll spirit there was intercession from who abraham god's friend the royal seed before god judged you are of the seed you're not of the seed of abraham you're of the faith of abraham you're of the faith of brenham and before god judges you have a part to play before the sanctuary is so smoky that there's no more priestly ministry anymore you have a power to play you have a power to play right now you don't sit in the chair in the sea wondering what you're here for because you're not called to preach you all sister brother young old have a ministry to do for the lord all of you and all you need is the faith to action what god wants you to do takes faith doesn't it do you have faith you have to be loosed from fear the reason why there's so much fear in our lives is because you're looking at things and involved in things that only generate fear and not faith amen anything of the world does not generate faith it will only generate fear which makes you lock up to serve god now if you're in that condition it's because you're exposing yourself to the wrong thing if you want a quickening of faith get under the influence of the word which will undo the fear to serve the lord as you were designed to serve god it's not very complicated is it you see you can come up the front and be prayed over every single meeting and i could pour out bottle of the bottle of the the richest purest olive oil on you and you'll still go out in the same condition if you're playing around with the world you want to fix all magic cure and you don't want to do anything you're called to separate from unbelief god is not going to push you through a tube the prophet said you have a part to play and when you hear the word preached when you see that you're falling short then deal to those devils and say lord strengthen me to execute some devils and let the light keep shining to flush out devils so i can have the faith to live as you want me to live this isn't this isn't deep is it it's very simple fear is the greatest curse the greatest curse that you allow to increase in your life because you play around with the world in the ranks of the message and that's why you're in those conditions we can talk holy talk all we want in church and in fellowship put on a smiley face as we do for one another i do that but you realize you get home behind the scenes you've got to face reality and that's very different story that's when you've got to meet god and some days you don't feel energetic in the flesh serving god not based on your energy levels it's not based on how much sleep you had the night before it's the word man that regulates the flesh man not the other way around praise the lord and so under the fourth seal when that pale horse rider was going riding forth the bible says there was sword and famine and pestilence and the beasts of the earth and that's what you're seeing today pestilence on the earth and sword war and famine famine not just because the economies are crashing but because great swarms of locusts are eating up the crops in africa and all around the world and there's famine but why is there famine because it's in the words because the message was rejected but while there's all of that he said you won't beg brent he said while there's pestilence there's an atonement and in the atonement of salvation and healing he forgives all your iniquities that's dealing with the soul he heals all your diseases that's dealing with the flesh and the spirit around he's made provision for you in the hour of his wrath [Music] your provision is not a face mask it's not sanitizer your provision is in his words amen praise the lord and so in ezekiel knows my last page everybody do not fear last page when this when this man went forth to seal it was jesus christ the holy ghost himself in verses 3 to 6 of ezekiel 9 the bible says the glory of the god of israel went went up from the cherub you know the glory of the lord would hover above the mercy seat when he was there that was a very good thing would he be tired to have the ark of god in the presence of god not above it what what value is it to come to church and have the word and no holy spirit there there's only judgment there isn't it but you want to have the ark of god with his presence hovering on it amen and you are the ark of god today because he's not in some box overlaid in gold he's in flesh this humanity overlay with his deity and his presence should be upon that but here the glory of the lord went up from off the mercy seat and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the righteous ink on by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of jerusalem because in jerusalem that was the religious center of the day that's where the word went forth through the midst of the city and set a mark upon the foreheads of the man who sigh and who cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof are you signing and crying when you look at the world today does it vex your spirit does it grieve you or do you quite enjoy what satan has made accessible to you how it allows you to just enjoy taking your mind off where you ought to be so you can play around with what the devil has to offer well have your eyes been open to see the reality of this word the lateness of this hour the urgency of it and the value of it to go before the lord say lord man not just me but them he says go and set a mark upon them that signed cry for the abominations and then he says to the other angels with the slaughtering weapons he says now go ye after him in other words follow behind him he's walking ceiling and behind them are these angels with slaughtering weapons go behind them through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children innocent people haven't reached the age of accountability but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary not at the white house not at the beehive not in the center of wellington begin that shekinah tabernacle and start dealing to those who reject the selling angel cannot name a man that has my mark praise the lord if you've got the mark of god the holy ghost which is his seal what do you have to fear amen what do you have to fear then they began at who they began with the ancient men the oldest ones who knew better the ones that lived through the 50s and the 60s and the 70s i could see the change in the world and knew that things weren't right and and could could it could recognize things that the younger ones can't they start with them which we're before the house judgment begins in the house of god amen the older you get the more accountable you are more accountable you are amen if you're young and you know the truth you're accountable before god so the glory of god the shekinah the presence of god the purifier that dwell above the mercy seat left the glory of god was departing ichabod was being written on the age remember in the time of samuel eli the priest had two sons hofny and phineas and they they went up to battle with the ark and the ark was taken and hoffty and phineas were killed and and the news came back and phineas's wife was pregnant and she was about to bring forth and as she brought forth and heard that her husband was dead the wall was lost the ark was gone she called her son ichabod the glory of the lord is departed and that's where this age is the glory of god has departed from this age it's been written all over the earth god was showing ezekiel what he was about to do he told his prophet ezekiel because ezekiel is watching all this he's writing it and he can declare that to the people god always deals with the prophet value this message what god is saying through him is the seal for the age amen that's the seal you need in that man was jesus christ the high priest was speaking through him and every message is that man in linen with a writer's income by his side ceiling receptive hearts to their message praise the lord and then after he's sealed all these years you've heard preaching in this church i've heard preaching in our church zoom meetings all the preachings happening it's a time of sealing but one day it comes to an end and the slaughtering angels go forth and the first time they went forth one day the babylonian army because the bible says the angels came from the north babylon was to the north the babylonians came they traveled south and they surrounded jerusalem and they lay a siege to jerusalem nobody could go out nobody could come in caused everything to start collapsing and and all those jews that were not here ezekiel all they saw was the babylonians but ezekiel and those that had heard his message like jeremiah they saw six angels coming to judge those that rejected the ceiling angel see and those slaughtering angels killed those babylonians killed and took into captivity those people who rejected their prophets after the prophet's gone after he's given his message lest i the lord come and smite the earth with a curse and then in the middle of the bible here was jesus jesus was the word made flesh he lived out the word on the day of pentecost his spirit came onto the church and sealed them sealed them the ceiling angel sealed them then in ad-70 the roman legions came they surrounded jerusalem all the elected jews they had fled the city because jesus said when you see jerusalem compass with arby's what happened was the romans came the zealots bit the romans back when they were beaten back the elected jews got out of the city the romans came back and surrounded it and all those in the city all they saw was roman legions but those who'd heard the message saw six slaughtering angels and they knew the day of pentecost was the ceiling angel because they were living in a higher realm and in this day we have received a prophet and his message was jesus christ who is the sailing angel and he is gone the man is gone but the spirit is still here and we have received it and are being sealed by it and when you go you watch all those superpowers cease preparing their weapons and put their weapons to use and the press can theorize all they want with who said what that upset whatever politician to make this happen what it is it's judgment angels after the holy ghost leaves the earth and the bride praise the lord so in ezekiel the musicians will come when ezekiel is seeing these things he's seeing a throne of mercy and judgment amen he's seeing a throne of mercy and judgment and so this morning or this afternoon the question is for you all where do you stand in relation to god how do you see the lord you serve him because you fear him or do you serve him because you love him we serve the lord because we love him i trust i serve the lord because i love him i have a lot of problems i don't deny my problems i go before the lord and i know that no matter how great or how small my issues are or yours god will deal with them all and we know that this is the time to go before the lord and to address these things because that time is short time is short the wrath of god will be poured out and so saints you have a ministry to your family of a ministry in the church of a ministry to your friends to your colleagues a ministry but if you are finding that you are paralyzed paralysis brother banham says when he got in the presence of god he was paralyzed and i tell you you get around the devil and you start playing with the devil you will be paralyzed will paralyze your faith brother bannon said about moses he says his faith paralyzed the world moses faith paralyzed egypt it brought that economy to a standstill and one night the firstborn died that was the future of egypt gone in one night because everything was laid up in the first born and when he died egypt's future was toast finished he paralyzed the world with his faith but let me tell you if you're not in the things of god you're not in his presence but you're playing around with anything else but the things of god your faith will be paralyzed spiritual paralysis and i tell you what i would say over 90 of people in the message are spiritually paralyzed why because it's not a revelation to them they have the word but no spirit to anoint the word let me tell you if you don't have the spirit go before god and say lord let your spirit quicken the word to me make it alive because when it's alive then you can walk and live and serve and have joy knowing the lord jesus in this finishing hour whether it be one month that we have two months a year whatever we have left go and serve him in that time within the time the prophet said about john the baptist god raised him 30 years for six months work you've done nothing for the lord god god might have been raising you all this time for a short work but all things that you go through is to prepare you for your ministry that's the consolation action your time saints i believe that's what the emphasis behind all the zoom youth meetings are this is the time this is the hour wake up the bridegroom cometh and his hair go ye out to meet him trim your lamps examine your life be ready to go because those who were not ready when they came knocking he says i knew you not in other words i had no relationship with you so what is revelation saints it's not about understanding what i said it's about knowing the lord jesus personally that's what it is don't go home tonight this afternoon lord i want to understand what he said said lord i want to know you amen and he can give the understanding behind what is said in his time what's what's this song yeah let's sing that one okay i saw [Music] those who looked on him [Music] oh [Music] together with me [Music] [Music] he'll give you everything [Music] [Music] [Music]
