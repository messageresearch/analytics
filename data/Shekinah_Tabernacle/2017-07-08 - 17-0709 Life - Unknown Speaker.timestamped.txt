[52:20] it's going to Matthew chapter 1 and
[52:23] verse 1 now we're going to read the
[52:28] whole chapter if that's okay the book of
[52:33] the generation of Jesus Christ the Son
[52:36] of David the son of Abraham
[52:39] [Music]
[52:43] Abraham begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob
[52:46] Jacob begat Judas and his brethren Judas

[53:38] forget yours ice injures ice forget
[53:42] chicken OS Joseph and his brethren about

[54:10] matthan and matthan begat jacob and
[54:14] jacob begat joseph the husband of mary
[54:16] of whom was born Jesus which is called
[54:19] Christ so all the generations from
[54:21] Abraham to David are fourteen
[54:23] generations and from David and to the
[54:25] carrying away into Babylon are fourteen
[54:26] generations and from the carrying away
[54:29] into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen
[54:30] generations now the birth of Jesus
[54:32] Christ was on this wise we just had a
[54:35] very long natural lineage but now here
[54:37] comes here comes a very different way of
[54:39] being born now the birth of Jesus Christ
[54:41] was on this wise or when as his mother
[54:45] Mary was espoused to Joseph before they
[54:47] came together she was found with child
[54:49] of the Holy Ghost where then Joseph her
[54:53] husband being a just man not willing to
[54:55] make her a public
[54:56] example was minded to put her away
[54:58] privately probably and while he thought
[55:01] on these things behold the angel of the
[55:04] Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying
[55:06] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[55:08] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[55:11] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[55:13] Ghost and she shall bear forth a son and
[55:15] thou shalt call his name Jesus for he
[55:18] shall save his people from their sins
[55:20] now all this was done that it might be
[55:22] fulfilled by us that was spoken of the
[55:25] Lord by the Prophet saying behold a
[55:27] virgin shall be with child and shall
[55:30] bring forth a son and they shall call
[55:32] his name Emmanuel which is being
[55:34] interpreted and which being interpreted
[55:35] is God with us then Joseph being raised
[55:39] from sleep did as the angel Lord had
[55:41] bidden him and took unto her Marius wife
[55:43] and you heard not till she had brought
[55:45] forth her firstborn son and called and
[55:49] he called his name Jesus amen may the
[55:53] Lord bless this word you may have your
[55:54] seats today I want to take a if I could
[56:02] take a subject out of there I want to
[56:04] take life you know we just read a as I
[56:08] said a very long lineage and we
[56:12] understand that in this lineage and then
[56:16] we'll go into a bit later
[56:17] you recognize a lot of names because
[56:20] it's not just a natural lineage but
[56:23] there's a faith lineage in there too and
[56:25] sometimes it rears and it manifests part
[56:27] of God's Word sometimes it's just
[56:29] generations of not much doing it's just
[56:32] a natural than is then God manifests
[56:34] himself and some more people then maybe
[56:36] you'll go back underground again so to
[56:38] speak there continues on and on down and
[56:41] now but we also understand so this is a
[56:44] record of a life now a genealogy or a
[56:47] generation it says this is the book of
[56:49] the generation of Jesus Christ which is
[56:51] his genealogy according to the flesh now
[56:54] we understand that when Jesus that's why
[56:57] when we got down to when Mary was was a
[57:00] well overshadowed by the whole it she
[57:02] was found with child of the Holy Ghost
[57:04] this was showing that even though God
[57:06] tied the coming of his son to the
[57:09] lineage that lineage had nothing to do
[57:11] with it Amen because God created Jesus
[57:14] Christ in the womb of Mary there wasn't
[57:17] any part of Mary there's no part of
[57:18] Joseph he was he wasn't created a meant
[57:22] a created person created cell in the
[57:25] womb of Mary so even though you know God
[57:28] attribute does yo he he he attributes
[57:32] you know Jesus being as the son of David
[57:34] the son of Abraham there was no real
[57:36] natural part of their lineage in him but
[57:39] down through this lineage deals of faith
[57:41] being manifested down through so you
[57:44] know the things that we see in in Jesus
[57:48] Christ was manifested partially in
[57:51] Abraham and David and Solomon a meant
[57:55] like we see you know you can see you
[57:59] know Christ was an Abraham you know all
[58:01] those things were shadow is pointing to
[58:03] him coming so so just as a maybe I
[58:07] should give the definition but the book
[58:09] of the generations so that's a genealogy
[58:12] now if you see a family tree you'll see
[58:14] natural characteristics being passed
[58:16] down right so you know you see how your
[58:19] children are if you knew your
[58:21] great-great-grandfather on either side
[58:23] you would have found that characteristic
[58:25] would have been there somewhere or the
[58:27] great-great-grandmother because these
[58:28] things are all passed down this is
[58:30] natural this is just natural traits are
[58:32] passed down through a through a lineage
[58:34] a meant but we're not talking about
[58:38] natural traits were talking about
[58:39] supernatural traits of faith right so
[58:43] now a generation so this word generation
[58:47] and the Greek it's the same as a
[58:50] nativity or figuratively it's a nature
[58:53] so it's the book of the nature of Jesus
[58:56] Christ although it's the genealogy of
[58:58] his nature coming down through human
[59:00] beings amen and so and then it's also
[59:06] part of the root word of that it is
[59:09] actually kin we're and to be kin it
[59:12] means you know it means a it means a
[59:16] kindred a nation and offspring or a
[59:19] stock right there you know that's why
[59:21] people they they slicks
[59:23] cattle and they breed them because
[59:25] there's characteristics in those cattle
[59:27] that they want to pass down into the
[59:28] offspring you know certain things maybe
[59:30] makes more milk or maybe more more more
[59:33] meat or you know bigger or your
[59:35] different temperaments same with
[59:36] breeding of horses or dogs or something
[59:38] there's certain characteristics that
[59:41] people are looking for and they want to
[59:43] pass it down to the future generations
[59:45] now that's just natural breeding I mean
[59:48] we know a faith a faith you know being
[59:50] passed down through that goes beyond you
[59:52] know we're not believers because our
[59:54] parents are believers we're not
[59:56] believers because we could even trace
[59:58] just so if you even could trace your
[59:59] lineage back to Adam that has nothing to
[1:00:01] do with it it goes beyond natural
[1:00:03] natural marriage and Union and children
[1:00:05] coming down but God down through us has
[1:00:08] has placed a faith seat I mean enter
[1:00:10] people and as Jesus would say to
[1:00:12] Nicodemus he sees the wind blows
[1:00:14] wordlist earth you cannot tell where it
[1:00:17] comes from or where it goes and so does
[1:00:18] that everyone is born of the Spirit of
[1:00:20] God you know you can't tell you know you
[1:00:23] can't look at someone necessarily and
[1:00:24] say this one's going to be a believer or
[1:00:26] this was not going to be a believer you
[1:00:29] know you take the New Testament there's
[1:00:30] the woman at the well naturally if you
[1:00:32] look at her you would everyone would
[1:00:34] have disregarded her there's no way
[1:00:36] she's going to be part of the new
[1:00:37] creation there's no way she's going to
[1:00:39] be the Temple of the Living God I mean
[1:00:42] there's no way she's going to be there
[1:00:43] in the upper room I mean where God says
[1:00:45] is the body hallelujah my children I'm
[1:00:48] going to gather my bride I'm going to
[1:00:49] gather I'm going to dwell in them I mean
[1:00:52] I'm going to take her as a living stone
[1:00:53] shaper and molder and place her into the
[1:00:56] building of Jesus Christ you're never a
[1:00:58] thought you'd be that category but here
[1:01:00] there she was but there's a faith seat
[1:01:02] Holly there's a faith C dinner Amen a
[1:01:05] win and when the light shot on that
[1:01:07] cedar came to life what was really in
[1:01:09] her hallelujah so it goes beyond natural
[1:01:12] natural that's why I'm trusting it's a
[1:01:15] it's a generation or it's a genealogy of
[1:01:18] faith and you can take the same thing if
[1:01:20] you go into Hebrews chapter living we
[1:01:22] won't have time that is a faith seat by
[1:01:25] faith Noah Enoch whoever it was came
[1:01:29] down as a that's a faith being passed
[1:01:31] down and it's not by natural natural
[1:01:34] children
[1:01:35] natural ability of our parents having
[1:01:37] children that's God placed and God
[1:01:40] before the foundation of the world knew
[1:01:41] you'd be here and he and he put
[1:01:44] something in you he he put a seed in you
[1:01:47] amen that may have sat dormant I pray
[1:01:50] it's not dormant you know some people
[1:01:52] they come to church special young people
[1:01:54] and they try and play survivor can I
[1:01:56] survive another service can I just sit
[1:01:58] there do they do do you see people they
[1:02:00] try and write it out and it's the most
[1:02:02] ridiculous thing it is they try and
[1:02:05] write it out two more hours what's the
[1:02:07] time
[1:02:07] oh yeah okay it's it's it's 8 to 11 I've
[1:02:12] survived the song service he's not going
[1:02:14] to look at me so it's going to be
[1:02:15] alright I'm going to think about
[1:02:17] something else then I'm gonna get our
[1:02:18] church and I'll survive another service
[1:02:20] I've seen it wherever I've gone what's
[1:02:23] happened now the seed must die and rot
[1:02:25] then it can come to life I'm in but it's
[1:02:28] your own choosing if it dies and rots
[1:02:30] and comes to life I mean because the
[1:02:33] waters here the lights here talking
[1:02:35] naturally now I'm in the soils there the
[1:02:38] seats there we got to let it come to
[1:02:40] life amen so it's a no brother barren
[1:02:45] speaks about Christ revealed in his own
[1:02:47] word he says now we've take we've we've
[1:02:50] taken through the lesson to show that in
[1:02:52] your great-great-grandfather all the way
[1:02:55] back physically speaking
[1:02:56] then that's what you are in physical
[1:02:59] being nature sometimes a child is born
[1:03:02] in the family
[1:03:02] that's redheaded it astonishes the
[1:03:05] father because there's nobody he knows
[1:03:07] of as peoples redheaded or the mothers
[1:03:10] but if you go way back to several
[1:03:13] generations you'll find out somebody was
[1:03:16] redheaded that seed keeps coming on down
[1:03:20] and you find the nature of one from way
[1:03:24] back
[1:03:24] that's just that's just naturally
[1:03:26] speaking now I'm talking about life
[1:03:29] because life you know we think we think
[1:03:32] you know we have great times we have
[1:03:35] been great life or things go bad are we
[1:03:39] having a but hey yo that person had a
[1:03:41] hard life that's just natural life and
[1:03:44] it's Kenya and it's just based on
[1:03:47] conditions of
[1:03:48] you know how well things are running you
[1:03:50] know it's subject to time I've been
[1:03:53] thinking about this I've been praying a
[1:03:55] lot how do I convey this but you know
[1:03:57] life is life natural life when you hit
[1:04:01] about you know hit about eighteen to
[1:04:03] twenty one twenty five you're at the
[1:04:05] peak of life yeah you go you're go from
[1:04:08] a baby
[1:04:08] you go into a fully mature adult and
[1:04:10] you're and you're actually your life
[1:04:12] you're not you're you're growing into
[1:04:14] your fullness of what you are and then
[1:04:16] you begin to age then you begin to get
[1:04:18] older then the house gets a little bit
[1:04:21] older gets a little bit more tired some
[1:04:23] of the some of the hair begins to go my
[1:04:26] dad says I'm making room as well I don't
[1:04:28] know what he's making room for that's
[1:04:29] what he said that's what he calls it so
[1:04:31] I'm making room now me myself and you
[1:04:33] get older you're not really living
[1:04:35] you're starting to die as soon as you
[1:04:38] hit that age you begin to die I mean but
[1:04:41] people will come into that just after
[1:04:42] that stage and and I think they're
[1:04:44] really living because they can do what
[1:04:45] they can want to do and they go and live
[1:04:47] and how great this is but it's just
[1:04:49] natural life than a subject of time that
[1:04:52] will all eventually come to an end but
[1:04:55] there's a different kind of life eternal
[1:04:57] life which is far above natural life and
[1:05:01] that is the life that we are contending
[1:05:04] for I mean that is a life we really want
[1:05:06] to receive and if we have received it
[1:05:09] it's the glorious most glorious thing
[1:05:11] that you could imagine a meant to be a
[1:05:14] possessor I mean not just talk about it
[1:05:17] but absolutely and your very soul and
[1:05:19] you'll be a man then it doesn't matter
[1:05:22] first thing just ceased if my heart
[1:05:24] stopped and I died right here if I have
[1:05:26] eternal life hallelujah Amen oh won't
[1:05:30] bother me too much
[1:05:31] I'll be happier amen what Jesus I mean
[1:05:35] Paul said you know to be with you yeah
[1:05:37] I'd rather be with you with the Lord
[1:05:39] than here but I need to be here I mean
[1:05:41] because he received something that was
[1:05:43] more than just natural life you know a
[1:05:45] natural religion of of studying the
[1:05:48] Bible as he did and you know do it going
[1:05:50] through different forms of religion that
[1:05:52] was natural life that was a natural
[1:05:54] understanding he had but then when the
[1:05:57] very one who who gave that word that he
[1:05:59] studied met him on the road to the mass
[1:06:02] different life happened a different life
[1:06:05] came in hallelujah I say that that seed
[1:06:08] that was in him came to life hallelujah
[1:06:15] now eternal life it's very different
[1:06:22] Jesus it's let's go to first John
[1:06:25] chapter one first John one and one
[1:06:36] because we're gonna understand it let's
[1:06:39] just read this this means this is so
[1:06:42] dear to me it says first John one and
[1:06:47] one
[1:06:47] this is dear to me because if you've
[1:06:50] made remember God is eternal he doesn't
[1:06:53] change I'm God I changed not Jesus
[1:06:56] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:06:58] forever now he manifests himself in a
[1:07:01] form maybe different but there's very
[1:07:02] core being what he loves then he loves
[1:07:04] now what he hates then he hates now I
[1:07:07] mean how he deals with people then he
[1:07:09] deals with them now how he saves him he
[1:07:11] saves now
[1:07:12] I mean how he heals any heal spell all
[1:07:15] according to faith it's already a
[1:07:16] finished work I mean so now when he says
[1:07:19] that which was from the beginning now we
[1:07:22] could state I could take this and I
[1:07:24] could say this is my testimony that
[1:07:26] which was from the beginning which we
[1:07:30] have heard which we have seen with our
[1:07:32] eyes which we have looked upon and our
[1:07:36] hands have handled the word of life
[1:07:39] hallelujah now that's not natural life
[1:07:41] that's the word of eternal life
[1:07:43] I mean for the life was manifested and
[1:07:46] we have seen it and bear witness and
[1:07:49] show unto you that eternal life which
[1:07:52] was with the father and was manifested
[1:07:54] unto us hallelujah that is that is the
[1:07:58] believers he said oh this John writing
[1:08:00] about 2000 years ago I don't know it's
[1:08:02] not just historical that was a living
[1:08:04] reality to him and he was passing it
[1:08:06] down to future generations but now we
[1:08:08] stand at the end of all things and I
[1:08:11] trust it as a believer you when you read
[1:08:13] that scripture you
[1:08:15] say I have seen eternal life manifested
[1:08:18] I have handled other I have seen with my
[1:08:21] eyes I mean when you see God manifest
[1:08:23] that you see God Amen Joe you know
[1:08:26] brother BAM I preached a sermon I've
[1:08:29] heard of Li but now I see thee he took
[1:08:31] the text from when God came down in a
[1:08:33] whirlwind and spoke to Joe and he says
[1:08:35] that sermon when you seek God manifested
[1:08:37] you see him you see God amen and he say
[1:08:41] I've heard of thee but now I see thee at
[1:08:43] the end of the service and he ending God
[1:08:45] comes down as he does after the
[1:08:47] preaching the word God was in the
[1:08:48] preaching the word then God manifests
[1:08:50] himself because he wants the people to
[1:08:52] see this is eternal life coming I mean
[1:08:55] the worst that you've heard her eternal
[1:08:56] life and he begins to discern the
[1:08:58] thoughts and intents of the hearts of
[1:08:59] the people I mean everything is naked
[1:09:01] before God I mean that your people
[1:09:04] people's needs and people's ailments
[1:09:06] were made known he says there was God
[1:09:08] manifesting you've seen God in this
[1:09:10] place I meant and then we come down
[1:09:13] there's 50 odd years ago you come down
[1:09:15] to this day and that same God is
[1:09:17] manifesting himself hallelujah so we
[1:09:20] don't just hear if we see the Lord I
[1:09:23] mean when you see someone be birthed by
[1:09:25] the Spirit I mean God comes down an
[1:09:27] anointing God come in a night music God
[1:09:30] anoint preaching holy a God anoint life
[1:09:32] to live every day I mean we can say I've
[1:09:35] heard of thee but now I see thee
[1:09:36] I've seen eternal life hallelujah we've
[1:09:40] seen it manifested I mean because this
[1:09:43] Bible is not a date later to us it's a
[1:09:45] living reality I mean when the author
[1:09:47] comes hallelujah thousands of years
[1:09:50] later down here here it is I'm going to
[1:09:53] quicken this to you I mean this word is
[1:09:55] sitting here I'm going to make it live
[1:09:56] that's God manifesting himself that's
[1:09:59] not me just getting excited that's a
[1:10:01] reality probably used to feel that
[1:10:03] pulsation of faith hallelujah that's God
[1:10:06] manifesting eternal life opposed man was
[1:10:11] sealed off from eternal life when they
[1:10:13] fell in Eden they fell from eternal life
[1:10:15] and everything Adam lost with we're
[1:10:18] being restored - hallelujah so eternal
[1:10:21] life was sealed off they called upon God
[1:10:23] I'm in the lineage of Adam you go read
[1:10:26] it and
[1:10:27] Genesis 405 I believe it is well the end
[1:10:31] of Florence is then man begin to call
[1:10:34] upon the name of the Lord because they
[1:10:36] have a burden imagine imagine sitting
[1:10:38] I've seen it before but you're there at
[1:10:41] the end of the day you see all these
[1:10:42] stars sitting around a campfire there's
[1:10:46] Adam and Eve sitting there your parents
[1:10:48] or grandparents or great-grandparents or
[1:10:51] they begin to relate because they knew
[1:10:55] what the heavens were they say look at
[1:10:57] that that's Leo the Lion is the Virgin
[1:11:02] the seed of the woman is going to come
[1:11:04] this way
[1:11:04] I tell the because in the barb did the
[1:11:07] Bible was written in the heavens I mean
[1:11:10] but we read this one but it's all in the
[1:11:12] heavens and so they would begin to say
[1:11:15] look and we're gonna be restored see
[1:11:17] that see that constellations they look
[1:11:19] and we're gonna be restored back
[1:11:21] basically they say this chapter and
[1:11:23] verse here I'll make all things do you
[1:11:24] there's a new hip ins and you were
[1:11:26] basically there
[1:11:28] it's up there don't think I'm crazy it's
[1:11:31] up there they say because they're
[1:11:32] reading the Bible and they would say I
[1:11:36] wish I could tell you what it was like
[1:11:38] to wake up and I garden never a bad
[1:11:43] thought they were a pain of this burden
[1:11:46] of sin Oh Lu you knew no sickness or
[1:11:49] sorry we didn't know what it was like to
[1:11:51] be sad we would have no it was like they
[1:11:54] have a bad thought we don't know what it
[1:11:56] was like to to get sick or hurt
[1:11:58] ourselves we'll be hungry or feel alone
[1:12:01] or be afraid that's why you think about
[1:12:06] that you hear a testimony like there you
[1:12:08] go God when are you gonna restore this
[1:12:11] I'm in my yard they were they
[1:12:14] experienced it but they prompt you
[1:12:16] promised them they might have still had
[1:12:18] the lambskins I don't know you promised
[1:12:21] them the seed of the woman is going to
[1:12:23] come eternal life is gonna come and he's
[1:12:26] gonna undo all this then the serpent has
[1:12:28] done you'd call upon God it'd be a so so
[1:12:32] alive Allu you
[1:12:35] here we are right down at the end of all
[1:12:39] things
[1:12:41] amen as I said Christ was in Abraham
[1:12:46] it's the faithful Indians coming through
[1:12:48] you see it manifesting some of those
[1:12:50] names you don't recognize a lot going on
[1:12:53] something you do Christ was manifested
[1:12:56] it revealed an Abraham and his life
[1:12:58] crisis and Isaac is the promised son
[1:13:01] Christ was in salmone marrying rehab
[1:13:05] Alleluia member Rahab was in Jericho she
[1:13:09] believes the report of the spies she put
[1:13:11] the token on her you know the Scarlet
[1:13:13] thread on her on a window going down the
[1:13:16] gate of the wall and and that you know
[1:13:18] you know the story as relates took took
[1:13:22] Jericho fell down flat Rahab and her
[1:13:24] family were safe in the house but then
[1:13:27] she marries but she's still out of the
[1:13:28] Commonwealth of Israel hallelujah
[1:13:31] but then Salman the general of the army
[1:13:33] marries her Amen they're all passes not
[1:13:37] just destroyed years and you identity
[1:13:39] and it's the same thing with you and I
[1:13:41] God just doesn't wipe out our past a
[1:13:43] memory he unites himself with you I mean
[1:13:46] that everything he has you become
[1:13:48] hallelujah I miss a crisis in Salman
[1:13:52] marrying Rahab Christ for some boys Amen
[1:13:56] redeeming roof as kinsman redeemer
[1:13:58] Christ was manifested there's a life
[1:14:01] being manifested I mean Christ was in
[1:14:03] David as rejected King as the one coming
[1:14:06] to power I mean as as to be the king you
[1:14:10] know of Israel Christ was in Solomon
[1:14:13] building the temple they had they had
[1:14:16] like an amateur millennium there in that
[1:14:19] season I mean as the son of David and
[1:14:22] there's and there's others there but
[1:14:24] I'll just leave those but there's also
[1:14:25] five women of grace and that lineage Lou
[1:14:29] you because many times you know you read
[1:14:30] about Abraham and Isaac and Salman and
[1:14:33] Boaz and David and Solomon and the
[1:14:35] others you know zoobel they're
[1:14:36] rebuilding the temple in the time of
[1:14:38] Nehemiah and sometimes we can't
[1:14:40] necessarily put ourselves in those
[1:14:42] people right something we should be able
[1:14:44] to you should see Jesus Christ in every
[1:14:46] scripture
[1:14:48] see yourself in there too and so there's
[1:14:50] also five woman of grace in that lineage
[1:14:52] and there's a there's things that those
[1:14:55] people do that we can't understand with
[1:14:58] our human mind you take Tama for example
[1:15:02] she's the first one she was married to
[1:15:05] Judas son but he would not he would not
[1:15:08] have a child with her and God killed him
[1:15:10] and then she married the next son same
[1:15:14] thing God killed them too and he she was
[1:15:18] basically said well you just go wait in
[1:15:20] your father's house
[1:15:21] but then something possessed her now
[1:15:24] this is eternal you can't explain this
[1:15:26] or you can't reason it out it doesn't
[1:15:28] sound even reasonable but something
[1:15:30] interesting I must have a child of the
[1:15:33] lineage of Judah amen and she puts on
[1:15:36] the attire of a harlot go sits in the
[1:15:39] way and then Judah her father-in-law
[1:15:41] takes her a mint and she becomes
[1:15:44] pregnant by him and she she has the son
[1:15:48] that Judas sons would not give her she
[1:15:52] was driven I don't understand that but
[1:15:56] something in it was saying I must have a
[1:15:57] son I must have this life hallelujah and
[1:16:01] it's the same thing with you there's
[1:16:03] something in the believer when they
[1:16:04] first hear the word I mean when God
[1:16:07] begins to deal with them there's
[1:16:08] something of them saying I must have
[1:16:09] this I must have the life of God in me I
[1:16:12] want him to come and dwell use me as a
[1:16:14] temple Lord come and dwell in me
[1:16:16] hallelujah is something in you I trusted
[1:16:19] us isn't drawing why you feel drawn
[1:16:22] hallelujah I'll tell you why because he
[1:16:25] wants to live in you manifest himself
[1:16:29] Alleluia the brother Brahim seasoned
[1:16:32] thirsting for life in 1958 he says life
[1:16:37] what is life life is what controls you
[1:16:41] life is what makes you what you are and
[1:16:44] the life that is within you makes you
[1:16:47] the written epistle grid of all me so
[1:16:50] you saying the life that is within you
[1:16:53] controls you
[1:16:55] Alleluia I read the asset glory to God I
[1:16:58] mean because of life within you
[1:17:01] matter you know brother Bram says if I'd
[1:17:03] the spirit of Beethoven in me I'd write
[1:17:05] music if I had the spirit of
[1:17:07] Michelangelo within me I do great
[1:17:09] masterpieces but if I have the life of
[1:17:12] Jesus Christ at me I will do the works
[1:17:14] of Jesus Christ a means to the life
[1:17:16] serve the life of beethoven's was in me
[1:17:19] it would control me I must play I must
[1:17:22] write music at the life of Michelangelo
[1:17:24] was within me I would have to do some
[1:17:26] artistry of this because it is a gift is
[1:17:29] a life driving then there'll be a life
[1:17:32] driving me I must I must paint the
[1:17:34] ceiling not just one color either by the
[1:17:37] way
[1:17:38] hallelujah I must do something you with
[1:17:42] me because there's a life driving and so
[1:17:45] at the life of Jesus Christ is in me I
[1:17:47] mean what else can I live by what else
[1:17:50] could I do there's a life that controls
[1:17:52] me
[1:17:53] Alleluia now the Bible likens people to
[1:17:59] seats I'm gonna talk about natural
[1:18:02] things so Matthew let's go to Matthew 13
[1:18:05] and 36
[1:18:13] now we're just going to read the
[1:18:15] interpretation of this parable because
[1:18:21] many times you read in the scripture you
[1:18:25] read the people do natural things but
[1:18:28] there's a faith being manifested - and
[1:18:31] they do not understand really like you
[1:18:34] take imagine if we jump back into the
[1:18:36] days of rehab and sell money and said
[1:18:40] this is what you're really living out
[1:18:42] this is us Christ Salamone you bring a
[1:18:45] type of Christ and you're redeeming this
[1:18:47] this Gentile woman in the days of
[1:18:50] destruction he wouldn't understand that
[1:18:52] he says well actually I just like her
[1:18:53] she's beautifully something just draws
[1:18:55] me to her and and there's something she
[1:18:57] loves me and then something draws us
[1:18:58] together we want to get married but
[1:19:02] there's a greater depth of life the same
[1:19:05] thing with Boaz you're marrying Ruth
[1:19:07] do you know what you're - yeah Aliyah
[1:19:10] you know the story it's not just it's
[1:19:13] not just a love story just put in the
[1:19:15] Bible is a reason it's there hallelujah
[1:19:18] or you take David or Solomon or you know
[1:19:20] any of them you know what you're living
[1:19:22] out what do you mean I'm just doing this
[1:19:24] this is what I feel to do there's what I
[1:19:26] need to do right because there's a is
[1:19:30] within people it's more than just a
[1:19:33] natural life no sorrow Matthew 13 and 36
[1:19:37] it says then Jesus sent the multitude
[1:19:40] away he went into the house and his
[1:19:43] disciples came unto him saying declare
[1:19:46] unto us the parable of the tares of the
[1:19:48] field he answered it's in of him he that
[1:19:51] sows the good seed is the son of man the
[1:19:54] field is the world the good seed of the
[1:19:56] children of the kingdom but the tears of
[1:19:58] the children of the wicked one the enemy
[1:20:00] that sowed them is the devil the harvest
[1:20:02] is the end of the world the Reapers are
[1:20:04] the Angels
[1:20:05] so therefore the tares are gathered and
[1:20:07] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[1:20:09] end of the world see so Jesus gives on
[1:20:12] I'm just totally plain as plain can be
[1:20:15] this is what the parable means there's
[1:20:17] people that are sowed into the world
[1:20:20] and they are what they are but there's
[1:20:25] something in the wheat amen
[1:20:28] there's something like a seed you can
[1:20:30] take two seats and if now when I used to
[1:20:33] work at my old job at a show-quality
[1:20:34] they had and I think in Palmerston North
[1:20:37] I think in Australia too they had seed
[1:20:39] lamps with a studied seats before they
[1:20:43] even plant anything because they had to
[1:20:45] prove that say this bag of pumpkin seeds
[1:20:49] or whatever seats is whatever percentage
[1:20:52] of the seat so they they spend years
[1:20:54] studying seats that when they when they
[1:20:59] examine a seed line that's going to be
[1:21:00] bagged and sent out or whatever they
[1:21:02] know what they're looking at now to an
[1:21:05] untrained eye well this is yeah is this
[1:21:07] a wheat seed yeah it is it looks like
[1:21:09] this one they could be totally off and
[1:21:12] train died so they all look the same
[1:21:15] when they're planted but then when when
[1:21:19] the Sun comes out the harvest season
[1:21:21] comes you know the rain begins to fall
[1:21:24] the temperatures just right they may
[1:21:26] begin to grow so what's in the seed
[1:21:28] begins to be manifested hallelujah so
[1:21:32] now so but in order for a seed to grow
[1:21:35] it has to be planted right once it's
[1:21:39] been planted it needs light and it needs
[1:21:41] moisture that's very elementary but you
[1:21:44] know and east light and it needs
[1:21:45] moisture so now in order for people now
[1:21:51] I'm talking about supernaturally down
[1:21:53] because this natural life this is not
[1:21:56] really what God ordained just to look
[1:21:58] you know the main part of us is that
[1:22:01] faith seat I meant that eternal part of
[1:22:05] us as this thing still needs a body
[1:22:06] change I'm glad it does I'm glad you
[1:22:11] know I don't know how people can believe
[1:22:12] that we're in the Millennium and we're
[1:22:14] getting older and people die well how
[1:22:16] does that work this is not a millennium
[1:22:18] to me I want a new one tried this one
[1:22:22] and I want a new one we're not in the
[1:22:24] Millennium but still they still you know
[1:22:26] sickness and age and death and so on No
[1:22:30] but supernaturally now people can it's
[1:22:34] it's that soul in you when that comes to
[1:22:38] life right because you say well I'm
[1:22:42] alive right now the Bible says in
[1:22:44] Ephesians 2
[1:22:45] we were once dead in trespasses and sins
[1:22:48] so these are people they weren't
[1:22:50] physically dead but spiritually they
[1:22:52] were just dormant they weren't living
[1:22:55] spiritually but in the right season at
[1:22:59] the right time something happened to
[1:23:01] them and something came to life they
[1:23:04] meant and that was when the light shot
[1:23:07] the moisture fell the temperature was
[1:23:10] right spiritually and a birth happened
[1:23:13] amen because I see that just sits there
[1:23:16] on a table you say well it's not dead
[1:23:19] because it can live but that's not
[1:23:22] really living it's just sitting there as
[1:23:25] I say don't play survivor say yes enter
[1:23:29] in a Greek amen because you look at a
[1:23:32] you know you see a big you say you just
[1:23:35] take like a mustard seed it's this
[1:23:37] little thing but it can grow into a
[1:23:38] massive tree imagine if the massive tree
[1:23:41] could look at the mustard you know some
[1:23:42] other mustard seed sitting there and
[1:23:44] think why you still like that it planned
[1:23:46] to die be born again you know it's so
[1:23:50] much better being a tree than just being
[1:23:52] a dumb little seat amen so don't stay
[1:23:58] that way now so neat now let's go to
[1:24:00] John st. John 1 I just want to read a
[1:24:04] couple of things and then we're going to
[1:24:05] go to Genesis chapter 1
[1:24:12] John 1 and 1 down to verse 4 in the
[1:24:19] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:24:22] with God and the Word was God
[1:24:24] so his word God in his word is one in
[1:24:26] the same and the same was in the
[1:24:28] beginning with God all things were made
[1:24:30] by him and without him was not anything
[1:24:33] made that was made in him was life and
[1:24:35] the life was the light of me
[1:24:39] so in him is life eternal life and then
[1:24:43] Jesus says in John 6 and 63 it is the
[1:24:47] spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[1:24:49] profiteth nothing the words that I speak
[1:24:52] to you they are spirit and they are life
[1:24:56] so the words that he speak their spirit
[1:24:59] and their life
[1:25:00] I mean eternal life as being spoken the
[1:25:03] words that he released was releasing
[1:25:04] eternal life amen so he is the light and
[1:25:08] life of men now so an order in order to
[1:25:13] really come to life God has to quicken
[1:25:16] the seat this is very elementary but I
[1:25:18] trust at the end of it you'll you'll go
[1:25:20] out here appreciating what you are
[1:25:22] because a wheat cannot become a tear and
[1:25:25] a tear cannot become a wheat I'm just
[1:25:27] going to major on the wheat can only be
[1:25:29] wheat amen bride can only be bride
[1:25:33] hallelujah it may be born and darkness
[1:25:35] and may be shaped in iniquity come into
[1:25:37] the world speaking lies but that's just
[1:25:39] a natural part that's not the
[1:25:40] supernatural part Alleluia they mean so
[1:25:45] Genesis 1 and 1 the Gospel story is all
[1:25:49] on the Genesis one you know that in the
[1:25:55] beginning
[1:25:57] God created the heaven and the earth and
[1:25:59] the earth was without form and void and
[1:26:03] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:26:05] now that was not all of us that was all
[1:26:09] of us once upon a time I trust you noted
[1:26:12] in that state still so you're just
[1:26:14] sitting there just you big big sea of
[1:26:16] humanity just living a natural life
[1:26:18] without form and void just in darkness
[1:26:22] we were all in darkness you following me
[1:26:25] we're all this way
[1:26:26] and but then I love these that there's a
[1:26:29] full stop at a conjunction and the
[1:26:31] Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[1:26:33] waters he had a purpose of doing it he
[1:26:37] wasn't just doing it for the sake of it
[1:26:38] but buried down now we're not going to
[1:26:41] read the whole chapter we're gonna read
[1:26:42] down to verse 12 but if you read the
[1:26:45] whole tration account it says he created
[1:26:48] all the animals and all the birds and
[1:26:50] all the fish he created man but there's
[1:26:53] no record of him creating the seats of
[1:26:55] the plants because they were already
[1:26:58] there right just like us and us was
[1:27:02] before the foundation of the world God
[1:27:04] put a deposit of himself a seed of
[1:27:07] predestination amen it was been sitting
[1:27:11] there but it has to come to life it was
[1:27:13] covered up and darkness amen you're
[1:27:16] covered up but then he began to move
[1:27:19] upon the Spirit of God moved upon the
[1:27:21] face of the water so now he begins to
[1:27:24] brood over the earth because there's
[1:27:25] life in the earth hallelujah there's a
[1:27:28] life that must come forth it come can't
[1:27:30] come forth covered in darkness covered
[1:27:33] in water I mean he had the brood of the
[1:27:35] earth the separate light from darkness
[1:27:38] hallelujah and then now why is this
[1:27:41] message so precious because it as as as
[1:27:43] God's supernatural voice speaking it is
[1:27:47] the light of the entire a means and now
[1:27:49] through his word he's brooding over the
[1:27:51] earth how they were defined his elected
[1:27:54] once to find his one and then he comes
[1:27:57] to you I may be jumping right into my
[1:27:59] sermon but once you know where I'm going
[1:28:01] and then he comes to you and then you
[1:28:03] hear his word and the spirit of Noyce
[1:28:06] the word evening is a brood over you
[1:28:09] amen and you begin to recognize there's
[1:28:12] more to life than this there's more to
[1:28:14] life than being a good person and
[1:28:16] getting a job and maybe having a family
[1:28:18] and living here and buying this house
[1:28:20] and you know big whoa what's happening
[1:28:22] because before you're covered in
[1:28:24] darkness whether you recognize it or not
[1:28:26] leaving in the brood overview and
[1:28:28] something in you begin to forget to cry
[1:28:31] out something there's a yearning and as
[1:28:34] I begin to build although I don't even
[1:28:38] at this point know really who you are
[1:28:39] his name is Jesus Christ if you didn't
[1:28:41] know amen
[1:28:43] any begin to because there's something
[1:28:44] because he's a seed now because remember
[1:28:46] in the winter time you can plant seeds
[1:28:49] and they'll stay on the ground just
[1:28:50] dormant but then the Sun begins to you
[1:28:54] know the earth comes closer to the Sun
[1:28:56] our part of the earth the sun rays get a
[1:29:00] bit stronger the tent the soil
[1:29:02] temperature raisers now there's
[1:29:05] something begins to happen in our life
[1:29:06] there's a force behind life there is a
[1:29:09] force and life amen life will not quit
[1:29:13] if it can live it'll live I mean there's
[1:29:17] something net just just just naturally
[1:29:19] you know I heard and you're like in
[1:29:21] Canada you know down here we have the
[1:29:22] raw you know there's the stags and all
[1:29:24] you know up there they call it the rut
[1:29:26] and the bull moose they will they will
[1:29:30] go on to train tracks that they'll take
[1:29:33] anything on and they've had plenty of
[1:29:35] records of trains because there's a
[1:29:38] force of life because there's a seasons
[1:29:40] right life must be expressed and they go
[1:29:43] on to the train tracks and a train comes
[1:29:45] they steer that thing down you think
[1:29:48] that's insane no its life its life
[1:29:50] wanting to you know take anything on to
[1:29:53] produce itself and they'll take on
[1:29:55] trains you know the you know the end of
[1:29:57] the story but it happens because life
[1:30:00] has a force that's just nice just animal
[1:30:03] life how much more supernatural life I
[1:30:06] mean how much more the life of God and
[1:30:08] the people Alleluia so the so the earth
[1:30:12] comes closer the soil temperature raises
[1:30:15] because the sun is shining upon it and
[1:30:17] then now the seeds begin to come forth
[1:30:20] Ella lujah
[1:30:22] in the then the rain begins to come
[1:30:24] everything's just right and it begins to
[1:30:25] sprout up and it comes up breaks up
[1:30:28] above the soil and begins to grow up
[1:30:31] I mean grow towards the one that's
[1:30:33] giving it life hallelujah and it's the
[1:30:36] same thing with you and I one time we're
[1:30:38] in darkness I think God begins to speak
[1:30:40] that's why the gospel is more than just
[1:30:42] words I mean but the Spirit of God
[1:30:44] transcends just language I mean where
[1:30:48] God can speak to someone in a
[1:30:50] supernatural way that even they do not
[1:30:52] understand you know when you begin to
[1:30:54] think why am I being pulled this way why
[1:30:57] why is it speaking to my heart this way
[1:30:59] and you can't even put it in words or
[1:31:01] language or even and but it's that life
[1:31:04] that's wanting to come up hallelujah
[1:31:07] there's a life waiting to come up amen
[1:31:10] that's why it's a supernatural gospel
[1:31:12] people try and reason it out and
[1:31:14] understand it intellectually you'll
[1:31:16] never understand it intellectually it
[1:31:18] takes God it takes God to quicken it to
[1:31:21] you to make it a living reality and then
[1:31:23] so now the seats come up so he so he
[1:31:28] moves upon the face of the waters and
[1:31:30] God said let there be light and there
[1:31:31] was light sorry Genesis 1 and 4 and God
[1:31:33] saw the light nur was good and God
[1:31:35] divided the day from the darkness and
[1:31:37] God called the light day the darkness he
[1:31:39] called night and the evening in the
[1:31:40] morning were the first day
[1:31:42] and God said let there be a firmament in
[1:31:44] the midst of the waters and let the and
[1:31:45] let it divide the waters from the waters
[1:31:47] and God made the firmament and divided
[1:31:50] the waters which were under the
[1:31:51] firmament from the waters which were
[1:31:52] above the firmament is so and God called
[1:31:55] the firmament heaven and the evening in
[1:31:58] the morning were the second day
[1:31:59] now he has a purpose to it in doing
[1:32:01] these things right and God said let the
[1:32:04] waters under the heaven be gathered
[1:32:05] together into one place and let dry land
[1:32:07] appear and it was so and God called the
[1:32:10] dry land earth and gathered together of
[1:32:13] the waters called he seas and God saw it
[1:32:16] was good and God said let the earth
[1:32:19] bring forth grass and herb yielding seed
[1:32:22] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[1:32:24] his kind whose seed was in itself upon
[1:32:27] the earth and it was so and the earth
[1:32:30] brought forth grass and herb yielding
[1:32:31] seed after his kind and the tree
[1:32:34] yielding fruit who see
[1:32:35] was in itself after his kind and God saw
[1:32:38] it was good so the seeds that were
[1:32:40] laying down there in darkness hallelujah
[1:32:43] when the light shot and God separated
[1:32:45] the light from the darkness life came
[1:32:47] forth
[1:32:48] I mean God is the author of life he
[1:32:51] wants life to be expressed Amen it's the
[1:32:54] same thing with you or not he doesn't
[1:32:55] just want us to express natural life we
[1:32:57] have this natural life but it's not the
[1:32:59] real life he wants us to bring fall is a
[1:33:01] supernatural life I mean there's a
[1:33:04] there's a life of the word that he wants
[1:33:06] us to manifest amen
[1:33:08] eternal life that once was with the
[1:33:11] father's manifested unto us we've seen
[1:33:13] it yes hallelujah you say well it's a
[1:33:18] bit hard to he says a bit harsh to talk
[1:33:21] about the wheat and the tares don't take
[1:33:23] the negative side it's like you know
[1:33:26] Hebrews six and seven for the earth with
[1:33:28] drinketh and the rain that cometh upon
[1:33:30] it and bringeth forth herbes meat for
[1:33:32] them by whom it has dressed receiveth
[1:33:34] blessing from God but that which Bharath
[1:33:37] thorns and briers is rejected as 9 -
[1:33:39] cursing whose end is to be burnt but
[1:33:41] beloved we are persuaded better things
[1:33:43] of you and things that accompany
[1:33:45] accompany salvation through though we
[1:33:48] thus speak so don't don't take the
[1:33:51] negative sight take the positive side of
[1:33:53] it if I'm a wheat I'm a wheat hallelujah
[1:33:56] I cannot be anything that I'm not I mean
[1:34:00] so so remember the Spirit of God that
[1:34:02] broods over us the word that quickens us
[1:34:05] and it's just bringing forth What's in
[1:34:07] you hallelujah so don't take it as a
[1:34:10] negative thing take it as a positive
[1:34:11] thing I can't help being what I am I
[1:34:14] mean you say well what about my humanity
[1:34:16] wrestling just yield give it over
[1:34:19] just give it over to God because a seed
[1:34:21] it must die and rot the Pope must die
[1:34:23] and right about then the seed comes
[1:34:25] forth Alleluia
[1:34:28] it is just revealing what is in us amen
[1:34:33] God has so many children now whosoever
[1:34:38] will let them come we know that but God
[1:34:41] has great by knows who's going to be
[1:34:42] there and all that the father has given
[1:34:45] me will come to me so he has so many
[1:34:48] and he knows where they are amen and if
[1:34:51] you're part of that number I we should
[1:34:54] be the most happiest people in the land
[1:34:56] hallelujah
[1:34:57] even if we are homeless on the street
[1:34:59] I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them
[1:35:02] hallelujah because it's eternal not just
[1:35:06] natural things amen life that can be
[1:35:09] manifested I mean brother Brahim says
[1:35:15] and he sees him one in a million when
[1:35:20] God moved upon the water with light the
[1:35:22] light brought forth the first presence
[1:35:24] of God spoken light came by God's Word
[1:35:26] and God's Word is the only thing that
[1:35:29] still brings light and when the waters
[1:35:31] went back the seed was already in the
[1:35:32] earth and the light only brought forth
[1:35:34] the seeds that remained with German them
[1:35:37] come forth God making his creation and
[1:35:40] now on Easter morning there was another
[1:35:42] light struck the earth now is going from
[1:35:44] natural Genesis when he's going to
[1:35:46] Easter morning because that was a
[1:35:48] natural light in the beginning now
[1:35:49] there's a supernatural light yeah and
[1:35:53] it's given to bring light to those seeds
[1:35:56] that God by his foreknowledge knew would
[1:35:59] be here on the earth as he knew the
[1:36:01] first natural seat he knows where the
[1:36:04] spiritual Cedars your body was laying
[1:36:06] right here on the earth when God brought
[1:36:08] forth the earth into existence we are
[1:36:11] part of the earth we you were laying
[1:36:13] here your bodies were and by his
[1:36:15] foreknowledge he knew exactly who would
[1:36:17] love him and who would serve Him and who
[1:36:19] had not his foreknowledge tells that if
[1:36:21] it doesn't then he isn't God he can't be
[1:36:24] God without being infinite and if he's
[1:36:26] infinite he knows all things
[1:36:27] so you see God making so you see people
[1:36:30] making their blunders they stumble at it
[1:36:33] they run at it they think this and that
[1:36:35] but it doesn't work right you see but
[1:36:37] there is a working right that's to find
[1:36:40] God's perfect will and stand in it that
[1:36:42] God called you for me but God has not
[1:36:45] called us to wrath but God's called us
[1:36:48] to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ
[1:36:50] hallelujah
[1:36:53] he speaks you know Easter I'm gonna I'm
[1:36:56] gonna jump eternal life was released
[1:37:00] that day on Cobra eternal life and but
[1:37:04] he was eternal life was manifested but
[1:37:07] it wasn't the purpose of God becoming a
[1:37:09] man to die on the cross for our sins
[1:37:12] wasn't it was to it was to clear our
[1:37:16] selves our sin to wipe us of asset but
[1:37:19] it wasn't just that now we are forgiven
[1:37:20] but he had a purpose of that is because
[1:37:23] now he wanted to cleanse of people that
[1:37:25] he can come and dwell in and manifest
[1:37:27] themselves I mean many people talk about
[1:37:29] the cross but what is the cross to
[1:37:31] produce I mean in the cross was to
[1:37:34] produce the upper room when the Holy
[1:37:36] Spirit came down and dwelled in 120 and
[1:37:39] then it spread from there that was the
[1:37:41] purpose of the cross hallelujah so now
[1:37:44] now so as a natural light a light brings
[1:37:48] forth a natural seat so a supernatural
[1:37:50] light or life brings for the
[1:37:52] supernatural seat so now on that first
[1:37:55] sunrise and the very beginning let there
[1:37:57] be light and there was light
[1:37:58] go forth natural see lujah but then now
[1:38:01] that that day of the Resurrection amen
[1:38:05] a supernatural light begin to shine at
[1:38:09] the rising of the Sun hallelujah a new
[1:38:13] life was coming in a new era is being
[1:38:15] ushered in there wasn't just God with us
[1:38:18] or God above us it was God in us the
[1:38:20] Holy Spirit under people I mean to
[1:38:22] manifest remember in the Old Testament
[1:38:24] it was just God with them or God would
[1:38:26] anoint them because of the blood of
[1:38:28] bulls and goats God couldn't step until
[1:38:29] people like he does you and I I mean but
[1:38:32] under the blood of Jesus Christ he's not
[1:38:34] just with us or anointing as he comes in
[1:38:37] dwells in us I mean that now there's a
[1:38:39] quickening of a seat hallelujah you know
[1:38:43] we're not a bunch of dead people
[1:38:44] we're not a bunch of religious people I
[1:38:47] mean we don't just have a different code
[1:38:49] of ethics or a different bunch of
[1:38:50] doctrine but there's a life this this is
[1:38:53] a record of eternal life hallelujah and
[1:38:56] it's not just to read about saying isn't
[1:38:58] that lovely
[1:38:59] I say god this record of eternal life we
[1:39:02] must become part of it amen and
[1:39:05] I'll just jump to a hole but later on
[1:39:09] why why is this would become a living
[1:39:12] reality to you I may ask you a question
[1:39:15] you got a Luke chapter 24 you know maybe
[1:39:20] I'll just jump back a bit we read about
[1:39:23] a rapture in here we read about eternal
[1:39:26] life changing the bodies of a people we
[1:39:29] worried about now that people walk with
[1:39:31] God they're not because God takes them I
[1:39:32] mean that there's a winning supper of
[1:39:34] the Lamb
[1:39:35] where she is she has made herself ready
[1:39:38] because unto her was granted should be
[1:39:40] arrayed in fine linen clean and what I
[1:39:42] mean so that cities the people these are
[1:39:44] redeemed people that are gathered to a
[1:39:47] wedding supper of the Lamb now those
[1:39:50] things sound very glorious how do you
[1:39:53] know you're part of that number I'll
[1:39:56] show you a little bit now eternal life
[1:39:59] was released that day Jesus stepped down
[1:40:02] the tomb you just think about it as I
[1:40:04] said a while ago and I'll come back to
[1:40:06] my thought he's a force behind life he's
[1:40:09] a force I was talking about him just a
[1:40:12] natural move you take a supernatural
[1:40:14] life do you think they tried to seal
[1:40:16] Jesus body in a tomb he said Mary Oh
[1:40:20] Martha I am the resurrection and the
[1:40:22] life
[1:40:22] believeth in your brother there he did
[1:40:24] he shall live believeth all of us hila
[1:40:27] there was suit that was eternal life
[1:40:29] manifested and they tried to seal it in
[1:40:31] a natural tomb with some natural
[1:40:33] soldiers amen he couldn't be contained
[1:40:36] earlier he had to come out of the tomb
[1:40:38] and there's the same thing and then they
[1:40:40] try and put pressure on the disciples
[1:40:43] don't preach in his name anymore don't
[1:40:45] don't preach this word don't live this
[1:40:47] life they just basically laughed in
[1:40:50] their faces should we obey God or obey
[1:40:52] you
[1:40:53] if a man nothing could hold them I mean
[1:40:56] they tried to put conflict beat them put
[1:40:58] complexes on they just had a prayer
[1:41:00] meeting God came down and gave them
[1:41:01] boldness they went out because life had
[1:41:04] to go for hallelujah and so they
[1:41:06] couldn't be contained it's the same
[1:41:09] thing with you and I trust there should
[1:41:11] be such a force in you should be a life
[1:41:13] I'm this must have been the smashed par
[1:41:17] lujah and nothing
[1:41:18] devil contrived put on me it's gonna
[1:41:19] stop me no matter concrete no matter
[1:41:22] complex is know about affair it's going
[1:41:24] to stop this life
[1:41:25] Alleluia should be that way because of
[1:41:29] something and you driving you amen so
[1:41:32] now here's the here's eternal life has
[1:41:34] been released
[1:41:34] it's 2 on the way to Emmaus they knew
[1:41:37] the prophecy of Joel I'll pour my spirit
[1:41:39] out upon all flesh they believed he was
[1:41:42] the Messiah they were walking away
[1:41:44] saying here he comes
[1:41:46] walks with them Luke 24 remember it's
[1:41:49] the time of Resurrection we're in the
[1:41:50] time of resurrection - how lujah well
[1:41:52] the resurrection that was what a
[1:41:54] resurrection this earth where our people
[1:41:56] that were dead in trespasses and sins
[1:41:57] just a bunch of dead sages come to life
[1:41:59] valley because there's the light of God
[1:42:01] a shock hallelujah amen so now they're
[1:42:05] walking along and they said their whole
[1:42:07] world's falling apart the one they
[1:42:09] believed was the Messiah we believe you
[1:42:10] deliver Israel these days they you know
[1:42:14] Judas who was the accountant of the
[1:42:16] church hung himself and all the all the
[1:42:20] ministry have locked themselves up
[1:42:21] someplace we'll just go home now they
[1:42:26] had no idea that they were part of the
[1:42:29] resurrection also wasn't just him
[1:42:32] raising as 120 had to raise and then the
[1:42:36] life had to go forth remember it was not
[1:42:38] just one resurrection morning earlier
[1:42:41] but now resurrection life begin to be
[1:42:42] spread upon the earth holy or that
[1:42:45] sunlight was shining
[1:42:46] hallelujah Jesus when He said preaching
[1:42:50] Jerusalem and in Samaria to the
[1:42:51] uttermost part of the earth he could
[1:42:53] basically said shine this light in
[1:42:55] Jerusalem and Samaria and to the other
[1:42:58] most part of the earth tell the people
[1:43:00] the sun's up a leader quicken them so
[1:43:04] they're so they're part of the
[1:43:05] resurrection and the whole world's
[1:43:07] falling apart now Jesus came walked with
[1:43:11] them started at Moses you can open up
[1:43:14] the word to them
[1:43:15] amen and then when they came into the
[1:43:18] house you know the story but what is he
[1:43:20] doing he's trying to get them to see by
[1:43:22] by by speaking the word to them in that
[1:43:24] way and then at the end of it they said
[1:43:26] did not our hearts burn within us as he
[1:43:29] spoke to us along the way so it's more
[1:43:31] than just information something was
[1:43:32] going to hear something was quickening
[1:43:35] to them I mean something is becoming
[1:43:37] alive and he was doing that because he's
[1:43:40] wanting to tell the people you're part
[1:43:41] of the vision you're part of the
[1:43:43] resurrection you're part of the
[1:43:45] fulfillment of the word for this hour I
[1:43:46] mean that's what he's trying to tell
[1:43:48] them that's why when we read we read
[1:43:50] about David coming into power who loves
[1:43:52] the Old Testament amen you see David
[1:43:55] yo-yo being rejected he's anointed king
[1:43:57] and is there men to gather term all that
[1:44:00] are destitute afflicted and told me to
[1:44:01] whatever they give themselves to David
[1:44:03] and something in you says that's such a
[1:44:05] glorious thing why is it quit wise to
[1:44:08] speak to your soul why doesn't that's
[1:44:10] because God is trying to get you to see
[1:44:12] you've seen David Christ because
[1:44:16] remember he he's just a shadow Jesus
[1:44:18] Christ his reality you see he's a
[1:44:20] fugitive on the land Amen you see he's
[1:44:23] run out from every place but you see he
[1:44:26] know he's coming into power you know
[1:44:29] he's going to sit on the throne in the
[1:44:30] Millenium Alleluia and you've gathered
[1:44:33] yourself to him hallelujah
[1:44:35] I mean you've gathered yourself to him
[1:44:37] and then that same anointing that fell
[1:44:39] upon David to kill the lion and the bear
[1:44:40] and Goliath you know what David had five
[1:44:43] stones there are other giants in the
[1:44:44] land too so he knew remember it's faith
[1:44:47] in Jesus all those things but he knew if
[1:44:49] I have to kill them all well hey we just
[1:44:51] can't have a longer day he he said the
[1:44:57] king Saul this John will be like those
[1:44:59] animals they'll be dead seen you
[1:45:02] whatever would stand in his way is going
[1:45:03] to die
[1:45:04] and it did hallelujah and these are
[1:45:07] those ones that gave themselves to David
[1:45:09] that same anointing came upon them
[1:45:12] hallelujah so they one killed a hundred
[1:45:14] hundred odd and no they did great feats
[1:45:16] of things it's not Hollywood it's not
[1:45:19] choreographed battle scenes the guy with
[1:45:21] a sword or a spear he just pushes a
[1:45:24] whole bunch of soldiers why because the
[1:45:26] supernatural God you want to see that
[1:45:28] life you know we talk about a lineage I
[1:45:30] mean a you know a natural genes being
[1:45:33] expressed down through you take a
[1:45:34] supernatural lineage you see God in
[1:45:37] battle I mean you see Samson he's tied
[1:45:40] up the Israelites are going to give him
[1:45:42] to the Philistines this is the
[1:45:44] Philistines shouted and the Spirit of
[1:45:46] God came upon him mightily holy he broke
[1:45:49] the bans picked up the jawbone and
[1:45:51] killed a thousand or however many it
[1:45:53] were I mean you see the life of God in
[1:45:55] battle
[1:45:55] Harley when the enemy comes in like a
[1:45:58] flood amen he anoints his children who's
[1:46:00] had the experience I have many anointest
[1:46:03] children to defeat that phone hallelujah
[1:46:07] Lenya is coming into power they same
[1:46:09] anointing fell upon me and here we are
[1:46:12] we see this word coming into power we
[1:46:15] know that our lovely Lord Jesus is going
[1:46:17] to be on the throne hallelujah that same
[1:46:19] anointing was on him come upon us I'm in
[1:46:21] the same anointing upon the Prophet the
[1:46:23] ridi is a redeemed son revealing Jesus
[1:46:25] Christ that same son of man not the
[1:46:28] Prophet he's a son of man the son of man
[1:46:30] that came into well to them revealed
[1:46:31] himself that same one steps into us
[1:46:34] I mean that's why we see when the enemy
[1:46:36] comes around
[1:46:37] Allu you amen when the enemy comes
[1:46:41] around we're still in faith they were
[1:46:43] overcoming hallelujah the enemy is
[1:46:46] defeated we have a lot of trophies
[1:46:48] hallelujah why because that same
[1:46:50] anointing cause you know he's coming
[1:46:51] into power
[1:46:52] amen and so but why is that all done
[1:46:55] that you would know your part what there
[1:46:57] wasn't a shadow is now reality in this
[1:46:59] day
[1:47:00] Allu you where you can see now and the
[1:47:03] reason it speaks do you like it does is
[1:47:04] because God wants you to know you're
[1:47:06] part of the vision you're part of the
[1:47:08] word being fulfilled
[1:47:10] I mean well what is going to be
[1:47:12] fulfilled is gonna be a rapture a
[1:47:13] wedding supper hallelujah is going to be
[1:47:17] a millennial reign
[1:47:18] I mean where Jesus Christ is going to
[1:47:20] sit on as a son of David on the throne
[1:47:22] and is bright around him whatever Moors
[1:47:24] in the millennium and all that see all
[1:47:27] these things become real to you because
[1:47:29] you're gonna be there
[1:47:31] hallelujah you following me
[1:47:34] amen brother speaks about upon lily is
[1:47:43] that how can I overcome he speaks about
[1:47:44] a pond lily now pond lily it's very
[1:47:47] beautiful when it comes above the water
[1:47:49] and opens itself up to the Sun but
[1:47:52] before that it's just a little cedar
[1:47:53] under the mud under water but there's
[1:47:56] something within it that knows it cannot
[1:47:59] stay in that condition there's something
[1:48:02] in it that must grow it must push beyond
[1:48:05] the mud it must go beyond the water it
[1:48:08] must come above the water
[1:48:09] they'd open itself out to manifest
[1:48:11] what's really in it there's a life and
[1:48:14] the thing I can't just sit down the mud
[1:48:15] say well it's too deep I can't make it
[1:48:18] you know it doesn't consciously think
[1:48:21] but you know what I mean don't just so
[1:48:22] they say well the muds too heavy it's
[1:48:24] you know I can't I there's just
[1:48:26] something and it just opens up and it
[1:48:28] pushes forth hallelujah I trust that's
[1:48:32] the same with you how can I overcome
[1:48:36] it's just like a lily where as a lily I
[1:48:39] think it's one of the most prettiest
[1:48:41] flowers there is I'm very fond of those
[1:48:43] great calla lilies upon the lease I
[1:48:46] think there's nothing hardly as pretty
[1:48:49] as a great big pond Lily call it water
[1:48:51] lily how its radiance where did it come
[1:48:53] from it's a little seed down the bottom
[1:48:56] of a muddy mucky pond and that little
[1:48:59] seed yet all the radiance that'll ever
[1:49:01] shine in it is in it right then when
[1:49:04] it's in that mud amen
[1:49:07] but it has to strive daily knowing that
[1:49:10] there's something it's black it's dirty
[1:49:13] it's mucky it's slimy in that slime
[1:49:15] that's living in yet it presses its way
[1:49:17] through the mud the muck and the waters
[1:49:19] and the stagnant places until it sticks
[1:49:22] its head above and the light and
[1:49:23] expresses what's been hitting it all the
[1:49:26] time I think that's an overcomer that
[1:49:29] once and sin once the things that was
[1:49:32] wrong don't worry about it now see he
[1:49:34] says once the things that was wrong now
[1:49:37] why look back into the pond again look
[1:49:40] you have God by His predestination sea
[1:49:42] has brought the seed of life and
[1:49:44] expressing itself seed coming to life
[1:49:47] and now on top of all that it has
[1:49:49] overcome that don't express itself down
[1:49:56] there it's getting up it's getting up to
[1:49:58] express itself neither did you and your
[1:50:01] son an adultery and everything that you
[1:50:02] lived that you didn't express nothing
[1:50:04] but there was a seed in there and it got
[1:50:07] a chance to press itself into life and
[1:50:10] now you're in the prints of Jesus Christ
[1:50:12] with the sunlight it's brought out what
[1:50:14] you really was in the beginning you see
[1:50:17] what I mean

[1:50:53] shine that life will come forth a little
[1:50:56] seed laying back in the middle of the
[1:50:58] sidewalk will press its way around out
[1:51:00] through that concrete / around under
[1:51:02] rocks and sticks and everything else
[1:51:04] till it gets out it sticks its little
