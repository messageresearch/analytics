so let's just um um do you have that really i mean i trust everyone's well doesn't matter what battle you're going through it as well why because that sin question was settled hallelujah it's all's well amen so god bless you all i mean you can have your seats if you if you so wish remember the word of god is just as fresh today as it was when it was preached so don't look at the calendar date say lord speak to me amen you know there's um you may have said i've heard this a hundred times but sometimes it's a hundred and first time that really anchors in you know so you may have heard it a hundred times but 101 hallelujah amen to god bless you wow anyone see that okay so his ways are past finding out aren't you wonderful lord how sweet it is the trusting i'm just sure you've had a wonderful time tonight just opening the door there a few moments ago and hearing sister gertie saying that old song keep holding on just one more hour brought back memories of a my little church when it was just before i left the other time to go into the fields of mission work i'm looking out at a sick god first here in front across this old beam i remember sandy davidson painted that on there about 25 years ago on the other side i think it's got where will you spend eternity think right here was uh a woman at the web daniel in the lines oh my many things has happened since then just about five o'clock this afternoon i got emergency call to come about 30 40 miles down the country here of a dying woman and a very precious friend georgie carter's mother and i knew there was plenty of ministers here to hold who i got back edith has been very bad too and while we were there the lord god moved on the scene and sister carter is a long ways from dying so so we're grateful for that and now it's getting time for communion service pretty soon i think it's about 12 o'clock when they go to what time have you designated to give it any time [Applause] just any time that we harmonies to take communion tonight let's see your hands that's all that's wonderful all right i want to speak just a word or two maybe i'll lay my watch out here for about 10 minutes 15 we'll start communion now do you love me amen and i know you've had a great time having him well if you're a brother thomas kids and sister kids all the way down from ohio i guess they've been up oh that's fine hope it's on tape and i'll get it you know they don't give up they're just a few days under 100 but but that's what keeps me courageous if they see people like that think but i'm an old man and before i was born he was preaching the gospel and then here i am an old man and they if they can't get out and make their voice ring out they just take a tape recorder and go in the hospital how's the house preaching the gospel that's mighty fine amen i'm sure happy for them and for all those who's anticipated and this the services sherry now remember we'll announce it now the lord willing just as soon as the church is finished which they claim will be about the 10th of february why where the lord willing we want to take at least eight or ten or days or maybe two weeks on those seven seals of revelations and uh we'll sound out cards to our visiting people from around from home here and let them know uh plenty time ahead so if they take an ocean to come well we sure be glad to have you here and maybe the lord will give us another display of his presence like he did the last time when we got through the seven church ages do you ever want to pray for somebody why remember me all the time because i'm one who really needs it now i'm kind of shamed myself to take up these 10 15 minutes here to say a little something before we start but let's bow our heads just a moment lord jesus yes oh the battle will be over someday and there will be no more sick to be prayed for and there will be no more sinners to repent but father while this day is what it is let us work while we have life to work in for the hour cometh when no man can work now for just a few moments lord i'd feel bad if i did i closed off this year without saying a few more words help me father i pray and i might say something that would play courage in the heart of thy people that we could leave here tonight after taking the communion and we realize that in the communion there is strength israel took the communion first down in egypt and walked 40 years without those shoes wearing out are their clothes getting threadbare and out of two million people there was no feeble one among them when they come out of the wilderness lord let us remember that tonight as we approach this great hour in jesus name we pray amen if i should speak the context that i had wrote down that i was going to start on this afternoon i would be here five o'clock in the morning but i want to read just a word from thank you from ephesians the 6th chapter 12 first and just for a few moments now that for courage for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places spiritual wickedness in high places and i'd like to draw from that a little uh 10 or 15 minutes context or a text brother i want to call it the contest a contest is a test of strength and we um where we have a the uh test strength we used to have the idioms used to put a fire and they would put so many man on this end of the rope and so many on this end and the tug of war the contest of strength would pull the losing party across the fire and now uh we know there's many things and we could base this up on for a few minutes of of contest but i want to speak for these minutes quickly upon the greatest contest there is that's between the church and satan that great strength of satan and we want to speak of the great strength of god in his church now this great contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven and satan was kicked out into the earth and then he become an enemy to god's people and since then he's used all of his strength and his strategy to try to pull god's people across the fires or into his fires and we know that who has the most power god does amen and god when he gave his people the best thing that he could to combat satan with was his word now because the word is god and who's stronger than god so the word is god and the word becomes our strength god in the church becomes his strength to pull satan to his own fathers amen that he is made and the tug goes on now jesus said in mark 16 in my name they shall cast out devils now i know that's an old uh uh saying that people or there is an old saying that and it's not so old either people don't believe in demons in this day but the thing to do to my opinion is know your enemy and and know your enemy and train uh for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him amen because you're going to meet him and knowing no is know what his strength is and then train for this contest when you do meet him or it's one thing sure you're going to meet him and so you train for the contest now training for a contest is just like a boxer his uh his uh enemy that he's going to meet out there in a contest to fight a real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent studies his licks knows where he fights for worthy leans forward hangs back fights right-handed or left-handed he studies all this and then if he's a good smart fighter he gets him a sparring partner that'll fight just like his opponent fights for he'll know all these licks when he gets to that place and i think that's a very good thing for christians to do that's right and now if you want to start training start with john 3 16 the golden rule start right out with that and that'll get you on the floor and then train for the for the knockout punches because you're going to have to use them everybody knows that you have to train to hit your enemy and always god uses his words we must remember that god uses his word to defeat his enemy if god could think or could have give his people anything better to defeat the enemy with he would have done it so as i've always said when god makes a decision that's the best that there is he never has to alter his decisions so the first decision god gave his people in the garden of eden to combat the enemy was his word they were fortified with his word and now the enemy is going to study the are a strategy with the word and now satan studied that all out so perfectly though when he come to eve he had the best of strategy he could use up on her and that was to reason with the word now you never want to reason with god's word just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out now you cannot figure out god so god is the word and it's just made to believe and that's our strength just accept the word and anyone knows that a seed in the right kind of ground will produce its kind and we just take the word and now eve began to stop to reason when he she quoted the word to him and god said you should not eat thereof for the day you eat there out that day we die and satan never disagreed with her he said certainly that's right but he said you see you need some new light something a little different from what god said and if you do do it you'll be just a little smarter your eyes will be open but she said well god said we would die said oh surely see there you come just that much surely you won't die but god said you would and that settles it and that that broke that great tug of war then and pull the whole human race into death because eve listened to a reasoning against god's word now it's a shame that she did it but it's done past but now we're still fortified and that link was made up in christ jesus we know that god gave us our best defense just simply to trust his word you know in many say today that there is no such a thing as a devil ah they believe that it's just simply a thought they believe that and there's people that believe that that at the holy spirit is a good thought and the devil is a bad thought but if you notice when the bible speaks of the holy spirit he said when he the holy spirit has come and he's a personal pronoun see so he he is a person and the devil is a person and demons are persons amen yes they are demons and they they come in many ways but they think it's an old fashioned idea man was arguing me here a few weeks ago he said you know what you do you just set those people's mind to thinking something when you uh uh tell them that thing it's just a change of thought i met that very same thing in india one time one of those holy man there where we had i believe the largest audience i ever spoke to in one standing audience had been a half million people and i caught it by discernment in the spirit and they would see the holy spirit call people and call them out into the audiences and tell different things and catching their thought the rage olds and the holy man they said he's reading their mind so a few moments about five or six it passed through the prayer line and a blind man come through and he was totally blind and his eyes were as white as my shirt and i said now here is a blind man anyone can see he's blind and i said if i could help him i would do so but the only way i could do would be by a gift to maybe say something that he has done and that would give thought that if god knows what he has done he certainly will know what he's going to do so i said now looking at him i said now he's a worshiper of the son he's been blind 20 years and when the interpreter said it that was right i said he's a married man his wife is rather small and he has two sons one about seven one nine that was exactly right called their names what it was then out in the audience in the place where the people were there come that wave in its mental it's uh something on the order of of a psychic reading of their mind that i thought lord if you'll just help me i need your help lord these people are trying to places of telepathy and it's not and you know it lord yet i've given the scripture that's jesus said he did nothing until the father showed him and then turning to look at the man again i saw him just above there in a vision with just as good eyes as i am oh now is the time i said this man is a worshiper of the son now and he's gone blind i said now the there's the priest and there's the the priest of the sikhs jains and the different types of religion buddha now this man wants to receive his sight now you would say that he worshipped the creation instead of the creator i believe that too but here we set tonight i said and we've been today i was entertained in the james temple where 17 different religions was there to interview me and every one of them against christ everyone and i said now and many you men was down there now if christ is so wrong then this man wants to be right and surely the god of creation who made the world will be the only one who can give him his sight that's reasonable and i said now if any of you people the mohammed in here is the leading religion if the priests will come here and give him his sight then i'll follow or if the buddha priests will come give him his sign but let the god who made him the god somebody's got somewhere because there has to be amen we can't have a creation without a creator and it'll take a creator to create sight in his eyes he's been blind 20 years from looking at the sun thinking he'd go to heaven if he didn't a man ignorantly done that i said what would you buda priest do you just change his way of thinking you say he's wrong they worship their dead ancestors now i said now uh you'd think he was you'd say he was wrong but what would you do you change his way of thinking now i said what would the do change his way of thinking the six genes and so forth change your way of thinking i said we have the same thing in the united states the methodists all want to make all the baptists become methodists and the pentecostal wants to take all the methodists and make them pentecostals it's a change of thought but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about god the creator amen and i said surely the creator would speak and i wouldn't have said that if that vision hadn't been there by no means now i said now if the one that let him be god come give him his sight now i said now i challenge any priest or rachel or holy man or any of what it might be come giving me sight and i'll follow your philosophy you've made a convert that is the quietest bunch of people i ever heard nobody didn't i said what you so quiet about i said the reason you are is because you can't do it and neither can i but the god of heaven who raised up his son jesus christ whose servant we are has just showed me a vision that the man's going to receive his sights i said now if that beasts not so then you can order me out of india but if it is so every one of you owe your life to jesus christ i would like to ask you how many in here will give your life to christ if this blind man receives his sign you see your priest nobody comes up here why don't they come if they've told you the religion is so big and so great why don't somebody come and say something nobody come i said then you people out there if you see this blind man standing here and i've come a doctor to examine his eyes he shook his head he said he's blind and so i said certainly he's blind but i said if if god gives him his sight how many of you will serve jesus christ just as far as i could see uh oceans of black hands turned to the man and said lord jesus let it be known to dark god the man grabbed me around the neck and there set the mayor of bombay sitting there grabbed him around next see as good as anybody could what is it it's uh it's actually a power amen god is god and satan is satan if you don't believe in the devil when i first got started i i run headlong into him every day don't tell me there's no devil because i know better amen i have to fight with him every day so i know there's there is a devil and you must be trained when you're bleeding not trained in psychology not trained in education but trained by the holy spirit god's power in his word to make it manifest know your enemy oh what a cruel thing he is how i would like to stand here now and lay on to that go back to the bible and show you a man back there who come face to face with how in the contest against the enemy they fortified themselves by the word of god noah had an experience of it and he knew that god told him was going to reign and the contest was all between science and the word of god science says it can't happen god said it will happen amen hey man that same thing exists today it will happen it does happen and he gave his church authority to do so cast out devils in my name he cast seven devils out of a pretty woman one day and he said when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walks into our places returning back then bringing seven other devils with him now that goes to show that if the man was cleaned off devils there was something was in him that had gone out a devil had gone out hallelujah out when the devil moved out that god gives god an opportunity to move in amen amen so and when he goes out let the holy spirit come in don't just leave it there if you do just repent of your sins and go on then you're going to be worse off than ever but get that place where satan once lived and occupied get it filled with the holy spirit of god and that you'll have the strength of god's word in you manifested in cast out devils contest is amen the evening lights are shining god's holy spirit is present and now it's just about about three minutes until the time that the whistles are going to be blowing and it will be midnight then as we leave this building to go to our different places in our homes and to meet outside and to meet the world let's not go as we have in former times amen let's go in the power of his resurrection let's go in the name of jesus christ with a banner lifted high and with faith in his word to handle the two eighth sword with the shield and the full armor of god on to beat the enemy because he's getting stronger and more powerful every day as a as the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises up a standard against him if we have come to the end of these things that we and the mysteries of god has been completed with us we are looking for more strength a rapture and strength i mean a diverse force that rapture the church and take it in the glory we must have it hey let's meet 63 with the challenge we are the servants of the living god amen i'm like shadrach meshach and abednego of all will not bow to the devils of this world take back this thing that what we've talked about but let's press the battle amen field tonight as we're listening for them whistles something like david did that dreadful hot night when he laid out there in their mulberry bushes and the enemies are routing what an hour it must have been for david what a time for him laying there he didn't know how to move he didn't know what to go by because he knowed he was outnumbered but all at once he heard the sound of a wind going through the top of the bushes he know god went on before him and he went to the battle i feel something like that tonight after last night's message i'm making the darkest hour that i ever faced in my life i feel like isaiah at the temple after seeing those angels i'm a man of unclean lips and dwelling among people with unclean lips but listen uh i'm i've got to meet it somewhere you know the only thing i'm waiting to hear that rushing to the mulberry bushes to go to meet the enemy wherever it is god help us to do it and now i think it's one minute until 12 o'clock and uh 62 with all of its uh pass let's let it be past let us stand to our feet now each and every one of us the context is on hallelujah [Applause] each one of you paul said for getting those things that are in the past the all our mistakes of last year i pressed
