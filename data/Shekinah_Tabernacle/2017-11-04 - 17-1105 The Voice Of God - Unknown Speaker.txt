amen amen thank you musicians Alleluia amen god bless you all amen we have that slideshow I mean I trust you all well amen you can't lose being a Christian I mean let's go to Genesis chapter 3 and we'll read verses 7 to 10 we're gonna read down to actually um yeah we're gonna read a bit here if you don't mind it and we got a few portions of Scripture to read but god bless you all it's great to have everyone here I mean it's always wonderful to see everyone you know it really means something I mean blessed be the ties that bind our hearts and Christian love they mean so praise the Lord so Genesis 3 you in familiar portion of scripture I'm sure to to us all but let's read here Genesis 3 and we'll start from verse 7 well we have that thank you it says here now and the eyes of them were opened as Adam and Eve and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden so notice how says they heard the voice of the Lord walking walking in the garden and the call of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and then we go the next one sorry and in from and the in verse 11 says and any god bless you and he said who told thee that thou was naked how sour eaten of the tree which I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman's the serpent beguiled me and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the zoomit serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon my belly thou shalt go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of their life and I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and to the woman he said I'll greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy and my conception and sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and our doubt by there's a desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto enemy he said because thou has hearken unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life I'm going to drop down to verse 20 and Adam called us his wife's name Eve because she was she was the mother of all living and to Adam also into his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe him and the Lord God said Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand to take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden - till the ground from which they were taken Amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning now we've got a few other places to read but I want you to notice there's a reason why why God came down in the garden he came down sin sin entered into creation I want to speak on the voice of God today now we understand that sin came into into God's creation Adam and Eve became separated from God and then God came down and now before this happened and we know it's not eating a fruit but before this happened they would have rejoiced to hear the voice of God walking in the garden they would never have been afraid here was their father their father would come down and have fellowship with them and say you know did you enjoy your day in this place that I've made you you know have you enjoyed have you enjoyed my creation have you enjoyed it and they would have said oh yes oh isn't it lovely and you wonderful to make us a place like this isn't it wonderful that you made us you know your children isn't this a wonderful place and they would have worshipped him but but darkness sin came into the world and they heard the same voice calling for them and they were afraid and it's the same thing but remember God's God's purpose when he came down into the garden wasn't to destroy them it wasn't - it wasn't to cast them into outer darkness he had a reason he was walking in the garden I mean he knew they would fall he knows all things he knows the end from the beginning he wasn't surprised I mean of the serpent beguiled Eve the way he did and the act happened and you know he wasn't surprised he knew it would happen and then when it did happen he didn't send an angel he didn't sin maybe a cherubim or a serum or you know Gabriel he went himself he went himself into the garden polu and he had a purpose to go and his purpose wasn't to destroy his children but he was going to show I'm going to clothe you Tolu you I'm going to close you with a sacrifice I'm going to cover your sin I mean I'm going to cover what you've done hallelujah I'm going to bring reconciliation I'm in between me and you hallelujah this was his purpose amen he had to take away their fig leaf covering we know religion that the word religion actually means a covering and humanity all of humanity has some kind of religion even the atheists believe something because their science could not prove where life first was created they have to believe it by faith you know I yeah I've had discussions with many I studied biochemistry at university I I studied the origin of life for a little bit as part of one of my courses and I would say well the the laws of chemistry actually stop life forming how you say it did and they said no we're not talking about when the first you know precursors to amino acids que yo yo came together we're not talking about that we're talking about when cells begin to go single-cell things begin to evolve when multiple and create higher life but I said but you can't start here you got to go back here what happened in the beginning because if you can't if you don't know what happened here then you've got to believe something happened to get you to this point so they all everyone believed something I mean everyone believed something and so so if one has a covering everyone has a covering and it's man-made let's put the fig leaves together Adam Eve that's a good idea list I don't know who who had the idea but let's let's arrange it in our way but then when the voice of God came they realized they're covering didn't do any good they still had fear it didn't cover up the act it didn't just sweep it under the rug he can't sweep anything under the rug I mean when you come into the presence of God I mean all of your life was exposed but he does it for a reason because he doesn't want you just to her carry a bunch of guilt and shame but he wants to take it from you I mean take it off I'll take it hallelujah I took up Calvary hallelujah USA yes Lord I've accepted it Amen it's a pardon I meant pardoning grace hallelujah you got to accept that amen it's got to be accepted as a pardon hallelujah and then so now all of their fig leaf religion had to go wait did I turn that off ok that's fine I think I can do that yeah I can do that but thank you sorry but you know all of that had to go but God spoke to them I'm gonna cover you I'm gonna remember those skins we read there we read there he took skins let's see if we can get back to this took it says there he made coats of skins and clothed them now I believe that would have that would have been lambskins I mean I wouldn't know wouldn't have been you know anything else would have been the sacrifice I'm gonna cover you with the skins of the sacrifice how Lou your brother Brahim says you know he says when they're walking out of the garden those those lambskins beating against their legs the blood was still dripping down and there's a promise I'm going to send the seed of the woman and it's not going to be a natural lamb that's going to undo this but a man is going to come the seed of the woman is going to come I'm going to become flesh and I'm not just gonna cover your sin I'm going to annihilate your sin hallelujah and the same judgment that happened there because it narrowed down who did this then then the man said it was the woman and the woman said it was the serpent I mean in the judgment went down and then so it was it was taken off them because the guilty party the real guilty party was the serpent and it's the same thing in this day I mean sin has been revealed that we come to find out that we never did it in the first place when God thought of you before the foundation of the world I mean he didn't see you in sin and darkness I mean he saw you redeemed what's in his blood made in His image made in his likeness I mean that's that's how he saw you before the foundation of the world and then there's come a point now where we see who started at all Satan you you slicker you did it I mean you caused this to happen amen and then it will come down to the great white throne judgment where all the sin of the world we hit the pond him and he's got to go to a lake of fire hallelujah we don't have to go to their place amen I'm so glad that's the case now we we don't live in Eden but we're living in another garden this world this world is a different kind of garden this is Satan's garden it's still a garden nonetheless this is this is the best he can make and and he's made the world like this to distract you and to entice you and make you turn your heart away and follow other things but but I just so rejoice when God gets a hold of a person the devil can wave the best he has I'll give you everything but Jesus he said if you bow down worship me I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world but he said get behind me Satan because the thing is that the devil will try and give you a kingdom it may not be a nation but you may be popular in a certain group of people we may have an influence over a certain group of people and that will be your kingdom he said I'll give you this if you just bow down and worship me but there's something in the believer that says I don't want your best you can line it all up in front of me there nothing in me that wants it I want Jesus and that's all I want hallelujah cause he can change your desires of your heart I mean that all you want is him hallelujah and I know that's true cuz I've experienced that Amen God is still God is still walking the voice of God is still walking upon the earth remember the gospel is not there's not a bunch of doctrines that are not related the gospel is a person this message is a person the Bible is a person the revelation of Jesus Christ I mean to declare himself a man it's not a bunch of ideas that we that we say is this do I agree do I disagree Joe I agree he's a person a man and he's walking upon the earth to find his children I mean to cope to to take away their sins in their own covering to cover them with his righteousness hallelujah and that's more real than me standing here right now because it's an eternal thing see it's here in Revelations 3 I just took one well this is for our age but you notice at the end of every every Church age it says to lead them here to him that have an ear let him hear what the Spirit says I mean so we're going to have spiritual ears oh god I want to hear what you're saying to this age because there's a reason you're speaking and the reason that your speaker's you want to Redeemer people you want to lift them up above the darkness hallelujah that's then that's why he speaks it's not a bunch of you know there's people who who are way more fanatic about about a twenty twenty two men kicking a circular ball around a pitch they're way more fanatic about that than they then I am about my God and the world says good on me man look at me and say you're crazy no I'm not crazy I found my mind's eye you've been brainwashed I needed a washing let's pray needed a washing that was filthy hallelujah I'm glad it got washed in the blood of Jesus Christ but people look at me and say you're mad I'm not mad I found my mind I know where I'm coming yeah I know where I've come from I know where I'm going hallelujah cuz a fan means a fanatic who are you a fanatic for being fanatic for money your job some sports something is fanatic for Jesus Christ I mean cuz because the Bible phonetic doesn't kill people and blow people up amen I was expecting more of a universal a man so well what's going on we're not starting a militia afraid not what's happening in the earth a member says behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice he's speaking to this age If any man hear my voice man woman or child if anyone hears my voice and open the door I will come into him and sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sit down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches I bet you got it's not just hearing in here you got to hear in your heart something and here's got a God I begin to speak to you I mean that's what you find when the Spirit of God moves and something begins to pull you something means to move upon you can't even maybe understand it or put it into words that's God speaking to you amen and notice now for an ordered now this is this is me but in order to overcome you have to hear his voice in order to overcome this age you must hear his voice and you must open the door you can't keep the door shut because man is you know man it when when you're when God comes across a person's path they get scared just like Adam and Eve they get scared but you got to cast aside that fear I meant cast aside those things he's here to redeem you he's not here to destroy you he's not here to cast you into outer darkness he's here to take you to himself hallelujah amen and redeem you so we have must God is speaking all around the world the voice of God is walking hallelujah and as to find Adams full and race out of every kindred nation and tongue hallelujah okay and you're glad you can say I'm one of them hallelujah now it comes a time we have to we have to keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ he is his word God and his word are not two separate things he is his word he is his word the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us right so that was more than just as just more than ink on paper but this this is God in print form we understand that everything God is is in this Bible right but it has to become a living reality to you the Spirit has to quicken it to you amen but here's his word you can't separate God in his word if you leave the word you've left God because he is his word but now there comes a time where where the devil or just situation of life we get distracted and we lose our focus we're going to keep our eyes on Jesus we must now we're living at a time of a resurrection who believes that we're living in a resurrection hour because the Bible says Jesus said when you see the fig tree Matthew 24 when you see the fig tree put forth its buds you know summer is nigh even at the doors that summer is the Millennium right and then so in the Bible of figs and the Bible is Israel and prophecy you go read Jeremiah 24 it speaks about it and a tree is a nation it's either a person or a nation this is when you see the factory put forth its buds when you see Israel become a nation again you know that we're at the end and they've been a nation what 70 years when nearly 70 years they've been there amen against all odds there they are because God wanted them there hallelujah so now now if they've been a nation 70 years and Jesus said the generation that sees them become a nation will not pass until all things be fulfilled that generation is getting old hallelujah we're at the end of all things glory to God I mean that you shouldn't be worried about it but we're going to keep our eyes on him so now we're living in a season of the resurrection because Paul the Apostle Paul he was he thought he was talking about his age but he's talking about our age he said they were tower alive and remain when a pender will prevent in which are asleep that didn't cross the rise first and we were a child live and remain we've got to be with them to meet the Lord in the air so comfort one another with those words but then in chapter 5 Isis but of the times and seasons brethren I have no need to write of you because you know when it'll happen we're not the children of darkness with a children of light hallelujah we're not stooping around in darkness I mean we know where we are in the scripture we know where we're in time I mean so we're expecting they did in Christ arise hallelujah the next thing that the church is looking for is the resurrection of the Dead Saints so we're living in a time of resurrection hallelujah and even you who have been quickened made alive by a spirit I mean you've been resurrected from death to life hallelujah once dead in trespasses and sins now you're alive this spirit is resurrected you hallelujah see you're the sign of the resurrection as well people say how do you know Christianity works well I'll tell you what it did to me hallelujah I'm alive I was once paid I was blind I was stumbling around in this world and culture and whatever people say just went with the tide but then a voice spoke to me hallelujah now I'm alive but sometimes things happen and we wonder what's going on now so brother Branham he preaches a sermon modern events are made clear by prophecy any any reach Luke 24 at the time of the resurrection and he says these modern events because normally when you preach a sermon and hopefully I do it I don't know but the text that you that you open with you expound upon for the rest of the service that's normally the done thing so he goes to Luke 24 and he speaks about the tour on the way to Emmaus and he says the modern events these modern events all around you know what CNN is telling you not what New Zealand Herald was telling you whatever news outlet but these modern beans are made clear by the prophecy and Luke 24 is a prophecy hallelujah Luke 24 is a prophecy he says you're now living in the time of that prophecy I mean remember it's a lovely and are you got to see what he's saying what is God to him they have an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the church and so now here we are and so this is not Luke 24 but you all of the all of the times of the death bear resurrection of Jesus Christ and you look at the believers and what they're doing you'll find yourself in there you'll find yourself in there and this is a so I was reading through the Gospels it was very interesting where John John was the only one where where it reads that where well let's just read it and I'll show you where where Jesus speaks culture by name calls her by name remember John as a as a eagle anointing on that gospel he he sees from eternity to eternity not the same as the book of markets all works okay just go straight into his ministry what he did Lucas man's wisdom Matthew is that it might be fulfilled as a lion lion anointing upon that gospel they're written differently for a purpose but now it's just John the Eagle and and and Jesus speaks but I don't want to get ahead of myself with here so John 20 and 11 to 14 but Mary stood now here we know I'll just read it and Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she were and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain and they said unto her woman why weepest thou and she said unto him Adam sorry because thou because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seeketh del she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou laid him and I will take him away jesus saith unto her Mary she turned herself and saith unto Him rabboni which is they master jesus saith unto her touched me not for I have not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them I ascend unto my father and to your father and to my god and your God Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto her see here was here was someone living in the time of the resurrection she didn't know what was going on she was caught up member Jesus told them I'll be delivered into the hands of wicked men and and I'll be crucified I'll be killed in three days I'll raise again he told them he told them but then here she is she knew all about what it was to take spices and to anoint the dead she knew what all about death because death is a part of life she knew what it was you know like they have the Tumen and and and everything they did but then she came to the tomb now he wasn't in the tomb anymore remember he's not back in the Garden of Eden he's and and here and and here mirrors and she's caught up in her grief they've taken my we believed he'd be the Messiah we believe this is Jesus the Christ and they've take him in a way and where have you taken him tell me with and and here she is she's talking to the very resurrected Messiah but she doesn't recognize this as him and she's saying tell me where you've taken him that I can I can take him where is this word gone we know it was killed I'll take this I'll carry it and I was thinking last night I don't know how big she was but for a woman to pick up a body of a man and carry him away that would have been a hard thing to do I mean but this is where some people you know we get distracted with what's going on we don't fully understand what's going on in our walk because there's certain things happen in certain seasons in our walk with God right and we have to and he allows these things to happen here she is full of grief where have you taken him tell me where he is and all I'll carry him away and she was looking right into the eyes of the one who hang on the cross she is hanging she was looking in the eyes of the one who just paid her Sunday I mean read the keys of healthier than the grave on the side hallelujah here was the here's the sacrifice tell me where you've taken him I'll carry him away hallelujah but then the voice of God spoke hallelujah call there by name called him by name Mary then her eyes became open Oh master that's you friends we get sometimes we take our eyes we get caught up in things and we get and we miss where he is amen we're all been there but just let him speak your name amen when he when his word when his word speaks to your heart that's him calling you by name that's him calling you by name so when he was talking to the woman at the well I mean and something happened to her when when she said we know where Messiah cometh he'll do these things and then he said he that speaks to them he amen her life was transformed amen because it was more than just the audible voice of a man from Nazareth speaking but it was the voice behind the voice there's a supernatural voice speaking hallelujah like Peter James and John Lee said to whom shall we go you alone have the words of eternal life I mean but the scribes and Pharisees they heard the same words they said this is Beelzebub away with such a man amen but the other said this is the word of eternal life come hallelujah because they heard the voice amen and he is the same yesterday today and forever the same God that was back there as present this morning Alleluia and said now here she is this I wish I could you know he said Mary one word and she realized this is the master speaking this is not a gardener this is not someone's idea this is not something that just happens on this day after the Sabbath I mean this is the resurrected one hallelujah it's the same thing here this morning friends I pray hallelujah is more than a gardener who's the one that speaks to you who's the one when you read the word or hear the message and it anchors into your soul amen and you've come to realize I'm a son or daughter of the king hallelujah I know ruff come from I know where I'm going it's him made you being here yo you're so broken I brought spices and the tumors open and angels who spoke to me I have no idea where he is I just want to find him that's all she wanted she didn't want to speak to angels she want to find him where is he Koli and she said broken and she sees this one a gardener she thinks where have you taken him I want to go to where he is and then one word changes their whole life hello you're not dead here you are I mean I'm not beside myself like you think I am these things mean a lot to me these things mean a whole deal to me Alleluia it's the same thing with us the world's falling apart people are doing all kinds of different things but where is he Mary wasn't up by where here it was all or them or Pilate she wasn't worried about what they were doing where are you lord you know it's the day after the Sabbath is the resurrection day that's why we gather on a Sunday to to honor the resurrection Amy because he's alive and well and it comes to you I pray you can go back go back to that time when did his voice become real to you if it has I pray it has something you say it go wit beyond my reasoning went beyond my emotion but I went to my soul and something happened to me hallelujah we need his voice to speak because here she was wait can we put that I want to put that back up see I have seen I love this I seen done to my father into your father hallelujah your your daughter of the king that's why I've spoken to you that's why wants you to know these things because you're not just wherever you're from and Galilee or wherever you're a daughter of God hallelujah I want you to know this a missus like when the Lord came and spoke to Adam and Eve that word Lord God as as as as the self-existing one who expresses himself you go look in the Hebrew it means something like that and it says what it wants a relationship hallelujah I want to know my children I want my children to know me that's the same thing today don't worry about way every others one's idea you know his voice his voice will take you into the word hallelujah my sheep and I'll come to that later know my voice now this is from a message spiritual amnesia this is from there's my brother BAM he's speaking of he speaking of soldiers that got shell-shocked and they lost their minds they didn't know who they were anymore they being transported to a mental asylum since they're going up the hillside train pulling and they stopped at a station let the boys get out and stretch their legs and the guards go out on the hill to watch them because with amnesia you had to watch them so they watched one young fellow he got out he began to look around at the water tank looked around looked all around over the hill he rubbed his face he studied he looked again he's seen that water tank he stopped all around at the station he started walking and stared of the guys stopping him he followed him he went up over the hill down a little path turned to the right went over another little hill came to a little log cabin he looked coming out on the porch an old man with a cane in his hand came out and throwed his arms around him said my son I know you would return they told me you were dead but I know you would return and the boy came to himself has amnesia left him he could identify who he was he knowed that that was his father and it's the same thing with us we come into this world we have no idea who we really are I mean we are we're just wandering around in darkness but then but then the Bible becomes becomes open to us and we begin to see familiar places something in a sense I can identify with the Rebecca I can identify with Esther I can identify with Ruth I can identify with the woman at the well I mean I can identify with Rahab hallelujah I can identify with Peter James and John something in us begins to something begins to awaken I mean but don't you stay there go all the way to father's house I mean because he's waiting for you to return I mean he's waiting for you to return hallelujah because because when the soldier was still on the path maybe someone could have knocked him off the path and he could have forgotten where he was hallelujah but the guys just just followed of Maidan and they didn't interfere but then winners when his father came embraced his son then his Ebenezer left him hallelujah then he knew that that was his father and who he was just let the Lord Jesus embrace you one time amen and you'll know who you are you'll know who your father is you'll know who your bridegroom is I mean you know he's paid it all hallelujah isn't that right Oh soldier of the Cross that's been shocked with so much training so many shocks of denominations and Creed and things of the world why don't you step off for a few minutes and go looking around at the Bible amen might wander around you might find yourself identified here in the word as a believer one of these days you might not know him you may come to yourself like the prodigal son didn't find yourself you might find your identification in the words of God he says listen when a man marries a wife he doesn't trust in her beauty no he trusts in the loyalty of her vow her word he doesn't trust in her beauty he trusts in her loyalty this is the same same sermon and that's the way when you when you're married to God you don't trust in some big beautiful church you can build but in the promise that Jesus Christ made that I am the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that hallelujah that's what we trusted I mean we're not trusting in anything else because if he's the same yesterday today and forever then he will guide us all the way a man will be will be led by the Shepherd's voice the great Shepherd's voice will lead us personally and if he's leading us amen we can never be lost amen if he's leading us things may appear to go sideways but he's in the sideways I mean he's in the situation but you've got to have confidence Lord you're leading me down this way and then and if I've stepped off the path in my own ability Lord forgive me and give me back on the road Alleluia says in John 10 1 2 5 says verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he did injure them by the door as the as the Shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own sheep by name hello hello sheep he amen so his sheep hear his voice I have heard his voice and you're still hearing his voice I mean any call of his own sheep by name and leadeth them out amen I love I trust this mean something to you amen you're being lead hallelujah have you come in through the door Jesus is the door repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that is the door that is the way into the sheepfold amen I trust you've come in that way I don't want to come in through a window I want to come in goss provided way hallelujah and when he putteth forth as sheep he goes before them and the Sheep follow him and they know his voice and a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers I trust you fallen in love with the voice the voice of God when the voice of God speaks to you Amen because if you really know you know it's like um some people major on all the bad of everything else we don't need to do that it's like someone who who can detect counterfeit money they just study the genuine they study the genuine enough and then they can detect the counterfeit right there should be the same thing with us we should so know him in his word not not just mental memorization of Scripture but we should so no man has word that when the canif it comes our way we should be able to know the counterfeit as in their right we should we should have a personal relationship with him and his word guide us in your word God a man I trust that's your prayer this is not a dead letter I pray it's not to you this is a living book Alleluia because it's him and a stranger or not follow but will flee from him they know not the voice of strangers I was going to drop down to verse see of him and then jesus said unto them again veil evil I said to you I am the door of the Sheep all that ever come before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door By Me If any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture amen hoose who's got spiritual food hallelujah the thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and to destroy I came that they might have life and they might have it more abundantly hallelujah and that abundant life is not material things even though that make him come with it but that abundant life is his life in you hallelujah when you don't know the way his spirit comes down and he leads and guides you into all truth you say that's crazy to say God speaks to people God still speaks to people amen and as I said it doesn't make us go kill a bunch of people because that's not according to his word if the word says thou shalt not kill then how can someone say God told me to go killed someone because the voice is not according to his word Amen this way you got to know you know is it really you God he'll show you I mean that we would have life and life more abundantly he says I'm the Good Shepherd and the Good Shepherd give us his life for the Sheep but he that is a hireling and not the Shepherd who whose own the sheep are not see it the wolf coming and leave with the Sheep and flee a--the and the wolf catches them and scatters the Sheep the huiling flee it's because he is a hireling and careth not for the Sheep I'm the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine and that means he knows you and you know him hallelujah and he won't lose one of his sheep he cannot leave he cannot lose a part of himself he cannot I mean the devil says I'm going to drag the sons and daughters away I mean but God says you I won't lose one I mean they're all going to come all that the father has given me will come and all that come to me all no wise cast out I mean so you've already been given your mouth so just come I mean why why fight the pulp why Grievous spurt I mean just say hey Lord Jesus I come amen personally if I had a million life's to live I love them all for him I mean I would it's worth it you mean this hardship and whatever more I don't care about those things the Apostle Paul said I was shipwrecked I was stoned I was beaten I was all kinds of things happen I was hungry else whatever more he says none of these things move me because he kept his eyes on Jesus he kept his eyes on his word he kept his eyes on the Commission that he received I mean he comes too near the end of his Road he says I was not disobedient he speaks to King Agrippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision amen he kept his course true and he fought you know he says he fought the beast at Ephesus they weren't wild animals that was religious spirits and people amen but he had to fight those here you know here it just dangers with an end without and sometimes things just happened to him he didn't understand why it happened he just walked gone and we've been restored back to the original faith of the fathers hallelujah so if the Apostle Paul a man can walk and and I've never been shipwrecked I've never been beaten I've never been robbed or mugged or whatever you know whatever he lists I never received stripes you know like he did he says none of these things move me because he kept his eyes you got a he kept his eyes on his commission I've been called for this purpose I've been called to be a light to the Gentiles this is why he was called and he says I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision Alleluia he said none of these things move me now how about you you say well I'm not the Apostle Paul but you're still cold you're still being commissioned I mean to be a living epistle I mean that the Word of God would manifest itself out of you I mean to be a life of this dying world you've been commissioned you have been called and you've been seen I mean as Jesus sent His disciples he sends you Alleluia so we shouldn't worry about what's you know keep your eyes on his word keep your eyes what does he called you to be a man he's called you to be the Bride of Christ Alleluia keep your eyes on him no matter what where are you Shepherd you know sheep there's all different kinds of sheep you know we you know man I think nowadays we look at sheep you know they're just all the same temperament but then when you think of horses your animals have all different kind of personality you know man man actively breeds this horse in this horse because the temperament you know he wants the temperament of the parents to come down into the children because because some horses they've got a real wild temperament you can't ride them but those who got gentle meek temperaments he said I want that one and I want that one to breed with this one to keep that down all sheep sheep have different temperaments as well dogs are different temperaments you know there's some some sheep that are more blessed than other sheep you say but they sheep they're all blessed now but in the range of sheep this wild sheep more more independent crazy sheep and there's more placid ones but they're still sheep right you understand we're all you know because it's the same thing with human beings as long as you're one of us sheep I'm it doesn't matter what temperament you have I'm not saying these things you know I want you under the yoke because we look at a field we say are they just all the same they look all the same how do you do but in the Old Testament they the Shepherd knew their sheep by name they didn't use dogs like we do here in New Zealand they called them by name and they followed the Sheep followed him I mean because the ship had had a relationship with the Sheep and when the Shepherd saw another another thing with two legs walking along calling them by name something Emma said that's not my shepherd but then when another two-legged individual came along and call them by name they said I know that voice their voice was there at my birth their voice was there when I was separated maybe from my mum hallelujah that voice was there when I was shown the first time I mean their voice called me and lead me to another field and because this field the grass is drying up hallelujah as the same thing with us God's voice is here when we're birthed into the kingdom hallelujah the yo his voice was here when he called us to have a more personal walk with him hallelujah his voice is here when he calls us to another field I mean eat this part of the word hallelujah have the spiritual food amen but as long as we're sheep don't worry about you know as everyone a sheep here do you believe you're a sheep doesn't matter what you think about yourself you know and what kind of sheep as long as you're a sheep that's the main thing if you're a sheep you're in I'll put it that way because if you're a god you can't get in right but who believes they're a sheep you're gonna say Lord I'm a sheep hallelujah I'm one of your sheep you are my shepherd and I'm your sheep hallelujah amen that's that's just how this is what it boils down to it cuz he says I know my sheep my sheep hear my voice is stranger they'll not follow I know my sheep and they're known of me he doesn't speak about any other category of animal my sheep as long as we wanted the Sheep hallelujah now the problem is its when trouble arises there's the challenge why do we read that we did I says here sorry as the father knoweth me even so either father and I lay my life down for the Sheep and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring now you gotta when you read this you say he's talking about me he's talking about how does he know about me he knows everything about everyone right amen and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd well and they shall hear my voice sorry and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd therefore does my father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and other power to take it up again this commandment have I received in my father so he says there are other sheep that are not of this fault also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd hallelujah so he's talking about you it's not just a nice story he's talking about you yeah you weren't there 2,000 years ago when the disciples were gathered around them I mean you're here in 2017 but you're still sheep hallelujah he says you must hear my you must hear my voice I must bring them into the sheepfold holy oh you know a sheep who's ever done nagging before who's ever cut lambs tails off anyone I see a big whose about 11 here he's about 11 yep oh I was your size probably not as big actually lambs see sheep lamps you know when you because you pick them up by the bow by the hind leg so so they're back so you pick up by the hind legs like this and then you and you take them to thee to the fence and then someone else cuts the cuts off the towel whatever more now I'm gonna live in your old boy you can pick up a sheep pick up a lamb now if you've got them in a real firm hold they don't struggle but if you hold them loosely they begin to kick but it's just a look you got a little bit of pressure and they stopped struggling no it's the same thing with us he's got you because if the lamb thinks you know I don't have him he's gonna kick and try and get free listen he knows hey things got me he's got you amen he's got you now you're not here to be dag door or towels to be cut off but you got to have confidence you got to have confidence whose hands are my in whose hands are my in I'm not in some man's hands I'm in God's hands amen and he's picked me up for a reason he's picked me up to bring me to bring me into a sheepfold hallelujah you just got to know the arms of the one at the Shepherd Amen do you know those arms hello Lucas all these are eternal arms I mean they're been searching for me you know sometimes is a muster and and there'll be most of the Shepherd's will go and get most of the sheep but then there's a few that come afterwards two or three times to find the ones that are that that didn't go with the first part of the herd hallelujah and sometimes it's like that we can just be wandering around just us because this is actually the main must has gone through the world and it's just ones and twos around the place and we can do he's wandering but the shoe the chief shepherd knows I have so many sheep he's not a human Shepherd because human shipments can be sometimes or she'll be right there's maybe one or two out there in the Hills we'll get them next season God isn't wanting to wait for a next season there's no next season there's only this one season and he knows how many sheep should be in the paddocks have been done on the valleys hallelujah so so he sends his shepherds he sends his Holy Spirit of the Shepherd's find those Lambs find those sheep hallelujah and God has a determination they will be there but you could have confidence in your shepherd you gotta have confidence these hands that have me and it's not just and I haven't been taken against my will I've gladly said Lord take my life and make it though I mean you got to have confidence and the one that's leading and guiding you amen that's his who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed while those who believers report as the arm of the Lord been revealed to write for he shall grow up before him now this is prophecy of Jesus coming he shall grow perform as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he has no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and antiquated with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him I'll stop there it says he's he he's acquainted with grief now if you're acquainted with something you not really well and now so he knows he knows your pain he knows your sadness he knows your you know he knows what you're going through why did why did God become a man that he would understand you that he would experience the same things you go through I mean that he would know what it means to be rejected he would know what it's means to lose loved ones but Joseph Joseph was there when he was born but when Jesus comes into his ministry where's Joseph he died he knows what it is to be misunderstood he knows what it means to stick out in a crowd I mean he knows what it's like and we begin to think well no one understands me he understands you if none can relate to you in here he can relate to you amen but the thing is if you don't know that then you won't turn to him hallelujah but you got to recognize he knows what you've been through amen so he's a man that was acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with the stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her Shearer's is dumb so he opened not his mouth now we're going to read the whole chapter but read the whole chapter of speaks of him now I underline this for a reason we are like sheep that have gone astray now if who has ever moved sheep who's ever been on a farm who's even moved sheep down the road to other paddocks yes you've got to keep your eyes on them me and my brother we were we were yay big 11 he was a bit older we had a four-wheeler and my uncle said take the I know a few hundred sheep take them from this paddock down to this paddock you got to watch them you got to watch them because they just start wandering they start eating grass and you know they just they're just cruising along you got to keep your eyes because you had to give them to that paddock and now if there wasn't fences there then then they just wander off and I'd wander off somewhere they'd just keep wondering because they go their own way because they're sheep that are going astray now we're all sheep now the main thing is we're sheep we've all gone astray but the main thing is your sheep right you may you may get caught in a and a blackberry bush or something and be stuck and maybe be the wounded or hurt but you're still the Sheep and you may have caused yourself to end up that way but you're still a sheep I mean what are you looking at who you are or or what's happened to you because if you look at what's happening to you then you'll stay there in that state but if you say I'm a sheep therefore the Shepherds got to find me he'll find you I mean you he'll hear you're bleeding or whatever it is when you're stuck help me I'm down a crevasse hallelujah but I'm a sheep what do you what are you looking at I'm a sheep glory if I go astray by my own humanity he'll he'll bring me back on the path I may pay for the straying but he'll bring me back hallelujah because I'm a sheep I'm glad I'm a sheep I mean I bet you all these young children here if they sit you know if we ask them what animal do you want to be if you could be an animal none of them would say sheep but praise God I'm a sheep I'm so glad I'm a sheep so they've all turned everyone to his own way now this is this is an Hebrew this this would way the definition is a road is trodden fricative lay a course of life or a mode of action so a course of life as a direction you go so it's a road that is trodden now what this means is that when we go astray we start to go down familiar roads that we used to walk down before the Lord lead us there now thinking and and and you know like for example of you know carnality can come in and then what we used to do before we met the Lord we start doing it again and and how we think and we take on our own because we then we begin to think now what road do I have to take oh I know this road I've been doing it before but then because we're sheep we forget where the road takes us and we and it lead us to ruin the first time but then we keep walking down it amen because we we work out what what we're gonna do and you've taken if you going your own way you've taken your eyes off the shepherd we must never take our eyes off Jesus if we tap if we have our eyes on someone else you've taken your eyes off Jesus I mean if we if we have our eyes on our brothers and sisters our eyes are off Jesus and where do you go you go your own way and where is that way it's not his way amen it's just wood let's just jump to that one I'm gonna come back but we'll go here it says this is second Corinthians for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise so we dear he says we dare not make ourselves the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves oh look at me I'm the best sheep in the paddock look at me I can jump higher than everyone else look at me if you look at that sheep you're not wise and they're not wise as well I'm the best believer look at me I'm the best one that person is unwise and if you're looking at them you're unwise because your eyes are on the wrong person your eyes are on the wrong person if your eyes are on them then your eyes will not be on the Shepherd and you will go your own way amen if we compare ourselves with ourselves we're not wise what does that mean you foolish this is this is our mirror this is our comparison and to me the message in the Bible are the same because they are as Jesus Christ amen so when we read this it shouldn't be I want to gain knowledge it's Lord I lay myself at your feet and change me that the character nature of you in this word aiming comes into me that's what it should be so we've got to keep our eyes on the shepherd whatever you do let's go back now I talked about this on Wednesday but the disciples were traveling in a boat one day if one knows the story brother and peaches are sermon go awake Jesus or calling Jesus on the scene and now these these disciples they knew the boat very well they were born and raised as fishermen they knew the boat maybe they built the boat maybe they laid the keel of the boat they knew how it handled they knew the conditions on the sea but then there came a point they had Jesus with them and this is where we this is where if we if we try and take everything under our own control will sink will sink i I used to race sailing boats growing up and those boats are designed to capsize because you can get them up again I remember many times sailing and and and the and the windier it gets the the the more likely it is I mean the it's like you're sailing on a Razors Edge and just one small mistake and you'll be over the windier it gets so the greater the storm the more quickly you can get real dangerous there are some times I'll be sailing along the bow the boat goes into the yo nose dives I'm throwing out one side and the boat flips over and I've got to swim to try and catch my boat and I was telling myself I'm having fun I was having fun but do you see that boats designed to be righted again they're fishing boats were made that way if they capsized they sunk and it's the same thing with us are you with me we don't want to just enjoy nose diving into waves because their boat wasn't designed to to be righted again now see Sam when he entered into the ship as disciples followed him and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea and so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples candles here to welcome saying the lord save us we perish and he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm but they mean marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the wind's and the sea obey Him now in a storm it is normally there's not my gusts of wind first is a gust I think goes a little bit coming is another gust and then as the gusts come they they start coming closer and closer together until it's just blowing a gale that's what happens when a storm come when when the weather rapidly changes on the sea and so now the first Gus you see these these disciples they knew what it's like for a storm to come onto the Sea of Galilee they knew was like to handle the ship in a storm and many times we can say well I've been through something like this before I can handle the situation but they came a point where all of their all of their seafaring knowledge all their ability to to you know bail the water out of the boat who's bailed water out of a boat he comes the point where you can't you're you cannot bail it out faster than it's coming in but their own ability oh I'll fix this problem I've got some problem with my brother or sister or something's going on I'm going to battle the water I'm going to fix the problem I mean I'm gonna I'm going to trim the sails you know then that we're gonna stay afloat I'm going to roll it a little bit but they had came to a point master don't you care that we perish and it's the same thing with you and I he's in the boat I mean we're having fellowship it's two fellows in a ship that's the definition of fellowship hallelujah that's what I think brother Baxter seed to brother branham I can't remember but that's what it is we're all in the same ship the gospel ship he's in the boat I mean we just got to wake him up hallelujah don't try and Oh things are going sideways in life don't you try and fix it you say lord help me or I'll perish and then if you're really neutral about the whole thing you'll say no do this on this and you and he'll guide you through the trial but if you still have your mind set on something no I still actually want to do this but Lord guide me in your word and help me in this problem but in your mind you want to do a certain thing he were he can't guide you because you your mind is made up but if you're really neutral in the whole thing he'll say do this in this and then you say yes Lord amen we're going to wake him up we cannot leave him asleep he say does that does God sleep he rested on the seventh day and the creation he did the creation that it City arrested and he rests between revivals Amen we are between revivals and it's between revivals when the danger comes they meant remember I said months ago that's when David he got on the throne he had his kingdom he doesn't go fight the battles anymore he's sitting on a throne he walks out to his window wherever he sees Bathsheba what happens he got settled down he got comfortable he got used to his kingdom oh this is yeah I could just relax I can retire now basically and that's why I said because things he got complacent in his walk with God and that's where the enemy came in at his weakness time he was between revivals Israel was between revivals at their time and it's the same thing with the church remember our revivals and awakening who's been awakened I mean you get yo you begin to realize he's not three people he's one person I mean he's your Redeemer I mean his voice is spoken in the same time you mean to your eyes come open I'm a child of the king holy and you're called out of Babylon out of confusion I mean you follow his voice and you begin to rejoice glory amen my Isaac I Know Who I am hello he's washed all my sins away that's a revival because your eyes come open that's not the final revival you just come out hallelujah I've been sealed under the kingdom that's enough yeah that's a revival that's an awakening but then becomes a time witness between revivals and that's when the enemy comes in because it's between revivals because really what's your first all you care about is him you're not worried about what other people necessarily are doing but your whole focus your whole heart everything is on him and how wonderful he is that's the first love Alleluia but then the enemy will try and come in things will come and to try and distract us and we look at other things and if we look at other things we go our own way and we go astray we've got to wake him up brother M says you can call him on the scene he's in the boat with you he's in the boat with you I mean when you wake up in the morning he's in the boat I mean wherever you go in this life if he's in you I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world wake him up you got to wake him up otherwise you'll sink we're not called to sink amen there's in the sermon I think awakening Jesus II see could you imagine Jobe enjoying being broke out with boils and all these things gone losing all of us wealth and his children and everything it wasn't very easy but God was proving to Satan that he had somebody he could put his confidence in maybe he's trying to do the same thing in your case I mean and the rest of you he says oh I'll bail for sake you though oh no job they couldn't make job do that no sir I mean because Jobe kept his eyes on the offering he gave amen he knew he knew he wasn't righteous but he knew that God said slay a lamb slain animal in your place and his eyes were on that burnt offering and in you because God accepted that offering then he was righteous Oh hallelujah as the same thing with you and I because God God accepted the sacrifice he provided amen his own the blood of his own son I mean God accepted that and because God accepted that Amen we're accepted hallelujah it's like the high priest once a year takes the blood I mean on behalf of the people into the Holy of Holies once a year and then when he came out alive the people could rejoice hallelujah we've been accepted the sacrifice on our behalf I mean it was accepted most of the congregation couldn't go into the you know they can only go to the outer court the high priest was the only one who going once a year I mean into the Holy of Holies to offer the blood on behalf of the people and if he came out we're accepted hallelujah that's the same thing with you and I we have such a high priest I mean we have such a high priest our lord jesus is our high priest that's why I said to Mary don't touch me I have an ascended yet I mean anything he went up and he offered his blood he came back down he said Thomas touch the holes in my hand to my side of my feet hallelujah touch me handle me now and because my blood has been offered hallelujah and in two thousand years down the road I mean he comes out of history I'm in this message he steps out of history it's the high priest coming out again I mean to make you know Calvary worked I mean to make you know I shed my blood on the cross for you hallelujah yes my brother and would stand there and he called someone out and called their name in their address and what's wrong with them and go down a line and he'd say now who did they touch they didn't touch me I'm thirty feet away from them they touched the high priest because the scripture says he's still the high priest you touched by the feeling of your infirmities I mean so that was for you to know the high priest was standing not the prophet but the God revealing through the Prophet Pulu he sang the high priest is here hallelujah and if you have the high priests you have the blood hallelujah if you have the blood you got forgiveness of sin glory to God amen so we have such a high priest oh I love that high priest don't you Amen but joy Beck confidence in that lamb he didn't know what was going on you go read the book of Joel he didn't know what was happening he didn't know that Satan went up to God and they had a conversation and God pointed out Jobe and said he's the perfect man and and Satan said well it's only because everything goes well for you for him that's why he loves you and and God said the first time where he can do anything but just don't touch him then the second time we can touch him just don't take his life Jobe didn't understand he wasn't there that conversation he didn't get a memo they just had that meeting he's just living his life and then everything and then one servant runs in these ones have taken away all your sheep and this one runs and lightning came down and killed these ones and this one ran in you know your sons and daughters there in a house and the house fell upon them because of a storm and they're all dead and here he is now what did he do God has provided me a lamb I don't know what's happening but there's a lamb and offered the lamb and gods accepted the lamb that's all I know that's all I really need to know and then even as friends come and tell them oh you're a secret sinner and you did this and God's not interested he said I don't I don't understand but I understand this I understand this lamb hallelujah and that's how we have to be friends I don't understand what's going on in life I mean where have you taken his body she's married what's going on I don't know but I know one thing I have a lamb amen and in that lamb I have forgiveness and that lamb I have redemption and that lamb I have peace and that lamb I have joy and that lamo got long-suffering I've got faith gentleness meekness everything I've need of everything I need over my earthly journey is in that lamb and because the main thing is the life that was in that lamb comes into me holy because the life of God was released on Calvary and comes into the believer that's all I really know I know the lamb so what's going on in life well I don't know but I know this what are you looking at I'm looking at him he is his word hallelujah no see see he was only trying to prove them you remember in a few minutes he said oh ye of little faith couldn't you understand about the breaking and feeding the 5,000 don't you know I'm the same Jehovah that fed them 40 years out in the wilderness out of the ovens out of heaven when I poured it out every night what what you so scared about don't you know I dried up the Red Sea one day don't you know I opened up the earth and swallowed the unbeliever one day I measured the earth and spirited it off out into space yonder he's in the ship now that's not mythical that's truth same now he tries to prove us and see where the will stand or not take a revival away and start an argument in the church just to see what you'll do turn Satan loose among you see how you'll stand let him strike you with something see what kind of a stand you take job said though he slay me you don't trust him amen that's it amen he said he'll allow these things to happen to see what you gonna do hallelujah now what are you gonna do here's the quick note what are you gonna do he's in the ship meemers not mythical it's truth he's in the ship with you what are you gonna do amen he'll there you be have sickness you may carry it for some time what are you gonna do you gonna still walk by faith you may have disagreements we may have disagreements among one another people pull this way people pull that way I'll tell you this how do you know if you're a legalist or a liberal you're actually take offense against the other side so if you're a legalist you can't stand someone who's liberal and if you're liberal you can't stand one can't stand someone who's legalist you take offense that's how you know if you one or the other but if you really love the Lord and love your brother you want to call from both sides I mean you want to see a life lived I mean the divine love flowing through a person hallelujah that's because you got to know who you are amen it's like it's like the you know we talked about if God ever your God is writing another book of X and he is writing another book of X but out of the book of X came the Corinthian church I meant they were liberal they were still sheep they were still sheep they're liberal then worried about sin and everything was out of order then out of out of the book of Acts came the Galatian Church they were legalistic they'll still sheep but out of the book of Acts came these people you know there was the Ephesians that that had this deep revelation but Paul had to remind them love your wife husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it and wives love your husband's they forgot how to live every day life that came out of the book of Acts I mean the Thessalonians were we're worried because Paul said don't be moved or worried by by spirit or by letter from us as the day of the Lord Yahoo won't come until there be the great falling away in the son of sin I mean the man of sin be reveal you know and there's another one said that people said the resurrection is passed already and overthrew the faith of some that all came out of the book of Acts what what New Testament church are you all sheep all came out of the book of Acts won't you Testament church EU you personally cuz you'll be one of them amen which one are you yeah think about it because we have to look at the end of the day Jesus said he said don't don't try and pull the little twig or whatever little splinter out of your brother's eye when you've got a whole beam in your own eye pull that out first if I had a if I had a big chunk of wood in my eye I won't be able to see like I would with 20/20 vision he said well that's real obvious but then there's the same thing with you and I we can have a complex that we're looking through and it's a massive piece of wood and we think we're seeing clearly but it takes God now that's why you got to be neutral Lord am i walking with you according to what I think or am i walking with you according to your spirit in your word and if you're really neutral about it he will be able to direct and guide you amen but if we're caught up in our pre preconceived idea this is the way the truth and the life and this is how believers should be then we're just trotting down a path we go our own way amen you got to be neutral remember the shepherd a man is far more intelligent than a sheep even even the dumbest man alive is smarter than a sheep I'm sure we can all agree but the thing is now a sheep a sheep that stays close to a ship it recognizes this this thing I don't know what it's called he's got greater intelligence than me and my intelligence cannot be his naturally and he can he's standing up here I'm down here he can see further than I can see amen and he has depth perception he can see how far away the enemy is because my eyes are here because I'm prey but a man's that your a Predators eyes are here and they can their dip if perception are you following me so they can see how far away the enemy is I can't because my eyes are out here somewhere I can't really see that's the same thing with God that's why God God says here's the enemy here and he's trying to tell you this is where the enemy is and you say what oh that's miles away and he can be right next year amen but if but if you're if you're a smart cheap you recognize hey my ship it knows more than me hallelujah but then there's also the promise in this day that you have the mind of Christ you have the mind of the Shepherd amen so it's got to be Lord changed my thinking that it's your thinking not my thinking my thinking will lead me astray well all the sheep have gone astray my my thinking or my desires well I think it's not going to take you the right way but his thinking will take you the right way hallelujah I'm in queer some musicians to come I mean do you love the Lord are you one of his sheep amen amen just keep your eyes on him keep your eyes on him doesn't matter what happens keep your eyes on him walk with Him keep your eyes on him keep your eyes listen to his word read his word and he'll guide you you have confidence Amen I want to sing they sing that song and then I'll
