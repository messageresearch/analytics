[28:23] Art thank you
[28:40] amen praise the Lord keep it up brother
[28:44] Colin that was the epitome of that
[28:46] little dog you know I might not have
[28:47] much but I'm going for
[28:49] [Laughter]
[28:51] it and that song also um is it has a bit
[28:56] of uh
[28:59] sort of a special meaning for me just at
[29:02] the moment because it's um in the film
[29:04] that I'm making that's that's I've had a
[29:05] lot of trouble to finish it off but the
[29:08] the at the end of the film I've got it's
[29:10] about a protest and that the people that
[29:12] were protesting were Christian people so
[29:14] they sang a lot of HMS during this
[29:16] protest and and one of them that they
[29:18] were singing in the news footage that I
[29:19] watched from the 70s was how great
[29:21] theyou art and there's a it was made
[29:24] very popular in this country by Sir
[29:25] Howard Morrison he sang it of it and it
[29:28] seemed to be his theme song although I
[29:29] don't think he was a Christian he just
[29:31] seemed to do that song and then I
[29:33] managed to get permission from his son
[29:35] to use how great they are at the end of
[29:38] the film so it's it's when when I hear
[29:39] it it's kind of it speaks to me people
[29:43] said I should take it out take that out
[29:45] of the
[29:46] movie you'll offend people it's all
[29:51] right um let's um let's stand this

[42:10] what look
[42:12] me all right okay we're okay now we're
[42:16] good all right let's go Ephesians 6:12
[42:19] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[42:20] blood but against principalities against
[42:23] Powers against the rulers of the
[42:24] darkness of this world against spiritual
[42:27] wickedness in high places wherefore take
[42:29] unto you the whole armor of God that you
[42:31] may be able to withstand in the evil day
[42:33] and having done all to stand stand
[42:35] therefore having your loins good about
[42:37] with truth and having on the breastplate
[42:39] of righteousness and your feet shod with
[42:41] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[42:43] and above all taking the shield of Faith
[42:45] wherewith ye uh shall be able to quench
[42:48] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[42:50] take the helmet of salvation and the
[42:52] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[42:53] God praying always with all prayer and
[42:55] supplication in the SP and watching
[42:57] there onto with all perseverance and
[42:59] supplication for All Saints amen then
[43:02] we're just going to go to Hebrews chap
[43:04] 11 I pray these things all tied together
[43:06] but I want to talk about our feet being
[43:08] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[43:10] of peace today because we got good
[43:12] Footwear I I mean there's a joke we've
[43:14] got Footwear and God's given us
[43:16] authority to to to walk in his promises
[43:18] to stand on every enemy amen so um and
[43:21] then just a bit of a context when I talk
[43:23] about Moses here I just couldn't
[43:25] especially verse 27 I just couldn't get
[43:26] it out of my my out of my heart this
[43:28] whole week I've been meditating on this
[43:30] is by faith Moses when he was born was
[43:32] hid three months of his parents because
[43:35] they saw him as a was a proper child and
[43:38] they were not afraid of the king king's
[43:39] commandment by faith Moses when he was
[43:42] come to years refused to be called the
[43:43] son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[43:45] rather to suffer Affliction with the
[43:47] people of God than to enjoy the
[43:49] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[43:51] the reproach of Christ greater riches
[43:53] than the treasures in Egypt for he had
[43:56] respect unto the recompense of the
[43:57] reward and by faith he forsook Egypt not
[44:00] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[44:02] endured as seeing he him who is
[44:05] invisible amen so let's pray this
[44:07] morning if you want to be remember
[44:09] remember in prayer want to slip your
[44:10] hand up to the Lord amen let's pray
[44:12] gracious Heavenly Father truly Lord
[44:15] Jesus our hearts cry out to you holy
[44:17] blessings honor and power be unto you
[44:20] Lord ask you would take service Lord may
[44:24] you feel so welcome Among Us Lord may
[44:26] your word flow hindered Lord you touch
[44:28] every life Lord may you just come and do
[44:30] what you want to do in our lives today
[44:32] touch our hearts like only you can we
[44:35] also especially want to remember those
[44:36] who are away today be their portion Lord
[44:38] be their strength Lord be with them
[44:39] Father we love you Lord as we've read
[44:41] your word we ask that you would anoint
[44:43] speaker and heer one more time for your
[44:45] glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen
[44:47] amen God bless you you can have your
[44:49] seats um what we're going we're going to
[44:53] go through every mic until and then
[44:54] we'll just not have any how about that
[44:57] okay we'll try we'll go Blue okay we're
[44:59] going blue all right we here yes we're
[45:02] here so I want to I want to speak on
[45:05] this here about how we've gone through
[45:08] the shield of Faith a bit and I just
[45:09] want to speak because you know we but
[45:11] it's amazing how when the Apostle Paul's
[45:13] inspired about the whole armor of God he
[45:15] of course we're covered from head to
[45:16] foot but you we we we have we have these
[45:20] uh our feet is shod with the preparation
[45:22] of the gospel of peace so we're ordained
[45:24] to walk a certain path and now Moses as
[45:27] you know Moses when you really think
[45:29] about the the the magnitude of his
[45:32] decision here where he forsook all the
[45:35] treasures all the wealth all the glamour
[45:36] all the greatness of Egypt and and and
[45:39] he'd rather suffer the afflictions and
[45:41] walk with the people of God but the
[45:43] reason he could is because he he he
[45:45] endured because he was seeing him who
[45:47] was invisible so he he caught a vision
[45:50] of the Eternal God and also he caught a
[45:53] vision of where everyone would end up in
[45:55] eternity so because of this he could
[45:57] look beyond the natural and what you
[45:59] know what he was enjoying in the palace
[46:01] and he could he could um walk walk by
[46:04] faith now it's amazing when you think
[46:06] about Moses because he could have been
[46:08] the next
[46:09] Pharaoh yeah there's a lot of
[46:12] distractions today I'm standing on a
[46:14] thing anyway there was a lot of so it
[46:18] was a big decision he made naturally
[46:20] okay naturally he made a big decision he
[46:22] could have been the next Pharaoh we
[46:24] understand brother Braham tells us he
[46:25] had his one foot on the thr throne and
[46:27] you know so the natural progression of
[46:29] his life is that he could have been the
[46:31] next pharaoh and even as brother Bram
[46:33] said Moses as far as physical done a
[46:36] foolish thing when he tried to deliver
[46:38] the children by the word of God um
[46:41] taking a bunch of people out of the
[46:42] Wilderness when he had this why he was
[46:44] the he of everything they had he had
[46:46] every Army uh there was and all the
[46:48] world whipped and where and there he was
[46:51] a great military General and the next
[46:53] move he he was to be king pharaoh of
[46:56] Egypt why he could just have stepped up
[46:58] on the throne and said all right
[46:59] children go back to your home that
[47:01] settles it he was you know see uh he was
[47:04] a pharaoh so so his next move was going
[47:06] to be was going to be um the pharaoh of
[47:09] Egypt now this is a big you think about
[47:11] that's a big decision to make in the
[47:12] natural and no doubt he had a lot of
[47:15] pressure on him to to take the throne
[47:17] his uh his uh was it Foster mother or
[47:19] stepmom or whatever you know the
[47:21] princess of Egypt that that that pulled
[47:23] him out of the Nile she had expectations
[47:25] son you're going to be AR those those
[47:28] men who are very loyal to him who are
[47:29] around him who who saw him as a great
[47:31] leader they saw the future that he could
[47:33] have stepped into there would have been
[47:35] pressure from from them as well Moses
[47:38] you're going to be the next Pharaoh so
[47:39] he had a lot of peer pressure that he
[47:41] had to balance as well so it wasn't just
[47:43] the the natural things he had to give up
[47:45] but people's expectations wanted him to
[47:47] go a certain way but you see he was not
[47:50] looking God God in his great infinite
[47:52] grace am mean spoke to Moses and showed
[47:55] him a different path so he had to
[47:56] forsake not just the riches of Egypt but
[47:59] he had to forsake people's expectation
[48:01] of him I'll say this carnal peer
[48:03] pressure is a very bad thing peer
[48:05] pressure is a demon right caral carel
[48:08] peer pressure is a very bad thing so he
[48:10] had to but see he could look beyond all
[48:12] that and he could walk a path uh
[48:15] according to God's word now we um see
[48:19] because he had an opportunity naturally
[48:21] to be immortalized on carvings of stone
[48:24] imagine if we could you know imagine if
[48:26] he didn't make the decision he made and
[48:27] he became the next Pharaoh we would have
[48:29] someone would have found his tomb
[48:31] somewhere they would have found the
[48:32] hieroglyphs and all those things and you
[48:34] know we probably would have thought what
[48:36] an incredible Pharaoh but if you really
[48:38] think about it in the spiritual you'd
[48:39] say what a missed opportunity that man
[48:42] had if he went that way sure he could
[48:44] have been Pharaoh he could have been in
[48:45] the history books he could have been all
[48:47] you know great monuments and things
[48:48] carved into his you know you know his
[48:50] name and all those things but
[48:51] spiritually that would have been
[48:52] actually the saddest thing he ever would
[48:54] have had done because he would have
[48:56] turned turn down the leadership of the
[48:57] Holy Ghost to go man's way but aren't
[49:00] you thankful amen that his name is not
[49:02] carved in stone his name is carved in
[49:04] the Eternal annuals of God am mean that
[49:06] when we're on on the other side in the
[49:08] Eternal am mean Moses will still be
[49:10] remembered as Moses as the man who
[49:12] forsook Egypt by faith and walked with
[49:14] God Amen and I believe it's the same
[49:16] thing with you and I you know there's a
[49:18] lot of gifted people here a lot of smart
[49:20] people here a lot of you know there's a
[49:23] lot of potential in the world sitting in
[49:25] this room but I believe by faith we've
[49:27] looked beyond those things amen and we
[49:30] see amen where we will end up one day
[49:32] which is not being in the Guinness Book
[49:34] of World Records or have a Nobel Prize
[49:36] or some great thing I mean you know just
[49:38] that's just upon the Earth amen but
[49:40] we've seen that our names are written in
[49:41] glory so we can look Beyond these
[49:43] natural things and we can endure seeing
[49:46] him who is
[49:48] invisible I mean to endure it means to
[49:50] be steadfast it means to be patient it
[49:53] Webster would say it's to continue in
[49:55] the same state
[49:57] I mean so Moses after he met the Lord At
[49:59] The Burning Bush he continued in that
[50:01] same state in spite of all he went
[50:03] through all the troubles the hardship
[50:05] the moaning the complaining the desert
[50:07] all those things that happened amen he
[50:09] endured Hallelujah he he remained
[50:12] steadfast God's commissioned me to take
[50:15] these people from Egypt into the
[50:16] promised land amen so he continued in
[50:19] that same state now I believe I'm
[50:21] looking at a people who have endured who
[50:23] are enduring
[50:33] because you got to realize the same
[50:34] faith that was in Moses is in you I mean
[50:37] so the same ability to endure that was
[50:39] in him is in you now we know Moses did
[50:41] not Endure by natural ability it wasn't
[50:44] just a maybe a stubbornness or a force
[50:46] of will or you know his his natural
[50:48] makeup that caused him to endure no he
[50:50] endured because of Revelation he endured
[50:53] because the faith of God came into his
[50:54] heart this is what he was called to do
[50:57] now it's amazing how brother arand would
[50:59] bring this up on Wednesday about how you
[51:01] know there was no open Vision in the
[51:03] days of Samuel now I think I think we
[51:06] can take the opposite of this and we can
[51:07] say there has never been a day where
[51:09] there's been such an open Vision as this
[51:11] day there's never been an ability to
[51:13] walk with God I believe as there is in
[51:15] this day I mean because Samuel we see
[51:18] there's no open Vision but when the word
[51:19] came open it was just under the blood of
[51:21] bulls and goats right they were looking
[51:23] for the Messiah to come they were they
[51:25] just dealing against Natural enemies and
[51:27] all these different things but you see
[51:28] now we live in a day where the word has
[51:30] completely come open amen the Seven
[51:32] Seals have been taken off the book amen
[51:35] where where where we know that we come
[51:36] from God we're going back to God Amen we
[51:39] know that it's not our works that give
[51:41] us salvation amen but we we love the
[51:43] Lord so we live a certain way I mean we
[51:45] know it's his grace that saved us and
[51:47] called us and keeps us right we know
[51:49] that it's not us trying to please God
[51:51] but but but the blood of Jesus Christ is
[51:53] more than enough you see in past ages
[51:55] there's a wrestling match going on are
[51:57] we saved by works are we saved by faith
[51:59] this has been a great debate the church
[52:00] has gone through for 2,000 years but
[52:03] finally am mean we have returned to
[52:05] Paul's gospel amen because Paul's gospel
[52:08] says we're saved by grace amen it's the
[52:10] blood of Jesus Christ we're Sanctified
[52:12] by that blood amen by one offering he's
[52:14] perfected them forever who are
[52:16] Sanctified right so now so now we've
[52:18] come back to Paul's gospel with a
[52:20] correct balances come into the church
[52:22] that it's not our works that earn
[52:23] anything amen but we live a Christian
[52:26] Life because we love him because we want
[52:28] to please him we want to we want to draw
[52:30] close to him because he's drawn all the
[52:32] way from glory to us amen so so you see
[52:36] a perfect if if if you just take if you
[52:38] just take the message you take the
[52:40] continuity of thought and the message
[52:41] about works and Grace you take it back
[52:43] into the scripture your life will come
[52:44] out balanced right you won't live a
[52:47] laxed life a loose life no you'll live a
[52:49] life you'll be people should ask you why
[52:51] are you a Christian you say because I
[52:52] love the Lord why are you a certain way
[52:54] because I love the Lord why don't you do
[52:56] certain things because I love the Lord
[52:59] It's not Thou shalt not that is that is
[53:01] so far gone out of it should be out of
[53:03] your mind I mean it's not Thou shalt not
[53:05] Thou shalt know I love the Lord that's
[53:07] the motivation of my life is redeeming
[53:10] love amen when I was a rank sinner lost
[53:12] in the world he came and found me I mean
[53:15] lift me up out of the myy clay and now I
[53:17] live for him because he first loved
[53:19] me amen so a cek balance has coming now
[53:24] so so there is a great sorry where have
[53:26] I got so so there is a great there's
[53:27] never been a day where an open vision is
[53:29] so the word has come so open that we can
[53:32] walk in confidence like we can in this
[53:35] day am mean we're no longer
[53:36] presuming how to please God or how to
[53:39] walk with him we know according to his
[53:41] word I mean the things that have been
[53:43] revealed to you and I Bible scholars are
[53:45] still wrestling about they you know
[53:48] they're still debating it's like you
[53:49] know brother Ed put up on his what
[53:51] WhatsApp status how they found under
[53:53] that um was it in Israel somewhere they
[53:54] found that uh mosaic or whatever that
[53:57] house you know was before the Nan
[53:59] Council there you know 300 years or ad
[54:02] or something that says Jesus is what
[54:04] Jesus Is God Jesus is the Messiah now
[54:08] they dig that up maybe many of them
[54:09] shake their head say but hold on he's
[54:11] this third person of of a trinity but we
[54:14] we know that that that that that
[54:16] inscription is nothing new amen because
[54:18] we've been restored back to the truth of
[54:20] the scripture that Jesus Christ is the
[54:22] Lord Of Glory am mean he's not the
[54:23] second person or minor person he is the
[54:25] person amen he is the king of glory amen
[54:28] so so we didn't need to dig down and
[54:30] find some archaeological thing to find
[54:32] that truth no but a prophet was inspired
[54:34] to look into the word amen to to
[54:36] actually dig past the Creeds and dogmas
[54:38] of man am mean to show us that he is
[54:41] Messiah he is the king of glory am mean
[54:43] he's Alpha and Omega he's the beginning
[54:45] and the end he is our all and all praise
[54:48] the Lord so now now we can we can walk
[54:51] with confidence because I say there is
[54:53] such an open Vision today that you've
[54:55] got to look into it
[54:57] I mean you ever to look into the word
[54:58] for yourself and say Lord reveal to me
[55:00] what you revealed to brother brandham
[55:02] reveal to me what you revealed to the
[55:04] apostles down Through the Ages amen see
[55:06] now Moses would Moses would look by he
[55:10] would he would endure looking to the
[55:11] Unseen seeing who he who is invisible so
[55:15] he could continue in that same state no
[55:17] matter what was going on now if you look
[55:19] at what he did Brother Brown makes a
[55:21] statement he heard this um he heard a uh
[55:24] quotation one of the commentators has
[55:26] said that Moses took the best side of
[55:28] the world put it on one scale and took
[55:30] the worst of religion put it on the
[55:32] other scale and the worst of religion
[55:34] outweighed the best of the world now you
[55:36] think about that for a second so the
[55:38] best of the world was he was going to be
[55:40] the supreme authority over the
[55:42] superpower of the age he wasn't going to
[55:45] rule some minor Kingdom some vassel
[55:47] State somewhere some little village
[55:49] somewhere he was going to be the supreme
[55:51] authority over the superpower of the age
[55:53] Imagine now if if if America was a
[55:57] dictatorship because Egypt was a
[55:58] dictatorship right so imagine now you've
[56:01] been installed as president for life of
[56:03] America and what you say
[56:06] goes right there's no there's no checks
[56:08] and balances anymore it's it's what you
[56:10] say goes and what you've said that what
[56:13] what did they say in the Moses movie
[56:14] shall it be spoken or what is you know
[56:17] it's written shall it be done whatever
[56:19] everyone probably knows that but you
[56:20] know so it's just it becomes law what is
[56:22] said you see so he took the best of that
[56:26] the world in his hand and you think
[56:28] about the worst of religion that he had
[56:29] to enure he enjoed Church splits he
[56:32] enjoed murmuring in the camp he enured
[56:34] you know the gains saying of Kora all
[56:37] the fussing the fighting the problems
[56:39] the politics the division all these
[56:41] things the slave mentality all the worst
[56:43] of religion he took and that outweighed
[56:46] in his mind the best the world could
[56:48] give him and the reason that is is
[56:50] because he could he could see humanly
[56:53] that wouldn't make sense but you see the
[56:55] only way to to make correct decisions in
[56:57] life is not humanly analyzing things but
[57:00] it's by Revelation you see so so by
[57:02] Revelation he could look at those two
[57:04] things and say actually the worst of
[57:06] religion far outweighs being
[57:09] Pharaoh amen now I trust we can look at
[57:11] the world the same way amen you know
[57:14] that that the worst of being a Christian
[57:18] far outweighs the greatest thing the
[57:20] greatest life or pop star whatever
[57:23] person who's trending hashtag whatever
[57:25] their name is going on that that the the
[57:27] worst of being a Believer far outweighs
[57:30] that and I say it sure does Amen because
[57:34] when all when when all is said and done
[57:36] where will they end up and where will
[57:38] you end
[57:39] up unless they get saved then you'll end
[57:42] up in the same place right so it' be far
[57:45] better those things far away now there's
[57:48] another thing where where see so so to
[57:50] be steadfast or to remain to
[57:54] endure we need to we need to wait on the
[57:56] Lord this world's in a big hurry right
[58:01] have I okay this world's in a big hurry
[58:03] now Isaiah would write in Isaiah 40 and
[58:06] to me it's quite interesting where where
[58:08] Isaiah 40 in verse three I think it says
[58:10] here a voice of one crying in the
[58:11] wilderness so so it's like you know
[58:13] there's a bit of an order of this of
[58:15] this chapter where where John the
[58:16] Baptist has been positionally placed and
[58:18] now he's going to speak about the
[58:19] Believers here okay it says to whom will
[58:22] uh ye sorry to whom then will you like
[58:26] me or or shall I or shall I be equal
[58:29] sayeth the Holy One lift up your eyes on
[58:32] high behold who hath created these
[58:34] things that bringeth out their host by
[58:36] number he calleth them by all by names
[58:39] by the greatness of his might uh for
[58:42] that he is strong in power not one
[58:44] faileth why sayith thou oh Jacob and
[58:46] speaketh O Israel my way is hid from the
[58:48] Lord see we can't have that attitude why
[58:51] do people say I can do things in secret
[58:53] and God doesn't see it God sees your God
[58:56] sees your browsing history God sees what
[58:59] you've been watching you may delete it
[59:01] but God sees it right God sees we can't
[59:05] hide nothing from God if you think you
[59:07] can pull the wall over his eyes the
[59:08] devil's been trying it for thousands of
[59:10] years and how's that working out for
[59:13] him it's not going to work out good for
[59:15] you
[59:17] either right amen uh my way is hid from
[59:21] the Lord and my judgment is passed over
[59:22] from my God hast thou not known hast
[59:25] thou not heard that the Everlasting God
[59:27] the Lord the creator of the ends of the
[59:28] Earth fainteth not neither is weary
[59:31] there is no searching of his
[59:33] understanding he giveth power to the
[59:34] faint and to them that have no might he
[59:37] increaseth strength for the Youth shall
[59:40] faint and be weary and the young men
[59:41] shall Ally fail but they that wait upon
[59:43] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[59:45] shall Mount up with wings as eagles they
[59:47] shall run and not be weary they shall
[59:49] walk and not faint now that now that now
[59:51] that wait there it means to it means to
[59:54] look patiently to to T to wait upon
[59:58] right so so if you want to endure you
[1:00:01] got to see him who's invisible right so
[1:00:04] you got to look upon him who actually
[1:00:06] the five senses don't declare you got to
[1:00:07] look upon Him by faith that's how you
[1:00:09] wait upon the Lord see if you bring God
[1:00:12] into any situation it will come out the
[1:00:14] right way right the your perspective
[1:00:16] will come out the right way everything
[1:00:18] will actually become how it's actually
[1:00:19] meant to be when you bring God into the
[1:00:21] equation see the devil does not want us
[1:00:23] to bring God into any equation of life
[1:00:25] you going through a situation you bring
[1:00:27] the word of God into it you'll get the
[1:00:29] right answer right you'll get the right
[1:00:30] perspective but if you take the word of
[1:00:32] God out and you're trying to use human
[1:00:34] reasoning trying to work things out you
[1:00:36] ain't going to end up
[1:00:38] balanced
[1:00:40] amen now brother brah would say in in in
[1:00:43] in in the reaction to an action we will
[1:00:45] get to our feet soon right he says he
[1:00:48] says
[1:00:49] now uh he says I just went through an
[1:00:51] experience of a um of that a few days
[1:00:54] ago now he's talking about when he when
[1:00:56] he when he um when when the IRS or
[1:00:59] whatever the tax man in America was
[1:01:01] calling him he just under so much strain
[1:01:02] and the phone rang he's at home and he
[1:01:04] told his wife you know tell them I'm not
[1:01:06] here but he was you know he's under this
[1:01:08] under this thing he had to make it right
[1:01:10] he says now I might just stop and tell
[1:01:11] you about it for we never want to be in
[1:01:13] any hurry now that's what's one of the
[1:01:15] great ruins of of our American Heritage
[1:01:18] today is we're trying to run over the
[1:01:20] top of everybody look like we're just
[1:01:22] trying to run uh run over the top of God
[1:01:24] not waiting they that wait upon the Lord
[1:01:27] shall renew their strength he says this
[1:01:28] is one of the ruins and I say the great
[1:01:30] ruin of of I say New Zealand Heritage as
[1:01:32] we're trying to run over the top of
[1:01:34] everybody just trying to plow on not
[1:01:36] even take anyone into consideration and
[1:01:39] not take God into consideration because
[1:01:41] remember you know how do you know how do
[1:01:44] what's the proof that you love God you
[1:01:46] love the Brethren right you can say you
[1:01:48] love God all you want but if you got a
[1:01:50] temper like a buz or indifference
[1:01:51] towards someone to some believer you
[1:01:53] don't love him right but if you really
[1:01:56] love the Lord you will love the Brethren
[1:01:58] you'll treat them with respect you'll
[1:01:59] treat them honorably you'll put them
[1:02:00] above yourself right you won't have a
[1:02:03] selfish motive in your heart all right
[1:02:05] are we all together amen this morning
[1:02:08] amen so that's why it's so it's it be
[1:02:10] such a ruin Amen to try and run over the
[1:02:12] top of you and no just just just wait on
[1:02:13] the Lord trust him all right
[1:02:17] now as was saying now that Moses could
[1:02:20] walk this walk because he was he was he
[1:02:23] was looking he was enduring cuz he saw
[1:02:25] him who is invisible now as I said
[1:02:28] earlier before there's never been a time
[1:02:30] when there's been such a such an open
[1:02:33] Vision right now but it depends what you
[1:02:37] see when you're
[1:02:38] looking
[1:02:40] see Moses did not endure because I see
[1:02:43] because of his own mental willpower or
[1:02:45] his stubbornness or determination he
[1:02:47] endured because it was the Lord in him
[1:02:49] caused them to endure ultimately it's a
[1:02:52] supernatural endurance there'll be times
[1:02:54] when you want to quit but something in
[1:02:55] you doesn't want to quit am mean you
[1:02:58] want to give up you want to go somewhere
[1:02:59] you want to you're making plans to
[1:03:01] escape but something in you says no you
[1:03:04] ain't going you ain't leaving what is
[1:03:07] that that's that Supernatural endurance
[1:03:09] amen is is is in your soul amen is is
[1:03:12] actually conducting your life now and
[1:03:15] we're going to realize that when we you
[1:03:17] know Moses if he could stand here today
[1:03:19] and we could ask him how did you endure
[1:03:21] how did you put up with all the fussing
[1:03:23] the fighting the trouble and all these
[1:03:24] things and he would say it was the Lord
[1:03:27] it wasn't me it it was the Lord am mean
[1:03:31] and we're going to realize one day when
[1:03:32] we look back at our lives we'll say
[1:03:34] We'll realize it was him the whole time
[1:03:37] it wasn't us it wasn't our ability or
[1:03:39] what we thought of them our mind being
[1:03:41] made up no it was him the whole time
[1:03:43] it's him that kept us it's him that
[1:03:45] carried us it's him that saw us through
[1:03:48] amen now he saw Moses saw Christ we
[1:03:51] understand that right he saw the
[1:03:53] invisible becoming visible by Revelation
[1:03:56] now in order to endure we must seek
[1:03:58] Christ in his word as well I mean
[1:04:01] because the message is not about brother
[1:04:02] braham's
[1:04:03] Humanity it's more than God sent a
[1:04:06] profit am mean the message is Jesus
[1:04:08] Christ the word revealed amen when you
[1:04:11] when it's reveal to you amen that this
[1:04:13] message is the is the word revealed
[1:04:15] Jesus Christ himself being made known
[1:04:17] amen then you can
[1:04:19] endure then you can endure because
[1:04:21] you're not looking at the humanity of a
[1:04:23] prophet you're not looking at even a
[1:04:25] supernatural Ministry you're seeing
[1:04:26] Christ revealed amen then you can then
[1:04:29] you can endure because you're actually
[1:04:30] seeing him who is invisible and I
[1:04:32] encourage you friends if you just hear
[1:04:34] if you just hear Brother braham's
[1:04:35] testimonies you just hear a prophet say
[1:04:37] Lord speak to me and show me you re
[1:04:40] being revealed show me the voice behind
[1:04:42] The Voice show me you in the tapes in
[1:04:45] the Bible show me you because when you
[1:04:47] see him you'll be able to endure because
[1:04:49] you're looking to him who is invisible
[1:04:51] now I mean you see Moses when he when he
[1:04:54] you know you had such a desire Lord I
[1:04:56] want to see your
[1:04:58] glory and he saw the back parts of a man
[1:05:01] right that that was how much the vision
[1:05:02] was open in his day now when John was
[1:05:05] standing on the aisle of Patmos this was
[1:05:07] after Jesus so it was after that same
[1:05:09] one became flesh purchased our Salvation
[1:05:13] rose again right and then he saw then he
[1:05:15] saw the glorified Christ right but you
[1:05:17] see now so so Moses saw the back parts
[1:05:20] of a man but then when John saw him he
[1:05:23] saw his lamb amen he saw a greater part
[1:05:27] of God than than even Moses saw
[1:05:30] hallelujah amen so it helped it caused
[1:05:33] John it gave him a strength to endure
[1:05:36] what he was going through right and
[1:05:37] that's why friends I pray that when you
[1:05:39] hear the Seven Seals you see more than
[1:05:41] horse riders you see more than the
[1:05:43] tribulation you see more than the
[1:05:44] 144,000 I mean but you see the lamb
[1:05:47] taking the book redeeming you I remember
[1:05:50] the first time I heard it I saw all the
[1:05:51] symbols it was wonderful right but the
[1:05:54] next time I listened to the seals I saw
[1:05:55] the lamb step forth taking the book
[1:05:58] claiming
[1:06:00] me amen I trust I trust it becomes such
[1:06:03] a reality to you that it's not just a
[1:06:05] nice idea or a nice song it becomes such
[1:06:08] a reality that Christ has stepped forth
[1:06:10] in this day to take you you said well
[1:06:12] how's that got to do with taking the
[1:06:14] book well brother Bram and the beree
[1:06:16] when he spoke about that he went to Ruth
[1:06:17] and Boaz and he said he said Boaz
[1:06:20] claiming Ruth is the same as the lamb
[1:06:22] taking the book which which you're part
[1:06:24] of
[1:06:26] am mean so if you can see the you if the
[1:06:28] Lord reveals those things then you can
[1:06:30] endure because you're seeing him who is
[1:06:31] invisible right you seeing just a a god
[1:06:34] from a god who's just a nice idea to a
[1:06:36] reality you see his attributes you see
[1:06:38] what he's done in your life and is doing
[1:06:42] praise the
[1:06:44] Lord amen just trying to
[1:06:46] find where I am
[1:06:50] now we we have been
[1:06:56] running two things at once it's very
[1:06:58] scary now so see so so the Apostle Paul
[1:07:02] says that now and your feet are shod
[1:07:04] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:07:06] peace so this act so this preparation
[1:07:09] means an act of preparing and it's a
[1:07:11] condition of a personal thing um so far
[1:07:15] forth as prepared that they preparedness
[1:07:18] they've got Readiness they are ready
[1:07:21] right so this means that you're actually
[1:07:22] in a condition right now that the Lord
[1:07:24] would call you go
[1:07:26] that means that's what it means you're
[1:07:28] ready see see we're dressed we we are
[1:07:29] dressed for the wedding supper now amen
[1:07:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the word
[1:07:33] of God that robes the bride is the
[1:07:35] wedding garment and you receive that
[1:07:37] wedding garment on this side right so we
[1:07:40] are actually see we got to get the faar
[1:07:41] out of the church look look there's so
[1:07:44] much uncertainty in the world right but
[1:07:46] that uncertainty doesn't have to come
[1:07:48] upon you it doesn't have to rule your
[1:07:50] life it doesn't have to govern your
[1:07:51] decisions am mean all that all that can
[1:07:54] stay out there but doesn't belong in us
[1:07:57] right so we got to realize we are
[1:07:58] dressed the the believer if you've
[1:08:00] really met the Lord you're dressed and
[1:08:01] ready to go Amen brother R would say the
[1:08:04] Rapture is in you at that
[1:08:06] moment amen hallelujah now this peace so
[1:08:10] so we so we so the our feet is shot with
[1:08:13] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:08:15] so we've been prepared amen we are now
[1:08:18] in condition now this peace it means of
[1:08:21] security it means of safety it means of
[1:08:23] prosperity I'm just wanting to read
[1:08:25] these things so you got to realize that
[1:08:26] we're walking in great
[1:08:27] peace amen it speaks of the messiah's
[1:08:31] peace my peace I give unto you not the
[1:08:33] world giveth amen it's the way that
[1:08:36] leads to peace it means of of you know
[1:08:39] in Christianity the Tranquil state of
[1:08:41] the Soul assured of its salvation
[1:08:43] through Christ so and so fearing nothing
[1:08:46] from God and content with its Earthly
[1:08:48] lot of whatsoever sort that is this is
[1:08:52] this piece that we're dressed in our
[1:08:54] feet are are we all together this
[1:08:56] morning right we're going to get this
[1:08:58] over okay amen so now we so if we've now
[1:09:01] who's ever tried to run in the frost and
[1:09:03] beer
[1:09:04] feet you can't sustain that
[1:09:07] e every first morning so when I was at
[1:09:10] boarding school the first morning of the
[1:09:12] first day of the year we had to get up
[1:09:14] at 6:00 a.m. and go for a run one
[1:09:17] morning I decided I'm going to go and
[1:09:18] bare feet that was a bad
[1:09:21] choice I still ran though I had to right
[1:09:24] but you see the thing is
[1:09:26] now my feet weren't prepared for the
[1:09:28] race right I thought of my provado yeah
[1:09:31] this will be cool yeah I'll be whatever
[1:09:33] what a dumb idea okay you get halfway
[1:09:36] through you can't feel anything your
[1:09:37] pain sets in it's like man I know how
[1:09:39] far I've got to get I can't take a
[1:09:41] shortcut I've got to get around this
[1:09:42] track I got to get back in okay but then
[1:09:45] you do it in shoes you don't suffer the
[1:09:48] same pain you can actually run with
[1:09:50] confidence you're not trying to dodge
[1:09:53] things and worry about what you going
[1:09:54] what your feet are going to step on you
[1:09:57] can walk in peace you can run in peace
[1:10:00] right it's the same thing now in this in
[1:10:02] this walk that we find ourselves in our
[1:10:04] feet are Shaw we're wearing the right
[1:10:07] kind of shoes so we don't need to fear
[1:10:09] what we stand in right you can stand in
[1:10:12] some doggy DW you can stand in it but
[1:10:14] you keep
[1:10:15] walking right you can stand on thistles
[1:10:18] prickles whatever it doesn't affect you
[1:10:21] why bare feet it does right but if your
[1:10:24] feet if if you're we wearing the right
[1:10:25] shoes then you don't need to worry about
[1:10:27] anything you can walk on now you got to
[1:10:30] realize that that
[1:10:32] that the shoes we wear are ordained by
[1:10:35] God right and they've given us authority
[1:10:38] to walk in places that no one else is
[1:10:40] ordained to walk in so you got to
[1:10:42] realize that actually as Christ has
[1:10:44] supreme authority he's given that
[1:10:46] Authority into his church right if we
[1:10:48] walk with God under his word that same
[1:10:50] Authority he has he's given to us now we
[1:10:54] read Psalm 9 1 Psalm 91 actually speaks
[1:10:57] of us you going to read the whole
[1:10:58] chapter I've just got these few verses
[1:10:59] here he says for he shall give us Angels
[1:11:02] charge over thee to keep thee in all thy
[1:11:04] ways amen we're not alone in this walk
[1:11:07] amen they shall bear thee up in their
[1:11:08] hands least thou Dash thy foot against a
[1:11:10] stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and
[1:11:13] Adder this is where you're ordained to
[1:11:14] walk okay Thou shalt tread upon the lion
[1:11:16] and Adder the Young Lion and the dragon
[1:11:18] Thou shalt trample under feet I mean
[1:11:21] because he has set his love upon me
[1:11:23] therefore will I deliver him I have I
[1:11:25] will set him on high because he hath
[1:11:27] known my name he shall call upon me and
[1:11:31] I'll answer him he will be with me in
[1:11:33] trouble I will deliver him and honor him
[1:11:35] with a long life will I satisfy him and
[1:11:37] show him my salvation praise the Lord
[1:11:41] amen so so we we we've been ordained now
[1:11:43] now this should not be a shock to any of
[1:11:45] us we're ordained God has commissioned
[1:11:48] us to stand on the head of the
[1:11:51] enemy when he's talking about trampling
[1:11:53] on on on the adder and lung Young Lions
[1:11:56] and the dragon son these are demon
[1:11:57] powers that rise up to try and usurp
[1:12:00] your god-given Authority amen but so we
[1:12:02] going to realize that we are ordained
[1:12:04] see see the devil wants to challenge Us
[1:12:07] by what Authority do you have see even
[1:12:09] when the apostles were brought before
[1:12:11] the Sanhedrin they basically asked what
[1:12:13] Authority do you have to preach these
[1:12:14] things to do these things and Peter said
[1:12:17] God gave us this Authority now this is
[1:12:19] not verbatim but just you know basically
[1:12:20] he said no God commissioned us when he
[1:12:23] said in Mark 16 you shall cast out
[1:12:25] devils in my name I've given you given
[1:12:27] you authority over every work of the
[1:12:29] enemy right now that power and authority
[1:12:32] is still in the church the morning right
[1:12:34] we have God has not taken it away he's
[1:12:36] not diminished it one bit no but we're
[1:12:38] living in a time of an open Vision where
[1:12:40] we realize that we have all authority
[1:12:43] over every work of darkness and it's not
[1:12:46] man-made Authority that has given it to
[1:12:48] us it's god-given Authority has placed
[1:12:50] the bride above every demon power above
[1:12:53] every work of the enemy right but where
[1:12:55] got to realize that we're walking in
[1:12:57] peace and it's the messiah's peace right
[1:12:59] it's not it's not a mental see peace is
[1:13:02] not some tranquil sitting with your
[1:13:04] favorite cup of coffee and there's no
[1:13:07] problems that is not that is not peace
[1:13:10] that's man that's manufactured peace but
[1:13:13] it's not the peace of God you see the
[1:13:15] peace of God passes all understanding
[1:13:18] where where the world can be literally
[1:13:19] falling apart but you can have such a
[1:13:21] peace in that shaking amen that you
[1:13:23] don't need to fear anything I remember
[1:13:24] when and Chris I know I've shared it but
[1:13:26] I want to share it again amen chrisy and
[1:13:28] I were in the first uh Christ Church
[1:13:29] earthquake the place it wasn't a gentle
[1:13:31] rock it was a very violent shaking up
[1:13:33] and down left and right and we got down
[1:13:35] to our front door and we started having
[1:13:37] a prayer meeting I wanted to I wanted to
[1:13:39] keep my eyes open and look around but I
[1:13:41] said no I can't focus on what I see I've
[1:13:44] got to focus on calling on the Lord
[1:13:46] right because you you've got a decision
[1:13:48] in every circumstance will you go by
[1:13:50] with what you see cuz you think about it
[1:13:52] you're in an earthquake you've got to
[1:13:54] your safety place
[1:13:55] but even even if you can't get to one
[1:13:57] what good is it watching the roof
[1:14:00] Shake how's that going to help you you
[1:14:02] say well I can dodge it you can't really
[1:14:04] Dodge things when you can't even really
[1:14:05] move when you're being shaken around
[1:14:07] like a thing right so what good would
[1:14:10] that help us you say but then what good
[1:14:13] would prayer do well God prayer brings
[1:14:16] God into the situation because it turns
[1:14:18] into a worship amen and the spirit of
[1:14:20] God came down when the world was shaking
[1:14:22] and we've never been in anything like
[1:14:23] that before when the world was shaking
[1:14:25] we called God on the scene called out to
[1:14:27] him and the spirit of God came down and
[1:14:28] we had a glorious time it was a
[1:14:30] tremendous time of prayer
[1:14:34] Hallelujah so we don't need to fear
[1:14:36] anything but you got to bring God into
[1:14:38] into your situation amen because we're
[1:14:40] ordained remember this so so so this
[1:14:43] peace gives us the authority over the
[1:14:47] devil amen we got to realize we're
[1:14:49] commissioned we're not commissioned by a
[1:14:51] country we're not commissioned by a
[1:14:52] church we're commissioned by almighty
[1:14:54] God amen that we're ordained to walk in
[1:14:57] this peace that passes all understanding
[1:14:58] so we had a great Peace during an
[1:15:00] earthquake humanly it doesn't make sense
[1:15:03] but we but God was with us God was
[1:15:05] present it was the three of us in the
[1:15:07] house and we had a glorious time so we
[1:15:09] had a peace that passed all
[1:15:12] understanding amen so so we have been
[1:15:14] given a god-given authority to trample
[1:15:17] on the works of the enemy amen the devil
[1:15:19] has been placed under our feet I think
[1:15:21] brother Isaac said it this morning he's
[1:15:23] been placed under our feet we got to w
[1:15:24] recognize that amen so so to to treat on
[1:15:28] to trample means you have the authority
[1:15:30] you you have authority over every Power
[1:15:32] of the enemy and you're ordained to
[1:15:34] stand on the head of the enemy amen but
[1:15:37] you've got to bring God you've got to
[1:15:39] bring God into your situation now I I
[1:15:42] haven't asked her this but you know um a
[1:15:44] couple of days ago Saturday morning had
[1:15:47] this uh Christine well we actually both
[1:15:49] had a dream was interesting we're both
[1:15:50] very different dreams but you know she
[1:15:52] had a dream where she went into this
[1:15:53] room and there's all these sisters in
[1:15:55] there and there's a demon-possessed
[1:15:56] person in the middle of the room and
[1:15:57] everyone's panicking and upset and
[1:15:59] stress and all these things and and but
[1:16:01] she realized by Revelation I have
[1:16:03] authority over the spirit so she told
[1:16:05] everyone start worshiping the Lord and
[1:16:08] so it went from a panic to now God came
[1:16:11] down you know every because the thing is
[1:16:13] what happens is a spirit will try and
[1:16:15] get you under its influence like you
[1:16:17] take someone and you yeah I'm sure
[1:16:20] you've ever seen it but you know people
[1:16:23] people who try and you know a spirit
[1:16:25] will get on someone and will try and get
[1:16:27] you to sympathize it by that person
[1:16:29] becoming very emotional you talk to
[1:16:32] someone you want to correct them
[1:16:33] something's not right you got to talk
[1:16:34] about something right and they'll get
[1:16:36] instantly very emotional their tears
[1:16:38] will start running it's not even a
[1:16:39] normal thing you know from one minute
[1:16:41] they're happy next minute it's just like
[1:16:42] Water Works and all these things what is
[1:16:44] that that's a spirit trying to get you
[1:16:46] under its control if you sympathized
[1:16:49] with their emotion then that Spirit can
[1:16:51] start to control you in the situation
[1:16:53] but you see we're not ordained
[1:16:55] we're not ordained to to to sympathize
[1:16:58] with with Spirit see that's that's being
[1:17:01] emotionally
[1:17:02] manipulated right and it's the same
[1:17:05] thing in that dream where where where
[1:17:07] all those sisters who are in that room
[1:17:08] they came under the influence of that
[1:17:10] spirit because they being scared and
[1:17:12] worried and panicking seeing the demon
[1:17:14] manifest right but then now when when
[1:17:16] when Christine told them start
[1:17:17] worshiping what happened is is instead
[1:17:20] of coming under the influence of that
[1:17:21] Spirit they brought God down into the
[1:17:23] situation where he could take control
[1:17:25] she had perfect peace going into that
[1:17:27] room right but now the others forgot
[1:17:29] their position that's why we should not
[1:17:31] get upset we shouldn't get worried we
[1:17:33] should you say well I'm feeling worried
[1:17:35] about something call God on the scene
[1:17:37] because prayer and worship puts God in
[1:17:39] control right it gives God the right of
[1:17:41] way amen stress and worry does not give
[1:17:44] God the right of way you take that
[1:17:45] stress and worry to God in prayer and
[1:17:47] you watch him come on the scene I mean
[1:17:49] so so so once they all started
[1:17:50] worshiping then she rebuked that spirit
[1:17:52] and left the person right and then and
[1:17:55] then I had a dream it's probably kind of
[1:17:56] opposite where I was we were overseas
[1:17:59] somewhere and this little church was all
[1:18:00] white and these things and you know
[1:18:02] there was no song service no no music no
[1:18:04] nothing and I tried to get up and preach
[1:18:05] and everyone started interjecting and
[1:18:07] talking and all these things there was
[1:18:08] no order there why because the people
[1:18:11] weren't and and then well I got woken up
[1:18:13] by a four-year-old landing on my head
[1:18:15] but anyway you know but you see you know
[1:18:17] there was he just clapped with that
[1:18:19] anyway but you see you see so because
[1:18:22] the people weren't under the spirit of
[1:18:24] God
[1:18:25] it brought a chaos everyone's opinion
[1:18:27] you know started talking about the
[1:18:28] Apostle Paul and some kid got up and
[1:18:30] said now let's read all the quotes and
[1:18:31] scriptures about the Apostle Paul like
[1:18:32] seg w everything it's just a total chaos
[1:18:35] you see we can't take it take things
[1:18:37] into our own our own hands got to let
[1:18:39] God you say well I'm going through a
[1:18:41] Troublesome time have you let God take
[1:18:43] it or are you holding on to it you know
[1:18:46] you got to commit it all into his hands
[1:18:48] and then praise him and trust him that
[1:18:49] he is in
[1:18:50] control
[1:18:53] amen amen
[1:18:55] now you
[1:18:57] see this this in Hebrews 11 here seeing
[1:19:00] him who's invisible right it means to be
[1:19:03] acquainted with by experience to
[1:19:05] experience so it sure it means to see
[1:19:08] with the eyes but we see Moses did not
[1:19:10] see God by natural eyes he he he became
[1:19:14] acquainted with him acquainted with him
[1:19:16] at the burning bush so he could walk he
[1:19:19] could walk by by faith and not by sight
[1:19:23] now brother says and looking to the
[1:19:24] Unseen if there ever was a time that the
[1:19:26] church needs to step across that line
[1:19:28] which separates you between faith and
[1:19:30] unbelief by sight and looking at the
[1:19:32] Unseen by faith it's
[1:19:34] now that's when we leave everything
[1:19:36] behind you every care every weary
[1:19:38] everything that says you can't be a
[1:19:40] Christian i've smoked too long I've
[1:19:41] drank too long brother Braham I've lived
[1:19:43] in adultery I don't care what you say
[1:19:46] and what you've done though your sins be
[1:19:48] as Scarlet you once pass that line of
[1:19:51] barrier of the devil trying to torment
[1:19:53] you saying you can't do it you can't do
[1:19:55] it I say I can do it for Jesus said
[1:19:59] whosoever will let him come and drink
[1:20:00] from the Waters of of the Fountain of
[1:20:02] Life freely leave it behind amen so we
[1:20:06] got to take we we must take those things
[1:20:09] the devil says you can't do and you've
[1:20:10] got to leave all those things behind now
[1:20:13] there's a great thing in this day where
[1:20:15] well I just I'll just come to this slide
[1:20:17] brother says this in the same same
[1:20:19] message see it doesn't take an
[1:20:21] intellectual mind it takes a surrendered
[1:20:23] heart to the will of God God am mean so
[1:20:26] now you say well none of us are
[1:20:28] intellectual
[1:20:30] well intellectualism is not just is not
[1:20:35] just being very learned being educated
[1:20:38] that's not an intellectual mind
[1:20:40] necessarily right that's just being
[1:20:42] educated but an intellectual mind is
[1:20:44] examining every point and and and wait
[1:20:49] let's see if I can find this here make
[1:20:50] sure I get it all right here see an
[1:20:52] intellectual mind is not necessarily a a
[1:20:54] educated mind many times we think an ed
[1:20:57] um intellectual mind as some great Bible
[1:20:59] scholar some great scholarship that gone
[1:21:02] through great Halls of learning but an
[1:21:03] intellectual mind is someone who must
[1:21:06] understand everything that they've got
[1:21:08] to get in order in their mind or their
[1:21:10] feelings their memories have everything
[1:21:12] sorted out then they then they say they
[1:21:14] have faith but that is not having faith
[1:21:16] that's just trying to get everything
[1:21:17] sorted in your mind right is trying to
[1:21:20] reconcile you know I feel this way and
[1:21:23] this is going on and this is happened
[1:21:24] and see that's an intellectualism you
[1:21:27] see but we're not but an intellectual
[1:21:29] mind can never do it it takes us
[1:21:31] surrendered it takes a surrendered heart
[1:21:33] to the will of God Amen so we've got to
[1:21:36] lay aside those things you say well I've
[1:21:38] got to work this out then I can believe
[1:21:39] it no that's not faith faith receives it
[1:21:42] before they see anything they hear
[1:21:44] anything they even before they
[1:21:46] understand it amen they receive the word
[1:21:49] and then God will bring the
[1:21:50] understanding you see the world has it
[1:21:52] vice versa I need all the facts then can
[1:21:54] believe no that's not even Faith that's
[1:21:56] just receiving facts right but faith is
[1:21:59] a genuine I receive the word and then
[1:22:01] God will bring everything into order
[1:22:04] amen you see it's you it's very it's you
[1:22:06] know so don't try and intellectualize
[1:22:08] see the devil will try and
[1:22:09] intellectualize the word to you and
[1:22:11] he'll always pin you down with it
[1:22:13] remember remember last Sunday or the
[1:22:15] Sunday before I was talking about you
[1:22:16] know the you know there was that um you
[1:22:18] wrestling match you we're in this great
[1:22:20] wrestling match going on and you know a
[1:22:22] wrestler comes out they've got all these
[1:22:24] intellect sexual beads around their
[1:22:25] trunks that won't help nothing so all
[1:22:28] these trinkets of well I understand this
[1:22:30] and this doctr means this and you know
[1:22:32] my feelings are like this therefore I've
[1:22:34] got faith here I don't have faith here
[1:22:35] all these things that's just
[1:22:36] intellectual beads and you get pinned by
[1:22:39] the enemy on the mat sure as ever amen
[1:22:41] but but if you've got a hidden strength
[1:22:43] of and what is that hidden strength God
[1:22:45] said so I'm his child his word is right
[1:22:48] in every condition irrespective of how I
[1:22:51] feel what I'm going through the things I
[1:22:53] remember see the devil will take your
[1:22:55] memory anoint it but pervert it and
[1:22:57] never bring you out bringing the victory
[1:22:59] right he'll always take your memories
[1:23:01] your conscious affection reasoning
[1:23:02] affections all those things right and
[1:23:04] he'll take it against you you see but
[1:23:06] that's how the intellectual mind he
[1:23:08] wants to keep us on an intellectual
[1:23:09] thought of does it make sense you know
[1:23:13] he tries to complicate it with all every
[1:23:15] smallest trying to work out all the
[1:23:16] smallest details I say that is not faith
[1:23:19] that is being
[1:23:20] intellectual so we need to we need to
[1:23:23] lay aside those things
[1:23:25] now I'm just I feel like I'm segwaying
[1:23:27] all over the place but we'll end up
[1:23:29] somewhere maybe we're just doing a Ticky
[1:23:30] tour but you see
[1:23:33] now the oh wait where is that one anyway
[1:23:38] well we're
[1:23:39] here now this is quite you think about
[1:23:42] you know it's very easy to read things
[1:23:44] and just gloss over them right the
[1:23:48] Apostle Paul says here now see that none
[1:23:49] render evil for evil unto unto any man
[1:23:52] but ever follow that which is good but
[1:23:54] both among yourselves and to all men
[1:23:55] Rejoice everm more pray without ceasing
[1:23:58] and everything give thanks for this is
[1:24:00] the will of God in Christ Jesus
[1:24:02] concerning you now the Waymouth uh New
[1:24:05] Testament translation says in every
[1:24:07] circumstance of Life be thankful for
[1:24:09] this is God's will in Christ Jesus
[1:24:11] respecting you so the Apostle Paul is
[1:24:13] saying whatever state you find yourself
[1:24:15] in that's God's
[1:24:17] will now now I'm not talking about being
[1:24:19] in sin now but I'm talking about well
[1:24:21] I'm going through a valley that's the
[1:24:22] will of God concerning you I'm on a
[1:24:24] mountain that's the will of God
[1:24:26] concerning you I'm distressed we got a
[1:24:28] great problem in our life that's the
[1:24:30] will of God concerning you amen you see
[1:24:33] see because many times you know because
[1:24:35] we're think talking about being shod you
[1:24:36] our feet shod with the preparation of
[1:24:38] the gospel of peace right so you think
[1:24:39] now if if our footsteps are ordained of
[1:24:42] the Lord you know then then we're going
[1:24:44] to have a perfect walk but what does
[1:24:46] that even mean who wants a perfect
[1:24:49] walk right now remember the devil will
[1:24:51] take an idea humanize it
[1:24:54] and it's always P opposite to how God
[1:24:56] says it should be and then so we think
[1:24:58] well I'm not having this perfect walk
[1:25:00] that I've actually imagined is not true
[1:25:02] therefore I'm not an overcoming
[1:25:03] Christian but a perfect walk is is see
[1:25:06] see many times we think a perfect walk
[1:25:08] is we have no worry the Devil Comes
[1:25:11] against us there's no problem we just
[1:25:13] overcome him we never put a foot wrong
[1:25:15] everything goes fine yep ises that
[1:25:18] that's my definition of a perfect walk I
[1:25:20] never have any doubts I never have any
[1:25:22] fluster I never feel carnal I never you
[1:25:25] know worry and you know I never have any
[1:25:27] trouble right isn't that what you think
[1:25:29] a perfect walk is but that's not how God
[1:25:31] says a perfect Walkers no not at all
[1:25:34] because the APO and surely if I have
[1:25:36] this perfect walk I will never be in any
[1:25:38] kind of dark place trouble a valley no
[1:25:42] but you see fruit is not growing on the
[1:25:45] Mountaintop it's growing in the valley
[1:25:47] and then what does even Jesus say I am
[1:25:49] the vine you're the branches right and
[1:25:51] then I'm basically going to prune you
[1:25:52] that you bear more fruit am mean she
[1:25:55] said well I'm going through a real
[1:25:56] pruning time I feel all like there's
[1:25:57] just nothing going on I'm going through
[1:25:59] hardship that's the will of God
[1:26:00] concerning you you say well that's a
[1:26:04] that's quite a mouthful to swallow but
[1:26:07] it is this is what the apost this is
[1:26:08] what God's telling the Apostle Paul here
[1:26:10] whatever state you find yourself in be
[1:26:12] content for this is the will of God
[1:26:14] concerning you amen this is God's will
[1:26:16] so because a perfect walk is not one
[1:26:19] without trouble it has trouble it has
[1:26:21] hardship it has questions it has times
[1:26:24] when we feel overwhelmed and we can't go
[1:26:25] on that's actually part of a perfect
[1:26:27] walk because through all of those things
[1:26:30] I mean God God is wanting to express
[1:26:33] himself he's wanting to reveal himself
[1:26:35] through it now I'm just trying to find
[1:26:37] you know even even you know the you you
[1:26:41] think about the Apostle Paul before he
[1:26:43] became a Christian he didn't have any
[1:26:45] trouble the only trouble he had was was
[1:26:47] trying to find a better argument than
[1:26:49] the next guy in his Ivory Tower and then
[1:26:52] the and then and then the next trouble
[1:26:53] he had was I going to destroy this this
[1:26:55] this cult that's risen up of Jesus
[1:26:57] Christ of Nazareth he wasn't Shipwrecked
[1:26:59] at that time he you know he was never
[1:27:02] beaten he was never thrown into prison
[1:27:04] he was never run out of town by a copper
[1:27:06] Smith he never had trouble with with
[1:27:08] with false brethren in the church he he
[1:27:10] he never had any of those troubles but
[1:27:12] you see when he became a Christian what
[1:27:14] his feet actually got shod with the
[1:27:16] preparation of the gospel of peace amen
[1:27:18] that he would now he because he was now
[1:27:19] going to walk through trouble but you
[1:27:21] could say the Apostle Paul had a perfect
[1:27:23] walk
[1:27:24] I mean because he said when he came to
[1:27:26] the end of it he said I have a Crown of
[1:27:28] Life awaiting me not only me also but
[1:27:30] all those that love his his appearing
[1:27:32] right do you see now the Apostle Paul
[1:27:34] you say well he went through a lot of
[1:27:36] hardship that wasn't on account of
[1:27:39] him right God had to take him through
[1:27:41] those things that finally when he came
[1:27:44] to this he says I have learned for
[1:27:46] whatsoever State I am therefore to be
[1:27:48] content remember he' write to Timothy
[1:27:50] and say it's getting cold Winter's
[1:27:52] coming bring my coat
[1:27:54] here's a man who had the who's a prophet
[1:27:56] age messenger Prophet messenger for the
[1:27:58] age I mean he wrote most of the New
[1:28:00] Testament but yet he he he would end up
[1:28:03] in prison he'd say and and and he would
[1:28:05] be so you know uh so what do you call it
[1:28:08] have basically nothing he'd tell Timothy
[1:28:10] bring my coat that I left behind he' say
[1:28:13] I had a thorn in the flesh the Satan
[1:28:14] buffeting me right but he had a perfect
[1:28:18] walk those things actually were not even
[1:28:21] part of oh you'd say well if that
[1:28:22] happened you know if he had this thing
[1:28:24] going on how could he have a perfect
[1:28:26] walk no God ordained his steps you see
[1:28:28] it's the same thing with brother Braham
[1:28:30] everything he went through the hardship
[1:28:31] he went through you see that all got him
[1:28:34] to a point that he's in Sabino Canyon
[1:28:35] the sword came in his hand am mean the
[1:28:37] king's word amen a an adopted son could
[1:28:40] receive a word amen to preach to the
[1:28:42] bride of Christ all those things were
[1:28:44] ordained in his life I would say humanly
[1:28:47] he did not have a perfect walk because
[1:28:48] of all that hardship but looking from
[1:28:50] God's perspective God ordained his steps
[1:28:54] to walk through all those
[1:28:56] things would we agree amen because he
[1:28:59] never got to a stage in his life where
[1:29:01] God said no the third pole you
[1:29:03] can't you can't have it the opening of
[1:29:06] the word you can't actually the whole
[1:29:07] point of your ministry you can't have no
[1:29:09] God ordained his steps to get him to
[1:29:11] that position that he would receive the
[1:29:13] word and fulfill his commission amen so
[1:29:15] it's the same thing with us friends you
[1:29:17] say well my walk is far from perfect are
[1:29:19] you
[1:29:21] sure are you walking with the word do
[1:29:24] you love him amen do you love him do you
[1:29:27] want more of him I say well then your
[1:29:29] walk is perfect you say well my bank
[1:29:31] account's full of zeros does that mean
[1:29:33] your walk's not perfect as and and
[1:29:35] there's no one before the zeros I just
[1:29:36] said zeros right you say I don't I don't
[1:29:39] know what tomorrow brings does that mean
[1:29:41] your walk is not perfect it's a perfect
[1:29:44] walk you see we've been where I find
[1:29:47] this here see the steps of a good man
[1:29:50] are ordered by the Lord do we believe
[1:29:52] that see an intellectual man will look
[1:29:54] at that and say well if the ordered of
[1:29:56] God then certain things must take place
[1:29:59] right this will happen I'll be blessed
[1:30:02] this way this is how this is going to
[1:30:04] work out this is how I'm going to feel
[1:30:06] you know going to analyze everything but
[1:30:08] you see an intellectual mind cannot
[1:30:09] receive it no it's it's a surrendered
[1:30:12] heart to the will of God you see and if
[1:30:14] you really realize that the state you're
[1:30:16] in is the will of God concerning you see
[1:30:20] that scripture that scripture covers
[1:30:21] every situ if you're a Believer now if
[1:30:23] you're not a Believer become a Believer
[1:30:26] right then you can really rest in
[1:30:27] whatever state you're in if you're not
[1:30:29] well get into the get into the um City
[1:30:31] of Refuge as fast as you can but you see
[1:30:34] our footsteps are ordered by the Lord
[1:30:36] and it's easy to look back in history
[1:30:38] and say well Moses yes of course his
[1:30:39] steps were ordered and yes yo Joseph his
[1:30:42] steps were ordered and Jacob's steps
[1:30:44] were ordered and all these ones were
[1:30:45] ordered but what about
[1:30:47] you what about you could you realize
[1:30:49] actually God has brought you here for a
[1:30:51] specific purpose for a certain time I
[1:30:53] could even say that the thief on the
[1:30:55] cross's walk was
[1:30:57] perfect God allowed him you say well you
[1:31:00] know people have gone through great
[1:31:01] hardship why would that see the
[1:31:02] analytical mind would say or the
[1:31:05] intellectual mind would say the thief
[1:31:07] did not deserve what he received because
[1:31:10] of his previous life had nothing to do
[1:31:12] with it God God allowed him because God
[1:31:15] allows everything to do everything he
[1:31:18] did now now this is not a small thing
[1:31:20] this ain't to me this is not skim milk
[1:31:22] cuz you look at what he did he he he
[1:31:24] earned his position on the cross the
[1:31:27] thief did he earned it he he was not
[1:31:29] some guy who was just in the wrong place
[1:31:31] in the wrong time with the wrong company
[1:31:33] no he earned that he earned that but he
[1:31:37] was ordained to be one of the last or
[1:31:39] the last saint of the Old Testament to
[1:31:42] be sealed away amen and and God ordained
[1:31:45] that he would come to that position to
[1:31:47] show you and I that doesn't matter what
[1:31:50] we've been through what we've
[1:31:52] done mer still there if you look and
[1:31:55] look to the Unseen amen look Beyond the
[1:31:58] Veil and see the Lamb of
[1:32:00] God hallelujah so I say his footsteps
[1:32:02] were ordered he wasn't a good man well
[1:32:05] he actually was a good man because he
[1:32:08] saw the Messiah in his day that's what
[1:32:11] makes a man a good man sure there's
[1:32:13] Christian basic Christian principles all
[1:32:15] those things but you see what made him
[1:32:16] good to me is because he didn't see
[1:32:18] Jesus like the scribes and Pharisees he
[1:32:21] didn't see Jesus like like the Roman
[1:32:23] soldiers he saw
[1:32:25] Messiah amen his footsteps were ordered
[1:32:28] now I feel like we're you see it's not
[1:32:31] so what is that what is that um heart
[1:32:34] that surrendered to the will of God the
[1:32:35] will of God is the word of God that's
[1:32:38] what it takes doesn't take an intellect
[1:32:39] you just got to receive the word by
[1:32:41] faith and walk on right we can't you
[1:32:43] can't stand there see the devil loves to
[1:32:45] analyze everything over and over and
[1:32:47] over again and this is the age of
[1:32:49] analytics even even Sports people they
[1:32:51] wear these certain GPS things and it
[1:32:54] measures the you know the badges as they
[1:32:55] practice and they and they compete
[1:32:57] measures their heart rate their
[1:32:58] everything you know their steps they can
[1:33:00] follow themselves on the field map it
[1:33:02] all out everything it's it's incredible
[1:33:04] time of analytics is it not and the
[1:33:07] devil wants to take the same thing into
[1:33:08] our Christian walk you got to analyze
[1:33:10] everything you don't have to analyze
[1:33:12] anything walk by faith take God at his
[1:33:15] word and walk on I mean cuz otherwise
[1:33:17] you'll be sitting in the devil's dark
[1:33:19] room trying to analyze everything and
[1:33:21] you'll be caught up in his hamster wheel
[1:33:23] of trying to say well this and this and
[1:33:25] that and that you say forget that no it
[1:33:27] takes a surrendered heart to the will of
[1:33:29] God Amen and that's what we want I
[1:33:32] believe that's what we have
[1:33:34] amen praise the Lord now I'm just going
[1:33:36] to because time time's slipping away so
[1:33:39] I just want
[1:33:40] to see we have to accept the word by
[1:33:44] Revelation right brother Bram would you
[1:33:47] know he was approached by a Baptist
[1:33:48] ministry he says we just got to
[1:33:50] basically just get the Greek
[1:33:52] straightened out and then and then you
[1:33:54] know everything will be fine see we got
[1:33:56] to get we'll never be able brother Bram
[1:33:58] to get the things together till we get
[1:33:59] every word upon word upon word exactly
[1:34:02] with the Greek and so forth I said oh
[1:34:04] sir you better you uh you know better
[1:34:06] than that I said even in the nice year
[1:34:08] councel way back as far as 300 years
[1:34:10] from the death of Christ they were still
[1:34:11] debating which Greek scholar was right
[1:34:14] you can know it's a revelation the whole
[1:34:18] thing now there's nothing wrong with
[1:34:20] taking the Greek and taking all the
[1:34:21] scripture and the quotes but you got to
[1:34:23] have the power of God to reveal it to
[1:34:24] you so you can't just analyze it all and
[1:34:26] say well this make sense no that's all
[1:34:28] fine but the but God has got to reveal
[1:34:31] it to you that it becomes a reality and
[1:34:34] then he says I cannot accept Revelation
[1:34:36] and I said then how can you accept
[1:34:38] Christ you see unless you're willing to
[1:34:40] accept the word by faith you can't
[1:34:42] accept Christ you can you can accept a
[1:34:44] historical idea of of of him dying on
[1:34:47] the cross but it's got to become a
[1:34:49] revelation cuz he is his word amen now
[1:34:54] let's go back to this thought the steps
[1:34:55] of a good man are ordered of the
[1:34:58] lord we read this in Psalms the other
[1:35:00] day in family prayer says now the Lord
[1:35:02] is the portion of mine inheritance and
[1:35:03] of my cup thou maintain us my lot the
[1:35:07] lines have fallen unto me in Pleasant
[1:35:08] places yay I have a goodly Heritage I
[1:35:11] Will Bless The Lord who hath given me
[1:35:13] counsel my Reigns also instruct me in
[1:35:15] the night Seasons I have set the lord
[1:35:17] always before me because he is at my
[1:35:19] right hand I shall not be moved so in
[1:35:21] other words I will endure CU I've set
[1:35:24] the lord always before me now we got to
[1:35:27] realize that with this with our feet
[1:35:29] shot with the preparation of the gospel
[1:35:30] of peace now God has given us a goodly
[1:35:33] Heritage to walk in right he's given us
[1:35:36] like Abraham was told walk around the
[1:35:37] land whatever you see is yours right
[1:35:40] Joshua was told footsteps mean
[1:35:42] possession walk up the breadth of the
[1:35:44] land this is your inheritance right so
[1:35:46] he was ordained to walk in every place
[1:35:49] that God ordained him to walk so we're
[1:35:50] going to realize that as Joshua was
[1:35:52] given Authority to walk on every promise
[1:35:55] receive every promise so do we right but
[1:35:59] we've got to receive it by faith not by
[1:36:01] an intellectual understanding amen say
[1:36:04] he says the the lies are Fallen unto me
[1:36:06] in Pleasant places that means the lines
[1:36:08] are your inheritance they're fallen in
[1:36:10] Pleasant places have they not today I
[1:36:12] just want to say let's walk in peace
[1:36:15] let's walk in peace doesn't matter
[1:36:16] doesn't matter what because our what is
[1:36:18] our inheritance that we have authority
[1:36:21] and dominion over every work of the
[1:36:23] enemy
[1:36:24] that every promise Jesus died on Calvary
[1:36:27] for to receive we would receive every
[1:36:29] Redemptive blessing of Jehovah God is
[1:36:32] ours is yours amen it's yours this so
[1:36:35] this is your inheritance so walk in it
[1:36:38] never let the devil push against you say
[1:36:39] you don't deserve it you don't you're
[1:36:41] actually not even in the question you
[1:36:43] see it's like if I was Elon Musk who's
[1:36:46] valued at I don't know how many billion
[1:36:48] now and I said I give half of it to to
[1:36:51] brother Ed
[1:36:56] now you can fuss at him all you want
[1:36:59] saying well you don't deserve that Ed
[1:37:00] I've got greater needs in my family but
[1:37:02] he could say it wasn't up to him it was
[1:37:06] up to me you see and so what does the
[1:37:08] devil do God says I give you all things
[1:37:10] in Christ Jesus right I give I give you
[1:37:13] every promise every promise of the
[1:37:14] message every promise of the Bible is
[1:37:16] yours the devil fusses at you saying you
[1:37:19] don't deserve to receive it and for some
[1:37:21] reason we have to feel like we have to
[1:37:23] defend our ourselves and reply to him
[1:37:26] right but what we really should say is
[1:37:27] devil see what is that when he F you
[1:37:30] have that feeling come in your heart I'm
[1:37:32] not worthy I can't receive this I've
[1:37:34] done too much wrong look at my past look
[1:37:36] at my current day look at what I'm going
[1:37:38] see that's the devil coming at you
[1:37:39] saying it's not yours but you've got to
[1:37:41] take that and say Satan I wasn't the one
[1:37:44] who gave it to me I wasn't the one who
[1:37:46] gave it to me I did not come and get
[1:37:48] this no it came to me amen every
[1:37:50] Redemptive blessing of God has come to
[1:37:52] me through the message of the hour so
[1:37:54] Satan you are actually fussing with the
[1:37:55] wrong person go talk to the one who's
[1:37:58] given it out take up your fuss with him
[1:38:01] amen so we're going to stop arguing with
[1:38:03] the devil about what we deserve and we
[1:38:05] just got to receive what God has
[1:38:07] given amen we to realize that our lies
[1:38:09] have fallen Toto me in Pleasant places
[1:38:11] yay I have a goodly Heritage amen we're
[1:38:14] going to we're going to just walk in
[1:38:16] peace because that same word peace there
[1:38:19] in Ephesians is the same peace that God
[1:38:21] told Mary who anointed his feet with you
[1:38:23] know with oil and Simon the Pharisees
[1:38:25] house how how how Jesus said to her thy
[1:38:27] sins be forgiven thee go in peace it's
[1:38:30] the same peace go in the messiah's peace
[1:38:32] and we are walking in that same Peace So
[1:38:35] what's the summary of all this whatever
[1:38:37] situation you come in realize let the
[1:38:40] peace of God rule it well how do I do
[1:38:42] that worship and praise God don't try
[1:38:46] and take it under your own control cuz
[1:38:49] prayer what does prayer do it puts God
[1:38:51] in control right don't try and work out
[1:38:53] in your own mind how things are going to
[1:38:54] happen commit it to the Lord have a
[1:38:57] conversation with your counselor and he
[1:38:59] will bring a resolution right and
[1:39:02] realize that you are ordained no matter
[1:39:04] what enemy comes against you that Spirit
[1:39:07] whatever Devil Comes against you all of
[1:39:08] Hell could come against you you got to
[1:39:10] realize you've been you've been given a
[1:39:13] footwear to trample on every single one
