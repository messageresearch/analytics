[15:30] you can maybe just turn me down you in
[15:32] the front
[15:33] i got one of those voices i don't like
[15:35] to
[15:38] god bless you saints
[15:40] testimony evening
[15:43] testimony evening so what we're going to
[15:44] do is we're first going to open up a
[15:47] and read a scripture and just open the
[15:48] evening up and we'll pray and then we'll
[15:50] open up for testimonies and after that i
[15:53] want to share just a little thought
[15:56] and then we'll go in to pray together
[15:57] and we'll just pray and if there's any
[15:59] pre-request we'll we'll address them as
[16:01] we go
[16:02] amen so if you all just stand and we're
[16:04] just going to go to john 19.
[16:10] and then we're going to read the
[16:13] verse 28 to
[16:15] 30.
[16:20] amen
[16:23] good evening saints
[16:25] i love wednesdays
[16:27] because it's such a mission to get here
[16:29] sometimes eh and then the whole day
[16:31] everything goes wrong and everybody's
[16:33] working on your nerves and then you work
[16:34] on your own nerves and then everybody
[16:36] else works on your nerves with you and
[16:39] it's tough
[16:41] but we made it brother isaac we made it
[16:44] amen we're winners it's all rigged
[16:47] it's all rigged amen and it's the truth
[16:50] okay so let's read this it's a it's a
[16:52] it's a little bit hard but it's going to
[16:54] just tie into what i want to share with
[16:55] you tonight afterwards
[16:57] and it will definitely tie in
[17:00] with what happened this weekend amen
[17:02] brother um ed can you mute me completely
[17:04] on the foldbacks please
[17:07] sorry thank you brother
[17:09] love the sound technicians
[17:13] okay verse 28 it says after this jesus
[17:16] knowing that all things were now
[17:18] accomplished
[17:20] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[17:22] saith i thirst
[17:24] so now remember
[17:26] he's hanging on the cross
[17:29] and and he's done everything for us and
[17:31] now he's hanging on the cross
[17:33] and his only command there is i'm
[17:35] thirsty i thirst
[17:38] so all that things that was preached
[17:39] this weekend
[17:40] comes down to this point where jesus
[17:42] says i thirst
[17:45] just give me a drink
[17:46] you know more people on death row have
[17:48] more rights than our lord jesus when he
[17:50] died
[17:51] i thirst
[17:55] and now
[17:56] they were set a vessel full of vinegar
[17:59] and they filled it with a sponge with
[18:00] vinegar not even give him a cup of water
[18:03] and they put it upon his up
[18:05] and they put it to his mouth
[18:07] and when jesus therefore had received
[18:09] the vinegar he said
[18:10] it is finished
[18:13] and he bowed his head and he gave up the
[18:15] ghost
[18:16] may the lord
[18:18] had his blessings to the word
[18:20] now it is a
[18:21] it is a hard scripture you all can have
[18:23] your seed because we're going to
[18:24] testimony and i don't want to preach
[18:26] because i've got something for after the
[18:27] service and i'll try my best to be
[18:30] fast because i know it's um wednesday
[18:33] but what happened this weekend was
[18:36] something that i haven't experienced in
[18:38] a long time
[18:40] okay because we had ministers local
[18:42] ministers
[18:44] all come down in a space of three weeks
[18:46] the whole thing was put together
[18:48] everybody showed up there was no
[18:50] no camp or no anything yet camp was
[18:53] there
[18:54] the believers that was there they just
[18:55] all got along
[18:57] the food was served we ate in the church
[18:59] then we cleaned up the church then we
[19:01] had church then we danced in the church
[19:02] and we cleaned up the church then we had
[19:04] church you know and then we ate some
[19:06] more and we fellowshipped them all we
[19:07] had church
[19:08] but see the one thing that i've realized
[19:10] is that's how heaven is
[19:12] because there i could be who i want to
[19:14] be
[19:15] there i could be who i am really am i
[19:18] don't have to fake pretend i don't have
[19:20] to keep my guard up i don't have to try
[19:22] to to always keep it in to say i love
[19:24] jesus you say that in your workplace
[19:26] people look at you funny but we still
[19:28] love him there's no everybody's got one
[19:31] goal
[19:31] we love the lord
[19:33] and i just want to quickly touch on a
[19:35] couple of things that was said
[19:36] and then i'll open it up for
[19:38] testimonials because that might help you
[19:39] because
[19:40] me being me
[19:42] i turn around i forget about it
[19:43] instantaneously so i'll just share a
[19:45] couple of things that stood out very
[19:47] first service
[19:49] very first service
[19:51] we had it at the title and it was holy
[19:53] spirit versus enticing spirits
[19:56] and in one thing that brother terest
[19:57] said that just anchored in my soul he
[19:59] says there's always going to be a fight
[20:00] between the two
[20:02] there's always going to be a fight
[20:03] between the two and there is a fire and
[20:05] i say i just called it the lake of fire
[20:07] because we're on the winning team
[20:09] and who's ever on the other team will be
[20:11] pulled the loser gets pulled into the
[20:13] fire
[20:14] amen
[20:15] so
[20:16] it was very clear that once you pick a
[20:18] side
[20:19] there is fire
[20:21] so either the fire is going to save you
[20:23] or the fire is going to consume you but
[20:25] you choose brother isaac what you want
[20:27] the fire to do for you amen and that
[20:30] dovetails so much with your sermon it
[20:32] was so beautiful see god has a mind so
[20:35] and that's that's the friday night when
[20:36] we showed up so for you wasn't there
[20:38] that i'm just giving you a bit of a
[20:40] you know we missed you all
[20:45] we missed you all you all were missed
[20:48] okay so it's not like you're excluded
[20:50] from this you can share a testimony it
[20:52] doesn't need to be about the weekend
[20:53] it's what what god puts on your heart
[20:56] so i'm just just throwing that out there
[20:58] and then we had
[20:59] brother andy come up with disappointment
[21:02] to divine appointment
[21:04] and i was jubilating look look i was
[21:07] just i i've learned a new word
[21:10] rapturnessness
[21:12] was it
[21:14] rapturousness that sounds like me
[21:18] thank you i appreciate it i like it when
[21:20] english-speaking people teach me english
[21:23] because i only speak in a self-defense
[21:25] but what i got out of your service is
[21:27] and he could have touched a lot about it
[21:28] but he said that there's the tomb
[21:32] and mary turns towards the tomb trying
[21:34] to find god in a place where he's not
[21:36] because he's alive and he's risen
[21:38] and then he paralleled it with believers
[21:40] today
[21:41] that's still looking for a god of
[21:42] history that's still trying to find him
[21:44] there in a denominational world that's
[21:46] still trying to find him in a grave
[21:48] that's sealed
[21:50] the graves no longer sealed it's open
[21:52] so we can't look to up to a pastor or a
[21:56] individual the word is open
[21:58] so if the word is open we should turn to
[22:01] them
[22:02] and then and in our hurts and everything
[22:04] that was in the past if you could leave
[22:06] it in that too
[22:07] and you keep walking with the lord what
[22:09] can happen
[22:11] so so brother andy god bless you thank
[22:13] you very much for me that's what i got
[22:14] out of it i don't want to look into my
[22:16] past and see a dead tomb yes it's part
[22:18] of my testimony but i want to look at
[22:20] the living god and i want to walk
[22:22] forward with him
[22:23] amen and so don't worry this is
[22:25] definitely not me preaching
[22:27] and uh
[22:30] getting fully into god fully into
[22:31] worship you know giving it all if you
[22:33] get here if you sing a special if you
[22:35] show up to church show up with
[22:37] everything don't don't leave nothing
[22:39] don't leave nothing because you'll be
[22:41] disappointed because you will not get
[22:43] anything because you reap what you
[22:46] okay and if you throw something upon the
[22:48] water shall it return to you
[22:50] well then what you're gonna put into the
[22:52] service is what you're gonna get out
[22:53] that's just how it is
[22:55] newton's third law say for every action
[22:57] is an opposite but equal reaction that
[22:59] means if i take a tennis ball and i
[23:01] whack it at that wall it's going to come
[23:03] back to me the equal force
[23:05] and that is just that's just the world
[23:07] grabbing a little bit of our bible which
[23:09] is written first and taking that and
[23:11] putting it in layman's terms but the
[23:13] real thing is you reap what you sow
[23:17] and if you sow evil you'll reap more
[23:19] because it's going to come back to you
[23:21] tenfold so that's just me and fellowship
[23:24] then
[23:25] then we had brother um cubin
[23:29] man what a life that guy lived
[23:32] so so he said something which was very
[23:34] very
[23:35] it kind of struck me here because i
[23:37] always said to these young men and
[23:38] marion as a witness i said to them if
[23:40] you can keep your testimony if you can
[23:42] keep the testimony if you can live clean
[23:45] if you can overcome through this message
[23:47] which gave you all the answers
[23:49] the word is open if you can just hold on
[23:52] to it and don't go try to find some cool
[23:54] testimony some scar some hurts if you
[23:57] can bypass that you have done far
[23:59] greater
[24:00] far greater than any of us that came out
[24:02] of the world you don't need a massive
[24:05] testimony you don't need to go standing
[24:07] and try to be a a ron spencer with the
[24:10] the cancer that he's fighting and all
[24:12] those things you don't try to have to be
[24:13] this massive believer that
[24:15] if you believe in god you'll have your
[24:17] battles
[24:18] but it doesn't need to be in the world
[24:21] and when he said that he says
[24:23] don't brothers sisters whatever you do
[24:25] do not chase
[24:27] after a big testimony
[24:29] because they're going to find it in the
[24:31] world and think that god will save them
[24:32] and then they'll have this massive
[24:33] testimony and there'll be something in
[24:35] the church it's a lie
[24:37] so if you can keep clean and live holy
[24:39] that is a far greater testimony
[24:42] and that's what i got from him and he
[24:43] said you should pray
[24:45] pray and pray for your children
[24:48] amen and then
[24:50] we had brother um
[24:51] afridi that went up
[24:53] and and he made it very clear that he's
[24:55] 87 years old
[24:57] and he was preaching like a 18 year old
[25:00] you know so and the one thing i got from
[25:03] him
[25:04] man
[25:05] if i'm his age one day hey
[25:07] and i'm jumping around and preaching
[25:09] with all that that everything in me and
[25:11] being resolved and not being scared of
[25:13] evil
[25:15] he wasn't scared to go toe-to-toe with
[25:17] satan and that's the thing is now if you
[25:19] really look at at natural terms if 87
[25:21] year old man comes to you and he rolls
[25:23] up he sleeps and he says i'm going to
[25:25] punch you okay seriously as a young man
[25:28] you'll go
[25:30] what i'm telling you
[25:31] if i was satan and brother freddie comes
[25:33] to me and says i'm going to punch you i
[25:35] would go oh dear
[25:37] okay i would run
[25:38] because that man has a testimony he has
[25:40] a life he has a burden and he said if
[25:42] i'm going to serve god and if i die here
[25:44] and this and he said oh to allah
[25:46] brothers he says if i die in a service
[25:49] you ain't burying me you are praying and
[25:51] i'm coming back to life
[25:53] and he didn't say it as he was downing
[25:55] it he said it because it's going to
[25:56] happen that way and he will pray and
[25:58] people he will stand up there because he
[26:00] believes in the resurrection
[26:02] amen
[26:03] and that's why i said this message lives
[26:06] and then he said
[26:07] one thing he really said except from
[26:09] devils that will scatter
[26:12] because that's the ba that's the being
[26:13] you are
[26:15] you've got the holy ghost in you and
[26:16] there wasn't one fight when jesus was
[26:18] upon this earth that he lost
[26:20] and now he's not on earth but he's in us
[26:22] because with in his corporal body and
[26:25] he's still beating every devil it's the
[26:27] same god okay
[26:29] and he said one thing that stood out is
[26:30] his parents
[26:32] pray for your children
[26:35] parents
[26:36] pray for your children and we had a
[26:39] wonderful testimony and i pray you see
[26:41] that sister shannon
[26:43] i pray you just hear it tonight if it's
[26:45] on your eyes i maybe just call you up by
[26:47] the way and just say to share it because
[26:49] because the power of prayer goes beyond
[26:52] what we could comprehend
[26:56] and then we had our pastor stand up
[26:59] brother being a what
[27:02] what a service
[27:03] look that wasn't
[27:05] i won't lie not because it's our pastor
[27:08] and nothing
[27:09] that was the lord speaking to all of us
[27:12] saying get back to true worship
[27:14] don't mock
[27:16] this is not a game
[27:18] they mocked and they scorched and they
[27:20] did all those things and where that they
[27:21] end up do not ask do the same because we
[27:24] have all the answers and people
[27:25] sometimes take those answers of the
[27:27] message and all the quotes of brother
[27:28] branham and all the things that are read
[27:30] in bible and they start flicking it out
[27:33] that's not that's not worship
[27:35] worship is if you take that word and you
[27:37] give it back to him you say lord let it
[27:38] grow in my life
[27:40] i i i was changed after that i can
[27:42] promise you that thank you brother ben
[27:44] god bless you it was one thing he did
[27:46] say
[27:47] he said simon
[27:49] he said simon
[27:52] simon got dressed
[27:54] he ate his breakfast
[27:56] he went and there was a commotion and he
[27:58] got there
[27:59] and then they called him and said you
[28:01] simon take that cross
[28:04] it wasn't who he was
[28:06] it wasn't how long he's been in the
[28:08] message it wasn't how many hail marys he
[28:11] said or how many praises said it was
[28:13] simon
[28:14] you carry their cross
[28:16] there was no nothing of his history
[28:18] there except for where he came from
[28:21] and after that simon's life changed
[28:24] because when he picked up the cross and
[28:27] the blood of jesus christ was dripping
[28:28] on him
[28:30] that changed
[28:33] because then for the first time the
[28:34] cross really meant something to me to
[28:37] say but why do they always say pick up
[28:39] your cross and follow jesus
[28:41] they don't say pick up the nice fancy
[28:42] cross without the blood stains and all
[28:44] those things that's there on the wall
[28:45] like the betrayment they say pick up
[28:47] that cross
[28:49] the one that's full of blood
[28:51] the one that our master
[28:53] carried
[28:54] pick up that cross
[28:56] and take that with you and carry it all
[28:58] the way there
[29:00] and we forget sometimes that the cross
[29:02] when people preach the cross we forget
[29:04] we think it's a wooden stick
[29:06] it is where our master has bled and died
[29:09] on
[29:09] so when they say do that it means wake
[29:12] up
[29:13] wake up it's not it's not what the world
[29:15] makes it to be it is your cross become
[29:18] one with your sacrifice and keep going
[29:20] forward he didn't say take it back and
[29:22] let's see if jesus can do it again they
[29:23] say pick it up and walk and he did that
[29:26] and he was blessed for it because how
[29:28] many years later did that little girl
[29:30] come and brother branham prayed for her
[29:32] and said because simon the lord hasn't
[29:34] forgot about it and she received a sight
[29:36] back it's moments like that that changes
[29:39] your life forever
[29:40] so god bless you so that was what i got
[29:42] out of the weekend
[29:44] i do believe when i went there i thought
[29:46] it was going to be
[29:48] it was going to be totally different and
[29:50] thank the lord it was
[29:52] because yeah i'm not i'm not the same
[29:55] i'm definitely not the same praise the
[29:57] lord so if there's anybody that has a
[29:59] testimony in the mics open what we'll do
[30:00] is we'll do one or two testimonies we'll
[30:02] sing a cup a song again then we'll do a
[30:04] testimony of this more we'll do a song
[30:06] and then we'll actually just close the
[30:08] evening and i'll maybe just deliver a
[30:10] bit of mail that the lord gave me and
[30:11] then
[30:12] then we go into prayer and we go home so
[30:14] i don't want to stretch out the night
[30:15] too long i'm looking at the time so
[30:18] anybody with a testimony it's just a
[30:19] shannon
[30:21] [Laughter]
[30:22] did i did i did that right
[30:24] sister
[30:26] yes please it is very important because
[30:28] these young children on that screen
[30:29] they're looking
[30:31] and they would love to hear that and
[30:32] these mom and dads
[30:34] that need to hear that too
[30:38] i already gave it last time
[30:41] oh um
[30:43] bear with me
[30:45] if it's not the mic it's going to be my
[30:46] eyes
[30:47] um
[30:49] but
[30:50] okay where do i start so the testimony i
[30:53] gave it was the one of the best camps
[30:55] i've ever been to or best meetings i've
[30:57] ever been to
[30:58] and the reason why was because i'm
[31:07] thank you
[31:09] because god is god of miracles
[31:11] and there's nothing too hard for him
[31:14] and i have a son my eldest son
[31:17] who met god himself
[31:19] and wanted to be at the camp for the
[31:21] first time
[31:23] um
[31:24] so the previous camps and he's actually
[31:28] lighting up my whole house on fire with
[31:30] god
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:37] i think satan knew that he would um
[31:40] be the way he is
[31:42] so he tried all he could but god is um
[31:47] and he's powerful he knows he knows the
[31:49] right timing god's got the right timing
[31:52] amen so
[31:54] my testimony was um
[31:56] it was about four or five years ago when
[31:59] things started when when you're a mom
[32:01] that's all you want is your family
[32:03] to see your children serving the lord
[32:05] because
[32:06] the lord became very precious to me when
[32:08] i was 21 years old i met him
[32:11] and he saved me and
[32:13] oh man when brother freddie gave that um
[32:16] his thing
[32:17] you could just see the lord he's risen
[32:20] he's real and when you've met him you
[32:22] know he's real he walks and talks with
[32:24] you anyway so you want that for your
[32:26] children
[32:27] and that's all i i lived for you know
[32:30] is to have the lord in me um and then
[32:33] you know of course you want him to you
[32:35] want to see him and others and
[32:37] definitely your family and so
[32:40] when i when i started seeing things
[32:41] going um
[32:43] the other way i freaked out poor dave
[32:46] he's my first child too so um i yeah
[32:50] i freaked out um and um
[32:53] i probably got more stricter as well
[32:55] thinking that i would because i would i
[32:57] would wrap him in cotton wool if i could
[32:59] and not let him go down
[33:02] the places i went down
[33:04] so um but the lord had other plans um
[33:08] and then so um so when i saw him doing
[33:10] that um i started stressing out quite a
[33:12] bit and you know you in
[33:15] of course you take it to the lord and
[33:16] but i
[33:18] um
[33:19] uh yeah i started going gray
[33:22] and i started losing my hair which
[33:24] apparently my mom is hereditary when she
[33:26] stresses she lose her loses her hair so
[33:28] i came up for prayer and brother ferdi
[33:31] prayed for me and it was so profound
[33:33] because when you come up here and you
[33:34] get prayed for that's no longer the
[33:35] preacher that's god himself and um so he
[33:39] prayed for me and i knew it wasn't him
[33:41] it was god speaking and he said lord
[33:43] please forgive her.
[33:45] and i thought man that's profound isn't
[33:46] it please forgive her and i knew why he
[33:48] said it because i was doubting the word
[33:51] and i was worrying and i was taking it
[33:53] upon myself so i i took that away
[33:56] and it was over years and it was getting
[33:59] um you know
[34:01] yeah wasn't the funnest
[34:03] and um
[34:05] and then um there were a few songs that
[34:09] came through my path uh along the way
[34:12] and one of them was
[34:14] um
[34:15] uh sister latabo sung it actually when
[34:18] when it was really dark and some dark
[34:19] places
[34:20] um
[34:21] sister latabo sung the song this is how
[34:23] i fight my battles because
[34:25] um that you got to a place where you're
[34:27] just so burdened you don't even feel
[34:29] like you know uh being around people or
[34:32] worshiping or anything like that and
[34:34] then satan tries to take your joy and he
[34:36] tries to take your
[34:37] worship away from god who who he hasn't
[34:40] changed um
[34:42] and then latabo sang this is how i fight
[34:44] my battles
[34:47] talk about a burden that left lifted and
[34:50] then um when something happens in your
[34:52] home when when there's strife in your
[34:54] home it not only is with the children it
[34:56] can come
[34:57] you know it can satan wants to just take
[34:59] over your whole family so it could come
[35:02] and and try to he wants to destroy um
[35:05] the family and marriages and things like
[35:06] that and there was there was another
[35:08] part another song that um isaac's saying
[35:11] and it was um
[35:12] not today satan
[35:14] and i knew that was for me because i was
[35:16] um believing lies
[35:18] and um
[35:20] and it really and sister bronwyn had a
[35:22] vision as well about the butterfly in
[35:24] the um
[35:26] whales belly if you remember that and i
[35:28] know it's for a few people i know it
[35:29] touched my touch me as well because i
[35:32] realized i was looking at lying vanities
[35:35] um instead of god's word
[35:37] god's word is true and it is real and it
[35:39] says
[35:40] um in the book of acts
[35:42] for the promises unto you and your
[35:44] children and to all that are far off and
[35:46] he says our children will possess the
[35:48] gates of the enemy it's not a hope so
[35:51] it's they will it's done
[35:53] it's done it was done before the
[35:54] foundation the world it's not a hope so
[35:57] it's gonna happen
[35:58] and um and then on the camp um last camp
[36:02] uh dave i don't know you were kind of in
[36:04] that spot where you were kind of
[36:07] still in the world kind of one foot in
[36:09] the world one kind of
[36:11] wanting to go to the lord and uh one two
[36:14] rules are in our house one is no drugs
[36:17] or alcohol in our house and you go to
[36:19] church and so um because he wasn't
[36:21] planning on going to the meeting
[36:23] we were gonna lock the
[36:24] house and
[36:26] and he would have to camp on the lawn
[36:29] unless he came and praise the lord he
[36:31] came and um
[36:33] and it was a real blessing and we sang
[36:35] that song
[36:38] oh man that's why i stood up i had to
[36:40] stand up each time it was sung um the
[36:43] goodness of god
[36:44] and it oh because we were singing that
[36:46] at that last camp and we were praising
[36:49] and i was praising the lord
[36:51] like it hadn't happened quite yet but it
[36:54] was it was it was it was there it was
[36:56] coming and so this camp this camp
[37:00] um this camp
[37:02] uh
[37:02] his word was made manifest so that
[37:05] everyone can see it because it was made
[37:06] manifest before foundation of the world
[37:09] but now
[37:10] my son met the living god and it's not
[37:13] just my god it's his god
[37:15] and he's risen
[37:18] so we have a
[37:19] son who has lost his amnesia we have a
[37:22] son who's come back to christ um and i
[37:26] love how isaac put it he said um
[37:29] because i was the one that was doubting
[37:31] and isaac said to me he said no
[37:33] david's a dove he's got a homing device
[37:35] and that's all our children they've got
[37:37] a homing device in them so when they go
[37:40] out
[37:41] they know where home is in christ
[37:43] and he's gonna they're all gonna come
[37:45] back

[47:24] [Applause]
[47:26] anybody else
[47:27] sister lundy
[47:29] see i like it when it happens hey we
[47:31] can't stop testifying because that's
[47:32] what we do because it's not about us
[47:34] it's giving him the glory hey
[47:36] testify sister you tell him
[47:41] this is it's not about the weekend but
[47:43] it's been
[47:44] it's been coming a long way and um
[47:47] so since well last year with this whole
[47:51] covert thing that started and everything
[47:54] there was such a fear in me
[47:57] about the whole thing
[47:59] and
[48:00] as a christian you know you're not
[48:02] supposed to fear and you know you're not
[48:03] supposed to
[48:05] dwell on those things and all of that
[48:07] but it got to a point where i actually
[48:09] physically got sick
[48:12] the fear just was so
[48:14] big
[48:15] and and
[48:17] that
[48:18] i i started having all these symptoms
[48:21] and it felt like i couldn't breathe and
[48:23] i
[48:24] it was just
[48:25] so real and i was trying to explain it
[48:28] to everyone and
[48:29] he said that
[48:31] he can't he wants to
[48:33] climb into my burden but he can't
[48:35] because he he just doesn't have any fear
[48:37] around the whole covert thing
[48:39] and um
[48:41] it kept
[48:43] every time that i started feeling like
[48:46] that i
[48:47] started singing or i started
[48:49] reading the word or i put a sermon on or
[48:52] or just because it
[48:55] i made the mistake of
[48:57] reading too much and
[49:00] about what is going on in the world and
[49:01] wild all everything and it it got
[49:04] got to a point where it got too much and
[49:06] i led the devil
[49:08] too much freedom in my life around that
[49:11] and um
[49:14] so the one i i was sick and i just
[49:18] decided that i'm not gonna and i i
[49:20] started realizing but this is not a
[49:22] physical fight that i'm fighting this is
[49:25] a spiritual fight that i'm fighting
[49:27] and um every time that i felt like that
[49:31] i
[49:31] started reading or i started praising
[49:33] the lord or and that
[49:35] it completely
[49:38] it completely went away
[49:40] but then after
[49:43] when this whole thing started over again
[49:45] it came back and i thought but
[49:48] lord why i thought i had this i've
[49:51] overcome this the fear is gone
[49:53] everything is is gone
[49:55] and
[49:56] i started just doing the same thing and
[49:58] and starting going back
[50:00] back to the word and every time the fear
[50:02] is is upon me and i even went to
[50:05] to got to a point where i put a timer on
[50:08] my i completely blocked all the news and
[50:11] everything on my phone so that i
[50:12] couldn't access any of it
[50:14] to help me to just completely put that
[50:17] away so that i can
[50:19] i can be in the word and go to the word
[50:22] instead of going to to to the world side
[50:24] of it and
[50:26] the more i started testifying the more
[50:29] satan tried to just bring bring that
[50:31] fear back and bring that fear back
[50:34] and
[50:35] i was testifying to um to naomi the one
[50:38] day as well and i said to her but
[50:40] i know the lord has taken this away but
[50:43] i know satan is trying to to to bring it
[50:46] back to me and um
[50:49] every time the lord just gave me
[50:55] that
[50:56] every time that came back and i thought
[50:58] lord but what do i need to learn out of
[51:00] this what is the what is the lesson that
[51:02] i need to learn why do you keep bringing
[51:04] this back to me
[51:06] and um the more i started this every
[51:09] time i started testifying on you okay
[51:12] satan just came back and then
[51:14] then the the battle got real because
[51:16] then jono tested positive
[51:19] and then all of a sudden i realized okay
[51:21] but now i've been testifying and saying
[51:23] all of this is gone and the lord has
[51:25] taken her away
[51:26] but now is the real testing time do i
[51:29] still fear this thing and do this thing
[51:31] i still have a hold on me or not
[51:34] and
[51:35] then i realized but
[51:37] that's why the lord said
[51:39] sargent
[51:40] i had to physically
[51:42] get into the fire be in the fire to see
[51:45] the fourth man
[51:46] to see but the lord is there and he's
[51:49] taken that away and
[51:52] i don't realize
[51:54] how big
[51:56] fear can be and how it can absolutely
[51:59] you
[52:00] with everything you're doing it is and
[52:04] and
[52:05] as a believer because you know you
[52:06] shouldn't but
[52:08] satan only needs
[52:10] one small thing and he can run with it
[52:13] if you let it run if you give him that
[52:15] space to run

[59:05] and just overcome everything and have no
[59:07] struggles and just walk and it's kumbaya
[59:10] and everything is fine it's not how it
[59:12] is it's a war it's a battle it is every
[59:15] day when you wake up like brother
[59:17] freddie said he said every day he made
[59:19] it to that that that that study of his
[59:22] he said i won
[59:24] that is christianity
[59:26] ain't given to you on a silver plate
[59:29] definitely not life everlasting is given
[59:31] to you but you're going to fight all the
[59:33] way there
[59:34] amen
[59:36] testimony
[59:38] brother ben our sister know me you're
[59:40] after brother ben

[59:49] while there from
[59:51] but um yeah he got off so i just want to
[59:53] give the lord thanks that he's a free
[59:55] man today and i know he's real happy um
[59:59] the lord's working great miracles really
[1:00:00] in connor's life and miller they don't
[1:00:03] see it
[1:00:05] all the time but they're definitely
[1:00:06] asking heaps of questions he rang me
[1:00:09] tonight we've gone there for a few me
[1:00:11] and maybe there for a few nights for
[1:00:12] dinner
[1:00:13] here and again and i've just stopped
[1:00:14] them and prayed for the food and he rang
[1:00:16] me tonight to say that they tonight they
[1:00:17] just stopped and prayed for the food
[1:00:20] so yeah i thank you for your prayers for
[1:00:22] them because yeah they're top lads and
[1:00:24] they need jesus
[1:00:26] most most people need jesus
[1:00:28] yeah i sort of touched based on devo
[1:00:31] man it was a massive battle when i came
[1:00:33] into bellingham it was quite close to me
[1:00:34] um and then it was like
[1:00:36] he just got ripped away like satan just
[1:00:37] took him it was like and he wasn't the
[1:00:39] same person
[1:00:41] and you know
[1:00:42] being a christian's it's real hard like
[1:00:44] it's real easy in this room but it's
[1:00:45] real hard
[1:00:46] and the hardest part was um he came down
[1:00:48] one day and the devil was just working
[1:00:50] and he decided he wanted to punch me and
[1:00:52] i had a broken leg and
[1:00:53] everything in me just wanted to fight
[1:00:54] back and i i couldn't walk after my
[1:00:56] brace on and i just i battled for so
[1:00:58] long to forgive him
[1:01:00] and then
[1:01:01] the lord just shows you things and it's
[1:01:03] it's only over the devil you're like no
[1:01:04] it wasn't it was the person it's never
[1:01:06] the person the person who wants to hurt
[1:01:08] you is the demonic spirit on the person
[1:01:11] and we are in a battle so don't just
[1:01:13] keep loving people because
[1:01:15] that devil hates love and he hates you
[1:01:17] to overcome
[1:01:25] call you come sister know me
[1:01:28] i wouldn't date punch david
[1:01:30] i'm just keep
[1:01:32] now i'm just joking
[1:01:34] um
[1:01:35] just when lundy came up here at um she
[1:01:38] was talking about
[1:01:40] you didn't name the devil but his name
[1:01:41] is anxiety and um it just um after you
[1:01:45] said that i was
[1:01:47] um when we were singing i was counting
[1:01:48] in my head and when i was 24 which
[1:01:52] um
[1:01:53] i just calculated
[1:01:55] what is seven years ago um
[1:01:59] i was fighting the same devil and
[1:02:02] i didn't know what was going on but then
[1:02:04] i had an anxiety attack and all this
[1:02:06] random like having all these symptoms
[1:02:09] and
[1:02:10] um yeah so i talked to a few friends and
[1:02:12] they're like just feed on the word so
[1:02:13] that's what i did and that's how i
[1:02:14] overcame and
[1:02:16] um
[1:02:18] got some
[1:02:19] got my cousin who was
[1:02:20] who had just had a real experience with
[1:02:23] the lord to pray for me and different
[1:02:24] things like that and that's how i
[1:02:26] overcame and i was just calculating in
[1:02:28] my head um when we were singing
[1:02:30] how how many years ago was that and i
[1:02:32] was like it was seven and then i was
[1:02:34] like oh what month did that start
[1:02:36] because i remember the exact day when
[1:02:39] those symptoms started happening and
[1:02:42] i just realized it's almost
[1:02:45] like in about a week it would be exactly
[1:02:48] seven years and i was thinking that's so
[1:02:50] cool
[1:02:51] perfection
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:55] our god is so cool
[1:02:57] amen
[1:03:00] he is mighty he is almighty
[1:03:02] any other one more taste oh here we go
[1:03:05] oh i've got two brothers now fighting
[1:03:06] for the mind
[1:03:07] you go you it's the opportunity you
[1:03:09] taste the fat brother
[1:03:11] good evening saints
[1:03:13] thank you for all the testimonies that
[1:03:14] it's been shared this evening
[1:03:17] mind is not a testimony as such but it
[1:03:20] is a testimony i'll testify to god right
[1:03:23] um
[1:03:24] firstly
[1:03:25] the devil tried to hold me back
[1:03:27] i was down at covert
[1:03:30] didn't know where they were going to
[1:03:31] make the meetings
[1:03:32] i made a booking
[1:03:34] for four nights with my family to go to
[1:03:36] palmerston and to enjoy the services
[1:03:39] i was talking to brother tears i was
[1:03:40] excited
[1:03:42] for what the lord is going to do in
[1:03:43] manawatu for what the lord is going to
[1:03:45] do
[1:03:46] amongst the fielding
[1:03:48] fellowship
[1:03:50] they never had anything like this before
[1:03:52] so it was us as brothers and sisters to
[1:03:55] go and support them
[1:03:56] and i'm thankful for my pastor
[1:03:59] he never stops any one of us if we say
[1:04:01] we're going whether it's fielding
[1:04:03] whether it's taranaki whether it's
[1:04:05] auckland whether it's south island he
[1:04:08] allows us to go
[1:04:09] because
[1:04:10] we want to break this devil's walls down
[1:04:13] we want to we want to annihilate the
[1:04:15] devil and let him know we're going to
[1:04:17] trample all over him to get there
[1:04:20] so
[1:04:21] he tricked me by giving me covert
[1:04:24] and he kept me at home and i couldn't
[1:04:27] come for the sunday service here brother
[1:04:29] isaac preached
[1:04:31] and if you know my wife sister shannon
[1:04:33] i can't share the screen with her
[1:04:37] you you need to own this
[1:04:39] so i thought i was just going to listen
[1:04:41] in to the word you know and and
[1:04:43] and when you when you
[1:04:45] streaming in when you're youtubing and i
[1:04:47] shared that with pastor today
[1:04:48] you're not
[1:04:50] dedicated you're not
[1:04:53] yes the children are running by or the
[1:04:54] dog went past and somebody walked past
[1:04:57] the front and and you your eyes get
[1:04:59] taken away straight away but when we're
[1:05:01] in the church when we are together
[1:05:02] whether it's it doesn't have to be a
[1:05:04] church as such it has to be a place of
[1:05:06] worship that we can all come and gather
[1:05:08] and we we look forward we look up we
[1:05:10] look we look for the for our lord
[1:05:12] so you're you
[1:05:14] you're in one accord you're ready for
[1:05:16] this you're ready to give it all you got
[1:05:18] as you said when you come to church you
[1:05:20] want to give it everything you want to
[1:05:21] come here ready right and you want to
[1:05:23] receive everything that's coming for you
[1:05:25] you're not worried about your neighbor
[1:05:27] your wife your children for me
[1:05:30] and for you
[1:05:31] so i was ready to go to manoa too and
[1:05:33] this all come about and then i get a

[1:06:12] lo and behold to me
[1:06:13] my brothers are there before me
[1:06:15] you know how wonderful it was to know
[1:06:17] that my brothers were standing
[1:06:20] in the gap before me
[1:06:22] normally on a sunday we are early we
[1:06:24] come to church we do all those kind of
[1:06:25] things but to see my brother's faces

[1:06:37] brothers stood in my gap to do that
[1:06:40] whatever was necessary my pastor was
[1:06:42] there
[1:06:43] it is so important that we all go
[1:06:46] and we do these things
[1:06:48] manual too was similar to wellington
[1:06:52] very dry for a long time
[1:06:55] but i can tell you after this weekend
[1:06:58] after this weekend
[1:07:01] the ground is broken the ground has been
[1:07:03] tilled
[1:07:04] the four-man letter rain has dropped
[1:07:08] praise and worship after the service
[1:07:11] because of the victory we were dancing
[1:07:14] we were singing brother onions all
[1:07:16] respect to you brother isaac respect to
[1:07:19] you because when you give the right
[1:07:20] people the mic after the word has been
[1:07:23] preached
[1:07:24] the anointing is false
[1:07:27] you don't have to be
[1:07:29] a singer you don't have to be a
[1:07:32] songwriter you don't have to be a
[1:07:33] preacher
[1:07:35] when the glory of the lord falls you
[1:07:37] just have to bathe in his spirit
[1:07:40] sister well done
[1:07:42] sister shannon
[1:07:44] well done people that got into the tune
[1:07:48] into the one accord of the god's word
[1:07:51] when it was preached and after the songs
[1:07:53] came
[1:07:54] that's all what was needed for manoa too
[1:07:57] that place has been shaken that place
[1:07:59] has been stirred the ground has been
[1:08:01] tilled
[1:08:02] the rain has fallen all those dry seeds
[1:08:04] those rotten seeds are now gonna bud
[1:08:08] all those people that have been in manoa
[1:08:10] too that heard this word before and have
[1:08:13] fallen away
[1:08:14] that life is going to come through now
[1:08:16] it's all because of all your support
[1:08:19] for your praying for the for the people
[1:08:21] coming together it was the most
[1:08:23] important thing and brother freddie said
[1:08:25] something that was very important that
[1:08:26] stood out for me
[1:08:28] he said and he took it upon himself as a
[1:08:30] pastor
[1:08:32] it's us pastors
[1:08:34] holding the people back
[1:08:36] to join each other
[1:08:39] and it's important because we our pastor
[1:08:42] that's why i said i respect my pastor
[1:08:44] because he doesn't stop anyone to go
[1:08:45] brother and paul he wasn't with us but
[1:08:47] he was with us
[1:08:48] you was in taranaki but he was doing the
[1:08:50] same thing in taranaki that we were
[1:08:52] doing in fielding because of our past
[1:08:54] days allowing us to go share the word
[1:08:56] share our love support the people
[1:08:58] support the brothers that's what it is
[1:09:00] i missed you sister naomi on sunday i
[1:09:02] wasn't there but i believe you were
[1:09:04] there on saturday i was trying to
[1:09:06] get to see different things that was

[1:09:56] um
[1:09:58] i i was expecting much more
[1:10:00] testimonies and
[1:10:02] i'm still expecting more
[1:10:05] statista to come
[1:10:06] [Laughter]
[1:10:08] did i see properly sister on the group
[1:10:10] so i thought i would be like ahmad is
[1:10:12] here
[1:10:14] okay i
[1:10:16] my my one is
[1:10:18] is based on amos chapter three i think
[1:10:22] it's verse seven
[1:10:25] i think
[1:10:27] amos three verse seven who knows that
[1:10:29] scripture
[1:10:31] and
[1:10:32] daniel
[1:10:33] thank you denny it says
[1:10:36] amos chapter 3
[1:10:41] verse 6 shall a trumpet be blown in the
[1:10:44] city
[1:10:45] and the people not be afraid
[1:10:49] shall the evil
[1:10:51] in a city
[1:10:54] and the lord have not done it
[1:10:59] verse 8
[1:11:01] you all know verse 7
[1:11:03] the lion hath road
[1:11:05] who shall not fear
[1:11:07] the lord has spoken
[1:11:09] who cannot but prophesy
[1:11:12] so i'm so glad to hear all these
[1:11:14] wonderful wonderful testimonies and i
[1:11:16] could feel
[1:11:18] when i was in taranaki that there is
[1:11:20] fire burning manawatu site
[1:11:23] and i was following some of the services
[1:11:26] we also had a wonderful time
[1:11:28] and what i want to tell you is that
[1:11:31] if the lord speaks who can keep quiet
[1:11:35] if you find if the lord speaks and you
[1:11:37] keep quiet
[1:11:38] or nothing happens
[1:11:41] that you're going against that scripture
[1:11:44] if i lie on the rose here now by the
[1:11:46] door
[1:11:47] there's going to be an action
[1:11:50] and he's the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:11:52] isn't he
[1:11:53] so glad to see you brother steve
[1:11:55] i went and took a seat there
[1:11:57] in taranaki
[1:11:59] so
[1:12:00] what i want also to say was that you
[1:12:02] know brother and sister when you
[1:12:05] you you you always get what you expect
[1:12:10] and
[1:12:10] if you expect the lord to be with you in
[1:12:12] the car
[1:12:14] he's going to be with you in the car
[1:12:16] and you know how he he comes when you
[1:12:18] think and you talk to him he comes
[1:12:21] you can't i can't expect the lord to
[1:12:23] come when i'm not thinking about him i'm
[1:12:26] not talking about him i'm talking about
[1:12:28] other things and then how can he come
[1:12:31] so he came also on on thursday night on
[1:12:33] our way to taranaki
[1:12:36] as we were talking talking all of a
[1:12:37] sudden the spirit of the lord just
[1:12:39] broken everybody was just crying and
[1:12:41] praying
[1:12:42] and loud as we could and i i can't
[1:12:45] explain what happens it's because you
[1:12:48] know one day brother then said you know
[1:12:50] atmosphere is everything
[1:12:53] atmosphere is everything
[1:12:55] so
[1:12:56] so we went to taranaki they are greeting
[1:12:58] you we had a wonderful time with the
[1:13:00] milan family we were with brother marion
[1:13:03] we had a wonderful evening together

[1:15:49] amen
[1:15:53] good evening
[1:15:58] this is my testimony
[1:16:02] i now have a reason to live to glorify
[1:16:05] he who is seated in the heavenly
[1:16:08] places the most high
[1:16:11] i had transformed mentally and
[1:16:13] spiritually my last few years was
[1:16:15] endlessly searching for this faith
[1:16:19] polluted by the world
[1:16:22] i was a mere mortal in this temporary
[1:16:25] world
[1:16:26] that incites love
[1:16:28] but to my dismay more hate
[1:16:32] through that
[1:16:33] i carried my pain
[1:16:35] and transgressions and despair
[1:16:40] my walk is now a continuum of living a
[1:16:43] holy life for jesus christ
[1:16:48] i recently felt in my heart to be
[1:16:50] baptized for the second time
[1:16:54] merely at first
[1:16:56] i was hearing but not a doer
[1:17:00] nor fully comprehending
[1:17:02] the life of our lord and his will for me
[1:17:09] so on a sunny afternoon
[1:17:11] i was welcomed by his presence
[1:17:15] crying out in tears of joy
[1:17:18] the knowledge of who he said he was
[1:17:22] to me
[1:17:26] we get closer to god when we pray like
[1:17:28] we never have before and come to him
[1:17:31] with all our sorrows angst and truly
[1:17:34] believe
[1:17:36] strengthening faith with fellowship
[1:17:39] and church
[1:17:40] through our lord
[1:17:42] this priceless gift
[1:17:45] offered to all
[1:17:47] not only speaking with words
[1:17:49] but dispersing of the flesh
[1:17:52] just that tent of ours
[1:17:55] just a free fall into my savior jesus
[1:18:00] christ
[1:18:04] without a shadow of doubt in all his
[1:18:06] amazing glory what was revealed of the
[1:18:08] holy spirit was this pure knowing i was
[1:18:11] being embraced and assured
[1:18:14] like a long lost father that you belong
[1:18:17] to him eternally
[1:18:23] i recall at the time i was shaken but i
[1:18:25] understood what real love was
[1:18:28] i had been in complete awe
[1:18:30] tears of piety
[1:18:32] and joy
[1:18:34] and a total rebirth
[1:18:38] he was in my presence and i now
[1:18:40] understood i had felt unwavering
[1:18:43] goodness
[1:18:44] spiritually
[1:18:46] i had been shaken by the merciful act of
[1:18:48] this great
[1:18:50] the great i am
[1:18:52] who will lead me
[1:18:53] in light and by surrendering all
[1:18:57] with faith
[1:19:00] walk righteously
[1:19:02] so i may please my father in heaven
[1:19:07] so now
[1:19:08] i surrender joyfully by hiding myself in
[1:19:11] jesus christ
[1:19:14] foregoing all fears
[1:19:16] shortcomings desires and doubts
[1:19:19] i lay it all at his feet
[1:19:23] so this is
[1:19:25] my verse
[1:19:26] speak lord for thy thir servant heareth
[1:19:31] and knowing that my god
[1:19:33] yeshua that he lives in me
[1:19:37] and this is unspeakable joy for me
[1:19:41] thank you
[1:19:50] god bless you
[1:19:52] amen
[1:19:54] we call just stand we quickly read the
[1:19:56] word
[1:19:57] sister teaser when you meet the lord and
[1:20:00] all our believers would know when you
[1:20:01] have a personal experience with the lord
[1:20:04] it changes you
[1:20:06] and i used to listen to metallica and
[1:20:08] all those type of things and
[1:20:10] and all this worldly music
[1:20:14] and actually what happened is oh we got
[1:20:15] another testimony here we go amen
[1:20:19] oh we got mo oh bring it on amen
[1:20:23] hold on just want to put you on you
[1:20:26] you can have your seats i apologize i
[1:20:28] was waiting for everyone from
[1:20:31] the services to have that chance before
[1:20:33] i come so i realized that i'm being
[1:20:35] closed out
[1:20:41] over a few
[1:20:44] months i'm saying starting from last
[1:20:46] year
[1:20:47] i've been hearing preachers they would
[1:20:48] be preaching and then they'll talk about
[1:20:50] youtube
[1:20:52] paramount was just saying that when
[1:20:53] you're a christian
[1:20:56] it's not just all blissful
[1:20:59] you have your battles to overcome we all
[1:21:01] have to be overcomers
[1:21:03] so you go through a battle you think
[1:21:05] you're alone but the more it keeps on
[1:21:07] being said on the pulpit you realize
[1:21:09] that
[1:21:10] you're not alone
[1:21:12] and i was going to sit down and not say
[1:21:14] anything but i thought you know what
[1:21:17] if i was not the only one let me just
[1:21:20] share my testimony perhaps it can help
[1:21:22] someone
[1:21:24] i would say there they would preach i
[1:21:28] would make my pledge with god and said
[1:21:30] i will not watch tv
[1:21:32] i'll call it tv
[1:21:34] and i will try to stay away from reading
[1:21:37] too much books because i'm a reader
[1:21:40] and you find that you even know that
[1:21:43] okay
[1:21:44] if i'm looking at a title here for me to
[1:21:47] know whether it's clean or not i have to
[1:21:49] go to dove and check
[1:21:51] is it clean if it's okay for kids to
[1:21:53] even watch i'm going to watch it
[1:21:56] but it takes your time
[1:21:58] from the weed yes it's a very clean
[1:22:01] thing that you're doing
[1:22:03] you can sit there your kids can sit
[1:22:05] there and watch what you're doing not a
[1:22:06] problem but it takes your time
[1:22:09] from the word and when the devil tries
[1:22:11] to make distraction he tries to make
[1:22:14] total distractions so that what you're
[1:22:17] doing is going to stop you from growing
[1:22:19] spiritually
[1:22:21] and it's going to stop you from growing
[1:22:23] with your career
[1:22:25] and i would be sitting there asking
[1:22:27] myself
[1:22:29] where exactly is this leading you
[1:22:31] because
[1:22:32] at least if you were studying
[1:22:35] and then you're going to tell me that
[1:22:37] what you're doing is going to help you
[1:22:39] progress with your career at least that
[1:22:41] would be something
[1:22:42] if you were reading spoken with and
[1:22:44] listening to the word
[1:22:46] and you're saying
[1:22:47] when you live there you can share the
[1:22:49] word with someone
[1:22:51] that would be beneficial to your spirit
[1:22:54] but if whatever you're doing is not
[1:22:56] benefiting those two it's just
[1:22:58] for entertainment just i had a very
[1:23:00] rough day i'm just winding down
[1:23:03] and then it becomes a habit that's where
[1:23:05] the problem starts
[1:23:07] but i realized that on my own i couldn't
[1:23:09] do it
[1:23:10] because it's something that
[1:23:13] you stop
[1:23:14] with your human abilities you reason
[1:23:16] with yourself
[1:23:18] you look at it you say you know what if
[1:23:19] i continue doing it
[1:23:21] i'm crucifying the lord jesus once more
[1:23:24] myself
[1:23:26] then you stop that's your own human
[1:23:27] abilities
[1:23:29] then three years or four years down the
[1:23:31] line you pick up the very same thing
[1:23:33] that you stopped four years ago
[1:23:35] you even ask yourself lord why i thought
[1:23:38] i'm an overcomer
[1:23:40] then what happened a few weeks ago i was
[1:23:44] sitting at home
[1:23:46] the young people came to pray
[1:23:49] and then normally either tiana would
[1:23:52] drop the tower
[1:23:53] or he'll ask one of us to come pick her
[1:23:55] up
[1:23:56] but that day she said i'm not coming
[1:23:58] back
[1:24:00] i'm going to be at church praying the
[1:24:02] whole night i'll come in the morning
[1:24:04] then that struck me
[1:24:07] i said okay it's normally
[1:24:09] parents praying for children
[1:24:13] now you look in there you realize that
[1:24:15] god is trying to work
[1:24:18] you are not giving in you're trying to
[1:24:20] work things out yourself
[1:24:22] i don't know what she's praying for
[1:24:24] but just the fact that she's going to be
[1:24:26] at church the whole night alone praying
[1:24:29] that struck me
[1:24:31] then the following day i received a
[1:24:33] message from sister hannah you because
[1:24:35] on the sisters group we pray for one
[1:24:36] another
[1:24:37] she says to me
[1:24:39] you're on my list
[1:24:41] for this week
[1:24:43] what can i pray for
[1:24:45] i said i've got only one request
[1:24:48] to be an overcomer
[1:24:50] then the ball started rolling from there
[1:24:53] and
[1:24:55] i just felt a weed lifting from me
[1:24:59] then the following week
[1:25:02] there was a brother who
[1:25:05] had a gift of
[1:25:07] divine healing and praying for people
[1:25:10] back home who passed on
[1:25:12] actually people trying praying for him
[1:25:14] he stopped them he said don't pray for
[1:25:15] me i am leaving he explained his
[1:25:17] circumstances how he saw himself going
[1:25:20] and then he doesn't want to be here
[1:25:21] anymore
[1:25:22] so you see people are different
[1:25:26] in
[1:25:27] new zealand and all the first world
[1:25:29] countries a wedding is a wedding and
[1:25:31] that's it a funeral is a funeral
[1:25:33] entertainment with us is it it's
[1:25:34] different
[1:25:35] every opportunity that we meet
[1:25:38] we reach out
[1:25:40] so
[1:25:41] that week of the funeral starting the
[1:25:44] thursday if not the wednesday
[1:25:46] they had services throughout
[1:25:49] and there was a revival for me i would
[1:25:51] see the
[1:25:52] i would be praising and worshiping four
[1:25:55] hours in a row
[1:25:57] and the following day the same thing
[1:25:59] it's
[1:26:00] because they started the midweek
[1:26:02] services with the family and they did
[1:26:04] the memorial service at church
[1:26:06] then the funeral as well was just the
[1:26:08] climax
[1:26:10] then
[1:26:11] i felt that
[1:26:13] what has been happening the past the
[1:26:15] previous week
[1:26:17] was really building up to something that
[1:26:19] is going to be a full overcoming for me
[1:26:22] then the next week i was sitting
[1:26:25] just finalizing wrapping up the week it
[1:26:27] was i think
[1:26:30] now it was actually the tuesday
[1:26:34] as i was sitting there i felt just
[1:26:37] something says
[1:26:38] stop the fasting normally i think about
[1:26:41] it and then i involve everyone and
[1:26:43] telling them that i'm going too fast
[1:26:45] then i started just there and i just
[1:26:47] involved i just told my husband tomorrow
[1:26:49] i'm starting here first i'm going to
[1:26:50] fast for seven days he said okay it's
[1:26:52] fine
[1:26:53] and
[1:26:55] the more you fast the more you pray
[1:26:57] then the one time i was kneeling down
[1:26:59] praying
[1:27:01] then i felt this unwelcome presence
[1:27:05] and then i knew that the fight is on now
[1:27:08] but with my eyes closed
[1:27:11] i saw i saw two demons standing right
[1:27:14] behind me trying to pressurize me with
[1:27:16] fear
[1:27:18] and then i told them
[1:27:20] your time is up
[1:27:22] this is where it ends
[1:27:24] so
[1:27:26] while i'm is struggling so you guys are
[1:27:29] the ones busy
[1:27:31] influencing me to carry on this way
[1:27:34] imagine what i'm fighting with looks
[1:27:37] very innocent
[1:27:39] because you wouldn't find me
[1:27:42] watching anything that is evil
[1:27:45] but look when i look behind me
[1:27:48] this is in the spirit world my eyes are
[1:27:50] closed i'm busy praying i can see those
[1:27:52] two demons
[1:27:53] so i'm just saying just watch what
[1:27:55] you're doing it may look innocent
[1:27:59] but it's not always innocent if it's if
[1:28:01] it's taking you away from god
[1:28:03] or if it's taking you away even from
[1:28:05] just
[1:28:06] progressing even with your career
[1:28:08] because if you're in this world you
[1:28:10] still need to be able
[1:28:12] to progress to be able to fend for your
[1:28:14] family so if what you are doing is
[1:28:16] making you be stagnant
[1:28:18] realize that is the devil behind that
[1:28:21] so i just want to give god the glory and
[1:28:24] the honor because on my own i wouldn't
[1:28:26] have done that but when i look at
[1:28:28] everything around that someone starting
[1:28:31] to pray the other one saying can i pray
[1:28:32] for you the other ones just giving
[1:28:35] testimonies after testimonies at a
[1:28:37] funeral service i keep looking back i'm
[1:28:40] saying so my revival came through a
[1:28:43] funeral service
[1:28:44] and it really just
[1:28:46] blows my mind
[1:28:48] i thank god for that god
[1:28:56] little amalekites that make their way in
[1:28:58] your life hey
[1:29:00] brother andy hey man i wasn't going to
[1:29:03] he was going to
[1:29:05] carry on and then sister
[1:29:07] sepi
[1:29:08] took the bold move amen god bless you
[1:29:10] sister sepi that was really awesome
[1:29:13] um so
[1:29:14] like actually it's quite interesting my
[1:29:16] testimony is
[1:29:18] it's gonna flow from that very well um
[1:29:23] these meetings
[1:29:24] were so powerful for me
[1:29:26] because we need the body
[1:29:29] we need each other
[1:29:31] and and i don't know if anyone really
[1:29:33] felt the theme was this was a body we're
[1:29:36] a family and we need each other so much
[1:29:40] and more than we realize because when we
[1:29:43] and this covert and all the pressure of
[1:29:45] society and everything that's come on
[1:29:48] and pressuring us is trying to separate
[1:29:50] us
[1:29:51] it's trying to part us it's trying to
[1:29:52] divide us and when we're away and apart
[1:29:55] and the devil's attacking our mind
[1:29:57] about this thing and that thing and and
[1:29:59] it's all just a bunch of lies
[1:30:01] and it gets festering in our minds and
[1:30:03] we beg and well i'm talking for myself
[1:30:05] you know and you begin to feel animosity
[1:30:08] a little bit carnal that's just a carnal
[1:30:10] man right
[1:30:11] and i'm definitely um that youtube i
[1:30:14] don't watch evil things or anything but
[1:30:16] i watch woodturning
[1:30:18] and it when you said wind down from a
[1:30:21] hard day
[1:30:22] it's exactly exactly
[1:30:25] and and it really that i that that was
[1:30:27] my reasoning i would do that
[1:30:30] i would sit down and i'd put on you know
[1:30:32] everyone's gone to bed i might just
[1:30:33] watch some wood
[1:30:34] [Laughter]
[1:30:36] someone turning wood on the lathe you
[1:30:37] know i'm just
[1:30:38] watching that
[1:30:40] that's my prime time with jesus
[1:30:43] prayer time
[1:30:44] fighting a battle
[1:30:46] praying for people praying for myself
[1:30:48] and
[1:30:49] so you know i would do that and and and
[1:30:52] and you know over the last however long
[1:30:55] you know a year you could say um just
[1:30:58] being busy
[1:30:59] um
[1:31:00] and
[1:31:01] you know i just started getting flat
[1:31:04] and started getting carnal
[1:31:06] just begin to
[1:31:08] um become
[1:31:10] a bit
[1:31:11] i don't know detached
[1:31:13] emotionally detached socially even to
[1:31:15] the point where i don't even feel like
[1:31:17] going to church you know something
[1:31:19] that's how bad it can get and it can be
[1:31:20] so innocent just by not having a good
[1:31:23] spiritual revival in my life
[1:31:26] and you know what i was at these
[1:31:28] meetings and just being together
[1:31:31] and and i believe that it was ordained
[1:31:33] of the lord for us to be charged
[1:31:36] recharged and i believe that we've been
[1:31:39] recharged and something that really
[1:31:41] struck me for myself as i in the
[1:31:43] recharge and you know
[1:31:45] now we're in recharge stay charged
[1:31:48] for me
[1:31:49] you know i've been
[1:31:51] recharged and now i'm going to stay
[1:31:53] charged and that's a fight
[1:31:55] and for myself i'm fighting
[1:31:57] in prayer and spending time with the
[1:31:59] lord and feeding on the word and
[1:32:01] rejoicing
[1:32:03] just a pure joy in the lord because the
[1:32:06] spiritual man needs strength the
[1:32:09] spiritual man needs food if you don't if
[1:32:13] i don't feed the spiritual man
[1:32:15] i'm not going to preach so if i don't
[1:32:17] feed the spiritual man my old nature is
[1:32:20] going to get strong and then it starts
[1:32:21] dictating things and it starts wanting
[1:32:24] things and it starts the struggles that
[1:32:26] i've
[1:32:27] you know in the old man begins to starts
[1:32:30] to rise up so it's
[1:32:32] important that the spiritual man gets
[1:32:34] his food
[1:32:36] gets her food and a lot of it
[1:32:38] hey amen let's open our arms and say
[1:32:42] lord fill my cup
[1:32:43] to overflowing
[1:32:45] and and take advantage of every moment
[1:32:48] that we're together
[1:32:49] because our flick of fires together and
[1:32:52] it's more glory and then when we pray
[1:32:55] just lord fill me up i need to be full
[1:32:58] of the holy ghost i need to be full of
[1:33:00] your love and and that's been something
[1:33:02] that's been such a blessing to me over
[1:33:04] this weekend is that i've been filled
[1:33:07] with as love and without being
[1:33:09] spiritually strong
[1:33:11] there's no way we can
[1:33:12] handle the pressure of this world
[1:33:15] and so i believe to this is me in
[1:33:18] revival amen and so alleluia i believe
[1:33:22] that we can all be in revival
[1:33:24] hallelujah let's stand with each other
[1:33:27] for each other in revival and let's feed
[1:33:30] each other if someone comes to my place
[1:33:33] to to fellowship i'm going to make sure
[1:33:35] i give them food not just natural
[1:33:37] spiritual food if i come to your place
[1:33:39] please give me spiritual food because
[1:33:41] i'm hungry and i'm needy amen we all
[1:33:45] need each other and we need him and it's
[1:33:49] god with skin on
[1:33:50] amen amen
[1:34:05] hey listen i can do this all night you
[1:34:07] know me hey i i
[1:34:09] i'm a fool for christ
[1:34:11] so if you find this boring just shake
[1:34:14] yourself out because this is about to
[1:34:15] get better amen
[1:34:18] i i wasn't actually going to do this but
[1:34:20] um
[1:34:21] i actually said um to a few people over
[1:34:24] the weekend
[1:34:26] about how i felt about the weekend but
[1:34:29] with what sister sheppy said and with
[1:34:31] what andy said i thought there's no way
[1:34:33] i'm not going to give god the glory
[1:34:35] again okay so i'll
[1:34:37] we can give him the glory once and twice
[1:34:39] but we can give him the glory all the
[1:34:40] time okay so
[1:34:42] um
[1:34:44] um as most of you know i was struck down
[1:34:46] with covenant and i was actually
[1:34:48] really really sick and um it got to the
[1:34:51] point where i just was not getting
[1:34:53] better and every day was the battle
[1:34:56] and um
[1:34:58] anyway i started to get a bit better
[1:35:00] and um
[1:35:01] the friday night
[1:35:03] um
[1:35:05] was okay to go to the services but i was
[1:35:08] actually really tired at the end of it
[1:35:09] all and
[1:35:10] i got home and um
[1:35:13] saturday morning matt said to me
[1:35:16] just stay home and rest because he could
[1:35:18] see that that i was really it had taken
[1:35:21] a lot out of me and i was really really
[1:35:22] tired
[1:35:24] so
[1:35:24] um i took the opportunity to stay home
[1:35:27] and i actually i couldn't actually get
[1:35:29] out of bed on saturday morning
[1:35:31] and everybody had gone
[1:35:33] and
[1:35:34] i opened up youtube
[1:35:42] i opened up youtube and um
[1:35:45] and i was watching and then i started to
[1:35:47] get really really angry
[1:35:49] and i
[1:35:50] i was angry and i was jealous because
[1:35:54] i really wanted to be at the meetings on
[1:35:56] saturday but i
[1:35:58] i just couldn't give and i just
[1:36:00] i just didn't have the energy and i
[1:36:02] didn't have the strength and
[1:36:04] i was actually really i was laying in my
[1:36:06] bed and i was i was so angry
[1:36:09] with what this culvert was doing to me
[1:36:12] and how i was feeling and and all of
[1:36:14] that because it's not me anybody that
[1:36:16] knows me knows that
[1:36:18] i'm really not someone that just lays in
[1:36:20] their bed for days and days and days and
[1:36:22] days and my my kids will tell you i just
[1:36:26] lay in that bed for days and days and i
[1:36:29] couldn't actually get up and get out of
[1:36:31] it and i didn't know what was going on
[1:36:33] with me
[1:36:37] but the saturday morning i was just
[1:36:38] laying there and this anger was building
[1:36:41] up and
[1:36:43] and then andy's
[1:36:45] started to preach and he's um
[1:36:49] i was so disappointed with the whole
[1:36:51] situation
[1:36:53] and his title was
[1:36:57] from disappointment
[1:37:00] to divine appointment
[1:37:02] and it doesn't matter where you are you
[1:37:05] can be sitting in a church you can be
[1:37:06] sitting wherever i was laying in my bed
[1:37:11] with no energy
[1:37:13] and i didn't know what was happening
[1:37:15] and the lord
[1:37:16] came on the scene
[1:37:18] in a divine way he
[1:37:20] through andy
[1:37:22] he came into my room
[1:37:24] and he told me
[1:37:26] that i'm gonna be okay
[1:37:27] and he gave me the strength
[1:37:30] to be able to get up
[1:37:32] and i went from being angry and
[1:37:34] disappointed
[1:37:36] to having the strength to stand up
[1:37:40] and actually
[1:37:42] have a shower get dressed
[1:37:44] and i actually
[1:37:46] cooked
[1:37:48] lunch
[1:37:49] for sunday
[1:37:51] and be able to clean the kitchen and do
[1:37:54] things and
[1:37:56] it went from being
[1:37:58] anger and disappointment
[1:38:00] to a total divine appointment with the
[1:38:03] lord
[1:38:04] and
[1:38:05] it didn't it didn't matter that i was
[1:38:07] laying in my bed but if that appointment
[1:38:10] i had that appointment with him at that
[1:38:13] time
[1:38:14] as sick as i was he
[1:38:17] came through to me in my bed and
[1:38:21] rose me up and it was it was so
[1:38:23] appropriate over the weekend jesus rose
[1:38:26] so did i i rose out of my bed and i face
[1:38:29] the world and since then every single
[1:38:33] day i've been getting better and
[1:38:35] stronger and i've not laid in that bed
[1:38:38] again
[1:38:39] so i just want to thank the lord for
[1:38:41] that and thank you andy for you know
[1:38:43] just
[1:38:44] heeding always heating to the lord's
[1:38:46] call and and

[1:39:52] trouble i love you all
[1:39:55] i love you all
[1:39:57] and um
[1:39:59] just quickly breaking it down so on
[1:40:01] monday night
[1:40:04] so last monday
[1:40:06] um
[1:40:07] i sent out a little text we've got a
[1:40:10] little whatsapp group for them for our
[1:40:12] mobile sound
[1:40:14] and streaming
[1:40:16] and i said um
[1:40:18] why do i hear a little birdie chip that
[1:40:21] we are doing the sound and streaming at
[1:40:25] this
[1:40:26] feeling meetings because me and lundy we
[1:40:29] were starting to think oh we're gonna
[1:40:31] have an awesome time next to each other
[1:40:33] just gonna rejoice by the way it was our
[1:40:35] wedding anniversary on sunday i was like
[1:40:37] that was perfect yeah
[1:40:39] [Laughter]
[1:40:42] and uh yeah
[1:40:44] here comes the work so
[1:40:46] the lord the lord knows and i've and
[1:40:48] i've made a vow to him we will labor
[1:40:50] while it's day and that's why we're here
[1:40:54] so yes so and and the lord blessed
[1:40:57] brother armand brother matthew at the
[1:40:58] back so
[1:41:00] so relaxed and i'm stressing lundy says
[1:41:04] i don't fear i don't fear covet at all
[1:41:06] but
[1:41:07] if there's nothing planned and we
[1:41:09] supposed to do things i
[1:41:11] i get a bit jittery anyway
[1:41:13] so they were so calm and so relaxed and
[1:41:16] i have got questions i think brother
[1:41:18] armand's question he said brother
[1:41:21] brother alpha's sound was the only
[1:41:23] concern he had
[1:41:25] the sound coming from brother alpha
[1:41:28] i said i'm very glad you've got only one
[1:41:30] concern i've got several
[1:41:32] so that's how that conversation started
[1:41:36] but
[1:41:37] in all honesty everything
[1:41:40] everything worked out everything worked
[1:41:41] out brother matt went beforehand looked
[1:41:44] at the facility by the way
[1:41:46] all the everything that you saw in the
[1:41:49] church not in the kitchen ran on two
[1:41:52] plugs
[1:41:53] two plugs
[1:41:54] that in itself
[1:41:57] it's it's incredible that that that's
[1:42:00] not the town hall that's that's
[1:42:02] providing that power i can tell you in
[1:42:04] that the lord was there before us and he
[1:42:06] started preparing because he saw he knew
[1:42:09] right
[1:42:10] so with that in mind and with the week
[1:42:12] going on i've been making plans for the
[1:42:15] monday because we didn't have services
[1:42:18] sorry
[1:42:20] yeah yeah monday i would have gone
[1:42:21] hunting or something but then
[1:42:24] there was this opportunity for me to to
[1:42:27] get some meat and everything and i was
[1:42:28] telling a friend yes you know i'll make
[1:42:30] a plan we can we can do it i think i
[1:42:32] said on saturday was it saturday
[1:42:34] initially
[1:42:35] and then it just couldn't work out so i
[1:42:38] had to go back to
[1:42:40] to him and say
[1:42:41] is there any way we can move it out to
[1:42:43] monday
[1:42:44] and um
[1:42:46] again that's the lord he came back and
[1:42:47] said yes yeah because now we're talking
[1:42:50] i'm throwing other other people's plans
[1:42:52] now on the road and then and and
[1:42:55] everything just worked out
[1:42:57] and i said thank you very much we could
[1:42:59] we can do that on monday and get
[1:43:00] together
[1:43:03] within the meeting so in the meetings i
[1:43:06] was i was tremendously tremendously
[1:43:09] blessed with each uh message and and i
[1:43:12] won't go into that because brother monty
[1:43:14] you gave us the highlights
[1:43:17] but but sunday was was was big sunday
[1:43:20] night
[1:43:21] sunday afternoon nights
[1:43:23] sermon
[1:43:25] we came
[1:43:27] on monday
[1:43:28] and and this this thing i organized was
[1:43:31] to slaughter some sheep
[1:43:34] and it tied in
[1:43:35] so perfectly after brother ben's sermon
[1:43:39] that i saw this in real life
[1:43:42] i had the blood on my hands for real
[1:43:44] life
[1:43:45] i
[1:43:46] i saw that when that sheep is on its
[1:43:49] feet it just wants to get away
[1:43:52] but once you've got them in that
[1:43:54] position josh you can testify he tried
[1:43:56] it he pulled it up first time
[1:43:59] put it on its bum put it down and it you
[1:44:02] could pit it it was so it just gave up
[1:44:05] it was surrendered
[1:44:07] and
[1:44:08] what was what was actually quite sad was
[1:44:11] it was ready
[1:44:12] it was ready to be
[1:44:14] to to give its life
[1:44:17] and we did it and and there was no
[1:44:19] struggle or anything but that
[1:44:21] got so real to me that he here it is we
[1:44:25] can we can preach as much as we like
[1:44:27] but here it is
[1:44:29] and don't you worry the amalekites were
[1:44:32] there they were trying to come in
[1:44:35] into those meetings
[1:44:37] so being in a in a position that i am
[1:44:40] unfortunately we see the good and the
[1:44:42] bad
[1:44:43] but
[1:44:44] brother andy i'm so glad you said that
[1:44:47] that i saw a body i saw a body of
[1:44:50] believers i saw walls broken down i saw
[1:44:53] people that's just hungering to
[1:44:56] fellowship around the world
[1:44:57] be amongst people of like-minded faith
[1:45:00] because what we are hypocrites out there
[1:45:03] praise the lord and here i have my true
[1:45:05] identity and with that i
[1:45:08] got to love people more because they
[1:45:11] identified the malachite immediately
[1:45:14] addressed it immediately got it out the
[1:45:17] door immediately
[1:45:19] i i have more love
[1:45:21] for people like that now
[1:45:23] because they they they knew as well they
[1:45:26] knew as well imagine quickly it was just
[1:45:30] standing there sorry i'm taking a bit of
[1:45:32] time um
[1:45:34] when moses was a baby and he was in the
[1:45:36] basket
[1:45:39] what would that that princess or
[1:45:41] whatever pharaoh's whoever would they
[1:45:44] have done the same if they know what
[1:45:46] they know now
[1:45:48] they would have killed that baby they
[1:45:50] had the law it was it was there
[1:45:52] and what happened so the same
[1:45:55] don't pit this malachi don't don't make
[1:45:57] it grow
[1:45:59] get it out the door so praise the lord
[1:46:02] this this weekend was awesome the week
[1:46:05] is already a challenge so praise the
[1:46:06] lord i love it amen

[1:46:41] was thinking about david i don't mean to

[1:46:46] i was thinking man that boy has had so
[1:46:49] much prayer put into him and god's put
[1:46:51] so much
[1:46:52] people into his life and what would we
[1:46:54] be without each other like i was just
[1:46:55] thinking
[1:46:56] oh he he put three young men
[1:46:59] down at the bottom of our house
[1:47:01] marian bin john and he went over there
[1:47:04] probably disturbed them and so they
[1:47:06] would pray for him they prayed for him

[1:47:20] minutes to our house when we were
[1:47:22] filming would pick him up have him over
[1:47:24] and then he would take him back
[1:47:26] um and then sister melissa the myburg
[1:47:29] family lived by us going through a hard
[1:47:31] time they would start praying then
[1:47:32] sister robin i it was amazing i would
[1:47:35] tell her sister robin

[1:50:22] left the message church
[1:50:24] we went
[1:50:25] out
[1:50:27] after five years in new zealand
[1:50:29] to the salvation army
[1:50:33] pastor moses met me he wasn't a pastor
[1:50:36] at the time he was a brother
[1:50:39] and he greeted me
[1:50:40] the same way
[1:50:42] and after i left he greeted me the same
[1:50:44] way when he saw me
[1:50:46] always greeted me shook my hand he said
[1:50:48] man of god
[1:50:51] i didn't know what it means i didn't i
[1:50:53] didn't take any notice because i was
[1:50:55] away from the missed church i was
[1:50:56] running away david i've been there
[1:50:59] all right i was running away
[1:51:01] because i didn't want this and i didn't
[1:51:03] want that and i wanted to be comfortable
[1:51:05] i want a little bit of youtube i want
[1:51:07] some some movies yeah
[1:51:09] but this man of god
[1:51:12] saw me the same from day one
[1:51:15] till
[1:51:16] sunday when i met him he greeted me the
[1:51:19] same way
[1:51:21] now who can be
[1:51:23] that that is only god in the man
[1:51:26] god is living in him
[1:51:28] therefore he's a pastor today
[1:51:30] right so
[1:51:31] i just wanted to share that little bit
[1:51:33] because brother moses never changed the
[1:51:36] way he
[1:51:37] saw me he never changed the way he
[1:51:39] looked at me he never changed when he
[1:51:43] greeted me or he had didn't have
[1:51:45] anything in him to say oh
[1:51:48] you run away before
[1:51:49] no
[1:51:50] he greeted me the same way
[1:51:52] so
[1:51:54] that is very important for brother moses
[1:51:56] he's got a very special place in my
[1:51:58] heart because of that
[1:52:00] simple thing of his simplicity that god
[1:52:04] has made him in that way
[1:52:06] that he could
[1:52:07] touch you
[1:52:09] he could love you he could respect you
[1:52:11] for who you are whether you are
[1:52:13] struggling whether you're on top of the
[1:52:15] world whether you're down in the gutter
[1:52:17] the same
[1:52:19] so i just want to
[1:52:21] say thank you to brother moses if he's
[1:52:23] watching this
[1:52:25] we appreciate you and we respect you as
[1:52:27] a pastor

[1:55:25] want to be worse than the devil
[1:55:28] so i happen to invite everyone
[1:55:31] um
[1:55:33] small detail

[1:56:08] let's yeah because you see the hunger
[1:56:11] three weeks brother moses said he didn't
[1:56:13] even invite the whole country because
[1:56:14] the building was too small and covert
[1:56:16] restrictions were going on about three
[1:56:18] weeks all those people came we all came
[1:56:20] just because we want to i think people
[1:56:22] have come to a place where they just
[1:56:23] want to get in contact with the
[1:56:24] supernatural god it's not about like few
[1:56:27] years ago there was that convention in
[1:56:29] rotorua if i can say it maybe i'm
[1:56:30] trouble but it was all factions and this
[1:56:32] one's checking out this one and this
[1:56:34] one's standing against this one
[1:56:35] preaching it's this thing and
[1:56:37] it was terrible it was all but now
[1:56:39] that's gone
[1:56:40] we've taken a wrecking ball and just
[1:56:42] just
[1:56:43] bulldozed the walls and you know god but
[1:56:45] god's doing that
[1:56:46] so i'm exp yeah i believe we can have a

[2:00:30] musicians you can all have a seat as
[2:00:31] well i promise i'll try to be fast
[2:00:33] because i know we're late but i i need
[2:00:35] to say something here
[2:00:37] i love you all
[2:00:39] you're the reason
[2:00:41] i wake up in the morning
[2:00:43] i i am not a pastor
[2:00:46] by no means
[2:00:48] but i always thought if if i would ever
[2:00:50] lay my life down if if my last day was
[2:00:53] here upon earth i believe i'm going to
[2:00:54] take the rapture i'm just saying that
[2:00:56] just for the record
[2:00:58] but if the lord should take me before
[2:01:00] that time
[2:01:01] okay
[2:01:02] i want people to stand there and say you
[2:01:05] know what brother mund was a for real
[2:01:07] life christian amen
[2:01:10] and the devil hated him
[2:01:12] and he loved god and he walked with god
[2:01:15] amen
[2:01:16] and shouldn't be that all of our
[2:01:18] testimonies
[2:01:20] because see
[2:01:22] i'm going to put my notes away but
[2:01:23] there's one thing i want to say
[2:01:26] jesus said it is finished
[2:01:29] and then if we look at at
[2:01:31] john 18 he gets to a stage and and he
[2:01:34] says here and we know what happens there
[2:01:37] is he's in the garden praying
[2:01:40] and judas iscariot comes in with his
[2:01:42] posse of of dudes to come in
[2:01:44] and crucify our lord take him away
[2:01:47] and they come before the lord and they
[2:01:49] ask him this and this is the thing that
[2:01:51] caught me now they said
[2:01:52] they they said
[2:01:54] i want to read it to you i'll read it
[2:01:56] they went in john 18
[2:01:59] and
[2:02:02] verse 4 it says jesus therefore knowing
[2:02:04] all things that should come upon him
[2:02:08] he knew he knew everything was going to
[2:02:09] happen right now i need your attention
[2:02:11] so if there's any children that want to
[2:02:13] sleep now i pray the lord would wake you
[2:02:16] up
[2:02:18] these testimonies that i will share is
[2:02:19] not to bore you and it's not to get you
[2:02:22] i know it's late but guys let's push
[2:02:24] just just five minutes man ten minutes
[2:02:27] let's push it back now
[2:02:30] okay because think about it children if
[2:02:32] jesus christ stopped in front of the
[2:02:34] cross and just said oh just i cannot do
[2:02:36] it sorry i had enough and he turned
[2:02:37] around he walked away
[2:02:39] we wouldn't be sitting here
[2:02:41] we couldn't overcome and we would have
[2:02:43] been nowhere because we weren't in the
[2:02:45] economy of god we weren't god's chosen
[2:02:47] people
[2:02:49] we were just here by grace never forget
[2:02:51] it
[2:02:52] god has no right you have no right
[2:02:55] in your life
[2:02:57] children
[2:02:58] to say i'm a christian god makes you
[2:03:00] what you are you are predestinated
[2:03:03] brother david you're predestinated
[2:03:06] but god don't owe us nothing he paid
[2:03:08] that price he doesn't know us nothing
[2:03:11] but he loves us
[2:03:13] so if we ask five minutes man give it
[2:03:15] your five minutes man is that last five
[2:03:18] minutes let's push it don't don't fall
[2:03:20] asleep you'll miss your blessing man
[2:03:21] it'll go right past you
[2:03:23] amen
[2:03:25] it says
[2:03:27] jesus says went forth and he said unto
[2:03:29] them who seek you but look he says jesus
[2:03:32] therefore knowing all that should come
[2:03:34] upon him so he knows what's going to
[2:03:36] happen
[2:03:36] he's standing there and he knows
[2:03:39] and he's looking them and he says who
[2:03:40] seek ye who do you seek
[2:03:44] and they answer him they say jesus of
[2:03:47] nazareth
[2:03:49] now who was with him
[2:03:52] judas
[2:03:54] so
[2:03:55] judas is here with all these guys
[2:03:57] he's just
[2:03:58] if you look at the whole book of john
[2:04:00] that i that i went through in chapter
[2:04:02] six he's been feeding 5 000 people he
[2:04:04] went over to um capernaum
[2:04:07] walked on the water gone on the boat
[2:04:09] went over all the boats went over with
[2:04:11] him because they wanted more bread more
[2:04:13] miracles more everything they wanted the
[2:04:14] easy thing and he said no no take other
[2:04:17] breed take my life take take something
[2:04:19] you can you cannot hunger again
[2:04:21] so so the people know what's going on
[2:04:23] and these people coming to arrest him is
[2:04:26] asking we want jesus of nazareth when
[2:04:28] they went there do you not think they
[2:04:30] knew who he was
[2:04:32] do you not think they had the knowledge
[2:04:34] of who they're going to arrest or they
[2:04:36] just blindly did it and just trust the
[2:04:38] word of a guy called judas that sold him
[2:04:40] for 30 pieces of silver
[2:04:43] they knew what they were doing
[2:04:45] this wasn't done in the dark
[2:04:47] but i want to show you something we want
[2:04:48] to go on and this is the thing that
[2:04:50] struck me
[2:04:52] and he says i am he
[2:04:54] and judas also which betrayed him stood
[2:04:57] with them
[2:04:59] so he's looking at this all
[2:05:01] and as soon as he said it
[2:05:03] i am he they went backward
[2:05:08] they went backward they fell backward
[2:05:11] now how many people has been in this
[2:05:13] message this is my burden
[2:05:15] and said i've experienced god i've seen
[2:05:18] miracles
[2:05:19] i've tasted of the bread of life i had
[2:05:22] experience
[2:05:24] and then when i say i am he
[2:05:27] i am he that died for you on the cross
[2:05:28] i'm he
[2:05:30] they fall backwards
[2:05:35] because look when they fell backwards
[2:05:37] what happened
[2:05:39] and they fell backward and they fell to
[2:05:40] the ground and he asked him again
[2:05:43] usiki
[2:05:46] and they said jesus of nazareth and
[2:05:48] jesus told them i am he
[2:05:51] if ye therefore ye seek me
[2:05:54] let these go their way
[2:05:56] now isn't it strange
[2:05:59] that we're in a message that gives us
[2:06:01] hope life love temperance
[2:06:04] okay meekness gentleness kindness
[2:06:07] brotherly love bringing us all together
[2:06:10] as as as all the testimonies here
[2:06:12] tonight saying we need each other we
[2:06:14] need god
[2:06:16] so if if we're all in one accord
[2:06:18] or going forward with the lord who's the
[2:06:21] ones kicking against the message
[2:06:24] brother qimin said it the ones that
[2:06:26] wants a little bit of the world who's
[2:06:28] the ones kicking and saying all these
[2:06:30] rules all these regulations you know
[2:06:32] it's a hard saying you know weep bands
[2:06:34] and cut skirts and no no no no whoa whoa
[2:06:37] hold on
[2:06:38] just hear me out
[2:06:40] who's the ones kicking against the
[2:06:42] message do they have any better
[2:06:45] do they have any better where do they go
[2:06:47] to they go backwards because see when
[2:06:50] the church ages was restored
[2:06:52] when all the seven church ages moved on
[2:06:55] god added and added and added and he
[2:06:57] never took away
[2:06:59] but when he came now in the form of a
[2:07:01] prophet and he started opening the seals
[2:07:04] and he says i am he
[2:07:05] they couldn't take it and they walked
[2:07:07] away now i'm not majoring on them but i
[2:07:09] want to show you something these people
[2:07:11] knew who jesus was they saw the miracles
[2:07:14] the testimonies were said and then when
[2:07:16] he's when they go to arrest him to
[2:07:18] crucify him he says i am he so for me
[2:07:22] that's a cry out to say hey
[2:07:24] i am jesus of nazareth
[2:07:26] but you actually have a chance
[2:07:29] but they had their minds made up
[2:07:32] they didn't listen to those words
[2:07:35] and then he says to them he says so let
[2:07:37] it can be fulfilled to say let these go
[2:07:40] their way
[2:07:41] and their prophecy on it was saying that
[2:07:43] might be
[2:07:44] fulfilled which he spake of that theme
[2:07:46] that gave us me
[2:07:48] to them that thou gavest me i lost none
[2:07:53] now here it comes to us
[2:07:55] and then i'll close with this
[2:07:57] jesus christ
[2:07:59] very last commandment
[2:08:01] very last thing that he asked us i
[2:08:03] thirst after everything is gone for us
[2:08:05] everything is done for us

[2:08:09] finished and he said it already in
[2:08:11] chapter 18. he says
[2:08:13] i've lost none
[2:08:17] so this is this is not now anymore about
[2:08:19] us

[2:08:22] resurrection weekend was there it wasn't
[2:08:25] about us
[2:08:26] it's all about him
[2:08:28] we just sang it it's all about you jesus
[2:08:32] and he said
[2:08:33] he said no matter what state you
[2:08:35] currently now gonna be or where you
[2:08:38] think you are ending up he said i have
[2:08:41] lost
[2:08:41] none

[2:08:57] and utterance and prophecy and i will
[2:08:59] make mountains moves but you will come

[2:09:06] it's the father that's within you and
[2:09:08] you know what you might feel man it's
[2:09:10] hard and i don't understand all the
[2:09:12] mysteries and and this world is so shiny
[2:09:14] and it's so easy to get
[2:09:16] distracted it's fine
[2:09:19] do you not think that the almighty god
[2:09:22] cannot get you out of your state
[2:09:25] amen
[2:09:26] and i want to declare to you if you're
[2:09:28] running
[2:09:30] if you are running and your parents are
[2:09:32] praying
[2:09:34] watch out amen
[2:09:36] watch out
[2:09:37] i was running
[2:09:39] i was running my parents were praying
[2:09:43] some people might not have 32 years in
[2:09:45] their life to run but tell me
[2:09:48] can god not save you
[2:09:50] can god not get you where you are
[2:09:53] don't lose hope don't try to figure this
[2:09:55] out don't try to fit into a mold don't
[2:09:57] try to don't try to deny who you who you
[2:10:00] are
[2:10:02] just be for real life christian
[2:10:04] just be for real say god i don't
[2:10:06] understand it fine there's nothing wrong
[2:10:08] with it god i don't feel it there's
[2:10:11] nothing wrong with it
[2:10:12] brother andy is just saying he's had a
[2:10:14] revival and he's been jumping on up man
[2:10:16] you've been jumping i love that hey it
[2:10:18] was good to see you jumping brother andy
[2:10:20] and i just don't feel i want to jump
[2:10:22] like him at the moment just hold on
[2:10:26] just hold on god said i will lose
[2:10:29] none
[2:10:29] amen so parents if god if the devil says
[2:10:33] to you your children is lost that's not
[2:10:35] what god said
[2:10:37] god declared it already before he was
[2:10:39] crucified
[2:10:40] before he went for the crucifixion
[2:10:42] before he got the stripes on his back
[2:10:44] for our healing before he was beaten and
[2:10:47] his beard ripped out before people spat
[2:10:49] on him and gave him false worship
[2:10:52] before that he said i've lost none
[2:10:58] so that's before he took the cross how
[2:11:00] much not more now after the cross when
[2:11:02] the blood has been shed and there's a
[2:11:04] way back to jesus christ
[2:11:07] how much not more
[2:11:08] now it must mean something man
[2:11:14] so if church is boring
[2:11:16] hold on
[2:11:17] god has got more for you in store but i
[2:11:20] want to bring you to what i opened up
[2:11:21] this morning or this evening
[2:11:25] if you put in as much effort into this
[2:11:28] gospel
[2:11:29] into our lord jesus christ as we put
[2:11:31] into youtube and twitter and facebook
[2:11:35] and snapchats
[2:11:37] and what's the other things that they do
[2:11:39] young people instagrams
[2:11:42] micrograms or whatever it wants to be
[2:11:44] doesn't care man i've got all day i used
[2:11:46] to know these things but if you could if
[2:11:49] you could take that time so it's a tip
[2:11:50] you said it's so beautiful
[2:11:52] and you can just say okay lord you know
[2:11:54] what i don't know all the things but
[2:11:56] what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go back
[2:11:58] to you and say you know what
[2:12:00] i will give you at least
[2:12:02] my worship in the morning and i'll give
[2:12:04] you my i will not do device time before
[2:12:06] i play my head down i will put that
[2:12:09] stinking phone down or i will pick up my
[2:12:12] bible or i'll put on a tape or i'll sing
[2:12:14] a song to you but i will consciously
[2:12:16] will do an effort lord to get closer to
[2:12:18] you watch what happens in your life
[2:12:22] because you know what when i struggle
[2:12:23] the most when i struggle the most is
[2:12:26] when i feed the most of those things and
[2:12:28] everybody testified to that
[2:12:31] is there anybody in this building that
[2:12:32] cannot testify to that
[2:12:34] when is it going hard in your life
[2:12:37] when is it going hard in my life
[2:12:39] when i do this
[2:12:42] because it's shiny
[2:12:44] and you know what the world is designed
[2:12:46] to be shiny it is the best satan could
[2:12:49] do gives you the best soccer player or
[2:12:52] the best ragbio chester colby man that
[2:12:54] guy's name was mentioned more and more
[2:12:56] outside the stage than jesus christ it
[2:12:58] was come on reuben
[2:13:01] sidesteps and he does this and he's so
[2:13:03] cool and so and i'm like i don't even
[2:13:05] know which history is and then he i
[2:13:07] guess i go and google chase there and he
[2:13:08] does a stepping
[2:13:12] he's got a point
[2:13:13] but
[2:13:15] but
[2:13:16] what is that promoting how did it help
[2:13:19] me one day to defeat the enemy one day
[2:13:24] he never said i love jesus christ i
[2:13:26] don't know that
[2:13:28] when he was playing wreck he gave his
[2:13:29] gift to who to the world
[2:13:31] now musicians
[2:13:33] i'm going to close now but while the
[2:13:36] lord dropped in my head
[2:13:37] you have gifts
[2:13:40] the world is writing songs
[2:13:43] about our god
[2:13:46] those people out there are writing songs
[2:13:48] about god
[2:13:50] and they use their gifts and they make
[2:13:52] money off it
[2:13:53] yeah man and they push those gifts and
[2:13:55] it's hill's song and all these songs and
[2:13:57] everybody's song and every band can play
[2:13:59] seeing jesus christ do you know how much
[2:14:01] talent is sitting tonight in this church
[2:14:07] a gift that god places in your
[2:14:10] in your body
[2:14:11] before the time before world even began
[2:14:15] he placed a gift in you you're a
[2:14:18] musician i don't even know a key man i
[2:14:20] can't even find my car keys sometimes
[2:14:21] i'm like brother andy
[2:14:23] i don't man we can lose keys quickly hey
[2:14:27] i don't have it but you know what
[2:14:29] i've got a guitar and i can maybe only
[2:14:32] play the key of dn only really badly but
[2:14:34] i'm trying
[2:14:35] but there's musicians and gifts in our
[2:14:38] church
[2:14:40] that god has placed here to further the
[2:14:43] kingdom of god and you choose to sit on
[2:14:45] your chair
[2:14:47] shame on you when jesus christ just
[2:14:49] wanted a little bit of water
[2:14:51] after everything he suffered for us
[2:14:54] and we choose to sit on our chair and
[2:14:57] when the time comes up to testify or to
[2:14:59] sing a special you hide it under a
[2:15:01] bushel
[2:15:02] now hear me out i've been there
[2:15:05] you think i like standing here i'm as
[2:15:07] nervous as i could be every time i get
[2:15:09] up here because i know that god will
[2:15:10] hold me accountable for every word that
[2:15:12] comes out of my mouth i am sometimes
[2:15:15] sitting there thinking what am i doing
[2:15:17] but you know what i'm going to do it
[2:15:18] anyways because i love him
[2:15:20] so why don't you take your gift and you
[2:15:22] give it back to the lord and you see
[2:15:24] what happens you think every time i had
[2:15:27] a real battle brother isaac at a stage
[2:15:29] man you were writing songs like there's
[2:15:31] no tomorrow
[2:15:32] and every song peace be stole i needed
[2:15:35] to be have peace be still i'm sailing
[2:15:37] you know and then i even sang it just
[2:15:39] like brother isaac at the stage because
[2:15:40] i'll be sitting like oh no i'm saying
[2:15:42] lean over because every time i sing it
[2:15:46] it strengthens me
[2:15:48] because that time in my life i had
[2:15:50] turmoil but but god gave oh sorry
[2:15:53] brother isaac i love you but you just
[2:15:55] got that beautiful voice i wish i i
[2:15:57] would love to see one day like him i
[2:15:59] said i'm saying
[2:16:00] no i don't sound like you but you know
[2:16:04] but i could feel myself sailing away and
[2:16:06] all these problems and all the tension
[2:16:09] jubilee
[2:16:10] when did we dance at jubilee come on
[2:16:13] let's testify our church cam jubilee
[2:16:15] came out who was not dancing
[2:16:19] man i had my kids jubilee every day
[2:16:20] jubilee jubilee and everybody jubilee
[2:16:23] and we jubilee and everybody and why
[2:16:25] because a surrendered gift said i will
[2:16:27] write songs for god amen and that man
[2:16:30] was on a mission because he couldn't
[2:16:31] stop writing songs we we we struggled
[2:16:33] learning them faster he couldn't even
[2:16:35] remember office songs
[2:16:37] but it's not just brother isaac
[2:16:40] and i'm not saying everybody go write a
[2:16:41] song now
[2:16:43] look i'm way off my notes there's a
[2:16:45] reason for it
[2:16:46] but you're not just a musician
[2:16:49] you know
[2:16:50] sister jenny the labor you put into this
[2:16:52] church to make it look clean
[2:16:54] the time and effort you take on your
[2:16:56] side god bless you for it
[2:16:59] who else is doing it
[2:17:01] everybody has a place
[2:17:04] don't think on majors think on everybody
[2:17:06] and this body has a place
[2:17:08] and that's why i said one thing that
[2:17:10] reminds me of easter and when i look at
[2:17:12] the lord he says i lost none so kids
[2:17:14] you've got a big thing coming your way
[2:17:15] because you are coming
[2:17:18] no matter what the devil says
[2:17:20] and the ones that's not here they're
[2:17:21] just on their way they're just a bit
[2:17:23] sidetracked but they're on their way
[2:17:25] amen
[2:17:27] amen
[2:17:29] amen
[2:17:30] if you don't believe it i believe it for
[2:17:32] you amen
[2:17:35] 32 years old as lost as could be
[2:17:40] god reach the mercy through brother andy
[2:17:42] and brother ed and brother ben in my
[2:17:44] life
[2:17:45] if it wasn't for those three men
[2:17:47] i'm telling you i wouldn't be here i
[2:17:49] know predestination i know god but i
[2:17:51] would have gone around the mountain a
[2:17:52] couple of times more
[2:17:55] so now i'm going to close
[2:17:57] if you have a gift
[2:18:00] if you have a gift if god could give his
[2:18:02] life for you
[2:18:08] suffer do a lot of things for us
[2:18:12] i wouldn't even want to be there i
[2:18:14] wouldn't be able to see one of you go
[2:18:16] through that
[2:18:17] how much not more the the lord of glory
[2:18:20] don't you think you can give a little
[2:18:21] bit of your gift back your time

[2:18:40] divvy up how much time you give to the
[2:18:42] world and how much time you give to this
[2:18:43] gospel and how much time it takes to go
[2:18:45] and pray on your knees before you get to
[2:18:47] sleep and what do you pray about
[2:18:50] then i'll tell you how you're walking
[2:18:52] with the lord brother and he said it the
[2:18:53] same
[2:18:54] you get distracted

[2:18:58] would be boring
[2:19:02] i'm sorry

[2:19:05] but then again it's not my interest
[2:19:07] okay but don't worry i've got plenty of
[2:19:09] other things i'm watching okay

[2:19:34] okay so if there was anything i got out
[2:19:36] of tonight if there's anything i got out
[2:19:38] of tonight let us have a revival
[2:19:41] let us change the way we see each other
[2:19:44] change the things we look at and start
[2:19:46] giving god back what god deserves amen

[2:19:51] if we kind of do it if we're going to
[2:19:53] jump in let's jump in completely or
[2:19:55] let's leave it
[2:19:57] but don't go halfway
[2:19:59] because guess what you're only going to
[2:20:01] disappoint yourself
[2:20:03] because the ones that's going to enjoy
[2:20:05] it is going to keep on enjoying it and
[2:20:06] the ones that doesn't like it will not
[2:20:08] like it and then once that god says i'm
[2:20:10] yeah and they want to backslide they'll
[2:20:11] backslide and the ones that walks away
[2:20:13] will walk away and the ones that praise
[2:20:15] him will praise him and the brother
[2:20:17] andy's that want to jump or jump and the
[2:20:18] alphas that's very loud and scream and
[2:20:20] shout will shout because we will still
[2:20:22] go on
[2:20:24] but the thing is and and bro and i want
[2:20:26] to say it brother ron spins is seated
[2:20:28] you get guys that train for gold medal
[2:20:31] yeah yeah all of us want to olympic gold
[2:20:33] medal in it
[2:20:35] but who gets it

[2:20:39] the one that trains
[2:20:41] that eats that's disciplined that wanted
[2:20:44] more like the guy next to him they're
[2:20:45] standing at the 100 meters and all he's

[2:20:49] breakfast i'm gonna win i will cross
[2:20:51] that line first i will not lose
[2:20:53] that's the one that wants it who gets
[2:20:55] the tries in the matches
[2:20:58] huh the one where he's got a big prop in
[2:21:00] front of him and he goes no
[2:21:02] or just runs around him with scores to
[2:21:03] try he wants it more than the other guy
[2:21:06] that's the rule that's how it works in
[2:21:08] the world if you want to have first
[2:21:10] place you have to get
[2:21:12] that's it there's no losers i i ran
[2:21:15] against brother ben and all the brothers
[2:21:16] and i thought man that guy had the right
[2:21:18] attitude because all he said when he
[2:21:20] showed up he's got i'm going to beat
[2:21:21] brother armand and guess what he beat me
[2:21:24] come on babe is that true
[2:21:26] he beat me
[2:21:28] because the challenge was said that i'm
[2:21:29] sure i'm faster than him and he goes nah
[2:21:32] i'm gonna win
[2:21:33] and what happened
[2:21:36] i wasn't ready that man was born for it
[2:21:39] and he ran like i meant it like a
[2:21:41] mongoose i don't know it's just he just
[2:21:43] went i thought man that guy's fast you
[2:21:45] know and you it's bad as when you're in
[2:21:47] a race and you look at the guy in front
[2:21:49] of you and you're going he's going
[2:21:50] faster and far oh no don't be that guy
[2:21:54] don't be that guy
[2:21:56] sucks to lose losing is for losers we're
[2:21:58] winners we're different we're a
[2:22:01] different cut we've got a different
[2:22:02] attitude
[2:22:04] now
[2:22:04] here's the kick
[2:22:06] everybody wants to get to heaven who's
[2:22:08] going to make it to heaven
[2:22:11] there's only two monkeys
[2:22:12] in the ark
[2:22:14] who's going to be the who's going to be
[2:22:15] the two monkeys because three can't go
[2:22:17] in
