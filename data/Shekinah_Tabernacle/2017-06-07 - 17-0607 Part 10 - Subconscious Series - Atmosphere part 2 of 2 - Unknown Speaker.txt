TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want you to imagine now because imagining is not always a bad thing it's good to imagine but just don't imagine bad things imagine good things has been I've been preset a few weeks ago imagine good things imagine God start pondering over how great it's going to be and and ponder over what you know the things that God's going to do in your life you know and as you see him dealing with something and imagine what it's going to be like when you're free from that complex when you're free from that whatever troubling you you know when you're free from the trial that you're going through imagine the fellowship as you become more and more like Christ as you grow in as Grace now let's imagine that you never leave the secret place that you never leave that place that Shekinah and it content and this God never leaves you right but what I'm talking about now as a place where you're invincible all the time there is nothing that will ever happen that whatever you say will happen now we're in a transitional phase so you can understand that it's not easy to try and bring these thoughts because yes we are you can you can be governed by your experiences and what you see and what you expend what you feel and what the history of of when you did this that happen cause and effect you can be governed by that or you can allow yourself to start imagining and start thinking on and start believing that we are actually transitioning into another higher realm into a realm of perfect faith and we will end them as God now deals with all the complexes and deals with all the fears there's little things in your life that you don't even know there that are causing you to fear about stuff that was sowed when you were 2 years old when you were 6 when you were 4 when you were 19 whatever little things little tears they're all gone they're all on their way out all of them one by one because you see those are the things and those are the tools the devil uses to take you out of the secret place by fear fear cripples faith so the moment he can get you scared of something it cripples your faith in your gift can't operate any more properly you'll end up operating your gift and it might be a bit shaky it might sound good it might look good but it doesn't have the ring because you're out of that Shekinah buy some complex you see now that's why the whole series down on the complex is and all those thing to read to enlighten the processes that it's happening right now you know we talked about the title deed and how he's searching it right back to under all the things and search you back to your purity and your your eternal state in your theophany you know and we talked about deep things there but we've gone through it so that's all good hallelujah carry on so here we have now actually let me just blank net for a see that's the I was continuing some ninety-one there because basically some ninety-one says he that dwells in the secret place of musashi arrest under the shadow almighty and then all the way list out everything that happens when you do actually stay there and that is exactly perfect faith that's exactly a son manifested that's exactly what it is Alleluia but I want to talk about just verses just quickly now just to establish the store that you have in the world today two atmospheres there's many variants and derivatives of those two atmospheres but is too and prophetically speaking if we want to place it in Scripture you've got and we've heard preaching on this for years you've got the revelation chapter nine and you've got that hell coming up and spewing out on the earth and influencing and Hollywood and all that stuff and then you've got then God actually raised the standard against them a direct combat for that revelation chapter ten here comes the mighty angel down with his atmosphere Amen so now as a believer and even as the unbelievers everybody has a choice now what atmosphere they're going to allow to their life amen I'll just put that there and I ask you this question is before we go who I'm not looking at you as individuals I'm just looking but who will be your atmosphere who you've got to make that choice it doesn't matter how what age you are young people who will be your atmosphere there's two and I asked you that question because that's what's going to really affect you and and really ask yourself that constantly all day where does this come from what's the Sun doing now judge yourself that you be not judged walk circumspectly because the days are evil be wise in your walk and and discern what you're doing and what you're allowing into your life because everything carries a spirit and will bring an atmosphere hallelujah yep some 91 verse 3 says for he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunters from every troublesome matter now we read over this and we think wow that's so nice but let's just stop a little minute and let's look carefully because this here is a vision that you know sometimes we don't actually experience and there's reasons why we don't experience it and its fullness and one is because it wasn't the age for it and 2 that on an actual level and a personal level is we come and we walk cuddle sometimes we get carnal we allow things to come into our lives that bring us into a carnal state and therefore we leaving and all the effects of being able to walk and remain in the secret place we don't actually we're not able to share it all of those things until their fulness because our mind is alive our will is starting to say things and do things and want things and the lust of the flesh starts coming in and we want to do this and we make these decisions and all of that because you see you leave that place but when you're in that place whose will is King his will remains and you were in when you're in that place if there is a reference like no other place amen who knows what there's like you know when you're in the Shekinah glory of God and and my and you're walking you have those days and it's just like wow and whatever he says you do you know and you'll just you'll deal with him now I'm telling you now this is a reality that we will remain in this place we will walk in this place we will talk in this place we will fellowship in this place completely we're going to come to there and we are coming to that and it's ours for now now we're transitioning we're crossing the sound barrier of from going into little faith people to perfect faith people this is our heritance this is the day this is the time this is the hour it's not just a pretty sermon anymore or an ideology or some nice thing that preachers say welcome to the time and age of perfect faith and I really feel anointed to say that that we are right here on the brink of where this transition is taking place and so you see I preached this vision with all my heart Alleluia some 91 verse 5 and we're not just reading all the Sun I'm just going to paraphrase a little bit here just a few verses that I select it out so some 91 verse 5 says thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day so now you don't ever have to be afraid again you don't ever have to fear again and when you're in this place you will never fear because perfect love casts out all fear hallelujah so when you're in this place now you can just you can discern your own life if you're here or not if you're walking in the secret place and you can discern if you're only in the secret place in your prayer room and that's fine you know I'm sure the Lord has he's bringing us right ease we're growing we're becoming more like them and we're going up into the image and the ministry is ministering an entrance okay the Bible says that an entrance shall be ministered unto you and into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior now you can discern whether you are always in this place and or whether it's just your prayer room and sometimes at church and whatever we're where that were you just completely free and nothing fazes you and you can just be you're right there and you're there now you'll never be afraid you won't be afraid for any arrows or any warfare or anything you'll never worry you live you'll have a perfect faith in the Word of God a reference you have no lust no desire for certain covetousness none of that can be in that place and I just read that up again he shall deliver thee from every troublesome matter some 91 verse 6 nor of the evil thing that walks in darkness nor of calamity and the evil spirit at noonday some 91 verse seven a Thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand it shall not come nigh thee brother Branham said when the church recognizes who she is she will be invincible army which she can discern the Antichrist spirit and her myths and he can stop pulling her out of that atmosphere and bringing her into a carnal state fighting each other and looking at that person in that person all the time she'll be an invincible army when she can discern it and come on top of that and when he comes you can just say hey I can see what you're doing there get out of me you know get away dip now it doesn't that's just spiritual in the spiritual warfare but there is a realm that we're going into and we're moving into now we're physical things won't even affect you now that sounds a bit radical but it's true the Prophet actually brings it out very clearly and it's all an example in the Bible as well we're men like Paul could physically be unaffected by their physical surroundings by an atmosphere that they remained in by a by staying in that place with God we're not even physical circumstances would affect them oh go back I love this is one I've always just claimed for me and you know claim the war for me but this one really stuck out for me years ago this is there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling now who bets that says it I'm not going to argue the word the word says that no sickness no plague is going to come near your house right amen I'll leave it there but you see this is the vision this is the truth this is what we're coming to this is the reality now are you going to just are you going to claim that is that yours are you going to own that and say that's my now I want it that's my inheritance I don't have to have any sickness in my home now don't get condemned when you get sickness in your home because we I get sickness in my home too but you see I don't regardless of what the circumstances is I'm still going to hold to that no plague regardless of what happening I'm not going to let that deter me and make me upset and make me flustered no no way because if you keep doing that then women back to the subconscious again you're training the people downstairs to accept plagues and then Varian you just fighting your own you're fighting against yourself now but if you always have a what does it like a stalwart stance against it and who cares if it happens no I still claim that this is mine no plague and even when it's happening and there's a sickness in my home Oh cold in my own body and I hate it I say no place will come not my dwelling Satan get out of here get out of here this is not your place and so you see now on a personal level I'm sending messages down to the crew that runs the ship we never given Amen we always stand for the word regardless of circumstances nothing's going to move me as Paul said some 9111 for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways amen so you're perfectly protected perfectly kept and perfect love perfect peace and perfect faith when you're in the secret place you can see now why the devil Dean's are very important to pull you out of it and make you mad at each other and fight each other and do whatever he can try and do but UCS here yeah we're so blessed you know let's keep this what we have bye let's keep birds endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace conduct yourself humbly with love and make an extra effort with love to show love and to be humble about it amen it's very important their outward conduct the Bible visits that quite clearly you know Paul talks about with all ol eNOS and meekness because we're humans and we have annoying things about us that can annoy other humans on a human level so let's just you know and so there there's reasons for that we don't want to give the devil any ground to work on amen and they had a breakfast with about 600 ministers met together and they put a big German camera there and the Holy Ghost and that same pillar of fire came down and was took on the German camera three times that morning and swept through the atmosphere changed sorry is something missing hear that right that's right worst wished I'd have thought and brought it with me was in a Christian businessman this month or a couple months ago rather what is it its atmosphere men and woman should live under that atmosphere don't get out from under some normal world existing influence he's that sounds he's actually saying don't get under it stop getting under a worldly influence stop filling your mind or so much worldly affairs all the time because it's going to put give you and it's going to create an atmosphere as much as we can reason that with all sorts of reasons the devil gives reasons don't get out of that godly atmosphere staying it all your life remain in it it's too late in the day to come out of that atmosphere too late in the day you don't have to come out of that atmosphere anymore yes you're transitioning it out until you all your fears and stuff a gamma because trials and things you know you fail and you go through trials and so you come out sometimes but eventually you won't actually you're going to abide lujah eventually and I believe we're out in that season now as you know what God is doing that's why with all my heart I say apply the word apply what you've heard don't just sit and listen and enjoy the sermons act upon them do them let it become your life hallelujah let it become you but stay under the atmosphere of the Lord Jesus I'm going to listen to what Malachi 4 see is here I'm going to I with all my heart you know and it's not as easy as it sounds but I'm going to say it anyway stay under the atmosphere of Jesus Christ remain under that atmosphere abide under the shadow of the Almighty dwell in the secret place of the Most High because the things that we just read is your portion hallelujah amen what we need is a Holy Ghost atmosphere that's right an atmosphere where the power of gods are moving one Accord one place gather together under that atmosphere of expectant so there is an atmosphere of expectation when you have an expectation when you come in don't think it's vain the devil's going to pour a thought into you is just pain it's just going to be just like any other service you've just done this you've been through this look what you said to your husband or your wife on the way to church you just put that under the blood and say sorry as fast as you can and then you you sit there and you say we're going to have a good service today amen and you believe that and you have an expectation that expectation brother bonuses is an atmosphere in itself that's creating an atmosphere he's got the atmosphere of expecting God to move down and through signs and wonders amen who sits in here when the morning is an expects God to do signs and wonders Amen expected Alleluia expected wanted I want that you know and because that's where we're the more omnipotence comes the miraculous takes place amen and you'll see transformations conversions healings restorations and all of that hallelujah your dreams will come true amen hallelujah if your dreams are godly hallelujah what you think on and what you say and what you do creates an atmosphere Amen so he says here let's move ourselves up into that bracket step up in faith move out of these three dimensions up into the next one if we've been told to do that that means we can it's not a carrot front you can't actually get to you can attain to it because you already have it it's your inheritance and he's giving it to you hallelujah so I encourage you you know and I'm sure we're hear it many times have an expectation because it's creating an atmosphere and it's not a man Alleluia amen this continues on this is say Lord I just believe that you're going to pour your blessings I'm expecting it now all things are moving right in and I'm expecting to see the exceedingly abundantly now I'm expecting it and when you go you come down and say well I don't know about it well see you hurt the other person maybe you're affecting people now you're sitting what by one of them and you say oh Lord now he's meaning this in a good way just tear them down now you know this is older language you know they probably mean like you know just like get a hold of that person bless them amen and if it's someone that's annoying to you Lord bless them Oh meet them today hallelujah amen you know it says bless those that persecute you and you know and someone you know maybe they're not persecuting you but maybe there's a trait and their character knowings you just bless them pray for them combat the enemy because he'll be sitting there and he'll be firing thoughts into your mind in the service about that person to try and destroy the atmosphere to distract you from expecting God to move so instead of just dwelling on that as soon as the thought comes and the feeling comes over you angst about that person you start praying or god bless that person bless them pouring a spirit on them amen you see what happens they don't change the atmosphere hallelujah and when you go you come and it says and I'm expecting great things just tear them down I'm expecting great things see and that expectancy will get that unity among the people you see visit do you think the devil just leaves us alone when we come to church when we're sitting here and we're waiting for the service to start he's busy he's busy and he's trying to get the church and a chick stalemate spiritual stalemate thoughts here and thoughts here and this that and the other and lunch he's trying his best this is a warfare you're stepping into a battle zone now you can sit the old God come down today I want to see your glory amen hallelujah amen praying for this one and that one and the burdens on your heart just praying you know that's not in vain it'll actually you want to be distracted by God amen that's he's a gentleman he ain't going to just come and force his way around like the enemy does so you have to make a decision to be distracted by God you're actually taking the good things of God and the things of the world and praying an expectation for God to move Alleluia these are common inhibitors to a good atmosphere as fear as we've already gone through complaining god help me covetousness pride you know I'm just listening my troubles here I don't know about you but negative thoughts and testimony and then this one here natural worldly influence you pour stuff in that's from the this world and it and it creates an atmosphere in your life and that atmosphere makes you not want to read the Bible makes you not want to pray it makes you not you know you might do it but you don't want to do it you'll do it because you know it's right and you know it's going to help you and you want to get out of the condition you're in but you don't feel like it and the reason is is because this thing's going in there's over worldly influence now too so powerful your thoughts are I think I've actually already mentioned this way down in the series and it says then you take a man sitting here this morning that's not a bit sick and let him begin to get his heart believing he is sick they'll Peck him out of the building it's pretty severe that your thoughts can actually determine your physical health you as your faith is so be it unto you that's not Christian science I'm not meaning might never matter but you see the thing of it is it's the atmosphere that you live in this is the sort of quote that you that brother Kai Dre would probably preach but I love it it's so good and I'm not going to do what he does but you know on it just you just pretend it brother kai Dre's here when I read this okay but it's the attitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason at Pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came because they got in one place and won a call and we just talked about that the expectation having that desire for God to move amen and fight the distractions away because they will come and they're going to try and keep us in a natural place in a natural state they will come don't don't don't don't be ignorant of the enemy's devices now yes you see that's why we've been told to have an expectation and to pray and to read the Bible because it's getting your mind on Christ Alleluia preparing for the worship and the word to come forth so he says here because they got in one place and one Accord it's the atmosphere what brings the results you believe that let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl your young children you can too you're not too young amen hallelujah get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus and believe that he's standing present right now and you'll see something happening that will cause headlines and newspaper in the morning hallelujah that's right its atmosphere hallelujah amen it's quite a powerful fall that's a powerful thought amen he's not just saying that it's not just a pretty word this is the Prophet speaking and he's declaring this is what can happen you see do you think that in the Jerusalem news the day after the panic of the day of Pentecost there was probably a news headline that drunk people came out of an upper room Amen hallelujah and they told the streets apart and three thousand people were getting dunked in water there was probably news about it hallelujah amen and so the prophets now saying you know like you know they're so marvelous and we've experienced that we were all in one Accord and gods are moving and we're having a glorious time hallelujah and in his freedom and liberty in the spirit to to pray through four things in to see the miraculous take place to see people get born again hallelujah and if people come in this is what we really need and want is when these people come in and God comes down they can just go man oh my who are these people where did they come from hallelujah amen glory to God amen that makes me very happy to think that such a simple thing it's not complicated it's just practical stuff and we've heard preaching on it before but you see I don't know why but you know that we just don't do it sometimes sit there and you stew on things and you start planning out your week right God have mercy on us Amen Alleluia you see we're not doing it deliberately see it's not we that's really doing it the devil's reminding your memory remember a memory memory memory memory memory affections affections affections imaginations all those things he's firing them at you because he doesn't want the staff he doesn't want headlines in the Stokes Valley times hallelujah people came pouring out of the church amen all these people started getting saved Alleluia amen start imagining good things amen hallelujah glory to God isn't he wonderful Alleluia listen I'm going to say something look faith is unconscious amen you believe it now I've learned that in the years of travel around the world the meeting the peoples of all different walks but faith is unconscious you got faith and don't even know that's right you have faith you might not even know hiding down there somewhere but you've got it amen you hold that and you say I have faith you testify I've got faith I have it and you don't prophecies here you've got faith and don't even know it so you might not be able to figure it all out don't try and figure it out it was given to you it's given to you amen I think later on we'll talk about don't question it either never question your faith that's why I put there unconscious unquestionable faith you can that could be a sermon in itself unconscious unquestionable faith actually that would be a very good sign amen hallelujah but faith is unconscious you got faith and don't even know it that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and the gale is knocking at the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in a face admitted demons he was if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and quiet as could be why because he was the secret place one thing but he was in the secret place it was in that atmosphere he didn't let circumstances because he didn't have complexes he didn't have fears he wasn't scared of anything he knew who he was he believed to what the word said about him the word said I'm listen I believe it hey man he believed that all and therefore nothing could move him nothing could deter him from walking in the vision that the Lord the father had revealed and the word he his life was the scripture revealed and was walking in writing scripture at the same time he stayed in that path its simplicity stay there and walked with all the demons of Hell and everything try to change it the devil offered him all those things and all the Pharisees and all that stuff trying to make him angry because you can imagine how frustrated now there was times where it was actually the will of the father to get angry too but it had to be in the right place and it had to be according to the vision right amen so there is time don't get condemn sometimes you might have a bit of indignation about something so not don't let the Sun go down upon it because you don't want to sleep on an angry spirit you want to sleep angry because it'll start soaking in and make you a more of an angry person because it's it's you you this sounds a bit medical but you're actually when you go to sleep you're transcending from conscious state into unconscious and so if you take that spirit not spirit but that emotion of anger and frustration at something and you sleep on it you're actually taking that into your subconscious and it's stewing around and your dreams and you might end up having all sorts of dreams you know so there's a reason why and that's just me that's what I think right as the reason why is don't let it Sun go down upon it make it right or get get back in the right atmosphere you know stop being angry when you when you go to sleep it's not good you have a fight and then go to sleep that's not good make it right before you go to sleep amen I like that just as calm and quiet as could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him now he saw it he saw it but he had the maturity he knew the driving force of his life the centerpiece of his life the thrust the the dynamic the will the vision the other stuff that was trying to strike there wasn't the vision it wasn't what he's meant to be doing it wasn't the the motive and the objective of his actions but the father was is but you see now few for us right now if somebody has been not that right and they're unconscious you can yell at them call them names and do whatever you want to they ain't going to do nothing you're unconscious of it you know be just as pious as you can be because you know there's no reaction no consciousness to reason adding it or man or whatever goes on you see now that's one thing but to be awake and to have it and to be experiencing that and to be reasoning at all and all your memories and all of the things that's going on how will you react are you going to choose to be unconscious to those things and not let them affect you and sway you and move you and influence you that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh have I prayed through wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this he just walk right on unconscious amen that's right he believed what God said was truth the words must be fulfilled and he knowed what his life was to fulfill them that's right it's a vision had confidence with God real confidence with God and he knew his calling and he made his calling an election sure amen with all diligence amen he knew his gifting he knew what he who he was and you came to all of you at weight young people don't wait don't now find your purpose God will show you if you get serious ask and you're here to fulfill it and you're here to fulfill it to just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism will come conscious unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with Him not paying any attention the right or the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church what with God hallelujah if sickness strikes you what was God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on walking with God in that secret place hallelujah don't eat the circumstances that pull you down out of the atmosphere and make you angry and mad and sad and gladden whatever those emotions walk with God walk with God the whole time this is what he's want that he's calling us to this he's calling us come away with me come out of these worldly atmospheres now and what was me he's saying walk about those things you've been invited you've been gone your hearts been drawn out to him amen the Song of Solomon is singing to you saying come away my fear one walk in the garden with me again amen walk hand-in-hand with me we're going to walk into the millennium amen like keep on walking with God if sickness strikes you what was God if the neighbor don't like you and he doesn't like my neighbor doesn't like me for some reason I don't know why what would God just keep on walking with God Enoch one day walk like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God hallelujah praise His Holy Name Amen these things aren't just pretty sayings man these are reality he's saying this because this is the vision for us you walk with God one day we're going to walk home amen Oh excites me Alleluia God's graces to change our thinking Sarah she had a trouble for so long doubting the word that did God leave her that way no he visited her and he did the discernment of spirit and he discerned her heart and and she doubted and then something changed and he visited her and he changed her thinking so that she could conceive and bring forth the promised son so God if your mind as God will change it God will come in and he will do something for you he can do that thing for you now he can do it for you tonight if you're finding than your mind that things are you're not believing properly God can come and visit you this is your type of visitation God can visit you now hallelujah save Oh Henner she struggled she got ridiculed beau pnina and her sister and you know 60 years she had no baby and it's a very reproachful thing in those days then I have a baby you know people think that you're being judged and all sorts of stuff you have been done something wrong and probably many people did but God was reserving time for Hannah but you see she got into an atmosphere one day hallelujah amen where where she met the high priest him in and he gave her an edict amen hallelujah he spoke a word over her and she believed it and she brought forth a life amen and you see for you hallelujah God can change your mind and he can let you live in an atmosphere where you can impart eternal life because that's exactly what God wants you to do see for you life comes by the man but through the war by the man Christ Jesus and through the church life Alleluia but an atmosphere where that life can come more hallelujah amen let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Alleluia let it Amen when God spoke this is now this is my writing so I'm just writers wrote this because I just thought of we could just say it like this when God spoke he believed what he it has faith mastered the circumstance of an earth without form and void he had he had a case on his hands he brooded over the earth and it was dark but he spoke and he believed it and he mastered the circumstance the circumstance was darkness and chaos and void and he mastered the circumstance he believed what he said we are God's family under his covenant to come back to this position in the season for full restoration is it too hard to believe that you are coming to this place of perfect faith where nothing physical audible or spiritual can sway or affect you not if it affect you in a negative way in any way is that too hard to believe as that as that impossible yes it's impossible but with God all things are possible amen and if you're in the atmosphere of God walking with God like Enoch then all these things are possible and actually there are inheritance and there are portion and there for us and we're going and we're moving into this this is for us so now as we transition we've got to shift our thinking now and we and we have to have a balance because there's also a balance to this and the balance that gets more and more harder to strike that balance because as you transition eventually we'll just say things and people will all know it's true and people will just think we're absolutely crazy and they probably already do now many people but what we believe in what we say now which way will you lean in your thinking you can reason things away very easily because we are not completely there in that full transition yet just because we may not be experiencing this in its complete stage yet it does not mean that we should explain it away we shouldn't just explain it away and reason to say yes okay I'd better go take my medicine right there's a bell to that we don't just want to tell people to get off their medicine of course because God has to tell someone to do things like their Amen or a prophet see something like that then you can do it but any man just come over in his own enthusiasm and say that then they're stepping on bad ground but you see you've got to be a balance to this but I'm just going to say this but this is a reality now we should not explain it away this is a vision and we master the circumstance of our poorly trained crew the subconscious you see that man that that's without form and void you know when we first become a Christian and there's a lot of poorly trained things and so God over the years and the songs and the testimonies and those preaching and the trials and the hardship and does all then he starts to brood over it so that it starts to become more sound and you can start being the real you amen hallelujah and training it so that it can actually believe hallelujah we will soon see this internal harmony conduit that means to flow the secret place of the Most High and the rest of Psalm 91 will manifest but you see what I mean by that as some 91 says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall rest under the shadow of the Almighty and nothing shall befall you no place you'll come nigh thy dwelling you know all of those things no fear you'll never be afraid your identity is sure and all those things will be perfectly killed not and it will come from within you not just from an external miracle to help you but it will come from within you it'll it'll be your experience naturally spiritually and soulfully in all areas of your life Psalm 91 will manifest and the sons of God will be revealed and seeing and you'll experience in your sea uttermost completely so we should not explain the radical away what seems to be radical where we can completely trust and rely on God and not nothing on the natural and and and I'm preaching this rahmanir I'm going for to the extreme right on this and I'll show you later this is the we're still rule just say this to show people that there is no need of being scared the worst thing that people can put up on you is fear if you even had a cancer and didn't fear and believe God would heal you you wouldn't be into bad a shape God take care of that if you were sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place upon the person now this week I've tried to prove by the scripture that the man that's born again of the kingdom of God has nothing to fear you're absolutely safe and secure in Jesus Christ so this overcoming atmospheres Psalm 91 6 this is not Psalm 91 6 but this is actually the promise of some ninety one six and you can read that later but I'm just going to read what happened here it says well one day Paul the Lord told Paul he had to go down and appear before Caesar and got shipwrecked out there and then I'm just cutting a bit of the story out and going straight to this it says so when they got on the shore there was a big storm been on there and the rain cold paul was picking up some sticks and thrown some of the fire and a big dangerous snake grabbed him right through the hand why it never scared Paul you see remember faith says that even if a snake bites you that nothing not even the venom of a snake can hurt you Paul believed that Paul was living in a vision Paul knew his test as his calling in you a god and to do he knew that him dying right there on an island was not part of his ministry not part of his the plan he was in that he was so in tune and in the secret place with God that he knew where he was going because he had angelic visitations he was he was he heard the voice of God he was led by the spirit and he knew where he was gone now if he wasn't in that secret place if he was leading carnal things come in if he was listening to the Roman entertainment of that day do you think he would have had NZ Angelica visitations you think that he would have heard the voice of God do you think he would have known the vision for his life no he probably would not open I'm just assuming that but I believe that he would not have heard those things if he had that atmosphere in his life but because he carried the right atmosphere and he lived and walked in that secret place he could know the vision for his life hallelujah and so when a snake came and bit him and it was a deadly snake he said what are you doing snake get off me hallelujah because he knew he meant that there was promises in the Bible to sort that out hallelujah so he was embodiment of some ninety one hallelujah he embodied some ninety one he dwelled on the secret place of the Most High and he was not hurt by the Beast or whatever it says in Psalm 91 verse six maybe what so you can see the balance Amen the balance they are knowing the vision knowing what God has got for you knowing that these things and walking in a place with God where those things the promises of God the supernatural as reality to you so that you don't fear because the moment you start getting scared and fearful your faith is crippled and whatever their thing is affecting you will come upon you and hurt you and now this brother band eventually takes it a step further and we'll go into it in a minute it's quite interesting and Paul this is why I never scared Paul he looked at it like that and so full of the Holy Ghost his whole inner body just charged was the power of God he looked at it and shook it off in the fire and said I've got to go before Caesar what are you bothering me about like that and went walking on amen it didn't bother him didn't scare him a bit you see Paul was not deterred by the physical see they're physical so you know we've talked about and it and it seems to be easier in our mind to not be deterred by the spiritual demon influences and all that stuff right and fight that off but the same face that fights that offers the same faith that will fight a snake bite off will fight anything off and will give you and will allow you to walk and Psalm 91 some 91 verse 3 Peter walking on the water he was walking all right till he seen the waves contrary and he got scared jesus said why did you fear that's what's the matter with the Holy Ghost people today they've got a lot of afraid the devil's just trying to scare you out of something he's trying to put something off somewhere else say some of these days you'll be this now this is what I'm bringing to you tonight you know we we have to own it now you know and then as I said before don't let the circumstances you make you let you reason it away it is now even if the circumstances don't just become conscious of them be unconscious of the circumstances now because what's going to happen is as the Lord unfolds and as the rapture gets closer as the grace becomes stronger and as the Lord descends further and it becomes more fleshed out in you your testimony will make a big difference so your muzzle start it now and testify now and hold the ground now and stand your ground now don't waver as much as it feels like wavering and it's reasonable to waver don't waver cast down reasonings Allu you since here he's The Devil's trying to put something off of somewhere else to say some of these days you'll be this you are now you are now now now now now now now we're the sons of God now we're seated together in heavenly places now we get this we have all powers in heaven and the earth see now we have it not in the Millennium we won't need it then we got it now believe it receive it what can it never testify anything different never think anything different and if any thought ever comes or any inclination to speak anything else ever come never ever allow it cast it down even if the physical circumstances and sicknesses and things in life testify different reject it because that's not your inheritance and very soon my friend there won't be your experience if you stand now hold your ground now be strong and very courageous I think it's like I might not go through these but I ask you the question which way will you lean these three and the categories of my brain right now well what I'm talking about natural tendencies will you lean to the natural or your thoughts and testimony be affected completely by natural events well natural calamity cause you to doubt the Word of God because do you remember what the word said no plank no plane well negative natural events make you fear and worry about your family's future in your own do you turn to the arm of the flesh and calamity but because it's too serious to trust God I ask those Christians you know I'm not going to answer them but just ask him now here is the tendencies of little faith now this is put this gets a bit more closer to home will you stay where many Christians are and a thought I couldn't think of a word but frequency of little faith where you do believe but yet because of fear and reasoning you are still affected by natural circumstances and you double-minded about complete ability for your faith to master every circumstance even the natural circumstances in your life natural things that can happen mistakes and we'll talk about in brother will read a quote soon even the burn of effect on a pen now this one here really like you know it's pretty extreme but we'll just have a look at it and I'll leave you to decide which way you will lean because you know as brother branham friction the jury see you're the jury you make the decision and I'll leave it with you how and when does your little faith become perfect faith and these are questions to ask you because you need to consider that it's something you need in this time of transition an entire way of God's provision and grace is coming upon the church to take her out of this realm to bring her into rapture and grace and rapturing faith and it remember this it's none of it as your own works none of it as your own ability it's all the grace of God it's all the power of God and the power of God he comes and he brings the word and then the power of God when you mix it with faith and you embody and you say Lord yes that's me I want then I'm going to claim it and all those words and all the testimonies and all the confessions that we spoke about on the following the preceding serving it's all by faith none of it's by oh I just confess and it's a work that I do and it's going to change something that's faith it's faith in the power of God that's contained in the Word of God amen which way will you lean other answer is here this is the quote now you know that's the atmosphere you've got to get away from it he's talking about a negative atmosphere you've got to get away from it this is just after he shared about hope and I'm sorry Peter and she had been all flustered and the family had been having troubles and he came in there and he got by the Holy Spirit changed the atmosphere in the house and then he said here after that it's the atmosphere you've got to get away from it that Colonel flustered atmosphere from that old confusion we've got to get away from the old confusion that old reasoning and confusion and complex you know it's complicated faith because really in perfect faith that's very simple it's only the Word of God always and there's no reasoning there's no anything else and really when it comes to its full manifestation even our circumstances will be perfectly everything that we do everything we experience perfect faith all the time and my burden for this to close this series of things is that we stay in an atmosphere and the way we stand atmosphere not that we we can't work ourselves to stand there but God's dealing in our lives to remove fears and frustrations and complex and all those things so that nothing can affect us because we will walk like Enoch we will walk that way and we are walking that way and we're walking into the vision we're in the vision we're transitioning hallelujah so we need to move away from that old confusion I am oh I am going to beat your you're scared he says that well that's what's the matter you'll be frying your meat of a morning for breakfast and the first thing you know you're filled with the Holy Spirit now I'm going to shock you a little bit so you kind of say something that's very extreme especially in those days you don't mind do you all right for instance that meats are frying and all at once the grease pops out on your head now if you'll just shake it off and go on frying meat it wouldn't bother you what's the difference between that and a snake bite venom if your faith can stop venom from killing you which is designed to do then cut your faith also stop grease from burning you you know what I mean so yes it sounds extreme because it's not really you know you just get a little sore and you know that's up goes away but that he's trying to show you something here that something about an atmosphere when you're walking in that place that even a little thing like that doesn't have to affect you it doesn't have to as a challenge now if you now I know you just didn't get that just right look the first thing Oh where's the urgent een I think there must be like some sort of burn remedy something you see grabbed your hand see all it scared you to death that's what does it it's fear because fear cripples faith which way will you lean these are the tendencies of perfect faith will you start to act and think on the frequency of this vision to come to perfect faith where no natural circumstance can affect you whether it's physical or spiritual are you willing to take the challenges that God places before you where he can bring out perfect faith in your life now those might not be easy and they're not easy they're not you'll go through many things to get rid of all of the stuff in your life thank God amen more precious than gold are you willing to be considered strange for the sake of living by faith Jesus is considered a mystic even as disciples didn't even understand rather than natural vision accepting that we are destined to walk on water to master every natural law to where it is completely impossible to explain and to walk completely unconscious of every opposing force seeing the Word of God sweep through all natural reasoning making something out of nothing this is what we believe Saints we believe something out of nothing that's not possible when you look at it naturally but when you look at it through faith all things are possible Alleluia amen I read that already sweet we've guinea done [Music] because thou has made now this is some ninety one nine to sixteen and this is the promise now that you see some the first half of some ninety one as the as he that dwelleth and he this and he that basically singing out the what will happen right now here I believe that God got excited about the sermon he started speaking directly in first person to you right he says because you have made the Lord which is my refuge even the most higher thy habitation there shall no evil before the Sario it comes down a bit later neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways all thy ways not some but all they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against the stone thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet and here it is sweet God speaking because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high net word on high is a powerful word which we're going to because he has know in my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God musicians please come on step Cygnet play that song like casting cast all your cares on him all he carries let's just play that so God humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you here be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion not a royal own but he tries to be like one walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith that's what I said earlier don't give up even if it's a small thing the small things count the small things count in this battle the little things and those little things really have a big effect when you're resisting the devil steadfast in the faith it may be a daunting thought to be constantly resisting him but it pays off and eventually becomes your normal default you're retraining that crew downstairs resist the devil steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world and this is just an exhortation for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled

execute an office bring you all that strength all that power from God to bring you because in you as an office in you as a calling as a ministry and in the right atmosphere God can the master violinist can pick it up and rustle up the boughs of the word and start striking your heart and causing music to take place and that last thing there to coincide with a prediction as you walk in that secret place your life will coincide with the predictions of the Bible amen best thing that song cast all your cares on him for akhira for you how does it is this isn't amen he is our peace amen God gave you peace so the root he gave you peace it gave it to you not the world can give it only the peace he gave you and then he said now let not your heart be afraid don't allow it you've got Dominion
