amen and amen amen it's Wednesday we made it hallelujah thank you musicians we are so blessed uh here's a little bit of a thought for you you know that shikina Tabernacle was created and placed on this Earth for me do you know that each one of you if you could see it that way that that this church every believer and I'm off on oh okay don't worry every believer in this church every brother every sister even the sound guys and ID thank you ID I won't let no other man touch me like just to let you know guys it's only the sound Tes say thank you brother Ed I I had this thought and I thought you know what that God think about it your job where you now God made that company come to pass to exist on this Earth to give you a job in this time that's how God works every believer here is for your help and for your for your encouragement and for a space of time in your walk with the Lord everything thing is so orchestrated we just don't always see every angle we only see the little bit this way we never see the other ways I used to work for a company and it was a big company and one day a brother said that do you know that that company was created so that you could have a job and that said you can fulfill a purpose here in Wellington so that you can come to shikina Tabernacle and come between all these brothers and sisters and that you would find a place where God wants you to be have you ever thought about it that that it's not just all of us here but all of us was made for Jimmy all of us was made for Ben all of us was made for sister Nomi all of us was made for each other and God took all our South African ways Botswana ways Zimbabwe ways Namibia ways Nigeria ways um come from Korea ways everywhere he he he did something to bring us all back at this time in this place now I tell you God can do Logistics we might not be able to do it but God can do it and the thing is when I look at you I know that there is some value that there is going to come out of you in my life and if you can always see it that way and go Lord these people are going to bring something into my life that's going to help my walk with you how would Church be when we do that amen so that was not my sermon I just felt late to say that let's go to Revelation 4 and we're going to ver read verses 10 and 11 I'll put it up there for those who don't bring their Bibles you should really bring your Bibles now this is not this is my opening test I'm always so nervous standing here so guys please help me today because I think this is a very very um yeah a very sacred spot thank you very much now we read there from verse 10 and seeing the four and 20 Elders fell down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that lived forever and ever and they cast their Thrones Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created may the Lord um just add his Blessing to this word let's just pray Lord Jesus we have opened this word very sacred word Lord which you have sent to us Lord but Lord if you don't show up this is nothing Lord so we ask that you will just add your blessing to this word and may all of us just get some gleanings from this evening that would help us with you Lord and to walk with you Lord I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you may have your seats now I'm going to TI myself because tonight I really don't want to be long as a prayer meeting and I I I just said 25 minutes max if I do go over I don't look at my wife because then usually I'm in trouble this is my my sermon for tonight I think kids this one is for you I put heaps of pictures oh brother B is here God bless you you made it may timing we just prayed for your safe arrival you should have traveled by thought cuz that was fast so I I missed a clicker though I really love that Clicker right merry Christmas we sit in we sit in this time where we have tinsel and all these things and trees and and and all this festive things going on Beyond us and and around us and the world is just caught up in this thing called Christmas but I kind of think they they really don't know What Christmas Means I think they've they've really lost the meaning of Christmas now we know that Jesus Christ wasn't born in December that's fine but we can still celebrate Christmas we have so much more to be thankful for than the the normal guy out there you know they compete who's got oh that's the wrong one whoops there we go they compete who's got the best fireplace with the most stockings on them the biggest tree with the most lights they could fit on them they got they they so obsessed to get this image in their house because it will bring the atmosphere of Christ into their eyes or that's what they think now I don't say Christmas tree is wrong guys before you all well we know that there is people that love Christmas trees and all those things I'm not going to preach against you relax guns down okay I love Christmas I used to wrap my socks and put it under the tree to have more presents than my brother okay just let you know he never knew where I got all the gifts from I had a toy car that got dented 10 times rof is in he never knew it was a car I knew that was wrapped up that was under the tree so I was always always love Christmas it was a fun time and it was a beautiful time because um sister L and I we were talking about it the other time we used to sing uh songs Christmas songs and carols when we were in church even at denomination church we would have Christmas plays and it was all around Christ it was a different atmosphere than what the world made it so Christmas is good because it reminds of of the gift that came for us it it really reminds me as a Christian where I come from you know because and I'm not going to jump ahead but then again they they wrong button again hey let's try that one then they tried to see if the outside could have more lights than the guy next door the poor power grid can't handle all these lights that these guys are putting on they get subsidies to put all these lights on and there's always a purpose behind these lights but it's it's very seldom Christ so they're in the spirit of Christmas but they're not under the spirit of the Lord and I madean it in a nice way they're not under the the holy spirit because they get so obsessed to get these things right in the right time and they have a lot of people carry on but I don't see life's change in fact I see a bigger pressure coming on the people in this time a lot of pressure and and it is sad to see it and then they go and take the best day you could ever celebrate am I breaking oh you got the clicker thank you so much God bless you brother James is it working how does this we try oh is it on yep it's on and I'm going to give it a go go back go back go back forward back forward back okay leave it don't worry so what happens is now they take this dude called Father Christmas and they make him a reality as if our kids would write him spe notes and this guy can come and tell us who who's good and who's bad so now he's the judge and if youve been a really good boy you get a prison well it's very close to the gospel because you the the violent take it by force if you really want more of God there's more of God to give you but it it it doesn't matter if you're a good boy or a bad boy it's the choice you make towards God which brings you a reward you could be the real worst boy you've ever been and you can have a change of heart and God can give you eternal life the biggest gift amen see what this happens is now this is it in in the flesh it says if I'm good enough for long enough I'll get there I'll get my present from Mom and Dad but if I've slipped up once then that's over doesn't that coming to the gospel so I thought let me come and tell you the real story behind Christmas it's not this who's got the biggest threee the most gifts who gets the best discount and the best he and hers gift it's not about that it's it's all wrong if you did buy someone the best gift and you think it's his and her gift praise the lord we all get a reward but this is not what Christmas is about so I thought I'll tell my story of Christmas it became with these guys the Magi now I read this book this little story book that brother brandom Illustrated about the Magi and it touched me so much and I thought maybe I'll just share the story with you tonight it's just a little um Sunday school so just follow me as we go the the attitude towards God word God's word and the visitation of the Angel is the thing that I am most concentrating about this story so we start here with Mary Mary she received the word of the Lord for her day so if you don't know the story children you're going to get the one with pictures I hope you're looking if you're not I might call out your name now you don't have to look here's the scripture for it it says and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou have found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and his name shall be Jesus Hallelujah so she gets this visitation from the Angel and the angel speaks to her and says you know what you're going to have a son but we had a problem here she was a virgin so that means she she's never been with a man so she she can't have a baby it's a bit the logistics behind this is a bit hard but let me explain to you with God nothing is impossible but now Mary had two choices she could accept the word of God because remember she had a fiance James Tiana picture this put yourself in the scene this is not a story this is real life an angel comes to Mary she goes and she says be it unto me I will take the word I'm going to have Christ and then just after that she goes oh what am I going to tell Joseph H uh how do I explain this isn't there sometimes where God sends you a word in season and he says I need you to speak this and receive this word and you look at your partner and you go ah how am I going to how am I going to say this because I had one of those in my life and it came to a point where I had to tell my wife some certain things and God was dealing with me and I had to get to that point where I accept the word of the Lord or I reject it and if I accept it well there's still the other half of that have you ever done such a thing brother Ben we we had a couple of rodeos me and you as well we spoke a lot about it a lot of your testimony and my testimony just go so beautifully together where you get to a point where God makes things it seems for you very hard but this wasn't a hard Choice she didn't know the logistics behind this because remember this was real life this is Jesus Christ going to be born this is a wonderful thing but in the carnal realm in the human realm she's still engaged she has to still go to Joseph and give him the news and would he accept it here you sit with the greatest message of all time and sometimes we can't just go to the guy next to us and give him that but we've accepted it isn't it the same so I'm just saying that in real life she had a a little bit of a I would say a a big battle so there's a fiance and she goes to him and she says Joseph I'm going to be pregnant but I've been with no man man now for Joseph to figure this out would have been an immense thing cuz this is Christmas we're talking about but people make it a story and forget that this was real lives that's happening this is for real life and that these two was in the most epic time in their relationship which was supposed to be the most beautiful time this happens and he's got a choice to accept the word of the Lord coming through a mouthpiece or to reject it because he's saying I've seen an angel and now I'm pregnant and he's going I don't think it's going to happen I don't think it can happen so he's doubting and he did because I'll prove it to you everybody thinks that everything just went good see the the the scriptures said in the book of Isaiah that behold the Virgin shall conceive and she would have given him the scripture and said this is this this is the Fulfillment but he did not believe everybody thinks it was just a very nice story and just believed then Joseph A husband being a just man will not make it public for example was minded to put her away priv so if he believed the word would he have put her away so sometimes we come with something very hard that God gives us to tell someone else and I'm meaning in a nice way and you correct them or you give them that word and they reject it or don't believe it just move on God gave you the word in your season that seed that you receive this message that you have received it will bring forth because God don't work on one side he always works on both sides don't have to worry about it don't figure it out God has got the other side covered you know he's not just going to leave you if he brings you in word and season to fight yourself he'll bring you the other side I have to hurry up don't want to preach so now see God comes in the other side Joseph is sleeping and here the angel comes to him and says Joseph everything that Mary said to you I'm not going to read it verse of verse but these are scriptures you can go read it cuz I I stay in the word he says but I want you to know that she is pregnant and that's the Son of God that's there she was overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and then he gives him instruction and you will call his name Jesus confirming what Mary said now there's no doubt so this is when you get to a place and you want to share the message and you're busy sharing the message and brother Colin goes back to youself I got you man God had me this is the scripture for it and you're like wow because God confirms everything that we do he confirms for us we don't have to worry about it but Christmas there was this event happening but see all the the the logistics that had to happen for Christ to come forth wasn't as easy as we think it is but scriptures were being fulfilled and now because that is now a prophecy and it was confirmed Satan wasn't happy and now Satan wants to put a spanner in the works because we all think a she got pregnant and then and then um and then everything was good and they went to an inn and when they get to the Inn there wasn't place for them they forget a lot of the story that actually went on wasn't that easy then all of a sudden Logistics came into play now we've got um the decree from Caesar Augustus comes that everybody should be taxed and you have to go back to your hometown but they're not very close to Bethlehem and because Joseph is a son of David or in the lineage of David he has to go all the way back to Bethlehem now it's Logistics now they didn't call the ambulance and say hey can you come pick up my wife we need to go to Bethlehem you know so cuz she's pregnant she can't really travel and of course Joseph knew she was pregnant so she would been showing now he's going to put her on the back of a donkey and here they go to Bethlehem and they can't travel at day they have to travel at night because it's too hot that day and she's pregnant and who's ever been pregnant in this place it's very uncomfortable they water like this water wle wle okay and then when they go sit down I love it they're like I'm going to approach the seat I'm going to I'm going to get the seat yeah I got it okay now mention the seat moves like this for kilometers this is going to be uncomfortable has God ever asked you something that made you uncomfortable but they went are we going you see what I mean he might ask you something out of your comfort zone but he still wants you to go and this decree came forth because he wanted them to a place where the scripture could have been fulfilled because God's word in your life will will be fulfilled I hope you follow along it's like a a kind of segue in our lives that this time God might be talking to you and might put you in a very uncomfortable place and it's fine are you willing to go that extra mile amen now while he's doing this might as well dis close this because I feel I don't need that now while he's doing this on the other side in India there's these guys called the Magi they in India they came from Babylon and brother Brandon picks it up and I'll give you some of the scriptures that he says and and they moved up into India now they're in India and God these two um Mary and Joseph they're going now to Bethlehem and at that same time he starts dealing with the the Magi now the Magi to give you a little bit of just background behind that he says as I go back into some of the ancient history such as his L Two Babylons pardon me and the many of the ancient writings to study what was these Magis because I thought maybe someday that brother Armand someday somebody might ask me the question who these Magis are and I find out that these Magis are in India um they were really the me of Persian and they were speaking of the the other night at belto Zar the big rock and roll party where when the mes of Persia took over babylon's Kingdom and they immigrated and got up into India now in India they were called the Untouchable but in Hindu they are the means of Persian and they would they will still have the Arts of the wise men now you find them the Magis were not these type of fellows today that take the stars and tells your fortune so he says it's not fortune tellers these guys they're not normal Guys these these guys are very spiritual he says but they were scientific men who who watched the heavenly bodies and they took a and could look and know every little star that was visible to the human eye and if every little one moved it meant that there was some spiritual significance so these guys on the other side of the world basically knew every Star in there where was the first Bible wrote in the stars stars with a virgin ends with a lion okay so they didn't need a Bible but they knew that there was something changing in the sky and that means something so sometimes if we stay in the word of God and we stay in our Bible when things change around us and it doesn't line up with scripture you know where you are you know a event is taken place and then sometimes brother Ben would be preaching something and he's opening up a word word in our very service and you have it in your word and it's been confirmed because you were staying in your word the whole week and you were listening to the tape and you were eating the the word of God and the confirmation comes over the pulpit and it comes through in in in scripture and in Fellowship what is happening the same event Christ is being birthed in your life it is the same thing that's what Christmas is about God getting personal to all of us so what happened is at about about that time we the association had a meeting and they brother brandom goes I'm going to go over the notes here but brother brandham goes and he says that they had the writings of Daniel because remember Daniel was the the chief magician I always say magician magician in Babylon and he was their Chief and they read his writings and so they were sitting one night and they were looking and one of them came came in and and they um they started opening they said so they they the manuscript was presented for a study night and while they were looking upon this manuscript they fell into these words that Daniel said and beheld I see a stone cut out of the mountain without hands and it and it um and it subdued all the kingdoms of the world and and it raised up because it was great it covered the whole earth and while they were reading this watching up to every Star cuz that's what what they did they saw that stranger appear now he didn't call it a star that that kind of got my attention he never called it a star he said a stranger appeared now we know that brother brandom sees a little bit different than than we saw he saw the pillar of fire and he knew that these Magis and and he brings it out I'll show it to you here they worshiped the one true God by a sacred fire so he knew their makeup he knew that he could trust this man with the job that they need to do in the next couple of years it wasn't days it wasn't weeks it was years it took them to get to Jesus I just want to add this in we we all think they just they saw the star they followed the star they got there and presented their gifts and then they left it was years of travel and I'll I'll show you why he says but I want to just bring this in they worshiped the one and true God by a sacred fire they watched the licking um of the blazes for they knew that the true God dwelt in light and that is true God dwells in light when he was here on Earth manifested in flesh he said I am the light of the world because God was manifested through him so Christ is the light here we've got all the tinsel all the lights all the trees we we sucking the grid dry to get that that light out there yet there's no light but here is light greater than any light out there and he goes on to say and that he that light was the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel and it was that light that struck Paul down on the road to Damascus and it was that light that came into the prison with Peter it's that light that is on the picture and it's that light in my heart and it's that light in this church and when I read that I felt real good and I thought thank God for that light I don't need tinsel I don't need trees I don't need even that Spotlight I just need that light because when I see that light I know where I am and so these PS um um Ms of Persia these wise men they were 4,500 kilm away from Christ 4,500 km I Googled it Google thank than you that's where they were leave hours they had to go through Pakistan Iran Iraq all the way to go through look what they had to cross deserts like this was not hey guys I see a star we're going to get over the hill and this this Babylon this was Logistics and some days we can't even take 30 minutes to get to church I thought shame on me some days it gets too hard to get here but these these guys they wanted to see what is it all about so sometimes we show up here in the we're sitting here in the in the pews and the preacher basically has to call your name to wake you up or get you into the service why don't you show up to see what it's about and leave all that other shenan speack your camel start on the tour when the preacher is preaching just keep pulling you'll find something coming your way and it's that light that Pillar of Fire I'm talking about because that's what Christmas is about it's God moving among us all and in us all it's a wonderful time it's when you just some love everyone you can't be angry at people you still get angry but you you don't you don't stay angry you just forgive them quickly you know and and you remind them that the pron they're going to buy you must be bigger now because you were angry at them no you don't you don't do that but I want you see that these guys they they were going to take this whole tour to get now the to the little baby because they knew that something happened and so they pack the camels and all these three go and they're going to go find Christ but if we stay inside the lines of the word every day and we read our Bibles and we have fellowship with Christ we will know when that light comes into this presence into this building I said to brother Ben and I and I will say it again every Wednesday every Sunday it's not a service it's a event because since since we've come to this place God has placed us all out of our comfort zone true are you comfortable it's all different it's all setups it's all it's not home but it's home it's the same Spirit that's here and then what happens is because the change of scenery you feel a little bit different when you come to church and then you enter in a little bit more and all of a sudden the atmosphere change and then brother Isaac comes with this powerful service about the heart and I'm thinking wow I said Lord check me first because now all of a sudden my my attitude change and I think no matter what the next guy do to me I always remember that heart and I'm thinking man that's an event God telling us that there's more in this place that we'll ever realize we're dealing with hearts in his hand oh that was powerful I thought man Lord may I never hurt the heart that is in your hand I'm about to close I got 35 seconds left oh dear don't look at that couple of minutes um okay here I am and brother Brandon picks this up he says it was an awful Journey now remember this is the birth of Christ but look at all this Logistics around it it's it's ridiculous what's going on and we thinking it's just a little baby in the manger it is events happening from every angle to get to a point where there's going to and I'll show you now I said and they had an awful Journey they GED down over the mountains over the west side followed the Great trious River down till they and I'm have to stop almost down till they crossed the Ford perhaps and down there at the river Euphrates so Jour through the Sahara probably they had to travel by night because it was so hot in the daytime and then again they had to follow that star and it was the only thing shining at night and finally they came into Jerusalem can I can I go on I really want to just I'll I'll stop I'll few Lord stop me when you want me to stop and when they got to Jerusalem they were looking for this they knew he was a Jew so they surely thought that he would be born a celebrity hey so you you you you get into the message brother Colin and you start sharing and everybody looks at you crazy is that right and you think but everybody would accept this message it's so good it's revealing Christ it's it's bringing forth Christ in in the present tense the I am God doing Miracles and they all look at you and go you're crazy you're off your rocket but you know what and surely he was to be a very religious man very clever very intellectual same as all the denominations they always look at this pastor so and so with all these things and see he they were coming with the wrong mindset but God had them he had them but notice when they walked into Jerusalem the star went out so you walk into a I'm going to say it you walk into a denominational church and you go sit down and all you hear is greets dogmas dos and Dons I sat in those places it's like the morg and very sincere people in there but Christ is not in there the star is on the outside because when Christ says come all the way in they just couldn't and I and I and I I really love those people don't get me wrong don't put fences up against these people don't put barriers up don't don't push them out there's more space we can fill these aisles come on that that's that's what the message is for don't you start thinking oh but they believe Creeds and they so wrong and then you made a Creed yourself you just love them and you tell the truth and the honest truth as you heard from what brother brandom taught us and said us the revealed word and you stick with this word and if you cannot find it in the word stay with it and now I just want to get to this part they got to this King a um a horrible King a murderer just a very very bad man brother B uh brother Ben brother brandom says he was a murderer a heartless bloodthirsty Herod he he hated God's people he just he just was a a cruel man and see what happens is sometimes you think you come to a place where you think Christ is and you run into people like this remember this is the event that took place this guy was real this is no joke I try to get the most realest people there this King was alive and he was a horrible man and so what he does is he agrees with you until you stay on the word and they go ha there must be the king of the Jews the three wise men says he's born here he's somewhere here he must be in your kingdom and they very excited and he goes king of king of what another king he go yeah ooh another king yeah oh you believe the message yeah oh very nice very nice but um yeah we we don't really think about this serpent seed and stuff like this but but hey you you believe the message and he tries to kill your influence because that spirit it's not a man it's a spirit and that same Spirit was the one that wanted to kill Moses when the promise came forth it was the same spirit and sometimes when you start dealing with people they take on that spirit and they want to kill the influence and we heard it with brother Ben and brother um Isaac they try to kill the influence it's the same spirit so he says to them go find this young man go find this baby and if you found him come to me because I want to go and I want to pay tribute to him so so give me all the message books give me everything you have but I have no intent of reading them it's the same spirit I had that Spirit once God delivered me from that he had to use my wife to do that and here we go we're almost there but there was a scripture to fulfill in this man's life and that scripture was Jeremiah it says thus sa the Lord a voice was heard in ramar lamentation a bitter weeping Rachel weeping for a children refused comfort for children because they were not and that was speaking about those baby babies that he was going to murder because what happened is he found out that the three wise men lied to him they never returned cuz God warned them in a dream and then he got angry and he started killing twoyear olds cuz he backtracked and he started thinking when did they speak about they started to travel and when did they say they were going there so that's about two years and he goes and he says every child under two years cut it it wasn't a default setting for the for the Kingdom at that time he knew what he was doing he wanted to kill Christ he didn't want the king Satan didn't want Christ to come forth because then all of us was without hope amen and sometimes that same Spirit don't want Christ to come forth in your life he wants to hold you up with these things and this guy that because if he's not real God's not real because everybody at school tells my little four-year-old that Santa is not real and he's telling everybody about Jesus and they telling about he's not real either because if we can see Santa and he's a fat man in a suit all dressed St coming with gifts that parents buy where's Christ it's the same spirit it's killing the influence of Christ in our children's lives that's why be careful when we get into that Spirit of Christmas because it's wrong teach your children Christ because she's sitting there seeing all the kids getting gifts and she's getting excited where's my gift and she's missing the whole point of Christmas and then she goes to the other children and say but Santa is not real you know that and they go yeah we know he's not real and then one day she goes but you know Jesus is real and they go nah he's not real either cuz if I can't see Santa climb through the chimney then I can't see Christ and our children face these battles so your house shouldn't be a house of this your house should be a house of this where where you actually bring your children into to the fear and admonition of Christ where you say this gift that was there there was a purpose for those gifts and these gifts that we give you here is because those Magi that came from there had three gifts very precious valuable gifts one was gold gold representing deity representing the crown of the king so when they when they chose the gifts they were going to give Christ it was going to it's going to Showcase what this king is going to do and each gift had a meaning it wasn't a sensible 25% off get your lawn mower gift it was a purposeful gift that was going to come and back up prophecy so that's where the gifts come in children the gifts meant something today's gifts don't mean anything oh Mommy Daddy loves you these gifts meant something something very very something very special and the frankincense is a perfume that he was crowned the king with a sweet smelling savior that was that perfume that when he when he comes is is the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley it means something it means Christ in my life it doesn't hurt me it gives me that perfume it gives me a a when when you pray you just Lord when his his presence comes it's different things change around you God becomes real because I can see him in the scriptures it's not just a a hazard gift it to me as a Believer it means something sometimes I I walk and there's a certain Tree in New Zealand I don't know which tree it is it's got a sweet smell to it and I walk and sometimes I get this smell and I smell it and it smells so nice I'm say Lord you must be close that's how much this means to me and countless times when I walk past this thing I always try to see what tree it is but you know what the more I walk with God the more I know it's him I don't care what tree gives of what flavor that that smell is a different smell that's my Christ walking with me that's how much this gospel mean that's how real it is don't make it a bunch of stories and fairy tales and the myr was the bitterness it's a herb and it is must he must die for me and you so see when these Magi came 4,500 km away 2 years of traveling all they had to give him is to say that this is more than just a story this is reality and as much as Herod tried to stop it and as much as everybody else was in their way the desert the storm the weather I tell you no matter what is in your way keep pushing on Till You Get to Christ amen don't give up children ever don't let Santa Claus ever become between you and Christ don't let any superhero or any any celebrity or anything any makeup Queen and all those type of things don't let it come between you and Christ there is much more real in Christ that you would ever get in the fake out there that is my heart's desire for Christmas may you see that that when Christ Christ came this baby was born this baby was born with a purpose and the world's trying to strip that away from us and our children and once you come into the presence of the almighty God you change and some days you feel like deity and some days you smell really good and you feel like you're all good and some days it is better but but guess what it is worth every little bit of it amen that's Christmas don't don't miss Christmas guys I'm done brother Bean you can come up brother Bean will take over if we
