[53:59] and he is everyone everyone there
[54:01] everyone feeling good praise the
[54:04] Lord and He lighted upon a certain place
[54:07] this is this is Jacob running and
[54:10] carried there all night because the sun
[54:12] was set and he took off the stones of
[54:14] that place and put them for his pillows
[54:17] and laid down in that place to sleep I'm
[54:19] sorry brother AR you turn me down a it
[54:21] and he dreamed and behold a ladder set
[54:23] up on the earth and the top of it
[54:24] reached to heaven and behold the angel
[54:26] of God ascending and descending on it
[54:29] and behold the Lord stood above it and
[54:31] said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy
[54:34] father and the god of Isaac the land
[54:36] when thou liest to thee will I give it
[54:39] and to thy seed and thy seed shall be of
[54:43] as the dust of the earth and thou shalt
[54:45] spread abroad to the west and to the
[54:47] East and to the north and to the South
[54:49] and in thee and in thy seed shall all

[55:04] I have spoken to thee of we're going in
[55:06] a
[55:07] Rapture amen and Jacob awakened out of
[55:10] his sleep and said surely the Lord is in
[55:13] this place and I knew it not and he was
[55:15] afraid and said how Dreadful is this
[55:17] place this is none other but the house
[55:20] of God and this is the Gate of Heaven
[55:22] and Jacob Arose up early in the morning
[55:24] and took the stone that he had put for
[55:27] his pillows and set it up for a pillar
[55:29] and poured oil upon the top of it and
[55:32] now we're just going to go to the Book
[55:34] of Mark in Chapter 13 is my um slideshow
[55:39] there just just means that um the
[55:42] brothers in the back going have to do a
[55:43] lot of
[55:45] work um here we are so this is Jesus
[55:49] going out of the
[55:51] temple and they've just looked at the
[55:53] temple they've looked at the buildings
[55:54] and and notice the disciples they they
[55:58] begin to comment on them and as he went
[56:01] out of the temple one of his disciples
[56:03] saith unto him Master see what manner of
[56:06] stones and what buildings are here and
[56:08] Jesus answering said unto him see as
[56:10] thou these great buildings there shall
[56:13] not be left one stone upon another that
[56:16] shall not be thrown
[56:18] down amen let's bow our heads in a word

[58:05] commit the service into your hands in
[58:07] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[58:10] you friends you may have your seats this
[58:12] morning amen so I want to continue on
[58:14] just maybe a different kind of angle
[58:16] from from last Sunday speaking about
[58:18] reality and so Jacob Jacob was was on
[58:21] the run from his from from his brother
[58:24] and and you know we know the story he
[58:27] came to this place he called it bethl
[58:28] which is the you know the house of God
[58:30] and and and he would he would take these
[58:32] stones and he would he would bring them
[58:35] together and he would you know lay upon
[58:37] them and then when the Lord came down he
[58:40] anointed that place now we know that we
[58:43] are more than just natural stones now
[58:45] I'm going to skip a through bit through
[58:47] this but you know we are more than just
[58:49] natural stones the anointing has touched
[58:51] different things down through the
[58:53] Scripture it began the first time that
[58:55] the word anointed this or anointing is
[58:58] ever um U mentioned in the scripture is
[59:01] when God tells Jacob to return to bethl
[59:05] and and he says go to that place that
[59:07] you anointed that pillar so the
[59:08] anointing rested upon a stone and then
[59:12] it moved and then it went upon a
[59:13] priesthood and the Tabernacle right and
[59:16] then it went to the holy of holies and
[59:18] it would fall on prophets but that was
[59:20] never God's original your resting place
[59:23] God's anointing his presence was to
[59:25] dwell in the hearts of human beings and
[59:28] so when we see this where where the
[59:30] disciples would come and they would see
[59:31] the great buildings you know they would
[59:33] see the temple and and um I don't think
[59:35] there was another building like it in
[59:37] all of Jerusalem sure there were palaces
[59:39] there were the Great Walls and things of
[59:40] Jerusalem great places but the temple
[59:42] was a special place and they were so
[59:45] amazed at the at the masonry the gold
[59:48] and the different things that were there
[59:50] they would say to the say to the master
[59:52] who ordained the temple to be built in
[59:54] the first place but now had become flesh
[59:56] what manner of stones are here and what
[59:59] buildings are here you know in other
[1:00:01] words this is incredible place look at
[1:00:03] the masonry look how it's built you know
[1:00:05] look at this and Jesus was really what
[1:00:07] he was doing is we know he is the Master
[1:00:10] Mason he is the master builder and he
[1:00:13] would he was actually Gathering Living
[1:00:15] Stones he wasn't interested no more to
[1:00:18] be behind Badger skins in a temple he
[1:00:20] was not he wasn't interested in dwelling
[1:00:22] in a a building made by man's hands this
[1:00:25] was never his father resting place but
[1:00:27] his final resting place was to be the
[1:00:29] soul of human beings so Jesus was
[1:00:31] basically saying these these great
[1:00:33] buildings they're going to be torn down
[1:00:35] but I'm in the process of building a
[1:00:37] greater building which is my body upon
[1:00:39] the Earth and this is a far more
[1:00:41] important building than a natural
[1:00:42] building you know where where Jacob
[1:00:44] would would would would rest here God
[1:00:48] came down there was a ladder that
[1:00:50] hitched tried to Hitch to the Earth but
[1:00:52] it couldn't hitch on Jacob he was an
[1:00:54] unstable unconverted man the only place
[1:00:56] you could hit your rest was finally on
[1:00:58] Jesus Christ and brother Bram says that
[1:01:00] that ladder is in glory it anchored down
[1:01:02] into Christ and when Christ anchors into
[1:01:05] you then you can go up the ladder into
[1:01:06] Glory I mean but now there was a portal
[1:01:08] opened in heaven where Heaven could come
[1:01:10] down upon the Earth where before it
[1:01:12] wasn't of this way but here was a man
[1:01:14] and he he was seeing Angels going up and
[1:01:16] going down and he saw the Lord Of Glory
[1:01:18] at the top what an incredible place to
[1:01:20] be in now you've got to take this and
[1:01:22] remember we are actually in that same
[1:01:24] position Where Angels come down and they
[1:01:26] visit us amen the Lord comes down and he
[1:01:29] visits us Heaven comes down but now it's
[1:01:32] not just a place where people Marvel Now
[1:01:34] the the people at the bottom of the
[1:01:36] ladder are a channel for God to operate
[1:01:38] through to manifest his word through
[1:01:41] Hallelujah and here we are upon the
[1:01:42] earth now brother Brown makes a
[1:01:44] statement in the token I don't have it
[1:01:46] up here but he says you know it's time
[1:01:48] basically to quit talking about the
[1:01:49] message and get under the message right
[1:01:51] we've been talking about the message
[1:01:52] keeping the lamb up long enough as now
[1:01:54] it's time to get under the message
[1:01:56] and the message is Christ so now now to
[1:01:58] me now we're living in a season far
[1:02:00] beyond trying to work out what the
[1:02:02] message says we know what it says the
[1:02:03] books come open right the Mysteries are
[1:02:05] revealed amen so now it's time for that
[1:02:08] word that book to put on flesh right and
[1:02:10] manifest itself through a
[1:02:12] people amen this is this is why we're
[1:02:15] here is it not Hallelujah so now brother
[1:02:19] Braham would say and I'll I'll I'll come
[1:02:20] back to you know as I my disclaimer as I
[1:02:23] jump around a lot with with slides he
[1:02:25] says
[1:02:26] I've just got through this morning
[1:02:27] bringing the message of a paradox a
[1:02:29] paradox is something that it's
[1:02:31] unreasonable but it it's really
[1:02:33] incredible says Webster but it's true
[1:02:36] something that's incredible you can't
[1:02:38] understand it it's just a mystery Jesus
[1:02:40] did the works of his father because the
[1:02:42] father was in him that is why the works
[1:02:44] was done because that the father was in
[1:02:46] the son do you believe that amen amen
[1:02:50] that that in him he was the Incarnate
[1:02:52] God do you believe that that God the
[1:02:54] Father which is the father of Jesus
[1:02:57] Christ the great spirit dwelt in the
[1:02:58] fullness of his power in Jesus Christ
[1:03:00] which was the Tabernacle of God made
[1:03:02] flesh and dwelt on the earth
[1:03:04] representing the word Jesus was the word
[1:03:06] the Bible said so St John the first
[1:03:08] chapter and the Word was invisible now
[1:03:10] listen close the word was invisible
[1:03:12] until it was made flesh and then the
[1:03:14] word became visible and through his
[1:03:17] sacrificial death at Calvary and his
[1:03:18] resurrection positionally places Church
[1:03:21] in that realm which is Heavenly places
[1:03:23] that same invisible God could come into
[1:03:26] an individual and make the word visible
[1:03:28] Hallelujah there no longer invisible God
[1:03:30] where are you know he's put on flesh
[1:03:32] he's visible in his people oh my I wish
[1:03:34] my church could get that and I say Amen
[1:03:36] if we could see friends the invisible
[1:03:38] God made visible that's why we got to be
[1:03:41] able to discern the Lord's body see the
[1:03:43] word and flesh in one another beyond our
[1:03:46] Humanity beyond our faults but see the
[1:03:48] word amen see an attribute of God and
[1:03:50] flesh that's what we must be able to see
[1:03:52] I've often wanted to come into the
[1:03:54] church I've longed to see it I guess
[1:03:56] where I could walk in the back door
[1:03:58] front door wherever it was look across
[1:04:00] an audience and see a perfect Church all
[1:04:02] in order sin couldn't stay there no the
[1:04:05] spirit called out you see it just
[1:04:07] couldn't stay this is this is what I
[1:04:09] want to see a place where sin can't
[1:04:12] dwell it can't hide behind any agenda or
[1:04:15] any false motive any Veil but sin can't
[1:04:18] dwell Hallelujah and I pray that it
[1:04:20] would actually come to a place where the
[1:04:22] reason people stay away from churches
[1:04:24] they're not willing to make it right and
[1:04:26] they're scared that if they come in
[1:04:27] they'll get called
[1:04:29] out amen shouldn't it be that way like
[1:04:33] ananas and Safar you just couldn't do it
[1:04:35] there'll be no sin in that group no sir
[1:04:37] see the Holy Spirit quickly speak it out
[1:04:39] like that no matter what it was how
[1:04:42] little it would be done see men and wom
[1:04:45] women and men sitting there under the
[1:04:46] power of the Holy Spirit the spirit of
[1:04:48] God moving perfectly moving this someone
[1:04:50] had done something wrong in the
[1:04:51] congregation they come quickly confess
[1:04:53] it before them the spirit got a hold of
[1:04:56] it to confess it both they come tell it
[1:04:58] cuz they know right then it's going to
[1:05:00] be called that's right that's the Church
[1:05:01] of the Living God how am I all poor old
[1:05:04] heart now it's getting old how I've
[1:05:06] longed to stand and see a church like
[1:05:08] that I may yet I hope to perfect works
[1:05:10] of God without sin now it could
[1:05:14] understand now I want to stop right
[1:05:16] there that's not having some kind of
[1:05:18] Concrete Hard Church order that's not
[1:05:21] what this is talking about this is
[1:05:22] talking about Sin in the individual this
[1:05:24] is talking about malicious demon powers
[1:05:26] moving and people allowing them to to to
[1:05:29] to have leverage this is what this is
[1:05:30] talking about this not people having
[1:05:32] faults and failures you following me
[1:05:34] it's not just oh we got to have no no
[1:05:36] this is not what this is talking about
[1:05:37] this is allowing the Devil to have a
[1:05:39] grip in someone's life and people not
[1:05:41] willing to get rid of it I think there
[1:05:43] was I can't remember I think it was
[1:05:44] brother Brian Freeborn I might get it
[1:05:46] wrong but he used to go to prayer
[1:05:47] meetings and the people would get their
[1:05:49] lives right before they went to the
[1:05:50] prayer meeting cuz God would come down
[1:05:52] and call out something that's wrong in
[1:05:53] their lives Hallelujah God you know we
[1:05:56] can't hide nothing I think I think we
[1:05:58] need to come to just the conclusion Lord
[1:06:00] you know everything about me and the
[1:06:02] reason he wants to deal with sin in your
[1:06:04] life is he doesn't want you to be
[1:06:06] dragged by that thing down and be lost
[1:06:09] that's the reason he's not trying to
[1:06:10] point out oh you're bad and you're NY
[1:06:11] and this and this is not what this is
[1:06:13] about this I want my children free I
[1:06:15] want them to SAR in the Heavenly I want
[1:06:17] them to recognize the devil has no part
[1:06:19] in them they have no part of him they
[1:06:21] never belong to him they never were part
[1:06:22] of him at all and there's just a
[1:06:24] separation between God's children and
[1:06:26] the devil that's why hallelujah
[1:06:28] hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jes
[1:06:30] hey we're not our own we're bought with
[1:06:31] a price and the devil don't share I mean
[1:06:33] sorry well the devil wants to share us
[1:06:34] with God but God doesn't want to share
[1:06:36] us with the devil amen never
[1:06:39] never now here stands a group of people
[1:06:42] to be prayed for now we realize if the
[1:06:44] scripture is true and the god of Heaven
[1:06:45] could just create a squirrel and create
[1:06:47] a ram could stop the Sun for a whole day
[1:06:50] 24 hours that could keep fire from
[1:06:52] burning people in a furnace for 3 hours
[1:06:54] he could stop the mouth of lion
[1:06:56] that could raise the dead could walk on
[1:06:57] water could take biscuits and feed 5,000
[1:06:59] that's God that's the word made flesh in
[1:07:01] human beings how does everybody now does
[1:07:04] anyone understand that now the same God
[1:07:06] promised that in the last days these
[1:07:07] things would reoccur again but he can't
[1:07:10] do it until there is somebody he can
[1:07:12] work with work them with then work on
[1:07:15] you see what I mean now let's believe
[1:07:16] that emphatically with all of our heart
[1:07:19] that it's going to be that way oh Lord
[1:07:22] Jesus make me a Clear Channel your blood
[1:07:24] will do it your spirit will do it it's
[1:07:26] not me trying to seven steps to manifest
[1:07:28] the third pole no no no no it's God
[1:07:30] manifesting the third pole in our lives
[1:07:32] but Lord I'm Available I Am Here I Am
[1:07:35] Lord pour it in amen not for my glory
[1:07:37] but for
[1:07:39] yours

[1:07:44] a church
[1:07:45] body we are not just a church body
[1:07:48] brother R says in Christ the mystery God
[1:07:50] revealed he says that to convert people
[1:07:52] to Christianity and its government was
[1:07:54] never the program of God what does that
[1:07:56] mean people just become church members
[1:07:58] that's never the program of God God's
[1:08:00] program is God would come and fill them
[1:08:01] with himself and manifest himself
[1:08:03] through a people amen amen now so be you
[1:08:06] have tasted that the Lord is gracious to

[1:09:19] Mercy Hallelujah you know what I love
[1:09:21] about the scripture you read in the Old
[1:09:22] Testament where where God would instruct
[1:09:26] God would instruct his people when they
[1:09:28] build an altar of stone don't use any
[1:09:31] tools on that stone all right all right

[1:10:15] just another denomination but if it's a
[1:10:17] spirit of God doing it Hallelujah
[1:10:20] because that's what we want don't we we
[1:10:21] want God to take his word and mold us

[1:11:31] now you believe we can be a church that
[1:11:34] the devil can't dwell the devil should
[1:11:36] get very uncomfortable when he walks in
[1:11:38] this door he should get very
[1:11:39] uncomfortable when he walks into your
[1:11:40] house he should get very uncomfortable
[1:11:42] when he tries to walk into your life he
[1:11:43] should actually be you know there should
[1:11:45] be they should be fighting the devil

[1:11:57] there I'm not trying to take them out
[1:11:58] Hallelujah that's how it should be right
[1:12:01] amen we should have such a life like
[1:12:03] that
[1:12:04] now this is this is a different quote
[1:12:06] where I was talking about last Sunday
[1:12:09] about how there was um uh mom and dad
[1:12:11] and their and their boy was on death's
[1:12:12] door brother BR came and prayed the
[1:12:14] prayer of faith and you know you know
[1:12:16] the nurse was all upset because the
[1:12:17] parents were rejoicing and the um you
[1:12:20] know but but
[1:12:22] physically uh the boy was still
[1:12:24] basically on death St but their reality
[1:12:26] was that God had healed them uh um um
[1:12:28] healed them and and they weren't looking
[1:12:30] at the things that are seen he says and
[1:12:32] that old man never forget he put his
[1:12:34] hand upon the shoulder of that little
[1:12:36] young lady probably in her late teens
[1:12:37] that's the nurse said sister dear you're
[1:12:39] looking at that machine that's all you
[1:12:41] got to look at but I'm looking at a
[1:12:42] Divine promise amen the next morning the
[1:12:45] boy took his breakfast and he's married
[1:12:47] and got a child now see the woman all
[1:12:49] she knew was just to do what the machine
[1:12:51] said but this old man looked Faith
[1:12:52] pissed beyond that and he and he saw God
[1:12:56] who was able to do exceedingly
[1:12:58] abundantly uh The God Who had promised
[1:13:01] never to fail us or to leave us or
[1:13:02] forsake us he it depends what you're
[1:13:04] looking at the Christian looks at things
[1:13:06] they don't see because they walk in
[1:13:08] faith is that right we believe it
[1:13:10] because the Bible said so they believe
[1:13:12] it uh that's how we believe is because
[1:13:15] God said so Faith tested tried it proves
[1:13:18] out 100% God's obligated to answer that
[1:13:22] Faith so if God gives you a revelation
[1:13:24] of something he's obligated to manifest
[1:13:27] that that Revelation right cuz Faith is
[1:13:29] a
[1:13:30] revelation he says the Christian looks
[1:13:32] at things they don't see because they
[1:13:34] walk by faith is that right we believe
[1:13:37] it because the Bible said so they
[1:13:39] believed it that's how we Believers
[1:13:41] because God said so Faith tested tried
[1:13:43] it proves out 100% God's under
[1:13:46] obligation to answer that Faith look
[1:13:48] what it did that mother standing there
[1:13:50] she put her baby in uh into the same
[1:13:53] death that every other baby went into
[1:13:54] speak of Moses's Mom right putting it
[1:13:56] into the Nile and a little basket about
[1:13:59] so big and a baby laying in it probably
[1:14:01] about 3 months old laying in a little
[1:14:03] basket about so long nothing but a bunch
[1:14:05] of rushes like Willows laced together
[1:14:08] with some pitch and slime messed in it
[1:14:10] and pushed it out into the flags where
[1:14:12] the crocodiles and everything else was
[1:14:15] uh but why it would have meant death
[1:14:18] well sure it was right in it was right
[1:14:21] in the same river of death but by faith
[1:14:24] and atonement was made for it by faith
[1:14:26] not by an act of natural laws but by
[1:14:29] faith natural laws would have just
[1:14:31] proved the alligator smelt the baby and
[1:14:32] that was it see or out where the first
[1:14:36] Little Wave would have tipped it over
[1:14:37] that would have settled it but Faith
[1:14:39] looked beyond that now we've got to
[1:14:42] understand that Faith overrides natural
[1:14:44] laws Faith overrides natural laws now in
[1:14:48] in the um you know at the UN and then
[1:14:50] also in America and different places
[1:14:52] there's different positions that have
[1:14:53] the power of veto who knows what veto is
[1:14:56] you like the UN there'll be news the
[1:14:57] security Council will try and pass some
[1:14:59] piece of legislation and but there's
[1:15:01] permanent members of the security C
[1:15:03] Council that have the power of veto so
[1:15:05] basically the majority can vote Yes we
[1:15:07] want to do that but someone can stand up
[1:15:08] say no veto that and it's cancelled
[1:15:11] right and so now Faith Faith vetos or
[1:15:15] overwrites natural laws now you take for
[1:15:19] example you take for example the sun
[1:15:21] will rise at a certain time and set at a
[1:15:23] certain time right right we can actually
[1:15:26] you know tonight tonight the sun will
[1:15:28] set at 18 8 we know that right
[1:15:32] apparently when um when Christopher
[1:15:34] Columbus or one of them was was there in
[1:15:36] the Caribbean he knew that there was a
[1:15:38] blood moon was going to rise and he
[1:15:40] actually told the natives I'm going to
[1:15:41] turn the blood red unless you know you
[1:15:42] do what I say and it turned blood
[1:15:44] because they knew by their times and
[1:15:45] their charts that it was going to happen
[1:15:47] so that was natural laws right but now
[1:15:49] when Joshua was was was there fighting
[1:15:52] the enemy his faith overrode the natural
[1:15:55] laws remember the sun will always rise
[1:15:57] it always set but his faith overrode
[1:16:00] those natural laws it vetoed it the sun
[1:16:01] saying I'm going down Joshua says no IO
[1:16:04] you can't go down Moon you can't go down
[1:16:06] you stay there until we've won this
[1:16:08] battle writes a has Faith overrode the
[1:16:11] natural laws Hallelujah and they stayed
[1:16:14] still for 24 hours so normally well say
[1:16:17] 100% of the time the law the natural law
[1:16:21] of death states that when life leaves
[1:16:24] the you know any kind of organism then
[1:16:26] that body will go right and Decay that's
[1:16:29] the natural laws of life right but faith
[1:16:33] will override that law hallelujah amen
[1:16:37] the shunamite woman now we're going to
[1:16:39] the shunamite woman was given a child
[1:16:42] remember she built a little room and you
[1:16:44] know you know for Elisha the prophet to
[1:16:46] to to go rest in and you know the
[1:16:49] prophet said to gazi go get the shite
[1:16:51] woman you know what does she need you
[1:16:53] know you know she says well you dwell
[1:16:55] with my people you I don't need to go
[1:16:57] see the captains or whatever and then
[1:16:59] gazi said well she doesn't have a son
[1:17:01] and so the prophet said well you're
[1:17:03] going to have a son and she said you
[1:17:05] know don't make fun of me basically you
[1:17:07] know old and so on but she said no no no
[1:17:10] I mean he said to her you're going to
[1:17:11] have the son remember it wasn't the
[1:17:13] prophet that gave the promise it was God
[1:17:15] hallelujah so now here she is and the
[1:17:17] child was grown and it fell on the day
[1:17:19] that he went out with his father to the
[1:17:21] Reapers and he said unto his father my
[1:17:23] head my head so he got like stroke or
[1:17:25] something and he said to the um and he
[1:17:27] said to a lad carry him to his mother
[1:17:30] and when he had taken him and brought
[1:17:32] him to his mother he sat on her knees
[1:17:34] till noon and then died so now the
[1:17:37] natural law of death means he's they're
[1:17:39] going to bury him and he's going to rot
[1:17:41] and decompose and that's
[1:17:42] it but this judite woman had the power
[1:17:45] of
[1:17:46] veto so she went and came into the man
[1:17:48] of God to mount carel and it came to
[1:17:50] pass when the man of God saw a far off
[1:17:52] that he said to gahaz his servant behold
[1:17:55] Yonder is the shite run now I pray thee
[1:17:58] to meet her and sayto her is it well
[1:17:59] with thee is it well with thy husband is
[1:18:02] it well with the child and she answered
[1:18:04] it is well Hallelujah so so naturally
[1:18:07] it'd say Well it maybe it's not well
[1:18:09] with you it's not well with your husband
[1:18:11] because you've lost your son and it's
[1:18:13] sure not well with him because he's dead
[1:18:15] I me but she had she had a faith that
[1:18:18] overrode a natural law and she knew if I
[1:18:20] can just get into the presence of the
[1:18:22] word if I just get into the presence of
[1:18:24] that prophet all will be well so as soon
[1:18:26] as she found she found the prophet she
[1:18:29] says it is well Hallelujah because now
[1:18:31] her faith was going to override
[1:18:34] Hallelujah that law of natural death and
[1:18:36] it was going to bring life again
[1:18:38] Hallelujah it wasn't the prophet's faith
[1:18:39] that brought the child back to life it
[1:18:41] was the shite's faith it was her faith
[1:18:43] when it was released Amen to to to the
[1:18:46] prophet Hallelujah God came on the scene
[1:18:49] and it was going to stay a funeral but
[1:18:52] it became a resurrection
[1:18:54] Hallelujah she knew if she could just
[1:18:56] get to just get to the prophet all would
[1:18:59] be well that's the same thing with blind
[1:19:01] bmus blind bmus was you know he was
[1:19:04] blind the natural law says if you go
[1:19:07] blind you stay blind especially in those
[1:19:09] days there's no there's no surgery to to
[1:19:11] undo whatever he had but he had a faith
[1:19:15] he had a faith that would reverse his
[1:19:17] blindness are you following me I want
[1:19:18] you to noce your faith is powerful if
[1:19:21] God is if you have a revelation of Jesus
[1:19:23] Christ amen that that is the same faith
[1:19:26] that created sun moon and stars amen
[1:19:29] because remember God stood there before
[1:19:31] there was anything said let there be
[1:19:32] light and he and the prophet said he
[1:19:34] believed his own word hallelujah and
[1:19:36] everything materialized amen hallelujah
[1:19:40] so now here was blind byus the natural
[1:19:42] laws would say you can never recover
[1:19:44] your sight again and you might as well
[1:19:46] just accept that you're blind but he his
[1:19:47] mommy told him stories of the god of
[1:19:50] Joshua yeah Hallelujah of Elijah of
[1:19:54] elishah that passed through Jericho
[1:19:56] passed through around here I mean of
[1:19:58] Rahab and different ones and then he
[1:20:00] began to hear a noise coming down the
[1:20:02] street that he never heard before and
[1:20:03] Jesus of Nazareth was coming this way
[1:20:06] and people are maybe crying out hosana
[1:20:08] and here's the son of David and isn't
[1:20:09] this wonderful others were saying get
[1:20:11] out of here you false prophet this is
[1:20:13] nothing but a fraud and you know he
[1:20:15] would hear these things and and and then
[1:20:17] he would ask someone you know brother B
[1:20:19] would dramatize it he would he would
[1:20:20] lean up against the you know wall of the
[1:20:22] city you know where the where the son
[1:20:24] had baked into the stones and now it was
[1:20:25] warm against his back and he would he
[1:20:27] would rest there and and then he'd hear
[1:20:29] this cry going past and then he would
[1:20:31] turn to someone and say what's going on
[1:20:33] what is this going on and and then a
[1:20:35] woman would come to him and say oh blind

[1:20:40] coming by no who's coming by Jesus of
[1:20:42] Nazareth well who's Jesus of Nazareth
[1:20:45] well he's a prophet From Galilee a
[1:20:47] prophet then his mind you know his heart
[1:20:49] would begin to begin to flutter a
[1:20:50] prophet I don't know what prophets do
[1:20:52] Hallelujah and then she would begin to
[1:20:54] testify to him you know he C the storm

[1:21:04] given the blind their sight given oh
[1:21:07] Jesus Son of David have mercy on me and
[1:21:10] it wasn't his physical voice that got
[1:21:12] Jesus attention it was his faith he knew
[1:21:16] that if he could just get the Master's
[1:21:18] attention amen the natural law of
[1:21:20] blindness would be undone it would be
[1:21:22] vetoed it would be overrode Hallelujah
[1:21:25] and he would get his sight back and
[1:21:27] that's exactly what happened sir
[1:21:31] Hallelujah see Faith doesn't act by
[1:21:33] natural
[1:21:34] laws amen it doesn't act by natural laws
[1:21:38] it it Faith overrides natural laws right
[1:21:44] Hallelujah you know so to override it
[1:21:47] means to use one's authority to reject
[1:21:51] or cancel we got to use our god-given
[1:21:53] Authority the devil says one thing
[1:21:56] override it doesn't matter how great a
[1:21:58] schemes may be how long he's been
[1:21:59] planning something against you just
[1:22:01] override it with your faith say no devil
[1:22:03] you're not coming here am not today
[1:22:06] Hallelujah not today Satan not today you
[1:22:09] can't have my child not today you know
[1:22:11] ordinarily a a human being is built as
[1:22:14] the Apostle Paul would say not one seeks
[1:22:16] after God
[1:22:18] ordinarily doesn't matter who you are
[1:22:21] you're actually born not to seek God but
[1:22:25] faith will override that faith will
[1:22:27] override that and turn a heart to begin
[1:22:29] to seek
[1:22:30] God hallelujah you know in 2007 I was
[1:22:34] lost and
[1:22:35] undone but there were people who were
[1:22:37] sitting in this room that were praying
[1:22:38] for a
[1:22:39] pastor hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:43] what happened now Faith came override my
[1:22:45] Fallen nature began to draw me and I met
[1:22:48] the Lord in September
[1:22:49] 2007
[1:22:52] hallelujah amen Faith Works yes Faith
[1:22:55] doesn't back up Faith doesn't compromise
[1:22:58] faith gets the victory Hallelujah faith
[1:23:01] is determined hello woman of Faith how
[1:23:03] are you Hallelujah that's how we should
[1:23:06] be amen we should use our veto the
[1:23:08] devil's got a lot of plans for us but
[1:23:09] God has a plan but there's a power in
[1:23:12] your decision remember God doesn't Force
[1:23:14] us to take a Rapture he doesn't Force us
[1:23:16] to overcome brother B says he doesn't
[1:23:18] just push us through a pipe and make us
[1:23:20] overcome we have to choose who are we
[1:23:23] going to yield ourselves to
[1:23:25] amen
[1:23:28] hallelujah hallelujah so the sh might
[1:23:31] said it as well you know that same one
[1:23:33] that she made contact with is here
[1:23:36] that's right she wasn't going after a
[1:23:38] natural man only she was trying to
[1:23:40] contact the God and the prophet he's the
[1:23:42] Holy Ghost and that same God is here we
[1:23:45] just get into his presence amen it is
[1:23:47] well Hallelujah Lord hallelujah but she
[1:23:51] said I'll not I'm not going to leave you
[1:23:53] so the prophet came came back over
[1:23:55] prayed walked up and down the room laid
[1:23:57] his body upon the dead child and it came
[1:23:58] back to
[1:24:00] life now the woman Martha knew that the
[1:24:03] sh might realize that God was in his
[1:24:05] prophet and if God was in his Prophet
[1:24:07] surely God was in his son so if she
[1:24:10] could just get to Jesus she would she
[1:24:12] would have the remedy so she runs and
[1:24:15] falls down before him says Lord if
[1:24:17] that's what he was Lord if thou would
[1:24:19] have been here my brother would not have
[1:24:21] died but even now whatsoever you ask God
[1:24:23] God will do it oh I like that even now
[1:24:27] whatsoever you ask God God will do it
[1:24:31] Hallelujah cuz he was the one with the
[1:24:32] power of the veto to override lazarus's
[1:24:34] death now I want you to you
[1:24:38] know Jesus always wants to bring us into
[1:24:40] the present
[1:24:42] tense she would say I know at the last
[1:24:45] day my brother will raise again and it's
[1:24:47] always one day it'll happen one day
[1:24:49] we'll get the promise yeah sure one day
[1:24:51] and it's always off in the future but
[1:24:53] Jesus was not interested in the last
[1:24:55] resur he wasn't interested in that
[1:24:57] Resurrection for Lazarus he came to the
[1:24:59] tomb that he would be raised that day
[1:25:02] that was the purpose that he went by the
[1:25:04] way of Lazarus right so she says I know
[1:25:06] at the last day you know I know that he
[1:25:09] shall rise again the resurrection at the
[1:25:11] last day but Jesus said to her I am I am
[1:25:15] the resurrection and the life right now
[1:25:17] right now I am the resurrection not just
[1:25:19] I will be cuz he will be but I am amen
[1:25:23] where he is is a resurrection
[1:25:25] where he is he is the resurrection amen
[1:25:27] so if he is in our presence right now
[1:25:29] the resurrection's here hallelujah the
[1:25:32] same God that Rose Lazarus from the
[1:25:34] grave is present amen and he can
[1:25:36] resurrect you from your doubt from your
[1:25:37] unbelief from your pain from your
[1:25:39] complexes from whever it may be from
[1:25:41] your hurt whatever it is he can raise
[1:25:43] you from that into life Hallelujah he's
[1:25:46] here to do it amen don't look off into
[1:25:48] the future right now right now
[1:25:51] Hallelujah he brought he brought her
[1:25:53] Focus don't look off there right now you
[1:25:56] are standing Marthur in the presence of
[1:25:58] the Resurrection how I say little bride
[1:26:01] right here you are sitting in the
[1:26:03] presence of the resurrection and the
[1:26:05] life Jesus Christ hallelujah what could
[1:26:08] happen if we just release our desires to

[1:26:25] word his word is here amen his word is
[1:26:28] in flesh hallelujah it's more than just
[1:26:30] think on paper more than quotes on a
[1:26:32] screen it's in
[1:26:33] flesh Hallelujah so he is the
[1:26:35] resurrection and the life right now
[1:26:38] amen hallelujah glory to God never ever
[1:26:42] let the devil say well the promise can
[1:26:43] be tomorrow not today hey the devil is
[1:26:46] the greatest procrastinator he'll try
[1:26:48] and get you to procrastinate he'll try
[1:26:50] and get you to put off a promise for
[1:26:51] tomorrow he'll make sure everything else
[1:26:53] is busy than that
[1:26:55] promise Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:26:57] he'll try oh put it off I got to do this
[1:26:59] I got to do that no just get to the
[1:27:01] master just get to him hallelujah
[1:27:04] hallelujah
[1:27:08] amen now no matter what the opposition
[1:27:10] looks like Christ is the answer Faith
[1:27:14] brings Christ notice would you remember
[1:27:16] 80 years old Whitebeard white here and
[1:27:18] yet the old man went around telling
[1:27:21] people he wasn't going to die till he
[1:27:22] had seen the Lord's Christ This is
[1:27:24] this is uh Simeon or Simon in the temple
[1:27:27] what a beautiful picture of faith faith
[1:27:29] knows no defeat faith is perfect Faith
[1:27:32] brings things when there is no things to
[1:27:33] be brought Faith creates Faith takes
[1:27:36] doubt away takes negative and makes them
[1:27:38] positive how beautiful the old man had a
[1:27:40] basis for faith faith is not mythical
[1:27:43] something mentally worked up it's an
[1:27:45] absolutely fundamental results that
[1:27:47] happens in a person's heart when faith
[1:27:49] is appropriated then it is something in
[1:27:51] the person's heart but it can't be based
[1:27:53] on go touch a tree and you'll get well
[1:27:56] or pray to the post it's got to have a
[1:27:58] foundation oh here it is I want you to
[1:28:00] get it how much more Foundation could
[1:28:02] you place your faith on any level than
[1:28:04] the word of God what more could you put
[1:28:06] Faith in when he said heavens and earth
[1:28:08] will pass away but my word shall never
[1:28:11] pass away so it's not something mentally
[1:28:13] worked up it's something that's given
[1:28:16] and when it's given it's sure and secure
[1:28:18] Hallelujah it knows no defeat I just I I
[1:28:21] just want to read it again I like it
[1:28:22] Faith knows no defeat faith is perfect
[1:28:25] Faith brings things where there's no
[1:28:27] things to be brought he say I don't know
[1:28:29] a way out of this he'll bring a way out
[1:28:31] I don't know how this is going to happen
[1:28:32] he'll cause it to happen H I don't know
[1:28:34] how how this is going I don't know how
[1:28:36] I'm going to get well I don't know how
[1:28:37] this is going to he brings it amen
[1:28:40] because our reality is the word of God
[1:28:42] it's not what we see not what we feel
[1:28:44] not what we hear it's absolutely the
[1:28:46] word faith
[1:28:48] creates Faith takes doubt away takes
[1:28:51] negative and makes
[1:28:52] positive Hallelujah
[1:28:58] what shall we and how shall they preach
[1:29:00] except they be seen as it is written how
[1:29:03] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:29:04] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:29:06] Glad Tidings of good things but they
[1:29:08] have not all obeyed the gospel for
[1:29:11] Isaiah sayith Lord who have believed our
[1:29:13] report and when I read that I say I
[1:29:14] believe the report Hallelujah so then
[1:29:17] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:29:19] the word of God right so faith comes by
[1:29:22] hearing and you're hearing comes by the
[1:29:25] word hallelujah so where the word of God
[1:29:27] is preached it produces Faith amen it it
[1:29:31] causes a hearing in the elect right and
[1:29:34] it produces a faith amen and there has
[1:29:37] never been a faith released upon the
[1:29:40] Earth as
[1:29:40] today there's never been a faith right
[1:29:43] there's been people who have been
[1:29:44] looking for the promise of the body
[1:29:46] change but now rapturing faith has come
[1:29:48] to the church Hallelujah because
[1:29:50] remember when God ever does something
[1:29:52] when he opens his word it releases of
[1:29:54] Faith which is equal to that word so for
[1:29:56] example Israel was slaves in Egypt then
[1:29:59] God came down on SI I'm going to give
[1:30:02] you a land what did it do it produced a
[1:30:04] faith in a people the Caleb and Joshua
[1:30:06] outfit and they said we're more than
[1:30:08] able to take the land and they took the
[1:30:10] land Hallelujah isn't that right amen
[1:30:14] and then they did great works of Faith
[1:30:17] because that word they received now
[1:30:18] that's just a shadow under the blood of
[1:30:20] bulls and goats how much more people
[1:30:21] under the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:30:24] where now the word came open in Jesus's
[1:30:26] day he revealed himself right to give a
[1:30:29] overcoming power to the church that they
[1:30:31] would not be beaten down by demon
[1:30:34] Spirits they would not be beaten down by
[1:30:36] their first birth right they would not
[1:30:37] be beaten down by things passed down
[1:30:39] their lineages and different things but
[1:30:41] they would have overcoming power right
[1:30:44] over the flesh over the devil Hallelujah
[1:30:46] over the grave amen they would be
[1:30:48] Overcomers amen hallelujah but you see
[1:30:52] the problem is is
[1:30:55] there had to be a cycle of Revival and
[1:30:56] death so that church walked in power in
[1:30:59] the book of Acts but then they slowly
[1:31:01] went down into formalism and then Into
[1:31:03] the Dark Ages but God said I will
[1:31:05] restore but then what happened is God
[1:31:08] held back what John saw on the aisle of
[1:31:10] Patmos where he says he was about to
[1:31:12] write what the Thunders were he says
[1:31:13] don't write it down because there's
[1:31:15] going to be a people at the end time
[1:31:17] that will need that power contained in
[1:31:19] those Thunders right I'm going to
[1:31:21] release it into the church at a certain
[1:31:23] time Hallelujah and that Faith that's
[1:31:25] released through that word is going to
[1:31:27] give them rapturing Faith sir hallelujah
[1:31:30] amen and so in the end time the book
[1:31:32] comes open and we know that the mystery
[1:31:34] contained in the Thunders is the
[1:31:36] revelation of the Seven Seals right
[1:31:38] right so when the book came open now it
[1:31:40] released a rapturing faith to a bride
[1:31:43] Hallelujah that that we can live over
[1:31:45] the flesh amen over all demon power amen
[1:31:48] hallelujah we can walk in Victory Amen
[1:31:51] in spite of whatever the devil tries to
[1:31:52] put on us we can walk in Victory amen we
[1:31:55] can we can walk above grudges we can
[1:31:58] walk above resentment we can walk above
[1:32:00] unforgiveness amen we can walk above
[1:32:02] anything the devil tries to put on
[1:32:04] anyone we can walk above it I me because
[1:32:06] God has released a faith into the church
[1:32:09] I me to overcome all those things amen
[1:32:13] hallelujah he say well I don't see that
[1:32:15] happening open your eyes and look around
[1:32:18] open your eyes and look around and you
[1:32:19] will see it is happening amen where a
[1:32:21] people can be brought from every corner
[1:32:23] of the Earth into one place and walk in
[1:32:25] harmony work in harmony operate as one
[1:32:27] body Hallelujah as as as the temple was
[1:32:30] stones from different places different
[1:32:32] materials built to make that Temple Am
[1:32:34] mean so is the body of Jesus Christ
[1:32:36] gathered from different parts of the
[1:32:38] earth Hallelujah and they built into one
[1:32:40] body and we can go to different nations
[1:32:42] you know yeah it just rejoiced my heart
[1:32:45] when I went to Vanuatu the first time
[1:32:47] now I know me talk piss and all so I
[1:32:51] know a little bit of pigeon from Pap and
[1:32:52] they speak bislama you just you know you
[1:32:54] just change a few words and you can kind
[1:32:56] of so I'm talking to um some of the
[1:32:59] Brethren up there that speak French as
[1:33:00] their first language they don't know
[1:33:01] English so we're so we're communicating
[1:33:03] in this broken pigeon and we're having a
[1:33:06] jubilee cuz the same spirit's there
[1:33:09] we're talking about the Lord and how
[1:33:10] good he is and we're just having such a
[1:33:11] good time Hallelujah why cuz the same
[1:33:13] spirit is there amen why because it's
[1:33:16] the body of Christ coming
[1:33:18] together hallelujah amen that's right
[1:33:22] amen
[1:33:25] now so there is a power being released
[1:33:27] in this day this is why the bride is
[1:33:29] ordained she cannot fall in this day
[1:33:32] unfortunately that first bride had to
[1:33:34] fall cuz there had to be a dark ages but
[1:33:36] God has released a power into the church
[1:33:38] right that we would have we'd go back to
[1:33:40] the book of Acts but not the failures of
[1:33:43] the book of Acts but the victories right
[1:33:45] but the overcoming power the
[1:33:47] manifestation of the word right but God
[1:33:49] would release a power into the church by
[1:33:51] the book coming open that we wouldn't go
[1:33:54] back into death but we'd stay in life
[1:33:57] Hallelujah and that's that's an
[1:33:58] individual thing it's not a collective
[1:34:00] thing it's an individual thing amen that
[1:34:03] there are people that will break the
[1:34:05] cycle of Revival and death but they will
[1:34:08] come from death and stand in Revival am
[1:34:11] mean they won't cool down if the Devil
[1:34:12] Comes against them try and make them
[1:34:14] cold and formal and Powerless they will
[1:34:16] resist that Spirit they will they will
[1:34:18] they will absolutely just curse that
[1:34:20] thing in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:34:21] they'll walk on in Revival yes sir that
[1:34:23] doesn't mean we won't have our ups and
[1:34:25] downs but there will be a people that
[1:34:26] will not settle with just church anity
[1:34:29] Hallelujah there's a people that will
[1:34:31] not settle with the God not moving they
[1:34:33] will not rest I'll say Lord I want you
[1:34:35] to move every service touch my life
[1:34:37] every time I open your word every time I
[1:34:38] hear a tape every time I pray I want to
[1:34:40] feel you come down and change my life
[1:34:42] Hallelujah I want you to come and move
[1:34:44] and take the service you know if we are
[1:34:46] living stones Hallelujah but it's not
[1:34:49] our life anymore it's God's life
[1:34:51] Hallelujah so God should be able to come
[1:34:53] down to a church and just take the
[1:34:55] service over in such a way that it's not
[1:34:57] the preacher preaching it's God's pre
[1:34:59] it's God preaching it's not the
[1:35:01] congregation worshiping and saying amen
[1:35:02] it's God saying amen hallelujah it's
[1:35:04] them singing cating It's God doing it
[1:35:07] it's not a human ability it's God doing
[1:35:09] it
[1:35:11] Hallelujah you know like brother brah
[1:35:12] would say sometimes he'd have to go back
[1:35:14] and listen to the prayer lines to see
[1:35:15] what happened cuz he wasn't even
[1:35:18] conscious of what God was doing yeah and
[1:35:20] he would say to many people now whatever
[1:35:22] he said just then you go do it
[1:35:25] Hallelujah I think now this is just me I
[1:35:28] think we should be able to have to go
[1:35:29] look back at the recording amen and say
[1:35:31] what happened amen hallelujah CU we're
[1:35:35] so
[1:35:36] yielded I'm not I'm not talking about
[1:35:38] this guy I'm talking about all of us
[1:35:40] hallelujah shouldn't it be that way
[1:35:42] we're Channel you God God said I'm going
[1:35:44] to dwell in the human heart I'm going to
[1:35:46] live out of them you know when brother
[1:35:49] Braham says this and it's to me it's
[1:35:50] more than a quote he says if the spirit
[1:35:53] of Shakespeare was in me I would write
[1:35:56] great place and poetry yes if the spirit
[1:35:58] of bethoven was in me I'd make great I'd
[1:36:01] write great music if the spirit of
[1:36:03] Michelangelo was in me I'd do great
[1:36:05] masterpieces he says Michelangelo and I
[1:36:07] cannot live in the same body one of us
[1:36:10] has to be dead other one has to be
[1:36:11] living right and if the so if the spirit
[1:36:13] of Jesus Christ is in me I will do the
[1:36:16] works of Jesus Christ he and me can't
[1:36:18] live in the same place I have to be my
[1:36:20] life is dead and hid in Christ and the
[1:36:22] life I now live live by the faith of the
[1:36:24] Son of God hallelujah that's how it
[1:36:26] should be it's not me it's not me living
[1:36:28] no more hallelujah it's him
[1:36:31] living amen
[1:36:33] hallelujah now I believe this is from
[1:36:36] the rising of the
[1:36:37] Sun the quickening power wasn't only in
[1:36:41] their soul but it was all over them
[1:36:45] hallelujah hallelujah so the quickening
[1:36:47] power didn't just stay in their soul and
[1:36:50] didn't have an outworking all right amen
[1:36:53] yeah to me I you know I don't understand
[1:36:55] how people can say I have the Holy Ghost
[1:36:56] there's no
[1:36:58] manifestation we're not Baptists a
[1:37:00] Baptist just says I believe by faith but
[1:37:02] there's no manifestation the bride amen
[1:37:05] this day we have the mechanics and we
[1:37:07] have the Dynamics right so the mechanics
[1:37:09] is actually you surrender to God and the
[1:37:12] Dynamics is Holy Ghost living through
[1:37:13] you right so to me now we can't just say
[1:37:16] well I have the Holy Ghost but there's
[1:37:18] no
[1:37:21] life amen that's just that's just empty
[1:37:23] words Hallelujah you say well my heart's
[1:37:26] been turned and stuff praise the Lord
[1:37:27] just keep walking right it's it's God's
[1:37:30] work to turn the heart you know you know
[1:37:32] we know the interview with sister Bruce
[1:37:34] where brother says actually when your
[1:37:36] heart was turned from walking to with
[1:37:37] the world and Walking with God that's
[1:37:39] when you received the Holy Ghost but she
[1:37:41] had a burden to pray for people so that
[1:37:44] was God working in her life she was a
[1:37:46] prayer Warrior but we should be able to
[1:37:48] look back and we should be able to see a
[1:37:49] book of Acts living amen God lived here
[1:37:52] and God lived there and God's Alive here
[1:37:56] you following me a testimony is not just
[1:37:58] a one time Affair you know before I ever
[1:38:01] went to a messes church I was briefly at
[1:38:03] a Pentecostal church and they were they
[1:38:06] were sincere people fine people but you
[1:38:08] know all their testimonies were the same
[1:38:11] they spoke in tongues that's
[1:38:14] it you know there was no you know and
[1:38:18] praise the Lord but you got to go beyond
[1:38:19] just being anointed and you know I'm not
[1:38:22] again speaking in tongues right yeah but
[1:38:24] there's got to be a life change where we
[1:38:27] can look back and say I was that guy now
[1:38:29] I'm this guy and I see I see the Lord
[1:38:31] the word actually putting on flesh it's
[1:38:33] not I'm not just quoting quotes the
[1:38:34] quotes are living I'm not just quoting
[1:38:36] scripture the scripture is living yes
[1:38:38] sir Hallelujah so the quickening power
[1:38:41] wasn't just only in their soul it was
[1:38:43] all over them Hallelujah not only the
[1:38:47] Dynamics coming to Quicken but it
[1:38:48] quickened the mechanics you see what I
[1:38:50] mean they were so Quicken until their
[1:38:52] tongues begin to speak other language
[1:38:54] they were so quickened by the power of
[1:38:56] the resurrection of Christ until they
[1:38:57] laid their hands they were so quickened
[1:38:59] with quickening power till when they
[1:39:01] laid their hands upon the sick they got
[1:39:03] well and quickened your mortal body they
[1:39:05] were healed by laying on their hand and
[1:39:07] the spirit quickened their Fellowship
[1:39:09] together with god Till They also were so
[1:39:12] quickened into the presence of God until
[1:39:14] when a person died and their soul had
[1:39:16] gone off it called him back to life
[1:39:18] again amen glory now I'm feeling
[1:39:21] religious Hallelujah why cuz they had a
[1:39:23] reality and we have this reality brother
[1:39:26] says that the end time message releases
[1:39:28] the Holy Ghost upon the people
[1:39:30] hallelujah because it's no longer bound
[1:39:32] at the doors of Creeds and dogmas amen
[1:39:34] right it's no longer bound back that it
[1:39:36] can't move but the word has been
[1:39:38] restored so the Holy Ghost can just have
[1:39:40] free
[1:39:40] course
[1:39:42] Hallelujah he say well I've got
[1:39:44] quickening power you'll have the nature
[1:39:46] of God to prove it
[1:39:48] that's amen amen right amen having a
[1:39:51] temple like a buur and saying you're
[1:39:52] seal and something's not right that's
[1:39:55] right quicker Not only was his
[1:39:57] resurrection for himself but whosoever
[1:40:00] will owe this predestinated seed that's
[1:40:02] laying there Quicken quickens the Mortal
[1:40:04] body they laid hands on the sick they
[1:40:06] recovered they prayed in the spirit they
[1:40:08] saw Vision called the dead back to life
[1:40:10] that's right Qui Quicken their mortal
[1:40:11] body if it comes unto you if it be so
[1:40:14] now you can say it so but if it's so
[1:40:17] these signs follow them that believe you
[1:40:19] see it quickens your mortal body it'll
[1:40:21] Quicken you now no notice quickening in
[1:40:24] the prin of God why it was the spirit of
[1:40:26] God that raised up Jesus from the grave
[1:40:28] and the spirit of God I give unto them
[1:40:30] eternal life come from the Greek word if
[1:40:32] you look up Zoe which moves in through
[1:40:34] you and then quickens even uh their even
[1:40:38] their mind now notice God's life which
[1:40:41] is in the Greek called Zoe moved through
[1:40:43] them and in them Quicken their minds to
[1:40:45] his word now let me say it real quietly
[1:40:48] now the spirit of God that moves among
[1:40:50] the people quickens the mind of the
[1:40:51] person to the promise of God see it
[1:40:53] doesn't look and I'm trying to show you
[1:40:55] and let you realize that I'm speaking
[1:40:57] now of the church and also Quicken to
[1:41:00] life in him now I want to go back to my
[1:41:03] thought before I said about how Faith
[1:41:05] overrides a natural natural law right
[1:41:09] and normally it's not a man's heart to
[1:41:12] follow God there has to come a faith
[1:41:14] that will override that yes right so
[1:41:19] although although they only had his
[1:41:21] attributes to begin with but if God said
[1:41:23] in this day back in the beginning John
[1:41:26] Doe will be my servant millions of years
[1:41:28] ago now John Doe is born in sin shaped
[1:41:30] in iniquity come to the world speaking
[1:41:32] lies because he's
[1:41:34] Immortal right but maybe he gets a
[1:41:37] little religious feeling now that's
[1:41:40] still natural law because it's naturally
[1:41:42] built a man to be religious thou worship
[1:41:45] Darwin th worship all different kinds of
[1:41:47] things th worship a church th worship a
[1:41:49] ministry right they worship nature all
[1:41:52] different kinds of things they'll
[1:41:53] worship it they'll worship
[1:41:56] themselves Southeast hello look at me
[1:42:00] and they'll put a filter on it to say
[1:42:02] they're Idols better than anyway now see
[1:42:06] so that's just but something has to
[1:42:07] override that you see he might get a
[1:42:09] little religious feeling he'll go join a
[1:42:11] church maybe he'll join a Pentecostal
[1:42:13] church I don't know he might join
[1:42:15] anything but let him get under the
[1:42:17] atmosphere of God once see John do is
[1:42:20] bound to recognize who his father is
[1:42:23] this is why atmosphere is so
[1:42:25] important amen that's why atmosphere
[1:42:27] because it took an atmosphere to birth
[1:42:29] you Hallelujah cuz it goes beyond what
[1:42:31] the preacher says beyond what the song
[1:42:33] is singing it's an atmosphere that comes
[1:42:35] down and it makes you recognize oh Lord
[1:42:38] God you're my father Hallelujah so if it
[1:42:41] create it required an atmosphere for you
[1:42:42] it sure will create a require an
[1:42:44] atmosphere for our
[1:42:47] children that's why atmosphere is so
[1:42:49] important that's why we're so rigid and
[1:42:51] overbearing of being helicopter parents
[1:42:52] how that going to work amen you got to
[1:42:55] train them up in the way that they
[1:42:56] should go
[1:42:58] Hallelujah and that's not you
[1:43:01] know we have to create an atmosphere in
[1:43:03] the home that they want what we have
[1:43:07] that they actually want what Daddy has
[1:43:09] what Mommy has I want that I want that
[1:43:11] God they have I want that one that's how
[1:43:14] we got to be see it takes atmosphere
[1:43:17] that's why it's so important don't come
[1:43:19] to church with something OD against
[1:43:20] someone in your heart that's don't come
[1:43:22] with resentment don't come with
[1:43:24] unforgiveness don't come all you know
[1:43:26] the devil will try and scrible us up
[1:43:27] before we get through the door sure
[1:43:28] Sunday morning expect
[1:43:30] it where's your shoes where's this
[1:43:32] where's my I don't know what's you know
[1:43:34] wake up with a headache and all this
[1:43:35] different stuff you know but don't come
[1:43:37] to church with resentment in your heart
[1:43:40] lay it all at the altar just lay it down
[1:43:42] say Lord I'm not I don't want to carry
[1:43:45] this stuff that's not my portion the
[1:43:47] devil you can have a back devil amen
[1:43:50] return it Return to Sender yeah see it's
[1:43:53] just just as that eagle recognized who
[1:43:55] the mother was it's going to re it's
[1:43:58] it's got to realize it see only that
[1:43:59] John Do's God's attribute that became a
[1:44:01] word spoken and then the Holy Ghost
[1:44:03] seeks that word out here it is he calls
[1:44:05] him gives him everlasting life and
[1:44:07] brings him into the presence of God
[1:44:09] God's
[1:44:10] word hallelujah he sought you out yeah
[1:44:14] you know we should be very thankful that
[1:44:16] God visits us
[1:44:18] here we shouldn't take it for granted we
[1:44:21] really honestly shouldn't take it for
[1:44:23] granted that the great Eternal God would
[1:44:25] say I'm going to come to 113 George
[1:44:27] Street soaks Valley today I'm going to
[1:44:29] visit my children or maybe you're at
[1:44:31] home and he comes down or you're driving
[1:44:32] the car he comes down or prayer meeting
[1:44:34] wherever it is we should never take it
[1:44:36] for granted oh God God's obligated to me
[1:44:38] because I'm his child hold on hold
[1:44:42] on it's not us dictating to God to get
[1:44:45] him to do stuff we should be he found us
[1:44:48] you didn't find him right Hallelujah we
[1:44:51] should be very thankful every time he
[1:44:53] visits us and we should cherish it and
[1:44:56] we should just Rejoice say thank you
[1:44:58] Lord that you would deem it fit to come
[1:45:00] this day now Faith as I say overrides
[1:45:03] natural laws King David was a man of
[1:45:07] faith and he would he would have a lot
[1:45:10] of different situations in life and we
[1:45:12] know that things will come into our life
[1:45:14] to really prove what's in us right and
[1:45:17] it's not the good things it's it's the
[1:45:18] bad things we really prove what's in you
[1:45:22] Hallelujah right it'll prove it is it
[1:45:24] you know are you a are you a Everlasting
[1:45:27] fountain flowing forth or you a bitter
[1:45:30] stream sweet or Bitter Water what's
[1:45:32] going to come out because it can only be
[1:45:34] one it's not a
[1:45:35] mix so here we have when David came to
[1:45:38] Barum behold there came out a man of the
[1:45:41] family of the House of Saul whose man
[1:45:43] whose name was shimi the son of G Gira
[1:45:46] he came forth and cursed still as he
[1:45:48] came and he cast stones at David and all
[1:45:51] the Servants of the king all all the
[1:45:53] Servants of King David and all the
[1:45:55] people and all the mighty men were on
[1:45:57] his right hand and on his left so this
[1:45:59] is David on the run from
[1:46:01] Absalon and now here's here's a man
[1:46:04] who's from the house of Saul which was
[1:46:05] David's enemies he's like now's my
[1:46:07] opportunity kick him when he's down
[1:46:09] we're going to kick him when he's down
[1:46:10] I'm going to get my revenge I've always
[1:46:11] wanted to tell David what I think of
[1:46:14] him right now's my opportunity so thus
[1:46:18] shimi when he cursed he said come out
[1:46:20] come out thou bloody man thou man of B
[1:46:23] the Lord hath returned upon thee all the
[1:46:25] blood of the House of Saul in whose
[1:46:27] stead thou H has reigned and the Lord
[1:46:29] has delivered the kingdom into the hand
[1:46:31] of Absalon thy son and behold Thou Art
[1:46:33] taken in thy Mischief because thou art a
[1:46:35] bloody man then said abashi the son of
[1:46:39] zura however you say that unto the king
[1:46:41] why should this dead dog curse my Lord
[1:46:44] the king let me go over I pray thee and
[1:46:46] take off his head
[1:46:48] Hallelujah and the King said what have I
[1:46:52] to do with you so now here we are let's
[1:46:54] just set a inene we all know the story
[1:46:57] David just needs to speak a word and
[1:46:59] this guy is going to be a dead
[1:47:01] dog right so life and death is in the
[1:47:05] power of the tongue remember this is all
[1:47:07] happening to see David what's in you
[1:47:09] when you're down when the chips are down
[1:47:11] when you're on the Run not when you're
[1:47:13] Victorious standing on the body of
[1:47:15] Goliath and cutting his head off or
[1:47:17] doing whatever he's done in great
[1:47:18] Triumph no what's in you when you're
[1:47:20] down David
[1:47:22] hallelujah hallelujah you know the
[1:47:24] reason is that God wants to prove to you
[1:47:26] what's in you yes sir he wants to show
[1:47:29] you really what's in the depth of thy
[1:47:30] heart what's really in you and so David
[1:47:34] just could speak a word
[1:47:36] abashi let him die slowly or you know
[1:47:39] whatever cut off his
[1:47:40] head and the King said what have I to do
[1:47:43] with you ye sons of zura so let him
[1:47:46] curse because the Lord has said unto him
[1:47:49] curse David now I have not read in any
[1:47:53] of this passage of scripture where David
[1:47:55] says to shimi hold on shimi can you stop
[1:47:58] throwing stones at me I want to ask you
[1:47:59] a question did the Lord tell you to do
[1:48:02] this he found it
[1:48:05] anywhere but what he did is because he
[1:48:07] was a man of Faith he was a living
[1:48:09] Stone he attributed whatever happened to
[1:48:12] him in life that God allowed
[1:48:14] it so he didn't take it personally he
[1:48:17] said no actually God's allowing this
[1:48:19] whole
[1:48:20] circumstance and he was bold enough to
[1:48:22] say actually the Lord spoke to him yeah
[1:48:25] and said go curse
[1:48:26] David because the Lord had said unto him
[1:48:29] curse David what shall I what shall then
[1:48:31] say who shall so who shall then say
[1:48:34] wherefore hast thou done so and David
[1:48:36] said to abash to all of us and to all
[1:48:38] his servants behold my son which came
[1:48:41] forth of my bow seeketh my life how much
[1:48:43] more now may this benjamite do let him
[1:48:46] alone let him curse for the Lord hath
[1:48:49] bidden him amen now what would have we
[1:48:53] done if we were in this
[1:48:55] place let's stick the
[1:48:58] guy is that what we would have
[1:49:01] done I'm a Believer are you I'm anointed
[1:49:03] I'm anointed positionally placed as the
[1:49:05] king of Israel I'm an adopted son in the
[1:49:08] body I've been walking with the Lord I'm
[1:49:10] walking in the message of the hour I'm
[1:49:12] not in a former age under the leadership
[1:49:13] of Saul I'm walking in the present truth
[1:49:16] the books come open to me Hallelujah the
[1:49:20] vision the pattern of the temples come
[1:49:22] to me I got to lay up the materials for
[1:49:23] my son to build the
[1:49:25] temple I'm I'm under the eagle
[1:49:29] anointing but what is our
[1:49:32] response when everyday life
[1:49:35] happens you want to get the sword and
[1:49:38] you know kill a lot of
[1:49:41] people because remember the battle is
[1:49:43] the
[1:49:45] Lords because after this when David
[1:49:47] returns in power who was the first in
[1:49:50] line to beg forgiveness
[1:49:54] shimi
[1:49:56] was this guy he was first in line to be
[1:49:59] on his knees biging for forgiveness when
[1:50:02] David returned in
[1:50:04] power Hallelujah and it was actually
[1:50:07] shim's character that caused him to die
[1:50:10] because David told shimi or I think it
[1:50:13] was um um Solomon he said listen shimi
[1:50:16] you stay in Jerusalem that's right if
[1:50:18] you leave you'll die and then after a
[1:50:21] while he two of his servants go to to
[1:50:23] the land of the Philistines and he goes
[1:50:25] after them so his own character brought
[1:50:28] his
[1:50:29] downfall my Lord Jesus may may our
[1:50:31] character not bring our downfall May our
[1:50:34] own character not bring our downfall
[1:50:36] Lord May Our Lives be may we be new
[1:50:38] creatures in you may it not be our
[1:50:40] Humanity you following me May it not be
[1:50:43] our our our human self that causes our
[1:50:45] own downfall that when our brother and
[1:50:48] sister are on the run because of
[1:50:49] something we don't say well I told you
[1:50:51] so
[1:50:53] I knew it was in them see i' I've been
[1:50:56] waiting for
[1:50:58] this Lord help
[1:51:01] us what's in us
[1:51:08] friends that brother Braham says that
[1:51:11] shimi was crippled up in his Doctrine he
[1:51:15] says this in the spoken word is the
[1:51:16] Original Seed and we know Doctrine is a
[1:51:19] is a principle or position
[1:51:22] so he was crippled up in his Doctrine
[1:51:26] and basically what he believed was kick
[1:51:27] him when he's down here's the enemy
[1:51:29] here's my chance but is this how a
[1:51:31] Christian should be remember to be a
[1:51:33] Lively Stone you know we think about all
[1:51:35] the books come open we by being partaker
[1:51:38] of the word we've taken the book we've
[1:51:39] eaten the book now we're prophesying
[1:51:41] again and the mighty Angels here and you
[1:51:42] know all these Mighty things of Thunders
[1:51:44] coming forth from the presence of God
[1:51:46] and you know you the world will hear
[1:51:48] directly from God as he did on the day
[1:51:49] of Pentecost and you know all these
[1:51:51] things but how does equate to everyday
[1:51:53] life cuz it's easy to be caught up in
[1:51:55] the seven everything I think as um you
[1:51:59] know we heard at camp but what about
[1:52:01] everyday life when when when there's
[1:52:03] ought done against us where things
[1:52:05] happen that we don't expect what are we
[1:52:06] going to do sure we should stand for the
[1:52:09] word and you know we should conduct
[1:52:11] things a certain way but are we looking
[1:52:12] for the death of someone are we looking
[1:52:14] for the Deliverance of
[1:52:16] someone amen what are you looking for so
[1:52:19] the Lord told them to do that amen
[1:52:21] hallelujah that's right
[1:52:25] and here we are Jesus would stand the
[1:52:27] son of David would tell pilate pilate
[1:52:29] says don't you know I have the power to
[1:52:31] release thee or the power to crucify
[1:52:33] thee and Jesus answered thou couldst
[1:52:35] have no power at all against me except
[1:52:36] to be given from thee from above
[1:52:39] therefore he that delivered me unto thee
[1:52:40] hath the greatest sin so everything that
[1:52:43] happens in life you know this world is
[1:52:45] falling
[1:52:46] apart there's people coming into
[1:52:48] positions and they're doing all
[1:52:49] different kinds of things the only
[1:52:51] reason they're in those position is God
[1:52:53] has allowed them to be there remember it
[1:52:56] says in the Book of Revelation he will
[1:52:57] put it in their hearts to fulfill God's
[1:53:00] will even though they're not aware that
[1:53:02] it's going on so can we can we walk in
[1:53:06] this Fallen World hey this world's not
[1:53:07] going to get better
[1:53:10] sorry doesn't matter how many rats I
[1:53:13] catch how many more maybe toys and wood
[1:53:15] pigeons I see ker do I see this world's
[1:53:18] going to you it's going to have a
[1:53:20] burning off there going to be a new
[1:53:21] heavens and new earth right but I still
[1:53:23] like to see tues and K do and different
[1:53:25] things so so I kill rats right but you
[1:53:27] know it's not all we can't say as I as I
[1:53:30] said a while ago Predator free what 2030
[1:53:32] or 2050 we'll get it one day that's in
[1:53:36] the Millennium we be Predator free but
[1:53:37] you know but all these things the world
[1:53:39] is falling apart but Lord Jesus help us
[1:53:42] to
[1:53:43] realize because we're living stones we
[1:53:45] should have the mind of Christ to be
[1:53:47] able to look beyond what these five
[1:53:49] senses declare and our reality is now
[1:53:52] now we are walking up into
[1:53:55] glory amen as brother Brenham would see
[1:53:58] the preview of the bride and he saw the
[1:54:00] first church come forth and white
[1:54:02] garments and everything right and then
[1:54:04] he saw the different nations come forth
[1:54:05] and America was the worst and you know
[1:54:07] the modern Church coming forth being led
[1:54:09] by a witch and then he saw the preview
[1:54:11] of the because he thought Lord is this
[1:54:12] the best I can give you and his heart
[1:54:15] broken him and you know he says but now
[1:54:17] now be the preview of The Last Day bride
[1:54:20] and they dressed as the first ones yes
[1:54:22] and they singing Onward Christian
[1:54:23] Soldier marching as to war but then some
[1:54:27] some would begin to you know because the
[1:54:29] CU the modern Church would go to a place
[1:54:30] and go walking down but the real bride
[1:54:33] was walking and started going up but
[1:54:35] some at the end they going to start look
[1:54:37] around at what the modern church was
[1:54:40] doing and they were getting out of Step
[1:54:42] getting out of step with the word so
[1:54:45] we're going to be real careful what we
[1:54:46] look at right what's leading us because
[1:54:48] a witch was leading them a witch yours
[1:54:51] ain't going to lead me
[1:54:53] Hallelujah I'm going
[1:54:56] up amen that should be our that should
[1:54:59] be the desire of our heart yes sir
[1:55:01] Hallelujah let's stay in line with this
[1:55:03] word yes sir
[1:55:06] amen Living
[1:55:09] Stones what manner of stones are here
[1:55:12] I'll just I'll just finish with
[1:55:17] this
[1:55:19] now there there would have been a lot of
[1:55:21] laws pass in the
[1:55:23] UN if the countries who had the right to
[1:55:26] veto did not veto doesn't matter what
[1:55:28] they were they had the authority to veto
[1:55:30] they vetoed or the president or whatever
[1:55:33] more but why so if that's the
[1:55:37] case should we not use our power of
[1:55:41] veto the devil has a
[1:55:43] scheme this is the future for your
[1:55:45] family's life this is where they're
[1:55:47] going to go are you just going to sit
[1:55:49] back or you going to veto the thing and
[1:55:51] say no no no devil my Revelation
[1:55:54] declares unto me that thy and thy seed
[1:55:58] the God's word will be in the mouth of
[1:56:01] you and thy seed and thy seed seed
[1:56:03] that's what it says in Isaiah Hallelujah
[1:56:05] and the promises unto you and your
[1:56:06] children those are far off even as many
[1:56:08] as the Lord Our God shall call right
[1:56:10] that is that is the promise so we should
[1:56:12] use our power of veto because if you've
[1:56:14] received the Holy Ghost the second part
[1:56:16] of that's for
[1:56:17] you if I received it then the promise is
[1:56:20] to my children because the first part
[1:56:23] worked I've seen it live then the second
[1:56:24] part will live and those that are far
[1:56:26] off maybe Wayward ones or whoever more
[1:56:28] it's for them too Hallelujah so we have
[1:56:31] to we must use our god-given Authority
[1:56:34] Amen to veto the devil's plans your
[1:56:37] faith will
[1:56:38] override
[1:56:40] Hallelujah whatever the devil wants to
[1:56:42] do amen we have the authority to do it
[1:56:45] yes sir it's now time why was that song
[1:56:48] so powerful last last Sunday because
[1:56:51] people was saying not today they said it
[1:56:54] see we have to address the enemy you've
[1:56:56] got to address the issue right you've
[1:56:58] got to stand there and draw a line and
[1:56:59] say no more Satan you must obey my voice
[1:57:03] just as Pharaoh had to eventually let
[1:57:05] the children of Israel out of Egypt
[1:57:07] right he had to obey the voice of Moses
[1:57:11] amen we have the same and we're under
[1:57:13] the blood of Jesus Christ not under the
[1:57:15] blood of bulls and goats Hallelujah so
[1:57:17] we should stand and say no devil not
[1:57:20] today oh maybe if someone else says it
[1:57:22] no no you've got to say it that's right
[1:57:24] you've got to look your enemy in the eye
[1:57:25] and say I'm done amen you're getting out
[1:57:27] of here I'm not I'm not putting up with
[1:57:29] you a single
[1:57:31] day
[1:57:33] Hallelujah
[1:57:35] faith is perfect it doesn't know defeat
[1:57:39] it brings things when when there's no
[1:57:41] things and uh to be brought Faith
[1:57:43] creates Faith takes doubt away takes
[1:57:45] negative and makes
[1:57:47] positive that's the kind of faith that
[1:57:49] we have right now oh one day I'll get
[1:57:51] that Faith No no no you got that Faith
[1:57:53] right now you got to use that Faith the
[1:57:55] faith you have just just put into action
[1:57:57] and see what happens Hallelujah there's
[1:58:01] demon Spirits you fighting you battles
[1:58:03] whatever oppression whatever it may be
[1:58:05] you tell it not today amen amen I don't
[1:58:08] know my future you've got a
[1:58:11] future Hallelujah I don't know how this
[1:58:13] is I don't know how I'm going to get
[1:58:14] healed of this thing no faith will
[1:58:16] create a healing Hallelujah faith will
