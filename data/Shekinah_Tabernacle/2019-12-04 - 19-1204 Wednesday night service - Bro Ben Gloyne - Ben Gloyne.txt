roots the leaves just open up and they become nice and lush and what it does is provide shade to worship Him to fellowship and under the shady green pastures and I believe that tonight we can fellowship with him in the cool of the evening I believe that tonight as a night where we can just realize that he has here that the Lord said and their tongues of interpretation he said he said that

scripture to us all I'm sure speaking of Gideon and it came an angel of the Lord which set under an oak which was an offer that pertain earth under joash the Ebro sight and his son gideon thresh sweet by the winepress to hide it from the Midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto Him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor and Gideon said unto Him o my lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us and deliver us into the hand of the Midianites and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the middie i'ts Midianites have not i sent thee and he said unto Him o my lord where Worth shall I save Israel behold my family is poor and Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I'll be with thee and now shall smite the Midian it's as one man let's go to Matthew chapter 27 it's just a scripture I you know we've been reading it around the dinner table and I just can't seem to get it out of me let's go to Matthew 27 and we're gonna read verses 8 to 10 let's read rather from verse 3 of Matthew 27 then Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood and they said unto Him what is that to us see that to that and he cast down the piece of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the Treasury because it is the price of blood and they took counsel and they brought with them the potter's field to bury strangers and where for that field was called the field of blood unto this day then it was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the Prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of Israel did value amen let's bow heads in a word of Prayer gracious Lord Jesus truly your name is the sweetest name Lord something about you Lord you're so wonderful to us thank you dear Lord Jesus when we stand that day on the other side we'll truly say it's all you Lord and now you've bought a safely home thank you dear God we have a foretaste of that home Lord as we feel your spirit move among us and in us dear God as you put in your word twelve souls or the shows that we come from another world and this is not our final destination dear God I just want to commit this congregation of people into your hands Lord they're yours Lord they've always been yours I pray you'll be with them while we're away and be with us as we travel - dear God father may you Lord be glorified and everything said and done Lord Jesus Lord and I just asked their God that you'd be a brother ooomph Arnie oh god disease having the biopsy I believe today Lord and South Africa Lord may all go well father I want to thank you you are his healing my Lord Jesus law that father thank you for doctors but you have a little bit heals all our diseases so we just left brother finally into your presence by prayer praying you're touching my Lord and may all be well father it's one also pray for brother could be a new hood is back at work today dear Lord Jesus father I pray you'd restore his back Lord he needs that back my Lord Jesus father I pray it strengthen them and heal them Lord father may you bless him dear God we just want to commit them into your hands and father also this coming week dear Lord this law of the convention up in Papua New Guinea Lord with these twelve odd denominational churches have come out they want to embrace you in this hour though and embrace the message of this day and lord I pray there be a mighty harvest their God may there be a Great Awakening O Lord of nets in that country my Lord Jesus anoint the brothers ministering my Lord may the devil have no room to move at all father may you just have preeminence in those services did God and father may your spirit fall on each one dear Lord and seal them into the kingdom dear God and father may this be the beginning of a great sweeping revival that will go through that country and into the country surrounding Lord may you grant a dear God in Jesus Christ's name any other needs that are among us dear Lord you you see the burdens on our hearts the questions we have law the battles we face so father may you come and take our battles my god father for your glory in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats so here we here we have Gideon and and get in here he's living in the promised land you know he's he's living in his inheritance but yet because how the enemy has coming he's hiding himself away trying to Thresh wheat in secret afraid of what the enemy will do while he is in his position it's amazing where you know how how you know Gideon was a scriptural man brother Branham says and when he and when he when when the angel Lord came to him he asked them a very good question if God is with us where are the miracles where is that God our fathers fathers told us about and we understand brother Brown would say and spoke the spoken word as the original seed he says he says and the Pentecostals will do the same thing talk about denominating they that original revival in the Holy Ghost fell and called out a people and God trying to get his word to it and they organ I said sit over here denominated and died right there you say but look at what they're doing we'll get to that later on today see we're coming right down I'm just putting seated now now I'm going to show you after all what happened that's why each revival he says each generation has its revival God raises him up a man sits him with us word and he starts out with a message for that age I mean to every generation and I just want to anchor this and every generation must have its own revival not just the parents or not just the children but every generation has a chance at the word every generation has must have its own revival where God lives in them I mean that's not just the tradition not just something that's done because well this is what my family does but God becomes a Living God I mean that he is the same yesterday today and forever so every generation must have its own revival there's more than one generation sitting here tonight I mean each generation sitting here tonight must have its own revival not that we just conform to what our parents tell us or maybe what the church tells us but God comes and loves God manifests himself God changes our nature that the things no one has to tell us what to do what not to do God's nature just governs our lives and what he doesn't want us to do there's something in us is I don't want it hallelujah see every generation must have its own revival Gideon needed a revival hallelujah they had mighty testimonies but God had to become real to Gideon now Gideon even though he was a circumcised Azra light he was living in his inheritance the problem with Gideon as he was he was he was living out the name of his tribe now Manasseh means causes causes to forget and I know I've covered this a while ago but here we are again you know he was living out his tribes name causing to forget so he was causing to forget who he was he thought well this is just a situation in life the enemies come and they're too much for us you know but I'm here I'm gonna get a bit a week and a try and survive in my own little way just try and you know just just survive the season but he actually forgot that the god that was with Moses the God that was with Joshua the God that was you know with all the believers were still the same God he had not changed you say why are you talking about these each generation must have its own revival where God comes and lives in your life more than just excitement more than just a bunch of noise but a living word putting on flesh in you I mean but Gideon's first name actually means a fella isn't as as in a warrior he wasn't a worry he was afraid but notice when the angel Lord came to he says Gideon thou art a mighty man of Valor and when any knew he was the one who was ordained of them in the book I mean he he realized he was a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Abraham hallelujah and you can take even even John the Baptist parents here and he was here with Zechariah and the temple being a priest then the angel Lord comes to know that Gabriel came to came to him said you're gonna have the son and he's gonna fall run the Christ hallelujah so then so the angel came to reveal who they were in the scripture he was more than just a priest how they're more than just part of a man's system of religion he is more than as part of the scripture I took the angel Lord to come to him to reveal him this is who you are in the word and once he knew who he was and he could operate he could live according to what the scripture said he was same thing with Gideon Gideon was never ordained to be hiding in a cave threshing wheat afraid of his enemy that was not as true identity has tried then he was here is your portion here is your inheritance dwelling your inheritance dwell in peace any enemy comes and you get rid of him you kick them out I mean this is your luck this is your portion of my word you come and live in it that was his identity but he forgot who he was he didn't realize who he was and that's the problem that's why people can't be stuck between two opinions too much the world tells them they're one thing and God says they're another thing and they don't know who they are hallelujah but when God comes and tells you who you are then you can sit back it doesn't matter there see what the enemy tries to do and timid ain't you whatever more you don't have to please no one but God who you amen so whenever the angel of Lord comes to a person he reveals to them who they are in the scripture hallelujah amen it's the same thing with you and I Francie we have that same angels come to us that mighty angel Christ himself has come with an open book in this hour and that's just not a theory that's a reality I mean when you heard this message and it quicken your soul God is showing you who you are in the word he's wanting you to know who you are hallelujah so it's not a tradition it's a reality but the thing is that's yeah and there's a reason I read that scripture and Matthew they value Jesus the price of a slave because that's what they were told that's just what they did but his true value was lost upon them and how you value him is how you treat him they value him as a beelzebub Iza renegade he's just here to tear up our churches you know bring trouble and all these things let's just get rid of him they didn't value who he was and this word this message is Jesus Christ what value do you put upon it what value do you put on this and your life will actually be the answer of that question not what you say with this it's your life that's loved that's that's that's the proof or the evidence of you know what what value you put upon it because if you put the right value on it then you'll get the what it's intended for many people came to Jesus to get healed that's the only value they put upon him amen many people got healed and God will heal anyone that comes to him many people came up before brother Branham in the prayer line he just prayed for them they got healed the respective of who they were saved lost whatever didn't matter what denomination what part of life what religion even he just prayed for them and God healed them but you got to go more than just so well I need ya I ever need in my body or even you know oh I want a good family or you know oh I want a good you know a lot of people they come round churches looking for a spouse cause I see value but you gotta look more than just that oh I want a good family therefore I'll be a believer it's more than that I mean oh I just want to you know I just want to have peace in my home more than that I mean all those things are good but it's more than they just like the promised land man fly land flowing with milk and honey that sounds like a good place but there was more value in that land been a land flowing with milk and honey but it was a spiritual that really caught the value of the land I mean when Jacob I mean I mean when when when Joseph when Joseph died he knew all about tombs you know the Egyptians built tombs but he told he he told us roll when you leave and you will leave because God said you're gonna leave take my bones don't leave them here take them with you when God comes and takes you take me out of this place I mean when his father died he didn't get buried in Egypt his he was spiritual he said go bury me in the promised land and he was buried in the Cave of Machpelah where Abraham buried Sarah and Abraham was buried in the patriarchs are buried there why because they saw the true value of the land hallelujah they saw the true value of the promise then well what do you mean what does the value meet wouldn't there be better terms in Egypt there were better tombs incredible tombs a lot of man-hours and energy went into building those things but it missed one thing there wasn't a resurrection going to happen in that land sure God is God everybody there was a resurrection happening in a certain land and that's why them who are spiritual say don't bury me here bury me there bury me over Jordan bear me in the promised land because the scripture tells us when Christ arose many of the Saints arose with him why those that were buried in the promised land where the resurrection was going to happen they died under expectation I'm not going to stay in the grave one's going to come and get me out of the grave and one did come holy and our rose when he rose why because they saw the true value of the land and it's the same thing with this message it makes nice people it makes decent human beings does it not makes good children does it not it makes good husbands good wives good fathers good mothers does it not it makes good churches does it not but it's more than that it's more than that that's not even it hallelujah the real value is the resurrection life of Jesus Christ that's the real value but you've got it so but it depends if you see that value in it you just give your whole life to the word Lord take my life and make it on whatever complex whatever thing that's bothering me whatever it might be take it out of me look come and live I mix this not that yo a revival brother Ram says it needs to be a killing before there's a revival there's going to be a death before a life can come amen see if you want God to fill you with us Holy Ghost you got to die you lay all your all your ambitions hopes and plans everything everything you wants value does good counted dung and place it on the altar Lord this is no good this is rubbish take my life and change me hallelujah he knows that an amazing isn't an amazing where the one the sacrifice the the real sacrifice was walking among Israel our Lord Jesus Christ the sacrifice was on the grounds brother Bram sees in the in the indictment they didn't even understand it here he was wouldn't that be an incredible thing here's the one walking he's going to wash my sins away he's got the payment he's got the purchasing power in his life he's walking there do not just redeem me but the whole world I mean to undo sin destroy the works the devil he's walking around holly has got what I have need of and they valued him the price of a slave and said availing him as the Lord of glory the only one that could undo it their traditions couldn't do it their sincerity couldn't do it nothing they could do could do it could actually undo the Sun curse that they were born under but that one but this one hallelujah it was walking on the grounds a man that sacrifice was there and we know that the word is Messiah hallelujah the word in every age is Messiah the word came to Noah get in the ark those that believed that it received it got on the ark what they got saved there are others perished I mean when Moses came down into Egypt that was the word coming to deliver them it was Messiah was it not oh yeah Jonathan yeah I mean I mean Elijah amount comma what was that that was Messiah coming that was a deliverance from from bail worship and idolatry in the land Messiah came the word came hallelujah his Jesus he's Messiah the word is Messiah amen that's why you've got to believe the word and you'll receive what the messiahs amen but today people turn it into a tradition and I and I'm talking here by the way not talking about I'm not they can do what they're doing we're here we're here that's the same thing with Christians today isn't assigning a card that will come to Sunday school so many days of so many Sundays in a year it isn't taking a pledge that you won't drink no more for six months it isn't that isn't laying your hands it's laying your hands upon God's provided sacrifices pardon the heat of Jesus Christ and feeling the tears of the flesh at Calvary and then identifying yourself with him in Baptism that as he died and rose again so you had died so sorry sorry so you are buried in his name to rise in newness of life to walk as a new creature in Christ when you do it with sincerity done this Jehovah's bidding so he feels justified speaking about Jew taking a sacrifice to the temple now the Jew could be justified because he did what Joe what Jehovah bid him to do that was right Jehovah did did that and that was what he required but finally it became a family tradition that come Atonement day and maybe the Jews had been doing what was wrong and said well I believe it's a toment day I would better take my lamb down see it became a family tradition they didn't go that was sincerely they just did it because the families had done it that's just the thing we do all the families do it we should do it too and that's exactly where our Christianity has God that's just exactly where our Pentecostal movements are coming to it's a family tradition now listen someone's got to break the cycle someone's got to break that cycle of it just becoming a tradition this is not this messages the first generation comes in with a ball of flame and God living and vindicating himself and signs and miracles and wonders in the next generation comes in and just conforms to it this is not what this is not why we're here every generation must have its own revival you say well are you trying to put a push of Supernatural Pentecostal gospel absolutely because you're going to understand God doesn't subtract right Luther came with justification the just shall live by faith and then Wesley came with signification did God do away with justification no right hallelujah and then the Pentecostals came with the restoration of the gifts did God do well sent if occasion just occasion no he added to it and now when the word comes himself hallelujah he doesn't take away with what has done it just actually magnifies what has been hallelujah so absolutely God is a God of the supernatural hallelujah his word has always been supernatural I mean when it's received into a sincere heart with faith it will produce a supernatural life hallelujah say yes I am pushing us supernatural Pentecostal gospel right because it's all part of it knowing who you are an adoption it's all part of it B don't take away with the first things hallelujah right isn't that right Amen sir someone's gotta break the cycle amen no see that's exactly where our Pentecostal movements are coming to it's a family tradition see when I talk about Pentecost I don't talk about Azusa Street Pentecost I talk about the original God coming and dwelling in his people more than just an anointing but God dwelling in the soul of the believer walking in them for filling us word you take the Book of X it's the Acts of the Holy Spirit and the Apostles that's the book of Acts the Gospels are the scaffold work but the book of Acts records the life on display a man a brother am says that this this last day there'll be another book of Acts written hallelujah and here you are in this day hallelujah so the life of God and you will write a book of Acts you don't have to try at will his life will do it why cuz the word is manifesting hallelujah so when the seals come up and what they're to do it released a part of the church to break the cycle of revival and death how why I just jumped in so here we are well how could you because the reason the reason the Ephesian Church for a seasoned member of the you know in the book of Acts for a season the church was at its first love there was a season where the Antichrist spirit had not come in to file it was in perfect harmony with the bridegroom but it didn't have the book open it had to and then it became the Ephesian Church age around 80 50 something why but then but then the first complaint against that age was you have left your first love so that church had already fallen from a place wiping and we know Ephesus means aimed at and relaxed so they aimed at the high call in Christ but they relaxed I mean so they then obtained what they were aiming to become and so then it eventually went down to the dark ages we know God said I will restore hallelujah but now God has to send a power to the church that will break that cycle that we don't just come back to where the Ephesians were and then I met relaxing go back down because there's no more Church ages we're at the end God must restore his bride right so now God has to send a power to the church is going to send a word into the church that will break that cycle that we don't just come back to where they were in the first church but we ascend right hallelujah so now it says in Hebrews 1 and 1 yeah we got opens his word it brings a revival every revival is caused by an opening of the word amen now we read Hebrews 1 and 3 he says who being in the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high now notice it says upholding all things by the word of his power so not by the I'm just this is not a twist of words but it does not say the power of his word but it's the word of as power so when when his word is released it releases a power amen when Moses went down into Egypt and released his word God's Word released a power that took the people from slavery into sonship right and took them from slavery in Egypt I mean he God released his word which released an anointing of power upon the people those who received that word became placed as sons in in the promised land you take Caleb and Joshua they were slaves right they they heard the same thing scorned atha hood but because they received it in faith it actually translated them from being slaves then Caleb's hip give me my Mountain and the reason he could say that is because a POW was released to him by the word and that day they said now this is mine as inheritance his mind and he received that inheritance why because God's released his power through his word hallelujah amen every age is the same thing how did Luther come out receive powder came out of Catholicism it was quickened to him the just shall live by faith the Reformation was on Wesley the same way--with he was reading Luther's Co mature in the book of Romans he says is a warming in his heart what happened there's a power released hallelujah and we come all the way down here down to this age finally God has opened his word he's loose the seals off the book hallelujah which is released the seven thunders to us and brother mjozwell what are the seven thunders they are the revelation of the seven seals I mean so as the work comes open it releases a power to you hallelujah which gives you an overcoming walk hallelujah basically what a what you should be doing right now as you say now that's why I kick the devil down I'm just I'm just giving you explanation just like you read the book of Ephesians Paul is telling the Ephesians what they have and where they're going he says he says you heard you believed you trusted you're sealed by the Holy Ghost I mean you're quicker and you once walked according to the Prince of power of the year but you're quickened you're alive you don't do that anymore you came out from darkness now in glorious light and this is where we're going but they had already had those experiences they were already sealed into Kingdom but Paul was saying this is what happened to you hallelujah well why are you saying the same thing because you got to realize what God has done for you but not just stay there you got to walk on I mean because Gideon the angel came to Gideon he says you're a mighty man of Valor go and I might so he had been awakened there was there was a revival on but now you've got actually go under the effects of that revival you following me I mean because it's well you know the brighter revival is on hallelujah absolutely it is brother Brahim says in the third seal there's been nothing to stir the bride there's been millions come and denomination all kinds of things but nothing has has been seen to stir the bride yet he says he'll take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up see the bride hasn't had a revival you see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to show the bride yet we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again yeah he'll send it he promised it now watch and then so that's a 1963 than a 1964 he's asked the question have the seven thunders I mean have the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but as yet but are not known to us as the thunders yet brother Graham says no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about they was to reveal the seven thunders had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but is forbidden to ride he said but the seventh angel the days of a sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed in the seventh angel as a messenger of the seventh church age so he so he's saying when the seals are coming up he says well there hasn't been a you know those seven thunders haven't add their voices yet to stir the bride but once the book somebody says no it's happened hallelujah she says there's nothing that I would stir the bride yet but now since it has happened this is there's been a word released into the earth to stir the bride and that's why it's gripped your soul and because it's sent to stir a bride has seemed to awaken a bride to who she is hallelujah amen say well what does this got to do with Gideon everything because Gideon had to be awakened to who he was then he could go into action and actually redeem his inheritance from under the hands of the Midianites and it's the same thing with you and I friends we are not just threshing wheat and secret just all just yo real listen to the message in secret and read my Bible in secret and keep my walk personal and you know or your all your the enemies all around it's so dark but I'll just stay in my cave and I'm just gonna read this and keep it to myself no no no no if life has come life must be expressed if the word has come in has got to be expressed and you can't help but living because God has a life of his own so will impact those around you and you'll have a burden your I'm not willing just to stay as I am hallelujah God was God told Gideon there are a mighty man of Valor and then God actually sent them forth and say I'm gonna prove it to you and it's the same thing with you and I you know your mighty men and woman of Valor why don't you go in my might go in your mind here it was threshing wheat and secret GaN you're my god system God in your mind didn't say your weakness your might and Gideon's like what do you mean Here I am hiding out now you've got mighty power you don't know you have it but you've got to put it into action you gotta let God use it hallelujah be available amen so Gideon is instructed by the Lord to go the first thing he had to do was get rid of the idol out of his father's house that thing that had become very much a permanent fixture there had to be hewed down because why becoming an being an Israelite was just a tradition that my father's father's father's father was so-and-so and this is where I live and this is what we do and you know people become creatures of habit and the devil wants us just to be creatures of habit come to church listen to the message read the Bible discuss things where's the life hey with me it's all good to read and listen and and talk about the word we must do those things but we but the bride in this hour doesn't just have Kennex we need mechanics right we need order but we need the dynamics to come I mean to make the mechanics go hallelujah and ultimately who is the mechanics you're the mechanics I mean but God has to come and fire you off I mean you can actually go forward and I'm not saying that you don't have it but put it into action see you know if the devil can cut your prayer life if he can make you thinking negative about yourself if he can get you thinking negative about people or whatever it may be he's got you don't look at your see Gideon was looking at a situation he was not looking at what God made him to be hallelujah he was looking at a situation of this is going on this is wrong and listen listen this what about who he was what about who you were hallelujah we shouldn't just sit around and just you know someone's got to break the cycle well we've been here for years no who cares about the years Moses is on the back side doesn't backside the desert living under a promise for 40 years but he had to meet an angel it had to become alive and it's the same thing with you and I this is not just a you know this this Christian walk is not well my parents have a testimony and you know and I just agree with their thinking and therefore no no you've got to meet him yourself you must absolutely meet him yourself hello it's not just going well you know can I'm doing this is a tradition a tradition as well some it's a form of behavior it's a form of behavior that's been passed down why do we celebrate Christmas like we do it's been passed down why do we celebrate Easter it's been passed down I could say why do we even read this it's been passed down it's got to go more than why do you listen to the message many of us it's been passed down it's got to go beyond that it's got to go beyond that it's got to be alive to you and the reason you listen to it is not because mummy and daddy and great-uncle whatever whatever you know no it's you and God it was Gideon and God it wasn't Gideon other people as Gideon and God hallelujah it's got to be that way well the brim season the exposition of seven Church ages and this is formally seized let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church it's very important he sees it's in the church the book of Revelation is a bride's book a mint you want to know where you are in time look at the book of Revelation that's why we had the seventh angels ministry was to open the book of Revelation as to show you because it's a book of inheritance well how is it well the devil in here is the lake of fire the beast in here it's the lake of fire that's their portion right the Jews receive what they receive the bride receives New Jerusalem those and and others receive an inheritance round the outside the city it's all the book of inheritance hallelujah but so you got to see now what's mine do you do that oh you know you know we shouldn't be stumbling along blindly just reacting the devil comes in all it's wrecked this person sick oh let's wreck other the spirit does this all its wrecked we shouldn't be that way the devil should be reacted the devil should be guessing what the bride is gonna do hallelujah isn't that right he should be wake it all yo you always got some little devil watching oh they're awake breaker breaker when they're gonna do today you know oh they're awake oh no you know what are they gonna do it shouldn't be well they're so predictable you know no pray you know I mean don't put God in the box don't put your walk in a box you know the devil should be guessing what are they gonna do today hallelujah any and and the devil will try and stop you doing what you want to do every day why do you think the Edict when doubted to stop Daniel praying here was a man calling upon God and it wasn't just words of the year finally yet the angel came to him and won't he say you're highly beloved you're highly loved that's what the angel first said to him so therefore because you're highly loved I'm going to show you the time of the end in the book how that you know where you are and you know it's gonna happen all the way down through and that's why how we know we're high love God says I'm gonna show you what's in the book I'm gonna show you who you are hallelujah where you are and where you're going and what you got to do to get there hallelujah isn't that right that's why we need to pray for revelation more than anything amen amen this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows us a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature and he's just as immutable in his ways the Satan knows us surely that the original Church at Pentecost were the power of God mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all houses false it has to be now remember this Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless that exposes Satan revealing his works which is the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time when he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she stands for I mean what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army and what does the devil what the devil doesn't want you to get that revelation amen that's like that's like God know this is a very crude way of saying first life God wants to send you a package and the devil knows if you get that package he's defeated do you think he's going to not try and stop it why that's why you've got that's why tries to cut your prayer life take the sweetness of the Holy Ghost out of your life getting you're looking at circumstance and not at the Word of God getting you worried about things worried has helped no one faith has helped a lot of people Hebrews 11 chapters not by worry it's by faith they say well it's very easy to worry yet us we're human but you gotta cast down reasoning you got to realize Dodds and control of all things at all times it's never a toccata as better it's never out of his hands he knows exactly what's going on and prayer is actually for us for God to change our mind that's what real I think brother and appreciator you know prayer meeting real prayer is God changing our minds to matches word that's not now you know God is not our errand boy they should be in prayer Lord changed my mind to match your word because when we're in harmony then God can work well I think Jesus spent so much time in prayer to stand how many with the God that was in him hallelujah what does that mean our gonna spend our sometimes you might it might just be five seconds God comes down you just pray you for your peace come ease God's heard your prayer you go on so you don't have to put a time you know God can come in a moment or whatever you know what I mean hallelujah now he knows that note so she'll be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he'll be definitely thought that today as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them hallelujah amen now the Apostle Paul he knew exactly who he was why an angel came to him hallelujah more than once you know here he was on the ship you know there were fourteen days whatever in a storm then Paul comes out when it's all you know he says be of a good cheer the angel Lord who who I am and who I serve came to me this night saying don't fear not no one's going to die it's just the boats gonna be destroyed hallelujah so he knew who he was because the angel Lord came to him you say but that's a messenger to an age the same angel can come to you brother Brown says you feel that sweet humble feeling come over you see that's angels drawing near you know when the atmosphere changes in the home or wherever you go you think about God the atmosphere just changes around you what is that that's not just emotion that's God drawing near hallelujah he says why Paul said with no fixing to cut off has hit us you know a seed of Abraham he said death where is thy sting grave where is your victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ he shall possess the gates of his enemy take it now he is not buried at the gate he will conquer it and take it he'll possess it that's in his own power and the Church of the Living God this morning and I'll say tonight lays the power to heal all sickness Church said Amen and the church and living God lays power to overcome all temptation and the possession of the church and living God this morning laser power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Church of Jesus Christ whatever you desire ask in my name it shall be given to you a little while the world that not seed the Unruh generated seed will see me no more yet you will see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world what the royal seed the works that I do shall you do also I'll verify myself that I'm with you and for these signs shall follow them that believe he shall possess the seed of his enemy he shall possess his seed shall possess the gates of his enemy no matter what the gate is of it sickness temptation soon whatever gate it is it's conquered and the seed of Abraham possesses it aren't you happy this morning to know that we stand more than a conquerer more than a conquerer why there's nothing to fight about the fights over the whistles bloat the flag is rose and in the midst of every sin pile every mess of every sick room as the old rugged cross planted by the blood of Jesus Christ a conqueror the only thing we do is believe look and live he says it in possessing the enemy's gate hallelujah do you believe that and the Church of Living God right now is the power to heal all sickness conquer every temptation conquer every devil it lays in you right now hallelujah go on thy mind go on thy might don't be double-minded who are you well I'm such-and-such from such you sure that's your identity when the angel comes to you you see your identities in here amen hallelujah what value I'll just leave with this what Valley do you put upon this word what value you will get whatever value you put upon it how lujah gideon was scared just trying to live out life i'll just get through this it'll change the seasons will change but god's had dinner don't stay like this go and they might what about you every generation has a right they must have their own revival where it's not just discussions that excite as the Living Word of God coming manifested in their lives a supernatural presence comes and lives are you just going after signs and wonders no I'm talk about the word living cuz if you have the word and you you have signs and wonders you'll have healing you'll have deliverance you'll have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll have the power of God you'll have prophecy you have speaking in tongues all those things are in the word hallelujah he said well little old me Gideon thought a little old me and the angel said go on the power of thy might you've been ordained for this hour to overcome how about you you've been ordained you know you've been ordained in this hour to overcome every work of the devil you'll be no danger this hour to actually possess what God has given as yours hallelujah not just to a men ever relax but actually take possession and then a very part of the title deed holy that's not just we're not a bunch of Legion just worshipping because the devil's worshiping God no we are people that are filled with the Holy Ghost and our lives should vindicate and prove it that we're Christians not what we say it's the life that we live how we treat one another the atmosphere around us Amen stop being troubled by a darkened spirit kick kick that thing away you've got to recognize who you are The Devil's trying to BA get down and get you a word and stuff you got to deny that thing resist the devil he shall flee you've got to resist them resistant means you put up resistance he said well the devil keeps handing me and my mind starts singing the songs of the Lord devil you gonna hang around I'm gonna start singing brother and was driving in the cab the devil God and he says fine I'm just gonna sing all the way until you get out and he began to sing in the devil got out hallelujah you know we should never be afraid the devil comes against us Oh what could I do I'm undone you just call on the Lord and he must flee from you it's brother card you sit at camp we are not made for any part of the devil our souls not hers our spirits not hers our bodies not hers our homes aren't hers our families not hers not a part of us are hers hallelujah so let's not put up with them nowhere in any part of our lives he comes against you so just get out what are you doing fall and servant get out you've been fired hey the devil was a servant he got fired he got kicked out of heaven he's the Fallen servant hallelujah you got to read him as notice how lujah hey when the boss fires someone they get fired and if they won't leave the premises security comes and holds them off father you say well the Devils on my property call security call the Holy Ghost say Lord this Devils afflicting me troubling me hallelujah I'm not just saying things to make you happy it's a reality but you what are you gonna speak to him you've got to address your enemy yourself Oh mummy and daddy no no you you've got a show God wants to show what's in you not just someone else but you hallelujah that's why God came to Gideon I'm gonna show you what sudden you get Ian you have no idea you will destroy Midian as one man hallelujah and what happened finally the army will down to 300 because God wants to make it that it's no human ability will will cause a victory 300 and in and then they get in another guy they go sneaking to the camp of the enemy and in the and in the enemy and all their shields and they weapons and their yo-yo they like grasshoppers I said one of them says I had a strange dream something rolled down into the camper just destroyed it and then and then now and it's a wall that there must be Gideon go read the story so now the devil is actually telling I mean the Midianites are telling gideon actually the devil knows the outcome of this battle the Midianites had already and have been actually reveal to them that they were going to be destroyed and the devil bleeds of one god and trembles why does he tremble because he knows the outcome of the battle he knows the lake of fire says and he knows he's going in and nothing can stop him going in that lake hallelujah what do you yours just like it's just like you know we know Rahab's in Jericho what does she start testifying to to the spies the hearts of our mighty men have just melted because of what God has done they're living in fear we're gonna keep this place sealed up it looked impressive Jericho did but it was fear keeping it together what is the devil's Kingdom governed by fear what's he trying to make you do fear that's why Jesus said love thy enemies love those that you know use you and persecute you what ever more love them the reason you do it is so you don't come under the anointing that's on them when the maniac came before brother brems they're gonna tear you limb from limb he sped him yeah yeah yeah you know spit him in the face this great big man brother Brown was a boxer the devil was trying to give to use his physical ability to defeat him but brother Hannah stayed in a spiritual atmosphere and he actually felt sorry for the guy here's the guy's gonna break him limb from limb actually felt sorry for him because he was caged by a demon power that's how love rejected and that's how God won the victory then that hit devil in that place fell and then and then he was pulled off brother Brown's feet by the police or whoever it was and their brother had started preaching after that and then people just were getting supernaturally healed in the meeting why because the head devil fell and all the others knew they're defeated as well and and the devil's power broke right then in there I say that was 60 odd years ago God still the same the devil is still the same divine love will conquer all things I mean let's have the musicians come shall we hallelujah amen God wants to put you to the test to show you what's in you hallelujah so I'm going through
