[29:56] Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can
[29:59] have your
[30:00] seats
[30:01] [Music]
[30:04] amen so the first scripture that I want
[30:08] to to read to you today is in First
[30:11] Peter um chapter
[30:15] 5 thank you
[30:19] m so the Bible says be sober be vigilant
[30:24] because your adversary the devil as a
[30:27] roaring lion walkth about seeking who he
[30:30] made devor seeking he's not sitting down
[30:33] he's
[30:35] seeking whom resist steadfast in the
[30:38] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[30:40] are accomplished in your brethren that
[30:44] are in the world we are not alone in
[30:46] this yeah but the but the God of all
[30:50] Grace who had called us unto his eternal
[30:53] glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have
[30:56] suffered a while make you perfect
[30:59] establish strengthen settle you to him
[31:03] be glory and Dominion forever and ever
[31:06] amen amen
[31:09] amen so today I want to talk about this
[31:12] subject beware of lions Beware of the
[31:17] lion
[31:20] and if you want under your own
[31:24] risk live Jesus under your own own risk
[31:29] yeah cuz the devil is trying to destroy
[31:33] you amen so here um I asked on Google
[31:38] about lions and how they
[31:40] hunt so it says here lion stock their
[31:45] prey the lion the devil he has been
[31:49] watching you he knows exactly what
[31:52] you're thinking he's a
[31:55] cleav um oh you could call this it's a
[31:59] CLI Spirit he has been in this world for
[32:01] 6,000 years he know man he know exactly
[32:05] what you thinking he knows you he knows
[32:07] you very well he knows your soft spot he
[32:11] knows how to get you absolutely well we
[32:14] have a greater God With Us amen huj so
[32:18] when close enough attempt a
[32:20] short short charge of the prey trying
[32:24] either to pounce on the Target or knock
[32:27] it off
[32:28] how does a lion kills its prey lion
[32:32] kills a prey by breaking its neck or
[32:34] suffocating it by clamping their jaws
[32:37] around its
[32:40] throat so cuz I watched some videos of
[32:44] how lions kill the prey they jump on the
[32:47] leaks of the animal if the animal is Big
[32:49] it's going to jump on the leaks and that
[32:52] animal is not going to be able to come
[32:53] to church anymore that person it's not
[32:57] going to be able able to come to church
[32:59] cuz it grabbed them by the feet and when
[33:03] the animal is down goes for the Thro and
[33:06] that person cannot worship anymore that
[33:08] person is in a horrible stage if you are
[33:12] hunted if you have been prayed of the
[33:15] devil cuz I have in the past you are
[33:19] done in that moment you cannot you don't
[33:22] want to seek from the Lord I don't know
[33:23] why because there's so much sin that the
[33:26] devil make you do what you willingly do
[33:29] knowing the truth that you know that you
[33:33] have done wrong and you don't want to
[33:35] fix it and you just you can't come to
[33:39] church you don't want to come to
[33:41] church and you cannot praise the Lord
[33:44] amen also here the Bible says lions are
[33:47] Fierce predators that often again stalk
[33:51] their pray before attacking their
[33:53] attacks cause to the prey to panic and
[33:57] dispers
[33:58] allowing the Lions to
[34:00] isolate yeah yeah this guy he really
[34:04] wanted you to isolate for from everyone
[34:07] absolutely cuz when you are alone you
[34:10] are easy target
[34:12] yeah and attack a weaker or slower
[34:15] individual by hunting together lions are
[34:18] able to exhaust and kill the
[34:22] prey we have seen it yeah some people
[34:26] there are not fellows in the mark much
[34:28] Tred to stay
[34:30] alone what would happen
[34:32] next
[34:35] amen I put this picture here because I'm
[34:39] not too sure if it's for brother Brandon
[34:41] but I hear from a wonderful message that
[34:43] the devil is also like a
[34:45] boxer and if he he hits you hard and you
[34:49] start bleeding in one spot guess where
[34:52] is going to be the next hit in the same
[34:54] spot cuz he want to to bring you down
[34:58] and those um soft spots in your life are
[35:02] the ones that you really have to watch
[35:05] cuz that's the gate that you open and
[35:08] once it's open he's always going to try
[35:12] to come in the same way oh my it can be
[35:16] we not many of you guys have done drugs
[35:18] but for me that I did drugs the devil
[35:21] try to try to came on the same way but I
[35:25] received Jesus in my life so I remember
[35:28] cuz um I was working at the farm and
[35:30] what farmers do they just drink a little
[35:32] of alcohol when the day is done and they
[35:35] always used to offer me free free drinks
[35:40] free beers and I was like no sorry I
[35:43] don't drink and they were like really I
[35:46] yep that gate is shut now
[35:49] yeah where all the gates
[35:54] shut I hope that all those gates are
[35:57] shut
[35:58] cu the devil is going to try to
[36:04] get so because of the kids they have
[36:07] been asking me about
[36:10] this I have a question for you today and
[36:14] how many sheep were in Noah's
[36:18] Ark a two b 14 C 8 and D 20 and the end
[36:27] going to be
[36:28] soon so when you are destructed is when
[36:32] the devil can get you but it's so easy
[36:34] to get destructed in this
[36:36] world if you're at school you're trying
[36:39] to fit in one group if you're working
[36:43] you are thinking work because otherwise
[36:45] you can cut your
[36:48] fingers it's so easy just to get
[36:50] distracted amen and that's what the
[36:53] devil wants you that's why this world is
[36:56] just so
[36:58] to get
[36:59] distracted I was reading something it
[37:01] said
[37:02] like there's always something happening
[37:05] in 5 seconds that's how much you can
[37:08] kind of concentrate because there's
[37:10] something that's going to happen in the
[37:12] next 5 Seconds that's going to throw
[37:14] your attention and you're not going to
[37:16] be able to be just focused on
[37:19] something but if you are distracted
[37:21] doing
[37:23] something beware because there is a lion
[37:26] that is hunting you can you see that guy
[37:28] how was trying to hide but that guy is
[37:31] too big to hide you can know if you pay
[37:35] attention how the Bible says
[37:38] like sorry say be sober and be vigilant
[37:43] if you are
[37:44] Vigilant you're going to know when that
[37:46] guy is chasing you because you
[37:50] have soft spot and you know that that
[37:52] guy is trying to get you in some ways
[37:56] amen here I have one uh quote of brother
[37:59] BR
[38:00] says this is my favorite quote is on my
[38:03] fridge say remember we are not on a
[38:06] picnic but we are in a battlefield many
[38:10] people just think that when they become
[38:13] a Christian that's that's all they need
[38:16] to do that sett forever as they are
[38:19] Christian and everything goes going to
[38:21] come easy don't never get that in your
[38:25] head yeah don't never get that in your
[38:28] head for I become a Christian to fight
[38:30] fight the good fight of faith I become a
[38:33] Christian to get in the battle lines
[38:36] yeah it's not going to be easy but it's
[38:38] going to be wonderful hallelujah amen
[38:42] you know every single day that I have to
[38:44] leave my
[38:45] house I'm so grateful for the Lord amen
[38:49] that I have a family I have a roof over
[38:50] my head I have firewood if you have been
[38:53] doing firewood
[38:55] lately I have everything
[38:58] amen
[39:00] amen
[39:01] but when some people they are being pre
[39:05] of the
[39:06] devil they don't want to know anything
[39:09] yeah about um Christian people they are
[39:13] being Hur they have
[39:15] been isolated for the devil for way too
[39:19] long and that's how they said we have
[39:22] seen
[39:23] it but us as a church and I'm going to
[39:28] to the the thought of this we should be
[39:32] praying for this people amen hallelujah
[39:35] amen amen Matthew 26 chap uh verse 41
[39:39] said watch and pray that ye enter not
[39:43] into temptation the spirit indeed is
[39:46] willing but the flesh is weak the spirit
[39:50] is always willing to pray always willing
[39:54] to listen a tape always willing to
[39:57] testify but our
[40:00] flesh just wants something different
[40:03] amen I'm I'm being at work and sometimes
[40:05] I like I should be listening at a
[40:09] tape but I prefer to listen some songs I
[40:13] should be leing a
[40:14] tape our flesh is just weak but our
[40:18] spirit is always pushing always pushing
[40:21] and that small voice is just men oh my
[40:24] Lord and that's why I really like when
[40:26] being ask me to if I can speak on
[40:29] Wednesdays cuz that Stephanie knows that
[40:33] pushed me to pray and to seek from the
[40:36] Lord
[40:37] amen I just thank you man here we have a
[40:43] her of buffalos
[40:45] yeah now there's two lions eating a
[40:49] buffalo right and all those all what
[40:52] those guys are doing they are just
[40:54] staring and watching yeah
[40:58] I hope that that's not us cuz those guys
[41:03] there's someone son someone's daughter
[41:07] that's being attacked by the devil and
[41:09] what those guys are doing they're just
[41:12] stearing but this's a saying Unity makes
[41:18] strength now this is when a head realize
[41:23] that they are stronger this is when a
[41:25] head realize that they can do something
[41:28] about it yeah right and that's not the
[41:30] only picture that I got I got that one
[41:33] too that's how they can chase down the
[41:36] devil
[41:37] away this is prayer and look what one
[41:42] Buffalo can do to a lion amen
[41:45] amen yes sir so why they only sometimes
[41:48] they just
[41:51] stare don't know I hope that's not us
[41:58] and the answer of this question who says
[42:01] two two
[42:04] Lambs 14
[42:08] Lambs
[42:10] eight 20
[42:13] Lambs well the answer is in Genesis 7
[42:16] says and the Lord said unto Noah Come
[42:19] Thou and out thy house into the ark for
[42:22] the have seen righteousness before me in
[42:25] this generation of every clean Beast
[42:28] Thou shalt take to thee by sevens the
[42:31] male and his feemale female and of
[42:34] beasts that are not clean by two the
[42:36] male and his female now sheeps are clean
[42:40] or unclean
[42:42] animals so they were 14 in the
[42:46] a now all this deal with the devil being
[42:51] a
[42:52] lion he's not a real lion amen he's just
[42:56] a fake
[42:58] the Bible says like a lion the same way
[43:00] that he wants to be worshiped as God
[43:03] yeah he is just an i WN to be yeah he
[43:07] doesn't have any power amen
[43:10] amen uh Colossians 2 says bloting out
[43:14] the H
[43:15] reading and I went to Google too because
[43:18] I didn't know the meaning of this and
[43:20] bloting Out means to cause something to
[43:23] disappear or to remove something
[43:25] unpleasant from your your thoughts yeah
[43:28] have you ever had those kind of thoughts
[43:30] that you have to close your eyes very
[43:32] hard cuz you want them just to go
[43:34] away plotting out the handwriting of
[43:37] ordinance that was against us which was
[43:40] contrary to us and took it out of the
[43:42] way nailing it to his cross and having
[43:45] spoiled principalities and Powers he
[43:48] made a show of them openly triumphing
[43:51] over them in it in that
[43:54] moment the Lord was just triumphing
[43:57] when he was at the
[43:59] cross that was settles everything down
[44:02] the devil didn't have any power over
[44:05] us we have a real lion amen yes
[44:08] Revelations 5 says and one of the elders
[44:11] said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of
[44:13] the tribe of Judah the root of David ha
[44:17] prevailed to open the book and to lose
[44:19] the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and
[44:22] L in the midst of the throne and of the
[44:25] four beast in the mid of the elders it
[44:28] stood a
[44:30] lamb and as it had been slain he is our
[44:35] lion yeah he doesn't want you he doesn't
[44:37] want to destroy you amen he wants to
[44:40] protect you yeah Hallelujah he's a real
[44:42] lion
