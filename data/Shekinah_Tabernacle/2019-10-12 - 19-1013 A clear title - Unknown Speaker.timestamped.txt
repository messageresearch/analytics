[43:41] and ye that dwell on them woe to the
[43:43] inhabitants of the earth and the sea for
[43:45] the devil has come down unto you having
[43:47] great wrath because he knoweth he hath
[43:49] but a short time I'm glad he's got a
[43:52] short time has expired date is here Amen
[43:56] god bless your friends you may have your
[43:57] seats this morning like to speak about
[44:02] having a and and this will become more
[44:05] clear as we come as we journey along
[44:07] this morning but I want to speak about
[44:09] having a clear title now we know the
[44:14] devil as as we read he's the accuser of
[44:16] our brethren he he had a right through
[44:19] thee through the ages to to stand before
[44:21] God and and
[44:23] excuse the saints before God saying you
[44:25] know they did this and she did this and
[44:27] they did that and they were born wrong
[44:28] and you know they were born with a full
[44:30] of nature and look what they did and the
[44:32] and and and he has a right you know to
[44:35] to stand there and and tell God
[44:37] everything that you have done accuse you
[44:40] of it now but there comes and into that
[44:42] so I don't just wanna you know so
[44:44] because well we'll get there I just
[44:47] don't want to fire it all out in one go
[44:49] so you know but but the word accuser
[44:52] means to be one that is a plaintiff that
[44:54] is to charge with some offense to accuse
[44:57] or to object so to be the accuser of
[45:00] your of the Brethren he's the one that
[45:02] charges with summer feet so he charges
[45:05] you saying look hey God they did this
[45:07] and they did this and they thought this
[45:08] and this is how they are and this is
[45:09] their natural lineage and you know and
[45:12] and and this is how they think and this
[45:13] is how they act and you know cuz the
[45:15] devils are he's a person of detail too
[45:18] you know so he wants to hold those
[45:21] things because he knows God is holy and
[45:23] he knows that if he can if yes you're
[45:25] the devil can make basically God agree
[45:27] with him that you deserve to be
[45:29] destroyed then then then the whole plan
[45:32] of God's and jeopardy because God can't
[45:33] lose one son or one daughter he says all
[45:36] that the father has given me Jesus had
[45:38] already given me will come to me
[45:40] and all that comes me I'll no wise cast
[45:41] out so you know so the devil knows if he
[45:44] can just get one attribute of God I mean
[45:47] to be destroyed then he's won the whole
[45:49] day doesn't matter if he goes down with
[45:52] the ship hey he's gonna go down he's
[45:53] trying to drag everything every everyone
[45:55] he can down with him amen but so so he
[45:58] knows if he can get one then he's won
[46:01] amen right so am i doing something okay
[46:07] so he has a so so becomes but there
[46:12] comes a time it comes a time where where
[46:15] the devil cannot go no more and accuse
[46:17] now we read yo oh yeah we weren't read
[46:20] it well you don't need to turn to it but
[46:22] enjoy one and six think you know there
[46:24] was a day when the sons of God came to
[46:25] present themselves before the Lord and
[46:27] Satan came also among them so Satan had
[46:30] a right to go up into heaven go before
[46:32] the throne of God actually have a
[46:34] conversation with God and God
[46:37] gentleman he allows his enemy to come
[46:38] and talk to him right but but when we
[46:42] come to revelations four and five and
[46:44] this is where I've got my my thoughts
[46:46] form of having a clear title where John
[46:49] John we know as a symbolic of the Bride
[46:53] of Christ one man in a vision represents
[46:55] the whole body of people you come down
[46:57] to the seventh church age after the
[46:59] seventh Church agencies their voices
[47:00] speak with me was now up in heaven a
[47:03] door was open and their voice said come
[47:05] up hither and I'll show you things and
[47:07] so John was transported from the earth
[47:09] taken up into heaven speaking of the
[47:11] translation of the bride at the end of
[47:13] the seventh age right so so one man in a
[47:16] vision represents a whole body of people
[47:18] so John is a representation of you in
[47:20] the scripture I mean that's why the book
[47:22] of Revelation is the bride's book it's
[47:24] not everyone's book its veiled amen for
[47:27] a reason right but it's revealed to
[47:29] those that God wants to reveal it to so
[47:31] we represent John represents us
[47:36] hallelujah I trust if you could just you
[47:39] know if the Lord would just reveal that
[47:40] to you the book of Revelation would be
[47:42] very precious to you I mean because you
[47:45] know where you've been where you're
[47:46] going and where you are hallelujah so
[47:49] now so John has lifted up now but in
[47:51] this scene in in Revelations four and
[47:54] five we have the Lord sitting on the
[47:56] throne he sees him right he sees the
[47:58] four cherubims around the throne he sees
[48:00] them he sees the four and twenty elders
[48:02] representing all the redeemed through
[48:04] the ages hallelujah he sees him he sees
[48:08] the angels all around but when the lamb
[48:10] comes to step forth and take the book
[48:12] there's one person that is not there and
[48:14] Satan is not there right Satan is not in
[48:18] that scene he's not present why because
[48:20] he's been cast down he can no longer
[48:23] stand and accuse I mean because the lamb
[48:26] steps forth hallelujah and now he comes
[48:28] to claim what belongs to him and if he
[48:31] claims what belongs to him therefore
[48:33] every accusation that the devil could
[48:35] hold against his property has been
[48:37] struck off I mean there's nothing that
[48:39] the devil say oh no that one's mine or
[48:41] she's my no he's mine because of their
[48:43] sin because of their fall I mean no all
[48:45] of those things have been struck off
[48:47] Holly the devil has no
[48:49] no more to stand as the accuser he is
[48:52] cast down hallelujah there has to come a
[48:56] time you gotta read revelations four and
[48:58] five you weren't fine the devil there
[49:00] why cuz he is cast down I mean that's
[49:04] why we ever we have a reason to rejoice
[49:07] I mean where the devil's voice must be
[49:09] silenced hallelujah
[49:11] and it's the blood of Jesus Christ our
[49:13] lamb stepping forth silences he accuses
[49:15] voice amen hallelujah amen if you
[49:20] recognize the devil has no hold or no
[49:22] claim at all on you hallelujah that
[49:26] should make you happy and free and glad
[49:27] the devil's got no claim on me even with
[49:30] what we remember we did God says I don't
[49:33] I don't attribute that to them
[49:35] hallelujah death they're born of me
[49:38] hallelujah and what I am I cannot send
[49:40] my attributes sure and then they're part
[49:42] of me hallelujah so what they did in
[49:44] their flesh is not attributed to them he
[49:47] following me holy even though we may
[49:50] have the memory of it that's why we've
[49:52] got to recognize God took our shame he
[49:55] took our guilt I mean he took our he
[49:58] took all the bad parts of us washed it
[50:01] clean stuff hallelujah then he doesn't
[50:04] attribute it to you blessed is the man
[50:06] that God does not impute sin to amen in
[50:09] the only way he can not impute sin to us
[50:11] by perfect blood that He shed for you
[50:15] yeah so the devil's not there when the
[50:18] lamb takes the book now we know that
[50:20] their book as a as as the ABS is the
[50:24] title deed to the earth so so it's
[50:27] everything that Adam fell forfeited in
[50:29] order to fall with Eva's wife to try and
[50:32] redeem her but you're off also a
[50:36] represented in their book let's say it's
[50:39] a symbol of you as well when the lamb
[50:42] takes because member Jesus died see it's
[50:45] one thing to purchase something but then
[50:47] it's got to be claimed right it's got to
[50:50] be actually what you buy that's like you
[50:52] buy something in the store you don't
[50:53] just go buy it then don't take it away
[50:55] with you right you go you go buy it you
[50:58] say this is mine you you you pay the pay
[51:00] the money you pick it up you walk away
[51:03] and it's like on the internet you may
[51:04] buy something on the internet if it
[51:05] doesn't come to you then you begin to
[51:07] complain where's the thing I have bought
[51:10] where's the thing I have purchased
[51:11] haluya and it's the same thing with our
[51:14] Lord he purchased our salvation on
[51:16] Calvary struck off all of the sins that
[51:18] were held against the Old Testament
[51:20] Saints because the blood had blood of
[51:21] bulls and ghosts just covered their sin
[51:23] but when Jesus died he he he he washed
[51:26] all their sins way that they could have
[51:28] seen hallelujah up and to you know you
[51:30] know hide them where they were in the
[51:31] waiting place rights and so so he struck
[51:33] off all their sins but he didn't just
[51:35] strike off their sins he struck off all
[51:37] the bride down through seven Church ages
[51:40] I mean so so what he did that day didn't
[51:42] just deal with what had been past but
[51:44] what would be future hallelujah because
[51:46] garden is mind when he thought of you he
[51:48] says I I see them redeemed I see them in
[51:50] my image I see them like me I see them
[51:53] around the throne I see me seen them at
[51:54] the wedding supper I see them in the New
[51:56] Jerusalem I see them rejoicing hallelu
[51:59] that's how he saw you right I mean he
[52:01] didn't see us this is Syria he didn't
[52:03] see us in our struggles he didn't see us
[52:05] in our hardship hallelujah he didn't see
[52:09] how we are right now our bodies our
[52:13] spirits our souls are redeemed right but
[52:15] he didn't see us in this fallen
[52:17] condition and eternity holy he knew you
[52:20] had to go through it to develop
[52:22] character holy he knew you had to go
[52:24] through this because you want to say
[52:25] Satan I'm going to show you something
[52:27] I'm going to show you the power of my
[52:29] blood as more than enough I mean to keep
[52:32] her people to cause them to be
[52:34] overcomers and then to cause him wholly
[52:37] to walk in victory no matter what age
[52:38] they're in holy no matter what condition
[52:41] no matter what circumstances are against
[52:43] them I'm going to show you the power of
[52:45] my sacrifice I'm going to show you the
[52:47] power of my atonement hallelujah so you
[52:51] know God knew we would be here he's not
[52:54] worried we shouldn't be worried I mean
[52:57] remember the scripture says we were all
[52:59] means that where my heart is overwhelmed
[53:00] lead me to the rock so there come a
[53:02] times when we feel overwhelmed we can't
[53:05] handle what even just life can get just
[53:06] too much and we feel overwhelmed but
[53:09] there's a we can say Lord lead me to the
[53:10] rock lead me to you which is higher than
[53:12] I holy well I don't know the answer you
[53:15] know we can get so
[53:16] frustrated why do we get frustrated
[53:18] because we can't see a way out
[53:20] hallelujah that's why we get so or
[53:22] because we can't see an answer they say
[53:24] Lord lead me to the rock lead me to the
[53:26] rock which is higher than I hallelujah
[53:29] and then you get led to him holler you
[53:30] just have you can just let off the
[53:32] pressure
[53:33] Amen every everything that builds up
[53:36] pressure has to have a release valve
[53:38] otherwise it goes kaboom right that goes
[53:42] kaboom hallelujah
[53:44] we need to let off the pressure and the
[53:46] best the only way to truly lead off the
[53:48] pressures get into the prints of God
[53:50] just relax amen I know even coming to
[53:54] church can build up some tension right
[53:56] because you like Lord speak to me deal
[53:59] with me
[53:59] Here I am meet my needs it can actually
[54:02] build a tension but just relax you want
[54:06] to see the supernatural relax I'm
[54:09] sitting at his banqueting table
[54:11] hallelujah just enjoy it you know a
[54:14] thing I've seen before yo you take your
[54:16] spouse order you know you're out on a
[54:17] date

[54:20] a certain place and you know and you get
[54:21] so tense I've got to get a park right by
[54:24] the door the tables going to be at the
[54:25] right place you know y'all hope there's
[54:28] not too many people there want the right
[54:29] kind of atmosphere yeah it's so kind of
[54:31] tense as the food hot and offers a call
[54:33] ever I should ordered that you know I
[54:34] need to drink yeah and you get so caught
[54:36] up and those things the you you forget
[54:41] who you're sitting with having and
[54:43] having a meal with you know you get so
[54:46] tensed you actually missed the blessing
[54:47] that you're actually in that's the same
[54:50] thing with you know here where he he put
[54:54] me at his banqueting table and his
[54:56] banner of me as love her lujah so I
[54:59] think we should just be happy Lord you
[55:01] found me you found me lord I was lost
[55:05] and undone I thought I had life all
[55:07] mapped out but you know I had my plans
[55:09] but you came and interjected my plans

[55:14] way go this way
[55:15] hallelujah he took me by the heart
[55:18] hallelujah let me up into glorious
[55:20] places and it's been worth it all amen
[55:24] so you know we should just be happy
[55:27] hallelujah
[55:30] now what's wonderful about the Old
[55:33] Testament as Redemption has woven
[55:36] through the law and a and an Israelite
[55:39] had a right to be redeemed or to go free
[55:41] like the year of Jubilee they had a
[55:43] right of faith if they chose to because
[55:46] the law is full of cycles and not every
[55:49] cycle is a bad cycle right because cycle
[55:52] you can say well I'm in a bit of a hard
[55:54] period of life it'll come to an end I'm
[55:58] going through a struggle it'll come to
[56:00] an end right I'm going through you know
[56:02] maybe the children are being children
[56:03] you know they'll grow out of it
[56:05] hallelujah I'm going through a time of
[56:08] my life it'll go I'll grow out of it
[56:10] these cycles in life hallelujah but and
[56:15] it's the same thing with the law there's
[56:16] cycles of yo 50 years and Jubilee and
[56:19] different things like that
[56:20] but that shows that now those things
[56:23] that can be redeemed must be redeemed
[56:27] they must be restored like those who you
[56:30] know if someone you know had to forfeit
[56:32] property sell themselves into slavery if
[56:34] they wanted to go free the law said they
[56:38] had to they had to go free by the word
[56:41] said they must go through to a certain
[56:43] time and so now everything that is
[56:45] redeemable must be redeemed okay so now
[56:51] brother baron when he's when he's
[56:53] preaching the breech and I'm gonna I'm
[56:55] gonna go through it a bit but you know
[56:59] he comes into the story of Ruth and he
[57:03] sees about the lamb taking the book he
[57:05] says he says Boaz marrying Ruth as a
[57:07] beautiful picture of this this is where
[57:10] I wanna kind of dwell for a while to
[57:11] hear us so here's Nate so here is Naomi
[57:15] she goes with her family into Moab she
[57:18] loses her father and and her two sons
[57:20] and laws and now she hears this grain
[57:23] back in Israel and so she decides I'm
[57:25] going back home I'm going back to what I
[57:27] forfeited when I left I'm going back to
[57:30] it and then so Ruth decides she's going
[57:32] to go with she says you're gonna be my
[57:35] god your people my people will you die
[57:37] all die she just made a clear-cut
[57:39] decision I don't know where we're going
[57:41] but I'm going I'm following you so now
[57:43] here
[57:44] a woman that because because Noemi had
[57:48] lost some ground and because Ruth as her
[57:52] daughter-in-law she's actually standing
[57:54] in a place where there's a dispute over
[57:57] her because she has to be redeemed so
[58:01] here she is she's carrying this now I I
[58:03] trust this comes out because I'm gonna
[58:06] say God God is so intent on redeeming
[58:10] his people he can't God doesn't like God
[58:14] loves to settle disputes right the devil
[58:17] loves to continue disputes on he loves
[58:19] her he just if he could he was and he's
[58:22] tried to stop the plan of redemption
[58:23] coming to its climax right so he loves
[58:26] disputes he wanted to continue on but
[58:29] God says no there comes a time where
[58:31] this is done there comes a time when
[58:34] there's no more dispute I'm gonna wind
[58:36] it up you're going to shut up devil
[58:38] you're going to burn and we're gonna
[58:40] roll into eternity that's what God God
[58:42] always brings things to an end so there
[58:44] here comes here comes Ruth with her with
[58:48] her pain with her you know her husband
[58:52] dying her brother-in-law dying you know
[58:55] coming from a place you know she's got
[58:57] all this yo she's carrying all this but
[59:00] yet she's carrying something else she's
[59:03] carrying the ability to be redeemed
[59:05] because of who she is
[59:08] hallelujah so here she's she's got to
[59:10] find someone which will actually settle
[59:12] that dispute in her life hallelujah so
[59:17] here she is carrying this she wasn't
[59:18] skipping happy from from Moab unto
[59:21] Israel she wasn't rejoicing
[59:24] she lost her she lost her husband lost
[59:27] her brother-in-law lost her
[59:28] father-in-law and she's gonna go into a
[59:30] foreign land where she doesn't you know
[59:33] she's not even by the law not even
[59:35] allowed to come into the congregation of
[59:37] Israel but yet there's something in her
[59:40] that there's a dispute and it has to
[59:42] come to an end because Noemi says I'm
[59:44] gonna go back and and she has a parcel
[59:47] of ground that has to be restored to her
[59:49] and the only way cuz she can't do it are
[59:51] you glad you can't do it
[59:53] are you glad you can't do it and then so
[59:57] and then so Nomi comes back she's got a
[59:59] piece of ground that her husband had but
[1:00:01] of course that was four footed because
[1:00:03] they left the land and so now that has
[1:00:04] to be restored to her and the only way
[1:00:07] that can be restored to her is that if
[1:00:09] someone over near kinsman someone who's
[1:00:11] family will come by the law and and and
[1:00:14] purchase it back for her hallelujah but
[1:00:16] then there's not only that there's also
[1:00:18] now and their cousin must must marry
[1:00:20] know me to raise up as the Bible says
[1:00:22] seed for the dead par lujah so now it's
[1:00:26] not only the land that has to be
[1:00:27] restored but it's also Nomi has to be
[1:00:29] married and that's the only way that the
[1:00:32] sorry Ruth has to be married hallelujah
[1:00:35] I got some prompts appreciate that uh
[1:00:38] you know yeah anyway so so someone has
[1:00:42] to marry roof and this is you now here
[1:00:45] you are you're carrying this who's going
[1:00:47] to settle my dispute who's gonna who's
[1:00:50] going to clear this all up
[1:00:51] you're not going to clear it up you
[1:00:53] can't clear it up amen you can't you
[1:00:57] can't be redeemed by your own ability so
[1:01:00] now here she comes
[1:01:02] she's carrying this with her pain with
[1:01:04] her bad memories of you know with her
[1:01:06] hurt but here she is and she comes into
[1:01:09] Boaz is filled and then now there comes
[1:01:12] a time so so so the head Reaper points
[1:01:14] out you know Boaz comes to the field the
[1:01:17] chief Reaper is there organizing the
[1:01:19] laborers and then so your bow is awesome
[1:01:22] who's this damsel and the chief rumor
[1:01:24] says this is this is this is Ruth
[1:01:27] hallelujah means for the chief Reaper
[1:01:29] introduces Boaz to Ruth and he goes off
[1:01:31] the scene brother bran was the chief
[1:01:33] Reaper we're living in a harvest day
[1:01:35] amen he pointed out what he point out
[1:01:37] Boaz the mighty man of wealth our Lord
[1:01:39] Jesus Christ he pointed you out to him
[1:01:42] hallelujah the message pointed you out
[1:01:44] to him and then now the Lord looks at
[1:01:46] you and says I've gotta settle this
[1:01:49] because there's a dispute who does the
[1:01:52] bride belong to because the devil says
[1:01:55] no by their first birthday - I have
[1:01:58] claims on them because of their first
[1:01:59] birth I made their forebears fall and
[1:02:02] every generation has been born wrong -
[1:02:04] therefore I have claims on them within
[1:02:07] God's
[1:02:07] no no they're mine but he's got to do
[1:02:10] something
[1:02:11] see God doesn't just talk about it he
[1:02:13] does it right he doesn't just say yes
[1:02:15] this and this and this and promise the
[1:02:17] world no he actually delivers so what he
[1:02:20] says he'll do he will do I mean so now
[1:02:23] his boys he's got to settle this dispute
[1:02:25] because he's a question over Ruth's life
[1:02:27] and then he goes to a near kinsman and
[1:02:30] then he says you know are you willing to
[1:02:33] redeem Naomi's field her position yes
[1:02:36] but then he also says well if you're you
[1:02:40] know but then you also have to marry
[1:02:42] roof he says I can't do it
[1:02:45] so forfeited it so then Ruth got married
[1:02:50] to Boaz and then now so so what did Ruth
[1:02:53] do I mean what do Boaz do all of that
[1:02:55] all that Ruth was he took care of it
[1:02:59] he's a mob itis he was a widow you know
[1:03:03] she wasn't even meant to be in the
[1:03:04] congregation of Israel but then by him
[1:03:07] marrying her he took away her past and
[1:03:10] gave her a new identity hallelujah so
[1:03:14] now so now every dispute oh she has no
[1:03:18] right to be here what's she doing in the
[1:03:19] land she wasn't even born here she
[1:03:21] doesn't belong here he can say no no she
[1:03:23] is she is my wife
[1:03:25] holy abayas you saying that a ruse is my
[1:03:28] wife she has every right to live in
[1:03:30] Bethlehem because she is married to me
[1:03:33] Holly so what they do clear every
[1:03:35] dispute that can be held against her
[1:03:37] Amen it's just like just like um you're
[1:03:40] Rahab married Salman from from Judah
[1:03:43] here she was she as a harlot she as a
[1:03:45] Gentile but by being United with salmone
[1:03:48] hallelujah
[1:03:49] she had a right to be in the promised
[1:03:50] land every dispute I mean and when
[1:03:53] Jericho was destroyed her past was
[1:03:55] destroyed holiest so none of her
[1:03:58] accusers could stand all the evidence of
[1:04:00] her old life was eradicated Pollan so
[1:04:04] she had a right Amen to dwell in the
[1:04:06] promised land by being United with
[1:04:08] salmone lujah why God showing I take
[1:04:12] care of it that all disputes are struck
[1:04:15] off hallelujah Amen why do we
[1:04:21] the devil wrestles he yo he fights with
[1:04:23] us doesn't he he fight here he brings
[1:04:25] our past that brings our humanity how we
[1:04:28] think those things and he tries to pin
[1:04:30] us down by who we are doesn't he yeah
[1:04:35] and sure because of this you know
[1:04:37] because of our first birth you know we
[1:04:41] are still a flesh body but we are not
[1:04:44] only that but we redeemed hallelujah so
[1:04:49] now because of that our souls are
[1:04:51] redeemed but our bodies are not redeemed
[1:04:53] we need a body change I mean but that
[1:04:56] doesn't remember but that doesn't change
[1:04:58] the fact we redeemed just because we're
[1:05:01] living in these fallen bodies it doesn't
[1:05:03] mean our souls aren't redeemed remember
[1:05:04] the devil has the right to make you sick
[1:05:06] because of this the devil has the right
[1:05:08] to fight you in here but depends what
[1:05:10] you do at the thoughts I mean but he
[1:05:12] can't get your soul I mean your soul was
[1:05:15] never has and never will be has it's
[1:05:17] God's and that's why she does blood on
[1:05:19] coverings is their souls belong to me
[1:05:21] hallelujah amen so so sure he can say
[1:05:28] you know he can fight you in here that
[1:05:31] doesn't make you an unbeliever he can
[1:05:33] fight you in here but that doesn't make
[1:05:35] you an unbeliever right he can't get
[1:05:37] your soul though well yo my battles come
[1:05:40] in trouble comes and what's the first
[1:05:42] thing we begin what yo what's the first
[1:05:44] thing the devil tries to a road when
[1:05:46] those things happen I do you really have
[1:05:48] it
[1:05:49] arolea believer he really sincere is it
[1:05:54] just me he does that do see that's what
[1:05:57] he so he's trying to break your
[1:05:59] foundation of who you are but when God
[1:06:02] looks at you he doesn't hold those
[1:06:04] things against you Pete he became flesh
[1:06:06] because he wanted to take on human
[1:06:08] battles he wanted to know what it was
[1:06:10] like to be a man in order to understand
[1:06:13] your daily life to understand your
[1:06:16] thought processes understand what it's
[1:06:18] like to have struggles I understand what
[1:06:20] it's like to be tempted hallelujah
[1:06:22] undeclared how God understands us I mean
[1:06:25] he understands what it's like to be a
[1:06:26] teenager he understands what it's like
[1:06:27] to be an adult he knows what it's like
[1:06:29] to be a child he knows what it's like to
[1:06:31] be rejected to be misunderstood to be
[1:06:33] retiro to be made fun of
[1:06:35] he understands hallelujah so when you
[1:06:39] when you go through the same things
[1:06:41] he's his child I know what you've gone
[1:06:43] through cuz I walked those same places
[1:06:46] he was tempted on all points yet without
[1:06:49] sin
[1:06:50] huh all points so whatever point you
[1:06:53] name he was tempted so he knows what
[1:06:56] it's like for it to be put in front of
[1:06:58] him but he knows what it's like to
[1:06:59] overcome that thing who you now
[1:07:06] well the brem sees in the breach because
[1:07:11] if we read in Revelations 5 it comes a
[1:07:14] time when John doesn't weep no more the
[1:07:18] devil's not there and he's weeping he
[1:07:21] says I wept much it's got 2 revelations
[1:07:24] 5 and 5 because it's John here's the 1
[1:07:36] he walked with Jesus he saw Jesus
[1:07:38] resurrect you know he saw incredible
[1:07:41] things but now he's looking he said
[1:07:43] who's worthy to take the book who's
[1:07:45] worthy not just do you know to actually
[1:07:48] claim all of creation back he says and
[1:07:52] one of the elders saith unto me weep not
[1:07:53] behold the lamb I'm inside the Lion of
[1:07:55] the tribe of Judah the root of David
[1:07:57] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[1:07:59] loose the seven seals off and I beheld
[1:08:01] and lo in the midst of the throne and
[1:08:03] the four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:08:05] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:08:07] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:08:09] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:08:11] into all the earth and he came and he
[1:08:13] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:08:14] him that sat upon the throne and when he
[1:08:16] had taken the book the four beasts and
[1:08:18] four and twenty elders fell down before
[1:08:19] the lamb having every one of them harps
[1:08:22] and golden vials full of odours which
[1:08:24] are the prayers of the saints there
[1:08:26] comes a time when these prayers are
[1:08:27] actually released and they're answered
[1:08:29] and they sang a new song saying now i
[1:08:32] worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:08:33] seals role for thou was slain and has
[1:08:36] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:08:37] every kindred and tongue and people and
[1:08:39] nation and has made unto us kings and
[1:08:42] priests and we shall reign on the earth
[1:08:44] so they came a time with this where they
[1:08:47] were now going to sing a new song
[1:08:49] because God had opened himself to them
[1:08:51] he had done something that he had not
[1:08:53] done in the past right they knew him as
[1:08:55] their sacrificed their high priest I
[1:08:57] mean but they'd never known him as
[1:08:58] stepping forth and taking the book and
[1:09:00] opening the seals they never knew him in
[1:09:02] this way so they sang a new song holy
[1:09:05] earth they hadn't you worship hallelujah
[1:09:07] they weren't just singing the old songs
[1:09:09] are singing new ones after which tied
[1:09:12] him with what God was doing in their day
[1:09:14] hallelujah so now they begin to end in
[1:09:16] now John he begins to rejoice because he
[1:09:20] knows that because he was because
[1:09:22] without a man stepping forced to take
[1:09:24] that book the devil can still lay claims
[1:09:26] and say they did this and they do this
[1:09:28] and they said this there's still
[1:09:29] disputes but now when someone steps
[1:09:32] forth a man hallelujah sets forth and
[1:09:34] takes back everything that Adam lost
[1:09:36] he's actually declaring to the devil now
[1:09:38] I have purchased it now I've claimed it
[1:09:41] you have no part in them you have no
[1:09:43] part in this world and then you have
[1:09:45] come to your end hallelujah now it's
[1:09:48] settled wholly there's no more dispute
[1:09:50] devil you can't accuse you can't say
[1:09:52] but-but-but because now your buts have
[1:09:53] come to an end
[1:09:54] hallelujah all the disputes are gone
[1:09:57] hallelujah I mean that's why they sung a
[1:10:00] new song that's why we can truly now
[1:10:02] sing I am free free free from this world
[1:10:04] of sin Holly I never I no longer do the
[1:10:07] works of the flesh hallelujah I don't
[1:10:10] I'm not it's just a religious person no
[1:10:11] more I'm free hallelujah we got to come
[1:10:15] to a place with a bride recognized as
[1:10:16] I'm free I'm free from whatever my
[1:10:19] parents did in the end and we're given
[1:10:20] to me I'm free from the culture of this
[1:10:22] world I'm free from the influences of
[1:10:24] this world I'm free from sin there's no
[1:10:26] more sin working in my and my body no
[1:10:28] more hallelujah I'm a free person
[1:10:31] hallelujah well how do you overcome you
[1:10:35] got to recognize what God has done for
[1:10:36] you
[1:10:37] amen that's how you overcome it's not
[1:10:40] you overcoming it's him overcoming in
[1:10:42] you hallelujah amen let him just anoint
[1:10:46] your faith hallelujah and spy your faith
[1:10:49] now he sees in God hiding himself in
[1:10:54] simplicity he says then when a man
[1:10:56] before he send it he says he says when a
[1:10:59] man sinned he separated himself from God
[1:11:01] and closed and cross the
[1:11:03] great chasm and put himself in death on
[1:11:05] this side he left there's no way back
[1:11:07] exactly there was no way for him to get
[1:11:09] back but when he did he accepted a
[1:11:11] substitute which was a lamb or a goat or
[1:11:14] a sheep or something for blood which
[1:11:16] Adam spoke Abel spoke of on the other
[1:11:18] side of the chasm on that side he's the
[1:11:20] son of God he's an offspring from God he
[1:11:23] is an inheritance of of the earth he can
[1:11:26] control nature can speak into existence
[1:11:28] why he's a creator himself he's an
[1:11:30] offspring of God but when he crossed he
[1:11:32] separated his sonship he's a sinner by
[1:11:35] nature he's under the hands and Dominion
[1:11:37] of Satan right this is those who are on
[1:11:39] the wrong side of the chasm they still
[1:11:41] do the works of this world they're still
[1:11:43] under the influence those who overcome
[1:11:45] overcome right they don't just say I am
[1:11:48] saved by grace and still wallow on and
[1:11:50] sin that's not overcoming that's not
[1:11:52] having victory they're actually just
[1:11:53] confessing something they don't possess
[1:11:55] I mean but those who really have faith
[1:11:57] will possess it amen just like Caleb
[1:12:00] said that mountains mine I believe it he
[1:12:02] got it
[1:12:03] hallelujah he didn't just talk about it
[1:12:05] he really dwell on that mountain
[1:12:07] hallelujah I mean that's why she'd
[1:12:10] always have a positive confession my God
[1:12:12] is able
[1:12:13] I mean he's purchased a time in the
[1:12:14] blood is more than enough his Redemption
[1:12:16] is more than enough I meant more than
[1:12:18] enough to cleanse me to heal me to
[1:12:20] redeem me it's more than enough to keep
[1:12:21] me from furnace water well enough to
[1:12:23] make me an overcomer
[1:12:25] you've got to confess it hallelujah what
[1:12:28] did David do this Goliath bring me a man
[1:12:31] the great challenge what did David say
[1:12:32] what's this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:12:34] doing here why is he defying the armies
[1:12:37] of the Living God here he was he
[1:12:40] confessed it no I can kill this man
[1:12:42] hallelujah and he did it because it was
[1:12:45] revealed to him it can be done he didn't
[1:12:49] confess what the other people are saying
[1:12:50] around them you got to be careful what
[1:12:52] kind of atmosphere you built and your
[1:12:54] home in conversations if you're if you
[1:12:56] you know if you always talking negative
[1:12:58] and how can this and I don't know and
[1:12:59] your what kind of atmosphere that
[1:13:01] doesn't build faith it just builds doubt
[1:13:05] holier we shouldn't build down now homes
[1:13:07] you're building faith God's more than
[1:13:09] able how's this going to happen we need
[1:13:11] prayer first I don't know but he's able
[1:13:12] to do it I mean how's this going to work
[1:13:14] out I don't know I don't know the way
[1:13:16] but
[1:13:16] he knows the way amen hallelujah if we
[1:13:18] knew what would happen to us every day
[1:13:20] from now to the rapture we wouldn't need
[1:13:22] faith this is a walk of faith there's a
[1:13:25] walk we don't even where's this going
[1:13:27] Lord I'm walking according to your word
[1:13:28] but I don't know where this is going he
[1:13:30] says just just believe and walk
[1:13:32] hallelujah hey our faith is tested isn't
[1:13:35] it has to be tested
[1:13:36] what's the other thing as brother and
[1:13:37] Paul said what is good what what good is
[1:13:40] faith without it being tested only it's
[1:13:43] got to be put to the test so now and God
[1:13:49] took a sacrifice a chemical of the blood
[1:13:51] but the blood of bulls and goats did not
[1:13:53] divorce in it only covered sin if you've
[1:13:56] got a red spot on your hand and cover it
[1:13:58] with white the red spot still there see
[1:14:00] it's still there but God sent down from
[1:14:01] heaven a bleach person it was the blood
[1:14:04] of his own son that's it when our
[1:14:05] confess sin drops into blood God's
[1:14:08] bleach try to find it again the coloring
[1:14:10] of sin goes back through the mediators
[1:14:12] goes down through the time until it hits
[1:14:14] the accuser Satan and lays on him till
[1:14:17] the day of the judgment I mean because
[1:14:19] there's got to be it's just like in the
[1:14:21] garden God came down he says Adam where
[1:14:24] are you he knew where they were but he
[1:14:26] comes down to their level we're here and
[1:14:28] then Adam and Eve sinking was changed by
[1:14:31] the fall saying God's angry at us he's
[1:14:34] going to say we were scared
[1:14:35] what where did they get that thinking
[1:14:37] from wasn't from God amen that was from
[1:14:40] the devil right but now God comes down
[1:14:43] and now he's going to take care of this
[1:14:45] so so he asked Adam Adam what happened
[1:14:48] well the woman you gave me did this so
[1:14:51] he's blaming he's blaming God for his
[1:14:52] predicament but his own choice got him
[1:14:54] there that's human nature isn't it right
[1:14:57] and in and in and in and in so now it
[1:14:59] passes now Eve what happened the serpent
[1:15:01] and then now the serpent has no answer
[1:15:06] so now everything that happened has put
[1:15:09] on the serpent how lujah because God
[1:15:13] always gets down to the bottom of it you
[1:15:16] know it's like you you know you walk
[1:15:17] into the room and your children you know
[1:15:20] they're all this one's crying this one's
[1:15:21] angry this one's this you gotta go okay
[1:15:23] now what happened I got hold on what
[1:15:28] happened and then finally you boil it
[1:15:29] down boy
[1:15:30] this happened amen and so God does that
[1:15:34] because someone's gonna pay someone's
[1:15:38] gonna pay and it's not it's not it's not
[1:15:41] God's children's going to pay
[1:15:42] totally if someone's gonna pay for this
[1:15:45] and it's not us
[1:15:47] hallelujah it's not you and I that's
[1:15:50] gonna pay I mean but the devil's going
[1:15:52] to pay that's why when yours when your
[1:15:55] sinners confess into the blood of Jesus
[1:15:57] Christ how do you do that out of a
[1:15:58] sincere heart say sorry Lord come me and
[1:16:01] your blood forgive me I'm wrong
[1:16:03] hallelujah then what happens debts
[1:16:05] confess yet to the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:16:07] it's not covered it's taken from you but
[1:16:10] someone's gonna pay where does it say go
[1:16:13] goes I know who started this in the
[1:16:14] beginning and in the devil gets the mail
[1:16:18] he gets a package and he's got to carry
[1:16:22] that to the day of judgment hallelujah
[1:16:29] amen amen
[1:16:35] now he's free what happens what happens
[1:16:39] to the son he becomes in perfect
[1:16:40] fellowship with the father again see the
[1:16:42] blood is so perfect that puts us back in
[1:16:44] perfect fellowship hallelujah
[1:16:47] takes away the chasm brother Brahim says
[1:16:50] the blood puts us back on speaking terms
[1:16:51] with God
[1:16:52] isn't that wonderful so are you just
[1:16:54] talking into the air I mean you talk to
[1:16:56] him he talks back to you hallelujah
[1:16:59] I'm glad we can talk to him and you a
[1:17:00] man takes all our worries away
[1:17:03] hallelujah so he becomes in perfect
[1:17:09] fellowship with the father again
[1:17:10] standing on the other side of the chasm
[1:17:12] with no remembrance of sin against him
[1:17:13] no more there is no more stain of bleach
[1:17:16] can be seen anywhere he's free
[1:17:17] hallelujah this is that Clorox oh that
[1:17:20] ink can never be inked no more because
[1:17:21] it's broke up and sent back again and
[1:17:23] when confessed and has confessed and
[1:17:25] being dipped a man or a woman's been
[1:17:27] dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it
[1:17:29] kills all symptoms every molecule of sin
[1:17:31] goes back to the devil and laid on him
[1:17:34] to the day of judgment where his eternal
[1:17:36] destination will be thrown into a lake
[1:17:38] of fire hallelujah and the chasms
[1:17:40] bridged never to come and remembers no
[1:17:42] more immense
[1:17:43] it's justified as the Son of God
[1:17:45] hallelujah
[1:17:47] the devil's gonna burn because what he
[1:17:49] made you do everything you did is
[1:17:52] attributed to him hallelujah amen
[1:17:57] now it says speaking of Ruth he says the
[1:17:59] Book of Ruth gives her so there's about
[1:18:01] taking the book The Book of Ruth gives a
[1:18:04] beautiful picture of us how Boaz and no
[1:18:06] me had lost the estate you know he says
[1:18:09] so Boas had become a redeemer he's the
[1:18:14] only one that could he had to be a
[1:18:16] kinsman and their kinsman and in
[1:18:17] redeeming know me he got Ruth that was
[1:18:19] Jesus Boaz type in Christ and when he
[1:18:22] redeemed Israel he got the Gentile bride
[1:18:23] so then you see so every face is so very
[1:18:26] beautiful police is now notice he must
[1:18:29] be a kinsman see he couldn't do it as an
[1:18:32] angel cuz we're not we're not conferred
[1:18:34] to angel right he see a man can do it
[1:18:37] must be a man but it can't be born of a
[1:18:40] woman as a sex act so the virgin birth
[1:18:42] the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary
[1:18:44] therefore Jesus was not a Jew Jesus was
[1:18:47] not a Gentile Jesus was God I mean we
[1:18:50] don't worship you know yo hood I heard
[1:18:52] um brother man sat the other day I don't
[1:18:54] worship a Jew because he wasn't a Jew he
[1:18:56] was a Gentile he was God made Immanuel
[1:18:58] God with us God made flesh hallelujah he
[1:19:02] was the holy created blood of God we're
[1:19:04] not saved by Jewish blood neither saved
[1:19:06] by Gentile blood we're saved by the
[1:19:08] blood of God that's according to the
[1:19:10] Bible it says so - so you see Jesus was
[1:19:13] God he was not the third person not the
[1:19:15] fourth person not the second person he
[1:19:17] was the person he was God you see he was
[1:19:20] God Emmanuel God came down from his
[1:19:22] glory and revealed himself hallelujah
[1:19:26] now let's go to Isaiah 54 and 16 because
[1:19:30] I'm sure we can just get our rejoicing
[1:19:33] shoes on and we can recognize God's
[1:19:36] blood is more than enough so you see the
[1:19:38] battle always as the devil comes against
[1:19:40] you but you've got to point him to your
[1:19:42] sacrifice right because it's your
[1:19:44] sacrifice the word you have received
[1:19:46] makes the difference and I'll come into
[1:19:49] that soon right so it's what you have
[1:19:51] received makes the difference it's not
[1:19:53] you that makes a difference Amen so
[1:19:56] Isaiah 50
[1:19:57] for in 16 he says behold I have created
[1:20:01] the Smith to blot the coals in the fire
[1:20:03] and that bring us forth an instrument
[1:20:05] for his work I have created the waster
[1:20:07] to destroy that God just made him no
[1:20:11] weapon that's formed against thee shall
[1:20:13] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[1:20:16] against the in judgment thou shalt
[1:20:18] condemn so when the devil comes against
[1:20:20] you you've got to condemn that voice I
[1:20:22] meant when when the devil comes against
[1:20:25] you I'm just gonna repeat it when the
[1:20:26] devil comes against you you're going to
[1:20:28] condemn that voice
[1:20:29] I mean you shouldn't agree with them oh
[1:20:31] you fell don't say yes I did fell know
[1:20:34] once it's confessed just get back up God
[1:20:37] doesn't remember it hallelujah amen you
[1:20:40] know you can delete something off a hard
[1:20:42] drive but people get software and go
[1:20:44] find it again when God deletes your sin
[1:20:47] from your record you can't find it so
[1:20:51] every tongue that shall rise against
[1:20:53] thee in the judgment thou shalt candy I
[1:20:55] was talking about spurts coming against
[1:20:57] you well hallelujah
[1:20:59] you've got to condemn that you got to
[1:21:01] think where did this thought come from
[1:21:02] it wasn't God hallelujah you've got to
[1:21:05] condemn it why because you've got a
[1:21:07] perfect blood I meant this is the
[1:21:10] heritage of the servants of the Lord and
[1:21:12] their righteousness is of me saith the
[1:21:14] Lord so the reason that you can rise up
[1:21:17] and condemn every tongue that comes
[1:21:18] against you every spirit that comes
[1:21:20] against you is because your
[1:21:21] righteousness is of him hallelujah
[1:21:24] we have his righteousness glory to God
[1:21:27] I'm glad I'm his righteousness God is
[1:21:29] righteous by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:33] now as I said so but but what the devil
[1:21:37] has done as well is down through 7
[1:21:40] Church ages is that as that white horse
[1:21:42] began to ride and and put bringing the
[1:21:44] deeds of the Nicolaitans he was bringing
[1:21:46] false doctrine against the church
[1:21:48] because when the church was birthed it
[1:21:50] was free
[1:21:51] amen Pentecost gave a free born people
[1:21:54] hallelujah because what happened now was
[1:21:56] there they were in the upper room and
[1:21:58] they had claims to what God had done but
[1:22:02] now they are waiting for something to
[1:22:03] come and clear all claims against them
[1:22:06] hallelujah just like you go buy a piece
[1:22:08] of you know you know brother Brown calls
[1:22:10] about
[1:22:11] man abstract title deed so what that
[1:22:13] means is it's like you go buy a house if
[1:22:16] there's any anyone else that Scott
[1:22:18] claims against their property then you
[1:22:20] can't buy it
[1:22:20] cuz that dispute has to be settled I
[1:22:23] mean before you can actually take
[1:22:24] possession of what you've bought
[1:22:26] hallelujah so now here's God and the
[1:22:29] devil saying oh but yo you just think
[1:22:31] about those in the upper room Peter
[1:22:32] tried to kill a guy
[1:22:34] he wasn't just trying to wound him cut
[1:22:36] off his ear he was trying to take off
[1:22:37] his head but he wasn't a swordsman there
[1:22:39] was a woman at the well being married
[1:22:41] too many times right looking for love in
[1:22:43] all the wrong places
[1:22:44] there was Mary Magdalene that had Seven
[1:22:46] Devils cast out of her hallelujah you
[1:22:49] know Matthew worked for the IRD
[1:22:51] so you know you know here's the tax
[1:22:54] collector you know there was all
[1:22:56] everyone there was broken you know you
[1:22:59] could say lives were ruined
[1:23:00] you know outwash of the world they were
[1:23:03] up in the upper room hallelujah all
[1:23:05] those kind of people so the devil will
[1:23:07] say I have claims on those 120
[1:23:09] I've got claims god they're mine by
[1:23:12] their first birth to their first nature
[1:23:14] they received they are mine so now
[1:23:16] there's a dispute hallelujah but now the
[1:23:19] abstract brother says now they're
[1:23:21] waiting for the Holy Ghost to come the
[1:23:22] abstract to come down to the title
[1:23:25] hallelujah so now when the Holy Ghost
[1:23:27] came upon them God was proving to them
[1:23:29] everything the devil could hold against
[1:23:31] you and has held against you has been
[1:23:33] struck off how they said every single
[1:23:36] thing that devil held against you has
[1:23:38] been struck off malius from now so now
[1:23:41] they were they weren't just title
[1:23:43] holders they had an abstract title so
[1:23:45] that means everything that Christ died
[1:23:47] for they now felt it to a mean said you
[1:23:50] know yours just like you know you know
[1:23:53] it's just like Moses taking the children
[1:23:54] of Israel and - well Joshua did it took
[1:23:57] them into the Promised Land there were
[1:23:59] nations in that land that said it
[1:24:00] belongs to me right Jericho said no this
[1:24:03] is belongs to Jericho AI and whatever
[1:24:06] more so now what happened God came down
[1:24:08] and said I'm going to strike all these
[1:24:11] people off the deed I'm going to push
[1:24:13] them out of the land that everything
[1:24:15] that I have given you in the promised
[1:24:16] land you will possess it hallelujah and
[1:24:19] then what happened God came down took
[1:24:21] over the battle he lead them in the
[1:24:23] battle they took Jericho they took
[1:24:24] they either took every paddle and
[1:24:27] hallelujah amen and that was and we know
[1:24:30] that was finally fully done under thee
[1:24:33] under the rulership of King David they
[1:24:36] took the fullness of the land hallelujah
[1:24:40] amen now so there has been no now when
[1:24:48] when Samuel and and I'll just go into
[1:24:51] this quickly now when Samuel took the
[1:24:53] annul
[1:24:54] he's told Samuel took a Horn of oil and
[1:24:57] and and he was instructed to go to
[1:25:00] Jesse's house and anoint one of his sons
[1:25:03] because one of his sons had been
[1:25:04] prepared as a king of Israel now he took
[1:25:08] that so here was a vindicated prophet he
[1:25:11] took the Horn of anointing oil and he
[1:25:13] didn't just dribble a bit I believe on
[1:25:15] on David's head he poured the whole
[1:25:17] thing out so anointing an anointing was
[1:25:20] released upon an age right so when for a
[1:25:23] time of Judges Saul fails now a kingship
[1:25:25] was going to be established the hair he
[1:25:27] took the Horn of anointing oil and
[1:25:29] poured it out hallelujah and it all went
[1:25:31] over David so now what was in the horn
[1:25:34] the the the the anointing oil horn what
[1:25:38] was in it was now upon a man so God
[1:25:41] poured out the fullness of that
[1:25:43] anointing upon a man David hallelujah so
[1:25:46] now here is a man who has gone to fully
[1:25:49] establish the kingdom everything every
[1:25:51] part of the land that was promised to
[1:25:53] Joshua right King David is going to take
[1:25:56] it now amen
[1:25:58] and so here he was so so the anointing
[1:26:00] was fully poured out on him and then
[1:26:03] what was in David came to life amen so
[1:26:09] now but then they had anointing that
[1:26:11] came upon David at what you know didn't
[1:26:13] just fall on him it fell on his mighty
[1:26:15] men right the anointing that was on him
[1:26:18] fell on his mighty men they did great
[1:26:20] exploits fighting battles and it wasn't
[1:26:22] Hollywood it wasn't choreographed it was
[1:26:24] just all that bloodshed but one killed
[1:26:26] 800 you know your others stood and did
[1:26:28] great things why was the anointing that
[1:26:30] was on David because they knew he was
[1:26:31] coming into power fell upon them but
[1:26:34] then just fall upon them I mean David
[1:26:36] received the play
[1:26:37] for the temple rites the what was in the
[1:26:40] horn was now being manifested through an
[1:26:42] Ag following me I mean so that wasn't
[1:26:44] just on now the plans for the temple but
[1:26:46] then David you know his inspiration came
[1:26:49] upon the musicians came upon the singers
[1:26:51] right so what was in the horn came upon
[1:26:53] him came upon the mighty man came upon
[1:26:55] the musicians came upon the priests I
[1:26:57] mean when David brought the ark unto
[1:26:59] thee and to the you know into the city
[1:27:02] and it was building the tabernacle of
[1:27:03] David he wasn't an outer court there
[1:27:05] anymore is just as your center tent and
[1:27:07] those who gathered round their tent
[1:27:08] around the Ark they received the
[1:27:10] inspiration from the word hallelujah I
[1:27:12] mean so so all of that was in the horn
[1:27:16] and it was poured out now here we are
[1:27:20] here we are living in this day where we
[1:27:23] have received a vindicated prophet a
[1:27:25] proven prophet vindicate / vindicated
[1:27:28] and wasn't it what was he really told to
[1:27:31] do take the horn
[1:27:32] take the word pour it out pour it out
[1:27:37] upon a people hallelujah that's what is
[1:27:40] in the word will become manifested
[1:27:42] everything that was in the horn put on
[1:27:44] flesh hallelujah wasn't just now just an
[1:27:47] anointing that sat there know when God
[1:27:48] pours out his anointing I mean when God
[1:27:51] pours out his word as to manifest what's
[1:27:53] in his word when Samuel you know God
[1:27:55] told um yo yo I believe it's in Genesis
[1:27:59] he says now the scepter shall not depart
[1:28:01] from Judah until Shiloh come right so
[1:28:04] there will be a kingship come out of
[1:28:05] Judah
[1:28:06] so that was fulfilled when David became
[1:28:08] King because he came out of Judah Allu
[1:28:11] yeah right so now here was the kingship
[1:28:12] and Judah so the anointing that was
[1:28:15] poured out from Samuel made that
[1:28:17] manifest hallelujah I mean so so here
[1:28:21] comes a vindicated prophet in this day
[1:28:22] because it's got to be a time where the
[1:28:25] day of judges or the seven churches
[1:28:27] comes to an end rice no longer revival
[1:28:30] people come free the devil comes in with
[1:28:33] false doctrine different things binds
[1:28:35] them down and then and then you know
[1:28:37] other people get free and then they get
[1:28:39] bound down by the devil again there's
[1:28:41] got to come into that right the
[1:28:43] Lutheran's came out of the Dark Ages
[1:28:44] Jesse I lived by faith they were free
[1:28:46] they see now how can we organize this to
[1:28:48] keep it as it is
[1:28:50] they put a pier
[1:28:51] at the end of their beliefs put God in a
[1:28:53] box God couldn't God cannot be bound
[1:28:55] he's got to move on in the Methodist
[1:28:57] different ones rose up but they put God
[1:28:59] in a box God cannot be boxed so God has
[1:29:04] to move on while the people get free but
[1:29:06] then they say how can we keep this and
[1:29:07] we control it they try and control and
[1:29:10] the good intentions put God in a box God
[1:29:12] has to you know the cycle of revival and
[1:29:14] death continues down through but there
[1:29:17] has to come a time when that cycle has
[1:29:18] ended hallelujah
[1:29:20] where it's not just revival and death
[1:29:22] its revival how they're just unfolding
[1:29:25] as I said these bad cycles is good
[1:29:28] cycles we happen to be living in the
[1:29:30] best cycle I mean where where where time
[1:29:32] is coming to an end and time is blending
[1:29:35] with eternity how it's just like when
[1:29:37] Samuel came along he anointed David
[1:29:39] there was now the end of Judges had come
[1:29:41] to an end now a different cycle was
[1:29:43] coming into Israel I mean when now the
[1:29:45] kingship was going to be established
[1:29:47] hallelujah it's just like now we have a
[1:29:49] vindicated prophet come to this age he
[1:29:51] poured out the anointing why because the
[1:29:53] millenniums coming I meant the cycle of
[1:29:56] time is coming to an end the cycle of
[1:29:58] the church ages has come to an end
[1:30:01] hallelujah amen so now in that in that
[1:30:05] anointing oil and that horn that was
[1:30:07] poured out as I said was David as mighty
[1:30:09] men the singers the musicians I mean
[1:30:11] there was the worship all those things
[1:30:13] were the plans for the temple that was
[1:30:14] all poured out lujah so now here we are
[1:30:17] and God has poured out his anointing who
[1:30:21] believes it Amen we know we know you
[1:30:24] know you just go look at history they
[1:30:27] attribute there's a there's something
[1:30:28] called the post-world War two a healing
[1:30:30] revival it changed the world change the
[1:30:33] world who initiated it they say brother
[1:30:34] Bram did even those who are just
[1:30:37] historians those don't even believe the
[1:30:39] message they say his ministry did it it
[1:30:42] sparked all Roberts it's back Tommy
[1:30:44] Osbourne sparked many ministries that
[1:30:46] have changed the world but it was his
[1:30:48] ministry that did it what happened he
[1:30:50] was a prophet he is pouring out an
[1:30:51] anointing hallelujah but this anointing
[1:30:55] this anointing they poured out of the
[1:30:56] horn is different to the to the
[1:30:59] anointing that he poured out on Saul
[1:31:01] cuz Samuel took a vial of oil and ported
[1:31:05] on Saul
[1:31:05] while speaks of a judgement you know the
[1:31:07] book of Revelation is the vials are
[1:31:08] poured out it's God's wrath God's
[1:31:10] judgment poured out right so we haven't
[1:31:12] a we haven't received an anointing like
[1:31:15] salted we're its judgment being poured
[1:31:17] out this is not that no no this is to
[1:31:20] establish a kingship this is to
[1:31:22] establish a kingdom hallelujah this is
[1:31:24] to establish a victory hallelujah amen
[1:31:28] so now so now here comes as I said
[1:31:31] brother brown he poured out the
[1:31:33] anointing on this age and you see
[1:31:35] everything from that time till now has
[1:31:38] manifested in its fullness I mean you
[1:31:41] see people they come under the and and
[1:31:43] it's what's in you comes out I mean you
[1:31:46] see people they come in under the word
[1:31:48] and what's been buried in them comes to
[1:31:50] life hallelujah and it's not always weak
[1:31:53] amen but then it's not always you know
[1:31:56] because in us and this is a carnal
[1:31:58] nature you see Peter you know you see
[1:32:01] him he came under the anointing in his
[1:32:02] age tried to kill the you know high
[1:32:05] priests servant you know you know the
[1:32:07] sword do that and the garden you know he
[1:32:10] did all different kinds of things cuz in
[1:32:11] him was a pride it had to come out he
[1:32:15] was still he was still seed God knows
[1:32:17] how to cultivate hallelujah he knows he
[1:32:21] doesn't just want dormant seeds and you
[1:32:23] know in people he wants them to come out
[1:32:25] so he can grab them out hallelujah so so
[1:32:28] Peter needed a grubbing hallelujah but
[1:32:32] it was all for as good
[1:32:34] Amen but you see people come under the
[1:32:36] anointing and and things just start
[1:32:38] growing out of their lives didn't even
[1:32:39] know was there
[1:32:40] hallelujah but even all within that I
[1:32:43] believe I'm looking at God's wheat
[1:32:46] hallelujah amen that has come to life
[1:32:51] brother Brahim says in the from from
[1:32:54] reading revelations 5 there when he's
[1:32:59] speaking of the horns on thee when we
[1:33:02] read how the lamb stepped forth with
[1:33:04] seven horns and seven eyes he speaks
[1:33:08] about that was in the breeches the seven
[1:33:12] horns was the seven churches see the
[1:33:14] seven church ages because there was the
[1:33:17] Lambs protection what he
[1:33:19] take that his rights worth on the earth
[1:33:21] was a god-sent group of people that
[1:33:24] protected see the Horn of the Lamb so
[1:33:27] now the devil has claims to this world
[1:33:29] it belongs to me he says because I made
[1:33:31] it fall of now God right of this world
[1:33:34] but if as long as God has a witness upon
[1:33:37] the earth is a dispute and that's why
[1:33:40] down to why did he kill Abel because now
[1:33:41] if he can kill Abel now no one can claim
[1:33:43] it's mine right God has no one on the
[1:33:46] earth that's why he tried to kill Moses
[1:33:48] you know that's why he tried to stop the
[1:33:50] deliverer coming isn't it amazing this
[1:33:52] is the devil's scheme he builds a
[1:33:54] civilization he tries to wipe out the
[1:33:56] one who's ordained to to tear it down
[1:33:58] and deliver God's people and the very
[1:34:00] one that's going to do the job he
[1:34:02] actually protects in the palace
[1:34:04] hallelujah Moses Moses was the ordained
[1:34:06] one smoke you're his mother said you
[1:34:09] know you're going to do it you're going
[1:34:10] to fulfill the prophecy and he said you
[1:34:12] know the devil gets a word he tries to
[1:34:14] kill all the male children and then the
[1:34:16] very one that's going to do the job
[1:34:18] comes into his palace comes into
[1:34:20] Pharaoh's Palace hallelujah and and he's
[1:34:23] nurtured from Pharaoh's table he's he's
[1:34:26] protected and Pharaoh's Palace right and
[1:34:29] it's the very one that's gonna tear his
[1:34:31] kingdom down it's actually the living
[1:34:32] right in the throne room you could say
[1:34:34] hallelujah Amen yo the devil made the
[1:34:38] civilization here we are in the
[1:34:40] civilization hallelujah amen but we're
[1:34:43] ordained actually that the civilization
[1:34:45] will come to an end why has it come to
[1:34:47] an end the bride takes a rapture amen is
[1:34:50] a wedding supper than in this millennium
[1:34:52] hallelujah and then all the devil's
[1:34:54] devices are done away with amen we're
[1:34:58] here to end time if I can put it that
[1:35:00] way
[1:35:00] because once the brightest translated
[1:35:02] then we have three and a half years and
[1:35:03] we have a thousand years of millennium
[1:35:05] and then there's a season with the
[1:35:06] devils loose but times coming to an end
[1:35:08] you know how you feel I'm running out of
[1:35:10] time because time is running out I mean
[1:35:14] so they are these seven horns represent
[1:35:18] Christ and his bride the seven church
[1:35:20] ages and they are protecting they are
[1:35:23] what he protects his rights with on the
[1:35:25] earth so now here we have down through
[1:35:28] the ages God has always had a witness
[1:35:30] hallelujah because as long
[1:35:33] they are there the devil can't say it's
[1:35:35] mine because there's actually others on
[1:35:37] the earth actually saying no it's mine
[1:35:39] God take no no my children on the earth
[1:35:41] the earth belongs to them why did he
[1:35:43] make this earth Adam and Eve it's yours
[1:35:45] subdue it do what you want your gods
[1:35:47] over this earth he made this earth for
[1:35:49] his children he didn't make the earth
[1:35:52] for the devil righteous it's just like
[1:35:54] this this earth he didn't make it for
[1:35:56] the devil he didn't make our minds for
[1:35:58] the devil right here and make it for his
[1:36:00] mind battles and stress and problems and
[1:36:02] you know things that upset us this isn't
[1:36:05] made for the devil it's made for God
[1:36:07] hallelujah this is actually we are a
[1:36:10] temple of the Holy Ghost we know a
[1:36:12] temple of Satan oh yes but the devils is
[1:36:16] not there gonna be my house then God's
[1:36:17] is no no not in my house there my place
[1:36:19] of my rest they don't belong to you
[1:36:22] hallelujah but we need to recognize that
[1:36:24] as I said when the Holy Ghost came down
[1:36:26] in the upper room was it they received
[1:36:28] an abstract title deed no have you
[1:36:31] received that abstract have you received
[1:36:35] it tarik if you if you really met him
[1:36:37] God is saying that I've I've wiped away
[1:36:40] what you've done and what you will do
[1:36:42] sure you have to confess your sins but
[1:36:45] he but when when he saves you you're not
[1:36:48] under probation are you gonna you know
[1:36:49] if you're good enough in you know maybe
[1:36:51] you'll make it now you're sealed in you
[1:36:53] seal them howl ooh you doesn't that make
[1:36:57] you happy you say but I don't know about
[1:37:01] that bull are you fully believing and
[1:37:03] trusting in the blood because if you're
[1:37:05] worried about or how you're gonna do
[1:37:07] you're putting yourself into your own
[1:37:09] salvation and God will not let any man
[1:37:11] glorify himself
[1:37:12] Helly that's why we say oh we've got to
[1:37:15] do to him we get all all of us he
[1:37:16] actually allows you to fall because
[1:37:18] you've got to come to a place where it's
[1:37:20] like lord I can't do this at my own
[1:37:21] strength
[1:37:22] and he doesn't want you to do it in your
[1:37:24] own strength he wants him to do it amen
[1:37:31] now where are we okay I'll just I'll
[1:37:35] just wrap this up but brother I'm
[1:37:39] seasoned gods provide a place of worship
[1:37:41] he says and we're in Christ Jesus by
[1:37:44] spiritual baptism not by water by spirit
[1:37:47] baptized into one body which is Christ
[1:37:49] the worshiping place then being in there
[1:37:51] we are on this ground like it's like the
[1:37:54] abstract deed you say I bought a piece
[1:37:57] of ground it isn't yours until you got
[1:37:59] an abstract but if you've got an
[1:38:01] abstract that shows that everything was
[1:38:03] ever against that piece of ground has
[1:38:05] been struck enough and when you become a
[1:38:07] Christian and accept Christ as your
[1:38:09] Savior then when God sends down the
[1:38:12] abstract that shows no matter what your
[1:38:14] father did your mother did or anyone
[1:38:16] else did your mother daddy might have
[1:38:18] been drunkards prostitutes whatever it
[1:38:19] was every sin is stricken off you've got
[1:38:22] an abstract title there is nothing can
[1:38:25] put you off it and look everything
[1:38:26] that's on the grounds belongs to you
[1:38:28] amen and when you're in Christ Jesus by
[1:38:31] the bettors baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:33] every gift of God belongs in the church
[1:38:35] amen it's an abstract title deed you
[1:38:37] it's yours it belongs your quickens your
[1:38:39] mortal bodies oh my if we think of it
[1:38:43] let's take well um look at those
[1:38:45] faithful ones at Pentecost they were all
[1:38:47] in the upper room there they all was
[1:38:48] scared they had the title alright but
[1:38:51] they was afraid and all at once they
[1:38:53] came a sound from heaven the abstract
[1:38:55] sent down to them like a rushing mighty
[1:38:57] wind filled all the house where they
[1:39:00] were sitting and they were so quickened
[1:39:02] by that till all the cowardness one of
[1:39:04] them was afraid that even the night he
[1:39:06] wasn't a Pharisee you know even a said
[1:39:08] you see ever win that Holy Spirit fell
[1:39:10] and baptized them into Jesus Christ he
[1:39:13] became flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:39:15] bone word of his word he was a new
[1:39:17] creation he was a new person at quicken
[1:39:20] his body look what it did what is it
[1:39:23] what does it do when it comes in it
[1:39:25] won't make you go out and say I'm
[1:39:26] Methodist I'm Baptist oh I know I
[1:39:29] oughtn't to smoke in order to do this or
[1:39:31] to wear these kind of clothes I want to
[1:39:33] do this or to do that it's so quick and
[1:39:36] you till you have to do it it quickens
[1:39:38] your mortal bodies so when you've really
[1:39:41] received the abstract the Holy Ghost it
[1:39:43] will bring this into subjection I mean
[1:39:46] to the things you once loved you cannot
[1:39:47] do because you don't ever desire anymore
[1:39:49] and it's not you training yourself just
[1:39:52] like as I said before I could live in a
[1:39:54] brewery and I'd be the most sober man in
[1:39:57] all the world because there's no desire
[1:39:59] in here
[1:40:00] way from alcohol I don't have to
[1:40:01] struggle every day thou shalt not drink
[1:40:03] I mean it's written God writes it in
[1:40:06] your heart however he reprograms you aim
[1:40:09] in this that is therefore now I don't I
[1:40:11] just don't want it hallelujah it's not
[1:40:14] me trying to keep myself from what I
[1:40:16] once did no it's taken out of me I mean
[1:40:19] just like computer games you'll move
[1:40:21] your rock-and-roll music whatever it was
[1:40:23] I don't have to keep away from those
[1:40:24] things I don't have to live in just like
[1:40:26] a monastery somewhere there's nothing in
[1:40:29] me that wants it no more and it's not me
[1:40:31] that changed my desire he changed my
[1:40:33] desire he changed me to love his word
[1:40:36] what happened the abstract came down and
[1:40:38] quickened me to his word hallelujah and
[1:40:41] that's what this message does I make
[1:40:43] quickens us that the word lives out of
[1:40:45] us we don't have to try and be
[1:40:47] Christians
[1:40:48] he's the Christian in us if you just let
[1:40:50] him come and he will be the Christian in
[1:40:53] you I'm glad that's the case isn't it
[1:40:56] I mean God said I'll walk on them I'll
[1:40:59] be their God they'll be my people
[1:41:01] hallelujah walk with me Lord Jesus walk
[1:41:03] at me amen so I mean so so quickens you
[1:41:07] too you have to do it a quickened your
[1:41:09] mortal bodies amen
[1:41:11] now notice how lujah so now here we are
[1:41:17] now as I said the devil he said I've got
[1:41:22] claims on them because of false doctrine
[1:41:23] and that's why God sent God sent a
[1:41:28] prophet in this day because they had to
[1:41:30] be a title search I meant just like a
[1:41:32] piece of ground you say now does anyone
[1:41:35] else have claims on this what are the
[1:41:36] boundaries yet all those things we've
[1:41:37] got to be defined before it can be sold
[1:41:40] rights as someone who's qualified has to
[1:41:42] do a title search they're going to
[1:41:44] search is there any other disputes any
[1:41:46] other problems on this piece of ground
[1:41:47] and once they have all been struck
[1:41:49] enough then it can be sold right so now
[1:41:52] God sends God sends the Prophet on this
[1:41:55] day and he does a title search he starts
[1:41:58] from water baptism why cuz what happened
[1:42:01] God said baptize in the name of Jesus
[1:42:03] Christ take on my name just like a woman
[1:42:06] takes on the husband's name take on my
[1:42:08] name be buried with me in Baptism you'll
[1:42:10] come for the newness of life hallelujah
[1:42:13] but in the
[1:42:13] Kable oh don't do that just say didn't
[1:42:15] say the words name a father son Holy
[1:42:17] Ghost Oh them but God didn't say say
[1:42:20] those words when you baptized baptized
[1:42:22] in my name hallelujah
[1:42:25] so he changed the baptism there's
[1:42:26] baptizing a babies and not adults
[1:42:28] no more sprinkling of water or whatever
[1:42:30] what's happening that is now the devil's
[1:42:32] inside now they've received what I have
[1:42:33] given them so now I I can accuse them
[1:42:36] and then they and then the devil came in
[1:42:39] took took God from the Old Testament
[1:42:41] saying behold thy Lord as one is now
[1:42:44] you're three three three substances
[1:42:46] three three persons and then another
[1:42:49] devil says now they believe my Godhead
[1:42:51] and all the way down through and now
[1:42:54] they believe it but and and then he
[1:42:56] changed the communion now they believe
[1:42:58] that the bread and the wine literally
[1:43:01] become the body of Christ and down on
[1:43:03] down on down but that's why now we've
[1:43:05] come to an age where God said I shall
[1:43:07] restore but he seemed to vindicate a
[1:43:09] prophet to do a title search struck off
[1:43:12] the Godhead showed us who God was showed
[1:43:15] us how to be baptized showed us how to
[1:43:17] love struck up all the liens that the
[1:43:19] devil had against the church they were
[1:43:21] struck off and this last day hallelujah
[1:43:23] so now the devil has no claims
[1:43:26] whatsoever
[1:43:27] amen here with me I mean the blood of
[1:43:30] Jesus Christ has cleanse us from all sin
[1:43:32] his word has been restored that we don't
[1:43:35] believe in lying be damned by it
[1:43:37] hallelujah amen and that's why it's so
[1:43:41] glorious in this day because now there's
[1:43:43] nothing holding us that we can't take a
[1:43:46] rapture there's nothing holding us when
[1:43:49] God calls we have to go there's nothing
[1:43:52] there's no chain of unbelief or doubt or
[1:43:54] false doctor anything that's I can't
[1:43:56] hold the bride down hallelujah there's
[1:43:59] no habit there's no sin there's nothing
[1:44:01] that will hold her down hey God wants
[1:44:03] you all to himself he doesn't want to
[1:44:06] share you with nothing
[1:44:08] amen we have a clear title I mean when
[1:44:14] Jesus said the devil there's no part of
[1:44:16] me and I have no part in him you can say
[1:44:18] the same thing the devil has no part of
[1:44:20] me I have no part in him I have not
[1:44:22] associated with him in any war I've got
[1:44:24] no relationship with him anymore that's
[1:44:27] all
[1:44:27] severed that's all been struck off and
[1:44:30] there's no claims you say but I did this
[1:44:33] and I did this and I thought this did
[1:44:35] the blood take care of it
[1:44:37] stop trying to inject yourself until you
[1:44:39] taking a rapture he will take you in the
[1:44:41] rapture right hallelujah he saved you
[1:44:44] salvation is not your your ability least
[1:44:48] yeah it is a it is the grace of God a
[1:44:51] gift of God least any man should boast
[1:44:54] hallelujah
[1:44:55] it's not us both you know oh you both
[1:44:57] know we don't boast in ourselves we
[1:44:59] boast in him hallelujah

[1:45:16] you hallelujah he's going to change
[1:45:19] these bodies amen if he if he turned
[1:45:21] your soul from doubt - - to faith he can
[1:45:24] change these these mortal quicken them
[1:45:26] change these mortal bodies holy we've
[1:45:30] got a clear title but I have this guilt
[1:45:33] let him take the guilt he took let's go
[1:45:36] to Isaiah 53 let's just read this
[1:45:38] because I love it you know God doesn't
[1:45:40] leave loopholes hallelujah
[1:45:44] he covers everything
[1:45:59] let's go to Isaiah 53 and three let's
[1:46:03] just read this he is despised and
[1:46:09] rejected of men a man of sorrows and
[1:46:11] acquainted with grief if you're
[1:46:14] acquainted with it you you have a
[1:46:15] relationship with it
[1:46:17] so he knew always like to be acquainted
[1:46:19] with grief and we hid as it were our
[1:46:22] faces from him he was despised and we
[1:46:25] esteemed him not
[1:46:26] surely he has borne our griefs and
[1:46:28] carried our sorrows when you carry
[1:46:33] something you understand what it's like
[1:46:38] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[1:46:40] of God and afflicted but he was wounded
[1:46:43] for our transgressions he was bruised
[1:46:46] for our iniquities you mean even the
[1:46:50] things we know not to do we do it anyway
[1:46:52] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:46:56] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[1:46:59] healed we're all like sheep have gone
[1:47:02] astray all of us we have turned everyone
[1:47:06] to his own way and the LORD hath laid on
[1:47:08] him the iniquity of us all he was
[1:47:10] oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened
[1:47:11] not his mouth
[1:47:12] he has brought as a lamb to the
[1:47:14] slaughter as a sheep before his
[1:47:15] Shearer's is dumb so he opened not his
[1:47:17] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[1:47:20] judgment and who probably shall declare
[1:47:22] his generation for he was cut off of the
[1:47:24] land of the living for the transgression
[1:47:26] of my people was he stricken and he made
[1:47:30] his grave with the wicked and with the
[1:47:31] rich in his death because he had done no
[1:47:33] violence neither was any deceit in his
[1:47:36] mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[1:47:39] him and he has put him to grief when
[1:47:43] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[1:47:45] sin he shall see his seed he shall
[1:47:47] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[1:47:50] Lord shall prosper in his hand so that
[1:47:56] covers everything transgressions and it
[1:48:00] could ease and the chastisement of our
[1:48:02] peace was upon him and with His stripes
[1:48:03] were healed that covers everything so
[1:48:08] why do we why do we carry regret
[1:48:12] and and guilt why do we do it if he's
[1:48:17] taking care of it give it to him walk on
[1:48:23] he said well I fail them every day but
[1:48:26] that's why he died for us that we could
[1:48:28] serve Him amen
[1:48:31] he's not angry at us because we're human
[1:48:34] right God looks at the heart
[1:48:36] what we want to be amen
[1:48:39] Oh God looks at the heart many people
[1:48:41] use it as an excuse I mean cuz it
[1:48:44] because of God yet God does look at the
[1:48:45] Hat what do you want to be because what
[1:48:47] you want to be is what you will become
[1:48:49] right just say I want to be an astronaut
[1:48:52] if that's really the desire of my heart
[1:48:53] oh and if I have the ability I will
[1:48:55] become an astronaut right he said I want
[1:48:58] to serve the Lord I want to serve him
[1:48:59] with everything I have you will become
[1:49:01] that as you yield to him you will become

[1:49:10] God's taking care of it we have a clear
[1:49:13] title
[1:49:14] Allu yeah but you've got to put your
[1:49:17] life in his hands even you know it's
[1:49:19] wonderful when you first get saved
[1:49:21] hallelujah right but when you start
[1:49:24] walking with him for some reason we get
[1:49:27] because we so want to sincerely serve
[1:49:30] Him we don't want to displease him we
[1:49:33] don't know we don't want to hurt him in
[1:49:35] any way but yet we we overcome but yet
[1:49:39] we fail sometimes and we carried it I
[1:49:42] failed the test
[1:49:43] y'all but get up it's got him the Falls

[1:50:09] sword but you'll deny me amen
[1:50:13] did that change the Lord's attitude
[1:50:15] towards Peter he still said you're gonna
[1:50:17] have the keys you're gonna be the
[1:50:18] spokesman on the day of Pentecost it
[1:50:19] didn't change that hallelujah and if
