righteous are ordered of the lord so we still love you and we are so thankful to be in the house of the lord this night and without any waste of time i would like us just to have a word of prayer just to approach our lord jesus reverently this evening for he knows it all amen let's pray our most gracious eternal heavenly father god we stand in your presence tonight lord not because we are worthy not because we are qualified not because we deserve it law but because of your death at the cross of calvary it is because of your choice it is because of your full knowledge father that we stand here tonight lord is not our own intelligence it's not our own ability but it's your grace that brought us here and we standing father god to appreciate you the bible taught us master that no matter what can happen no devil will ever separate us from your love no force or power will ever be able will have any capacity to separate us and that is why we are so thankful that is why lord we are thankful that we have gone through so many gays to be here and master we thank you for the day we thank you for all the work that has been done we thank you for our jobs we thank you for the school activities everything you have kept your children safe to come and meet them in this evening at the appointed time and master we just want to come now reverently humbling ourselves lord that you can speak to our hearts we're not here to listen to a man to listen to the intelligence or ability of a man or our brother father we are here to hear from thee therefore lord we commit and submit ourselves in your hands because your hands are capable i pray that you help each one and just speak to our hearts tonight and lord we ask you to forgive us forgive our iniquity forgive our mistakes forgive our foolishness our holy master that we so often beset you and upset you maybe sometimes and let you down and disappoint you but you are god you've got such a great heart that forgives us david said your love your mercy and your grace endureth forever and we want to come on the basis of that way that was spoken father bless your people tonight we just want to welcome you in our midst holy spirit that you can take control and be in charge of every spirit lord god in your presence we ask thankfully in the name of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you richly believers and um this is the midweek service and we're going to try to just to refresh i'm not sure what is wrong with my glasses maybe my eyes are tired i i see i see difference thank you musicians may god bless you may god really add your gifts thank you for that uh was it an item brother ben thank you so much i just had a beautiful voice as i came through and i said my someone is singing so nicely and i looked and it was part of the band said man we are living under our privileges this is a gift that must be must bring you know glory and uplift god's people amen so while we're standing i'm not sure if my volume is okay and but while we're standing we are going to read the scripture in the book of first corinthians amen i trust that we have had a good day a good week so far you know with a believer is what we call evergreen with a believer we are we are an evergreen project amen we're not up and down there is up and downs but we are above that we are an ever green project of the lord jesus christ hallelujah so we'll read the first corinthians um chapter 11 again and i want someone who's got a sharp memory someone who can remember things where we ended last time when we spoke about descending the body of the lord amen how many remembers um first corinthians chapter 11 and then we'll read from verse 25 amen once you are there please just say amen amen try to be as quick as possible redeeming our time seeing that time is no more amen 25 after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this dewey as oft as he drink it in remembrance of me amen this is a communal scripture but i said last time we are not going to eat communion but we are going to be in the communion tonight for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup he do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord amen and verse 20 8 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup after examination are we together for he he that drink that eateth and drink it unworthily eaten and drinketh damnation to himself not descending the lord's body do you remember this so i must examine myself each one of you must examine themselves not using your own answer sheet but using the question paper using the the script using the the great uh uh what does the prophet call it you know using using the the word assessing yourself amen doing what you call a word test for yourself before you can drink and eat the bread you must be ready right and don't not do it unwittingly but yes i want us to speak more on the spiritual realm so verse 29 says um for for for he that eateth and drink it unworthily eat it and drink it damnation to himself not descending the lord's body so it's important to descend the lord's body listen to verse 30 for this course for this thing of eating and drinking unworthily for this thing of not examining ourselves many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep i don't think the bible speaks about just sleeping at home you know this is a spiritual sleepless slumber the bible is talking about let's pray once more lord jesus we just wanna thank you again for your weight that we have read please inspire it lord please anoint it that it can bless your people we know that you say these things to a let us to motivate us to remind us lord we you have already chosen us but lord you don't want to lose us therefore you mitigate every risk to tell us what we ought to do in this day and age you commit your weight you commit your people hear us and the speaker alike in the name of our lord jesus christ amen please enjoy the comfort of your seats while i remain standing amen so we have read there in that we we realize the importance of checking ourselves we realize the importance of examining ourselves the bible says if your heart condemns you not that means god has put something in us to help us to examine ourselves therefore we can we must not be rigid right we must be pliable you know when something is playable you know what he's he's the potter i am the clay so he mold us right let me not be too hasty all right let's read the romans oh that thing is stuck i'm not so good with computers right now we're gonna read roman chapter 12 and then i'll read the um sorry i'm just trying to get my computer right it's frozen the enemy is fighting uh let's read um romans chapter 12. if you are there i'll read it for you but i want us to focus on verse four just relax don't even have to put your seatbelt just relax calm down right um i would love to read it here but if maybe my dear friend brother andy can come and just check it for me i'll appreciate it i don't know what's wrong with it roman chapter 12 um what i want to rephrase it's refreshing or what thank you you know i'll call the person who i know is gonna let's read romans chapter 12 in the meantime are we together what did i say the best is for amen thank you so much bible readers and listeners for us for us we have many members in one body all members have not the same office right so we being many are one body in christ and every one member one of another hey this is powerful it's like we can just pause here and go home the moment we just catch the revelation of what this scripture says we go home for we being many many members but one body and every one member one of another what does that tell you that is joined together we might be different offices different parts but we need to understand the revelation of being in one body thank you so much my brother god bless you oops yeah right so thank you brother andy i'll read one more scripture for you but don't have to page it first corinthians 6 what from verse 19 what now you know that your body is the temple of holy of the holy ghost which is in you your body temples it houses the holy spirit because it's inside you your body so it means that in as much as we are not focused on the physical body but our physical body our spiritual body our soul they are all interjoined they all have an impact one to the other just life is a church right some are brothers some are sisters some are deacons some are trustees some are pastors some are teachers some are prof uh prophet we have prophets no but they've got gifts of prophecy so all those different gifts and positions but we are all one body right so the message is that there's somebody who is inside us as a church there's somebody who's inside you as a church you as an individual who is your pastor as an individual right he's he's your leader he's your pastor he's guiding you the bible says he leads you everywhere right so that person is the holy spirit he is housed inside you you don't do things of your own right therefore the bible says invest uh oh yeah let me finish that verse first what now you know that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which he have of god and he are not your own you don't belong to yourself that that reminds me of the sermon of pride that same one i was not here but when i listened to it man i said lord humble me you know god does not love a proud heart and now the devil because he's and i'm deviating now but the devil because he's so proud uh he realized that if he gives us pride openly and bring it and paint it on us openly the way that he did in heaven he realized that we've got enough revelation to pick him up so what he does he he's so subtle he's so subtle and pride i don't know i don't want to preach the same one again but it's such a subtle thing sometimes especially to a believer he comes in ways that we may not detect and you find yourself being a proud person and away so we need to check that and listen to that same one again and be very careful amen but that's 20 this is where i am going i don't know why i went there verse 20 or first corinthians 6 4 we are born with a price you are bored with a price your husband has paid dowry but you call it lovola in my language he has paid a price just like isaac did when they sent eleazar he paid a great price there's no amount of money gold silver that can buy you so so so even though you are a wife he brought all sorts of gifts and gave you thank you for that someone brother marion you know and then he he he brought gifts for you he brought everything but the biggest gift that he brought was his life our father demanded life to pay for this bride so he left everything and he came down that is why he says you are bored with your price therefore glorify god in your body every fiber every neuron every nerve every piece of hair every everything in your body mass give glory to god amen that means every piece of a shakkaina tabernacle every leg every hand every mouth every teeth every toe of this body must bring glory to god i have never seen a body that fight against itself we'll get there just now i want us to focus tonight at just two or three questions why is it important to descend the body of the lord why why is it so important right we need to know how it works to understand the functionalities of this body of the lord because the body of the lord is not just in new zealand the body of the lord is not just in south africa the body of the lord is not just in combat cambodia or vietnam or china or singapore or south korea no the body of the lord is across the globe amen it is um and what what what i did i always forget this weight a universal and um mystical thank you it's a mystical body of the bride of the lord so now it has got functions it has got things that it does and if you have the revelation how that body works you will work very seamlessly you you live very easily right you the body will never work against itself and the moment you understand how the body works you've got no problem you're not gonna go eat something like i said last time that you know when you eat it you react you're not going to do that because you know you understand your body that you you wake up late you sleep late that you like brother cuban you are in any riser if you are an early riser therefore you can't sleep like at 12 like me or at one because you know you're an early riser you know my body's routine is this way you know that if i eat this i get constipation you know that oh you you understand you got you can't understand how your body functions so spiritually we must have spiritual eyes to know how the body of the lord works to understand that we are not dealing with humans here you are dealing with the bride of the living god which was bought by a great price including you hallelujah thank you why is it so important to understand the body of the lord do you understand you you need to understand the greater the bigger picture the vision of the king there's a song that says don't lose your vision of jesus [Music] keep your eyes on him amen because many brothers and sisters have gone by the wayside they lost their view their focus and their vision and how the devil works he makes you to misunderstand things and put them carnally in our mind and you lose the meaning of the body yo imagine if my my hand just decided to leave me you you are you are affecting the body if you are working against the body all right okay let's move on matthew 12 it says and jesus knew their thoughts and he said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought into desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand you must understand that we are a body and you are a body right and we are a global mystical body of the lord and how they gives you know that's why when you pray and the spirit comes down to you you will find yourself even praying for people that you have never met because they are part of you spiritually you intern link with them you are part and parcel of the greater body of the lord hallelujah mark chapter 3 he says and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand can it stand this was after when they saw the lord jesus christ rebuking an evil spirit that came out of a girl or a person and then they said he uses the the head of demons he's using the king of demons called belzebab this story comes from there so he was asking them how can i be the head of the devils then cast the devil out because the devil works with the devil in harmony they don't work against each other they can because of the nature and personality of those demons they can conflict and this but but but on a bigger scale of things on a bigger scheme demons work with demons in harmony therefore believers and believers work together in harmony because they've got the same spirit yes yes the prophet in that message three witnesses he says if he if if if he can show me what's wrong with people in their lives he can show me where to go what to do how long to stay i've seen i've seen so tied up i've been so tied up though i've got it into i got into well at first when i left the baptist church to be interdenominational to help bring the brethren together to do all that i could see i believe that we are all we were all brethren in christ and i don't believe we should be separated it's all right to have different churches own little beliefs but that does not that it isn't a fundamental part the thing is of it is we are brethren see we are together we are all born into one body that's the message that's the main thing that we need to understand right that when my brother feels the pain i must feel it with you when you pray for someone who's got cancer you pray as if that cancer is busy eating you just like when my brother buys a mercedes and he puts me in the mercedes to drive with me i'm so happy i'm enjoying the car it's like it's my it's my car you see i don't mean brother andy i mean any other one you understand what i mean i get you get happy genuinely you get fat you get affected genuinely yeah yeah when someone when you are doing because why you are part of the same body are we together to descend the lord's body let's let's let's go to the next question the first one was just to try to illustrate the importance of understanding the body of the lord what the effects are if you are missing it what the implications could be if you work one against the other not even office not even physically physically i can see we have put luck with one another physically i can see we give each other leaves physically i can see we love one another but are we doing that a spiritual realm is that is the agape love that's right that brother spoke about is the acapella meeting together with the philology are they putting pulling that mission together now let's read them let's go to the next point to descend the lord's body it seems to me that you first have to understand the head of the body christ himself his mind to be one with him is it it means to be one with your brother and your sister there is no way you are going to be one with the lord if you don't want to be one with your brother and your sister there's no way and you just say saying it on the shallow that i love you i'm one with you no and when we the lord you know with the lord i love the lord so much because how many of you know that comb that small comb that will come our hair especially us whose hair can get dry so quickly and it's not so so smooth and so blondies like yours sorry i don't mean your blood but i mean your hair is much softer than us we've got a small little if your hair get mixed up sister mike i see yours and we call it an afro hair comb you know it's good life it's like a fork you come to straighten it up so the lord he does not come david with one come and move the difference no one come right that's how the lord calms us yes goes to bed wow what same god all of you that's how the lord teach us yes but we want to treat one another i go to bed and you call yourself a believer the lord doesn't do that if the lord goes soft on him if the lord goes soft on her say that's how the lord died and that's how the lord teach us his children that's why there's no grandfather or grand uncle or uncle's brother there in heaven or nephew and nieces no my daughter in law no there's no those things there there we are brothers and sisters same age amen so we are preparing for that while we are here we are getting in the spirit of the millennium that's what we are doing we are getting ready we are already living out of the seven church ages while we are here the spirit of laodicea is not supposed to be upon us so in the book of philippians he says and i'll focus quickly to the point because i'm watching my time carefully midweek service it shouldn't shouldn't be long should we give you your meal quickly you grab your meal you move so if you hear that i'm i'm everywhere is just imagine a table full of food all sorts of food you just grab what you want don't want to be structural no let's start the starters and finishers and this no no no there's a table spread you grab hallelujah what you need your body the holy spirit yes he's going to guide you you need sausages man and you need lettuce he's gonna do that for you as the word goes forth right yes that's the spirit let's read philippians 2. if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit of the spirit not much i'm not i'll the fellowship of the spirit of the flesh is very good and that's what we want we must be able to fellowship in the spirit our fellowship in the canal must lead us to the fellowship in the spirit that you intercede that my sister gives the testimony and you just want to jump you feel like the sister speaking to you huh that's how it should be because you are fellowshipping in the spirit you sit here you think of someone in canada and you pray for them amen that is fellowship in the spirit if any bowels of messes fulfill ye my joy that he be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind and that mind is of jesus christ the holy ghost who is inside us he's the leader of this body he's the one we are following the vision let me go down quickly what i want to read is that is um what did i want to read for you okay let nothing be done through strife or vainglory you know what is vainglory but in loneliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves it's it's not an easy thing it's easy to do it pradeep it's easy i mean it's easy to say it than to do it for for someone to esteem them to esteem someone than themselves we preach it but i tell you what to practice it god must help us to be able to be so humble that we we don't esteem ourselves first we esteem someone my brother more than when when you know you we get in the spirit of that man who saw that there was a a beggar on the street and called and he took his jacket cut it in half amen for real yeah not symbolically for real he cut it in half what did the prophet did what did he do with that man he just wanted to give him his shoes he just felt like you know if my father lived he would have been this age and he said man lord i when i look at him that's my shoes i think if the shoes were the same size brother could have given him the shoes amen but those are things that we do on the physical side think about what the prophet does in the spiritual when he plays on the spiritual realm he really has a burden for that person and we without that bothering my brother my sister no our people will not be restored our children our our relatives how can they be restored because we are not entering into their burden right we are not feeling their pain the devil is destroying them we just pray shallow quick five minutes prayer lord and we finish it but we expect god but once in a while god throws something to show us he restores one of our children and we get motivated and that is something that must take us over the mountain to see liberty you know when they cross the mountain on that day the young people went up the mountain and when they saw the sun coming they said freak that's what we need to do for our brothers and sisters and say my brother you are still down there there is liberty i can see the sun yes we are free from today this is the day of jubilee that's what we should be crying and calling yes for those people when they hear you they say i cannot give up now amen then the lord brings those things to our remembrance i cannot assure you he does it to me and i'm telling you i'm a normal human being just like you are and i think he's doing it to you the lord reminds us but we get so easily distracted and we forget who we are and what our job is supposed to be may god help us in just over half an hour now so don't worry but i just want to drive this home that you know we can not easily forget the message of communion the prophet says [Music] he says the father sent me he said in other words the father sent me and i live by him and every man that comes to christ must live by christ oh my there you are that's communion communion is eating the flesh and drinking the blood of christ himself because you are part of him communion is entering into the tent with isaac that's communion that's not because he paid for you he died and then you now move in with him that's a message for some other time how you move in with isaac and right and the communion that happens in there that's what you and your husband are doing there's a carnality of of thinking when every time we say we are the bride we are intimate with the lord we enter in with the lord the eternal mind thinks about a carnal relationship that's not how it is that's the the wrong way though the heavenly way there was never even supposed to be meeting with a woman and a man in the flesh and we come the way we came no it was supposed to be a word production there was going to be a wet intimacy so we think of meat the enemies so much destroyed this channel mind that every time we think of intimacy and when we say we say we are the host we are the bride of the lord and he's our husband people the devil says what we are but the problem is that the devil thinks here yeah that's right we should we are there we are the bride and we are intimate with our father brother and he said even you know that our affections that's where they should be i believe that we can be so much in the spirit until you know our insight has turned our outside affections completely amen oh my there you are that's the communion that's the real communion that you find when you live by christ that's in the spoken communion well that's my that's that's what many times that we do in the spiritual realm you see each day we've got to co to commune with christ we've got to talk to to him each day each so see each day i die yet leave not not me but christ lives in me so is your soul is your physical body needs so if your physical body needs food each day drink each day to survive your spiritual body needs spiritual food and communion with the lord each day to survive amen to survive meaning the opposite is true also if you don't eat the word and pray and commune with the lord every day you want to survive that's the opposite that i'm saying is the truth and we have you have to make it very clear the devil no amen yes jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by everywhere that proceedeth out of the mouth of god i want to run quickly and then get to point number three i'll jump some other golden nuggets here that are nice nice nice let me just read this one for you yes he is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we are to eat his body because his body is the weight you see then his body is his weight because he is the weight and when you eat the weight you become the weight a man when you eat sugar too much you become sugar diabetes when you eat you see when you smoke yes everything that you eat you become yeah that's right when you eat the devil you become the devil that's right my word abides with you in you then you can ask what you will and it will be done i'm waiting for a day i always challenge myself i want this happen to happen in my lifetime where we pray for someone who's got cancer and i see that person i say thank you lord amen it's not like i don't trust the lord but i just want to glorify him and say yes lord your word has been fulfilled in my lifetime i want someone in here to pray for a difficult what's so-called difficult and it happens and the lord is doing it every day but you're not realizing some of them are men god help us there you are that's true see what you will it will come to pass let's talk about the relationship with of christ and the bride in you know the relationship of christ and the bride is a direct result or outcome of the price that he paid the price that he paid jesus christ our relationship with him is a direct result of death meaning our relationship with christ is not supposed to reflect anything else it's supposed to reflect and show that he has paid a hefty price we know all the price that he paid we know the cup that he drank you know and he said it is finished they say when it was he said if it is finished there's a greek word that says that is the tesla thai or something like that that isla if i remember well it's it means that it is painting full that's what he meant it is finished done after drinking that cup there after paying our dollar after he paid that painful price the lord not wanted nothing else god he said hey to get that bride that's the dory and he paid it painfully for me and you so what should come out of that relationship huh the greatest prize that he gave us was his life himself and and you know when you look at your husband every day if you are a woman of course you are all when you look at your husband every day you say man you are so thankful for that man that he could leave all the women of the world billions and billions of them you could have just gone on online and check the beautiful ones but he chose you when not because i mean there's so many misuniverses so but he chose you because there was something in you that spoke to him in you he placed a seat before the foundation of the world that when he went looking for you he said ah see she's the one this is the one the father said are you sure lord this is my one i'm going to die for that one glory he saw you i'm so thankful for my husband amen that he chose me and he gave gifts he gave love he gave patience he gave his sacrifice but the biggest one was love i mean was his death that he had to take it to come and be a human being you know if one day one day if a peak can just become a human being and just sit on your couch as a human being and eat the food you eat sleep in your electric blanket and have a water bottle just imagine and wake up and just press the microwave the peak yeah do you think after two weeks when they say hey mister now the time for you to become human is finished i think you need to go back to be a pig and sleep there in the stinking what do you call it sorry stop do you think it will agree right do you think the pig will agree no ways never not in a million years so no not that he he took us from a very dirty place and he came to a very dirty place he came in that pig stop and he walked like this on the mat you know a pig stinking and he walked in it and then he took his bands look for you man thinking he never put the mask he never put a mask then he found you amen thank you glory he took me jesus oh thank you after taking me then he watched me wash me clean sanctify and then fill me up the spirit of the lord amen and now mankind can take that that thing that was stinking in the picture clint people now can drink that's why people when they meet you if they know you before you were delivered they said ah is it you they don't believe that is you yeah people who will meet me now they say aha this boy he takes a chance you say he's preaching because he took me they know me when i was there but now i'm here they are just supposed to take me and drink the water of life and drink using this cup or this vessel right that's what you weigh and that's what the lord did to us romans chapter 5 verse 8-11 but god come command commanded his love toward us in that while we were sinners christ died for us so this is just reiterating what i wanted to to say much more than being now justified by by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if we were if when we were enemies in other words we were anti-christ before we were then reconciled that's why i need to come the reconciliation the reconciliation now this is where the relationship is and that's when when in accounting in finance when we say we reconcile we mean the left the debit side sister anna and the credit side they talk they're balanced they talk the same thing we mean that the bank bank reconciliation when we do a reconciliation we reconcile the books they're balanced on the left what do you do on the left you do on the right that's what we are we are now one with christ we have been reconciled which means we are now in a relationship that's why daily when we leave we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement amen in that message i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision 1949 july the 18th in other words 1949 two days ago father we brought again the lord jesus to life though all the world seems to be so modernistic and they they are going to uh they are going lord to knowledge instead of just a simple faith of god we realize that in the garden of eden when they test tasted the tree of knowledge they broke up the relationship with the tree of life that's what they did so i'm just taking my time that's what they did at the garden of eden are we together they broke the relationship when they ate but they were not supposed to they broke the relationship by eating that tree of knowledge and then they they wanted to go further and eat the tree of life in that condition and god said noise let me fix this thing right once and for all and the only way for him to fix it was to calm down himself and become a man and correct it he's our second adam and this adam is never going to fail he's not going to fail and his if he's not going to fail his if is not going to be tricked by the subtle devil when he says to us today he says to you you will not surely die you say what do you say daniel what can you say just just shut up amen you must shut him down immediately don't even give him a moment you you're bored with a great price if you know who you are you will understand that you don't hold conversations with the devil if you know who you who you what you were bored with what you are king did your husband you know that you don't hold conversations with the devil in your mind you know that you don't entertain him a girl who entertains boys on the street likelihood of her going down is very high now we don't entertain it evil thoughts anything that the devil may want to bring to your mind it is written shut it down that the pastor says we hate him and he's this in any appearance don't don't want to walk no say no no i'm still in the camp no no don't walk too close to the border don't walk too close to the border be careful don't walk too close to the border and sometimes believers walk too close to the border of the enemy and armed yeah imagine you're walking close to the border you are not armed with the spirit of the lord but you are working with a vest on the board isn't that dangerous yes that's foolish for lack of a better weight i'm sorry that's not wise at least if you were armed with two bazoogas [Laughter] you can now uh walk on the border because you know there's some that are not armed you are armed you can blow the enemy but you are not crossing that border you are in within the border of your kingdom amen you are just making sure that when they throw a scat missile you intercept it and break it hallelujah it seems that you and you assume that you we need to have the revelation of matthew 26 42 and john 19 28 that talks about the cup that he took and i listened to this someone of a brother called stephen brinson and then he was teaching about you know when when when the lord took the cup and you know i just so enjoyed that message so much the brother taught that message and i saw from genesis to revelation that the bible is a love story everything in here is about love of christ and the bride from cover to cover amen it is i just saw it it just took in my in in my eyes like this and i saw from genesis to revelation everything is about love in here but we can talk about that next time but here in matthew 26 42 and 19 john 19 28 he talks about the cup that he took they say in the eastern culture when a young man comes to mary he he fill a cup with wine and it takes and he drinks and he put and he he puts it in front of the girl but with the parents here the moment that girl takes the cup and drink also dandel she agreed he is the wife of that man and he must go back home to his home to prepare a house for her so that when he come so that where he is she can also be that's in the eastern culture he did that for us he took the cup and drank it and bitter cup and then he after that he said i'm coming and i'm coming for you have you taken your cup have you drank your cup tonight have you accepted him yes yes i did so if you we we have accepted the cup that means that we can drink no other cup for anyone we are taken our womb is sealed closed we are sealed we can't take anything else no shenanigans of the devil whether in by means of a thought by means of using my brother or my sister's weakness by means of using my own weaknesses nothing i'm above my own weaknesses did you hear that yes sir tonight you must live above your own weaknesses because they are conquered they don't control or rule you anymore your weaknesses the ones that you were born with that we know this brother is a liar you live above those your ones because they are not yours in the first place they were never yours it is just the devil who brought and attached them to you attached to your father run it in the family you know they say when you run a cable from there today run it through in the family everyone who's gonna be born in this lineage gonna be a thief they say don't be surprised his great-grandfather was a thief what no this one is a bride this one is the bride that cycle a cast is cut it's destroyed and it will never sprout any longer thank hallelujah now i want to quickly go to closing now now this relationship is so powerful brothers and sisters that when we don't get involved in this relationship it's almost like we are crucifying him for the second time it hurts him so much remember the vision that the lord showed brother branham and you know every time he does something wrong small even what he does to the lord jesus christ remember that vision yes remember how how the prophet explained that how how he looked how the lord jesus looked and what the things that i do on earth knowingly and he's still deep in on his side and he still said i pardoned because he loves you so much he can't lose when he knows you know no better the things that i do we sing a song here oh lord it's all about you father it's not about me may god help us to to know our enemy in his most hidden form you know on your computer they say there's some hidden files things that corrupt the computer and you never never find them a hacker called the devil has put them there you know but the lord brings that anti-virus yes amen you know called the holy spirit it goes through that computer called you and it flashes out everything it exposes everything and be careful he can turn around and say and blame you that's right he's not there he can turn around and say no no no no no if that that thing was a virus that came from a haircut himself now he wants to turn around just own it i'm sitting now take your bags and you are out and i want no not even i don't want everyone to hear your smell and your breath and your footsteps about you i want to hear nothing about you this is my sister this is my brother this is your thought take them and go amen i love my sister fully double unconditionally and my brother and i'm not going to go sleep about here i'm not gonna think wrong about my sister i'm gonna give my brother my sister a benefit of a doubt remember what the pastor said many many moons ago give your brother a benefit of a doubt because you are giving jesus christ in him the benefit of adult brother isaac the anniversary he said one of the principles one of the four principles of five was don't see david see christ in david amen amen if you understand and descend the body you know that the way i'm thinking now is wrong this thought doesn't cannot be mine you must be able to descend that know your spiritual body the way that i'm thinking right now in this second the second because the devil is able to bring a package of thoughts in one second he thinks he's clever you know but the lord does not even use our time to you know he's he's ever bright his holy ghost when it comes it flashes everything that the devil could have brought so just one given time our war is continuous our war is ever going in as much as we are ever green in the spirit but we understand that in this war our war is ever continuous there's no time to to lag when you are in the in the front line in the front line you know what you're exposing you're not only exposing yourself you're exposing your brother and your sister and everybody around you you are the step in the body of the lord you by allowing the devil understand the body of the lord how it functions the moment you do that and everybody do that we know who we are now there was no more need time for us to be here we go the times of ananias and sapphira will come and we say hey brother before you come in the lord jesus christ has given you what you're asking for as you are coming through the door you are thinking about this and this god gave it to you those are the days i'm waiting for that's what i want hey my brother come here to the office you know yesterday you didn't think well about this where yesterday when we were in search in such a place come let's pray together we pray together and it's gone that's the time we are waiting for that's the time we want and we mustn't chicken out we must cry for god to give us that because we are tired we want to go i want to go in closing yeah including the bible says here how many are blessed and in again in the message oh yeah that's the way brother andy thank you see he's my partner in crime [Laughter] amen we are prisoners together so there he says the prophet christ and his church is communion together that's the reason we can hear from him and see the future before it gets here that's what that's what i want i want to see the future because the lord has given us that spirit to see the future we already know the future we already know it before it gets here and can tell the future that is perfect because that we commune with a god who holds eternity in his hands communion with one another i can't say better sister vanessa i i i even say it like a south african will speak commuting with one another if i'll come from you know illinois with one another yeah until i don't hear brother ben i said sorry brother commuting with communing with one another that's what he says here it first started by saying because that we commune with god we who holds the eternity in his hands listen to the next statement he says communing with one another do you see how important that when we commune with god when we commune we because we are all one mystical body yeah you can't commune with god and can't commune with your brother you can't you cannot commune with god and not commune with you your brother in the spirit communing with one another the body of christ the mystical spiritual body of christ not associated with any kind of an idol or a bread or a wine but in the spiritual form you see first john chapter four in closing below that let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not he that liveth not knoweth not god for god is love yes right beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another i'm talking a couple here and of course filio if a man say i love god and hated his brother and i want us to pause here and add i'm not reading the bible i'm just i'm preaching if a man say i love god and despise it his brother yes if a man say i love god and think bad about his brother and not make it right if a man says i love god and undermine or demean or disregard the feelings of his brother and he says i love god do you understand the body do you descend how the body works and you just find relevant ways to put on your sister that no this is what she was meaning yes and you don't realize that this is the devil telling you this no no no no she spoke like that i'm not i'm not i'm not it's not my way she said it why don't you give her the benefit of a doubt why don't you find it in you to forgive her even before she can see that she's wrong why why do you want to perpetuate that she's full of the devil why what what spirit is that one but you say you love god but god went to the big star yeah and talk for you and you want to take your sister and write it off or your brother true lord jesus may god help us if a man say i love god and hated his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he had seen how can he love god whom he had not even seen god is love right but god made everything so everything is based on love the love of god whatever we think whatever we do whatever we desire everything and this commandment have we from him that he who live at god love his brother also let us descend the body of the lord this is now from the message designing the body of the lord let us descend the body of the lord descend the times that we are living in huh let's descend the body of the lord and descend the times that we are living in we will die spiritually if we don't do that and if it is true and the holy spirit is with us and we've got that last sign of the coming of the lord just before he is come remember that was just before so don't bend just a few hours before it bend i believe today many and i cut it i don't remember what the prophet said you can go and read it in the spoken word descending the body of the lord 1959 august the 12th or you can ask me to send you the powerpoint it's very easy so the point i'm trying to say is that time is normal it's just a few minutes before midnight before the cry can come out that ah there he is coming i want to see him first i want to see him coming and and feel something change and say and say i don't even know how far i'll throw my shoes [Laughter] because if if you grew the way i grew up you know that when your mother was coming from town with groceries where she went once a month to buy groceries you know that when that she gets off the taxi maybe a mile away and you see her the feeling my grandmother used to work in pretoria in the kitchen you know kitchen meaning he was waiting for was working for a white man in the kitchen and cleaning them for them and when she came home you know what everything stops because i know when all these months when she was in pretoria she was thinking about me i i can't wait to see to open the bags too and she will bring everything for her grandchildren you know she'll bring bread that has been dried up you know and put jam and peanut butter dried up for us for us we we weave the ash ups in the rural areas and there's peanut butter and jam but just that one was brought by granny the joy so when i think of such joys and i'm trying to multiply a million times the joy that i'm going to feel when my body change brother and sister is not worth it for this world to waste time amen how possible jesus let's pause here and sing a song and go home and think about this body and make it strong amen make your brother strong aye man take a bullet for your brother yes take a bullet for your sister it doesn't matter what the devil is trying to do it doesn't matter doesn't matter what the enemy is trying any sort of tricks say it doesn't matter devil it is written thou shall love my brother and my sister
