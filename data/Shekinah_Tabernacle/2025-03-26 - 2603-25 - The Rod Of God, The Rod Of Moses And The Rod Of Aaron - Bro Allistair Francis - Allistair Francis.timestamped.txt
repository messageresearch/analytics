[22:02] understanding and the
[22:03] Revelation that brings full redemption

[22:14] what you have done for us and that we
[22:16] are your called people that stand here
[22:19] in your presence in a time where gross
[22:22] darkness is covering the Earth and all
[22:25] the people Lord your word is more than
[22:29] salvation to us it is the breath of life
[22:32] that we breathe it is the joy of our
[22:35] Salvation it is the strength of Our
[22:37] Lives it is more than life itself to us
[22:41] father it is that which has drawn us
[22:44] from all parts of the earth as one
[22:47] family to come into your presence and
[22:51] know who we are and who we were from
[22:54] before the foundation of the world you
[22:57] have drawn us to a place that we might
[22:59] know our origin and given us purpose to
[23:03] life more than just going to work and
[23:06] paying bills and managing families you
[23:10] have given us purpose beyond all
[23:13] purposes that man has
[23:15] produced Lord we are truly grateful that
[23:19] we could be a part of this Bride of the
[23:21] Lord Jesus Christ what we serve is more
[23:24] than just religions Lord this word this
[23:27] open book that you have presented before
[23:30] us that you have put in our hands is
[23:33] more than Man's power it's more than
[23:36] power that governments can hold or
[23:39] Mighty Men of this Earth or qualified
[23:42] people of great stature and intellect we
[23:46] are just simple people called by your
[23:48] grace taken from the Sheep coat given
[23:52] the wisdom of almighty God Lord we pray
[23:55] that we may be found worthy in This Time
[23:58] Lord Lord to take this precious word and
[24:01] have it manifested in our lives father
[24:04] we pray for this
[24:05] congregation these your children the
[24:08] pastor the deacons and office holders
[24:12] and the children the youth father God
[24:16] may you instill in us the desire to be
[24:19] more than what life has presented may
[24:23] this word give us father the direction
[24:26] that we need for this time
[24:29] that we might not be found idle
[24:32] people just living the life of
[24:34] traditions but that we might have a real
[24:37] hope a real ambition a real goal we pray
[24:41] Lord that this service may be just a
[24:44] reminder a simple reminder because all
[24:47] the Mysteries are revealed we have
[24:50] nothing new to present but Lord to bring
[24:53] back the memory of what it is that we
[24:56] need to be doing father God we pray that
[24:58] you may bless the reading of the word
[25:00] bless everything that will be said and
[25:02] down we are just mortal Men We depend
[25:05] upon you in all things we pray Lord that
[25:07] your Revelation may come before us today
[25:10] and open up these precious Words of Life
[25:12] to us we appreciate the scriptures oh
[25:15] God these words of life that have been
[25:18] passed down from
[25:19] Generations we acknowledge the weight
[25:23] that is behind it we acknowledge the
[25:25] lives that it took to push it from from
[25:28] generation to generation we acknowledge
[25:31] the blood that was shed the sacrifices
[25:34] made so that these words could be
[25:36] printed for us may we never lose focus
[25:39] of these things father and walk with the
[25:42] responsibility of this word today bless
[25:45] us Lord we pray we ask it all in your
[25:47] precious name with much praise and
[25:49] thanksgiving amen and
[25:52] amen while you're standing we just want
[25:54] to read our uh scripture um before we
[25:59] take our
[26:02] seat I want to um read just this one
[26:06] verse a simple simple subject and trust
[26:10] that it'll be a blessing to you also
[26:12] recognize that it's a work week and uh I
[26:17] had many other thoughts on my heart but
[26:21] I I preached this last night in in
[26:23] Oakland and it worked out well because
[26:26] it didn't take long at all
[26:28] I'm usually a preacher that preaches for
[26:31] about two hours and our church is used
[26:33] to that but I'm in uh a different place
[26:37] and I want respect the uh the way that
[26:40] you do things here so I trust that it'll
[26:42] be a blessing to you Exodus 4:20 says
[26:46] and Moses took his wife and his sons and
[26:49] set them upon an ass and he returned to
[26:53] the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod
[26:55] of God in his hand amen the Lord Lord
[26:58] add a blessing to his word you may be
[27:02] seated praise be to
[27:04] God greetings in the name of the Lord
[27:07] Jesus Christ and good to see all of you
[27:10] it's really a special privilege for me
[27:13] to be in New Zealand and I was first in
[27:16] Australia uh for the last weekend and uh
[27:19] for me it's the first time on this
[27:21] continent part of the
[27:23] continent and uh this part of the world
[27:26] and to see this beautiful land and the
[27:29] wonderful people but more than anything
[27:31] to meet the Saints to me it's the
[27:34] greatest privilege and the greatest
[27:35] honor to meet the Saints and uh whenever
[27:39] I come uh I don't go sightseeing
[27:41] whenever I travel I just uh I've got
[27:44] work to do and I got to see the saints
[27:47] of God Fellowship as much as we can and
[27:49] just enjoy the the The Treasure of the
[27:53] family of God Amen so I appreciate
[27:55] brother Ben uh today was the first time
[27:57] we met
[27:58] and uh I appreciate his family having me
[28:01] in their home and the wonderful
[28:02] Fellowship that we had today just for a
[28:05] few minutes it was busy rockus and
[28:09] hilarious and uh but just normal and
[28:13] wonderful and that's the way Believers
[28:15] should be so we appreciate all of you
[28:18] very much so uh I'm I'm here on the
[28:21] invite to brother Al I'll be going there
[28:23] and doing his uh family camp this
[28:27] weekend so I appreciate got to say
[28:29] appreciate brother elry for the invite
[28:31] to come over and I think he arranged
[28:33] things with brother Ben and the brothers
[28:35] in ockland so I just uh trust that
[28:39] whatever we say tonight will be a
[28:40] blessing
[28:42] amen so like I I said you know uh there
[28:46] isn't anything new that we that we can
[28:50] give to you I believe that the prophet's
[28:52] message revealed everything and none of
[28:54] us are going to come here and give you
[28:56] some great Epiphany that's going to make
[28:59] you Star Struck and enter the dimension
[29:02] of Heaven just by the way we preach or
[29:06] how fantastic we can explain things so
[29:09] that's not at all what we're going to do
[29:11] and um but I believe that the human
[29:15] condition is that when you look through
[29:18] the scripture it's very easy to
[29:20] stagnate it's very easy to get stuck in
[29:23] a certain place and remain there um so
[29:28] like for example if you're traveling
[29:30] from from Wellington to some other place
[29:34] and this is kind of like what Christians
[29:36] doing unfortunately a lot of message
[29:38] Believers uh you're traveling from one
[29:41] place to another and then uh you see
[29:44] let's say you're traveling from
[29:45] Wellington to Oakland and um it's a long
[29:48] drive and then you see a signboard that
[29:51] says Oakland so many kilometers uh do
[29:54] you stand at the signboard and shout and
[29:56] celebrate that you're in
[29:58] Oakland no but that kind of is what
[30:02] people do when it comes to God you stop
[30:06] in an experience and you have a Revival
[30:08] around an experience but you haven't
[30:11] reached the
[30:12] destination and our walk with God is a
[30:16] walk it's not a stop and sit
[30:19] down it's a walk it's a journey and so
[30:24] really all that we're doing as the
[30:26] ministry is to encourage you to keep
[30:28] walking do not stagnate do not stop at a
[30:31] certain place another part of the human
[30:34] condition is forgetting where we came
[30:36] from and if you forget where you came
[30:39] from you forget the purpose of why
[30:40] you're
[30:41] walking and where you're going to so
[30:45] that's why I want to speak on this
[30:47] subject today which is the rod of God
[30:51] the rod of Moses and the rod of Aaron so
[30:55] it's just a simple Old Testament type
[30:57] for those you are familiar with a quote
[30:59] from the uh Christ is the mystery of God
[31:01] revealed the prophet said when he speaks
[31:03] about the coming of the Lord the
[31:05] Thunders the the half hour silence he
[31:08] said the mystery is hidden in the types
[31:11] and
[31:12] shadows you can go through every type
[31:14] and Shadow and you're going to see The
[31:16] Mystery of the second coming of the Lord
[31:19] you're also going to see the mystery of
[31:20] Christ in there like the prophet says in
[31:22] the same message if you read the message
[31:24] or you read the Bible and you don't see
[31:26] Christ go back and read it again
[31:29] but also if you read the Bible and you
[31:31] don't see yourself in there go back and
[31:33] read it again because you are in Christ
[31:36] you have to see yourself in there amen
[31:39] so I want to begin with oh so that's
[31:42] what this message today is going to be
[31:43] about it's taking a type and making you
[31:46] understand who you are why you were
[31:49] called and just giving us a bit of
[31:52] direction as to not stopping and
[31:55] stagnating around something or
[31:58] movement uh let's be frank we're tired
[32:02] of tradition in the message we're T
[32:05] tired of churchianity we're tired of
[32:07] religion we're tired of pettiness we're
[32:11] tired of uh
[32:13] infightings um those things should end
[32:15] when we grow up and become
[32:17] adults and uh I'm one of those who are
[32:20] outspoken about this because I've grown
[32:22] up in the message I've seen all the
[32:24] nonsense that went on I've seen all the
[32:27] greatness that came came out of it but I
[32:29] think we're tired of just the immaturity
[32:32] we need to to come to this place where
[32:34] we see sons of God uh come to full
[32:37] manifestation uh where people are not
[32:39] making excuses for life and for problems
[32:43] in the world we are the ones chosen to
[32:45] be the Overcomers amen and that's I I
[32:48] believe we need real strong men and
[32:50] women to stand up in this time and
[32:53] manifest that life
[32:56] so uh we want to first begin with the um
[33:01] definition all right so a rod does
[33:05] anybody here use
[33:07] rods no nobody uses rods unless you use
[33:12] it for building
[33:14] brother nobody walks around with a stick
[33:17] maybe if you're from Africa we we have a
[33:19] knob Kiri or something you know or
[33:22] something like that but the rod that was
[33:24] used in Moses day is obsolete
[33:28] really doesn't exist anymore nobody
[33:30] walks around with a rod anymore which
[33:32] means what I'm saying is it's actually
[33:35] meaningless to you you really don't
[33:37] understand what it is and why it was
[33:39] even necessary right it's not something
[33:42] that you can uh associate with today
[33:47] amen so rod in the Bible has many
[33:51] different
[33:53] definitions the first definition we can
[33:55] look at is judgment chastisement and
[33:59] Punishment so if we go to the scripture
[34:02] let's go to 1 Corinthians
[34:04] 4:21 what will ye shall I come unto you
[34:08] with a rod or in love and in the spirit
[34:12] of meekness so there the scriptures
[34:14] basically telling you would you like me
[34:17] to come to you in harsh punishment or
[34:20] chastisement or in love in the spirit of
[34:23] meekness so do you see the definition in
[34:25] the Bible is that a rod means punishment
[34:28] chastisement in other words it's not a
[34:30] nice thing right uh it's not something
[34:34] to be cherished it's not something to
[34:36] look forward like God is actually
[34:37] telling you oh this is Paul saying do
[34:40] you like me correcting you with
[34:42] harshness or you rather prefer me
[34:45] speaking to you with meekness and
[34:47] kindness Ezekiel 20:37 says I will cause
[34:51] you this is the Lord speaking to pass
[34:53] under the rod and I will bring you into
[34:55] the bond of the Covenant that means uh I
[34:59] like you to be keeping my law I like you
[35:01] to be keeping the
[35:02] Covenant but if you're not going to do
[35:05] it then I'm going to have to judge you
[35:06] and chastise you to make you do it right
[35:10] if you look at the next one which is
[35:13] correction we can so I'm going to get
[35:15] through this part of the theory quickly
[35:17] and then we get to the message right uh
[35:19] Proverbs
[35:21] 22:15 foolishness is bound in the heart
[35:24] of a child okay this is going to be a
[35:27] little sensitive for New Zealand South
[35:30] Africa is still catching up so forgive
[35:32] us but but this is why we're good people
[35:35] we we came under this foolishness is
[35:39] bound in the heart of a child but the
[35:40] rod of Correction shall drive it far
[35:43] from him if a child is being foolish the
[35:46] rod of Correction will drive foolishness
[35:49] away from him has your Bible children
[35:52] take notes Proverbs 23:13 says withhold
[35:57] not correction from the child for if
[36:00] thou beatest him with the rod he shall
[36:02] not
[36:05] die few more amens might
[36:08] help he won't die if you beat him with
[36:11] the
[36:12] rod what you're going to teach him
[36:14] wisdom that's not the subject of what
[36:16] I'm talking about the next one Proverbs
[36:19] 29:15 the rod and reproof gives wisdom
[36:23] you know U there was a brother from
[36:25] South Africa who said you can talk to
[36:28] children as much as you want to you can
[36:31] tell them you can shout at them you can
[36:33] try to get the truth out of them but God
[36:35] made a special place from here to the
[36:39] brain as soon as they get that smack
[36:42] over there it's like the truth comes out
[36:44] yes I did it no they understand the rod
[36:48] and that's wisdom tell the truth right
[36:51] so it's like Paul is saying don't let me
[36:53] treat you with uh with harshness why not
[36:57] just just seek to do the right thing
[36:59] right but you can see from all these
[37:01] scriptures we're looking at bible
[37:03] definitions of Rod so far it's not
[37:07] great it's not a it's not a nice thing
[37:09] it's not something we feel good about
[37:11] right uh look at what job says job is
[37:14] crying out to God let him take his Rod
[37:17] away from me and let not his fear
[37:20] terrify me this is even more uh
[37:23] expressive like this Rod is is really
[37:27] something harsh job doesn't want job is
[37:29] pleading he and if you look at what it
[37:31] means you know the story of job he's
[37:33] just going under so much of judgment
[37:35] he's telling you that that Judgment of
[37:38] God is a
[37:40] rod is that right take your Rod away
[37:44] from me not that there was a physical
[37:46] stick beating him but the trials of his
[37:49] life is symbolized by Rod and job 219
[37:54] their houses are safe from Fear need
[37:57] neither is the rod of God upon them so
[38:01] this is important because here we have
[38:03] job literally using the phrase Rod of
[38:06] God so wherever you see the word or
[38:10] phrase Rod of God in the Bible it speaks
[38:13] of judgment chastisement punishment so
[38:17] what is our subject the rod of God the
[38:19] rod of Moses the rod of Aaron we are
[38:22] going to define those three terms
[38:24] because they are very important to
[38:25] something we need to catch
[38:28] another meaning of Rod which is not all
[38:31] that relevant right now but it is a
[38:33] branch of a family or a tribe for
[38:36] example Isaiah 11:1 and there shall come
[38:39] forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse
[38:42] this is very simple a rod meaning a
[38:44] branch that is coming out of a tree it's
[38:46] a sign of a family
[38:48] lineage right and a branch shall grow
[38:51] out of his roots we know this is a
[38:52] prophecy of Christ so it also means a a
[38:57] line of a family or a a branch of a
[39:00] family are you with us a few things we
[39:03] don't have to go and look in the
[39:04] scripture about uh the rod was actually
[39:08] one of two of a shepherd's uh the
[39:11] shepherd's
[39:12] tools so the shepherd would walk with a
[39:16] rod and a staff you know that in Psalm
[39:18] 23 right the rod and the staff they
[39:21] comfort me we just went through the rod
[39:24] being something bad how can it be
[39:26] Comfort because the word comfort in the
[39:28] Bible is not really what we see as
[39:31] comfort today comfort in the Bible is
[39:34] the advocate the
[39:37] lawyer the comforter is the advocate
[39:40] brother Ram says in in the uh the the
[39:43] series on the Holy Ghost what is the
[39:45] Holy Ghost he's a Mark he's a comforter
[39:49] what is a comforter an advocate who
[39:51] fights on your behalf so what is the rod
[39:54] then is one who's going to fight on the
[39:56] behalf of the Sheep
[39:58] so the
[39:59] staff is a long pole that goes up and
[40:02] it's got a hook at the end uh you know
[40:05] sheep are well you have a lot of sheep
[40:07] here in New Zealand they're the dumbest
[40:10] creatures around always getting in
[40:12] trouble always needed dogs to hound them
[40:15] bring them back in they get lost so
[40:17] quickly they Panic so fast they've got
[40:20] anxiety like off the chart and they get
[40:22] stuck in pieces of rock and he needs his
[40:24] long stick with a hook to pull them out
[40:26] by their horns I mean they can even see
[40:28] him they can think I can make a way for
[40:31] myself no the anxiety is too much got to
[40:34] hook them out and pull them in and then
[40:36] there's long staff it's like when the
[40:38] shepherd is walking over the hills and
[40:40] the shepherd walks and you know there
[40:41] whole 200 sheep there and then the
[40:43] shepherd disappears over the
[40:47] hill instead of saying well let's walk
[40:49] straight cuz that's where he last was
[40:51] they have instant memory loss so he has
[40:54] to have his long stick there so he
[40:56] doesn't disappear from their sight they
[40:58] see the stick moving and then they come
[41:00] over the hill as fast as possible that's
[41:02] what the staff is for but the rod of the
[41:06] shepherd is also to prod and poke and
[41:09] keep the sheep in line amen so then the
[41:13] the last one we find in the Bible is the
[41:16] rod was also used by uh Wizards and
[41:20] witches and of the old times it was a
[41:24] rod of
[41:25] divination you know like they would use
[41:28] the viers of pharaoh we'll speak a
[41:30] little bit about that or the the
[41:32] different lands they would have their
[41:34] their wizards of every place and their
[41:36] wise men they would carry these very
[41:38] fancy staff with like a jewel at the end
[41:40] and they would use it to to tell people
[41:43] they're casting spells on them so in
[41:46] case you didn't know because of Moses
[41:48] and because of what had happened um in
[41:51] the holy land they had Rod Cults they
[41:55] had Arc cults because the children of
[41:58] Israel had an ark people needed an ark
[42:01] it created Arc Cults can you imagine
[42:03] after all that great signs and wonders
[42:06] that happened with Moses how many people
[42:08] were walking around now and became
[42:09] wizards they must have worshiped it
[42:12] right so this Rod became a
[42:17] legend an idol almost amen so we're
[42:21] going to show you so first we're going
[42:23] to go to and and open up what does Rod
[42:26] of God means we already have a certain
[42:27] part it means judgment it means
[42:30] punishment it means chastisement you all
[42:32] with me now we're going to prove
[42:35] that so we come back to our scripture
[42:38] and I want to start with something very
[42:41] important so Moses took his wife and his
[42:44] sons and set them upon an ass and he
[42:45] returned to the land of Egypt are we all
[42:47] together
[42:48] amen and I want you to notice that the
[42:52] Bible does not write things for nothing
[42:55] it says and Moses took the rod of God in
[42:59] his hand now hold on a minute the rod of
[43:04] God when did this become the rod of
[43:07] God now this stick Moses most likely
[43:12] picked up the stick in the
[43:15] wilderness when he was escaping Egypt
[43:18] before God spoke to him right so he must
[43:21] have been walking through the desert got
[43:24] really tired his legs must have been
[43:26] failing beneath him I found the stick
[43:28] and start limping over before he came to
[43:30] Jethro's place is that right how how is
[43:34] it then a a rod of
[43:36] God it was a dead stick from the
[43:39] Wilderness he was there you know there's
[43:42] actually a quote where brother mam says
[43:44] God found Moses walking around the
[43:47] mountain at ease he was having a soft
[43:51] life when God found him walking around
[43:54] with the same stick which had no power
[43:57] over him right so he could have picked
[44:00] it up when he fled Egypt wandered
[44:02] through the Wilderness and then we see
[44:04] something that happens when he meets the
[44:06] burning
[44:07] bush let's go to that
[44:11] okay and Moses answered so this is the
[44:14] Lord he sees let me turn aside and see
[44:17] this great sight when he saw the burning
[44:19] bush are you with us and Moses answered
[44:21] and said but behold they will not
[44:23] believe me nor hearken unto my voice for
[44:25] they will say the Lord had not appeared
[44:27] unto thee and the Lord said unto him
[44:29] what is that in thine hand that proves
[44:33] to us that it was in his hand before the
[44:36] Lord called him right so he came up to
[44:39] the mountain so in case you said well
[44:41] this Rod had like magic powers he broke
[44:44] it off the burning bush or maybe he
[44:46] found it there in the presence of no he
[44:48] came up with the
[44:50] rod so he's saying uh if I go to I want
[44:55] you to get the picture listen I love the
[44:58] scriptures it's it's it's the the most
[45:00] amazing thing to me on the planet is the
[45:03] Bible and I when I read it I read every
[45:08] single phrase as if it means something
[45:10] more than what it says so don't miss
[45:13] this what is the context Moses is
[45:17] complaining that people are not going to
[45:19] listen to
[45:20] him and then God offers a solution like
[45:24] uh if he says but they're not going to
[45:26] listen to me they're not going to obey
[45:28] me they know who I am they knew I
[45:30] murdered that Egyptian you heard what
[45:33] they said to me the last time you just
[45:35] make yourself a prince over us what what
[45:37] makes you think they're going to listen
[45:38] to me he's making all the excuses that
[45:40] every normal human will make what is God
[45:42] solution God's solution should have said
[45:44] you know don't worry I'll just zap their
[45:46] minds or something and make them wake up
[45:48] and believe you were no he said what is
[45:50] in th
[45:52] hand God's solution to the people not
[45:55] believing him was a rod in Moses hand
[45:59] right and he said a
[46:01] rod praise be to God so he already had
[46:05] this with him which means from Exodus
[46:08] 4:20 that after the burning bush that
[46:12] Dead stick became the rod of God Amen
[46:17] right after the burning bush experience
[46:20] that Dead stick becomes the rod of God
[46:24] Amen let's look at a quote here from
[46:27] take the rod and gather the people love
[46:29] brother bram's
[46:31] titles you know how much you can make
[46:33] from that take the rod and gather the
[46:35] people and the rod that Moses had in his
[46:38] hand it was not the rod of Moses it was
[46:42] the rod of God God's judgment Rod Moses
[46:46] held it out over Egypt and flies came up
[46:49] he held it out and fleas came up
[46:51] wherever he dumped this Rod it was a
[46:53] judgment Rod he brought judgment Upon A
[46:56] disobedient people are you with us so
[47:00] Moses you get it this is the prophet
[47:02] saying it was not the rod of Moses it
[47:05] was the rod of God but what is important
[47:07] is he's pointing out that wherever Moses
[47:09] used that rod in that part of the
[47:12] journey going to Egypt there was just
[47:15] judgment wherever he used it it was just
[47:18] judgment chastisement are you with us so
[47:21] he Journeys to Egypt with this rod in
[47:23] his hand and he Wills the power of God
[47:26] in the 10 plagues and the rod became a
[47:29] legend an icon probably would have been
[47:32] much more of an idol now we're going to
[47:34] see because when the children of Israel
[47:37] watched Moses moving through they
[47:40] actually looked at this rod and began to
[47:43] respect its power and like most humans
[47:47] they turn it into an idol I mean we they
[47:50] should have realized the power is God's
[47:53] God's power not the rod right so what
[47:58] but what do they see think about it if
[48:00] you saw that you saw this man walk and
[48:04] put this rod in the water and starts
[48:05] turning to blood what would you
[48:07] immediately think right and then he
[48:10] raises it to the sky and then frogs come
[48:13] out and lice and flies and merrain and
[48:16] then boils and blaines and then fire and
[48:19] hail and Thunder From Heaven and then
[48:22] Locust that eat up everything 3 days of
[48:24] darkness and then finally the death of
[48:26] the was born of
[48:28] Egypt I mean any normal person would
[48:31] today would think that's some great
[48:33] magic right there yeah and they would
[48:36] have looked at that rod and some people
[48:38] can you imagine some people would have
[48:39] think if we could just get that Rod away
[48:40] from
[48:43] him yeah you know that's exactly how
[48:46] people think so after that display of of
[48:50] plagues the rod became a symbol of
[48:53] judgment amen you love him Saints now
[48:57] watch what happens this is exactly what
[48:58] I'm talking about because this this
[49:00] shows the condition of people including
[49:02] message people which we will bring in in
[49:04] a little while here was the war with the
[49:06] amalekites now you know these amalekites
[49:08] were like the most ferocious Warriors at
[49:11] that time and um there was this war that
[49:15] broke out the the amalekites came and
[49:17] took some people captive and the
[49:19] Israelis went back and and had to go and
[49:22] um uh uh recover and and fight against
[49:25] them and of course while fighting was
[49:27] going
[49:28] on uh Moses said he to them I'll stand
[49:32] at the top right so Moses s to Joshua
[49:34] choos us out men and go fight with
[49:35] amalec tomorrow I will stand on the top
[49:37] of the hill with the rod of God in my
[49:40] hand notice the rod of God he doesn't
[49:43] say my rod the rod of God so whenever
[49:47] anyone talks about this they always
[49:51] speak of Aaron and her holding up moses'
[49:54] hands as if it was Moses Mo hands that
[49:57] had the power in them but Moses had
[50:01] specifically pointed out the rod of God
[50:03] in other words they were holding up
[50:05] Moses hand but it was the rod question I
[50:08] would ask is what if the rod was not
[50:11] there would the people have had
[50:14] Faith so somehow during the Wilderness
[50:17] they kind of built up a kind of faith in
[50:19] that Rod God had given them that Rod as
[50:23] a symbol to understand that his power
[50:25] was with Moses but just like all humans
[50:28] they look at the
[50:31] rod the people believed in that Rod so
[50:35] they knew the battle would be lost
[50:37] unless her and Aaron now I mean what if
[50:40] Aaron said you know what you take a
[50:43] break I'll hold a
[50:45] rod those men wouldn't dare we'll hold
[50:49] moses' hands up he's got the authority
[50:51] to hold that Rod right so he had two men
[50:54] holding up the prophet's hands
[50:57] all right so do you see that so far all
[51:01] the examples we see of this Rod of God
[51:04] has to do with judgment you agree so we
[51:07] can conclude that the rod of God is
[51:10] symbolizing the Judgment of God so for
[51:13] example we we use it today you know like
[51:15] when we talk about the vials or the
[51:17] trumpets or judgments upon the world we
[51:19] can easily say you know that's the rod
[51:21] of God hitting that right and and by
[51:24] that we mean judgment so let's go to the
[51:27] rod of Moses and we'll begin with Exodus
[51:33] 14:16 are you still with us
[51:36] amen but lift thou up thy rod now notice
[51:40] this is Exodus 14 this is long past the
[51:43] burning bush there's some places where
[51:46] God when he speaks about the rod he
[51:47] calls it the rod of God in this case
[51:49] he's identifying it as Moses Rod lift
[51:53] thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand
[51:57] over the sea and divide it and the
[51:59] children of Israel shall go on dry
[52:01] ground through the midst of the sea you
[52:03] might think oh brother alist making too
[52:05] much of this no I'm not I'm going to
[52:07] show you a whole lot more at this point
[52:10] he's opening up the sea to the children
[52:12] of Israel there's no judgment so it's
[52:16] not called the rod of God whenever it
[52:18] had to do with judgment it was called
[52:20] the rod of God whenever it had to do
[52:23] with something else it's called the rod
[52:24] of Moses
[52:27] or thy rod Moses right so here Moses is
[52:32] opening up the Red Sea why because there
[52:34] are Egyptians behind them chasing them
[52:37] and he's opening up the Red Sea so what
[52:39] is this
[52:40] salvation the rod of Moses is salvation
[52:44] when you break that down further who is
[52:47] Moses why is Christ called a prophet
[52:51] like unto Moses Moses types the son of
[52:54] man Ministry what is the son of man
[52:57] Ministry it is salvation to mankind amen
[53:02] so that's what when you look at the rod
[53:04] of Moses you're speaking about salvation
[53:07] now when you look at that Exodus 14 he
[53:11] opens the Red Seas and opening the Red
[53:14] Sea can be seen as the part of the
[53:16] journey that has to do with the church
[53:19] ages why because Exodus 15 they come out
[53:23] and sing the horse and his rider
[53:27] hath he casted into the sea the Lord had
[53:30] Tri triumphed gloriously his right hand
[53:33] is all powerful the horse and his rider
[53:36] had they cast into the sea that means
[53:38] something to the church because there
[53:40] were horse riders four horse riders that
[53:43] were going to keep the church sealed up
[53:45] and it had to take a son of man Ministry
[53:47] to destroy those horse riders and this
[53:50] is exactly in the types and shadows if
[53:52] you read the whole song through Exodus
[53:54] 15 it means so much to us as Believers
[53:58] as the church because this is destroying
[54:00] the horse and his rider praise be to God
[54:03] Amen and that is the four horses of
[54:05] Revelation 6 all right all we're showing
[54:07] you is
[54:08] salvation right it is the ministry of
[54:11] Christ by the Holy Ghost bringing
[54:14] salvation to the church don't you love
[54:16] him Saints all right let's move to the
[54:19] next
[54:20] one which is where he tells Moses to
[54:24] speak to the Rock numbers 20: 7 to1 and
[54:29] the Lord spake unto Moses saying take
[54:31] the rod and gather thou the assembly
[54:34] together thou and Aaron thy brother and
[54:36] speak you unto the rock so what is God's
[54:39] commandment you know this very well God
[54:41] told him speak speak to the
[54:44] Rock God didn't say go smack the rod the
[54:48] rock with a
[54:49] rod he knew it from the last time that
[54:53] this could be done but God was one him
[54:56] to move past that see don't stagnate on
[55:00] that move further speak to the rock
[55:05] those of you who read the message you
[55:07] can apply this to the prophet's three
[55:09] polls where he told him I told you not
[55:12] to do that with the second pull it's
[55:14] time to move into the third which is
[55:16] speaking the word but you feeling sorry
[55:19] for the people and you're extending the
[55:21] second
[55:22] pull and it shall give forth so speak to
[55:26] the Rock Before Their Eyes God wanted it
[55:29] to be a spectacle to show why I believe
[55:33] God is actually wanting Moses to move
[55:35] past cuz the people are already
[55:37] idolizing this
[55:38] Rod they need to recognize the
[55:40] difference in the ministry and instead
[55:43] he's still using the rod because he
[55:45] knows how much the people respect this
[55:48] rod and so Moses uh it shall give forth
[55:53] his water wonderful the RO is a he Thou
[55:58] shalt bring forth to them water out of
[56:00] the rock so Thou shalt give the
[56:02] congregation and their Beast to drink
[56:04] are you still with me and Moses took the
[56:06] rod from before the Lord as he commanded
[56:09] and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[56:10] congregation together before the Rock
[56:13] and he said unto them hear now ye
[56:16] Rebels why Rebels he's speaking to the
[56:20] Believers which means already they were
[56:23] along the journey and stagnating
[56:27] forgetting staying they wanted more
[56:30] miracles right this should have been the
[56:32] time where you speaking the word you're
[56:34] believing you're
[56:36] maturing you're Rebels must we fetch you
[56:39] water out of this rock it's almost like
[56:41] like I tell you see reading the
[56:44] scriptures by now those people should
[56:46] have went up to the Rock and spoke to it
[56:51] themselves after having seen what
[56:53] they've seen this is where we should be
[56:55] in the message
[56:57] right instead we become
[57:01] branhamites go up this is what look at
[57:03] the question must we who the prophet in
[57:06] the ministry must we fetch you water out
[57:09] this rock and Moses lifts up his hand
[57:12] and with his Rod smites The Rock twice
[57:17] and the water came out abundantly and
[57:18] the congregation drank and their beasts
[57:20] also all right hold on God told Moses
[57:23] speak to the Rock Moses of his own will
[57:26] took his Rod the rod of Moses and
[57:29] Strikes The Rock twice right the prophet
[57:32] said that was a type of the
[57:35] crucifixion now this is where it gets
[57:37] really interesting right because he all
[57:41] always said it was mysterious because
[57:44] Jesus was only smitten
[57:48] once then the mystery became apparent to
[57:50] brother
[57:51] Bram that he was going to be smitten
[57:54] again in his own time
[57:56] time you know this is what he says this
[57:59] is what surprises many
[58:03] people now notice this is the works that
[58:06] I do bear witness of me Moses smoke the
[58:10] rock the second time representing that
[58:14] Christ should come to Earth and die
[58:21] again when die again Christ should come
[58:25] to Earth and die
[58:28] again son of man
[58:30] Ministry see how many people would say
[58:33] he needs to come back he's going to come
[58:35] back in that Corporal body if they take
[58:37] this quote that's not what's going to
[58:39] happen Christ is not coming back to
[58:41] Earth in a Corporal body to die again it
[58:44] became apparent to the prophet that they
[58:46] were going to reject his message and he
[58:49] knew the son of man Ministry in his
[58:51] ministry was Christ and it has to be
[58:55] thoroughly cruci ified and
[58:57] rejected which if you haven't been awake
[58:59] has been happening now they're
[59:02] crucifying the cloud the messenger the
[59:06] prophecies everything that he said it's
[59:09] being cut to
[59:11] Pieces how about this he'll tell you
[59:14] exactly where I don't know if you can
[59:15] read that he says think of it the
[59:18] hardest pierces comes from the
[59:21] pulpit that's where his new Calvary is
[59:25] at they crucify him the word at the
[59:29] pulpit that's right how how they do it
[59:32] by their forms of godliness that's
[59:35] exactly Crown from The Audience by
[59:38] scoffers he's got a new Crown of Thorns
[59:42] scoffers pierced from the pulpit crowned
[59:45] by the scoffers is he crucified again
[59:48] aresh striped by man-made Creeds
[59:52] teachers of denomination against his
[59:54] word they stripe it in shame condemn it
[59:59] that means what Moses
[1:00:01] did was correct it was going to happen
[1:00:05] Christ was going to be crucified
[1:00:09] twice just didn't recognize do you
[1:00:12] understand what has happened today in
[1:00:13] the
[1:00:14] message why there is Judgment coming
[1:00:17] upon the people they have rejected him
[1:00:22] again he was what he is the one that
[1:00:26] Gentile church was looking
[1:00:28] for this revealed word this book is what
[1:00:32] the church was supposed to be
[1:00:35] expecting of course we know the
[1:00:37] scripture in Hebrews 9:28 so Christ was
[1:00:40] once offered to Bear the sins of many
[1:00:43] and unto them that look for him shall he
[1:00:46] appear the second time without sin unto
[1:00:49] salvation without sin what he was not
[1:00:52] going the second time he would come
[1:00:55] would not be born Bor of a virgin would
[1:00:57] not be born of a woman amen so he's he's
[1:01:01] going to be coming the second time to
[1:01:03] complete salvation not being born of a
[1:01:06] woman not bearing the sins of many this
[1:01:10] time it's going to be in our day the son
[1:01:14] of man Ministry properly and thoroughly
[1:01:17] rejected and crucified and the ones who
[1:01:20] would do it would be actually those from
[1:01:22] behind the pulpit imagine the crown of
[1:01:24] thorns today is caused by by
[1:01:27] scoffing God help us this scripture
[1:01:30] tells us that there are two comings two
[1:01:34] crucifixions the first one was to bear
[1:01:36] sin the second is without sin unto
[1:01:40] salvation that means after the second
[1:01:42] time salvation is a complete
[1:01:45] work did you notice something the water
[1:01:49] only flowed after the
[1:01:52] second strike
[1:01:56] before that it was in part throughout
[1:01:59] the the church ages they had the holy
[1:02:01] spirit in part the Holy Ghost in part
[1:02:04] the word in part but after the second
[1:02:08] crucifixion that's when the water flows
[1:02:11] by the ministry of Moses a son of man
[1:02:14] Ministry this is why there is living
[1:02:16] water in the bride this is why the bride
[1:02:19] can never become a denomination because
[1:02:22] this is where salvation is completed
[1:02:24] after the second cruci conviction which
[1:02:26] is when the water flows praise be to God
[1:02:30] the types don't lie praise be to God do
[1:02:34] you see salvation by the rod of Moses
[1:02:38] amen so let's go to the rod of Aaron
[1:02:41] this is where it gets even more
[1:02:43] interesting are you interested glory to
[1:02:47] God Exodus 79 to8 and the Lord spake
[1:02:51] unto Moses and Aaron saying when Pharaoh
[1:02:54] shall speak unto you you saying show a
[1:02:57] miracle for you then shalt thou say unto
[1:03:02] Aaron take thy
[1:03:05] rod and cast it before pharaoh and it
[1:03:08] shall become a serpent do you know how
[1:03:11] often when we talk about this we
[1:03:13] say Moses threw down his rod and his
[1:03:17] Moses rod turned into a serpent but the
[1:03:20] Bible said it was Aaron's
[1:03:23] Rod say unto Aaron take thy rod
[1:03:26] but here's something interesting it
[1:03:29] doesn't say Moses went with a rod and
[1:03:32] Aaron went with another
[1:03:33] Rod it's the same
[1:03:38] Rod I'll prove that to you it's exactly
[1:03:42] the same Rod there's no Moses rod and
[1:03:44] Aaron so these two men were standing
[1:03:46] there one with his rod and the other one
[1:03:48] with with the other Rod how do you know
[1:03:51] right did you notice how we always refer
[1:03:54] to it as Moses Moses rod and yet it the
[1:03:57] Bible specifically says say unto Aaron
[1:04:00] take thy rod because the rod the same
[1:04:03] rod in the hand of Aaron is a different
[1:04:08] manifestation Exodus
[1:04:12] 7:12 what is it in the hand of Aaron
[1:04:15] exposing the
[1:04:17] fakers we're coming to
[1:04:20] something uh verse 12 for they cast down
[1:04:24] every man his his rod that's Janice and
[1:04:28] jambus and they became
[1:04:30] serpents Now open up your eyes
[1:04:33] again but Aaron's Rod swallowed up their
[1:04:40] rods don't miss it it doesn't say
[1:04:43] Aaron's snake swallowed up their
[1:04:47] snakes it says Aaron's Rod swallowed
[1:04:50] this is very important Saints why it
[1:04:54] identifies aon's Rod Aaron's Rod has got
[1:04:58] something to do with when there's a
[1:05:00] contest of
[1:05:02] rods that's the only time it's called
[1:05:04] the rod of Aaron when there's a contest
[1:05:06] of rods when it's got to do with
[1:05:09] judgment it's the rod of God when it's
[1:05:11] got to do with saving Israel it's the
[1:05:13] rod of Moses but when there's a contest
[1:05:15] of rods it's called Aaron's
[1:05:19] Rod I mean if there was something else
[1:05:21] to when they went to the the River Nile
[1:05:26] and they there was no contest of rods
[1:05:28] when there was time for lice and frogs
[1:05:31] and all that there was no contest of
[1:05:32] rods but now there's a contest of rods
[1:05:35] what is those contest of rods
[1:05:38] Ministry what is the rod of Aaron about
[1:05:41] about showing which is the right
[1:05:44] Ministry amen so that Rod of God Rod of
[1:05:47] Moses was never a contest about
[1:05:50] Ministries it was never a contest of rod
[1:05:53] in this contest with Egypt eypt which
[1:05:56] types the world or denominational
[1:05:58] systems what What's Happening Here Egypt
[1:06:01] types the denominational systems what
[1:06:03] are what is we proving the the ministry
[1:06:06] the dominance of Moses Ministry of the
[1:06:08] ministry of God in Moses and Aaron the
[1:06:11] dominance over the ntional ministry
[1:06:14] that's what's happening his ministry
[1:06:16] swallowed up their
[1:06:18] Ministries in fact the prophet says it
[1:06:21] in in some some one of the messages he
[1:06:24] speaks about Moses what he says it
[1:06:26] swallows it up it swallows their rods up
[1:06:28] into
[1:06:29] itself he's just different terminology
[1:06:32] are you with us so it shows that Aaron's
[1:06:35] Rod swallowed up the others into itself
[1:06:40] that means their Ministries were
[1:06:42] overshadowed they had it no more it was
[1:06:44] done with amen this shows the dominance
[1:06:48] and what it does is it exposes the
[1:06:51] fakers they were fake Ministries those
[1:06:54] are magicians
[1:06:56] of of pharaoh were they were using
[1:06:58] slight of hand they were fakers they
[1:07:01] were not the genuine article what was it
[1:07:04] proving there
[1:07:06] are bogus dollars and then there's a
[1:07:09] real dollar it was showing which was the
[1:07:12] real dollar right and which was the
[1:07:15] bogus so the rod of Aaron seems to be
[1:07:18] about manifesting who is the real
[1:07:21] genuine
[1:07:23] article praise be to God
[1:07:26] now it doesn't stop with Egypt and
[1:07:29] Egypt's Ministry and denominations then
[1:07:31] we move on into the message halfway
[1:07:33] through the Wilderness there's another
[1:07:35] contest of
[1:07:37] rods number
[1:07:39] 17 these people were murmuring so much
[1:07:42] they're like yes Moses but you know we
[1:07:45] dream dreams too we prophesy we have
[1:07:48] visions we have uh gifts uh we should
[1:07:52] have a little bit more you know power
[1:07:55] and Authority and murmuring against
[1:07:58] Moses and Aaron the Lord said enough is
[1:08:00] enough the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:08:03] Speak unto the children of Israel and
[1:08:06] take off every one of them a rod
[1:08:09] according to the house of their fathers
[1:08:11] of all their princes according to the
[1:08:13] house of their fathers 12 rods so
[1:08:16] where's the contest of the ministry
[1:08:18] Happening Now among the Believers
[1:08:21] because they're thinking they can
[1:08:22] correct the prophet they they're feeling
[1:08:25] relevant
[1:08:26] right and now every man's name upon his
[1:08:30] rarden what is a name an identification
[1:08:33] it's an identification of your
[1:08:35] ministry and thou shalt write Aaron's
[1:08:38] name upon the rod of
[1:08:40] Levi for one rod shall be for the head
[1:08:44] of the House of their fathers and thou
[1:08:46] shalt lay them up in the Tabernacle of
[1:08:49] the congregation before the testimony
[1:08:51] where I will meet with you and it shall
[1:08:55] come to pass that the man's Rod whom I
[1:08:58] shall choose shall Blossom and I will
[1:09:02] make to cease from me what's this going
[1:09:04] to do stop the
[1:09:06] murmurings this whole idea of the
[1:09:09] contest of rods is to stop the murmuring
[1:09:12] right and I will um where am
[1:09:15] I uh and I shall come to pass that the
[1:09:17] man's Ro whom I shall choose shall
[1:09:18] Blossom and I will make to cease from me
[1:09:21] the murmurings of the children of Israel
[1:09:22] where my where by they murmur against
[1:09:25] you and Moses spake unto the children of
[1:09:27] Israel and every one of their princes
[1:09:30] gave him a rod a piece for each Prince W
[1:09:34] according to their father's houses even
[1:09:36] 12 rods and the rod of Aaron was among
[1:09:39] their rods and Moses laid up the rods
[1:09:43] before the Lord so who takes it the
[1:09:44] prophet takes the rods in behind the
[1:09:47] veil right and it came to pass that on
[1:09:50] the tomorrow this is uh verse 8 to 10
[1:09:55] went into the Tabernacle of witness and
[1:09:57] behold the rod of
[1:10:01] Aaron not the rod of God not the rod of
[1:10:04] Moses the rod of Aaron for the house of
[1:10:07] Levi was budded this this Rod didn't
[1:10:10] just Bud it budded and brought forth
[1:10:13] Buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded
[1:10:17] armonds so it budded it produced
[1:10:20] branches It produced leaves It produced
[1:10:23] flowers and fruit
[1:10:26] in the presence of the Lord praise be to
[1:10:28] God and Moses brought out all the rods
[1:10:30] before the Lord so here comes all the
[1:10:33] Ministries and one has
[1:10:36] blossomed and they looked and took every
[1:10:39] man his rod and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:10:42] bring Aaron's Rod again before the
[1:10:44] testimony now watch this bring Aaron's
[1:10:46] Rod again before the testimony to be
[1:10:48] kept for a token against the rebels Thou
[1:10:52] shalt quite take away their murmurings
[1:10:54] from me
[1:10:55] that they die not this was done to
[1:10:58] protect them do not challenge the real
[1:11:03] true Ministry of the open book again
[1:11:06] this is going to prove to you why is
[1:11:08] this important Saints because here we
[1:11:10] see a context of rods among Believers to
[1:11:14] establish leadership what is the rod of
[1:11:17] Aaron about it's about placing the
[1:11:19] predestinated son in his position it's
[1:11:22] about adoption it's about showing which
[1:11:24] one has the true Jean seed in him praise
[1:11:27] be to God and to put him in his rightful
[1:11:29] position when there is a question or a
[1:11:32] challenge against God's anointed so the
[1:11:35] rod of Aaron is symbolizing the placing
[1:11:38] of a son the rest the Sabbath of God it
[1:11:42] is the believer's position in Christ
[1:11:45] here's a beautiful
[1:11:47] question why didn't all the other rods
[1:11:51] Blossom I mean this is the presence of
[1:11:54] God I mean those rods came into the
[1:11:57] presence of eternal life they should
[1:12:00] have blossomed you think something that
[1:12:03] comes in there should it's coming into
[1:12:05] God's holy presence it should have had
[1:12:07] life in itself it should have blossomed
[1:12:09] it should have become trees for crying
[1:12:10] out
[1:12:12] loud which means even in the divine
[1:12:15] shakina presence of God that which is
[1:12:18] not chosen will remain
[1:12:22] dead why because there is no seed in
[1:12:28] it Why didn't it bring forth what does
[1:12:30] it show
[1:12:32] election this is important it's
[1:12:34] manifesting time this was about election
[1:12:38] amen and manifesting time the
[1:12:40] manifestation would silence the
[1:12:43] murmurings that's the whole point that's
[1:12:45] the context from now on I will silence
[1:12:47] the murmurings of the rebels this is
[1:12:50] very important for you today there's
[1:12:52] going to be many Ministries in the
[1:12:54] message but there's only one open book
[1:12:57] ministry that's the one that will
[1:12:59] produce the
[1:13:01] blossom there's so many people who use
[1:13:03] the message of the Prophet it's do you
[1:13:06] know how easy it is to take messages
[1:13:09] that are so brilliant with the greatest
[1:13:13] quotes and the greatest ideas any any
[1:13:15] person can just take a message book and
[1:13:17] come preach a message but one that
[1:13:20] brings forth the life that produces the
[1:13:22] right manifestation that challenges the
[1:13:25] heart of the believer that takes him
[1:13:27] behind the veil that proves that there's
[1:13:29] a jean seed
[1:13:30] inside one that brings a a Son of God to
[1:13:34] maturity that challenges him to become a
[1:13:36] manifested son that grows him up towards
[1:13:38] adoption there's only one message and
[1:13:41] that one will swallow up everything else
[1:13:44] the others will go into legalism and
[1:13:46] liberalism and elevation of some man's
[1:13:49] Ministry and make some great ministry in
[1:13:51] the world and Elevate some person and
[1:13:54] create an idol but the real Ministry of
[1:13:56] God is going to produce the blossom the
[1:13:59] but the flower the Armen when it gets
[1:14:02] behind the veil it will produce true
[1:14:04] manifested Sons you have to seek that
[1:14:07] message that is the rod of Aaron praise
[1:14:10] be to God everybody is claiming to be a
[1:14:12] chosen Ministry today but when the rod
[1:14:15] of Aaron is manifested everyone can see
[1:14:18] who is the true elected Ministry of God
[1:14:21] you know it's like religions religions
[1:14:24] produce robots
[1:14:25] it brainwashes people Everyone kind of
[1:14:28] acts the same walks the same behaves
[1:14:30] like Pious individuals coming to church
[1:14:33] they look like such traditional
[1:14:35] Christians they they are like programmed
[1:14:37] read the Creed and so on and the message
[1:14:39] Believers think yeah you know but we
[1:14:41] don't have the Creed we don't have
[1:14:42] dogmas we don't it takes 5 seconds for
[1:14:46] you to become a
[1:14:48] denomination to conform to something and
[1:14:51] you know how bad it is the moment you
[1:14:53] start conforming you start judging one
[1:14:55] another on who conforms the
[1:14:59] best that's got nothing to do with
[1:15:03] that we need to be far from that kind of
[1:15:06] life that's the reason why we end up
[1:15:08] hurting one another cutting each other
[1:15:11] up accusing each other of not keeping
[1:15:13] the Cod listen Saints if the length of
[1:15:18] your skirt had to do with Holiness then
[1:15:20] your skirt should be touching the
[1:15:23] ground right yes if the if the height of
[1:15:27] your heel sisters was holy had a measure
[1:15:29] of Holiness then you should be walking
[1:15:34] barefoot if the Holiness of the
[1:15:36] brother's hair uh had to do with how
[1:15:39] long it is then we should all go
[1:15:43] bald who's got the right
[1:15:46] standard who's the most
[1:15:48] holy but look at how Petty we become
[1:15:52] judging each other by who holds the best
[1:15:54] standard
[1:15:55] who prays
[1:15:57] longer who uses the quotes Lord you said
[1:16:00] on Christ the ministry page 28 paragraph
[1:16:02] This that's not a prayer come and pray
[1:16:05] here nobody asks you to preach a sermon
[1:16:07] while you pray take the needs of the
[1:16:09] children of God to to the throne speak
[1:16:11] sincere words don't be an act don't be a
[1:16:14] faker it produces no life it's just
[1:16:17] tradition you're no different from in 5
[1:16:20] seconds you went to someone from the
[1:16:21] Sheep coat to think you're a professor
[1:16:23] of the message
[1:16:26] we were all
[1:16:27] noodies had it not been for this message
[1:16:30] this message gave us the wisdom of God
[1:16:33] how do we suddenly become professors in
[1:16:35] this message authorities to cut one
[1:16:38] another down this Rod of Aaron silences
[1:16:41] the murmurers no matter what you say
[1:16:45] it's going to prove whether you are
[1:16:46] behind the veil or not amen glory to God
[1:16:50] do you love him Saints so the road of
[1:16:53] Aaron is the placing of a son glory to
[1:16:57] God and here's the
[1:16:58] summary the rod of God was judgment and
[1:17:02] it's judgment to those who reject the
[1:17:05] prophet we saw that in the nation out of
[1:17:08] a Nation the first Exodus right the rod
[1:17:11] of Moses is a son of man Ministry which
[1:17:14] is opening the word like the Red Sea
[1:17:17] bringing salvation taking a church out
[1:17:20] of a
[1:17:21] Nation where are we why do people want
[1:17:24] to go back to Rod of God why do they
[1:17:27] want to go back to Rod of Moses God sent
[1:17:30] a
[1:17:31] prophet where are you at are you at
[1:17:33] manifesting time the rod of Aaron the
[1:17:35] placing of a son which Rod are you
[1:17:40] under this is adoption time this is the
[1:17:43] stage of the journey see what I was
[1:17:45] telling you about people stagnating over
[1:17:47] something the rod of Moses the RO of God
[1:17:50] is glorious it's amazing we can all
[1:17:52] stand there and brag and say look at my
[1:17:54] God just judging those sinful
[1:17:57] heathens that's not where I want to be I
[1:18:00] don't want to gloat in the world's
[1:18:02] suffering I'm not interested in gloating
[1:18:04] on God judging America those are people
[1:18:08] those are souls they may be living in
[1:18:11] sin they may be Hollywood people but
[1:18:13] their souls are empty they don't know
[1:18:15] what they're crying out for the soul of
[1:18:18] man is secretly crying out for God but
[1:18:20] they're filling it with tobacco and
[1:18:22] alcohol and fornication and all these
[1:18:25] kind of things but you have the
[1:18:26] privilege of standing behind the veil in
[1:18:28] the presence of God we should pity those
[1:18:31] people the Bible the prophet said the
[1:18:33] only sign and evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:36] was a heart that sighed and cried for
[1:18:39] the Abominations that were in the city
[1:18:41] everything else was not an Evidence this
[1:18:43] was the evidence to find people that
[1:18:46] look at the others listen the white
[1:18:48] Throne judgment is not something for us
[1:18:49] to gloat about you are here for more
[1:18:52] than just to fill a church or manage a
[1:18:54] message Church
[1:18:55] there will be Mercy granted to People
[1:18:58] based on their interactions with
[1:19:01] you that's why that's a greater reason
[1:19:04] there are people that will receive white
[1:19:06] robes simply because they came in
[1:19:08] contact with you and recognized God in
[1:19:13] you that's a great thing this is where
[1:19:16] the bride of Christ ought to be
[1:19:19] amen so let's bring this to a su to a
[1:19:24] conclusion
[1:19:25] let's take this rod and personify it
[1:19:28] let's make it personal let's make it you
[1:19:32] let's first say that the rod is you
[1:19:35] right that means you can be in the hand
[1:19:37] of God in the ministry of the Prophet
[1:19:40] right let's let's look at it how let's
[1:19:42] find a scripture Psalm 74: 2 remember
[1:19:46] thy congregation which thou has
[1:19:48] purchased of old I love that the rod of
[1:19:52] thine inheritance who's the rod of your
[1:19:54] inheritance
[1:19:55] your
[1:19:57] people which thou has redeemed this
[1:20:00] Mount Zion wherein thou has dwelt so
[1:20:04] it's literally personifying the rod who
[1:20:07] is Mount Zion Mount Zion types the bride
[1:20:10] we are no longer come to a mount that
[1:20:11] can be touched we have come to the
[1:20:13] spirits of just men made perfect Mount
[1:20:16] Zion the bride amen let's make it
[1:20:19] personal Saints you are that Rod this is
[1:20:22] an application you are used to right did
[1:20:25] you see that the rod was actually one
[1:20:28] rod from the beginning I told you I'm
[1:20:30] going to bring you to this remember when
[1:20:33] Aaron cast that rod down and it became a
[1:20:35] serpent how do we know it was the rod
[1:20:38] Moses was
[1:20:39] holding because it happened at the
[1:20:41] burning
[1:20:42] bush that was the first place it turned
[1:20:45] into a serpent right amen so do you
[1:20:48] notice he gave him the first sign of his
[1:20:51] Rod turning into a serpent was with
[1:20:52] Moses and this was long before he even
[1:20:55] met Aaron so it's the same Rod all the
[1:20:59] way through just changing
[1:21:02] hands praise be to God long before he
[1:21:05] met Aaron so when they went to Pharaoh
[1:21:08] Aaron's Rod that became a snake was
[1:21:11] actually Moses Rod was actually the rod
[1:21:13] of God Amen but in Aaron's hand it was
[1:21:16] doing something different brother bam
[1:21:18] calls it Moses Rod that took its rods
[1:21:20] into itself yes he did but he understood
[1:21:23] this was Aaron's Ministry so when it was
[1:21:26] time to establish Aaron's Ministry in
[1:21:28] Israel because God said to them I want
[1:21:31] you to be a kingdom of
[1:21:33] priests he didn't want them to have
[1:21:35] Kings God was very upset with Israel
[1:21:38] when they chose a king you know this he
[1:21:40] told them you shall be a kingdom of
[1:21:42] priests you break that down do you know
[1:21:44] what that means God wanted them to be a
[1:21:46] kingdom of
[1:21:49] intercessors they chose to be a kingdom
[1:21:51] of judges
[1:21:54] that was not the right
[1:21:57] Ministry so when it was time to
[1:22:00] establish Aaron's Ministry it was the
[1:22:02] same Rod that went behind the veil Aaron
[1:22:04] and Moses were both of the family of
[1:22:09] Levi and the the name of Levi the was of
[1:22:12] Aaron was written on that Rod all right
[1:22:14] so are you following the story same Rod
[1:22:17] moving through different Ministries did
[1:22:20] you know that the reason God pours the
[1:22:23] vials on the Earth is because of the
[1:22:26] presence of the
[1:22:29] elect the judgments on the world is
[1:22:32] because of
[1:22:35] you of well of course the the judgments
[1:22:37] on Egypt was because of Goan was because
[1:22:40] of Israel they are being judged because
[1:22:43] of your
[1:22:45] presence you are in his hand that's what
[1:22:48] I mean it's because of you that
[1:22:50] judgments are pouring out on people
[1:22:52] because it's the judgments on Earth
[1:22:54] that's going to prepare the Earth for
[1:22:55] you to live
[1:22:57] in how about
[1:23:00] salvation Christ came to die for whose
[1:23:04] sin not theirs your sin my sin he was
[1:23:10] stricken he was struck he was smitten
[1:23:12] for you and me the Bible said Christ
[1:23:16] shall come to save his
[1:23:19] people but God so loved the world that
[1:23:22] he gave his only begotten son that
[1:23:25] whosoever so salvation is offered to
[1:23:28] everyone but he came to die for his
[1:23:31] people for your sin salvation was for
[1:23:34] you not them you are the ones who was
[1:23:38] who was in his mind before the
[1:23:39] foundation of the world you are the ones
[1:23:41] that came by permissive will you are the
[1:23:43] ones that he's concerned with it's your
[1:23:48] sin amen Rod of
[1:23:51] Moses how about the son of man
[1:23:54] ministering in this last day that takes
[1:23:56] you behind the veil how about what
[1:23:57] happens when the open book is brought
[1:23:59] down to earth what takes you behind the
[1:24:03] veil who else is it for it's for you
[1:24:07] right placing adoption do you love him
[1:24:09] says so what happens when you are
[1:24:12] finally behind the veil in the shakina
[1:24:14] presence you will bring forth the life
[1:24:16] of the attribute inside of you that's
[1:24:19] what proves that you are a son of God
[1:24:22] that's what tells you who you really are
[1:24:24] you can be at all other stages of the
[1:24:26] journey you will never know who you are
[1:24:28] you'll never know whether you're
[1:24:29] manifesting the life that was in his
[1:24:31] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:24:33] you look like any other denomination
[1:24:35] like any other church maybe just dressed
[1:24:38] a little different you sing the same
[1:24:41] songs You Preach like others you pray in
[1:24:44] jesus' name if you ask other churches
[1:24:47] well what's the difference then it's
[1:24:49] only your
[1:24:51] Prophet you look like everybody else you
[1:24:53] go to a church you have the same format
[1:24:55] you have the same setup you look like
[1:24:57] everybody else where's the difference
[1:25:00] you say oh it's our dressing no Prophet
[1:25:04] tells you the nazarin dress a whole lot
[1:25:06] better than
[1:25:07] us there's there's people in the world
[1:25:11] in in Orthodox churches that are so holy
[1:25:15] they outshine us
[1:25:20] exponentially they have prayer they have
[1:25:23] fastings they have devotions every day
[1:25:26] they have devotions several times a day
[1:25:29] they observe Christianity they outshine
[1:25:32] us they
[1:25:34] sparkle what's the difference
[1:25:37] then they are not behind the veil they
[1:25:40] are they are in ignorance everything
[1:25:42] they do is in ignorance but out of
[1:25:46] tradition you we a dead dry
[1:25:51] stick picked up by the prophet's minist
[1:25:55] R God took us from the Sheep coat Saints
[1:25:59] we were useless nobody saw any value in
[1:26:01] US we were in this prophet's hand in
[1:26:05] this ministry and God places us behind
[1:26:07] the veil and then we come out and
[1:26:10] manifest a life we know we could never
[1:26:13] have done no one would have recognized
[1:26:15] anything about us but when we come into
[1:26:17] this revealing of the seals the opening
[1:26:20] of the word he brings forth something
[1:26:22] and makes us into something
[1:26:24] that silences the
[1:26:28] murmurers amen as we close it let's look
[1:26:32] at the application for our day let's
[1:26:35] look at the rod of
[1:26:36] God so we can look at it two ways the
[1:26:40] first one was you as the rod but now
[1:26:42] let's look at the rod being the
[1:26:44] book the book where was the book first
[1:26:48] in the hand of he who was on the
[1:26:51] throne when the book was in the hand of
[1:26:53] he who was on the the throne there was
[1:26:55] earthquakes and Lightnings and voices
[1:26:57] and thunderings there was judgments
[1:27:00] there were the 24 Elders falling down
[1:27:02] and Casting Crowns and the beasts
[1:27:04] blocking their eyes saying holy holy
[1:27:06] holy Lord God Almighty which is and
[1:27:08] which was and which is to come this was
[1:27:11] what was happening when the book was in
[1:27:12] the hand of he who was on the throne but
[1:27:14] something had to change the book had to
[1:27:17] shift hands right and in as long as it
[1:27:20] was on the throne in the hand of he was
[1:27:23] on the throne it was judgment all was
[1:27:25] lost for mankind and a cry went out who
[1:27:28] is worthy why that book has to change
[1:27:31] hands again and if that book changes
[1:27:33] hands the ministry changes hands and it
[1:27:35] changes to a book of Salvation because
[1:27:38] it goes into the hands of the bleeding
[1:27:40] bloody lamb which is there the rod of
[1:27:42] God Revelations 4:51 but then it becomes
[1:27:46] the rod of the Prophet Malachi 4:5 and6
[1:27:49] Revelations
[1:27:50] 56789 the seals being opened the lamb
[1:27:53] the son of Ministry taking the book
[1:27:56] breaking the seals revealing everything
[1:27:59] revealing all parts of the word amen and
[1:28:02] so we see when it was in the hand of God
[1:28:05] great signs and wonders upon the Earth
[1:28:07] cataclysmic life changing to the planet
[1:28:10] but when that word is in the hand of the
[1:28:12] invisible God there are trumpets there
[1:28:15] are vials he judges the Earth calling
[1:28:17] out his chosen people but when it moves
[1:28:20] to the hand of the lamb and he is
[1:28:22] breaking the seals he's manifesting the
[1:28:25] word he's bringing salvation to the
[1:28:27] church it turns the heart of the
[1:28:29] children back to the fathers it brings
[1:28:31] the revealing of the seals it brings
[1:28:34] water from the rock glory to God the
[1:28:37] second fold of the seven seal the book
[1:28:39] in the hand of the
[1:28:42] messenger a son of man revealing the son
[1:28:45] of man he said did you notice how
[1:28:48] phenomenal this week was it hasn't been
[1:28:51] a man it's been them angels amen praise
[1:28:55] be to God salvation to the bride but
[1:28:58] that's not the end that's right because
[1:29:00] it doesn't stop with the with that
[1:29:03] angel it now says to the bride go take
[1:29:07] the book what happens this is the rod of
[1:29:10] melchisedek who's melchisedek Kings and
[1:29:13] Priests and they sang a new song Heath
[1:29:17] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[1:29:20] the last destination of the book is in
[1:29:22] the hand of the Bride what happens when
[1:29:25] the bride gets the book she eats the
[1:29:27] book and the book goes where behind the
[1:29:30] veil into the holiest of holies the soul
[1:29:33] of mankind in here is the change over
[1:29:36] from the ministry it's no longer in the
[1:29:38] hand of Moses the Propet or the son of
[1:29:41] man is no longer there in that Heavenly
[1:29:43] Throne it's now on Earth it's behind the
[1:29:46] veil it's now going to make the Jean
[1:29:49] seed manifest and grow and bring forth
[1:29:52] and what does it say now you must speak
[1:29:55] you must prophesy to All Nations
[1:29:57] kindreds tribes and tongues Revelation
[1:29:59] 5:9 he has made us under our God Kings
[1:30:01] and priest Revelations 108-111 the book
[1:30:05] comes down the bride eats the book goes
[1:30:07] behind the veil what happens when each
[1:30:09] individual believer takes that book and
[1:30:12] eats it she's positionally placed she
[1:30:15] speaks to All Nations what is speaking
[1:30:18] to All Nations manifesting blossoming
[1:30:21] blooming buding
[1:30:24] she intercedes for
[1:30:26] mankind she intercedes why because the
[1:30:30] mercy seed is in the bride she is the
[1:30:32] manifestation of the life behind the
[1:30:34] veil she has rest behind the veil and
[1:30:37] what happens rest from murmurings about
[1:30:41] her election people can tell you what
[1:30:43] you want after that there's no more
[1:30:45] question in your heart you're not
[1:30:48] looking for the rod of God you're not
[1:30:49] looking for the rod of man the rod of
[1:30:52] Moses you're not looking for anything
[1:30:54] else because the book has come to you
[1:30:56] and the believer is behind the veil you
[1:30:58] know the prophet says when a man is
[1:31:00] behind the veil he's dead in Christ you
[1:31:03] remember that he says if a man if a man
[1:31:05] is dead and you kick him he doesn't kick
[1:31:07] back he doesn't respond he says just
[1:31:11] like what a Believer is when he's behind
[1:31:12] the veil he's not going to have to
[1:31:14] respond to insults he's not going to
[1:31:16] have to respond to
[1:31:18] pettiness you know this something the
[1:31:21] wonderful the prophet says God has
[1:31:23] calling us to be peculiar not silly
[1:31:27] that's a
[1:31:28] quote message people have taken this
[1:31:31] message and made themselves Silly by
[1:31:34] it this is the truth this is a reason
[1:31:37] why people call us a cult because we act
[1:31:43] cultish remember those times we got all
[1:31:45] holier than thou we came out our lives
[1:31:47] are messed up we were fornicators we

[1:32:51] instead of peculiar
[1:32:54] young people I'm going to give you a
[1:32:56] secret and this is my this is part of my
[1:32:59] testimony I was young too believe it or

[1:33:26] of high school and I I got into class

[1:33:54] principal I professed my faith from the
[1:33:58] first year of high school you know what
[1:34:00] happened my friends made me keep my
[1:34:04] profession If Ever I had to try and stay
[1:34:06] they say hey I thought you
[1:34:09] said like what are you doing here you
[1:34:12] professed it so um I think it was like
[1:34:16] when I was in grade 10 you in South
[1:34:19] Africa they took us for these political
[1:34:20] camps to the mountains they used to
[1:34:23] teach us in a negotiations and politics
[1:34:25] and there were special groups of
[1:34:27] children uh they would choose maybe six
[1:34:30] to 12 kids from every school in Northern
[1:34:32] ital and they took us to the drakensburg
[1:34:34] and they would School Us in how to
[1:34:36] negotiate in politics and we had this
[1:34:39] weekend of you of camps where they were
[1:34:41] teaching us all this stuff and uh at the
[1:34:44] end of the day they would have a dance
[1:34:46] they would have a all because it's so
[1:34:48] many schools together in this in in the
[1:34:50] mountains and they would have this dance
[1:34:53] so here am I in the freezing cold I
[1:34:55] refuse to go
[1:34:57] inside uh to the dance so I'm standing
[1:34:59] outside I'm only 16 so um there of
[1:35:05] course three girls come walking up to me
[1:35:08] and one of them wants to ask me to Dance
[1:35:10] Now girls from my school saw this
[1:35:12] happening they were already dancing they
[1:35:14] ran straight to these girl stop he's a
[1:35:17] good boy he doesn't do
[1:35:20] this I didn't have to say anything my
[1:35:23] friend and the girls in my school
[1:35:25] protected me because I didn't stop
[1:35:28] professing my faith don't
[1:35:31] blend there's nothing good that comes
[1:35:33] from
[1:35:34] blending tell them who you are tell them
[1:35:37] what you stand for they'll keep you in
[1:35:41] line but you try try blending go to work
[1:35:45] some guy there comes and tells you some
[1:35:48] filthy joke and you you laugh at him I
[1:35:52] tell him that's disgusting please please
[1:35:53] don't tell me that again it's not funny
[1:35:56] at all eventually they start apologizing
[1:36:01] they use some swear word and sorry sorry
[1:36:02] we didn't realize you were here that
[1:36:04] even happened when I was working my boss
[1:36:06] would apologize to me don't stop
[1:36:09] professing what you believe the Bible
[1:36:12] says You must profess it that's the part
[1:36:15] that people don't understand his
[1:36:17] strength because the Lord says you are
[1:36:22] defiled by what comes out of your mouth
[1:36:26] you know why this works with humans when
[1:36:28] something is a thought it's still
[1:36:32] okay right it's not it's not actionable
[1:36:35] but when you speak it it causes your
[1:36:39] body a a feedback loop where it it
[1:36:42] places the nature inside you it finishes
[1:36:45] the thought and it becomes creation
[1:36:48] inside you so if you profess the word
[1:36:52] you keep saying this is is who I am I do
[1:36:55] not believe this I do not swear I do not
[1:36:58] curse I do not speak this I do not
[1:37:00] listen to this I'm not going to watch
[1:37:01] this I'm not going to go to the dance I
[1:37:03] never had to come and ask my parents to
[1:37:05] say please can I go to the dance I had
[1:37:08] already professed to so many people even
[1:37:10] if in my heart which it didn't happen
[1:37:12] but if I felt like no way not happening
[1:37:15] too many people know what I professed
[1:37:17] already and I'm going to get
[1:37:20] crucified so I did the best I was head
[1:37:23] boy of my school so I helped them I was
[1:37:26] artistic so I helped them draw all the
[1:37:28] signs for the metrick dance the end of
[1:37:30] the year dance I did all of that for
[1:37:32] them and the day of the dance I was not
[1:37:34] there and they all knew no one's going
[1:37:36] to ask me questions no one's going to
[1:37:38] tell me you missed out on something it
[1:37:40] was so uh it was such such a great thing
[1:37:44] that when I got married one of my
[1:37:46] friends flew down and told my father I
[1:37:48] came to see if this was actually real
[1:37:50] nobody thought this guy was ever going
[1:37:52] to get married
[1:37:56] young people it works profess what you
[1:38:00] believe profess who you are it's real
[1:38:03] it's powerful it
[1:38:05] works the word is nigh thee even in thy
[1:38:09] mouth it's
[1:38:11] powerful the same way that humans are
[1:38:13] defiled by what they say you also
[1:38:16] purified by what you say praise be to
[1:38:19] God so let's close this down my last
[1:38:22] thought on this is don't get stuck on
[1:38:25] the rod of God and the rod of Moses
[1:38:28] let's complete the journey let's go to
[1:38:31] the rod of Aaron what does it mean by
[1:38:33] going to the rod of Aaron we must
[1:38:35] complete this journey by living behind
[1:38:37] the veil
[1:38:39] amen break that down even further I'm
[1:38:42] not interested in message Traditions I'm
[1:38:45] not interested in message denomination
[1:38:48] I'm not going to get uh excited with
[1:38:51] miracles signs and wonders they are good
[1:38:54] they are good for a church where there
[1:38:56] are people growing we need the gifts we
[1:38:58] need those parts of the gifts but I
[1:39:00] don't want to get stuck there I don't
[1:39:02] want to get stuck on God sent a prophet
[1:39:04] remember the elders in those days in the
[1:39:07] days of the message if you went out to
[1:39:09] preach to to spread the word to somebody
[1:39:11] there were three things they they spoke
[1:39:13] about God sent a prophet do you know
[1:39:15] what triple six is and uh let me tell
[1:39:17] you what the Judgment the oop and Seed
[1:39:20] those were the three things so uh
[1:39:23] uh God sent a prophet triple six mark of
[1:39:26] the beast and Su seed you can't tell
[1:39:30] people that today you can try they're
[1:39:32] going to shut you down straight away cuz
[1:39:34] they all have already heard about
[1:39:35] William Brandon he's a cult he's on the
[1:39:37] internet the moment you start with God
[1:39:39] sent a prophet sorry you know you guys
[1:39:41] are like the Mormons even your church
[1:39:43] age book looks exactly like them you
[1:39:45] know you got this blue book on the
[1:39:47] inside is a picture of your Prophet
[1:39:49] you're just like them you're no
[1:39:50] different you're a
[1:39:52] cult you can't even do that anymore how
[1:39:55] are you going to affect them today they
[1:39:58] must see the manifested life that's the
[1:40:01] only way that's the day you're living in
[1:40:04] don't get stuck let me give you an
[1:40:06] example right you are a tabernacle there
[1:40:09] is a veil of self-will that separates
[1:40:11] your soul from your spirit most
[1:40:14] Believers love to see the rod of God I
[1:40:16] remember the the days the elders in the
[1:40:19] message and the people today do you know
[1:40:22] what can can you believe it Believers
[1:40:24] got shaken up when brother Billy Paul
[1:40:26] passed away because it was like what
[1:40:29] about that prophecy about the
[1:40:31] Sharks and they got shattered there were
[1:40:34] brothers messaging me to say brother
[1:40:36] aliser what now did the Rapture finish
[1:40:37] did we miss the Rapture what happened
[1:40:39] about I had to tell them the truth I'm
[1:40:41] sorry brothers that prophecy is not in
[1:40:44] the message it may have been something
[1:40:46] that God told Brother Billy Paul to help
[1:40:49] him it was for him it's got nothing to
[1:40:51] do with me I'm not going to make any big
[1:40:52] deal about it I don't find it in the
[1:40:54] message it was his testimony and God
[1:40:57] must have shown him something to make
[1:40:59] sure brother Billy Paul stays in line
[1:41:01] with the message I don't know but I'm
[1:41:04] not going to make so much about it I'm
[1:41:07] not going to let it hinder my faith let
[1:41:09] me show you why most people in the
[1:41:11] message are going after watching whether
[1:41:14] California is going to sink what do I
[1:41:16] care if California sinks the Vatican the
[1:41:18] pope we're watching that we're watching
[1:41:20] Israel you're watching all that and your
[1:41:22] children are dis appearing that's right
[1:41:25] the next generation is disappearing but
[1:41:28] you're watching the Pope the Vatican
[1:41:29] California you're looking for the rod of
[1:41:32] God in the world and you're not getting
[1:41:33] behind the veil and getting you and your
[1:41:36] children and your family behind the veil
[1:41:38] and teaching them to love the open
[1:41:42] book the rod of God then the problem is
[1:41:46] people ran uh into people nowadays
[1:41:49] challenging the prophet right you can
[1:41:52] see it on the internet proving the cloud
[1:41:54] was false brother Ram's prophecies were
[1:41:57] false they can't cope what's wrong
[1:42:00] brother Alis what do we do the youth are
[1:42:03] panicking we can't talk to our friends
[1:42:05] look at all this stuff and believe the
[1:42:06] sign and seeking the truth and what are
[1:42:08] they saying about you know what it's the
[1:42:10] rod of Moses they can't survive unless
[1:42:13] someone's holding up the Prophet The
[1:42:15] Prophet's
[1:42:17] hands see what do you want our us
[1:42:19] message pastors to be apologist for
[1:42:21] brother brandham
[1:42:24] being an apologist is the worst place to
[1:42:26] be in I can't make up excuses for
[1:42:29] brother bham because he said this in
[1:42:31] this place and he said it differently in
[1:42:32] another place or because we got some guy
[1:42:35] who walked with the prophet making a
[1:42:37] testimony that is contradiction to
[1:42:39] something he said I am not interested in
[1:42:42] that I don't need somebody holding up
[1:42:45] moses'
[1:42:46] hands because I've received the open
[1:42:49] book I'm beyond all that the first and
[1:42:52] second Paul doesn't even matter to me
[1:42:54] anymore I don't care about anything if
[1:42:57] go if I'm behind the veil and God wants
[1:42:59] me to die of stage four cancer and
[1:43:02] doesn't want to heal me I'm okay with
[1:43:04] that because nothing is going to affect
[1:43:06] me I fear no death no pain no suffering
[1:43:09] no sickness no Peril no sword can
[1:43:12] separate us from the love that is in
[1:43:14] Christ Jesus you were a a dead stick
[1:43:18] once he gives you the open book he
[1:43:20] brings you behind the veil you become
[1:43:22] manifested if you're still in the hand
[1:43:24] if you're still under the rod of God if
[1:43:26] you're still under the rod of Moses
[1:43:28] you're still a dead
[1:43:30] stick no matter how powerful the
[1:43:32] ministry is no matter how many
[1:43:34] Ministries there are and how they're
[1:43:35] talking about the judgments and Israel
[1:43:37] and the Vatican and the pope and Los
[1:43:39] Angeles thinking you're still a dead
[1:43:42] stick unless you've received the open
[1:43:44] book you're still a dead stick nobody
[1:43:47] can tell they're just going to call you
[1:43:48] a cult but when you receive the open
[1:43:51] book when you receive the opening of the
[1:43:53] seals when you recognize his coming in
[1:43:55] you personally from there on it's like
[1:43:58] the woman at the well she was always a
[1:44:00] dead stick but she was a
[1:44:02] Believer she recognized Christ when he
[1:44:04] was there and she said we know that when
[1:44:07] Messiah comes he will do this I am he
[1:44:09] that speaks to you that was the end she
[1:44:12] had gone behind the veil come see a man
[1:44:14] who told me my life but look at those
[1:44:17] Pharisees and those scribes those
[1:44:19] learned men who are looking for that
[1:44:21] prophecy the same Messiah spoke to them
[1:44:24] and they were just dead
[1:44:28] sticks others love the rod of Moses God
[1:44:32] sent a prophet first pole Ministry
[1:44:33] second pole Ministry competition between
[1:44:36] message people and denominations
[1:44:38] preaching against denominations gets us
[1:44:41] what seeking after signs and wonders and
[1:44:44] all of these things convention meetings
[1:44:46] and great anointings and great jumping
[1:44:48] around and screaming and falling all
[1:44:50] over the floor and gets us what if you
[1:44:53] can't love your husband right if you
[1:44:56] can't uh love your wife right if you
[1:44:59] can't bring up your children what's the
[1:45:00] point of falling down and passing out
[1:45:02] under the
[1:45:06] anointing they find if you're under the
[1:45:09] rod of God and under the rod of Moses
[1:45:10] you find no growth you'll lose the Next
[1:45:16] Generation the Commandment of God to
[1:45:18] keep the Commandments keep means to
[1:45:21] preserve Preserve you shall keep the
[1:45:24] light of the Candlestick burning as a
[1:45:26] propitiation from now for your children
[1:45:28] and your children's children and your
[1:45:30] children's children's children never let
[1:45:32] this light go out what are we doing
[1:45:35] while we fussing about message
[1:45:36] traditions and Desiring the rod of God
[1:45:39] in the rod of Moses and making up the
[1:45:41] name of William brandom greater than
[1:45:42] anything else it's supposed to be bride
[1:45:45] time it's supposed to be now when you
[1:45:48] are manifesting the life of God to the
[1:45:50] public that's where we ought to be
[1:45:52] people should be thirsting for what you
[1:45:54] have people should see the sign of the
[1:45:56] Messiah in you they should see the The
[1:45:59] Compassion of God they should see the
[1:46:01] transforming power of your words glory
[1:46:04] to God hallelujah we're losing the new
[1:46:07] generation with they're sitting in
[1:46:09] church with pure
[1:46:11] boredom because we're going on with
[1:46:13] message
[1:46:15] buzzwords you can have services so
[1:46:17] powerful you can walk up and down and
[1:46:19] shout seven Thunders and peruja and this
[1:46:22] and that and message Buzz words and just
[1:46:24] watch the faces of the children they're
[1:46:26] bored they're tired they're sleeping
[1:46:28] they're not
[1:46:31] interested you're not even speaking
[1:46:33] anything that is relevant to them these
[1:46:36] kids are under a barrage of stuff from
[1:46:40] the internet social media horrible
[1:46:43] things we never grew up with words
[1:46:46] language pictures inappropriate stuff
[1:46:50] learning the language of a global system
[1:46:54] if you're preaching some denominational
[1:46:56] message do you realize how bored they
[1:46:58] are is there any message uh that you can
[1:47:03] preach that is more excitable than a
[1:47:05] cell phone to a person to a young
[1:47:09] kid huh
[1:47:11] anything they'll leave the church right
[1:47:14] now to play some game on a cell
[1:47:16] phone or do something girls with social
[1:47:19] media that you should see the youth
[1:47:21] camps if you not speaking relevant
[1:47:24] things that takes them behind the veil
[1:47:26] they're bored with everything you're
[1:47:27] saying they're like here goes that guy
[1:47:30] again the kid said I was a kid in church
[1:47:32] I know I know exactly how each brother
[1:47:35] prayed how he shook his leg when he
[1:47:37] prayed how the one would start we know
[1:47:40] exactly how he starts ask the kids
[1:47:42] they'll tell
[1:47:43] you what words he uses who's they'll
[1:47:46] even while they sitting oh no not him
[1:47:48] praying again I hate it when he
[1:47:50] prays that's how kids are they're
[1:47:53] watching you if you're not speaking
[1:47:55] relevant things you're losing
[1:47:58] them Elders if you haven't noticed are
[1:48:02] dying out all the Ministries that took
[1:48:05] the world the message to the world are
[1:48:08] dying out and many of them are are
[1:48:10] becoming irrelevant no one's listening
[1:48:13] to them anymore this is where we are
[1:48:15] right now you are becoming the
[1:48:18] elders you are becoming the ones who are
[1:48:20] supposed to have the answers to the
[1:48:21] questions there are questions they have
[1:48:24] today which were not questions in when
[1:48:26] when I was a kid to ask questions to my
[1:48:29] dad these kids have new questions I
[1:48:32] could tell you some of them today but we
[1:48:34] don't have time it's too much just go to
[1:48:37] youth camps and you hear it Saints you
[1:48:40] cannot survive under the rod of God or
[1:48:43] the rod of Moses any longer because each
[1:48:46] one has a time
[1:48:48] limit judgments only judgments are all
[1:48:51] in time
[1:48:53] right salvation is all in time it has to
[1:48:56] come to a point where you're
[1:48:58] not
[1:49:00] lost salvation is for the Lost there has
[1:49:04] to come to a point where but when the
[1:49:06] rod goes behind the veil it's
[1:49:09] eternity it's Eternal it's behind the
[1:49:12] veil you can't stay under those
[1:49:15] Ministries because there's a time limit
[1:49:18] and your your Revival is going to run
[1:49:20] out and it has
[1:49:24] do you understand why the gifts are
[1:49:27] dwindling do you understand why those
[1:49:29] anointings are dwindling God is allowing
[1:49:32] it you're never going to see great
[1:49:35] Ministries rise up again with sweeping
[1:49:38] healings and this ministry of the Bride
[1:49:40] is not going to go around healing on
[1:49:42] finding a cure for cancers absolutely
[1:49:44] not this is a different
[1:49:47] time Amen in
[1:49:51] closing you're still a dead dry stick if
[1:49:54] you're not bringing forth get behind the
[1:49:57] veil let the word get into the third
[1:50:00] pool phase or take you into the ark
[1:50:03] itself under The Mercy Seat where you
[1:50:05] can bloom and bod and manifest the
[1:50:08] attribute that is within you do you
[1:50:10] believe that musicians you can come
[1:50:13] forward you need to realize if you're
[1:50:16] behind the
[1:50:17] veil that that Rod went and stayed under
[1:50:21] The Mercy Seat
[1:50:23] never to come out again amen it stayed
[1:50:27] in there there was once it was in and it
[1:50:29] bed and blossomed and Bloom Moses was
[1:50:32] not going to use it again Joshua was not
[1:50:34] going to use it that that Rod would
[1:50:37] would stay in the ark and cross over
[1:50:39] into the promised land and go across the
[1:50:42] Jordan which is a type of the seven seal
[1:50:43] opening up the new land and if anyone
[1:50:46] had any arguments again it simply had to
