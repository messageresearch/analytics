[14:52] experience
[14:54] I have this trigger on the wood Jericho
[14:56] and you guys probably don't know this
[14:58] but you talk about Jericho more than
[15:00] most churches and every time somebody
[15:02] says Jericho uh my mind
[15:06] and I may not pay attention to all of
[15:08] the well thought out words that brother
[15:09] bear might say after the word Jericho
[15:12] um but this happened enough times that
[15:15] um I I was hearing the stone in my head
[15:18] while also listening to what was in this
[15:21] story there's actually a whole lot of
[15:22] content in the story that isn't in the
[15:24] old song and so on Sunday I brought this
[15:26] to a whole new depth and I was sitting
[15:28] in the back here writing more verses in
[15:29] my head while um not giving Ben the
[15:32] attention he deserves her as well
[15:34] thought I was
[15:35] um so I wrote a few more verses I was
[15:37] going to cook them longer before
[15:38] bringing them but I just really felt
[15:41] like wearing them today so

[30:05] the house of the Lord and I'm so
[30:07] thankful once again for the opportunity
[30:09] to minister the word of God and it's not
[30:12] a light thing I tell you that for free
[30:14] it's not a light thing
[30:16] um it's a very serious thing but I
[30:18] believe that if we just trust in God as
[30:20] we just I mean there's been a theme of
[30:22] these songs then uh the Lord will amen
[30:25] he will give you what you need amen
[30:27] who's needful tonight
[30:28] amen who has needs on their heart I want
[30:30] you to just make them known to the Lord
[30:32] and invite him to your Pew invite them
[30:35] to where you're at he knows where you're
[30:37] at and he wants you to know where you're

[30:42] good things that comes from him amen
[30:44] hallelujah I won't leave you standing
[30:46] too long I promise so let's um uh so
[30:51] yeah tonight let's turn in our Bibles to
[30:52] Hebrews 12 thank you 12 verse 1 and I
[30:56] want to speak on the subject of the cost
[30:58] of conquering I mean that was just a
[31:00] title but I I couldn't really title it
[31:04] well it was the cost of advancing it was
[31:06] the cost of conquering it was so close
[31:08] yet so far you know there was all these
[31:10] different things or knowing when to move
[31:12] so I just thought well I'll just say
[31:14] them all because that's kind of all of
[31:16] the thing in one so amen let's read so
[31:20] um it says here wherefore seeing we also
[31:23] are compassed about with so great a
[31:24] cloud of witnesses
[31:27] aren't you glare for that great Cloud
[31:28] amen of witnesses let us lay aside every
[31:31] weight that does so easily beside us
[31:36] and let us run with patients the race
[31:38] that are set before us may the Lord
[31:40] bless his word you may be seated
[31:43] ah praise the Lord amen
[31:46] it's so good to be in the house of the
[31:48] Lord again tonight and I just want to
[31:51] encourage you with a few words that has
[31:53] been placed on my heart a while back and
[31:55] it just got refined and refined and as I
[31:57] was speaking on Sunday some more things
[31:59] came out
[32:00] um when I was at brother Moses there and
[32:03] we had a good service there and the
[32:06] Brethren were happy and we had a good
[32:08] time
[32:09] um they really pull and they really make
[32:11] you feel tired after the service so oh
[32:13] my someone there's got some real uh real
[32:17] Apostolic Faith you know and I believe
[32:20] that's here too you know because I I
[32:22] definitely feel tired after preaching
[32:23] any service so but something about that
[32:26] place oh my goodness my amen hallelujah
[32:30] you know and you sing and you know we're
[32:32] so used to this acoustic here where it
[32:34] absorbs all our sound but when you sing
[32:36] in the hall it's like you can hear all
[32:38] these reverberations and acoustic and
[32:40] you really can get some harmonies going
[32:41] you know I thought man we need to just
[32:43] take the ceiling off you know let's just
[32:45] take it off let's worship so high so
[32:47] hard so fast and so good that the
[32:49] ceiling just disappears hallelujah amen
[32:52] well praise the Lord see um I want to
[32:55] speak on the cost of conquering or the
[32:58] cost of advancing you see when it's okay
[33:01] right when you kind of just float along
[33:04] it's all good it's plain sailing you
[33:06] just sit you turn up to church on
[33:07] Wednesday and you enjoy the service and
[33:11] then you turn up to church on Sunday and
[33:12] you enjoy the service okay and you're
[33:15] just sitting there and you're enjoying
[33:16] that and you go to work during the week
[33:18] and you enjoy that and and life is good
[33:20] you have a little trial here and there
[33:22] and you're just coasting but if you want
[33:24] to advance
[33:25] if you want to conquer if you want to
[33:28] take some more of your land if you want
[33:30] to take some of your family if you want
[33:33] your children to come in if you want
[33:35] things to advance in your life
[33:36] spiritually I'm not talking about now
[33:39] Prosperity stuff that you can go and
[33:40] naming and claim it and get houses and
[33:42] buildings and lands if God calls you to
[33:44] that praise God but for I'm talking
[33:46] about spiritual inheritance now when
[33:49] that if you've got something in your
[33:50] heart and I believe I'm speaking to
[33:52] people that do have a desire in their
[33:54] heart to advance a desire in their heart
[33:56] to lay hold of their inheritance a
[33:58] desire in the heart and a sick of the
[34:00] devil sweating on their land sick of the
[34:02] devil holding back sick of the devil in
[34:04] other people's lives holding them back
[34:05] on children's lives or whatever it may
[34:07] be well then it's gonna it comes at a
[34:09] cost and the cost is subject to you the
[34:13] cost is shown to you by God because when
[34:17] you begin to advance then you'll go
[34:18] through trials and he'll ask you what
[34:20] are you willing to give up
[34:21] what whites are in your life that are
[34:24] holding you down what's encumbering you
[34:27] amen and what's easily besetting you you
[34:31] know that word easily besetting it's
[34:33] very interesting skillfully surrounding
[34:35] every front is what that means
[34:38] so these sins these things these falling
[34:41] short of the muck these breaking the
[34:43] rules unbelief or doubts and and and
[34:46] doing these things that are wrong and
[34:48] breaking the laws of God right they they
[34:51] are skillfully surrounding every front
[34:54] of your life
[34:56] every front so I'd say I was like well
[34:58] what are the fronts and and I don't know
[35:00] maybe the Lord spoke to me I'm not too
[35:02] sure but I got I got I got information
[35:04] so information came see touch feel smell
[35:08] here this is the physical fronts on my
[35:11] help me Lord then there's more fronts
[35:13] there's conscience affections oh my
[35:16] imaginations Lord help me Lord help me
[35:19] memories oh Lord and affections and
[35:23] reasoning oh so you can see there's
[35:25] fronts and if you leave those fronts
[35:28] there there's devils and there's schemes
[35:31] and there's all sorts of Master plans
[35:33] that have been around for thousands of
[35:34] years that are trying to skillfully take
[35:38] you down
[35:39] hold you down the Bible calls them
[35:41] weights and they will be delivered to
[35:44] you better than any FedEx better than
[35:46] any Amazon Prime post or anything they
[35:49] will be delivered to you they come to
[35:51] your house in the form of a box of
[35:53] snakes
[35:54] and I just encourage you to never sign
[35:57] for the box of snakes never sign for
[36:00] these easily besetting sins
[36:04] and if they're in your life because of
[36:06] inheritance things that you're born with
[36:08] ways you've been up raised that's that
[36:10] there is going to be a Deliverance for
[36:13] you tonight
[36:14] who believes that God delivers
[36:16] amen who believes that God if you had
[36:18] the same faith that everyone else that
[36:20] got delivered don't you think you'll get
[36:21] delivered to he's not impartial he's no
[36:23] respecter of persons so if there's
[36:25] something in your life that you need
[36:26] deliverance from have faith in God in
[36:29] the finished work of the Lamb blood
[36:31] sacrifice that's all it's very simple
[36:34] it's not a big climbing the steps on
[36:36] your knees to the Saint Peter's Basilica
[36:38] you know some Penance or some idea of
[36:41] religion or some groveling oh my you
[36:44] know I was just listening to some sermon
[36:46] today I listen to a few but one of them
[36:47] the prophet was talking about how um
[36:51] actually I'll come back to that soon I
[36:53] won't go into that right now because
[36:54] otherwise I'll get way ahead of myself
[36:56] as you you know we get excited up here
[36:57] but I want to be a good boy so easy so
[37:01] lay aside I just want this is a little
[37:02] Foundation lay aside every weight
[37:05] like easily beset now that word wait is
[37:09] to be encumbered and I found a
[37:11] definition of encumber and I just want
[37:13] to read these out to you all synonyms of
[37:15] encumber so just think about things that
[37:19] would encumber you and the different
[37:20] stuff that it can do in you to you clog
[37:24] cramp
[37:26] embarrass oh my fitter oh aren't you so
[37:30] glad that he breaks every fitter every
[37:32] fitter
[37:33] you don't have to be fitted you don't
[37:35] have to be encumbered you don't be held
[37:38] down you know we will travel by thought
[37:40] I thought man that's the greatest form
[37:42] of Transport traveling by thought can I
[37:45] have a turbo up here please I am so hot
[37:47] I haven't even started preaching
[37:51] I'm like cooking is it is it just me it
[37:54] must be just me hold on let me just
[37:56] loosen up a little bit
[37:58] hallelujah amen
[38:01] excuse me is I don't want to be
[38:03] too too rough I'll just tighten a little
[38:06] bit
[38:09] oh amen let's just let's just uh let's
[38:14] just worship the roof off this place
[38:15] amen
[38:17] feta hamper I mean some of these words
[38:20] we're going to have a bit of a uh you
[38:22] know going to go through some history
[38:23] here of the words we've heard way in the
[38:26] past but handcuff oh my handicap you
[38:29] know a handicap is a is a deficit it's
[38:32] something that's that you have in your
[38:34] life that stops you from being your
[38:36] potential or what you are meant to be or
[38:39] something that you has put on you to
[38:41] hold you back
[38:43] you know in golf if someone's really
[38:45] really good now I might be wrong I'm not
[38:47] a golfer but as far as I understand if
[38:50] you're really good you have a certain
[38:51] handicap on a field that you start off
[38:54] with to kind of equal your game out with
[38:56] the with all of the normal people so
[39:00] that you can actually you know I think
[39:01] is that right does anyone know about
[39:03] golf is that right so if you're really
[39:05] good then the the rules of that course
[39:07] will put a handicap on you or you get
[39:09] one as a person registered golfer and so
[39:11] you know the devil wants to put a
[39:13] handicap on you
[39:15] he wants to weigh you down he wants to
[39:17] hold you into a natural realm he wants
[39:19] to hurt your prayer life and take away
[39:21] your ability to advance on your
[39:24] inheritance but we're called to advance
[39:27] we're called to a war we're called to
[39:29] step forward and not just step forward
[39:32] but run towards the enemy fearlessly
[39:35] that's why as I preached the other few
[39:36] weeks ago about the atmosphere of War
[39:39] that's why we have an atmosphere that's
[39:41] why we will sing you know we don't just
[39:43] come to church just to sing nice songs
[39:44] to stretch our vocal cords and pull it
[39:47] and please God yes we worship in God but
[39:49] in the process of worshiping God what
[39:51] happens is he comes it changes
[39:54] everything then the fear goes then the
[39:56] anxiety goes then the malice goes then
[39:58] the lust goes then all of these things
[40:01] that weigh us down to hold us in a
[40:03] natural condition that encumber us that
[40:05] weigh us that are skillfully surrounding
[40:08] every front of our life
[40:11] but the Bible says lay them aside and
[40:14] tonight I encourage you it's time to lay
[40:17] them aside it's time to get serious with
[40:19] God and I ask God Lord please help me to
[40:22] get into the spirit of your burden
[40:25] because sometimes you get so
[40:28] um encouraged excited by the Revelation
[40:32] and how it all comes together that you
[40:33] miss the very heart of it
[40:35] and sometimes we sit here and we get
[40:37] we're just learning
[40:39] don't learn actually you can learn but
[40:41] just don't just learn tonight I want you
[40:44] to open your heart and say Lord
[40:46] speak to me on a spiritual level and let
[40:50] me feel the holy ghost in my conscience
[40:54] instead of feeling all these other
[40:55] Spirits in your conscience all the time
[40:57] from all these other skillfully
[40:59] surrounding entities why not let the
[41:01] Holy Spirit take control of those places
[41:03] let the Holy Spirit you know Jehoshaphat
[41:05] he one of the things he did was he he
[41:09] put more garrisons around his Board of
[41:11] land
[41:12] but he doesn't just stay there you know
[41:14] what he did after that he then began to
[41:16] teach the law of God all throughout the
[41:18] land and then the fear of God fell on
[41:19] the enemies and then they started
[41:20] thinking twice about attacking Judah
[41:23] you want the devil to think twice about
[41:26] attacking you
[41:27] and I believe that you're equipped
[41:28] you've got all the resources to be in
[41:31] that condition
[41:32] you've got all the resources to to run
[41:35] like David ran towards Goliath amen all
[41:37] the resources within your life and if
[41:40] it's not within you it's time tonight
[41:41] don't leave without it
[41:43] don't leave without it lay aside those
[41:46] things that hold you back on the ground
[41:47] to make your prayer life boring
[41:51] or make your Bible reading boring that's
[41:54] what the devil wants he wants you to
[41:55] have a boring prayer life a boring Bible
[41:57] study life he wants Church to be boring
[42:00] children I hope you have I have your
[42:02] attention the devil wants Church to be
[42:04] boring for you that's that's one of his
[42:07] jobs he probably assigns Devils to the
[42:09] children make sure they're bored make
[42:11] sure they can't understand it
[42:13] but tonight lay aside
[42:17] that normal thinking pattern
[42:20] lay it aside it's a weight it's
[42:21] encumbering you it's going to hold you
[42:23] natural it's time to be Supernatural
[42:27] we're going to change bodies soon we're
[42:29] going in a Rapture soon so let's just
[42:31] get serious with God about laying these
[42:33] things aside now I'm preaching to myself
[42:34] here because I've got things I need to
[42:36] lay aside and you know the closer you
[42:38] get to God the more you see what there
[42:42] is
[42:43] otherwise you just can't see the wood
[42:44] for the trees right you have no
[42:45] discernment without the spirit of God
[42:47] the prophet said that we don't what we
[42:50] need is not just an emotional thing we
[42:52] need something higher than that we need
[42:54] it holy ghost lifting up he said when
[42:56] the spirit comes down to lift you you
[42:59] see more
[43:00] and then when you see more then he says
[43:03] now you can see Ichabod marked on all
[43:05] the portals of all these Babylonian
[43:06] things
[43:07] because Babylon out there this is a very
[43:10] skillfully crafted environment of
[43:13] Satan's Eden all out there everywhere
[43:18] oh my
[43:19] any entity that fears the people is like
[43:23] Saul
[43:24] you know Saul King Saul
[43:26] he feared what people thought and
[43:28] therefore he came under their leadership
[43:30] and that's what lost him as Kingdom
[43:33] he lost his kingdom because he feared
[43:35] men and now look at politicians they
[43:37] fear what people think so therefore they
[43:39] go with the flow of the spirit of the
[43:41] nation and then they just stuck
[43:44] schools and and I just think I just it
[43:47] just grates against me so much like
[43:49] businesses that paint these stupid
[43:52] rainbows on their stuff and they have no
[43:54] care for homosexual people at all they
[43:57] don't care about them they don't give us
[43:58] stuff about homosexual people they just
[44:00] want to look good and I think the ones
[44:02] that really care about gay people is us
[44:05] who want to see their soul saved they
[44:07] want to see the reason why are you
[44:09] confused and dysphoric in your genes uh
[44:12] what do you call that thing gender why
[44:15] they're not even allowed to ask in
[44:16] Psychology you know that they're not
[44:18] even allowed to ask psychologists they
[44:20] come at schools I feel like I don't know
[44:23] who I am or what I am they just get
[44:25] given all the prescriptions to change
[44:27] the agenda and no questions
[44:30] oh my and they're not allowed if they
[44:31] question it then it's uh what do they
[44:33] call it discrimination
[44:34] that's really bad so this the society is
[44:37] falling apart
[44:38] and it just makes me sick to see these
[44:41] businesses that fear what people think
[44:43] the fear of man is such and I I mean
[44:46] this is one big trial in my life was the
[44:48] fear of men fearing what people thought
[44:50] of me as a minister and I still fight
[44:52] that
[44:53] it's something I have to pray when I go
[44:55] in there and before I preach anywhere
[44:57] preaching I pray Lord please take all
[45:00] fear of what people think and try to
[45:02] make myself something or anything just
[45:04] take it all away
[45:05] because the moment you're delivered from
[45:07] the fear of what people think God can
[45:09] use you to your full potential
[45:12] without any hindrance
[45:14] but your old nature will always fear
[45:16] those things your old nature is
[45:17] connected and I'm in this sermon tonight
[45:19] Saul is your old nature
[45:21] and as the time goes on he gets more and
[45:24] more ferocious you know that Soul gets
[45:27] more and more ferocious if you look at
[45:29] the story of first Samuel Saul got worse
[45:31] and worse and worse and worse and worse
[45:33] didn't he
[45:34] he got worse and worse and the things
[45:36] it's so unreasonable
[45:38] man if Saul had just gone you know what
[45:40] God I am accepting your plan David's
[45:43] King he would have had a good time
[45:45] you know that but the old nature just
[45:48] can't do it that's why God gives you
[45:50] power over your old nature so that you
[45:52] can lay that thing down and all of its
[45:54] encumbering weights and it's going to be
[45:56] there till you get the body changed but
[45:58] if you can lay those things aside and
[46:01] let God come in and take all the fear
[46:04] away from your life you will no longer
[46:06] be encumbered
[46:08] there's other words hobble who wants to
[46:11] hobble along
[46:13] just hobble along in your life hobbling
[46:15] along crippled or just maimed in a
[46:19] little bit just silenced you know
[46:21] feeling a bit down feeling depressed
[46:23] feeling a bit empty that's what the
[46:25] devil wants he wants to weigh you down
[46:26] but I can encourage you tonight let God
[46:29] speak to you have faith in this moment
[46:32] because if you have faith in this moment
[46:34] God will he could speak a word that will
[46:37] unlock that thing in your life and show
[46:39] you why you've been weighed down all
[46:42] your life
[46:43] or maybe weighed down for a year or two
[46:45] years or six years whenever things
[46:47] started to do those things in your life
[46:49] the only thing you cannot just go on you
[46:51] know what I'm gonna just go and do a big
[46:53] um profile of my life and try and find
[46:56] out why I'm like this nah don't do that
[46:59] actually just ask God yeah if you ask
[47:02] God he's the one that knows all about
[47:04] you he knows why these things are why
[47:06] they are
[47:07] you know people flocked to Brother
[47:09] branham's house to his office to
[47:12] wherever they could to get discernment
[47:14] they wanted to know why they're like
[47:17] they are and then and the Lord would
[47:18] show him all these many times he already
[47:21] knew what they were coming to ask for
[47:22] and he would just tell them he had it
[47:24] all written down on paper the spirit of
[47:26] God would preempt him and give him all
[47:28] the answers for them so that it didn't
[47:30] take too long probably I don't know but
[47:33] anyway because you can imagine everyone
[47:34] in the world wanted to see that one man
[47:36] yeah
[47:37] no matter what people say today about
[47:39] him on the internet all that rubbish
[47:40] everyone wanted to see him and all
[47:43] ministers and all the great prominent
[47:45] people all wanted to know they all
[47:48] wanted to hear from him they all wanted
[47:49] to see him people
[47:51] were interested in their condition they
[47:53] wanted to know where am I at according
[47:55] to God where am I at and you know what
[47:58] the profit's gone but the same God who
[48:01] sent the prophet is here with the same
[48:03] word that can come across your heart to
[48:05] this tonight and speak to you and
[48:08] something to liberate you so that you're
[48:11] no longer incumbent or weighed down you
[48:13] know those things on the front of your
[48:14] imagination or your conscience or your
[48:16] affections you know man the affections
[48:18] oh they just there's so much in this
[48:21] world good things can take your
[48:23] affections and spread them until you've
[48:26] got about a millimeter of effects I
[48:28] don't know if you've got 100 ml of
[48:29] affections you've got one mil in
[48:31] everything
[48:32] and so when you when it comes to God
[48:34] you've only got one meal for him because
[48:36] you like so much stuff
[48:38] but sometimes we've got to take
[48:40] inventory yeah of our life and go what
[48:42] I've got so many things going on I've
[48:44] got so many pots on the stove in my life
[48:46] I've got so much I'm incumbent
[48:50] and therefore your affections become
[48:52] flat
[48:54] you know you really become like a mild
[48:56] person
[48:58] not much emotion just going through the
[49:02] motion
[49:09] oh my I'm not going to go and preach on
[49:12] every single one of these but hold back
[49:13] I mean you could just have a whole
[49:15] sermon around these list hold up impede
[49:18] inhibit interfere
[49:21] um
[49:22] okay this is an old word Monaco
[49:24] Monaco has anyone who heard Monaco
[49:26] before Oh my
[49:29] obstruct shackle
[49:31] short circuit we know what short
[49:33] circuits for power of God don't we
[49:35] selfishness
[49:37] oh my that's one thing that the devil
[49:39] can weigh us down with you wonders
[49:42] sometimes help me Lord stymie oh man
[49:45] there's a real British type of word
[49:46] isn't it stymie
[49:48] tie up and tremble oh my tremel sounds
[49:52] pretty
[49:54] um
[49:54] I don't even know the word for that but
[49:56] yeah anyway hey look in the Amplified
[49:58] version of Hebrews 12 1 it says this
[50:01] this is therefore since we are
[50:03] surrounded by so great a clout of
[50:05] witnesses who by faith have testified
[50:07] the truth to the truth of God's absolute
[50:10] faithfulness I love that his absolute
[50:14] faithfulness I mean that's powerful
[50:16] those two words his absolute
[50:19] faithfulness so you can have faith in an
[50:21] absolutely faithful God Anytime Anyplace
[50:24] and know that the word that's come and
[50:26] been released over the age
[50:29] it's going to bring the devil to a
[50:31] showdown and defeat him under any
[50:33] circumstance any place anywhere anytime
[50:36] that's the message that's been given
[50:38] over the age the full restoration of all
[50:40] truth delivered to the people why
[50:43] because he wants to prepare a bride he
[50:45] wants to clothe her in his wedding
[50:46] garments and this spiritual power and
[50:49] all those words that's been unveiled
[50:52] to the people
[50:54] stripping off every unnecessary and
[50:57] cumbering weight and the sin which does
[50:59] so easily and cleverly entangles us let
[51:02] us run with endurance and active
[51:04] persistence the race that is set before
[51:07] us in that word run comes in Greek text
[51:11] and commonly used it was considered a
[51:15] perilous
[51:17] exertion
[51:19] so it wasn't just some running you know
[51:22] the McDonald's fun run around Wellington
[51:24] this was a perilous exertion that
[51:27] required all your strengths
[51:31] have you ever been in a trial or been in
[51:33] something
[51:35] oh man I did Army Cadets and there was
[51:37] many times where it was perilous
[51:39] exertion because we were naughty so we
[51:41] got it even worse so you know we'd get
[51:44] whipped awake at four o'clock in the
[51:46] morning and run over gravel and bare
[51:48] feet and things like that
[51:50] that's what happens when you mischievous
[51:51] in the Army even Army Cadets and I'd
[51:53] hate to think what it was like in the
[51:54] army
[51:55] but you see there were things that we go
[51:58] through in life and we're called
[52:00] to a high calling of God that when we
[52:03] run if you the only way to actually run
[52:06] this race with patience of course is to
[52:09] be able to lay aside these things that
[52:12] God shows you in your life
[52:15] this is why we come to church
[52:17] this is why we read our Bible this is
[52:19] why we pray this is why we Fellowship
[52:22] you know it doesn't always have to be
[52:24] natural Fellowship it can be spiritual
[52:26] we can actually have a Faith Fellowship
[52:28] where God begins to discern our heart
[52:31] and fellowship
[52:33] you know that you could be chewing over
[52:34] what someone's preached or you could be
[52:36] just having a you know you're so moved
[52:37] sometimes there's just been a powerful
[52:39] presence of God and you start thinking
[52:41] differently in that thought time and you
[52:44] begin to Fellowship around a specific
[52:45] thought and then God will unlock that
[52:48] thing in your life why are you like you
[52:49] are and it's time to lay that aside
[52:51] Peter didn't stay sitting down when he
[52:53] was in the prison the angel of the Lord
[52:55] came to him knocked them on his side
[52:56] because there was people praying and he
[52:58] got knocked on his side and he got up
[53:01] and what you need to get up
[53:03] you need to run it's time to run if you
[53:07] don't get up the chains will stay on you
[53:09] you'll stay where you are but when you
[53:11] feel the pulsation of faith
[53:14] who knows what a pulsation of faith God
[53:16] just comes in a moment or he begins to
[53:19] strike something in your life and he
[53:20] speaks something and you see it stand
[53:22] and walk out of it
[53:24] do not hesitate
[53:27] because God wants to do something in
[53:29] your life and take you from to so you
[53:32] can advance yeah
[53:33] advancing
[53:34] because we're in a time now
[53:36] where our Advance is the devil's Denise
[53:40] there's no other Church ages there's no
[53:41] other dispensations or there is but
[53:43] they're not like this okay the church
[53:47] ages are coming to an end the Gentile
[53:48] dispensation is coming to an end the
[53:50] gospel's going back to the Jews soon
[53:52] it's all happening right there's a big
[53:53] change our Advance our children's
[53:56] Advanced children when you advance when
[53:58] you take things of your own that God has
[54:01] given you that brings the devil out
[54:04] it pulls him down from his position
[54:07] of Lies
[54:09] his position is CR is is created on
[54:12] lives I was listening to something today
[54:14] and they say that all these politicians
[54:18] of today a lot of them are so bad that
[54:21] they failed their way there and they
[54:23] still get given these positions because
[54:25] they're so useless that they are just a
[54:27] puppet but God doesn't want puppets
[54:30] he doesn't want usually on your failure
[54:33] he's actually looking for a people that
[54:35] will take
[54:36] inventory and just say Lord
[54:39] when you speak I will act
[54:42] Hallelujah so that we're no longer
[54:43] encumbered Hallelujah
[54:46] and there we are
[54:48] I want to read here from 1 Samuel 23 13.
[54:51] and
[54:52] I'm going to read something that's very
[54:54] very striking to me and I just want you
[54:56] to have I want to have your undivided
[54:58] attention and for you on the the
[55:01] streaming don't go and do other stuff
[55:03] while you're watching don't go iron your
[55:05] clothes or you know I know we've done it
[55:08] we all kind of do it sometimes but be
[55:10] serious In This Moment
[55:12] because God is Not subject to geography
[55:15] and so I want you to listen to these
[55:17] things it's not going to be long
[55:18] don't worry
[55:20] it's going to be short and sweet and
[55:22] hopefully by the Lord's Grace convicting
[55:25] and Powerful then David and his men
[55:27] which were about 600 arose and departed
[55:29] out of Kila this is around the time Saul
[55:31] was pursuing David now and whether so
[55:33] ever they could go and it was told Saul
[55:36] the old nature now that David which is
[55:39] the type of Christ in this particular
[55:41] sermon
[55:42] was escaped from Kila and he forbid to
[55:46] go forth and David Abode in the
[55:47] wilderness and strongholds and remained
[55:49] in a mountain in the wilderness of zif
[55:52] and Saul sought him every day you see as
[55:56] the time gets closer and closer your old
[55:59] nature teams up with the devil and seeks
[56:02] to pull you down every day but the good
[56:04] thing about that is the devil shows us
[56:07] cards so God has given the devil rope in
[56:10] this hour so that all the things that's
[56:12] hiding will come out so that they can be
[56:14] dealt with so do not run away from the
[56:17] battle do not desert your battleground
[56:19] don't be ashamed when you have failed
[56:21] because when you fail the devil will
[56:23] show his cards and he gets defeated and
[56:25] tonight if you're living in a failure
[56:27] why not let the devil show us cards and
[56:30] and let him be defeated
[56:31] but if you don't know and you don't fail
[56:33] and you don't do anything you don't
[56:34] abunk the devil just hides down in your
[56:36] life Saul doesn't get very upset but
[56:39] David was advancing you see David didn't
[56:41] just advance in Pride and try and take
[56:43] it all he just let God do it yeah you
[56:45] notice that
[56:47] he didn't do it himself he didn't have
[56:49] some massive bigger gender and trying to
[56:51] Rally no no he was just flowing with the
[56:53] spirit of God he never took the throne
[56:56] he let God do it but you can see that
[56:59] David as he Advanced his old nature now
[57:01] saw this troubled manfiering nature was
[57:05] beginning to to take him and try and
[57:08] seek him every day but just let the
[57:12] devil show his cards
[57:14] and when he does then it's time
[57:17] for battle
[57:19] and David saw that Saul was come out to
[57:22] seek his life and David was in the
[57:24] wilderness of zeph in a wood and
[57:26] Jonathan step in Jonathan now because
[57:29] he's one of the main themes of the
[57:31] sermon Saul's son arose and went to
[57:34] David into the wood and strengthened his
[57:37] hand
[57:38] sorry I was going to read that screen
[57:41] but it's I like reading this one
[57:43] and strengthened his hand where am I
[57:46] uh there in God and he said unto him
[57:50] fear not for the hand of Saul my father
[57:52] shall not find thee and thou shalt be
[57:54] king over Israel and I shall be next
[57:57] unto thee see there was a vision this is
[57:59] what they that Jonathan had in his heart
[58:01] and David was very much going to do this
[58:04] this was part of it right and or that
[58:07] also saw my father knows
[58:09] and they too made a covenant before the
[58:12] Lord It's very key they made a covenant
[58:15] before the Lord and David Abode in the
[58:17] wood and Jonathan went to his house
[58:23] on the gravest mistakes he ever made in
[58:25] his life actually probably the final
[58:27] mistake he ever made
[58:34] Jonathan
[58:37] a mighty man of Valor
[58:39] a man that had faith
[58:42] a man that did exploits a man that was
[58:44] so generous he gave all of his stuff to
[58:46] David
[58:47] a man that was faithful to the church
[58:51] so close
[58:54] so close
[58:56] Saturn David's meetings time after time
[59:00] so close
[59:02] yet
[59:03] so far
[59:05] likewise Luke 14 33 whosoever he be of
[59:10] you that forsaketh not all that he has
[59:13] he cannot be my disciple
[59:17] it's very serious
[59:19] this is real Christianity
[59:21] we're not on a picnic we're not just
[59:24] walking in the park we're not just
[59:26] having a good time
[59:27] I'm having a good time by the way I'm
[59:29] sure you all are having a good time but
[59:31] it's also a hard time it's also a battle
[59:33] it's also life and death
[59:37] and God is calling for disciples he's
[59:38] calling for people that are willing to
[59:40] lay everything down he's calling for a
[59:42] people that are willing to lay aside
[59:44] every weight
[59:47] and sometimes we get comfortable with
[59:48] the weights and it helps us to sit on
[59:51] the pure and we can't get up and even
[59:52] praise God
[59:53] never even stand to give the word of God
[59:56] a standing ovation just sit down
[59:58] and I'm not just trying to make you
[1:00:00] stand up I'm just saying that sometimes
[1:00:03] it's weights that hold us down because
[1:00:04] the word's not affecting us
[1:00:06] we're just so tied up with all these
[1:00:08] affections and everything in the world
[1:00:10] and all the stuff that's going on we're
[1:00:12] just so busy
[1:00:14] and therefore when we come to church the
[1:00:16] word is just information
[1:00:17] but it's time for a change if you want
[1:00:20] this word to Rapture you it's time to
[1:00:23] lay aside every weight and sin that does
[1:00:25] so cunningly surround every part of your
[1:00:28] life surrounding your conscience and
[1:00:30] affections and memories
[1:00:32] ah your reasoning even now right now the
[1:00:35] devil will be reasoning right now
[1:00:39] I can guarantee there's lots of little
[1:00:40] clouds of reasoning going on
[1:00:42] this is just how the devil works oh
[1:00:44] Andy's just getting carried away oh this
[1:00:46] and that he said this before he's
[1:00:47] preached that oh yes this is Andy you
[1:00:50] know but weird and crazy and
[1:00:53] don't just don't buy into that look past
[1:00:56] the silly preaching vessel because it's
[1:00:59] for the foolishness of preaching God
[1:01:01] chose to save Souls
[1:01:03] and so this we're in the last moments of
[1:01:06] the last days
[1:01:08] oh Lord help us
[1:01:10] Hallelujah
[1:01:11] this is these are the weights that
[1:01:13] Jonathan had to let go of
[1:01:15] social status
[1:01:16] natural safety
[1:01:19] financial support religious position
[1:01:23] his family his crown
[1:01:25] his Creature Comforts get to get rid of
[1:01:27] a lot of things right
[1:01:28] and see he loved David he was so on fire
[1:01:31] for David
[1:01:33] and yet
[1:01:34] he died and the soul is better he died
[1:01:39] under the banner of his old nature
[1:01:42] do not die under the banner of your soul
[1:01:46] do not stay under the banner of your
[1:01:49] selfish life
[1:01:50] it is time to lay it down because God is
[1:01:53] going to do great things in this church
[1:01:55] and your exploits are going to happen
[1:01:56] under the manifestation of the sons of
[1:01:58] God are you going to be part of it
[1:02:01] who is in
[1:02:03] it's time it's time to be in because God
[1:02:06] is calling us higher but to be called
[1:02:09] higher you need to be weightless
[1:02:11] Hallelujah
[1:02:13] I want to be weightless who wants to be
[1:02:15] weightless it's weightless free
[1:02:17] impervious to every attack of the devil
[1:02:20] that no matter whether he comes to your
[1:02:22] memories and he gives you a thousand
[1:02:23] memories
[1:02:24] or a thousand lusts or a thousand things
[1:02:27] on your conscience or your affections oh
[1:02:31] my
[1:02:32] doesn't penetrate because you're so full
[1:02:34] of love
[1:02:35] you know Noah's Ark in the wood that he
[1:02:38] used
[1:02:39] who's soft Acacia would
[1:02:42] and they probably looked at Noah and
[1:02:44] thought you're crazy man you're gonna
[1:02:45] build an arcade of the soft stuff we're
[1:02:47] going to saturate and sink to the bottom
[1:02:49] of the ocean
[1:02:50] no buoyance
[1:02:52] seeing I was so soft that when the pitch
[1:02:54] cam it made it perfect
[1:02:57] and that's the same thing for us if you
[1:03:00] just soften your heart so that God can
[1:03:03] fill you with oil
[1:03:05] we need oil give me oil Jesus father
[1:03:09] Hallelujah
[1:03:11] okay can I play this
[1:03:15] Jonathan
[1:03:17] why are we watching this
[1:03:18] some of you have probably seen
[1:03:20] children I want your attention now watch
[1:03:22] this thing
[1:03:23] I knew how to get the children's
[1:03:24] attention now they can
[1:03:26] see now watch this Jonathan was not
[1:03:30] willing even though he was he didn't do
[1:03:33] it so yes Jonathan was a great man did
[1:03:37] great things and we'll go further into
[1:03:38] Jonathan soon but he didn't let go of
[1:03:40] his King he didn't let go of his father
[1:03:44] he didn't let go stayed under the banner
[1:03:46] of Saw
[1:03:47] and so he held on to the thing that he
[1:03:51] died under
[1:03:52] now we don't want to hold on to things
[1:03:54] that we'll die under
[1:03:56] don't hold on to things that you don't
[1:03:58] need to hold on to
[1:04:00] don't hold on to it I think Ben preached
[1:04:02] it a few years ago don't be a protection
[1:04:04] for the devil
[1:04:06] don't be a Aid in bed at him I can't
[1:04:09] remember what he used they would use the
[1:04:10] word like a protection like a guard
[1:04:12] don't be a devil guard
[1:04:14] you know when you're holding things and
[1:04:16] you're too ashamed or you know you're
[1:04:19] too scared to
[1:04:20] get help
[1:04:23] it's time to let go you've been given
[1:04:25] the power to loose
[1:04:27] you know that's a power
[1:04:29] God can give you it's an anointing it's
[1:04:31] a power he gave the church the power to
[1:04:33] bind and to loose and there's things in
[1:04:36] our life that we need to let go
[1:04:38] so that we can go from the camp of Saw
[1:04:40] to the camp of David
[1:04:43] okay so I go to the next one
[1:04:45] that one and just click the button
[1:04:48] or do you want to click it
[1:04:51] sorry it's a very old video so
[1:04:58] please excuse the
[1:05:01] um
[1:05:02] the man isn't wearing very many clothes
[1:05:04] but
[1:05:05] I'm sure we can look past that
[1:05:07] it's very unclear
[1:05:11] is this sound
[1:05:14] just watch I don't think you need sound
[1:05:16] anyway
[1:05:56] you see if we hold
[1:05:58] on to the weights long enough
[1:06:04] it's going to get worse
[1:06:07] for us
[1:06:09] God is calling us to
[1:06:11] let go
[1:06:14] and let God
[1:06:20] this little guy here
[1:06:22] was not willing to let go
[1:06:24] and now he's been caught in the snare of
[1:06:27] the Fowler and the fowl has got him
[1:06:29] now he's trapped he will he can never
[1:06:32] get away
[1:06:35] we don't want to die under the banner of
[1:06:37] Saul
[1:06:41] we can go to the next video now
[1:06:43] there's two videos that was the monkey
[1:06:45] now this is the baboon
[1:06:48] his forebears have had thousands of
[1:06:50] years to adapt to the Kalahari so he
[1:06:53] needs very little liquid and he knows
[1:06:55] where to find it
[1:06:57] an insignificant looking dry twig tells
[1:06:59] him where to dig
[1:07:11] anyone else would die of thirst in a few
[1:07:13] days in this treacherous desert that
[1:07:16] doesn't look like a desert but he can
[1:07:18] survive for months on end
[1:07:23] he unearth the bulbous root which is
[1:07:25] really just a solid lump of wood with
[1:07:27] hard fibers that are merely damp
[1:07:29] civilized man would need some pretty
[1:07:31] complicated technology and Machinery to
[1:07:34] get water out of it but he uses the very
[1:07:37] simplest of tools
[1:07:39] his scraper is a stick that has been
[1:07:41] split to give it a sharp edge and he
[1:07:43] produces some dry looking shavings
[1:07:46] but you take a handful Point your thumb
[1:07:49] at your mouth squeeze very hard and wait
[1:07:52] for it
[1:08:00] the baboons always have a secret supply
[1:08:02] of water and they're not going to tell
[1:08:04] anybody where it is
[1:08:06] and when a Mahal ahadi Ventures into the
[1:08:08] deep Kalahari on a hunting trip he has
[1:08:11] to find water because unlike the Bushmen
[1:08:13] he doesn't know how to make liquid from
[1:08:15] a root but he has his own way of finding
[1:08:18] out where the water is
[1:08:19] first he laboriously drills a hole in a
[1:08:22] giant ant Heap when he is sure a baboon
[1:08:24] is watching him because he knows baboons
[1:08:26] are incurably inquisitive next he put
[1:08:29] some wild melon seeds into the hole and
[1:08:32] works them in so that they drop into a
[1:08:34] hollow
[1:08:34] then he saunters off knowing the baboon
[1:08:37] is burning with curiosity
[1:08:40] temptation
[1:08:42] that's how the devil lures the boom
[1:08:44] doesn't trust that women on every front
[1:08:46] so he plays it cool but he's dying to
[1:08:49] know what gives in that confounded hole
[1:08:55] finally Mr inquisitive can't take it any
[1:08:57] longer he's got to know what's in there
[1:09:04] he reaches in grabs A Fistful and now
[1:09:07] his hand's too big to come out
[1:09:12] he will not let it go so to drop the sea
[1:09:14] he could feel his hand
[1:09:24] now he let's go this is how the enemy
[1:09:26] works
[1:09:27] he lures he comes on every front to give
[1:09:30] us these invitations and things all
[1:09:32] around us to lure Us in and then we end
[1:09:35] up holding on to things or we've had
[1:09:36] things that we've been brought up with
[1:09:38] and then as we become Sanctified as God
[1:09:40] begins to work in our life then we start
[1:09:42] to see oh wow that's actually not good
[1:09:44] yeah these things in my life aren't
[1:09:46] actually good you know and you start to
[1:09:47] see an image before you now God doesn't
[1:09:49] just force you you know maybe back in a
[1:09:52] legalistic hour that you would have been
[1:09:54] forced to conform and then you live with
[1:09:55] those things but you're just on the
[1:09:57] outside you look good on the inside
[1:09:59] you're still a ravening wolf you know
[1:10:01] and and they but it's that ravening wolf
[1:10:03] nature that the Lord and his Mercy in
[1:10:06] this hour give the devil enough rope to
[1:10:08] hang himself so the devil's been given
[1:10:11] enough rope to hang himself now I want
[1:10:13] to zoom right out onto an age level as
[1:10:17] we know everybody here I'm sure you know
[1:10:20] that in the 1940s and 30s and that that
[1:10:23] the devil was given the key to the
[1:10:24] bottomless pit and he all the smoke came
[1:10:26] out and all the sciences and everything
[1:10:28] became so tree of knowledge based right
[1:10:31] and and he was given the key to the
[1:10:33] bottomless pit and smoke came out hell
[1:10:35] came on the earth why and I asked this
[1:10:38] question and it was showing me because
[1:10:40] the devil needed to be exposed he was
[1:10:43] hiding down in hell and he was aloof and
[1:10:45] Elusive and and and and and he needed to
[1:10:48] come out because he needed to get dealt
[1:10:50] with that's why he's been given the key
[1:10:53] to come out of the closet
[1:10:55] to come out of hiding and he's been
[1:10:57] given a rampage key and he's got
[1:10:59] sciences and televisions and movies and
[1:11:01] music all from Hollywood and all
[1:11:03] California and Rome and all those things
[1:11:05] right everything all the conspiracies
[1:11:07] and a lot of the mature and some of them
[1:11:08] are just a bit extreme but they're all
[1:11:10] there and there's things going on and
[1:11:12] the devil's exposed
[1:11:14] so you can be very very happy that the
[1:11:18] devil's exposed out there but now let's
[1:11:20] make it personal because it's a personal
[1:11:23] thing too because that exposure and that
[1:11:25] how the Lord has allowed the devil all
[1:11:26] all this license in this end time so
[1:11:30] that he can be exposed out there but
[1:11:32] also so that you can go through
[1:11:34] temptations that will try and get you to
[1:11:36] hold on to things and try and get you
[1:11:37] why because God wants to purify you God
[1:11:40] wants to change you God wants to give
[1:11:43] you character God wants to prepare you
[1:11:45] for the millennial Reign he wants to
[1:11:47] prepare you for a Rapture he wants to
[1:11:49] take you through a character that you
[1:11:51] will spend eternity with
[1:11:52] just think about that he's developing a
[1:11:55] character in your life for your eternal
[1:11:58] personality wow
[1:12:01] so if you think oh it's hard yes it's
[1:12:03] hard but there's a reason and in
[1:12:06] eternity you'll be so thankful that you
[1:12:08] went through all these things because
[1:12:09] that's going to be your personality and
[1:12:11] your character
[1:12:12] Hallelujah Jonathan a great church
[1:12:15] member but he was a man of faith and
[1:12:19] Valor
[1:12:20] he did great things man you can look at
[1:12:23] the life of Jonathan and say this was a
[1:12:25] model believer and he was a model
[1:12:27] believer but but for the sake of this
[1:12:31] particular thought I want you to see
[1:12:32] Jonathan as the most great moral
[1:12:35] believer but the the very thing that he
[1:12:38] needed to do he didn't actually follow
[1:12:40] through
[1:12:41] he stayed he went back to his house
[1:12:45] at that moment to me he should have run
[1:12:47] with David
[1:12:49] and I'll show you someone that did so
[1:12:51] and I believe that it's time to run to
[1:12:53] David David is Christ David is our Lord
[1:12:55] Jesus Christ he's the one that's
[1:12:57] anointed to bring forth everything
[1:12:58] that's promised to us don't you think
[1:13:01] that window there was benefits to be
[1:13:02] part of David's camp
[1:13:04] they came under greater grading things
[1:13:05] it was amazing they had Adventures who
[1:13:08] liked Adventures who liked an
[1:13:10] adventurous life
[1:13:11] who likes a life full of of Life and
[1:13:14] Adventures and change and and good
[1:13:16] things
[1:13:17] except you know wildly unexpected
[1:13:20] amazing experiences
[1:13:22] this is what Christianity is it's not
[1:13:25] boring just sitting in church listening
[1:13:26] to sermons that's the greatest life
[1:13:29] when you truly lay aside every weight
[1:13:31] and God can cause you to fly who wants
[1:13:33] to fly
[1:13:34] spiritual flying you know you can
[1:13:37] spiritually fly because you've got an
[1:13:38] eagle anointing we're in the age where
[1:13:40] the Lord's poured out the eagle
[1:13:41] anointing and it's not just an eagles on
[1:13:43] the ground it's a flying needle so you
[1:13:46] can fly hi
[1:13:48] Hallelujah man of Faith about he was a
[1:13:50] man of faith in Bella he had a
[1:13:52] supernatural testimony you know when he
[1:13:54] took uh his armor Bearer and they went
[1:13:55] up and they defeated all of the
[1:13:57] ammonites and they said if we go if they
[1:14:00] call us up we'll go up right who knows
[1:14:02] the story and the God will deliver if
[1:14:04] they say don't go if they don't call us
[1:14:05] up then God won't Deliver us we'd stay
[1:14:07] and they called them up and they
[1:14:09] delivered he had a supernatural
[1:14:11] testimony he had a covenant with David
[1:14:13] before the Lord
[1:14:15] he had he was friends with David
[1:14:18] we can be a great friend to the Lord
[1:14:21] but Judas was a friend to the Lord God
[1:14:23] caught Jesus called him friend he called
[1:14:25] the rich General a friend
[1:14:28] he called him these titles what a great
[1:14:30] title
[1:14:31] but it's got to be more than that
[1:14:33] he wants your friendship
[1:14:35] he wants you to come under his Covenant
[1:14:37] he wants you to really the only way to
[1:14:38] truly come under his Covenant is the
[1:14:40] very thing that Jonathan didn't do was
[1:14:42] David he didn't give up everything
[1:14:45] he wasn't willing to give up his family
[1:14:46] his life everything all his Ambitions
[1:14:49] dreams he would have been you know since
[1:14:51] he was a boy he would have had great
[1:14:53] Ambitions and he would have been the
[1:14:55] King's son he's going to be the king one
[1:14:56] day and he would have had story times
[1:14:58] and Bedtime Stories and all those things
[1:15:00] so he had this great thing and he had to
[1:15:02] give all that up and we've got the best
[1:15:04] things that we have to give up to
[1:15:05] there's Ambitions that we have to give
[1:15:07] up there's all this background that we
[1:15:09] need to give up but see Jonathan even
[1:15:11] that with it all he was willing to
[1:15:13] surrender his throne yeah yeah in
[1:15:15] agreement
[1:15:16] resistant to Saul's rash leadership you
[1:15:19] know you can sit here and you can be in
[1:15:21] a Pew and you can be resistant to your
[1:15:24] old nature you can be resistant to the
[1:15:26] rash leadership of your old nature and
[1:15:29] still be holding on to it still be under
[1:15:31] its Banner but you're resisting and
[1:15:33] you're just resisting it and I call that
[1:15:34] it's like a pharisaic religion where
[1:15:37] you're just a Pharisee over your old
[1:15:38] nature and you're just trying to push it
[1:15:40] down and and really all you need to do
[1:15:42] is totally surrender everything so that
[1:15:46] God can give you a new birth
[1:15:48] faithful and honest he was amen and
[1:15:51] extremely generous
[1:15:53] oh my how many people sit in a Pew in an
[1:15:57] extremely gym
[1:15:58] give
[1:16:00] all over the Christendom
[1:16:02] give and give their lives
[1:16:04] servants
[1:16:05] and yet
[1:16:06] it's their life
[1:16:08] that's their time
[1:16:10] and outside of church it's all about
[1:16:12] them
[1:16:13] it's all about what they want to do
[1:16:15] and if they're not feeling very well
[1:16:16] they don't come
[1:16:17] what about turning up to the to The Fray
[1:16:20] even when you don't want to oh my Lord
[1:16:22] help me
[1:16:23] amen faithful and honest
[1:16:26] see all these things are great
[1:16:27] characteristics actually they really do
[1:16:31] bring
[1:16:32] the very description of a real believer
[1:16:34] right this is a real believer this is
[1:16:37] someone that's got a real believer but
[1:16:39] yet even with all those things Paul said
[1:16:41] though I
[1:16:43] um have all these things though I preach
[1:16:46] the gospel to the whole world and though
[1:16:47] I give my life to be burnt and though I
[1:16:49] know all the Mysteries and have great
[1:16:52] charity work
[1:16:53] unless I have charity which is the Holy
[1:16:56] Ghost God's perfect love in my heart I'm
[1:16:59] nothing right
[1:17:01] so you can have all of this great stuff
[1:17:03] and have the idea of coming in an
[1:17:06] intellectual Covenant you see Jonathan
[1:17:07] made that Covenant with David but did it
[1:17:10] happen
[1:17:11] did it actually happen
[1:17:13] no
[1:17:15] that Covenant didn't actually transpire
[1:17:17] it didn't take place and they made it
[1:17:19] before the Lord they were all sincere
[1:17:21] but the very thing that he needed to do
[1:17:23] was to jump ship he needed to know when
[1:17:26] to run because death was in the camp
[1:17:28] that he was in and death is in the camp
[1:17:30] of your old nature demise is in the camp
[1:17:32] of your old nature way down to a natural
[1:17:36] experiences in the camp of your old
[1:17:38] nature but it's time to know when to run
[1:17:41] children it's time to know when to run
[1:17:43] to go from being a Pew warmer to a soul
[1:17:46] winner
[1:17:47] hallelujah how many Souls have you guys
[1:17:50] has anyone won a soul to Christ since
[1:17:53] you've spent years and years as a
[1:17:55] Christian how many Souls have you won
[1:17:58] just asking
[1:18:00] you should know
[1:18:02] and I'm not saying you haven't I'm just
[1:18:03] saying how many
[1:18:05] is there a desire in your heart or are
[1:18:07] you comfortable
[1:18:09] you don't want to cause and a shame
[1:18:11] you don't want to make someone
[1:18:12] uncomfortable
[1:18:15] what about when they go to hell they're
[1:18:17] going to be uncomfortable
[1:18:21] where to
[1:18:22] used to being comfortable
[1:18:24] we're too used to being extremely
[1:18:26] generous in church faithful and honest
[1:18:28] resistant to rash leadership and rash
[1:18:30] old nature and willing to surrender
[1:18:32] everything well all these things but
[1:18:34] what about dying for yourself
[1:18:36] what about leaving the camp what about
[1:18:38] knowing when you should run
[1:18:41] run out
[1:18:42] change
[1:18:46] Lord help me make sense
[1:18:48] oh there's another man
[1:18:51] and this is a very this is a tragic
[1:18:53] story and yet he knew it around who
[1:18:56] knows the story of a Bible
[1:18:58] well I don't know how you say his name
[1:19:01] he was a priest he actually became a
[1:19:04] successful priest
[1:19:06] he was probably a nobody before this
[1:19:08] but there's a great event that took
[1:19:10] place
[1:19:10] in the pursuit
[1:19:12] in Souls rash crazy pursuit to kill
[1:19:18] David
[1:19:19] 's whole family was killed
[1:19:22] his parents his cousins every baby every
[1:19:25] mother
[1:19:28] and he would have been too
[1:19:30] but he knew
[1:19:32] to run
[1:19:33] do you know when to run
[1:19:35] those of you run for your life
[1:19:39] it's time to run for your life from the
[1:19:43] soul that will take you to hell
[1:19:47] and if your if it doesn't take you to
[1:19:49] Hell it'll make it hell on Earth for you
[1:19:51] and Hell on Earth for those around you
[1:19:52] because you'll be up and down and
[1:19:55] subject to Saul
[1:19:56] but it's time to run from that Soul
[1:20:00] nature
[1:20:01] it's time to know because that Soul's
[1:20:04] coming for you he's coming for your
[1:20:06] family and he will cause them great ruin
[1:20:11] unless you run to the camp of David
[1:20:16] and the King said Thou shalt surely die
[1:20:18] Obama abimelech is dead
[1:20:22] and he was the king so the priest that
[1:20:25] David came to real quick and he got
[1:20:27] Goliath sword over him and gave him the
[1:20:28] bread and he didn't really know that
[1:20:31] David was a future to his old nature to
[1:20:34] Seoul
[1:20:35] you see there was a changeover of
[1:20:38] kingship there was a change over
[1:20:40] of dispensation in Israel from a king
[1:20:43] who feared man from an old nature that
[1:20:46] was a man-faring complex nature That
[1:20:48] Couldn't truly obey the Lord that would
[1:20:51] just go so far you see Saul was a man of
[1:20:53] great works he did battles that said
[1:20:55] that the war was sore against the
[1:20:57] Philistines all the days of Saul he
[1:21:00] wasn't lazy he had a vision he was a he
[1:21:03] was a king that had the idea we must
[1:21:05] fight all the time so he wasn't just a
[1:21:07] useless King except he had a nature That
[1:21:10] Couldn't truly obey God he was complex
[1:21:13] and he feared what people thought
[1:21:16] and it was his great demise and yet a
[1:21:19] him a look sorry he was the king that
[1:21:22] David came to
[1:21:24] and now he didn't realize how grave
[1:21:26] Danger
[1:21:27] he was in
[1:21:30] and this is very much like it for some
[1:21:32] of us
[1:21:33] and the King said Thou shalt surely die
[1:21:35] a himelect vow in all thy father's house
[1:21:37] and the King said unto the footman that
[1:21:39] stood about him turn and slay the priest
[1:21:42] of the Lord because their hand also is
[1:21:44] with David and because they knew when he
[1:21:47] fled and did not show it to me but the
[1:21:49] Servants of the king would not put forth
[1:21:51] their hand to fall upon the priests of
[1:21:53] the Lord and the King said to doing Turn
[1:21:56] thou and fall upon the priest and don't
[1:21:58] be ignite Edomite turned and he fell
[1:22:01] upon the priest and slew on that day 85
[1:22:04] people that did wear the linen ephod so
[1:22:06] 85 priests and one of the sons of a
[1:22:09] himalayk did I just skip something uh uh
[1:22:12] no and one of the sons of a himalayk the
[1:22:14] son of ahitab named abayatha escaped and
[1:22:17] fled after David that's the very thing
[1:22:20] that we need to do and if you are not in
[1:22:23] David's Camp if you're not in his
[1:22:25] Safeguard it's time to flee it's time to
[1:22:28] run from Seoul and I'm not saying that
[1:22:31] you need a run from the devil you need
[1:22:33] to fight the devil but you need to run
[1:22:35] from the camp that's holding you down
[1:22:38] you need to lay aside the weights that
[1:22:40] does so easily beset you so that you can
[1:22:43] be free to worship like it was
[1:22:46] in the time of David a buyer that
[1:22:49] escaped and fled after David and abias
[1:22:51] that showed David that Saul had slammed
[1:22:53] the Lord's priests and David said unto a
[1:22:55] biother I knew it that day when dying
[1:22:57] the Edomite was there that he would
[1:22:59] surely tell Saul I have occasioned the
[1:23:01] death of all the persons of thy Father's
[1:23:03] House abide that with me
[1:23:06] fear not
[1:23:09] for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy
[1:23:12] life
[1:23:13] but with me
[1:23:16] Thou shalt be kept
[1:23:18] in safeguard
[1:23:21] let me read that again
[1:23:23] but with me Jesus Christ
[1:23:26] Thou shalt be kept
[1:23:28] in safeguard
[1:23:32] Hallelujah
[1:23:37] he that findeth his life
[1:23:40] shall lose it
[1:23:42] and he that loseth his life for my sake
[1:23:47] a buyer that lost everything
[1:23:49] he lost his whole family he lost
[1:23:52] everything and that type is a very
[1:23:54] drastic example
[1:23:56] of how much you need to completely
[1:24:00] forsake the opinions of your whole
[1:24:02] family completely forsake the opinions
[1:24:05] of your school friends completely
[1:24:07] forsake the opinions of your own old
[1:24:08] nature Soul that's trying to kill you
[1:24:11] right now in this place you can receive
[1:24:13] the Holy Ghost right now in this place
[1:24:15] you can receive the new birth
[1:24:17] if you are willing to be like a biother
[1:24:19] and escape the camp
[1:24:22] Flee for Your Life to the camp of David
[1:24:25] and thou shalt be kept in Safeguard and
[1:24:28] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:24:30] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:24:32] sin and that you shall receive the gift
[1:24:35] of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:38] flee why there is time flee why there is
[1:24:42] an opportunity because there is an
[1:24:44] opportunity God is full of opportunities
[1:24:46] the word is full of opportunities church
[1:24:49] is full of opportunities the Bible is
[1:24:51] full of opportunity
[1:24:54] but are you willing
[1:24:56] to flee to the camp of David
[1:25:00] or are you going to find your life
[1:25:04] and keep your life
[1:25:08] or are you willing
[1:25:10] to lose your life
[1:25:12] lose your social status
[1:25:15] lose your friends
[1:25:16] lose your reputation be thought of as a
[1:25:20] cult following
[1:25:21] weirdo are you willing
[1:25:25] all the disciples were willing to be
[1:25:26] called cult followers even Paul was
[1:25:28] called a heretic by religious people all
[1:25:31] the denominations all the denominations
[1:25:34] called Paul a cult following heretic
[1:25:37] are you willing today
[1:25:40] are you willing to suffer the reproach
[1:25:42] or will you stay under the banner like
[1:25:45] Jonathan did
[1:25:47] can you just imagine
[1:25:48] a good man
[1:25:50] a man with a great testimony a man that
[1:25:53] loved David more than the love of woman
[1:25:55] do you know that
[1:25:57] not homosexual
[1:26:00] no
[1:26:01] it's a love that this society's lost
[1:26:04] real friendships and I need the Lord to
[1:26:07] help me have real friendships
[1:26:09] because the Bible said that the love of
[1:26:11] many shall disappear because of iniquity
[1:26:15] and so the society has actually got no
[1:26:17] real love
[1:26:20] Jonathan had love and David had such a
[1:26:23] love for each other
[1:26:26] as the young ones today are called BFF
[1:26:29] BFF
[1:26:31] but ebf extremely best friend forever
[1:26:36] just so high in best friend BFF
[1:26:40] and yet he died
[1:26:42] under sore
[1:26:44] let's not sit in a church
[1:26:47] and stay in the camp of our old nature
[1:26:51] don't sit
[1:26:53] in your own life
[1:26:55] it's time to lose your life
[1:26:59] so that you can
[1:27:02] rule life
[1:27:06] when I was
[1:27:08] in prison
[1:27:09] I've just got a couple of testimonies
[1:27:11] and then we'll close
[1:27:13] when I was in prison
[1:27:16] don't look at that problem
[1:27:18] you're coming up
[1:27:19] [Laughter]
[1:27:21] sorry when I was in prison
[1:27:25] the Lord came to me and I'm in a real
[1:27:28] prison now not just a spiritual prison
[1:27:30] but he's come to me in spiritual prison
[1:27:32] too but this is really prison 15 years
[1:27:35] 12 years ago whatever it was through oh
[1:27:37] however long it was 20 2006. so
[1:27:42] and I was in prison and
[1:27:44] you know the Lord came my way and I
[1:27:46] began to believe
[1:27:47] I started reading the Bible and I read
[1:27:49] testimonies I read brother Brandon's
[1:27:50] testimony and the supernatural books and
[1:27:52] you know that really opened my eyes to I
[1:27:55] was an atheist before that
[1:27:57] and I had plans to become an
[1:27:59] international drug lord
[1:28:01] I don't know some of you may know that
[1:28:03] but I and I wasn't just joking I was
[1:28:05] there I had all the recipes I had all
[1:28:08] the Syndicate all of the the leaders the
[1:28:11] importers from around the world we were
[1:28:12] doing it
[1:28:14] but God had other plans
[1:28:18] but still
[1:28:20] I gave I I went through the process of
[1:28:23] sinner's prayer and I gave my life my
[1:28:26] heart to the Lord but I did I knew that
[1:28:30] if I surrendered my whole life I would
[1:28:32] lose the desire
[1:28:35] if I I knew somehow and I couldn't
[1:28:38] explain it I couldn't put it to words
[1:28:40] only in hindsight there's 20 20 Vision
[1:28:42] right it's always 20 20 Vision when you
[1:28:45] look back
[1:28:46] if you've got the Lord now
[1:28:50] so I was scared of losing my identity I
[1:28:53] wasn't willing to give my identity to
[1:28:56] the Lord and because of that when I got
[1:28:59] out of prison
[1:29:00] sure enough
[1:29:01] I had my hand in the jar
[1:29:05] and I was holding on to a few little
[1:29:07] melon seeds
[1:29:10] a few melon seeds and I would not let
[1:29:14] them go those were weights that held me
[1:29:17] down when I got out of prison I got back
[1:29:18] into drugs I did drugs again but the
[1:29:22] grace of God
[1:29:23] amen brought me to the bottom I was The
[1:29:27] Prodigal Son
[1:29:29] my I was really The Prodigal Son and
[1:29:33] worse because I wasn't even allowed to
[1:29:35] eat the pig's food I was like under the
[1:29:37] foundation of the pigs pigsty
[1:29:40] I got pushed out of the world I got
[1:29:43] pushed out of drug Rings didn't even
[1:29:45] want me there
[1:29:46] and all the people you know it was just
[1:29:48] it was just it was Unreal
[1:29:51] before I went to prison I went up the
[1:29:53] drug rings when when I got out of prison
[1:29:56] I started off where I kind of where I
[1:29:58] was but it was all changed the
[1:30:00] topography and all the social politics
[1:30:02] and there was a lot in prison and but I
[1:30:04] still kind of knew had enough
[1:30:06] connections to get somewhere and I would
[1:30:09] go and sit in those circles and then I
[1:30:10] went but I slowly went
[1:30:12] down to nothing and no one wanted me
[1:30:15] around it was crazy apart from my
[1:30:17] closest of friends or acquaintances
[1:30:22] and
[1:30:24] it was just so crazy
[1:30:25] but God and His Mercy brought me to a
[1:30:28] place where I was willing to surrender
[1:30:30] my identity and I tell you what much to
[1:30:33] my own I could say shame because some of
[1:30:36] you will give your life to God sitting
[1:30:38] in an amazing service and that's amazing
[1:30:42] amazing because you have a love for God
[1:30:45] enough to give your life to him without
[1:30:47] him forcing you almost he will never
[1:30:49] Force you see it was all my choices but
[1:30:51] somehow through my choices and God's
[1:30:54] predestined amazing plan of Amazing
[1:30:57] Grace got me to a place where I must
[1:31:00] give my identity I had nothing left I
[1:31:02] had no idea oh man I didn't even have an
[1:31:05] identity left it was gone
[1:31:07] he stripped it away through my own
[1:31:10] stupid actions
[1:31:14] isn't it amazing the balance of our Free
[1:31:17] Will and God's predestined plan
[1:31:20] the balance such a fine line
[1:31:23] and you think wow my identity was
[1:31:26] stripped away
[1:31:28] and I got down I told my friends I said
[1:31:30] you know what I'm not coming out tonight
[1:31:33] and it got to a point where no one was
[1:31:35] even ringing me and all the stuff it was
[1:31:36] really and it was just something else
[1:31:39] and I went and I told them and they were
[1:31:42] like ah whatever you'll be out you know
[1:31:44] and I didn't
[1:31:45] go out
[1:31:46] I wasn't out I was addicted to social
[1:31:48] always out every night drinking taking
[1:31:52] drugs partying all those things every
[1:31:54] night
[1:31:55] without fail couldn't stop it
[1:31:57] and then I said no
[1:31:59] something changed open my bible and said
[1:32:02] touch not the unclean things and I will
[1:32:05] receive you and something spoke to me
[1:32:07] said even when you're in prison and you
[1:32:09] had all those experiences with me I
[1:32:10] hadn't received you yet
[1:32:12] wow because you didn't give your
[1:32:13] identity to me wow wow you were still
[1:32:15] holding that thing
[1:32:16] and that very thing was me holding my
[1:32:19] hand in the jar yeah and then the Fowler
[1:32:21] got me if you want the Fowler to stop
[1:32:23] getting you you need to let go
[1:32:25] of those weights that are besetting you
[1:32:27] that Spirit of unbelief that's holding
[1:32:29] you back
[1:32:30] listening to what other people are
[1:32:31] telling you about God and how it's not
[1:32:33] true and all these different things it
[1:32:34] is true
[1:32:35] it's just a spirit of unbelief but I
[1:32:37] tell you what you may think that that
[1:32:39] Spirit of unbelief that you can't get
[1:32:41] out of is impenetrable but let me tell
[1:32:44] you I'm a champion let me tell you of
[1:32:46] someone that conquered that atmosphere
[1:32:48] let me tell you somebody that made a way
[1:32:50] Hallelujah through the atmosphere of
[1:32:53] unbelief through the atmosphere of sin
[1:32:54] and created a ladder that you can climb
[1:32:58] and you will see the Angels descending
[1:33:00] and ascending upon and that is the
[1:33:02] Jacob's Ladder that is the latter the
[1:33:05] ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:33:07] in your life he is the champion that
[1:33:10] made a way for you
[1:33:12] and you may think oh my how can I ever
[1:33:14] get out of it let me tell you that there
[1:33:16] is a way there is Deliverance if you
[1:33:19] just lay that thing aside and say I lose
[1:33:22] this unbelief in the name of Jesus
[1:33:24] Christ I want an exciting life I want a
[1:33:27] life full of Adventure I want a life and
[1:33:29] safety I want a life of enjoyment I want
[1:33:32] a life of Joy I want a life of fun I
[1:33:35] want a real life
[1:33:36] you can't really live until you were
[1:33:40] born again
[1:33:41] you can't you can't even think properly
[1:33:44] or you're born again
[1:33:45] you don't even have vision
[1:33:48] your whole vision is looking through the
[1:33:49] lens of
[1:33:52] sore until you're born again
[1:33:54] but let me tell you
[1:33:55] that even if you are born again
[1:33:58] don't think you're exempt from this
[1:33:59] service because you need to still move
[1:34:01] on more
[1:34:04] tell you even the born again even myself
[1:34:06] I'm preaching to me
[1:34:08] well he is
[1:34:10] he just tells him what to say and I say
[1:34:12] it
[1:34:12] isn't that how it works you just be
[1:34:15] obedient to the Lord
[1:34:16] so
[1:34:19] let me just I'm never going to get past
[1:34:21] this so let me just
[1:34:25] my identity
[1:34:27] was completely surrendered
[1:34:29] the night
[1:34:30] that I laid down
[1:34:32] I went down on the end of my bed
[1:34:34] and I you know it doesn't have to be a
[1:34:37] big
[1:34:38] show yeah
[1:34:40] it can be it can be a camp thing it can
[1:34:42] be prophecies over you and all sorts of
[1:34:44] amazing things that I'm that's amazing
[1:34:46] praise God in some of us we we're all
[1:34:49] born in different ways some is in a nice
[1:34:50] pink hospital and some is messy down in
[1:34:54] a pig pen some is in church some is
[1:34:57] wherever it may be right some's in a
[1:35:00] shed
[1:35:00] wherever it is but as long as you get
[1:35:03] saved amen so I get down on my bed and
[1:35:08] now I pray
[1:35:10] and this prayer was a different prayer
[1:35:12] this prayer I knelt down on the end of
[1:35:15] my bed and I said Lord take the world
[1:35:16] out of my life
[1:35:18] I don't want it anymore
[1:35:20] deliver me from alcohol drugs social
[1:35:23] addictions
[1:35:24] all these addictions that I had
[1:35:26] methamphetamine addictions and ecstasy
[1:35:29] addictions
[1:35:31] all of it
[1:35:32] and guess I don't say guess what but the
[1:35:34] Lord delivered me of all of those things
[1:35:37] so yes I lost my reputation with all
[1:35:40] those friends yes they thought that I
[1:35:41] was crazy I lost friends I lost
[1:35:43] reputation but I also lost anxiety I
[1:35:46] lost fear I lost I lost death I lost all
[1:35:51] those things
[1:35:52] Hallelujah
[1:35:54] and so a few years later
[1:35:57] no maybe a year later I met Broman and
[1:36:00] bronman now was coming in from
[1:36:03] um the Realms of the charismatic
[1:36:06] Pentecostal
[1:36:08] and then further back Dutch reform
[1:36:10] reform Presbyterian and open Brethren so
[1:36:12] she had gone through a different
[1:36:14] you know you could say she kind of
[1:36:16] evolved through denominational Evolution
[1:36:20] you could say as it unfolded even over
[1:36:22] time she kind of went through that and
[1:36:24] then she met me and then I began to talk
[1:36:26] to her about things that are in the word
[1:36:28] that aren't even observed in churches
[1:36:30] anymore
[1:36:31] because they're considered old-fashioned
[1:36:32] and so I started talking to her about
[1:36:34] clothing
[1:36:35] now see Brahman had an identity
[1:36:37] and a real believer
[1:36:39] you know she had an experience with God
[1:36:42] um and God dealing in her life and all
[1:36:45] amazing testimony
[1:36:46] like Jonathan
[1:36:48] now it came to the crunch time was
[1:36:52] Bronwyn willing to sacrifice her
[1:36:54] identity
[1:36:55] to receive a true identity
[1:36:58] it's like Esther when Esther walked into
[1:37:01] the harem
[1:37:02] she had walked in with an identity
[1:37:04] but here guy came and delivered her a
[1:37:08] new identity was Esther willing to take
[1:37:11] here guys revelation
[1:37:14] of the king's Identity or would Esther
[1:37:17] stay and use her own imagination and
[1:37:20] affection
[1:37:21] to create her own identity and what she
[1:37:23] thinks the king would like and all those
[1:37:25] women in the Harem did the same thing
[1:37:27] right apart from Esther now Bronwyn was
[1:37:29] right there in the same situation and
[1:37:32] now I begin to talk to her about
[1:37:33] clothing and hair and makeup you know
[1:37:35] the usual kind of things but
[1:37:38] yeah
[1:37:40] God just did amazing because as you know
[1:37:43] because she was willing and she was
[1:37:45] sincere when we talked about here you
[1:37:48] know in Brahman she read in one
[1:37:49] Corinthians 11 that a woman's hair was
[1:37:52] her glory yes it's true right and so you
[1:37:54] know what she did she got hairdresser
[1:37:56] real good spent hundreds of dollars on
[1:37:58] beautiful haircuts and dieted and it was
[1:38:01] her glory right obviously when I met her
[1:38:03] she had the braids and then it had
[1:38:05] dreaded so that was also but you know to
[1:38:07] her it was her glory was that you make
[1:38:09] it beautiful
[1:38:11] right and so she'd had that and here I
[1:38:14] come to her and say actually your glory
[1:38:16] is here that never gets touched with a
[1:38:18] razor
[1:38:20] and if you actually look they've taken
[1:38:21] out of most of the concordances now
[1:38:23] because of the politics behind it but
[1:38:26] there's one left that actually tells you
[1:38:27] the true meaning of that word have long
[1:38:29] hair and it means to let it grow so that
[1:38:33] out of your head comes your hair
[1:38:36] fingerprint right your identity that God
[1:38:39] gave you so here is hair guy now
[1:38:41] clothing Esther and so and Now esther is
[1:38:44] Brahman is now willing for God to show
[1:38:47] her so she's like you know she just come
[1:38:49] back from missionary work in Mozambique
[1:38:50] seeing all the knees right and she's
[1:38:53] like now there's this guy now who she
[1:38:54] liked yeah
[1:38:56] so we had a bit of thing going there and
[1:38:58] I was telling you now so here's this guy
[1:39:00] now saying that God was actually
[1:39:01] concerned about your hair
[1:39:03] she's like what on Earth hey like
[1:39:06] literally like this is just like are you
[1:39:08] crazy and almost but respectfully but
[1:39:10] you know like really after all of us
[1:39:13] need and we're gonna go preach the
[1:39:14] gospel to every nation and you're
[1:39:16] talking about my hair okay
[1:39:18] but I said what if we pray
[1:39:22] are you willing to let it go or are you
[1:39:24] going to hold those melon seeds
[1:39:26] and she was willing to let it go and God
[1:39:27] knows your heart if you are really
[1:39:29] willing really really really willing God
[1:39:32] will take you at your word and he will
[1:39:34] then prove his word in your life he will
[1:39:36] change you he will do whatever is
[1:39:37] necessary
[1:39:39] and so you know what we prayed and God
[1:39:41] showed Brahman a vision and in the
[1:39:43] vision straight away
[1:39:45] in the vision there was a beautiful
[1:39:46] banquet room all beautiful laid out
[1:39:50] table banquet table and Chateau type of
[1:39:53] stuff beautiful and and it and everyone
[1:39:57] the attention was meant to be on the
[1:39:59] bride and the bridegroom I think but
[1:40:01] anyway instead a cockroach completely
[1:40:06] contrasting to the beautiful white
[1:40:07] scenery
[1:40:10] and she started crying she said oh Lord
[1:40:14] even the tiniest little thing
[1:40:17] can take the attention
[1:40:19] off the main Act
[1:40:21] and and the Lord showed her that yes God
[1:40:25] was actually concerned about small
[1:40:26] things
[1:40:27] and details so we talked about that the
[1:40:30] dress
[1:40:31] so clothing
[1:40:33] you know as you know you I you know if
[1:40:36] you treat it go into Pentecostal circles
[1:40:38] and any almost any denomination now
[1:40:42] um the woman uh Dressed sexy right so
[1:40:45] there's that they're connected to the
[1:40:46] the god of fashion and they flow with
[1:40:49] Hollywood they flow with the God of this
[1:40:53] evil age and the fashion spirit is so
[1:40:56] strong that the woman of the church flow
[1:40:59] with it in many cases there's obviously
[1:41:01] cases where they make individual
[1:41:03] decisions but as a general
[1:41:04] view they follow that and therefore they
[1:41:07] dress whatever they want right so
[1:41:08] Brahman was the same I met her she was
[1:41:10] wearing shorts up to hair and singlets
[1:41:13] and all that and I had to look past
[1:41:15] these things right because sometimes
[1:41:16] sons of God well sons and daughters have
[1:41:18] got a lit by the spirit of God and so
[1:41:20] now bronman starts telling me his story
[1:41:22] now now we weren't what in this time we
[1:41:25] we were not even courting or anything I
[1:41:27] don't think at this stage at all we're
[1:41:28] just friends but
[1:41:30] something was going on because now she
[1:41:33] starts telling me the story of when she
[1:41:35] was in Africa and they were preaching in
[1:41:39] Portuguese and she said Lord I wish you
[1:41:40] would just can you I'd love to know
[1:41:42] what they're talking about you know
[1:41:44] she's been sitting there and always
[1:41:45] preaching in Portuguese so you never
[1:41:46] really get a good sermon right because
[1:41:48] they're just preaching in another
[1:41:49] language and then all and during the
[1:41:52] service she got showing a vision and in
[1:41:55] the vision the Lord began to
[1:41:57] um put the armor on her and explain all
[1:42:00] the different parts of the Spiritual
[1:42:02] armor of of God right so she was getting
[1:42:04] clothed in this armor and she's telling
[1:42:07] me the story and as she's telling me a
[1:42:10] revelation strikes me ask her what she
[1:42:13] was wearing
[1:42:15] this is God's wisdom right
[1:42:17] ask her what she was wearing in division
[1:42:20] and ask her how her hair looked that was
[1:42:23] a seed sign up there I never mentioned
[1:42:25] anything about uncut hair at that stage
[1:42:26] I just kept that quiet but I did ask her
[1:42:29] and I sowed the seed so she's telling me
[1:42:31] the story and then she and then I say
[1:42:34] what were you wearing
[1:42:36] you know what what I said whatever you
[1:42:38] were wearing is how God wants you to
[1:42:40] look this is the image because he's
[1:42:42] showing you an image of yourself an
[1:42:44] eternity it's unconnected to Fashions of
[1:42:47] the world what did he show you and she
[1:42:49] said I was in a beautiful white dress
[1:42:50] down to the ground and my hair was down
[1:42:54] past my
[1:42:56] down my legs
[1:42:59] and
[1:43:01] I said you know what that's the very
[1:43:03] image that God sees you as
[1:43:05] all that you see around is actually
[1:43:06] corruption it's it's a people that have
[1:43:09] followed the Fashions of the world but
[1:43:11] like Esther she was willing to let go of
[1:43:14] her identity so that when she stood
[1:43:16] before the king what did the king see
[1:43:20] any children want to tell me what did
[1:43:22] the king see when he saw Esther
[1:43:25] yes Becca
[1:43:27] he saw himself because here guy knew the
[1:43:29] king so well that he knew what the king
[1:43:31] liked he knew the smell the king like
[1:43:33] the perfume he knew the way to say hello
[1:43:35] he knew the king
[1:43:37] he was a messenger from the King a
[1:43:39] prophet you could say that came to
[1:43:41] Esther and said hey I'm giving you a
[1:43:42] message an end-time message so that you
[1:43:44] can be clothed and this if you're
[1:43:47] willing to let go and lay aside all the
[1:43:48] weights that easily beset you like
[1:43:50] Bronwyn was you know it was amazing all
[1:43:52] these things God just because she was
[1:43:55] willing
[1:43:56] she wanted to know if it was God or not
[1:43:58] and he showed her and I tell you I
[1:44:00] promise you if you're really serious
[1:44:02] with God and you want to know he'll show
[1:44:04] you and we know Sister Christine's
[1:44:06] amazing testimonies about these things
[1:44:07] too people want to know why are you
[1:44:09] doing this
[1:44:10] it's not just a rule or some
[1:44:12] old-fashioned religion it's actually a
[1:44:14] very spiritual
[1:44:16] revelation of the word and the Heart of
[1:44:19] the king
[1:44:20] and it sets you apart from all other you
[1:44:23] become the gray speckled bird is it is
[1:44:25] that the grace Speckled Bird you're just
[1:44:27] so different from everyone else
[1:44:30] yeah
[1:44:31] I need to freshen up on that
[1:44:33] Hallelujah
[1:44:35] common musicians otherwise we will just
[1:44:38] this will help me close
[1:44:40] ten past nine
[1:44:43] we're going to sing the song
[1:44:49] I Give Myself Away
[1:44:51] just play it nice and sweet
[1:44:53] what happened to those who went with
[1:44:55] David
[1:44:57] they broke free from complexes of Saul
[1:44:59] can you imagine that type of leadership
[1:45:02] what a horrendous leadership just rash
[1:45:04] decisions crazy stuff you know like
[1:45:07] they're in a war and you're not allowed
[1:45:09] to eat anything it's like come on you
[1:45:11] know like this is the sort of stuff
[1:45:12] you'd make these rash decisions under
[1:45:13] emotional fear of man and complexes and
[1:45:16] inferiorities and all these things
[1:45:19] to escape that and that's your old
[1:45:21] nature now your old nature is capable of
[1:45:23] very bad things the the harder man is
[1:45:25] deceitful Above All Things it says
[1:45:28] but to break free from it to being a
[1:45:30] buyer for today
[1:45:31] to be a Jonathan but be in a buyer for
[1:45:34] Jonathan let's put those two together
[1:45:35] right can you think of that right now a
[1:45:38] buyer that lost all his family Jonathan
[1:45:40] lost all his family but Jonathan should
[1:45:41] have been like a biotherin actually run
[1:45:44] but he didn't
[1:45:46] buddy you willing
[1:45:48] to lay down everything else to come to
[1:45:52] the camp of David
[1:45:54] and it's because these are the benefits
[1:45:56] you'll break free from the complexes of
[1:45:58] Saul you'll enter true worship you know
[1:46:01] David knew how to worship and when you
[1:46:03] come into His Camp you're going to get
[1:46:04] an anointing oh Hallelujah
[1:46:07] he danced around the ark who wants to
[1:46:09] dance around the ark you know get some
[1:46:11] excitement in your life

[1:46:14] you think oh Andy is excited I am
[1:46:17] why not why not you yeah are you going
[1:46:20] to be excited too or are you just going
[1:46:22] to let Andy do all of the crazy stuff oh
[1:46:24] my but we can all be excited
[1:46:27] sometimes you just got to get next to
[1:46:29] yourself
[1:46:29] and say where am I at when you know
[1:46:32] where you're at you can then either get
[1:46:34] go further in and come to where Jesus is
[1:46:37] at and then you can bring people there
[1:46:39] you can got some definition in your life
[1:46:40] instead of just swimming around floating
[1:46:43] like a jellyfish in the sea
[1:46:48] floating Christians wandering but what
[1:46:51] about having definition
[1:46:53] having Vision having faith
[1:46:56] seeing God move in your life
[1:47:00] coming face to face with the Enemy and
[1:47:02] seeing him fall so that behind you all
[1:47:04] you see is defeated devils
[1:47:06] not complexness and complex then he said
[1:47:09] she said this said she did this to me
[1:47:10] and I'm this forever now because of that
[1:47:13] all you see is defeated Devils your
[1:47:16] whole mindset changes Saul he just had
[1:47:18] all these memories about everything that
[1:47:20] went bad and he just caused them to do
[1:47:22] stupid things and that's our old nature
[1:47:24] but what about just you know laying
[1:47:26] aside those weights laying aside those
[1:47:28] Soul attributes and moving on with God
[1:47:30] so that you can become you can beat down
[1:47:32] every enemy in David's Camp you could
[1:47:34] become a mighty Gentile warrior in
[1:47:35] David's Camp you become protected and
[1:47:37] David's kin you have Epic Adventures

[1:47:59] water the water stormy I warn you
[1:48:02] but he's on the water too that's the
[1:48:05] main thing
[1:48:07] and guess what else

[1:48:13] certain you got certain victory in your
[1:48:15] in your hands certain
[1:48:16] do you notice since they came to David
[1:48:18] and then the whole country came to him
[1:48:20] eventually and they got everything that
[1:48:21] Joshua promised after all those hundreds
[1:48:24] and hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:48:25] of just complete corruption all of a
[1:48:28] sudden they got it
[1:48:29] they finally caught the vision
