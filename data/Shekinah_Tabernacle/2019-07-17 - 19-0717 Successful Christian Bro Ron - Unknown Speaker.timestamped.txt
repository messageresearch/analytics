[31:13] glóin has been a good friend of mine
[31:15] we've been in the North karikari in the
[31:17] Pacific Asia Convention and where Andy -
[31:21] we've been together in Israel in
[31:23] Jerusalem on a tour for like two weeks
[31:25] so I love the family of God and it's
[31:28] good to see you all again you may be
[31:30] seated for a while and for those who
[31:33] don't know me I'm brother on my label
[31:35] from the Philippines so I came from I
[31:37] come from Manila I have four children
[31:40] two daughters and two boys and eldest is
[31:44] married and I've got a grandson who's
[31:46] eight years old I'm 56 years old and
[31:49] I've been fostering for 25 years since
[31:52] 1994 I came to the message in 1987 I was
[31:56] a Catholic before and the Lord was
[31:59] merciful and he wrote my name in the
[32:02] Lamb's Book of Life and came to look for
[32:04] me
[32:04] amen so it's not us coming to God it's
[32:07] because Jesus said to the Apostles you
[32:10] have not chosen me but I have chosen you
[32:12] so the bride is one in a million I
[32:15] believe you're one of them
[32:16] a man and you're so blessed you know
[32:19] that God will you know hide the truth
[32:22] from the wise and the prudent if you
[32:24] need it from the parros's and Sadducees
[32:26] and reveal it a very few as it was in
[32:29] the days of Jesus so shall it be in the
[32:31] Sun in the coming of the Son of Man

[33:23] word will never pass away but before I
[33:26] do that probably I'll I'll do a special

[42:41] the Bible says you are the salt of the
[42:43] earth that's the fruit of the Spirit
[42:45] follow you see in this code bertram said
[42:49] remember now remember that each one of
[42:51] you from tonight on remember you are
[42:54] God's billboards see he said in you're
[42:57] God's advertising agent the world will
[43:01] look at you to see what Christ is so
[43:05] we've got to attract the world to Christ
[43:08] and the Bible said we represent him we
[43:12] are ambassadors of Jesus Christ we are
[43:15] the Word made flesh again the bride you
[43:18] know we are we are flesh of his flesh we
[43:20] are bone of his bone in the absence of
[43:22] the Sun the moon will shine and the moon
[43:25] symbolizes the church because we don't
[43:28] have our own light we just reflect the
[43:30] light of Jesus Christ and Jesus said in
[43:32] John 14:12 the works that I do you shall
[43:35] do also an even greater work you shall
[43:38] do because I go to my father let's
[43:41] continue with a call he said we are
[43:43] Christ's billboard and Christ is our
[43:46] sponsor oh praise God the Lord of Heaven
[43:49] and Earth is your sponsor see all the
[43:52] power and authority is behind you amen
[43:55] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[43:57] that believe in my name you shall cast
[43:59] out devil in my name you shall lay hands
[44:01] on the sick and they shall recover so
[44:03] thus these things follow us today it
[44:07] should because that's God's promise he
[44:10] said for this sponsorship is by Christ
[44:13] were not sponsored by the Baptist or
[44:15] Methodist or by the Catholic Jesus
[44:17] Christ is your sponsor the Lord of
[44:20] Heaven coming down in flesh dying at the
[44:23] cross of Calvary who she to shed his
[44:26] blood to save us because remember the
[44:28] father could not save you he's a spirit
[44:30] you cannot crucify a spirit he has to
[44:33] share the blood his own blood because in
[44:35] Hebrews 9:22 it says for without the
[44:38] shedding of blood there is no remission
[44:39] of sin so Jesus has to come and die and
[44:45] he said it is expedient that I go away
[44:47] because if I don't go away the comforter
[44:49] will not come to you and then he told
[44:52] the disciples story in the city of
[44:54] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[44:56] from on high so power is not wealth is
[45:00] not money isn't a popularity power is
[45:03] when the Holy Ghost is come upon you and
[45:06] you become the manifestation of Jesus
[45:10] Christ in our day hey man so for this
[45:14] sponsorship it says is by Christ and he
[45:17] is giving us our life to sponsor him
[45:21] also
[45:22] so lob should be two-way right love must
[45:27] be mused mute well and Jesus said if you
[45:30] love me obey my Commandments
[45:33] Amen we cannot question his love he will
[45:35] really prove his love to us by dying at
[45:38] the cross so how can we prove our love
[45:41] to him the Prophet said by you know by
[45:44] thanking him by showing him our
[45:46] appreciation
[45:47] she we do good works not to to be safer
[45:51] already saved but we do good works in
[45:54] appreciation for the love that he has
[45:57] shown us glory to God let's move on with
[46:00] the quotation here see it says he gives
[46:04] us salvation he gives us our healing
[46:07] remember in the Bible said that in
[46:10] Psalms I believe he the Lord said I am
[46:12] the Lord heal it all die this
[46:15] and I am the lord that forgiveth all
[46:17] thine iniquities so it's not the doctors
[46:20] nor medicines that heal you
[46:22] it's God Himself who can reproduce cells
[46:25] tissues organs of the body medicine is
[46:29] only an aid no doctor will say that he
[46:32] can heal you a may they only assist
[46:34] nature but only God can heal you the
[46:38] Bible said by His stripes you were
[46:40] healed amen
[46:42] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[46:47] was bruised for our iniquities the
[46:49] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[46:50] and by His stripes we are healed we are
[46:53] saved the Prophet said he gives us our
[46:57] health and strength see our health where
[47:00] do you get your strength where do you
[47:02] get your food something has to die in
[47:05] order for you to to be alive you know
[47:08] the chicken dies the beep the cow dies
[47:11] you know the vegetable dyes the rice
[47:14] dies no so but there's one of the Cross
[47:17] who died amen for your soul salvation
[47:21] amen the soul is more important than the
[47:23] body because the body will go back to
[47:26] ashes but you have an eternal soul that
[47:29] soul has to thirst the Bible said
[47:32] blessed are they that thirst it and
[47:34] hunger it for they shall be filled
[47:37] Haman David said Lord as the deer panted
[47:40] after the water group so does my soul
[47:43] thirst after the O God we must have a
[47:46] thirst for God because he gives us food
[47:50] he gives us our homes see it says we are
[47:55] sponsored by Christ and Pentecostals
[47:58] Pentecostal people we believe in
[48:00] Pentecost
[48:01] you know Pentecost it's not a
[48:03] denomination real Pentecost is an
[48:06] experience being born again and he said
[48:09] Pentecostal people who's filled with the
[48:11] Holy Ghost is sponsors of Jesus Christ
[48:14] they have been sponsored by Jesus Christ
[48:16] and given the Holy Ghost to be an
[48:18] example to the people so that's the way
[48:21] we Christians ought to be remember the
[48:25] Bible said in acts 2:38 the
[48:28] prescription that that Peter gave us
[48:31] repent and be baptized in the name of
[48:34] Jesus Christ every one of you pour what
[48:37] for the remission of sins and then you
[48:39] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[48:42] Jesus said we must be baptized in water
[48:45] and in spirit except a man be born of
[48:49] water and of spirit he cannot enter into
[48:51] the kingdom of God so that's all we be
[48:55] we should be baptized because you cannot
[48:58] even witness without the Holy Ghost
[49:00] remember jesus said when the Holy Spirit
[49:03] come upon you you shall be my witnesses
[49:06] and to Jerusalem and to Judea and to all
[49:09] the world so burn burn I'm said here the
[49:13] world is hungry today to see love
[49:15] demonstrated you know the capstone is
[49:18] love see we must have the capstone which
[49:22] is divine love he said they don't want
[49:25] so to see so much action so much
[49:28] clapping hands then things are all right
[49:31] now I'm not discrediting them I'm just
[49:33] trying to put them in their places they
[49:36] don't want to hear you speak in tongues
[49:38] to prove you've got the Holy Ghost or
[49:40] interpret to get it the Holy Spirit they
[49:44] want to see what the love that you've
[49:46] got to display see Christians are love
[49:52] slaves to Jesus Christ remember Paul
[49:56] what did Paul say I am a prisoner of
[49:59] Jesus Christ see so that's what the
[50:03] world is one thing is love so if you
[50:05] don't have love even if you claim to be
[50:07] a Christian even if you speak in tongues
[50:10] see in 1st Corinthians chapter 13 didn't
[50:14] Paul said even if I can have the faith
[50:16] to move mountains though I can speak
[50:19] with men in anger angel though I give my
[50:21] body to be burned as a sacrifice but you
[50:24] know if I don't have blood I am nothing
[50:27] we're tinkling cymbals so that's what
[50:30] the world wants and Jesus we know God is
[50:33] love and we must display these things to
[50:36] the world let's continue with some or
[50:40] prerequisites
[50:42] in order to be a successful Christian we
[50:45] must have two things first see one of
[50:48] them is vision the second one is passion
[50:51] a man and vision is defined by the
[50:55] dictionary as a long-term commitment or
[50:59] a calling or two a calling or goal so
[51:03] being a Christian will not stop when you
[51:08] you you don't want to serve him anymore
[51:10] you know the Bible said if you put your
[51:13] your your hand on the plow you have not
[51:17] to turn back again amen when you start
[51:20] to serve Jesus
[51:21] this has been you know through eternity
[51:24] amen we must not be hampered or hindered
[51:29] by any situations in life amen because
[51:33] the Bible said without a vision for were
[51:36] there is no vision the people perish
[51:39] that's in Proverbs 29:18
[51:43] but he that keepeth the law hapc see
[51:46] vision CS the determination and the will
[51:51] to never give up
[51:53] amen in the Bible it says lay aside
[51:57] every weight Amen anything that hinders
[52:01] you and the scene you know unbelief
[52:05] which that so easily beset us and let us
[52:09] run that just walk but run this race
[52:12] with patience amen looking unto who
[52:16] looking unto Jesus Amen don't look at
[52:21] the pastor's mistake don't look at your
[52:23] brother's witnesses look only unto Jesus
[52:26] the author and finisher of your faith in
[52:31] him in him there's no no weakness amen
[52:36] no imperfection so every one of us is
[52:39] under the blood trying to work nobody's
[52:42] perfect yet but when the body changed
[52:44] the rapture comes we will have an
[52:46] immortal body amen a body an
[52:50] incorruptible body never to get sick
[52:52] never to feel pain never to die
[52:54] amen
[52:55] to a young body just like Jesus own body
[52:58] when he resurrected so we need vision
[53:02] amen
[53:03] so that's hebrews 12:1 and 2 and then
[53:07] passion you need passion passion is the
[53:12] powerful compelling desire to serve the
[53:16] Lord you must have that desire Amen
[53:20] because God doesn't want to force people
[53:22] to serve him no see we don't force
[53:26] people to serve God it has to be a
[53:28] voluntary you know a service you know
[53:32] that comes from the heart not as a duty
[53:35] or obligation just to come to church on
[53:37] Wednesday it has to be you him and if
[53:39] there's nobody come I will come because
[53:42] it's a personal revelation a personal
[53:45] affair individual calling Amen the
[53:49] rapture will you know will not be a
[53:52] group rupture the Bible said two in the
[53:55] bed one will be taken one will be left
[53:58] to in the field one will be taken one
[54:01] will be left probably husband and wife
[54:03] and one is an unbeliever the other is a
[54:05] believer so we must be ready anytime
[54:07] because the Lord will come like a thief
[54:10] in the night and take us home amen
[54:13] one of these days hallelujah so we're
[54:16] reading Colossians 3:23 and whatsoever
[54:20] you do do it heartily even not
[54:25] intellectually hard to live as to the
[54:28] Lord and not unto men so when you serve
[54:31] your boss do it unto the Lord not unto
[54:35] them unto man whatever you do in word or
[54:38] in deed do it for the glory of God amen
[54:42] so passion is also perseverance
[54:45] persistence work out your own salvation
[54:48] with fear and trembling that's the real
[54:52] Christian amen you know Bertram said to
[54:55] love God is not a duty it's a it's a lab
[55:01] that serves Christ it's strange you it
[55:05] constrains you until every pulsation of
[55:09] you
[55:09] heart beat with him a man that's Juanes
[55:12] that's unity a man with Jesus whatever
[55:15] he likes you also like whatever he
[55:18] doesn't like you also dislike Amen do
[55:21] God's will
[55:22] Amen so here we see in mark 12 what does
[55:26] it say verse 30 31 and thou shalt love
[55:30] the Lord thy God with all not just part
[55:34] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[55:38] with all thy mind with all thy strength
[55:40] that is the first commandment and the
[55:43] second is thou shalt love thy neighbor
[55:46] as thyself
[55:48] your only third verse is God the second
[55:51] is your neighbor and you're the third
[55:53] one so that's how we must love one
[55:56] another know the Bible said praise the
[55:58] Lord Amen for ver one another forgiving
[56:01] one another
[56:02] praise the Lord so here here are four
[56:06] marks of a committed person if you're a
[56:08] really committed Christian T you will
[56:11] not have excuses remember in the Bible
[56:14] the Lord invited people for the wedding
[56:17] supper OB son and they have excuses see
[56:22] one said oh I just got married and I
[56:24] have my honeymoon see the other one said
[56:27] I bought some property he I bought some
[56:30] land and I wanted I bought some cows so
[56:33] you know God won't accept excuses
[56:36] he never made excuses and said oh I
[56:39] won't I won't be at that cross you know
[56:42] you know that would hurt my hand in my
[56:45] feet he never made excuses for us Priska
[56:49] he moved on because it was you in his
[56:52] mind
[56:52] it was not the nails that held him at
[56:54] the cross it was you because we were on
[56:57] his mind
[56:58] your salvation amen committed people
[57:02] refused all destruction see if you have
[57:06] a job like on a Sunday morning and it in
[57:09] tells you to go so find another job
[57:11] praise the Lord so put him first and God
[57:15] will bless you committed people have
[57:17] passion and dedication and committed
[57:20] people are all they always find a way
[57:23] serve god no matter what the weather is
[57:26] amen
[57:27] no matter if you're you have no money to
[57:30] pay the boss or whatever you have to
[57:32] save you know make away you know for God
[57:34] to serve Him amen show him that you're
[57:38] interested hey man so sometimes in the
[57:42] age of blood is here everything is you
[57:44] know it's easy everything in our age is
[57:48] just push-button and still people you
[57:51] know get lazy to come to church when in
[57:54] the old days they would ride you know
[57:56] mountains they will cross the sea to
[57:58] attend church on a Sunday so that's why
[58:01] God hates low this year he said you said
[58:05] you you're rich and have need of nothing
[58:07] but I say your blood naked miserable
[58:09] poor wretched and don't know it oh my
[58:13] that's a race but thank me to God we
[58:15] were taken out of blood this year the
[58:18] bride out of laude sia hot prevail amen
[58:22] glory to God Birmingham said it's a joy
[58:25] to go to church under any circumstance
[58:28] can we say whether it's hot cold
[58:33] indifferent whether the people are
[58:35] fussing growling whatever they're doing
[58:38] it's still a joy to hear the word of the
[58:42] Lord then you're in love with Christ you
[58:46] love to go to church hey man we did that
[58:49] come here for anyone you did not come
[58:52] here for brother beam you came here for
[58:54] Christ amen
[58:56] the pastor is just a a a a servant of
[59:00] God you know the pattern is Paul said I
[59:02] planted Apollo's watered but it's God
[59:05] that giveth the increase amen so the
[59:09] real believer don't hear nothing but the
[59:12] word that's in the message three kinds
[59:14] of believers see that's all he watches
[59:18] the word he ain't looking for loopholes
[59:23] he ain't looking for no gimmicks he
[59:27] believes God and that settles it and he
[59:30] just keeps going on going on there's the
[59:34] real believer
[59:35] amen you must have the same attitude in
[59:39] character see rich guy let's read some
[59:42] more in Matthew 10:37 t God ought to be
[59:47] more important than your mother and
[59:48] father and son and daughter jesus said
[59:52] this is the words of Jesus he that
[59:53] loveth father or mother more than me is
[59:56] not worthy of me he that loveth son or
[1:00:00] daughter more than me is not worthy of
[1:00:02] me and he that taketh not his cross this
[1:00:05] is another littler cross you know it's
[1:00:07] your trials the sufferings that God
[1:00:10] allow he you must take your cross and
[1:00:13] follow after him if you don't you are
[1:00:16] not worthy of me Jesus said and then in
[1:00:20] another scripture Luke 14 27 and 33
[1:00:26] whosoever does not bear his cross and
[1:00:29] come after me cannot be my disciple we
[1:00:32] have a cross to carry you know each one
[1:00:35] of us we have problems in life we have
[1:00:37] trials Christianity is not a bed of
[1:00:40] roses you know every all that we live
[1:00:43] godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:00:44] persecution suffering is part of a
[1:00:48] Christian if our Lord suffered and he
[1:00:50] learned obedience through suffering
[1:00:52] Thomas More are we he says so likewise
[1:00:55] whosoever he be o buted forsake it not
[1:00:58] all that he had he cannot be my disciple
[1:01:02] that's the criteria he must be first
[1:01:05] love God more than your wife husband
[1:01:09] children you let nothing hinder you new
[1:01:12] trials your feelings remember those
[1:01:16] children of Israel never crossed the
[1:01:19] promised land they crossed the Red Sea
[1:01:21] they were given a prophet they ate from
[1:01:23] the manna from heaven they eat from the
[1:01:26] water that came from the rock but they
[1:01:27] murmured they complain against Moses so
[1:01:32] they all perish in the wilderness only
[1:01:35] two went into the Promised Land that's
[1:01:37] Joseph Wayne Khalid two in a million two
[1:01:40] million came out and only two went in
[1:01:43] from the original because the new
[1:01:45] generation that were born in the
[1:01:47] wilderness went with Jose Wayne Colin
[1:01:49] and they they even you know circumcised
[1:01:52] them before crossing so see we see a lot
[1:01:55] of young people and in some churches
[1:01:58] there are a few old people why because
[1:02:02] the new generation you know is picking
[1:02:05] up this message you know they're they're
[1:02:07] catching up with the older generation so
[1:02:09] I just believe for us that we will be
[1:02:11] all there no T because each one of us is
[1:02:15] responsible we are answerable for our
[1:02:18] own amen so let's let's press on and
[1:02:24] fight a good fight of faith here let's
[1:02:26] look at some quotations from the message
[1:02:29] possessing the enemy God brings tensions
[1:02:33] into the church for every son that
[1:02:36] cometh to God must be tried proven and
[1:02:40] tested listen he let's sickness strikes
[1:02:43] you he lets diseases come on you to test
[1:02:47] you and to prove you to show the world
[1:02:49] that you're truly the seed of Abraham he
[1:02:52] permits it by his own will remember job
[1:02:56] job was a believer but he got sick he
[1:03:00] got you know all those boils in his body
[1:03:03] but it was not because he was a sinner
[1:03:05] it was a trial
[1:03:07] just to show Satan that my my son job no
[1:03:10] matter what you do to him
[1:03:11] he will never forsake me see sometimes
[1:03:15] God wants Satan to see that also in you
[1:03:18] that's why he allows some sickness
[1:03:21] diseases look at some of the codes here
[1:03:25] it says he permits disasters probably
[1:03:30] accidents earthquakes you know things
[1:03:33] like that
[1:03:34] typhoons see he permits the friends to
[1:03:37] turn against you amen he he and and
[1:03:42] permits the devil lose to tempt you and
[1:03:45] he will do all but take your life he
[1:03:49] could throw you on a bed of affliction
[1:03:50] he could turn your neighbors against you
[1:03:54] he could turn the church even against
[1:03:56] you and he can do most anything and it's
[1:04:00] God's will for him to do it we are
[1:04:02] taught that God
[1:04:03] is that that it's more our fate is more
[1:04:05] precious than gold so Satan is just
[1:04:09] following God you know Satan God uses
[1:04:13] Satan sometimes to perfect us brother
[1:04:18] even said how I think Satan because if
[1:04:20] there's no trial in no suffering
[1:04:22] I could not you know overcome see Satan
[1:04:27] has to get permission from God he can
[1:04:29] never touch you dislike job just like
[1:04:32] the Hebrew children he just like Daniel
[1:04:35] in the lion's den so we can go all trees
[1:04:38] these trials but if your predestinated
[1:04:41] see everything will work out for the
[1:04:44] good of them that love God is for your
[1:04:47] good that he does it okay let's continue
[1:04:50] the Bible said that Jesus himself who is
[1:04:53] the author and finisher of our faith for
[1:04:56] the joy that was set before him endured
[1:04:58] the cross he despised the shame and is
[1:05:02] set down at the right hand of the throne
[1:05:03] of God amen
[1:05:04] and you can see that in Philippians 2:6
[1:05:08] teachers who being in the form of God
[1:05:10] thought it not robbery to be equal to
[1:05:12] God but made himself of no reputation
[1:05:17] see he took upon him the form of a
[1:05:20] servant made in the likeness of men and
[1:05:22] being found in the fashion as a man he
[1:05:24] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:05:28] death even the death of the cross so it
[1:05:32] entail obedience the Bible said
[1:05:34] sacrifice or obedience is better than
[1:05:37] sacrifice he that's what God wants to
[1:05:41] find amongst Christians see Jesus
[1:05:47] persevered here in the Bible he was
[1:05:50] abused MA Club
[1:05:52] slaps beatings cords he chose the nails
[1:05:55] he chose to die for our sins see he was
[1:05:59] when he was in the cross on the cross he
[1:06:02] was you and I were on his mind remember
[1:06:05] that Jesus he doesn't have to do it see
[1:06:10] but it was a very important job he did
[1:06:14] not send an angel for a prophet to
[1:06:17] he came down himself that just goes to
[1:06:20] show that your soul the Prophet said one
[1:06:23] soul is worth ten thousand words see and
[1:06:27] only Jesus got himself becoming man can
[1:06:31] redeem us from the curse of the law so
[1:06:34] we thank God for that what we must do is
[1:06:37] return the favor
[1:06:39] amen he Paul said you did run well who
[1:06:43] did hinder you that ye should not obey
[1:06:45] the truth now let me read this code from
[1:06:48] here you him where Birnam said
[1:06:50] christians are not cowards see they
[1:06:54] believe God they stand on what he says
[1:06:57] you've got to be brave and stand right
[1:06:59] up to be believe him take and trust in
[1:07:02] his word God don't want cowards
[1:07:05] God wants men that's brave he cannot use
[1:07:08] a coward and are afraid to testify of
[1:07:11] your healing afraid to tell your
[1:07:14] neighbor your boss what God has done to
[1:07:16] you or give praise to Christ a shame to
[1:07:19] speak up in the hour when the trial
[1:07:20] comes and you're afraid to say that
[1:07:22] you're a Christian God cannot use you
[1:07:25] God cannot use cowards when you believe
[1:07:28] God you've got to believe him with all
[1:07:30] that is in you aim and believe God and
[1:07:34] trust in him because I believe that he
[1:07:37] promised that he will never leave you
[1:07:40] nor forsake you until the end of time he
[1:07:43] promised to supply all your need
[1:07:46] according to his riches in glory that's
[1:07:49] the kind of God we serve he told Moses
[1:07:52] be still and know that I am God praise
[1:07:55] God he could open the Red Sea he could
[1:07:58] raise up the dead he knows what you're
[1:08:00] thinking right now he knows what you're
[1:08:02] going on he knows your problems t so all
[1:08:06] you have to do is surrender to Him the
[1:08:09] Bible said it says a god carrot cast
[1:08:16] your cares upon him for he carried for
[1:08:19] you that's what the Bible said so now
[1:08:22] let's read some more Satan will try to
[1:08:26] stop you of course Satan you know his
[1:08:29] his
[1:08:31] spirit he can use your mind he can bring
[1:08:33] fear he can bring doubt he can bring
[1:08:37] hatred you know just about anything to
[1:08:39] stumble you amen to to bring you away
[1:08:43] from Christ but you know if you have
[1:08:46] been knocked out and have currently been
[1:08:49] stumbled your goal is you must rise up
[1:08:53] again see don't be out of focus see we
[1:08:59] need to you know stand up again and
[1:09:01] fight a good fight of faith the Bible
[1:09:04] said if we confess our sins he is just
[1:09:08] and faithful to forgive you of your sins
[1:09:11] just like the prodigal son you know the
[1:09:14] father was always there waiting for him
[1:09:16] while he was in sin but the father had
[1:09:19] prepared a banquet he prepared a ring he
[1:09:22] prepared hey you know what we call a
[1:09:25] form of a you know clothing suited for a
[1:09:29] prince
[1:09:29] that's why his elder brother and Oh got
[1:09:31] jealous praise God
[1:09:33] so God is always waiting for us whenever
[1:09:38] we fall he's there to help you don't
[1:09:40] ever think that God hates you because he
[1:09:43] loves you he gave his life for you it's
[1:09:46] just Satan that's telling you because of
[1:09:49] sin sin separate us from God
[1:09:51] amen now the Bible said we must be
[1:09:55] zealous to repent see revive your first
[1:10:00] love in the in the church age of Ephesus
[1:10:03] God is one complaint you have left your
[1:10:06] first love
[1:10:07] and your first love is not your right
[1:10:09] brother Ben Jesus is our first love is
[1:10:12] that right a man not your boyfriend or
[1:10:15] your girlfriend T so it's an individual
[1:10:18] walk with God and Joseph ah even told
[1:10:22] the Israelites choose you this day whom
[1:10:24] you will serve the gods of the AMA
[1:10:27] writes you know the Hittites the
[1:10:30] malachite but as for me and my house we
[1:10:34] will serve the Lord amen that's the
[1:10:37] right declare declaration that's the
[1:10:39] statement of a Christian no matter what
[1:10:41] happens I will serve the Lord amen
[1:10:45] so set your priorities right because God
[1:10:48] will bless you the Bible said seek ye
[1:10:51] first his kingdom and his righteousness
[1:10:53] and all these things material financial
[1:10:56] blessing spiritual whatever it is they
[1:11:00] shall be added unto you
[1:11:02] amen do we believe amen
[1:11:06] so in John 15:7 jesus said if you abide
[1:11:09] in me that if is a conditional word if
[1:11:14] it's a condition if ye abide in me and
[1:11:19] my words abide in you then what ye shall
[1:11:22] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:11:25] unto you so but if you're not abiding in
[1:11:29] Christ you cannot expect that your
[1:11:32] prayers will be answered
[1:11:33] because that's the condition you must
[1:11:36] live according to the world see
[1:11:39] acknowledge God in all your ways and he
[1:11:42] will direct thy paths the Bible said see
[1:11:45] brother Branham said a man this born of
[1:11:48] the Spirit of God loves to go to church
[1:11:51] better than he loves to eat his dinner
[1:11:53] when he's hungry
[1:11:55] is the truth is that true see God first
[1:12:00] before dinner amen
[1:12:03] the spiritual man on the inside has got
[1:12:05] to be fed if that man isn't fed he will
[1:12:09] die the outward man isn't fed he will
[1:12:11] die and so will the inward man it's got
[1:12:15] to be fed on TV people usually eat five
[1:12:18] times a day three times but how about
[1:12:23] your soul see so you must give more
[1:12:26] importance to that soul of yours because
[1:12:29] this body will die but the soul will
[1:12:31] never die in either's go to the souls in
[1:12:34] prison the speak dimension or you go
[1:12:36] you're pure theophany on the sixth
[1:12:38] dimension and when the rapture takes
[1:12:40] place that here funny will come down to
[1:12:42] pick up the redeemed body and meet the
[1:12:44] Lord up in the air and we which are
[1:12:47] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:12:49] together with them in the clouds that's
[1:12:51] our hope that's the greatest event that
[1:12:53] we're looking for it's not a soccer
[1:12:55] football or boxing game that were the
[1:12:57] greatest event
[1:12:58] that coming of the Lord physically
[1:13:01] corporally he will come he has already
[1:13:04] appeared 1963 in that headship the cloud
[1:13:07] but you know in Acts chapter 1 verse 8 I
[1:13:10] believe verse 9 see Jesus he has ended
[1:13:14] up and there was a cloud you know that
[1:13:17] the you know that that met him and we
[1:13:20] saw that cloud now and soon the real
[1:13:23] body will come to pick us up in the air
[1:13:27] amen so you need a home church here's
[1:13:30] the code discernment
[1:13:32] he said every man ought to have a church
[1:13:36] home you ought to have a place not just
[1:13:39] to float about from pillar to post but
[1:13:43] have somewhere that you go to church and
[1:13:45] you call it your church somewhere you
[1:13:47] pay your tithe and somewhere you help
[1:13:50] support the cause P and we're given a
[1:13:54] free choice see the next word is take
[1:13:56] your choice
[1:13:58] e but then don't never disfellowship the
[1:14:02] other man because he don't belong with
[1:14:03] your group see discern his spirit if
[1:14:06] he's got the same spirit in heart then
[1:14:09] you got fellowship one with another
[1:14:11] you're working for one great cause
[1:14:13] that's the cause of price I think that
[1:14:16] is absolutely true so we cannot just
[1:14:18] stay home you know on Sunday have a home
[1:14:21] church brother branham said because even
[1:14:25] an evangelist has had to have a home
[1:14:27] church an apostle a teacher has to have
[1:14:31] a pass or even rather ran on the Prophet
[1:14:33] he subjected himself to brother Neville
[1:14:35] he said burnable our pastor see we have
[1:14:38] to have church order amen don't stay
[1:14:42] alone and claim to be you know a
[1:14:45] minister without a home church amen
[1:14:48] we must have a pastor because a pastor
[1:14:50] is the head of the local assembly amen
[1:14:53] so that's what the Bible tells us in in
[1:14:59] I believe in Timothy so but you cannot
[1:15:03] have vision and passion without
[1:15:05] revelation see revelation is the one
[1:15:09] that will quicken you so with
[1:15:13] the revelation the wine stimulation of
[1:15:15] the revelation the why we call is hurt
[1:15:18] not the oil and the wine see without
[1:15:21] that see we will just be nominal
[1:15:24] Christians see that's why the
[1:15:27] denominations today they have
[1:15:28] entertainment they have strobe lights
[1:15:31] near the pulpit and dancing and you know
[1:15:34] people are you know cracking jokes on
[1:15:38] the pulpit because people they have no
[1:15:41] revelation and even the pastor they
[1:15:44] don't have the relation they just preach
[1:15:46] from a past message of you know Luther
[1:15:49] Wesley but we have a fresh matter for
[1:15:51] our age amen where the carcass is there
[1:15:55] the Eagles will gather in a Bible and
[1:15:57] the Eagles eat fresh meat amen
[1:16:01] you know in the for creatures only the
[1:16:03] Eagle eat fresh meat the lion the ox the
[1:16:08] man they drink milk when they are little
[1:16:11] but the eagle eats the meat immediately
[1:16:16] after birth and that's what we are we
[1:16:22] heard the voice of our Jehovah eagle
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:26] and we have been taken out of the
[1:16:27] denominational barnyard of the chickens
[1:16:30] you know the story hallelujah and that's
[1:16:34] why you know Peter you know Jesus asked
[1:16:38] the disciples who do men say that I am
[1:16:40] in John chapters 13 I believe he said uh
[1:16:45] although they call you probably your
[1:16:48] Jeremiah or you were one of the prophets
[1:16:52] or you're John the Baptist that rose
[1:16:54] again t but who do you say that I am
[1:16:57] Jesus had asked a personal question
[1:17:00] and Peter volunteered Lord thou art the
[1:17:04] Christ though art the son of the Living
[1:17:06] God and Jesus said blessed are you Peter
[1:17:10] Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood no
[1:17:13] man no seminary has rebuilt easel to you
[1:17:16] but my heavenly father has revealed it
[1:17:19] unto you
[1:17:19] and upon this rock of Revelation the
[1:17:24] rock of Revelation that my
[1:17:26] other has given you I will build my
[1:17:28] church and the gates of Hell can never
[1:17:31] prevail against you so we must have that
[1:17:34] rock of Revelation you must know your
[1:17:37] messenger for the age that you're living
[1:17:39] Burnham said the evidence of the baptism
[1:17:42] of the Holy Ghost is to receive the
[1:17:44] message in the day in which you're
[1:17:46] living in so and then be born again
[1:17:49] through that message and be filled with
[1:17:52] the Holy Spirit and bring forth the food
[1:17:55] fruits of the Holy Spirit in Galatians
[1:17:56] 5:22 you will have love joy peace
[1:17:59] long-suffering gentleness meekness it
[1:18:03] will flow through her a true Christian
[1:18:06] in our age
[1:18:07] amen praise God so now let's read a
[1:18:11] coach he said here it must be a divine
[1:18:14] revelation of Jesus Christ to you that
[1:18:16] just came out of the heart the
[1:18:18] intellectual faith is not enough even if
[1:18:22] you read a Bible daily memorized
[1:18:25] Scriptures the Bible says the letter
[1:18:27] killeth
[1:18:28] but it's the spirit that giveth life
[1:18:31] we need a revelation of the Spirit and
[1:18:33] he said the Holy Spirit is a personal
[1:18:36] experience of the bird the new bird
[1:18:39] regeneration making a new creature in
[1:18:41] Christ he will know the Holy Spirit will
[1:18:44] guide you into all truth not just
[1:18:46] partial truth because denominations they
[1:18:50] have partial truth they have father son
[1:18:52] Holy Ghost in baptism they thought there
[1:18:54] are three persons in the Trinity or in
[1:18:56] the Godhead see they still believe that
[1:18:59] it was an apple that caused man to fall
[1:19:01] the fall you know so there's no
[1:19:03] revelation in there but blessed be your
[1:19:06] eyes because God has given us the ice
[1:19:09] sound you know that we can see there are
[1:19:13] the true revelation for our aids amen so
[1:19:16] the new birth is a revelation we'll be
[1:19:18] closing the new birth he said is a
[1:19:20] revelation God has revealed this to you
[1:19:22] to you this great mystery and that is
[1:19:25] the new bird P it's Christ the
[1:19:29] revelation when Christ is revealed to
[1:19:32] you that's the new birth because the new
[1:19:35] birth is composed of three stages
[1:19:37] justification sanctification and
[1:19:40] the same of the holy ghost that right
[1:19:42] you have to complete all three because
[1:19:45] the natural birth is composed of water
[1:19:47] blood and then live spirit same thing in
[1:19:51] the in the spiritual you have to be you
[1:19:54] know baptized in water justified by
[1:19:57] faith believing and then you have to be
[1:19:59] sanctified by the blood of Jesus and
[1:20:01] then the Holy Spirit the fire of God has
[1:20:04] to burn that sin out of you and you
[1:20:07] become the temple of the Holy Spirit the
[1:20:10] Holy Spirit comes unto you seals you
[1:20:13] until the day of your Redemption a man
[1:20:15] Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy
[1:20:17] Spirit whereby you're sealed until the
[1:20:19] day of the redemption permanence ed when
[1:20:21] you are sealed it means three things a
[1:20:24] seal means security and seal means
[1:20:27] completion a seal means ownership your
[1:20:31] own by God you are sealed
[1:20:33] you are secured Satan has no more power
[1:20:36] over you and the work of salvation has
[1:20:39] been completed this is like a mineral
[1:20:42] water probably if you have a bottle if
[1:20:44] it's got no seal meaning to say it
[1:20:47] hasn't passed the standards yet or it
[1:20:49] could be you know it has could be poison
[1:20:52] in it so you know something that's not
[1:20:54] sealed is dangerous so if you're not
[1:20:57] sealed as a Christian by the Holy Spirit
[1:20:59] you can still you know turn back to the
[1:21:02] world anytime you can backslide you can
[1:21:05] you know you can deny the Lord like
[1:21:07] Peter Peter denied Jesus Christ three
[1:21:10] times because he was not yet filled by
[1:21:13] the Holy Spirit
[1:21:14] when was Peters filled on the day of
[1:21:17] Pentecost they have to eat tarry ten
[1:21:19] days to get the holy spirit so that's
[1:21:22] how you know a true Christian how they
[1:21:25] you know they serve the Lord you don't
[1:21:28] have to pat their back a brother called
[1:21:30] him on the phone why were you not here
[1:21:32] that Sunday please come no no they'll
[1:21:35] come on their own amen because it's God
[1:21:38] living in them image the Holy Spirit
[1:21:41] leading them when they say a man is not
[1:21:44] you a meaning brother that's the Holy
[1:21:45] Spirit in you a meaning to his word
[1:21:47] Amen that's my word praise the Lord so
[1:21:52] it says here
[1:21:53] it's Christ expressing himself in the
[1:21:57] individual that's the real Christian
[1:21:59] whether he's intellectual or whether he
[1:22:02] don't know his ABC you know Peter never
[1:22:05] know how to sign his own name he he
[1:22:08] don't know how to sign but he was given
[1:22:10] the key to the kingdom whatever you Luke
[1:22:13] you you whatever you bind on earth shall
[1:22:16] be bound in heaven whatever you lose
[1:22:18] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:22:19] top of the Apostles didn't know them
[1:22:22] that's right but they know Christ to
[1:22:25] know him his life he didn't say to know
[1:22:29] the Catechism or to know the novena to
[1:22:31] know the Apostles Creed to know him
[1:22:34] Jesus Christ personally reveal to you
[1:22:37] that will make you a real effective
[1:22:40] Christian and God will be pleased with
[1:22:43] your life amen so now I believe I'll
[1:22:47] have a few more slides ago another
[1:22:50] quotation in Christ the mystery of God
[1:22:52] revealed he said upon this rock I will
[1:22:54] build my church and the gates of Hell
[1:22:57] shall will never shake down never
[1:22:59] prevail against it see a revelation of
[1:23:01] Jesus Christ look he said Christ in you
[1:23:06] makes him the center of life of the
[1:23:11] revelation price life in you make him
[1:23:15] the center of Revelation price in the
[1:23:18] Bible makes the Bible a complete
[1:23:19] revelation of Christ and then Christ in
[1:23:22] you makes you the complete revelation of
[1:23:26] the whole thing see praise the Lord
[1:23:30] if you read a whole book you will find
[1:23:32] three three three fold the plan that God
[1:23:38] wanted to do Berman said the first was
[1:23:42] he wanted God wanted to reveal himself
[1:23:45] through Christ the second is he wanted
[1:23:49] Christ to be revealed among his bride
[1:23:52] and the third he would want he want to
[1:23:55] restore the Garden of Eden where Adam
[1:23:59] and Eve were supposed to have a
[1:24:00] honeymoon but now the second Adam Jesus
[1:24:03] Christ and his men
[1:24:05] remember bride will be having the
[1:24:08] honeymoon we will have a glorified body
[1:24:11] we will rule and reign this world with a
[1:24:13] rod of iron in the Millennium for 1000
[1:24:17] years we will be priests and kings with
[1:24:19] him after the rapture there will be
[1:24:22] three and a half years of tribulation
[1:24:23] see earthquakes there will be not one
[1:24:27] stone thrown down see all the the
[1:24:30] incurable diseases volcanic eruption the
[1:24:32] missiles will fly and there will be a
[1:24:34] third world war a magadhan will burn her
[1:24:37] heart and then Israel will fight against
[1:24:41] you know Gog and Magog Russia Iran will
[1:24:43] attack Israel but Jesus in Revelation 19
[1:24:46] will come down with his Saints on white
[1:24:48] horses to fight for Israel and when he
[1:24:53] wins the battle we will the right you
[1:24:57] shall walk upon the ashes of the wicked
[1:24:59] and we will rule this earth for 1000
[1:25:03] years no no no no man has ever lived
[1:25:07] 1,000 years Methuselah was about 969
[1:25:11] something but we will leave a thousand
[1:25:13] years and then no more death no more
[1:25:16] pain we will be in a glorified body we
[1:25:18] will be young like sisters eighteen
[1:25:21] years old in your body brothers probably
[1:25:24] 2021 you know Jesus they didn't
[1:25:27] recognize him and he walked with the two
[1:25:29] disciples in emails because he turned
[1:25:31] back to a young man and then he just
[1:25:34] they recognized him when he broke the
[1:25:36] bread oh that was our Lord and then he
[1:25:37] disappeared and reappeared in Jerusalem
[1:25:41] among the disciple so when we have that
[1:25:43] body we can pass through walls we can
[1:25:46] drop it like a thought we can appear and
[1:25:49] disappear see that kind of body we will
[1:25:52] see angels because right now the angels
[1:25:54] are on a faster dimension the Devils are
[1:25:57] here the angels are here but one day we
[1:25:59] will see them all when we get that that
[1:26:02] new glorified body jeez Paul said in a
[1:26:07] twinkling one ah I show you a mystery
[1:26:09] behold we will not all sleep but we
[1:26:11] shall all be changed from mortality to
[1:26:14] immortality to corruption or rather
[1:26:18] corruption to incorruption we're waiting
[1:26:20] for the day and how close are we to the
[1:26:24] coming of the Lord we see all the signs
[1:26:27] we see Israel becoming a nation Israel
[1:26:31] turned 70 years last year 19 or rather
[1:26:35] they started 1948 to 2018 t so brother
[1:26:40] Branham is gone of the scene C but we
[1:26:42] still have the message because the bride
[1:26:45] under her messenger will be the final
[1:26:48] voice to the final age so we're now
[1:26:51] eating the book you know the book in
[1:26:54] Revelation 10 verse 8 to 11 John ate it
[1:26:58] and it was sweet in his stomach but
[1:27:00] bitter or rather sweet in the mouth but
[1:27:02] bitter in the stomach it's sweet to
[1:27:04] share you know to to to talk about but
[1:27:07] it's bitter
[1:27:08] it's full of you know this message will
[1:27:10] be full of persecution but it's all
[1:27:13] right amen that's that's nothing because
[1:27:18] we know that every Christian will be
[1:27:21] persecuted but the Bible said there in
[1:27:23] Revelation 10 11 it says thou must
[1:27:27] prophesy again we are declaring again
[1:27:30] this message amongst nation tongues
[1:27:33] races and colors that's our part today
[1:27:37] amen so final admonition the Bible said
[1:27:40] if any man have not the Spirit of Christ
[1:27:44] he is none of his
[1:27:46] so we ought to be filled with the Holy
[1:27:49] Spirit
[1:27:50] brother Branham said you eat ought to be
[1:27:53] the most important thing in our life to
[1:27:56] be sealed by the oil because the foolish
[1:27:59] virgin didn't get the oil only the wise
[1:28:02] virgin got the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:05] Spirit which is the oil and they were
[1:28:07] left behind see so the final admonition
[1:28:10] here is just to repeat to you the
[1:28:13] eternal prescription of God that if
[1:28:15] anyone here has not been baptized in the
[1:28:18] name of Jesus Christ it's high time now
[1:28:20] who received the Lord which is repent
[1:28:24] turn back be baptized in the name not in
[1:28:27] the titles anymore because the
[1:28:29] revelation of the name is Lord is the
[1:28:32] name of the
[1:28:32] other Jesus is the name of the Sun and
[1:28:36] Christ
[1:28:37] Thea is the name of the Holy Spirit Lord
[1:28:40] Jesus Christ no other name is given a
[1:28:43] nerd whereby we must be saved and we
[1:28:45] must be baptized in the name of the
[1:28:47] Crucified all Christians were baptized
[1:28:49] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:51] Paul did Peter did James John and so
[1:28:55] after being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:28:58] that is your bonus the remission of sins
[1:29:02] and then being baptized receiving the
[1:29:06] gift of the Holy Ghost it's like that
[1:29:08] like you have a debt you have blown like
[1:29:11] a million dollars in the bank and you
[1:29:13] were not able to pay for it
[1:29:14] Jesus paid for it you're supposed to be
[1:29:18] imprisoned Jesus taking you out and then
[1:29:21] open a bank account and put another
[1:29:23] million for you
[1:29:25] you know remission of sins and receiving
[1:29:29] the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:29:31] hallelujah that's the benefit of a
