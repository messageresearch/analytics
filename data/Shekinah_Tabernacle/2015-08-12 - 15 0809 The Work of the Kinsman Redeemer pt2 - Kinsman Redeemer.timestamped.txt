[0:00] man that's the man Christ Jesus it's not
[0:02] a multitude of you know people can't
[0:04] make a committee and say these people
[0:06] did some nice things in there for we can
[0:08] pray to them that is not how the Bible
[0:09] works there's one mediator between God
[0:11] and man and that is the man Christ Jesus
[0:13] and so he had to remain there as an
[0:16] intercessor as a mediator until they
[0:19] came a season now where he was going to
[0:21] wind up his plan of redemption and he
[0:24] was going to claim back the title deed
[0:27] to the earth which which Adam lost and
[0:29] we'll read about in revelations chapter
[0:31] 5 if you got it handy and then he would
[0:33] take that he would take that title deed
[0:36] and he would wind up with plan of
[0:38] redemption now we as I said in the
[0:42] beginning Satan knows that the you know
[0:45] everything Adam has lost has been given
[0:48] back to the church amen he knows all
[0:51] these things but then he says now this
[0:53] is not for you it is for you it's
[0:57] absolutely for you now revelations
[1:00] chapter 5 we begin to remember this is a
[1:03] symbolic book but what John sees now has
[1:06] to be lived out now I'm not going to
[1:10] read the whole chapter but what we have
[1:13] is we have a scene in Revelations
[1:14] forward John has looked it up into the
[1:16] lift it up into heaven he seized the
[1:19] throne he sees the cherubims and the
[1:21] four twenty elders and all these suits
[1:22] and then in Revelations 5 he says I saw
[1:25] on the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:27] throne a book written written written
[1:29] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:31] seven seals so this members all symbolic
[1:34] but this now is the title deed of the UF
[1:37] that Adam lost and what has to happen
[1:40] now as someone has to be found worthy to
[1:43] redeem everything back that Adam had
[1:46] fallen promise so a man because a man
[1:48] fell now a man had to raise up and take
[1:52] what a man had lost and so now there was
[1:55] a challenge that came forth and in verse
[1:57] 2 and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:59] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[2:02] the book and the loosest seals they're
[2:04] off so there's a challenge now who's
[2:06] worthy and John when he looked he saw he
[2:09] could see no man
[2:10] heaven no man and earth not under the
[2:12] earth was able to open the book neither
[2:14] to look their eyes and he says he wet
[2:16] much and he didn't wait because he
[2:19] wasn't worthy but he worked because in
[2:21] you of someone if a man could not stand
[2:24] up and if a man could not take that book
[2:26] then the whole of creation was still
[2:28] life because remember it's one thing to
[2:31] redeem something you pay the price for
[2:33] the object and then you go clean you go
[2:35] claimant and on Calvary he he paid it
[2:38] all but then it comes a season now where
[2:41] he claims everything and then he he yo
[2:44] and then Eden is restored upon the earth
[2:47] and everything that Adam fell from has
[2:49] been restored so there comes a seasoned
[2:51] out where he doesn't have to pay any
[2:53] more blood the Bloods been cheered the
[2:55] price has been paid you know when he
[2:58] said it's finished the price was paid is
[3:00] done yes FF but then he had to come to
[3:02] hasn't got a point now where the lamb
[3:04] steps for the man steps forth to redeem
[3:07] what Adam fell from and so that's why
[3:11] that's why John went but then but then
[3:14] in verse 5 says one of the angel said
[3:16] unto me weep not behold the Lion of the
[3:17] tribe of Judah the root of david has
[3:20] prevailed to open the book and to lose
[3:22] the seven seals they're off and he says
[3:25] and I beheld so I'm just reading this
[3:26] does it out and I'll be held on the
[3:28] midst of the throne and of the for peace
[3:30] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[3:32] and had been slain having seven horns
[3:35] and seven eyes which are the seven
[3:37] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[3:40] earth now there's all symbolic remember
[3:43] because our Lord Jesus he you know
[3:47] because the fullness of god he fondly
[3:50] dwells in him but when he was on earth
[3:52] and younger days was flesh he was he
[3:56] called himself son of man prophet and he
[3:59] was the sacrifice can any rose with his
[4:02] own blood is the high priest and then
[4:04] you know but the intended to be king
[4:06] then him has to be judged mmm is to you
[4:10] know all these attributes in him but in
[4:13] certain times and the scripture he's
[4:16] expressing different things
[4:17] it's like it's like you know you know
[4:20] you take my wife and her was to beam up
[4:23] when she was born now just first bought
[4:25] and her was to be a sister yes but
[4:28] there's no siblings and her is to be
[4:30] your wife but she's not married and her
[4:34] is to be a mother but she doesn't have
[4:37] any children she's only a book but so n
[4:40] has all these potentials but she can't
[4:42] express them at that time you see and
[4:45] then and then now she becomes she's born
[4:47] so she's always a daughter and then what
[4:51] happens as time goes along her parents
[4:53] had more children so now she has
[4:55] siblings just so she could express
[4:57] herself as a sister yo but then there
[5:01] comes a time now where where we got
[5:03] married and so before that she was
[5:06] expressing herself more as a daughter
[5:08] but then when she married me she becomes
[5:11] my wife and they now her being a
[5:13] daughter has expressed less because he's
[5:16] married to me she's not at home anymore
[5:17] you're you're following me but then who
[5:20] was a waste to be daughter even now
[5:22] she's still a daughter she's still a
[5:24] sister but she expresses how mainly as
[5:27] wife and mother amen yeah so it doesn't
[5:31] what she's doing now doesn't take away
[5:34] from what she is yeah that's why because
[5:37] these questions were the Lambs taking
[5:38] the book there's no more mercy and it's
[5:39] all over no it's not I don't you don't
[5:41] understand man because he's a waster
[5:43] lamb hey lloyds was the lamb us will be
[5:46] the last he always was the high priest
[5:48] ways will be the high priests he always
[5:51] was the offering a many ways was these
[5:53] things so just because people say oh boy
[5:55] he's taking the book it must be mercy no
[5:57] and it wasn't him to be the lamb at
[6:01] always what he was always in him to be
[6:03] you know mediator intercessor advocate
[6:06] comforter all these things are in him
[6:08] but certain stages he's expressing
[6:10] things more than other things he's not
[6:13] the king yo he's not the son of David
[6:17] sitting on the throne yet but in her mr.
[6:19] be king amen you're following me so it's
[6:23] in him but it's not fully expressed yet
[6:25] right yep
[6:28] yeah you know you understand it's just
[6:31] like someone growing up when they're
[6:32] young all those potentials are in them
[6:34] but as time goes long dinner begins to
[6:36] express itself and they're still the
[6:38] things they were in the beginning yeah
[6:41] that's why that's why you say well he's
[6:44] taken the book he has taken the book but
[6:45] they're still there's still blood
[6:47] there's still intercession we still have
[6:49] a mediator hey we need a sacrifice we
[6:52] need a mediator until the days of these
[6:54] atoms changing these bodies amen we sin
[6:58] every day but the Bible says if you
[7:01] confess your sins he's faithful just to
[7:03] forgive us maybe is that right so we
[7:06] needed in to see so we need a lamb and
[7:07] he's still our lamb Oh amen but when
[7:11] John saw because John only knew him as
[7:13] lamb yep but then but then because he
[7:17] said the Lion of the tribe of Judah has
[7:18] prevailed he didn't know Jesus align a
[7:20] tribe of Judah and their way it wasn't
[7:24] he only knew him as lamb amen it's just
[7:29] like if you never knew me just say I was
[7:33] I know I had some profession and then
[7:36] you never knew I was very good at
[7:37] something and then one day so I didn't
[7:40] know you're good at that or you could do
[7:41] that what's that you never knew me that
[7:43] way amen that's all it's clear right
[7:48] yeah and then so so he I'm just going to
[7:55] read this from the breach bc now he has
[7:57] he's taken this book this plan of
[8:01] redemption I mean you know he's taken
[8:04] the book of redemption out of the right
[8:05] hand of him that SAT upon the throne and
[8:07] then when john told us he began to
[8:10] rejoice he's all that in heaven under
[8:12] heaven and the earth all these things
[8:13] heard him cry out you know blessings
[8:16] honor and glory and power be under him
[8:17] that sitteth upon the throne and unto
[8:19] the lamb forever and ever yeah glory now
[8:24] he says this in the breach and maybe if
[8:26] you want to go list that sermon he says
[8:29] now he said the Lion of the tribe of
[8:31] Judah why out of Judah Judah was a
[8:34] lawgiver yo Judah a lawgiver shall not
[8:37] go before or between its knees until
[8:39] Shiloh comes but he will come
[8:41] rujuta and a lion the symbol of the
[8:43] tribe of Judah has prevailed he's
[8:45] overcome and when he looked around to
[8:47] see where that lamb was he I mean so
[8:50] where that lion was he saw a lamb
[8:52] strange look for a line and see LM the
[8:54] elder called him a lion but when john
[8:57] looked he saw a lamb a lamb that have
[8:59] been slain from the foundation the world
[9:01] and lamb heaven being slammed what was
[9:03] it what was a lamb who was bloody wound
[9:05] to the lamb that had been slammed but it
[9:07] was alive again and he was bloody he
[9:10] says oh my how can you look at that
[9:11] folks remain a center a lamb stepped up
[9:13] the elders in a line has overcome the
[9:16] line of the tribe of judah and john
[9:18] looked to see see the line but there
[9:19] came a lamb shaking with blood on him
[9:22] wounds he had prevailed you could tell
[9:24] you could tell he'd been in battle had
[9:26] been slain but he was alive again John
[9:29] hadn't noticed this land before you know
[9:32] here he hadn't been mentioned before
[9:34] know where had he been mentioned John
[9:37] didn't see it all over the heavens as he
[9:39] was looking but here it came forth where
[9:42] notice where it came forth where did it
[9:44] come from it came from the Father's
[9:46] throne where he had been seated since he
[9:48] had been slain and raised again and he
[9:51] raised up and sit on the right hand of
[9:52] God ever living to make intercessions
[9:55] amen raised here today as an
[9:57] intercession with his own blood to make
[9:59] intercession upon the ignorance of the
[10:01] people oh my that's the one on depending
[10:03] upon he's still covered with bleach the
[10:06] bleach of the forgiveness of sins john
[10:08] looked at that land and the lamb looked
[10:10] like he had been slammed and then he
[10:12] noticed he was wounded cut and bruised
[10:14] and bleeding a bloody lamb that's what
[10:16] took our place isn't it isn't it strange
[10:19] a simple lamb had to take our place and
[10:21] he saw the land he proceeded out John
[10:23] hadn't seen him because he had been way
[10:25] back into the eternities even making
[10:28] intercession and showing that those who
[10:30] had come to God under the offering of
[10:32] blood of bulls and goats and
[10:34] substitution she offer ease offerings he
[10:37] also caused them had who believed that
[10:39] pointed to him and the blood had not
[10:41] been shed yet so he was there to clear
[10:44] them he was there too
[10:46] you and I and I've got a hope he's there
[10:48] tonight for every sinner the lamb had
[10:51] been slammed how can Jehovah see
[10:53] anything but that bloody lamb standing
[10:55] there and the lamb proceeded out into
[10:57] the vision now as it had been slammed
[10:59] notice come from the Father's throne I
[11:02] think weirdly advice from to the vision
[11:04] he came from glory we'd been seated at
[11:07] the right hand of God he advanced forth
[11:09] to John out of glory Oh would it not be
[11:13] a glorious singer of our sinful thoughts
[11:16] tonight could be laid aside long enough
[11:18] to accepting him he would advance all
[11:21] the way from glory tonight to make
[11:23] himself known to any on the lam
[11:24] advancing from glory for intercession
[11:27] all right to make claims now for his
[11:29] Redemption remember he had been back on
[11:32] his minute or 'i'll work back there but
[11:35] remember these seals are ready to be
[11:37] opens and the lamb came from the center
[11:39] of God advance forth he says wait till
[11:42] we get over to that space of half now
[11:44] that silent the sanctuary smoking
[11:46] there's no more intercession the
[11:47] sacrifice is left as a judgment seat
[11:49] there's no more blood on it no more for
[11:51] the blood cover the left for the blood
[11:53] covered lamb has walked away don't you
[11:56] wait till that time remember and the Old
[11:57] Testament as long as the blood was off
[12:00] the mercy seat it was judgment if as
[12:02] long as the blood was on that there was
[12:05] mercy but when the lamb walked away that
[12:07] did it where's he been maybe I'll just
[12:10] stop there he is the mercy seat it's not
[12:14] a geographical location he is the mercy
[12:16] seat but I'm said when he is hanging on
[12:18] Calvary the mercy seat was in plain view
[12:20] yes it's not a location yeah there's all
[12:24] symbolic you understand but it's not a
[12:26] location I mean he is the mercy seat
[12:29] amen and then how do you receive mercy
[12:32] you believe his word I mean you believe
[12:35] his word if you received mercy
[12:37] hallelujah what's he been he's been an
[12:41] intercessor no other person tell me
[12:43] where Mary could make a decisions
[12:45] welcome Mary off a walk at Frank's a st.
[12:48] Francis of Assisi or fro st. Celia
[12:51] rather or some other human being god
[12:53] never saw a thousand saints come out
[12:55] from the material he saw
[12:56] em lam that have been slain bloody I
[12:58] don't care how many Saints have been
[13:00] slain they were all do it but every one
[13:03] of them like the thief sit at the cross
[13:04] we've sinned we've done this but this
[13:06] man start nothing he was the only man
[13:08] that was worthy here he came from the
[13:10] inter sir intercessory box that's what's
[13:14] he coming for now watch him oh my John
[13:17] was weeping where's all that what's
[13:19] going to happen don't wake John see the
[13:20] older he comes the lyin he's the one
[13:23] prevailed and when he looked here come a
[13:25] lamb bloody that had been slammed
[13:27] anything that's killed us bloody you
[13:30] know as killed its Nick chopped open or
[13:31] something bloods all over it Here Come a
[13:34] lamb being slain and he came forth over
[13:36] my wat to make his claims on his
[13:39] Redemption allu you he says Oh mark that
[13:43] doesn't make you feel like sitting in
[13:44] the corner and sitting down and crime
[13:46] for a while it means he says now he's
[13:49] coming to claim what he died for you
[13:52] amen this is the season we are in
[13:56] hallelujah and then if you read it so
[13:59] maybe I'm know I'm just going to finish
[14:02] he says also now a revelation 6 and
[14:05] verse 1 season I saw when the lamb
[14:07] opened one of the seals and I heard as
[14:10] it were the voice of thunder one of the
[14:12] four beasts saying come and see now the
[14:15] Bible you know you read in John chapter
[14:18] 12 and Jesus a father glorify thy name
[14:21] then came there a voice from heaven
[14:23] saying I both glorified it and will
[14:25] glorify it again the people there for
[14:28] that stood by and heard it said that it
[14:30] thundered others said an angel spoke to
[14:32] who so some heard a voice and some heard
[14:34] a thunder so a thunder there is as the
[14:37] voice is not interpreted I mean so
[14:39] what's happening now is the lamb has
[14:40] taken the book and he begins to open the
[14:43] seals and there begins to speak it
[14:45] because the thunder out amen and then
[14:48] John was about to ride at Naaman your
[14:51] revelations 10 I'm just trying these
[14:53] things together but he and it and this
[14:56] is an inverse fall so revelations tenure
[14:59] of Christ mighty angel descending with
[15:00] this book that he took in five is now
[15:02] open ne-yo and he's opened it
[15:07] then it says now and when the seven
[15:08] thunders that are their voices i was
[15:10] about to write and I heard a voice from
[15:12] heaven saying unto me seal up those six
[15:14] wishes seven thunders uttered and write
[15:16] them not and in there and then it comes
[15:18] in the angel which I saw stand upon the
[15:21] scene upon the earth lifted up his hand
[15:23] to heaven and swear by him that liveth
[15:25] for ever and ever who craved the heaven
[15:27] and the things that there are now and
[15:28] the earth and the things that there are
[15:30] now and the seen and the things that
[15:32] there are now that time should be no
[15:34] longer so that no longer means this
[15:36] shall be no more delay he says but in
[15:40] the days of the voice of the seventh
[15:41] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[15:43] mysteries of God should be finished as
[15:45] he has declared to his servants the
[15:46] prophets see saying those thunders that
[15:49] were held back because John heard it but
[15:51] he's told don't write it don't release
[15:52] it he says they will not be released or
[15:55] not until the days of the voice of the
[15:57] seventh angel amen and then in those
[16:00] days he's saying now that this mighty
[16:02] angel which is Christ will descend
[16:04] emirates or some bulbs is just the Holy
[16:05] Ghost coming to the church amen and he's
[16:09] saying here that when he comes down in
[16:11] this way he says there shall be no more
[16:13] delay delay for what I'm going to wind
[16:16] up my plant I'm going to restore my
[16:18] bride to where she should be I'm going
[16:21] to get rid of Satan I'm gonna restore
[16:24] Eden there's going to be no there's been
[16:25] two thousand years well it looks like
[16:27] there's been a delay it hasn't been a
[16:30] delay you weren't there two thousand
[16:32] years ago you'll hear today your names
[16:34] are on the book Amen you had to be
[16:36] redeemed you had to come into the earth
[16:38] I'm answer now you're finally here but
[16:42] he says now I'm going to wind up my plan
[16:44] now and I'm going to release what it has
[16:47] been held back from the church amen so
[16:52] now he says when you open the first seal
[16:54] it says and it thundered what's
[16:55] happening now it's God speaking when the
[16:59] word is open it is God speaking it was a
[17:01] thunder back there but it's not a
[17:03] thunder to us because we know what it
[17:04] means become plain to us so it's not a
[17:07] thousand to you it's a voice yes event
[17:09] and you understand the voice now I'm
[17:12] just going to tie this all back together
[17:14] and maybe I need to kind of one this up
[17:17] they say my sheep hear my voice and a
[17:22] stranger they will not follow that's why
[17:24] i said in the beginning Satan knows that
[17:26] the book of redemptions being been given
[17:28] Satan knows it's been given because
[17:31] Christ didn't take it for himself he
[17:34] took it to give it to you because of
[17:37] people are people had to be restored
[17:39] back to where they should be amen but
[17:43] then Satan's is how do you know it's for
[17:45] you how do you know dominion over me
[17:49] over there as for you because he says
[17:53] it's not for you I say well how do you
[17:55] know it's for you so this is he'll come
[17:57] to say this is not for you because you
[17:59] fail you keep doing things wrong over
[18:03] and over again I just tell you this much
[18:05] as I 53 says he was wounded it says he
[18:09] was bruised for our walk iniquities he
[18:13] was bruised for our iniquities what's an
[18:16] equity to know something and not Dodd do
[18:20] it over and over again basically he was
[18:22] wounded he was bruised for our
[18:24] iniquities amen oh how can i how can I
[18:28] be a Christian he was Bruce for your
[18:31] Nick woodys go read I sofa theory that's
[18:33] the lamb a menu so I fail every day he
[18:37] was bruised for our iniquities hey we
[18:39] ain't meant that doesn't mean we should
[18:41] just keep you know I'm not advocating
[18:43] sin one but amen but sometimes we hold
[18:47] such a high standard of what we think we
[18:50] should be and Satan takes Adam beats us
[18:52] down and beats us down and beat us down
[18:54] forget it he was wounded truth can we
[18:59] just realize I 53 let's just read this
[19:02] he said well this is elementary
[19:04] sometimes we forget the power of the
[19:06] lamp Isaiah 53
[19:14] a man let's just go to let's go to verse
[19:22] one who has believed our report and to
[19:25] the end to whom is the arm of the Lord
[19:27] revealed the arm of the Lord has
[19:29] revealed to those who believe the report

[19:36] us because the arm of the Lord's been
[19:37] revealed to them yes I'm hello right
[19:39] here we are first believed our report to
[19:42] whom is the other Lord revealed for he
[19:44] shall grow up before him as a tender
[19:46] planning as a root out of the dry ground
[19:48] he has no form nor comeliness and when
[19:51] we shall see him there shall be no there
[19:53] was no beauty that we should desire him
[19:55] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[19:58] of sorrows and antiquated with grief and
[20:00] we had as it were our faces from him and
[20:03] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[20:05] surely he has borne our griefs and
[20:08] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[20:11] him stricken smitten of God and
[20:12] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[20:15] transgressions and that's where we say
[20:17] Amen and he was bruised for our
[20:21] iniquities you know Satan with your very
[20:26] early my Christian walk Satan twisted
[20:28] into my mind that it's like this after
[20:31] you know that it's wrong and you do it
[20:33] there's no more blood for you he twisted
[20:36] around in my mind and my my heart just
[20:39] sank like a lead balloon I felt those
[20:41] lobsters lost would be me because
[20:44] it's how the devil works yes amen amen
[20:48] now I came to the conclusion i can't go
[20:52] back into the world because there's
[20:54] nothing in me to want it yes you bet and
[20:56] I told the Lord well before that the end
[20:59] if he can't Smith the hell I'll tell him
[21:01] that I love him anyway I get a chance to
[21:03] stand before him on that great day and
[21:06] tell him I love and even if it costs me
[21:09] the hell off that I worst room from
[21:10] there yeah amen amen this road man but
[21:13] the devil can twist it in your mind say
[21:15] you knew it was wrong but you you did it
[21:17] therefore there's no blood for you amen
[21:19] that's a light yes event he was wounded
[21:22] for our iniquities yes amen amen
[21:26] alleluia noobest I'm so you know we have
[21:29] a land mass or so we need to remember
[21:32] that the power of our lamb I'm condemned
[21:34] I feel I can't do it we have a lamb you
[21:37] have a lamb it went on your behalf you
[21:40] shall call us them Jesus you angels head
[21:42] for he shall save his people his people
[21:45] from their sins not everyone first
[21:48] people Charlie Charlie say Amen how do
[21:52] you know it's for you one day he spoke
[21:54] to me when that became more than
[21:56] religion when that became reality
[21:59] hallelujah and what's that now that's
[22:01] the Redeemer coming forth saying i will
[22:04] save you from your son i've done it now
[22:06] i'm going to enforce it upon you
[22:08] hallelujah amen you know so we have to
[22:12] say see us walk it's not for you I say
[22:14] the reason it's for you now that Satan's
[22:17] under your feet it's because you've
[22:19] heard the word and you believe it amen
[22:23] amen that's good don't stumble over
[22:26] simplicity faith faith is the most
[22:30] revealed face now don't undermine the
[22:33] fact that you believe don't let Satan
[22:36] undermine the fact that you're a
[22:37] believer believers can only believe they
[22:42] made out for a while but I always meet
[22:44] to believe I mean Peter was always meant
[22:47] to be a believer
[22:49] just go through the Bible I always meet
[22:52] to be believers yes amen Paul he was
[22:55] meant to be a believer amen and because
[22:59] they believed abraham believed God and
[23:01] it was a tribute to him for
[23:03] righteousness amen not because he has a
[23:05] good man anything like that but he
[23:07] believed and that faith that he had
[23:10] changed his whole life and he walked in
[23:13] harmony with the program of God they
[23:16] meant evil ovary yes he knew me hello I
[23:19] trust you to put yourself in the story
[23:21] God spoke to me I believe it my whole
[23:25] life has changed I follow the program of
[23:27] God Amen hallelujah amen faith cometh by
[23:32] hearing and hearing the Word of God I'll
[23:34] pick up that some other time but you
[23:36] know faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[23:38] the Word of God hearing is not faith but
[23:43] faith is hearing because you can hear it
[23:46] people could hear it doesn't mean they
[23:47] believe it but if you truly hear it it
[23:50] anchors down here that produces faith
[23:52] amen now for him up to you know I just I
[24:00] just I just finish on this he says no he
[24:04] says in John 10 he says I'm the Good
[24:07] Shepherd and know my sheep and a known
[24:09] of mine as the father North me even so
[24:13] no other father and I lay down my life
[24:16] for the sheep and other sheep I have
[24:18] which are not of this fold them also I
[24:20] must bring and they shall hear my voice
[24:23] and there shall be one fold and one
[24:26] Shepherd so he attributed down these are
[24:29] mine because they hear my voice may
[24:31] follow me and they know me and I know
[24:33] them amen
[24:37] it's not that you know Hermits that he
[24:39] knows you amen when he was in the days
[24:43] of his flesh I just finish it when he
[24:46] was in the days of his flesh what was he
[24:48] doing he wasn't just healing a sick
[24:50] raising the dead what he was doing now
[24:53] is he kept the second Adam he is the
[24:56] second Adam and he came in flesh and all
[25:00] of his all his earthly ministry he was
[25:02] actually walking around Israel saying
[25:04] I'm the second Adam of them now I'm not
[25:07] looking for the second Eve where is she
[25:10] amen he was hunting his life yeah
[25:13] hallelujah John the Baptist was hunting
[25:15] his wife he says now them you know he
[25:18] actually identified I'm the friend of
[25:19] the bride group and he and he's the
[25:21] bridegroom you read about in the
[25:22] scripture so the whole purpose of the
[25:24] ministry was out here I am I'm the
[25:26] second Adam now I'm looking for the
[25:28] woman only I'm not going to restore the
[25:31] woman back maybe I'm now going to
[25:33] restore her to a rifle possession hurry
[25:35] and that's why when he leaks that by the
[25:38] way of Samaria he says I need to go by
[25:40] the way of Samaria to see the woman at
[25:42] the well it'll basically said is part of
[25:45] the second Eve there in sumeria I'm
[25:47] going to go find her I'm going to redeem
[25:49] her amen that's and that's why he
[25:52] whipped it well he was the deliverer
[25:54] from role but she was part of her amen
[25:58] and how was that showed she believed
[25:59] what he said amen hallelujah and never
[26:03] went back to her old life hallelujah
[26:06] amen that's why that's why he went by
[26:10] their way that's why he week plus Peter
[26:12] James and John because they were part of
[26:14] the second Eve allu you think about it
[26:18] that's why that's why God has sent his
[26:20] voice in the end time because the second
[26:23] Divas are part of the second Divas upon
[26:24] the earth amen and you have to hear the
[26:27] voice you have to become one with him so
[26:30] he sends his work and what was the
[26:33] purpose of the word is that you'd be
[26:36] united with him
[26:37] how lelu you you said and the devil says
[26:40] it's not for you I'd say too late he
[26:43] meant too late buddy you should have
[26:44] caught me years ago try to be couldn't
[26:47] get me trying to get me in religion
[26:49] tried to get me just chasing the dollar
[26:51] or something we couldn't do it ok I'll
[26:54] Lou you hey man it's just like the Eagle
[26:57] story so I was really blessed by this
[26:59] last fight you know you know the store
[27:01] i'm sure you're familiar with it mother
[27:03] Eagle Lake through X farmer came and
[27:05] took one put in the put it in the Hat
[27:07] tree there in the you know the chicken
[27:08] yard all these sinks and then this and
[27:10] then this you know this Eagle is
[27:13] hatching this chicken yard and tries to
[27:15] be like the chickens but then one day
[27:18] mom and you she laid two eggs no I'm
[27:22] sure you've heard this catalyst at times
[27:23] but the whole gospel is in the story the
[27:25] whole message is in the story because
[27:28] remember this message is a message of
[27:29] restoration to restore backup people to
[27:32] where they should be and there's and her
[27:34] mother eagles flying over the chicken
[27:36] yard because she knew she laid to thank
[27:39] God you you'd be here Amy glad you you'd
[27:42] be here and God will determine now to
[27:44] hunt you down and God found you and then
[27:47] so she look down as the head to the
[27:49] chicken yard and identified that looks
[27:52] like me down there and but this is a
[27:54] little eagle that's in a chicken yard
[27:56] who's never flawed trying to fly before
[28:00] because he's just imitated the other
[28:02] chickens have you ever seen a bird when
[28:05] it first starts to try and fly it's like
[28:08] a childhood when I start to begin to try
[28:11] and walk yes I don't get up and then
[28:13] they're busy sprinting down the hallway
[28:15] and you know a bird that's trying to
[28:17] learn to fly it doesn't just flap its
[28:19] wings and fly and saw up into the hem
[28:20] and lease its laps around it does all
[28:23] kinds of things but there's something in
[28:25] it you know when when the mother you're
[28:28] screamed out there was something in the
[28:30] baby eagle that said that's me you meant
[28:33] something because you know my sheep hear
[28:36] my voice
[28:37] and there was something in that little
[28:39] eagle that said that is me that somehow
[28:42] identify with with whip this bird in the
[28:45] air and she said now I just flap your
[28:48] wings come up with me and he said well
[28:51] I've never done that before Fletcher's
[28:52] wounds mommy gets up to the feds post it
[28:55] man he gets up to the top of the bottom
[28:56] the maybe bounces around them but then
[28:58] finally I mean the evil can fly up where
[29:02] its mother us man hallelujah now you can
[29:07] take that into the Christian and it is
[29:10] about the Christian life but what I'm
[29:11] trying to get it is there was something
[29:13] in the little eagle it was greater than
[29:16] what it perceived as failures had the
[29:19] ability to fly yes America I mean
[29:21] there's something in it that said I must
[29:23] go up there I mean I've been built to
[29:26] fly up there a menu I mean there was a
[29:28] resounding drive to get up into the
[29:32] heavens amen as the same thing with us
[29:35] hey we fall we flap around we do all
[29:37] kinds of things when we burst into the
[29:39] kingdom it doesn't matter that's
[29:40] irrelevant there you're the only
[29:43] relevant thing is that something in here
[29:44] is a deep call into the deep and
[29:46] something in you saying that's me i mean
[29:49] when i see this reveal this is me he's
[29:52] talking about me when he preaches a
[29:53] visible union Amy talks about me when he
[29:56] preaches kids when Redeemer I mean when
[29:58] he when he preaches the breach he's
[30:00] talking about me yes II Men hallelujah
[30:02] all these all these sermons all the way
[30:04] down he's talking about me when he's
[30:05] talking about adoption we're talking
[30:07] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[30:09] these things he's preaching about me
[30:10] baby alleluia amen it's something and
[30:14] you says that's me he's talking about I
[30:16] wasn't caused you to do raise up hey man
[30:19] but most of all see Satan says it's not
[30:22] for you so it's too late yes you may be
[30:24] for the foundation of the world God not
[30:27] man not you God put something in you
[30:30] then when God spoke his voice in this
[30:32] end time you'd say that's me
[30:34] yes Lord I can identify with that halloo
[30:39] you amen hallelujah maybe I just leave
[30:43] it there but that's why we could just
[30:44] rejoice so yo the devil says it's not
[30:47] for you and everything is restored
[30:49] Satan's under the believers feet it's
[30:52] not for you it is for you because my
[30:55] sheep hear my voice I mean there's
[30:57] something in the sheet that can respond
[30:59] to the Shepherd me that is all that
[31:02] matters maybe it took me probably far
[31:05] too long to say it but that's all that
[31:06] matters there's something in you see us
[31:09] yes beyond this thing you're on what you
[31:12] feel but something in your soul that
[31:14] says yes yeah I was built to be a son or
[31:17] daughter of God I will deign to be this
[31:20] way amen amen amen they don't forget it
[31:24] don't forget this service I mean if
[31:27] you're wrestling with something just
[31:28] takes eight and make a bet he doesn't
[31:30] understand it because he doesn't have it
[31:32] right he doesn't understand what I did
[31:35] the deed cooling to the thief it said
[31:37] what are you talking about the deep
[31:38] calling to think I don't have a deep
[31:40] Satan you got no deep I've got deep hey
[31:43] hallelujah I've got the right kind of
[31:45] deep Alleluia we need queer steam use
[31:48] itions coming amen amen hey we're built
[31:51] the pride is built to walk with Him in
[31:54] this alley brian is built to be fully
[31:57] restored and it has very image yes you
[31:59] man we can't be anything else Satan says
[32:03] is not for you he's a liar yes amen you
[32:05] cannot obtain to it it's already been
[32:07] given to you yes amen you know Moses was
[32:12] told what they what's in your hand he
[32:14] going to deliver Israel to Moses saying
[32:17] how am I going to do it what's in your
[32:18] hand yes he already had the judgment rod
[32:20] he had the rod that were part the Red
[32:22] Sea he had the rod that would crush
[32:24] Egypt smite Egypt he had the rod that
[32:27] had the power of creation he had those
[32:30] things here he walked with it 40 years
[32:34] maybe I know he had to stick that
[32:36] long but he he had a long time there was
[32:38] a ship and stick what have you got in
[32:41] your hand do you mean what if I got in
[32:43] my hand is just my stick God saw a
[32:46] judgment rod God saw a rod of
[32:48] deliverance and God had to open his eyes
[32:52] saying what do you really have you don't
[32:54] know what you had I'm going to tell you
[32:55] what you hit amen sometimes we forget we
[33:00] forget what we carry everybody what
[33:02] we've born with amen it's not what's in
[33:05] your hand what's in you what are you
[33:08] made of well unless this is my parents I
[33:10] go to church I believe in Jesus though
[33:12] go beyond that I believe the message go
[33:14] beyond that amen the very purpose the
[33:17] message came is to call you out even
[33:19] amen why did I call you out to become
[33:22] the bright as an eleazar call yesterday
[33:26] you know hey when a man hunts for a wife
[33:31] subconsciously he is looking for what's
[33:35] in his heart amen he's looking for to
[33:38] this heart so now when when Christ
[33:41] hunted you down when Christ found you he
[33:46] was looking for what was in his heart
[33:48] amen I mean he's looking for part of
[33:52] himself baby that's the same reason the
[33:54] days of his flesh he's a second Adam I'm
[33:56] looking for the second Heat I'm looking
[33:58] for that part of me amen hallelujah I'll
[34:03] do it and the devil says us not for you

[34:38] into this top anyway you know you fix
[34:41] that you know this message yeah please

[34:53] her and whatever a man marries is
[34:56] actually reflecting his real character
[34:58] his real nature amen to wind easily down
