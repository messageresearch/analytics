[14:00] service there and you know we may be
[14:03] we're doing our best to continue on you
[14:06] know utilizing this technology and you
[14:08] know I believe that we can have a
[14:10] glorious time amen we you guys I'm sure
[14:13] most of you were involved with the
[14:16] meetings over the weekend and we were
[14:18] just having such a tremendous time you
[14:20] know it was just like you know it was
[14:23] almost like a normal service I mean in
[14:24] this room we had the glory of God and it
[14:28] was such a good time we were really
[14:29] enjoying our time and it was it was just
[14:32] tremendous and so you know at least just
[14:35] have an expectation because it's really
[14:37] based on what we expect and so I just
[14:39] want to encourage you tonight to just
[14:42] have an expectation from the Lord that
[14:44] he will meet your needs
[14:47] the Lord is he's the word the word can
[14:49] discern our hearts and so you know just
[14:51] as much as he did it in the prophets
[14:54] discernment line the same word is with
[14:56] us tonight end
[14:58] can tell you the secrets of your heart a
[14:59] man I'm I'm just I'm just your brother
[15:03] but you know the word of the Lord is
[15:05] still the same Amen I mean still discern
[15:07] our heart so I just want to encourage
[15:09] you to just welcome the Lord to your to
[15:12] your to your chair or wherever you're at
[15:15] in your roots and your and your living
[15:17] areas I just want to you just want to
[15:19] encourage you just to invite the the
[15:22] Lord and I believe that he will meet you
[15:24] where you're at and you can leave this
[15:26] you know this this meeting that we have
[15:29] now you can be changed the Lord can meet
[15:32] your needs and I believe he will I
[15:33] really believe that he's got he wants to
[15:36] minister to us and just he wants us to
[15:38] continue on the journey and just to
[15:40] continue along the exhortation and
[15:43] encouragement that we've received over
[15:45] the weekend amen so I don't want to go
[15:49] too much in a preamble here but I just
[15:51] want to also just be I'm very grateful
[15:55] because you know this is if I'm
[15:58] remembering right Lee which is probably
[16:00] not but I believe that this is probably
[16:02] the first time I think I've ministered
[16:03] near Easter so I'm going to take my
[16:05] Liberty to preach on the resurrection
[16:13] meaning you know because it's such a
[16:15] powerful subject you know the
[16:18] resurrection in a mailer so we're so
[16:21] moved by this resurrection amen
[16:23] hallelujah well a man with that let's
[16:26] just what we'll do is we'll just stand
[16:29] and then we'll turn to John chapter 16
[16:32] verse 20 and then and the subject I want
[16:38] to approach here this evening if I want
[16:43] to if we could put a title there is and
[16:47] they rose up in the same hour and we'll
[16:51] get our text from the second reading but
[16:54] I just want to just give that the title
[16:57] before we read so we can read with the
[16:59] correct context and I want to explore
[17:03] the journey of going from disappointment
[17:08] to divine appointment amen
[17:11] go from disappointment to divine
[17:13] appointment amen hallelujah
[17:16] so John 16 verse 20 is here barely
[17:20] barely I say unto you that you shall
[17:23] weep and lament but the world shall
[17:26] rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but
[17:29] your sorrow shall be turned into joy a
[17:32] man who believes that this evening amen
[17:36] they that sow in tears shall reap and
[17:38] toward Lord Jesus I pray you and your
[17:41] blessing to the reading of your word and
[17:42] I just ask you just speak to us now
[17:45] father we just yield ourselves and ask
[17:48] Lord Jesus for a special blessing over
[17:51] the word and that you administer to our
[17:53] hearts Lord I pray father that the
[17:55] burden that you have for us and be the
[17:58] the very essence of the thought that
[18:00] you've inspired to us Lord Jesus would
[18:02] be a delivered and would be given to the
[18:05] bride and we would receive it by faith
[18:07] Lord tonight my faith Lord we believe
[18:10] Lord that you will minister to our and
[18:12] just take over this meeting Lord in
[18:14] Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you know
[18:22] the Lord comes to bring us from a poor
[18:24] sad disconnected condition into an
[18:29] emotional connection of joy in the Lord
[18:35] that we may rise and his joy to be at
[18:39] the resurrection so let's think that's
[18:43] the that's my little paragraph I've
[18:45] written in my notes just to to tie the
[18:47] context together the Lord comes to bring
[18:50] us from a poor and sad disconnected
[18:52] condition just connect that into an
[18:55] emotional connection we need to be
[18:57] emotionally connected to this of joy and
[19:00] delight in the Lord that we may rise in
[19:03] his joy to bear witness of the
[19:05] resurrection
[19:06] amen amen the resurrection that verses
[19:10] amen the resurrection that was a
[19:13] glorious resurrection but we need this
[19:15] resurrection to come into our own
[19:17] personal bubble amen
[19:20] we speak of family bubbles you know they
[19:22] had these bubbles they're talking about
[19:24] well my
[19:25] got resurrection and resurrection amen
[19:29] and I believe I'm speaking to a people
[19:32] who have has resurrection and their
[19:35] family bubble amen there is a
[19:37] resurrection verses and that is going on
[19:40] right now I want to turn now to Luke
[19:44] chapter 24
[19:45] amen and we want to read from verse 28
[19:48] down to 35 it says here you know I want
[19:54] this is where I got the context in and
[19:57] 2i there is a few things that I heard
[19:59] over the weekend which was really it
[20:01] inspired me so much and I thought mine
[20:04] you know this is this this must really
[20:08] read the scripture I this very sentence
[20:11] just spoke to me and I the Lord just
[20:13] kind of impressed that upon the area to
[20:15] to to take the subject here so this is
[20:18] and they drew nigh unto the village
[20:19] whether they went and he made as though
[20:22] he had gone further but they constrain
[20:25] him saying and by with us for as towards
[20:28] evening and the day is far spent and he
[20:31] went in to tarry with them so you notice
[20:33] they actually they they they constrain
[20:36] them to come in i man and and I
[20:39] encourage you now like in your ruse
[20:41] wherever you're at whatever condition
[20:43] you made and be ill or whatever you're
[20:45] going through you know the Lord is the
[20:48] same you know and he's the Lord's got a
[20:51] lot to do you know there's a lot of
[20:53] things doing right now so you know
[20:55] there's a lot of people that is pulling
[20:56] at him there's a lot of people praying
[20:58] there's a lot of people will need and so
[21:00] there's people that are is a fervent
[21:03] ineffectual prayer going to the Lord all
[21:06] over simultaneously it never ends it's
[21:08] always towards him there is a people
[21:11] that as as that as fervent here as a
[21:13] people that is constraining the Lord
[21:15] amen and I just encourage you what need
[21:19] you have right now I encourage you to
[21:21] constrain him because you see the Lord
[21:23] will not leave us in that condition if
[21:25] it's not the right condition he wants us
[21:28] to be in a good condition he wants us to
[21:30] be connected he wants us to be
[21:32] emotionally healthy he wants us to have
[21:34] feelings he wants us to have empathy he
[21:37] wants
[21:37] to be in the vision he wants us to be
[21:40] part of the vision doesn't want us to be
[21:42] isolated he doesn't want us to be an
[21:44] emotional disconnecting state and he
[21:47] wants us to be he wants us to have the
[21:49] joy of the Lord no matter what's
[21:51] happening no matter what storms we may
[21:54] be facing no matter what the the trauma
[21:57] of the past or whatever it may be the
[21:59] Lord wants us and has made provision for
[22:01] us to be connected and I'll show you
[22:06] here because it's very important here
[22:08] let me just continue reading it says
[22:11] here that they constrained him saying
[22:14] abide with us this evening and the day
[22:17] is fast bent amen can you say amen to
[22:19] that the day is fast been there's nearly
[22:22] time to go into Terry was there a man
[22:27] I'm so glad than a sister and it came to
[22:31] pass as he said it meet with him he took
[22:33] the bread amen it's normally when you
[22:36] get a visitor that you do the bread but
[22:42] right now you see him break the bread
[22:45] and watch what happens hallelujah amen
[22:48] amen amen
[22:49] so he says here and he said it me and he
[22:51] took the bread and blessed it and broke
[22:55] it and gave it to him hallelujah have
[22:57] you cleared that the word has been open
[22:59] and the seals have been broken and it's
[23:02] been given to you amen hey you have an
[23:05] on you have an unending an unending
[23:09] relentless powerful Seventh Seal meal to
[23:14] head all the time no matter where you
[23:17] are you can happen and you can drink and
[23:20] you can drink amen so and their eyes was
[23:23] open amen and their eyes were opened and
[23:27] they knew him and he vanished out of
[23:30] their sight maybe something happens to
[23:32] them they were impacted by by this
[23:34] reality that came to me that something
[23:37] took place for them and I believe that
[23:40] tonight maybe you're going through
[23:42] something that you need something to
[23:44] take place for you you see the Lord is
[23:46] here to meet that need the Lord is here
[23:48] to deliver the Lord is here to heal amen
[23:51] hello lujah and he says here and and and
[23:56] the eyes was open and they knew him and
[23:58] he vanished out of his sight man
[24:00] hallelujah and and they said one to
[24:03] another did not a heart burn within us
[24:05] while he talked with us and by the way
[24:07] and while he opened to us the scriptures
[24:10] come a billion Mariners and here this is
[24:13] that this is now where I get this
[24:15] thought from and they rose up the same
[24:17] hour amen it was something that took
[24:20] place in these people amen
[24:23] they were not happy before the seamen
[24:25] they were they were on a course to a
[24:29] complete emotional disconnection from
[24:31] reality they were being deep now I'm
[24:34] going to read a little bit I've been
[24:35] reading a little bit on history or
[24:37] probably know I've been reading a ton of
[24:40] them a bit of psychology just to
[24:42] understand my emotional disconnection
[24:44] and some abilities and I'm going to tie
[24:47] it into the Bible I'm gonna tie it
[24:49] because there's a lot of scriptural
[24:52] parallel so but you see these people
[24:55] wave they were so down they were not
[24:58] happy the whole world was torn apart
[25:02] Savior was gone everything was gone and
[25:05] and their lives was ruined and all their
[25:08] hopes and aspirations and they were on
[25:14] the road to a mental breakdown they were
[25:17] on the road to being they were
[25:19] overloaded was despair and down you know
[25:23] what the Lord did not want to leave and
[25:25] he doesn't want to leave youth in the
[25:27] condition that you may be in he wants
[25:29] you to go and he will do the same to you
[25:32] amen see now something happened to these
[25:35] people because now they the moment that
[25:38] he was gone Eunice is the same power
[25:40] they they rose up amen there was a
[25:44] resurrection it took place amen because
[25:46] you see the resurrected one the
[25:49] resurrected Savior the resurrected King
[25:52] he came and he revealed himself
[25:55] personally to them hallelujah and a post
[25:59] resurrection revival amen
[26:01] these guys were in a post resurrection
[26:03] revival
[26:04] amen and this revival was to bring him
[26:08] up into a higher condition that was to
[26:11] come later on at the day of the peanut
[26:14] cost 50 days later for them you see they
[26:16] were looking on to a resurrection within
[26:19] their heart but something happened to
[26:21] him in this meeting with the Seventh
[26:24] Seal himself but resurrected Savior he
[26:27] came to them and he changed their
[26:30] emotional connection and connected them
[26:33] back to be full of joy full grace and
[26:37] strength and ability and motivation and
[26:41] enthusiasm suddenly change because they
[26:44] didn't stay even though it was evening
[26:46] time even though it was dark even though
[26:49] there was you know they should be going
[26:50] to bed because of this meaning and pray
[26:58] that you don't want to go to beat either
[27:00] because you want to get up by the
[27:05] resurrected one amen the one with the
[27:07] resurrection power to change you to lift
[27:11] your spirit to lift you can meet you
[27:13] back to what you should be amen and
[27:16] God's thinking you are full of joy amen
[27:20] there is no trouble Amen God has opened
[27:24] his word to commit you back to that
[27:26] reality and so you see these people they
[27:31] rose up the same hour they were any
[27:37] longer now they had a mission
[27:38] now they were connected to a vision and
[27:41] they needed to go and return to
[27:47] Jerusalem amen hallelujah this is a good
[27:50] place to return to you see because the
[27:52] Lord would meet them there there is the
[27:54] place the heart of of the of the earth
[27:57] the heart of others around this is the
[28:00] place where God would sit on his throne
[28:02] amen they would return to the very place
[28:05] that the the Holy of Holies would be and
[28:08] should be amen even though that time
[28:10] naturally speaking there was a shadow
[28:12] that you see now God as God is dealing
[28:15] in a certain
[28:16] Python here because you see in you is a
[28:20] throne for the Lord Himself to come and
[28:23] live amen amen so they returned to
[28:25] Jerusalem they returning to the heart of
[28:28] the man and they're returning to where
[28:30] the people are they're returning to come
[28:32] back into the vision they went from
[28:34] being sad down the spear disconnected
[28:38] completely confused not knowing what to
[28:41] do and then the Seventh Seal himself
[28:43] came personally to them because they
[28:46] were thinking about him and when you
[28:48] think about him he comes to you it's not
[28:50] a catchphrase a prophet doesn't just say
[28:52] it's a waste word will make you feel
[28:54] good
[28:55] he's meaning it's true that's a reality
[28:57] keep your mind on the Lord keep your
[29:00] mind on Jesus Christ the Lord with joy
[29:05] you shall draw waters from the wells of
[29:07] salvation with joy
[29:10] you shall draw borders from the wells of
[29:12] salvation who wants to drink from the
[29:14] wells of salvation tonight will make
[29:16] your joy profound amen hallelujah I was
[29:20] laughing in a good way
[29:22] of course when brother now Jason he was
[29:25] preaching my goodness on those
[29:27] resonances we just love that you know
[29:42] joy joy will sit before him you know
[29:45] that's why he went and paid for your
[29:47] suit because you were the joy and you
[29:50] see now that he's revealed it to you
[29:52] causes you to stop vibrating in a
[29:55] certain way it causes you to stop having
[29:57] a certain emotion amen and maybe that
[30:00] emotion has been blocked up by something
[30:02] maybe that emotion maybe it been through
[30:05] many things and you had many of us along
[30:07] we walk in listed the diplomatist to
[30:10] just beat things into US and and cool
[30:12] things up from the past but there is a
[30:14] grace here right now to reconnect you to
[30:18] take those blockages and lock them amen
[30:21] only God can do it only God knows how
[30:24] you see it's the matter of allowing him
[30:27] to do it
[30:28] amen
[30:29] you see before resurrection in your own
[30:31] life there must be a death you see there
[30:34] was a disc before the resurrected one
[30:36] comes of him he died himself but he
[30:39] overcame it he rose again and men who
[30:41] came to him but you see for them to
[30:44] actually receive that resurrection for
[30:47] them to actually be a beneficiary of
[30:49] that resurrection it would must be a
[30:51] death and if you want your problems in
[30:54] your life to be unblocked and you want
[30:57] those channels to be open so that you
[30:59] can resume that same joy as the king
[31:02] there so that you can be a resonance so
[31:06] that you can resonate the very joy in
[31:08] the Lord then you have to die to your
[31:11] ambitions you need to die to your own
[31:14] good works to your own dreams you need
[31:17] to die to your ministry you need to die
[31:19] to everything so that he can lead so
[31:22] that he can move so that he can keep you
[31:24] in there ever-present prisons you see
[31:37] now now I want to just get to this
[31:40] little bit here in verse 24 in verse 33
[31:44] it says here it returns a Jerusalem and
[31:46] found the eleven gathered together and
[31:48] then that were with him saying the Lord
[31:52] is risen indeed
[31:53] amen and has appeared to Simon and they
[31:58] told what things were done in the way
[32:00] and how he was not one of them in
[32:02] breaking the bread do you know what I
[32:05] love about this and when I was reading
[32:06] it the Lord kind of just he just brought
[32:09] it to my attention you see it wasn't
[32:11] just them that was getting the
[32:13] revelation it wasn't just clear a person
[32:15] his friend that was receiving all the
[32:17] revelation of the seven seals and
[32:19] everything know the same seventh seal
[32:21] the same one he was down in Jerusalem he
[32:23] was ministering to Peter it was
[32:25] ministering to Mary he was down at
[32:27] mathur they he went to the people he was
[32:30] ministering to them all to bring them up
[32:32] just like he's ministering in Oakland
[32:34] ministering the tower in South Africa
[32:36] ministering in Wellington it's a unit
[32:40] Ministry of the captain himself bringing
[32:43] everybody together that's why when you
[32:45] look online when you see what's being
[32:47] preached it's the same it's the same
[32:49] Jesus in a post resurrection revival
[32:52] amen this first resurrection revival not
[32:56] that one
[32:56] remember we've got a different later I'm
[32:59] holding the back I want to show you
[33:02] something very great here and I'm just
[33:04] gonna say one little thing about it
[33:06] right now because I feel impressed to do
[33:07] this is you see their post resurrection
[33:10] revival the Holy Ghost hadn't even been
[33:13] poured out yet so they only had the
[33:15] Corporal they had the copper words of
[33:17] not saying I'm not diminishing them
[33:19] because this is a powerful event that
[33:21] see the resurrection was within them to
[33:24] take them to the resurrection was he the
[33:28] visitation of God was to take them and
[33:30] reconnect them to bring them to the
[33:32] Upper Room to receive the Holy Ghost now
[33:35] we're in the post resurrection revival
[33:38] we are in a revival now with the Holy
[33:40] Ghost with the open book with the Lord
[33:43] Himself within our lives to take us off
[33:46] the earth this is a first resurrection
[33:49] revival you are in a post resurrection
[33:52] revival the greatest revival that is in
[33:55] a struck the earth there is nothing like
[33:58] this now why don't you die to yourself
[34:02] die to everything else and around the
[34:05] joy of the Lord to come and connect you
[34:13] we need the Lord amen it's time to be
[34:16] more serious with God it's time to allow
[34:19] him amen the resurrected one to take
[34:22] those things how to remove all the
[34:24] blockages a man and I can tell you none
[34:27] of us is exempt from roughing just
[34:29] because we are in the earth with humans
[34:36] there is a divine position to minister
[34:40] to you just allow them let them do it
[34:42] let them help you with your life amen
[34:46] this is the hour this is the hour amen
[34:49] we have all of those things that to be
[34:52] hallelujah amen because we want to leave
[34:55] the city do you want to leave who wants
[34:57] to leave
[34:58] who's ready amen I think we were singing
[35:01] that song over the weekend are you ready
[35:04] for Jerusalem
[35:05] are you ready because I really like that
[35:15] foot I was just thinking yes Lord
[35:19] take me I'm ready for Jerusalem amen
[35:23] amen
[35:26] so I just like to just highlight that
[35:29] there just highlight that point there
[35:31] that the Lord was not just dealing with
[35:33] Cleopas but he was dealing with Peter he
[35:36] was he was he was he had appeared to
[35:38] this one and appeared to that one and
[35:40] down here to Mary he was called bringing
[35:42] it all together
[35:43] see we have a unique experience here
[35:48] because this message is not a
[35:49] denomination this message has not been
[35:52] taken over by fallen angels and
[35:54] controlled by some hierarchy of Rome or
[35:57] hierarchy in Germany or in England this
[35:59] this messages as a person Amen it's an a
[36:03] revelation of a resurrected Jesus Christ
[36:05] and he is leading this whole thing he is
[36:08] the five-star general he has the vision
[36:10] completely sorted he has all of the
[36:13] battlefront all perfectly amen what we
[36:17] need to do is fall into rank fall into
[36:19] our possession amen allow the captain to
[36:25] give us the direction and we stand still
[36:27] and we wait until he sees done and then
[36:30] we stop when he says stop amen when the
[36:33] purifier move they moved wait a man the
[36:46] Bible was very explicitly declares that
[36:49] we must wait on the Lord waiting on the
[36:52] ministry amen wait and allow Him to
[36:55] unfold the mystery of his will to unfold
[36:59] the things that are to be a May because
[37:01] specially the same this is an age
[37:05] cannot be cook it out my man we're not
[37:07] in a man agent launching anymore amen
[37:09] we have accumulated above the manege
[37:11] anointing we've risen opportunity to
[37:13] anointing amen
[37:15] and the evil anointing is connected to
[37:17] the very hit himself divine love
[37:20] amen is leading the way so why don't you
[37:23] lick divine love lead you amen oh well
[37:31] this continued on
[37:33] amen this is here I thought I would make
[37:37] that clear there when he comes and
[37:39] breaks his bread to you you will rise
[37:41] the same hour just like David and you
[37:45] may be generally were in a place where
[37:47] we we would connect us connected from
[37:49] all these different things and yet when
[37:51] he comes it makes the difference we will
[37:54] rise in that hour amen and I believe I
[37:56] was speaking to a lot of people here
[37:58] that have risen people that have sealed
[38:03] come to them amen and they had been so
[38:07] moved so impacted by the word so
[38:10] impacted by this great one that has
[38:13] broken the breed in their own homes
[38:14] I believe you're experiencing the
[38:17] breaking of bread even now in your house
[38:19] amen as you sit with your family as you
[38:22] had Bible studies with your children
[38:24] issue issues listen to the message and
[38:27] then he comes amen when he comes this
[38:30] what makes the difference I encourage
[38:33] you don't expect anything less than him
[38:36] to come and make these things real amen
[38:41] that's what will make you more like him
[38:43] that's what will change the hard things
[38:45] to change inside you
[38:47] amen those things that frustrate you
[38:49] those things and you fail there's a
[38:53] reason he's trying to show you just
[38:59] humble yourself a man reach out
[39:01] hallelujah reach out and touch him amen
[39:10] how to approach the battle he's the
[39:13] five-star channel don't try to figure it
[39:15] out you know and I might be eating my
[39:17] own roots here
[39:18] don't read a big psychological paper to
[39:20] try and get your seven steps to freedom
[39:22] but amen amen
[39:25] they might be a bit of an oxymoron but
[39:27] we're going to actually we're just going
[39:29] to look at them and I'm just going to
[39:30] parallel just to show you I want to
[39:32] expose the the this this thing this
[39:36] emotional detachment and I know brother
[39:38] Ben he brought it out I think I had too
[39:45] much salt in my pizza sorry
[39:52] amen hallelujah it's pretty warm in here
[39:55] actually I thought I was calm before but
[39:57] you will amen
[40:00] you know there there Matthew 28 you know
[40:04] we're talking about the resurrection the
[40:07] arena or the post resurrection revival
[40:09] and I just want to show you what
[40:11] resurrection we're in and we've heard
[40:13] this I've preached it we've heard this
[40:16] many many times many times but I just
[40:19] want to lay a little context here you
[40:21] see then Matthew 28 revival there the
[40:24] revival they were in was an angel an
[40:27] angel a mighty angel came down amen
[40:30] he came down and he opened the Roman
[40:32] seal they sealed the tomb with a Roman
[40:35] centurion cartoonian or even they call
[40:38] it and so it was sealed
[40:40] you know the Pharisees they went to
[40:42] Pilate and their religious blindness and
[40:46] they said old they're gonna see they
[40:48] might try to see the people you see they
[40:51] might try and deceive the people so let
[40:53] us make the tube sure you know and
[40:55] Pilate said whatever you need whatever
[40:59] you need just make it sure as you can
[41:01] and you see now if we take this now and
[41:04] spiritualize it because I believe we're
[41:06] a spiritual people and we should
[41:08] spiritual eyes and look at the bigger
[41:10] picture here and and you see now they
[41:13] had all the power of Rome behind them
[41:15] the power of road was used to seal the
[41:19] resurrection within the walls of the
[41:21] tomb you see now that was sealed over
[41:24] and died of a of soldiers and it rock
[41:28] but you see you cannot
[41:31] tane the life of God when the life of
[41:34] God is to be expressed that will break
[41:37] through any man-made wall dungeon rock
[41:41] Roman seals whatever it may be it will
[41:44] break through the white horse rider will
[41:46] break through the red horse rider will
[41:47] break through the black and the pale or
[41:50] together all of Satan's homes and so you
[42:00] see when God has made a man and you see
[42:07] now in their revival the angel comes
[42:09] down and he opens the seal breaks the
[42:13] seal and releases the life so that these
[42:16] people could come into their
[42:17] resurrection amen so that these people
[42:19] could come out and come up into their
[42:22] position and use and you see so that's
[42:24] their revival in a had a corporal
[42:26] visitation of Jesus Christ amen
[42:29] now our revival and parallel to this our
[42:34] revival parallels this bitumen in a
[42:37] slightly different in a spiritual sense
[42:39] because you see over the last seven
[42:42] church ages the Roman demon powers
[42:46] managed to pull over the people's eyes
[42:49] the lies and the evil religious ways and
[42:53] mixed paganism into Christianity until
[42:56] the the Veil the veil had come back over
[42:59] and the people couldn't see and the
[43:02] identity was lost and so the Roman seal
[43:05] was over the power of the Resurrection
[43:08] and the prophecies that the power of the
[43:11] Holy Ghost was bound by the creeds and
[43:14] doctrines of man it was bad and it
[43:17] couldn't be released because in his film
[43:19] Asia even though it was the Holy Spirit
[43:21] in them said even though was the Holy
[43:23] Spirit and Wesley even though was the
[43:25] Holy Spirit in the Pentecostal age but
[43:27] it couldn't be fully released because of
[43:29] dumb ism and far funny Roman seals over
[43:34] the power of the word and told in 1963
[43:39] amen and mighty angel came down
[43:41] hallelujah and broke the seal
[43:48] I'm talking to you this is the one that
[44:16] comes amen
[44:18] this is the resurrection this
[44:20] resurrection and he says this one comes
[44:24] to you then you will know that I'm in my
[44:26] father in your need and I'm a new
[44:29] uranium part of me amen
[44:37] because you see it is the visitation of
[44:40] this one the visitation of this one when
[44:44] it comes to you you can receive your
[45:05] surrender
[45:06] he's looking for someone who's willing
[45:11] to lay everything down amen so that
[45:13] resurrected living Savior that was
[45:16] released like a mighty river come and
[45:24] wash you and come and change you give
[45:27] you life come and take you and can make
[45:30] you back to who you are can make you to
[45:32] the beautiful Jerusalem can meet you to
[45:35] your eternity connect you to your real
[45:38] self connect you to the heaven of God
[45:42] the City of God why do you think you'll
[45:45] own you know for that city like Abraham
[45:48] in the time and now here we are with our
[45:52] longing in our heart amen we have a
[45:54] longing debated because we're part of
[45:56] that city
[45:58] we're part of it amen
[46:01] hello Lou you and so this is what a
[46:04] great resurrection that was but what a
[46:06] glorious resurrection bishops and people
[46:09] being quickened a man by the power of
[46:11] the Resurrection
[46:12] it is the rising of the Sun amen what a
[46:16] resurrection that was and what a
[46:18] resurrection this is it's the visitation
[46:26] of this one the same one that visited
[46:30] Cleopas would make constrained him in
[46:32] that same one comes not Anna's corporal
[46:35] glorified body this up in heaven that is
[46:38] theophany it is word body in him in the
[46:41] word the word comes to the Spirit of God
[46:43] bonus of it comes to you to break the
[46:46] bread to you to raise you up from
[46:49] despair to raise you up from darkness to
[46:51] raise you up from confusion to raise you
[46:54] up from all of the ailments and all of
[46:56] the sudden that whatever the devil has
[46:58] made you to bring you can meet you to
[47:01] who you are to connect you to
[47:03] righteousness to connect you to holiness
[47:05] to commit you to the vision amen and you
[47:09] see when they take that visitation they
[47:12] went straight to work they didn't delay
[47:15] they were connected again to the burden
[47:18] of the Spirit you see the Spirit has a
[47:20] burden burden for his people the Lord is
[47:24] crying out people the Lord wants his
[47:26] people save and if we're not feeling
[47:29] that way there is a blockage somewhere
[47:32] there is something distracting us there
[47:34] is something that is blocking the
[47:36] channels can come to you tonight and
[47:42] reconnect you to them to meet you to the
[47:47] embassy amen to the emotion of the Holy
[47:51] Ghost amen
[47:56] so that you care for the lost you care
[47:59] for the work of God so that you care for
[48:01] your posture you care for your family
[48:03] you care for your people and you see
[48:06] many times we want to
[48:09] to kid we intellectually we care there's
[48:12] something blocking the heart stopping us
[48:15] from truly entrusting to care so that we
[48:20] can truly can meet so we can truly be a
[48:24] friend so that we can truly be a dad so
[48:26] that we can truly be a brother so that
[48:28] we can truly be a wife or a sister they
[48:31] may you see it takes the resurrected
[48:35] ones it takes them he's the one that
[48:38] will give us our connection brother
[48:44] Branham says this and the voice of the
[48:46] side he says now notice when then when
[48:49] his presence is near that certainly it
[48:52] brings emotion as I spoke this morning
[48:56] anything without emotion is dead and any
[48:59] religion that hasn't got some emotion to
[49:02] it you'd better be rien if did it brings
[49:05] emotion he quickens us but when we are
[49:09] cooking just remember what quickened us
[49:11] amen those whose side of what happened
[49:14] look unto the rock from which your human
[49:16] a man in the pit we sure did amen
[49:19] remember you see as he's an important
[49:22] part of that it keeps you humble it
[49:24] keeps you grateful
[49:25] don't forget what the Lord has done for
[49:28] you always think almost and write songs
[49:30] about those things write poems about
[49:32] those things give them praise when you
[49:34] pray you see when the prophets prayed
[49:36] and the Bible and when when people pray
[49:39] under inspiration they remind God in
[49:41] themselves and the people of the
[49:43] glourious also now God is wonderful as
[49:49] mercies and they relive the the the
[49:52] emotion of it and they get in the spirit
[49:55] because of it because they're connected
[49:57] in the spirit to the very heart of God
[50:01] remember Jesus is the heart of God amen
[50:04] hallelujah is he connected to the
[50:07] feeling of the people the feeling amen
[50:12] it's important amen now we don't want to
[50:15] live by feelings but we want to be led
[50:18] by his feelings we want to be
[50:19] his emotion he gives us he will give you
[50:24] a burden according to you calling and
[50:27] calling to your election and calling to
[50:29] your office according to what he wants
[50:31] you to do that's why it's so important
[50:34] that you wait long enough to let him
[50:39] speak he says here remember let's
[50:48] remember what quickened us what did it
[50:51] that's the presence of the Holy Spirit
[50:53] Jesus Christ in Hamid's showing himself
[50:56] that he is alive you see what he did
[50:59] when when when wind Cleophus Peter Mary
[51:04] and all of these ones when they saw that
[51:08] he was alive they said they couldn't
[51:10] there was so much joy they were so happy
[51:13] now we must remember that and don't
[51:15] forget those moments don't forget those
[51:17] times
[51:18] amen hallelujah because they will bring
[51:20] joy back to you they will the
[51:22] remembrance of those things amen
[51:24] will actually bring you back so that you
[51:27] can have more testimonials so that you
[51:29] can have more supernatural amen like
[51:31] sister Belinda song expect the
[51:33] supernatural even now in the service
[51:37] expect the supernatural let this be a
[51:41] journey for you
[51:42] let must be a time where you go from one
[51:45] place to another not because of me
[51:48] because of the Lord because this is the
[51:51] message and I pray to the Lord I said
[51:57] what when I read these quotes and if I
[51:59] can only get through them if I can read
[52:01] these quotes and you will be as if you
[52:04] know we were there and the Prophet was
[52:05] speaking under the same inspiration and
[52:07] the people could receive it my faith
[52:10] there is some journeys that we can take
[52:12] tonight we can take a journey tonight we
[52:14] don't have to stay the way we are we
[52:16] don't have to remain like this you see
[52:19] we're right at the end amen and the
[52:21] devil may be loosed and he may be rented
[52:23] on this world and he may even be rented
[52:25] in your life you may be failing a lot
[52:27] right now there's a reason for it
[52:29] he needs to be exposed he needs to be
[52:31] gone any luck
[52:33] we'll deliver your enemies into your
[52:35] hands enemies gone amen
[52:43] just think about that the world is the
[52:45] same amen amen
[52:55] heaven expectation for the supernatural
[52:57] amen okay now let me read this sorry
[53:07] it's going to be a few terms in here but
[53:09] I will try and explain some of them I
[53:11] don't even know so but I'm I skip over a
[53:14] button so any a little bits just one
[53:16] paragraph to paragraph says here this is
[53:20] I want to expose emotional detachment
[53:23] whether it is just a mind a little bit
[53:25] or it's major emotional detachment may
[53:29] not be as outwardly obvious as other
[53:31] psychiatric symptoms people experiencing
[53:34] emotional detachment have a reduced
[53:36] ability to express emotion to empathize
[53:40] with others or to form powerful
[53:42] emotional connections you see that Lundy
[53:45] has struck me I thought my we need to be
[53:49] able to form powerful emotional
[53:52] connections with each other
[53:55] with our family and with specially with
[53:57] God now if you cannot form a powerful
[54:00] emotional connection normally and I'm
[54:04] telling you now most of us suffer with
[54:06] us it's hard because the world we live
[54:07] in
[54:07] it's very difficult parent all neglect
[54:11] whatever it may be nor traumatic
[54:13] experiences are just the world the devil
[54:14] has shaped this world so there's hardly
[54:16] love myth no love left you know apart
[54:19] from in the bride but you see we're
[54:21] struggling because we came out of that
[54:22] and now we've got to be teens now our
[54:24] mindsets are got to be changed so that
[54:26] we can't love so that we can be a real
[54:29] friend so that we can develop deep
[54:31] emotional connections with people amen
[54:34] like a bond see this guy here he's a
[54:36] real inspiration to me he just seems to
[54:39] be able to just connect and be
[54:41] emotionally connected with people easily
[54:43] you know and I like that and I believe
[54:46] the
[54:46] is a testimony and an example that we
[54:50] can aspire to Manasa lord help me Lord
[54:53] Jesus to be able to love people and
[54:55] express their love without any sort of
[54:58] funny feelings inside me because you see
[55:00] if we shouldn't have those funny feeling
[55:02] we should be able to love people you
[55:04] know sometimes you know you know one of
[55:06] the biggest things the trauma of losing
[55:08] somebody maybe you've lost a father
[55:10] you lost the best friend of you lost a
[55:12] mother or sister whatever and you know
[55:14] that traumatic experience overload of
[55:17] emotion caused you to not be able to
[55:20] connect with people anymore because you
[55:22] don't want to be hurt like that again
[55:23] you know those things but the Lord wants
[55:26] us to be able to connect the game you
[55:28] see we have to go through these
[55:30] traumatic experiences we must overcome
[55:32] those things and maybe here is your
[55:34] maybe tonight you need ask the Lord to
[55:37] heal you of that maybe this is rooted
[55:39] out to the surface you can feel the pain
[55:41] that you went through in their head just
[55:43] for a little bit you know you just come
[55:52] out feel it over and then pray to that
[55:58] channel so you can form a deep emotional
[56:00] connection a man is very important says
[56:03] here to empathize with others or to
[56:06] inform powerful emotional connections
[56:08] they are also at an increased risk for
[56:11] many anxiety and stress disorders this
[56:14] can lead to difficulties in creating it
[56:16] maintaining personal relationships you
[56:20] know this is now we're talking these
[56:22] extreme levels of us but there's also
[56:23] small levels of it and it can hinder our
[56:26] relationship of God as you see we need
[56:28] to be able if we can't form a powerful
[56:30] connection with people then it's
[56:32] definitely we cannot form that powerful
[56:35] connection with the Lord because we are
[56:37] the same person whether it's an
[56:38] emotional connection to God or people
[56:40] you see and even though consciously you
[56:43] want to consciously you love to
[56:45] consciously you believe everything God
[56:47] says and you believe in you trust them
[56:49] but it's the harness down in the debts
[56:51] it's down in their subconscious where
[56:53] you cannot you know that's the place
[56:55] brother brand which is that's where the
[56:57] trouble lies there is right down
[56:59] that's the one that controls the ship
[57:03] down there say no right because of
[57:06] something that happened keeping you guys
[57:10] anxieties or fears or some traumatic
[57:13] experience but I'm telling you that

[57:37] journey together and we're going to be
[57:39] raptured together we're not condemning
[57:53] each other it's not a judgment rumors
[57:56] when we look at one you know like maybe
[57:59] you shouldn't you know you opening up
[58:00] your weaknesses like that you see where
[58:04] is a transparency so that we can be
[58:06] delivered so that we can be open about
[58:09] it
[58:09] amen so that we can be free from these
[58:12] things amen don't hide the devil don't
[58:16] hide those things in your life amen if
[58:18] your subconscious is going the wrong way
[58:20] the Lord is here to touch them and you

[58:25] at right now the very thing that you may
[58:27] be going through right now that's

[58:31] like me will seem us to help you was
[58:32] that he wants what he was causing me to
[58:45] free right now

[58:52] services to serve the hearts that same
[58:55] angel came down to me amen
[58:57] that same spirit the Spirit of God he
[58:59] came down to me oh my and it quickened
[59:02] me cooking name it quicken hey man I
[59:06] rose up in the same

[59:24] but you can be cooking from those little
[59:26] ones to receive it in the name of Jesus
[59:32] receive your liberation come out so that
[59:38] he can come in' amen okay I'm gonna read
[59:46] from now on otherwise we never get
[59:48] through it amen
[59:49] the person may are here this can lead to
[59:56] difficulties in creating and maintaining
[59:58] personal relationships the person may
[1:00:01] move elsewhere in their mind and appear
[1:00:04] preoccupied or not entirely prison well
[1:00:08] they may seem fully prison but exhibited
[1:00:11] purely intellectual behavior when
[1:00:14] emotional behavior would be appropriate
[1:00:17] I'm going to say anything but anyway can
[1:00:23] I repeat that anyway just for a bit of a
[1:00:24] bit
[1:00:25] this can lead to difficult oh where are
[1:00:28] we they may have this is a person that's
[1:00:32] struggling with emotional disconnect
[1:00:34] they may have a hard time being a loving
[1:00:38] family member all they may exhibit
[1:00:45] purely intellectual behavior when
[1:00:49] emotional behavior would be appropriate
[1:00:52] let's think about your experiences in
[1:00:56] the church with everything's going on
[1:01:00] and everyone's having to to believe
[1:01:01] you're just feeling you don't feel
[1:01:03] anything but you enjoying the
[1:01:05] information maybe they send emotional
[1:01:08] disconnection somewhere you're not
[1:01:10] feeling it because you see a human being
[1:01:12] we may feel an overwhelming ocean
[1:01:15] something's gonna happen an overwhelming
[1:01:18] emotion causes a man to cry amen
[1:01:21] an overwhelming emotion this is it this
[1:01:24] is a mechanism they don't even
[1:01:26] understand what crying really is I try
[1:01:28] to find out and I'm so surprised that
[1:01:30] that the world of research doesn't
[1:01:34] really understand crying I just somehow
[1:01:38] something that me was like you know
[1:01:39] crying is when your emotions you cry you
[1:01:45] release it's a relief and if you can't
[1:01:48] cry about something is something wrong
[1:01:50] if the word comes to you you can
[1:01:53] something happens in difference tears is
[1:01:55] a connection but it's purely
[1:01:58] intellectual and you're enjoying the
[1:02:00] information and we passed a man age
[1:02:03] remember we passed the manager Eagle
[1:02:06] literacy into the hot dog so we can be
[1:02:09] connected to the emotion of the spirit
[1:02:12] so that we can feel what he feels that
[1:02:15] our heart can be broken for this is a
[1:02:18] man you see but you see when the spirit
[1:02:21] is groaning and you can feel it you know
[1:02:24] we think of how the spirit is groaning
[1:02:26] in our lives but we don't feel anything
[1:02:29] well he's not feeling it should be with
[1:02:33] him connected to the heart of the person
[1:02:40] praying in the service the person
[1:02:43] preaching in the service the same God
[1:02:45] that is inspiring the preacher inspiring
[1:02:48] the prayer inspiring the song special
[1:02:51] the same God you should be connected to
[1:02:54] him connected to whom should I say
[1:02:56] connected in your heart but you see this
[1:02:59] world the devil has done as opposed to
[1:03:02] disconnect humanity to disconnect them
[1:03:05] from salvation this can make them from
[1:03:07] each other just connect them by these
[1:03:10] Hollywood games and all of the YouTube
[1:03:13] narratives and Hollywood even existing
[1:03:15] it was a YouTube man you know I
[1:03:16] shouldn't use Hollywood any my talking
[1:03:20] about you know YouTube and all of these
[1:03:22] the social the these these are when he
[1:03:26] call those famous social people that
[1:03:28] have those millions of followers you
[1:03:31] know those ones they just all it's doing
[1:03:34] disconnecting you from the Tree of Life
[1:03:37] yes disconnecting you in your mind it's
[1:03:39] disconnecting you but the Lord wants you
[1:03:41] to be convicted to him hallelujah
[1:03:44] but you choose we choose we choose what
[1:03:47] we allow to come in
[1:03:49] amen so cease here they may seem fully
[1:03:54] prison but exhibit they may have a hard
[1:03:58] time being a loving family member or
[1:04:00] they may avoid activities places and
[1:04:02] people associated with past traumas they
[1:04:06] this their disassociation can lead to
[1:04:12] lack of attention and hints to memory
[1:04:16] problems and extreme cases amnesia in
[1:04:19] some cases they present and extreme
[1:04:22] difficulty in giving or receiving
[1:04:24] empathy who knows what empathy is
[1:04:27] empathy is the ability to enter into
[1:04:30] someone else's burden or pain amen
[1:04:34] and and it's a very important part of
[1:04:37] our Christian walk really is you know
[1:04:41] brother BAM sees a missus when I pray
[1:04:44] for the people I need a feel for them I
[1:04:46] need a love there Michael don't be sorry
[1:04:48] for them I've got to be some etheric
[1:04:50] compassion but if you cannot if there's
[1:04:53] something wrong if you've had a hard
[1:04:55] upbringing you've been abused in some
[1:04:57] way and you struggle with that then it's
[1:05:01] hard for you to enter into someone's
[1:05:02] moon it's hard because empathy is a
[1:05:05] sensitive thing it's it's a softness in
[1:05:08] the spirit of your life and you see when
[1:05:10] when you when you get hurt those things
[1:05:12] shut off like a clamp but I can tell you
[1:05:15] right now if you just reach out to God
[1:05:17] in this moment under this inspiration
[1:05:20] and if the in the presence of the Lord
[1:05:22] if you just environment he can help you
[1:05:24] right now he can change that right now
[1:05:26] he can help you in your place
[1:05:29] so that you can be a good dad or in good
[1:05:31] mom so that you can feel for your
[1:05:33] children amen so that you can have an
[1:05:35] emotional connection to the vision of
[1:05:38] God and when people do things wrong you
[1:05:40] can see beyond and you can see that it's
[1:05:43] just the devil and you can love them
[1:05:45] anyway because there's empathy
[1:05:47] an emotional connection it's not just
[1:05:53] let me read this emotional detachment
[1:05:57] often rises due to psychological trauma
[1:06:00] and early years for example children who
[1:06:03] were raised in abusive or neglectful
[1:06:05] environments are more likely to
[1:06:06] experience emotional detachment as
[1:06:08] adults antidepressants have also been
[1:06:14] known to cause emotional blunting now I
[1:06:17] was writing down further in these notes
[1:06:19] whom I mean there's a lot more notes
[1:06:20] there and I don't think we're going to
[1:06:21] touch that but so I'll touch it now it
[1:06:23] just came to me while I was writing
[1:06:24] about emotional blackness and then I was
[1:06:27] like do you know what you may not be
[1:06:29] prescribed some antidepressant from some
[1:06:32] psychologists but you may be prescribing
[1:06:34] yourself antidepressants that are
[1:06:36] outside of the valley they are taken
[1:07:39] seize here emotional blunting you see it
[1:07:42] might not you might still have emotions
[1:07:44] I still get angry and might still have a
[1:07:46] few happy times here and there but you
[1:07:48] see there's a blunting there her glance
[1:07:50] and over you know this this sensitive
[1:07:53] stuff going on inside here but that man
[1:07:56] really can't touch in the devil he has
[1:08:01] ruined the human race he's ruined the
[1:08:04] socio patents the social patterns of
[1:08:07] humanity he's ruined the human spirit
[1:08:10] he's ruined the love of humans on he's
[1:08:15] ruined everything
[1:08:16] this is the best he could do just think
[1:08:20] about that this is it this is it this is
[1:08:32] this is the seals is open in your life a
[1:09:04] man you may be crying down one of the
[1:09:07] elders come to you and say weak not
[1:09:12] Judas prevailed and he came down and
[1:09:17] he's revealing himself to his people so
[1:09:20] say you're free hey I'm risen again the
[1:09:27] resurrected Living God I paid it all and
[1:09:31] now come to get you I come to say
[1:09:33] there's no more time for crying away the
[1:09:36] tears on your eyes so that you can have
[1:09:38] joy amen we don't want to be blunt we
[1:09:49] don't want to be blunted over by the
[1:09:50] antidepressants whether you're getting
[1:09:52] prescribed them it's going to blunt you
[1:09:54] over or whether or whether you're taking
[1:09:58] some other form of antidepressant but
[1:10:00] let me tell you there is a person this
[1:10:04] is an exodus fun to remain no reason
[1:10:09] just faith just believe believe them get
[1:10:14] down to the problem in your life so that
[1:10:16] you can be changed
[1:10:18] amen none of us are exempt none of us
[1:10:21] can hide none of us can hide from the
[1:10:24] need of the Lord right now in our home
[1:10:28] in our life hey you may not even know
[1:10:31] that is something wrong with you
[1:10:32] maybe you've lied to yourself too long
[1:10:35] but you see it's time now that all of it
[1:10:37] cast ago we're gonna die to ourselves
[1:10:40] we're gonna die to our reasoning we're
[1:10:42] gonna die to our memories we're gonna
[1:10:44] die to all that all of the imagination
[1:10:49] conscience reasoning and all of that
[1:10:52] stuff it needs to die it needs to die so
[1:10:55] that God can be enthroned in your mind
[1:10:57] amen he's the antidepressant he is just
[1:11:01] a complete opposite of depression a man
[1:11:13] nobody is too far nobody's done too much
[1:11:17] if you've still got a desire for God
[1:11:20] right now you haven't gone too far you
[1:11:22] haven't crossed the line heaven cross
[1:11:25] the line you can be saved right now you
[1:11:27] can be filled right now you can be from
[1:11:35] you can go from disappointment to divine
[1:11:38] appointment see for you to come into
[1:11:41] divine appointment you need a visitation
[1:11:43] and when you get a visitation you're
[1:11:45] gonna be connected because God doesn't
[1:11:48] want you to literally be part of us
[1:11:50] missing he doesn't election learn this
[1:11:53] lesson to actually go and preach to
[1:11:57] actually go and outreach he wants you to
[1:11:59] be emotionally connected to the spirit
[1:12:03] the heel using your subconscious and
[1:12:06] your conscious in your heart everybody
[1:12:08] your life they will see you to have
[1:12:10] dominion he was so hot to be like a
[1:12:12] Garden of Eden to be a war-torn
[1:12:15] wilderness he doesn't want it to be a
[1:12:17] lunar miss anymore amen you may think
[1:12:20] it's a
[1:12:26] [Applause]
[1:12:41] it's time to rise because the one is
[1:12:44] risen has come to make you rise to by
[1:12:51] how we doing for time almost up okay
[1:12:56] Alleluia let me get down to this you see
[1:13:00] they had drug abuse especially marijuana
[1:13:03] and LSD and seizures and all these
[1:13:07] things that caused the stuff severe
[1:13:09] depressions these things are what
[1:13:12] happens as the emotions just get too
[1:13:13] much you know and the body shuts down so
[1:13:16] it's a mechanism because there's a fear
[1:13:21] and all of these anxieties to stop
[1:13:24] people now that's an extreme form maybe
[1:13:27] none of us have an extreme form but you
[1:13:29] see it starts to come down in the
[1:13:31] subconscious and it makes its way up
[1:13:32] until you get controlled by these things
[1:13:34] and you know one thing that we must we
[1:13:38] need to be aware of in this in time is
[1:13:42] we we cannot let complexes and traumas
[1:13:47] influence our decisions on day to day
[1:13:49] stuff here until day to day life our
[1:13:53] walk just stuff everything you do during
[1:13:56] a date the decisions you make the way
[1:13:58] you react the the places you go to the
[1:14:01] things you listen to don't let those
[1:14:05] Amalekites influence your decisions even
[1:14:08] if it's hard and you don't want to do it
[1:14:11] what you need to do is you need to
[1:14:13] discern it and go you know what I'm
[1:14:15] acting out of a complex right now and
[1:14:18] I'm not gonna let that brought me in I'm
[1:14:20] going against the grain inside me I'm
[1:14:23] gonna do the right thing I'm gonna force
[1:14:25] myself to see you on dominion you don't
[1:14:27] have to listen to your spirit and
[1:14:29] literally
[1:14:30] it's broken you don't have to listen to
[1:14:33] it you don't have to listen to the devil
[1:14:36] and do the things that he tells you to
[1:14:38] do you don't have to go against the
[1:14:42] grain
[1:14:43] sometimes it's all it takes sometimes
[1:14:45] that's all it takes for you to get
[1:14:48] delivered
[1:14:48] it's the guy against the grain many
[1:14:50] times it's those things that's just
[1:14:52] breaking the habit it's just breaking
[1:14:55] along and grain habit and when the Lord
[1:14:58] has showed you and identified it then
[1:15:01] you can do the opposite and it's hard
[1:15:03] and it's not easy but there is grace
[1:15:06] there is a provision and if you feed on
[1:15:09] the provision if you drink more than you
[1:15:11] need you'll push out another brunch
