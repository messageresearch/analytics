Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Bless you saints. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Let's just stand this evening as we open in a word of prayer. Let's bow our heads.

Life and death is in the power of the tongue. God wants to use your tongue. Amen. You say not today, Satan. get back in the name of Jesus Christ. I remember that, you know, that brother had that vision or dream. I don't know what what it was, but the devil kept getting bigger and bigger and he kept backing up. Eventually, he realized he had to fight. So, he picked up the Bible. He said, "Boo." The devil got smaller and got smaller and got smaller until he evaporated into nothing. So, you got to keep hitting your enemy until he disappears. Amen. Don't just put up with him. Don't just say, "Oh, you're here and I'm here." No. Get rid of him. Amen. We don't have to live with condemnation or guilt or shame or that's basically my sermon and I'm done tonight. But you know, you don't we don't need to live with any of those things. Amen. Our God is taking care of it all. So we can walk in confidence and victory tonight because our God is on our side. Amen. He is our helper, our defense, and our strength. Amen. He's on your side. He's in your corner. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Josh. Amen. Thank you, musicians. Amen. The Lord's in our corner tonight. Amen. Amen. As we boldly, as you know, as Paul would say, to boldly come before the throne of grace. Amen. And we have full right, amen, to do so tonight by the blood of Jesus Christ. It's nothing we have done. It's nothing we have merited. It's all what he has done. Amen. And I believe if there's ever a people that can walk in no condemnation, it is us tonight because of what he has revealed through the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's let's go on the scripture. Um, tonight I don't have a PowerPoint, so we'll do this old school, but I want to um I want to go into Romans chapter 3. Actually, let's just read one verse and you can have your seats. We're going to go to John chapter 15 and we're going to read uh verse 16 and then we can just rejoice for the rest of our lives. I think &gt;&gt; that's a great scripture. You think about you because think about who's saying this what we're about to read. Okay? Who's saying this to you? Not don't put it well I trust he's a personal God to you tonight. So when you read these things you're not you don't have in your mind Jesus talking to the disciples though he was but he's talking to his disciples in 2025 and he says this ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you. God makes the right choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain uh whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you these things I command you that you love one another amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer tonight amen who wants to say Lord touch my life Lord I want to be changed I want to be higher I want to be closer I want problems to be gone to be under my feet Lord I just want to be more like you I just want to express in liberty how I feel about you, Lord. Gracious father, you see all the hands that are raised across the building. We are asking, dear God, that you would come and touch our lives. Lord, I don't believe we need to invite you here. I believe you're already among us tonight. We're so thankful, dear God, if we could have, Lord, all we can give you is a hallelujah and a praise, your great name, Lord Jesus. There's no suit we could put on or clothes to impress you or even the greatest red carpet in the world would never do you justice, Lord God. But Lord, you're not looking for those things. You're looking for surrendered, open hearts. And Lord, we open our hearts, we surrender our lives into your hands, dear God, because we, Lord, greatly desire that when we pray as a people tonight, it would not us be humanly praying, but you would take over our vocal cords, take over our mouths and our tongues, oh Lord Jesus, and may you pray through us, Lord. May the Holy Spirit give us utterance this night for your glory. And dear God, as we've read your great eternal word, Lord, we're asking may you anoint it, Lord, multiply it, Lord, anchor it in our souls. And father, we especially want to remember those who are away, who are sick, who couldn't come tonight. Lord, I pray that sickness would cease now in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, may it not spread to any other family member. May the symptoms vanish, dear God, and may you touch them, raise them up for your glory. We love you, Lord. We thank you for the season we're living in, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats tonight. So, if I could take a, you know, was it Gabriela asked me, "What's your title?" I'm like, well, I really don't know what a I don't know if I if I have a title tonight, but I want to talk about where there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ. That's really where I want to go. We're going to go to Romans chapter 8. But isn't it like you you think about, you know, Jesus speaking here in in in in John chapter 15, just those words. You got to think about who's speaking here. This is this is the Lord God Almighty more than a prophet, more than a rabbi, more than a religious leader, more than just a intellectual man or something. This was the God prophet. This is God made flesh telling his disciples, "You have not chosen me." Now, when he's speaking these words, Judas is already gone. Okay? He's already gone to do what he's doing. He's now, you know, when Judas leaves, he he he begins to speak to his other disciples in ways he never did when Judas was there. Judas is gone. He's um shot his last w. He's gone off to do what he's going to do. But then here here is Jesus saying, "You have not chosen me, but I've chosen you." And I'm sure we've all kind of had that moment in our walk where we think, "I chose the Lord. I made a decision." And and sure, you do need to make a decision. If you haven't made a decision, make a clear-cut, sold out decision. I'm serving you, Lord. But the one who put that on your heart to make that decision is Jesus Christ himself. And he put that on your heart. Amen. That's why it's so important when we gather maybe as a family or gather as a church, you know, we come and we have church or you have family altar that we should really pray God, God, come down to remove every hindering spirit and obstacle to stop you having free course. Because even brother Bram says the preaching of the word actually casts the devils off people for them to actually receive what they have need of from God. That's what the preaching of the word does. It pushes the enemy back. It creates an atmosphere, amen, that we can receive what we have need of. Amen. That when when we leave this atmosphere, the devil can't come back. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're washed by the water of the word. Amen. So, we should really have in our hearts, Lord, as we gather, when I pray, Lord, may your presence come down in such a way that the yoke of the enemy is destroyed, that the devil's pushed back. You may say, "Well, I don't have any problems, but we're all going through something." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you're having a jubilee, just have a jubilee. Amen. And let it may it spread. Amen. and I pray to everyone else. But you see, here's the Lord saying, you know, I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain. This is not temporary fruit. This is eternal fruit. This is the character of Christ revelation putting on flesh. Amen. And you think about now if God has chosen us and ordained us to do so, he's going to give us the ability to do so. I mean that's why it's so amazing when you think about the very God in heaven has made you a Christian. I mean the very God of heaven has called you has actually put it in your heart to respond to him to even hunger after him. You know that's a supernatural thing. Jesus would say in the biatitudes blessed is he that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled. So if you're hungering and thirsting you're blessed. I mean you're a blessed person. You say I'm just I'm just grinding it out and I feel Lord you got to do something in my life and I have such a desperate need of you. If you're a blessed person to be in that kind of position, you say, "I just feel like I'm being torn in two." You're blessed cuz you're hungering and thirsting and calling out. There's something in you yearning for more of God because God wants to pour more of himself into you. Amen. So, you're a very blessed person. So, as you know, as as the prophet would say when Jesus hung on Calvary, it says that God hung him between heavens and earth and wrote a a covenant with the families of the earth that day. That day on Calvary. So, was God making a covenant with you? Many times we say, "Lord, I'm going to make you a promise and Lord, I promise I'm going to be faithful and Lord, I'm going to be true and Lord, I'm going to do my best." And you know, we make all these sincere promises and we should because it's our human will to say, "Lord, I want to serve you." Right? But you got to think about who's on the other side of the covenant. Amen. Because I'm sure we've come to a point in our walks where we realize it wasn't me holding on to God. He was holding on to me the entire time. I mean, it wasn't me that was, you know, with my humanity and my determination saying, "Lord, I'm going to keep walking with you when I don't understand what's going on. I can't see the way out. Lord, I don't understand." And I, you know, it's not us that holds on to him. It's him holding on to us. You know, Brother Ram would say is, you know, when his great trial came into his life where, you know, um, you know, he um he was he was influenced by his parents-in-law or his Hope's parents, you know, not to not to uh respond to the call and go preach to the Pentecostal people. And we know the great tragedy that befell his life when you know Hope died and um you know Sharon Rose died and all those things. And people would people would ask him, "Billy, did you hold on to your religion?" And he said, "No, no, no, no. My religion held on to me." &gt;&gt; And he would when when brother Brown would would describe the effects of the quickening power of the Holy Ghost. He would go to that time when he was in the hospital and and and his wife had already been dead and then you know you know he was told you know his you know his little baby shower and Rose was dying with the same disease and you know he would go there and he and he you know snuck past the doctors and nurses he got to where she was and she was just a little bitty baby and you know she was in so much pain her eyes were crossing and you know he'd be calling out to God don't take her don't take her life and he said he just saw like this black curtain come across him and God just refusing his prayer and it was in that moment, his lowest moment of his life is when the devil snuck up to him and and you know the devil was too smart to say God's not real cuz brother Brad knew he is real. But he'd say and you stood there night after night. You stand on street corners and witness to people saying God is a good God and God heals and God saves and God's there for you. And what has he done? Your wife's dead. Your baby's dying and you call him a good God. And brother Ram says, "And I was about to agree with him." But then he felt that quickening power raise up. And he said, "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away." Amen. When he described the quickening power, he went to that experience to say, "This is when it's at your darkest moments is when the quickening power really manifests itself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We You want to see a miracle? You want to see a miracle? You see a Christian that's been the devil's just been pouring everything they can upon that person and yet they still love the Lord. It's that quickening power holding. Amen. It's when they've been praying and they feel God's answer and everything's going sideways and yet they trust God. Amen. Brother Bram would tell the story of uh Julius Statcliffe um and his wife. They they were in the military in the US military. They were in Germany and they had a child and the baby passed away. And they believers in the well you could say the message back then in the 50s and 60s as it was in that form. And then what happened is they they they did not um allow the baby to be buried, but they somehow convinced the US Air Force of Military to to organize a a plane to fly Brother from America to Germany to pray for the baby that the baby would come back to life. Cuz they were convinced if if we just got the prophet here, he's going to come back to life, the baby. But then brother Brand went and um um prayed about it and the Lord said, "Don't go. This is my hand. I've allowed this." And then I don't know what the space of time was between that moment and then when they physically saw each other. And then so Mrs. Statscliffe asked brother did I not have enough faith? What was wrong? And and brother said no no you had tremendous faith because even when the Lord took your baby you loved you still loved him anyhow. See faith is proven when things go backwards not when things are answered. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because but because it's when things go backwards is when God proves that his faith he's put in you. And he proves you have not chosen me but I've chosen you. Amen. Cuz he when he chooses a people this is not a blanket call. This is a one-on-one come follow me. Like Peter, James, and John there in the, you know, fishing and things. Jesus comes their way, calls them by name. Come and follow me. And this message has done the same thing for you and I. You know, I'm sure you you remember that time where where where the Bible became alive, the scripture became alive, Jesus stepped out of history, realized he's more than a story. He's more than a testimony. He's a living God today. And God opened his word and caused you to see yourself in Bible characters. Amen. Whether it was David killing Goliath or even David on the run from Saul crying out to God, you somehow you read that and something in you identified that's you in this present moment. &gt;&gt; Who's had those kind of experiences? &gt;&gt; Amen. God is cho showing you you're part of his scripture. You're part of his word. Amen. You are the you are the living epistle of this day. And he's showing you I have called you to bring forth much fruit. And that fruit is the character of Christ in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. More than miracles. You want to see a miracle? You see a Christian that loves the Lord with all of their heart. That's a miracle. Amen. Because you think about it. Adam and Eve fell in perfection. They couldn't stand. But then so God actually now shows the power of his choosing because with his choosing is a sacrifice to make sure they can you know he can gather them because remember there's a big gulf between us and God. He had to bridge the chasm. No one else could do it. No you it didn't matter. Brother Abraham couldn't do it. Moses couldn't do it. Elijah couldn't do it. Enoch couldn't do it. Adam couldn't do it. None of the heroes of faith could do it. So God himself had to come wrap himself in a you know as a as a man come down into time redeem us back to God. Hallelujah. Amen. And then what did he do that for? So because that was part of his choosing because he had to give a sacrifice that it just wouldn't be God above us or God with us but God Christ in you the hope of glory. God in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then so now he calls us to bring forth much fruit. And so what he does is he allows us to live in this time. This is a crazy time. This is a madness time. &gt;&gt; You take the arguments of today and you go back a 100 years ago. They would they would lock us all up in the asylum thinking, "What are these people arguing about? &gt;&gt; This is madness. Bathrooms and gender and they them and all this kind of stuff that people are fussing about these days. They you guys are crazy &gt;&gt; cuz this world has gone insane. And brother Ram says, "I'm going to tell you it's it's real close to it so you know before it happens." Right? God puts us in this time cuz he wants you to know that there is so much power. There's way more power in the blood &gt;&gt; than what the devil has. I mean, the devil's got nothing. There's more. I don't I think it was, you know, you know, there's a song that says there's more in the hem of his garment than the camp of the enemy. Amen. There's more in this. There's more in the tassels hanging off his robe than all of hell. That's how much power he has. Amen. And God wants to prove his power. And that's why he's allowed the world to go insane that he would place the people here, place his elect ones, and he can't lose one of them and place them in a crazy age to show that the blood still works. Amen. That his calling power works. Amen. His keeping power works. Amen. And what and not only does he do that, but he wants you to actively know there's nothing held against you. It's all been struck off. And I've been thinking this week a bit about, you know, the woman caught in adultery brought there before the son of man. And what does she, you know, you know, they start accusing and all these things and what does he do? He stoops down, begins to write in the sand. And I believe he was writing the book of life of all the Pharisees, of all the accusers, writing all their sins out. That's why from the eldest to the youngest their conscience gripped them cuz they could see they begin to write I know Levi Bar Ruben the eldest one starts right this is just me now this is what I think he did he's writing their names and their details and they're probably thinking how on earth does he know this and then and then they think I better get out of here otherwise he's going to write some real incriminating things you know brother Bram would have a there's a discernment line and he goes down a pew one to another And he says, "The next one's got this, and the one next to you's got this, the next." And he's saying, "Just to prove that Jesus Christ is here." And apparently in that sermon, people were getting out and running away because they knew it was going to come and hit them. &gt;&gt; Same thing. &gt;&gt; Same thing was happening. &gt;&gt; And so what was happening now is is their book of life was being written, but she was uh going to experience a a rewriting of her book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because all the accusers left and then she's just there and he's there and she just asks him sorry he asked her a simple question woman where are your accusers and she says there's none here Lord that Lord means supreme one more than rabbi more than you know more than prophet supreme one lord he says neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more amen so she left that moment guiltless sinless No condemnation. Amen. And imagine now, imagine she's told that you're not condemned. The men around her didn't receive those same words. So imagine now you're her and you walk through the marketplace and you see them and your eyes lock and your mind would go back to that moment cuz now they're living with their guilt. She's not living with anything like that. &gt;&gt; And you know what I love about that scene? It shows what the devil what's going to happen to the devil &gt;&gt; when everything's exposed &gt;&gt; on the great day of judgment. And there's going to be a question, how did this happen? And it's going to be like the like you know when when when God came down into Eden and he asked the serpent and you know he spoke to Adam and then Eve then the serpent who did this who told you this? What caused this? And then the serpent, you know, cuz it would have been Adam, Eve, and the serpent maybe. And the serpent looks to his left and says there's no one there to pass the buck to. And you know, it's all going to be laid upon him. And then and then the devil's going to come to the same way. Amen. Because the condemnation you should have received and the judgment you should have received. Jesus Christ took it that day on Calvary. Anything that can be held against you, he carried far away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Guilt gone, &gt;&gt; shame gone, &gt;&gt; sin gone, regret gone, &gt;&gt; Amen. All those kind of feelings and condemnation, all those things, he carried them far away. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he said, I have, you have not chosen me, but I've chosen you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to choose you to bring you to my side that when you stand by my side, there's nothing that can be held against you by the accuser. Hallelujah. You know, brother Bram says that when you confess your sins into the blood of Jesus Christ, it's actually transferred &gt;&gt; from you. It's got to go on someone cuz someone's got to answer for it. And where's it go? It goes on the head of the enemy and he's going to carry it to the day of judgment and he's going to answer for those things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We should not feel any condemnation. You say, "Well, my heart condemned me." God's greater than that. He knows your heart. You've got to come to a peace and I pray you have. God's taken care of it all. Amen. The Lord Jesus took care of all of that woman's accusers in John 8. They were all taken care of. They all had to leave. Our accuser, he's been taken care of. Amen. You say, "He's still running around. I still hear thoughts and memories come up and all these things." Don't let him put you on a hamster wheel of your past. update him to what happened. Oh, what happened after that devil? Oh, no. I don't want to talk about that. You know, it's like someone, this is totally a tangent, but we're going this way. It's like people who believe in evolution. They love to talk about cells multiplying and all these things, but you say, well, well, hold on. Rewind the story a bit further back. How did it come to cells? Oh, we can't talk about that. Yes, we can. We can talk about that. I've talked about it a lot. I did chemistry. I know what I'm talking about. I say it's against the laws of chemistry. But you just got to keep the take the story back far enough and then their lies exposed. And you do the opposite with with the devil. Take the story further enough to the point where God called you and found you and transformed you. And then you'll begin to realize everything before that in your mind is a lie because God took care of it that day on Calvary and he called you to show you that he took care of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can walk in liberty. That's why, you know, the devil tries to put things on our lives to try and keep us away from God. It's all a lie. The blood is more than enough, is it not? &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can now come boldly before the throne of grace with full assurance. Lord, you hear my prayer. You understand my need. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm not here just talking to the ceiling or talking to the floor. Lord, your blood has put me on speaking terms with you &gt;&gt; and so we can come boldly before the throne of grace. &gt;&gt; Whenever you're in a I'm just going to close with this thought, okay? Whenever you're going through a hard time, think about who called you. &gt;&gt; Was it a minister who called you? Was it a religion who called you? Some man-made idea called you? More than that, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; it was God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. through his word &gt;&gt; called you and he's on the other side of the covenant and you know brother Bram would say in the Middle East there you know used to be in the ancient times when two men would make a covenant they would take a they'd write the covenant out they'd rip it in half and then what they'd do is when they did that and each one would have a half of it they would slay an animal between them and say if if either of us do not hold our side of the bargain let us be like this dead animal you know the Lord Jesus knew you could not live up to his word. He knew you could not live up to your half of the bargain. That's why he became the slain beast. Amen. That his life would come into you. That the covenant would come together. Amen. And it would be manifested in your life. &gt;&gt; That your fruit should remain. That eternal things would be done. We're not just wandering through life. God's doing things. He's doing it through you and he hasn't finished. Okay? He called you. You say, "Well, my family, my upbringing." Now, it comes to a point where God actually says, "No, no, no. Even if you were an atheist somewhere in the back of somewhere and you know Christianity whatsoever, I still would have found you there." &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are his child. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to realize who has made because as I said a while ago, we make promises to God. But what promises has God made to us? You got to focus on those things because he has the power to live out manifest those promises. Amen. Let's um let's have the musicians. I'm just going to abruptly just pull over and stop. Okay. But really, when things get hard, think about who's this one who called me? God did. And he didn't call me to lose me. You'll have your ups and downs. You'll have your hard times. But who's holding on to you? Amen. The Lord himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let Wait, let's just read one scripture, shall we? Can we just do that? I just want to read this and then we'll sing I want to sing that song. Um well, then we'll take prayer requests and then we'll sing He's a miracle working God. Okay, how about that? Let's go to Colossians chapter 2. This is one of my favorite favorite scriptures. [Music] Colossians 2 and then we're going to go to let's just go from from verse verse 9. Okay, we're going to go down to we're going to uh verse verse 15 from verse 9. Colossians chapter 2, it says, "For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power, in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism, wherein ye uh wherein also ye are risen with him, through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead, And you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses. I like that word. It's three letters, but it's amazing. all, not some, not most, all trespasses. Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross, and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Amen. This what he's done. So, you're going through a hard time, read the scripture. He's done it for you and I. We can walk in liberty. We don't have to walk in condemnation. We don't have to suffer its effects because there's now no condemnation in which you're in Christ. You walk after the spirit. Amen. So, let's um let's stand. We'll sing this. Then we'll take prayer requests if that's okay. Amen. He's a miracle working God.
