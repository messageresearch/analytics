[21:54] warmed up it's nice and cool outside
[21:57] it's getting it's getting heated in here
[22:02] i think just before we go on
[22:06] i heard there's a few testimonies around
[22:08] here and i think because we had this
[22:10] beautiful
[22:11] youth service youth with with our
[22:13] borders
[22:15] there might be more so i'm going to hand
[22:17] the mic over to
[22:18] our precious brother phil i might i
[22:21] think i know
[22:22] i i can guarantee there might be more so
[22:25] you can have your seats
[22:27] and we can we can hear how
[22:31] how good the lord is
[22:36] you wish you saints
[22:40] um
[22:44] the otaki outreach just a quick report
[22:47] on that
[22:48] this is the second saturday that we've
[22:50] had it the first saturday
[22:53] i'd just like to thank brother and paul
[22:56] brother ben that's young ben
[23:00] and marion and brother john
[23:04] for attending because at that time we
[23:06] had a gentleman by the name of
[23:09] tainui and tainu is named after one of
[23:11] the walkers that come to new zealand
[23:14] and he's a local and he
[23:18] carries around a big kunchow
[23:21] which sounds like the shofar so here we
[23:24] are talking about the chauffeur and the
[23:26] trumpets playing
[23:27] and this gentleman has left his family
[23:31] here in otakis born otaki but he likes
[23:34] to walk down the street and blow the
[23:36] chauffeur
[23:37] and if anyone's got any problems which
[23:39] they ask him he goes around and prays
[23:41] for them
[23:42] and then he'll blow the chauffeur and
[23:45] that's like blowing the devil out of
[23:46] their
[23:48] problem areas so i was really blessed he
[23:51] was really blessed having the young
[23:52] brothers there
[23:54] for them for young brother
[23:58] and you know it's always good to have
[24:02] prayer warriors there
[24:05] and he actually sat beside brother impal
[24:08] so when we prayed mate he got
[24:11] earful
[24:14] and he was blessed with that air force
[24:17] amen and he was blessed with the young
[24:19] brothers because
[24:20] the other the young brothers could
[24:21] actually follow the word
[24:23] and pray as well and so he got really
[24:26] blessed with that
[24:28] so that was the first saturday the
[24:31] second saturday
[24:32] brother anias brother cuban
[24:36] brother cuban's mother-in-law sister
[24:38] vanessa's mum
[24:39] myself and belinda were there and the
[24:42] next gentleman came in was a
[24:44] another maori guy and
[24:48] this guy was the neck level up
[24:53] and he was out of the president of the
[24:56] mongol mob
[24:57] from gisborne and
[25:01] in his past he was like a real mongol
[25:05] and now the lord touched him 18 years
[25:07] ago
[25:08] and brought him to otaki and
[25:11] he did some silly things and bad things
[25:14] in otaki
[25:15] but then the lord touched him when he
[25:17] was in the shower
[25:19] and i want to emphasize this because
[25:20] this is how he come to preaching the
[25:22] word
[25:23] and how the lord touches heart he
[25:25] actually had his wife
[25:27] was sick and he asked she asked for a
[25:29] pastor
[25:30] to come and pray for her so he rang this
[25:32] pastor up
[25:33] and the past said yes i'll be there and
[25:35] the pastor forgot
[25:38] so on the sunday he went there early to
[25:40] the pastor's place
[25:42] to the church and he asked he dressed in
[25:44] his number ones he's like number ones
[25:46] out of his gang
[25:47] suits and he asked the gentleman they're
[25:49] playing in the band where's the past and
[25:51] they sit in the office
[25:54] so he went into the office and said are
[25:55] you the pastor and he said yes
[25:59] so he grabbed the passport the scruff of
[26:01] the neck
[26:02] smashed him in the face dragged him out
[26:05] put him down on the pulpit and smashed
[26:08] him and says where's your jesus
[26:10] now
[26:13] in a church then he went home
[26:18] and he was in the shower and jesus hit
[26:21] him
[26:22] and he was laid out for nine hours
[26:26] on the ground a sobering mess
[26:29] because the lord was dealing with him
[26:32] the next day he got up and he went back
[26:36] to the church and you sat there and you
[26:38] went up to
[26:40] shake the hands of the pastor you saw
[26:41] him coming of course
[26:43] and as he shook the pastor's hand the
[26:45] lord hit him again and he fell down on
[26:47] his knees
[26:48] so that reminds of the gentleman that
[26:50] came with their bully attitude
[26:52] to brother branham and fell at his knees
[26:55] that gentleman his name's kingi
[26:59] and he followed that pastor for the next
[27:01] nine years
[27:03] gave his heart put everything away he
[27:06] couldn't read couldn't write
[27:07] and so he knows now how to read and
[27:09] write but
[27:11] under a denominational spirit
[27:14] right so these are the battlefields that
[27:15] we have faced when we're going out to
[27:17] outreaches as brother and paul known
[27:19] brother
[27:20] and you would know so when you're going
[27:22] out you got to make sure that you know
[27:24] who your god is
[27:26] absolutely you got to have the absolute
[27:31] so when we when he came to the meeting
[27:34] he started testing me and testing me and
[27:37] trying to find out who i was and all
[27:38] this
[27:39] and i told him my testimony and he
[27:42] looked at brother anyas
[27:44] playing the guitar with brother cuban
[27:45] singing songs
[27:47] and he said that man is a preacher
[27:50] you you call me a puppy that's good
[27:54] he said you're just a youth preacher
[27:58] so he says and we don't need you here in
[28:01] otaki to tell us older men than you
[28:06] what to do because we are here
[28:09] and i believe he's older than you i'm a
[28:12] little bit younger than him
[28:13] and so you're just a puppy he says oh
[28:16] okay that's nice
[28:17] i can wake my tail
[28:21] afterwards we sat down and then the
[28:25] kaupapa we have there is that
[28:27] i'll open up with a prayer then we'll
[28:30] ask for a prayer request
[28:31] of whoever's there and then we'll hit
[28:34] those prayers
[28:36] you know if you're ibm missiles you hit
[28:38] those prayers together so if it was
[28:40] a prayer from brother
[28:44] brother um marion will find out his
[28:46] prayers
[28:47] a prayer from brother andy a prayer from
[28:49] brother
[28:50] as we pray for these things together so
[28:52] we're hitting those prayers
[28:54] so if you've got five or six of us
[28:55] hitting those prayers at one
[28:57] that's quite a lot of dynamite throwing
[28:59] at satan he doesn't like it
[29:02] right and it's very effective and then
[29:05] after that we go into
[29:07] having a little bit of a sing-song as
[29:09] well
[29:11] so as we sat down but onto the table
[29:14] with anya said here but the cuban said
[29:16] here
[29:17] i said here the mother-in-law sat here
[29:20] belinda sat here
[29:21] and he sat there he was looking at me
[29:24] all the way
[29:25] because to him it was disrespectful that
[29:27] i'm i went away from him this is the
[29:29] maori culture
[29:30] traditions i should have sat beside him
[29:32] and given that sort of
[29:34] acoloid of mana but i didn't come over
[29:37] here so he looked at me
[29:39] and then i opened up a prayer room from
[29:42] genesis
[29:43] to revelation 23 and we hit that book in
[29:46] the middle
[29:47] and we showed him who he was and we
[29:50] break the bread
[29:50] we break the waters we restored the
[29:52] buildings of the walls in troubles times
[29:56] then he caught it while i was praying
[29:59] all i could hear was
[30:02] and i knew that he was looking you could
[30:04] feel those eyes
[30:06] and then when everyone else started
[30:08] praying
[30:10] he got the shock of his life because he
[30:13] was sitting now
[30:14] beside brother cuban brother cuban is
[30:17] not quite
[30:18] okay when he prays
[30:21] brother anya said to get up and walk
[30:22] away because he couldn't hear himself
[30:25] praying
[30:26] i was over here i knew where i knew the
[30:28] power was coming from
[30:30] this gentleman here just you could hear
[30:32] him as the prayers are going on
[30:34] half an hour and now you could hear him
[30:36] going sweeter and sweeter
[30:39] from um to amen to
[30:43] praise the lord and his voice started
[30:45] getting higher and then you started
[30:46] entering into the prayers
[30:48] and you could feel that he was checking
[30:50] everybody out
[30:52] and here's my wife hands up giving the
[30:55] blast of a trumpet
[30:56] and same to the other sister and
[30:58] afterwards
[31:00] he grabbed the guitar and he sang a
[31:02] wayata a song
[31:04] and it was a really nice mellow song
[31:07] if you didn't know this gentleman you'll
[31:08] think that it was probably a
[31:10] 20 year old singing the song yeah and he
[31:13] was just praising jesus
[31:15] and then he gave his testimony all the
[31:17] scars in his life and all that
[31:20] and when we first met him we go to shake
[31:22] hands it was a
[31:23] it was a mongol mob shake hand right he
[31:26] fisted first
[31:28] when we left he got up shook cuban's
[31:31] hand
[31:33] put his hand like that a typical cuban
[31:37] gave him a crush by the time he went
[31:39] through bolognas and myself
[31:41] you're shaking our hands and he was
[31:43] calling his brother
[31:45] the move of the holy spirit moved then
[31:47] he invited us
[31:48] men onions to come next week to five
[31:52] gentlemen that he knows that they want
[31:54] to start a prayer group up
[31:56] it's too late we got him first
[32:00] but he wants us to come to show them how
[32:02] to pray
[32:06] the last testimony here today
[32:09] i've been going to physio in the vin and
[32:12] i have a taxi driver that acc has
[32:14] supplied
[32:16] he didn't say much in the beginning but
[32:17] today he started telling me about his
[32:19] testimony
[32:20] about how he met the lord because i was
[32:22] talking about the supper room
[32:24] i was talking about the barbecue that
[32:26] we're going to have out there to
[32:28] intercede and to connect with everybody
[32:30] that's walking the streets
[32:33] and then he told me his testimony
[32:36] how he met the lord this guy's a pretty
[32:39] big
[32:40] kiwi guy from gisborne and
[32:44] he's a diver so that's how he got
[32:45] talking
[32:47] and then he was telling me that that's
[32:50] how he met the lord
[32:51] he was out diving one day off the coast
[32:54] of takaha the east coast
[32:56] and he got pulled out on the drift about
[32:57] 13 kilometers the hills got less and
[32:59] less and less and less
[33:01] he knew he was in trouble he had his
[33:04] bottles on dropped his wipe out but he
[33:07] couldn't kick all the time
[33:09] then he saw something moving and i was
[33:11] like
[33:15] it was a shark this side it was a white
[33:18] pointer he knew what it was
[33:20] it circled back around like this and
[33:22] then it
[33:23] came at him and all of a sudden it just
[33:25] flipped over and dived in the water so
[33:27] he saw the body
[33:29] and when a shark goes underwater the
[33:30] next thing you see is going to come up
[33:32] from the bottom
[33:34] to grab you and take you out so here's
[33:36] waiting for that so he started praying
[33:39] and he says maybe the ocean got a bit
[33:41] more water in that day
[33:43] he started praying next to me he felt
[33:45] this bump
[33:46] bump bump bump and what it was
[33:50] was a pod of dolphins
[33:54] and they picked them up and bumped them
[33:55] all the way 13 kilometers back to land
[34:00] that man had an experience of god
[34:03] so today i was able to tell him the
[34:05] experiences that we have had over these
[34:07] last two sundays
[34:09] amen so if you want to come on on

[35:14] need to do it's it is
[35:16] so the last one's coming we didn't come

[35:22] we have a work to do and
[35:23] and the harvest is plenty and the
[35:25] laborers are few
[35:26] god still sends out his laborers to go
[35:28] find them so

[35:51] that's all right so the sunday um after
[35:54] church we had the youth service on the
[35:56] sunday night six o'clock but in the
[35:57] morning early
[35:59] i started getting a migraine but a
[36:01] terrible headache just didn't
[36:03] leave me so then we had the the two
[36:05] o'clock session with the youth
[36:07] and they're singing their song and those
[36:08] things and i and i left because i just
[36:11] yeah and i had such a headache
[36:12] but you push on because you think oh

[36:15] it's going to break you know in jesus
[36:16] name i claim my healing or we just walk
[36:18] but it's just balding and balding and
[36:20] building and building and and it's
[36:22] man it's just not nice so i went home
[36:24] early i said to brother ben and brother
[36:26] matt and our brother ed and met i said
[36:28] can you take the service i'm just going
[36:30] to go home i'm just going to go crash
[36:32] and the next day we were going to go
[36:33] hunting so i thought hey if i get a
[36:35] couple of
[36:35] a bit of sleeping then at least we can
[36:37] go the next day because you still want
[36:39] to you know i don't want to disappoint
[36:41] reuben and i wanted to go and hunt with
[36:42] him
[36:43] so next morning i wake up to go to to
[36:45] bed about
[36:46] 10 10 o'clock 11 o'clock because we just
[36:49] had to get so many things
[36:51] done for the hunt and woke up the next
[36:54] morning three o'clock we're on the road
[36:55] we're going hunting
[36:56] but the headache's still there not as
[36:58] much but it's
[37:00] you know you know that feeling it's just
[37:02] saying hello i'm here
[37:03] so i just say no i don't claim it i just
[37:05] keep going
[37:06] so we start hunting and we walk in this
[37:09] in this beautiful
[37:10] place that goddess has provided us out
[37:13] in nature the best place it is there is
[37:15] no demons out there they can
[37:17] they can interfere that god the spirits
[37:19] can't work through anything there it is
[37:20] absolutely
[37:22] wonderful to be out there and i enjoyed
[37:24] the experience and had a wonderful time
[37:25] with the boys and with brother ed and
[37:27] them
[37:28] but the headaches started coming back
[37:30] they started coming back stronger and
[37:31] stronger
[37:32] so evening we were up on a ledge and we
[37:36] we basically was on a clearing looking
[37:38] out towards some other clearings looking
[37:40] for deer
[37:41] and they just kept going and growing and
[37:43] growing and
[37:44] and i just got quiet and if i get quiet
[37:46] you know there's something wrong
[37:48] and i was starting and i was really
[37:50] brave because i said okay i'll climb
[37:51] behind the steering wheel i'll drive
[37:52] home you know i'm fine you know i'll
[37:54] just drive home because you kind of push
[37:55] everything just aside you will just get
[37:56] home
[37:57] but as we left brother ed he suggested
[38:01] that he would drive home and he had to
[38:02] sleep the afternoon you know so i said
[38:04] you know what you drive home
[38:06] i'll just i'll take a shotgun and i'll
[38:08] just lie here
[38:09] couldn't sleep here they grew hit it
[38:11] grew windy road it just grew it just
[38:14] grew it just grew and
[38:15] i got real sick i was not feeling really
[38:18] good
[38:19] and we got to the akita ketarawas and we
[38:22] dropped
[38:22] brother mary on all for this house and
[38:24] we continued on and about
[38:26] five turns later i said to it just stop
[38:29] and i
[38:29] and i threw up and the heat was because
[38:31] now it's so so much that your body just
[38:33] reacts and i and i threw up
[38:35] two three turns later threw up again but
[38:38] man shaking
[38:38] really not feeling good and i was
[38:41] standing there almost
[38:42] starting to feel sorry for myself and uh
[38:45] now you're talking with the lord because
[38:47] remember he puts these things on you
[38:49] because he wants you to know that he's
[38:51] your healer
[38:52] he doesn't put a headache on you to to
[38:54] make you suffer
[38:55] he puts a headache on you because he
[38:57] wants to show you and he doesn't do it
[38:59] we do it because we don't have a
[39:00] discipline
[39:01] we don't take care of our bodies and
[39:02] these things happen but when you pray
[39:04] this power and prayer so i went back
[39:06] into the car and i went and sat down
[39:08] and and and i was just you know very
[39:11] tired and
[39:12] just not feeling too well and i said to
[39:13] brother edward said
[39:15] brother can you guys just lay hands on
[39:17] me and pray for me because i'm feeling
[39:19] really bad
[39:20] and he said let's do it. and and him and
[39:22] the boys and they hear they're all
[39:23] witnesses
[39:24] they laid hands upon me they prayed for
[39:26] me
[39:28] it wasn't supernatural they didn't win
[39:29] wow everything went away all of a sudden
[39:32] but i could the pressure was gone but
[39:34] still had the headache but that that
[39:35] intense pressure went and just left it
[39:37] was a migraine
[39:38] got home and told my wife as always any
[39:40] good husband throw all the bags down and
[39:42] just
[39:42] hit for the show and hit for the bed and
[39:44] i slept so the next morning brother ed
[39:46] said okay well tomorrow i'm going to
[39:48] work from home
[39:49] and i said well i think i'm going to
[39:50] call in sick because if i feel anything
[39:52] like this i'm just not going to go to
[39:53] work at all
[39:55] and i went to sleep and me and my wife
[39:57] we prayed together and i slept and i
[39:58] fell asleep
[39:59] with this headache and i woke up the
[40:02] next morning
[40:03] perfectly fine like sober before my
[40:06] alarm
[40:06] perfectly fine and we went to bed what
[40:09] time brother
[40:10] that was about it all 10 11 o'clock
[40:12] again again late
[40:14] and the next morning i went to work and
[40:16] brother ed stayed at home
[40:18] but the lord gave me my healing and i
[40:20] could go to work
[40:21] and when i was at work i could actually
[40:23] testify of what just happened
[40:26] because we had a guy that was at work
[40:28] and he said
[40:29] and it's a long story but i won't go
[40:30] into it but he said about and this is
[40:32] the battles we face he said about
[40:33] most war starts either religion money
[40:36] greed
[40:38] and i said to him my bible never tells
[40:40] me to fight a war except
[40:42] it's against satan so if you can show me
[40:44] a scripture where it says i can go and
[40:46] kill on those things
[40:47] i think you must read the bible because
[40:49] the bible is there to lead
[40:50] to learn to love your neighbor as you
[40:52] love yourself and to love god
[40:55] so then that opened it up and then i
[40:56] gave him a bit of the testimony how god
[40:58] healed me
[40:59] and all those things had to happen so
[41:01] that i could have a five minute to a ten
[41:03] minute talk with this guy
[41:05] and show him the grace of god so
[41:07] sometimes we go through that
[41:08] so the next day you prepared for what
[41:10] he's going to send you
[41:12] so i just want to say thank you for the
[41:14] lord for healing me
[41:15] and it might not be instant but he is a
[41:18] healer
[41:19] amen
[41:26] [Applause]
[41:29] thank you brother armand
[41:32] anyone else youth without borders
[41:37] friday night saturday sunday
[41:42] do you have one
[41:45] okay let's stand and worship then shall
[41:48] we
[41:51] um the lord's real
[41:55] and he deals for with anyone he wishes
[42:00] he is sovereign he's got everything in
[42:02] control
[42:04] i sought the truth and
[42:08] men gave their answer
[42:12] but something just
[42:15] wasn't right
[42:20] i couldn't explain them
[42:24] they sounded like strangers
[42:28] it just didn't meet my thirst inside
[42:34] then i'd heard indeed go cry
[42:39] heard a voice speak to my heart

[53:33] in jesus christ's name amen
[53:36] amen god bless you friends you may have
[53:38] your seats tonight so
[53:40] i want to speak about faith in action
[53:42] and i was thinking about this last week
[53:44] and
[53:44] i trust everyone tuned into the youth
[53:46] without borders and they were very
[53:47] blessed and
[53:48] you know brother brahm says i just want
[53:50] to lay some uh
[53:51] comments out but you know he says he
[53:54] says the only
[53:55] the only thing to bring that right
[53:56] atmosphere he's speaking about
[53:58] dancing and music and so on then for the
[54:00] dancers to put on your old music that
[54:02] makes dances and everybody gets thinking
[54:05] what a good time they're going to have
[54:06] dancing and so forth and they'll
[54:08] end up having a big whooping time put
[54:11] the right kind of music on the piano the
[54:13] organ and everybody
[54:14] in the atmosphere that jesus christ is
[54:16] there and going to meet
[54:18] everything that they have need of
[54:21] something is going to take place so it
[54:22] goes from people getting the atmosphere
[54:24] of a party or a music or a concert he
[54:26] brings it right into the churches and if
[54:28] you get into the right atmosphere you'll
[54:29] get the right kind of a
[54:31] right kind of results he says atmosphere
[54:33] he says but that's the hardest thing
[54:35] there is to do
[54:36] and that is to get the people in that
[54:38] atmosphere the atmosphere of worship
[54:40] the atmosphere of believing so who wants
[54:43] to be in the atmosphere of believing
[54:44] tonight
[54:45] you know we're not here just you know i
[54:47] was thinking that you know
[54:48] church is not a passive thing you know
[54:51] it's not like you
[54:52] you know it's just you pause the
[54:54] preacher walk and get a snack come back
[54:55] and you know
[54:56] you know just watch and just kind of you
[54:58] know it's it's not a passive thing but
[54:59] it's actually
[55:00] the faith of the people pulls certain
[55:02] things you know you see in the life of
[55:04] jesus where where
[55:06] he'd be walking by and you know one for
[55:08] example is a seraphinician woman and
[55:10] you know she had a daughter that was vex
[55:12] grievously vexed with the devil
[55:13] but but she managed to her her faith
[55:16] went into action
[55:18] and it went beyond discouragement it's
[55:20] amazing how much jesus tried to push her
[55:22] off the promise
[55:24] but he already knew what was in her but
[55:25] you see if you have real faith if it's
[55:27] been revealed to you
[55:29] you'll go past all discouragement
[55:32] past you i can't think of a better word
[55:34] or a better phrase but it's like jesus
[55:35] just tried to better
[55:36] you know i'm not even sent to you he
[55:38] says
[55:39] you know it's not even me to to to to
[55:42] feed the dogs the crumbs and you know he
[55:43] tried to basically just you know call
[55:45] her a dog and
[55:46] different things but her faith went
[55:47] beyond that
[55:49] and and and she worshipped him and and
[55:52] he said basically grace your faith
[55:54] you'll find who healed them well so it
[55:56] wasn't just a passive thing but it was
[55:58] actually a reaching out of faith
[56:00] amen brought the promise into her family
[56:02] it's the same thing with you and i you
[56:04] know
[56:04] we're all on the same team hey we're all
[56:08] on the same team
[56:09] right we're not we're not this you know
[56:10] it's not red against blue or whatever
[56:12] color whatever color
[56:14] you know this is not a parliament you
[56:16] know there's a government and there's
[56:17] the opposition then there's the
[56:18] whoever's and the
[56:19] you know the bank bet you know back
[56:20] benches no no we're all on the same team
[56:23] we don't have our own agenda we've got
[56:25] god's agenda
[56:26] the agenda of his word that's the thing
[56:28] we're interested in you know we're not
[56:29] interested in what what we can
[56:31] necessarily push our thing it's not
[56:33] about us pushing our own borough
[56:34] but we want god's kingdom to be
[56:36] established in the hearts and lives of
[56:37] people
[56:38] i mean so you know we're all in this
[56:40] together so
[56:41] you know i was really blessed by the
[56:43] services of brother john
[56:45] you know he would he would mention the
[56:46] um scripture quite a lot about jesus
[56:49] after the resurrection
[56:50] he'd speak to peter and you know he
[56:52] asked the question peter do you love me
[56:54] and then you know you know the fur he
[56:56] says yes i love you he says feed my
[56:57] lambs
[56:58] they asked them again do you love me
[57:00] feed my sheep so so
[57:02] the effect basically jesus is telling
[57:04] peter if you really love me you're going
[57:05] to feed some people
[57:07] you're going to nurture people you're
[57:08] going to feed them food that they can
[57:10] grow on
[57:11] that and and that's the proof that you
[57:12] love me it's not that you just stand
[57:15] there and say oh jesus you're so
[57:16] wonderful and look up in the sky and
[57:18] try and have a religious kind of moment
[57:20] no no yeah there should be a giving
[57:22] there'd be a life there's a faith goes
[57:24] into action and it actually
[57:26] supports one another hallelujah so
[57:30] that's the that's the kind of faith i'm
[57:33] kind of talking about i probably may i
[57:34] feel like i scramble it's like scrambled
[57:36] eggs but
[57:37] you know i'm sure the omelet will get
[57:38] made and it'll make sense but
[57:40] you know we're all on the same team and
[57:42] he asked the question do you love me
[57:43] says feed my sheep and feed my lambs now
[57:45] you may say well i'm not a minister i
[57:47] don't preach but
[57:48] that's not necessarily the food we
[57:50] always give we know sheep
[57:52] live on cheap food and brother baby says
[57:54] that's the word of god it's not creed
[57:55] it's not dogmas it's not opinions
[57:57] it's the word of god that's what sheep
[57:59] live on but
[58:00] you know the bible tells us in ephesians
[58:02] that every
[58:04] if we can go to ephesians chapter four
[58:07] i'm let's just read a bit of this
[58:08] because you know i just think we can
[58:11] i believe by the help of the lord we can
[58:14] just go a step higher tonight
[58:16] you know we can go beyond just having
[58:18] church and i don't believe we just have
[58:20] church we have church you know i believe
[58:22] we really have church you know god
[58:23] really
[58:24] opens his word and he anoints it with
[58:26] spirit and
[58:27] you know you know his holy ghost is not
[58:28] just intellectual trying to grasp
[58:30] something but god really does something
[58:31] in this place
[58:32] but i believe we can go further than
[58:34] what we have
[58:37] you know it's amazing the effort it's
[58:40] amazing that the effort people put in
[58:42] to go watch a big sporting event or a
[58:44] great big concert it's amazing the
[58:46] effort
[58:46] i'm not even talking about the athletes
[58:48] or the musicians or i'm talking about
[58:50] the people just go and watch
[58:52] they put a lot of effort in they're up
[58:54] at all kind of crazy hours
[58:56] you know if you know if the rugby's on
[58:58] at 2am they're up at 2am and they're
[59:00] and they'll leave it at 2am they're up
[59:01] at 1 30 to get all the pre-match and get
[59:03] all excited
[59:04] and you know buy spend way too much on a
[59:06] jersey that's you know defunct after the
[59:08] tournament and
[59:09] you know but but they put a lot of
[59:10] effort in because they're under
[59:12] expectation
[59:13] and they want everyone to know whose
[59:15] team they're on you know i heard a
[59:17] joke or not really a joke but there was
[59:19] a i don't know how he communicated but
[59:21] there was a blind
[59:22] uh blind deaf man and he went to church
[59:25] every sunday
[59:26] so he couldn't see anything couldn't
[59:27] hear anything and but but but he went to
[59:30] church every sunday
[59:32] and and someone asked him i don't know
[59:33] how they did it but they did
[59:35] why do you go to church you can't see
[59:37] anything you can't hear anything and
[59:38] however he responded i don't know but he
[59:40] said i want to tell the world whose side
[59:42] i'm
[59:42] on hallelujah it should be the same
[59:46] thing with this message we want to know
[59:48] we want to tell the devil
[59:49] not just god we're on your side we'll
[59:51] tell satan we're not on your side
[59:52] but we're on your side lord jesus amen
[59:56] so
[59:56] it's here in ephesians 4 and 16.
[1:00:00] or verse 15 but speaking the truth and
[1:00:03] love
[1:00:04] may grow up into him and all things
[1:00:06] which is the head even christ
[1:00:08] from whom the whole body jointly fit
[1:00:11] together and compacted
[1:00:13] by that which every joint supplier
[1:00:16] according to the effectual working
[1:00:19] in the measure of every part make it
[1:00:21] increase of the body
[1:00:23] unto the edifying of itself in love so
[1:00:25] that tells me that every part of the
[1:00:27] body
[1:00:28] has a function and it's a it's a
[1:00:30] necessity it's it's necessary
[1:00:32] it's not optional bits that you just
[1:00:34] tack on but every bit's important
[1:00:36] so it's not just the ministry that's
[1:00:38] important it's the helps it's important
[1:00:39] it's the
[1:00:40] it's every part of the body you know
[1:00:42] there were there were elders in the days
[1:00:44] of joshua that outlived joshua
[1:00:46] and just their very presence you read
[1:00:48] about the book of judges just their very
[1:00:50] presence kept israel on the straight and
[1:00:51] narrow
[1:00:52] it says after they died then israel went
[1:00:54] after the um
[1:00:56] gods around them so just their presence
[1:00:59] his brother so and so and he knew joshua
[1:01:01] and he was there when you know they
[1:01:03] took the land he was that generation
[1:01:04] just his presence
[1:01:06] and and that sister's presence kept the
[1:01:08] church on the straight and narrow of the
[1:01:10] word
[1:01:11] hallelujah so you say i have no function
[1:01:14] we all got to function
[1:01:16] we all have an important part to play
[1:01:18] amen see
[1:01:19] so as i say it's not like well you know
[1:01:21] you may feed
[1:01:22] one another by preaching to one another
[1:01:24] like you say oh that was peter's job to
[1:01:26] feed the sheep and feed the lambs but
[1:01:28] we all have a role to play to nurture
[1:01:30] the body we all have a very
[1:01:32] from the youngest to the oldest we all
[1:01:34] have a very important part so
[1:01:37] it's very vital that our faith goes into
[1:01:39] action
[1:01:41] now brother braham says here if i can
[1:01:43] find it i think maybe i should just
[1:01:45] print notes because it's easy to turn
[1:01:46] pages but
[1:01:47] you know he says he says in the message
[1:01:50] faith in action he says god's word is a
[1:01:53] solid rock
[1:01:54] of any faith that anybody wants to have
[1:01:57] in the supernatural it must be placed
[1:01:59] first in the word of the living god
[1:02:01] that's been through the ages how that
[1:02:04] when men of old in
[1:02:05] all ages when they would rarely find the
[1:02:08] word of god and could grasp it
[1:02:10] faith went into action right away so
[1:02:13] actually just
[1:02:14] subconsciously australia went into
[1:02:16] action when the people really
[1:02:18] grasped found the word of god and
[1:02:19] grasped it they didn't grasp a creed or
[1:02:22] a church or some movement but it was
[1:02:23] actually the word of god they grasped
[1:02:25] then faith went into action now we know
[1:02:27] that the scripture tells us that faith
[1:02:29] without works is dead
[1:02:31] now those kind of works is not not just
[1:02:33] feeding the hungry and clothing those
[1:02:35] are needy and doing good works that
[1:02:36] people say
[1:02:37] but faith is works expressed so the life
[1:02:39] that we live the things we say the
[1:02:41] things we do
[1:02:42] amen is an expression of our faith how
[1:02:44] we treat one another should be an
[1:02:46] expression of our faith right how we
[1:02:48] treat the lost and dying on the street
[1:02:50] should be an expression of our faith you
[1:02:53] know so
[1:02:54] i i ask the question the beginning we're
[1:02:56] all on the same side
[1:02:58] because what can happen is unbelief is
[1:03:00] also
[1:03:01] has a work right it's a divider it's a
[1:03:05] killer it's a terror down
[1:03:08] but i don't i'm persuaded we're not
[1:03:10] anointed with that kind of spirit
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:13] we have a faith amen
[1:03:16] to to minister to one another
[1:03:20] and also to reach the lost this may be
[1:03:22] very elementary but i don't know this is
[1:03:24] just
[1:03:25] i'm maybe i'm just a bit silly sometimes
[1:03:28] i just a thought comes and i just look
[1:03:29] into it and i get happy and here i am
[1:03:32] you know but you think about the faith
[1:03:34] we have
[1:03:35] faith is a revelation it's not something
[1:03:38] we try and work up it's something that
[1:03:39] god just deposits
[1:03:41] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:03:43] word of god if you want faith hear the
[1:03:45] word of god
[1:03:46] that's why it's so important to get into
[1:03:47] this message and just absorb
[1:03:50] let god just pray lord the same
[1:03:52] inspiration that the prophet preached
[1:03:54] with and opened the whole book
[1:03:56] that revealed christ in his word may
[1:03:58] that same inspiration fall on me as i
[1:04:00] hear
[1:04:01] hallelujah so it's not just something
[1:04:02] you hear but something that manifests in
[1:04:04] your life
[1:04:05] you know brother braham says that the
[1:04:06] holy ghost feeds on the word
[1:04:09] that's what it feeds on so if you've
[1:04:10] received the holy ghost there's
[1:04:12] something in you
[1:04:12] that feeds on the word of god hallelujah
[1:04:16] so if we want to get big and strong with
[1:04:18] faith muscles it's good to feed
[1:04:21] amen this is a lie full of distractions
[1:04:24] but it's good to feed on the word
[1:04:26] of god hallelujah amen
[1:04:31] now on the day of pentecost that one
[1:04:34] heart one mind one accord
[1:04:37] hallelujah we can have that kind of
[1:04:40] atmosphere
[1:04:41] here every wednesday every prayer
[1:04:45] meeting
[1:04:46] you can have around your dining table
[1:04:47] wherever you have your family altar
[1:04:49] be one heart one mind one accord lord i
[1:04:52] want to see you live
[1:04:53] lord i'm hungry to see you manifest your
[1:04:55] glory lord i want to see it go from ink
[1:04:57] on paper to be a living reality
[1:05:00] hallelujah hallelujah you know that's
[1:05:04] that's that's how we should be
[1:05:08] says now a person who comes into now we
[1:05:11] are called all different kinds of things
[1:05:13] a crazy
[1:05:14] fanatica whatever you know to the
[1:05:16] general public we're considered that way
[1:05:18] or an insane person it's because we've
[1:05:21] changed dwelling place we live in a
[1:05:23] different atmosphere than the world
[1:05:26] and our one motive brother braham says
[1:05:28] and your one motive your one thought is
[1:05:29] to stay in that atmosphere
[1:05:31] any person that's ever come into that
[1:05:33] atmosphere one time is never satisfied
[1:05:35] nowhere else
[1:05:36] so when you really step into the prince
[1:05:38] of god hallelujah
[1:05:40] you want to stay there that's why we
[1:05:42] never want to leave camp
[1:05:44] hallelujah that's why there's just
[1:05:46] services that people just don't go home
[1:05:49] seems to me why because you want to stay
[1:05:50] in that atmosphere
[1:05:52] but that atmosphere can come with us
[1:05:53] wherever we go
[1:05:56] hallelujah now there's something very
[1:05:59] powerful
[1:06:00] and a group coming into one heart one my
[1:06:02] one accord
[1:06:04] you know we're facing the greatest thing
[1:06:06] to ever strike the earth
[1:06:08] which is the secret leaving of the bride
[1:06:11] remember the rapture the coming of the
[1:06:12] lord is not necessarily you know it says
[1:06:14] in revelations one every i'll see him
[1:06:16] but that's when he comes
[1:06:17] in revelations 19. right but when the
[1:06:20] bride leaves it's a secret going
[1:06:23] in a moment of twinkling right it comes
[1:06:25] like a thief in the night so there's two
[1:06:26] different kind of comings right
[1:06:28] so the one we're facing is actually a
[1:06:30] secret leaving
[1:06:33] hallelujah so now here we are in this
[1:06:35] moment of time
[1:06:36] and this little even brother ram says
[1:06:38] that that that time on
[1:06:40] on the whole ring of eternity is like a
[1:06:41] hickey you know
[1:06:43] and we'd have to get a big fat
[1:06:44] magnifying glass to go right at the end
[1:06:46] where the hickey comes back to eternity
[1:06:48] again
[1:06:49] and we're living right there that means
[1:06:51] we're living right at the end of the end
[1:06:53] of the end
[1:06:54] yes i'm glad hey if we're living in the
[1:06:56] middle we'll still push on like it's
[1:06:57] going to be tomorrow that's how we
[1:06:58] should be hallelujah but you know
[1:07:01] there's there's such a powerful thing
[1:07:04] that we possess
[1:07:06] and that is actually life in these
[1:07:07] bodies to see god live
[1:07:10] and a hunger to see him live amen
[1:07:13] atmosphere is everything atmosphere is
[1:07:16] everything
[1:07:17] i'm not saying we don't have a good
[1:07:18] atmosphere i'm just saying we can have
[1:07:20] more
[1:07:21] right so i'm not no don't ever take this
[1:07:23] as you
[1:07:24] thinking that i'm thinking that this
[1:07:26] place is dead and there's nothing here
[1:07:27] and you you
[1:07:28] no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying
[1:07:30] there's more to have
[1:07:32] we can have more we can have a greater
[1:07:34] atmosphere our brother ram says it goes
[1:07:36] all
[1:07:36] just like a faith bank rests upon the
[1:07:39] people
[1:07:40] we're all the demon spirits are cast out
[1:07:42] you know you know brother abraham says
[1:07:44] about how in the millennium the devil
[1:07:45] will be bound by a chain
[1:07:47] yeah you know the scripture says that
[1:07:49] and and he says that chain is a chain of
[1:07:51] circumstances there's no one for the
[1:07:53] devil to work through
[1:07:55] during the millennium you know we can
[1:07:57] have i but this is just me and my little
[1:07:59] silly self but you know
[1:08:00] we can have that kind of thing in our
[1:08:02] lives the devil can't use my tongue
[1:08:06] there's a chain of circumstance he can't
[1:08:08] use my mind
[1:08:10] he can't use my spirit he can't use my
[1:08:12] body
[1:08:13] he can't use my imagination my
[1:08:15] conscience my reasoning my affection he
[1:08:17] can't use any part of me
[1:08:18] because there's a chain of the holy
[1:08:20] ghost that keeps him bound that he can't
[1:08:23] he he can't work hallelujah
[1:08:26] we can have that kind of life i believe
[1:08:29] by the power of the blood you say that's
[1:08:31] unobtainable no with god all things are
[1:08:33] possible
[1:08:34] where we stay you know you know last
[1:08:37] time i was well the only time
[1:08:38] uh no the first time i was in venue you
[1:08:40] know i was in vanuatu
[1:08:42] you're flying to port villa and you go
[1:08:44] we went past the cemetery and brother
[1:08:45] adrian says you know
[1:08:47] perfect harmony in that place everyone's
[1:08:49] dead
[1:08:51] there's no fusses there's no fighting
[1:08:53] there's no trouble there's perfect
[1:08:54] harmony
[1:08:56] you know but if we reckon ourselves dead
[1:08:59] yeah
[1:09:00] i'm not i'm not living the devil shows
[1:09:03] up tries to cause some trouble
[1:09:04] i know he's dead i can't work through
[1:09:07] this guy
[1:09:08] hallelujah oh she's dead i can't work
[1:09:11] here well there's no point
[1:09:12] you know there's no point you know
[1:09:15] that's the kind of chain of circumstance
[1:09:17] no i'm not trying to be silly you know
[1:09:19] but i'm serious
[1:09:20] you know but imagine and and it's not
[1:09:22] saying we can just imagine but
[1:09:24] i believe it's a reality where where
[1:09:27] brother graham says that a man or a
[1:09:29] woman can be so surrendered to god that
[1:09:31] the devil don't know what to do with him
[1:09:33] so the devil can plague them with
[1:09:34] sickness financial trouble strife in the
[1:09:37] family strife and church strife in their
[1:09:39] personal life
[1:09:40] strive for however may be and and and
[1:09:42] somehow that person just walks right
[1:09:44] through it
[1:09:45] goes through deep valleys high mountains
[1:09:47] fire bright patches
[1:09:48] trouble you know but somehow they just
[1:09:51] get through
[1:09:52] and the devil says well that doesn't
[1:09:54] work i'll try this
[1:09:55] and then it ends up with the same result
[1:09:57] and the same trouble come you know
[1:09:58] different trouble but same result
[1:10:00] and the devil just says i just don't
[1:10:02] know what to do with this person
[1:10:04] why because they're so surrendered to
[1:10:06] god that the devil don't know what to do
[1:10:07] with them
[1:10:08] you know we know that we are not exempt
[1:10:10] from trouble
[1:10:11] but we have the answer to get us out of
[1:10:13] trouble because he is the way of escape
[1:10:16] but that but the but the source of our
[1:10:19] uh deliverance comes from an opening of
[1:10:21] the scripture
[1:10:23] to you and i because when you see
[1:10:26] yourself in the word
[1:10:27] that gives us stability in time of
[1:10:29] trouble
[1:10:31] david saw that he was king of israel he
[1:10:33] was anointed by a vindicated prophet
[1:10:35] that gave him stability it says in the
[1:10:38] scripture that you know even when saul
[1:10:39] was trying all of his antics
[1:10:41] you know that david behaved himself
[1:10:43] wisely and saw feared him all the more
[1:10:46] because he was a man that could wasn't
[1:10:48] reacting according to how
[1:10:50] saul was expecting him to react he was
[1:10:51] reacting in a different way
[1:10:54] and then saul was all more afraid this
[1:10:55] guy is different
[1:10:57] trust when the devil comes against you
[1:10:59] he'll say these people are different
[1:11:01] why didn't they fall in that trap you
[1:11:03] know it's so obvious thousands have
[1:11:04] fallen and why didn't this one fall in
[1:11:06] there's something different on the
[1:11:07] inside of the inside
[1:11:10] hallelujah but it's a but it's a source
[1:11:12] of our strength is when the scripture
[1:11:13] comes open
[1:11:15] and christ steps out of history you know
[1:11:16] he goes by
[1:11:18] i love the story of the woman at the
[1:11:19] well he goes there and they begin to
[1:11:22] have a conversation he sends off his
[1:11:24] disciples he
[1:11:25] he's already told them i need to go by
[1:11:26] the way of samaria he sits at the well
[1:11:29] because he's waiting for a vision to be
[1:11:30] fulfilled
[1:11:31] and he sees a woman walking he's seen it
[1:11:33] by vision because he says i can do
[1:11:35] nothing till the father shows me
[1:11:36] and that the father shows me i do
[1:11:38] likewise so his whole life was led by
[1:11:40] vision
[1:11:41] and so he sat there then he sees a woman
[1:11:43] walking what he saw in vision is now
[1:11:44] coming reality upon the earth
[1:11:46] now she has no idea of her place in the
[1:11:50] scripture she has no idea that she's one
[1:11:52] of them that she's an attribute of god
[1:11:53] from the foundation of the world that's
[1:11:55] expressed in flesh she has no idea
[1:11:57] but she's walking into a vision just
[1:11:59] like you and i
[1:12:01] hallelujah you know the apostle paul
[1:12:04] says the works are finished before the
[1:12:05] foundation of the world
[1:12:07] hallelujah so our overcoming the devil
[1:12:10] was already done
[1:12:11] we're just living out the vision and
[1:12:13] then so here he is sitting here
[1:12:15] she comes along she's part of the vision
[1:12:17] he just says woman bring me a drink
[1:12:19] he looks at her thinking but you're a
[1:12:21] jew i'm a samaritan we have no dealings
[1:12:23] one with another is racial segregation
[1:12:25] and trouble and all these things and
[1:12:27] you know but then he says if you really
[1:12:28] knew who i was you'd ask me for a drink
[1:12:30] and
[1:12:31] they begin to talk but then now the
[1:12:32] discussion gets religious
[1:12:34] and then she begins to say well our
[1:12:36] fathers worship yo here and you say
[1:12:38] you say you should worship in jerusalem
[1:12:40] and it's all about
[1:12:42] they were they were all living off or
[1:12:44] she was discussing
[1:12:47] what was not what is
[1:12:50] it's it's the what is that matters
[1:12:53] because it's very easy to
[1:12:54] by tradition and history to say jesus
[1:12:56] died and rose again
[1:12:59] the christian world all believes it but
[1:13:01] it's when that one steps out of history
[1:13:04] and this becomes living it becomes a
[1:13:07] love letter not a not a history in a
[1:13:09] theory you know but it becomes a living
[1:13:11] word
[1:13:12] to you and i that's a very different
[1:13:14] thing so here she was
[1:13:16] talking about things of history and you
[1:13:19] know and you know she'd say well jacob
[1:13:20] dug this well and you know
[1:13:22] she was she was discussing
[1:13:25] about what was and i'm just trying to
[1:13:30] find where i am
[1:13:34] but she was talking she had an
[1:13:37] intellectual faith
[1:13:39] of what god did in the past now the
[1:13:42] scripture tells us in james 2
[1:13:45] that the devils believe and tremble they
[1:13:47] have a faith
[1:13:49] even so even the devils belief
[1:13:52] and quite frankly everyone who goes from
[1:13:55] this world into the next they become a
[1:13:56] believer
[1:13:58] but it's better to become a believer now
[1:13:59] because it's too late then but you know
[1:14:01] but even the devils believe in tremble
[1:14:04] but they don't have the same faith as
[1:14:05] you and i because real faith is a
[1:14:07] revelation
[1:14:09] the devils have an intellectual faith
[1:14:11] because if the devil really if the
[1:14:13] scripture was really revealed to him
[1:14:15] and he knew he was going to lose he
[1:14:18] thinks he's going to win
[1:14:19] because intellectual you know it's like
[1:14:21] christie and i play scrabble
[1:14:23] now you know she sometimes
[1:14:26] i think i'm going to win i ain't won
[1:14:28] once i don't think
[1:14:29] but she even sometimes lets me nearly
[1:14:32] win like halfway through the game i
[1:14:34] thought i've got the sewn up
[1:14:36] and then comes the end of the game i'm
[1:14:38] like 50 60 points behind
[1:14:40] you know she puts like one letter down
[1:14:42] it's like 60 points how does that work
[1:14:43] you know
[1:14:44] but it's like the devil yo god knows
[1:14:46] he's not going to win but the devil
[1:14:47] thinks i'm going to win this
[1:14:48] but if it's revealed see you know
[1:14:51] hallelujah
[1:14:52] it's got to be revealed faith must be a
[1:14:53] revelation
[1:14:55] amen if because if it's a revelation
[1:14:57] nothing can shake you from it
[1:15:00] but the devil will try and shake you
[1:15:01] from it so so she had an
[1:15:03] intellectual understanding passed down
[1:15:06] by her forebears about what god did in
[1:15:08] the past
[1:15:09] but she only was living by knowing of
[1:15:12] past revivals
[1:15:13] but she was in the process of becoming
[1:15:16] part of the revival for her day
[1:15:19] hallelujah i mean so at that point she
[1:15:22] was going to get natural water that a
[1:15:24] man dug
[1:15:25] and a lot of people live if you if you
[1:15:27] read in jeremiah we don't have the time
[1:15:29] i think it's chapter 2
[1:15:31] where where where jeremiah says the
[1:15:33] people have done a great thing
[1:15:34] they've forsaken the fountains of living
[1:15:36] water and hewn themselves out systems
[1:15:39] broken systems
[1:15:40] and so this well basically was like a
[1:15:42] sister it's a four yes a man-made thing
[1:15:44] that's dug
[1:15:45] it's a man-made tank that collects man
[1:15:48] collected water and people drink from
[1:15:49] that instead of drinking
[1:15:51] pure artesian water and so here she was
[1:15:54] drinking from a man-made well talking
[1:15:57] about a god of history
[1:15:59] but she was talking to the god of the
[1:16:00] present right and he was the
[1:16:03] fountain of living waters and so what he
[1:16:05] wanted to do was open her eyes of
[1:16:07] understanding
[1:16:08] that she would understand that she
[1:16:10] shouldn't drink a mat
[1:16:11] water from a man-made tank or a man-made
[1:16:14] religion a man-made creed
[1:16:16] but come to the living word himself and
[1:16:18] drink the livers
[1:16:19] rivers of living water amen hallelujah
[1:16:21] because out of because jesus said the
[1:16:23] last day of the feast now we've had a
[1:16:25] feast of seven church ages was the last
[1:16:27] day of the feast
[1:16:28] jesus himself stood up and said anyone
[1:16:30] who thirsts come to me
[1:16:32] and out of them will come rivers of
[1:16:34] living water
[1:16:36] hallelujah and that's the hour we're
[1:16:38] living in
[1:16:39] so she had to she was living by
[1:16:42] something that somebody dug
[1:16:44] but now she has come to a time we should
[1:16:46] actually drink
[1:16:47] the rivers of living water that were not
[1:16:50] out of human systems but from god
[1:16:54] himself
[1:16:55] now when when she when the word began to
[1:17:00] discern her life
[1:17:02] and and and he would say go get your
[1:17:03] husband no we all know these things very
[1:17:05] well but i just wanna
[1:17:06] here we are again you know he said go
[1:17:09] get your husband
[1:17:10] and she says i don't have one and he
[1:17:11] says that's right you've had six i mean
[1:17:13] five of the one you're with is not yours
[1:17:15] you know she dropped her water pot
[1:17:18] because she said now we know where
[1:17:19] messiah cometh he'll do these things
[1:17:22] and and he just said he that speaks you
[1:17:24] he
[1:17:25] it wasn't a big seven seven hour series
[1:17:28] it wasn't a big thing sit there it was
[1:17:30] just a it's just a conversation
[1:17:32] a man and a woman talking but but the
[1:17:34] word brother says the light struck the
[1:17:36] seed and the woman and she came to life
[1:17:38] so it went from a dormant faith to a
[1:17:40] living face
[1:17:42] and she dropped her water pot her old
[1:17:43] life and she ran into the city what
[1:17:45] happened
[1:17:46] automatically faith went into action and
[1:17:49] that faith was now i've got to tell
[1:17:50] somebody that this is
[1:17:52] life that the messiah is on the earth
[1:17:55] right now
[1:17:56] he's not in the past he's not in the
[1:17:58] future
[1:17:59] he's right here and we know that the
[1:18:01] revealed word of god is messiah
[1:18:04] every generation when the word comes
[1:18:06] open that is christ of that age
[1:18:07] hallelujah
[1:18:08] amen so when the word came up and she
[1:18:10] realized this was messiah talking
[1:18:12] you know it's amazing many people heard
[1:18:14] words come out of his lips
[1:18:16] but she was the only one that said i
[1:18:18] think you're messiah
[1:18:21] hallelujah and so her faith went into
[1:18:25] action
[1:18:26] and she ran into the city said come see
[1:18:28] a man that told me all i've ever done
[1:18:30] is this not the christ this is not the
[1:18:32] messiah
[1:18:33] and then the people ran out and they and
[1:18:36] they said to him now
[1:18:38] we believe you not because of what her
[1:18:39] testimony about by the words you have
[1:18:41] said
[1:18:43] hallelujah aren't you glad we have
[1:18:45] someone to point people to
[1:18:48] i didn't say something i don't say a
[1:18:49] building where we have someone
[1:18:51] amen we have someone the ever-present
[1:18:54] water from the rock the lord jesus
[1:18:56] christ the living waters amen
[1:18:58] he's not a creed he's not a dogma he's
[1:19:00] more than a doctrine he's a living
[1:19:01] person
[1:19:02] a living being hallelujah
[1:19:06] amen brother brown would say in broken
[1:19:08] systems he said that's the way it is
[1:19:09] when you live by that fountain of living
[1:19:11] waters
[1:19:12] it's living all the time bubbling over
[1:19:14] and over and over and over
[1:19:15] there's no end to it not not go see if
[1:19:18] some water if they had rain here not
[1:19:20] long ago it's not it
[1:19:21] it's that fountain of living water as i
[1:19:23] say it gives its water free
[1:19:26] you don't have to put rags on it that's
[1:19:28] to keep all the wiggle tails out some
[1:19:30] educational rags
[1:19:31] before you send them out to preach and
[1:19:32] see if he spells his words right and
[1:19:34] speaks him right
[1:19:35] he uses it sees if he uses his nouns and
[1:19:37] his pronouns and so forth and adjectives
[1:19:40] many of them don't even know what they
[1:19:41] are but he's living at the fountain just
[1:19:43] the same just the same
[1:19:45] you don't have to depend on local reigns
[1:19:47] to fill it up or local revivals for
[1:19:50] it it don't have to that for it's a
[1:19:52] power it's a purity within itself
[1:19:54] that's where the word is its own power
[1:19:57] when a man can receive it in his heart
[1:19:59] it's got purity
[1:20:00] it's got its power it's right in the
[1:20:02] word itself it springs forth
[1:20:04] the life hallelujah
[1:20:08] amen i'm not saying youth without
[1:20:10] borders was a local revival don't get me
[1:20:11] wrong that's a worldwide revival
[1:20:13] that's the fountain coming open
[1:20:15] hallelujah
[1:20:16] but it's not just a local thing that
[1:20:18] keeps it pumped up there's something
[1:20:19] there's a force within the believer
[1:20:21] that this life comes forth hallelujah
[1:20:27] amen he said you know it's amazing when
[1:20:30] faith goes into action now faith is a
[1:20:32] very common thing
[1:20:34] we try and think it's some fandangled
[1:20:36] fancy thing
[1:20:37] but it's a very common thing when when
[1:20:40] the blood was applied in egypt on the
[1:20:42] night of passover
[1:20:43] they applied it with hyssop hyssop is
[1:20:45] just a common weed
[1:20:47] it wasn't some little flower that grew
[1:20:48] up in some mountains some faraway
[1:20:50] continent it was a weed
[1:20:52] that grew everywhere around them and if
[1:20:55] you look at weeds i don't have a photo
[1:20:56] of it but maybe i'll
[1:20:58] show it on sunday if i remember but
[1:21:00] around the back of my house i swept a
[1:21:02] pile of leaves
[1:21:04] and it's been sitting there a while and
[1:21:07] um
[1:21:07] anyway there were seeds in that pile of
[1:21:10] weeds
[1:21:10] they're all growing it'll grow wherever
[1:21:14] it can find a place to grow
[1:21:16] faith will grow how it just needs a
[1:21:19] little bit of soil
[1:21:21] and it'll grow so to apply the blood
[1:21:24] because i had to apply the blood with
[1:21:26] this hyssop it was just common
[1:21:28] faith it wasn't a big fandangle thing
[1:21:32] just a common faith
[1:21:35] so the faith that goes into action it's
[1:21:38] a
[1:21:38] common faith hallelujah
[1:21:44] amen now
[1:21:49] he's a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:21:53] seek him
[1:21:54] it says in hebrews 11 6 but without
[1:21:56] faith it's impossible to please him
[1:21:58] for he that cometh to god must believe
[1:22:00] that he is and he is a rewarder of them
[1:22:02] that diligently seek him
[1:22:03] who believes that tonight he's actually
[1:22:06] a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:22:08] him
[1:22:09] so that's what i say from the beginning
[1:22:10] it's not some passive thing turn it on
[1:22:12] turn it off pause it
[1:22:13] just watch it be brainy and what no it's
[1:22:15] actually it's actually a relationship
[1:22:18] but so if he is a rewarder of them that
[1:22:20] diligently seek him
[1:22:21] i mean then i trust that re that's a
[1:22:24] revelation that's actually sunk into
[1:22:25] your heart

[1:23:29] and they talk about their problem
[1:23:32] and they try and support each other from
[1:23:34] keeping away from things
[1:23:36] and it was actually built on christian
[1:23:38] principles once upon a time
[1:23:40] now this is not an alcoholics anonymous
[1:23:44] where or or a jesus anonymous where
[1:23:46] we're trying to support each other
[1:23:48] to keep away from the spirit of god in
[1:23:51] the word of god
[1:23:52] it's actually the opposite this is an
[1:23:55] this is an addiction center
[1:23:58] where addicts come hallelujah
[1:24:01] no i'm not i trust you're not offended
[1:24:03] if i call you an addict

[1:24:12] to my eyeballs in the world
[1:24:13] i was addicted to stuff of the world i
[1:24:15] was addicted to spirits in the world
[1:24:17] i remember then one day jesus came my
[1:24:19] way through the word
[1:24:20] i was listening to this message i
[1:24:22] realized i needed the holy ghost
[1:24:23] and i really needed to meet him not just
[1:24:25] some feeling or sensation but me the
[1:24:27] person of the word
[1:24:28] and she changed my life but i became an
[1:24:30] addict of something else
[1:24:32] hallelujah so where's that i'm an addict
[1:24:35] how many days have been cleaned zero
[1:24:39] hallelujah i don't want a single day
[1:24:42] well i can say he didn't live today in
[1:24:44] some form
[1:24:45] hallelujah so you know we're addicts
[1:24:47] aren't we and we should fuel each
[1:24:49] other's habit
[1:24:52] hallelujah you know in the world i was
[1:24:54] bad for my friends and they are bad for
[1:24:56] me because i was feeding each other's
[1:24:57] habit of different things
[1:24:58] but there's a different kind of
[1:24:59] addiction
[1:25:01] hallelujah man these people are dealers
[1:25:03] absolutely

[1:25:25] get each other high in the holy ghost
[1:25:28] hallelujah amen but
[1:25:31] shouldn't that be our motivation why do
[1:25:33] we come to church it's not just for
[1:25:34] ourselves we want to create an
[1:25:36] atmosphere of faith
[1:25:38] where someone else may be going through
[1:25:40] the biggest trial of their life but they
[1:25:41] walk through the doors
[1:25:43] and they feel the atmosphere of the holy
[1:25:44] ghost come down and it
[1:25:46] and their burdens and their troubles
[1:25:48] don't seem so heavy anymore
[1:25:49] because the comforter and the guide and
[1:25:51] the counselor is right here
[1:25:53] to meet their needs and they sit under
[1:25:55] the shady trees of fellowship you know
[1:25:57] how many people have you know how many
[1:25:58] times like myself you're all twisted and
[1:26:00] tied up then you go sit down with a
[1:26:02] believer
[1:26:04] what what happens you're sitting under
[1:26:05] the shady trees of fellowship
[1:26:08] hallelujah and even just subconsciously
[1:26:10] now the holy ghost begins to give you a
[1:26:12] bit of shade and a bit of rest
[1:26:14] hallelujah then you walk from under that
[1:26:15] shade tree and say i'm feeling pretty
[1:26:17] good
[1:26:19] hallelujah why because fella it's
[1:26:20] actually the holy ghost doing a work
[1:26:22] as the same thing with you and i when we
[1:26:24] come to church yeah we join our faith
[1:26:26] together
[1:26:27] lord speak to everyone here and this is
[1:26:29] not this is not pitchforking now
[1:26:31] because pitchforking is oh they better
[1:26:33] get that and i hope they got this
[1:26:35] no that's not what i'm talking about
[1:26:36] lord meet every need and divine presence
[1:26:39] touch each one of us oh god mend every
[1:26:41] heart meet every need may the past just
[1:26:44] be kicked to the side and

[1:26:47] god by virtue come forth amen
[1:26:49] before the first song is sung and the
[1:26:51] last prayer is prayed
[1:26:52] amen in between that time god come down
[1:26:54] then when we have lunch lord come and
[1:26:56] minister to one another lord
[1:26:58] come and speak supernaturally even just
[1:26:59] by actions and deeds lord minister to
[1:27:01] each heart
[1:27:02] amen that's how we should be and that's
[1:27:05] what i mean by being a dealer
[1:27:08] oh look because you want to see we want
[1:27:10] to see
[1:27:11] each of each everybody's drunk on the
[1:27:13] holy ghost
[1:27:15] hallelujah yes
[1:27:21] i've been literally drunk intoxicated by
[1:27:24] the holy ghost i realized this is how it
[1:27:26] felt like when i was drunk in the world
[1:27:27] but there's no perverseness
[1:27:28] amen there's all the all the greatness i
[1:27:31] mean all the
[1:27:32] feelings but it was just pure hallelujah
[1:27:34] staggering around
[1:27:35] hey that's what if it's in the scripture
[1:27:37] then it's for us
[1:27:39] right oh but we're we have matured no
[1:27:42] i never want to you know you see a tree
[1:27:46] who knows what photosynthesis is
[1:27:50] okay if you have no greenery
[1:27:53] you can't absorb sunlight and convert it
[1:27:55] to energy that's how
[1:27:56] greenery is green they have you know
[1:28:00] so so it absorbs sunlight draws moisture
[1:28:03] up from the atmosphere and through its
[1:28:04] roots and nutrients and it grows
[1:28:07] if you cut all the greenery off a tree
[1:28:09] it can't absorb
[1:28:10] any sunlight and actually use it as
[1:28:12] energy
[1:28:14] so i never want to get too stiff and
[1:28:16] starchy set in my ways that i'm not a
[1:28:18] green tree anymore
[1:28:20] i'm not talking about being green as an
[1:28:21] immature aren't
[1:28:23] green as inflexible hallelujah
[1:28:27] that i can still absorb the sunlight of
[1:28:29] the s-o-n that the word doesn't become
[1:28:31] common and well i've heard that i've
[1:28:33] heard that quote before i've heard that
[1:28:34] scripture before
[1:28:35] i've heard that arrangement of songs
[1:28:37] before just because we never wanted to
[1:28:38] become common
[1:28:40] i remember whatever where the atmosphere
[1:28:42] of faith being built in the church
[1:28:45] that he can do beyond what we can ask or
[1:28:47] think you know
[1:28:48] i think it's brother said it you know we
[1:28:50] should pray ask the lord to
[1:28:52] loose our tongues things that we can't
[1:28:55] even imagine want to pray lord go beyond
[1:28:56] what we imagine
[1:28:58] and just take these vocal chords and
[1:28:59] speak forth what you want spoken
[1:29:02] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i'm
[1:29:06] gonna
[1:29:06] because time is you know you know
[1:29:09] eternity's going to be cool
[1:29:12] amen you know but
[1:29:15] i just pray lord may our faith go into
[1:29:17] action
[1:29:18] everything we do we should do in faith
[1:29:21] how we raise our children it's actually
[1:29:22] in faith lord this is actually going to
[1:29:24] affect them
[1:29:25] it's going to be positive on them that
[1:29:27] your word is going to put in flesh i'm
[1:29:28] going to create an atmosphere lord i
[1:29:30] believe
[1:29:30] actually by you doing it through me that
[1:29:33] that they're going to receive the holy
[1:29:34] ghost
[1:29:36] you know it was a year ago since
[1:29:38] annelise and lilia
[1:29:39] and and malachi hey they got baptized a
[1:29:42] year ago level three lockdown you know
[1:29:44] how that came about
[1:29:47] we had a we had a zoom meeting and i and
[1:29:49] and and i remember you know preaching
[1:29:51] about the
[1:29:52] um uh you know the uh
[1:29:55] raising the flag and time of trouble and
[1:29:57] you know those things
[1:29:58] yeah you know where the americans put on
[1:30:00] erojima put their flag up on that
[1:30:02] mountain and there's still the japanese
[1:30:03] shooting and everything but they put
[1:30:04] their banner up anyway that's how we
[1:30:06] should be
[1:30:07] inspired the enemy shooting at us let's
[1:30:08] put our banner up and
[1:30:10] you know you know you know coming out of
[1:30:12] lockdown that was you know not being
[1:30:13] locked down and putting out treasures in
[1:30:15] the attic and all those things
[1:30:16] you know and then after that we prayed
[1:30:18] and there was such an atmosphere in the
[1:30:19] home
[1:30:20] that the lord came down spoke in tongues
[1:30:22] interpretation
[1:30:23] and and said my child i know what you've
[1:30:25] been thinking about on your bed i am
[1:30:27] calling you
[1:30:28] i think the lord said basically come to
[1:30:30] me and i'll fill you with the holy ghost
[1:30:32] now annelise was would would would lie
[1:30:34] in her bed now there's her testimony
[1:30:35] lilia's
[1:30:36] but analysts would lie in her bed
[1:30:38] thinking is this man calling me or god
[1:30:39] calling me
[1:30:41] and then the atmosphere was right not by
[1:30:43] anything we did humanly but just god
[1:30:44] being sovereign in his grace
[1:30:46] and the lord answered a question without
[1:30:48] even christine knowing it or i knowing
[1:30:50] it
[1:30:52] hallelujah why do those things happen it
[1:30:54] increases our faith
[1:30:56] that's why brother owen says about the
[1:30:58] discernment you know
[1:30:59] that didn't heal the people he says the
[1:31:02] lord healed you on calvary but it's to
[1:31:04] elevate your faith to receive the
[1:31:05] promise of god
[1:31:07] i mean it should be the same thing here
[1:31:09] in service
[1:31:10] that our faith should be elevated
[1:31:12] because of the atmosphere
[1:31:14] that we can actually get what we need
[1:31:17] hallelujah
[1:31:18] [Music]

[1:32:10] impossible
