[15:23] [Music]
[15:31] and the Bible says and as Moses lifted
[15:34] up the serpent in the wilderness even so
[15:36] must the son of man be lifted up that
[15:39] what whosoever believe in him shall not
[15:41] perish but have eternal life amen you
[15:44] can have your seat this
[15:50] afternoon well this is the first youth
[15:52] meeting it's a pleasure to be
[15:56] here so what I want to talk today is a
[16:00] to be aware of
[16:02] snakes I know some people here in New
[16:05] Zealand they don't know really snakes CU
[16:07] you don't have but for my friends from
[16:11] South Africa and other countries you
[16:13] know snakes right right are you scar
[16:15] snakes no
[16:19] no they're not very likable creatures
[16:21] anyways I have caught to by the head in
[16:25] South America but they don't have venom
[16:28] so they can buite you but they don't do
[16:30] anything else I grab two by the head
[16:33] so feel so
[16:37] cool
[16:39] so first of all I want to talk
[16:43] um oh this screen this one okay as a
[16:48] context because we're going to talk
[16:49] about the brass serpent so let's talk
[16:52] about the um Israel and what
[16:56] happened Genesis 15 says and he said
[16:59] unto Abraham not Abraham yet just
[17:02] Abraham no assur thee that thy SE shall
[17:05] be a stranger in a land that is not
[17:08] theirs and Shall Serve them and they
[17:10] shall afflict them for 400 years and
[17:13] also that Nation who they shall save
[17:16] will I judge and afterwards shall they
[17:19] come out with great
[17:21] substance how many
[17:23] years 400
[17:25] years here in Exodus 12 says now the
[17:29] souring of the children of Israel who
[17:31] dwelt in Egypt was 430 years and it came
[17:35] to pass at the end of the 430 years even
[17:38] the self same day it came to pass that
[17:41] all the hes of the Lord went out from
[17:43] the land of
[17:44] Egypt when I WR wrote this thing I mean
[17:47] the first time that I read it and I was
[17:49] a kid I was like oh a contradiction in
[17:52] the Bible but actually it's not a
[17:55] contradiction because they were not
[17:56] slave those 30 years
[17:59] Joseph was still alive the Bible says
[18:02] that the next Pharaoh he didn't know
[18:04] Joseph that's when they became um slaves
[18:08] so who knows what is a
[18:11] slave what's a slave where
[18:17] we that's a very actual description but
[18:21] a slave is a person who is forced to
[18:24] work for and Obey another and is
[18:27] considered to be their property so
[18:29] they're not considered as humans they're
[18:31] just like a piece of meat that has to do
[18:34] whatever they want we have a picture
[18:36] here how slave were treated we can see
[18:39] the face of that guy looking like I
[18:42] better hurry up or I'm going to be the
[18:44] next
[18:45] one to receive the whips
[18:48] and but Israel was slave they were a
[18:51] slave for 400 years that's a long time
[18:54] that's a very long time and those 400
[18:56] years there was no prophecy so
[18:59] if you take your Bible and go to the
[19:03] book um The Book of Malachi and the Book
[19:06] of Matthew there is a wide page right
[19:09] the one that said New Testament that
[19:12] page means 400 years again that nothing
[19:16] happened in those 400 years was just
[19:20] silence but the Lord didn't want Israel
[19:23] to be slaves all the time he delivered
[19:27] them with a mighty hand ni yeah very
[19:30] Mighty the Miracles and everything was
[19:33] just
[19:37] awesome but when they started to
[19:41] walk if you go to Google and if you
[19:43] search like how long take someone from
[19:46] Egypt to Israel The Mex is like three
[19:49] weeks or four weeks working only 6 hours
[19:52] per day for them took them 40
[19:56] years that's that's long so they started
[20:00] to felt like
[20:02] tired and this what they said we
[20:04] remember the fish we we did eat in Egypt
[20:07] freely the cucumbers and the melons and
[20:10] the leaks and the onions and the garlic
[20:12] but now our soul is dried away there's
[20:15] nothing at all beside this manner before
[20:18] our
[20:21] eyes there were they didn't remember the
[20:23] whips or the treat that the Egyptians
[20:26] were giving them and they the way that
[20:29] they said like we don't have anything
[20:31] just beside this Mana that comes from
[20:33] Heaven it's
[20:35] like the Lord was giving them the best
[20:37] and they were like no no we're getting
[20:40] tired of this I hope that's another way
[20:43] that you're feeling because this is for
[20:44] the young ones say you have receiving
[20:46] Mana this the the scriptures that the
[20:49] word is open for some of us we that we
[20:52] come from um
[20:56] denomination th this is a new Bible for
[20:59] me this is a new Bible but you guys are
[21:01] you grabbing this probably you can feel
[21:03] like I grab here but I pray that you
[21:08] don't feel that way
[21:10] cuz this is
[21:13] glorious
[21:15] so numbers 21 chap um verse 4 says and
[21:22] they J Jour
[21:24] it see that's that is why I need a
[21:27] microphone here okay who's going to help
[21:29] me to read Lilia God bless you is it
[21:37] on
[21:39] thank and they journeyed from the Mount
[21:42] Hall by the way of the Red Sea to come
[21:46] past the land of
[21:48] Edom and the soul of the people was much
[21:53] discouraged because of the
[21:55] way and the people spake against God and
[21:59] against Moses wherefore have you brought
[22:02] us up out of Egypt to die in the
[22:05] wilderness for there is no bread neither
[22:07] is there any water and our
[22:12] soul Lo
[22:14] this this light bread and the Lord sent
[22:18] fiery serpents among the people and they
[22:21] bit the people and much people of Israel
[22:25] died W can you give the microphone to m
[22:28] 12
[22:32] us therefore the people came to Moses
[22:34] and said we have sinned for we have
[22:37] spoken spoken against the Lord and
[22:40] against thee pray unto the Lord that he
[22:44] take away the serpents from us and Moses
[22:46] prayed for the people and the Lord said
[22:49] unto Moses may make thee a fiery
[22:54] Serpent and set it upon a pole
[22:59] and it shall come to pass that
[23:02] everyone that is bitten when he lookth
[23:05] upon the snake shall live and Moses made
[23:08] a serpent out of brass and put it upon
[23:11] the bowl and it came to pass that if a
[23:14] serpent had bitten any man when he
[23:18] beheld The Serpent of brass he
[23:21] lived
[23:22] amen so this is I remember when I was
[23:25] reading this when I was a kid I was like
[23:27] amazed like
[23:30] snake out brass but we shouldn't make
[23:34] like you know idols and stuff it was not
[23:38] an it was not an idol back then they
[23:41] just had to look at it and see the power
[23:44] of God giving them like the antidote for
[23:48] that um those
[23:50] bites amen
[23:52] so do we know what a serpent
[23:56] means serpent means
[23:58] sin
[24:00] right of course EMB brass like judgment
[24:05] is that right so that brass serpent it
[24:08] means like the sin was already like
[24:11] getting
[24:14] judged that's why they were able to
[24:16] receive the um the forgiveness and be
[24:19] healed right amen am I right brother
[24:22] you're preaching after me so you can fix
[24:24] this
[24:25] m and got a question here for you guys
[24:30] what was the name of the brass serpent
[24:34] so the option one is the Sneaky
[24:41] Snake um
[24:45] cushan and
[24:48] D we're going to know this
[24:51] soon so the brass
[24:53] serpent one was there can you I didn't
[24:56] put any picture of
[24:59] how the bite of a snake looks like for
[25:02] Priscilla's sake cuz after showing my
[25:05] fingers last time she almost pass
[25:07] out but it looks bad it start to look
[25:10] black cuz all
[25:12] the everything just start to die it's
[25:16] very dangerous getting beaten by his
[25:19] snake but they received this um cure
[25:22] from Heaven that that the lord gave them
[25:28] um Hebrews 10
[25:30] says
[25:33] um by the
[25:35] which will we are Sanctified through the
[25:37] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[25:39] once for all and every priest stand
[25:41] daily ministering and offering often
[25:44] times the same sacrifices which we can
[25:47] never take away sins but this man after
[25:51] he had offered one sacrifice for sins
[25:53] forever sat down on the right hand of
[25:56] God from hence forth expect until this
[25:59] till his enemies be made his foot
[26:02] stol
[26:04] for by one offering he had prefect
[26:08] perfected forever them that are
[26:10] Sanctified that's you and me so only one
[26:13] sacrifice yeah it may you clean the rest
[26:16] of the journey
[26:19] amen but what does Sin producing
[26:25] you this is what happened to Adam and
[26:29] Eve they didn't want to see God because
[26:32] they were ashamed so they were trying to
[26:36] hide and that's what seem producing
[26:38] people when you see you see you think
[26:41] like oh I cannot come to church I cannot
[26:43] sing a special of being bad during the
[26:46] week but you have received the Cure from
[26:49] Heaven there's no sin for you if you
[26:52] believe in Christ amen
[26:56] and oh man I I think I been here for
[26:58] like 2 minutes but I need to tell you
[27:01] like a little testimony when I was a kid
[27:03] probably when I was only like eight or
[27:05] 10 years
[27:07] old my parents give me a pxa but I
[27:10] remember I did not um deserve it un
[27:14] Justified PX so I got angry and I knew
[27:19] there was one um and for how do you say
[27:23] this word unforgivable sin like there's
[27:25] only one sin that doesn't have the
[27:28] um amen I don't know how to say the
[27:32] word but I got angry and I said it with
[27:35] my lips I said like I'm not going to
[27:38] tell you guys cuz we don't want you to
[27:39] say it but I got angry and I said the
[27:43] words like I blah blah
[27:46] blah and after that I didn't fill it
[27:49] with my heart I was just angry but from
[27:51] that moment on that was like probably 9
[27:53] or 10 the devil just start to telling me
[27:57] like
[27:58] you are done there's nothing else that
[28:01] you can do you cannot go back you're
[28:04] done so what happened to me so the way
[28:07] that I was done I just uh sinning cuz I
[28:11] I didn't have I knew that I was not
[28:14] going to get like forgiven for
[28:16] that so I started sinning and for you
[28:20] young people
[28:22] like don't don't this this is the whole
[28:25] sermon like if you have seen or if you
[28:28] you have done something don't think that
[28:30] you are cut off from
[28:32] God cuz you have the vaccine from Heaven
[28:35] that can clean you from every sin amen
[28:39] so what happened it's like when you sin
[28:42] then you think that you are Cast Away
[28:44] From God you cannot go back so you keep
[28:47] sinning and sinning and sinning and the
[28:49] thing that was only one sin it just
[28:52] become a whole life sing and it took me
[28:55] like 13 years to real lies that that was
[28:59] a lie that was the moment that I listen
[29:01] that sermon from Brother brandham it was
[29:03] like it's not just if you say it it's
[29:05] like what do you do with
[29:07] that and I received this um Revelation
[29:11] and I was like because the Lord changed
[29:14] my life and everything and I was like
[29:15] for 13 years I just lived aive and this
[29:19] is something that I don't want any
[29:21] anyone that is here to live
[29:25] like we can be forgiven for our sins but
[29:28] we have to confess them and pray and
[29:31] just move away from them you don't have
[29:33] to carry on sinning like
[29:39] yeah oh wow here we go is this
[29:44] screen we know that God he more than
[29:46] able to clean our lives
[29:51] amen it's hard for me to put a picture
[29:54] of um Jesus on the cross because I I
[29:57] grabbing a Pentecostal church and they
[29:59] are like kind of vampires they don't
[30:02] like to see crosses if they see a cross
[30:04] they like
[30:07] they in my house there was never a cross
[30:10] or anything but we know there is just
[30:11] the symbol of um for our
[30:15] beliefs
[30:17] so the name of the brass serpent was
[30:21] nean how many of you got it
[30:24] right 3 four five l
[30:29] okay that was a hard one it's just in
[30:30] the book of U Second Kings says um
[30:34] talking about ezekiah he removed the
[30:37] high places and break the image and cut
[30:39] down the grooves and break in pieces the
[30:41] brassen serpent that Moses had made for
[30:44] unto those days the children of Israel
[30:46] did burn incense to it and it called it
[30:50] nushan so they transform that symbol
[30:53] into an idol that they were not allowed
[30:56] to do but they did
[30:59] this is our Lord Jesus Christ talking
[31:02] said behold I give you unto you power to
[31:04] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[31:07] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[31:09] shall by any means hi
[31:12] you we are more than conquerors in Jesus
[31:15] Christ amen there's no sin that can just
[31:19] infect you because we have the Cure that
[31:21] the Lord gives amen and yeah this is
[31:25] just the breth that I he in my heart
[31:29] cuz when when you commit a sin or
[31:33] something you really feel like I can't
[31:36] go back you don't even want to pray when

[38:44] musicians thank you brother Mo
[38:45] appreciate uh the songs um let's just go
[38:49] to the book of First Timothy I know I've
[38:53] read it a few times but just this one
[38:56] verse here and um then we're going
[38:59] to go into being
[39:03] paralyzed snake venom
[39:06] paralyzes right there's lots of snakes
[39:09] out
[39:10] there but we've already heard there's an
[39:12] antidote so I think that's good it's
[39:13] good to hear the good news before the I
[39:16] don't know the other news anyway so 1
[39:19] Timothy 1:18 this charge I commit unto
[39:21] thee son Timothy according to the
[39:23] prophecies which went before on thee
[39:26] that thou by them might us fight a good
[39:29] Warfare amen so let's let's pray this
[39:31] afternoon almighty God we thank you so
[39:34] much Lord for this opportunity we can
[39:35] gather just pray Lord you just have
[39:37] preeminence Lord may your presence be so
[39:39] real in our midst father touch our
[39:41] hearts Lord speak to each one we love
[39:43] you Lord we thank you so much in Jesus
[39:45] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[39:47] you can have your seat so that we so we
[39:50] want to fight a good Warfare hey we want
[39:52] to fight a good Warfare we don't want to
[39:54] fight a bad Warfare average Warfare we
[39:56] want to fight a good one fight the good
[39:57] of Faith now we need to know the
[40:00] battlefield that we're in it's very
[40:02] important because you're you're equipped
[40:04] for the battlefield so for example right
[40:06] now this is World War II so this is the
[40:08] Kota Trail in Papa New Guinea okay
[40:10] jungle warfare stinking hot mud
[40:14] mosquitoes disease you don't wear a lot
[40:17] of you know you're wearing summer
[40:19] clothing jungle fighting very different
[40:21] kind of conditions okay now the contrast
[40:24] of this is uh this is I think Russian
[40:26] soldiers in the on the Russian front in
[40:28] World War III wintertime harsh cold
[40:31] bitter very cold okay both those
[40:34] battlefields are different aren't they
[40:36] like you wouldn't wear those kind of see
[40:37] that's all ice on them by the way okay
[40:39] they ice blizzard so you wouldn't wear
[40:42] that kind of clothing here because
[40:45] you'll uh get heat stroke you'll die
[40:47] just from the clothing you're wearing
[40:49] but at the same time you wouldn't wear
[40:50] the these clothing here cuz you're
[40:52] freeze to death okay so you got to be
[40:55] aware of the battle and how the enemy
[40:57] works on that Battlefield okay so now we
[41:00] we are we are in all in a battle
[41:01] children whether you like it or not
[41:03] we're here in a battlefield okay so we
[41:05] got to be aware of the conditions that
[41:07] we're facing and how the enemy comes
[41:09] against us right so now the conditions
[41:12] of the battlefield we live in as we live
[41:13] in this leosan age where Lan means
[41:16] everyone wants their rights okay and
[41:18] it's a lukewarm age right because so
[41:22] lukewarm
[41:24] now it means lacking conviction means
[41:27] half-hearted it's an age of apathy
[41:30] people are indifferent They Don't Really
[41:32] Care right you take the average kiwi not
[41:34] really passionate about much really
[41:37] maybe they all black sometimes right
[41:40] they're not very passionate people you
[41:42] know not very emotional kind of people
[41:44] why because there's a lot of apathy and
[41:47] when there's apathy there's no
[41:48] motivation to live to strive to do
[41:50] things better just kind of float along
[41:52] and then being lukewarm means lacking
[41:55] conviction being half-hearted so there's
[41:57] a spirit in this world that wants us to
[42:00] be this way okay there's a spirit in
[42:03] this world that wants us to be this way
[42:05] and it's also of course everyone wants
[42:07] their rights lady means the people's
[42:09] rights so but remember a Christian fits
[42:13] their rights because we fulfill
[42:15] everything to God we don't want our
[42:16] rights we want God's rights okay so we
[42:19] got to be aware of this because if we
[42:21] walk into this world and we're facing
[42:25] the enemy the wrong way we're going to
[42:26] get shot
[42:28] okay if you look at the battlefield
[42:30] World War II there especially on the uh
[42:32] Russian steps big open terrain long
[42:35] range flat ground you know you can't you
[42:38] can't walk around there like you would
[42:40] in the jungle where it's close it's
[42:42] dense it's it's different so you so they
[42:44] had to be trained to be in the
[42:46] battlefield they're in so now we've got
[42:48] to be aware that there's a spirit in
[42:50] this world that wants to make us feel
[42:52] this way okay and we understand that the
[42:56] apostle Paul spoke of what this world
[42:58] would be like the world we're in okay so
[43:01] he says know this also then the last
[43:03] days perilous time shall come so we're
[43:05] living in the last days is everyone with
[43:07] me class okay everyone on the front row
[43:09] here yes president accounted for yep
[43:12] good hello good so he says this this is
[43:15] the condition so remember all these
[43:17] conditions nothing just happens in a
[43:19] vacuum you know but there's a deliberate
[43:21] work of the enemy to make this come into
[43:24] manifestation but of course it was
[43:26] prophesied it would come because God
[43:28] always forars us of the conditions of
[43:30] the battlefield that we'll be born into
[43:33] so they'll be lovers of their ownselves
[43:35] Covetous boaster proud Blasphemous
[43:37] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[43:40] without natural without natural
[43:42] affection so they won't yeah we could
[43:44] break this all down but just to save
[43:46] time Tru Breakers false accusers
[43:48] incontinent fears despises those that
[43:50] are good traitors HD highminded lovers
[43:53] of pleasure more than lovers of God
[43:55] having a form of godliness but denying
[43:56] the power from such turn away right for
[44:00] uh for of this sort are they which creep
[44:02] into houses and Lead silly women later
[44:04] with sins lead away with d lead sorry
[44:07] lead captive silly women later with sins
[44:09] lead away with diverse
[44:11] lusts this is an age where things can
[44:14] creep into your home doesn't have to
[44:16] knock on the front door doesn't have to
[44:18] be a a piece of mail in the Box it just
[44:20] can slip in through a device and make
[44:23] people captive okay so now
[44:27] we got to be aware of this right we're
[44:30] not just remember we may be sheep but we
[44:32] have a great
[44:33] Shepherd okay and he instructs us to
[44:35] stay with him his word right but now
[44:39] Paul would say and through
[44:42] covetousness they shall make with f make
[44:45] shall they with feigned words make
[44:47] merchandise of you this world wants to
[44:50] make merchandise of you okay it wants to
[44:53] use you as a
[44:54] commodity right so a feigned word means
[44:56] an artificial one something that's
[44:58] molded it's it's false so they'll speak
[45:02] a false thing to you to make you to to
[45:06] to make merchandise out of you now I'm
[45:09] coming to now this is basically through
[45:11] the world of
[45:12] media okay I'm saying how the snake
[45:14] bites okay because we're going to
[45:16] realize like like the Bible says that
[45:18] you know the devil walks around like a
[45:21] roaring lion devouring who he will what
[45:24] does that look like you know is heit are
[45:26] we literally going to see a lion walking
[45:28] around who's seen a lion walking around
[45:30] the streets devouring people but yet
[45:32] he's he he's doing that but how's he
[45:35] doing it see if we're if we don't know
[45:37] how he's doing it how can we defend
[45:38] ourselves right so now so how he walks
[45:41] around is he is is is by by media by
[45:46] social media by movies Music Television
[45:49] the internet what is he doing he's he's
[45:52] with fed words trying to make
[45:53] merchandise out of you that's why people
[45:55] like social influencers they want you to
[45:58] subscribe they want you to click the
[46:01] Bell button to get notifications what's
[46:04] that they're trying to put their teeth
[46:06] into you to hold on to you that you
[46:08] become a captive audience that as soon
[46:10] as there's a ding-ding in your pocket
[46:12] you're you're there right what is that
[46:14] it is actually making merchandise of you
[46:16] because they make money out of
[46:18] you right this is how but but but but
[46:21] there's Venom in the fangs right because
[46:23] remember the internet there's nothing
[46:24] wrong with the Internet but it's what
[46:26] are you using it
[46:27] for because it'll either and we'll get
[46:30] to it but it will either paralyze you or
[46:33] you'll paralyze it that's right right so
[46:36] either either the glamour of this world
[46:38] will paralyze you paralyze your faith or
[46:42] you'll paralyze it your faith will
[46:43] paralyze it but it's your choice how you
[46:46] want it to be like we look at lot you I
[46:48] mean let's just look at the word
[46:49] paralyze so this is not really in order
[46:50] but you know let's look at being
[46:54] paralyzed uh so to take so so so to be
[46:57] paralyzed you've been affected by
[46:58] paralysis snake's venom paralyzes the
[47:01] mouse or snakes Venom paralyzes a person
[47:05] right and it's to make them powerless or
[47:07] ineffective see the devil wants us to be
[47:09] ineffective or powerless this is what
[47:11] the devil wants to make us this is what
[47:13] our enemy on this battlefield wants to
[47:15] make us he's not necessar interested in
[47:16] taking your life he just doesn't want
[47:18] you to be powerful right but God through
[47:20] his word wants you to be powerful see
[47:22] God sent you in this age doesn't matter
[47:24] what age you are to shake the kingdom of
[47:26] hell am right to lay ruin to his Works
[47:29] to cast down his everything he's done
[47:31] right but paralysis is a complete or
[47:33] partial loss of function especially when
[47:35] involving the motion or sensation in the
[47:37] part of a body it's a loss the ability
[47:39] to move or the state of powerlessness or
[47:42] in uh incapacity to act so something's
[47:45] been you know someone's been paralyzed
[47:47] with fear they're so fearful they can't
[47:49] act in a situation why because fear has
[47:51] paralyzed them right or who like
[47:53] whoever's who who has ever had a dead
[47:55] leg
[47:57] or you've slipped on your your hand and
[47:59] you wake up and there's no feeling it
[48:00] can't you can't really move it what it's
[48:02] partially paralyzed right cuz some
[48:04] weight has been on it you can't move it
[48:06] like and eventually you rub it you you
[48:08] pins the needles and then it's it's back
[48:09] right but if you kept the weight on it
[48:11] eventually that will get worse and worse
[48:13] what your limb becomes paralyzed and
[48:14] it's the same thing with your faith see
[48:16] the devil wants to paralyze your faith
[48:18] that it doesn't have the ability to act
[48:20] in your life anymore it doesn't matter
[48:21] what age we are this will this is going
[48:23] to affect us this is the battlefield
[48:25] we're in okay
[48:27] so you know we look at lot okay lot was
[48:30] in Sodom and Gomorrah we know that we're
[48:32] living in the days of lot again but
[48:35] lot's conscience was vexed he was
[48:38] grieved by his neighbors he was grieved
[48:41] by what he saw in the news in Sodom and
[48:43] Gomorrah he was grieved by what was
[48:44] going on about him but Sodom and
[48:46] Gomorrah paralyzed his faith that it was
[48:49] no longer effective in his life sorry
[48:52] this is not okay this may seem pretty
[48:54] down and hard and whatever but we're got
[48:56] to be real here the devil's not here to
[48:58] play tag you're it I got you I win this
[49:01] time no he wants to destroy you okay he
[49:03] wants to destroy your faith just make
[49:06] you that you can't act you know if
[49:08] someone's sick oh what do I do you know
[49:10] there's a you know there's a demon
[49:12] Spirit running ramp oh what do I do
[49:13] there's a bad atmosphere paralyzed you
[49:15] can't even pray and sing to change the
[49:17] atmosphere you can't stand against us he
[49:19] wants to paralyze you that that the
[49:21] thing just runs you over but we're not
[49:23] here to be run over we're here to we're
[49:26] here to wh stand every work of the
[49:29] enemy all right
[49:31] so
[49:33] now brother brah says this with
[49:36] Moses he said he said his faith his
[49:40] faith his eyes didn't fall on the
[49:42] glamour of Egypt it fell on the promise
[49:44] of God right so so the the world he
[49:47] lived in he looked beyond the glamour of
[49:50] Egypt see cuz he was an eagle he looked
[49:52] beyond those things but then but then
[49:55] brother R says he says like a woman I'm
[49:57] always calling to you about how you
[49:59] should let your hair grow out you
[50:00] mustn't you mustn't wear makeup you must
[50:02] act like ladies and Christians you look
[50:03] out upon the streets and see woman today
[50:05] dressed immorally and well you think
[50:07] well she belongs to church why can't I
[50:09] do that see and she cuts her hair why
[50:11] can't I do that see she seems to be just
[50:13] as sweet and such intellectual and a
[50:16] personality that that I haven't even got
[50:18] why can't I do that I ought to do it
[50:20] when you do that you paralyze your faith
[50:23] so when you begin to look at something
[50:24] of the world and say I want to be like
[50:26] that they're like that why can't I be
[50:28] like that then your faith is becoming
[50:29] paralyzed the snake has bit you okay the
[50:33] poison is starting to work because your
[50:35] faith begins to be paralyzed see you see
[50:37] you haven't given your faith a chance to
[50:40] grow see this is what especially after
[50:43] camp we got to give our faith a chance
[50:44] to grow who wants their faith to grow
[50:47] who wants to give their chance of Faith
[50:48] to grow well don't feed on the things of
[50:51] the world cuz it will bite you it will
[50:54] paralyze your faith so what happens when
[50:56] your faith becomes paralyzed you become
[50:57] indifferent you become numb you become
[51:00] desensitized you're not sincere anymore
[51:01] you don't care so much about God or
[51:04] anything he does you become numb to it
[51:06] see that's because why the devil's
[51:09] trying to paralyze your faith but you
[51:11] got to recognize it see stand against it
[51:14] now now what is glamour because brother
[51:15] Ram says here there's you know it was
[51:17] the glamour either um and he says in
[51:20] another place either either the glamour
[51:22] of the world will paralyze your faith or
[51:24] your faith will paralyze the glamour
[51:26] okay okay so glamour by definition is
[51:29] something that's exciting or often
[51:30] illusory or and and romantic
[51:33] attractiveness it seems and and this is
[51:35] why you know I don't think there's any
[51:37] influence in the world on YouTube or
[51:39] Instagram or Tik Tok whatever that have
[51:42] boring videos that are
[51:44] successful I don't think there's just
[51:46] someone badly lit bad sound no
[51:49] soundtrack in the back you know someone
[51:52] who just like rolled out of bed looks
[51:53] like a mess can't speak properly I don't
[51:56] think any anyone any video like that is
[51:58] going to go
[51:58] far there's no glamour to it there's
[52:01] nothing that's alluring there's nothing
[52:03] that you know you'd want out of that
[52:04] humanly right so they always make these
[52:07] things extra extra extra fancy beautiful
[52:11] neat you know it tries to grab the
[52:16] emotion of a person you know these
[52:19] things are very deliberately done
[52:21] McDonald's even the McDonald's
[52:22] restaurant has made a deliberate way
[52:24] they want you to get in eat and get out
[52:27] they don't want you to sit there for
[52:28] hours they want you to get in eat and
[52:29] get out right and it's been designed the
[52:31] lighting the the colors the Aesthetics
[52:33] everything of that place has been
[52:35] deliberately done and they say the same
[52:37] thing with social media there's this
[52:38] thing called brain
[52:40] hacking brain hacking is a thing where
[52:44] and so this is from 201 I think 17 this
[52:46] you it's just a opening thing about an
[52:48] article he says that the you know
[52:51] Silicon Valley and all the you know the
[52:53] tech World they call it some Pro program
[52:56] is call it brain
[52:58] hacking and so what they wanted is they
[53:00] make videos to hack your brain to change
[53:02] your thinking this is what poison does
[53:04] it changes your body you can't breathe
[53:07] like you normally can your blood your
[53:09] nerves go all these different things you
[53:10] know why because that Venom starts
[53:12] acting in your body and you can't
[53:13] function normally and it's like what
[53:15] happens is our brains get hacked by what
[53:18] we look at you know brother Braham said
[53:20] that you know he would he would read
[53:22] tazan in the Apes who's heard of tazan
[53:25] when he was young who who's heard of uh
[53:27] The Lone Ranger Lone Star Ranger right
[53:30] he read those books and when and you
[53:32] know when he when he read tazan he said
[53:34] he like spent a couple of months up on a
[53:36] tree he wanted to be tazan right and
[53:39] then when he then when he read The Lone
[53:40] Ranger when he was a kid he said he got
[53:42] his mom's broom and then he and he rode
[53:44] it to death as a hobby
[53:46] horse you know what hobby horse is do
[53:48] you want yeah see as a horse out of a
[53:49] broomstick right so what happened is
[53:51] what he read he wanted to become the
[53:53] character that he read and he wasn't
[53:55] planning I'm going to going to be like
[53:56] no it's just subconsciously cuz he was
[53:58] enjoying what he was reading it started
[54:01] to change his life and this is what
[54:03] brain hacking the social media all these
[54:05] things is you got to be careful because
[54:07] it will change your mood it'll change
[54:09] how you talk it'll change your attitude
[54:12] it'll change your respect for your
[54:14] parents or your peers or you know it'll
[54:16] change all those things because what
[54:17] your brain is actually being hacked you
[54:20] need virus antivirus software coming
[54:23] there you know we got to you know what
[54:25] is that that is like brother Jimmy said
[54:27] that's the Holy Ghost the blood of Jesus
[54:29] Christ to wash us to change us but you
[54:32] see it changes us whether we like it or
[54:35] not see this is the Warfare we're in
[54:37] this is what causes the apathy the
[54:38] lukewarmness is the changing of the
[54:40] thinking where the normal world people
[54:42] aren't satisfied with
[54:44] anymore okay see we got to be aware of
[54:46] where we're fighting okay I'm not going
[54:48] to be too much longer okay but so
[54:50] brother BR would say now now we know
[54:53] everything has a spirit right there's a
[54:56] that's being projected like you look at
[54:59] um you know you look at any any any
[55:01] country that's gone through a massive uh
[55:03] shift a spirit's been released and how's
[55:06] it been released through preaching
[55:08] politicians preach who's ever seen uh
[55:11] not that I can understand them but who's
[55:12] ever seen clips of uh Adolf Hitler
[55:15] giving a political talk you know what he
[55:17] finishes his speeches with amen just
[55:20] like the Lutheran priests that had
[55:22] finished preaching that's a amen at the
[55:23] end but very Dynamic very what he's
[55:25] anointed and that spirit that got on him
[55:27] spread around the nation and look at
[55:29] what it did but it changed their
[55:31] thinking changed their perspective on
[55:32] people and nationalities and all the
[55:34] horrible evil that that that Nation did
[55:37] is because a spirit brain hacked
[55:41] them right and it only took the
[55:43] anointing of God was the only thing that
[55:44] could withstand that thing and it's
[55:46] where you say well there's no nothing
[55:48] like that in this day and age but
[55:49] there's more subtle spirits that all it
[55:52] want to do is stop your love and desire
[55:54] for God
[55:58] right see brother Braham says about how
[56:00] your spirit of rock and roll he says
[56:02] outside the new birth it catches their
[56:04] attention just as quick as they hear it
[56:06] because in him is Born By Nature a
[56:08] carnal Spirit now brain hacking knows
[56:10] how to manipulate that Spirit and the
[56:12] power of the devil is so great today
[56:13] till it catches the spirit of that
[56:15] little one now I'm not putting fear on
[56:17] you because we just heard the the
[56:19] remedy right we have the not the Brazen
[56:23] servant but the one who gave the Brazen
[56:24] servant right we have the one who can
[56:26] heal can can deliver it doesn't matter
[56:28] how paralyzed someone can be right so
[56:31] spiritually now so I just want to ask a
[56:33] question how's your spiritual walk
[56:36] going old and young do you need one of
[56:39] them spiritually do you need someone to
[56:41] push you into the presence of
[56:43] God can you walk fine you know once you
[56:46] fine able-bodied you can run but now you
[56:49] you need a wheelchair so the girls were
[56:51] asked me last night what are you
[56:52] preaching on tomorrow dad is it going to
[56:54] be something juicy
[56:57] someone said I was that Mama anyway
[56:59] she's one of the girls you know going to
[57:01] be something juicy I said well it's
[57:03] going to be about spiritual do you need
[57:04] a spiritual wheelchair yeah right so
[57:08] because Spirits want to grab you at a
[57:10] young age like Jimmy said when he was
[57:12] what nine you said see that Spirit want
[57:14] to grab him and he lived under a lie for
[57:16] 13 years right and so people can live
[57:18] under lies like a social media thing
[57:21] they want to be like some influencer
[57:22] that doesn't care nothing about you does
[57:24] not want to help you none doesn't want
[57:25] to further your life all they want to do
[57:27] is make merchandise of you and your life
[57:30] that's all they want to that's all they
[57:31] care about you see so but the thing is
[57:35] we to understand that there is an answer
[57:38] for people who are
[57:40] paralyzed and this is what we are
[57:42] actually obligated to
[57:44] do okay here's a man he's in a bed he's
[57:47] paralyzed but he's got friends you see
[57:50] to me those four friends that took him
[57:52] to Jesus are the his real friends see
[57:55] the other ones may be sympathized and oh
[57:57] that's so bad and poor John or I don't
[57:59] know what his name is you know poor
[58:00] Jeremiah or something you know but the
[58:04] four friends realize no we want to help
[58:06] our friend we remember when when when
[58:08] they used to raise their hands in church
[58:10] they used to praise God they would
[58:11] touched at Camp you know they got
[58:13] baptized they were really enjoying the
[58:15] Lord they would sing and all these
[58:17] things we remember when he used to walk
[58:19] but what's happened to him because you
[58:21] know people say well I just don't feel I
[58:23] just feel so numb what's happened a
[58:24] serpent has bitten you right it's this
[58:27] doesn't just happen you know there's a
[58:29] reason a door opens spiritually and
[58:31] something comes in a snake comes and
[58:32] bites right so Johnny got bit okay but
[58:35] his friends weren't weren't happy with
[58:37] him being left in this condition because
[58:39] they remember a time when he was younger
[58:41] when he could run when he could walk
[58:43] right so what did they do they took him
[58:46] to where Jesus was amen they and and
[58:49] they didn't take no for an answer they
[58:50] didn't take a crowded room for an answer
[58:52] they what they do get up in the roof and
[58:54] they took the tiles off and B them into
[58:56] the presence of Jesus Christ now well
[58:58] how do you do that you pray till every
[59:00] obstacle is removed right you encourage
[59:03] okay let's go to youth group let's sing
[59:06] together amen let's pray together let's
[59:08] come to church let's do a special you
[59:10] know talk about God talk about a
[59:12] testimony even if you say well I can't
[59:14] think of your you know you can't think
[59:15] of your own testimony think of what
[59:17] about your parents testimony what about
[59:18] testimony brother brm or something God's
[59:20] done talk about it right encourage amen
[59:23] don't just don't just say well I guess
[59:24] they're growing up and they're going
[59:26] through a difficult time and this no you
[59:27] got to realize there's a snake has
[59:29] bitten but we have the
[59:31] antidote amen so you got to real and and
[59:33] then even even Johnny maybe he was
[59:35] paralyzed and maybe he used to say to
[59:37] his friends do you remember when we used
[59:38] to run together do you remember when
[59:40] when we used to really love church and
[59:43] love the word and we actually asked our
[59:45] parents to put on a message you know or
[59:48] I want to see a testim do you remember
[59:49] that you know what because there's
[59:51] always a memory of what God did the
[59:53] devil try to make it numb your mind but
[59:54] there's always that memory there right
[59:56] so maybe Johnny was like that and Johnny
[59:58] was like can you get me to Jesus again
[1:00:01] can we do those things again oh but I
[1:00:03] can't move my limbs and his friends
[1:00:04] would say yeah you can I know I know the
[1:00:07] brass serpent Hallelujah I know that
[1:00:09] there's an antidote what they do they
[1:00:11] took him to
[1:00:13] Jesus amen amen so don't
[1:00:17] be discouraged but I want to say this
[1:00:20] I'm going to leave it just with this we
[1:00:22] have the musicians please I want you to
[1:00:24] think long and good
[1:00:26] about this children are you Johnny on
[1:00:29] the
[1:00:30] bed or are you the friends
[1:00:33] helping okay what are you what are you
[1:00:35] doing in our friend groups and this is
[1:00:38] with adults as well are we encouraging
[1:00:40] each other towards the Lord or are we
[1:00:43] discouraging by keeping some kind of
[1:00:45] status quo because maybe the friends you
[1:00:47] know well they wouldn't have been
[1:00:48] friends if they said no Johnny you'll be
[1:00:50] okay you know let's just let's just talk
[1:00:53] and play and you know you're you're a
[1:00:54] but let's just you know no they
[1:00:56] wouldn't be friends his real friends
[1:00:59] were ones that took him to Jesus to get
[1:01:01] that venom out of him get that paralysis
[1:01:03] out of him okay so who wants to be that
[1:01:07] kind of a
[1:01:08] friend right who who wants to be shaped
[1:01:10] by the
[1:01:15] world get off your
[1:01:17] device if you feel like you have to
[1:01:20] you've got a problem I could spend a lot
[1:01:22] of time bring up research about how
[1:01:25] there's a lot of drug addicts but they
[1:01:26] don't shoot up with needles anymore they
[1:01:28] shoot up
[1:01:30] with
[1:01:32] this we don't want to be like that but
