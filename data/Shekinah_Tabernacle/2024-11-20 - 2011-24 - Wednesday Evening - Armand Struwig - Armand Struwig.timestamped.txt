[26:59] Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen
[27:03] thank you musicians Hallelujah I like
[27:06] this new church man you got some
[27:09] wingspan when you sing hey there's no
[27:11] nobody around you the other when we were
[27:13] in the old church you know and and it
[27:15] was it was a good place for us and I
[27:17] really enjoyed it man it sounds yeah I
[27:20] understand what you say brother Ben
[27:21] you're all so far
[27:22] away feels like I have to shout at you
[27:25] guys but but in the old church you
[27:27] always had to worry about who's the guy
[27:28] next to you you know because you don't
[27:29] want to poke them in the eye or you know
[27:31] give them a a slap or cuz it it it kind
[27:35] of brings you out of that anointing you
[27:37] know you get so in the song service and
[27:39] then the very first thing you do is you
[27:40] knock someone and you're like oh sorry
[27:42] and and it brings you back down to earth
[27:44] we don't want to be Earthbound we want
[27:46] to be Heavenly bound so so I encourage
[27:49] you make space and use your arms okay
[27:52] defy gravity hallelujah amen now it's a
[27:56] privilege to be able to speak to the Bri
[27:58] of Christ and I love all of you and
[27:59] tonight we got a couple of little things
[28:02] uh the Lord has placed on my heart and I
[28:04] asked that you know I always say this
[28:07] the more you pull there's always the
[28:09] devil on the one side of the rope and
[28:11] you on the other side of the rope and he
[28:14] wants to pull you into that Lake of Fire
[28:16] that's all he wants to do he just wants
[28:18] to destroy you he he really doesn't like
[28:20] you very much and that's fine we don't
[28:23] like him either okay if you look a bit
[28:26] around you in the world today he's done
[28:28] enough damage okay um can you turn me
[28:31] down on that fallback if there is a
[28:33] fallback just sounds like I'm going to
[28:35] little okay that that's just me it's my
[28:37] exing um but if you start pulling if you
[28:42] can start pulling and and you get that
[28:44] word for you you're actually gaining
[28:46] ground and you're pulling him closer to
[28:48] where he's going to end up anyways it's
[28:50] the Lake of Fire and sometimes it's hard
[28:52] because you had a big day but don't stop
[28:55] pulling because there's a blessing in it
[28:57] for you fight fight all the way boys
[28:59] okay if you have no teeth coming to
[29:02] death so uh we're going to turn our
[29:04] Bible to 1 Samuel and we're going to
[29:06] read there from the third
[29:08] chapter amen I almost so nervous
[29:10] standing here right
[29:15] Hallelujah I don't have a slideshow so
[29:17] I'll try to speak in pictures how's that
[29:20] sound I'll try my best I don't know how
[29:22] to do it brother Andy does it really
[29:23] well but I'll try as well and we're just
[29:25] going to read a couple of verses there
[29:27] and then you can have your seat before
[29:29] we pray first and then you can have your
[29:30] seats and it's it's called a call from
[29:34] the Lord we really want to hear God's
[29:37] voice in our day we we really
[29:40] desperately want to hear his voice amen
[29:44] but not just us but you as an individual
[29:49] so I encourage you don't stop until you
[29:52] hear his voice don't stop asking don't
[29:55] stop praying don't stop ever for a
[29:58] second until you hear his voice okay
[30:00] that's my encouragement for you tonight
[30:02] I'll try to keep it as lighthearted as
[30:04] possible it was a bit heavy some of it
[30:05] but don't worry we're going to get
[30:06] through it okay it says and the child
[30:09] Samuel ministered unto the Lord before
[30:11] Eli and the word of the Lord was
[30:14] precious in those days there was no open
[30:17] vision and it came to pass that at that
[30:20] time where Elias was laid down in his
[30:22] place his eyes began to wax them oh Lord
[30:26] help us and he could not
[30:29] see and here the lamp of God went out in
[30:33] the temple of the Lord where the Ark of
[30:35] God was and Samuel was laid down to
[30:39] sleep amen let's just ask the Lord to
[30:41] bless the reading of his word Lord Jesus
[30:43] we ask you know we can read these verses
[30:46] my Lord but it's only you that can open
[30:49] it up for us so we just ask tonight Lord
[30:51] would you bless this word take my lips
[30:53] it's yours Lord I fully surrender to you
[30:55] Lord I ask that everyone here as well
[30:58] Lord if there's any hindering spins
[31:00] anything keeping them back lord may you
[31:02] just take that in the name of our Lord
[31:03] Jesus Christ Lord and just rebuke those
[31:06] spirits send them away father and just
[31:08] give them a time of your presence in the
[31:10] name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you
[31:13] can have your
[31:15] seats so for you I've got a couple of
[31:18] nice definitions so open Vision it says
[31:21] here in verse two verse one it says and
[31:25] the word of the Lord was precious in
[31:27] those days days there was no open Vision
[31:30] so that means they were at a place where
[31:33] they had no Revelation so a open vision
[31:36] is showing you who you are where you are
[31:39] and where you're going to go it's it's
[31:42] God directly coming to your address now
[31:44] stay with me we we only started now you
[31:46] have to stay here I want to see eyes God
[31:49] coming straight to your address and
[31:50] actually personally starting to talk to
[31:52] you that's an open Vision now what Eli
[31:55] did here is he started to go into his
[31:58] old you know just into works you know I
[32:02] I just work I'm just a preach I I preach
[32:04] a sermon I just work and my sons get the
[32:07] offering and they do the sacrifices and
[32:10] they'll get the best meat out the
[32:11] sacrifices turn a little bit of a blind
[32:13] eye to it and he just started getting
[32:16] used to his day-to-day churchgoing
[32:18] member Sunday we're at church Wednesday
[32:20] we're a church you know we do church
[32:22] because we church goers just get used to
[32:25] it but the Bible says there he says his
[32:29] his eyes began to wax
[32:31] dim so I don't believe it's out of old
[32:34] age I believe it's out of routine cuz
[32:37] I've seen some people look back at me
[32:39] from the the congregation and their eyes
[32:42] wax dim have you ever seen it with
[32:45] brother V I don't know if you ever seen
[32:47] it you know and and I'm not listen just
[32:49] follow me they're like
[32:51] this and you speak to them and you look
[32:54] at them and they're like they're a
[32:55] million miles away their eyes are waxing
[32:58] them because remember we're in a very
[33:01] very evil time if you really go out
[33:04] there and you go to different churches
[33:06] the word of God is not there there is no
[33:08] there is no Revelation to help them
[33:12] overcome you know they keep pleading
[33:14] Grace they keep pleading Grace they keep
[33:16] pleading Mercy they they keep sinning
[33:18] and it's a it's this this whole thing
[33:21] the whole time it's just the whole cycle
[33:23] of sin and and Mountain experience and
[33:25] Valley and sin and forgiveness and sin
[33:28] and all those things and they just
[33:29] cannot they can't push through because
[33:32] see the word is not there and that's why
[33:35] God had to send us a prophet to to open
[33:37] the word again to us to show us who we
[33:40] are Hallelujah because see the word is
[33:42] so precious and he says in the end times
[33:45] people will look for that word and they
[33:47] will not find it and they'll go to Great
[33:49] extent to find it brother Ben and I we
[33:52] were today at a place he came and helped
[33:54] me to to clean a a temple
[33:58] and these these people pay a lot of
[34:00] money and they are very
[34:03] sincere very sincere and they spend
[34:07] millions of dollars we're not talking
[34:09] small money Millions I don't want to
[34:11] tell you how much but if I would say I
[34:13] give you 10 million to build us a church

[35:00] rest so when you come here tonight rest
[35:03] don't fall asleep but rest let the Lord
[35:06] Minister shake the tension off you know
[35:08] the worst thing when you get into a
[35:09] rugby game is and I used to play rby you
[35:12] stand there and the guy next to you is
[35:14] like your head and shoulders bigger than
[35:16] you and you're standing there in the
[35:17] line brother Ed will know all about this
[35:19] and uh you're going to run up to the
[35:22] field now and you're so tense you're so
[35:23] tense and you get next to this guy and
[35:25] you go oh dear
[35:27] like mate I shouldn't have looked and
[35:29] now you're tense all of you boys know
[35:32] what it's about and you get on the pitch
[35:34] and I used to kick off and they give you
[35:35] the ball and you look at the ball and
[35:37] you go to the line and you bounce the
[35:39] ball and all you want to do is I just
[35:40] need to kick this ball and you think man
[35:43] it's tension you're like okay forwards
[35:45] you're there and I don't really know
[35:46] what I'm doing and the reef looks at you
[35:47] and go are you ready and you're like
[35:50] yeah inside you're like nah that guy's
[35:54] going to kill me man he's bigger than me
[35:56] but then what happens is as those nerves
[35:58] are as as you get nervous there's an
[36:01] expectation coming and then muscle
[36:04] memory starts taking over then training
[36:06] starts taking over you young people then
[36:09] training in the word starts taking over
[36:11] now don't lose me now we're talking
[36:12] about open Vision then the prophet's
[36:14] message comes back as you walk as you
[36:17] get nervous and those type of things the
[36:19] message says calm
[36:20] down calm down I've got you I've got you
[36:24] I send a prophet to give you all these
[36:26] Mysteries that the people wonderand and
[36:28] grasp about calm down and you can take
[36:30] the ball and something just happens you
[36:34] go and he Blows the Whistle it goes and
[36:37] you go well boys time to play and you
[36:39] kick the ball and the moment you kick
[36:41] the ball you're in game mode so when we
[36:43] get to church that's the nervousness
[36:45] that's today you had a horrible day yeah
[36:47] fine today you struggled out there you
[36:49] you couldn't figure things out you come
[36:51] here you're all nervous but when the
[36:53] preaching and the song leader start
[36:54] singing it Is Well with My Soul you go
[36:57] it off it's going to be a good day it's
[37:00] going to be a good day God's going to
[37:01] talk to me and he's going to help me
[37:02] with whatever I struggle now now that
[37:04] wasn't in my notes that was for free so
[37:06] have it but
[37:09] see uh Eli he started dimming over
[37:12] because it started just becoming a
[37:13] ritual it's just we go to church we sing
[37:16] a couple of songs he ministers he
[37:18] preaches we all stand up when he says
[37:20] I'm about to close we're all happy we go
[37:22] home it it became like that yeah and
[37:25] then God said no
[37:28] says I I don't want this because it's
[37:30] now becoming a tradition so I'm going to
[37:32] remove myself from him and and the word
[37:35] of the Lord departed from
[37:38] Israel and and he said to Samuel listen
[37:40] Samuel I'm going to let you complete the
[37:42] work I'm going to let you you go on with
[37:44] the word but he wasn't very happy with
[37:46] that situation now I'm not saying he's
[37:47] not happy with our situation I I
[37:49] honestly think shakina is the best place
[37:52] to be I'm I'm sorry you know I love all
[37:55] of you so much I I cannot go to heaven
[37:58] with not not one of you not being there
[38:01] you know it's a love I can't describe to
[38:02] you I I cannot man I just I can think
[38:05] about anyone even Josh B bad hairstyle I
[38:08] can think of and I can have a smile okay
[38:10] you know all of you I don't look at Abes
[38:12] and go oh Abes I don't look at you know
[38:15] brother fish and go he's got a better
[38:16] chin than me or anything like that it's
[38:18] not like that yeah sorry fish but you
[38:21] know I don't look at that type of thing
[38:22] oh look at there's my brother Ben the
[38:24] Lord Has Done much in his life he's gone
[38:26] so far and he's still going so far so so
[38:29] when I get here I don't think I have to
[38:31] preach you into heaven I just know

[38:38] on man huh brother all your daughters

[38:45] so
[38:46] fortunate but now what happens to know
[38:48] is you need to know what God wants for
[38:49] you for your life now this is where the
[38:52] rubber hits the road and I want to talk
[38:54] a little about about influence tonight
[38:56] but before we get there I want to just
[38:58] talk about where you're going to find
[39:00] the will of God for your life you can
[39:03] play a million message tapes and miss
[39:07] it you can learn this message and recite
[39:10] it from A to Z you'll still miss it it
[39:14] is a personal relationship with Christ
[39:17] the the the one thing I want to bring
[39:19] back and I want you to listen to this

[41:29] Testament because the message is the old

[41:56] we we'll start at um acts 10 and we're
[41:59] just going to read from verse 1 to8 I'll
[42:00] do it in my best best of English and
[42:03] it's cornelius's
[42:05] Vision so so see how the Lord Works he's
[42:08] going to say Cornelius I'm going to send
[42:10] you I'm going to send you a little
[42:11] message from me but but I want you to
[42:15] experience it yourself so brother Armand
[42:18] brother Ben brother Jimmy brother Ed
[42:21] brother M brother Isaac I'm gonna I'm
[42:24] gonna throw you today with a a quote or
[42:26] a sermon but it's just for you can you
[42:29] take it and he says there was a certain
[42:32] man in uh oh ch ch or whatever called
[42:38] Cornelius a
[42:39] centurion um of the band called The
[42:43] Italian band I didn't know he was in a
[42:46] band that's cool see you guys you know
[42:49] there's there's the musicians in the
[42:50] Bible already but we're not making fun
[42:53] he's in a band a devout man one that
[42:55] feared God with all his house wow
[43:01] sincere feared God really with all his
[43:04] house and he prayed to God always so man
[43:07] this guy was in fellowship with God
[43:09] something had to happen something had to
[43:12] happen amen and he saw a vision uh
[43:15] evidently about the 9th hour of the day
[43:18] an angel of God coming to him and saying
[43:20] to him Cornelius and when he looked on
[43:23] him he was afraid and said what is it
[43:26] Lord
[43:28] he knew who his God was and he said unto
[43:29] him thy prayers and thy arms are come up
[43:34] as a memorial before
[43:36] God so when you pray when you have
[43:40] fellowship with God might take a while
[43:44] you know you might think God don't hear
[43:46] you you might think yes man I've been on
[43:48] my knees I've got calluses there already
[43:50] just stay there God hears Amen in in his
[43:54] time Sovereign and now I send a man to
[43:58] Jaa and I called him Simon whose surname
[44:01] is Peter he lodged with Simon the tenner
[44:04] whose house is by the seaside and he
[44:06] shall tell thou what thou oughtest to
[44:10] do so he's telling him because you love
[44:13] me so much I'm going to send the brother
[44:15] and sister from shakina Tabernacle to
[44:18] come and visit you by your work your
[44:21] school your place of residence to come
[44:24] and tell you about the seventh um Church
[44:27] Messenger to come and tell you about
[44:30] what God is doing in this time I want to
[44:33] make it personal he needs hands and feet
[44:36] yeah and he's now reached a very sincere
[44:40] Christian somebody that loves God and
[44:43] it's praying and asking him for
[44:45] Revelation and for showing where he is
[44:47] in time and he says I'm going to send
[44:49] you a vision so I want you he saw the
[44:51] vision nobody else and then he said so
[44:54] directly in the vision that I'm going to
[44:56] send the man to come and tell you what
[44:57] you need to
[44:58] do
[45:00] wow huh think about it how how important
[45:04] are you
[45:07] people it's important it's not bad don't
[45:10] feel sad about it listen God can send
[45:12] you anywhere to be a testimony for him
[45:15] and he works on both sides not just once
[45:18] both sides and he wants to send you
[45:20] there and he wants you to go hey go tell
[45:22] that man I love him right go tell that
[45:25] man he's one of mine just bring him in
[45:28] no matter and Donnie Reagan brother um
[45:30] Ed sent me a a little clip of brother
[45:32] Donnie Reagan that was preached about
[45:34] how should we be about the Sinners that
[45:36] come into our church that God goes and
[45:40] touches that Sinner and saves that man
[45:42] how should we bring him
[45:45] in you know no don't judge the sin or
[45:48] sinner just get the sin out of it and
[45:50] let's talk to the person let's get a
[45:52] little bit more personal in our walk
[45:54] with the Lord amen because he wants to
[45:56] use you yeah so bad cuz these guys like
[45:59] Cornelius out there waiting for you to
[46:01] come around their path and say hey the
[46:03] Lord showed me a vision and you were in
[46:05] it and he said your bride come and see
[46:09] huh he's been sitting next to you at
[46:11] work how long how long but today is his
[46:15] day of
[46:16] visitation amen oh Lord help us okay
[46:21] we're going to drop down there to verse
[46:23] 34 now Peter gets this and he goes and
[46:27] visits Cornelius and now he starts
[46:30] telling Cornelius how is this how's this
[46:33] going to work because Cornelius really
[46:35] wants a relationship with God but he's
[46:36] going to tell Cornelius this is how I
[46:38] think it should go this is what the Lord
[46:40] told me to tell you and we go there
[46:42] verse 34 it says preaching to Cornelius
[46:45] then Peter opened his mouth and said of
[46:47] a truth I perceive that God is no
[46:49] respector of person so I want to hammer
[46:52] on
[46:53] this there is no ranking with God
[46:57] there's no lead musicians or or big
[47:01] pastors or big deacons or sisters that's
[47:04] been in the message still the message
[47:06] started in 1954 45 or there's nothing
[47:11] like that God don't don't don't you ever
[47:14] get off on a tangent like that you know
[47:16] oh I came from a minister that was in
[47:18] this country and he ministered this
[47:20] certain way and he said this certain
[47:22] thing and get all of that out of your
[47:24] books straight away he's no respector of
[47:28] person and no matter how you put a
[47:30] person on that table or on that platform
[47:33] he's going to knock him down y we'll get
[47:35] to there we are not allowed to lift a
[47:38] brother up above any other brother or a
[47:41] sister God does send people and big oak
[47:43] trees and you can clean off them you
[47:45] know people that been been coming in
[47:47] like brother Colin he's got how many
[47:49] years under him and I can just sit in
[47:51] fellowship with him and get good
[47:53] gleanings off him and you respect those
[47:55] Brothers amen but he's is my brother and
[47:58] guess what in the Rapture he's going to
[48:00] be 21 and I'm going to be
[48:01] 21 who's older then come on man we all
[48:05] are going to be family so don't don't do
[48:08] that thing because what happens is when
[48:10] we and I'm going to get to it now but
[48:11] when you do a ranking you you start
[48:13] lifting people up and then when that
[48:16] that person uh disappoints you you know
[48:20] you you fall in your walk with the Lord
[48:22] because you base your walk on the Lord
[48:24] and with the Lord on what a person's
[48:26] opinion
[48:27] or way they conduct themselves or how
[48:29] they see the word you you major on that
[48:31] and not the word of God so Cornelius
[48:33] here picks it up and he says no no no no
[48:35] God doesn't respect the person he
[48:38] doesn't respect the persons well let me
[48:39] tell you what he does he says but every
[48:42] nation that fearth him verse 35 and
[48:45] worketh righteousness is accepted with
[48:47] him the word which God sent to the
[48:50] children of Israel the
[48:52] word remember he sent Jesus Christ to
[48:56] Israel
[48:57] okay the word became flesh and dwelt
[48:59] among us and we beheld his glory I'm
[49:01] going to send the word to them this book
[49:04] in flesh form and then look he goes on
[49:07] to it and he says preaching peace of
[49:10] Jesus Christ he is the Lord of all that
[49:14] word I say ye know which was published
[49:17] throughout all of
[49:19] Judea so he says this word of Jesus
[49:23] Christ all the Miracles that followed
[49:25] him all the wonderful thing he done
[49:26] everything it preached the Beatitudes
[49:28] all those things it was published and
[49:31] it's
[49:31] available so get into your word he says
[49:35] Cornelius no matter how much you jump up
[49:36] and down go find it out for
[49:40] yourself I can only lead you that far
[49:42] but the rest of it you need to go you
[49:44] need to get into the word
[49:47] amen so that means that it's a it's a
[49:51] such a personal thing that he has to
[49:53] become one with his word he has to
[49:55] become one with this book he has to eat
[49:57] this
[49:58] book for it shall be sweet in your mouth
[50:03] and bitter in your belly cuz some of
[50:06] these words oh man they're just
[50:07] beautiful hey you can have whatever you
[50:09] want you just ask God it's all good and
[50:11] then other times he says please don't do
[50:13] this and you're like o it's a OD
[50:15] saying but all he wants you to do is
[50:18] just stay in my word are are you still
[50:20] here amen
[50:22] okay okay because he says if you do that
[50:27] you'll be accepted in the
[50:29] Beloved God just will accept you and
[50:32] that's in verse 35 he says there um but
[50:36] every nation that e fearth him and
[50:38] worketh righteousness is accepted with
[50:41] him so just on the basics that you have
[50:44] respect for who's ever standing on this
[50:46] by this Pulpit not lifting them up
[50:48] respect the one that's sitting next to
[50:50] you the one that's sitting in front of
[50:51] you the one that's sitting behind you
[50:53] the one that's not here if you keep your
[50:56] respect for for them you keep your love
[50:57] for them amen God will just go let's
[51:01] move on cuz it becomes a one-on-one walk
[51:03] with God we go on and I'll use the
[51:06] example of it let's turn mate these
[51:08] Pages go everywhere hey that one's
[51:11] done Isaiah let's go to the book of
[51:14] Isaiah amen Isaiah 6 it's a little bit
[51:16] of a little bit of homework but it's
[51:19] good amen
[51:22] amen Isaiah 6 I had it here
[51:27] so now one day and I want to read you
[51:29] this
[51:30] quote I see to read this and I want to
[51:33] read this I I I want you encourage you
[51:36] to go and listen to brother bram's uh
[51:41] tape on
[51:42] y um I'll send the the link on brothers
[51:45] and sisters if you want to do it brother
[51:46] Ben if that's okay go listen to it man
[51:50] it will just encourage you it encouraged
[51:52] me man it just when when when things go
[51:55] so crazy all of a show he just goes hold
[51:57] on hold on here you go just go go chew
[52:00] on this for a while oh man it has been a
[52:02] blessing and he says here in the book of
[52:04] Isaiah and I want to start with this
[52:07] quote and we'll read the first verse he
[52:10] says the year that King Uzziah died I
[52:12] also saw the Lord sitting upon the
[52:14] throne high and lifted up and he trained
[52:17] fill the
[52:19] temple so what happened here now is we
[52:22] know that that Isaiah he he really he
[52:26] loved this King Uzziah and brother
[52:29] Brandon picks this up here and he says
[52:31] he loved him so much that he he was he
[52:33] was he was leaning on his arm he said so
[52:35] Isaiah he could lean upon the the king's
[52:38] arm this is quote number 99:99 and he
[52:41] was a young man of favor a fine spirit
[52:44] in this young man so the king loved him
[52:47] and one day the props got knocked out
[52:50] from under under him so he looked up to
[52:53] this King but God didn't want him to be
[52:56] under a headship of a man God don't want
[52:59] you to be under just the headship of a
[53:01] man if you don't if you don't follow
[53:03] what any man preach or any angel or any
[53:05] Minister preaches and it's not in the
[53:08] word stay clear of it because you you
[53:11] don't want to go on the headship of a
[53:12] man though brother brother Ben is Our
[53:14] Shepherd and I shared the message a
[53:16] little bit with him and he didn't look
[53:17] at me too funny and so I know he's not
[53:20] too worried about this one but he but
[53:22] just remember brother Ben if he's
[53:24] deciding tonight to walk out of those
[53:26] church and said I'm done and he walks
[53:30] out and brother Isaac said you know what
[53:33] if he walks I walk too I want to ask you
[53:35] where you're going to
[53:37] go what did you base your relationship
[53:40] with Christ on your pastor cuz I've seen
[53:43] churches fall apart when pastors die yes
[53:46] sir completely fall apart sorry I
[53:51] Pat no serious they fall apart the
[53:53] deacons wants to run the show and this
[53:55] one and we heard about bit of
[53:57] testimonies and I saw
[54:00] chaos absolute chaos I need to maybe
[54:03] drink some water but and it hurts me to
[54:06] see that men build men up and then when
[54:09] those men leave churches or die or pass
[54:11] on and God's done with him the whole
[54:13] church falls apart yeah it just tells me
[54:17] they were never based on the word of God
[54:19] they were only based on a concept of the
[54:22] message sorry it's hard we had people
[54:26] out of this church as well devastated us
[54:30] but we still
[54:32] here because there's more there's more
[54:35] holding me than just a couple of good
[54:38] scriptures that a pastor says off the
[54:40] pulpit though we have the most amazing
[54:43] Pastor in the world and I'll always
[54:46] stick with him as M but if he leaves
[54:48] this door and he says it's over with a
[54:49] message brother man I'm coming for you
[54:51] I'll knock some sense into you because
[54:53] the thing is I can see what the message
[54:56] prod
[54:57] produces this is a 11 testimony you
[55:00] asked me 30 when I was at the age of 32
[55:03] would I be doing this I would tell you
[55:05] never in my
[55:06] life
[55:09] promise the words of brother Isaac
[55:12] Brother Andy he said all he could talk
[55:14] about is cricket and
[55:17] smoking that was what filled
[55:20] this until I meet him but see now with
[55:24] Uzziah and now I'll leave I'll leave
[55:25] that just for the we we'll go on with it
[55:27] but Uzziah when he got removed Isaiah
[55:31] looked at this thing and then brother
[55:33] Brandon picks up it says and he looked
[55:35] around him go listen to that sermon and
[55:38] he realized that the world was not
[55:41] everyone like King
[55:43] Uzziah and that it were evil place a
[55:47] place where people speak unclean because
[55:50] remember he was only in the presence of
[55:52] mom and dad the whole time you home
[55:54] school children listen listen to me no
[55:57] no this is good for you listen I want to
[55:59] encourage you Mommy and Daddy not every
[56:02] mommy and daddy is like
[56:05] them you children that stay at home or
[56:08] that has a mom and dad that's filled
[56:10] with the Holy Ghost not all parents are
[56:12] like them I came from a house where
[56:15] there was no holy ghost in that house I
[56:18] can tell
[56:19] you they not all like that the holy
[56:22] ghost is now in that place praise the
[56:25] Lord but before then it wasn't in there
[56:28] and it's not a nice place to dwell
[56:30] because you never know where you
[56:33] stand you know we never know where you
[56:35] are there's always tension there's
[56:37] always fighting there's always that the
[56:39] depression it's all it so makes you so
[56:42] nervous we need more of God because it
[56:45] makes a house wholesome so you might
[56:47] think your parents are all boring
[56:49] because they put all these Gates
[56:50] everywhere boys and girls but they want
[56:52] to stop certain influences in your life
[56:55] from influencing you to do the wrong
[56:58] stupid thing that we did too yes
[57:02] sir because guess what When We Were
[57:04] Young we also made mistakes and when
[57:07] you're young you going to make mistakes
[57:09] but we here we want to go to the
[57:10] children and say I don't mind you making
[57:12] a mistake but how do we fix it how do we
[57:16] get over this because we're
[57:18] Overcomers so God goes and removes
[57:21] Uzziah away and Isaiah the props get
[57:24] knocked out of him and he starts
[57:26] realizing he's a man with unclean lips
[57:29] and he's now just seen that these two
[57:31] cherin that comes and they they got
[57:34] their faces covered with two wings and
[57:36] they got their feet covered with two
[57:37] wings and with two Wings they fly it's a
[57:39] it's a it would have been such a vision
[57:41] and the one cries out to the other one
[57:43] holy holy holy and the temple
[57:46] shook oh man it was it would have been
[57:49] something for him to see so he got some
[57:52] sense knocked into him right there but
[57:55] he had to get under under the influence
[57:56] of the king had to get away from it and
[57:58] the moment that friend of yours at
[58:01] school is out of the
[58:04] scene the the one that so makes you do
[58:06] all the things you shouldn't do the
[58:08] moment you can get away from that guy
[58:10] and have a little bit of time with the
[58:12] Lord and spend some time there things
[58:14] happen you start realizing I'm a man
[58:17] with unclean lips and I dwell amongst
[58:20] the people that has unclean
[58:23] lips and Lord how am I going to do it
[58:27] how am I going to do it and the angel
[58:30] goes and he grabs this coal of the fire
[58:33] and he takes it to Isaiah and he touch
[58:35] his lips and he says I'm going to
[58:38] sanctify you because you already
[58:40] realized you need me amen you're already
[58:43] justification I need
[58:45] Christ ABCs always believe Christ I need
[58:49] Christ but then the Angel takes that
[58:52] call and he touches his lips and he
[58:55] becomes
[58:58] whole and but the Bible says there the
[59:01] iniquity and the sin is getting taken
[59:03] away so iniquity children if you didn't
[59:05] know I didn't know either iniquity is
[59:08] doing something that you know you
[59:10] shouldn't be doing where God has
[59:12] revealed for you something he's busy
[59:14] talking to you he's busy drawing you and
[59:17] you willingly look away it's a worker of
[59:19] iniquity you know you ought to do it you
[59:23] know it's not right not willfully
[59:25] sinning hold on you just turn a blind
[59:27] eye to that and say hey if I don't know
[59:29] it then God won't judge me on this
[59:32] that's
[59:33] iniquity you
[59:35] know so God wants to remove that
[59:38] iniquity away from you wants to remove
[59:39] the sin from you and then what he said
[59:41] to Isaiah he says I want to send you to
[59:44] go preach to a people but they're going
[59:46] to reject your message but I first need
[59:48] to clean you up they did they rejected
[59:51] his message he says you're going to make
[59:52] their hearts fat and marry what did he
[59:54] say listen listen to this so
[59:57] beautiful he says I heard the voice of
[1:00:00] the Lord say who shall I send and go
[1:00:02] forth and then he said Lord you cleanse
[1:00:04] me send me here I
[1:00:05] go but now he says to him Ye Ye indeed
[1:00:09] but understand not he said oh no sorry
[1:00:12] it says and he said go and tell this
[1:00:15] people he he
[1:00:17] indeed but understand not and see ye
[1:00:20] indeed but perceive not make the heart
[1:00:22] of this people fat and make their ears
[1:00:25] heavy and shut their eyes morning let
[1:00:29] them see with their eyes and hear with
[1:00:31] their ears and understand with their
[1:00:33] heart and convert and be um
[1:00:36] healed but they won't listen they're
[1:00:38] going to reject your
[1:00:40] message cuz they don't want the truth in
[1:00:42] this hour they don't want to come out of
[1:00:44] the sleep that they don't want to come
[1:00:46] out of the lullaby they want to have the
[1:00:48] YouTube videos and all those things and
[1:00:50] you know they want to be in the
[1:00:51] influence of of a international rugby
[1:00:54] player or a box or they want that
[1:00:57] influence in their
[1:00:59] life they want that influence they don't
[1:01:01] want to hear you and Mom and Dad has
[1:01:03] been preaching it how long and now it's
[1:01:05] coming over the pulpit now you don't
[1:01:06] want to hear that then you're a worker
[1:01:08] of
[1:01:09] iniquity and that's not a good place to
[1:01:12] be because then God goes I have to now
[1:01:13] take gloves off because you're my child
[1:01:16] and I'm going to have to get your
[1:01:17] attention somehow and now your trial
[1:01:20] start but don't worry do is a light we
[1:01:24] get we're getting somewhere just follow
[1:01:25] me
[1:01:26] so then Isaiah realized he's unclean and
[1:01:30] then Isaiah jumped into an action and he
[1:01:32] wrote the whole
[1:01:35] Bible cuz God he met God he got clean
[1:01:40] and then he got the inspiration of God
[1:01:42] and he wrote the Bible from Genesis and
[1:01:44] Revelation in 66
[1:01:46] books huh yes man 66 chapters or is it
[1:01:51] 68 one of the two I think it's 66 I'll
[1:01:54] go to the end of the book I'll tell you
[1:01:56] hanging
[1:01:58] there 66 yeah so thank you Lord but the
[1:02:03] thing is he had to be cut from those
[1:02:05] friends those people they lean on too
[1:02:07] much his favorite preacher especially
[1:02:10] the guys that's on YouTube that loves
[1:02:12] all this YouTube preaching hey nothing
[1:02:14] against it my mom and dad streams our
[1:02:16] services hello Mom and Dad I love you
[1:02:19] they love being here they don't have
[1:02:21] Fellowship where they are so there is a
[1:02:23] place for it but be careful where you
[1:02:26] lean because brother Ben has been
[1:02:28] ministered and placed in a certain area
[1:02:31] for a certain people and there is nobody
[1:02:34] that's going to pray for you like that
[1:02:36] man I can tell you now I hurt my back
[1:02:39] when I was still working in a tow shop
[1:02:41] and I I lifted up some tiles and it was
[1:02:43] just before camp and as I turned I just
[1:02:46] I just pinged my back but really bad and
[1:02:49] the boss said to me you will keep on
[1:02:51] working and because I wanted to go to
[1:02:53] Camp I just kept on working and I just
[1:02:55] pushed through the pain but when I got
[1:02:56] home I just
[1:02:58] crumbled and brother Ben heard it and he
[1:03:00] was on his way home basically kicked the
[1:03:03] for the front door down to come and pray
[1:03:05] for me it's the first time a man a
[1:03:08] pastor came and knelt by my bed and
[1:03:11] prayed for me it was one of the
[1:03:13] awesomest experiences I had wasn't
[1:03:16] suddenly healed don't don't get me wrong
[1:03:19] he's still God's a miracle working God
[1:03:21] and sometimes it just takes a little bit
[1:03:22] of time but I made it to Camp
[1:03:26] I made it to
[1:03:27] Camp so that man God bless you brother
[1:03:30] Ben you have done so much for us and
[1:03:32] keep doing it and you Sister Christine

[1:12:30] shiny you don't need it you need the
[1:12:32] word of God you need to stay in your
[1:12:34] word you need to feed of the word of God
[1:12:38] I'll close with this he says when this
[1:12:41] Prince of Persia comes in like a
[1:12:44] flood when when we prayed for sister
[1:12:48] Robin and the Devil comes in and says
[1:12:50] you're not going to get you
[1:12:52] healing when we pray for someone here
[1:12:54] coming for for and they say anoint them
[1:12:57] with oil and pray for them and they
[1:12:59] shall be healed when it when it GES gets
[1:13:01] to day 18 or or when you are depressed
[1:13:04] for long enough or just discouraged for
[1:13:06] long
[1:13:08] enough just hang in there 21 days if you
[1:13:12] need to 21 years if you need to I've
[1:13:15] seen people that God didn't answer their
[1:13:17] prayers for 21
[1:13:20] years I'm a witness to
[1:13:23] it but God willor answer if you just
[1:13:26] stay on your knees don't lose the battle
[1:13:29] remember you're living in an evil age
[1:13:32] and it does affect this it doesn't
[1:13:36] affect this but it does affect this and
[1:13:40] sometimes you just need to pray a little
[1:13:41] bit harder amen but don't lose courage
