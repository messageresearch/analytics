[40:28] amen amen God bless you friends you can
[40:31] have your seats this morning I want to
[40:32] um been listening to the sermon brother
[40:34] B preached about a guide and I really
[40:36] enjoyed that so I want to just just go
[40:38] into uh how he's our guide today and I
[40:40] trust he's your guide amen this morning
[40:43] now we know that man will man from from
[40:46] uh from the fall has has been his own
[40:48] guide where he decided that you know
[40:50] he'll take uh wisdom of of of the
[40:53] serpent above the word of God and so
[40:55] he's always been guiding guiding himself
[40:57] and we know that man man has been placed
[40:59] on free moral agency so you've got to
[41:01] choose the guide that guides you you
[41:03] know you can't just be you know God
[41:05] doesn't you know arrest you and mug you
[41:07] and force you to be led by him but you
[41:10] got to choose it in your own own self
[41:12] amen and now we know is Jesus said he'll
[41:14] guide you into all truth and we know
[41:16] that he's a personal guide he's not just
[41:18] a collective guide but but he wants to
[41:21] guide us personally and the only way
[41:23] that we can uh have him come into our
[41:25] lives and guide us is when he comes on
[41:27] the inside of us by the baptism of the
[41:29] Holy Ghost and then he becomes our guide
[41:31] now now there's things you know you got
[41:34] to have a qualified guide you know you
[41:35] can't just have any guide guiding you
[41:37] you got to have someone that knows the
[41:39] place you're going to go amen they they
[41:41] need to have detailed knowledge of where
[41:43] you're going to go you know it's more
[41:44] than just Googling a nice place and then
[41:45] saying you're a guide you got to be
[41:47] there experience it know the pfalls the
[41:49] dangers the troubles what to do when an
[41:52] emergency strikes to be a guide you've
[41:54] got to have these kind of qualifications
[41:55] you got to be calm when there's a time
[41:57] of distress you know you can't Panic
[41:59] like maybe everyone else is panicking if
[42:01] you're a guide you're calm anden you
[42:03] know the enemies or the dangers that are
[42:05] in those certain environments you know I
[42:07] remember when I was um you know when my
[42:09] parents lived up in Papa New Guinea and
[42:11] I decided to take a um in the monsoon
[42:13] season I decided to take a Twan hobiecat
[42:15] yacht Sailing by myself now I know how
[42:19] to sail in New Zealand but I've never
[42:20] been sailing in the monsoon season
[42:22] before and if I took a guide with me who
[42:24] actually knew what it's like to sail in
[42:25] the Mons
[42:26] you cuz the monsoon season it's it's
[42:28] it's Summit well it's the wet season
[42:30] it's this time of year it can be very
[42:31] still for most of the day and then it
[42:33] just starts blowing and then a lot of
[42:35] shipwrecks in the past happen in the
[42:37] monsoon season because it's a very you
[42:39] know it just happens very abruptly if
[42:40] you're not prepared you can you can sink
[42:42] you can capsize whatever more and I
[42:44] decided Well it's not very windy it's a
[42:46] nice day I'm going to go sailing now
[42:48] first mistake is I only went by myself
[42:50] in a Twan yacht you know you and and you
[42:53] you know this is fellowship we meant to
[42:54] be having us and God in a boat right but
[42:56] I decided to take my you know take this
[42:58] Twan yacht that you got to use harnesses
[43:00] on most of the time it's actually only
[43:02] your feet on the boat because you're
[43:03] hanging on a harness on the outside of
[43:04] it it's real fun you go fast and it's
[43:06] real fun you know but anyway I didn't
[43:08] have a harness and it was only by myself
[43:10] and it was a monsoon season now now if I
[43:12] if I was experienced sailing in those
[43:14] kind of conditions I'd know when the
[43:16] first gust comes starts coming along the
[43:18] bay I've got to get back into Shore
[43:20] because if I don't start heating back
[43:21] into Shore those gusts are going to get
[43:23] closer together then it's really going
[43:24] to blow and I'm going to capsize and
[43:26] that's exactly what happened so the
[43:28] first gust came and you know see I
[43:30] wasn't qualified or experienced to sail
[43:32] in the monsoons but I know what it's
[43:33] like to sail in Gusty conditions you
[43:35] know gust is like there's a bit of wind
[43:37] there's a you know burst of wind comes
[43:38] through then the wind dies down then it
[43:40] comes back again you know and you can
[43:42] watch it come on the water coming
[43:43] towards you but then what happened is in
[43:45] those conditions as the first gust came
[43:47] well I just enjoyed the ride then the
[43:49] second gust came and the third and they
[43:51] started running closer and closer
[43:52] together so it started blowing and as
[43:54] soon as it did that now I saw it come
[43:56] coming on the water but I didn't have
[43:57] the way out of you know you know the way
[43:59] out and we can see trouble coming but if
[44:01] you don't have the guide with you how
[44:02] you going to get out of the trouble so
[44:04] when the wind really started blowing the
[44:06] the boat capsized on its side and I
[44:08] couldn't get it back over I you know
[44:11] I've had experience riding boats here
[44:13] you know remember sailing in Poverty Bay
[44:15] you know the boat I was going downwind
[44:17] the boat starts cartwheeling you you
[44:19] know you get spit out the front the
[44:20] thing goes flying forward and you got to
[44:21] swim after it and so I know what it's
[44:23] like to get a boat over but not that
[44:24] kind of a boat that kind in the monsoon
[44:27] season I couldn't get the thing over and
[44:29] I could only get it halfway over and I
[44:31] don't have a picture of it maybe I
[44:32] should have got one but you know there's
[44:33] a trampoline in the middle of the boat
[44:35] so if the boat's halfway up that thing
[44:37] acts as a sail and so I was being blown
[44:39] out to sea thankfully I was being blown
[44:42] to the opposite shore of the bay but if
[44:43] I was just a little bit further out I
[44:44] would have gone out to sea now there's
[44:46] no Coast Guard there there's no one to
[44:47] help you there but if I had a guide it
[44:50] would have been a a lot less dangerous
[44:52] but thankfully I got blown across the
[44:53] side of the bay got the boat over when
[44:55] it was shallow and enough and I said and
[44:57] I actually got towed back someone came
[44:58] to come and get me but you see if I had
[45:00] a guide they would have said this is a
[45:02] bad idea I know these Waters I know this
[45:05] environment I know these conditions you
[45:07] are setting yourself up to fail but the
[45:10] problem is I took my own what I thought
[45:12] I could do and then I went with it and I
[45:15] nearly ended up being washed out to seea
[45:18] you know and man has been its own guide
[45:20] from from the fall yeah God has always
[45:22] wanted to be the guide of man but man
[45:24] has always wanted to be his own guide
[45:26] and you see where that's LED man it's
[45:28] leading man to a nuclear war you know we
[45:30] think we have all the answers all the
[45:32] technology and man just makes more
[45:33] technology to kill each other and this
[45:35] is where the world is facing is because
[45:37] man has wanted to be his own guide but
[45:39] I'm so thankful that God has always
[45:42] wanted to be the guide of man he's
[45:44] always wanted to step on the scene
[45:45] because remember he knows what's coming
[45:47] he knows the environment far better than
[45:50] we ever know it amen he knows what the
[45:52] conditions of the age we're alive in
[45:54] amen he knows everything and he's placed
[45:57] his guide book here am right see he says
[46:00] that he will show you things to come so
[46:01] a guide doesn't just tell you what's
[46:03] happening he's going to tell you what's
[46:05] going to happen when you get there am
[46:07] mean you see a guide is not like a
[46:08] tourist that just reacts to things as
[46:10] they go along on a safari but they know
[46:12] exactly where they're going they know
[46:13] exactly where they're going to take you
[46:15] and they know what you're going to be
[46:16] showing and they know how to get out of
[46:18] there amen so I would want to if I
[46:20] wanted to go on a guided hunting trip or
[46:22] anything I'd take a good guide yeah I
[46:24] wouldn't take a guide that's just just
[46:27] like say for example going to South
[46:28] Africa I wouldn't take a guy that's just
[46:29] read the Loney Planet magazine on the
[46:31] way there you know I'd want someone who
[46:34] knows the nature of the animals who
[46:36] knows how to deal with the animals you
[46:38] know like who's ever seen those videos
[46:40] maybe I should have brought it but you
[46:41] know there's this there's this elephant
[46:43] Hunter and and and um I don't think it's
[46:46] on YouTube but anyway we were showing it
[46:48] when we were there Christine and I and
[46:49] he said an elephant always run and stand
[46:51] by something doesn't matter how small or
[46:53] big they run from a tree to a tree and
[46:55] chose the the nature of how they charge
[46:56] and if they're bluffing and if they're
[46:58] not and you know there was this this guy
[47:01] had this bull elephant literally come
[47:02] right up in front of the people but he
[47:05] knew exactly what he was doing he wasn't
[47:07] bluffing it wasn't a show he knew the
[47:09] danger of that animal he knew what it
[47:10] was capable of but he knew how to stop
[47:12] it in its tracks that's the kind of guy
[47:15] I would want if I'm walking in the
[47:17] Krueger I want that kind of a guy I
[47:19] don't want me with a YouTube channel
[47:20] looking about how to do things I want a
[47:22] guy who's experienced right and our lord
[47:24] Jesus is the most experience God there
[47:26] ever will be has been and can be amen
[47:29] because he knows everything he knows the
[47:31] hearts of all men he knows what's
[47:32] happening in the future he knows the
[47:34] hearts of our enemy he knows all things
[47:36] so I would I would have him as my guide
[47:38] amen I think he's the best guide to
[47:40] haveall amen so everyone who's ever been
[47:43] led by God has been Guided by him amen
[47:47] but you see the thing is the main thing
[47:48] we must do is always not lean to our own
[47:51] understanding you know cuz how many
[47:53] people been caught out in the bush even
[47:54] in this country and perish because they
[47:56] lean to their own understanding they
[47:57] took what they thought they needed they
[47:59] looked at the weather and thought well
[48:00] this is how it's going to be and they
[48:01] get trapped out there because they
[48:03] didn't take a guide they just went with
[48:05] their own understanding and I say this
[48:07] is the reason this world is facing
[48:09] nuclear war is because man has been
[48:11] leaning to its own understanding if I
[48:13] have enough bombs I can intimidate the
[48:15] other I can do what I want but there
[48:16] comes an end to that amen Napoleon came
[48:19] to his end he thought he could just you
[48:21] know defeat Europe and just move on but
[48:23] but but he was defeated Hitler was
[48:25] defeated all these different ones were
[48:26] defeated and I say this world has come
[48:28] to that same place once again man has
[48:30] not learned because why because man
[48:32] wants to be his own guide even with his
[48:34] all understanding and His science and
[48:36] his ability we cannot guide ourselves
[48:38] that's right amen we need him amen now a
[48:42] guide will if he's going to take you a
[48:44] place if he's a real guide he will take
[48:46] you to that place amen he won't take you
[48:48] somewhere else he won't take you to a
[48:50] place that you know which is near enough
[48:52] as good enough he'll take you exactly to
[48:54] that place now
[48:56] God God would speak to
[48:59] Abraham and he basically said to him I'm
[49:01] going to be your guide Abraham I'm going
[49:03] to take you from this country from your
[49:04] Kindred I'm going to take you to a land
[49:06] that I've given you now we know that
[49:08] Abraham ended up where his guide said he
[49:10] would end up right he didn't end up
[49:12] somewhere else he didn't end up in China
[49:14] he didn't end up down in India he didn't
[49:16] even end up in Turkey he ended up in the
[49:18] promised land amen so so our lord Jesus
[49:21] the real guide will will guide you
[49:24] exactly where he's meant to go you amen
[49:26] aren't you thankful for
[49:27] that amen now it's very important that
[49:30] we stay with our guide because he knows
[49:32] the future he's not surprised the world
[49:34] is in this condition we know the Bible
[49:36] prophesied as it was in the days of
[49:38] Sodom so shall it be in the days of the
[49:39] son of man so as it was in Sodom and
[49:41] Gomorrah it's been repeated in this day
[49:43] he knew because the guide knows the
[49:44] terrain he knows the spirits that are
[49:46] going to come into the world he knows
[49:47] the trouble that's going to be here and
[49:49] he forewarns us of these things and say
[49:51] when you see this this is going to
[49:52] happen am mean so when you see Sodom and
[49:54] Gomorrah on the streets again and you
[49:55] know that the son of man's going to be
[49:57] revealed you know the Rapture is going
[49:58] to take place he said when you see the
[49:59] Fig Tre put forth its buds you know
[50:01] summer is nigh the millennium's coming
[50:03] and the Victory and prophecy we know is
[50:05] Israel and the Bible also says that when
[50:07] you the guide told us when you see all
[50:09] the all the world come against Israel
[50:11] it's going to be a cup of trembling you
[50:13] know Jerusalem's going to be a cup of
[50:14] trembling it was going to try and fix
[50:16] this Middle Eastern problem and no one
[50:19] can fix it and everyone's getting sick
[50:21] of the Jews and what they're doing and
[50:22] they just you know there's such
[50:24] anti-Semitism like there's never been
[50:27] but the guide told us it would be here
[50:29] am mean the guide told us there'll be
[50:31] 144,000 elect Jews that receed the same
[50:33] Jesus that you know right now amen and
[50:36] so the guide told us this he didn't say
[50:38] well I think it's going to happen he
[50:39] says I know it's going to happen amen so
[50:42] just like we're facing Christmas we know
[50:43] Jesus wasn't born 25th of December but
[50:46] you know the God said the messiah's
[50:47] going to be born and we'll come to that
[50:50] later and and where the people were told
[50:52] they'd find them they found them exactly
[50:54] there now I'm so thankful where the Lord
[50:57] said he said if you if you love me keep
[50:59] my Commandments and I'll pray the father
[51:01] and he shall give you another comforter
[51:03] that you may abide that he may abide
[51:05] with you forever even the spirit of
[51:07] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[51:08] because it seeth him not uh neither
[51:11] knowth him but ye know him for he
[51:12] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[51:15] I'll not leave you comfortless I will
[51:17] come to you says a promis that will
[51:20] never be comfortless we will never be
[51:22] alone Amen in this world where everyone
[51:24] is so discon connected even though it's
[51:26] such a strange thing where we we are the
[51:28] most connected generation in the history
[51:31] of man but yet mental illness and and
[51:33] depression and things are just on the
[51:35] Rampage and people are so disconnected
[51:37] in this day people feel so alone and So
[51:39] Unworthy but the Lord said I will not
[51:41] leave you alone I will not leave you
[51:44] come the see our guide never leaves us
[51:46] amen he doesn't send us in a way and
[51:48] just leaves us there but he's always
[51:50] with us amen it's so important to
[51:52] realize that your guide if you've really
[51:54] received the Lord Jesus Christ he is
[51:56] your guide and he'll never leave thee
[51:58] nor forsake thee it doesn't matter how
[51:59] you feel you know you can be out in the
[52:01] bush somewhere with the best guide you
[52:03] can feel wet you can feel tired you can
[52:05] feel even disorientated because you
[52:06] don't know where you are but if your
[52:08] gu's with you am mean you can have full
[52:10] confidence that he's going to lead you
[52:12] through what he's brought you to do he's
[52:13] going to take you out amen so he said
[52:16] I'll not leave you comfortless and this
[52:17] com this word comfortless it says to be
[52:20] bered of a father or um um of parent so
[52:23] so so this C says will not leave you
[52:25] without a parent I'll be your father
[52:28] I'll be your mother I'll be your parent
[52:30] I'll be your guide amen or or those bft
[52:32] of a teacher a guide or a guardian or to
[52:34] be orphaned so she says I'll not leave
[52:36] you orphaned amen I'll not leave you
[52:38] without a teacher or a guide because
[52:39] I'll be the these things to you amen if
[52:42] you just let him be your guide be your
[52:43] teacher amen be your guardian Hallelujah
[52:47] we have the best guide amen he doesn't
[52:49] go into elephant territory or lion
[52:50] territory without a gun that can down
[52:52] that thing that you know you know you
[52:54] know when it charges he knows exactly
[52:56] how to down that enemy amen amen so he
[52:58] said he'll not leave us comfortless in
[53:00] this in this age where where everyone is
[53:03] doing their own thing and and people
[53:05] think that you know there's no truth
[53:06] anymore he said I'm the way the truth
[53:08] and the life and me he said that I will
[53:11] show you these things if you call upon
[53:12] me if you seek me with all your heart
[53:14] you shall find me and I have never found
[53:17] someone who has genuinely sought him
[53:19] with all they heart not find him cuz
[53:21] there's a promise in the scripture I
[53:22] mean if it's Quicken to you I can find
[53:24] him you'll find
[53:25] amen I remember when I was at University
[53:28] about 21 years old and thinking you know
[53:30] I knew my what my life was going to be
[53:32] like I was going to be a professor of
[53:33] chemistry and climb the Ivory Tower this
[53:35] was my plan I was guiding myself making
[53:38] home brew in my flat doing all kinds of
[53:40] things but then he came my way and said
[53:43] you need a guide amen you think you know
[53:45] what you're doing but you don't know
[53:46] what you're doing you're just going
[53:47] around in circles thinking you're
[53:48] achieving something but I'm going to
[53:50] take you out of this darkness and bring
[53:52] you to Glorious light I will be your
[53:54] guide see it's not the condition we
[53:56] start in that matters amen this guy
[53:58] doesn't care where you come from what
[54:00] you're into just accept his call and say
[54:02] Yes Lord be my guide amen I'm so
[54:05] thankful he became my guide I've never
[54:07] regretted
[54:08] it amen never regretted it amen for a
[54:12] second because why he is such a good
[54:15] guide amen amen through trouble he
[54:17] guides me amen through confusing times
[54:20] he leads me amen when there's strife and
[54:22] trouble he calms me he comforts me he St
[54:25] izes me why cuz he says it's okay sure
[54:28] we may be amongst a pack of wolves but I
[54:30] know how to deal with the Wolves I know
[54:31] how to deal with these Spirits sure
[54:33] there's all things going on in the world
[54:34] unbelief on every hand but yet I'll lead
[54:36] you through sure there's Darkness amen
[54:39] the world is falling apart but you won't
[54:40] fall apart if you stay with me amen if
[54:43] you walk in my footsteps with me obey my
[54:45] voice you will not fall apart that's the
[54:47] kind of God we have Hallelujah if I
[54:50] start getting happy well I believe in a
[54:52] half out religion amen this is not some
[54:54] Mor of a religion of a you know we don't
[54:56] believe in religion here this is
[54:58] relationship with Jesus Christ the word
[55:01] amen but you see in order to in order to
[55:04] to Really stay with your guide you need
[55:06] the Same Spirit as the guide you know
[55:08] because because if you if you don't take
[55:11] the spirit of your guide you won't have
[55:13] confidence in him because you won't have
[55:15] the same thinking as him you'll start to
[55:17] think differently so when he says no
[55:19] this is okay and it looks like it's
[55:20] everything's about to explode you know
[55:23] then you'll then you'll start losing
[55:24] confidence in your guide because you'll
[55:26] start panicking because your trust is
[55:28] now because you think he doesn't have it
[55:30] all together so then you'll start to try
[55:32] and think now what can I do to save
[55:34] myself but you don't know what to do
[55:36] just like if I was in the bush and we're
[55:37] lost I've got a guide and he's not it's
[55:39] fine we got enough food this is how we
[55:41] survive blah blah blah you know all
[55:43] those things and I start panicking
[55:44] because I don't know what to do if I
[55:45] don't trust him I'll start making a Mad
[55:48] Dash oh it's that way and I'll be ending
[55:50] up going the opposite way that I should
[55:52] be
[55:52] going amen just like brother bramy he
[55:55] said when he was hunting you know he's
[55:56] on Hurricane Mountain and his you know
[55:58] he's actually there on his honeymoon or
[55:59] something with his wife and you know
[56:01] young son and he left them in a lean two
[56:02] up on a by a cabin because the cabin was
[56:04] locked couldn't get in he says I'm just
[56:06] going to go hunting he goes down the
[56:07] mountain you know then a blizzard comes
[56:09] in and then because he's hunting there
[56:11] he needs meat and all these things and
[56:12] then he starts to get worried because he
[56:14] can't see where he's going and then what
[56:16] happens is he's he's panicking because
[56:18] he knows he can look after himself he's
[56:20] a Woodsman he's a guide but his wife
[56:22] doesn't know how to even light a fire in
[56:24] the woods so so if that blizzard you
[56:26] know if he doesn't get back to them
[56:28] they're going to die so then he starts
[56:30] to panic he said you know and he tries
[56:32] all the tricks he knows to see which way
[56:33] North there's all these things that you
[56:35] know when he describes it about the bark
[56:36] on the tree I I have no idea you know I
[56:39] could put my hands in there said no it
[56:40] just feels like bark you know but yeah
[56:41] but you he's telling all these things
[56:43] about how to survive in the woods cuz
[56:45] he's an expert and he starts panicking
[56:48] and he realizes he can't get back he
[56:50] doesn't know how to get back to where
[56:51] that Hut is and then so he prays he says
[56:53] Lord you guide me and then he goes to
[56:55] the best of his knowledge he says I'm
[56:57] going this way and then as he was going
[56:59] that way he felt a hand on his back no
[57:01] one around and he turns around and he
[57:04] looks up and he sees there's actually a
[57:06] hole in the fog and he sees Hurricane
[57:08] Mountain is actually behind him so even
[57:10] with his ability of being a Woodsman his
[57:12] best ability he was going the wrong way
[57:15] and how many times we can lean to our
[57:17] own understanding and think this is the
[57:19] way we should go in life and it's
[57:20] actually the wrong way humanly it may
[57:23] might make sense it may add up and say
[57:25] yes this is the way but how many times
[57:27] it's actually contrary to the word of
[57:29] God and we're going the wrong way and
[57:31] then so he turned around he saw the gap
[57:32] of the fog to Hurricane Mountain where
[57:34] his wife and son were and then he began
[57:36] to try and try and get back up there and
[57:38] he knew that that the season before he
[57:41] had helped the ranger put actually a
[57:43] line a a a telephone line from down the
[57:46] mountain up the top of the mountain and
[57:47] knew if he could just find that wire
[57:50] then he could get to his wife and so he
[57:52] was walking along you blizzard
[57:54] everywhere trying to hold up his hands
[57:56] try and find this telephone wire can you
[57:58] imagine the impossibility you're on a
[58:00] mountain and there's one wire that gets
[58:02] you up to where your loved ones are but
[58:04] then he prayed he cried out to God and
[58:06] he was just walking on he see one hand
[58:08] like this for a bit and one hand like
[58:09] this for a bit then finally his hand
[58:11] touched the wire he was depending upon
[58:14] his guide to get him to the wire that
[58:16] would get him to his wife amen and I'm
[58:18] so thankful that that wire of of of the
[58:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost salvation amen
[58:23] we didn't find that WI that wire found
[58:26] you Hallelujah when I was lost in sin
[58:28] that wire found me see just hold on to
[58:30] this wire actually the wire holds on to
[58:32] you amen doesn't matter how bad life
[58:34] gets blizzards trouble unbelief comes in
[58:37] if you're holding on to that wire hold
[58:39] on to God's unchanging hand it'll lead
[58:41] you to safety amen yes sir Lord
[58:44] hallelujah praise the Lord so we don't
[58:46] want to panic in the
[58:47] woods amen we don't want to panic and
[58:49] Lady OA we want to be trusting Our God
[58:52] Amen now if we have the same Spirit as
[58:54] the guide it doesn't matter what comes
[58:56] in life sure we may get discouraged but
[58:58] we won't be cast down we may be
[59:00] persecuted but not destroyed as as um
[59:02] Stephanie was singing you know we may
[59:04] have all these troubles but yet we won't
[59:06] be down and out amen why because we have
[59:08] the same Spirit as the guide and if we
[59:11] have his Spirit then it doesn't matter
[59:13] what happens we will trust him through
[59:14] the trial amen amen like Caleb Caleb you
[59:17] know the Lord would say is you know they
[59:19] came back from um you know the Caleb and
[59:22] Joshua were part of the 12 Spies that
[59:24] went into the land and the 10 other
[59:26] spies gave an evil
[59:29] report but and then God said to um you
[59:32] know Cale but Caleb and Joshua said no
[59:34] we're more than able to take it why
[59:35] because they're walking with the guide
[59:37] they knew it doesn't matter what's going
[59:39] to come their way what's in their way
[59:40] the God's going to take them through but
[59:43] then but then the 10 spies Israel
[59:45] believed those 10 spies and then so so
[59:49] they said no we're not going to the
[59:50] promised land you just brought us out
[59:51] here to die and and how many times
[59:53] people lose confidence confidence in
[59:55] their guy thinking the GU just set them
[59:56] up to fail God hasn't set us up to fail
[1:00:00] people get angry and bitter at God say
[1:00:01] God you've abandoned me you've left me
[1:00:03] comfortless you don't care about me in
[1:00:05] the trial you've basically brought me
[1:00:06] out here to die if you trust him though
[1:00:10] you can't get better against him amen if
[1:00:12] you trust him if you not don't lean to
[1:00:14] your own understanding then he will see
[1:00:16] you through a amen so the reason Caleb
[1:00:19] could say no we're more than able to
[1:00:21] take the land is because he had another
[1:00:23] spirit with him and that's Spirit was
[1:00:25] the spirit of the guide amen and what
[1:00:27] happened he went and in the season took
[1:00:30] his possession took his Mountain amen
[1:00:32] where the guide said he was going to
[1:00:34] live he ended up Living Praise the Lord
[1:00:37] and you thankful for that see we got to
[1:00:39] have the same Spirit as the guide Amen
[1:00:42] brother says in a guide the guide has
[1:00:44] understanding how to go and what to do
[1:00:47] God has always sent a guide to his
[1:00:48] people God has never failed he sends a
[1:00:50] guide but you've got to accept that
[1:00:52] guide see you've got to believe it
[1:00:53] you've got to go the way way he says if
[1:00:55] you get into a Wilderness and your guide
[1:00:57] says we go this way and yet you think
[1:00:59] you go that way you're going to come up
[1:01:01] lost but then God sends a um sends us a
[1:01:04] guide to guide us we've got to follow
[1:01:05] that guide no matter what we think what
[1:01:07] looks reasonable what looks ridiculous
[1:01:09] we're not subject to divide that the
[1:01:11] guide is the only one amen
[1:01:18] now we got to we got to have the right
[1:01:20] guide that says the right thing the
[1:01:22] Bible says if a trumpet giv an uncertain
[1:01:25] sound who can prepare themselves for war
[1:01:28] so if the trumpet we know back in back
[1:01:30] in those days they would lead units by
[1:01:32] trumpets and drums and different things
[1:01:34] so so the trumpeter had to give a
[1:01:36] certain sound so the soldiers in the
[1:01:37] battle knew what to do for it was charge
[1:01:39] charge hold the line hold the line
[1:01:41] Retreat Retreat it had to be Specific
[1:01:43] Instructions he had to give a certain
[1:01:45] sound now the geese in Canada migrate
[1:01:48] from Canada then then it comes Autumn
[1:01:50] time they go down to Louisiana and then
[1:01:52] when it's and and then and then they go
[1:01:54] go back up to Canada when it's when it's
[1:01:56] the springtime up in Canada they have
[1:01:58] their have their little ones they have
[1:02:00] their goslings and they you know they um
[1:02:02] you know hatched out on the ponds there
[1:02:03] and things and then there'll be you know
[1:02:06] there'll come a season where the geese
[1:02:07] begin to swarm where there's a drake
[1:02:09] will get out on that pond and start
[1:02:11] honking and honking and honking and then
[1:02:13] all of the other geese rally behind that
[1:02:15] one and that and that Drake that's
[1:02:16] leading may have never got off that pond
[1:02:18] in its life but an instinct will guide
[1:02:20] it from there down to down to Louisiana
[1:02:23] to the rice fields when there's a winter
[1:02:25] time on see but the thing is what
[1:02:27] happens is there's there's been a bunch
[1:02:29] of geese that have have have swarmed a
[1:02:31] Drake has been honking and they swarm
[1:02:33] and they ended up in England so instead
[1:02:36] of going down to to to to you know the
[1:02:39] south of the United States they go ac
[1:02:41] across the Atlantic so not South but
[1:02:44] east and they end up in the wrong
[1:02:45] country so so what happened is is is
[1:02:48] that Drake was giving the wrong
[1:02:50] sound he said yes let's swarm but he
[1:02:53] wasn't the right kind of a guide because
[1:02:54] he didn't know where he was going he was
[1:02:57] making all the sounds all the Motions
[1:02:59] but he led them to the wrong destination
[1:03:02] see and then and then and then we're
[1:03:03] told that those geese could not get back
[1:03:05] from where they came from see that's why
[1:03:07] you've got to trust the guide you got to
[1:03:10] know the guide speaks according to the
[1:03:12] word I mean it's not about motions and
[1:03:14] you know excitement and all those things
[1:03:16] is it according to the word or not
[1:03:18] because if it's according to the word
[1:03:19] that's the right Drake to follow that's
[1:03:21] the right guide he will guide you into
[1:03:23] healing he'll guide you into Deliverance
[1:03:25] amen he'll guide you into the baptism of
[1:03:27] the Holy Ghost he'll guide you into the
[1:03:29] Peace of past all understanding he'll
[1:03:30] guide you to the destination that he
[1:03:32] says what he's honking about amen amen
[1:03:35] but if you have the wrong Drake it will
[1:03:38] become a wild goose chase cuz it's a
[1:03:41] wild goose leading the Chase and you'll
[1:03:43] end up in a place you thought well you
[1:03:45] said we're going this way why are we in
[1:03:47] England we're not in Louisiana where's
[1:03:48] the rice patties how do we get back
[1:03:50] he'll just go Hong Kong I don't know
[1:03:51] this is just how it is the days of
[1:03:53] Miracles are passed those things don't
[1:03:55] happen anymore this is just how we're
[1:03:57] going to live and this is just how it is
[1:03:58] that's the wrong
[1:03:59] Goose amen so we we but I'm so thankful
[1:04:03] we have the right kind of a drake amen
[1:04:06] the Holy Ghost is our is our Goose this
[1:04:08] is not a wild goose chase amen amen we
[1:04:10] can have testimony after testimony if we
[1:04:12] had a testimony service we'd say that
[1:04:14] Drake amen led me to peace led me to
[1:04:18] Salvation lead me to Deliverance lead me
[1:04:20] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost lead me
[1:04:23] to a piece of pass all understanding led
[1:04:24] me to Healing led me to every promise
[1:04:26] that he was honking about am he led me
[1:04:29] there Hallelujah I'm so thankful for
[1:04:31] that amen so let's not go I don't
[1:04:33] believe we're on a wild goose chase
[1:04:34] because our guide speaks according to
[1:04:36] the guide book amen If he if he speaks
[1:04:39] anything contrary to the guide book I
[1:04:41] would I I think he's a wild goose I
[1:04:44] wouldn't follow that guy you say have
[1:04:45] fun over in England I'm going to
[1:04:47] Louisiana right I'm going to where I
[1:04:49] meant to be going
[1:04:50] to we got to be sure that the guy that's
[1:04:54] guiding us now I'm talking about
[1:04:55] individually too right not just talking
[1:04:57] about the message or the word I'm
[1:04:58] talking about individually what goose
[1:05:01] are you
[1:05:02] following right we don't want to become
[1:05:04] a goose supper somewhere we want to be
[1:05:06] led where we're LED will dictate if we
[1:05:10] got The Right leader or not so which
[1:05:12] which direction is your life going to is
[1:05:14] it being led into the word of God are
[1:05:16] you becoming more like the Lord I think
[1:05:18] you've got The Right Drake right there
[1:05:21] if you're becoming more like him You've
[1:05:22] Got the Right Drake You've Got the Right
[1:05:23] leader but if you're going opposite to
[1:05:25] the word I think you're on a wild goose
[1:05:27] chase and they just go around in circles
[1:05:29] and they don't go anywhere I wouldn't
[1:05:30] follow that I would get a better a
[1:05:32] better guide than that amen amen see our
[1:05:36] guide will never speak contrary to the
[1:05:37] word of God because he is the word I
[1:05:40] mean now the compass is the Holy Spirit
[1:05:42] and your ti poost will be the North Star
[1:05:44] so the holy spirit will always point you
[1:05:45] towards the word the holy spirit will
[1:05:47] never lead you to anything else but the
[1:05:50] word of God so how could a man accept a
[1:05:52] Creed when it's contrary to the word now
[1:05:54] we know the word creed is basically just
[1:05:56] I believe this that's what a Creed is
[1:05:59] now if your Creed is is is contrary to
[1:06:01] the word I'd get rid of that Creed right
[1:06:03] but if but if you say well I believe
[1:06:05] such and such is it according to the
[1:06:07] scripture amen if it is well then that's
[1:06:09] good if it's not I would I would trade
[1:06:11] that real quick the holy spirit will
[1:06:14] never lead you to anything else but the
[1:06:15] word of God so how could a man accept a
[1:06:17] Creed when it's contrary to the word and
[1:06:19] then still say he has the Holy Ghost the
[1:06:21] Holy Ghost would point you away from
[1:06:23] that it takes the holy Spirit to point
[1:06:24] you to the word for he is the word he is
[1:06:26] the word and it can only the magnet and
[1:06:28] the compass will only sit towards the
[1:06:30] North Pole that's the only way it can
[1:06:31] draw and when the Holy Spirit is the
[1:06:33] author and writer and the quickener of
[1:06:35] the word how can it point the person to
[1:06:37] anything else but the word amen so if he
[1:06:40] is the if he is the Drake that is the
[1:06:42] quickener of the word amen how can he
[1:06:44] point to anything else he can how can he
[1:06:46] say let's go to England instead I've got
[1:06:48] a better idea no God's first idea is the
[1:06:50] right idea
[1:06:52] amen praise the Lord but you see you see
[1:06:55] is when when a guide substitutes
[1:06:57] something like for example we're going
[1:06:59] on a we're going to go on Safari in
[1:07:01] Africa but then our guide takes us to um
[1:07:04] takes us to to to uh Scandinavia
[1:07:07] somewhere you think this guide has
[1:07:09] substitute of where we're going this is
[1:07:11] not the right guide the guide says we're
[1:07:13] going here but we're going here or if he
[1:07:15] says you know he say okay we're going to
[1:07:17] see some elephants they say no no those
[1:07:19] things don't exist anymore but no I've
[1:07:22] met people who have met who've seen
[1:07:24] elephants how can you say but he so he
[1:07:25] substituting something for something
[1:07:28] that's the wrong kind of a guide I mean
[1:07:30] when the original guide said that we're
[1:07:32] been restored back to an Apostolic Faith
[1:07:34] I mean back to a book of Acts Holy Ghost
[1:07:37] experience back to the realities of the
[1:07:39] promises of God but then someone comes
[1:07:40] along and says no the days of Miracles
[1:07:42] has passed those selling tiles haven't
[1:07:44] dropped yet okay just go like this if it
[1:07:47] they do okay and we'll pray for you
[1:07:48] you'll be fine it's just the wind this
[1:07:51] is Wellington so we don't need to worry
[1:07:53] about those things but you see if a if a
[1:07:55] guide comes along and says God don't do
[1:07:57] those things no more that's the wrong
[1:07:59] guide if a guide comes along and says
[1:08:01] well it was in brother Baron's Ministry
[1:08:03] the Miracles the signs the Wonders the
[1:08:05] manifestations of the Holy Ghost but God
[1:08:07] don't do those things anymore that's the
[1:08:08] wrong guide yeah amen cuz the right God
[1:08:11] will say he's the same yesterday today
[1:08:13] and forever and his promises are forever
[1:08:15] true amen it's the same thing with a new
[1:08:17] birth if if a guide says you've just got
[1:08:20] to receive the word intellectually can
[1:08:22] make a confession a statement of faith
[1:08:24] and then you're a Christian you got the
[1:08:25] Holy Ghost that's the wrong guide that's
[1:08:27] the wrong guide amen cuz it's a
[1:08:29] substitution of a handshake or just
[1:08:31] mental exception of a Doctrine to a new
[1:08:35] birth or from a new birth rather see a
[1:08:38] birth is a is an
[1:08:40] experience amen I don't believe there's
[1:08:42] any mother here who's given birth even
[1:08:44] by cesarian that doesn't know they
[1:08:46] haven't given
[1:08:47] birth amen amen amen why cuz they can
[1:08:50] see there's the baby here there's life
[1:08:52] here it was here now it's here
[1:08:54] amen there's a difference in the home
[1:08:55] there's a different life in the home
[1:08:57] amen Something's Happened yeah every
[1:08:59] birth is different but it yet it's a
[1:09:01] birth amen and our guide brings forth
[1:09:04] acts 238 youngans screaming shouting
[1:09:06] snotting boohoo and tongue speaking
[1:09:08] youngans that's that's the way he first
[1:09:10] brought forth birth that's the way he'll
[1:09:13] bring spiritual birth today amen so we
[1:09:15] don't want to swap see it's not a style
[1:09:17] or put on or Declaration of Creeds it's
[1:09:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's
[1:09:21] the secret of the real believing church
[1:09:23] is B again see it brings life I'm just
[1:09:26] reading a bit from the bottom of that
[1:09:27] there see it doesn't matter where the
[1:09:29] birth happens it's a mess but you going
[1:09:31] to be willing to get messy amen amen you
[1:09:33] got to be willing to get messy you can't
[1:09:35] hold it oh we got to keep our composure
[1:09:37] because we're dignified you know you
[1:09:39] think about I wish we had video of of
[1:09:42] the upper room and them acting like
[1:09:44] drunk people I've seen drunk people
[1:09:45] actually I've been drunk on the spirit
[1:09:47] so I know what it's like staggering
[1:09:49] around shouting crying rejoicing wave
[1:09:52] after wave of the Holy Ghost ghost drunk
[1:09:54] as drunk can be but none of the
[1:09:55] perverseness of it amen so you know they
[1:09:59] weren't all like you see photos or
[1:10:00] things of the day of Pentecost and
[1:10:02] they're all like refined saintly and
[1:10:05] Serene they weren't like that they were
[1:10:08] shouting they didn't care they were
[1:10:09] jabbering they were they were stammering
[1:10:12] staggering Hallelujah they didn't care
[1:10:14] what people were thinking that were in a
[1:10:15] great time why because the guide said
[1:10:18] this is prophecy and you're going to
[1:10:19] fulfill the prophecy you go here I'm
[1:10:21] going to fulfill this the GU they
[1:10:23] followed the gu's instructions and they
[1:10:25] received what the guide said would
[1:10:26] happen am praise God and we have that
[1:10:30] same guide guide today amen he's no
[1:10:32] different amen because a guide when he
[1:10:34] comes what he tells you you will find
[1:10:37] you find amen so when the Shepherds were
[1:10:39] there outside Bethlehem the Angels
[1:10:41] appeared to appeared and and the angel
[1:10:44] said that you will find the Savior the
[1:10:47] Messiah of the world has been born in
[1:10:50] your village in your city amen and
[1:10:52] you'll find him wrapped in swaddling
[1:10:54] clothes lying in a Manger amen so they
[1:10:58] so they heard the voice of the Angel
[1:11:00] right they received that word of the
[1:11:02] Angel and where the angel said they
[1:11:04] would find the Messiah they found him
[1:11:07] they didn't find him in a palace they
[1:11:08] didn't find him in a in a house they
[1:11:11] didn't find him where the angel didn't
[1:11:13] say they would find him amen they found
[1:11:15] him exactly in the manger wrapped and
[1:11:17] swallen clothes exactly why because the
[1:11:20] voice of the Angel was a true guide amen
[1:11:23] and because those Shepherds amen because
[1:11:25] they they were willing to be guided
[1:11:27] anywhere they'd be guided you see see
[1:11:30] imagine if this Angel appeared to all
[1:11:31] the fine priests all their fine robes
[1:11:33] and everything and said you'll find your
[1:11:36] messiah in a stinking stable in a Manger
[1:11:39] do you think they'd want to go in there
[1:11:41] they wouldn't be willing to go guided in
[1:11:43] there because the slippers will get mcky
[1:11:45] they may step in in some cow dung or you
[1:11:47] know slip on something in the stench oh
[1:11:49] that's horrible they would never put up
[1:11:51] with that kind of thing they would never
[1:11:52] be willing to be guided to where the
[1:11:54] angel told them the Messiah would be but
[1:11:56] I'm so thankful that we can surrender to
[1:11:58] the guide amen and where he said you'll
[1:12:01] find Messiah you find him Hallelujah
[1:12:03] just like we we've had the seventh angel
[1:12:05] messenger in this day amen God's
[1:12:07] reflected through him as our guide right
[1:12:09] the Holy Ghost through him and he said
[1:12:11] where you find the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:13] Ghost you find it who's had the
[1:12:14] experience amen he didn't he did not
[1:12:17] lead us to anything else he led us into
[1:12:19] the word of God the Simplicity of you
[1:12:21] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:12:23] Christ for the remission of sin you
[1:12:25] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:27] amen and if you follow the instructions
[1:12:29] of that guide you will receive what the
[1:12:30] God said you will receive that's right
[1:12:32] amen so so they found the they found the
[1:12:36] Christ child exactly where the angel
[1:12:38] said praise the Lord if they didn't find
[1:12:41] if that if that uh manger was empty if
[1:12:45] it was anything contrary to what the
[1:12:47] angel said that wasn't a real guide amen
[1:12:50] I know I'm kind of emphasizing this but
[1:12:51] I want you to see we have a real guide
[1:12:53] cuz what he said you'll find he'll guide
[1:12:55] you straight to it and there it is amen
[1:12:59] and there was there was another group
[1:13:00] who were who were looking for a guide
[1:13:02] they had the guide book but they needed
[1:13:04] the guide to come on the scene and show
[1:13:06] them where the Messiah would be because
[1:13:07] they were reading the guide book and the
[1:13:09] guide book said that their star would
[1:13:10] rise out of Jacob that these were the
[1:13:12] wise men that were in the East they were
[1:13:14] studying the stars and all these things
[1:13:16] brother Braham says that they were
[1:13:17] taught all their wisdom by Daniel you
[1:13:19] know their forbears were and then
[1:13:21] finally they saw a different kind of
[1:13:22] star in the heavens and they consulted
[1:13:24] the guide book so it's so important when
[1:13:26] you see things happen in the world
[1:13:28] consult the guide book I mean you know
[1:13:30] this message is more up to date that
[1:13:31] when it was first
[1:13:33] preached it is it is Front Page News
[1:13:36] amen amenl so so they consulted the
[1:13:40] guide book and then so they got on their
[1:13:42] camels and they followed that star
[1:13:44] because they were under expectation this
[1:13:46] is a true guide cuz it's a scriptural
[1:13:48] sign and they followed that they
[1:13:50] followed that sign all the way to the
[1:13:52] promis land but the problem is they only
[1:13:56] consulted one part of the guide book
[1:13:58] because when they ended up when they
[1:14:00] ended up in um when they ended up in
[1:14:03] Israel they didn't go to Bethlehem they
[1:14:05] went to Jerusalem now isn't it amazing I
[1:14:09] mean humanly that would make sense
[1:14:10] because they're going to the center of
[1:14:12] the of the Jewish religion Jerusalem the
[1:14:15] temple was there the high priest was
[1:14:17] there all all those things were there so
[1:14:19] so that makes sense logically right if
[1:14:21] you want to find out anything about the
[1:14:22] guide book and being guided you'd go to
[1:14:25] the authority in the land You' think but
[1:14:27] isn't it amazing that that here they
[1:14:29] come into Jerusalem and said where is he
[1:14:31] born King of the Jews we have seen a
[1:14:33] star in the east and we have come to
[1:14:34] worship him so in other words we've read
[1:14:36] the guide book we've seen the sign of
[1:14:38] the guide in the heavens and he's going
[1:14:39] to lead us to the Messiah on the earth
[1:14:41] we want to worship him we're following
[1:14:43] this guide and then it says and when
[1:14:45] Herod the king heard these things he was
[1:14:48] in Jubilation and all Jerusalem with him
[1:14:50] because the guide was true no he was
[1:14:53] troubled these guys turn up they're
[1:14:56] crying these things they're under
[1:14:57] expectation they're excited we're going
[1:14:59] to see Messiah I mean prophecy is being
[1:15:01] fulfilled in our day I want to be part
[1:15:03] of it I want to see it amen and then
[1:15:04] they come in and everyone's like what
[1:15:06] are these guys talking about they've
[1:15:08] been on their camel too long they've
[1:15:09] turned wrong somewhere and you would
[1:15:11] think that they would the ones they came
[1:15:14] to speak to would know more about it
[1:15:16] than the wise
[1:15:17] men but what happened is is Jerusalem
[1:15:21] forgot the guide they had got so caught
[1:15:24] up in their churchianity and their
[1:15:25] religion they had forgotten the guide
[1:15:28] and so when when people were Guided by
[1:15:30] the guide to them they were troubled
[1:15:32] they weren't rejoicing see we must be
[1:15:35] very careful we don't just get caught up
[1:15:36] in a message religion of a of a of of a
[1:15:40] church way of doing things we've got to
[1:15:41] stick with the word of God Amen we can't
[1:15:44] compare ourselves to each other and say
[1:15:46] well I'm right you're got to compare
[1:15:47] yourself to the word of God Amen you got
[1:15:49] to stick with your guide yes sir amen so
[1:15:52] they were all trouble do you see but
[1:15:54] it's amazing cuz when they when they
[1:15:56] went into Jerusalem there's no record
[1:15:58] that the star they could see the star
[1:16:00] when they went into Jerusalem so these
[1:16:02] ones who didn't know the guide actually
[1:16:04] had an influence that clouded the guide
[1:16:06] from the wise men but then when they
[1:16:09] were told go to Bethlehem and you'll
[1:16:10] find the child it says and when they
[1:16:12] heard the King this is in verse n here
[1:16:14] they departed and lo the star which they
[1:16:17] saw in the East went before them so they
[1:16:19] left these people who had no idea about
[1:16:21] the guide they but yet they following
[1:16:23] the guide book again and then they saw
[1:16:25] the star again that's why it's so
[1:16:27] important don't just take one scripture
[1:16:29] and run off with it take the whole
[1:16:30] revelation of the word I mean take the
[1:16:32] whole guide book amen and then he will
[1:16:35] he will guide you to where he wants you
[1:16:37] to go praise God the Lord see and then
[1:16:41] they you know and then they came then
[1:16:42] they followed the
[1:16:44] star and when they saw the star they
[1:16:46] Rejoice with exceeding great joy why cuz
[1:16:50] that guide LED them straight to the
[1:16:52] Messiah but in their human understanding
[1:16:54] they got they got uh deviated off the
[1:16:57] path of the guide by going to where they
[1:16:59] think they'd get the right advice from
[1:17:02] how careful it is that we don't go on
[1:17:04] the internet ask an AI chatbot for the
[1:17:07] right directions you know or our social
[1:17:10] media or you know but oh but in the
[1:17:12] multitude of counselors there is safety
[1:17:14] you got to be careful those counselors
[1:17:15] no God right you've got to have an
[1:17:17] individual leadership of this guide am
[1:17:20] mean it's not it's it's not public
[1:17:21] opinion that that causes us to believe
[1:17:23] what we believe it's not whatever is
[1:17:25] trending in society and think no we
[1:17:27] stick with the guide book I mean because
[1:17:29] the guide will vindicate the guide book
[1:17:31] amen he will manifest the guide book
[1:17:34] praise the Lord amen
[1:17:37] now praise the Lord aren't you glad he's
[1:17:41] your guide I pray he is amen you see we
[1:17:44] all needed a guide we all need a guide I
[1:17:47] mean Cornelius was an honorable man
[1:17:49] there's there's in Acts I think chapter
[1:17:50] 10 he was a great man honorable man he
[1:17:52] built churches he was devout he prayed
[1:17:54] and you know you he was a gentile that
[1:17:56] became a believer in the Jewish religion
[1:17:58] but then an angel of God came to him and
[1:18:01] said you know your prayers and arms will
[1:18:03] come up before God but now go get Peter
[1:18:06] because he's going to show you the way
[1:18:07] of eternal life see Cornelius needed a
[1:18:09] guide didn't matter how devout he was
[1:18:11] those things were all good but that's
[1:18:13] not going to guide you from this world
[1:18:15] to the next World see see we have a
[1:18:17] guide you think about it our guide has
[1:18:19] been he said I come from God I go back
[1:18:21] to God Amen he knows where we're going
[1:18:23] cuz he's been there he came from there
[1:18:24] he's you know amen so so Cornelius
[1:18:28] needed a
[1:18:29] guide see so God sent him the Holy Ghost
[1:18:32] he sent it in the person of Peter see
[1:18:35] it's so important that we are
[1:18:36] surrendered to the guide because Peter
[1:18:38] was a Jew he would have nothing to do
[1:18:40] with the Gentiles so he was even
[1:18:42] questioning the leadership of the guide
[1:18:45] right God had to deal with them even
[1:18:47] before the men came from Cornelius to
[1:18:49] get him from Jer about you know the
[1:18:51] Sheep came down with all the unclean
[1:18:52] animal like three times and said slay
[1:18:54] and eat Peter and so God had to deal
[1:18:56] with him to get him in condition to be
[1:18:58] led because the season was changing the
[1:19:01] the the kingdom was opening to the
[1:19:02] Gentiles at this
[1:19:04] stage so he sent so so Cornelius needed
[1:19:07] a guide God sent him the Holy Ghost he
[1:19:09] sent it in the person of Peter for while
[1:19:11] Peter yet spake these words the Holy
[1:19:12] Ghost fell on him God used the guide
[1:19:14] through Peter he used it because he
[1:19:16] guided cornelus to the right way and
[1:19:18] while he is yet speaking the Holy Ghost
[1:19:19] fell on them Gentiles then he said can a
[1:19:21] man forbid water that they should not be
[1:19:23] baptized see still the guide speaking
[1:19:26] not Peter because it was a bunch of
[1:19:28] Gentiles unclean dirty to him and he
[1:19:30] didn't even want to go so when Peter was
[1:19:33] preaching it was the god preaching see
[1:19:35] the God wants to put on flesh amen and
[1:19:38] and manifest his word but the guide said
[1:19:41] I'm sending you you do these things that
[1:19:43] you don't think you would do when the
[1:19:44] guide gets complete control when you let
[1:19:47] him guide you oh how wonderful it is to
[1:19:50] be led by the Holy Spirit he is the god
[1:19:53] amen so when we let him get completely
[1:19:55] in control then he can guide us when we
[1:19:57] fully trust him then he can guide us
[1:19:59] when we surrender to him then he can
[1:20:00] guide us all right he spoke through
[1:20:02] Peter and told him what he must do then
[1:20:04] when they had all received the Holy
[1:20:06] Ghost said we can't forb water sing
[1:20:07] these have received the Holy Ghost like
[1:20:09] we did at the beginning and they
[1:20:10] baptized him in the name of the Lord
[1:20:11] Jesus now who led him to do that the
[1:20:14] guide that was in him didn't Jesus tell
[1:20:15] them take no thought of what you're
[1:20:17] going to say because it's not you that's
[1:20:19] speaking it's the father that dwelleth
[1:20:21] in you he doeth the speaking amen amen
[1:20:24] and so God so he has always been the
[1:20:27] Holy Ghost has always been God's guide
[1:20:30] right he's always been God's guide I
[1:20:32] know this is probably very Elementary
[1:20:33] but he's always been God's guide I'm so
[1:20:35] thankful we have the guide I trust you
[1:20:38] have the guide
[1:20:39] today amen you
[1:20:41] see the guide God is obligated to his
[1:20:45] word so the guide is obligated to the
[1:20:47] guide book right if you follow the guide
[1:20:50] in the guide book he will manifest the
[1:20:51] promise of the Bible which is the guide
[1:20:53] book amen says the holy ghost that gave
[1:20:56] the promise and he knows everything
[1:20:59] about it now you look at you look how
[1:21:01] ridiculous it is when when people look
[1:21:03] at people who are being guided they
[1:21:06] think it is ridiculous here is Simon or
[1:21:08] Simeon rather in the temple he's an old
[1:21:10] man and the Holy Ghost reveals to him he
[1:21:13] will not die till he sees the Lord's
[1:21:14] Christ and so he begins to Rejoice why
[1:21:17] because the guide has come to him and
[1:21:19] said this is where I'm going to guide
[1:21:20] you Simeon before you die you going to
[1:21:22] see the Messiah and no doubt he would
[1:21:24] have be to testify this to many people
[1:21:27] but everyone who wasn't Guided by the
[1:21:29] same God guide probably thought he's an
[1:21:31] old silly man he's been he's been
[1:21:33] reading the Bible in the temple too long
[1:21:35] he's just you know had a funny thought
[1:21:36] but it wasn't a funny thought because
[1:21:39] when Mary and Joseph brought the Messiah
[1:21:41] brought Jesus into the temple God told
[1:21:43] Simeon now get up now start walking and
[1:21:46] and in that line of wom where where all
[1:21:47] the babies come to be dedicated the
[1:21:49] guide led him straight to the Messiah
[1:21:52] amen I'm so thankful doesn't matter
[1:21:54] what's going on in life you just stay
[1:21:56] with the guide amen and he'll lead you
[1:21:59] right Amen to where he wants you to go
[1:22:01] and he'll never lead you outside of his
[1:22:04] word
[1:22:07] now what but what happens with the guide
[1:22:10] is
[1:22:11] sometimes we got to wake him
[1:22:13] up here was Jesus with the with the uh
[1:22:17] disciples on the Sea of Galilee he had
[1:22:18] just had a big meeting healing people
[1:22:20] and different things and he was tired
[1:22:23] and he got in the back of the boat and
[1:22:24] that because he said we're going to
[1:22:25] cross to the other side now here they
[1:22:28] were the disciples were were were
[1:22:31] testifying of what the guide had done
[1:22:34] and they were roaring across the sea and
[1:22:35] you know the devil thought well here's
[1:22:37] Jesus he had a low point I'm going to
[1:22:38] drown him all the disciples I'm going to
[1:22:40] I'm going to end this Holy Ghost move
[1:22:41] right now and so he began to get into
[1:22:43] the wind and the waves and the Sea and
[1:22:46] and and and he stirred up all that
[1:22:48] trouble and because the because the
[1:22:51] disciples were expert fishermen they
[1:22:54] thought we can get through this we are
[1:22:56] the guide yeah they weren't the master
[1:22:58] of the wind they weren't the master of
[1:23:00] the wind they they were literally
[1:23:02] probably raised on that sea they knew
[1:23:04] exactly every every facet of it all the
[1:23:06] different things but yet they came to a
[1:23:09] point where they realized they needed
[1:23:10] the god to wake up now Jesus Jesus knew
[1:23:14] what they would face but sometimes Jesus
[1:23:16] puts us through a test to see what our
[1:23:17] reaction is going to be cuz he doesn't
[1:23:19] make us robots so what are we going to
[1:23:21] do in time of trouble are we going to
[1:23:23] waken the guide or are we going to try
[1:23:25] and sort it out ourselves you see when
[1:23:27] the first gust Came Upon the Sea of
[1:23:29] Galilee they they they probably should
[1:23:31] have woken them up but they thought no
[1:23:33] we can handle this we know what we're
[1:23:34] doing see it's when we get to that point
[1:23:37] where we're out of our depth that's when
[1:23:39] God can step in when we think we know
[1:23:41] what we can sort this out we can
[1:23:42] manipulate the situation we talk a
[1:23:44] certain way and you know you talk them
[1:23:46] talk someone round or whatever yeah we
[1:23:48] can deal with the whole thing if we
[1:23:49] think we can do it then the storm's
[1:23:52] going to keep blowing it may be because
[1:23:54] you think about maybe they filled the
[1:23:55] sails in maybe they started rowing a bit
[1:23:57] differently we can manage this storm we
[1:24:00] can manage this crisis in the home we
[1:24:01] can manage this thing at work we can
[1:24:03] because we know what we're doing but
[1:24:06] they should have just awoken the master
[1:24:08] they should have awoken the guide amen
[1:24:10] because because they woke him up saying
[1:24:12] Master don't you care that we perish in
[1:24:14] other words listen you've told us to go
[1:24:16] this way you're our guide don't you care
[1:24:19] aren't you going to look after us in
[1:24:20] this time of trouble why didn't they
[1:24:21] just wake him up earlier this is what
[1:24:23] they should have done they should have
[1:24:25] woken up their guide because remember
[1:24:27] their guide made the sea he he made the
[1:24:29] wind he made he made the atmosphere he
[1:24:32] made this world he made the universe and
[1:24:34] all he did was wake up say peace be
[1:24:36] still and it became a dead calm but they
[1:24:39] had to wake up they had to waken up the
[1:24:41] guide now brother Braham says that if
[1:24:44] Jesus is in your ship and there's
[1:24:46] trouble you've got to wake him up I mean
[1:24:48] you got to call him out of History you
[1:24:49] can't just try and go on in life and say
[1:24:51] well I experienced 20 30 years ago you
[1:24:54] know and just leave him back there and
[1:24:56] I'm just going to walk through life
[1:24:57] because I know the word all these things
[1:24:58] now you need the guide of the word to
[1:25:00] come on the scene you got to awaken him
[1:25:02] brother says in multiple sermons you got
[1:25:04] to he's in our ship but you got to wake
[1:25:07] him up I mean you got to St you got your
[1:25:09] faith has got to call them on the scene
[1:25:11] I mean got to get sometimes but the
[1:25:12] thing is they had to get desperate
[1:25:15] enough to wake him up right if they
[1:25:18] weren't desperate enough they would
[1:25:19] never have woken him up right so you got
[1:25:21] to get desperate enough how much do you
[1:25:22] want to come on the scene see they had
[1:25:24] to swallow their pride see Peter had to
[1:25:27] come to a stage I'm not a Boatman I'm
[1:25:29] not a sailor just like me and Papa in
[1:25:31] your guinea I'm not a sailor I thought I
[1:25:34] was but I'm not one amen and this is
[1:25:37] what we got got to come to in life
[1:25:38] metime going to realize actually I can't
[1:25:40] do this I can't I think I know what I'm
[1:25:42] doing but that's it that's my problem I
[1:25:44] think I know what I'm doing I mean I'm
[1:25:46] leaning to my own understanding amen but
[1:25:48] if you let God come on the scene you got
[1:25:50] to wake him up amen don't let him sleep
[1:25:51] in your
[1:25:53] mean he wants he knew they were going to
[1:25:54] go into a storm he knows what you're
[1:25:56] going to go into or what you're in so
[1:25:58] why don't you just wake him up call them
[1:26:00] on the scene this morning say Lord don't
[1:26:02] you care that I'm going to perish they
[1:26:04] weren't going to drown but they had to
[1:26:07] wake him up see God we have to call him
[1:26:11] on the scene the Lord he doesn't force
[1:26:13] himself upon us we have to be willing
[1:26:16] guide take
[1:26:18] over I'm just a tourist I don't know
[1:26:21] what I'm doing
[1:26:22] take over guide and the sooner we do
[1:26:25] that the better in every situation am
[1:26:29] mean you got trouble in school call on
[1:26:30] the guide you got trouble in your home
[1:26:32] call on the guide wake them up and you
[1:26:34] got trouble on your job call them on the
[1:26:36] scene amen wherever you have trouble
[1:26:38] call them on the scene say Lord I cannot
[1:26:40] fix this I've tried I I I've thought
[1:26:42] about I've strategized on all all kinds
[1:26:44] of things it just blows back in my face
[1:26:46] it just gets worse the gust come it's
[1:26:48] even worse so Lord I need to call you on
[1:26:51] the scene this morning
[1:26:53] and what happened he got them on the
[1:26:54] other side cuz he's the guide there's a
[1:26:58] lot of winds blowing in this world cold
[1:27:02] doctrines Darkness unbelief
[1:27:05] lukewarmness everything's blowing we're
[1:27:08] living in a storm of an
[1:27:10] age but God says we're going to get to
[1:27:12] the other side get to the other side
[1:27:14] there's going to be a resurrection of
[1:27:15] the Dead amen we're going to we're going
[1:27:16] to get to the other side if he's in your
[1:27:18] ship wake him up if he's not in your
[1:27:19] ship invite him into the ship amen let
[1:27:22] him be your guide today amen and you'll
[1:27:24] be able to look back and say just like
[1:27:26] brother B here said he's been my gu
[1:27:28] guide through life he's guided me unto
[1:27:31] life he is the one that led me to life
[1:27:32] and he is my life without him I have no
[1:27:35] life without him I want nothing else
[1:27:37] without him I want nothing else he's my
[1:27:38] all and all in the hours of my trouble
[1:27:40] he stands by me yesterday he blessed me
[1:27:43] today they done the same what can I
[1:27:44] expect the same forever praise His name
[1:27:47] amen yes sir he promised it he'll do it
[1:27:50] he is my life he's my guide my all all
[1:27:52] I've trusted him I've had some hard
[1:27:54] trials I trust him wherever I go I want
[1:27:56] you to do it if you go to wash your
[1:27:59] woman trust him if you go downtown trust
[1:28:01] him wherever you go just trust him trust
[1:28:03] your guide because God wants to walk
[1:28:06] with you more than you want to walk with
[1:28:07] him remember he's been waiting since the
[1:28:10] beginning of time of before and to walk
[1:28:12] with you amen this is this is his whole
[1:28:15] heart desire I want to know my children
[1:28:17] I want to love them I want to reveal
[1:28:19] myself to them I want to display my
[1:28:21] attributes to them I want to make
[1:28:22] memories with them I want to have
[1:28:24] experiences with them that's what I want
[1:28:26] that's what our guide wants our guide
[1:28:28] wants to walk with you more than you
[1:28:30] want the guide amen you know brother
[1:28:32] Brown would would would be in Colorado
[1:28:35] and he's there there's a blizzard comes
[1:28:36] and he tells the other people huning
[1:28:38] with them as soon as the first snowflake
[1:28:39] Falls you get to Camp as quick as you
[1:28:41] can because there'll be just a few
[1:28:43] moments to just be a complete white out
[1:28:45] and then and then the blizzard comes in
[1:28:47] and then he begins his way back down to
[1:28:49] Camp then he hears a voice I'm the
[1:28:50] Creator who made all things
[1:28:52] won't you come walk with me and then and
[1:28:55] then and then brother R turns around and
[1:28:57] walks back up into the storm because he
[1:28:58] knew it was God speaking to him and God
[1:29:00] said to him speak what you will and
[1:29:02] it'll be so and he says he says storm
[1:29:05] you move back we're going to have three
[1:29:06] or four days of I can't remember the
[1:29:08] exact days you know of of perfect
[1:29:10] weather to finish this hunt and he spoke
[1:29:12] that and the blizzard moved back it was
[1:29:14] it beautiful weather for that time and
[1:29:16] they finished their hunt and then when
[1:29:18] that was all done he say I picked up my
[1:29:20] gun wiped off the scope started walk
[1:29:22] back down the hill and something said to
[1:29:23] me why don't you stroll with me through
[1:29:25] this wilderness walk with me see God
[1:29:27] didn't just want to display his power
[1:29:29] and show the power of the spoken word
[1:29:31] God was calling his Prophet to walk with
[1:29:32] him and that's what God is calling you
[1:29:34] to do won't you walk through this
[1:29:36] Wilderness of This World With Me am mean
[1:29:38] won't you take a stroll with me that's
[1:29:41] what the guide wants that's what he's
[1:29:43] that's all he's interested in he wants
[1:29:44] to walk with you amen he says yes Lord
[1:29:48] with all my heart it would be one of the
[1:29:49] greatest things I could do was walk with
[1:29:51] you so I put my gun over my shoulder I
[1:29:53] started walking down through that never

[1:31:33] guide It's a subconscious thing it's not
[1:31:35] a conscious yes Lord I believe yeah all
[1:31:37] that's good but it's down in here amen
[1:31:39] when trouble strikes and you really
[1:31:40] believe him that's when it really shows
[1:31:43] amen I've learned that in the years of
[1:31:44] travel around the world meeting the
[1:31:46] peoples of all different walks by faith
[1:31:48] but faith is unconscious you've got
[1:31:50] faith you don't know that's right Jesus
[1:31:51] Christ no matter if he was in a storm
[1:31:53] and the g was knocking the boat from one
[1:31:55] side to the other was he standing in a
[1:31:56] face of mess of demons if he was hanging
[1:31:58] anywhere it never moved him he walked
[1:32:00] right on just as calm as quiet as could
[1:32:02] be why he was simply unconscious of fear
[1:32:05] or anything around him that's right
[1:32:06] whatever it was going to happen whether
[1:32:08] it wasn't going to happen he knowed it
[1:32:10] was going to happen because God said so
[1:32:12] he didn't he didn't say oh have I prayed
[1:32:15] through wonder if I fasted long enough
[1:32:17] wonder if I did this he just walked
[1:32:19] right on unconscious that's right he
[1:32:21] believed what God said was the truth the
[1:32:23] word must be fulfilled and he know what
[1:32:25] his life was to fulfill them that's
[1:32:27] right and you're here to fulfill it too
[1:32:30] just walk unconscious of fear walk with
[1:32:32] your guide walk unconscious of criticism
[1:32:36] walk unconscious unto the world walk as
[1:32:38] you walk with Christ walk with him not
