Men of God Men of Valor men of God Saints they fell upon their faces they could not look at you they couldn't stand in your presence because Lord you are a fearful God but father tonight you you allowed us Lord Jesus to come in your presence Lord take us through this service Lord anoint your people anoint your weight Lord and when the speaker I'm nothing Lord Jesus I'm not worthy even to

today we just want to acknowledge the Lord for you brother Matt and we say allow us to speak about you please that the Lord can bless you it's our prayer we love you and appreciate you and the Lord we may we may fail sometimes to see what you are doing for the people of God but the Lord the Bible says Islam but not you know he's the one that watches over Israel he does not slumber nor sleep so he's watching you and he's noting you know he's noting all those things that you're doing from your heart for the people of God so happy birthday my brother I trust sister Priscilla did her best today and until 12 o'clock midnight you know she'll still be cooking more cake for you baking and providing you amen as the Lord willeth amen and we welcome our precious Brother Andy he's an African laughs and we welcome brother Ben as well hopefully or probably maybe streaming or sleeping and resting God bless you Brothers for what you have done and we are proud of you the Lord Jesus is very proud of you for what you are doing for the kingdom of God and you know using these physical bodies to spread the gospel you know to go and look for that that Last Ship and bring it home amen so as without any waste of time um I would like us to speak tonight if you can just go to the title Talia where's that little Gadget you know is it available and I can use it to to manage my nervousness and we want to talk about this subject that the Lord put on my heart I Was preparing a salmon and I I was finished thank you so much brother and then I was finished and then just as I finish I I deleted it by mistake and and there everything disappeared I didn't even tell my wife I just said Lord help me and I said Lord probably you didn't want it the way I put it so probably the Lord wanted it the way he wanted to put me under pressure and I let him select what he wants to select for his people amen so um that if you hear me stammering and going that way and not being organized a little bit just know that I deleted my my sermon by mistake and I searched everywhere you know you know the feeling every day you know that feeling when you see just after pressing and his ark is gone so that what happened to me but I want us to read about I mean to talk about this thought you know many of you will know the meaning of the way I wrote Nazarite the the spelling I made it wrong on purpose it's supposed to be NZ Nazi but I put n a z a because that's how the prophet said it said NASA right so I thought I can put it that way but when we read in the Book of Genesis we hear about we know the story all of us we know the story about Abraham and Lord separating we know the story about Abraham and Lord going separate ways and the choices of Lord and the choice you look at the attitude of Lord and the attitude of Abraham Abraham says to him hey look if you choose the left I'll go to the right if you choose the right I'll go to the left ah isn't that a wonderful thing for a brother to say that to you brother if you take this one I'll take this one if you take this I'll take this choice is yours he gave Lord a choice and Lord made a choice Abraham's Choice was take this I'll take that or take this out anyway I'm fine but what is amazing about this scripture as you read it at the end the Lord after they've now separated the Lord says to Abraham hey look to the north the East the South and the West everything that you see I'll give it to you the question is what happened now to to Lord's portion that's the question because Lord obviously Lord went either to the left or right as the Bible says but God says everything around all directions I'm gonna give it to you not only you even your seed as brother John was preaching there at the camp even in your family look to the left and right because Abraham separated himself and he did not have a wrong attitude he said if you take the left I take that's how God rewards you when you give everything to him and say Lord choose for me amen look at that attitude but let's move forward I want us to talk about this Nazarite because Abraham is is is that seat of the Nazarite let's look at him let's go to judges Judges chapter 13. I hope this time I won't read a wrong scripture judges 13. and then we'll start if I'm not mistaken from verse one but I would like us to focus on a specific verses 31 . now as you all know in the Bible there was a time when the children of Israel did not have Kings they did not have any specific men leading them they had judges that would rule them and guide them and judge matters for them you know you know of Deborah you know of Samson you know of many many of them right so this was during the time round about when Samson was going to be born amen the Bible says and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistine 40 years I'm 46. that means since I was born minus six years I don't know how many of you here are fought but for 40 years they were delivered in the hands of the of the Philistines children were born knowing that we served the Philistines because of just doing evil before God what happens to us to ask you evil before the Lord today We Are Spiritual Israel right are we spiritual Israel so verse 2. and there was a certain man of Zora the family of the Denis whose name was Manoa and his wife was Barren and Bernard and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Baron in Barris note bear is not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son God always appeared to his people even if they are in a Philistine control God will appear there's always a sense a sense and a threat of Hope with the Lord amen you will never lose it all with the Lord now now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine no strong drink and eat not any unclean thing I ask myself I say my what are the spiritual what's the spiritual meaning of this verse this woman is going to be to Bear a son and the angel is telling her don't drink and don't touch and clean things but it's not hair who's going to lead and and deliver Israel it's the Hassan but God says no you don't do that so today me and you right we are bearing children right today me and you we we we we've got the word of God conceived in US filled yes right are we together are you following the spiritual point that I'm trying to put across today me and you we've got we've got a baby right we are conceived with the Holy Spirit here right and we we we we we are supposed to not touch wine of the devil huh and clean things we are not supposed to touch them to be a Nazarite to become a netherite of God we are supposed to be separated not touch anything I'm trying to be here not on the on the negative one not on the physical I'm trying to be on that let me not say here I'm trying to be on a spiritual level think spiritually don't think physical when I say wine because we drink wine here at church think spiritual you're not supposed to be touching I'm not supposed to be touching that because I'm a Nazareth the mother of the Nazarite God already tells her don't touch this don't touch this can you see it that has got implications to me and you who have got a a very important person the person of Jesus Christ in US what that means is that I don't know what measurement can I give you but from tall to her from all across the three spheres of your body are we together let's let's continue with it let's just calm down and relax and enjoy reading the word of God right for law that's five for Lord Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the philistine this boy is going to be another right from the womb of the mother amen I want I want to jump to um okay I wanna leave it there amen so nothing must be done on his head the matter must not even drink wine the mother must not touch any unclean thing because this boy is going to be another right so you want to look at this Nazarite and and understand the meaning of being a Nazarite because you must understand brothers and sisters that before God could call us okay let's just look at what a real and a Nazarite could be meaning according to Dr Google and all who can explain in the historical you know background in the Jewish religion you know the Bible it says that another right is in Hebrew meaning Naza right to abstain from to to to to to to to be away from something right and to and also to concentrate oneself to concentrate to concentrate means to give over you know to to all of you you know to pour yourself all of your being to give it to God right to consecrate to to all your life everything about you is about your Nazarite vow your Nazarite identity that's what that boy was going to be and among the ancient Hebrews um a sacred person whose separation was most commonly distinguished by his how was that uncut hey right and cut hair and uh sorry I can't see properly there I should have made them bigger because now abstinence from wine and from all the other things so there is a sign for a Nazarite in those days they will see a person with long hair and cut hair and cut hair a person who does not go where it mixed with the way the corpses are you know the dead people a person who does not drink there were some signs and there was some outward signs that will show that this man is a narrower is a Netherland and to be to be able to say to be of God service that was the purpose the purpose was because that person had a gift of God and that's the right will have a gift of God given from birth from before you were born you had the angel talking about the Nazareth and that person would would be coming not only uh something to be a Nazarite was to to be a deliverer a leader a warrior for your people you'll have a gift there will be different kinds of of gifts obviously I will believe I would imagine but a Nazarite will have specific things that we will know that this man is ah this one is saying that's all right hair was predominantly the one the way you live the gift that you have the way you are not you know because you are a Nazarite so you are a never right today because you are born with a gift you will see now do you believe you're born with a gift how many don't believe that they've got a gift do you believe you've got a gift I thought I thought I'll hear amen amen you have a gift let me put it a little bit chilly whether you believe it or not you have a gift God has given you a gift and you are a chosen child today when this world could not bear bright God came and said hey you are going to bring a bride let me not go ahead of myself right I want to show you something here few will will take that little girl on top you know for dinner and then he just come for dinner two hours and just go straight to the table with those hands tell me how many of you how many of you will that man come in the house and then you just give them a room and let them not even a shall just go and sleep and then there's a room huh how many of you when you come across that kind of a person you you and it comes to your house or comes inside your car or next to you without touching you you you you want to move it you want to say Sir can we help you right look at those hands if I come and you are calling me for dinner to eat I come with hands like this and I go straight to the plate what are you going to say to me what are you going to say you're gonna say brother that day Becca will call me uncle yeah that that the uncle no no no no no come let me show you the bathroom huh but let me tell you something that is you that is you before that is your picture I wanted a picture that will be as disgusting as possible but I couldn't find it me and you are disgusting saved by grace the problem is this many times we accept it on face value you know a face body's face value sister Esther face value is shallow we accept that ah yes I'm a sinner Say by Grace Lord thank you for saving me but not deeply acknowledging inside our hearts because that is the point of turning that is the point of repentance that is the point of receiving your blessing the point of realizing who you are is actually at when you are realizing oh Lord that Me Lord I'm ashamed of myself Lord had it not been for you I would have remained like this dirty stinking wretched and good for nothing that's me good for nothing and the sooner I realized that because it's one thing to tell ourselves that oh we are the Bride of God we are the Bride of God and we are his Chosen One that's wonderful but it's not just coming just because I say it or you say it there must be that acknowledgment that nah in my language me means na Brother Andy will tell you not me I'm like that before God saved me you know we always see people going to um you know on weight programs and they show you before and after you know that kind of a thing he'll actually knew before and after brother they like to say uh you know they all they want you to focus on the after but that's the important part but this part is important it is not important it's important not because we want to praise the devil not because we are proud but because one forever knowledge and thank God changing us from who we are for for what a mercy what a Grace that God clean pure holy God will come stoop so low to a stinking thing like me like that and come and save me let's not play Holy Holy we were like that West some of us West I was worse worse than that horrible but I'm not proud I don't want to talk and think about it and one day the devil always sometimes bring it but you see the key is this when we realize that you are like that the key is not to put your focus on there the kids to put your focus on here you see because that if you realize how you are and you realize who you are now man you explode you you you realize that I was like this because the Bible says and he tells us and the change has come completely 360 Degrees like we were now opposite from like the East is from the East and the West will never meet they will never come across you know mountains they say mountains they even meet with their Shadows but the East and the West will never meet that's how God changed you you were like this and he changed you you're like this you are so dirty and so stinky and I know you are so smelling good that's what God did in your life if you focus only on what he did and how you are as I was listening to Brother Andy saying many people who want to focus on the god of yesterday and the what he will do tomorrow not what he's doing now if you acknowledge all those what you are what you wear it will be better and very easy for you to acknowledge the now the after because you know where I'm coming from but if you put a slight doubt of saying I was not so bad ha ha your pride will come in your attitude won't be right everything about what you are going talking you might even acknowledge the clean part after with pride thinking that you deserve it can you see how important it is it's very important to understand that I am filthy but Hallelujah by his grace I am clean that is why it's so important all the time when we speak the Lord is willing our husband must be involved in every thought that goes through our minds because it's him after all it we owe it all to him therefore how does this relate to another right because another ride is someone who is separated is someone who does not mix so I just wanted to pass this thought through with you that hey there is a before and there is an after and they are all equally important of course the important thing is the present tense where I'm going what I am now what what what I was is only a a process of bringing me to my real me but I'm so thankful because what I was I'm no more and the things that I used to do I do them no more because if the full acknowledgment of of this helps you to actually take this with humbleness to take this with so so so what is the word brother ending sobriety yeah is that the right word with with sobriety that's the way the sobriety thank you so much brother Andy Brother Andy brother because he's got the right ways sobriety you know all humbleness all all meekness you don't you want to say no no we we will be so happy and so thankful knowing who we were are we together sometimes it's not easy to accept this because you know there's still some element of this and we talk to you we ask you we look at you we are happy with you but you don't seem to be happy for these Clean Hands you you are happy but yeah yeah what's wrong with you do you still have a bit do you still need some more some more javela you know javel bleach you still need some more bleach and a full full cycle he our outside must show that you are another right you are a clean cleaned person by the blood bleaching blood of our Lord Jesus Christ that we are now a clean person and that is owed all to the Lord Jesus now let us let's just talk about total separation the pastor I don't know if any of you have managed to listen to that same one how many of you have listened to that one total separation now let's take that thought eh let's take the thought of Leaning learning how to separate from unbelief because it is that separation that actually brings us to the full manifestation of this right now God had one way of bringing light to you that's when you are ready to separate that's the only way that's the only way when God is going to shine on you and bring his light upon you and you become a moving light only when you are ready to separate until then full manifestation of the light of God may not be able to be on you and indwell in you fully because you are not able to you are not willing to to separate sorry I have to stand here a bit just to be close to you as well and I can also see now you you you you think you think of the holy spirit is separator the holy spirit is a cutter it's a separator there's a scripture that says how can you save God and Mormon at the same time I'm not saying you do brothers and sisters what I'm trying to do they're ineffective when they produce when they make these things back say say this thing is called a what a stent a mic stand ineffective when they make it profess my girl it's a process of making taking every part of this perfect and that process they make it and they produce it some will make the rubber some will make this bold some will make this and everything and the inside of it and the painting when it gets to the end of the production line at the end where they say now it's ready to be packaged there's a guy called your quality Ashura he that guy is doing a quality assurance I've got a little machine maybe or inside a little room where it's got a light red green test it and they test it and they check it and they do quality assurance the moment the red the light goes green that is good he puts a sticker party pass T pass now the moment it goes red not ready they check oh the fold is there they didn't paint it red one side it does not go with those ones are we together and that's the process which me and you are now God is doing the final checking up the final checking up it means we are just at the end of the end so if we just be alert and know that we are now at the process where we are moving out now but then he can tell you they just came now I'm sure when they check in there in South Africa in taking into the Customs there you know a night before maybe they checked their bags and everything is right and they get to the airport they still check the board what is allowed there was not allowed what's the kilogram and then maybe they take their kilogram both of them they'll combine it it is 20 kilograms 20 per person then they check that Opera the business code 14 then I can take 20 I can take more you know you balance it off the weight and everything your quality because once you go in there there's no more checking no no there's no more checking excuse me the first question they ask you is this your big set did you pick it yourself yeah you say yes you know everything that is inside here yes are you sure said yes okay then they open then they find a big bag of coffee 20 kilogram sir is this your coffee yes okay please just stand there then they open from that time then they're going to check everything about you they'll take you in their ears they'll check you everywhere this is quality assurance their quality because every product that goes through there must be checked quality perfect heaven is a clean clean place and therefore me and you cannot afford to have these little things that are called the man of God calls them loose ends we have got no sins among us nothing we look good and we don't deliberately go and do a sin and say I'm gonna sing today then I'll go to church tomorrow they'll pray for me no no we don't do that the devil is so subtle he said to Eve you know he says hi sister no it's all right he says to you he wants surely not surely that's how he comes and attack us today he doesn't come and say smoke here no no no go and sweat that person today to a Believer to ask he come in a certain way because the first Eve failed now we are the second if and this if it's not going to fail what I'm alerting you is what he's trying to do he's repeating himself just like he did to the first Eve he'll bring things that you are not aware things that are easily ignorable brother negligible we say things that are so easy things that you kiss ah no no no no no no that's that's okay that's just my that's just a baby yeah no no no no no no no that's just a little boy that's just a small child knowing very well that he has is a small child I agree but he wants to plant something to bring in the back door in my house that's just a young boy the a young boy but how come Manoa and his wife the Bible the angel said hey even before they were born don't drink wine how come how come John the Baptist how come he got the Holy Spirit even before he was born ah I said to my kids hey I am your Holy Spirit if you haven't got it until you get yours so listen to me I'm your Holy Spirit until you get your Holy Spirit right so listen to me because I've got I've got the holy spirit so listen to me you won't go wrong and it mustn't be to read the seven Church ages you go and take that book it's so lovely even you read it and it's so lovely but when it comes to loudishia if the prophet says the city of laodicia has certain characteristics had certain certain you know features it was a city of freedom it was a city of high economic success of prosperity it was even called a Metro Police a metro police in those days it was a prosperous City it was a city where the all the other cities gathered to come and do rituals every year it was a successful City but women were very read that the people were free whenever it was a city of leave us alone leave me alone huh did you know that it is Iniquity for you to see your brother doing something wrong and not tell him because you you actually become part of that wrongness God will count it on you if you see me doing something wrong or see Becca and not tell her and not say the key is to do it with the right spirit that's the key but not to do it seeing that Becca is going in the fire and I'm going the reptile my daughter's going there and I don't tell her God is gonna count it against you that is why it's not nice to be corrected that is why it's not nice it's not nice the prophets say we cannot see Billy the train is coming there and Billy's playing on the railroad you say hey Billy boy boy get out of the railroad Billy boy yeah be careful as any boy I told you before the train is coming fast what do you say and you snatch him out I'm not saying be angry to your children I'm simply saying particularly the First World countries that have observed there is too much we are in need of nothing spirit and that enables this it sort of hampers the spirit of God to move freely to correct and to chastise you find that you cannot touch a child if I touch Jonah or even mama and lady will not know the police first 9-1-1 what is it triple one instead of Jonah say no no no Uncle come here man come let's go why why why are you giving me a backsla why I love you Jonah it's because Uncle Paul loves you come let's talk it over I'm so sorry that I've hurt you but you know my boy you see the spirit I'm coming with you see that's the spirit but just to to let the things go in the name of what the government says don't touch the children whose children are they is God going to ask a the government about Ruben and Liam is God going to ask the government and say government tell me now what happened is not going to ask God is not God is going to ask importance happy and say hey accepted it he can say that because I didn't teach him well I didn't tell him when I saw him do something wrong rather be in the bad books of your brother but you have told him the truth in the right Spirit let's notify our way as we finish this year let's jump into the new year ready to cut those loose ends to cut those small things that so easily beset us that come unaware this is the secret of how you're going to see that there are some loose and somewhere here what is his name there's some loose ends let me give you a tip this is the way to see it the moment you find out you are not reading the weight as you're supposed to the moment you realize that your love your affection your excitement you are still for God is reducing you know yourself the moment you find out the way you read the word of God and he actually consumed not just to read it for the sake of reading it reading it to eat to consume it the moment you find out you are too busy for God huh it's tattoo bring a scissor the big one check check those loose ends oh you'll find them hiding and you can't then a bubble of Holy Ghost filled excitement just move after cutting that loose end then you go and say ah why am I'm this side I'm walking straight away I'm sick then you check check yourself the Bible says let's check ourselves using this Bible with the weight and check ourselves it is better for us to be chastised and reprimanded now than to miss the rapture because of one small little loose end then to miss the meeting I was thinking yesterday I felt so happy man I said I I felt so I wanted to jump because I was thinking about the day that morning when when we go home when we change brothers and sisters that morning when we go when when it's over and finish do you ever take time just to think about that just to think about what's going to happen the day they say it's over you know I'll throw my laptop very far foreign [Music] probably I won't have time for such things I'll just go I'll probably just kick it one more time [Music] because brother and sister let me tell you this many times the devil brings this membrane of covering you know what we are supposed to be exploding into you know exploding into that excitement the Zeal of actually realizing that there's top priority and everything else comes second the devil covers it particularly on the young people I know that because I was a young person he's got an ability on a young person to make you feel that you can do anything and you're able and you need nobody because of course you are strong you are clever you are sharp man but he doesn't tell you that hey man you only have one underwear one and your father bought you and you've got two maybe vests and you've got one or three pair of shoes who you didn't buy your dad bought them for you Daniel hey that you are dead bought them for you but the devil doesn't the devil says you are of course you are a young lion but David said kingdom of God while you are in that age why you are so strong because hey all of us are coming to your age when we change that morning I'm gonna be just like Kira taller maybe than him you see now he's taller than me and he said Dad come I wanna I wanna talk to you you just stand next to me I said what he says no no that's all this guy don't do that so but now there's gonna come a time when our going to change imagine we are all all the same age imagine imagine we are changing that morning you're gonna cry a cry that we have never cried before that morning you're going to realize that so what are all these things among us that disturbs us the small little things that we are not even supposed to worry about sisters no nowadays were even becoming like sisters oh Jesus help us Lord ah help us Lord we are supposed when we think of our going amen forgiveness comes like a Mighty rushing wind to my brother covers him up before he even asks me I just love him that's that love to be bred both sides I told you the story you forgot you you you love and forgive your brother so much so that no devil is going to DARE come to you to say ah that sister never you won't take a chance because the amount of you've cut all the loose ends are activated further away from what I wanted to talk about but anyway now do you ever see people like that he's talking about Ahab was a make-believer aha was an unbeliever you know he he just do right they they feel like they just make better social person when they go to church they just want to have their social life and maybe you know for the sake of the children they will just go to church you know we just say a social group this is not a social group we are not in a social group it's important for us to be correctable if you are correctable if corrects me and I'm correctable I stand much a better chance to listen to God if your brother corrects you the one that you can see and talk to him and negotiate and he said no I didn't mean to him and Brother Andy please come home my friend the one you can talk to if you can listen to him correcting you how are you going to listen to God so I'll go to the next slide oh yeah sorry I can't jump this one let's go to the middle there you see in the middle Alice let's go from beginning it's a total separation we are not we are not to go back into the world no more and have anything to do with the world but live only unto God Jesus is coming after the bride a bride a woman a church that is separated from the things of the world things of the world and their appearance the Bible says in Thessalonians I can't remember first Thessalonians it says run away from the very appearance of sin let alone sin appearance only stand away from it what's up what's after your brother what's up to your sister they wash him over you just appearance say hey my friend first pray for them and from your heart cry for them and go talk to them if you see anything wrong as we move into 2023 let it be our team that will be that wife that he's coming for she's separated from the cares of the traditions of the church not tradition must bind us we have been so much in the traditions in the message Traditions I was talking to my wife the other day and we were talking about music you know when we grew up if you play those brothers that you were with those Elders when we grew up just to play a gospel song you that's needed sorry I almost hit so those are the Traditions all of us came with them and the Bible says when they came out of Egypt the mixed malt issues came with them when we kept the message mixed small tissues of spirits came with us and then we see as long as we go along we kill them but brother Ben said you know as Men of Valor just killed him because we are made to kill Giants we are made please to devour Giants you know to devour it's not just to chew you devour it so that's what we are made to do so let us be aware that as we go along you can find a great man of Valor who destroyed Giants but his body is working like this huh straight spinal caught everything straight because he's a great man of Valor no Loose Ends no disabling from the air from the enemy disabling of any part of your body spiritual body by the devil and it is my job my job your job to take it that ah I don't I give priority to my man the Lord Jesus Christ every day of my life because in the yellow part he is separated from the Fashions of them of this Modern Age that will that we will live in she's separated from the case or and the traditions of the churches now does her identification that's her NASA right identification to be separated to be completely and checked snipping anything that along the way you know is this Christmas does not wrong to come to a point and with the children say hey guys come let's sit down this man how did we do tell me how let's take stock of each each other yeah not only start to talk when there's a problem [Laughter] so may God help us let's finish up with this I think I think my time unless somebody says to me go on amen let's read there and see hear what the prophet says in the book of um God's word calls for total separation I believe tonight that every man and woman every boy or girl that's born of the spirit of God is another right are you another right another right is someone who is separated and that's what we are whether the devil takes it or not let him swallow it that's what we are and you are going to be another right whether the devil likes it or not why did the Lord Jesus Christ said to Peter get thee behind me Satan I always I'm always intrigued by this statement why did the Lord say it that way that was too harsh isn't it in the physical way of seeing things it was too high sister in us to say you know I come to you let's say I come to my sister say oh God bless you my sister God bless you oh sister no no don't do it this way dude get thee behind me Satan oh my God huh just imagine how I feel ah I wanted you to go towards the Cuban hey you know I said you'll get me in the car I wonder if that imagine if someone do that to you but why did the Lord do that to him I watched the patient The Passion of the Christ the other day man that is it Gibson okay they made it so so so really it's painfully and when I think that actually he was naked the Lord Jesus Christ you know in some books historical books he says you know even the prophet I think said it he said they beat him that you could see the riffs the bones that's how they beat him and they beat him but yet the same man when when when Peter cut the ear he reprimanded Peter must have thought this man is not okay he picks up that ear and then he plugs it back and he reprimand him huh so I want to say to you brother and sister we are from a higher Kingdom en and a higher kingdom is even an understatement if we can only realize who we are right now I'm telling you I'm telling you we we we will change we will change we will go home we will ignite everyone around us and our near churches and everyone who will ignite them just one light of match just by realizing his full potential and lighten up I'm telling you something that we have never seen will happen you will bring the Rapture closer here we just realize Who We Are and make accept who we were and accept who we are I'm telling you by removing those loose ends listen to that Jesus has constantly told us that there is a separation and we find that the last thing that that's predicted to the human race before the great final day when we Ascend into the presence of God there is a final separation not one the standard separation when I'm finally separated because because of Separation you know in the beginning he said let there be light and then it was light why because before light it was inside Darkness mixed up together and the god separated cut it in the very beginning and Adam God made him and gave him him and then from there Satan come in and what did God do separate them out of the garden he's the god of separation and he said to them I'm coming again to bring the one who's going to bring you where you were brother Ben was talking about it how many listens to those those clips man I I wish they gave us a full same one because there was there's a plan here there's a plan and that plan is for you and for me don't underestimate yourself you are a big man you are a big woman today you you are a big the prime ministers of this world don't know who they're dealing with that's you and the sooner you see that you are those hence Clean Hands and look where you coming from man nothing is going to stop you he will still come in time when you're going to ship is going to be separated from but the only credential that a Believer has in the word of God is living in him declaring Jesus Christ lives in that person that's the separated Nazarite unto the Lord separated for the word sake that is why when they call you a stupid when they call you ugly when they call you like the long dresses when they call you funny and all sorts of things you must be very happy you must be very excited and see yes you have finally saw who I am I'm an oddball very happy at work I just purposefully pray for the food purposefully I just I when they're talking talking and I want to eat I just and I pray because they're looking then I pray heavenly father thank you for your food today bless my colleagues here then they must ask me who's this God that you are praying then it's a chance for me to tell them maybe there's a Nazarite somewhere among them there for me to find him Jesus has constantly told us okay I've read that one for you it's a final separation that is coming which is the final Rapture that is going to take us home that reptile is the reality is the truth it's called it's not like the news of BBC no no it's a real live news of what's going to happen it's going to take place one day and that time when it happens when it happens make sure that it takes you make very sure be very sure because that time there is no more turning back every witch every bad person the time will be done they can do what they want now The Killers can kill the wishes can be weak whoever those who don't want to pray the Bible says continue and not pray continue let those that are good continue to be good and you do your best and continue to be good before the Lord and saving lastly I think I must jump this one oh yeah then this is the last one then because my conclusion is empty it was because of that accident now let's just read this one because we've got just a few minutes let's just enjoy maybe I said dessert the question is to the people today does does he really mean it what brother and Paul is saying does it mean that there's going to be one day a change of bodies brother and says I mean it let me rather die today Lord if you know tomorrow I'm going to backslide take me today that's how hard it is that how real it is like just Lord take me if tomorrow I'm not going to save you the way I'd rather go home does he really mean it and when you accept what the church says do does he really mean it you see what happens when you ask such kind of statements then you put yourself in some condition that Adam did because Adam purposely went with Eve and said ah you know enjoying yourself into the the woman of the Church of this world and separate yourself from the blessing of God that has promised in other ways if you don't see parade yourself from the things of the world you are actually separating yourself from God does it make sense now blessing that God has promised to every believer that will separate himself from the world to the wage now that's the truth separate yourself I separate myself because we are Nazarite and if we don't we are separating ourselves from God how said that when you are already in when you are already in when all you need to do is just a few little remaining sacrifices and we go home just to listen to my men dead everything they say then you might eat how beautiful that is there maybe the Rapture will come even before you 10 18. who knows maybe it'll come and then we go then voila you are a tall girl isn't that a lovely thing we say it so nicely and so so light but that's the truth that's the truth like when I say these brothers are from South Africa it's the truth more than that so I would like us to think about this message and maybe go read it as the pastor send it you will find things in there that are quite challenging that you know where the Prophet you know I don't know if it's this message or another one where the Prophet said hey this loose ends up the devil has realized that there's nothing he can do on us the strategy his strategy is just a delaying tactics his strategy is the Loose Ends the things that you know you you do this but actually there's nothing yeah you know he just you just feel like screen oh if you just leave it sometimes I get itchy and I say I'm not going to scratch myself and after after a few seconds I don't feel easy because that's how the devil Works he wants to distract your attention he wants to bring a loose ends while you are looking the scripture thinking that no then you just start swelling you believe it that's how the devil Works young children wake up wake up and take the word of God seriously right know that his brother Ben said there's a part of you physically that is not fully grown so the elders listen to them and then you held us let's not just make it a talk for them let us make it a living a life it's better to ask for us to live it than to say it that's the best way because children learn by observing young people learn by watching they just watch you beating your wife then they get married they beat their wives they learn well that's them how a human being is made they just watch you shouting and being upset for no reason tomorrow morning is still upset ah the Bible said Don't Let the Sun Go Down so you don't even allow it to go you allow it to rise you are still we mustn't do that Brothers Let's challenge ourselves and say hey me I'm gonna be happy when I'm upset and everything I'm gonna say honey I love you I love you I wipe my tears and I love you because I'm upset and I smile Ah that's what we must do we must make them fearful brothers and say this oh hey if your father comes here let's not do that Brothers brothers let's not do that no I don't talk like brother brother Jonah said no we just I don't want to talk you don't know how to talk that's the devil so God help us as brothers God help us as the mothers you've got a very important role young people let's hold the fort together it's just a little bit more left more left just a little bit more left and I'm telling you that day when you change you want to be changed you want to go home because it's going to be I was talking to my wife I think it was one of the days from these holidays I said ah you know that morning when the revenue is going to be a simple day like this one it was a nice day cloudless you know they say day when the day comes and you just feel good you just look at the day and you just feel you I feel good about today the day is coming I haven't eaten a breakfast maybe I haven't done nothing I just walk outside and you just feel good doesn't it happen to you Mama and you just feel good it's going to be a day like that when you say to the neighbor you say beautiful day today and we say and you just hear the neighbor starting your car and if you are there by the my limbs you just hear the waves going like normal then you feel a car passing you know it's gonna be a normal day a normal day where ND wakes up and want to make coffee you know it's gonna be a simple day a simple normal day and any rise I will wake up at six o'clock and the wakes up and start his car and drinks his coffee you know he likes to get his things structured brother and then it's gonna be a day like that gonna be a simple day like that where you wake up Tiana and you want to go what did I say I want to do for the Sunday School oh yeah oh yes then you want your computer a simple day like that that's how it's gonna be when Adam I'm just gonna wake up and think that oh I must go yes today I'm traveling there there flies and everything could it be a day like that it's gonna be a simple day like that where you think David today I'm gonna finish that job oh yesterday the Lord was with me and you wake up and before you go and you just you just you know only been a chance to feel strange you're just gonna change it's gonna be a day just like that where you wake up and you think you're going to write the exam or submit your assignment you're too late you're changed it's gonna be a day like that it's gonna be a day like that so it's worth it all that we check every aspect of Our Lives I'm done now Jesus you have to encourage you to say it's important for us to separate it's important for us to honor that Nazarite identity of Who We Are and if you don't honor it do your best go and cry on your knees before God God it's never too late with the Lord and I'm preaching this to myself everything that I said here is to myself too is directed to me if I say you you and you these three fingers are pointing at me so I'm saying this with a clear conscious clear mindset to know that heimple that's also for you I'm not just making it hard for you and I want to make it hard for myself because it's better for it to be hard for me now and jump in the rapture and go may the Lord bless you may the Lord shine upon you and your families in your life in your journey may he prepare you because he's a perfect God and can I tell you what we all just think that I'm saying go do them and do them once you just open and give your heart he'll do it for you it's gonna do it for you that's why he came to die at the cross to show you that hey I'll be with you even unto the very end of the world all he needs is your positive mind your positive attitude you're just gonna wake up and you see Danny he's bigger is the same as you and you look at yourself I've changed also hold we are going maybe this is South Africa at that time he says hey and one what's happening there no no we're that time my friend I don't know how fast you're going to run over I'm telling you it's gonna be a time like never before that's why it's worth emphasizing on it to us ourselves our wives our husbands and our children and all our beloved ones you you you've got no time not to forgive anyone oh time of a grudge you've got no time those things are for the devil not for me not for you time for me to think that you don't like me I've got no time for that I've got no time for that I know Jesus likes me and I like you that's it so so Jesus Christ has got no time for Peter cutting of the ear please those are worthy things that's why he's reprimanding Peter wake up man don't you see it's not it's the general day that's trying to make you do that wake up I like Peter Peter I like him very much we'll talk about Peter there's someone to be Peter one day I mean that guy I like him uh I think I'm like him because he was he was a good getterman he just got himself into trouble many times and and I'm like I just walk on water then I then I think oh then the Lord said come on you have little faith I I I'm like that I go fast so may God help us to be like Peter we may not all be like Peter but let's find a character like ourselves let's sing a beautiful song that says into thy presence we come amen [Applause] you know assistant one into their presence we come not not by The Works that I've done but by your grace and your grace alone let's stand on our feet amen [Music] do you want to lead us maybe I think it would be better if just lead us sorry go for it I'll follow you I'm I'm I've got a wrong key into thy presence we come Lord by the works we have done [Music] by thy Grace thy Grace [Music] oh into that Praises wake up into thy pleases [Music] we come on oh bye by his grace his grace [Music] [Music] and we come on [Music] wake
