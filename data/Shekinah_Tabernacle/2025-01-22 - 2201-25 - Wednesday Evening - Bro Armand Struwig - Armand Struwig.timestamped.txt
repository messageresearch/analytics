[26:37] do believe the Lord has somewhat to

[26:49] can have service amen so I can go into
[26:51] that no just joking okay let's just put
[26:54] that one on the
[26:55] screen Matthew 18 it says verily I say
[26:58] unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on
[27:01] Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[27:04] whatsoever you shall loose on Earth
[27:06] shall be loosed in heaven and again I
[27:09] say unto you remember this is our Lord
[27:11] speaking that if two or more of you
[27:13] shall agree on Earth as touching
[27:16] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[27:19] done of My Father which is in heaven for
[27:23] we two or three are gathered together in
[27:26] my name there I am in the midst of them
[27:30] let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we
[27:31] have opened this word but we know it's
[27:33] It's Only You Lord that can come and
[27:35] speak to our hearts and really open up
[27:37] to us what you want to tell us today
[27:39] Lord so we ask that you would speak
[27:41] completely take me out of out of the way
[27:43] Lord you just have preeminence For Your
[27:45] Glory and for your kingdom we welcome
[27:47] you in in the name of our Lord Jesus
[27:49] Christ amen amen amen you may have your
[27:53] seats Saints it's such a wonderful thing
[27:55] to be a Christian these days now I think
[27:57] sometimes the world don't really
[27:59] comprehend what it is to be a Christian
[28:01] they think Jesus Christ is a story they
[28:04] want to always go into creation and they
[28:06] always want an explanation for the
[28:10] supernatural but I want your attention
[28:13] young men young ladies I want your
[28:16] attention
[28:18] tonight he's
[28:20] alive he's very much
[28:23] alive and guess what he's even closer
[28:26] than your very next breath yeah see
[28:29] don't mean that you can't see the Lord
[28:31] he's not there don't mean that you come
[28:33] here and you might feel as dead as a
[28:35] door poost that God's not dealing with
[28:36] you sometimes when you pray you think
[28:38] you have to get into this realm of some
[28:41] some experience and emotion so that God
[28:44] would come down somewhere from Heaven to
[28:46] your level to answer your prayer that's
[28:49] not the case he's here he's the very
[28:51] present God he said I am the I am so
[28:55] when Moses came to him and he says when
[28:56] I go to Israel who do I tell them sent
[28:59] me he says I am because he didn't say my
[29:03] name is I am he said I'm the present God
[29:05] that's he says and when you come before
[29:07] Governors when people challenge you and
[29:10] and you come before a tight spot don't
[29:11] worry about what you're going to say I
[29:13] will put those words in your mouth so
[29:15] the very the I am is there but see he
[29:18] didn't make us boneless he didn't make
[29:21] us not strong and overcoming I think
[29:23] sometimes we heed too much to the
[29:25] devil's conversation and not enough to
[29:27] God's promis
[29:28] yeah we always see the negative we
[29:30] always see the oh why me we never just
[29:32] stop and go hold on what did he make me
[29:35] what am I what am I made of you know you
[29:38] you say the great creator that created
[29:40] heavens and earth comes and steps into a
[29:43] body and you can lay your hands on
[29:45] someone and they can recover amen it's
[29:47] not you doing the healing it's God
[29:49] anointing you to do it but see you still
[29:51] think oh I have to work myself up and
[29:54] brother brandom has a story where he
[29:56] says there was a pastor and or a man
[29:58] that sponsored one of his meetings man
[30:01] I'm already off my nose brother he
[30:02] sponsored one of his meetings and a wall
[30:05] fell over on on him and it burst his
[30:07] liver he was in hospital he was really
[30:09] bad and he was sitting talking to his
[30:11] wife and he says I a man with unclean
[30:13] hands but if Jesus went that way and he
[30:16] just laid his holy hands upon that man
[30:18] he shall recover so the prophet of God
[30:21] seeing Miracle upon Miracle says my
[30:23] hands are dirty have you ever thought
[30:26] about this this this man opened up the
[30:29] word and gave us Revelation and tell us
[30:31] thus sayith the Lord and it happened
[30:33] time and time again and he's
[30:36] unworthy and he's sitting there and he
[30:38] goes you know what but I know if Jesus
[30:41] gives me a vision and I walk to that man
[30:44] it's
[30:45] done and then he sits and thinks about
[30:47] it a little bit and he goes you know
[30:48] what hold on it's the same dirty hands
[30:52] if Jesus gives me a vision it's the same
[30:54] dirty hands that has to be laid on him
[30:56] so guess what I'm going to do
[30:58] I'm going to go to that man and I'm
[31:00] going to lay my hands on him and I'm
[31:01] going to pray because he says it's the
[31:02] prayer of faith it is faith that brings
[31:05] that man back faith in the word of God
[31:08] that these hands can heal not my ability
[31:11] that he can do it through these hands
[31:12] these unclean hands and he goes to that
[31:15] young man and he goes lays his hands
[31:17] upon him and he prays for him and that
[31:19] evening he's back in the service do you
[31:21] want to see that do you think it's
[31:26] impossible it's not see why is it
[31:28] impossible have we have we connected to
[31:31] this realm too
[31:33] much that's that's what we're doing that
[31:35] is our commission so let's go on that's
[31:38] just my
[31:40] Foundation is that the blind man yes
[31:43] there's some Blind Men here in Matthew 9
[31:46] they're blind so for me it means they
[31:48] cannot see correct but just before Jesus
[31:52] gets to these Blind Men and walk past
[31:54] them there's two events that happened
[31:56] first one is there was he that took
[31:58] place of the woman that touched the Hem
[32:00] of His Garment for 12 years she
[32:04] struggled how many of you Believers are
[32:06] plus 12 years struggling with something
[32:09] right
[32:10] now 12 years this woman was an Agony she
[32:15] wasn't feeling good she had a blood
[32:17] issue it was something that was
[32:18] embarrassing it was something that she
[32:20] really wanted to get doubt with and many
[32:22] a time she prayed and she
[32:26] believed but she she just needed a
[32:28] moment where Jesus was passing her way
[32:31] isn't that tonight who makes it for a
[32:33] Sunday service who makes it for a
[32:35] service at Camp what are we here for to
[32:38] see the supernatural or did you come to
[32:41] just sit in church and go I've been here
[32:43] I want to see the supernatural I want to
[32:45] see Jesus Christ step for out of the
[32:47] word because that's the commission he
[32:49] gave us and he said we're two or more
[32:52] Gather in my name have we gathered in
[32:54] his name is he
[32:56] here so don't don't think about this
[32:58] realm think about God is here he down
[33:01] went because we gathered in his name and
[33:03] he stepped out of Eternity and he came
[33:06] back into time and he's sitting right
[33:07] here and he's listening and he's been
[33:10] ministering you all week he's been
[33:12] talking to you all week he says do you
[33:14] want your healing I am here just take me
[33:18] at my word and these Blind Men hear
[33:20] about the case of the woman that's
[33:21] healed because there's always a a a
[33:24] commotion when Jesus are there and
[33:26] healing takes place people rejoice it's
[33:27] a wonderful thing have you ever been
[33:29] delivered from a from any illness
[33:33] sickness remember your song make this
[33:36] trial a
[33:37] blessing have you ever come to a point
[33:39] where God has given you the other side
[33:41] of the
[33:42] mountain when you just see a big wall
[33:44] have you come there what do you do you
[33:47] tell
[33:47] everyone so why not you why not
[33:51] now so you so long we've prayed so long
[33:55] we've claimed so long we've believed why
[33:57] not do know
[33:59] yes sir why do we have to wait for a
[34:00] camp meeting it's the same God so these
[34:04] Blind Men also hear from the daughter
[34:07] one of the leaders in Israel he goes and
[34:09] he raises his daughter from the
[34:11] dead so now there's a big commotion
[34:14] because it says his Fame went across the
[34:16] whole
[34:17] country and these Blind Men hear that
[34:19] Jesus has walked past and we've got it
[34:21] here and he says and when Jesus
[34:23] Department um departed then the two
[34:26] Blind Men followed him
[34:28] they're
[34:31] blind think
[34:33] Logistics they are blind he's walking
[34:36] they are
[34:38] following because there's inside
[34:40] something they need yeah they in need of
[34:43] healing they want their eyes back but I
[34:46] want you to to realize it's two sides
[34:49] that work here not just the
[34:51] one and they shout they cry saying thou
[34:55] son of David have mercy on us
[34:58] they approach their approach to God was
[35:01] Lord have mercy their approach is Lord
[35:04] only you can do it but have mercy so
[35:07] they come with an absolutely soldout
[35:09] approach Lord if you cannot do it
[35:11] they're already in the right atmosphere
[35:14] they are prayed up they came here for a
[35:16] purpose I hope you read between the
[35:18] lines they they came here expecting
[35:20] healing they didn't go there they knew
[35:23] he could do it they just had to approach
[35:25] him right so they go believe is says
[35:28] Thou son of David have mercy and when he
[35:30] was coming to the house the blind man
[35:33] came to him and Jesus said unto him
[35:35] believe ye that I am able to do
[35:38] this here's God's question tonight to
[35:41] you do you believe that he can do
[35:48] it and he says and they say unto him yay
[35:53] Lord so see he waits for them he wants a
[35:58] response from
[36:00] you he can do it he did do it by his
[36:03] stripes he already healed it's done but
[36:06] he's waiting for your response because
[36:09] God is such a gentleman he will never
[36:11] Force healing even upon
[36:13] you it sounds rough but why would he
[36:16] come and go you're now healed and go do
[36:18] this he waits for your response because
[36:21] it's about a relationship my wife wants
[36:24] me to wash the dishes if she asks me I
[36:26] will do it if she doesn't I sidestep
[36:28] that trial okay let's get it right I do
[36:31] not try to get by that Basin ever but I
[36:35] know she wants me to do it but I really
[36:37] really wanted to ask me okay but Jesus
[36:41] Christ wants to have such a personal
[36:43] relationship that he wants you to ask
[36:46] him
[36:47] amen because what he said is if two or
[36:50] more agree in my name and whatever they
[36:52] bind here upon the Earth it's
[36:55] bound it's bound
[36:58] full stop period nothing it's bound and
[37:00] if you with your unwise words loosen
[37:05] something he will loosen in heaven so
[37:08] let let's be careful what we do with our
[37:11] confessions let's be careful what we say
[37:13] to one another because as much as we
[37:16] reap a good harvest what you seow you
[37:20] will reap amen so I didn't give you a p
[37:23] but he you out he says then he touched
[37:25] their eyes saying according to you your
[37:28] faith not I am Jesus creator of heavens
[37:32] and earth oh you have you it's me he
[37:35] said according to your
[37:38] faith so he wants to show us something
[37:40] that it's always about your faith
[37:44] touching his ability because he's done
[37:48] it brother brandham said if Jesus Christ
[37:50] was here he couldn't y you anyway
[37:52] because he's already done it before the
[37:54] foundation of the world it's done so do
[37:57] we settle that by his stripes you were
[38:01] healed amen amen amen but see we need to
[38:04] encourage ourselves in the faith to go
[38:06] he is able to do it
[38:11] amen let me go one step further all
[38:13] these little photos is when I get a
[38:16] thought I put a photo to it because it
[38:17] reminds me where I was when we did
[38:20] it David says bless the Lord oh my soul
[38:24] with all that's within me bless His holy
[38:26] name bless the Lord oh my soul and
[38:29] forget not his
[38:32] benefits healing is a benefit
[38:35] Deliverance is a benefit you think it's
[38:38] lame to be a Christian I've got
[38:40] benefits overcoming my
[38:43] benefit walking like no other man on
[38:46] this Earth not in sin not in iniquity
[38:49] not in false teachings not after some
[38:52] rock star or whatever walking a straight
[38:55] good road amen with a testimony of Jesus
[38:57] Christ that is why I have I'm that's my
[39:02] benefit cuz sometimes to sacrifice
[39:04] something you think you're losing out
[39:06] let me tell me young man you are not
[39:08] losing
[39:09] out those guys will give everything they
[39:13] own if they ever find out they have
[39:15] cancer they will give everything they
[39:18] own to meet
[39:19] God but because they don't know who he
[39:22] is they can't meet him he gives them
[39:25] chance after chance and they they fight
[39:27] their way to hell but you go to the
[39:29] richest man upon the Earth right now and
[39:31] you say you got 10 hours to live I tell
[39:34] you he'll take every scent he owns and
[39:36] he throws it in there to try and give
[39:38] him one more second yeah but his hands
[39:42] is not his life is not in his
[39:45] hands so I don't care if you're Richard
[39:47] Branson or you're the richest man on
[39:50] earth if you drop the big hey you got
[39:52] cancer and it's terminal and it's your
[39:54] last day question at him I'm telling you
[39:57] he his money will not buy his salvation
[39:59] and cannot give him his healing see the
[40:02] nice thing about being a Believer is
[40:04] even if you don't get your
[40:07] healing you know where your Soul's
[40:09] going you're not running around like a
[40:11] headless chicken stressing out you know
[40:13] you're all good but see but you can be
[40:16] as rich and as nice as you are but if
[40:18] that side of it is still not ready if
[40:20] your soul is not saved boy when that
[40:23] question comes your way or that thing
[40:24] comes your way it's a total different
[40:26] game right that's right and some people
[40:29] don't have a chance to go find God you
[40:33] know how many South Africans die on the
[40:34] road every year Split Second gone some
[40:38] of my friends I was 19 years old you
[40:40] little ones 19 years old I get a phone
[40:44] call so off my notes but I think this is
[40:46] for you I get a phone call 12:00 at
[40:49] night Nikki Morrison has just died in a
[40:52] car accident fell asleep on the steering
[40:54] wheel not drunk
[40:57] a very one of my best of best friends I
[41:00] ever had he was my budy through thick
[41:02] and thin 19 years old didn't know the
[41:07] Lord what's the first thing I think of I
[41:10] wasn't even saved back then I didn't
[41:12] even know the Lord I thought man I hope
[41:14] I'm
[41:15] ready because then stuff gets real it's
[41:18] nice living in a in a believer's
[41:20] atmosphere it's when it gets real when
[41:22] it gets real where are we when when they
[41:26] tell you you're sick where are you you
[41:28] do you really have faith then to believe
[41:30] are we just fighting that same old devil
[41:32] every
[41:33] year see but what happened with these
[41:35] Blind Men they realized there was a way
[41:37] out and Jesus didn't make it easy he
[41:40] asked them a simple question do you
[41:43] believe and now we think God is in a
[41:46] realm somewhere there in the eons and
[41:48] when we pray we have to break through
[41:50] this ceiling to go to another Cloud to
[41:52] go through to reach God no listen to
[41:55] this who have given forgiven all
[41:57] iniquities who give all Health all thy
[42:00] diseases which redeemeth thy life from
[42:04] destruction and to Crown thee with
[42:06] loving kindness and Tender Mercies who
[42:08] satisfies thy mouth with good things so
[42:11] that thy youth will be renewed Like an
[42:13] Eagle he's a present
[42:16] God he wants to
[42:18] restore he's not a punishing God he's he
[42:21] he he sometimes puts a trial in you to
[42:23] wake you up a little bit but he's not a
[42:25] punishing God he wants to give you David
[42:27] saw the better side of God the the not
[42:30] the Judgment God because he did
[42:31] something with basba he saw the side of
[42:33] God that goes no matter what I do even
[42:37] when I was born in this Psalm go read it
[42:40] you still had me in your mind before my
[42:43] members were formed before my arms even
[42:46] appeared you already knew I was coming
[42:49] so God knows there's no surprise where
[42:50] you are at now every everything you
[42:53] watch on YouTube Twitter and whatever
[42:56] other channel is do you think you watch
[42:58] alone in your room yeah do you
[43:02] surprise he's there he might not want to
[43:05] stay there because remember we can also
[43:08] offend him but he's there amen and no
[43:11] matter what you go through and no matter
[43:13] how much you have failed he says there
[43:16] he's there to forgive all thine
[43:19] iniquities so if you got it wrong what
[43:22] do we do we turn our face back to Jesus
[43:27] Lord I I need you a bit here I'm in a
[43:29] tough spot cuz remember healing healing
[43:32] is not just cancer healing is not just a
[43:35] common cold healing is not fighting with
[43:37] kidney stuff that's not just healing the
[43:39] soul is so much more important yeah he
[43:43] might put the biggest trial on you but
[43:44] if your soul is not there what's the
[43:46] point of being healed you'll get sick
[43:49] again but when your soul is saved
[43:52] nothing else then matters but his word
[43:56] and if he heals you go amen and if he
[43:58] doesn't heal you go amen but does that
[44:00] hinder your belief no he can do it
[44:02] sister margi he can do
[44:05] it it's not it's not about your how much
[44:09] Faith you have it's just take him at his
[44:11] word he can do it I've seen him done
[44:13] wonderful things I was a Liam stain was
[44:16] sick
[44:17] man if I didn't see it with my own eyes
[44:20] I can tell you now I'm a witness he can
[44:22] do it don't let nothing hinder the faith
[44:26] don't let let nothing come between your
[44:28] lord and your you and your savior your
[44:31] lord Jesus Christ don't let it come
[44:33] between it's a lying vanity it's
[44:36] nonsense you don't have to work yourself
[44:38] into emotion to come to the front and
[44:40] burst all out if you want to do it but
[44:42] I'm telling you now brother brandom
[44:44] never approached people there he says
[44:45] the same God that's here is the same God
[44:48] that's there and what touched us she
[44:50] touched the him of His Garment and who
[44:51] touched you I'm standing on the platform
[44:54] it wasn't the prophet of God healing it
[44:56] was the faith of the people people he
[44:57] just preached the word they raised up
[44:59] the faith and they saw but this is a
[45:01] different realm may your faith be raised
[45:04] tonight we come for a prayer meeting not
[45:06] just for us but for everyone I don't
[45:09] believe that any sick person should
[45:11] leave here
[45:12] tonight with my whole heart I wish I
[45:14] could tell you that Jesus Christ heals
[45:18] amen don't work yourself up just take
[45:21] him at his word don't let no lying devil
[45:24] come between you and the Lord never and
[45:27] healing is not just physical it is
[45:29] spiritual
[45:31] yes sickness of the body brother Brandon
[45:34] picks this up I'll read it I'll just put
[45:36] it there for sometimes my reading is not
[45:38] the best so you can follow me he says
[45:41] now remember this isn't all the days of
[45:43] thy life he is now remember I got a
[45:46] little sermon I preach he's God in the H
[45:48] Housetop he's God in the sell he's God
[45:50] in the prison he's God in the hospital
[45:52] he's God in church he's God in the Pew
[45:54] he's God everywhere I said the is God in
[45:57] you but he's God that's right he says
[46:00] he's God he's just as much God there as
[46:04] what he is here he's God in heaven he's
[46:06] God everywhere he's omnipresent do you
[46:09] believe that that's what he's asking
[46:12] them it's the same Jesus th steps forth
[46:15] he's busy with a sermon and the same
[46:17] Jesus stop it's the blind man all over
[46:19] again and he goes do you believe
[46:21] it it's not something you have to work
[46:24] in he's asking a simple question to the
[46:26] crowd do you believe it they got a
[46:28] choice now they can accept his word or
[46:31] they can deny it if they deny it they
[46:33] cannot get their healing no matter how
[46:36] much the prophet of God is praying now
[46:38] over that Pulpit they will not receive
[46:39] the healing that's why he says can thou
[46:42] believe
[46:43] it he goes
[46:46] on he says I missed a few hands here oh
[46:50] no he says now there's a oh here we go
[46:52] now there was a little woman in the
[46:54] Bible that couldn't have a prayer card
[46:56] or get in a prayer line but she touched
[46:59] the border of His Garment you remember
[47:01] that he says that's all prayer um never
[47:04] that's all the prayer card she ever
[47:07] needed if she had a prayer card without
[47:11] that kind of Faith she would have not
[47:13] got healed but she had faith without the
[47:17] prayer card don't major on the
[47:20] minors don't major on the minors it's
[47:22] your
[47:23] faith it is absolutely the faith you put
[47:26] in the word of Christ will bring the
[47:28] result it's the key to unlock everything
[47:32] he says and that's all that's necessary
[47:34] there you have it have the faith without
[47:36] a prayer card you can be healed do you
[47:40] believe that he ask it
[47:42] again he's in the prayer line and he's
[47:45] getting the people to start thinking
[47:47] this is more than just a normal thing
[47:50] I'm asking you can you believe and they
[47:52] say yay
[47:54] Lord he says
[47:56] just to let you know God is still God
[47:59] and he answers prayer out there so
[48:02] nowhere and I this critics that so
[48:04] against this message saying brother
[48:05] Brandon made himself a Healer and blah
[48:07] blah blah where does he step in
[48:10] here tell me where does he come and say
[48:12] I'm this great prophet touch the him of
[48:14] my garment wherever has brother brandham
[48:17] and I challenge every believer out there
[48:19] that don't believe this message when did
[48:21] he say I'm a
[48:23] Healer cuz there's all this nonsense
[48:25] going around to put confusion God was
[48:28] there he says can yall believe it's the
[48:30] same as the Blind Men but Jesus said let
[48:33] the blind lead the blind they both will
[48:35] fall in the ditch may you get I myself
[48:37] tonight may you grab that Hem of His
[48:39] Garment may you say yay Lord he said
[48:41] because what he do is he took his hands
[48:44] and he laid it upon their eyes and he
[48:45] says according to thy faith you are
[48:48] healed and they were healed it takes a
[48:51] little bit more for us that's why said a
[48:53] Believer has a backbone when the doctor
[48:56] says is not going to happen the believer
[48:58] goes say who he tried all he can I
[49:01] believe in doctors don't get me wrong my
[49:03] mom was in Hospital doctors gave all
[49:05] their reports I'm saying he's more than
[49:08] able to take her out of that
[49:10] hospital more than able why should I
[49:13] take the the advice of a doctor if I
[49:15] know my God is
[49:16] greater and if my God wants my mom to be
[49:19] sick she'll be sick and if he wants to
[49:21] heal her he heal it it's not about what
[49:23] God wants it's about I believe cuz I'm a
[49:26] believer that he will heal her how long
[49:29] it ever takes not my problem God's
[49:31] problem he steps on scene and he goes
[49:33] now you heal God takes over when I get
[49:35] to the end of the
[49:37] road when I get to the end of my ability
[49:40] that's when God steps in we could get to
[49:42] the end of our ability a bit sooner
[49:45] Believers we can get about this believe
[49:47] just get to the end of your own ability
[49:49] you cannot heal yourself God's the only
[49:52] one he goes on here and he says here's
[49:54] something I want to really anchor in
[49:56] tonight and and I'll maybe skip through
[49:57] a bit more now he's not just talking in
[50:00] this service about
[50:02] healing he's going to go a little bit
[50:04] deeper about this this is now busy with
[50:06] the pre he says I missed the hands over
[50:09] there everybody there put you um that
[50:11] put up hands that has in the prayer card
[50:13] all around he says oh I guess it's just
[50:15] everybody so now everybody's believing
[50:19] they put their hands up they react they
[50:21] deny gravity and they go it's for
[50:23] me sometimes when you feel in church I
[50:26] want to just drop something in and
[50:29] something says lift up your
[50:31] hands and it's inan that's that feeling
[50:34] don't deny it yeah because to deny it is
[50:38] to to just say I'm going to be stuck in
[50:39] this world you want to take a Rapture
[50:41] one day lift up your hands cuz if you
[50:44] cannot lift up your hands how are you
[50:45] supposed to lift this body
[50:48] up abely cuz what Satan wants you to do
[50:51] is no don't because the Reuben's
[50:53] watching or or you will be uncool Mo if
[50:56] you do this course they might look at
[50:58] you funny forget them cut them out if
[51:01] it's for you lift up your hands if the
[51:05] Lord places it on your heart just do it
[51:07] deny what the devil wants to do he wants
[51:10] you not to do
[51:13] it but this is an expression why is this
[51:16] so hard to do okay everybody hands down
[51:17] hands down okay on three let's lift our
[51:20] hands
[51:21] upu okay how hard was that to do let's
[51:25] go again I think some of you struggling
[51:27] okay and lift your hands
[51:29] up okay so that's the second time you've
[51:31] done it in church praise the Lord let's
[51:32] go again third time Perfection let's
[51:35] raise our hands
[51:36] up okay so on the third time how hard
[51:39] was it to do you all Justified
[51:42] gravity Satan goes don't don't don't
[51:45] don't don't oh they did it n surely they
[51:47] won't do the second don't don't don't oh
[51:48] they did it again and here on the third
[51:49] time he goes okay I give
[51:52] up because now you have overcoming power
[51:55] cuz your whole arm arms got like lead
[51:58] cuz you're thinking I hope the boys are
[51:59] not watching me OHS are like
[52:03] lead I got these ones
[52:07] or and then you go second time oh
[52:09] everybody lift their hands oh maybe I'll
[52:11] go
[52:12] higher and then the third time you're
[52:14] like hey here I am because it's actually
[52:18] not that hard so why if this is not so
[52:21] hard do you so struggle in church what's
[52:23] hindering you what's pushing you back
[52:24] it's a simple question if if you just
[52:27] did this what's so hard to do it in
[52:31] church it's a hindering spirit that
[52:33] doesn't want you to overcome it's the
[52:36] same thing as do you believe you go amen
[52:39] oh wow we have some Believers
[52:41] here the preacher is preaching he's blue
[52:44] in the face and he goes and and do you
[52:46] believe and everybody's
[52:48] like like come on man amen I believe I
[52:52] was made a Believer I've got this thing
[52:55] called backbone Jesus said I'm saved I'm
[52:57] saved he says I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm
[52:59] a Believer we're not unbelievers here
[53:03] I'm telling you unbelievers can run
[53:05] behind their favorite football team and
[53:07] go
[53:08] yeah come and
[53:11] church what is that they have Liberty
[53:14] out there but it one comes to the things
[53:16] of Miracles happening in their midst
[53:19] they don't believe I'm done on that one
[53:23] he says this is a sick world isn't it
[53:26] but you know what is the sickest body on
[53:28] earth now I want you to realize this is
[53:30] the prophet speaking he says I say this
[53:33] in reverence and I say this too because
[53:35] when I read that it was so impactful he
[53:38] says not to be Sac religious God forgive
[53:40] me if I say this wrong the body of
[53:43] Christ needs healing it can only be
[53:46] healed by brotherly
[53:48] love the sick people is not the ones out
[53:52] in the street and in the
[53:55] stadiums let's wake wake up sh the sick
[53:58] ones is
[54:01] here but we deal harsher with the ones
[54:05] here then we deal with the ones out
[54:10] there he says that sick body I know of
[54:14] it's broken into pieces and tore
[54:19] up tore up this is our Prophet speaking
[54:23] I want you to realize this impacted me
[54:25] when I read it
[54:29] yeah he says here come on just I pray
[54:33] for the healing of that body and you're
[54:37] the members of that body so God heal you
[54:40] physically and
[54:42] spiritually it's no point you can do 150
[54:46] push-ups on the Trot and the brother
[54:48] next to you is dying
[54:52] spiritually there's no problem if you
[54:54] can give the fastest knockout in time
[54:56] the guy next to you is breathing for air
[54:59] the same faith that heals you that
[55:02] healed me can heal the one next to you
[55:05] so when we get to these prayer meetings
[55:07] the same Faith you had that saved you
[55:10] that brought salvation upon yourself
[55:13] could do the one right next to you if
[55:14] you get in the right atmosphere it could
[55:17] save the one right next to you but
[55:19] sometimes we so caught up in our little
[55:21] world our Twitter world and our out
[55:24] there world and our friendship group and
[55:25] our clicks and everything that we forget
[55:27] there's one dying right next to
[55:31] us but we want healing and Jesus said
[55:34] before you cast the moat out of your
[55:36] brother's eye let's work with that beam
[55:39] in yours once you've taken the beam out
[55:42] of yours he didn't say don't go help
[55:44] your brother he says once you taken this
[55:46] beam out go to your brother and help
[55:48] him never said just leave it oh the
[55:51] beam's out yeah okay you go bro he said
[55:53] then you go and you help him isn't that
[55:55] why we're here
[55:57] huh so let us not get in this
[56:00] state let us not get in the state where
[56:03] shakina is broken to pieces and we
[56:06] forgot that the healing is from the body
[56:08] and the
[56:09] Soul have we listened to the last
[56:11] sermons coming over this Pulpit have
[56:15] we God is speaking to us
[56:18] amen now David he got this David Goes
[56:23] Lord and this is just me I want to say
[56:25] this to to to light them a little bit up
[56:27] okay hear me out cuz I'm not fighting
[56:29] with you I want you to realize that
[56:31] everything we do actually means
[56:35] something every action every reaction
[56:39] every prayer set on our knees every
[56:41] sorry every everything we do has healing
[56:45] or it has
[56:46] pain it's just how it is carnally
[56:49] spiritually everything okay he says
[56:53] whether shall I go for thy spirit so
[56:56] even if I try to flee from your spirit
[56:59] where shall I flee from thy presence if
[57:02] I incend into heaven thou are there if I
[57:05] make my bed in hell behold thou are
[57:08] there if I take my wings for the morning
[57:10] and dwell in the uttermost parts of the
[57:12] sea even if I even thy hand shall lead
[57:15] me and thy right hand shall hold me so
[57:19] even if you think you're the most
[57:20] ungodly person upon this earth and the
[57:23] most unsavable person he's still holding
[57:27] you he's still with you he's still
[57:30] brooding over you because it's not about
[57:32] your performance it's about his ability
[57:34] to keep you Hallelujah if it was any
[57:38] sense about our performance we would all
[57:40] be lost or our filthy our righteousness
[57:44] about filthy
[57:45] rags it's not about you keeping it's
[57:48] about him keeping
[57:50] you so what I want to say tonight is
[57:52] we've got a prayer meeting here we're
[57:55] here for one reason to pray not to be
[57:57] preached at not to be fought with but to
[58:01] enter in and say Lord who do I pray do
[58:04] we get like this of prayer meetings what
[58:06] is the next devil needs to come off
[58:08] where are we going who needs prayer who
[58:10] needs healing the body is shattered we
[58:12] need to get we need to get there no
[58:14] matter where we
[58:16] go you are going to be there I said well
[58:18] I want to go on with this he says surely
[58:20] even if the darkness shall Darkness
[58:22] shall cover me the darkness shall be my
[58:25] light
[58:26] he says even if I can't see right in
[58:28] front of my hands there will be
[58:31] light he
[58:33] says for thou H has possessed my Reigns
[58:36] thou has has covered me in my mother's
[58:38] womb I praise thee for I am fearfully
[58:40] and wonderfully made marvelously are thy
[58:42] works and that my soul knoweth right
[58:45] well my substance was not heat from thee
[58:49] listen to this how personal David Gets
[58:51] he gets right into the grain of it he
[58:53] says when I was made in secret
[58:56] when I was made in secret and curiously
[58:58] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[59:01] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[59:04] being unperfected and in thy book of all
[59:07] my members were written with in
[59:09] continuance think about it when my
[59:12] members were written in your book when I
[59:13] was still Contin when I was formed in
[59:15] the womb when my arm wasn't even there
[59:16] when my eyes wasn't even there that's
[59:18] why I'm so against abortion he's already
[59:21] knowing you're going to be
[59:23] there that's why I hate taking a lot of
[59:26] an innocent baby this is in the womb and
[59:28] he says here listen to what he says with
[59:30] incontinence were fashioned so he's
[59:33] still being made into the image of what

[1:00:50] then already he put his angels in charge
[1:00:52] of you and your mother and your father
[1:00:55] some of the dad so I'm about to close
[1:00:56] just hang in there he says now we get to
[1:01:00] this
[1:01:01] point where we need to touch the him of
[1:01:04] His
[1:01:05] Garment now I want to tell you I
[1:01:07] shouldn't have showed you that slide
[1:01:09] don't read go that way don't
[1:01:12] read this is our commission he says oh
[1:01:16] that's Mary's one so good I changed the
[1:01:17] slide how many knows how many how many I
[1:01:20] want to ask one of the children how many
[1:01:22] people and the least I'm going to pick
[1:01:24] on you tonight how many people touch the
[1:01:26] H of Jesus's garment one okay so who
[1:01:30] says
[1:01:33] one who says
[1:01:36] two
[1:01:39] five
[1:01:42] 10 okay here's fun fact this is Jimmy s
[1:01:46] Jimmy I got this from
[1:01:48] you so Jesus goes to the boat and he
[1:01:51] calls Peter over the boat and Peter
[1:01:53] walks to Jesus and he he sees the way
[1:01:55] Wes and he's about to go down and Jesus
[1:01:58] grabs him and he saves him and they get
[1:02:00] back in the boat and the storm Cals and
[1:02:02] they go to the other side and they go to
[1:02:04] this place called
[1:02:05] Gareth and the leaders and the people it
[1:02:08] says here he says and when they've gone
[1:02:11] over they came to the land of Gareth and
[1:02:13] when the men of that place had knowledge
[1:02:15] of him do you have knowledge of him Ben
[1:02:19] is just the in charge of baby don't
[1:02:21] worry about it he says and when they
[1:02:23] gone over they came into Gareth and when
[1:02:25] the men had place of knowledge of them
[1:02:27] they sent unto all that country around
[1:02:29] them and brought them unto him that were
[1:02:32] diseased and besought him that they
[1:02:35] might only Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:02:37] and as many as touched were made
[1:02:39] perfectly

[1:03:04] other to Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:03:06] because remember each one of those men
[1:03:09] that was made perfectly whole it was
[1:03:10] still his faith and God yeah it wasn't
[1:03:14] the leaders he still had to have faith
[1:03:16] to know that when he touched that
[1:03:17] garment he would be healed why don't
[1:03:19] Jesus come tonight and we encourage each
[1:03:21] other to Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:03:24] and we forget about all the Shenanigans
