Father's Day Amen praise the Lord let's turn to the book of Exodus forgot the slideshow here let's read he Exodus six and in verse one two three is in the Lord said unto Moses how shall down there now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let him go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land and God spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the Lord and I appeared unto Abraham and to Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them amen licious bow heads in a the wood of Korea the old gracious father so thankful we have a human to go to Lord we have an eternal promise of a father we just want to commit the service into your hands lord I just pray father that you will anoint a speaker and here are one more time father may your word find prepared ground in our hearts Lord to bring forth a hundredfold Lord of your life we just pray you'd be with those who couldn't make it today father be their portion as well Lord may you just have preeminence in this service Lord we just want to glorify you lift you up Lord to worship and praise you father may you grant it Lord forgive us of our sons our iniquities our trespasses Lord may our whole lives be under your blood father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning now I want to I spoke along these lines a few years ago and I'm not repeating exactly what I what I said but I want to show that you know brother Branham he makes a statement that and we'll read this from the get-go where he sees this he sees now what is it now this is from river from the Patmos vision it's somebody approaching a great one approaching trumpet sounds someone's coming he looked hallelujah trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last he says not announcement of the second party or the third party but the only party I'm both Alpha and Omega before I show you anything I want you to know who I am I mean the greatest of all river is the deity the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get to first base until you believe that walk out what's that Peter said repent in be and then see the deity be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ remission of sins and then you're ready to go in the spirit the first thing you have to know is the deity of Christ I am Alpha and Omega I'm from A to Z there's no more but me I was at the beginning I'll be at the end I'm he that was which is and shall come the Almighty so it is absolutely essential that we do not make our Lord Jesus Christ the second person of eternity I mean or there's no to Lourdes there's one Lord the LORD thy God is one Lord amen so it's essential that we have a revelation that our Lord Jesus Christ is the Supreme God I mean there's no other God beside of there's no other Savior but him I mean that we must have this anchored into our hearts because because the thing is that people as we read last last week from the book of Jude as they deny the only Lord God our Lord Jesus Christ and a big part of that as they deny his word because he and his word is one as well it's essential that we have this together so you know I want to show you from the scripture and we have gone through this before but I you know this message exalts Jesus Christ to his to where he should be this message is a Bible message is not a another message it's not something outside the Bible it reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture I met in a big part of you know of the endtime restoration of the truth of the word is that Jesus Christ is the Almighty God manifested right it's very very vital that we understand that he's not the second person or the third person there's not three people in the Godhead right we don't worship three gods that's a heathen idea amen that's an idolatrous idea I mean that is heathen absolutely God is one hallelujah and in order to be a person you know people say three persons and they Godhead you have to be a separate I did there personality there's more than three people in this room but he is one and he has manifested in a sign Christ Jesus that was made right so now we read here that God God did was not knoin and we're and and we're gonna go on to this then what happens is all through the Bible God reveals a part of himself he's revealing a part of himself all the way down through and then I'm going to come down to the end and say well now that will be manifested in you because of what let's just summarize us women right now if we are called by his name right if we are the family of God in the life that was in him is now on us right we're not manifesting our natural family our first birth but if we walk according to the spirit we are manifesting his life right so everything that was in him is now reflected in us amen and we'll come to that so now we read here in Zachariah here Zechariah 14 and 9 and the Lord shall be king over all the earth and that day there shall be one Lord and his name one right he won't be divided into three or into two some people in the message make him to lords there's one Lord right his name shall be one so shall be shall be one name now we read here I'm just going to go through so so an ex for season and an IIST the high priest Caiaphas is and John and Alexander and as were many as we're the Kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel if we have this they be examined of the good deed done to then the impotent man by what means he has made whole be it known unto you all that and to all people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole so there's a power in the name of Jesus that gave the man has his ability to walk again now a name represents a life now we're just going to go through this and may you know just just just pull with me I want him to be exalted right I don't want you know the Bible declares he is the supreme one the the quote reread brother Brown was quoting from revelations chapter 1 he says I am The Almighty God I am the Alpha and the Omega amen and he said if you were first he's you know declare who he is and he's going to show you his plan of redemption amen so first Samuel 25 over 25 this is this is Abigail interceding for her husband unable it says let not my lord I pray thee regardless man of Belial even Abel for for as his neighbors so as he Nabal as his name and folly is with him but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my Lord whom now did a sin so now she is saying that his name is Mabel and so he is now enabled it means stupid or a wicked person so he was a man effect so so how he treated David and David servants was actually a manifestation of his name right and it's just like Jacob and the Bible so so as I see it a name in the Bible is extremely important because the life the character the nature of that person is expressed in their name right Jacob means supplanter and he was he supplied to thee story he he tricked us father lure out of you know many different cattle of different things he you know pulled all these shady deals because that was he was a manifestation of his name but then his name was changed right when he wrestled with the angel his name was changed from Jacob to Israel and prints with God right Sarah Abraham's wife Sarai her name was changed to Sarah now Sarah SAR AI her her original name means the motive means a hit person so she was out of her place she is manifesting her and that's why she said to Abraham take take Hagar and fulfill the promise she was actually trying to be the spiritual head of the whole move right but then her name was changed to be a princess Sarah means princess so she came into her position hallelujah and her name change represented that and then after her name was changed to Sarah then she had Isaac hallelujah so now through the scripture it's the same God revealing himself it's not a different one it's the same one so the God of the Old Testament is God our than you amen so it's the same one now God unfolds himself through Scripture and he does this by by changing his name right and what he's going to do in the day now in which we live is declared in his name now I want to do this because as I see it now the message restores the truth of the scripture it takes away man's Creed's and man's ideas and brings back the truth of the scripture because jesus said by teaching the commandments and doctrines of men you make the Word of God no effect to the people and the effect of the law and Jesus as they should have been they dwelling in their land no Romans or anything over them then dwelling with God amen possessing the full of severe inheritance I mean dwelling in peace with their God that's what the law should have produced when they were in the land that's what it should have produced but it didn't produce it causes because they brought in man's ideas man's Creed's man's tradition and it made the Word of God no effect right so now if the truth of the scripture is restored then the power of the Cross will be manifested in the believer that receives it right there they're overcoming power will be manifested in their lives they will not just be talking about it they will possess and will manifest the life that was in Jesus Christ will be in them hallelujah that's why it's very important that's why the message is vital because it takes away man's Crete's and it places the word as it should be placed hallelujah part of the Ministry of Elijah the you know you know when Elijah was out on on Mount Carmel you read it he rebuilt the altar a little bit had fallen down so stones that were neglected parts of the word that were neglected and had been set aside for a man-made altar I mean he rebuilt it and then he put the sacrifice on with the wood and the and the water and then God received that sacrifice the fire came down I mean that was the evidence that the altar was correct is because the fire came down and it's the same thing with you and I I mean when God receives our faith then the fire comes down then as Holy Spirit comes down and dwells in us hallelujah that's very important now we read that the greatest he says you can't get the first base until you believe that he's the supreme one oh yeah now this is a principle of the scripture he saith unto him I mean say Thunder dear me Jesus speaking to his disciples but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I'll give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven whilst ever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so the the rock that the church is built upon is the spiritual revelation of who he is who Jesus Christ is in his season this may be he say why are you going through these things because it's absolutely vital I mean because when the enemy comes and what's the first thing that devil does puts questions on the word and then you become a Trinitarian right because man's ideas they try and worked out who God was God's not known by study God's known by revelation where you read the word and then he he anoints that what you read any places that how it should be place where he reveals himself right so it is the the church is built upon the spiritual revelation of who Jesus Christ is who he is he is his word right he is his word so it's vital he is not a third person or a second person the Bible says that the fullness of the Godhead was in him burn him throughout the fullness of the Godhead bodily the Bible never says he was part of the Godhead never says he is third part of the God is is the fullness of God in Bali guava Braham says all that God poured into Christ all of himself he emptied into Christ then Christ has been poured into the church Allu you now let's go let's go to Exodus 3 and then we're gonna go to Genesis 1 but I want to lay out these principles here and Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and say unto them the law I mean the God of your father's has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you she's saying that I am the present god I am NOT that I was or other I will be I am he comes the present one to fulfill the promise now let's go to okay so I just want to load it so he's the same yesterday today and forever everything God was he still the same but Jesus Christ is present and his people right just like he was on the day on the days when he walked on the shores of Galilee but he's not in that body anymore yes right their bodies on the right hand of God making intercession he's he's still our high priest right we will meet that body in the air right but his spirits upon the earth so everything that was in the man of Galilee is now in the Bride of Christ because that same life that same spirit the same anointing that same living word is now in them okay so now Genesis 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth okay now that word God means the self existing one okay we you know we just read English the word god there's Elohim which is the which is the self existing one right and then now we go to we got there Genesis 2 and for these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made heavens and earth now so God you read Genesis what it says in God created and God said and God said but then when man's about to come into the scene it says and the Lord God because now God is the same God it's not to different gods it's not God made everything now the Lord God's going to deal with his children now it's the same God right unfolding himself making himself knowing okay so now when we read here in Genesis 6 and it says the Lord God now capital L OID it means Jehovah so the primary meaning of the name Lord which is Jehovah is the self existing one which we read about in Exodus 3 and 14 he that is who he is therefore the eternal I am but however from which Jehovah or Yahweh is formed signifies also to become that is to become known thus pointing to a continuous and increasing self revelation compiled combining these meanings of however we arrive at the meaning of the name Jehovah is the self existing one who reveals himself I mean so it is a advance upon the name of God of Elohim which suggests certain attributes of deity such as strength I mean rather than his essential being right so he's saying now he's he's this one he's now his Lord God he's the self existing one who now reveals himself I mean so he didn't he didn't have when he had animals upon the earth he couldn't reveal himself to them he had to put some on the earth that was made in his image that he could make himself known to Allu you so the same God now it's the same God right are you with me we're all following it so yep so and then now we're gonna go into the life of Abraham God God met Abraham many times but Abraham knew it was the same God okay now the Lord said unto Abraham which which became Abraham get the out of thy country and from thy kindred and from my father's house unto a land that I will show thee now we see this is capital L Ord which is Jehovah right I want you to hold that in your mind and when we come back to Exodus again so he reveals himself now calls him out of his country and then now we go to Genesis 14 and it says and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the Most High God and He blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heavens and earth and blessed be the Most High God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all now this this Melchizedek David writes about him as Jesus would be a priest after the order of Melchizedek but then and then also Paul writes about him and he says this about Melchizedek because this wasn't just a natural man coming to Abraham writes this is for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the Most High God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all-first being by interpretation king of righteousness and also after that king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent neither having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually so you're never beginning he didn't have parents he didn't have end of life he's eternal and the only one one eternal is God because it says in the New Testament that only God has immortality right so this was God now coming down and speaking day Brahim the same God admit that you're that spoke to me Genesis 12 is now speaking to him in Genesis chapter 14 the same God okay and then Genesis 17:1 and when Abraham was ninety and nine years old the Lord appeared to Abraham said I am the Almighty God walk before me and be their perfect so now he's declaring himself as the Lord God Almighty I am the Almighty God amen and this Almighty God is from the Hebrew word el shaddai I and it it so L so element means strong one and Shetty is formed from the Hebrew word shed which is the breast where so she say like like a mother breastfeeding a baby said that God the mighty one is the strength Giver right so God is now revealing himself Abraham as the Almighty God the strength giver the life Giver just nurse off my promise basically don't fret about it it's going to come to pass how lujah I'm sure that he's revealed himself to you in that way as well don't fret just nurse on the promise keep feeding on the promise it'll keep you strong it'll make you grow hallelujah keep focused on the promise amen hallelujah that's why so there is there now and then now we come to Genesis 18 which we we we read briefly in the Sunday School and now God comes down and flesh and has a meal with Abraham and the Lord appeared unto him and the plains of Mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground okay and then so so there's three men coming but one of them is God and two of the angels that go down and to Sodom right and we see this in Genesis 18 and 22 and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord cuz one of them was the Lord and flesh okay so Abraham knew this was God coming to him because he'd meet him before it wasn't a different God right it was the same God coming in flesh to speak to Abraham saying now is the time of the promise now's the time of the promise where you will receive the promised son hallelujah and that's why it's so incredible Amen with you know in brother Baris ministry we're now here he is and he says now we're we're back in the days of Sodom again amen and there's a promised seed that that's that's been called out waiting for the promised son to come to meet him in the air hallelujah and he said that the last sign that the church will receive major sign will be he God comes down and human flesh and reveals the secrets of the hearts of the people just like in Genesis 18 he says now I'll turn my back hallelujah and that same sign is done that you would see that we're just before the burning of this Gentile world the people already called out Holi are waiting to meet the promised son in the end I'm in Genesis 22 and 8 and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both went of them together so God is revealing himself as Jehovah Jireh the Lord Himself will provide a sacrifice right and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the mouths of the Lord it shall be seen so he had a revelation God will provide himself a sacrifice and that was pointing to these sacrifice Jesus Christ God has provided himself on behalf of your sacrifice hallelujah now as I said in the beginning there with with Genesis 12 it says the Lord called Abraham said get out of the country write that word means means Jehovah now that main seem now in light of what we read in the beginning but now we're going to come to it again says the Lord said unto Moses how shalt thou they'll see what I'll do to Pharaoh for the strong hand shall he let him go and with a strong hand Shelley drive them out of his land and God spake unto Moses said unto him I am the Lord and I appeared unto Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them if you go read the accounts that we just read about Abraham it says in Jehovah spoke to him so does this contradict no it doesn't contradict because part of the name Jehovah part of God's life knows attributes is that he's a deliverer right he's a deliverer Abraham was never delivered right they were never in slavery Isaac Jacob they were never in slavery but now here comes God down and he's telling Moses they never knew me as a deliverer but now I'm going to reveal myself as deliverer right now I'm going to now I'm going to reveal my self in this way so they will now know me by my by the fullness of my name Jehovah right he provided himself a sacrifice he was their banner their healer all different kinds of things but now he is going to reveal himself as Jehovah the deliverer hallelujah so we know God came down and what did he do he delivered his children out of Israel he manifested his name right he manifested the life behind his name in that era right because he delivered them he manifested it they were set free out of Egypt they were no longer slaves hallelujah so God now God has manifested his name and we see it through where God delivers his people but we know that this is not the fullness of the manifestation of his name because Israel never knew about being delivered from sin the blood of bulls and goats only covered right the blood of bulls guys only covered they didn't know anything about the new birth like David you know because David it said the Spirit of God was with him from from when he was anointed by Samuel but he had such a longing you know for for more of God but he couldn't be born again because the blood of Jesus Christ wasn't given right the blood of bulls and goats did not birth a person into the kingdom it did not produce God and flesh like we know now if it did then why did Jesus have to die Jesus had to die to cleanse the people to come and dwell in them amen so now I want to show you here so in the book of Isaiah it says ye o my witnesses saith the Lord of my servant whom I have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after me I even I am the Lord and besides me there is no Savior so God has to clean there's no one else I'm only one there's no salvation outside of me I'm the only Savior so now in order for God to be a savior he had to manifest that salvation right and so season Isaiah seven and four therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel which means God with us right there's a prophecy of God coming to the earth I mean in a body of flesh he also said in Isaiah nine and six he says for unto us a child is born unto us a sudden son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David upon the and upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this hallelujah so now here's a prophecy saying he'll be called Emmanuel he'll be called the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace wonderful counsellor I mean all of these names will be manifested but then when we see and in the new testament because we know in the old testament the name of Jesus was never was never said that he will be called Jesus in the old testament right I mean anyone read the name Jesus in the Old Testament no it's not there but all of these all of what you read about God's attributes of the Old Testament are encapsulated in the name of Jesus Christ we read here in Matthew 1 and 20 but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived of her as of the Holy Ghost and she shall bear forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now hold on you know but I thought his name would be Emmanuel let's just this is be silly a little bit you know but people are so carnal people are so carnal I thought his name should be Emmanuel shouldn't his name be everlasting father the Almighty God the Prince of Peace wonderful counselor isn't that what the Bible says his name should be as this angel falls now because there he's giving the wrong thing he's not giving the wrong name because in all those attributes an official in the name of Jesus because Jesus means Jehovah's salvation right so now Jehovah's salvation is coming to the earth I mean more than a deliverance from slavery but a deliverance from sin and deliverance from a first nature right a deliverance from culture from family ties whatever it is that that holds us back from hobbies and things that we would make idols remember God would cleanse us amen through the name of Jesus Christ right so Jesus was now the manifestation of the fullness of God hallelujah what what he could only manifest in part in the Old Testament he was now manifest in its fullness hallelujah for he shall save it I love it where you know I love this first this is the reason you got to call him Jesus because he shall save his people from their sins only he's gonna manifest that name I mean just like Nabal was a wicked fool Amen Jesus will manifest the deliverance of his people that they shall be saved from their sins Alleluia I mean so the angel wasn't contradicting what what was spoken and Isaiah know it is the interpretation of it Allu you and that's why right and then we read continue on now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which is spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us amen so the name of Jesus Amy represents God being with us as well so now everything that all that God is that's why the name of Jesus is trodden down right that's why it's that's why it's a curse word his glorious name is trodden down because that's what the devil basically says it is it's not worth anything it's a lowly name it's a rubbish name it's not a rubbish name it's the name above all names and because in the name of Jesus we have deliverance we have salvation and then way of healing amen and it's amazing when a people a church world will pray in his name right they'll ask forgiveness in his name but they will not be buried in his name they will not be identified with us in Baptism and that shows that they will not be identified with his word right because if you're really identified with them you will manifest his word you will love his word you won't separate him from his word right but people will be baptized in titles they don't take on the name of Jesus Christ and what do they do at the word they put it to one side but the Bride of Christ I mean takes on his name I'm so glad to be identified with the name of Jesus Christ amen with my with my sacrifice I mean with all the reproach with all the glory whatever is I'm willing to take it upon myself thank upon his name and be identified with him amen and that's shown by taking his word hallelujah taking his whole word and saying that is you Lord Jesus I'll live for that amen amen John 5 and 43 I am coming my father's name and you received me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive how can you believe which receive honor one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from God only do not think that I'll accuse you - the father there is one that accused with you even Moses in whom he trusts so Jesus is saying he comes in his father's name so what's the name of the father it's Jesus right he says I come in my father's name name of her father as Jesus right so there he was manifesting the name of the Father right because here is the Express image of his person so when he saw Jesus God and flesh as Jesus you saw what the great Eternal Spirit was right amen now we read here in revelations 14 and 1 that season I looked at lo a lamb stood on Mount Zion and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his father's name written in their foreheads so saying they're standing with the lamb which is our Lord Jesus and his father's name and their Foyt's what's the name of the Father Jesus right because these 144,000 we're just reading about here I mean they are the Jews that received the same Lord Jesus we know after we go to the wedding supper hallelujah now the name of so it's go let's just keep going x9 and three and as he journeyed this is salt he came near Damascus and suddenly they shined round about him alive from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto Him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom their persecuted it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks ER and he trembling and astonished said Lord what will thou have me to do and the Lord said unto Him arise go into the city and it should be told thee what thou must do now when when the Apostle Paul calls him Lord that word actually means supreme one it means supreme and authority so he wasn't just calling any being Lord he's saying who are you God who are you he said I'll tell you who I am I'm Jesus right because that is that is the name of God does God manifest it he went he became flesh the name of there was Jesus right that's the fullness of God's manifestation and then he went back into pillar fire and his name was still Jesus because it's still Jehovah salvation manifested a many other people now Ephesians 3 and 9 and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Jesus Christ our Lord and whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him where of I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this course I bow my knees and to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named I mean so the whole family him mother's name Jesus Christ Alleluia amen now we'll we'll come to that later why that's significant because well I just drop a little bit in here you are you know we we get older realize we are our parents whether we like it or not what we the the natural life you see your parents living right there their character how they you know respond to things and you say I'll never become like that and then you find you are like that because it's the natural gene it's your DNA it's your makeup you know it's your family spirit the natural spirit you receive through them that's that's what's manifested in you you can't help it right you can't help but whether you like I don't you say I never be like that in you and you find yourself you like that right why it's because it's the life in you manifesting now if that's just natural life how much more the people who are really called by his name right they actually are the family of God right they are not just by association saying I'm a Christian but God says I'll put my name in them I mean they will manifest my redemption they will be like me holy and you begin to find yourself oh I you can't but act like him right because you are part of the family right his life is in you just let the life those and your father is in you I'm in the life of your heavenly Father is in you holy and you're manifesting his life and you can't help it it's there hallelujah amen I'm glad lujah and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the son of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you lo I am with you always even to the end of the world he says amen so it says baptized in one name he doesn't say names for the name of the Father of the son of the Holy Ghost now father is not a name we know there's very elementary but I want to the name of Jesus is supreme right right so father's a title sons a title Holy Ghost is what he is but it's not his name right and he's four now the disciples knew exactly what what Jesus was saying to them they knew who the father was I knew his name then you who who who he was and now we go to Acts chapter 2 and then Peter says repent be baptized everyone you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now notice in the book of Acts here Matthew was standing right there he was in the upper room and he took no exception of of Peter saying baptized the name of Jesus Christ because he knew what Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 is the name of Jesus Christ the one name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ right and people say well I don't need to get baptized the thief on the cross didn't get baptized I say the thief on the cross was the last Old Testament Saint to come in right and if he if he wasn't stuck to that cross he would have been in the upper room and he would have got baptized right so you know I don't know why people look for a way out I just look for a way in amen Oh Lord what's for me I want it all yeah I'm not trying to avoid the thing I mean why would people want to avoid eternal life I tell you only reason as his demon powers upon them and they yield themselves to the devil more than God yes amen but he says there are baptized the name of Jesus Christ because they knew that this was God's and that name is his Redemption and that name is transforming power and that name is healing and their name is restoration and that name is deliverance hallelujah eternal life was given in that name amen everything that God is as manifest in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah and that's why sorry we'll go back here X 3 & 6 then Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give IV in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk amen because now healing was healing was there deliverance was there hallelujah now the Apostles were no one for preaching in the name of Jesus Christ everything I did was everything a word or deed paul says doing the name of Jesus Christ they were known for the name of Jesus right so they they they preached in his name they prayed in his name they lived in his name everything named okay they lifted up the name of Jesus Christ and that is the essential I mean if we and we have been restored to an epistolary the faith of the fathers living still and because we have been restored so is the importance and the magnitude and the significance of the name of Jesus Christ has been restored that's why I say he's not a he's not a second God he's not a junior God right he's not some little errand boy I mean that we command to push around he's not some little doting grandfather or what every people have made him in the world the god of convenience a god of you know I now I need you to help me now I don't need y'all do my own thing you know that's not the God we serve a man but we we serve the Lord God Almighty hallelujah in his name as the Lord Jesus Christ so if they were known for lifting up the name of Jesus Christ so will the bride in the last days because we've been restored back to that faith right and we know he is his word amen x4 and ten be it known unto thee and all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth so Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole and x5 and forty and to him they agreed and when they had called the Apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go did they listen another didn't listen hallelujah then X 8 and 12 and when when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and woman why cuz Philip was preaching the name of Jesus Christ how lujah that he was he was showing the power in that name that's why it's more than just a phrase or we love Jesus you know with Jesus people isn't he wonderful no there's a manifestation of that name right his name as his name has been put in the Bride of Christ just like the father put his name in the Sun right and the Sun manifested the life of Jesus right manifested the life of that name he benefits of Jehovah's salvation because he was Jehovah's salvation right everything he did was deliverance and salvation Redemption gathering his children to himself because it's manifesting the name of Jesus is manifesting Jehovah's salvation and as the as the groom manifested Jehovah's salvation so will the bride I mean but the bride does not does not have we don't have to die for anyone jesus paid it all right Jesus paid it all he delivered everyone who will believe he said everyone free on Calvary he purchased the sin of the world amen he he did all that so he he paid it all but now then the victory comes and lives through us right we're more than conquerors through him that loved us right because where we are manifesting his name to the earth amen I'm glad he paid it all and we just enjoy x4 1 & 3 he says and as they spake in the and they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the Pharisees came unto them being grieved as they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead and they laid hands on them and put them in hold for unto the next day as it was now Eventide howbeit many of them which heard the word believed a number of Mimar about 5,000 and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and an is the high priest and k ephesus and john alexander as many as were of the candidate of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel if we thirst they be examined of the good deed does the impotent been by what means he is made whole I mean they were so he said by what name have you done this by the name of Jesus Christ and the Apostle said there is no other name given under heaven by which men must be safe right so as Isaiah said we read there in Isaiah 43 that there's no God beside me there's no other Savior no not one that's how about that salvation is Menefee is the name of Jesus Christ because Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of than you right so there's no other name no other way that a man must be saved but by the name of Jesus Christ that's how essential it is right hallelujah amen now Philippians two and eight and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father amen so here's the name above all names now that name is in the Bride of Christ right where we are manifesting that name hallelujah so now we read all that because there is no program said this and what is the attraction on the mountain he'd returned home for thus saith the Lord the seven mysteries has been hid in the Bible all these years these denominations and everything God is going to open these seven mysteries to us in the seven seals there was that circle coming up from the earth like a mist forming when it did it went plumb up into the mountain begin to circle on westward from the way it came science found it after a while 30 miles high 25 miles across just exactly in the circle of the pyramid and the other day standing there turned the picture to the right and there's Jesus as he was in the seven churches the white wig on showing supreme deity he's Alpha and Omega he's the first and the last he is the supreme judge of all eternity standing there confirmed the message of this hour and this shall be light about the evening time he says what it's all about as Jesus Christ being made known hallelujah now in Revelation is 3 I've read a whole bunch because I want you to see this in the scripture right I want you to see it because people say no that's not true there's no true it's all in the scripture right I want you to see that the name that God has changed his name down through the seasons and the reason he did that is because every every time he checked he he says now I'm Jehovah I must is because he's expressing a part of himself and all that was down capsulated the name of Jesus Christ right and he that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name right this is the one that overcometh every overcoming promise is applied to every age right so now he says that he that overcometh right over cometh in the age that they live I mean I will write upon him the name of my God because they manifest that Jesus overcame right Jesus overcame it so the bride will overcome right speak so the overcomer in every age is manifesting the power of his name the life that's behind his name amen revelations 2:17 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in that and the stone a new name written that no man knoweth saying he that receive it now a stone as revelation right so that he that overcometh I will give him a revelation amen and a new name written right that you will understand who you really are on him your identity I mean is revealed I mean in a revelation from him hallelujah I mean I'm glad that that is that is how the church is built amen now and gods only provide a place of worship I just got to two quotes that will close he says it ain't Methodist God's name isn't Methodist God's name isn't Pentecostal God's name ain't Baptist God's name isn't Catholic stay out of them doors then see see but in a place where I choose to put my name now there's not another place in the Bible given where God ever put his name only in Jesus Christ for he is the son of God taking the name of God and God's human name there's not another name and given under heaven whereby you must be safe that's what the Apostle said I don't care Methodist Baptist Presbyterian catechisms whatever you want to do only through the name of Jesus Christ where every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to it he being Lord that's how you come in and if you was and if you is just baptized in water like and then deny the word then you're illegitimate your birth wasn't correct you claim that you believe him then and you deny him how could I deny my father how could I deny Charles Brandon being my father a blood test on the door shows at sea uh-huh my action and the vindication of God's Word in my life shows whether I'm a child of God or not now there's God's only place see it the only place that God will receive your sacrifice I don't care how sincere is in Christ and Christ is the word right you say you say well I believed I come and to remember the Bible says you say well the Bible said whatever whosoever believeth that Jesus Christ is the son of God has saved shall be saved it says that but remember it has also written also as written no man shall call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost see you might say he is but he isn't until the Holy Spirit itself which gives life to the word proves it by vindication that you are the son of God then that's the scripture the place that I chose to put my name you shall not worship but any other gate but in the gate I put my name and then I will receive you you're in my family now the family of God obeys the orders of the father of the family and he is the Prince of Peace the mighty God the everlasting father and of his Dominion and reign there shall be no end the government shall be upon his shoulders and he being the governor King Emmanuel first last Prince of Peace the mighty God everlasting father every one of us children obey every word to the order because they're part of him we live in our home like branham's love you live in your home the Joneses like the Joneses live and in the house of God we live by the Word of God and everyone that everyone that proceeds out of the mouth of God and any other fraud we won't listen to him see why because this his life comes unto you right if you love me jesus' keep my commandments it also says if we love Him as Commandments nor grievious right his word is not Grievous to them that love him right because now well why is that because his name his life comes unto you and you can't help being a Jesus person right if you're really surrendered to him and his life is in you you can't help it I mean because you're manifesting the life of your family your real family right not you're not your natural family Amen but you are manifesting Jehovah salvation hallelujah I mean where he is he has manifested himself other people that's why I say no it's it's so it's so vital that we understand we're called by his name because we're manifesting his life right that's why we're that's why we're called by his name not that we just associate ourselves with his name we said no I'm gonna call these people by my name that they will be my family they'll be my bride right and they'll manifest my life hallelujah and then we just turn around say well we can't help but doing it family traits are passed down hallelujah his family traits are passed down I mean we may have different testimony but I'll produce the same kind of life we know God's not a cookie cutter but we'll produce the same kind of life if the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost have produced that kind of life and the Holy Ghost falling today will produce a same kind of life it won't produce a different kind of life I mean we've been restored back to that where the name of Jesus was manifested the name of Jesus was glorified it was manifested in a people hallelujah so it weren't it won't change I think we we have the musicians please there is power in the name of Jesus so once you to understand Jesus conquered every spurt right he conquered every sickness he conquered hell itself and he rose victorious to show that there was nothing above his name right death wasn't above his name sickness wasn't above his name religion wasn't above his name culture wasn't above his name unbelief didn't hinder him nothing hindered the name of Jesus everything was put under his feet right and it is the same thing now that to the name of Jesus everything must bow right sickness must bow unbelief must bow indifference must bow brittleness must bow resentment must bow whatever it is must bow melancholy must bow everything must bow to the name of Jesus Christ everything is under that name hallelujah and that's why if we are called by his name we are call to overcome we will call to overcome all things amen whatever it may be you name an enemy at must bow has been put under his feet I mean we're called by his name that we're called to overcome we're anointed to overcome every enemy overcome every obstacle break through every barrier a me walk out victorious hallelujah I believe it frees this one the name of Jesus is so vital and important they understand if we're called by his name I mean that as he overcame we will overcome through him hallelujah that's why we shouldn't just sit back and say well this is how life is and this is how it's gonna be who said it's gonna be this way who said it's gonna remain this way hallelujah we should just you know don't just put up with the status quo the status quo is called to be changed hallelujah there's people in the world calling himself progressive we're progressive hallelujah that the old order has done away with of our being separate from God and sin reigning over people no we're going to take away the foundation out of that thing you following me hallelujah we're the real left hallelujah like as the lift does away with what's already here and the blood adji the name of Jesus Christ is here to be manifested the all old way has done away with and when you creations in him amen I'm so glad it's oh well let's just stand shall we I want to praise the Lord a little but I'll Lou you I'm
