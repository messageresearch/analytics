the service your hands and just thank you so much what you've done for us in Jesus name Amen amen praise the Lord god bless you all this evening how's everyone doing on a Wednesday good it's good praise a little I'm just well you're standing I'm just going to read a few scriptures and I actually don't know where this first scripture was from I didn't copy that check the I know it's a psalm but I didn't copy the exact exact chapter but it's alright give me one second I'll find it so I'm 82 verse 1 that's what we're gonna read tonight we're gonna read the whole chapter there so I'm 82 verse 1 says God standeth and the congregation of the mighty he judges among the gods how long will you judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked Selah defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needy deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked they know not neither will they understand they walk on and darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course I have said Ye are gods and all of you are children of the Most High but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes arise O God judge the earth for thou show and hear all nations and I've got one more scripture which is mark 11 chapter 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith Amy we'll just pray again Lord we just pray bless your word this evening thank you for lord and we just come at the service here in Jesus name Amen praise Lord God bless you you can take your seats this evening now girls brother Isaac has got to give you a kind of like a little apology I don't have slides tonight I know when I was a little guy I so loved slights because when I couldn't understand what was being said I could look at the pictures yeah and that's why that's why I do them for it like young little guys and girls so they can look at the pictures we need that know what I'm talking about but tonight there's no pictures but we'll try and paint a picture okay I know I owe you though okay I know that's why they were sitting up the front you must imagine how bad I feel right now I owe you girls I'll give you some lollies - okay yeah yeah I do enjoy doing slides because I can kind of present the idea and in a an understandable fashion and it helps me to present the idea but this one is not quite like that that I'm going to do this evening it's going to be slightly different cuz I don't have any slides and I can't really note up this sermon if I follow my notes I'll go off track right so I don't really want to use too many notes because I I think the Lord's given it to me enough that I don't need to go and go to my notes because that's a it's a thought that has spoken to my heart and I trust it a bit would be a blessing to you and incidentally enough I think this may be the first or the second sermon that brother ben has been in that I've preached it is that right and five or six years second one praise the Lord now the thought that I've got to speak on this evening is a very powerful thought that will change your life who wants their life changed okay the thought this evening is ye are gods and some near it said I have said Ye are gods ye are gods now a lot of the times I speak about the Lord and what he's done for us and who he is but tonight's going to be slightly different because I'm just going to talk about who we are for a night if I can all right that doesn't take away from who the Lord is but you know we have quite a big role to play in humanity as well and this whole operation man has a very very powerful part that they play and punch yourself you're a god see it's quite a powerful statement to make and yet that's there's so much truth to it there's no other creature like man what other creature on this earth that God gives Dominion say you have dominion over everything he doesn't say to the animals when he made the finest animal he could like a lion you'll have Dominion you'll rule your reign but he said to man you'll have dominion how many times you walk up to a wild animal and it runs away this kid of us God we are actually gods we are very very powerful creatures never under miss underestimate who you are Satan knows exactly who we are he knows who we are and it says job to try and make us not realize who we are because we are gods right that's a powerful statement to make I know but that's the truth of it now I'm just going to start speaking about this idea for a minute and being with me we have so much power within us to create whatever we want jesus said if you say to this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and don't doubt whatever you say will happen the mountain will move and be cast into the sea that's a lot of power that's a lot of authority given to a human being he didn't say a few if you believe that I am Christ you'll do that and I know he said a few and that's anybody on this whole entire world if you believe and if you say that this mountain be moved there were no conditions placed on that anybody whether they believe the Lord is God Almighty or not has that power to do that anybody it's not restricted to a Christian let's keep this all in perspective here he didn't put he didn't put a limitation on who had the ability to do that God's made us very very powerful creatures very powerful so powerful the Satan wants to use us you know the thing about it is Satan doesn't have as much power as what we have that's why he hates us so much and that's why he actually has to use means creative power to do things she can't do it himself now this concept of faith right faith faith can be head outside of Christianity right faith the faith it's not as not a Christian thing as such it's a that's a human it's something that's been given to the human being to create the sort of world you want to live in right you say well that's quite that's quite big faith without works is dead you know their statement right faithful that works is dead if you want to achieve something great in this world if you want your on a player you're a soccer player you want to get to the heights of stardom and the soccer world and get paid millions of dollars do you know what you really need to get there the first thing you need faith you need to see what you want in front of you and then you need to believe that no you don't not Christianity this is just how it works you never met someone that got to the top the thought I didn't think I could do it and I never tried to do it they believe it they see this up there and they say that's what I want to be they believe it right they believe and then what do they now do they act on their faith they said acting faithful that works is dead they act on it they start training and they heap this vision in front of them that's what I want to be yeah and if they believe it enough you might think this is strange but it's not this is not strange if they believe it enough they will create that world in front of them they're created in front of them but they will make that happen that the order of the world will come under subjection to the God but they're of God it'll come under subjection to that and it will start to happen as they believe it if they believe it enough place the plan abandoned one of the guys we were not Christian and one of the guys said to me if you want to get anywhere another singer in a band he said what I was told by another singer that was a famous New Zealand singer he said the first thing you've got to do is believe in yourself you must believe in yourself believe in yourself and it will happen he couldn't stress it to me enough believe in yourself because why we are gods we have this creative power within us to achieve anything we want to achieve anything in anything at all you're doing it he wants to do something you have the ability and you to create whatever you want you have the ability within you to create whatever sort of a world you want in front of you anything at all you have the ability to do that never limit who you are right never now people get know people do not get anywhere except they have faith we know some builders brother Andean ideas one guy called Mike Friday right and there's another guy called I've forgotten his name because he's kind of a nobody but they were both at the same place at one point in time but Mike Friday thought you know what I can do better than this I believe I can do this the other guy said hmm I don't think I can do that so they parted ways Brent what's his name you know who knows him nobody because he didn't believe he didn't have a vision in front of him to believe anything he's now a nobody but who's heard of Mike Friday you seen a Friday home sign around somewhere that's Mike Friday about my age friend of ours he believed and he started acting on it and I'll tell you something that happened the world started conforming to what he wanted because he is a God he's a God we're all God's we have this creative power within us to do anything Satan knows that - he knows it he knows that we have this creative power and he wants access to it I wanna tell you a little he doesn't have it think about it he doesn't have it he doesn't have creative power he can't create anything he's upset he can't create he needs man to create with the godlike powers to achieve his purpose that's what he needs that's all he doesn't have access to this status that we have now you know what he tells his people right if you understood from you know what he tells you you don't know what it tells you you can believe in yourself you can if you're gonna do what he says he'll tell you believe in yourself you can why because you're doing what he wants you to do he's not going to discourage you is he not going to discourage you because he wants you to do what he wants what he wants you to do so he's got to encourage you you can do this you can't be the best soccer player the river us are you gonna stop believing it because he wants you to become an idol that other people will follow you and go down that road he's looking for people with faith Satan's looking for people with faith when he sees someone with faith he wants access to that faith to achieve his purpose because he can't do it himself think about it that's what he wants to do that's what he wants to do that's true right okay you said of Eminem the reps there what's the song he sings about you only get one shot to do this just do it you've got a make or break do it now it's encouraging saying you can do this you guys can be like me believe it you'll be like me see Satan encourages people he uses their faith because he knows we can if we so desire something we as gods can create it in front of us we can create any world we want to we control life this world order that you look at you know how you look forward at life and you look out at it who controls there we do we control it the person with the most faith to believe controls the world they control it we control it all Satan just uses man to control it he just gets them believing something and acting on it who said of Russell Crowe the actor I think huge might even be from here is he from Wellington I think he is right do you know when he was 12 13 14 15 years old you know what he said one day I'm gonna win an Academy Award I'm gonna win an Academy Award do you know what he did when he got older yeah what what did he win again an Academy Award roles would have been created in front of him to achieve it wasn't chance it wasn't luck good movies were created and that gravitated towards him because he believed it because hit what because what is he he's a god yeah God's like this that's who the human being is we're a God Satan use that faith he had to to achieve his purpose and him right this is how this thing works this is how this whole thing works now their least it's least kind of bring it around into some a different type of perspective now I'm going to talk about this for a while so I can stand my thought right what I want to talk about Satan does not he does not have the ability to advance past you and I right explain what I mean by that right because I want to now this thought down then I want to show you I want to show you he's actually a bluff when you understand this he's a complete bluff right right let's go on a different seaquarius talk about light right light light you even know what light is right and darkness you know dark misses right darkness and a scientific term doesn't actually exist it only exists in the absence of light right hold that thought I want to go back to something else because I want to I've got to nail this I want to get this thought out so you understand it because if we understand who we are we're gonna change the world we're going to change the world we got to make the broad anything we want it to be there's a catch to it right because we're sons and daughters of God so we want to find that well right right don't worry I'm getting I'm gonna get to that we're not just going to do anything we want I wanna get to that right Satan's main objective now he encourages his people do you know what his main objective that he does to you he tells you you can't he knows you can he knows you can you know what he tells the believer now we talk about believers now do you know what he tells you what does he tell you impo you can't you can't you can't that's what he tells you if you wanna go and do anything for the Lord move on him in any way he's gonna tell you you can't if you're a non-believer doing this well he'll tell you you can but if you're a believer a Christian he knows you can he knows it but he's going to tell you that you can't that's because he knows the only way he can stop you from doing something is by making you think you can't be honest that he knows you can he knows you can do anything you want to do but he's got to try and trick you to thinking that you can't one of the ways he does debtor's with fear think about this fear fear fear of doing something fear of stepping out why because this may happen never ever never happen who puts those there you're a god you can create anything you want that won't happen because I think that's what happened that won't happen but Satan will tell you know it will happen that way why because he knows if you if you actually step forward and believe that it will happen that way that you want it to happen and he knows he cannot stop you at all from doing it no no way at all absolutely no way at all he doesn't have the ability because this go back to light and darkness darkness doesn't have the ability to push forward think about it and that's not ability to push forward nothing darkness is only where light is where there's light is gone then darkness can't persist the ground that light head but it doesn't have the ability to push on to the ground that light possesses whatsoever you understand and he knows it he knows it he knows he doesn't have the ability to overtake the believer on any front whatsoever he knows it what he gets has to get you and I to do is to pull back by fear because he knows when you pull back he possesses it that's the only ability he has to find us is to make you pull back and anything at all any promise that's the only way that he can actually then he can one is by you pulling back because that's darkness that's why this church is successful because love and light are similar hate is just the absence of love but I cannot possess it cannot move forward you cannot that's my fellowship when it's love it cannot be overtaken can't there's no there's no ability hate cannot possess hate does not have the ability to put forward he has to get you to hate yes get you critical because when you get like that you don't love and you pull back when you pull back he possesses it but he knows he cannot beat you on a head-on fight he's a liability not no ability he's got it he has to trick you to thinking you have to pull back in terms of love he's gonna try and get you thinking critical in it cuz he knows when I get like that you'll pull back then I'll possess it but if you don't think like that yeah you can stand there all day long and he can't do nothing nothing nothing that's why this is why he's a but if you're a program prank this is not just uh let's be good we're to use he's bluffing he knows it he knows he's bluffing but a big dick you to believe it thinking scared thinking you're pulling back he once but he knows all of us all of us perhaps all of us like Goliath he was bluffing any one of those children versa I could have overtaking life anyone if they believed it they didn't Goliath and they're the ability to push forward they here he was no way their army was gonna win no way but the men believed he would yeah so they all stood there because they believed they couldn't do it yeah that's the only thing to stop them what was the difference with David what was the difference he believed so hang on hang on hang on who's this who is this he believed us he believed it and what he believed was created in front of him because light possesses darkness doesn't possess and only inhibits placement there's no light tough light choosers think about this if you chose if you choose to move forward at all you'll possess anything you want any promises but if you choose it let me choose it if you're a son of God and you choose it footsteps are positioned so you take one step forward where's the darkness gonna go it's gotta flee flee it cannot stay on the ground that light comes on that's the way this whole thing works Satan is a complete and utter Bluff complete Bluff he wants to try and trick us to thinking we can't do it yeah we can't move forward we can't possess promises he uses fear when you think about your future you know I get fearful put that there please telling you to be fearful if you want to make some sort of change you feel to make a change if you wants to make a change but they get scared what will that be a do it's not you yeah hang on you're a god you can have anything you want if you feel to go out a certain way you can have anything you want anything you want I got to a point once we I guess I can say when I used to get these fearful thoughts about my future I used to think hang on what's the worst that could happen to be when I boil it all down I could die that's not so bad after all the worst officers not their bad then why fear why fear what I'm bracelet run up bring it on bring it on it'll be whatever I create what do I have to fear fear cripples faith Satan knows if you have faith and walk forward you'll beat him on every front and he knows it he knows it now now as a Christian as a human we've got this power within us godlike powers right we're creative beings we create things right Satan's Satan loves to get his hands on the human and have them create his purpose but now the believer when the Lord gets hold of us we still have a role to play in achieving his purpose what Caleb he had a role to play which was believe it nekton it that was the will of God was that they put that the children of Israel possessed the promised land Caleb the children of Israel his job was just to believe it and walk forward and every enemy that came before them had to go what a team stop because there's they were there they started seeing all these things all the Giants and they and the devil started speaking in him you can't take these guys you can't take it you can't take it he knew they could he knew they could wipe the whole place out in a week he knew it but he had to Bluff he had to Bluff Satan's got no power he doesn't we're not when I understood the story I realized he's got no power he's got no power he's so disappointed he's got no power he's a bluff I thought to myself you know what would I ever be scared he's a bluff now when a son of God then you start walking in the will of God anything you want anything the Lord lays on your heart yeah you you can do you can have any promise you can have anything anything at all Jesus when He healed the the man that was second he said your sins be forgiven you basically to the Pharisees see to him who do you think you are saying his sins are forgiven he said what's easier to say your sins were forgiven all stand up and walk here just stand up he was a Creator God you want to limit you we have this creative power within us to create the will of God for our lives we have that power Satan knows it and he wants to blow us out of it but he knows that if we believe it and we act on it he's going to be defeated at every single turn he knows it so when we find the will of God when we find a will of God for our life have you ever felt to do something and then you sort of pull back you've done that that thing may have been the will of God for you but fear made you pull back it may have been the will of God for your life but all this fear will come to say maybe you can you know you know no no you can't do that what if it doesn't work what if you this happens if you don't get well what if that job doesn't work out what if when you move this not like what you thought it would be all those thoughts that's for you and then you can not act on it let me taste something I don't think like that anymore when you realize he's a bluff you go okay well this is now changes the game somewhat they changes the game if I feel to do anything for the Lord or I want any promise it's up to me I can just go and walk out and take it and if I believe it enough I'll have it then I start thinking for myself if that's the case right pinch yourself again you just punched baya t you punched a person that has the ability to change the world you might think that's pretty big well no no what's easier to say okay I'm gonna create this all that what does it matter we can do a lot more things than what we think we can do Satan's job is to try and Bluff us to thinking we can and make us fearful hope you know when maybe you might say this right I'm gonna say I asked him if I could he said do you have to I say yes it's not bad right so so we got a fellowship here and rather being sister Christine you know they've they put their heart and soul into that the church and they labor and they they you know they brother Ben works all day sister Christine has to go and do but it work to make ends meet and me and they have people over during the week and they have the services and there's oh they get quite stressed right it's quite a strenuous physically and mentally and spiritually it's quite draining what they do right so now what's this new concept of hate where actually I've got this we've got a power than us right I look at the situation I think I don't think I really like the situation I think hmm I really like this and I think you know I would prefer if rather been at least sister Christine wouldn't have to work and I prefer brother Ben didn't have to either right so I think I think that's a good idea right now this is putting this thing in action era I think that's a good idea when you do this once we're in here once why not get it done you know what why just do it half a quarter Elijah was sick he was almost going to die and I think it was joash wanted deliverance from the rest from the Syrians and Elijah said pick up your bow and arrow and shoot it up and he held his hands and he said shoot an arrow out the window he shot an arrow out the window and then Elijah said Behold the area of the deliverance of the Lord and Elijah said to the king of Israel strike the arrows on the ground and by that you'll defeat the armies of the earth of the Syrians and he struck the ground three times then he stopped and he'll I sure was angry with him he said you should have smoked the ground six or seven times then you would have driven the Assyrians way back but you've only struck it three times right how many times you want to strike I'm starting to think that's right back to our story I look at the situation I think actually this is not a good situation I would rather rather bend enough to work at all he could give us life to ministry because why do we want us brain on all this look eat this wheeze and please all right for goodness sake our wheeze so here's the man with the call of God on his life - to labor in the word of God and during the week he's testing wheeze and his mind has taken up with testing other people's wheeze hey I feel like you know you get the arrow defeating hang on hang on hang on he doesn't have to test wheeze during the week if we so desire that he doesn't then he doesn't have to if we want that and we can have it we can have it we can have it if we want it if we don't want to go and possess it he'll keep testing wheeze during the week and be tired and try and labor and all that during all this but if we want it if we desire it because now this is a fight of faith right and we're pushing forward if we want it we can say actually no I don't want you testing wheeze during the week I want you to do now we think about there what it would cost now I can say this right so I think for myself and we have a talk with brother handy and few of us and we think mm-hmm we don't like the situation how much is it gonna cost to have him I don't talk about as much but I'm just saying this to give an example of things right how much is it gonna cost to but I have to have him not have to work what's it gonna cost how much per month scientists are not actually on a very high wage believe it or not that's Thames Cafe workers your humble tradesman gets paid more than a scientist right but how much is it going to cost we think that much okay the in its how much we're gonna end up giving because that's what it takes let's do this now you know who knows right Andy he's always up for a fight of faith if you ever say let's claim this he's right there he's right you haven't finished your sentence yet and he's running ahead okay have you ever desire to do anything radical for the Lord and you want a buddy go see Andy he'll be doing it while you're still thinking about it but I don't care how it's gonna happen but but I think to myself then if that's what we want then let's do this let's do it what happen is we desire it then he doesn't have to do that during the week during the week he can be he can be laboring and he can be giving things and working in the work of the Lord and spending instead of that much time because we in that much time in the kingdom of God will be pushed forward to me that's a win-win situation for him for us for everyone on thinking okay then let's do this right now now I can say this but my faith we halfway there every months we're just pushing towards it we're halfway there because we believe it and things are going to happen the way we want them to because we believe it now we could just sit back and not do anything but we have the ability to create this thing we can create that if that's what we desire we have the ability to create it Satan knows it and all the time is gonna be trying to bluff us you can't do it what if it doesn't work this is it and it'll work it's gonna work so he and I don't really get on Satan and we always had disagreements all the time we disagree but who believes that can happen now just to get because this is what we're talking about you know I think okay then I'm gonna act and faith only kept in faith and faith and faith I'm gonna start striking the ground these arrows I'm not just gonna stop it like or maybe two days a week you can have off no we want the whole week off we're gonna start striking we get one shot at this people we get one shot at this this is our one shot we get this is what we get we can either sit back and fear well we can possess anything we want to possess we get one chance it's up to us how that chance turns out it's actually up to us when you submit your life to the Lord and find his will it's up to you to go and do it it's up to you there was a brother I forget his name but you might know the story there was a I think your tongues and interpretations and and he said move from here over to a certain place and in another lady spoke afterwards indeed everything will fall into place nothing happened and he waited and waited and waited waited and waited for everything to fall in place and then maybe a year later he said well why did this happen that way and he said I didn't tell her to save it she said that you got taught to move you should have just started selling up do whatever you got to do do whatever you got to do when we came here we had nothing I wasn't Bibbit we had nothing no house to live no job no nothing I say miss Shannon earlier today we were talking about when we moved to Wellington we had five children and nothing nothing you guys moved with stuff me we moving those stuff oh we had a bit of stuff but nothing right no job had no job no way to live really no nothing within eight months we had God somehow we had a business that I couldn't afford we bought it we had awesome house out in the country with Christian landlords that were there and we had a great fellowship but that was because we believed it and we decided we're going to walk into it see we could have held back and said Armour but what if it doesn't work out that's what we all do don't do that anymore don't do it you don't have to do it like that if you can't believe if you feel any sort of inkling to do something for the Lord or anything any promise you want to possess if you can't believe it you can have it if you've got children you want them serving the Lord if you believe it you can have it if you believe it you can have it he knows by the quadrate digs you know there's a time when he was walking around probably his pants halfway down his backside listen to rap music thinking he was one of the boys and nobody saw him anything but you know he saw something in him his mother she said I don't believe that it's not Quadra he's not going to be like that he's the son of God he's gonna be a believer and she believed it let's not homelessness him here the image that I have of him is what he's going to be because I believe it do you know what he had to do conform to the image that she had believe that's what he had to do he didn't know what was changing him but it was faith was changing him because somebody believed if she didn't believe who knows what might happen this is how it works friends we are gods we have creative power to achieve and do anything and when we know that will of God in our life we will see the promises we have power to it to attain anything we want don't be fearful I'll say this thing I'm going to close okay this is going on the video but that's all right I wrote a song called I will not fear well hosting Kempe me and Jesus Christ I'll always have the victory this is my hour this is my fight I will be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might I'll put forth my sword in the name of the Lord my bow will not turn back my sword will not return empty I'm a mighty warrior fearless in battle moving forward in the name of the Lord and I have seen from a line of kings and I'll reign for eternity I've got this the Lord gave me this I'm gonna call it and a natural terms a crazy idea to make the movie on the life of brother venom that's a crazy idea I don't know what a camera was and I got this thought but I but something clicked and I thought yep that's what I'm gonna do it alone see for me to do that let's do it released that released that mmm okay they still film course yeah they're a film course for a year five children four children learn have it okay now can kind of figure out how movies work oh this is interesting just stop doing it start possessing it and it actually comes together in front of you need about four million dollars boy what's what's harder to say what's harder to say it's four million dollars hard no it's not hard it's not they're not hard can be created it's not hard Satan will tell you you can't you can't you can't lift as they were saying actually the Lord taught me to therefore I can I'm a mighty warrior fearless in battle therefore I can I'm going to and he hates it he hates it when you realize you can cuz every step you take forty has to step back because darkness cannot possess darkness has to move backwards and there's nothing he can do and in this fellowship of this love he cannot take any run in this fellowship as his love to because hate does can't possess I'm gonna close this here don't forget this right don't just live an ordinary life don't live an ordinary life why don't just live and get a house and get a job and then go to church on a Sunday and then die don't just do that don't waste all your godlike power to sit back and be fearful don't do it don't do it don't you have the ability to do anything you want to do anything at all no matter how big it is you can do it if the Lord if it's on your heart you can do it don't fear don't fear don't fear whatsoever don't do ordinary because you think that's what you've got to do cuz you're fearful don't do that don't just believe this much don't just strike the ground three times strike a hundred keep striking keep going just go don't fear you can have anything you want let's not sit back and just do what Satan wants us to do which is sit back let's push forward anything you want anybody and it's not restricted to old or young or being in the mists of teen years newbie whatever it's the human being that believes God anyone no matter what stage of life you're at wash up no wash up broken family no broken family who cares it didn't come down to any of that your status hell right now it'll pan out whew that didn't matter what matters if you believe if you can't believe you can speak it and create it anything you want don't doubt the promises of God every step you take forward Satan will flee hesti this is how this thing works we are God's let's surrender all our godlike power to him and then anything he tells us we go and do it and we become his workers on the earth to to possess the gates of our enemy to possess as gates anything at all let's move forward and any thing the Lord has for your life any promise there as let's move forward amen good thing I'm not doing any vocal recording anytime soon we're gonna work with some bit standard sing this evening we're just sing one of

strange it's not quite the way it's supposed to be what I understood this I thought Satan is an absolute Bluff the only power that he has is fear the only way he did one is while making you and I think we can't but the only ability because he doesn't have they make movies about the forces of God meter and look so the forces of evil can push forward that's the program people's minds are on they get scared of the enemy I cannot push forward he doesn't have he doesn't have any power to push forward Lord of the Rings stuff good guy bad guy that doesn't happen by this it's not how this thing works but we get snared for because we think you can't push we can't think about what power does he have when you think about it what power does he have when I understood he has nothing he has nothing
