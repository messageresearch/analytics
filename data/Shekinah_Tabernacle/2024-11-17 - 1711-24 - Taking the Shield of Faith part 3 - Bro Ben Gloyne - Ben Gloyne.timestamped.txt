[2:57] what we are when we serve the Lord he he
[2:59] builds us and makes us everything that
[3:00] we can be you know Christians are such
[3:02] happy wholesome people you know it's
[3:04] it's it's such a disappointing thing to
[3:06] see to see somebody a life that Satan's
[3:09] just ruined and and they're they're just
[3:12] not what they should be it's just a it's
[3:13] a wreck it's the the way their

[3:17] you know just what's in them is is he's
[3:19] just hollowed them out to be nothing you
[3:20] know but I'm so glad we can serve the
[3:22] Lord and although we might go through
[3:24] things that are sometimes quite hard you
[3:27] know they they when when we get molded
[3:28] and made it's it's not easy you know
[3:32] like when you have to chip something
[3:33] away from a when you got to work on a
[3:36] certain object sometimes it takes a bit
[3:39] of extra effort to change something you
[3:42] know like you got to chip something off
[3:43] you got to get a Big Tool and smash it
[3:45] or cut something and sometimes we go
[3:48] through that in the Lord but it's always
[3:49] to make us better you know at the time
[3:51] it's like man what's happening to me wow
[3:53] but you know in the Lord we always come
[3:55] out better cuz he's molding and making

[34:50] let's take our Bibles this morning we're
[34:51] going to go to uh Ephesians chapter 6 uh
[34:55] once
[34:56] again and um it's going to continue on
[34:59] in this in this thought here so I just
[35:02] trying to get used to being up here with
[35:04] these things
[35:05] and trying to run through
[35:08] things oh okay this will be interesting
[35:11] because I can't see what I'm seeing up
[35:12] there what you're seeing so anyway we'll
[35:15] see how we go but I guess if I can see
[35:17] it here I you can see it there okay
[35:19] we're all good amen so Ephesians uh
[35:22] chapter 6 and verse 10 here says finally
[35:25] my brethren be strong in the Lord and
[35:27] the power of His might put on the whole
[35:28] armor of God that ye may be able to
[35:31] stand against the Ws of the devil for we
[35:33] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[35:35] against principalities against Powers
[35:37] against rulers of the darkness of this
[35:38] world against spiritual wickedness in
[35:41] high places wherefore take unto you the
[35:43] whole armor of God that you may be able
[35:45] to withstand in the evil day now this is
[35:48] the evil day right and having done all
[35:50] to stand stand therefore having your
[35:53] loins GT about with truth and having on
[35:55] the breastplate of righteousness and and
[35:57] your feet shod with the preparation of
[35:59] the gospel of peace above all taking the
[36:01] shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be
[36:03] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[36:06] the wicked and take the helmet of
[36:07] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[36:09] which is the word of God praying always
[36:11] with all prayer and supplication in the
[36:14] spirit watching there unto with all
[36:15] perseverance and supplication for All
[36:17] Saints so I'm going to continue speaking
[36:19] about taking the shield of faith above
[36:21] all taking the shield of Faith amen
[36:23] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[36:24] this morning amen let's dedicate Our
[36:26] Lives to uh to the one we love almighty
[36:29] God truly Lord thank you that you have
[36:31] reserved for us a place in your great
[36:33] land we look forward to walking in that
[36:35] land lord seeing you as you are being
[36:37] with you father and we want to thank you
[36:38] also dear God that while we are here
[36:41] Lord your spirit is Among Us dear God
[36:43] that we're not here alone in this Walk
[36:44] we're not uh just following some nice
[36:47] idea but Lord we're following the
[36:48] revelation of your word and we thank you
[36:50] for that and we want to pray this
[36:52] morning Lord that you'd just come and
[36:53] take complete control father we come to
[36:55] worship you in spirit and in truth
[36:57] father so I pray you just come and Lord
[36:59] we surrender Our Lives into your hands
[37:01] may you cleanse Us by your blood forgive
[37:02] us all of our sins and our wrongs Lord
[37:04] all evil negative thinking as well
[37:06] father take it from us Lord be glorified
[37:09] father may we have a mount
[37:10] Transfiguration experienced when we see
[37:12] you glorified father in the name of
[37:14] Jesus Christ granted be with those who
[37:15] couldn't be here today as well in Jesus
[37:18] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[37:21] friends you can have your seats this
[37:22] morning so I want to continue this
[37:24] thought about taking above all taking
[37:26] the shield of faith now if you turn with
[37:28] me we're just going to go into a
[37:30] different kind of a a a section a bit
[37:33] but the Apostle Paul would would speak
[37:35] about about how we have this Earthly you
[37:38] know though this Earthly Tabernacle of
[37:40] this house were dissolved this is 2
[37:41] Corinthians 5 he says we have a building
[37:43] of God a house not made with hands
[37:46] Eternal in the heavens for in this we
[37:48] groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed
[37:50] upon with our house which is from Heaven
[37:53] if so that being clothed we shall not be
[37:55] found naked for we that are in the
[37:57] Tabernacle do Gran being burdened not
[38:00] that we would be unclothed but clothed
[38:02] upon that mortality might be swallowed
[38:04] up of life now he that wrought us for
[38:07] the selfsame as God who also hath given
[38:10] unto us the earnest of the spirit
[38:12] therefore we are always confident
[38:14] knowing that whilst we're we are at home
[38:16] in the body we are absent from the Lord
[38:19] for we walk by faith and not by sight
[38:21] now we we speak about the shield of
[38:23] faith we know we've been going over how
[38:25] you can you know quench the fiery darts
[38:27] the by by by agreeing with the
[38:29] revelation of the word of God above your
[38:31] feelings or above the the the vibe the
[38:34] feeling you know that's being projected
[38:35] upon you and but then if you get hit by
[38:38] a doubt is because you agree with that
[38:39] doubt or that thought above what the
[38:41] revelation of God says now I was
[38:43] thinking about shields where Shields we
[38:45] think of just a defensive thing but I
[38:47] want to say today that the shield a
[38:49] shield is is actually a weapon to use in
[38:51] your hand I it's more than just
[38:52] something to quench fiery darts to
[38:54] protect yourself but you can use a
[38:55] shield to attack someone with amen where
[38:58] you can knock someone down you can knock
[38:59] the weapon out of their hand with that
[39:01] shield and so I want to say that this
[39:03] The Shield of faith we are walking by
[39:05] The Shield of faith I mean we're walking
[39:07] by this Revelation this morning that's
[39:09] why the Apostle Paul would say we walk
[39:10] by faith and not by sight see we don't
[39:13] walk as other men walk amen as as Paul
[39:16] would say in 1 Corinthians 3 he says for
[39:18] ye are yet carnal for with there is for
[39:21] whereas is there among you envyings and
[39:23] strife and divisions are you not carnal
[39:25] and walk as men so if there's strife and
[39:28] envying and divisions you're walking as
[39:30] a man but you're just just carnal men
[39:32] but we're not built to walk as a carnal
[39:33] people anymore once upon a time we did
[39:36] when we when we were without God we
[39:38] walked carnally right but then God rich
[39:40] in Mercy when he reached down his hand
[39:42] for you transformed your life revealed
[39:44] himself to you you're not called to walk
[39:46] by your five senses anymore but you're
[39:48] called to walk by the revelation of the
[39:50] word amen so we got to understand that
[39:54] we the five senses that we so enjoy are
[39:57] not made to contact Heaven that's right
[40:00] they're not made your eyes weren't made
[40:02] to contact God your touch your smell
[40:04] your taste your hearing all those five
[40:06] senses are not made to contact God but
[40:09] yet we rely on them so much for this
[40:11] Earthly Journey but I think if we rely
[40:13] on the shield of Faith a lot more than
[40:15] our five senses we'll have a different
[40:17] kind of a journey amen because our five
[40:20] senses will declare a lot of things to
[40:21] us and not and most of them are actually
[40:23] wrong this is the era of fake news false
[40:26] news manipulated images AI made things
[40:30] you you know it's even down now to
[40:31] people create uh you know false videos
[40:34] of people doing acts and things you know
[40:36] there's you know there's um what do you
[40:38] call it revenge porn and deep fakes and
[40:40] all these kind of evil things Revenge
[40:41] you know videos that people make of
[40:43] people they take images of people they
[40:45] put on other people's bodies and say
[40:46] that was the person it can look very
[40:48] real it can look like it's that person
[40:50] but it's not that person at all what is
[40:52] it but if you look at that thing I pray
[40:54] none of us you ever do but if you look
[40:55] at those things you'll think that's that
[40:57] person but it's not it's a False Image
[41:00] right and your your eyes are lyed to you
[41:03] by that thing so it's listen we we live
[41:05] in an age of manipulation and the devil
[41:08] wants to manipulate your spirit
[41:09] manipulate control you bring you down
[41:11] but God doesn't want us to walk by the
[41:13] five senses he wants us to walk by faith
[41:16] by Revelation amen and and we are living
[41:18] in an age where there's a people upon
[41:20] the Earth that can walk by Revelation
[41:22] now don't shut down on me this morning
[41:23] this is very important because the devil
[41:25] is not dumb he's very very meticulous
[41:28] he's very methodical and he and he's
[41:30] planned he's planned his attack he knows
[41:32] how to get you amen but the revelation
[41:34] of the word defeats him any place
[41:36] anytime anywhere amen so you can either
[41:38] be a slave to sin or you can be
[41:39] victorious over sin it's your choice
[41:42] amen so we want to we want to realize
[41:44] that that faith is made to contact God
[41:47] not our five senses amen so this faith
[41:49] that we walk by is made to contact God
[41:51] now who wants to contact God I believe
[41:54] that's why we're here this morning we
[41:55] want to contact God that's why we open
[41:57] the Bible we want to contact God that's
[41:59] why we listen to the message we want to
[42:00] contact God that's why we pray cuz we
[42:02] want to contact God Amen so we got to
[42:05] walk we but we must walk by
[42:08] Revelation amen because if you walk by
[42:10] Revelation you won't be caught up in the
[42:12] five
[42:13] senses Joseph had an incredible
[42:16] journey that's very easy to gloss over
[42:19] the hardships of his life you know we
[42:21] read he was put into prison he sold as a
[42:23] slave you know how his brothers hated
[42:25] him they actually wanted to kill him
[42:27] we it's very easy to kind of gloss over
[42:30] the the the feelings that that would
[42:32] have you know projected and felt imagine
[42:37] imagine walking into a house sitting at
[42:38] the dinner table your brothers hate you
[42:41] that's not a nice house to be in you
[42:42] don't really there's a feeling you don't
[42:44] feel welcome your father loves you but
[42:46] your your siblings that really your own
[42:48] flesh and blood hate you see they were
[42:51] firing a lot of fiery DTS and sure
[42:53] Joseph you know we all got to mature
[42:55] we're all got to grow but Joseph was
[42:57] living by a prophecy because he had two
[42:59] dreams where one day his family will bow
[43:01] down before him isn't that right I know
[43:03] I'm just kind of you know going through
[43:05] these things quickly but you see so his
[43:07] life turned into a faith walk his life
[43:10] turned into a faith walk he was walking
[43:12] by that Shield of Faith now you see you
[43:15] see many things he did not understand in
[43:17] this walk I'm just trying to catch up to
[43:20] where I am to make sure I'm oh if I miss
[43:22] it I miss it hey God will give it right
[43:24] but you see now his his his Earthly
[43:28] Journey many things he did not
[43:29] understand he did not understand why he
[43:32] was um you know he's down in Egypt fully
[43:36] he sure didn't understand why you know
[43:38] um you know that lie was told on him by
[43:40] poter his wife then he's in prison all
[43:42] these things are very hard things that
[43:43] he had to go through but he was walking
[43:45] by faith because those two dreams I know
[43:47] I've said it before but I pray it grips
[43:49] us just two dreams gripped his life and
[43:52] his whole life was now governed by those
[43:54] two dreams he didn't know how it was
[43:56] going to be fulfilled didn't know when
[43:57] it was going to be fulfilled but he was
[43:58] so gripped this is going to happen one
[44:00] day how's it going to happen I don't
[44:02] know but God's declared it's going to
[44:04] happen and if it's going to happen it's
[44:05] going to happen that Revelation came
[44:07] from God and he walked by that faith of
[44:09] those two dreams his whole life and then
[44:11] finally he came to this position yeah
[44:14] amen now you think about these
[44:16] Israelites eye for an eye tooth for
[44:18] tooth revenge is very much in their
[44:20] blood but you see because he walked by
[44:23] faith and not by the five senses
[44:27] he said don't be grieved nor be angry
[44:28] with yourselves you sold me hether for
[44:30] God did send me before you to preserve
[44:32] life you see he realized that his walk
[44:35] was because of Revelation his you know
[44:37] he he was everything he happened
[44:41] happened to him that this would happen
[44:44] this moment this moment would happen in
[44:46] his life you see I've been through the
[44:47] ringer Joseph went through the
[44:49] ringer right he went through the ringer
[44:51] but he didn't he didn't let the five
[44:53] senses dominate him did he feel sad he
[44:56] would have felt very sad did he feel
[44:58] alone he would have felt very alone did
[45:00] he feel like Lord Where What Where are
[45:02] you in this he would have felt like that
[45:03] but yet the Revelation held
[45:07] hallelujah amen see we've got to as as
[45:11] um see he said of you know don't be
[45:13] angry you know no doubt some of his
[45:15] brothers were like man we're going to
[45:16] get it now remember when their father
[45:18] died they're all afraid of Joseph now so
[45:21] surely he's going to get his revenge and
[45:22] it's like they just didn't get it you
[45:25] see those who have the revelation of the
[45:27] word they get it Joseph got it the
[45:29] brothers receiv received the benefit of
[45:31] it but they didn't get it you see that's
[45:34] why but we can't walk how how other
[45:36] people respond we can't walk by how
[45:38] other people react we got to walk
[45:39] according to the word and the word alone
[45:41] see God wants you to walk with him alone
[45:44] he doesn't want you to walk with your
[45:45] family and God or the church even and
[45:48] God he wants you and himself alone in
[45:51] this walk that when Mom and Dad aren't
[45:53] there your siblings aren't there church
[45:55] ain't there nothing's there you're
[45:56] walking with the word amen amen praise
[45:59] the Lord because we must know we must
[46:01] know how to fight a good
[46:03] Warfare right and Joseph fought a good
[46:05] Warfare I mean the campaign he was in he
[46:08] walked a good you know he fought a good
[46:10] battle why because he did not walk by
[46:12] his five senses he didn't walk by his
[46:14] reasoning his understanding his
[46:16] conscious any of those things he walked
[46:18] by
[46:19] faith amen David did the same thing now
[46:22] isn't it amazing this is uh this Psalm
[46:24] here A Psalm of David when he fled from
[46:26] Absalon on his son see but then so so
[46:29] it's during this time David would say oh
[46:31] but thou oh Lord a shield for me and a
[46:34] glory and a lifter of my head so so he's
[46:37] saying Lord You're a shield of
[46:38] Revelation you're a shield of faith for
[46:40] me I mean during a very confusing time
[46:43] during the time when Absalon his son had
[46:45] thrown him off the throne he had to run
[46:47] for his life very confusing time you
[46:49] know David no doubt would be wondering
[46:51] is his men for him or against him as
[46:53] counsels they for me or against me it's
[46:55] very murky time when there's a rebellion
[46:57] going on especially within a family but
[46:59] David would ascribe God as a shield from
[47:02] during these times amen and then when he
[47:05] came down that when he was he was he was
[47:07] on the Run uh you know y he was on the
[47:10] run you know finally yo it's amazing
[47:13] it's amazing who comes to talk to you
[47:16] and kick you when you're
[47:17] down when you're up no one wants to
[47:20] touch you but when you're down oh boy
[47:22] everyone's opinion comes out oh it's my
[47:25] time now I can really give a piece of my
[47:27] mind how I feel about these things yeah
[47:29] but you see it's incredible isn't it
[47:31] really you know we've all been there
[47:33] it's like thank you for telling me that
[47:35] I did not need to know but they feel
[47:37] like somehow this thing that's been Liv
[47:39] you know it's been buzzing around in
[47:40] them for years I've got to tell this
[47:42] person this thing but they're not down
[47:45] yet basically that's what they're saying
[47:47] anyway you see but you see now David was
[47:49] on the Run he was going with his mighty
[47:50] men then this then this um do we have
[47:53] his name there shimi he's a he he's a
[47:55] benjamite he's of the he's of the House
[47:57] of Saul finally you know because we know
[48:00] David took the kingship over after Saul
[48:02] died in the Battle and so so David was
[48:05] not of the House of Saul he wasn't a
[48:06] benjamite he was from the tribe of Judah
[48:08] but then finally this man from from
[48:10] Benjamin says now's my time this man's
[48:13] On The Run finally I can give him a
[48:14] piece of my mind and then so he starts
[48:16] throwing rocks and starts cursing him
[48:18] and starts doing all these things and
[48:20] then even David's mighty man said am I
[48:22] going to let the head of this dog you
[48:23] know leave his head on his shoulders you
[48:25] know he's cursing my King but then David
[48:28] because he wasn't walking by the five
[48:30] senses you think about this he's been
[48:31] reject he he's on the run from his
[48:33] family see we have a choice David has a
[48:36] choice in these moments is he going to
[48:37] walk by faith what is that Faith David
[48:40] you're King I've anointed you King
[48:42] you're the king over my household your
[48:44] son Solomon's going to rule on the
[48:46] throne you know all these things David
[48:47] already knows so now is he going to walk
[48:49] by that Revelation or is he going to
[48:51] walk by his five senses that when his
[48:53] enemies come and start cursing him when
[48:55] he's down is he going to say to his man
[48:57] take his head
[48:59] off it's easy to say take his head off
[49:02] see the devil wants to pull us down into
[49:04] a carnal realm right but victories are
[49:07] not done when we get carnal victories
[49:09] are done when we walk by Revelation Amen
[49:12] brother Brown will be standing in Oregon
[49:13] and we know Tommy Osborne was in the
[49:15] meeting and it inspired actually his
[49:17] ministry where where a maniac came up
[49:19] demon possessed big man came up before
[49:21] brother brandham and said I'm going to
[49:22] tear you Lim from Lim standing right
[49:24] there before him on the platform and you
[49:26] begin to spit his face and curse him now
[49:28] we know brother Brandon was a boxer
[49:29] before he got converted so naturally he
[49:32] could naturally box and maybe he could
[49:33] have socked him when he would have been
[49:35] on the ground but the devil was was
[49:37] inspiring that man to try and drag the
[49:39] prophet from a spiritual realm into a
[49:41] caral realm because when the devil has
[49:43] us in a caral realm he's got us amen but
[49:45] when we walk by faith amen we've got him
[49:48] amen so now so so the devil is trying to
[49:50] get the the prophet to come down into a
[49:52] carnal realm but then the prophet did
[49:54] not let himself go that way but he said
[49:57] actually I felt sorry for the man he
[49:59] began to feel sorry for the man actually
[50:01] had love and compassion for the man and
[50:03] then when that man said I'm going to te
[50:04] limb from limb you know it wasn't
[50:07] brother Ram that said it but God spoke
[50:09] out and said because you've challenged
[50:10] the spirit of living God you'll fall at
[50:12] my feet that wasn't brother Braham
[50:14] saying that that was God through him I
[50:16] mean speaking that and we know what
[50:17] happened the man tried to punch him fell
[50:20] on his feet the police came said as he
[50:22] did no he's just passed out as he
[50:23] delivered now he worships the spirit but
[50:25] you see as the thing is the devil tried
[50:27] to drag the prophet down into a carnal
[50:29] realm he tries to do that to us all the
[50:34] time but we don't have to stay that way
[50:38] but God enrich in Mercy amen because God
[50:40] doesn't want you to walk in your
[50:42] Humanity he wants you to walk by faith
[50:44] CU God wants to contact you it's not
[50:48] just us wanting to contact God God wants
[50:49] to contact us
[50:52] hallelujah amen so so even even David
[50:55] would say here no the Lord told him to
[50:57] do this and there's nowhere in the story
[50:59] where God said hold up everyone shimy I
[51:02] got a question for you did God tell you
[51:04] this no it's not in the he didn't ask
[51:06] him but because he was walking by faith
[51:09] he realized actually God has bidden him
[51:11] God has allowed this whole thing to
[51:13] transpire so that because he could see
[51:15] the big picture like Joseph could see
[51:17] the big picture Brethren the reason you
[51:19] hated me cuz God didn't want me in my
[51:21] father's tent he wanted me here the
[51:23] reason you wanted to kill me was because
[51:25] God didn't want me in my father and he
[51:26] wanted me here amen hallelujah you see
[51:31] he could see the big picture see Lord
[51:33] help us see the big picture you say in
[51:36] everyday life absolutely amen because
[51:38] Joseph he conducted his everyday life
[51:40] because he was walking by faith he saw
[51:43] value in every he saw value being in
[51:45] prison he saw value in part of his house
[51:48] he saw value being hated by his Brethren
[51:50] CU he could look back and see God your
[51:51] hand was in it all God help us be that
[51:54] way amen and every day boring mondayitis
[52:00] life praise God that's how we should be
[52:04] amen so David said know God's told him
[52:06] to do it amen what a victory that
[52:09] was now let's see where I am that we
[52:13] just go here amen so now now we are we
[52:16] are to walk by faith brother Bram would
[52:20] say that faith is the super sense it's
[52:24] superior to the five senses a amen it
[52:27] see see the six Sense come for this
[52:28] reason why did it come the six sense is
[52:31] Faith the super sense the six sense came
[52:33] for this reason to make the five senses
[52:35] in you deny anything that's contrary to
[52:38] God's word amen so no matter what your
[52:40] five senses declare that super sense of
[52:42] faith is to overcome all the or to take
[52:44] dominion over those things that though
[52:47] what that that your faith will declare
[52:49] things contrary to what you see feel
[52:52] taste smell and
[52:53] here amen that's what the six senses for
[52:57] the scriptures speaks of casting down
[52:59] reasonings the five senses well you can
[53:01] reason well why should this why should
[53:03] he do that but the six sense see takes
[53:06] dominion over the five senses I mean
[53:08] aren't you glad you got a stronger sense
[53:10] than what you see we see a lot of bad
[53:12] but Faith tells me otherwise I mean I
[53:14] hear a lot of evil but Faith tells me
[53:16] otherwise amen hallelujah now we know
[53:20] that the church is built upon Revelation
[53:23] built upon Faith right the shield that
[53:25] you carry is very powerful you can
[53:27] actually see through this Shield you can
[53:29] walk by it hold it up and walk and you
[53:31] can push your enemy down and cut his
[53:32] head off with the sword of the spirit
[53:34] amen but you see the whole church is
[53:36] built upon Revelation Revelation is
[53:38] Faith amen and you cannot have a
[53:40] revelation without being faith faith is
[53:41] a revelation because it's something
[53:43] that's revealed to you faith is a
[53:45] revelation faith is something that's
[53:47] been revealed to you like it was to
[53:48] Abraham that he could call anything
[53:50] contrary to what had been revealed to
[53:51] him as though it wasn't so now Faith
[53:54] that's what faith is and the is the re
[53:56] revelation of God the church is built
[53:58] upon a revelation the entire the whole
[54:01] entire body amen this is very important
[54:04] amen now in the church ages we know that
[54:07] every blessing that comes down is
[54:09] actually comes down into every age right
[54:11] this is from the Philadelphian age but
[54:13] it applies to us he says he that
[54:14] overcometh will I make a pillar in the
[54:17] temple of my God and he shall not go out
[54:19] no more and I'll write upon him the name
[54:21] of my God and the name of the city of my
[54:23] God which is the New Jerusalem which
[54:25] cometh out of the heaven from my God and
[54:27] I will write upon him my new name now
[54:30] the pillar is actually part of the
[54:32] foundation right it's not a separate
[54:34] piece of the building it's actually the
[54:36] foundation goes up into the pillar that
[54:38] holds up the house amen so in other
[54:40] words brother I'm saying here is that
[54:42] everything that was in the foundation is
[54:44] in you amen so in other words part of
[54:46] the foundation what will I give him I'll
[54:48] put in him the doctrine of the Apostles
[54:50] and prophets from the beginning and give
[54:52] him the Revelation what the prophets say
[54:54] about him well he's a counselor he's a
[54:56] Prince of Peace he's the Mighty God he's
[54:58] the Everlasting father that's what they
[55:00] said the prophets the apostles and he
[55:02] that uh can overcome all the synagogue
[55:04] of Satan keep himself free and look
[55:06] straight to the gate I'll make him a
[55:08] pillar I'll put him back in the
[55:10] foundation of my word in the house of my
[55:12] God oh my I'll put him right there in
[55:14] that pillar in the foundation where you
[55:16] stay right in the word amen I like that
[55:18] brother it's good so everything so if
[55:20] you so if your life is built upon
[55:22] Revelation I'm just wanting to talk
[55:24] about what you can draw strength from
[55:26] right what you can draw strength from
[55:28] right because the the foundation is the
[55:31] true word of God hallelujah right now
[55:33] brother R made a statement he says that
[55:35] whenever man gets back to the word of
[55:37] God they have Revival right so so God
[55:39] doesn't want us to we say well but we
[55:41] have the present truth and we do but
[55:44] we've got to walk with the word and have
[55:46] Revival or we can walk with our five
[55:47] senses and not have Revival you see so
[55:50] it's very you say well I'm a message
[55:51] believer that's just a nice tag but are
[55:53] you walking with the word or are you
[55:55] walking with your father senses you see
[55:57] if you want to have Revival walk with
[55:58] the word and not your five senses am
[56:01] mean if you want to see God live if you
[56:02] want to see an Awakening in your life
[56:04] walk with the word I mean you see the
[56:06] devil's so shrewd he will he will put
[56:08] our desires upon his things and then
[56:11] people get numb they get IND and they
[56:12] wonder what's wrong with them it's
[56:13] because they're feeding on the wrong
[56:15] thing I mean they're drawing strength
[56:16] from the wrong thing it's like if you
[56:18] live on McDonald's every day of your
[56:20] life you're not going to get the
[56:21] nutrition you get from something
[56:23] else I mean I like McDonald's it tastes
[56:26] good but I feel empty
[56:28] afterwards it doesn't sustain me and
[56:31] it's like the things of the world it may
[56:33] taste good to the flesh but it doesn't
[56:34] sustain you you know it doesn't give you
[56:37] spiritual vitamins to walk in this world
[56:39] you see but the thing is people will
[56:42] will will wonder why are they numb why
[56:43] do they feel indifferent well I'll go
[56:45] into that later this afternoon but you
[56:47] see it's because their their their
[56:49] desires have G on the wrong thing and
[56:51] that's how the devil traps people but
[56:53] you see now we are built on this
[56:55] Foundation of the revelation of the word
[56:57] so everything that's in the word now is
[56:59] in
[57:01] US praise God now I'm just going to lay
[57:03] a foundation because I'm going somewhere
[57:05] with this okay I am and I'll actually go
[57:07] somewhere with this not just lay
[57:08] foundation and quit okay so now you see
[57:11] the six
[57:12] sense The Sixth Sense doesn't see that
[57:15] at all any of the carnal things it's so
[57:18] far beyond that it's so much higher than
[57:20] this until you don't even have any
[57:22] reasonings at all with it so it's so far
[57:25] above these natural sensus so far above
[57:27] your reasoning your mental faculties the
[57:29] six sense is far greater than those
[57:30] things that it doesn't have any
[57:32] reasonings about it at all so when the
[57:34] six sense goes to work I mean a
[57:36] revelation strikes your soul that
[57:38] becomes your reality and it's not an
[57:41] alternative reality it is the reality
[57:43] because by faith these worlds were made
[57:45] by faith amen we are here by faith
[57:47] Abraham by faith Moses they did many
[57:49] things by faith and it was their reality
[57:52] amen like when Moses went into Egypt his
[57:55] reality was God is going to bring these
[57:57] people out amen and it wasn't just you
[57:59] know these days people say oh this is my
[58:02] truth or this is your truth there's only
[58:04] one truth Jesus said I'm the way the
[58:06] truth and the life amen so there's not
[58:08] just different versions of truth there's
[58:10] one truth and then then the rest is all
[58:11] wrong right so when Moses received the
[58:14] Revelation from the burning bush he
[58:15] picked up a shield of faith that he did
[58:17] not have in the beginning because he
[58:19] failed miserably when he tried to
[58:20] deliver the people the first time but at
[58:22] the burning bush he received that Shield
[58:24] of Faith he rose it up and he went down
[58:26] into Egypt he said let my people go
[58:28] because he was walking he was looking at
[58:30] the world through faith he wasn't
[58:33] beforehand he was looking through a
[58:34] carnal understanding well I'm the
[58:36] promised son my mama told me so the
[58:39] prophecy and what she said matches I
[58:41] must be him look I'm now a prince in
[58:43] Egypt am I talking too
[58:45] fast are you am I okay okay good you see
[58:49] so so he was looking through a caral he
[58:50] was looking through his five senses his
[58:52] reasoning he was looking through his
[58:54] reasoning before he had to run from
[58:56] Egypt saying look I can I can do this
[58:59] I'm a military man I'm a prince I've got
[59:01] influence I can I can deliver Israel I
[59:04] know how to fight battles I can train
[59:05] them I know where the weapons are I know
[59:07] the weaknesses of the army of Egypt I
[59:09] can do this but you see he was looking
[59:11] through it the wrong way and when you
[59:12] look at things through you know the
[59:14] wrong way it ain't going to work and we
[59:17] get frustrated we get annoyed why is
[59:19] this not working you're looking at it
[59:20] the wrong way but if you hold up a
[59:22] shield of Faith now like when Moses
[59:25] received that Shield of Faith he was
[59:26] looking through the promise and it was
[59:29] revealed to him it wasn't a nice idea
[59:31] anymore it was a
[59:33] reality amen that's why when he went
[59:35] into Egypt and Pharaoh said no he says
[59:37] well God's going to make you God's going
[59:39] to make you because I'm not compromising
[59:41] he said we're not leaving one hoof
[59:42] behind we're not leaving our old our
[59:44] young our young people whatever old
[59:47] people everyone's coming cuz he was
[59:49] looking through the Revelation he was
[59:51] holding that Shield of faith and looking
[59:52] at it and saying that was his reality
[59:54] and what happened faith
[59:56] made it
[59:58] material you know that same faith in
[1:00:00] Moses in you you know the same faith
[1:00:02] that bring the prophecy concerning you
[1:00:04] to pass is in you that same faith not a
[1:00:06] different faith not a lesser Faith the
[1:00:08] same Faith Amen brother brah said that
[1:00:10] if Moses under the blood of blls and
[1:00:12] goats can bring creation how much more
[1:00:14] are people under the blood of Jesus
[1:00:15] Christ and mean the spoken words being
[1:00:17] restored to where it's not our human
[1:00:19] humanly trying to speak something no
[1:00:21] it's God speaking through you Hallelujah
[1:00:26] I it's going to come to this I want to
[1:00:28] show where's
[1:00:29] William there's Goliath's head reading
[1:00:32] David and Goliath and you I said about
[1:00:35] David cutting off his head he's like
[1:00:36] where's the picture they don't show it
[1:00:37] so I found a picture now before this
[1:00:41] happened before this happened do you
[1:00:44] think it was David humanly saying to
[1:00:46] Goliath I'm going to cut your head off
[1:00:48] do you think it was David humanly saying
[1:00:50] who is this uncircumcised Philistine do
[1:00:52] you think it was David humanly saying
[1:00:54] I'm going to kill this guy no it was God
[1:00:56] in him speaking I mean when David said
[1:00:59] to Goliath I'm going to kill you this
[1:01:01] day cut your head off and I'm going to
[1:01:03] feed all the host of the Philistines to
[1:01:05] the birds of the air that wasn't him
[1:01:08] that was God speaking through him I mean
[1:01:10] he was looking through a shield of faith
[1:01:12] of Revelation I've been anointed king
[1:01:14] I've been given dominion over every
[1:01:16] enemy that comes on my land so you must
[1:01:18] die I mean you cannot stand and it's the
[1:01:21] same thing with you and I friends we've
[1:01:22] been anointed by a Vindicated Prophet
[1:01:24] this word has got full of anoint anting
[1:01:26] amen God has poured it out in his
[1:01:27] fullness in this day amen upon you and
[1:01:30] you've got to realize I'm not a slave
[1:01:32] I'm not a victim I'm an overcomer
[1:01:35] hallelujah amen hallelujah you got to
[1:01:38] cut off the devil's head and raise it up
[1:01:41] raise it up so the others can rally and
[1:01:43] say Yes hallelujah hallelujah hallu
[1:01:47] hallelujah sir amen he raised up gli's
[1:01:50] head it wasn't him just being a boy
[1:01:51] saying I can do it it was God saying I
[1:01:53] can do it and David just surrendered
[1:01:56] himself to that leading to that
[1:01:58] anointing
[1:02:00] Hallelujah glory to God praise the
[1:02:04] Lord
[1:02:06] amen see David's Faith looked far above
[1:02:09] reasoning it looked far above the fear
[1:02:11] that was permeating the camp and the
[1:02:13] intimidation of the enemy you see faith
[1:02:16] faith knows no defeat faith is perfect
[1:02:19] what are you looking through today what
[1:02:21] glass are you looking through your
[1:02:23] reasoning your history your past what
[1:02:26] you've done what you've come what are
[1:02:27] you looking at through through
[1:02:30] Revelation Faith brings things where
[1:02:33] there uh where there is no things to be
[1:02:34] bought Faith creates Faith takes doubt
[1:02:37] away takes NE negative makes positive
[1:02:39] how beautiful the old man had a basis of
[1:02:41] Faith that's uh Simeon in the temple
[1:02:44] faith is not mythical something mentally
[1:02:46] worked up it's absolutely fundamentally
[1:02:48] result that happens in a person's heart
[1:02:50] amen so we don't work ourselves up into
[1:02:52] Faith it's not an emotional thing that
[1:02:54] we somehow go emotional and jump into it
[1:02:57] no it comes into the heart emotion comes
[1:02:59] with it sure amen but it's something
[1:03:01] that anchors in the heart that God said
[1:03:03] so it
[1:03:04] is amen praise the Lord I don't know
[1:03:08] where I am but hey that's fine you see
[1:03:12] Faith
[1:03:13] creates Faith changes things I remember
[1:03:16] when we were living in fricken Grove
[1:03:18] there was a growth growing on Chris side
[1:03:20] of her head this white thing was growing
[1:03:22] was it shooting pains down it was it was
[1:03:24] a yeah right we had just heard a
[1:03:26] testimony of a brother uh I don't know
[1:03:28] where it was from but he had a growth on
[1:03:30] his nose or something so every morning
[1:03:32] when he went to shave he' put his finger
[1:03:34] on and say I curse you in the name of
[1:03:35] Jesus Christ and so she started doing
[1:03:38] that and then one day a revelation
[1:03:40] anchored into her heart this thing isn't
[1:03:42] part of me and she cursed in the name of
[1:03:44] Jesus Christ and it fell off into her
[1:03:46] hand roots and
[1:03:48] all why because Faith creates Faith
[1:03:51] brings a change amen it's not just a
[1:03:54] nice idea when it anchors in your heart
[1:03:55] you realize no that's when faith has
[1:03:57] gone into action amen and that's what
[1:03:59] then Faith changes things amen praise
[1:04:03] the Lord and the super sense is the Holy
[1:04:05] Spirit the faith of God that dwells in
[1:04:06] you and if you'll let the five senses be
[1:04:09] yielded to the six sense it'll guide you
[1:04:11] and bring all the other five senses
[1:04:13] under control of that super sense for
[1:04:15] it's so far above the natural sense as
[1:04:17] the spiritual man is above the natural
[1:04:19] it's as far as high as the heavens is
[1:04:21] above the natural man in his five senses
[1:04:24] it makes you believe things that you
[1:04:25] cannot cannot see it makes you act where
[1:04:27] you do not think the five senses would
[1:04:28] ever think about the devil can't can get
[1:04:31] into those five senses and lie to you
[1:04:34] but he cannot touch that super sense I
[1:04:36] mean he cannot touch your faith amen he
[1:04:38] can lie to you through your reasoning
[1:04:40] your affections conscience imagination
[1:04:42] all those things memory he can light you
[1:04:44] through your eyes and the things you
[1:04:45] hear and see and all those things but he
[1:04:47] cannot touch that super sense it's far
[1:04:49] beyond his reach that came from God it's
[1:04:52] called faith and faith is that great
[1:04:54] thing amen if you read the you know
[1:04:57] Hebrews 11 and you know we we call it
[1:04:59] the Heroes of Faith or the the faith
[1:05:02] chapter by faith Noah built the ark by
[1:05:05] faith Moses by faith Abraham all these
[1:05:07] ones it was what did they do they
[1:05:09] yielded themselves to that Faith they
[1:05:12] let that Faith govern their lives they
[1:05:14] didn't let their five senses govern
[1:05:16] their lives they let that Faith take
[1:05:18] control Aben it may have taken a bit of
[1:05:20] time Abraham had 25 years but he got to
[1:05:23] a spot cuz at one point he was laughing
[1:05:25] at you know rolling in the Dust In God's
[1:05:27] feet laughing saying how can this ever
[1:05:29] be right but God was determined I've
[1:05:32] made you the father of many nations am
[1:05:35] mean you'll be the father of Faith amen
[1:05:37] so God brought him through a process
[1:05:39] until finally what he could feel he
[1:05:41] denied what he what he heard what he
[1:05:44] felt in his body what he saw in SE his
[1:05:46] body now this is not mind over matter
[1:05:49] but he took faith above as his reality
[1:05:51] that he's going to have the promised son
[1:05:53] above what he saw what he heard what he
[1:05:55] felt
[1:05:56] right so he took faith and let Faith
[1:05:59] take control of the five senses and when
[1:06:01] he did that amen what happened here came
[1:06:04] Isaac in his
[1:06:07] time
[1:06:08] now I've got to find this
[1:06:13] one because I don't want to miss these
[1:06:22] things
[1:06:24] now the five senses does not control The
[1:06:26] Sixth Sense this is from if you want to
[1:06:28] hear a good sermon listen to a super
[1:06:29] sense
[1:06:31] 1959 but the Sixth Sense controls the
[1:06:34] five senses the super sense controls the
[1:06:36] natural senses and the five senses is SE
[1:06:38] taste feel smell and here and the super
[1:06:40] sense is something that'll make you
[1:06:42] believe God's word for that's the only
[1:06:44] thing it'll speak
[1:06:46] about who God is our counselor you've
[1:06:50] got to really sit you know sometimes you
[1:06:51] got to sit back and think what is this
[1:06:53] voice talking to me who is this voice
[1:06:55] talking to me right because faith will
[1:06:57] only talk about faith in God's word
[1:07:00] that's what the super sense talks to you
[1:07:02] about I mean it does not talk to you
[1:07:04] about anything negative right because
[1:07:06] remember Satan is a
[1:07:10] perverter God is our counselor and Satan
[1:07:13] will pervert counsel because God if he's
[1:07:15] a counselor which he is he brings you to
[1:07:17] a conclusion he brings you to a clear
[1:07:20] this is the conclusion of the matter he
[1:07:22] may take you through and take you
[1:07:23] through the scripture and take you
[1:07:25] through what what you're going through
[1:07:26] but he always comes to a conclusion and
[1:07:29] it's clear and it gives you a peace who
[1:07:32] understands that right but the Devil is
[1:07:34] a perverter he will counsel you but he
[1:07:37] will never bring you to a conclusion
[1:07:39] it's like he just puts you on a hamster
[1:07:40] wheel of ideas and it rolls and it rolls
[1:07:43] and there's no conclusion he just maybe
[1:07:45] changes throws some more things in there
[1:07:47] and there's no conclusion to his Council
[1:07:50] that's how you know the devil's talking
[1:07:51] to you instead of God there's no
[1:07:53] conclusion and it doesn't give you a
[1:07:55] peace
[1:07:56] amen he will never bring you to a
[1:07:58] conclusion he just wants you to run
[1:08:00] through those ideas over and over and
[1:08:02] the what could be and the what all these
[1:08:03] variables and stuff but God just brings
[1:08:05] a simple answer that brings a conclusion
[1:08:09] now remember Satan is the Angel of the
[1:08:13] bottomless pit Revelations chapter 9 he
[1:08:17] at Revelations chapter n he
[1:08:20] falls right the angel fell amen
[1:08:26] he's a fallen
[1:08:27] angel that means his counsel will cause
[1:08:30] you to
[1:08:31] fall this is how you know the devil's
[1:08:33] talking to you if you he will cause you
[1:08:35] to fall cause you to fall into anger
[1:08:39] jealousy and resentment he causes you to
[1:08:42] fall out with everyone that's what his
[1:08:44] counsel does it brings separation it
[1:08:46] doesn't bring it doesn't bring families
[1:08:49] together doesn't bring parents and
[1:08:50] children together doesn't bring churches
[1:08:52] together doesn't bring families together
[1:08:54] no it causes a separation ation and
[1:08:56] causes you to fall amen it doesn't give
[1:08:58] you a stability doesn't give you a peace
[1:09:00] like God does Amen no it causes you to
[1:09:03] fall amen yo no one understands me I'm
[1:09:06] just misunderstood this is not fair if
[1:09:08] God's God why does he allow those things
[1:09:10] that's the devil's counsel amen if you
[1:09:13] because he wants to put a doubt on God's
[1:09:15] word he he doesn't want Faith to control
[1:09:17] you he wants his unbelief to control
[1:09:20] you amen see he will always use
[1:09:23] reasoning against God's word and he'll
[1:09:25] always appeal to the five senses amen
[1:09:28] he'll show you all everything that's
[1:09:29] wrong with your
[1:09:32] parents he will show you everything
[1:09:34] wrong with your
[1:09:35] situation amen he will that's what he
[1:09:38] does just like you know with Moab you
[1:09:39] know King BAC would take balum because
[1:09:42] because he hiired balum remember to
[1:09:43] curse Israel and then so but then
[1:09:46] because God said to balum you'll only
[1:09:48] say what I say what I tell you to say
[1:09:50] and then so what balum started blessing
[1:09:52] Israel and then so BAC took is um took
[1:09:56] took balum to the hinder parts of Israel
[1:09:59] I'll show you the nasty things I'll show
[1:10:01] you their humanity and all the sin and
[1:10:03] all the trouble that's going on in
[1:10:05] Israel because he thought because this
[1:10:07] is the devil's counsel he wants to show
[1:10:09] you the negative right but then when God
[1:10:11] inspires balam to prophesy he says I see
[1:10:14] no iniquity in Jacob amen the shout of
[1:10:17] the king is among them amen it's a God's
[1:10:19] C and but was there sin in the camp yes
[1:10:24] was there Humanity
[1:10:25] yes were they caral Believers yes all
[1:10:29] those things were there but you see the
[1:10:31] true perspective of Israel was I see no
[1:10:33] iniquity in Jacob why because the blood
[1:10:35] of the bulls and goats was covering them
[1:10:37] I mean they walking in the king's
[1:10:39] presence God himself was among them amen
[1:10:41] so the devil but the devil will never
[1:10:43] will never cause you to look at those
[1:10:45] things he will never cause you to
[1:10:47] recognize the holy ghost in your parents
[1:10:50] or your siblings or the church cuz this
[1:10:53] Cil remember he's a fallen angel you're
[1:10:54] the devil is not a
[1:10:56] Believer he does not understand Faith he
[1:10:59] does not understand you amen he may
[1:11:03] understand Humanity but he he does not
[1:11:05] understand you because you've got a sick
[1:11:07] sense he knows nothing about amen but
[1:11:09] you see now he wants you to be who's
[1:11:13] ever felt frustrated let's be honest now
[1:11:15] we're human yeah good good some people
[1:11:17] are Angel no people are honest
[1:11:20] good thought man I'm going to sit down
[1:11:22] and you're going to give me some
[1:11:23] pointers anyway we've all felt
[1:11:26] frustrated why do we feel frustrated
[1:11:28] just the devil counseling us but he
[1:11:31] never gives you a way out see the lord
[1:11:33] always gives a way of Escape he gives
[1:11:35] you a conclusion right where the devil
[1:11:37] gets you on his hamster wheel and makes
[1:11:39] you feel
[1:11:41] frustrated right that's how you know I'm
[1:11:44] just telling you basically this is how
[1:11:45] you know the devil's talking to
[1:11:47] you right frustration begins to rule
[1:11:50] your life because he doesn't show you a
[1:11:52] way out frustration is when you do not
[1:11:54] have a clear Way
[1:11:56] Forward and the devil doesn't want you
[1:11:58] to see a clear Way Forward he wants you
[1:12:00] to see the obstacles the problems the
[1:12:02] obvious things that are there but
[1:12:04] there's no answer and that's why people
[1:12:06] get so frustrated because why they're
[1:12:08] listening to the wrong
[1:12:12] counselor amen see frustration is the
[1:12:15] feeling of being upset or annoyed as a
[1:12:17] result of being unable to change or
[1:12:18] achieve something Faith does not make
[1:12:20] you frustrated Faith gives you a peace
[1:12:24] gives you a determination gives you a
[1:12:26] boldness gives you a Zeal gives you a
[1:12:28] calmness because you know the way out
[1:12:30] cuz God's shown you the way out but the
[1:12:32] devil just makes you frustrated looks at
[1:12:33] the obstacles the problems you see the
[1:12:35] children of Israel two of the spies were
[1:12:39] walking with the shield of
[1:12:41] Faith they saw the promise they were
[1:12:44] looking at the promise through the
[1:12:45] Revelation the others just got
[1:12:47] frustrated there's Giants there's walls
[1:12:49] there's this problem this is here we
[1:12:51] can't get over this it's too big blah
[1:12:53] blah blah we're a grasshoppers these
[1:12:55] problems that wasn't Faith they weren't
[1:12:57] walking by The Sixth Sense they walking
[1:13:00] by the five senses you see and then you
[1:13:03] you know they complained against Moses
[1:13:04] and all these things the the sand and
[1:13:06] the problems in the desert all these
[1:13:08] things of course there was sand of
[1:13:10] course there was the desert there over
[1:13:11] years all those things were there but
[1:13:13] Caleb and Joshua and the younger
[1:13:16] generation weren't looking they weren't
[1:13:18] listening to the devil counseling them
[1:13:21] they were looking at looking through
[1:13:23] God's looking glass of Revelation and
[1:13:25] they said we're more than able to take
[1:13:27] the
[1:13:27] land amen yes sir amen so Satan will
[1:13:31] never give you a conclusion this is how
[1:13:33] you know you say well I've been
[1:13:34] listening to him a long time you got to
[1:13:35] get up out of his uh psychiatric chair
[1:13:38] psychiatrist chair you got to get up out
[1:13:40] of that thing it may be comfortable to
[1:13:42] to just say paor me and everything's
[1:13:44] wrong get up out of that thing am mean
[1:13:45] God's given you power over that thing
[1:13:47] God's given you dominion over every
[1:13:49] trouble I mean God's given you a way out
[1:13:51] but you got to listen to his voice amen
[1:13:53] and let Faith rule your life the Lord
[1:13:57] amen you say my problem's too big
[1:14:00] no sorry my problem's too complex now
[1:14:05] sorry you just don't understand me God
[1:14:09] does there was a sin question one day
[1:14:13] that was a big problem very complex
[1:14:15] problem very difficult problem God Sol
[1:14:19] it I'm not I'm not diminishing anything
[1:14:21] but I just want you to realize God
[1:14:23] solved it if he can take care of your
[1:14:25] mess of your sin he can take care of the
[1:14:28] mess you find yourself walking in I mean
[1:14:30] he can guide you through it he can show
[1:14:32] you a path I mean he can show you the
[1:14:34] way
[1:14:35] out oh but not me stop listening to that
[1:14:39] voice this is not fair life ain't Fair
[1:14:42] that's right but faith says there's a
[1:14:43] way out remember God wants us to be
[1:14:47] Overcomers an overcomer brother BR says
[1:14:49] doesn't just push through a pipe and
[1:14:50] made to overcome they have a part in the
[1:14:53] matter themselves what do that part of
[1:14:55] the matter to overcome their five senses
[1:14:58] to surrender to Faith and let Faith live
[1:15:01] above their five senses you've got a
[1:15:02] choice every day you got a choice you
[1:15:05] can either walk in your flesh or walk
[1:15:07] with
[1:15:08] God I'd rather walk with God than
[1:15:13] walk yep
[1:15:17] amen you see God after you've been tried
[1:15:19] a while what does he want to do make you
[1:15:21] perfect establish strengthen and settle
[1:15:23] you that's what his counsel does it
[1:15:26] makes you perfect it establishes you
[1:15:28] doesn't destabilize you doesn't throw
[1:15:30] you with a million questions like the
[1:15:32] serpent Eve y haath God said and when
[1:15:34] people try and throw questions on the
[1:15:35] word of God what are they doing that's a
[1:15:37] serpent speaking it doesn't stabilize
[1:15:39] anything well if God is God why does
[1:15:41] this happen it's a question it's not
[1:15:42] building your faith it's trying to
[1:15:43] diminish your faith I mean strengthen
[1:15:46] you and settle you says what God
[1:15:48] does but it depends it depends what
[1:15:51] you're how you're looking as I said
[1:15:53] before Moses Moses and Pharaoh saw the
[1:15:56] same saw the same um same people they
[1:16:01] saw the Israelites they both saw
[1:16:03] outwardly
[1:16:04] slaves but Moses Through The Eyes of
[1:16:07] Faith saw Israel a prince with God I
[1:16:11] mean because remember the word says out
[1:16:12] of Egypt I've called my son not just
[1:16:14] talking about Jesus but as the Lesser
[1:16:16] one was Israel himself the people of
[1:16:18] Israel coming out of Egypt so by that by
[1:16:21] that Shield of Revelation Moses saw them
[1:16:23] I see a prince with God I I see Israel I
[1:16:25] don't see a nameless bunch of slaves no
[1:16:27] I see God's children coming out now I
[1:16:29] ask you the question what do you see
[1:16:31] when you look at your family what do you
[1:16:34] see when you look at your church what do
[1:16:35] you see when you look at your spouse or
[1:16:37] your children what do you
[1:16:40] see frustration if you're frustrated
[1:16:42] with your family or yourself you're
[1:16:44] looking through the wrong thing I mean
[1:16:47] you're looking through the devil's eyes
[1:16:48] I'll put it real BL you're looking
[1:16:49] through the devil's eyes of unbelief but
[1:16:51] see we should not be see the natural eye
[1:16:53] will cause you to see all the problem
[1:16:55] s and this is why many men will run away
[1:16:58] into a cave there's a lot of cave
[1:17:01] dwelling men in the
[1:17:03] Bible right Steve bristen brought it out
[1:17:05] in that gender confusion series very
[1:17:07] well he say well I'm here I'm not in the
[1:17:10] wilderness I haven't found a physical
[1:17:11] Cave the Cave can be right here you know
[1:17:14] a nothing box is just I'll just be here
[1:17:16] we are a nothing box is really just a
[1:17:18] cave
[1:17:25] it
[1:17:26] is I'm a man too so I'm talking to
[1:17:28] myself what do you do I'm just in my
[1:17:30] nothing box make sure you're not just
[1:17:32] hiding in a cave where where where you
[1:17:34] shut down emotionally shut down and just
[1:17:36] go through the motions of life we're not
[1:17:37] called just to go through the motions of
[1:17:39] life we're here to possess every promise
[1:17:41] of God am mean if we look at our family
[1:17:43] like I mean when my children were young
[1:17:44] some of you William still I think what's
[1:17:46] in them you're just holding a baby Lord
[1:17:49] what gift have you put in this put in
[1:17:51] this child Lord what are you going to
[1:17:53] use this child for
[1:17:56] Hall what is that that's looking through
[1:17:57] eyes of Faith you say well they naughty
[1:17:58] they do all these things I'm not looking
[1:18:00] at that I'm not looking at them just
[1:18:02] being adolesence and not mature I'm
[1:18:03] looking beyond that amen but I'm looking
[1:18:06] at a gift of God that's put in flesh
[1:18:08] amen so you're going to look beyond what
[1:18:10] they do sure we've got to raise them if
[1:18:11] we love them we'll correct them we'll
[1:18:13] guide them we'll protect them if we love
[1:18:15] them amen sure we'll do those things but
[1:18:18] are you just looking at that or are you
[1:18:21] looking beyond that say God this is an
[1:18:23] attribute of you and flesh
[1:18:25] what do you see when you look at your
[1:18:26] spouse are you do you see the same thing
[1:18:29] or oh she doesn't understand or he
[1:18:31] doesn't understand or he's this or
[1:18:33] she's that's the devil's language we're
[1:18:36] going to start thinking God's thoughts
[1:18:38] am me you may feel you know I heard
[1:18:40] someone say I can't remember who it was
[1:18:42] but you know you can think something but
[1:18:44] when you speak something that thought
[1:18:46] stops because you begin to because your
[1:18:49] mind is engaged with what you're saying
[1:18:52] so if the Devil Comes you're saying
[1:18:53] you're loser you're no good you'll never
[1:18:54] overcome you never this start speaking
[1:18:57] positive and that thought will actually
[1:18:59] become silent as you're
[1:19:00] speaking amen start confessing positive
[1:19:03] see because we've got to create an
[1:19:04] atmosphere you're an atmosphere
[1:19:06] generator right and you can create a
[1:19:08] negative atmosphere or a positive
[1:19:10] atmosphere and you create that
[1:19:11] Atmosphere by why what you speak the
[1:19:14] actions you use amen so if you look at
[1:19:16] your F see Moses what did he do I see
[1:19:18] Israel is slaves they're not meant to be
[1:19:20] slaves what does you do Lord I give
[1:19:22] myself to the court Lord I put them
[1:19:24] above my own need see he forsook Egypt
[1:19:27] because of Faith he would rather suffer
[1:19:29] the approach of being a slave with
[1:19:31] Israel than be a prince in Egypt so what
[1:19:33] he do he put his own life to one side he
[1:19:36] had a comfortable life backside the
[1:19:38] desert sure high-tempered wife all those
[1:19:40] things but that's you know whatever you
[1:19:41] know but you know he basically had
[1:19:43] entered into retirement he'd shut down
[1:19:45] in his cave and he is in retirement but
[1:19:48] God said I'm going to pull you out I'm
[1:19:50] going to pull you out of this cave women
[1:19:52] can be in caves too you know I'm going
[1:19:53] to pull you out of this thing because
[1:19:55] I've got a job for you to do and what he
[1:19:56] do he says Lord I lay aside the Comforts
[1:19:59] of my life that I have built the small
[1:20:01] little world that I have built in Midian
[1:20:03] and I'm going to give myself to your
[1:20:05] word that you can live through me amen
[1:20:08] do we do the same thing with our
[1:20:09] children with our
[1:20:10] family you say I'm busy we're all busy
[1:20:13] we got a lot of pressure we all got
[1:20:15] pressure but what are we what are we
[1:20:17] looking what are we seeing when we
[1:20:19] look oh he'll never amount to nothing
[1:20:22] you're looking through the wrong eyes oh
[1:20:24] she'll never grow up you're looking
[1:20:25] through the wrong eyes oh she'll never
[1:20:27] get it he'll never get it you're looking
[1:20:28] through the wrong eyes you say lord
[1:20:30] they're your child I mean lord they're
[1:20:33] your children lord they're your seed
[1:20:37] Hallelujah he say God can't do it who
[1:20:41] says
[1:20:42] that I'm serious but the but what
[1:20:45] happens people start
[1:20:47] agreeing they've gone too far they've
[1:20:49] been there too long they just said no I
[1:20:51] know David is not here but he said he'll
[1:20:53] never serve God didn't he say that what
[1:20:56] is he doing now he's serving God you he
[1:20:58] so it doesn't matter what the five
[1:21:00] senses declare doesn't matter how much
[1:21:02] emotions in it and how much
[1:21:03] determination appears to be there that
[1:21:05] ain't faith faith governs all things
[1:21:08] am
[1:21:10] hallelujah amen praise the Lord I'm
[1:21:13] excited because I'm passionate about
[1:21:15] these things we have a Divine faith that
[1:21:18] can Master any circumstance amen
[1:21:21] hallelujah but what Treasures in your
[1:21:23] heart is how your mouth will speak
[1:21:26] what Treasures in there I I pray it's
[1:21:28] good
[1:21:28] things not negative things I don't want
[1:21:32] to be filled with a $2 shop kind of a
[1:21:36] Treasures I want to be filled with
[1:21:37] Priceless things from
[1:21:39] God
[1:21:42] amen Amen brother Braham says this I'm
[1:21:45] going to I'm going to wind up soon he
[1:21:46] says when the new birth comes and it
[1:21:48] cannot come in until there's a death
[1:21:49] first and people don't want to die they
[1:21:51] they don't want the simple leadings of
[1:21:53] the Holy Spirit they want to make their
[1:21:55] own thinking out of it you can't think
[1:21:58] your thoughts you've got to think his
[1:22:00] thoughts let the mind that was in Christ
[1:22:01] be in you amen he thinks God's thoughts
[1:22:04] brings God's blessings God's power to
[1:22:06] you that's so it's so important to think
[1:22:08] God's thoughts and confess God's
[1:22:10] thoughts what that that's his word right
[1:22:12] fill your mouth fill your heart fill
[1:22:14] your mind with his promises you're going
[1:22:16] through a hard time find promises in the
[1:22:19] Bible find promises in the message write
[1:22:21] them down listen to them think about
[1:22:23] them let that become your daily diet
[1:22:25] amen it's going to give you strength
[1:22:27] it's going to give you Faith it's going
[1:22:28] to get you out of the Gloom of the fog
[1:22:30] of what you're trying to go through and
[1:22:31] give you a clear power forward amen I've
[1:22:34] never seen someone who has fit on the
[1:22:36] word of God in faith come out as a
[1:22:37] failure they've been established they've
[1:22:40] come to a place of full surrender
[1:22:42] they've got Victory amen that God is God
[1:22:44] has helped them in those circumstan so
[1:22:46] don't feed on the negative this is a
[1:22:48] very negative world we live in but it's
[1:22:50] also very very positive it depends what
[1:22:53] side you're on there's been such a
[1:22:55] positive age as this age in terms of the
[1:22:57] Gospel of Jesus Christ because there
[1:22:59] could be this morning the dead in Christ
[1:23:01] walk through that
[1:23:02] door that's a great age it's a great age
[1:23:07] hallelujah amen but you see we got to
[1:23:11] get into a condition where our hearts
[1:23:14] not our minds our hearts agree with the
[1:23:15] word of God brother R makes a statement
[1:23:18] he says a man fully surrendered to God
[1:23:20] is omnip potent that means all powerful
[1:23:22] did not he say in Mark 11:22 what
[1:23:24] whatever things you say and don't doubt
[1:23:26] in your heart it will come to pass you
[1:23:28] can have what you've said what happens
[1:23:30] when two omnipotents meet when God and
[1:23:33] man come together to omnipotent
[1:23:35] something's got to shake I mean whatever
[1:23:37] you'd say with that creative power of
[1:23:39] omnipotence of God knowing that he
[1:23:41] promised it and he said it in his word
[1:23:42] it creates a power that goes out yonder
[1:23:45] and brings things to pass things that is
[1:23:47] not it makes them as though they are
[1:23:48] because two omnipotents have met there
[1:23:50] he stands oh my isn't he wonderful I
[1:23:54] mean but notice now he says a man fully
[1:23:55] surrendered to God not just a man but a
[1:23:59] man fully surrendered to God Amen a man
[1:24:02] fully surrendered to God is ultimately
[1:24:05] he surrender to the fact that God is
[1:24:07] ultimately interested in forming him
[1:24:09] into his image of his word amen because
[1:24:13] we are ordained to be conformed to the
[1:24:15] image of his son right which is his word
[1:24:17] a man fully surrended to God realizes
[1:24:19] God's looking for his character in the
[1:24:21] people that's what he's looking for so
[1:24:23] whatever go through in life there's a
[1:24:25] purpose behind it that God would mold us
[1:24:27] and Forge us into His Image I mean that
[1:24:30] everything that happens no matter how
[1:24:31] dark how terrible it would make us
[1:24:33] better not bitter amen it would form the
[1:24:36] word in our lives amen because character
[1:24:38] is made through
[1:24:39] suffering we can't get away from it amen
[1:24:43] you say well I thought this was the good
[1:24:45] news it is the good news it's the best
[1:24:47] news cuz why cuz when you've come
[1:24:49] through the valley you're up on the
[1:24:50] mountain you can see what you were and
[1:24:52] see what you are and what you are Was
[1:24:54] Made In His Image amen what you were
[1:24:56] maybe you weren't like Joseph he wasn't
[1:24:58] made to rule as a as a spoiled favorite
[1:25:01] son he he could never go to Egypt and
[1:25:04] you know have the wisdom and things he
[1:25:06] did no no way he would have made his
[1:25:08] brothers pay big time but you see that
[1:25:13] character was formed in him through
[1:25:14] everyday life that he went through
[1:25:16] because he because he began to realize
[1:25:18] Lord you've got to get me fit to
[1:25:20] rule amen so a man that's fully or a man
[1:25:23] or woman that's fully surrender to God
[1:25:25] realizes that God is looking for
[1:25:27] character he's looking for his character
[1:25:29] his nature in US amen a man fully
[1:25:31] surrender to God is fully surrender to
[1:25:33] the fact that God is in
[1:25:35] control amen they're fully surrender to
[1:25:37] the fact that God's word is is him he's
[1:25:40] not separated from his word and it fully
[1:25:43] surrendered to the fact that he is a
[1:25:44] child of God remember a birth gives you
[1:25:46] Dominion not what you know in the Garden
[1:25:49] of Eden God birthed Adam and Eve right
[1:25:52] made them gave them Dominion because of
[1:25:54] what they were what God made them but
[1:25:56] then the serpent came along and said
[1:25:58] look you'll be like God if you know this
[1:26:00] so the devil wants to give you knowledge
[1:26:02] and think if you know enough then you'll
[1:26:03] have dominion but God says no by birth I
[1:26:06] give you Dominion I mean by birth by by
[1:26:09] by being born again you have
[1:26:12] dominion amen that could be a whole
[1:26:13] another thing amen a man fully surrender
[1:26:15] to God is fully surrender to the fact
[1:26:17] that though I walk through the valley of
[1:26:19] the shadow of death I'll fear no evil
[1:26:21] amen that's fully stren to the fact that
[1:26:23] though he slay me I'll trust him that's
[1:26:26] someone who's fully surrendered to
[1:26:28] God Amen they're fully surrendered to
[1:26:30] the fact that all things work together
[1:26:32] for
[1:26:33] good
[1:26:35] amen praise God now so someone who's
[1:26:38] fully surrender to God is
[1:26:41] omnipotent so it's when it's when the
[1:26:43] word goes it's not in their head anymore
[1:26:45] it comes into their heart and when it
[1:26:47] anchors in the heart it's a revelation
[1:26:50] and it's
[1:26:51] so amen praise the Lord Lord that's why
[1:26:54] we have that's why we try and build
[1:26:57] faith we create an atmosphere to build
[1:26:59] Faith that's why we sing Victorious
[1:27:01] songs you never see brother Isaac stand
[1:27:03] up there and sing I can't make
[1:27:06] it we won't win enjoy the tribulation
[1:27:09] that's where we'll swim no he doesn't he
[1:27:11] doesn't he doesn't do those kind of we
[1:27:13] don't sing those songs no cuz why no I'm
[1:27:17] thinking of the Rapture in my blessed
[1:27:20] home on you see why you know I'm I'm a
[1:27:23] mighty warrior feel in battle right
[1:27:25] because it builds faith it creates an
[1:27:27] atmosphere of faith and the idea of that
[1:27:29] is that your heart will agree with what
[1:27:31] the atmosphere that's been created amen
[1:27:34] and then what happens then then two
[1:27:36] omnipotence can meet and the
[1:27:38] supernatural can take place hallelujah
[1:27:41] it's like Christine before Camp even
[1:27:42] during Camp she had this look in her
[1:27:44] eyes said I want to see someone really
[1:27:45] changed and I realized that wasn't her
[1:27:48] she gets this
[1:27:50] look I realize that's not her talking
[1:27:55] and then and then of course Ezekiel
[1:27:56] comes and he's a different kind of a man
[1:27:59] now praise God and then the Lord and
[1:28:02] then Chris is talking to the Lord about
[1:28:03] this after camp and the Lord said to her
[1:28:05] it wasn't you praying that it wasn't
[1:28:06] even your desire it was God's desire see
[1:28:09] but God's desire dropped into one of his
[1:28:11] surrendered vessels and he spoke it and
[1:28:14] it happened the six sense took control
[1:28:17] CED an atmosphere of camp for Faith to
[1:28:19] rise sure many things happened there but
[1:28:21] that was one thing God said I want that
[1:28:23] it's it's his season I want him to come
[1:28:26] hallelujah it's what happened someone
[1:28:28] fully surrender to God is omnip potent
[1:28:30] something's got to shake Hallelujah we
[1:28:33] got to realize that same faith is in you
[1:28:35] and I amen but you got to hold up that
[1:28:37] Shield of Faith walk forward bash the
[1:28:40] enemy down cut his head off with the
[1:28:42] sword of the word I mean don't sit there
[1:28:44] defensively saying am I going to make it
[1:28:45] and try and no you got to advance I mean
[1:28:48] take that Revelation I'm looking I'm not
[1:28:50] looking at the enemy like there was a
[1:28:51] brother Andrew Glover look beyond the
[1:28:53] devil look beyond the devil look to the
[1:28:55] promise how can I do that hold up the
[1:28:57] Revelation in your heart and look
[1:28:59] through that and you'll see things
[1:29:01] happen how what the faith that's in you
[1:29:04] will come out and take
[1:29:06] Dominion
[1:29:08] hallelujah amen let's um let's just
[1:29:11] pause there I just want to put this up
[1:29:12] one more oh wait I can't put it there
[1:29:15] let's have the musicians come you want
[1:29:17] to see Goliath
[1:29:19] down carry that Shield of
[1:29:21] Revelation in summary
[1:29:24] think positive thoughts discern the
[1:29:27] voice that's talking to you if it's
[1:29:29] making you doubt it's not bringing you
[1:29:31] to a conclusion making you frustrated
[1:29:34] that's not
[1:29:35] God okay but if it brings you to a
[1:29:37] conclusion gives you a peace gives you a
[1:29:39] confidence stabilizes you gives your way
[1:29:42] out that's god listen to his voice okay
[1:29:46] and look and if you're getting
[1:29:47] frustrated realize you're not looking
[1:29:49] through a shield you're not looking
[1:29:51] through the shield of Faith you're
[1:29:53] looking through through carnal
[1:29:55] eyes Okay so realize that cuz as soon as
[1:29:57] you start feeling frustrated oh I got to
[1:29:59] pick the shield up again then you'll see
[1:30:01] things
[1:30:02] differently and we'll see trophies
