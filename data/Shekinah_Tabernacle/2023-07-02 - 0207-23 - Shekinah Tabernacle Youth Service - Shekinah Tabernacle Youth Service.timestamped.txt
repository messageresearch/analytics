[29:06] dear Lord Jesus and may you just every
[29:08] life just be be touched Heavenly Father
[29:10] may we will just be truly blessed
[29:12] thankful this um being an amate dear
[29:14] Lord and the only father we can all just
[29:16] receive receive a blessing praise the
[29:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[29:21] musicians
[29:26] amen
[29:31] we just turned into our Bibles to um
[29:34] Acts 2 38
[29:37] and this afternoon I will be speaking
[29:40] about baptism
[29:42] amen so it says here an ax
[29:46] chapter 2 verse 38 says
[29:49] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[29:53] baptized every one of you in the name of
[29:56] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[29:58] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[30:01] Holy Ghost
[30:02] I mean
[30:04] so it's so we know that to be saved you
[30:06] must be baptized
[30:08] amen and
[30:10] and the Lord Jesus says here in Mark 16
[30:12] 16.
[30:13] he says he that believeth and is
[30:16] baptized shall be saved
[30:18] but he that believeth not shall be
[30:20] damned amen so he that believeth and is
[30:22] baptized shall be saved amen so to be
[30:26] saved you need to be to be baptized the
[30:27] brother Branham says
[30:29] here now remember you're just
[30:32] accepted Christ see now God will give
[30:35] you the Holy Ghost and confirmation of
[30:38] your faith see now you get to some good
[30:40] Full Gospel Church and be baptized right
[30:43] away
[30:45] and God's on under obligation to give
[30:47] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[30:49] moment that you're baptized amen if you
[30:52] come with a True Heart leaving Peter
[30:54] said just repent and be baptized and you
[30:57] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[31:00] is that right God promised that now he'd
[31:03] make everything right amen you may all
[31:05] be seated
[31:07] amen and all those who receive the Holy
[31:10] Ghost before they were baptized would
[31:13] have to be baptized later on to fulfill
[31:15] the the scriptures amen
[31:19] I mean and now we're going to move on to
[31:22] where it says in Acts 258 Peter um talks
[31:26] about remission of sins and we know that
[31:29] remission means forgiveness amen and in
[31:32] Acts 22 16
[31:36] this is um ananias he's speaking to Paul
[31:38] and he says and why terrius thou arise
[31:42] and be baptized and wash away thy sins
[31:45] amen so his sins are being being
[31:47] forgiven calling on the name of the Lord
[31:51] I mean
[31:52] so
[31:54] when you're being baptized you know
[31:57] you're um your your before your
[32:00] submission that what do you know you're
[32:01] you're asking the Lord to to forgive you
[32:04] amen and so that your your he can wash
[32:06] away your sins and then when you get get
[32:09] underneath that water it's like you
[32:11] you're dying to yourself you want to die
[32:13] to your old life and when you come back
[32:15] you are living and you to Christ amen
[32:18] and this types of the burial and
[32:20] resurrection of Christ and then this is
[32:22] found in Romans six and three it says
[32:25] know ye not that so many of us were
[32:27] baptized unto Jesus Christ we're
[32:30] baptized unto his death
[32:33] therefore we are buried with him by
[32:35] baptism unto death that like as Christ
[32:38] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[32:40] of the father even so we also should
[32:43] walk in newness of life
[32:45] for if we have been planted together in
[32:47] the likeness of death we shall be also
[32:50] in the likeness of his resurrection
[32:53] amen
[32:55] so and and also you know we need we so
[32:57] like I just said you know we need to
[32:58] repent and ask the Lord and then you
[33:00] know the Lord will come and wash out our
[33:02] sins he will give us us remission for
[33:06] our sins
[33:07] I mean I'll move on and so you need to
[33:11] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[33:13] very important
[33:15] amen
[33:16] can't be like the denominations who
[33:19] believe is in three Gods God is one God
[33:21] with titles I mean
[33:23] there won't be three people in heaven
[33:28] and
[33:30] we go to we can look at Matthew 28 19
[33:33] and the Lord Jesus is here go ye
[33:36] therefore and teach All Nations
[33:38] baptizing them in the name of the father
[33:41] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[33:44] amen and brother Branham says here
[33:48] the only way that they were commissioned
[33:50] to be baptized was go and teach All
[33:53] Nations
[33:55] he said back there and baptized them
[33:57] into the name not in the name into the
[33:59] name father son
[34:01] Holy Spirit and the disciples turned
[34:04] right around and baptized everybody in
[34:06] the name of Jesus Christ
[34:08] amen
[34:09] and commissioned that if anybody had
[34:11] been baptized any other way you had to
[34:13] come and be re-baptized again before
[34:15] they could get the Holy Ghost
[34:17] I mean and there were some people who
[34:21] John had baptized and they had to go
[34:24] get baptized again and brother and also
[34:26] speaks about it he says and some of the
[34:28] people will read in the moment
[34:30] that were baptized by immersing by John
[34:33] the Baptist just unto repentance not for
[34:36] remission of sins they had to come and
[34:39] be re-baptized over again in the name of
[34:42] Jesus Christ
[34:44] in order to receive the Holy Ghost amen
[34:46] so that is very important
[34:48] to always be baptized name of Jesus
[34:51] Christ amen
[34:53] and now we'll move on to you need to be
[34:55] fully immersed in water when you are
[34:58] baptized amen
[35:00] and um
[35:02] we know that word immerse means to put
[35:05] something or someone completely under
[35:07] the surface of a liquid
[35:09] amen
[35:10] um
[35:11] brother Branham says it here
[35:14] and I said since early days that you all
[35:18] have changed it you have substituted
[35:20] sprinkling or pouring for immersion
[35:23] amen and just just an example of immerse
[35:27] um who he knows Michael Maloney just
[35:30] just all of you know I mean he was um
[35:31] wait I used to play with him when I was
[35:33] quite young we just um
[35:34] when I was about five or six they had a
[35:36] big pedicle it was full of sheep and
[35:38] anyways they were all and we were trying
[35:40] to write them
[35:41] and anyways sheep will kind of move
[35:43] together they all move in a like a line
[35:45] it's like a train and there may be three
[35:47] aside you know they're and in a row and
[35:49] there'll be like 10 lines of three and
[35:51] they'll just all follow each other
[35:52] anyways poor little Michael would manage
[35:54] to get in front of this moving train of
[35:56] sheep and he got shot on and they ran
[35:58] completely over the top of them but in
[36:00] that it was probably about six seconds
[36:01] that he was underneath all those sheep
[36:02] he was fully submerged under them
[36:04] couldn't stick his hand up you know he
[36:06] was just fully trapped I mean
[36:09] that should be like us in the water you
[36:10] know we can't even snug a hand up we're
[36:12] just fully immersed amen
[36:15] I mean and we also know that we need it
[36:19] needs to be water amen or
[36:21] amen and um John 1 31 says and I knew
[36:25] him not that he shall be made manifest
[36:27] to Israel therefore am I come baptizing
[36:31] with water amen
[36:33] and in Acts 8 36
[36:36] and as they went on their way they came
[36:38] unto a certain water
[36:40] and the eunuch said see here is water
[36:43] what doth
[36:45] hinder me to be baptized amen so all we
[36:48] need is some water
[36:49] amen
[36:52] and um we'll move on to you need to be
[36:55] old enough to be baptized
[36:59] amen a baby although they are born in
[37:02] sin they aren't conscious of it until
[37:03] they reach the age of accountability so
[37:07] the baby doesn't know that he needs
[37:09] forgiving and brother Bradham ties it up
[37:11] quite nicely he says so the child is too
[37:14] young to be baptized the baptism is the
[37:17] outward expression that an inward work
[37:19] of Grace has been done and the child
[37:22] cannot express it
[37:24] because there hasn't been any inward
[37:26] work of Grace you see because it's just
[37:29] a baby
[37:31] I mean so I trust you're truly blessed
[37:34] and then
[37:36] if we could just have up the musicians
[37:37] and
[37:41] I mean
[37:43] um quicker will just stand stand to our
[37:45] feet if anyone would like to be um I'll
[37:48] grow stand to our feet if anyone would
[37:50] like to be remembered in prayer
[37:53] if you have a need on your heart that
[37:55] you would like the Lord to come to come
[37:56] touch would you just just raise the hand
[37:59] to the Lord

[38:08] any needs on any on the on the hearts of

[42:40] into everything that you have for us
[42:41] Lord
[42:42] we thank you Lord in Jesus name amen
[42:49] I mean it just turned our Bibles to um
[42:52] so let's get my slides up
[42:58] uh just to uh John 10 verse 1.
[43:04] uh it's probably going to be a little
[43:06] bit of a different youth service but I
[43:07] believe it'll be a blessing anyway
[43:10] so uh
[43:11] um just John 10 verse 1.
[43:22] the Bible says verily verily I say unto
[43:25] you he that entereth not by the door
[43:27] into the Sheepfold but climath up some
[43:30] other way the same as a thief and a
[43:32] robber
[43:34] but he's interested in by the door as
[43:36] The Shepherd of the Sheep
[43:38] to whom the portal openeth and the sheep
[43:41] hear his voice and he calleth his own
[43:43] Sheep by name and leadeth him out
[43:45] and when he put his Force forth his own
[43:48] sheep he goeth before him and the Sheep
[43:50] follow him for they know his voice
[43:52] and the stranger they will not follow
[43:54] but will flee from him for they know not
[43:56] the voice of strangers
[43:59] amen
[44:02] you can have your seats
[44:08] laughs
[44:10] just have to stop my tablet out I put it
[44:12] on power saving mode just before I came
[44:14] up here and let's just change everything
[44:26] just there we go
[44:32] I mean I just want to speak this
[44:33] afternoon about God's wisdom versus
[44:35] Satan's wisdom
[44:37] and and we can see in this in this verse
[44:40] in what we just read it says
[44:44] and the Sheep follow him for they know
[44:46] his voice and the strangers they will
[44:48] not follow
[44:50] and just a little bit further down on
[44:52] that same uh scripture reading it says
[44:55] the thief cometh not but forth is still
[44:57] steel and to kill and to destroy I am
[45:01] come that they might have life and that
[45:02] they might have it more abundantly
[45:06] and uh so
[45:09] you know there's a provided Way by God
[45:11] through his life for each one of us as
[45:13] we know and that's his word he sent his
[45:16] word the Bible said Thy word is a lamp
[45:18] unto my feet and a light unto my path
[45:21] and man to not live by bread alone but
[45:24] by every word but that proceedeth from
[45:25] the mouth of God
[45:27] and and I believe that's his voice like
[45:29] that scripture said
[45:35] uh we hear his voice and not a strangers
[45:39] but you know
[45:40] and Satan is the thief and easy out to
[45:43] kill and to destroy and you know if God
[45:46] has a voice Satan is right there he also
[45:48] has a voice
[45:49] and
[45:50] it's just this nature that's what he
[45:52] does he breaks down any
[45:53] any work of God anywhere where God is
[45:56] moving he'll try and break it down
[46:01] and uh brother Ben tells the story I'm
[46:04] sure you all know it we're
[46:06] um
[46:07] where he saw a vision of the man going
[46:10] around the earth well um I believe it
[46:12] was an angel or or or or the Lord sowing
[46:15] seeds walking around the earth sowing
[46:17] seeds and and just after the man came
[46:21] another man dressed in black sort of
[46:23] dodging around the earth real sneaky
[46:25] also sowing seeds and he was sowing
[46:28] weeds and tears trying to break down
[46:30] what what God was doing
[46:36] and the sermon wisdom versus Faith
[46:38] Barbarian talks about how the devil
[46:40] tries to undermine God's word by
[46:42] offering his wisdom against God's wisdom
[46:44] God will say God will speak the word and
[46:48] Satan will offer his wisdom against it
[46:52] I'll just read this quote on the
[46:55] downstairs now of course anything that
[46:57] the devil has is a perversion of the
[46:59] original sin is a perversional
[47:01] perversion of righteousness adultery is
[47:04] a perversion of a legal act a lie is a
[47:07] version of Truth and so the wisdom that
[47:10] I want you to get straightened out on
[47:11] before we start there is a wisdom of God
[47:13] a wisdom of God is stay with his word
[47:16] but Satan and his wisdom try to twist
[47:19] the word
[47:20] so that's the wisdom I'm speaking of
[47:23] there's a certain amount of faith that
[47:24] goes with Satan in order to accept Satan
[47:26] you've got to believe Satan so there's a
[47:29] perverted Faith to a perverted thing and
[47:31] anything that would try and twist the
[47:33] word of God to make it say something
[47:34] that it doesn't is the wrong Spirit see
[47:37] offering wisdom against God's wisdom
[47:41] and uh and that's just the way it was in
[47:43] the beginning with Adam and Eve
[47:45] Satan presented his wisdom with the
[47:48] truth with God's word and but with a
[47:51] slight twist and that twist
[47:54] that twist was a lie and he was trying
[47:56] to pervert it to make it say something
[47:58] that it that it wasn't saying
[48:03] and in the beginning we
[48:05] um where the Bible speaks about where
[48:07] the dragon drew the third part of the
[48:09] stars from heaven and brother Graham
[48:12] says
[48:12] uh the Bible talks about the tale of the
[48:15] dragon and brother Brandon explains it
[48:17] it's not like a physical tale that he
[48:19] drew the stars from the heavens it's the
[48:21] tale that he told and and the Bible
[48:24] speaks about how the devil is a liar and
[48:28] the father of Lies so anything that he
[48:31] offers against God's wisdom is a lie and
[48:34] some and just the way he does it he
[48:36] tries to hide it and make it sometimes
[48:39] make it seem to you that God's speaking
[48:42] to you but it's not wow
[48:48] and Isaiah it says
[48:50] how thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer
[48:52] son of the morning how thou cut down to
[48:54] the ground which did weakened the
[48:56] Nations for they always said in thine
[48:58] heart I will descend and Ascend into
[49:00] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[49:02] stars of God I will also sit upon the
[49:05] Mount of the congregation in the size of
[49:07] the north so we can see his intention
[49:09] and the spirit in in behind him coming
[49:13] to you and offering his wisdom against
[49:15] God's wisdom
[49:19] in the greatest battle ever fought by
[49:21] the Realms is this great first battle
[49:23] that was ever fought begin in heaven
[49:25] when Michael and his angels fought
[49:27] against Lucifer and his angels and
[49:29] that's when Satan told his tail and Drew
[49:31] the angels
[49:34] it first started the first battle was in
[49:36] heaven so sin did not originate on Earth
[49:39] it originated in heaven
[49:42] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[49:43] cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell
[49:45] on human beings then the battle from
[49:48] Angels became human battles and Satan
[49:51] comes to destroy God's creation what to
[49:54] create what God had created to be for
[49:56] himself
[49:57] he said Satan he had Satan come to
[50:00] destroy this that's what his purpose was
[50:03] was to destroy it in the battle begin
[50:06] here on Earth and begin in us and has
[50:08] been raging ever since
[50:23] yeah so um yeah so we can see um how
[50:27] Satan at the beginning tried to
[50:28] undermine faith in God's word by
[50:30] approaching Eve and offering his wisdom
[50:32] against God's wisdom
[50:35] and as we said before he he quoted the
[50:39] truth to her but he twisted it yeah to
[50:41] to his ends
[50:44] to give you a message that's not the
[50:46] intent of what God spoke but it's still
[50:48] sort of in line with what God was saying
[50:55] but it's a lie
[50:58] and uh you know we can see this all
[51:00] through the the Bible how this this
[51:03] battle between wisdom and Faith rage
[51:05] down Through the Ages
[51:08] uh down to Moses time
[51:11] Moses preached the word of God and Satan
[51:13] offered his wisdom against it and
[51:17] um when when the Lord created all the
[51:19] plagues through Moses in Egypt
[51:22] uh the Bible talks about how The
[51:24] Magicians could do the same so Moses
[51:28] created frogs and The Magicians did the
[51:30] same
[51:30] Moses turned the water into blood and
[51:32] The Magicians did the same but there
[51:34] came a point where where they couldn't
[51:37] keep up with the Miracles of God and um
[51:40] and yeah Satan's lie broke down like the
[51:43] truth will always Prevail and
[51:46] yeah right right down Through the Ages
[51:48] there's been this battle through wisdom
[51:50] and faith and
[51:53] and in our lives
[51:55] it comes a lot closer to home because
[51:58] it's right here where it happens that
[52:00] battle between wisdom and faith is right
[52:01] here
[52:03] it comes that's that's that's where it's
[52:05] like we read before where brother Brown
[52:07] said
[52:08] um the battle starts in the human mind
[52:11] that's where that all between wisdom and
[52:13] Faith happens is right there
[52:17] amen
[52:22] and the bearings win this great battle
[52:24] had started on Earth there had to be a
[52:27] mutual meeting place there had to be a
[52:29] place selected for the battle to begin
[52:32] we might have read that
[52:33] I'll just skip down to the yellow
[52:36] there is where the battle starts the
[52:38] human mind was chosen for the place of
[52:40] the battle where it was to begin and
[52:43] that is because the decisions are made
[52:45] from the mind the head
[52:46] and a bit further down
[52:51] because the Battlegrounds where you've
[52:52] got to meet your enemy is in the mind
[52:54] you've got to make your choice it meets
[52:57] you
[52:57] you don't even you don't even go looking
[53:00] for it but it will meet you the battle
[53:01] will meet you there
[53:03] and uh
[53:04] you know I guess that battle offers well
[53:07] it starts out for any believer or
[53:10] non-believer as am I gonna believe this
[53:12] am I gonna give my life to Christ and
[53:15] once you have the devil doesn't stop he
[53:18] will he can be a born-again safe
[53:19] believer but he will keep attacking you
[53:22] in your mind
[53:23] to make you live and defeat love you
[53:26] below your privileges as a Christian
[53:30] and you know I'm sure any Christian
[53:33] that's been a Christian for a while has
[53:34] experienced these mind battles and it's
[53:36] probably
[53:36] for someone in the world I don't think
[53:38] they maybe experienced it the same way
[53:40] we do because anything goes in the world
[53:42] but as a Christian anything doesn't just
[53:44] go for you yeah
[53:49] and you know the devil studies our
[53:52] natures
[53:53] and he attacks our weak spots brother
[53:54] Brown talks about those weak spots that
[53:56] we've got to keep covered and he studies
[53:58] he studies your nature and he'll he'll
[54:01] find that weak spot and try and exploit
[54:03] it but my man he's defeated and uh
[54:07] and yeah he's nothing was he's nothing
[54:10] but a bluff
[54:13] I just want to read you something here
[54:16] um
[54:16] what about the brand of interviews um
[54:18] sister Bruce she had some questions on
[54:21] her heart I'm sure a lot of you probably
[54:22] have read this already
[54:25] um
[54:32] I believe with all my heart that you
[54:34] were a real Born Again believer sister
[54:36] Bruce how could that Spirit just leave
[54:38] when you get sick you get weary and
[54:40] you're a nervous type person
[54:43] and you just get things on your mind see
[54:45] little bitty things and it just keeps
[54:46] building up both ways you'll get
[54:49] somebody in your heart and you want to
[54:50] pray for them get up and pray for it you
[54:52] can't rest until you get that person
[54:54] prayed for that's you then take on the
[54:57] other side Satan Maybe Might present
[55:00] something to you out this way he'll take
[55:02] it overboard
[55:03] I think God you're a nature and God
[55:06] works and Satan works and then when
[55:08] Satan tries to make you believe that you
[55:10] are not
[55:11] you see you keep building this
[55:13] and maybe this and this don't look at
[55:15] yourself Mr Bruce but yeah that's what I
[55:18] the point I want to make is you urinate
[55:22] so you're both a certain way and God
[55:24] works with that nature and Satan works
[55:26] with that nature against God's word
[55:29] sure
[55:35] and uh you know I'm not just going to
[55:37] keep talking about Satan because he's
[55:39] defeated but we just want to expose him
[55:42] um and you know he is the master of Mind
[55:45] Games how could he deceive even the
[55:48] beginning so convincingly that it caused
[55:51] this fall everything we see on this
[55:53] Earth today everything wrong but he did
[55:55] it
[55:58] and he he will present things his way to
[56:02] grind you as a Believer into the ground
[56:04] and he will he will he'll present his
[56:06] narrative with his twist
[56:11] just
[56:12] um as an example one why he attacks me
[56:14] and I'm sure a lot of other believers as
[56:18] well all of us is he'll come to you and
[56:20] you'll point out your weaknesses and
[56:21] your failures it'll say see see what you
[56:24] did yeah
[56:25] um you you can't approach God you can't
[56:27] take a promise you can't you maybe
[56:30] you're struggling with something you
[56:31] can't you can't approach God look what
[56:32] look at look at your life and
[56:35] and the thing is that's a lie yeah
[56:37] because
[56:38] you know
[56:40] you're a born-again Believer your desire
[56:43] is to serve God with all your heart
[56:46] and you know
[56:48] he died for our iniquities too he didn't
[56:51] just die for other sins he died for
[56:53] iniquity and iniquity is you know what's
[56:55] right and you don't do it or you know
[56:59] something is wrong and you still do it
[57:00] he died for that too
[57:03] um
[57:04] I don't have the quote up there but I
[57:06] was reading where brother Brown says
[57:08] um
[57:10] you know the blood covers Us God hears
[57:13] our voice he doesn't see us he sees the
[57:16] blood of Christ and he hears our voice
[57:18] amen so all those things are under the
[57:20] blood all right and and we have access
[57:23] to him
[57:24] and another thing is
[57:25] it it might sound I don't know how this
[57:28] sounds but it's true we think that way
[57:30] like
[57:31] um you know God is not there with a
[57:34] stick ready to beat you every time
[57:35] you're wrong
[57:36] every time we do something wrong and it
[57:39] sounds it sounds funny but that's the
[57:42] way we often think
[57:44] um
[57:45] he's our father and and and you know we
[57:48] don't have to be condemned by every
[57:51] little thing yeah that we stumble
[57:55] a Believer has access to God
[58:06] well the random season assuming here the
[58:09] price the price that was paid and the
[58:11] bondage of Satan was broke God put back
[58:14] into the hands of man away back to what
[58:16] he was looking for he had to weep no
[58:18] more hit when he was broke when he when
[58:22] he broke the backbone of Satan there at
[58:23] Calvary the backbone of sin of sickness
[58:26] and it brings every Mortal being on the
[58:28] earth back into the presence of God with
[58:30] sins forgiven hallelujah our sins are
[58:33] forgiven no more can Satan black us off
[58:36] from God Amen there's a highway made
[58:38] there's a telephone sitting there
[58:39] there's a line to Glory because every
[58:42] person in reach of that line
[58:44] if a man is full of sin and connected
[58:47] him on Central he can't be he can be
[58:49] forgiven of it so not only that but sin
[58:52] is paid for oh you don't have to say I'm
[58:54] not worthy sure you're not you never
[58:57] could be but a worthy one took your
[58:59] place you are free you don't have to
[59:01] wonder anymore amen you don't have to be
[59:03] a patient seeking a pleasure seeking man
[59:05] out here on the Earth
[59:10] I just wanna I just want to read you a
[59:12] quote
[59:13] um
[59:16] I just want to go back again uh there's
[59:19] something I found quite amazing
[59:23] so here's the sister that went to um
[59:26] what went up in one of the prayer
[59:27] meetings of brother branham's and I
[59:29] think it's in the servant deep nodes
[59:31] might be a different sermon but um
[59:34] but she came up to the prayer line and
[59:37] I'll just read it
[59:39] no we'll be strangers I see that you're
[59:41] strictly a stranger to me you're from
[59:43] away from here you've come from another
[59:45] city you've got a lot of trouble in your
[59:48] heart
[59:49] and you've got heart trouble to begin
[59:51] with
[59:53] is that right there's a whole lot of
[59:55] Blackness I see a black sheep keep
[59:57] following you like that oh it's a lie
[59:59] someone told a lie on you and that was a
[1:00:02] man that was professing Divine Healing
[1:00:05] you said you were a witch is that true
[1:00:07] and you've got a holster in your church
[1:00:09] or something another about it isn't that
[1:00:11] right your pastor's sick right now he's
[1:00:14] got bolio is that right sister don't pay
[1:00:17] no attention to what them people tell
[1:00:18] you they're lying and the only thing
[1:00:21] that's wrong with you your heart is that
[1:00:23] nervous condition got your heart all
[1:00:24] worked up go on home in peace and God
[1:00:27] bless you you're right God bless you
[1:00:29] you're not a witch yeah
[1:00:31] and
[1:00:32] isn't it amazing how this sister had a
[1:00:35] heart trouble
[1:00:36] she had a whole nervous breakdown
[1:00:38] because of a lie yeah
[1:00:40] yeah Satan was offering something
[1:00:42] against what the word said she was yeah
[1:00:44] yeah and she didn't know how to find it
[1:00:46] but she believed it and and and brother
[1:00:49] bam says
[1:00:50] I see a whole lot of Blackness it's like
[1:00:52] a black sheep following you in in heart
[1:00:55] trouble
[1:00:55] but it was all a lie yeah and
[1:00:59] and
[1:01:01] I mean and and in our lives and our
[1:01:03] minds Satan can attack us on certain on
[1:01:06] certain things
[1:01:07] but it's a lie
[1:01:09] and he'll he'll pose as God because he
[1:01:13] know he can't just uh straight out deny
[1:01:16] the Lord and say
[1:01:19] um
[1:01:20] say something against us would you
[1:01:21] recognize him but he will admit the word
[1:01:24] and he says but like for example that
[1:01:27] condemnation he had missed the word but
[1:01:28] no you can't take it because you because
[1:01:31] look at what you did yesterday
[1:01:33] um
[1:01:35] oh
[1:01:40] and the thing is one thing it's amazing
[1:01:43] also is
[1:01:44] you know he'll plant a little seed in
[1:01:46] your mind somewhere in your life maybe
[1:01:48] maybe just recently but you don't
[1:01:50] because you don't know how to fight it
[1:01:52] and you don't recognize it it grows
[1:01:55] and
[1:01:56] and it grows it because it wasn't rooted
[1:01:58] out straight away you start thinking on
[1:02:01] it and you start thinking on it you
[1:02:02] become negative your brain starts
[1:02:04] releasing negative chemicals and you're
[1:02:06] before you know it you're right and that
[1:02:08] downward spiral that he's trying to
[1:02:10] catch you with instead of at the start
[1:02:12] recognizing for what he is
[1:02:14] but let me ask you what delivered that
[1:02:17] sister it was when that lie was exposed
[1:02:20] yeah
[1:02:21] and when that lie was exposed
[1:02:24] he had nowhere to hide and and she was
[1:02:26] free that's all it was like that heart
[1:02:29] trouble everything was a lie she just
[1:02:31] had to recognize and see that it was a
[1:02:32] lie
[1:02:33] and uh you know
[1:02:35] because it's such a real battle in our
[1:02:37] minds it can be hard but but the law can
[1:02:41] expose any lie and um yeah I believe
[1:02:44] that
[1:02:48] brother Branham says that overcoming is
[1:02:51] recognizing the devil in every one of
[1:02:52] his tricks yeah every one of us tricks
[1:02:54] how he gets you on your little weak
[1:02:56] spots that you've got to keep covered
[1:02:59] and when you recognize that attack you
[1:03:02] can fight against it and say no I choose
[1:03:03] faith faith in what the word says above
[1:03:05] the situation that I'm finding myself in
[1:03:10] and uh I won't keep talking about the
[1:03:12] devil but um but he's he's defeated
[1:03:16] um
[1:03:20] and and one way I've realized to
[1:03:22] recognize the devil's condemnation as
[1:03:25] opposed to the Lord's conviction is has
[1:03:28] condemnation drives you into the ground
[1:03:29] it leaves you no way of escape and you
[1:03:33] you don't know you don't know up from
[1:03:34] down left from right that's anything
[1:03:37] where those vibes is not of God
[1:03:41] and brother Adam says both of these
[1:03:43] sources God's was God's faith and
[1:03:45] Satan's wisdom will create an atmosphere
[1:03:47] so if you give in to Satan's wisdom that
[1:03:50] is offering against God's faith it will
[1:03:52] create an atmosphere
[1:03:54] and uh may the Lord help us to remain in
[1:03:57] the right atmosphere it can be so hard
[1:03:58] but brother bears in the right
[1:04:00] atmosphere Eagles will be born and
[1:04:03] obviously the negative is also true the
[1:04:06] opposite is also true
[1:04:11] and uh you know I just pray that the
[1:04:14] Lord reveals his heart to us because
[1:04:18] um
[1:04:20] you know maybe it's the way you've been
[1:04:21] brought up or maybe there's something in
[1:04:23] your life that skewed your perception of
[1:04:25] who God is and what he is maybe it was a
[1:04:28] father that
[1:04:29] um
[1:04:29] that was very hard on you or something
[1:04:33] um and and or even just something along
[1:04:36] the way that was planted when you were a
[1:04:37] kid and now and later on in life it
[1:04:41] grows and you've got a skewed perception
[1:04:43] of what God's heart toward you really is
[1:04:48] foreign
[1:04:49] because
[1:04:52] like we said before he's he's he doesn't
[1:04:54] condemn you and drive you
[1:04:56] into the ground without a way of moving
[1:04:59] forward in Victory he he builds you up
[1:05:01] and he's your father and he wants you he
[1:05:03] wants you to overcome and to succeed and
[1:05:06] and you know
[1:05:09] the Bible says God doesn't ever present
[1:05:11] help in time of trouble
[1:05:13] and uh you know when
[1:05:16] I found it myself you know there's times
[1:05:18] where you you don't know up from down
[1:05:20] left from right but isn't it wonderful
[1:05:22] how we can go on our knees and ask the
[1:05:24] Lord help us Lord help me Lord and He
[1:05:27] will like Ben preached this morning
[1:05:30] um
[1:05:32] uh probably wasn't the same words but he
[1:05:35] won't leave you there he will not leave
[1:05:36] you there anyone that calls out to him
[1:05:38] he will he will he will lift you up
[1:05:46] and and I know it's not his desire it is
[1:05:49] his desire to um and his will to undo
[1:05:52] the complexes and things that hinderella
[1:05:55] walk with him is absolutely his desire
[1:05:57] that's why he he lays his finger on it
[1:05:59] sometimes it shows us
[1:06:01] and that's them starting to undo that
[1:06:03] stuff
[1:06:08] I believe will not leave us there
[1:06:11] um for the in the Bible it says full
[1:06:12] Iration racial not against flesh and
[1:06:14] blood but against principalities against
[1:06:17] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[1:06:19] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:06:22] in high places
[1:06:27] yeah so it's a it's a spiritual battle
[1:06:29] it's not a it's not a physical battle
[1:06:33] and uh to contact that the Bible says
[1:06:35] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:06:37] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:06:39] pulling down of strongholds spiritual
[1:06:41] strongholds strongholds in our minds
[1:06:43] casting down imaginations and every High
[1:06:46] thing that exalts itself against the
[1:06:48] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:06:49] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:06:51] of Christ
[1:06:53] I don't know how many of you have
[1:06:54] listened to brother Donnie Reagan's
[1:06:56] sermon uh facts versus faith
[1:06:59] but essentially the devil can show you
[1:07:01] the facts but the truth is God's word
[1:07:04] amen
[1:07:06] um
[1:07:07] and any imagination anything
[1:07:11] that's true that he points out but with
[1:07:14] a Twist to bring his message across
[1:07:16] instead is is wrong and we cast those
[1:07:19] things down and bring into captivity
[1:07:21] those thoughts to The Obedience of
[1:07:22] Christ
[1:07:25] and uh
[1:07:28] Madam says but you act in the moment
[1:07:31] that when nothing else can act we are
[1:07:33] given to know Lord that if we have any
[1:07:35] rivers that we cannot cross if we have
[1:07:37] any mountains we cannot go through God
[1:07:39] Specializes in doing things that others
[1:07:41] cannot do
[1:07:43] so no matter what the trouble whether it
[1:07:45] is
[1:07:46] whether it's uh
[1:07:48] what the trouble whether it's a family
[1:07:49] strain
[1:07:51] maybe stubbornness or temper or
[1:07:53] something that that just just enters
[1:07:55] your walk with God
[1:07:58] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:08:00] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:08:02] pulling down of strongholds
[1:08:13] for the Brown says what did it do God
[1:08:15] zeroed in on Calvary he wounded that
[1:08:17] animal called Satan forever now he's
[1:08:19] been more vicious since then because
[1:08:22] it's brought to light the human race
[1:08:25] and anyone knows that a wounded animal
[1:08:27] is most vicious crawling around with his
[1:08:30] back broken now Satan was knocked out at
[1:08:32] Calvary the Earth proved that it was
[1:08:34] amen he was knocked down
[1:08:38] he broke the backbone of sin of sickness
[1:08:40] of any spiritual trouble anything he
[1:08:43] broke the ability of Satan to keep us
[1:08:45] from seeing the truth his ability to
[1:08:48] hold us back through complexes and mind
[1:08:49] battles
[1:08:55] but button talks about this uh tells a
[1:08:58] story about the um Express agent
[1:09:00] bringing bringing a box of rattlesnakes
[1:09:02] to your door and that can be anything
[1:09:05] there can be anything it can be a
[1:09:07] sickness it can be something that you're
[1:09:08] struggling with a mind battle and uh
[1:09:12] he says what if someone came up in the
[1:09:14] morning to your door an Express agent
[1:09:16] and throw the whole basket full of
[1:09:18] rattlesnakes and had your name on them
[1:09:20] said here they are they're yours you
[1:09:22] know they're there just like you know
[1:09:23] your symptoms is there if you receive
[1:09:26] them they're yours
[1:09:27] but you don't have to take them you can
[1:09:29] say
[1:09:30] I don't want them say your names on them
[1:09:33] say I don't want them I don't have them
[1:09:36] he can stand there and argue as much as
[1:09:38] he wants to but until you take them and
[1:09:40] sign for them they belong to the express
[1:09:42] company until you sign for them don't
[1:09:44] sign for nothing the devil brings there
[1:09:46] is though I refuse to have it take it
[1:09:49] back you have nothing to do with it if
[1:09:52] you won't testify
[1:09:53] that you've got it when you justify you
[1:09:56] still have it your sickness the devil
[1:09:58] keeps it with you but refuse to testify
[1:10:01] of it say I won't have it no sir
[1:10:05] oh my that's when you're getting Faith
[1:10:06] give your faith a chance don't it loose
[1:10:09] on loose unbridled it let it work you've
[1:10:11] got it all bound down with Traditions
[1:10:13] turn it loose cut it Loose let God have
[1:10:16] his way with you somebody's word is
[1:10:18] right either what you're looking at or
[1:10:20] what God says God's word is true believe
[1:10:23] it all right but the first time you
[1:10:25] testify of your sickness it brings you
[1:10:27] right down to that realm again you sign
[1:10:29] for it refuse to sign for it testify
[1:10:32] what you believe
[1:10:37] oh I saw this thing on the uh the news
[1:10:40] the other day how Israel's got some sort
[1:10:43] of torpedo defense system that where if
[1:10:46] they send a torpedo
[1:10:48] to a sub when it reaches that sub it
[1:10:51] makes a torpedo turn around and go back
[1:10:52] to the southern centered and and and and
[1:10:55] blows up that sub that centered instead
[1:10:57] and and I believe it's the same way with
[1:11:01] with the Christian you know the devil
[1:11:03] will send us Torpedoes but we reverse
[1:11:05] the back and say no it's not mine and uh
[1:11:09] and you know he's gonna ask her for
[1:11:10] everything that he tried to do against
[1:11:12] the children of God
[1:11:14] out
[1:11:20] uh I'm not sure if I have the quote here
[1:11:23] but brother Brown spoke about
[1:11:25] um
[1:11:26] if
[1:11:27] a way to commit something to God if
[1:11:30] there's a trouble or something that
[1:11:32] you're facing
[1:11:37] um I don't have the quote but what he
[1:11:39] says
[1:11:39] um is if there's something whether it's
[1:11:42] stubbornness or a temper or whatever
[1:11:46] trouble it may be it might be fear
[1:11:47] whatever it may be
[1:11:49] he says to go to the law to lay it on
[1:11:53] the altar to give it to the Lord and
[1:11:56] then get up from there walk away believe
[1:11:58] that it's dead recognize that you don't
[1:12:00] have it anymore walk away
[1:12:03] consider it did and the thing will leave
[1:12:05] you
[1:12:07] and
[1:12:09] when you have committed it to God the
[1:12:10] symptoms probably will still be there
[1:12:12] just as hard as it ever was
[1:12:16] but they're like vanities
[1:12:18] and the moment you pick it up again is
[1:12:20] yours right but if you if you leave it
[1:12:23] there and you walk away God can take
[1:12:26] care of the symptoms
[1:12:35] where the ram says and you put a seed in
[1:12:38] the ground and the next morning you go
[1:12:40] out dig it up and say my corn ain't
[1:12:42] growing yet put it back cover it up the
[1:12:45] next morning
[1:12:46] I see if it's going again it will never
[1:12:49] go like that no every time you dig it up
[1:12:51] you delay it is that right what do you
[1:12:54] do you know the Earth was made to grow
[1:12:56] the corn is that right or the seed and
[1:12:59] you plant the seed competitive the Earth
[1:13:00] and forget about it God does the rest of
[1:13:03] it
[1:13:04] well that's the way you do with the word
[1:13:06] of God you just plant it don't dig it up
[1:13:08] Just Keep On Believing it and commit it
[1:13:10] to God he makes it grow amen
[1:13:17] amen and the word of God is a seed and
[1:13:20] if you take God and His word you plant
[1:13:23] that seed you lay you lay it down if it
[1:13:26] will grow if you if you leave it and
[1:13:28] water it and let God allow God the
[1:13:31] chance to make it grow
[1:13:35] Jonah 2 verse 8 says they that observe
[1:13:38] lying vanities forsake their own Mercy I
[1:13:41] mean and they're just lying vanities
[1:13:46] symptoms that lying manatees don't
[1:13:48] receive them don't have nothing to do
[1:13:50] with him if you look to them you're
[1:13:51] looking away from God
[1:13:53] we look at the Unseen not at what we see
[1:13:55] no one could look at what they see and
[1:13:58] be a Christian
[1:13:59] that's that's pretty powerful
[1:14:03] you've got to believe the things that's
[1:14:04] unseen for us by faith that you were
[1:14:06] healed not by sight or by feeling
[1:14:09] amen
[1:14:18] sorry a lot of reading today
[1:14:23] but the RAM says and I thought that's
[1:14:25] just about the way it is with people
[1:14:27] though the devil will put some old
[1:14:29] scarecrow out there and scare every dove
[1:14:31] in the country away if he can or every
[1:14:33] Eagle I might say if possible yes sir
[1:14:36] he'll do some old scarecrow and get
[1:14:38] everyone afraid you see
[1:14:41] and but to my surprise right on the arm
[1:14:43] of that scarecrow set two big healthy
[1:14:45] Birds just eating blackberries or
[1:14:47] strawberries
[1:14:48] do who wouldn't have it see and I
[1:14:51] thought that's right there's no
[1:14:52] condemnation to them that's in the patch
[1:14:54] that's one thing sure yes sir they why
[1:14:57] they didn't pay a bit more attention to
[1:14:59] that scarecrow than nothing
[1:15:00] they sit right there and just eat the
[1:15:03] same because it was strawberries and it
[1:15:04] was there for them
[1:15:06] and God blessed that man or woman who
[1:15:08] can walk around every unbelieving
[1:15:10] scarecrow that tries to point something
[1:15:12] this or that go right on into the patch
[1:15:15] because there's a good crop amen right
[1:15:18] in season to go into the pets now no
[1:15:20] condemnation to them big birds that can
[1:15:22] go right on him there and not be afraid
[1:15:24] of the Scarecrow amen
[1:15:27] uh somewhere around the mountain says uh
[1:15:30] when we one day in the Millennium we're
[1:15:32] going to sit below our juniper tree and
[1:15:34] we're going to laugh and we're going to
[1:15:36] be like how did I ever think I was not
[1:15:37] going to be I was not going to make it
[1:15:39] wow and and and it's it's true
[1:15:42] um you know we read earlier where
[1:15:45] brother Brandon sees the background of
[1:15:46] Satan was broken at Calvary yeah
[1:15:49] and everything
[1:15:51] that he's trying to put in front of you
[1:15:53] as a bluff as a scarecrow it's designed
[1:15:55] to keep you away from the good
[1:15:57] strawberries but he's yeah he's uh we
[1:16:00] can call his bluff
[1:16:05] and um just in closing I just want to
[1:16:08] give the developer
[1:16:11] and uh
[1:16:13] and just um just remind them and us
[1:16:16] where he's going with all his lies and
[1:16:20] and everything he's trying to do over
[1:16:22] the ages the Bible says how thou fallen
[1:16:25] from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[1:16:27] morning how are they'll cut down to the
[1:16:29] ground which did weaken the Nations for
[1:16:31] thou said in thine heart I was Ascend
[1:16:33] into heaven I will exalt my throne above
[1:16:36] the stars of God
[1:16:37] I will sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:16:39] congregation and the size of the North I
[1:16:42] will Ascend above the highest of the
[1:16:43] clouds I will be like the most high yet
[1:16:46] Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to
[1:16:48] the sides of the pit and the devil that
[1:16:51] deceived them was cast into the lake of
[1:16:53] fire and brimstone where the Beast and
[1:16:54] the false prophets are see and the devil
[1:16:57] that deceived them was cast into the
[1:17:00] Lake of Fire in Brimstone
[1:17:05] day and night forever and uh you know
[1:17:08] when he attacks me I remind him that's
[1:17:11] where you're going it's not where I'm
[1:17:12] going you're attacking me now but
[1:17:15] but this is not where I'm going

[1:29:12] you read through the book of Acts as
[1:29:13] many as believe or baptized you know and
[1:29:16] cornelius's house in Acts chapter 10
[1:29:18] they received the Holy Ghost like in the
[1:29:19] upper room they said can we forbid water
[1:29:21] saying they've received the Holy Ghost
[1:29:23] such as us so so you know Salvation and
[1:29:25] baptism is tied together because as many
[1:29:27] as believe were baptized and we know
[1:29:29] baptism as brother Dave said is a
[1:29:31] outward sign showing the inward work has
[1:29:34] been done so praise the Lord and
[1:29:36] straight As the gator Narrows the way so
[1:29:37] is it wonderful to enter into that gate
[1:29:39] and no brother Marion God bless you you
[1:29:41] know expose the devil expose them all
[1:29:44] day long you know it's like brother
[1:29:45] Graham said about the seals opening just
[1:29:47] it just strips them down expose them for
[1:29:49] what he is so you know I like that from
[1:29:51] Isaiah because it says there I don't
[1:29:52] know if you had the you keep reading
[1:29:54] down there it says and they that
[1:29:55] narrowly see him say is this the man
[1:29:57] that is weak the name weak in the
[1:29:59] Nations doesn't say everyone will see
[1:30:00] Satan for what he is but they're people
[1:30:02] who see him say is this really the guy
[1:30:04] that did all this and that's us because
[1:30:07] we see him for who he is in this day so
[1:30:09] amen so it's good to expose him and
[1:30:11] realize the Mind battles are they're
