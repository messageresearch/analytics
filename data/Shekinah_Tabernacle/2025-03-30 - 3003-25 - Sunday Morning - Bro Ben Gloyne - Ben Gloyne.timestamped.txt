[37:45] are revealed belong unto us and to our
[37:48] children forever that we may do all the
[37:51] words of this law amen let's bow heads

[38:58] their hearts dear God we thank you so
[39:00] much for this opportunity to be in your

[39:04] amen amen God bless you you can have
[39:06] your seats may the Lord bless the
[39:08] reading of his word this morning amen so
[39:10] I just want to speak about uh the secret
[39:14] that we
[39:15] carry you it's like a husband and wife
[39:17] there's a secret between them the the
[39:20] world may see certain aspects of it but
[39:22] it's the it's the relationship they have
[39:24] that only they share amen and then and
[39:27] so there's this Covenant that we have
[39:28] with the Lord you know I was thinking um
[39:31] about the you know the parable of the
[39:33] wise and foolish virgins how you know
[39:35] five had oil and five didn't so five was
[39:37] carrying a secret that only they knew
[39:40] that they had and um I'm so thankful
[39:42] that through the message of the hour God
[39:44] has released the Holy Ghost upon the
[39:45] people again amen that there is an oil
[39:48] there's a there's a there's an
[39:49] inexhaustible Fountain supply of the
[39:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's not
[39:53] just with us but in US amen Christ in
[39:55] you the hope of glory so you know if we
[39:57] look at this here I just want to maybe
[39:59] uh just just walk through this a bit and
[40:01] see how we go but you know he says the
[40:03] secret of the Lord is with them that
[40:05] fear Him Now that fear is a reverence
[40:07] there's an awe you know when you when
[40:08] you talk to any True Believer and
[40:10] irrespective of what state they're in
[40:12] they have a genuine reverence for God
[40:15] you know someone who's even lost in the
[40:16] world I remember myself before the Lord
[40:18] ever found me I still have a had a
[40:20] reverence for him he's God you know he's
[40:23] not just an idol or an idea he's a
[40:24] reality and you know so so so there's a
[40:26] real fear but you know you see you know
[40:29] a a a a Godly fear but that secret of
[40:31] his Covenant there is is with them that
[40:34] fear Him and He will show them his
[40:36] Covenant so there's a promise there's
[40:38] this there's there's a union that that
[40:40] that he will prove and show now to me in
[40:43] the Bible when when when God ever says
[40:45] he'll show you something he's not just
[40:47] showing you an idea he's not showing you
[40:49] just some a theory but he's going to
[40:52] prove something to you he's going to
[40:53] reveal something to you that becomes
[40:55] part of you like when when the apostle
[40:57] Paul said behold I show you a mystery we
[40:59] shall not all sleep but we shall be
[41:01] changed he's not saying look I'm going
[41:02] to tell you something to tickle your
[41:04] brain I'm going to reveal you something
[41:06] that's going to change your life amen to
[41:08] prove to to to Anchor into your heart
[41:10] that this is not the End Amen but we're
[41:12] all going to be change doesn't matter
[41:14] how you know death is just a travel bus
[41:16] to where we want to get to brother Ron
[41:18] Spencer um said many years ago and I and
[41:21] I agree with that death is just a
[41:22] Gateway it's just a door Amen to get us
[41:24] to where we want to go which is Glory
[41:27] right but but the Apostle Paul he says I
[41:29] show you a mystery he says I'm going to
[41:30] show you a revelation that God has
[41:31] revealed to me and I pray it's going to
[41:33] be quickened into your heart so so this
[41:36] Covenant that God
[41:37] shows amen it's not an abstract idea
[41:40] it's a reality amen it's proved amen you
[41:42] got to you you got to look through your
[41:44] life and see God has proved his Covenant
[41:46] amen where he said I'll never leave thee
[41:47] nor forsake thee that you will stand on
[41:50] the head of the serpent you will be a
[41:51] conqueror amen you will overcome
[41:53] yourself even amen that's a proof of
[41:55] God's covenant cuz he said that he's
[41:57] going to come and dwell in a people and
[41:59] you know he's going to prove his word
[42:00] what does he do he shows it in you we
[42:03] don't just walk around with Theory amen
[42:05] I you I pray you don't we just don't
[42:07] walk around with some quotes and
[42:08] scriptures and say look I've got this
[42:10] it's no it becomes a reality in our
[42:12] lives amen where the power of Calvary is
[42:15] not an idea or a nice story it becomes
[42:17] alive and I pray that if it's just a
[42:19] story to you it doesn't stay a story am
[42:22] me it's got to go beyond a story book
[42:23] idea and a Sunday school thing it
[42:25] becomes a reality but when it becomes a
[42:27] reality it belongs to you amen because
[42:30] it's a secret thing it belongs to God
[42:32] but as soon as it's revealed it belongs
[42:34] to you it becomes your possession you
[42:35] own it amen it's not something that you
[42:38] just have part-time it's yours all the
[42:40] time amen so if it's yours all the time
[42:42] and if it belongs to you amen if it's
[42:44] yours you should let it live in your
[42:46] life amen it's like if you bought a new
[42:48] car it belongs to you amen or maybe
[42:51] someone gave you a new car so you didn't
[42:53] have the money but someone had the money
[42:54] and they bought the car and they gave it
[42:56] to you what good is it just sitting in
[42:58] your garage or in your driveway or on
[43:00] the street amen you got to let it work
[43:04] you got to sit in the thing put the key
[43:05] in the ignition or maybe just push a
[43:07] button amen and let it work amen so
[43:09] because it's yours and if anyone comes
[43:11] along and says you have no right to be
[43:13] in that car you say no it belongs to me
[43:15] I mean this is my possession and how
[43:17] many times the Devil comes along in a
[43:19] promise of God he'll say it's not yours
[43:22] you don't qualify for it you're not
[43:24] worthy enough to receive it amen you're
[43:26] not in the the condition that it can
[43:28] operate in your life you going say no
[43:29] devil it belongs to me amen this redemp
[43:32] every Redemptive blessing of God Is Mine
[43:34] amen it's not just the prophets it's not
[43:36] just someone else but it's mine amen and
[43:38] if it's yours let it work amen let it
[43:41] let it take control of your life I mean
[43:43] I think there's a you we're living in a
[43:44] day where we actually let God be God
[43:47] Amen we
[43:48] we've I always think of you brother and
[43:50] Paul when I think about those things I
[43:52] remember you saying that one time it
[43:53] just really struck me we're going to let
[43:55] God be God Amen but the problem is that
[43:58] many times we don't let him be God you
[44:00] say how could we you know it's you know
[44:03] we come to a point or sometimes we come
[44:05] to a point because the devil wants us to
[44:07] forget what belongs to us right that's
[44:09] what he wants to do because he realizes
[44:11] if he can if he can actually uh diminish
[44:13] the power of this Covenant remember God
[44:15] has given us an unconditional Covenant
[44:18] am mean so remember with Adam and Eve he
[44:20] you know he said if you eat of the tree
[44:22] this will happen and you know with the
[44:23] law it says if you do this I'll do this
[44:25] but with Abraham it was unconditional
[44:27] I have made you father of many nations
[44:29] but he wasn't even in a condition to be
[44:31] a father he couldn't have a child with
[44:33] Sarah Sarah couldn't have a child
[44:35] herself they weren't even in condition
[44:37] when God gave them the promise you are
[44:39] the father of many nations so so
[44:41] basically God said to Abraham look
[44:43] Abraham I know you can't do it so
[44:45] therefore I'm going to step in and I'm
[44:46] going to do it for you amen and When God
[44:50] says he's going to have a bride without
[44:51] spot or wrinkle he's not saying if you
[44:53] keep this I'll do this he says no I'm
[44:55] going to make you so amen so God's
[44:57] transforming power comes into our life
[44:59] which is his Covenant to you and I amen
[45:02] and manifest his promises with you
[45:04] friends if I jump around too much maybe
[45:06] I just get too happy and you're got to
[45:07] realize we have all things in Christ
[45:09] amen we don't have just some of the
[45:11] promises maybe part-time every
[45:13] Redemptive blessing he died for is yours
[45:16] you've just got to let it
[45:18] live and so what did Abraham do he
[45:20] surrended himself to the revelation God
[45:23] gave him I mean cuz when God showed him
[45:25] his new name of Abraham he didn't say
[45:27] that's a nice idea he let God transform
[45:30] him to become what God called him and
[45:32] that's why brother Braham said I no
[45:34] longer call you church I'll call you
[45:35] bride that you'll understand we're no
[45:37] longer a denominational Church we're no
[45:39] longer a group of people just a
[45:41] religious people no God has called us
[45:42] out am mean to be the Bride of Jesus
[45:45] Christ he's I'm going to give you a
[45:46] different Covenant they have their
[45:47] promises you've got your promises I mean
[45:50] like Hagar had some promises but Sarah
[45:52] had different promises amen Sarah had a
[45:54] body chain she had a promised son amen
[45:56] she had that you know she had that
[45:58] promise Hagar had her promises right God
[46:00] took care of Hagar you go read the
[46:03] scripture God spoke to Hagar open the
[46:05] well did all those things for her God
[46:07] took care of them God will take care of
[46:09] them but we're under a different
[46:11] Covenant amen so why should we mix the
[46:13] things and try and say well we just like
[46:15] everyone else no God has called me out
[46:18] am mean he hasn't called me out to be
[46:19] religious he's called me out to walk
[46:20] with him amen this is what this
[46:22] covenant's done he says I want to walk
[46:24] with you I want to know you amen I want
[46:26] to live in your life life I want to
[46:27] prove my word in your life sir praise
[46:31] the Lord amen you see so we live so so
[46:34] all everything he has revealed belongeth
[46:37] unto us now I'm going to make a Quantum
[46:39] jump here the book of redemption that
[46:42] was in the right hand of God on the
[46:45] throne it's been revealed it belongs to
[46:48] you everything Adam lost is now in your
[46:50] possession I mean everything what did
[46:52] Adam lose dominion over the Earth
[46:55] godship upon the Earth see the devil
[46:57] wants to make him think that he's God of
[46:58] this Earth some people you know he's the
[47:01] God of this evil age but he's not our
[47:02] God he's not the god of the Bride I mean
[47:05] his politics and fussing and fighting
[47:07] and and and carnality and all these
[47:09] things that he pushes fors and you know
[47:11] uh religious ideas and all these
[47:13] different things he's he isn't Our
[47:15] God God is our God but now God has God
[47:19] wants to prove his Covenant that he has
[47:21] restored us back to have dominion over
[47:24] Satan amen this is this is what belongs
[47:27] to us friends we don't have to put up
[47:29] with any of his
[47:30] nonsense amen we can no we have a right
[47:33] to stand upon the word of God and
[47:35] believe and know God will fulfill his
[47:37] word how he wants it
[47:40] fulfilled sometimes it can be an instant
[47:42] Miracle that's God's healing power
[47:44] sometimes it can be a process of time
[47:46] and you get well that's still God's
[47:48] healing power right brother said a
[47:50] Divine Healing takes time A Miracle is
[47:53] instant it's all God sometimes God will
[47:56] send you to a doctor brother BR says
[47:58] it's your duty to go to the doctor I
[48:00] went to the doctor the other day he says
[48:01] I haven't seen you in over a year Well I
[48:03] hadn't you know my my medical um PL youo
[48:07] GP used to send us letter saying are you
[48:10] still part of this Clinic cuz we haven't
[48:12] seen you in five years so I don't run to
[48:15] doctors every time but I go if I need to
[48:17] it's your duty right sometimes God will
[48:20] use that sometimes just a bit of love or
[48:22] care or understanding God or or by music
[48:25] God heals by many things but it's still
[48:28] God but the Bride of Jesus Christ has
[48:30] come to a place that they're willing
[48:32] whatever God whatever however Avenue you
[48:34] want to use and sometimes sickness will
[48:36] take us to the other
[48:38] side that's still uh you're still
[48:40] liberated from the sickness right but I
[48:43] believe we've come to a point that we're
[48:46] willing for God to answer his word
[48:48] however he wants see the world has
[48:51] people get annoyed or offended at God
[48:53] because God doesn't answer him God
[48:56] doesn't answer according to how they
[48:57] want him to uh but he's God we're
[49:01] not right so I believe we've come to a
[49:03] point Lord however you want to fulfill
[49:05] your word we're happy with
[49:07] it
[49:09] amen
[49:12] now we read we read um last week about
[49:15] the priest standing in the Jordan now
[49:19] after um before they priest came out of
[49:23] the Jordan uh Joshua commanded um well
[49:26] Joshua command the priest saying comeing
[49:27] out of the Jordan it came to pass when
[49:29] the priest that bear the Ark of the
[49:30] Covenant of the Lord will come out of
[49:32] the midst of the Jordan and The Souls of
[49:33] the priest's feet were lifted up unto
[49:35] the dry land that the Waters of Jordan
[49:37] returned into their place and flowed
[49:39] over all his Banks as they did before
[49:41] and the people came up out of the Jordan
[49:43] on the 10th day of the first month and
[49:45] encamped in gilgal in the east border of
[49:47] Jericho and those 12 Stones which they
[49:49] took out of the Jordan that Joshua pitch
[49:52] and gilgal so they took these stones out
[49:54] of out of the Jordan and they took them
[49:56] to and they M and you know they made
[49:58] them they made them a mound right now
[50:01] there's a purpose of this right because
[50:03] it says here and he spake unto the
[50:05] children of Israel saying when your
[50:06] children shall ask their fathers uh in
[50:09] time to come saying what mean these
[50:10] Stones then you shall let your children
[50:13] know saying Israel came over this Jordan
[50:15] on dry land for the Lord your God dried
[50:18] up the Waters of Jordan from before you
[50:20] until you were passed over as the Lord
[50:22] uh your god did to the Red Sea which he
[50:24] dried up from before us until they were
[50:26] gone over that all the people of the
[50:28] earth might know the hand of the Lord
[50:30] that is mighty that ye may fear the lord
[50:32] your God forever amen so this was a
[50:35] monument of stones that that the people
[50:38] would know they would first ask the
[50:40] question what are these Stones doing
[50:42] here then the answer would come well God
[50:45] made us go over this Jordan on dry
[50:47] ground and then the account would be
[50:48] told of the priest of the Ark you're on
[50:50] the ark standing in the Jordan and the
[50:51] waters parted we crossed over and we
[50:53] came into our inheritance but the whole
[50:56] purpose of this is that the people would
[50:57] know that you know the all the people of
[51:00] the earth might know the hand of the
[51:02] Lord that it is mighty that you may fear
[51:04] the lord your God forever so these
[51:06] Stones were were a good rock testimony
[51:10] amen they are a good rock testimony they
[51:11] are proof of God's covenant now in this
[51:14] day God is Not Looking for heap of
[51:16] natural stones he's looking for Living
[51:19] Stones amen he's looking for a living
[51:21] people as it would say in the book of
[51:22] Peter that we are living stones or
[51:24] Lively Stones built up into the house of
[51:27] God am mean so so so we're not a bunch
[51:29] of of of rocks like this that can't
[51:32] speak they can't have action they can't
[51:34] walk they can't talk but God's gone from
[51:36] a from a testimony of stone to a
[51:39] testimony of living Stone amen where
[51:42] there's a people that actually have a
[51:43] rock testimony of God's Deliverance of
[51:46] the proof of his Covenant you got to
[51:49] realize if you know if God's saved you
[51:51] you've got a testimony you've got a rock
[51:54] testimony if God's done the smallest
[51:56] sing for you that's a living you're a
[51:58] living testimony Hallelujah so never let
[52:00] the devil diminish your testimony God's
[52:02] done Mighty things God's done Eternal
[52:04] things I mean he saved your soul from
[52:06] hell that's an incredible thing
[52:08] Hallelujah that's a mighty thing he's
[52:10] done so never let the devil diminish it
[52:11] down and say well I'm just a message
[52:13] believer and this is what I do and I was
[52:15] raised in this no there should have come
[52:17] a day and there has come a day where the
[52:18] light came on where the reality of the
[52:20] word struck your life and now you become
[52:22] a living testimony where it's not just
[52:24] your mom and dad's Covenant with God or
[52:26] God Covenant with them rather but now
[52:27] it's God's covenant with you am mean
[52:29] that where now you are a living proof am
[52:32] mean where God has done a supernatural
[52:34] work as word has come open to you and
[52:36] now what do you do you are the evidence
[52:38] of God's covenant amen amen you are the
[52:42] living proof you want the you want the
[52:44] proof this message is
[52:47] true we should be the billboard of the
[52:51] proof that Calvary Works amen we should
[52:53] be the proof you know our lives should
[52:55] be the proof that that the blood atones
[52:58] the blood saves the blood delivers the
[53:00] blood heals the baptism of the Holy
[53:02] Ghost is just as real now as it was back
[53:05] then that there is overcoming power in
[53:08] God Amen Hallelujah but remember it's
[53:11] it's it's him that does it right used to
[53:13] be times past people would try and just
[53:15] mechanically line up with the word you
[53:17] can never mechanically line up with the
[53:18] word I mean Israel tried to do that
[53:20] under the blood of bulls and goats they
[53:22] miserably failed I mean people of
[53:24] Believers of Ages p and God bless them
[53:26] but you know they tried to mechanically
[53:28] line up with the word no you got to let
[53:30] God line you up with the word through a
[53:32] surrendered
[53:34] life amen so it's a good rock testimony
[53:38] now just like brother um brother
[53:40] Alistair and by the way sends us
[53:42] greetings he said he loved being here
[53:44] with you uh you on Wednesday and and and
[53:46] seeing the Saints and so on so God bless
[53:48] you all for for being such a great
[53:50] testimony amen but you know just as he
[53:52] is saying it's that Rod of Aaron that
[53:53] buds that life amen that comes forth was
[53:56] actually which actually quietens down
[53:59] the accuser's voice because now here is
[54:01] living evidence that the presence of God
[54:04] has Vindicated a life amen and so and
[54:08] remember it's it's it's his word in our
[54:10] life that he vindicates if you want God
[54:11] to vindicate your life stay with the
[54:13] word but let him Li live it out of you I
[54:17] mean I trust that makes sense there's a
[54:18] big difference between someone
[54:19] surrendered to the word and then God
[54:21] living it then someone trying to hold
[54:23] the word themselves because we've seen
[54:25] sadly at doesn't work if we try and do
[54:28] it in our own strength we yield Our
[54:30] Lives to the Lord and then we let him do
[54:32] it right but you see now so these Stones
[54:35] now would silence would silence the
[54:38] thought that God doesn't
[54:40] exist because it was a testimony to the
[54:42] whole world that the hand of the Lord is
[54:44] mighty and that the fear of the Lord
[54:47] yeah and that you might fear the lord
[54:48] your God forever you'd have a reverence
[54:49] for him forever am mean so now as as
[54:52] living stones now the life of God should
[54:56] silence the accuser's voice they don't
[54:59] like to be silenced they'll never agree
[55:01] sadly unless they repent but you see it
[55:03] should accuse it should silence the
[55:06] voice of the devil trying to tell you
[55:08] you don't have
[55:09] anything right a rock testimony deals
[55:12] with his voice we've all had points I'm
[55:14] sure me very much included where we
[55:17] where where the devil tries to pin us in
[55:18] a corner that God don't care anymore
[55:21] that he's not real that he doesn't prove
[55:23] his word that that that our situation is
[55:25] actually out outside his ability to
[55:27] solve who's had that never ever agree
[55:30] with that we're never none of us are
[55:33] special cases none of us are not
[55:35] reachable savable helpable by God okay
[55:38] never ever get that in your mind that
[55:40] the devil's tentacles are too deep and
[55:42] too I tell you what his tentacles were
[55:44] deep in our lives by our first birth his
[55:46] tentacles were very deep and The Roots
[55:48] ran in many multiple parts of our life
[55:50] and our forbears and everything am mean
[55:52] but God rich in Mercy his consuming fire
[55:55] came down and burnt out every work of
[55:57] the enemy amen doesn't matter how deep
[55:59] how you it's like your you your family
[56:02] could be known for a temper for example
[56:04] and it's in every one of your family
[56:06] High Strung High Temple but God comes in
[56:09] and burns that out amen that you're not
[56:11] you don't have that personality trait
[56:13] anymore cuz God has taken care of it's
[56:15] that deep root that the devil's put in
[56:17] to try and make you be identified by
[56:19] that God has burnt it out completely I
[56:22] believe he does that kind of thing amen
[56:23] that we can look back and say I'm not
[56:25] like my parents that's right in some
[56:27] ways we are cuz God doesn't change us he
[56:30] he keeps the good
[56:31] things takes away the bad things right
[56:36] but those bad things are
[56:37] gone Hallelujah you know the best thing
[56:40] that you fire deals with everything just
[56:43] get in the fire of the word and let him
[56:45] start working and you'll see bugs fly
[56:47] you'll see things die you'll see things
[56:49] burned up amen but amen we're built our
[56:53] souls are built to not be burnt up in
[56:54] the fire amen but he just burns out all
[56:57] the devil's Works amen praise God and
[56:59] I'm glad for that amen so what do you do
[57:01] now so why he does that to show his
[57:04] Covenant now the children of Israel were
[57:07] fighting I'm just going to leave that
[57:07] picture up there sorry Lilia I don't
[57:09] have many pictures today so let's leave
[57:11] that one up there but the children of
[57:12] Israel were went to go fight Moab and
[57:15] they journeyed seven days into the
[57:17] desert and they realized they had no
[57:19] they had no water so uh so they thought
[57:23] well they're going to die and they're
[57:24] going to you know God's brought them out
[57:25] there and into the desert but it wasn't
[57:27] his idea it was their idea and then and
[57:29] then the prophet came along and said
[57:31] make the valley full of ditches you know
[57:33] and then God will bring water right so
[57:35] because the reason in that desert was
[57:37] the smitten rock where the water flows
[57:39] from Christ himself they just had to get
[57:41] rid of the logs and all these things dig
[57:43] it all out that the water could flow
[57:45] again and the devil loves to put dams in
[57:48] our life logs in our life of false
[57:50] Doctrine misunderstandings all these
[57:52] things but we've got to always remember
[57:55] God we always got to remember what God
[57:58] did when he first found us that
[58:00] sweetness and that joy that that that
[58:03] reverence that thankfulness that you had
[58:05] when you know everything seemed new who
[58:06] remembers that time amen I remember that
[58:09] time everything seemed new you see his
[58:11] Sonet it's like Lord you just painted
[58:12] that for me that's right praise God I
[58:14] think that still amen praise the Lord
[58:17] anyway you see you see so you got to
[58:19] remember so so if if that kind of state
[58:22] is gone then a log has come in troubles
[58:26] come in remember the devil's allowed to
[58:30] do it but God's greater than the log
[58:33] right just because things trouble may
[58:35] come in you know God wants to show us
[58:37] his Covenant how does he do that in
[58:40] times of trouble in times of hardship
[58:42] and Times of misunderstanding and Times
[58:44] of strife he proves his
[58:46] Covenant praise God hallelujah so now
[58:50] here they were they're in the desert
[58:51] they thought they were going to die and
[58:52] all these things you know they got a
[58:54] prophet to come and you know and God
[58:56] spoke through him say dig out make the
[58:58] valley full of ditches and God will
[59:00] bring water okay so then what happened
[59:02] is that so they did that according to
[59:04] the word of the prophet and the next
[59:05] morning the moabites they got up they
[59:07] got their armor on they were ready to
[59:09] fight standing on their border and then
[59:10] they saw the water that was that had
[59:13] come out of out of the holes that the
[59:15] that the Israelites had dug and they
[59:17] thought it was blood probably based on
[59:18] how the Sun was shining on it or
[59:20] something I guess God just made them see
[59:22] it that way and they thought well
[59:24] Israel's killing each other let's go
[59:25] fight but when they got there am mean
[59:27] the Israelites rose up and they slew the
[59:30] slew the moabites and they chased them
[59:31] back to their country and what they did
[59:33] is they as they as they picked up a
[59:35] bunch of rocks after they cut down the
[59:37] trees and all these things and they
[59:39] stopped up their
[59:40] Wells amen and brother Ram says that
[59:43] that is a good rock
[59:45] testimony amen where you see the power
[59:47] of God living in your life now you've
[59:49] got a rock you got a testimony what can
[59:51] you do you can silence amen the voice of
[59:54] the accuser Why by putting that
[59:56] testimony on his head amen well how do
[59:59] you put it on his head you you take your
[1:00:01] testimony and you take what he says you
[1:00:03] say no my testimon is greater than what
[1:00:05] you
[1:00:06] say we've got to see see the devil uses
[1:00:10] reasoning use reasoning against him what
[1:00:13] is Godly reasoning agreeing with the
[1:00:15] word amen so if he reasons well there's
[1:00:18] this problem this has happened you
[1:00:19] shouldn't have done this this then you
[1:00:21] just take it back to the scripture say
[1:00:22] no no the blood of the Lord Jesus is
[1:00:24] more than enough amen this is is not the
[1:00:26] end of the story God's able to deliver
[1:00:29] amen I placed my family in his hands
[1:00:31] he's more than able to save amen this is
[1:00:33] not the end so th though the world is
[1:00:35] falling apart I cannot fall apart cuz my
[1:00:38] life is built upon his Rock of
[1:00:41] Revelation amen see the next morning the
[1:00:43] enemy looked up he looked across there
[1:00:46] and when he did it was it was water but
[1:00:48] to the enemy the way the Sun was shining
[1:00:50] it only looked like blood and it scared
[1:00:52] him that's right it got a little silly
[1:00:54] thought woked up in his mind trapped him
[1:00:56] right into it what did the prophet say
[1:00:57] to them uh why now this is a little
[1:00:59] thing the Lord if all you just get those
[1:01:01] logs out of the way I'll take care of
[1:01:03] the rest of it if you get all the
[1:01:04] unbelief out of the way God will take
[1:01:06] care of the rest of it you know what
[1:01:07] happened he said each man pick you up a
[1:01:09] rock I'm going to give you the land I'm
[1:01:11] going to let you possess it and each the
[1:01:13] man took a rock and then got over there
[1:01:15] and where them old formal Wells was he
[1:01:17] just took that old rock he just had a
[1:01:19] good old rock testimony amen praise God
[1:01:21] God give me the Holy Ghost I'm like
[1:01:23] Simon I'm like Peter now a little Stone
[1:01:25] amen and everybody just his own rock in
[1:01:28] his hand a real testimony a real fiery
[1:01:31] testimony when Jesus come before Peter
[1:01:33] said your name is Simon and from
[1:01:35] henceforth he should be called Peter
[1:01:36] that's that is a little Stone brother he
[1:01:38] picked that up he knowed that that was
[1:01:40] the Messiah away he went and he stopped
[1:01:42] up formal Wells with it you have the
[1:01:45] same ability what is what is formality
[1:01:48] it's taking a heart out of anything it
[1:01:52] becomes a form loud or quiet it can just
[1:01:55] become a formality if the people just go
[1:01:57] through the motions amen but if you take
[1:02:00] your testimony it'll stop that formality
[1:02:02] well amen because it'll actually because
[1:02:04] you realize hey God has done something
[1:02:06] for me God Has Changed Me God has made
[1:02:09] me closer more like him God has been
[1:02:11] shaping my testimony by his word am mean
[1:02:14] the washing of the water of the word
[1:02:16] just like those stones in Jordan were
[1:02:17] shaped by the water flowing over them I
[1:02:20] mean God has done a work Hallelujah God
[1:02:22] does
[1:02:23] care amen I say these things cuz that
[1:02:27] that'll stop up that formal well it'll
[1:02:28] put your heart back into your worship
[1:02:30] and your walk with God once
[1:02:32] again
[1:02:34] hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[1:02:37] now God loves to show his testimony
[1:02:41] right his his Covenant so I'm just I'm
[1:02:44] just going to make a bit of a segue here
[1:02:47] um if you don't mind you don't know
[1:02:48] where I'm going so I guess you can't say
[1:02:50] that's fine but you
[1:02:52] see now God Wants You and I
[1:02:56] right he doesn't want our talents he
[1:02:59] doesn't actually care about the gifts we
[1:03:00] have he wants
[1:03:02] you okay you may think well what about
[1:03:04] my gift God will use it but he wants you
[1:03:07] he gets you then he'll he'll use the
[1:03:09] gift right not the other way around now
[1:03:13] it says speaking of David he says and
[1:03:15] when he had removed him so speaking of
[1:03:17] Saul he raised up unto them David to be
[1:03:19] their King to whom also he gave
[1:03:20] testimony and said I have found David
[1:03:22] the son of Jesse a man after my own
[1:03:24] heart what shall fulfill all my will man
[1:03:28] I read that I think man Lord may you
[1:03:30] write that about me Lord that I'm a man
[1:03:32] after your own heart to I'll fulfill all
[1:03:34] your word all your will not just a
[1:03:36] partial part of your will for the bride
[1:03:38] but the entire will am mean of your word
[1:03:41] you see so David David had a genuine
[1:03:45] let's see if I can find a find another
[1:03:47] picture
[1:03:49] here David had a genuine reverence and a
[1:03:52] love for God right he had a genuine and
[1:03:56] and you see the thing is when your whole
[1:03:58] life your whole heart is put into
[1:04:00] serving God then you actually fall into
[1:04:02] God's hands and God can use you like
[1:04:05] more than just giving a part of yourself
[1:04:07] to him okay so here is here is David now
[1:04:10] now remember our opening scriptures that
[1:04:12] God would show um God would uh the
[1:04:15] secret of the Lord is with them that
[1:04:16] fear Him and He will show them his
[1:04:18] Covenant right so now part of God's
[1:04:20] covenant with Israel is that one would
[1:04:22] chase a thousand that you'll dwell in
[1:04:24] your land and you'll conquer your enemy
[1:04:25] and all these things but now God has to
[1:04:28] find someone to show that to to prove it
[1:04:31] to so it goes beyond a nice sermon on a
[1:04:34] on a Saturday or whenever they would
[1:04:36] worship you know the well I don't think
[1:04:37] they had synagogues back in David's day
[1:04:39] but you know what I mean it' be it' be
[1:04:40] more than just reading jeromy or Exodus
[1:04:42] or or Leviticus but it become a living
[1:04:45] reality so here David now was a man
[1:04:47] after God's Own Heart that he would
[1:04:49] fulfill all of God's Will and we know
[1:04:51] sure David made mistakes he did worse
[1:04:53] things than Saul did but he was quick to
[1:04:56] repent he was quick to say Lord I'm
[1:04:58] standing in the need of prayer I'm wrong
[1:05:00] Lord and that's what to me made him a
[1:05:03] man after God's Own Heart so here is
[1:05:05] David now because he's now in the hands
[1:05:07] of God he hasn't just given his gift of
[1:05:09] playing music to God but his whole life
[1:05:11] is the Lords I mean therefore because
[1:05:13] he's he he's he's allowed himself to be
[1:05:16] fully surrendered into God's hands
[1:05:18] nothing's going to move him nothing's
[1:05:20] going to move him so you see when
[1:05:22] Goliath came along and and um you know
[1:05:25] made his challenge bring me a man to
[1:05:27] fight me and you know he manipulated
[1:05:29] Israel to stay there for 40 days under
[1:05:31] fear and torment and all these things
[1:05:33] you know those those Israelites were
[1:05:36] being moved by the psychology of Goliath
[1:05:39] they were moved by the reasoning of
[1:05:41] Goliath but David because he was in the
[1:05:43] hands of God God and and God had already
[1:05:46] shown him his Covenant how did he show
[1:05:49] him his Covenant well he killed a lion
[1:05:51] and he killed a bear that was God
[1:05:53] showing David his Covenant it was more
[1:05:55] more than just in his mind it was in his
[1:05:57] heart Lord I've seen you prove your
[1:05:59] Covenant in my life cuz you think about
[1:06:01] a little buy boy even even what about 13
[1:06:03] years old or whatever he was a lion and
[1:06:06] a beer and you've got a slingshot and
[1:06:09] you've got a staff and you got a
[1:06:12] dagger that that was more than him
[1:06:15] killing those animals amen I've seen
[1:06:17] videos on YouTube hunters in South
[1:06:18] Africa big high powerered guns and
[1:06:20] there's like four of them with these big
[1:06:22] big cannons trying to kill Lions a line
[1:06:25] almost Chows one of them and you know
[1:06:27] all these things you think about now
[1:06:28] here's an angry angry lion with blood
[1:06:31] he's got the taste of blood you know
[1:06:34] he's not going to be a little a you know
[1:06:36] like a lion I never seen a scared lion
[1:06:37] they're always angry even a little cuup
[1:06:40] is angry I remember even like a Lepard I
[1:06:42] held a leopard cup maholo I know how old
[1:06:44] it was little thing like a kitten it was
[1:06:46] mad it wasn't going meow it was like
[1:06:49] growling at me this thing was angry it's
[1:06:52] like a lion they just they're just angry
[1:06:54] things so here he already tasted by you
[1:06:57] know the blood of the sheep that goes it
[1:06:58] grab on could carry it off here comes
[1:07:00] David charging after it it wasn't his
[1:07:02] natural ability that killed that lion
[1:07:05] and killed that bear it was God showing
[1:07:07] him his Covenant amen and then when
[1:07:09] Goliath came along see what was what was
[1:07:12] David standing on who is this
[1:07:14] uncircumcised Philistine I mean he was
[1:07:16] standing on the fact God has given me
[1:07:19] made me part of his Covenant he shown me
[1:07:21] his Covenant he shown me his promise
[1:07:23] shown me his word amen therefore he
[1:07:25] realized God has given me a covenant I'm
[1:07:27] a circumcised son of Abraham who's this
[1:07:30] guy he didn't speak about his stature
[1:07:33] didn't speak about how strong he was
[1:07:34] even Saul knew the reputation of Goliath
[1:07:37] you know he'd say to David David this
[1:07:40] man has been a Warrior from his Youth
[1:07:42] and you're but a youth David didn't
[1:07:44] bring that into the equation all he was
[1:07:46] looking at is God's covenant that's all
[1:07:48] that mattered to David who's with me
[1:07:50] this morning amen who's with me amen so
[1:07:52] he could see that you know David had God
[1:07:55] had made a covenant with David it's one
[1:07:58] thing to make a promise to God when God
[1:08:00] makes a promise to you and that's what
[1:08:02] he's done through the message of the
[1:08:03] hour he's given you his Covenant
[1:08:06] hallelujah amen so so here's David he
[1:08:09] all he's look he's not looking at size
[1:08:11] ability stature weapons um reputation
[1:08:15] he's not looking at any of those things
[1:08:16] he's just looking at covenant and that's
[1:08:19] why he says who is this uncircumcised
[1:08:21] Philistine that should defy the armies
[1:08:23] of the Living God and you see what s um
[1:08:26] if you go read the account Goliath he
[1:08:28] just told told Israel that they were
[1:08:30] just the Servants of Saul you see a man
[1:08:33] who doesn't have a covenant with God
[1:08:34] just looks at Natural Things David
[1:08:37] having a covenant with God he's looking
[1:08:38] at Supernatural things he he wasn't
[1:08:41] looking at the armies of Israel as the
[1:08:43] Servants of Saul he saying no these
[1:08:45] people here are the armies of the Living
[1:08:47] God Amen and it's the same thing with
[1:08:50] you and I friends if you can look beyond
[1:08:51] the carnal I mean look beyond the
[1:08:53] devil's reasoning oh that's brother son
[1:08:55] so that's just a son so no they're part
[1:08:57] of the armies of the Living God
[1:08:59] hallelujah they are the mighty host amen
[1:09:01] God has raised up in the end time to
[1:09:03] prove his word through am mean they bone
[1:09:05] of his bone flesh of his flesh Life Is
[1:09:07] Life they are
[1:09:09] him amen we're going to look beyond the
[1:09:12] flesh look Beyond The Faults and the
[1:09:15] problems and the humanity we're to look
[1:09:17] Beyond those things David looked beyond
[1:09:19] it they the armies of the Living God
[1:09:22] well it didn't they they weren't
[1:09:24] behaving like them they were in their
[1:09:26] little fox holes hiding away scared of
[1:09:29] this one man but David didn't look at
[1:09:32] what they're doing they look at what
[1:09:33] they meant actually what they were
[1:09:34] ordained to be but because David was in
[1:09:37] the hands of hands of God he could step
[1:09:40] out there in that Battlefield and he ran
[1:09:41] towards Goliath when he fought him he
[1:09:44] didn't stand there still like many
[1:09:45] children's bible stories and he stands
[1:09:48] no no he ran and he's running you read
[1:09:50] the account he takes a stone out puts it
[1:09:51] in a sling and starts swinging
[1:09:53] Hallelujah
[1:09:55] why because go he knew God would show
[1:09:58] him his Covenant in every
[1:10:01] circumstance Hallelujah that's why we go
[1:10:03] through many different things in life
[1:10:05] God wants to show you every stage of
[1:10:07] life my Covenant Works my word works it
[1:10:12] stands it proves itself amen it stands
[1:10:15] for itself amen I will prove my word if
[1:10:18] you're young you're old you're married
[1:10:21] you're not married children no children
[1:10:24] grandchildren rich poor whatever you
[1:10:27] know life throws you big curveball my
[1:10:29] Covenant Works my word
[1:10:32] Works
[1:10:34] hallelujah amen but you see David David
[1:10:37] was was one man he was in the hands of
[1:10:40] God and by standing on God's word he
[1:10:42] rallied around I mean I mean he he he
[1:10:45] rallied Israel amen and they won the
[1:10:48] day praise the Lord so I'm just still
[1:10:50] trying
[1:10:51] to because my notes are never in order
[1:10:53] so it's a bit of a problem
[1:10:57] it is
[1:10:59] right amen so you see you know it's like
[1:11:02] Jesus when when he went to feed
[1:11:05] the feed the
[1:11:07] multitude and uh his disciples getting
[1:11:09] all worried saying look it's three days
[1:11:11] away you you we have no food we can't
[1:11:13] disperse them and how are we going to
[1:11:14] feed these people and and a little boy
[1:11:17] with his lunch because many times we
[1:11:19] think we have nothing God could like how
[1:11:21] can God use my
[1:11:22] life the devil wants you to think that
[1:11:25] how can God use me I'm not able I'm not
[1:11:28] smart I'm not whatever whatever excuse
[1:11:31] the devil allows that to come that
[1:11:33] reason come into your mind because he
[1:11:35] the devil's afraid of you he's scared
[1:11:38] you know you know what gives you know
[1:11:40] what gives the devil nightmares if he
[1:11:41] ever sleeps you doesn't matter what age
[1:11:44] you are he's afraid if they really if
[1:11:46] they really let God live I can't stand
[1:11:49] before them amen I'll be thoroughly
[1:11:51] defeated as I was in the desert amen or
[1:11:54] whenever I tried to come against the
[1:11:55] Lord Jesus I'll be completely defeated
[1:11:57] amen whatever Mountain I put in their
[1:11:59] life it's going to move you know brother
[1:12:00] Ram says if a spirit filled son or
[1:12:03] daughter of God takes the word of God
[1:12:05] and speaks it across their lips it's the
[1:12:06] same as deity speaking Every Mountain
[1:12:09] has to move nothing can stand before
[1:12:10] that man the devil knows that the devil
[1:12:13] knows that the devil's got test see he's
[1:12:15] on the other side of the testimony right
[1:12:17] we're on the Victorious side he's on the
[1:12:19] defeated side so he remembers every
[1:12:22] impact of God that he's received amen
[1:12:25] through the people of God that's right
[1:12:27] so he's got testimonies too they ain't
[1:12:29] good ones right he came out the the
[1:12:33] loser but now he knows the impact of the
[1:12:36] word against him in previous generations
[1:12:39] and he knows the impact of the word
[1:12:41] through the prophet's life now what
[1:12:42] about
[1:12:43] you that's why he thinks what you know
[1:12:45] that's why he wants us to think well God
[1:12:47] could never use me yeah I'm just I'm
[1:12:48] just an adequate I just can't do it but
[1:12:50] you know there was a day when as I was
[1:12:52] saying that you know Jesus wanted to
[1:12:54] feed the people and little boy with his
[1:12:55] lunch came along carrying a few Loaves
[1:12:58] and a few fishes brother Bram said he
[1:13:00] skipped school he heard the you know
[1:13:02] crowd he just wanted to see what was
[1:13:04] going on and he found himself before the
[1:13:06] Lord saying here here's my lunch here's
[1:13:09] these Loaves and Fishes you know in the
[1:13:12] hands of the little boy it could only do
[1:13:13] so much feed himself but in the hands of
[1:13:16] God it could feed a multitude it could
[1:13:19] be multiplied and spread far more than
[1:13:21] he could ever imagine with his own
[1:13:23] ability the boy's ability right so
[1:13:25] whatever you put in the hands of God God
[1:13:27] will use it far more than you can
[1:13:29] realize amen but he wants more than a
[1:13:31] gift placed in his hand he wants you
[1:13:33] placed in his hand just like
[1:13:35] David
[1:13:37] hallelujah amen because now gifts weaken
[1:13:41] now this is me well so especially the
[1:13:45] church world today they think their gift
[1:13:48] will grant them access to Heaven because
[1:13:50] of what they have done right as as it
[1:13:54] would say here Matthew if I can find
[1:13:57] it he says where are false prophets
[1:14:00] which come in to you in sheep's clothing
[1:14:02] but inwardly they rly ravening wolves ye
[1:14:04] shall know them by their fruits do men
[1:14:06] gather grapes or Thorns or um sorry
[1:14:09] Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles
[1:14:11] even every good uh tree bringeth forth
[1:14:13] good fruit but a crup tree bringeth
[1:14:15] forth evil fruit a good tree cannot uh a
[1:14:19] good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
[1:14:21] neither can a crup tree bring forth good
[1:14:22] fruit every tree that bringeth not forth
[1:14:25] good fruit is he down and cast Into the
[1:14:28] Fire wherefore by their fruits you shall
[1:14:29] know them says by their life amen say so
[1:14:32] what is what is our life producing is it
[1:14:36] the Life of Christ is it his
[1:14:38] word what are our lives producing I
[1:14:41] trust it is I trust we're Aaron's Rod
[1:14:43] budding forth am mean there's actually a
[1:14:45] life and you know that that people can
[1:14:47] see those people are real Christians may
[1:14:50] not disagree with what they believe but
[1:14:52] I can see there's a real Christianity
[1:14:53] there's a real life of God amen because
[1:14:55] he says not everyone that sayith unto me
[1:14:57] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:14:58] of heaven but he that doth the will of
[1:15:00] My Father which is in heaven many will
[1:15:02] say to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[1:15:04] not prophesied in thy name in thy name
[1:15:06] cast out devils and in thy name done
[1:15:08] many wonderful works and then will I
[1:15:10] profess unto them I never knew you
[1:15:12] depart from me ye that work iniquity so
[1:15:15] so the modern Church world today thinks
[1:15:18] that a gift means god is there in terms
[1:15:23] of that's their Vindication as a gift
[1:15:26] that is not a Vindication no it's the
[1:15:28] life of the word living out right it's
[1:15:31] it's it's staying with the word see he
[1:15:33] says he says I never knew you what he
[1:15:35] was never see he knew them in the sense
[1:15:37] that he knew that they were there but he
[1:15:39] was never became one with them amen and
[1:15:42] this is what we're called to be is
[1:15:44] become one with Christ above all things
[1:15:48] right so so it's a life that's produced
[1:15:50] now it's amazing when you look at gifts
[1:15:52] because
[1:15:53] even even you know God God gives gifts
[1:15:58] to everyone the gift and calling of God
[1:16:00] is without repentance right so people
[1:16:02] have gifts they're born with
[1:16:04] them amen I'm sure this is not um
[1:16:07] strange to anyone here you see even even
[1:16:09] Ezekiel would speak about the prince of
[1:16:11] Tyrus he says son of man say unto the
[1:16:13] prince of tyus thus sayeth the Lord God
[1:16:15] because thine heart is lifted up and
[1:16:17] thou has said I am I am a God I sit in
[1:16:20] the seat of God in the midst of the Seas
[1:16:22] yet thou art a man and not God um though
[1:16:25] thou set thy heart as the heart of God
[1:16:28] behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel so
[1:16:30] he's a man who's got more wisdom than
[1:16:33] Daniel there is no secret that they can
[1:16:35] hide from thee with thy But but so so
[1:16:38] here's a man he's wiser than wiser than
[1:16:41] Daniel there's no secret that can be
[1:16:42] hidden but look at what he does with
[1:16:44] this wisdom and this gift that he has
[1:16:46] with thy wisdom with thy understanding
[1:16:48] thou has gotten the riches thou has
[1:16:49] gotten gold and silver into thy
[1:16:51] Treasures by thy wisdom and by thy
[1:16:53] traffic thou um thou increase thy riches
[1:16:56] and thine heart is lifted up because of
[1:16:58] thy riches so so his heart was lifted up
[1:17:01] because of what was what what he was
[1:17:04] gathering through the gift he had in his
[1:17:06] life there's a big difference between a
[1:17:08] man using a gift and God using a gift
[1:17:11] right this man was using his own wisdom
[1:17:13] his own gift to gather Treasures build
[1:17:15] his own Empire and how many people
[1:17:17] around the around Christendom build a
[1:17:20] kingdom by a gift they've been given
[1:17:22] amen but we're not called to be like
[1:17:24] like that we're called to give a whole
[1:17:27] life that the word can change every part
[1:17:30] of our life amen that we're not just
[1:17:33] using a gift and and and and and then
[1:17:35] and then vindicating our our
[1:17:38] Christianity by how much God uses us I'm
[1:17:41] not a Christian because I'm a
[1:17:43] preacher I'm not a Christian because I'm
[1:17:45] a pastor that doesn't no I'm a Christian
[1:17:47] because he found me and saved me and
[1:17:50] cleansed Me by his blood that's why I'm
[1:17:52] a Believer if I never preached another
[1:17:54] sermon in my life that ain't going to
[1:17:55] change me walking with God Amen it's got
[1:17:58] nothing to do with it really I am I'm a
[1:18:00] Believer yes sir right he just placed me
[1:18:02] in this position for his glory right but
[1:18:06] but if I couldn't preach anymore I
[1:18:08] wouldn't quit on God I trust that makes
[1:18:10] sense amen we you know we don't want to
[1:18:13] ever get to a point where where we say
[1:18:15] well our we're a Christian because we're
[1:18:17] thus no we're Christian because he's
[1:18:19] saved us he's redeemed us amen he's
[1:18:21] shown us his
[1:18:23] Covenant amen but you see the problem is
[1:18:25] see his his um heart was lifted up
[1:18:28] because of what he gathered so he set
[1:18:30] his heart as the heart of God what is
[1:18:32] the heart of God I'm the
[1:18:34] absolute my feelings or what I think my
[1:18:36] reasoning is Paramount above all things
[1:18:39] we should never let that anything in us
[1:18:41] that exalts itself above the word is
[1:18:43] Antichrist doesn't matter how reasonable
[1:18:45] it may
[1:18:46] be
[1:18:49] amen amen you know Jesus was tempted
[1:18:54] Jesus was tempted Ed to throw himself
[1:18:55] off the um this is when he's being
[1:18:57] tempted by Satan he was tempted by Satan
[1:19:00] says just th you know Satan took him up
[1:19:02] to the Pinnacle of the temple and and
[1:19:04] and Satan said to him look just throw
[1:19:06] yourself off for it's written the angels
[1:19:08] will will will um bear you up that you
[1:19:11] don't Dash your foot against the stone
[1:19:12] you won't hurt yourself a great
[1:19:14] Supernatural thing will happen when you
[1:19:15] throw yourself off the off the temple
[1:19:18] and this is such a trap where where even
[1:19:21] you know the devil will will will give a
[1:19:23] supernatural offer just to get someone
[1:19:25] off the
[1:19:27] word it says in the Harvest
[1:19:30] Time notice if Satan fails
[1:19:33] there which is to use um you know turn
[1:19:36] the turn the stones into food so
[1:19:38] basically use a use use a gift for your
[1:19:40] own ends he says now if Satan fails here
[1:19:42] then he'll try a second scheme on
[1:19:43] getting you to disbelieve the word he'll
[1:19:45] and go to the Seminary he'll he'll try
[1:19:47] the next scheme now here is where you
[1:19:50] want to be real careful just sit uh just
[1:19:53] for another 5 minutes on this part if
[1:19:55] you will then he makes you a
[1:19:57] supernatural offer I'm going to um come
[1:19:59] back to all this just before closing he
[1:20:01] makes see if he can't tempt you away
[1:20:04] from the word now I'm going to stay with
[1:20:05] the word then he'll give you a
[1:20:06] supernatural offer he said I'll tell you
[1:20:09] what you get up here and dive off the
[1:20:10] temple and bring back up see show the
[1:20:13] people that you can do something
[1:20:15] Supernatural it's God that does the
[1:20:17] supernatural I trust this all makes
[1:20:19] sense you maybe a bit of a segue but you
[1:20:21] know we have nothing to prove God proves
[1:20:25] his word if you ever get in your mind
[1:20:27] I've got to prove that I'm a Believer
[1:20:29] because of someone else you've got a
[1:20:31] wrong motive God proves his word we just
[1:20:34] walk with God and God proves his word am
[1:20:36] mean he said boy he got them then now
[1:20:39] watch this this is it watch when uh you
[1:20:42] get to the end where this temptation
[1:20:43] come maybe he might let some of you
[1:20:45] speak in tongues think you got it see or
[1:20:47] even let you prophesy even though it not
[1:20:49] be with the word I've seen people stand
[1:20:51] up and prophesy and was as contrary to
[1:20:53] the word as the EES from the the West
[1:20:55] sea it's the word that you live by them
[1:20:57] Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand
[1:21:00] them out by handfuls
[1:21:02] certainly that don't mean one thing
[1:21:05] didn't Jesus say many will come to me in
[1:21:06] that day and said Lord Lord have not
[1:21:08] prophesied in your name in your name
[1:21:09] I've cast out Devils I've done many
[1:21:11] mighty works I've seen a great man in
[1:21:13] the organ I mean I've been a great man
[1:21:15] in the organization I've done all these
[1:21:16] things he'll say depart from me uh you
[1:21:19] that work iniquity so Satan will hand
[1:21:22] out Supernatural gifts he's a
[1:21:23] supernatural being
[1:21:25] does that mean we throw the gifts away
[1:21:27] no they're in the scripture but what is
[1:21:29] the what is the main motive of of God
[1:21:32] operating the gifts to edify the body
[1:21:34] that's not a person is glorified it's
[1:21:36] God himself is
[1:21:38] glorified amen so we don't throw the
[1:21:40] gifts away no I'm not I'm not taking any
[1:21:42] twink to my Bible
[1:21:44] anywhere right be got but people people
[1:21:47] run with a gift and and and and many
[1:21:49] times they're contrary to the word they
[1:21:51] won't become subject to the word but God
[1:21:53] will show us as Covenant which is I will
[1:21:56] keep you under the blood amen I will
[1:21:59] keep you in my
[1:22:00] word amen but but Satan will try and try
[1:22:03] and get us to deviate from the word I
[1:22:06] trust this is all right amen but see but
[1:22:09] if we can say subject to the Lord which
[1:22:11] is his word it doesn't matter what the
[1:22:13] devil will try and tempt Us by we won't
[1:22:15] fall for
[1:22:17] it he says what is Iniquity it's
[1:22:19] something that you know that's right and
[1:22:21] you concede it and won't do it in your
[1:22:22] heart when you know that the Bible
[1:22:24] teaches a certain thing and you don't do
[1:22:26] it that's iniquity David said if I hide
[1:22:28] iniquity in my heart God will not hear
[1:22:29] my prayer is that truth is that Bible
[1:22:32] now sir now surely you couldn't get
[1:22:34] angry with that see Jesus said many will
[1:22:36] come to me in that day amen see I've um
[1:22:39] I've done all these things and I'll say
[1:22:41] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[1:22:42] same as did Adam Adam said Lord I did
[1:22:44] this I did that but one word see one
[1:22:46] word did it that's all it takes just
[1:22:48] disobey one word see maybe prophesy
[1:22:50] contrary to the word but now time he got
[1:22:52] the supernatural gift he so car Away by
[1:22:55] The Noise by the glamour of it glory to
[1:22:56] God I pray for so and so I've got up and
[1:22:58] walked away and and they got up and
[1:23:00] walked away Hallelujah I can speak in
[1:23:01] tongues and some interpret see it's
[1:23:03] genuine the truth should be such a such
[1:23:06] a treacherous area but thing is if God
[1:23:09] shown you his Covenant he shows you the
[1:23:12] truth of his word see that's what I love
[1:23:14] about God he shows us the genuine that
[1:23:16] the counterfeit is exposed real easy
[1:23:19] it's like how people people used to
[1:23:20] study um uh counterfeit dollars how they
[1:23:23] know the counterfeit they studied the
[1:23:24] genuine they saw how the genuine
[1:23:26] operated and how it was done then they
[1:23:27] could see the counterfeit right and so
[1:23:29] therefore we can we can walk with the
[1:23:31] Lord see the Lord's so merciful to us am
[1:23:34] mean that if if there's anything that's
[1:23:36] counterfeit can come up we say no that's
[1:23:37] not according to the word that's not in
[1:23:40] the right spirit
[1:23:42] amen why is that because God shows us as
[1:23:44] Covenant but if you give if you just
[1:23:46] give part of yourself then that's the
[1:23:48] dangerous area where the enemy can come
[1:23:50] in
[1:23:51] and trap us right Samson gave his
[1:23:56] strength to God but his heart to
[1:23:59] Delila amen we we're we're we're almost
[1:24:02] done okay Samson gave his strength to
[1:24:06] God but his heart to
[1:24:07] Delila and he started off being a mighty
[1:24:10] conqueror but because his heart wasn't
[1:24:12] in the right place he only gave his gift
[1:24:14] to God not his whole being right you
[1:24:16] give your whole being to God then it
[1:24:18] didn't matter how many dilas came his
[1:24:20] way Samson would have withstood the
[1:24:21] whole thing right now that's just
[1:24:24] someone who's given part of their life
[1:24:26] now I just want to go about now what
[1:24:28] about someone who's given their all amen
[1:24:31] cuz now I believe I'm preaching to
[1:24:32] people have have given their all they
[1:24:34] haven't just given a gift they haven't
[1:24:35] given part of their life they don't just
[1:24:37] give Sunday morning they've given all
[1:24:38] their being Lord I yours unreservedly

[1:24:55] that's really on fire for God it'll do
[1:24:57] something for that church more than 40
[1:24:58] revivals you could have amen I'm trying
[1:25:02] to convey to you this is the power you
[1:25:04] have you say the Lord's amazing he's put
[1:25:07] me on fire his words alive I go through
[1:25:10] trouble but he quickens his word to me

[1:25:15] word I feel down he lifts me up he
[1:25:17] comforts me he consols me all I want to
[1:25:19] do is serve him that's someone on fire
[1:25:22] you say well I don't feel a lot of
[1:25:23] emotion you don't have to be emotional
[1:25:25] but what's burning in here I want to be
[1:25:27] a Christian I want to serve you Lord
[1:25:28] because I Love You Lord you're

[1:26:03] example with a face shining with the
[1:26:05] glory of God with sweetness and humility
[1:26:07] to stand there in the power of God and
