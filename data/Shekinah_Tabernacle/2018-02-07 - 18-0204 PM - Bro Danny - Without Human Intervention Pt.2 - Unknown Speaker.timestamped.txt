[29:31] [Music]

[30:11] hallelujah amen you may be seated
[30:14] [Music]
[30:25] I thought about giving you testimony at
[30:30] the Christmas service and as soon as I
[30:34] sat in a service that nope definitely
[30:35] not ready but um this morning I was
[30:40] listening in the back um I had the baby
[30:43] in the back and it was the stay on his
[30:44] screen and um
[30:46] I just knew I had to share I don't want
[30:51] to say too much Mimi won't understand
[30:53] because oh you'll get it but um but I
[30:58] knew I had to say something because
[31:00] maybe there's some person here that
[31:03] struggles with it or maybe you're you're
[31:08] needing that encouragement and if it
[31:12] touches just one person in this whole
[31:14] room then that makes a difference
[31:19] because sometimes we can get so caught
[31:23] up in our own lives that we don't share
[31:26] or we don't reach out and that one
[31:29] person they miss out they may miss it
[31:35] and you can be that person that can
[31:39] reach out to somebody it might be just a
[31:42] word or just saying that I care and you
[31:46] look like you need someone to care about
[31:48] you and that can mean all the difference
[31:58] I'm the second of six children in my
[32:02] family and now were five
[32:08] my youngest brother should have been 22
[32:14] on the 2nd of November this last year he
[32:21] was born when I was 9 and a half and he
[32:25] was my baby because in a big family you
[32:28] know you do a lot you babysit and you
[32:32] change diapers and you do a lot and
[32:35] you're not the mommy just the sibling so
[32:38] they're like
[32:39] your baby we had a lot of difficulty the
[32:44] last ten years of my family's life a lot
[32:47] of changes you don't always understand
[32:49] it you don't know what's happening you
[32:52] don't know why maybe your parents make
[32:54] certain decisions maybe you're not the
[32:56] one who made that decision and you just
[32:59] feel your suffering all the consequences
[33:01] but they're doing it for your best and
[33:06] they love you when we made some large
[33:13] changes in our family my little brother
[33:15] was 10 years old and at 10 you don't you
[33:19] don't understand a lot at 12 you don't
[33:22] understand why they changed your life
[33:25] around at 15 all you know is you have no
[33:28] friends and at 18 you decide school
[33:32] ain't worth it life isn't worth it and
[33:36] maybe you spend way too many hours
[33:38] playing video games maybe you decide
[33:42] we're family isn't worth it maybe decide
[33:45] friends ain't worth the hassle
[33:47] and all you would do is isolate yourself
[33:52] don't do you that reach out to somebody
[33:57] whether that's someone at your church
[34:00] maybe that's a family member maybe
[34:02] that's your neighbor reach out to
[34:04] someone they could change your life and
[34:10] they may not be a message believer but
[34:12] maybe it's someone who gives you a
[34:14] perspective a life's worth living and
[34:17] then you may find that this life for
[34:21] Christ is worth living August 23rd my
[34:32] little brother went home he took his own
[34:35] life there is nothing anyone can say I
[34:40] can reverse that there's nothing you can
[34:44] do to change a decision you make that
[34:48] affects your entire family your whole
[34:51] church
[34:53] people who love you people who care
[34:59] reach out to somebody ask them awesome
[35:04] to do something for you tell them to
[35:07] take you somewhere tell him you want a
[35:11] friend tell him you need a friend
[35:14] because that friend can change you it
[35:19] can change your life you know one
[35:24] brother Danny was talking this morning
[35:26] he kind of sounded funny but he said
[35:28] people have familiar spirits and it's a
[35:30] spirit they're familiar with that's the
[35:33] truth you get familiar with those
[35:35] spirits of being out with people you
[35:37] think are fun spirits out at the bar
[35:40] spirits out with friends that you think
[35:42] are you people from school
[35:44] spirits of games or videos or whatever's
[35:48] the coolest new thing or the coolest new
[35:50] YouTube or whatever you think it is you
[35:53] become familiar with that spirit and
[35:54] that's filler it becomes familiar with
[35:56] you the problem is you don't know how to
[35:59] get rid of that spirit find somebody who
[36:04] is stronger than you find somebody who's
[36:07] much stronger than you and say I need a
[36:10] friend because I need help i need you i
[36:13] need it i don't know how to do it by
[36:17] myself
[36:19] be that person for me because there are
[36:23] so many people that want to do that for
[36:25] you so many who people who care and they
[36:29] want to be that person for you and for
[36:33] you and for you and for you and they
[36:36] will do it they'll do if it takes their
[36:39] time they'll do if it takes to their
[36:41] money they'll do it if they have to put
[36:43] aside everything that's important to
[36:45] them god said one souls worth 10,000

[46:01] that you will bless every effort that
[46:03] has went forth every song that was sung
[46:05] the testimony that was given Lord may it
[46:08] be lifted up to your throne Lord as a
[46:10] trophy of grace Lord and we pray Lord in
[46:14] this service that you would move to the
[46:16] hearts Lord people Lord have responded
[46:19] to the word they've raised their hand
[46:20] they've said their needs now Lord move
[46:23] into that need father move into that
[46:26] life Lord God may you have complete
[46:29] preeminence in this service may we lay
[46:32] aside our tiredness and lay aside the
[46:34] day now focus our minds Lord upon the
[46:37] word of God may there be complete
[46:40] liberty in the house of God Lord every
[46:43] hindering spirit Lord be moved and bound
[46:45] and put aside so that the children of
[46:48] God can receive the gospel Lord we ask
[46:51] these things in Jesus name Amen
[46:56] amen turn in your Bibles to the book of
[46:59] first Peter the fifth chapter we're
[47:02] going to continue preaching on what we
[47:04] did this morning but I would like to
[47:05] read this verse this a few verses here
[47:08] out of this book and then we'll go back
[47:11] amen to the book of Genesis and continue
[47:17] in that same thought this morning we
[47:21] were speaking on without human
[47:22] intervention amen and we would like to
[47:25] continue on in the same manner this
[47:27] evening first Peter 5 the fifth verse
[47:35] likewise ye younger submit yourself unto
[47:39] the elder yay all of you be subject one
[47:44] to another and be clothed with humility
[47:50] for God resisteth the proud and giveth
[47:54] grace to the humble
[47:56] to subject yourself one to another you
[47:59] must open yourself one to another humble
[48:04] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[48:06] hand of God that he may exalt you in due
[48:10] time Paul Peter is telling us that amen
[48:15] unless we humble ourself into the
[48:18] eldership and unto one another and to
[48:20] the order that God has placed in the
[48:22] church and in the body until we've done
[48:24] that you can't even humble yourself to
[48:26] God you have to humble yourself to God's
[48:29] order it's not a rule of man ruling over
[48:33] you in Dominion amen for their own sake
[48:36] and for their own a man ability and for
[48:39] their own position but it's the order
[48:41] that God has set up because he could
[48:42] have caused anything to preach the
[48:44] gospel brother Branham said he could
[48:46] have used the moon the Sun he could have
[48:48] used anything but he chose man to do it
[48:50] and then on top of that unfortunately
[48:52] one of the hardest things to do is get
[48:53] one man to believe another so he says
[48:57] humble ourselves one to another humble
[49:01] yourselves under the mighty hand of God
[49:03] that he may exalt you in due time cast
[49:09] all your care upon him for he careth for
[49:14] you be sober be vigilant because your
[49:18] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[49:22] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[49:25] whom resist steadfast in the faith
[49:27] knowing that the same afflictions are
[49:30] accomplished in your brethren that are
[49:33] in the world you understand that as we
[49:36] stand in this congregation there's many
[49:38] afflictions that are the same thing
[49:40] you've gone through maybe it's covered
[49:41] up maybe it's hid maybe somebody else
[49:43] don't know about it but the same things
[49:45] are accomplished in your brethren now
[49:48] the devil tells you you're the only one
[49:50] you're the only one but the God of all
[49:59] Grace who hath called us into his
[50:03] eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that
[50:06] you have suffered a while make you
[50:08] perfect stablish strengthen settle to
[50:10] you to him be glory and Dominion for
[50:13] ever and ever amen you can be seated
[50:16] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[50:18] word I just want to a man just read a
[50:24] couple of the scriptures that I read
[50:25] this morning if that's okay just to
[50:28] refresh your memory of Isaac and Rebecca
[50:31] so we remember that amen Rebecca was
[50:36] barren and with Berenice arises a lot of
[50:41] questions with Berenice bitterness can
[50:46] come in attitudes and complexes
[50:50] bitterness
[50:51] Berenice is a prison baroness a man
[50:56] causes you to try to manufacture
[50:58] something and try to look to do
[51:00] something that a man that you've tried
[51:03] to produce and you've tried to bring
[51:05] forth life and it calls to mind how
[51:08] Sarah and Abraham were that Sarah
[51:11] because she could not produce amen the
[51:15] the the seed that was being called for
[51:17] she manufactured something because out
[51:20] of her bare
[51:21] serosa desperation to produce the
[51:23] promise and yet it wasn't being produced
[51:25] and the Bible says that Isaac entreated
[51:29] the Lord for his wife because she was
[51:30] barren and the Lord was entreated of him
[51:32] and Rebecca his wife conceived it so she
[51:35] had a struggle in her womb and didn't
[51:37] understand what the struggle was and she
[51:39] said if it be so why am i thus if this
[51:46] is what I was supposed to have why am I
[51:49] having this struggle and she went to
[51:52] inquire of the Lord and the Lord said
[51:54] two nations are in the womb two men our
[51:56] people shall be separated from the
[51:58] boughs one people shall be stronger than
[52:00] the other and the elder shall serve the
[52:03] younger the elder shall serve the
[52:07] younger this is the direct word of the
[52:11] Lord now we live in the time and the
[52:15] hour of course we know and believe it's
[52:18] the end time and it's not just because
[52:20] we believe it and see the science
[52:22] happening all around us it's been
[52:24] announced by the prophet of God we're at
[52:25] the end time amen there's no other age
[52:28] to come amen we're right on the on the
[52:31] doorstep of the Millennium can you say
[52:33] Amen
[52:34] hey man it's the going home time for the
[52:36] bride of Jesus Christ God has unveiled
[52:38] himself before us this is the hour of
[52:41] the unveiling of God we as a people here
[52:45] this evening set here as the most
[52:48] spiritually informed people that's ever
[52:51] been on the face of the earth amen you
[52:54] have more of a spiritual depository than
[52:57] any prophet has ever had Amen any men of
[53:00] God you can read about in the Bible you
[53:02] have more that's been handed to you that
[53:05] you have it's your disposal to use in
[53:07] your walk with God than anybody in
[53:10] history and yet we struggle and we also
[53:16] are the most conflicted people and we
[53:21] are the weakest people Paul said this
[53:25] know also that in the last days perilous
[53:27] times would come we are truly in
[53:32] perilous time
[53:33] I mean that word perilous apparently
[53:36] means it's fierce it's hard to take and
[53:38] in men Amiens hearts are failing them
[53:41] for fear people are turning away and
[53:43] walking away from the truth without
[53:45] natural a fleck affection seemingly your
[53:48] friends and everybody just separate
[53:50] without any care and it has an effect
[53:53] upon you what an hour that we live in
[53:59] but God didn't leave us without
[54:01] resources he man as I've already said we
[54:06] have the most resources of any time in
[54:08] history but I want to read to you this
[54:10] this statement brother Branham makes in
[54:12] in the man running a man running from
[54:14] the presence of the Lord and as he's
[54:16] praying he says may all the great
[54:19] mysteries that we are supposed to know
[54:21] at this age Lord be unveiled to us I
[54:26] mean say Amen that's my desire and will
[54:31] see the plainness of God so what is the
[54:35] unveiling of a mystery for to see the
[54:38] plainness of God and what is the reason
[54:41] for us to see the plainness of God so
[54:44] that we'll know how to behave ourselves
[54:47] and to act correcting ourselves because
[54:53] when you see what's right as a believer
[54:55] you automatically bring your body into
[54:58] correction of what you've seen and it
[55:01] brings your action into that correcting
[55:03] ourself and bringing the members of our
[55:06] body into discipline to the word that we
[55:08] might know how to live in this present
[55:12] day at the approaching of the Lord Jesus
[55:14] Christ you see the unveiling of God the
[55:17] great mysteries of God the opening of
[55:19] the word amen was not Amen to make up
[55:21] camps and divisions and more spiritual
[55:24] people more high-minded people it was
[55:26] never intended for that but it was so
[55:28] that you would know how to live humbly
[55:29] that you would know how to walk humbly
[55:32] that you would know how to live and
[55:33] correct your own self bringing your body
[55:36] into the Dominion of the word of
[55:38] and be able to present your body as a
[55:40] living sacrifice I mean say man so one
[55:48] of the mysteries to be revealed in this
[55:51] time is the mystery of the baptism of
[55:54] the holy ghost without sensation right
[55:57] the baptism of the holy ghost without
[55:59] traditions but the Word of God in full
[56:03] effect in you amen
[56:08] the person of Jesus Christ the full word
[56:11] the full Word of God not the full
[56:13] textbook of God but perfect
[56:17] interpretation with divine vindication
[56:20] amen don't leave out the divine so just
[56:24] say we have Amen the perfect
[56:26] interpretation don't leave out the
[56:29] divine for without the divine the
[56:31] perfect interpretation is meaningless
[56:36] man and so I'm here this evening amen
[56:39] and you just excuse me now I want all
[56:41] you tired people in here this is a
[56:42] buckle up your armor now and help me out
[56:44] preach the Word of God all right I mean
[56:46] because we want to put Devils on the run
[56:48] and then the devil is like a roaring
[56:50] line we've already read and he's out to
[56:52] seek and devour he's out after these
[56:54] young people he's out after you he's out
[56:56] after your worship he's out after
[56:58] everything you proclaim and say that you
[57:00] believe now reject those spirits that
[57:02] try to come in and hinder you hearing
[57:04] the Word of God the resentments that
[57:06] creep in and who does that guy think he
[57:08] is and all that just throw it aside now
[57:12] begin to enter in and say Lord Here I am
[57:14] now I want you to speak to me I want you
[57:17] to look at me with those eyes
[57:20] not eyes of fire but eyes of love
[57:23] that'll come in and walk in the corridor
[57:26] of my life go into my uncomfortable
[57:28] places that have been my prison-house
[57:30] and set me free from that young people I
[57:33] challenge you this evening if you humble
[57:36] yourself to God and be a real man with
[57:38] the words come the time that David was
[57:46] dying and then Solomon is fixing to set
[57:51] on the throne is that a word here y'all
[57:52] use fixing okay good
[57:55] I don't have to explain it to you hey
[57:59] man he was getting ready to get on the
[58:00] throne
[58:01] hey man and there was things in David's
[58:03] David's life that hadn't been completed
[58:06] things that he didn't deal with and
[58:07] maybe he didn't have the strength to
[58:08] deal with and maybe he didn't even have
[58:10] the right to deal with because some of
[58:11] it was his own doing but men like Joab
[58:15] his cousin had been his right-hand man
[58:17] they've been his general over all the
[58:20] army but that man began to do his own
[58:21] thing and he brought a man he killed a
[58:24] man at the how at the doorstep of of
[58:27] Hebron him in one of the cities of
[58:29] refuge and he pulled him out there in
[58:31] deceit and killed him and a man in the
[58:34] blood amen David said let that blood
[58:35] come upon you and upon your house but
[58:38] David didn't clean it out
[58:41] amen amen the man that cursed David and
[58:45] the man wanted his men want to draw
[58:47] their swords and take his head off and
[58:49] and David said leave him alone God told
[58:51] him to do that
[58:52] but even though God told him to do that
[58:54] didn't mean God wouldn't deal with that
[58:56] and it came the hour all these things
[58:59] amen amen the counselors I had come
[59:02] against David I mean he told Solomon now
[59:04] Solomon's taking the throne he said
[59:06] Solomon show yourself a man and young
[59:11] people it's time to be a man with the
[59:13] Word of God even young ladies it's time
[59:16] to be full grown with the Word of God
[59:18] it's time to put aside all of our
[59:21] petitions it's time to put aside all of
[59:23] our facades put aside all that we
[59:26] pretend to be and come
[59:27] to him just as you are if God is gonna
[59:33] do anything in your lives you can't come
[59:35] like your mama
[59:36] you can't come like your daddy you can't
[59:39] come with the excuses of the past say
[59:42] brother daddy you don't know where I've
[59:43] been but I tell you he knows where
[59:44] you've been some of you're just too
[59:49] proud to admit little things that are
[59:53] there human intervention intervention
[1:00:00] means to intervene means to become true
[1:00:03] to between two times or come between an
[1:00:06] event means to come between by way of
[1:00:10] hindrance or modification you know
[1:00:16] there's been a lot of intervening with
[1:00:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost down
[1:00:19] through the ages where we've modified it
[1:00:22] we've changed it we said if you do this
[1:00:26] it'll come but God doesn't want any of
[1:00:30] that because when we modify it then we
[1:00:34] are we are basing ourselves we are
[1:00:37] basing our confidence on something
[1:00:39] that's been modified you remember
[1:00:42] brother meant him talked about Amen he
[1:00:44] always wanted a rather or Wetherby rifle
[1:00:45] Amen and so some brothers took a rifle
[1:00:48] and had it bored out to be a Weatherby
[1:00:50] but it wasn't made by the by the
[1:00:52] manufacturer it was made by another
[1:00:54] company because it was a board Amen
[1:00:57] right and it wasn't the right rifle when
[1:00:59] he put it up to target practice it blew
[1:01:01] up in his face
[1:01:02] that's something that's been amen
[1:01:04] intervened with something that's been
[1:01:07] amen amen modified them tell you many
[1:01:09] people have come to the altar gave their
[1:01:11] heart to the Lord went back and said I
[1:01:12] got the Holy Ghost but because Amen they
[1:01:15] didn't go all the way with God it blew
[1:01:16] up in their face down the road
[1:01:18] God wants something to live inside of
[1:01:21] you he wants his own life to live there
[1:01:23] where that way you don't have to quit
[1:01:24] anything you have to try anymore it
[1:01:30] won't be hit your life it'll be his life
[1:01:33] amen for our life is dance
[1:01:36] and it's hit he takes you so far into
[1:01:39] Christ a min that the devil's he ever
[1:01:41] got back there to you he would be born
[1:01:43] again with you
[1:01:45] come on Church God wants to take you so
[1:01:49] far into his presence tonight Amy that
[1:01:52] does not even be a shadow of doubt in
[1:01:54] your life a story of Isaac and Rebekah
[1:02:02] is actually an ugly story of human
[1:02:05] nature it's also the story of a family
[1:02:08] that's been blessed of God they've
[1:02:10] received all that Abraham had Abraham
[1:02:14] was a very rich man he was a very rich
[1:02:15] landowner he's very well respected most
[1:02:18] of all he had revelation of God and God
[1:02:21] said haven't seen that Abraham will
[1:02:23] teach his children I'm not going to hide
[1:02:24] anything from him what I'm going to do
[1:02:26] him in and he blessed Abraham he blessed
[1:02:29] him in his home he blessed him with land
[1:02:31] he blessed him with riches and so all of
[1:02:33] these blessings came upon Isaac and
[1:02:37] Rebekah and Isaac and Rebecca's own life
[1:02:40] are a result of the supernatural
[1:02:44] I think amen came when his mom and dad
[1:02:47] was a hundred and seventy five years old
[1:02:49] a man not a hundred and seventy five by
[1:02:53] 101 and seventy five years old
[1:02:55] amen amen they came God had to change
[1:02:58] their bodies in order for Isaac to be
[1:03:00] born it was a result of the supernatural
[1:03:02] Rebecca coming amen and being of the
[1:03:06] wife of Isaac was a result of the
[1:03:09] supernatural where the angel that was
[1:03:11] with Abraham a man went before Eliezer
[1:03:13] and beat Eliezer by the space of about
[1:03:16] 30 minutes and met her at the well and
[1:03:19] prepared her life to receive the message
[1:03:22] that would come will you go marry this
[1:03:25] man and then they've been given prophesy
[1:03:33] themself of their own children it is no
[1:03:37] mistake that a man in in the foundation
[1:03:40] of the gospel and the foundation of
[1:03:44] Israel Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph
[1:03:47] that Jacob is the grace part
[1:03:50] and brother venom said that it was God
[1:03:53] working out through all of these men he
[1:03:56] was working his own life out through
[1:03:58] there showing himself in faith and
[1:04:00] justification and in in grace and in
[1:04:03] perfection you see because grace gives
[1:04:05] way to perfection you have grace speak
[1:04:09] about grace but it must give way to
[1:04:11] perfection can you say Amen amen this
[1:04:15] story
[1:04:15] Amen then that we are reading as the
[1:04:18] results of prophecy amen and it shows a
[1:04:22] man prophecy and then how they brought
[1:04:25] the prophecy into the intellectual realm
[1:04:27] and it shows how we use our abilities to
[1:04:31] help God fulfill his own word as we know
[1:04:35] God don't want our abilities he wants
[1:04:37] your vessel and this couple Isaac and
[1:04:41] Rebecca they have been brought to earth
[1:04:43] to fulfill a very important piece of the
[1:04:48] puzzle or tapestry if you will of God's
[1:04:51] mystery that he would reveal in this in
[1:04:53] time
[1:04:54] do you imagine how god amen builds his
[1:04:57] his word as he builds it through the
[1:04:59] lives of people and sometimes his very
[1:05:01] prophecy would hinge upon one person
[1:05:03] coming and doing something that would be
[1:05:06] an interlocking piece of puzzle that
[1:05:08] would fit right in he would let his but
[1:05:10] he would let a mean his prophecy
[1:05:12] dwindled down to one person one person
[1:05:14] on earth that if they did not step
[1:05:16] forward and fulfill that part it would
[1:05:18] that prophecy would go into the ground
[1:05:20] as a failure but every time every time
[1:05:24] it looked like it was drawing itself out
[1:05:27] amen that person would step up ain't
[1:05:29] been supernaturally drawn and feel that
[1:05:31] place think about it I say I made a
[1:05:33] prophecy he didn't understand a virgin
[1:05:35] shall conceive aiming and that prophecy
[1:05:37] went around and around and around and
[1:05:41] around the world and it kept going
[1:05:43] around waiting for a womb to anchor in
[1:05:46] amen and it took about eight hundred
[1:05:48] years but one day there was a little
[1:05:50] virgin amen only about fifteen or
[1:05:53] sixteen years old
[1:05:54] hey man you don't have to be super
[1:05:56] spiritual a great of age to a man come
[1:05:59] and fulfill a and part of the Word of
[1:06:01] God
[1:06:02] and she's just walking to the well
[1:06:04] there's a flicker of light and there's
[1:06:05] an angel standing there and I'm going to
[1:06:09] begin to tell her you're highly favored
[1:06:11] of God it didn't seem to make sense to
[1:06:15] her one person that had to say be it
[1:06:20] unto me according to thy word amen
[1:06:24] Genesis 24 is a major part of the puzzle
[1:06:29] explaining God's purpose at the end time
[1:06:31] in fact amen amen God used this
[1:06:35] scripture amen to point out amen brother
[1:06:37] Venom's brother branham's Commission and
[1:06:41] what God had placed him on the earth to
[1:06:42] do go get a bride for Isaac amen it's a
[1:06:49] stand out message that has been preached
[1:06:51] it's been sung about the father the
[1:06:54] faithful servant the presence of the
[1:06:57] angel the woman at the evening time
[1:06:59] watering the camels and the decision to
[1:07:01] go meet Isaac little did they know that
[1:07:04] they were living out the desire of the
[1:07:06] of God to bring a bride in this evening
[1:07:09] time who would be faithful to the
[1:07:12] servants message so you would think that
[1:07:15] past experiences and blessings would
[1:07:18] teach him the right moves
[1:07:24] Rebekah is barren and Isaac entreated
[1:07:28] the Lord and the Lord heard his prayer
[1:07:30] and in Rebecca's pregnancy the children
[1:07:34] struggled together in the womb prompting
[1:07:37] her to ask the Lord at it if this
[1:07:39] pregnancy is really of you why do I have
[1:07:43] this struggle you see because it's human
[1:07:46] nature to think that God cannot be in
[1:07:50] something if it's a struggle can I say
[1:07:58] that again it's human nature to think
[1:08:01] that God cannot be in something if it's
[1:08:04] not a struggle we want it to come easy
[1:08:12] we don't understand the struggle but God
[1:08:17] was faithful to her to reveal to her
[1:08:20] that you have two nations in your womb
[1:08:22] and that separation has already begun in
[1:08:25] your body and the elder will serve the
[1:08:30] younger now this is prophecy this is
[1:08:33] direct word of the Lord the elder shall
[1:08:37] serve the younger
[1:08:39] we don't underst wrong understand the
[1:08:41] struggles we have and it is because the
[1:08:48] separation has already begun as as as
[1:08:53] birth is fixing to come forth it is a
[1:08:56] pain so I brother Branham preached the
[1:08:59] birth pains and talked about the
[1:09:01] struggle that the earth was under me but
[1:09:03] he said it's fixing to birth and it's a
[1:09:07] struggle we don't want the struggle but
[1:09:14] the struggle is necessary to the
[1:09:17] fulfilling of the Word of God amen
[1:09:22] you know brother bana made a statement
[1:09:24] that the Pentecostals don't like but
[1:09:25] whether it is he says God's side is
[1:09:27] always weak thank you for a men in that
[1:09:36] God's eyes is always weak he said but
[1:09:40] that's how God uses them
[1:09:42] he said that's God's Way of getting to
[1:09:45] us is when we're weak now I want you to
[1:09:52] notice something particulars we just
[1:09:54] come through this at the birth of Esau
[1:09:57] and Jacob caused the separation in the
[1:09:59] household of Isaac and Rebekah because
[1:10:06] they played the favorites and because
[1:10:10] they played the favorites it affected
[1:10:12] the way they looked at the prophecy the
[1:10:15] prophecies holy the prophecy is God's
[1:10:18] Word the prophecy cannot be changed no
[1:10:21] matter how you try to say it change it
[1:10:23] no
[1:10:23] you try to dress it up it is what it
[1:10:25] says it is the elder shall serve the
[1:10:28] younger but look at this because they
[1:10:30] have favourites it influenced the way
[1:10:32] they dealt with their children the Wills
[1:10:35] and affections of the parents worse at
[1:10:38] odds with the working of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:42] you know that causes confusion in the
[1:10:45] home and I know this may seem strange as
[1:10:47] a as a youth camp message but you know
[1:10:49] what you know we we need to to come
[1:10:54] right down to the level of our lives
[1:10:57] begin to deal in those levels and maybe
[1:11:00] you're sitting here and maybe things
[1:11:02] have been at odds that you're in your
[1:11:04] household amen and it sets you at odds
[1:11:06] with the Word of God with the working of
[1:11:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:11:11] but God has already made a statement and
[1:11:13] God is faithful to his words and no
[1:11:17] matter how much we try to intervene Amen
[1:11:19] and try to work
[1:11:20] Amen according to the permissive will of
[1:11:22] God God will make it work back for his
[1:11:24] glory because it's now up to God to
[1:11:30] fulfill his word brother Branham said in
[1:11:33] the message Satan's even that the Spirit
[1:11:35] of God is not something that is schooled
[1:11:38] into you can I say that again you know
[1:11:45] since we're tired sometimes we have to
[1:11:47] repeat ourselves but the problem with
[1:11:50] repeating ourselves it's going to take
[1:11:51] longer to get through this amen but he
[1:11:54] said Amen that the Spirit of God is not
[1:11:57] something that can be schooled into you
[1:12:00] it is something that is predestinated
[1:12:04] into you
[1:12:06] amen what is predestination it's the
[1:12:09] thought of God it's the destiny of your
[1:12:12] life Amen in God predestinated
[1:12:15] predestined it to take place think about
[1:12:19] it now what if this moment here in this
[1:12:22] building even in your tiredness God has
[1:12:24] said I have predestined in this night
[1:12:28] for them to receive my life
[1:12:35] glory it's something that's
[1:12:41] predestinated into you by the hand of
[1:12:43] Almighty God your experiences cannot be
[1:12:46] schooled or taught into you want to
[1:12:48] rebuke to the churches
[1:12:52] you know we've spent hours and we spent
[1:12:55] years of ministry trying to explain the
[1:12:58] Holy Ghost experience to people and many
[1:13:03] times it's coming out of our own
[1:13:05] experience amen but let me just tell you
[1:13:09] this I mean my experience cannot be
[1:13:12] yours I mean if my experience causes you
[1:13:17] to act like me if I'm a hear of preach
[1:13:19] and I I shake my head and then my whole
[1:13:21] congregation shaking my head what do I
[1:13:23] got them in the spirit of I got them in
[1:13:24] my spirit brother BAM said what the
[1:13:27] minister should always stay in the
[1:13:28] spirit of the word amen so that the
[1:13:30] spirit of the word will be upon the
[1:13:32] people amen so I'm coming to you not in
[1:13:35] my own spirit but I'm coming to you in
[1:13:37] the spirit of the word so that as you're
[1:13:39] here and you begin to open yourself up
[1:13:41] to the Word of God say where they God
[1:13:43] speak a mean word of God move word of
[1:13:46] god make the things of my life
[1:13:48] coming right to the Word of God that's
[1:13:52] supernatural glory
[1:14:02] it's predestinated by God's hand and
[1:14:05] it's predestinated by God's knowledge
[1:14:07] into you but in the home of Isaac and
[1:14:11] Rebekah there's differences of opinions
[1:14:15] and desires and both are true to the
[1:14:19] object of their desires Isaac loved Esau
[1:14:23] best Isaac is a prophet but he is moved
[1:14:29] by the venison he's moved by the
[1:14:31] character of Esau to set his affections
[1:14:34] upon Esau so it causes him to set aside
[1:14:39] the will of God and aim at the wrong
[1:14:43] object the supernatural is not moved by
[1:14:51] us but I'll say that the supernatural
[1:14:55] has moved in on us we see the same
[1:14:59] characteristic and he saw that when he's
[1:15:01] hungry he sells his birthright for a
[1:15:04] bowl of pottage amen he took a holy
[1:15:08] thing and he watered it down to his
[1:15:13] desire at that moment young people don't
[1:15:17] miss this moment don't set aside the
[1:15:22] preaching of the word for some fantasy
[1:15:24] or imagination that's in your mind right
[1:15:26] now don't set it aside for some worldly
[1:15:29] friendship or some connection that you
[1:15:31] got in your spirit that's not of God
[1:15:33] don't set it aside for some pleasure he
[1:15:43] set it aside
[1:15:45] Rebekah is aiming at the right object
[1:15:49] which is Jacob her favorite but she's
[1:15:53] doing it in a sinful way both are trying
[1:15:57] to have faith and both are trying to
[1:16:01] bring the word to pass and both are
[1:16:02] wrong you see so the motives of the
[1:16:07] parents aimed the children in the wrong
[1:16:11] direction
[1:16:13] the Bible says in the Book of Psalms 127
[1:16:16] chapter lo children our heritage of the
[1:16:19] Lord and the fruit of the womb is his
[1:16:21] reward as arrows are in the hand of a
[1:16:26] mighty man a mighty man is a man of
[1:16:30] experience a mighty man is a man who's
[1:16:33] fought battles that's why he's called
[1:16:34] mighty that he's been victorious in and
[1:16:37] he said his children are as arrows in
[1:16:39] the hand of a mighty man so are the
[1:16:42] children of the youth happy is the man
[1:16:45] that hath his quiver full of them
[1:16:48] they shall not be ashamed but they shall
[1:16:51] speak with the enemies in the gate so if
[1:16:52] you have an arrow in your quiver God
[1:16:54] you that arrow so that the mighty man
[1:16:56] could aim it at the right target our
[1:17:00] children are to be aimed at the right
[1:17:02] target are you with me
[1:17:06] you children are to be aimed at the
[1:17:08] right target what is the target you know
[1:17:11] what I mean the world has come in and
[1:17:12] and wrapped its tentacles around our
[1:17:14] thinking and around our opinions until
[1:17:17] we a men begin to let the culture affect
[1:17:20] the way we live the message we begin to
[1:17:24] we begin to put our emphasis amen on our
[1:17:27] on our schooling's and on our ambitions
[1:17:30] and upon everything that we even want to
[1:17:32] do in life and don't see how far we
[1:17:34] begin to step away from the will of God
[1:17:36] when God says I want to aim you I want
[1:17:41] to make your life something that hits
[1:17:42] the target that you won't be left in
[1:17:46] confusion but when I shoot it out of the
[1:17:48] bowl it hits the bull's eye every time
[1:17:50] and you'll be able to speak with the
[1:17:54] enemy and the dictates of judgment we
[1:17:59] don't want our young people confused we
[1:18:02] don't want our young people showing up
[1:18:04] to church because their daddy and mommy
[1:18:06] dragged him there come on God made a
[1:18:11] promise that he would bless but those
[1:18:13] blessings are under condition and you've
[1:18:15] got to meet the conditions to make it
[1:18:17] work this may seem like it's off topic
[1:18:23] but you just just bear with me brother
[1:18:26] Bantam said I was sitting with a little
[1:18:28] sweet girl here and first I calmed that
[1:18:32] family through to see if there is
[1:18:33] anything wrong because they was wanting
[1:18:35] to be healed he said God would heal but
[1:18:40] it's under conditions and the only thing
[1:18:43] I found was the mother was afraid it was
[1:18:45] wrong to take medicine now who told her
[1:18:49] is wrong to take medicine somewhere
[1:18:52] along the line her faith got scrupled up
[1:18:55] with if I take medicine I don't have
[1:18:57] faith and the angel of the Lord pointed
[1:19:02] that out in her life and said that's the
[1:19:03] only thing wrong that's hindering that
[1:19:05] healing
[1:19:07] a man he said he said don't you take
[1:19:12] don't you think that sister get that out
[1:19:14] of your mind go right ahead with the
[1:19:16] child and give it the medicine God will
[1:19:18] make it known it ever because her faith
[1:19:23] I mean has been so misconstrued we tried
[1:19:25] to live up to a pattern we've tried to
[1:19:26] live up to a style we've tried to live
[1:19:28] up to a presentation that it has to be a
[1:19:31] certain way and if I if I'm not healed I
[1:19:33] don't have faith and oh man my truth my
[1:19:35] toothache hurts Oh God heal my toothache
[1:19:37] God hear my god why do I have a
[1:19:39] toothache and I must not have rapture in
[1:19:41] faith the message has been presented
[1:19:44] wrong that's nothing to do with rapture
[1:19:50] in faith brother Branham was speaking to
[1:19:52] a church that did not believe in divine
[1:19:54] healing they actively taught against
[1:19:57] divine healing man you can even brother
[1:20:01] branham amen had a reoccurrence of a
[1:20:03] stomach problem every 7 years of his
[1:20:06] life amen so I've heard it said that if
[1:20:10] brother Brant brother I heard us say
[1:20:11] that brother meant him died because he
[1:20:13] didn't have rapture in faith it's been
[1:20:15] preached over pulpit that's nonsense
[1:20:18] that's foolishness what is rapture in
[1:20:21] faith you are chicken in a barnyard
[1:20:23] you only knew how to look at the ground
[1:20:25] ami but one day an eagle stream and it
[1:20:27] took your eyes off the ground and you
[1:20:29] lifted your eyes heavenward now you're
[1:20:32] no longer looking at ugly things your
[1:20:34] eyes are on heavenly that's rapturing
[1:20:37] faith that kind of teaching that kind of
[1:20:43] teaching only brings in legalism on the
[1:20:45] church and begins to kill the people one
[1:20:47] by one by one Satan it's like a roaring
[1:20:50] lion and he cloaks himself in the
[1:20:53] theologies of people that handle the
[1:20:55] message wrong God help me to handle the
[1:20:58] message rightly define
[1:20:59] the truth we are called to be stewards
[1:21:04] of the Word of God not to use it as a
[1:21:06] club to beat the church down every time
[1:21:09] they try to rise up in revolution you
[1:21:17] just forgive me I'm acting like I'm at
[1:21:19] home
[1:21:19] I always find out brother bam said these
[1:21:29] people are trying to manufacture
[1:21:31] something and people you come to God for
[1:21:37] the Holy Ghost tonight don't come
[1:21:39] because your mom wants to you don't come
[1:21:47] with a certain style or a certain way
[1:21:49] and hope it works out I'll see if it
[1:21:50] happens brother BAM said people are
[1:21:57] trying to help God to make his promise
[1:22:01] come true I'm gonna go in something real
[1:22:04] personal here in the message of paradox
[1:22:06] brother BAM talks about something very
[1:22:08] personal but no doubt it'll affect lives
[1:22:09] in this building because even human
[1:22:11] nature runs the church once true he said
[1:22:15] a lot of modernists believe that the
[1:22:17] days of miracles are past they don't
[1:22:18] believe there's such a thing as America
[1:22:20] but yet I believe the world is full of
[1:22:22] miracles for instance I believe that
[1:22:29] every born-again member of the body of
[1:22:30] Christ is a paradox in themselves that's
[1:22:33] a miracle
[1:22:34] amen I want a confession here this
[1:22:36] evening how many been born again stand
[1:22:38] to your feet and you say there's no
[1:22:40] miracles happening look at all the
[1:22:43] miracles sit down thank you
[1:22:50] it's quite a statement that's people
[1:22:53] that escape the clutches of Satan
[1:23:00] all you men stand up they got the Holy
[1:23:02] Ghost just the men aw just the elder man
[1:23:04] you you you boys say stay down it's the
[1:23:08] elders okay everybody turn to look at
[1:23:11] these men

[1:23:18] up have been tempted to quit raise your
[1:23:21] hand well good grief
[1:23:30] how many of you men standing up the
[1:23:32] devil told you that you've had that
[1:23:35] thought in your mind many times more
[1:23:37] than once you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:23:39] look people look at him now
[1:23:41] look at him why in the world is a Holy
[1:23:44] Ghost film in fighting these kind of
[1:23:46] battles how many of men they then have
[1:23:51] felt old desires try to climb back up in
[1:23:53] you come on come at your door come on
[1:24:00] raise your hand people look at them old
[1:24:04] desires try to come back try to haunt
[1:24:07] you pick at your windows brother ben
[1:24:10] says torment you look young people they
[1:24:14] got the Holy Ghost and they got real
[1:24:17] life struggles many of these are
[1:24:22] preachers or maybe all how many of you
[1:24:23] preachers raise your hand and they raise
[1:24:28] their hand their preacher and here
[1:24:31] they've they said they felt they felt
[1:24:34] old desires try to come back I didn't
[1:24:36] say they came back as they try to come
[1:24:37] back they've been told they don't have
[1:24:39] the Holy Ghost they've been told give up
[1:24:43] how many of you how many of you've had
[1:24:46] real life frustrations that nobody else
[1:24:49] knows about you went home and you wept
[1:24:50] about it it haunted you and troubled you
[1:24:53] maybe you even went into oppression and
[1:24:54] a little bit of nervousness and maybe
[1:24:56] complexes started coming on you and
[1:24:59] these are Christians and you thought a
[1:25:05] man that serving God is a picnic serving
[1:25:09] God is about how many mysteries you know
[1:25:11] how intelligently you can disperse it
[1:25:13] and hey let me tell you God did not talk
[1:25:16] to you about the third Pole amen in the
[1:25:17] opening of the word for them to be
[1:25:19] slogans in your life then the long as
[1:25:22] week Amen keep talking about it Amen
[1:25:24] that people say by that person's
[1:25:26] spiritual they really know a lot you can
[1:25:30] brother could sit down for a moment
[1:25:31] thank you I hope you stay awake a little
[1:25:33] bit longer
[1:25:36] I Pat myself on the back for that you
[1:25:41] see amen we make this a slogan what camp
[1:25:46] are you in and that camp reacts
[1:25:48] according to the nature of that slogan
[1:25:54] that is not what God ever intended the
[1:25:58] message to me like he never intended the
[1:26:04] message to be a choice of churches and a
[1:26:10] choice of dogma I'm just going to preach
[1:26:15] anyhow he always the message is Jesus
[1:26:20] Christ who is the same yesterday today
[1:26:24] and forever this message is about the
[1:26:27] life of God and it's a paradox Oh
[1:26:33] hallelujah say brother Danny you must
[1:26:37] have come from a Pentecostal background
[1:26:39] wrong I came from a midnight background
[1:26:45] they don't even know how to move well
[1:26:49] I'm telling you this has nothing to do
[1:26:51] with my background this has to do with
[1:26:52] my family tree that comes from glory

[1:27:22] are fallen to me in Pleasant places it
[1:27:25] was said of that scripture that that's
[1:27:27] must have been what Jesus Christ thought
[1:27:29] as he walked towards Calvary I have a
[1:27:35] goodly heritage I have some young people
[1:27:39] here in New Zealand the lines have
[1:27:42] fallen into me in Pleasant places for I
[1:27:44] know that rise
[1:27:46] up in the hour that I'm predestinated
[1:27:48] and they are going to accept what I have
[1:27:51] done they're not going to set back but
[1:27:53] they're going to be real soldiers and
[1:27:55] step out of the muck of their life
[1:27:57] they're going to be that Lily that comes
[1:27:59] up out of the mud and they press their
[1:28:02] way hallelujah you're going to press
[1:28:04] your way through it and you're gonna

[1:29:46] the god of this earth but I'm turning
[1:29:50] the tables Haman he came into my
[1:29:53] perfection

[1:42:23] real woman and Jacob said okay I've got
[1:42:30] to get serious with this thing and he
[1:42:31] sent his family across the brook and
[1:42:35] they sit there and a man appeared to him
[1:42:39] because this holy ghost is not the holy
[1:42:44] ghost with sensation it's the person
[1:42:49] person of Jesus Christ

[1:42:54] man and he wrestled all night I'm
[1:42:57] telling you that man wasn't weak but the
[1:42:59] Bible says in Hosea Amen that this man
[1:43:03] prevailed over God he didn't a man

[1:43:35] said the preaching of the word does not
[1:43:37] save you it does not heal you it's God
[1:43:40] that does all of that but what the
[1:43:42] preaching of the word does is the devil
[1:43:44] that is upon you has to stand back and
[1:43:46] let you listen to that service and make
[1:43:48] your choice and right now that devil has
[1:43:51] left your chair and he's standing over
[1:43:53] in the wings and you know don't believe

[1:44:35] amen but he took our sin
[1:44:38] and he laid it upon him Oh hallelujah
[1:44:45] before I come to Jacobs and Jacob had to
[1:44:50] talk right and when he wrestled
[1:44:54] if you go back and read in Genesis 27
[1:44:56] when II saw a man when Jacob was
[1:44:59] stealing the blessings amen and he's
[1:45:02] smelling and acting like he saw Isaac
[1:45:04] says who are you and he said I am Esau
[1:45:10] now he's wrestling with a man but it's
[1:45:13] not his father it's the man that met him
[1:45:17] in a dream and said hey man I'm not

[1:45:58] wrestling with him and some of you being
[1:46:00] wrestled with right now why that man

[1:48:16] you're good you know how to act you know
[1:48:20] how to talk you know what you are you're
[1:48:23] just a good Baptist there's a lot of
[1:48:27] Baptists in the message they just
[1:48:31] believe and they think that's all I got
[1:48:32] to do you have to have no power in their
[1:48:35] life to live a bust and it's the good
[1:48:37] Baptist a lot of Catholics in the
[1:48:40] message put a lot of idols in front of
[1:48:43] them even brother branham's an idol in
[1:48:44] front of them but you have a bunch of
[1:48:49] Catholics come on amen oh we got a bunch
[1:48:55] of Pentecostals in the message you've
[1:48:57] relied upon a sensation you've relied
[1:48:59] upon jumping you've relied upon shock we
[1:49:01] say no Danny are you speaking about all
[1:49:02] these brothers at a jump in here are you
[1:49:07] talking about alpha oh no you didn't
[1:49:12] hear me this morning then did you we can
[1:49:14] worship our God with the same exuberance
[1:49:16] as they worship their gods out there hey
[1:49:19] man but if you would ask how far am i
[1:49:21] serving God because I jumped no he can
[1:49:23] serve God in the down time - hey man

[1:49:29] still going to serve God yeah I want to
[1:49:31] still serve God amen when all the
[1:49:33] troubles rise around me I'll lift up my
[1:49:36] head and I still say I have a redeemer
[1:49:39] this faithful and true I'm gonna talk to
[1:49:45] young people about a faithful God
[1:49:47] tonight you got a faithful God I said
[1:49:50] you have a faithful God says it's going
[1:49:55] to give you - two - two stories I might
[1:49:57] give you three if I can remember I was
[1:50:00] doing a counseling session one time I
[1:50:03] don't like counseling sessions because
[1:50:06] half the time people don't tell the
[1:50:08] truth
[1:50:09] well they let me up that percentage 75%
[1:50:13] of time they don't tell the truth
[1:50:15] maybe I setup that percentage they just
[1:50:20] want me to take her side her dealing
[1:50:25] with a couple had marital problems
[1:50:27] that's shocking in the message there's
[1:50:28] marital problems because I found out
[1:50:31] after thirty years of ministry that
[1:50:34] actually there's actually humans in the
[1:50:36] message I didn't think they were I had a
[1:50:45] couple come in they were so rancorous to
[1:50:47] each others had so much problems from
[1:50:48] other when they came in to actually get
[1:50:52] counselors all right if I sit down thank
[1:50:54] you Amen yeah I pulled a chair upset
[1:50:56] right in front of them like I'm sitting
[1:50:58] in front of you and and they they were
[1:51:00] so at odds with one another that they
[1:51:02] actually faced me like this had their
[1:51:05] back to each other and they faced me
[1:51:09] like this so some of you came to church
[1:51:11] tonight so I began to talk to them and
[1:51:16] out of their mouth is he's done this and
[1:51:18] he's done that and out of her mouth is
[1:51:20] she's done this and she's done that and
[1:51:22] yes she's done this and he's done that
[1:51:25] she's done this and he's done that and
[1:51:28] she's done this and he's done that and
[1:51:30] she's done this and he's done that and
[1:51:34] she's done this and he's done that and
[1:51:38] you know they weren't being men and
[1:51:42] women was the problem I got tired of it
[1:51:47] I said alright you gonna mean business
[1:51:52] turn and look at one another it's couple
[1:51:57] been married for decades you should have
[1:52:00] saw how hard it was
[1:52:11] I said turn and face one another they
[1:52:16] faced one another
[1:52:17] I said take each other's hands
[1:52:28] I mean they had children and they you
[1:52:36] got it and they finally took one that's
[1:52:44] how hard it can get I said you know what
[1:52:48] we're not gonna be able to fix the
[1:52:50] problem by finding out how bad she is
[1:52:53] and how bad he is I told him cuz he's
[1:52:59] the head of the home he should know
[1:53:01] she's not a doormat he's not the head of
[1:53:03] the home in name only
[1:53:06] he thought he was I said tell me the
[1:53:11] best thing that comes to your mind that
[1:53:14] you can think about her it was a paradox
[1:53:21] he looked at her and he looked away he
[1:53:24] looked at her she goes you're gonna
[1:53:31] laugh but this was true well she makes
[1:53:36] good cookies
[1:53:40] I said is that all well I like how she
[1:53:49] rubs my back when it hurts he just
[1:53:51] started saying it started saying and I
[1:53:53] said now you say something nice she
[1:53:56] started saying something you know what
[1:53:59] happened all of a sudden the fourth man
[1:54:04] came he dropped down and the tears begin
[1:54:17] to roll out of their eyes I stood up I
[1:54:19] said you know what my counseling is done
[1:54:23] you make up you know because it has to
[1:54:28] become a paradox where you try to you
[1:54:30] try to go down every road and everything
[1:54:33] and it's just nothing but resentment and
[1:54:36] blame and everything pointing out you
[1:54:40] got to just open up before God this is
[1:54:43] the woman I love this is a woman I'm
[1:54:46] married who bore my children who took my
[1:54:48] name this is the man who took the
[1:54:50] responsibility of my my care upon him
[1:54:53] himself this is the man a man who's been
[1:54:55] with me all my life and here we have gum
[1:54:57] we have narrowed down our relationship
[1:55:00] to this well let me just tell you young
[1:55:05] people the Lord Jesus is not sick to you
[1:55:09] tonight but he's looking directly at you
[1:55:13] and he one I want to tell you the best
[1:55:18] things I can think about you
[1:55:28] you're all fair my love you're all fair
[1:55:34] there is no spot in you brother Danny
[1:55:37] what but what about it what about there
[1:55:39] is no spot on you that's what the word
[1:55:41] says because the word says it about you
[1:55:42] it is my obligation to bring you up to
[1:55:45] that now I'm gonna get real person
[1:56:05] anyway
[1:57:23] how's that okay sorry you see the devil
[1:57:27] don't like this because he knows you
[1:57:29] kids are gonna come out and so I got
[1:57:33] this call and this pastor is relating
[1:57:37] this story to me he had something happen
[1:57:42] in his church one of the married men in
[1:57:46] his church had went out and had an
[1:57:50] affair with another married man in a
[1:57:54] denominational Church homosexual affair
[1:58:00] both of those men were trapped in a
[1:58:03] place they didn't know well to get out
[1:58:04] of it but they wanted to get out of it
[1:58:07] they went to psychologist after
[1:58:09] psychologists nobody could help them
[1:58:11] they spent hours and hours and Rehab
[1:58:13] nothing could help them they went they
[1:58:16] went to the denominational pastor
[1:58:18] nothing helped one day that pastor was
[1:58:23] talking to the brother and his
[1:58:24] congregation when it started to come out
[1:58:25] and he found out about it he began to
[1:58:27] talk to him and that man was on the
[1:58:29] phone he says you don't know you don't
[1:58:33] know what it's like to be tempted by
[1:58:38] homosexuality the pastor's like I don't
[1:58:45] know he said you don't know he stirred
[1:58:48] screaming and crying said you don't know
[1:58:50] and the Holy Spirit spoke to the pastor
[1:58:57] and said tell him I know what it's like
[1:59:10] Jesus Christ was tempted yet without sin
[1:59:17] in all points a hair stood up on the
[1:59:25] back of my head and when he said that
[1:59:30] the phone went quiet then the man began
[1:59:36] to weep and deliverance came in and that
[1:59:42] man said I'm gonna come to church and
[1:59:44] I'm gonna confess what I've done before
[1:59:46] the church I'm gonna let him know that
[1:59:48] I've been set free and I'm gonna go to
[1:59:51] that denominational Church and I'm gonna
[1:59:52] let him know not only did God set that
[1:59:55] boy free he set the boy in the
[1:59:56] denominational Church free and that boy
[1:59:58] in the denominational Church said powers
[2:00:01] and hours of rehab nothing happened but
[2:00:03] five minutes five minutes come on in the
[2:00:10] presence of God amen because you have a
[2:00:13] man who is touched by the feeling of
[2:00:16] your infirmity it's time to get real
[2:00:22] with God who are you I am Jacob I am
[2:00:27] Jacob there was a day that our Lord
[2:00:35] Jesus was walking toward Calvary and he
[2:00:40] had made his decision in the Garden of
[2:00:43] Eden
[2:00:44] Lord if it be possible let this cup pass
[2:00:47] from me hi I would like to spend more
[2:00:51] time with the disciples he had a right
[2:00:53] to get married he had a right to a
[2:00:55] longer life but it was the hour of
[2:00:58] decision the angels of God had lined up
[2:01:01] in the bushes around there the demons of
[2:01:03] Hell had come in and they were all
[2:01:05] watching what is he going to say and the
[2:01:08] God began to talk to him can you take
[2:01:10] the sin of adultery can you take the sin
[2:01:12] of gambling can you take the sin of lust
[2:01:14] can you take this sin can you take that
[2:01:17] because there if your
[2:01:18] to be a high priest you've got to be
[2:01:21] able to take it and he said not my will
[2:01:25] but yours be done and the spirit left
[2:01:30] him there because he had to die like a
[2:01:31] man he had to die as a man God could not
[2:01:36] die but you and I were still in him
[2:01:39] there and he left he left the garden and
[2:01:43] he went out as a man he's hard into the
[2:01:45] pilots amen judgement hall and he's
[2:01:47] standing there and he says tell us who
[2:01:49] you are and he shut his mouth because
[2:01:56] he's not going to give any excuse to
[2:01:58] miss this death I said he's not gonna
[2:02:03] give any excuse to miss this death he
[2:02:07] opened up his mouth to begin to defend
[2:02:09] himself he had take away the power of
[2:02:10] Calvary because it says he open his
[2:02:15] shares he's dumb and he can't tell us
[2:02:18] who you are and he examined him and he
[2:02:21] turned to the rulers he said I don't
[2:02:23] find any fault in this man they said
[2:02:27] good salmon him again and he come and he
[2:02:29] looked and he talked to him again and he
[2:02:31] just stood there
[2:02:31] amen and he'd only answered the
[2:02:33] questions that took not away from what
[2:02:35] he was going to do he turned again and
[2:02:40] he says I find no fault in the man he
[2:02:44] said you got to you got to give him up
[2:02:46] then on this and this time it's just
[2:02:48] this season amen amen we can give up a
[2:02:52] prisoner so another one could take his
[2:02:54] place
[2:02:58] crucify him it's got to be you you've
[2:03:02] got to deliver him and he opened up the
[2:03:04] doors to the crowd and he says behold
[2:03:06] the man I find no fault in him brother
[2:03:16] Branham said God will make Satan testify
[2:03:25] and the Prophet said we hadn't separated
[2:03:27] yet from that body we were still in him
[2:03:30] and he says behold the man I find no
[2:03:34] fault say it with me in him three times
[2:03:42] the enemy pronounced there's nothing
[2:03:44] wrong there's nothing wrong there's
[2:03:47] nothing wrong he was only given over to
[2:03:50] Calvary to be a substitute amen and now
[2:03:56] he's going to the cross as a man he's
[2:03:58] been beaten more than any man's been
[2:04:00] beaten his bones are staring out I mean
[2:04:02] they took the the cat-o'-nine-tails and
[2:04:04] when they it had the hooks on it they
[2:04:06] hit it and it hooked his self and his
[2:04:08] flesh and they rip it out again and
[2:04:10] every time it ripped it rip flesh out
[2:04:12] until finally my bones my bones they
[2:04:16] stare at me till even his organs are
[2:04:20] beginning to show through the skin he's
[2:04:23] been beat beyond recognition there is no
[2:04:25] beauty in him that we should desire him
[2:04:28] he's been beaten till he's
[2:04:30] unrecognizable it's globs of spit on his
[2:04:32] face a crowned champ down in his head
[2:04:36] and he's weakening because a mortal man
[2:04:38] can't take this kind of punishment they
[2:04:41] put a cross on him a beam and he begins
[2:04:44] to walk and now he's struggling and he's
[2:04:48] walking young people why don't you step
[2:04:51] into this moment now because he's making
[2:04:53] that walk for you you don't even
[2:04:54] understand it and then he's beginning
[2:04:56] he's laboring in his walk and he can
[2:04:59] hardly hardly do it and finally he falls
[2:05:03] down on the ground hey man there's a
[2:05:07] black man alpha come over here there's a
[2:05:09] black man standing off there watch it
[2:05:12] man Jesus can't get up but Rome calls
[2:05:19] out to him help him alpha reach down
[2:05:29] because Jesus knows what it's like to
[2:05:33] need human assistance
[2:05:37] and they said alpha I'm just calling you
[2:05:40] alpha take his cross and he put it on
[2:05:44] and getting to walk in front of him and
[2:05:47] Jesus staggering behind him and the
[2:05:49] blood on that cross is falling down upon
[2:05:51] alpha hey man thank you God never
[2:06:00] forgotten what that man did for him was
[2:06:07] he laid on the ground now Jesus can
[2:06:12] stand him say I noticed like to need
[2:06:13] another human give me a hand up giving
[2:06:18] your hand this evening you're not too
