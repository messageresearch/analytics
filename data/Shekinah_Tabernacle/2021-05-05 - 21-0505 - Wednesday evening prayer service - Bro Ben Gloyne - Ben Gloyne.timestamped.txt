[25:36] said come see what the seal
[25:40] mystery is
[25:44] now we get it the lamb remember has to
[25:47] open every seal
[25:49] and the second beast if you notice in
[25:52] the routine of where we just went
[25:53] through the church stages the same thing
[25:55] the second first was a line the next was
[25:58] a was a
[25:59] was like a calf or a ox or something you
[26:01] see
[26:03] and this beast said come see
[26:06] now and when the lamb opened the seal
[26:10] and then uh he went to see and when he
[26:13] walked in
[26:14] what happened let's see what he found
[26:16] come see there's a mystery sealed up
[26:18] here
[26:19] that's been here now for two thousand
[26:20] years now let's see what it is
[26:23] now we find you
[26:27] that he saw what uh
[26:30] red horse go forward
[26:33] now to my understanding this to my
[26:36] understanding
[26:38] this great sword that he had in his hand
[26:42] now we got about three things to look at
[26:44] now for about the next 15-20 minutes
[26:48] let's just read and see what he says
[26:50] here
[26:52] and there went out the fourth verse
[26:54] there went out another horse
[26:58] that was red the person's wife
[27:02] and power was given unto him that set
[27:04] their own to take peace
[27:05] from the earth and they should kill one
[27:08] another
[27:09] and there was given him
[27:13] a great sword
[27:16] now there's symbols here
[27:20] and we want to look at them real close
[27:24] but to my understanding the best that i
[27:27] know now
[27:28] you see jesus predicted the same thing
[27:31] in matthew 24.
[27:32] amen see he said now you're going to
[27:35] hear of wars and rumors of wars and this
[27:38] wars and rumors of wars and wars and
[27:41] that's what all these ain't yeah
[27:42] yeah they time it yet see they asked
[27:46] jesus three questions
[27:47] thing and he answered him in three
[27:50] questions
[27:51] that's where a lot of our brethren got
[27:53] hanged up trying to place
[27:55] um of the adventist brethren about those
[27:57] seventh day and so forth back there to
[27:59] wander her to give child gets something
[28:01] the gates will be closed on the sabbath
[28:03] day and things like that
[28:04] mine they don't even pertain to the
[28:07] question at all
[28:09] not at all he's answering what they
[28:11] asked
[28:12] but he didn't he didn't uh
[28:15] it didn't apply at all to the last days
[28:18] he said you'll hear now we're
[28:19] working on this one thing here we'll
[28:20] come to some more of it in a few nights
[28:22] look he said you'll hear of wars
[28:25] and rumors of wars and so forth now
[28:28] all this is not see that and then
[28:30] they'll go back again and they'll
[28:32] deliver you up and so forth like this no
[28:34] oh that's not right yet
[28:35] but when he got to the time when he's
[28:37] going to talk to him about
[28:39] what they asked him about the end of the
[28:40] world when will all these things be when
[28:42] they're about to be once
[28:44] don't let that fall what will the sign
[28:46] be and we'll be coming to the end of the
[28:47] world
[28:47] see they asked him three things then
[28:50] when he got down to the end of the world
[28:52] he said when you see the fig tree
[28:53] putting forth his butt
[28:56] now you know all that the time is at the
[28:59] door
[29:00] and verily i say to you that this
[29:02] generation
[29:03] shall not pass until all be fulfilled
[29:07] how they infidel without the
[29:08] interpretation likes to lay on to that
[29:11] he said this generation not the
[29:12] generation is talking to the generation
[29:14] that's seen the
[29:15] fig tree putting forth his foot
[29:17] [Music]

[33:57] she said me an old woman well it ceased
[34:01] to be of them to husband and wife for
[34:02] years you know because
[34:03] he was 100 years old and she was 90
[34:07] said uh that will never happen and he
[34:10] said why did she laugh
[34:14] with his back turned to the tent
[34:17] why did she laugh saying how can these
[34:19] things be
[34:21] see amen he showed him a sign
[34:26] now he promises that this will repeat at
[34:28] the end time
[34:30] again the two men went down there and
[34:34] preached the word told them to get out
[34:35] of there the place is going to burn up
[34:36] and so forth
[34:37] and it did and lot started out the
[34:41] church
[34:42] natural down in sin
[34:45] in the mar but yet struggling along in
[34:49] their
[34:49] organizational programs but the
[34:52] bride that one man never went to them
[34:57] he went only and called the bride type
[35:00] amen
[35:03] now we're in the last days now notice
[35:07] you said their god manifested in the
[35:09] flesh
[35:10] jesus said himself how do you condemn me
[35:13] said is it written in your bible your
[35:16] laws
[35:17] that they the prophets who the word of
[35:20] god came to
[35:21] jesus said the word came to the prophets
[35:24] because he was scriptural and all things
[35:25] he said ah oh the word of god says that
[35:28] the word came to the prophets
[35:30] and you call them gods
[35:34] for the word of god came to him so then
[35:36] how are you going to condemn me when i
[35:37] say i'm the son of god
[35:38] amen
[35:42] there you are see now where are we at
[35:46] we're at the end time i listen real
[35:49] close now
[35:52] now we find out
[35:55] that there will be wars and rumors of
[35:57] wars and now we see
[36:00] that the fig trees put forth its buds
[36:03] and the other trees put forth their buds
[36:07] methodists baptists presbyterians and
[36:09] all put forth their buds
[36:11] a great revival going on now
[36:14] i believe that god's gathering the bride
[36:17] for that last hour the election
[36:22] oh my i notice
[36:26] let us now consider what john saw then
[36:29] if these things what he saw
[36:32] a red horse and his rider goes forth
[36:35] power given to him to slay with a great
[36:39] sword
[36:42] now here's my revelation of it
[36:45] this is satan again it's a devil
[36:50] again in another form now we know
[36:54] that that um seals pertained as it said
[36:58] the other night and trumpets pertain to
[37:02] civil wars you see amongst the people
[37:04] among
[37:05] nations but you find out here that this
[37:08] man has a sword so he pertains to
[37:11] church political war now you might not
[37:14] think that but just watch it a minute
[37:16] just a few minutes
[37:17] notice the
[37:20] change of color of these horses same
[37:23] rider
[37:26] change of color of horses and a horse is
[37:30] a beast
[37:31] and the beast in the bible and her
[37:32] symbol represents a power the same
[37:37] system riding on another color
[37:40] power from the innocent white to a
[37:44] bloody red
[37:46] see watch him now nice coming
[37:51] when he first started he was
[37:54] just uh well he's just a little doctrine
[37:57] in a
[37:57] in a much closer nicoladianism
[38:00] of course it wouldn't slay anything
[38:03] that's revelations 2 6 if you want to
[38:04] put it down
[38:05] he wouldn't slay anything it's just a
[38:07] doctrine it's a spirit amongst the
[38:08] people
[38:09] now he would say nothing oh he was so
[38:11] innocent right now this white horse
[38:13] well you know we could have a great
[38:15] worldwide church
[38:17] we could call it the universal church
[38:20] they still do
[38:20] all right see now we could have or it's
[38:24] perfectly innocent
[38:26] and um well it's so innocent it's just a
[38:29] group of
[38:30] man we'll all get together for
[38:32] fellowship see it's very innocence white
[38:34] the white horse was see
[38:36] now so the um uh
[38:39] dignitaries and the better dressed and
[38:42] the educated you know kind of like birds
[38:44] of a feather
[38:45] we'll kind of get things together and
[38:47] poor bunch why
[38:48] if they want to stumble along all right
[38:50] but we will get a better class
[38:52] coming to our church if we can just get
[38:55] ourselves pulled off right here we'll
[38:56] we'll be uh we'll be a bunch of masons
[38:59] or so forth you know we just have the
[39:01] things fixed up where
[39:02] our odd fellas are they are and so then
[39:05] not the odd fella lodge now but you know
[39:06] what i mean
[39:08] so um it's odd to the real believer
[39:11] now but otherwise we want a little group
[39:13] of little
[39:14] seneca we can call our own it's just a
[39:16] doctrine
[39:17] very innocent brother why we have
[39:19] nothing against you people
[39:21] certainly not you're all right but you
[39:22] know we feel that
[39:24] um if we have business and we'd be
[39:27] better off if we just had ourselves
[39:29] together
[39:29] see it finally went right on down to
[39:32] heaven
[39:33] yes sir get together but when this awful
[39:36] deceiving spirit
[39:38] oh man incarnated
[39:41] in incarnate
[39:44] spirit this doctrine spirit
[39:48] became incarnated to take the place of
[39:52] christ
[39:53] into a man it must be
[39:56] worship then turn to be a worship like
[39:59] christ
[40:00] in other words up over the vatican i've
[40:04] been right there
[40:06] it's wrote vicarius of phileodelia
[40:10] as wrote in roman numerals now you just
[40:13] draw a line at the bottom of those
[40:15] normal
[40:16] roman numerals and it means instead
[40:20] of son of god in other words he's a
[40:23] biker
[40:24] you know what a biker is just take the
[40:26] place of something
[40:27] he is the biker instead
[40:30] of the son of god
[40:33] and the bible said let him that has a
[40:36] gift of wisdom
[40:38] count the numbers of the beast
[40:42] for it's a number of a man and his
[40:46] number is 666.
[40:49] now you take bypass and draw
[40:52] a line or roman numbers or b for five
[40:54] nine for one
[40:55] and add it up and see if you haven't got
[40:58] 666
[41:00] the bible said he would be sitting in
[41:02] the temple of god worship like god
[41:04] when that little doctrine become
[41:09] a incarnate it become a biker
[41:13] instead of the son of god see oh my
[41:17] that awful deceiving spirit if you want
[41:20] to read that read the second
[41:21] thessalonians 2
[41:22] 3 and you can see where it's at and of
[41:24] course
[41:25] you remember satan is the head of
[41:29] all political power of every nation
[41:35] how many knows that you want to put it
[41:37] down
[41:38] matthew 4 8 satan took jesus up
[41:42] to high mountain and he showed him all
[41:45] the kingdoms of the world that ever was
[41:47] or ever would be amen
[41:49] in a moment of time amen talk about a
[41:52] person
[41:53] he said i'll give them to you
[41:57] if you worship me and jesus knew that he
[42:00] was going to fall air to him
[42:03] that's what they say were you a bunch of
[42:05] poor holy rollers
[42:07] well we get the world amen the meat
[42:10] shall inherit the earth
[42:11] that's what jesus said see see
[42:14] notice jesus noted fall heir to him so
[42:18] it said get thee in satan
[42:20] it's written right back with the
[42:21] scripture again you see i shall worship
[42:23] the lord and him only
[42:24] see now now when
[42:29] when he as his head demon
[42:33] incarnate in this super religious man
[42:36] as the bible predicts then he unites his
[42:40] church and state
[42:43] both of his own powers unite together
[42:49] see when the antichrist spirit went
[42:51] forth it was a spirit
[42:53] then it become one it become then i
[42:56] watched the seal
[42:59] when the spirit went for it it was
[43:01] antichrist
[43:02] against the teaching of christ all right
[43:05] the next thing
[43:05] did what christ set out for his church
[43:07] to do it was against saying i don't know
[43:09] it don't mean that
[43:10] it don't mean it that was for somebody
[43:12] else that that's back in it
[43:13] a hundred years ago back under that that
[43:15] ain't for us see that's the
[43:17] anti against then it become
[43:20] how the writer went out he didn't have a
[43:23] crown but he was given one
[43:25] that white horse he had a boat no arrows
[43:28] see
[43:28] so then when he went forth then after
[43:30] while he was given a crown
[43:31] because you can't put a crown on a
[43:33] spirit's head but when this spirit
[43:35] become
[43:36] incarnate the second work of his of his
[43:39] dispensation
[43:40] of his mystic the second work
[43:43] he become a crowned false prophet
[43:47] to the working of the antichrist spirit
[43:52] now we see him now now
[43:56] he becomes that when he takes that then
[43:59] he uh is already satan controls
[44:03] the political powers of the world
[44:07] now he gets into a place that is going
[44:09] to make a universal
[44:10] church power taking religious power
[44:15] and do you not understand my brothers
[44:19] that in when this nation appears
[44:22] in the 13th chapter of revelations
[44:25] this little animal raised up like a lamb
[44:29] and it's got two horns civil
[44:32] and ecclesiastical power but he done the
[44:36] same thing the beast did before him
[44:38] [Applause]
[44:41] it's strange america is number 13
[44:46] and a woman estranged it appears even in
[44:48] the 13th chapter of revelation
[44:51] we start out with 13 stripes on the flag
[44:53] 13 stars
[44:54] everything's 13 13 13 13 all the way
[44:57] down and everything's woman woman
[44:58] all the way down and finally end up i
[45:01] predicted
[45:02] a woman will control her remember that's
[45:05] 30 years ago i said it
[45:07] and and the the seven things that i
[45:09] predicted five of them's done come to
[45:11] pass
[45:11] and they got the man right there now to
[45:13] bring her in
[45:14] and you voted into your politics uh
[45:20] all right so much to say you can't
[45:22] hardly get
[45:23] to where you want to get to notice now i
[45:25] won't keep you a little bit longer if i
[45:26] have to
[45:27] we'll carry over tomorrow night look
[45:29] notice when
[45:30] satan uh everybody that realizes that
[45:34] satan controls all political powers of
[45:38] the world
[45:39] he said so matthew the fourth chapter
[45:42] you get an eighth verse all the kingdoms
[45:45] belong to
[45:46] him amen that's reason they fight war
[45:48] kill
[45:49] i remember isn't that strange they was
[45:51] given this sword
[45:53] to kill one another
[45:58] notice now now when he did that he did
[46:02] not have the ecclesiastical power yet
[46:06] but he started him with a demon of a
[46:09] false
[46:10] teaching and that teaching become a
[46:13] doctrine
[46:14] that doctrine become incarnate in a
[46:16] false prophet
[46:18] and then he went just to the right place
[46:22] he never went to israel now he went to
[46:25] rome
[46:25] now i see a room the council was held
[46:29] and they elected a head bishop
[46:32] amen amen and then by doing this
[46:36] they united church and stayed together
[46:40] then he dropped his bowl
[46:44] he got off his white horse he got on his
[46:47] red horse
[46:49] or he can kill anybody that don't agree
[46:51] with him
[46:53] there's your seal yeah
[46:59] watch him right on into eternity honor
[47:00] with it see
[47:02] unites both his powers together
[47:05] the same thing they're trying to do
[47:07] right now
[47:09] same thing today and
[47:12] a strange thing maybe you don't
[47:13] understand it but the day
[47:15] from a baptist group in louisville you
[47:17] heard it on the radio
[47:18] a speaker raised up and you haven't
[47:21] heard it
[47:22] see all right here you are they want and
[47:24] asked in the church now
[47:26] that we don't really have to um or just
[47:28] kind of jar in the catholic church
[47:30] but we have to kind of fellowship with
[47:31] them get it and the same time they're
[47:33] going on in louisville
[47:35] over here god's unfolding the seals to
[47:38] his people are sure
[47:39] don't do it
[47:41] [Applause]
[47:45] see it both working together
[47:46] [Applause]
[47:48] remember the crow and dove set on the
[47:50] same
[47:55] just remember now
[47:58] we find out he unites his power then
[48:01] when he become both
[48:02] state and church ecclesiastical
[48:07] then what are you going to do he farms
[48:09] his own religion
[48:13] and now he can do whatever he wants to
[48:15] that he has the right to putt to death
[48:18] whosoever will not agree with him
[48:21] that's exactly what he did too amen
[48:24] and he did that just exactly and what he
[48:28] he did it to the true saints of the
[48:31] living god who kept the word and
[48:33] wouldn't agree with him on his documents
[48:35] he put him to death
[48:36] amen now brother lee daniel
[48:39] and your teacher sure of the nausea age
[48:43] of the early church
[48:44] i don't know what you read this or not
[48:46] if you want to read it
[48:48] you get in smokers glorious refre
[48:50] reformation
[48:52] and you find it that when saint
[48:55] augustine of hippo
[48:58] become a priest under the roman church
[49:02] had the opportunity to one time the holy
[49:05] spirit tried to come on
[49:08] and he rejected it how many knows that
[49:12] as a teacher so he rejected the holy
[49:15] spirit that's
[49:16] exactly what the type of the protestant
[49:18] church today
[49:20] that's rejected the holy ghost he went
[49:23] back down to hippo and he was the very
[49:25] one that signed that
[49:27] paper that had the revelation from god
[49:30] that it was
[49:31] all right and pleasing god to put every
[49:34] person to death that didn't believe with
[49:36] the roman catholic church
[49:38] now listen i'm quoting from the
[49:40] martyrology
[49:42] from the thymus of saint augustine of
[49:45] hippo
[49:46] until 15 and 86 on the
[49:50] roman mortarology the roman catholic
[49:53] church put
[49:55] 68 million protestants today
[49:59] [Music]
[50:01] was his sword red would you ride a red
[50:03] horse
[50:05] what was it the same power
[50:09] the same rider amen there's a seal
[50:17] they admit 68 million on the mortarology
[50:22] besides all those put to death outside
[50:24] of that
[50:25] oh mercy during the dark ages there were
[50:29] millions fed the lions and slaughtering
[50:32] that way
[50:33] because they wouldn't bow down to that
[50:35] catholic dogma
[50:37] you know that
[51:01] if we go to revelations chapter six
[51:03] there's the so in revelations four and
[51:05] five the lamb takes the book which is
[51:06] the title deed of redemption
[51:08] and he opens the book and he looses the
[51:10] seals and
[51:11] and so as the seals
[51:15] the move of the antichrist down through
[51:17] the ages and it all
[51:18] combinates in this age and so
[51:22] brother brown was talking about the
[51:23] white horse rider which is the
[51:25] uh antichrist spirit writing fourth in
[51:27] the form of a
[51:29] um you know a doctrine as an antichrist
[51:31] writing as john would say in the
[51:33] epistles he said the antichrist spirit
[51:34] has come already and it's working among
[51:36] the people
[51:37] um so we read here in in revelation six
[51:40] and one i just sort of just recapped
[51:41] this just to
[51:42] just to consolidate what we've heard and
[51:44] what we've heard a month ago
[51:45] uh two i just like to welcome all the
[51:47] visitors here tonight this is not a
[51:48] regular wednesday service for us no we
[51:50] have preaching and
[51:51] but once a month we're going through the
[51:52] seals because this book of revelation it
[51:54] reveals what the devil's doing
[51:56] it also reveals what jesus christ is
[51:58] doing in this day
[51:59] so it's a very powerful book we know
[52:01] it's a symbolic book it's but it's a
[52:03] book of prophecy it's a book of history
[52:05] that's why when we're hearing you can
[52:06] see from history how
[52:08] uh it has been proven that there is on
[52:10] the martyrology of
[52:11] of of the roman catholic church so in 68
[52:13] million people put to death because they
[52:15] didn't agree with the church and
[52:17] and that is history i have read in other
[52:18] sources of saint augustine of hippo
[52:20] rejecting the holy ghost and then he
[52:22] signed that into basically catholic law
[52:24] it was able to kill people who didn't
[52:25] agree with the
[52:26] doctrine of the church so so it's an
[52:28] overlay of history as well so
[52:29] so revelation 6 and 1 and when i saw the
[52:32] lamb open one of the seals and i heard
[52:34] as it were the noise of thunder
[52:35] and one of the beasts saying come and
[52:37] see and i saw and behold a white horse
[52:39] and him that sat
[52:40] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[52:42] crown was given unto him and he went
[52:43] forth conquering and to conquer so
[52:46] we know that this this uh first horse
[52:48] rider is not christ
[52:50] because if you take this um symbolism
[52:52] here the symbolism revelations 19
[52:54] it's it's two different writers this is
[52:56] an antichrist
[52:58] spirit writing forth and we know you
[53:00] can't crown a spirit you've got a crown
[53:01] of man so when that teaching
[53:03] you know when that doctrine we went from
[53:04] the deeds of the nicolaitans and we know
[53:06] that
[53:07] the word nicolaitan means to conquer the
[53:09] people how do you conquer the people
[53:10] by giving them a false teaching that
[53:12] takes the holy ghost anointing
[53:14] from them that's how you conquer them
[53:15] let's say conquer people in a religious
[53:17] way
[53:18] as you cut off the holy ghost working in
[53:20] their life
[53:21] and so so it was a deed in the first
[53:24] church age then it finally became
[53:25] adoption and became
[53:27] uh you know an official church and so so
[53:30] this is the
[53:30] anointing on the uh of the antichrist in
[53:33] the first
[53:34] first ages here so so it's a deception
[53:37] writing forth
[53:38] had a bow no arrows it's nothing but a
[53:40] bluff and as i said you can't crown a
[53:42] spirit you can only crown a person so
[53:44] when that teaching became embodied in a
[53:46] man
[53:46] it was crowned and then and it went
[53:48] forth conquering and to conquer and this
[53:50] is not christ if you read revelations 19
[53:53] and then after the spirit was crowned at
[53:55] the council of nicaea
[53:56] then the church had the state backing to
[53:58] use phys
[53:59] to use physical force to basically
[54:01] destroy
[54:02] any any contrary christian belief
[54:05] and um and so this is why it went from a
[54:08] white horse rider the same antichrist
[54:09] spirit now on a
[54:10] red horse because as we know our horses
[54:12] of power in the scripture
[54:14] and when he had opened the second seal
[54:16] which is what we heard today
[54:17] i heard the second beast say come and
[54:19] see and they went out another horse that
[54:21] was red and power was given unto him
[54:24] that sat there on to take peace from the
[54:25] earth that they should kill one another
[54:27] and there was given unto him
[54:29] a great sword you know i was thinking as
[54:31] i was listening to this uh tonight you
[54:32] know many people blame religion for
[54:34] the wars in the you know in history and
[54:37] to an extent that's true
[54:39] you take from the dark ages or the
[54:41] crusades or different things they are
[54:42] wars of religion
[54:44] so it was this antichrist spirit riding
[54:46] forth taking peace from the earth
[54:48] in the name of jesus christ in the name
[54:50] of christianity
[54:52] and um so it's an antichrist spirit
[54:54] writing forth and then you know maybe
[54:55] i guess a few months down the track
[54:57] because we're going to take a portion of
[54:58] these messages once
[54:59] one wednesday a month we'll come down to
[55:01] the fourth
[55:03] horse rider whose name is death and it's
[55:04] a mixture of all the other anointings
[55:06] mixed into one and that is writing in
[55:08] this end time
[55:09] today it's what the it's what the devil
[55:11] is doing but what i love about the seals
[55:13] is
[55:14] is there's an anointing god always sends
[55:16] the anointing of the holy ghost to
[55:17] combat whatever the devil's doing
[55:19] so just as just as when that white horse
[55:21] rider went forth
[55:23] the anointing that went forth was the
[55:25] anointing of a lion anointing we need to
[55:27] combat
[55:28] what the antichrist was doing by the
[55:29] word going forth in power
[55:31] and then and then when the antichrist
[55:33] changed his tactic to to now he could
[55:35] physically kill the believers
[55:36] then and then it was a it was a ox
[55:38] anointing of the holy ghost came on so
[55:40] the people
[55:41] were actually anointed like an oxy as
[55:44] an animal of sacrifice actually anointed
[55:46] to give their lives and that's why if
[55:48] you read like fox's book of martyrs
[55:50] different ones
[55:50] they they were actually anointed to go
[55:53] through that persecution so they
[55:55] gladly gave their lives to be terribly
[55:58] you know it's
[55:59] it's incredible how how demon powers
[56:01] anoint men
[56:02] to invent new ways to kill people you
[56:05] read fox's book of matters different
[56:06] things like that
[56:07] it's incredible the ways they thought of
[56:08] inventing how to kill people but the
[56:10] believer was anointed by the holy ghost
[56:12] to overcome that
[56:13] not to bow not to recant but they went
[56:15] through and they gave their lives gladly
[56:17] like a beast of sacrifice so you know
[56:20] it's the same thing in this day
[56:22] we're under a prophetic eagle anointing
[56:24] the lord lifts us up above what we see
[56:26] with our five senses
[56:27] we see from the beginning to the end and
[56:29] we can see what the devil's doing we can
[56:31] see what christ is doing
[56:32] and we can see our position in god's
[56:34] great program
[56:35] so it's actually a glorious it may have
[56:37] been a bit of a heavy service
[56:38] you know what he's talking about but
[56:39] it's actually a very important thing
[56:41] because
[56:42] as we read there and you read when you
[56:43] read the fourth seal all the
[56:45] powers of the first three combine in the
[56:47] last one because the pale is a mix so
[56:49] it's the mix of the white the black and
[56:51] the red
[56:52] and um so these things still ride on
[56:55] today
[56:56] amen so um we're going to have a time of
[56:59] prayer now
[57:01] but you know remember the lord the lord
[57:03] is always greater than what the devil's
[57:05] doing
[57:05] great is he that's in you that he that's
[57:07] in the world amen so it doesn't matter
[57:09] how dark this world gets
[57:10] amen the light of god shines ever
[57:12] brighter
[57:13] and remember remember he that you know
[57:15] our lord jesus overcame hell death in
[57:17] the grave
[57:18] then he comes and lives in you by the
[57:20] baptism the holy ghost and he
[57:21] is the overcomer in your life just like
[57:23] he is the christian and
[57:24] you're in you that's the only way we can
[57:26] live a christian life is when he comes
[57:28] in and beats a christian through you
[57:30] otherwise it's human effort and that's a
[57:32] total miserable failure
[57:34] i mean no matter how good the intentions
[57:35] they may be so i'm so glad that we can
[57:37] just give our lives say lord just come
[57:39] live through
[57:40] me have your way not my will but thy
[57:42] will be done
[57:43] manifest your word through me lord do
[57:45] what you want to do be the christian in
[57:46] me lord

[57:51] few
