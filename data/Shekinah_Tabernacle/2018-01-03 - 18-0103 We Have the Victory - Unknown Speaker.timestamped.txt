[26:36] though really I mean he's in this house
[26:39] hallelujah I mean let's just go to
[26:42] Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 I know
[26:48] this is a familiar scripture to all of
[26:52] us
[26:58] and we're gonna go to revelations
[27:00] chapter 12 or so she's here now let's
[27:03] all read this together Jesus Christ the
[27:07] same yesterday and today and forever one
[27:11] more time Jesus Christ the same
[27:13] yesterday and today and forever amen so
[27:18] he is the same yesterday today and
[27:21] forever let's go to Revelation chapter
[27:23] 12 and some of my favorite scriptures
[27:31] revelations 12 and 7 and it's season
[27:35] there was war in heaven and Michael and
[27:37] his angels fought against the Dragon and
[27:39] the dragon fought and his angels and
[27:42] prevailed not a lot that word not
[27:44] neither was their place found any more
[27:46] in heaven
[27:47] I'm glad that and the Great Dragon was
[27:49] cast out that old serpent called the
[27:51] devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[27:53] whole world he was cast out into the
[27:55] earth and his angels were cast out with
[27:57] him and I heard a loud voice saying in
[27:59] heaven now is come salvation and
[28:01] strength and the and the kingdom of our
[28:04] God and the power was Christ for the
[28:06] accuser of our brethren is cast down
[28:07] which accused us them before our God day
[28:10] and night and they overcame him by the
[28:13] blood of the Lamb this is where we step
[28:15] into the picture and they overcame him
[28:17] by the blood of lamb and the word of
[28:18] their testimony and they loved not their
[28:20] lives until the death rejoice therefore
[28:23] rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in
[28:25] them were to the inhabitants of the
[28:27] earth and to the sea for the devil has
[28:29] come down unto you having great wrath
[28:31] because he knoweth he hath but a short
[28:33] time a men made Lord blesses word you
[28:36] may have your seats this night I just
[28:38] want to talk about victory tonight I
[28:41] mean I believe we have a victorious walk
[28:43] amen we are more than conquerors amen
[28:46] and I just really I just want to I just
[28:50] want to talk about you know we have we
[28:52] we have a picture here in Revelation
[28:56] chapter 12 but but as I'm as I'm going
[28:58] through the service just keep in your
[29:00] heart over in Hebrews he's the same
[29:02] yesterday today and forever he doesn't
[29:05] change maybe how he how he manifests
[29:08] himself or his physical form a change
[29:10] he's the same one he's the same God that
[29:13] was that was in the garden as the same
[29:15] God that was with Noah the same God that
[29:17] was all the way down through the Old
[29:18] Testament into the New Testament and
[29:21] we're still living in Bible days he's
[29:23] the same God today
[29:24] Alleluia so now there's something about
[29:26] you know God he always fails himself and
[29:29] we understand in the beginning you know
[29:31] he failed himself in a pillar of fire
[29:32] and he took on different forms but
[29:34] ultimately he was wanting to dwell in
[29:36] the soul of man he wanted to dwell
[29:38] behind human skin I mean he wanted to
[29:41] not just dwell he didn't want to dwell
[29:43] necessarily in a temple made by hands
[29:46] though he did dwell in a temple made by
[29:48] hands for a time but that was not his
[29:50] final resting place his final resting
[29:52] places the souls of men and woman
[29:55] hallelujah boys and girls that's his
[29:57] final resting place now what he wants to
[30:00] do now this is basically my whole sermon
[30:02] in a bottle as as brother Armando and
[30:04] police say he was defeated in heaven God
[30:09] he was defeated Satan was defeated in
[30:11] heaven and now he was cast down to the
[30:14] earth and God as I'd say it this isn't
[30:17] just my words God chased him down to the
[30:19] earth hallelujah and now he was defeated
[30:22] in heaven and now he's being defeated
[30:24] upon the earth and the same one that
[30:26] defeated him in heaven is defeating him
[30:28] upon the earth hallelujah he may be
[30:30] fighting in a different format he's the
[30:32] same yesterday today and forever and we
[30:37] have to have confidence now that when
[30:39] God has spoken his word it will come to
[30:41] pass Satan may try and hinder he may in
[30:44] stop you know he fights you he tries to
[30:46] hinder your walk he does everything he
[30:48] can but if you are part of the bride of
[30:50] Jesus Christ and he should say he's
[30:52] talking about me just now I mean nothing
[30:54] will stop you manifesting the promised
[30:57] word for your day and we know ultimately
[30:59] that promise word is is going to be a
[31:00] change in these bodies hallelujah we're
[31:03] going to go from this dimension to the
[31:04] next dimension and I trust you what
[31:06] you'll say when you step that first you
[31:09] know second in heaven you'll say it was
[31:11] worth it
[31:12] hallelujah every battle every burden
[31:15] every trouble every hardship every care
[31:18] that you cry out of desperation or pain
[31:21] or whatever it may be
[31:23] it will be worth it all
[31:24] I'm in that first second heaven
[31:26] hallelujah we'll be there
[31:28] amen it'll be worth it trust me it'll be
[31:31] worth it
[31:31] I'd rather have you know the worst day
[31:34] being a Christian I'd rather have that
[31:36] every day than the best day with the
[31:38] devil or a lifetime with the devil
[31:41] that's wonderful hallelujah amen so now
[31:44] God we understand if we go - we gotta
[31:48] flip Ian's chapter - sorry yeah chapter
[31:52] 2 Paul is speaking about let's go to
[31:59] let's go to verse 5 now God has always
[32:02] failed we understand there and he says
[32:07] let this mind be in you which was also
[32:08] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[32:11] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[32:14] with God but he made himself of no
[32:16] reputation and took upon him the form of
[32:19] a servant and was made in the likeness
[32:21] of men and being found in fashion as a
[32:24] man he humbled himself and became
[32:26] obedient unto death even the death of
[32:29] the cross
[32:29] now we know this word form in the Greek
[32:32] and and oh brother Georgia be able to
[32:34] pronounce it just right but and my and
[32:36] my butchered way of pronouncing it's a
[32:38] morphe and it's the form by which a
[32:41] personal thing strikes the vision the
[32:44] external appearance so he changed this
[32:45] form
[32:46] it was the same God that was in the Old
[32:48] Testament he was staying there before
[32:50] the scribes and Pharisees he said before
[32:51] Abraham was I am
[32:53] I'm it's the same one that spoke to
[32:55] Abraham was now speaking to them he just
[32:57] changed his form he became a man
[32:59] Alleluia so he changed his form selves
[33:02] the same God the same God all the way
[33:04] from before there was anything is the
[33:06] same God that was present among us I
[33:08] trust he's not just with you but he's in
[33:10] you so the very creator of heavens and
[33:12] earth is in the believer I mean - the
[33:14] same one that said let there be Sun Moon
[33:16] and stars you know they talk about a Big
[33:18] Bang I don't know how the Big Bang
[33:19] happened but here we are and God made it
[33:22] and God created it and this is so the
[33:24] same one that created all things
[33:26] I trust us in you Alleluia so he just
[33:29] changed his form now he defeated Satan
[33:31] in heaven and cast him out upon the
[33:33] earth and now God through his children
[33:37] has been
[33:37] haunting Satan he's been haunting him
[33:40] he's been he's been a tormentor you know
[33:42] this may sound maybe I shouldn't say it
[33:45] this way but a devil means a tormentor
[33:47] so the children of God have been a devil
[33:51] - the devil I'm just going to know
[33:54] because many times we think he's on my
[33:56] case he's after me I'm being tormented
[33:59] by him we got it round the wrong way
[34:01] it's totally it's totally the other way
[34:03] around we were not here we are not sent
[34:06] to the earth to talk to be tormented by
[34:09] the devil you have been sent to torment
[34:11] him hallelujah because he was here in
[34:14] Eden and he was determined this is going
[34:16] to be my creation I'm going to be like
[34:18] the Most High I'm going to be worshipped
[34:20] like him you know this was his purpose
[34:22] but then God God is not going to let him
[34:25] be you know have the final say
[34:27] I mean God always has the final say
[34:29] hallelujah the devil never has the final
[34:33] say God has the final say when I reach
[34:35] to the end of the Bible it says Amen
[34:37] hallelujah is the finality it's all done
[34:40] and before you get to the Amen Satan and
[34:42] all of us Pete you're his servants and
[34:45] his angels were cast into a lake of fire
[34:47] hallelujah
[34:48] but I keep living past that part I mean
[34:51] I don't go to that place I continue on
[34:53] hallelujah so he comes to his end and
[34:56] now he knows we read he has great wrath
[34:59] because he knows he just has but a short
[35:01] time and a time comes to an end
[35:04] haloo he knowses you know he's got a
[35:06] countdown clock he sees his incoming so
[35:11] he's got great wrath and then here you
[35:13] come and you're born and soon shaped at
[35:16] iniquity come to the world speaking
[35:18] lives totally lost spiritual amnesia
[35:21] have no idea where you come from where
[35:23] you're going you know and that but God
[35:25] before the earth began said I'm going to
[35:28] I'm going to send them I'm going to send
[35:30] them as as the final voice to a final
[35:33] age and I'm going to express them upon
[35:35] the earth and in my season that I choose
[35:38] I'll reveal myself to them and they will
[35:40] know me not just as their father but as
[35:43] their husband hallelujah is their
[35:45] comforter as their provider as their
[35:47] bridegroom
[35:48] I mean as they're all at all as their
[35:50] provider as their healer is their
[35:52] Redeemer
[35:53] hallelujah and then and you could say
[35:55] well yeah that's happened to me hey man

[38:22] Benna than just a natural law with a
[38:24] natural land
[38:26] Amen do we know we have a far greater
[38:28] thing you say well you know it's not how
[38:32] you feel my new year's resolution as I
[38:36] want to go beyond walking by how I feel
[38:39] we're not called to walk by feelings we
[38:42] walk by faith and faith is not feelings
[38:45] faith may bring feelings right if you
[38:48] really love someone you feel love if
[38:50] you're really happy you're happy if
[38:52] you're full of joy you've got joy it's
[38:54] not just words either words coming out
[38:56] of your mouth but the devil can take
[38:58] your feelings and beat you and beat you
[39:00] and beat you and you thought you're
[39:02] going to oh yeah yeah I thought you were
[39:04] more than a conqueror I thought you're
[39:06] overcoming why do you feel so down and
[39:08] depressed or whatever more and he just
[39:10] beats you we got to go beyond the
[39:11] feelings it see in Hebrews 11 it was by
[39:14] faith it wasn't by feelings it was by
[39:17] faith hey man Jesus said you know he
[39:21] perceived that they believed brother
[39:22] Brahim said do you believe you didn't
[39:24] say did you do you feel it do you
[39:27] believe it do you believe the promise in
[39:29] spite of what you feel and in spite of
[39:32] what you see in spite of what you may
[39:34] remember amen do you believe it and
[39:37] that's where it all hinges on do you
[39:38] really believe it and there's got to be
[39:41] something on you that says in spite of
[39:42] how I feel about it
[39:43] I believe it it's true God's proving it
[39:47] over and over and over and over and over
[39:49] again
[39:49] Alleluia his word is true if he said the
[39:53] word - now saying that the world is
[39:54] going to be destroyed and now I received
[39:57] that word and he built an ark saved this
[40:00] household all the animals they moved to
[40:02] know they're carried over to a new land
[40:04] that same word came to that same God
[40:07] spoke to Abraham and Abraham fulfilled
[40:10] his part of the word amen
[40:12] in the word came to Moses who evermore
[40:15] and then now God
[40:17] was veiled in Moses he says I have come
[40:19] down Exodus 3 I have come down I've
[40:21] heard the cries of my people I've come
[40:24] down to deliver them he hears your cries
[40:25] you got to make the scripture very
[40:27] personal he hears your cries he hears
[40:30] the burden the things you may carry he
[40:33] hears them he's mindful of them I mean
[40:36] though the answer may Terrier we'll come
[40:38] amen you just got to understand Lord you
[40:41] know everything why did why did the
[40:43] Prophet why did God use the use the
[40:45] Ministry of Elijah and the stay to tell
[40:46] people their address and where they're
[40:49] from and and and what they are wearing
[40:51] when things were yo things are happening
[40:53] in all these big details that's because
[40:55] God wanted you to know I know everything
[40:57] about you you may think no one knows but
[41:00] I know everything about you I'm mindful
[41:02] of everything you go through you're my
[41:04] child my eyes upon you hallelujah he
[41:07] knows everything about us and so now God
[41:09] came down he says I've heard the cry of
[41:11] my people and he says I'm sending you
[41:14] I've come down to deliver them and I'm
[41:17] sending you so God took a man and then
[41:21] he took this man that's a two year old
[41:23] man with a shepherd staff and he went
[41:27] into Egypt and it was God and and Moses
[41:30] and the devil was in Pharaoh and so now
[41:34] the same ones that are in heaven and now
[41:37] upon the earth it's just the mask has
[41:39] changed you see and so now in heaven the
[41:42] devil was defeated now what's going to
[41:44] happen on earth if Jesus Christ is the
[41:47] same yesterday today and forever he was
[41:49] victorious there it is victorious there
[41:52] now he's going to be victorious here
[41:53] it's easy to go through the Old
[41:55] Testament but I'm going to bring it to
[41:56] our day but if he was victorious and now
[41:59] his his Moses let my people go they were
[42:02] God's people they weren't Moses his
[42:03] people
[42:04] that was God speaking first person
[42:07] through a man just like David saying and
[42:08] the sons my God my God was Alpha se caen
[42:11] me and he's looking right at Calvary and
[42:13] if you are sitting there in his palace
[42:15] and he's crying out those things you'd
[42:16] say why are you saying my God my God was
[42:19] hell for sake of me has he not
[42:20] established your throat has he not put
[42:22] you on the throne yeah has he looked
[42:24] after you but he was God uh speaking
[42:26] first person through me
[42:27] and so now here comes here comes Moses
[42:30] let my people go
[42:31] Satan says I'll not let your people go
[42:34] and then you skip a few a few chapters
[42:36] ahead and death strikes you know
[42:39] Pharaoh's kingdom and what happens there
[42:41] let go
[42:43] amen and you read even even before the
[42:45] plagues really begin to fall God
[42:47] actually tells Moses and Aaron death is
[42:50] going to strike this leg the firstborn
[42:53] will be killed he tells them before you
[42:55] go read it and so and so now here's the
[42:58] pattern and now here comes Moses comes
[43:01] the end of his ministry remember he's
[43:02] the same he's the mighty Conqueror
[43:04] he's the mighty Conqueror he's conquered
[43:07] everything that can be conquered
[43:08] hallelujah and now here he comes Moses
[43:11] goes off the scene and then Joshua comes
[43:13] into his position and the same God as I
[43:15] was with Moses so shall I be with thee
[43:18] hallelujah and they said now here comes
[43:20] Joshua and he goes into the Promised
[43:23] Land they come to Jericho what happens
[43:25] to Jericho at Falls what happens to AI
[43:28] at Falls
[43:29] what happens to here in the other city
[43:31] they come again at fault I mean because
[43:33] God said you're going to have this land
[43:34] and they possessed most of it in those
[43:37] days holy because he's the same
[43:39] yesterday today and forever I really
[43:42] want this to sink in because we're going
[43:43] to realize he doesn't change if he was
[43:46] an overcomer there and his children
[43:48] he'll be an overcomer here and his
[43:49] children hallelujah if he conquered the
[43:52] devil there he'll conquer the devil here
[43:55] amen we have to have that confidence
[43:57] this is the God we serve he's in control
[43:59] I mean we're going to receive our
[44:02] promise how part of the scripture how
[44:04] will and testament that he's laid down
[44:07] he's going to make sure because he
[44:09] didn't just die but he rose again Paul
[44:11] speaks about it in Hebrews he says down
[44:14] the you know hey this is my language you
[44:16] go read it but he says about how
[44:17] normally the testator has to die the one
[44:20] who late gives the will has to die and
[44:22] then someone else gives it but now if
[44:25] Jesus died he gave it inheritance but
[44:28] then he resurrected turn to ensure now
[44:30] what he what he laid in his will for you
[44:32] you receive it hallelujah there's what
[44:36] this open book is about that's what this
[44:37] word is about I mean that you would
[44:39] receive everything
[44:41] that God has for you amen
[44:44] oh well where is that I want to I want
[44:46] to have it he'll ensure you get it if
[44:51] you're surrendered to him who wants to
[44:53] go all the way I want to go all the way
[44:56] Alleluia and they said Joshua he said no
[45:00] man will stand before thee Alleluia and
[45:03] he and he tells the Sun and the moon to
[45:05] stand still a different you know things
[45:06] happen because here was God now in a man
[45:09] overcoming and you can go even through
[45:12] the book of Judges all the judges that
[45:14] raise up God is now manifesting himself
[45:16] through those judges and their
[45:19] deliverance to Israel and then you go
[45:22] into the Kings the same thing happens
[45:24] with the godly kings they saw the devil
[45:26] and it's God facing off
[45:29] it's the contest brother branham
[45:30] preaches a sermon called the contest
[45:32] between God and Satan and this contest
[45:34] is going on but who wins the contest you
[45:38] know brother Graham said about the token
[45:40] having the literal life of God God in
[45:42] you it actually makes you feel so
[45:44] relaxed and that doesn't mean you watch
[45:47] the world go by and what happens what
[45:48] happens but now you're in your resting
[45:50] place you're in your hiding place amen
[45:54] letting off the pressure I mean this is
[45:56] a pressurized age but he tells us that
[45:59] there is a place where we can let off
[46:00] the pressure and that place isn't just
[46:03] these four walls I mean this is just a
[46:05] natural building but the place we're
[46:07] really going to lay off the pressure is
[46:08] in him Amy because the name of the Lord
[46:11] is a strong tower the righteous run into
[46:14] enter safe Alleluia and to those who's
[46:17] in the tower whose and him gotta realize
[46:21] either where's this place I can lead off
[46:23] the pressure I don't have to go to a
[46:24] City of Refuge I'm in my city of refuge
[46:27] I'm always in my city I get up in the
[46:29] morning I'm in my city now the City of
[46:31] Refuge is Jesus Christ you'd be like
[46:33] what are you talking about it's Jesus
[46:34] Christ is our City of Refuge
[46:36] I don't go to have to go to here Brodeur
[46:38] different cities in Israel I'm in my
[46:40] city and I go to work and I'm in my city
[46:42] hallelujah and we went out to all when I
[46:44] was in my city wind and Tara's in my
[46:46] city I'm back in wearing that I'm still
[46:48] in my suit
[46:49] hallelujah amen a says once you're in
[46:52] there you can lid off the pressure
[46:54] hallelujah we have to remember where we
[46:56] live
[46:57] amen where do you live I'm not talking
[46:59] about your house I talk about your
[47:01] spiritual where you really live
[47:03] hallelujah we can just let the pressure
[47:05] off amen we're going to remember where
[47:08] are you you're not oh if you're really
[47:11] you're if you are did in your life is
[47:12] hidden Christ with God then you are
[47:15] really hidden away in him you're in that
[47:18] City of Refuge
[47:19] hallelujah you got to remember where you
[47:21] live amen
[47:24] we're in a City of Refuge now we come
[47:27] all the way down through God was with
[47:30] Elijah who won the prophets of Baal or
[47:32] Elijah who won Jezebel or Elijah Elisha
[47:35] won just go through the whole Bibles to
[47:38] contest bring God and Satan who
[47:40] ultimately wins Satan does not win he's
[47:43] on the losing side
[47:44] he can't change sides we can change
[47:47] sides I mean we were born on Satan's
[47:50] side but by new birth hallelujah we go
[47:52] on the Lord's side that's the side we're
[47:54] meant to be on hallelujah amen now God
[48:00] doesn't just wanna I'm maybe jumping a
[48:03] hit but he doesn't just want to have
[48:05] this victory because he's a family man
[48:07] God is a family man and he's a husband
[48:10] and both those categories they love to
[48:12] share their lives with their family well
[48:15] they're your family family mentor
[48:18] husband spouse but this year there have
[48:19] experiences and and do things together
[48:22] build the relationship that's what he
[48:24] likes to do so when he wins the victory
[48:26] he doesn't just want to keep it to
[48:28] himself as I'm going to share this
[48:30] victory with my children hallelujah that
[48:34] as I overcame so they will overcome Amen
[48:37] that's why he that's why David David
[48:40] could write the Psalms and you know he
[48:43] could rejoice that the Lord is my rock
[48:45] and my refuge though I walk through the
[48:48] valley of the shadow of death amen thou
[48:50] art with me he could write these things
[48:52] because he had the experience and
[48:54] because God your God uses trials it's
[48:57] waiting to show himself in the trial he
[49:00] wanted the hardship and be going through
[49:02] hardship
[49:03] you say look you've allowed this to
[49:05] happen you've ordered my steps now Here
[49:08] I am in this place you're wanting to
[49:10] show a part of yourself to me in this
[49:12] and I what caused me to see it you have
[49:18] to be looking it's like going to a
[49:19] museum with the tour guide or not a tour
[49:21] guide you can maybe Google about the
[49:24] museum and the artwork and you can get a
[49:26] little bit out of it or you can go with
[49:27] the tour guide who knows all things
[49:29] that's in the museum and he can show you
[49:32] every or she can show you every part of
[49:33] the art and if every detail and you go
[49:36] out that museum saying Wow and you get
[49:38] the magnitude of everything in that
[49:41] place or you can just go and blindly oh
[49:43] let's go here today and just staggering
[49:45] staggering stagger out and you wouldn't
[49:49] get the full magnitude of what's going
[49:51] on you know that way as opposed to with
[49:54] the guide now we go through I'm not
[49:59] calling our life a museum but we go
[50:03] through life and different things happen
[50:04] who's been to a museum there's different
[50:06] different rooms and different art and
[50:08] different artists on so we go into this
[50:10] trial now he's your guide because all
[50:13] the trials that we are faced with
[50:15] everyone in the world has the same trust
[50:18] there's nothing that we are tempted you
[50:20] know it's nothing that we are tempted
[50:23] with it's all common to meet the same
[50:26] trials we have they have but the
[50:28] difference is now we have a guide and
[50:30] he's one to reveal himself through the
[50:32] trial you know he's like thee he's like
[50:35] the one in the museum who knows all
[50:36] about every different room and wants to
[50:38] explain it and show part of himself
[50:41] that's why trials are a blessing because
[50:43] God wants to reveal part of himself and
[50:45] that trial T are you going to be looking
[50:47] for him to do it now Jesus came to the
[50:52] earth John the Baptist and came Jesus
[50:55] God became flesh and dwelt among us he's
[50:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[50:59] nothing stopped him the unbelief of the
[51:03] people didn't stop him
[51:04] being misunderstood didn't stop him
[51:06] nothing stopped him from fulfilling his
[51:09] part of the scripture and he conquered
[51:11] hell death and the grave and now here
[51:14] comes
[51:14] so here he comes and then he ascends and
[51:18] then he says to the disciples wait in
[51:20] Jerusalem tarry in Jerusalem until I
[51:23] seen the promise of the father you'll be
[51:25] endued with power from on high
[51:27] and so here was a group of people now
[51:30] and their humanity they believed and
[51:32] they said will even die for you and all
[51:35] kinds of things but when pressure came
[51:37] on like Peter he denied the Lord the
[51:40] contest came will your faith hold in the
[51:43] and the pressure and his his faith
[51:46] because it was just human faith buckled
[51:49] amen
[51:50] even though he is a true believer he was
[51:52] sincere you know but he began to come
[51:56] under the strain of the trial ain't you
[51:59] a disciple no I don't even know who
[52:01] you're talking about but you're a
[52:02] Galilean you speak like no I don't know
[52:04] this Jesus didn't I see you in the
[52:05] garden no I don't know you know there's
[52:08] a trial because about identification
[52:10] identification in the trial and because
[52:13] now he didn't have the overcomer in him
[52:17] he failed in the trial but now he comes
[52:21] the day of Pentecost and the same one
[52:24] who was full of good know of the word
[52:28] bodily God here bodily there's now in
[52:31] 120 people and the same Sanhedrin now
[52:34] that that condemned Jesus to die has
[52:37] brought these disciples in front of them
[52:38] and they don't buckle under the pressure
[52:41] they said should we please God or surely
[52:44] please men now the devil thought he had
[52:48] Jesus there on the cross but then he
[52:51] come to find out the devil had him and
[52:53] the one that the devil tried to stop
[52:56] coming all the way from the garden the
[52:58] seed of the woman had come and
[53:00] manifested himself and did what he
[53:02] promised he would do hallelujah and here
[53:06] he was and now he thought he had him
[53:08] here but now the time had come where God
[53:12] had the devil and his thing was ripped
[53:15] out of him and he doesn't have the keys
[53:17] to his own house and he doesn't have the
[53:19] keys to his own house till he can't
[53:21] dictate when he goes in or out it's very
[53:24] frustrating when you lose your keys
[53:26] but the thing is when you know and but
[53:29] the key he has you can't duplicate it
[53:32] and he didn't duplicate it before he got
[53:34] them and the one who owns all things
[53:36] yanked it off the side and he can't get
[53:39] them back that'd be very frustrating
[53:41] amen but but he begins to understand now
[53:44] oh the prophecy of Isaiah where I'll be
[53:48] like the Most High but I'll be cast down
[53:50] to the pit this is an emotion you get
[53:54] worried have you have been in a real
[53:56] stressful time where it's out of your
[53:59] control and you don't know which you
[54:02] know it's going to go a certain way and
[54:03] you can't stop it going that way this is
[54:06] times up by a few billions and that's
[54:08] the devil today you think you get
[54:12] stretched he's stressed I'm not trying
[54:15] to sympathize for him in a second but I
[54:18] want you understand he stretched and all
[54:20] these Devils that listen to his lie and
[54:22] fell with them
[54:23] their stress - oh but Lucifer I thought
[54:26] this thing was going to work it's not
[54:30] working because you're here you're you
[54:34] are a torment and a Vicks a Shinto Satan
[54:36] and all of hell just like no way you say
[54:39] oh well I'm just with just a little
[54:41] group I'm only me you know Noah was a
[54:44] vexatious it at all meet just one man
[54:48] this world's going to be flooded get in
[54:51] the Ark and then his family believed
[54:53] eight souls were and even says that the
[54:55] and Hebrews 11 don't have it right here
[54:58] in my notes but says that his life
[55:00] basically condemned the world they
[55:03] condemn the devil and his work and so
[55:06] now the devil is a very stressed person
[55:09] he has a hard day every day
[55:12] he has a hard day every day I want you
[55:15] to think about this because we think we
[55:17] have bad days and here we are where he
[55:20] says in Ephesians I have caused you to
[55:22] sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[55:24] he has caused you to go above this world
[55:26] where you're once a slave and walking
[55:29] according to the spirit of the Prince of
[55:31] the power of the air amen but God rich
[55:33] in mercy came your way open your eyes
[55:36] you woke up in the chicken yard a made
[55:39] any real
[55:40] and you heard and you heard mama eagle
[55:42] flying over the barnyard and something
[55:45] and you said that's me I came out of
[55:48] this one this big powerful Amen predator
[55:51] hallelujah
[55:52] amen I may we may be sheep but brother
[55:57] brems said about an eagle and two little
[55:59] Eagle it's you know flies them down into
[56:01] the you know yo-yo onto the green
[56:03] pasture the eaglets get off they have a
[56:05] jubilee and and the mother flies up and
[56:07] keeps watch and he says you know if a
[56:09] coyote went after those went over those
[56:12] you're after those young ones that he'll
[56:14] come down and flog them to death
[56:16] hallelujah that's the same thing you
[56:18] know that the Devils got to be careful
[56:20] because when it comes against you he's
[56:21] got Jesus Christ on his head just like
[56:24] Esther Esther turn the wrath of the King
[56:27] against her enemy amen
[56:29] turn turn the Kings wrath against Haman
[56:31] I mean my life is in jeopardy in the
[56:34] life of my people and he gets angry who
[56:37] would come against my queen who would
[56:39] try and kill my beloved hallelujah and
[56:42] she just says it's him amen and the ones
[56:45] he was pointing to was now dangling here
[56:47] not too long enough that was the
[56:48] dangling hanging on a gallows that he
[56:51] made for her people
[56:53] amen for for Mordecai and yeah this
[56:56] whole world is a gallows not for you
[56:59] this lady of sin world is not a gallows
[57:01] for you it's a gallows for Satan amen
[57:05] gods allowed this to happen it's just
[57:08] like here comes Israel out of out of
[57:10] Egypt and they and if you go read it God
[57:13] tells Moses go here go here and now
[57:16] you'll hear at the Red Sea they didn't
[57:18] just stumble then just got all this run
[57:21] and runner and then here we are know God
[57:23] allow them to walk down to this place it
[57:26] was a death trap but not for the people
[57:29] of Israel this world is not a death trap
[57:31] for you it's not a death trap for you go
[57:35] read the scripture it wasn't it that God
[57:36] did not lead them there to be massacred
[57:39] by the ones that he just delivered them
[57:40] from he allowed them to come there as
[57:43] bait he allowed to come here as bait
[57:46] have you ever thought about this here's
[57:47] my bait hallelujah and then now they're
[57:50] there and they're panicking and even
[57:52] Moses gets where everybody prophets
[57:54] he says you see these Egyptians from
[57:57] henceforth you won't see them again
[57:58] forever he doesn't even know what's
[58:00] going to happen but he says don't worry
[58:02] about this and then now here we are well
[58:06] you know the end of the story what
[58:07] happens to the Red Sea parts over Israel
[58:10] goes to another land and then the enemy
[58:12] tries to follow and they drown and God
[58:16] closes the Red Sea wasn't much you know
[58:18] God uses Moses closer it seemed it was
[58:20] God's doing and then here we are the
[58:22] bottomless pit has come open amen
[58:25] revelations 9 is in fulfillment I mean
[58:28] that hundred thousand thousand demons
[58:29] have been released and they turned that
[58:32] they used man to try to annihilate the
[58:34] Jews in the Second World War in
[58:36] different things but those same spirits
[58:37] are here still upon the earth now why
[58:40] they here upon the earth because the
[58:42] devil knows if he can just wipe out the
[58:44] believers that there's no one that can
[58:46] contest you know you're enter into a you
[58:50] know there's no one actually upon the
[58:51] earth you can say this is mine you are
[58:55] living representation of Adams fallen
[58:58] race that's been redeemed and this earth
[59:00] belongs to you so here you are you get
[59:02] up in the morning you may not even own a
[59:04] single square meter of this earth
[59:06] according to this world with housing and
[59:09] whatever but it all belongs to you this
[59:12] whole world belongs to you Allu you the
[59:15] whole world belongs to you and the
[59:17] fullness thereof so that's just not the
[59:19] topsoil that's every part of it
[59:22] hallelujah it all belongs to you and sin
[59:25] anyway here we are and the God has
[59:29] allowed the devil to come out with all
[59:30] of his angels upon the earth because he
[59:35] thinks he can try and wipe you out but
[59:37] in reality it's actually you just bait
[59:41] but you're just bait is this okay yeah
[59:46] think about no no think about this we
[59:48] are on the winning side one of the
[59:50] favorite quotes from brother Bram I have
[59:52] is you cannot lose being a Christian you
[59:55] just can't lose being a Christian
[59:57] Alleluia
[59:58] and so now here we are all of hellas
[1:00:00] upon the earth all of heavens come down
[1:00:02] as well and heaven came down amen to
[1:00:05] take you with it back
[1:00:07] into heaven hallelujah that's why we're
[1:00:10] here that's why he's descending with a
[1:00:12] shout because he wants to he wants to
[1:00:14] join himself with the people my beloved
[1:00:17] I'll carry you away hallelujah and as he
[1:00:20] sits like Romeo and Juliet hallelujah
[1:00:22] amen glory to God I'm glad it's that way
[1:00:25] it's a love affair amen he's not gonna
[1:00:28] leave any members bright upon the earth
[1:00:30] win is the Great Tribulation but the
[1:00:32] devil will be trapped here and all and
[1:00:34] everything else will be trapped here
[1:00:35] we'll be having a wedding supper
[1:00:37] hallelujah and vials of Wrath will be
[1:00:40] poured out upon the earth and we'll be
[1:00:42] having a jubilee amen
[1:00:45] you think Miriam and her tambourine and
[1:00:47] all of Israel on the that's going to be
[1:00:49] nothing they're gonna have to sit down
[1:00:51] and I'll show you a dance I'm not going
[1:00:53] to try right now a million hallelujah
[1:00:55] amen hey you took about of deliverance
[1:00:58] hallelujah we had a deliverance hey man
[1:01:01] it was just from a natural ant or
[1:01:03] natural land it was from from the earth
[1:01:05] up into here hallelujah amen
[1:01:09] I think we should just have a shouting
[1:01:10] year don't you think doesn't matter what
[1:01:13] comes what goes the Word of God and
[1:01:16] jewels forever amen and he conquered he
[1:01:19] conquered in the disciples they didn't
[1:01:22] bow to the Sanhedrin or should we listen
[1:01:25] to you or listen to God there's a pretty
[1:01:27] flat answer I think but I think we need
[1:01:29] a bit of it should we listen to you
[1:01:30] or listen to God hmm you know you tell
[1:01:36] us anyway they beat them they did
[1:01:38] whatever they didn't they didn't hold on
[1:01:41] to that fear the devil tries to hand you
[1:01:43] a lot of things
[1:01:43] he's a very good delivery boy he does he
[1:01:47] tries to and it can be either through
[1:01:49] sickness or through a Vincent life try
[1:01:52] and put something in you to try and
[1:01:54] break your victory friends will not be
[1:01:57] bowed you've got to look you gotta look
[1:01:59] at that thing and say I will not be bad
[1:02:01] I will not you know it's like Shadrach
[1:02:04] Meshach and Abednego if he delivers us
[1:02:06] hallelujah
[1:02:07] if he doesn't hallelujah will not bow
[1:02:10] and I think we need a bit of that amen
[1:02:13] if we're victorious or if we overcome if
[1:02:16] he heals me hallelujah if he doesn't
[1:02:18] heal me hallelujah
[1:02:20] not bow I'll go in the furnace
[1:02:23] hallelujah
[1:02:24] maybe that furnace actually did them a
[1:02:25] favor they were bound but when they came
[1:02:28] out well actually it was more than just
[1:02:30] loosening of bands God came down I mean
[1:02:34] that was the best fire anyone ever been
[1:02:35] in hallelujah because they had a meeting
[1:02:38] amen the God that talking about said I'm
[1:02:40] going to join my children in this trial
[1:02:42] I'm going to join them in this fire
[1:02:44] hallelujah and the fire just loose their
[1:02:47] bands because when they walked out they
[1:02:49] couldn't even smell smoke on them and
[1:02:50] there and the band's there the world
[1:02:52] tied them up in those bands the devil
[1:02:54] tries to tie you up and a lot of things
[1:02:56] amen
[1:02:58] but he throws you into the trial you say
[1:03:00] glory these are going holy these are
[1:03:03] going and what happens then they go and
[1:03:06] your fellowship with your God that you
[1:03:08] love and the mess of that furnace and
[1:03:10] you walk out
[1:03:11] Alleluia I'm glad it's that way so now
[1:03:16] they so the devil I believe was in the
[1:03:19] Sanhedrin and he locked eyes because the
[1:03:23] same eyes kind of eyes he looked in
[1:03:25] Hebron had now become flesh and Jesus
[1:03:28] and he was looking at that he recognized
[1:03:30] a few be the son of God because he
[1:03:32] wasn't sure but he thought he was if
[1:03:34] they'll be and then he looked into the
[1:03:37] eyes of the disciples after Pentecost
[1:03:39] and he saw no doubt something I've seen
[1:03:42] this look before the eye color may be
[1:03:45] different the stature may be different
[1:03:46] but God has known by his characteristics
[1:03:49] one of his characteristics is he's he's
[1:03:51] victorious Amen if you allow him to be
[1:03:55] just yield yourself and he'll give you
[1:03:57] the victory so he looked and he said
[1:04:01] I've seen these eyes before and he was
[1:04:03] defeated and now here we come down 2,000
[1:04:06] years and God has become flesh again
[1:04:10] hallelujah the same Holy Ghost the other
[1:04:12] day of Pentecost is now in his people
[1:04:15] once again amen that he's not locked out
[1:04:17] by the by by the doors of creeds and
[1:04:19] dogmas of man that's been annihilated
[1:04:21] and now God is fully in his people once
[1:04:24] again hallelujah and then the devil
[1:04:26] looks at you
[1:04:27] hey cease I've seen this look before you
[1:04:31] look at as wrong I may be jumping around
[1:04:33] but you look at
[1:04:34] Israel they come around Jericho they
[1:04:37] don't know what they're thinking about
[1:04:39] and Rahab tells the spies all of our
[1:04:45] hearts of the men everyone's heart is
[1:04:47] melted all our morale is gone we know
[1:04:51] we're gonna lose this is basically what
[1:04:53] they say because of you because of you
[1:04:57] because of what God did for you because
[1:05:00] of you Gideon is there around the camp
[1:05:03] of the people of the east and the
[1:05:05] Midianites and everything and they go
[1:05:08] sneak into camp and they hear what
[1:05:11] they're talking about and one soldier
[1:05:14] says here that I had a dream and this
[1:05:17] thing rolled down into the camp and
[1:05:18] busted up or whatever happens go read it
[1:05:20] and then and then they basically saying
[1:05:23] yes Gideon's gonna come and he's gonna
[1:05:25] wipe us out this is the devil's
[1:05:28] testimony
[1:05:29] you understand me this is the devil's
[1:05:31] testimony just like the ones on the
[1:05:33] walls of Jericho you know to the natural
[1:05:35] eye they look how big this Spezza and
[1:05:37] their helmets and look how big the gates
[1:05:39] are and their walls and everything there
[1:05:41] are big walls but in the heart of every
[1:05:44] soldier on that place they were scared
[1:05:47] they were done they knew their goose was
[1:05:50] cooked they knew it I want you this is
[1:05:55] and this is how the devil sees you
[1:05:56] because and and why are they feeling
[1:05:58] that way they weren't feeling that way
[1:06:00] before they found out that Israel was
[1:06:02] coming their way
[1:06:02] then they find out you mean those ones
[1:06:05] and their God and now they're here they
[1:06:08] start to get worried that's how the
[1:06:10] devil the devil trembles at you the life
[1:06:13] that's in you he's not afraid of you as
[1:06:15] a person but the very God that's in you
[1:06:17] he trembles at their because that same
[1:06:20] God that same God that kicked them out
[1:06:21] of heaven the same God that defeated him
[1:06:24] in the Old Testament and in the New
[1:06:25] Testament or whistlin you just but you
[1:06:28] know what I mean he's the same God here
[1:06:30] amen
[1:06:32] you got to look because what does the
[1:06:34] the Bible doesn't just reveal you it
[1:06:38] reveals Satan the message brother it
[1:06:41] says the seals opening it just strips
[1:06:42] all the layers off Satan shows him what
[1:06:44] he really is
[1:06:44] I meant and then now if you
[1:06:48] take that and you look into the
[1:06:49] scripture you actually see this devil
[1:06:51] when brother Graham said you're nothing
[1:06:53] but a bluff he was nothing but a bluff
[1:06:56] and he called Satan's hand and he said
[1:07:00] you had defeated that day on Calvary the
[1:07:02] angel the Lord is here the people are
[1:07:04] believing I'm believing you have to go
[1:07:07] and what happened he had to go
[1:07:09] hallelujah
[1:07:10] and this and Satan when he looked into
[1:07:12] the eyes their property recognized I've
[1:07:14] seen these eyes before I've seen this
[1:07:16] one that's when I thought I destroyed
[1:07:18] this but here he is how Louisan flesh
[1:07:22] amen and now just like the wave sheaf
[1:07:25] offering in Leviticus 23 the mature
[1:07:27] Pilar field was cut down I'm going to
[1:07:29] close with this maybe it was it was cut
[1:07:31] down and waved in front of the and
[1:07:34] you're in front of God by the priests
[1:07:35] and they are saying thank you Lord the
[1:07:37] rest of the field will come forth like
[1:07:39] this part of the field I mean Jesus was
[1:07:42] cut down over that Pentecost the life
[1:07:44] was waved hallelujah I mean because
[1:07:47] there were those in the field that had
[1:07:49] to come to the same maturity in life I
[1:07:51] mean when brother have preached it as
[1:07:53] the rising of the Sun I mean it wasn't
[1:07:55] just a nice Easter message it's a
[1:07:57] declaration it is the rising of the Sun
[1:08:00] the so8 has risen hallelujah
[1:08:03] and it's in the fullness of its strength
[1:08:05] in this day hallelujah and that was done
[1:08:08] that you would know that that ministry
[1:08:11] was demonstrated that you would know
[1:08:12] this is this is what I this is God
[1:08:15] saying this is what I do with the
[1:08:16] redeemed son who had a timber that could
[1:08:19] find a bus or wanted to kill people when
[1:08:22] he was young you all know the story
[1:08:24] don't you
[1:08:24] I mean he was born totally without God
[1:08:27] without anything but then God came and
[1:08:30] God took him and he gave his life and
[1:08:33] God filled him with His Holy Spirit
[1:08:34] transformed him amen didn't know no
[1:08:37] enemy could stand before he goes into
[1:08:39] India all the religions of India
[1:08:41] challenged they say this Jesus is
[1:08:43] nothing this gentleman come to the
[1:08:45] meeting tomorrow you'll see who's God
[1:08:47] hallelujah and he has the vision
[1:08:49] beforehand of praying for the blind man
[1:08:52] and he challenges them all if your God
[1:08:54] is really God you come and open his eyes
[1:08:56] they sit there like nothing and then he
[1:08:59] prays and the guy's eyes come open
[1:09:01] because he had a vision it was so this
[1:09:04] didn't happen thousands of years ago
[1:09:05] friends this happened in the 50s a man
[1:09:08] has been documented it really happened
[1:09:10] hallelujah and so God was showing this
[1:09:14] is just a bunch of religion this is the
[1:09:16] true and living God this is me and
[1:09:18] nothing could stand before him all the
[1:09:20] days of his life now we can't just put
[1:09:23] it off on the prophet because the same
[1:09:25] life does learn him I trust us in you
[1:09:27] and that same manger Lord that was with
[1:09:29] him as with his bride hallelujah I mean
[1:09:32] so that means now I trust when the devil
[1:09:34] looks in your eyes he says I've seen
[1:09:36] this before I've seen this before I
[1:09:40] don't like it I'm going to try and
[1:09:42] destroy it
[1:09:42] you know why the devil comes on your
[1:09:44] case because he thinks if he could just
[1:09:47] beat you back down then that'll be it
[1:09:50] what do you think this you know you know
[1:09:52] you because everything goes peachy you
[1:09:54] become a believer in this like you've
[1:09:55] just hit the hit the gravel and you're
[1:09:57] going into the ditch you know what's
[1:10:00] happening
[1:10:00] it's because when God is proving his
[1:10:02] salvation but the devil is allowed to do
[1:10:05] it because he's trying to because you
[1:10:06] have now risen up and you say down with
[1:10:10] this down with this this table he will
[1:10:13] not be my ruler is the rebellion going

[1:10:35] to you and the spiritual amen

[1:10:41] has office throne he's under your feet
[1:10:44] hallelujah and you're in charge you're
[1:10:47] in charge amen Jesus was in charge every
[1:10:52] step of the way of this journey even
[1:10:54] even even when he went to Calvary as a
[1:10:57] man he was in charge he said no man
[1:11:00] takes my life I lay it down and if I lay
[1:11:03] it down a little I'll take it back up
[1:11:05] again amen
