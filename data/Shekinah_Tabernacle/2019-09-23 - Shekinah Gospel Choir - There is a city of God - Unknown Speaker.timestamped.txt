[31:28] my first time to minister and the church
[31:30] from Taranaki by the Elroy Robertson's
[31:33] church and I'm under expectation this
[31:38] morning once you think try the beam and
[31:41] sister sister Christine for the
[31:44] hospitality for the invitation to come
[31:47] we had a wonderful meal my brother Andy
[31:50] dominant me just appreciate it may never
[31:53] leave God further harnesses Talent then
[32:00] we find spiritually after that to the
[32:02] early hours of this morning
[32:04] and yeah I just see that things we were
[32:08] speaking about is where the Lord will
[32:10] have us go this morning and so without
[32:13] further ado let's think our Bibles to
[32:15] Matthew 6 you want to look at verses 913
[32:20] of Matthew 6 I know that you are a well
[32:24] taught church you are establishing the
[32:26] word so I don't have to lay too much
[32:29] groundwork we go straight in you bring
[32:32] the word now if you don't understand all
[32:34] get the recording if you fall asleep get
[32:36] the recording and listen to it again
[32:38] that you might fully understand what it
[32:41] is that God is trying to wanting to
[32:42] achieve in our lives in this hour amen
[32:46] Matthew 6 verse 9 to verse 13 jesus
[32:51] speaking after this manner therefore
[32:54] pray our Father which art in heaven
[33:00] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[33:04] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[33:08] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[33:11] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[33:14] our debtors and lead us not into
[33:17] temptation but deliver us from evil
[33:21] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[33:24] the glory forever amen Jesus giving the
[33:27] pattern of Prayer for every true
[33:30] believer who has the Holy Ghost
[33:32] let's pray one more time gracious father
[33:34] Lord I cannot stress enough the
[33:37] importance of this subject father the
[33:40] greatest weapon that you placed in the
[33:42] hands of your people was held to
[33:45] approach you and fellowship Oh God how
[33:47] to break through the veil of our own
[33:49] humanity and take position at every
[33:51] promise lays in the power of prayer
[33:53] father I pray Lord Jesus may you take
[33:56] the subject and so expound it to your
[33:58] people this morning Lord Jesus they
[34:01] would go forth
[34:03] with a more concentrated life do you see
[34:06] the word that's been preached then made
[34:08] reality in their lives Lord Jesus this
[34:12] is where we are add father it's not for
[34:14] a shortage of word it's a lack of
[34:16] consecration lord I pray Lord Jesus and
[34:19] not your word this morning keep us in
[34:21] the channel to pull on the word and meet
[34:24] each need I pray in your mighty name
[34:25] Amen god bless you all saints you may
[34:28] may take your seats
[34:35] praise the Lord
[34:37] Ray's gone like to speak this morning on
[34:42] prayerfulness and the depth of
[34:45] fellowship produces prayerfulness and
[34:48] the depth of fellowship that produces
[34:51] brother Ben
[34:52] nice to see you again yeah yeah may God
[34:57] bless you this morning amen the greatest
[35:04] thing God gave the church was prayer the
[35:10] greatest weapon God placed in your hands
[35:12] the thing that the people do not know
[35:14] how to harness correctly is the secret
[35:18] to you breaking through every entrance
[35:20] in your life
[35:22] Praful ness is the greatest weapon that
[35:24] God gave a man he gave a woman where he
[35:27] gave it child when you look at your life
[35:30] saints of God you will see that God has
[35:32] brought you through many things but you
[35:34] find that you've come to a place in your
[35:36] life often where there's no further
[35:38] progression or there is as wishful Ness
[35:41] of a day where you could have a Liberty
[35:44] a day where you could have possession of
[35:47] the promises that are preached meeting
[35:50] after meeting in the church but you
[35:53] never have possession of those things
[35:55] because the key laid and fellowship with
[35:59] God and that's the one thing we neglect
[36:03] the devil is not interested in the
[36:06] consistency of your church attendance
[36:08] nor is he interested in how many hours
[36:10] you read the scripture nor how many
[36:13] messages are the Prophet you listen to
[36:15] that means nothing to the devil he's
[36:17] fine with that but when a man goes to
[36:19] prayer that is the greatest threat to
[36:22] the devil amen
[36:25] it is not how much of the word you know
[36:28] it's who you know that will make the
[36:30] difference for every single one of us
[36:34] prayerfulness this morning I want to
[36:36] show you about prayer and fasting by the
[36:39] word how you harness those things to
[36:44] break through the veil of God to take
[36:46] you through the veil of self and realize
[36:51] your sovereign potential for what I'm
[36:53] called to is not what your call ting and
[36:55] vice versa you're all unique your own
[36:58] sovereign your lives are mapped out by
[37:02] God and this morning this is a key the
[37:04] devil don't want you to know that
[37:07] harness it this morning go first from
[37:09] this place - these things I speak these
[37:13] things from my own experience of my own
[37:15] life will you realize that no matter how
[37:17] much you love the things of God how much
[37:19] time you spin and the things of God you
[37:24] know if you are away from that
[37:26] fellowship that communion with God in
[37:29] their private place of that secret
[37:31] chamber if you're away from that you
[37:34] will only go so far with God the proper
[37:38] was asked 1964 questions and answers how
[37:41] can a Christian get deeper in the love
[37:43] of God and in one line he says read the
[37:47] word and pray read the Word of God and
[37:52] pray and then he says I'm going to hurry
[37:54] just get as many as I can talking about
[37:56] the questions all it takes to get deeper
[38:00] in the love of God to fall into love
[38:02] with Jesus Christ is to read his word
[38:05] and talk to him about his word and from
[38:08] there all these other things will be
[38:11] added amen
[38:14] this is not going to fall that God to
[38:16] pray for a wife to pray for a home to
[38:20] pay for a pray for a pay increase
[38:24] this is going before God to commune with
[38:27] them on the basis of his word and on
[38:29] that basis with index is the wife and
[38:33] the pay rise and the home and every
[38:37] other thing that is lacking and needed
[38:39] lays in that fellowship seek first the
[38:43] kingdom of God and all those other
[38:45] things are locked in the seeking of his
[38:47] kingdom amen my there are three things
[38:53] Jesus instructed us to do three things
[38:58] believe watch and pray believe watch and
[39:06] pray that's why this morning I'm not
[39:09] speaking about how well you know the
[39:10] word I'm talking about How well do you
[39:12] know him because if you know him he can
[39:16] reveal his word what is true revelation
[39:19] saints of God true revelation is
[39:23] relationship not a man who can sit down
[39:26] at the table and string together the
[39:30] mystery of the seven everything's with
[39:32] Scripture and quotation but still don't
[39:35] walk and overcoming life with Jesus
[39:38] Christ when a man knows his God who can
[39:41] take that word and make it effectual
[39:43] that is revelation until then it's still
[39:47] up here amen
[39:51] now in Matthew 6 Jesus is dealing with
[39:55] prayer and fasting and he's showing that
[39:59] both are connected in other words to
[40:05] have an effective prayer life fasting
[40:07] goes with it the two complement each
[40:10] other and the two are not optional these
[40:14] things are essential for the
[40:17] effectiveness of your walk in a flesh
[40:20] body because your flesh is not converted
[40:24] your flesh has a law of sin in it till
[40:29] the day the body is changed until then
[40:32] you will battle amen when you get the
[40:36] Holy Ghost
[40:37] troubles do not end there your troubles
[40:39] begin amen
[40:41] when did Israel learn about about Amalek
[40:44] when they came out of Egypt Amalek was a
[40:48] grandson of Esau who was brother to
[40:50] Jacob the closest relation you have is
[40:54] Emelec who is the flesh and you did not
[40:57] know about the flesh when you were in
[40:59] the world because you were gratifying
[41:01] the sensuality of the flesh everything
[41:04] that was there you did not know about
[41:05] its power till the word came your way
[41:08] and called you to a separation and your
[41:11] first battle is with Emily amen and God
[41:15] said from generation to generation I
[41:18] will have war with Amalek who is the
[41:22] flesh therefore if you want to be
[41:26] effective in the warfare you need to be
[41:28] in fellowship with God and when did
[41:30] Amalek come to an end in the time of the
[41:35] book of this thing because emilich from
[41:42] him came a gag and from a guy came
[41:46] Heymann Haman is the last amela
[41:49] recorded in the Bible
[41:51] and he was put to death by a woman when
[41:56] she came into a position as the Queen
[41:59] there was the execution of the humble
[42:03] last Amalekites the flesh was finally
[42:06] put into total subjection and until this
[42:11] body has changed you will have war with
[42:13] emilich amen amen so Lord make us
[42:18] effective in our warfare help us do you
[42:20] believe a lord I believe but help thou
[42:22] my unbelief Lord boost my faith you come
[42:25] this morning and you sit under the word
[42:27] you have your faith and a true faith is
[42:29] not given it's already there but it is
[42:32] increased as you sit under the word Amen
[42:36] believe watching pray Jesus showing that
[42:39] both these things prayer and fasting
[42:42] with secret things of God these were not
[42:45] public things any man this is not for me
[42:48] to come this morning and tell you about
[42:49] how often I
[42:50] how often I fast how much time I spend
[42:54] in the word these are private things
[42:55] between you and God but nobody to know
[42:58] all that they see is a life manifesting
[43:02] Jesus Christ but what they don't see is
[43:05] the consecration behind the seniors amen
[43:09] and how were the disciples watching the
[43:12] fullness of the word who had the fullest
[43:14] of the Holy Ghost in prayer all the time
[43:18] Jesus was not born in sin but had a body
[43:21] like unto sin in order to experience
[43:25] what you experience in a flesh body and
[43:27] if Jesus had the fullness of the word
[43:30] and had the fullness of the Spirit and
[43:32] had to pray how much more is it required
[43:35] of you who does not have the fullness of
[43:38] the word and has a state the the spirit
[43:41] by measure how much more is it required
[43:43] of you to pray how much more is it
[43:49] required of us who only have it by
[43:51] measure when you are sitting under the
[43:54] word you are receiving more of the Holy
[43:57] Ghost in x2 they were filled with the
[44:00] Holy Ghost but an X for they were
[44:01] refilled with the Holy Ghost
[44:03] when is the filling stopped the fullness
[44:06] of the Holy Ghost for your body is not
[44:08] the livers glorified till then there is
[44:11] more of the Holy Ghost to be heads amen
[44:16] the Prophet said some of only got enough
[44:18] spirit of god to stop them smoking
[44:20] enough to stop them drinking enough to
[44:23] get them out of bed push the accelerator
[44:24] and come to church that's all I've got
[44:27] but there's a more Holy Ghost in your
[44:30] hand to take what you receive in the
[44:32] church and make it effectual in the
[44:34] workplace effectual in the home of
[44:36] picture on the streets of Satan's Eden
[44:38] there's more spirit to be handed amen
[44:44] Lord make us a prayerful people
[44:47] amen until you have that friends you
[44:51] will only go so far in your walk you can
[44:55] come to every convention come to every
[44:56] altar call pour out peers on the ground
[44:59] but until there is that consecrated life
[45:01] behind the scenes between you and God
[45:03] you will keep coming up the front for
[45:05] the same thing yeah after year when I
[45:09] see it I see I watched it and we see it
[45:13] because there's a lack of teaching amen
[45:17] Jesus he is showing the location of
[45:21] Prayer the position of Prayer and he
[45:26] gives you the pattern of prayer right he
[45:29] shows you the place the position and how
[45:35] to pray now think about this there is a
[45:39] time when we play pray as a church there
[45:41] right yeah there's a time we pray as
[45:44] brothers there's a time we pray as a
[45:46] family but then what Jesus is talking
[45:49] about is private one-on-one prayer alone
[45:53] from all distraction where you can stay
[45:56] there if you wish for hours in the
[45:57] presence of God this is the prayer life
[46:00] that I'm talking about this morning I'm
[46:01] not talking about a brother's prayer
[46:03] meeting I'm not talking about praying as
[46:04] a church or a family I'm talking about
[46:07] private prayer one-on-one well you'd
[46:09] pour out all things to him that's what
[46:12] I'm talking about this morning amen
[46:14] and this is what I want you to extend
[46:17] its rod your tuning t it's powerful
[46:21] Jesus says you go into the closet to
[46:24] pray the closet is the bedchamber in
[46:27] other words the private place whether
[46:29] that's wherever you want to go like the
[46:32] Prophet went to that cave in Greensville
[46:33] Indiana and in prayer the angel came let
[46:37] me tell you if an angel is appeared in
[46:39] these last days he's appeared on an age
[46:42] level but he has yet to appear for some
[46:46] on an individual level and until you are
[46:50] there at your altar of incense you'll
[46:54] never meet the angel he must appear
[46:58] personally that is how the angel
[47:02] when you get alone with God he will draw
[47:05] near when you when we worship God this
[47:07] morning as a body of believers to do
[47:10] what was to bring the Holy Spirit down
[47:12] right to bring the angel down for the
[47:15] word to come forth this is why there's a
[47:19] responsibility of the song leader in the
[47:22] way that the songs are sung the songs
[47:26] are about the word that's unfolding in
[47:29] this age the musicians have
[47:30] responsibilities before the song leader
[47:32] steps up to create the atmosphere that
[47:34] will set the whole path of the service
[47:38] every office every position and the
[47:41] church must understand its calling but
[47:43] for lack of teaching people hindering
[47:48] the church because they're not
[47:50] understanding what they're calling
[47:52] encompasses Jesus showed go to a private
[47:58] place wherever there is in the bedroom
[48:02] and it came wherever you go to get alone
[48:04] with God go somewhere and then he shows
[48:07] you the position of Prayer who said that
[48:10] you had to be on your knees jesus said
[48:14] when you stand praying who said you had
[48:16] to be on your knees who says that you
[48:19] have to stand who said that who made
[48:25] these traditions on how you pray when
[48:29] they're not even in the word you can
[48:32] kneel and pray you can stand and pray
[48:34] they fed on your face and pray you can
[48:36] sit and pray you can drive and pray
[48:38] wherever you are walk and pray who said
[48:42] that it has to be this way who said you
[48:45] have to do this who said that the link
[48:58] we have to God is not subject to
[49:00] traditions of men mr. tobin our did not
[49:03] come to establish a firm tradition yeah
[49:05] take the great tradition and restore the
[49:07] way God appointed for things that's why
[49:12] we do not live under the law that's why
[49:14] the word gives you Liberty because it's
[49:16] breaking a formalistic 2,000 years of
[49:19] false teaching yeah because it's so
[49:23] engrained in the subconscious I must do
[49:25] things this way in this way and now
[49:27] serving God as a charm Oh stun to an
[49:31] enjoyable experience for many is coming
[49:34] to church and serving God what Paul
[49:37] hated my eye was showing us with the
[49:39] church the other day Paul hated that
[49:41] Jesus he knew because he was persecuting
[49:45] the church he had in his mind who Jesus
[49:47] was and he hated that Jesus so much he
[49:51] went to lock up the followers of this
[49:55] Jesus but what did Paul need he need to
[49:58] meet Jesus without the mask
[50:01] and who did he meet not a man wearing
[50:04] sandals in a road he met the pillar of
[50:07] fire Jesus without the mask and I tell
[50:12] you when he met the real Jesus without
[50:14] the mask now he has changed from a
[50:17] persecutor to the apostle and prophet of
[50:19] the age let me take this few young
[50:22] people this morning if you don't enjoy
[50:24] coming to church well or anything that
[50:26] relates to the things of God all you
[50:29] need is to meet Jesus without the mask
[50:31] you need to meet him outside of how you
[50:35] think of who he is because when you meet
[50:38] them in that form
[50:39] I tell you change you Lord Jesus be more
[50:48] to me than what these ones talk about
[50:51] what the denominations present a mess
[50:53] you must be real I must meet you I'm not
[50:56] satisfied with the testimony of what
[50:58] Paul hen or what the prophet head or
[51:00] what brother banal brother Andy or
[51:02] others at had but Lord I must meet you I
[51:05] must have my own experience
[51:08] amen watch this in Luke 3 Jesus was
[51:15] baptized all right he was not baptized
[51:17] for repentance he was baptized because
[51:19] as the sacrifice he had to be washed but
[51:22] when he went to the waters of baptism
[51:23] the Bible said they have an open and the
[51:26] Spirit of God descended in the form of a
[51:28] dove and when he was baptized the Bible
[51:30] says when heaven open he was praying
[51:33] Luke 3 verse 21 Jesus when he was
[51:36] praying the Holy Ghost came down then
[51:41] when he was adopted in Luke 9 when he
[51:46] was transfigured his adoption he was
[51:48] praying when that took place at his
[51:52] baptism when the fullness of the Holy
[51:55] Ghost came down he was praying at his
[51:59] adoption which is spiritual maturity he
[52:03] was praying now think of that when you
[52:07] receive the Holy Ghost that is the start
[52:09] of your spiritual journey that's why
[52:11] it's called the new birth you are a
[52:13] spiritual baby who makes a ton of
[52:15] mistakes babies do not get things right
[52:18] do they they are not mature children
[52:21] they're not mature they are babies they
[52:24] they say the wrong thing act up the
[52:26] wrong way but because they are born they
[52:29] have a life they are still a son less
[52:32] than a daughter so when you receive the
[52:34] Holy Ghost you'll not mature you're only
[52:36] a baby still rank in the things of the
[52:39] world you're on a journey to spiritual
[52:42] maturity amen
[52:44] that's why you need more of the Holy
[52:46] Ghost to bring you more and more into
[52:49] the image of your heavenly Father
[52:51] and therefore if Jesus at the time of
[52:54] baptism when he received the Holy Ghost
[52:56] in its fullness that's the paradox of
[52:58] the Godhead he was born by the Holy
[53:00] Ghost beget he's filled with the Holy
[53:01] Ghost and his baptism that's why it was
[53:04] a great mystery for the H if he who had
[53:09] the spirit without measure prayed at the
[53:10] time of baptism how much more will it
[53:13] take prayer from the time you receive
[53:15] the Holy Ghost to your adoption
[53:17] all the way from the rebirth to full
[53:20] maturity must be a strong fellowship
[53:22] with God all the way all the way and
[53:26] Jesus also his ministry did nothing
[53:29] except what the father showed him and
[53:32] how did the father show him all things
[53:34] because there was a communion a link
[53:37] established in order for the father to
[53:39] reveal his will to the son and now why
[53:45] often can't we find the will of God for
[53:47] our lives to know what to do what to
[53:49] speak when to step back when to rebuke
[53:54] when to encourage why are these things
[53:56] lacking because that communion is not
[53:58] there for the father to show you when to
[54:00] go about this your growth from spiritual
[54:09] infancy to spiritual maturity is all
[54:11] based on prayer fellowship with God
[54:13] prayerfulness I tell you you see people
[54:17] that will take drugs to try and settle
[54:18] their nerves all kinds of medicines with
[54:21] you see people smoking cigarettes to
[54:24] remove the shakes there is a nothing
[54:26] that will settle you like prayer
[54:27] wellness when you get beyond the
[54:30] tiredness and thinking about the fishing
[54:32] trip and all the distractions that
[54:34] surround you and you pray through that
[54:36] barrier to God comes down there's
[54:39] nothing that will settle you like that
[54:41] if you've been in that place I tell you
[54:43] there's nothing that can put you in an
[54:45] atmosphere like this Amen Jesus wasn't
[54:49] prayer and Luke 11 and Hera his
[54:52] disciples watching him pray and they are
[54:54] struck by how this man can access God
[54:58] and they say to him Lord teach us how to
[55:01] pray but all those disciples were
[55:04] already praying people because all
[55:07] through the Old Testament that Torah
[55:09] that they knew so well it was read to
[55:11] them it's filled with the prayers of the
[55:13] Saints now here they are seeing a man
[55:16] praying like no man prayed and they say
[55:19] Lord teach us because when you pray you
[55:23] access the father every time you are a
[55:25] man when you walk the word is on display
[55:28] the word is effective
[55:30] we don't have what you have teach us
[55:32] help you communicate so we can have the
[55:35] life that you do have oh my
[55:39] so Jesus sing that teaches them how to
[55:42] pray why am i am i all that Jesus
[55:51] accomplished was by fellowship with the
[55:53] father now watch what the prophets in
[55:55] realized the Prophet was God to the aged
[55:57] Moses was God to the people and brother
[56:01] Branham though he was a prophet he was a
[56:02] son of man he was God to the aged
[56:05] because God was in their vessel but the
[56:07] Prophet is off the scene but the word
[56:09] never left the earth and the word is
[56:11] Jesus Christ and the word is now in a
[56:14] body of believers therefore where is God
[56:19] that's heresy to those not trained in
[56:22] the word but you are God to the age
[56:25] and the people stumble at it because of
[56:28] the humanity parts but the soul pad
[56:33] flesh pad and the spirit part backslides
[56:37] and disappoints Bailey
[56:39] but the soul part is completely
[56:41] glorified the song part is where God is
[56:44] yes that's what stumbles of people how
[56:48] can there be God in this vessel who
[56:50] sometimes explodes and says the wrong
[56:52] thing it does the wrong thing how can
[56:57] God be in that by God is in that and
[56:59] when your eyes are in tune by the word
[57:02] you see God in there when you look at
[57:04] your brothers and your sisters you see
[57:05] God in them you go beyond that surface
[57:08] of 80 cents worth of New Zealand dust
[57:11] South African dust wherever you're from
[57:13] African dust and you look and you see
[57:16] the soul paths when God is looking at
[57:18] you this morning he's looking at your
[57:20] soul that's why he says you're perfect
[57:23] now when we look at one another we want
[57:26] to start looking beyond the skin and
[57:28] look into the soul and we can look and
[57:30] say my bro is perfect my sisters sure
[57:33] they have these other things but I have
[57:35] things too
[57:36] amen praise the Lord and the Prophet
[57:39] said in fellowship with God through
[57:41] reconciliation 1956 in this meeting I
[57:44] have thought of doing this many people
[57:46] has watched my life in the healing
[57:48] campaign how that the things would take
[57:50] place and the prophetic gifts and so
[57:52] forth
[57:52] I would just like to tell you how that's
[57:54] done my this is there was no man with a
[57:59] supernatural ministry anka prophet and
[58:01] people were watching that I wanted to
[58:02] know how it's done and he said I'll tell
[58:04] you how it's done
[58:05] BET's done through fellowship with Jesus
[58:08] Christ no other way no other plan no
[58:12] trick to it just simply praying
[58:14] fellowship taking God at His Word
[58:18] what he said was truth believing it that
[58:21] just settles it then
[58:22] talk to him love him and thank him for
[58:25] it and that does it why do you have a
[58:29] powerless unfulfilled life because
[58:33] you're not in that fellowship with Jesus
[58:35] Christ like where you should be that's
[58:38] why you get out of bed in the morning
[58:40] you drag your feet to work and you can't
[58:42] stand for him witness about them
[58:44] minister to the needs pray for the sick
[58:47] live a full life of Jesus Christ because
[58:50] there's a lack of fellowship that don't
[58:52] quicken your faith to walk into those
[58:55] things that is why you live way below
[58:58] God ordained privileges
[59:01] amen amen and you just get sick of just
[59:06] coming to church or just going to
[59:09] conventions of just sitting with
[59:12] believers and talking about the things
[59:13] of God don't you want to go further than
[59:15] that
[59:15] haven't you got more land than that well
[59:19] Lord raised my faith let me tell you
[59:22] friends if you were having to settle
[59:23] your racing heartbeat and wipe off the
[59:26] beads of sweat on your face before you
[59:28] can do something for God you're not
[59:30] there yet because when Jesus moved he
[59:33] was come yeah many knew his position go
[59:35] and speak you in him speaks but God
[59:37] brings you their place just go and do
[59:39] the word you're not ashamed it's
[59:42] something you're shy it's you're ashamed
[59:43] it's subconscious fear the greatest
[59:46] curse
[59:47] was fear the greatest enemy was yourself
[59:50] the greatest battle is the mind the
[59:52] three great things are all in this flesh
[59:54] body and need to be dealt to through
[59:57] fellowship with Jesus Christ Jesus gave
[1:00:01] the pattern of Prayer and the pattern of
[1:00:03] prayer is for those who have the Holy
[1:00:05] Ghost only those who are born again not
[1:00:08] for people in the denominational world
[1:00:10] the only people who can pray correctly
[1:00:13] of those who have the Holy Ghost
[1:00:15] now watch the pattern that Jesus gave
[1:00:17] and you will see why you need the Holy
[1:00:20] Ghost why you need our Father oh this is
[1:00:27] how we pray you know how we pray is not
[1:00:29] our Father who art in heaven hallowed be
[1:00:30] then that's the pattern yeah that's the
[1:00:34] pets a blueprint on how you pray that's
[1:00:37] not how you pray right this is how you
[1:00:40] pray our Father you acknowledge his
[1:00:44] Godhead but how can you acknowledge his
[1:00:48] Godhead except you have a prophet to
[1:00:50] reveal the mystery of God first if
[1:00:55] there's no prophet whose message was to
[1:00:58] reveal the mystery of God how can you
[1:01:00] say our Father and if you see that he is
[1:01:04] your father you must see that you are a
[1:01:06] son because he cannot be a father unless
[1:01:09] you are a son right the Prophet said he
[1:01:15] says there's no eternal son before they
[1:01:18] cannot be an eternal father because he's
[1:01:20] not a father to the other son about it I
[1:01:26] know you're thinking on their one ask me
[1:01:30] afterwards our Father you must
[1:01:33] acknowledge his Godhead you must see who
[1:01:39] he is that's why you need a prophet the
[1:01:44] mystery of God came by a prophet then
[1:01:47] you see who you are sons and daughters
[1:01:50] when we start talking about when you
[1:01:52] know who he is then you know who you are
[1:01:54] we talk about we want we know who we are
[1:01:56] but do you know who God is because
[1:01:59] unless you know God is you don't know
[1:02:00] who you are but when you know who God is
[1:02:02] you know you are a son amen
[1:02:05] our Father you acknowledge his greatness
[1:02:08] his awesomeness you don't rip into
[1:02:12] prayer with all your list of demands
[1:02:15] that shallow top it's a man who don't
[1:02:17] know how to approach his father Udo
[1:02:20] before the Lord in that private prayer
[1:02:22] and you start thanking him praising him
[1:02:25] worshiping him our Father give Him glory
[1:02:29] for all that he's done he wants to hear
[1:02:33] that then he will come down hallelujah
[1:02:38] that's how you pray which art in heaven
[1:02:41] all you need to know not just who he is
[1:02:44] but where is he at he's in heaven where
[1:02:48] is heaven I said that Bros in Pakistan I
[1:02:51] said brother zekiel lives in Pakistan
[1:02:54] where is Pakistan if I gave you a blank
[1:02:56] map of the world where no borders that
[1:02:58] define on the map point to me where
[1:03:00] Pakistan is an and for the average
[1:03:02] European differently for other races
[1:03:06] they will not be able to find where
[1:03:09] Pakistan is you see we know that God is
[1:03:13] in heaven nominations no he's in heaven
[1:03:16] problem is they don't know where heaven
[1:03:17] is the prophesied heaven consists of the
[1:03:23] word yeah heaven consists of the word
[1:03:26] therefore the whereabouts of God is in
[1:03:30] his word heaven is a faith civilization
[1:03:34] and faith is the revelation of the word
[1:03:37] that makes an economy function so
[1:03:41] therefore God our Father is in his word
[1:03:45] and is approached on the basis of his
[1:03:49] word his approach on the basis of his
[1:03:54] word therefore you need to be taught the
[1:03:58] word to know how to approach this God
[1:04:00] this father that you have
[1:04:03] when they discredit the profits and
[1:04:07] everything that he said this man who had
[1:04:10] the keys to unlock the whole Bible when
[1:04:11] you throw that away
[1:04:12] how can you access God how can you know
[1:04:16] how to approach him how can he responded
[1:04:18] cannot because you must pray on the
[1:04:20] basis of the word that's revealed yeah
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:24] he says hallowed be thy name this is a
[1:04:28] God who is a holy God a God of sanctity
[1:04:31] a God of standards a God of morals
[1:04:35] a God of righteousness that's the God
[1:04:38] that we serve and his sons and daughters
[1:04:42] are bearers of his name you are bearers
[1:04:46] of his name when Jesus said when God
[1:04:50] said when he gave those Commandments
[1:04:52] those Ten Commandments one of them was
[1:04:54] thou shalt not take the name of the LORD
[1:04:56] thy God and there the taking of it the
[1:04:58] name of the Lord in vain is not when you
[1:04:59] curse because this is given away before
[1:05:02] any of Vettes this is when you claim to
[1:05:05] be something but you're not you are
[1:05:10] bearing his name in vain and this is why
[1:05:14] the denominational world all claim that
[1:05:18] Christ is their husband that they say
[1:05:22] they are married to him but all the
[1:05:24] children they are producing don't look
[1:05:26] like him meaning they've been with

[1:09:49] therapists and some self-help book and
[1:09:59] forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[1:10:02] debtors prayer fellowship is based on
[1:10:06] forgiveness
[1:10:07] unless there's forgiveness you can't tap
[1:10:10] into God hallelujah
[1:10:13] my my my Jesus isn't mac-11 therefore I
[1:10:17] say unto you what things soever ye
[1:10:18] desire when you pray believe that you
[1:10:20] receive them in other words present
[1:10:22] tense believe it is finished you have
[1:10:24] them now
[1:10:25] ye shall future tense emblem you need
[1:10:29] healing believe you've got it right now
[1:10:30] and you'll get it hey man my my my
[1:10:35] and in Matthew 18 Jesus gave the parable
[1:10:38] of the great Lord who had a servant who
[1:10:42] owed a great debt of ten thousand
[1:10:44] talents and he called his servant and he
[1:10:48] says pay me what you owe
[1:10:49] ten thousand fellows and the man says I
[1:10:52] can't paint I don't have I don't have
[1:10:54] and the Lord said well guards lock him
[1:10:58] up sell his wife and children make them
[1:11:01] bond slaves
[1:11:02] till this man pays his debt and that
[1:11:06] servant fell at the feet of his Lord
[1:11:07] says Lord of mercy with me have patience
[1:11:10] with me I'll pay you and the Lord was so
[1:11:12] moved by that they're genuine plea of
[1:11:16] the servant he forgave him a great debt
[1:11:18] but that one who was forgiven a great
[1:11:21] debts had a fellow servant who owed him
[1:11:24] a hundred pence I repents and he
[1:11:27] approached his brother and he says pay
[1:11:29] me what you owe me
[1:11:30] yeah and he could not he said look I
[1:11:32] don't have a hundred pigs I got nothing
[1:11:34] I've paid the electricity and but
[1:11:36] feeling the calm and got the groceries
[1:11:38] were nothing left over nothing more it
[1:11:40] says well Roman in the prison yeah this
[1:11:45] man forgot what his Lord had just done
[1:11:47] for him
[1:11:49] forgave him a great debt he cannot
[1:11:51] forgive a brother from a minor debt and
[1:11:54] so this this 100 pence was given over to
[1:11:59] the tormentors was put in prison was
[1:12:01] locked up till he should pay and word
[1:12:03] got back to the Lord Himself of what had
[1:12:06] taken place and that servant was now
[1:12:09] called to stand before the Lord and give
[1:12:10] an account for what he had done and the
[1:12:12] Lord said I forgave you a great debts
[1:12:14] and you can't even forgive up your
[1:12:16] brother are minor debts and now I'm
[1:12:18] gonna turn you over to the tormentors
[1:12:20] who you should pay what you owe now
[1:12:22] think about that
[1:12:24] our Lord forgave us a great debt
[1:12:27] I send that you could not pay with your
[1:12:30] own blood amen and he himself paid your
[1:12:35] debt on Calvary 2,000 years ago and yet
[1:12:39] we look at our brothers and sisters who
[1:12:41] do minor things against us and for 15 20
[1:12:44] 25 years we still hold it against them
[1:12:47] to the stage and wonder why we cannot
[1:12:50] tap into the things of God because of
[1:12:52] unforgiveness fellowship with God is
[1:12:58] based and that's why you need to get
[1:13:02] before God and when you've finished all
[1:13:05] your talking wait before God and wait
[1:13:07] till he can come down and start showing
[1:13:10] you this brother this sister you need to
[1:13:14] go and see you need to make that right
[1:13:16] don't just tell me about it
[1:13:18] you need to go to them and if you can't
[1:13:22] do that you say Lord I know but I can't
[1:13:24] do it now Lord strengthen me yeah help
[1:13:28] me to humble myself to do this what is
[1:13:31] very awkward for me to make it right the
[1:13:33] expense of my reputation the expense of
[1:13:36] how I will be seen if I do it help me
[1:13:38] Lord that I might have a greater
[1:13:41] fellowship a deeper walk where these the
[1:13:46] supernatural can be seen in my life
[1:13:49] bring me to that place hallelujah praise
[1:13:53] alone in the Great Commission 1958 one
[1:13:57] of the great quotes of prophecies says
[1:13:59] the via found grace in your sight
[1:14:01] through God you take my word for this
[1:14:03] brethren if you want to be a blessing
[1:14:04] and get a blessing when a man has done
[1:14:06] you wrong and he is absolutely justly I
[1:14:09] mean he has done you wrong in other
[1:14:12] words he is really done you wrong and
[1:14:15] you know that he's done you wrong he's
[1:14:18] done you evil don't mention that oh I
[1:14:21] tell you we are designed by a nature
[1:14:22] where we can sit the three hours and
[1:14:24] talk about the folks of one another and
[1:14:26] my five minutes of talking about any
[1:14:28] good that's just boring it's an
[1:14:30] interesting that's not worth sharing
[1:14:31] with others but the bad my we can feed
[1:14:34] on it we love it we're good at it we are
[1:14:37] designed in a student body to do that
[1:14:40] and Harry says don't tell nobody about
[1:14:42] him because in this life when you
[1:14:44] receive the Holy Ghost it's the word man
[1:14:46] on the inside that is controlling you
[1:14:49] you're not controlled by flesh you have
[1:14:51] to be controlled by the word just tell
[1:14:53] no man don't mention that you take him
[1:14:56] to prayer before God now amen and don't
[1:14:58] take it in a way of just a selfish and
[1:15:00] say well I'm supposed to do this but
[1:15:03] stand with your shoulder to his short
[1:15:06] and stand in the presence of God our
[1:15:08] Father where prayer should be made in
[1:15:10] the presence of God say father here's my
[1:15:13] brother and he deserves punishment
[1:15:16] because he's done me evil and I don't
[1:15:18] see why he did it then let God go to
[1:15:21] talking to you and you'll see maybe what
[1:15:24] that man's been through the devil has
[1:15:28] twisted him up somewhere and caused him
[1:15:31] to do that though he's absolutely wrong
[1:15:34] before you leave the throne of God
[1:15:37] you'll be feeling sorry for that oh my
[1:15:41] you'll be sympathizing with that brother
[1:15:43] and when you get back down to where
[1:15:45] earth when you get back down to earth
[1:15:48] again you'll go over to that brother and
[1:15:50] shake his hand cuz you know what he's
[1:15:53] been through my you can't stand with a
[1:15:57] mortal in the presence of God and
[1:15:59] condemn anybody I don't believe in no
[1:16:02] sir even if he is a ranked sinner my how
[1:16:07] do we forgive our knees where ever
[1:16:10] before God for him to show you what
[1:16:13] they've been through that we can truly
[1:16:15] forgive amen that's why before we take
[1:16:20] the communion the bread and the wine
[1:16:21] that ordinance we were instructed to
[1:16:23] partake of first if any man assault
[1:16:26] against his brother let him make it
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:29] because it's communion fellowship why is
[1:16:33] there many who are sickly and weak and
[1:16:35] many sleep among you because of a lack
[1:16:38] of forgiveness
[1:16:41] why is sickness in the judge why is
[1:16:43] sickness in people's lives why is it
[1:16:46] things that stay there year after year
[1:16:47] why because of a lack of forgiveness
[1:16:51] people who cannot let go that's why
[1:16:55] people stay in these conditions that's
[1:16:58] why the church is often handed one man a
[1:17:00] cannon took some silver and a goal a
[1:17:04] golden wedge in Babylonian garments and
[1:17:07] all these things one man and the church
[1:17:08] sauce 36 men died one man brought about
[1:17:13] the death of 36 innocent men producing a
[1:17:16] whole bunch of families of widows
[1:17:17] because of one man's sin in the church
[1:17:19] and when they came back to the pasture
[1:17:22] when it came back to a Holy Ghost full
[1:17:23] man he realized there's sin in the camp
[1:17:25] when I'm looking at amongst a body of
[1:17:27] believers and I see we are stagnating we
[1:17:30] realize there's something in the camp
[1:17:33] that needs to be rooted out needs to be
[1:17:35] identified that a church can move on to
[1:17:38] greater victory when they went to AI
[1:17:41] they were to take the city with no
[1:17:43] deaths on their sign and Joshua as far
[1:17:48] as he was concerned was a great disgrace
[1:17:49] and utter defeat to the camp of Israel
[1:17:51] the 36 mentioned I was not this was not
[1:17:55] to be God has called you to victories at
[1:17:58] the expense of middle life a venire men
[1:18:01] churches a body walks on immunity takes
[1:18:04] position when we attended the
[1:18:13] forgiveness prayer takes you into the
[1:18:15] throne room of God in that place in that
[1:18:17] presence you can only forgive that's why
[1:18:19] I tell you when we're talking about
[1:18:20] private prayer not talking about praying
[1:18:22] as a family and all these things they
[1:18:23] have their place we're talking when you
[1:18:25] get alone with God yeah because that is
[1:18:27] the greatest form of Prayer just you and
[1:18:29] him then have you transitioned to the
[1:18:30] family and the church and the brothers
[1:18:32] and so forth but this is the greatest
[1:18:34] place to be and in that place you go
[1:18:39] beyond the tiredness we come to church
[1:18:42] go beyond the thymus go beyond thinking
[1:18:44] about the lunch it's a shallow
[1:18:50] man word man is often neglected between
[1:18:52] Sunday and Wednesday and Wednesday and
[1:18:54] Sunday that part is neglected that's
[1:18:56] what we're here to feed the small amen
[1:19:00] all right you go beyond that still God
[1:19:03] comes down and that's where I'm don't
[1:19:07] matter the presence of God you make time
[1:19:09] subject to eternity eternity was before
[1:19:12] time time came because of the fall let
[1:19:15] me tell you this I said this to the
[1:19:17] church back home I preached the same
[1:19:19] thought 24 hours have not changed in
[1:19:24] 6,000 years you think time spit at times
[1:19:28] not spit up time never spit up that
[1:19:32] hours full of 60 minutes yeah
[1:19:36] 3,600 seconds hasn't changed because you
[1:19:41] have become so busy we feel if I'm
[1:19:43] speeding up you allowed Satan to come
[1:19:45] and place the manza you felt were of
[1:19:47] importance tool to your life and the
[1:19:49] first thing you did was push God to the
[1:19:51] background that's why you've got no time
[1:19:53] you got you re-engineered your life to
[1:19:55] accommodate the devil that's why you've
[1:19:57] got no time you're more concern about
[1:20:00] your pay and you're keeping your car and
[1:20:02] having all these things to look the
[1:20:04] parts then what you are concerned about
[1:20:06] the things of God that's why you have no
[1:20:08] time I'll show you that proper talking
[1:20:11] about Martin Luther the more he had to
[1:20:13] do and he found everything else he got
[1:20:19] done why because you put seek first the
[1:20:23] kingdom of God and all the other things
[1:20:26] that Adams you seen that have you
[1:20:29] actually seen that in your life you go
[1:20:31] before God and you're given your time
[1:20:32] you go to work and things fall into
[1:20:34] place unusually fall into place just
[1:20:37] doesn't normally happen that way until
[1:20:41] you start putting him really fast my cuz
[1:20:44] God honors his word
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:48] you mean we have to accommodate God man
[1:20:50] if you accommodate God what God do want
[1:20:55] to accommodate the devil who does
[1:20:56] nothing for you all you get is more
[1:20:58] letters with windows in them when you
[1:21:00] accommodate the devil that's all you get
[1:21:04] all these things you have to pay all
[1:21:07] these bills all these things that's all
[1:21:09] you get when you accommodate the devil
[1:21:11] yeah but when you come and they God the
[1:21:15] one who provides the healing provides
[1:21:17] the peace provide the sleep that you
[1:21:18] need you mean if I if I go before the
[1:21:21] Lord and make some time to pray before I
[1:21:23] go to bed and it's already late the
[1:21:25] morning wore out but if you don't and
[1:21:27] you go to bed all you're gonna do is
[1:21:28] cost and turn on my anyway but imagine
[1:21:31] if you just able more things went to bed
[1:21:34] and watch how that in 10 minutes it's
[1:21:35] like eight hours worth of sleep think
[1:21:40] God is limited that's right Lord opened
[1:21:47] our eyes to see how we are to live our
[1:21:52] lives amen
[1:21:55] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:21:58] deliver us from evil what is prayer to
[1:22:01] find the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:04] lead us Lord because he the Holy Ghost
[1:22:07] said in Revelation 3:10 because thou has
[1:22:09] kept the word of my patience I will also
[1:22:12] keep thee from the hour of temptation
[1:22:14] lead us not into temptation by keeping
[1:22:18] the word of my patience I will keep you

[1:22:45] conventions don't messed up in the world
[1:22:47] they're not being kept from the hour of
[1:22:50] temptation because they have not yet to
[1:22:52] meet the unmasked God and receive them
[1:22:57] in their lives
[1:22:59] hallelujah Tim patient as a path to evil
[1:23:02] but the Holy spirt will keep you on the
[1:23:03] right path keep us on the right path

[1:24:45] a pulpit you're serving God when you run
[1:24:48] a DVD being watched by another church
[1:24:50] that you're serving God that's what
[1:24:52] people think it means to serve God when
[1:24:54] that when they're doing something in the
[1:24:55] church and say it's when you step out of
[1:24:57] bed in the morning say Lord here am I
[1:24:59] leave me by your spirit and God will
[1:25:01] bring you into contact with every person
[1:25:02] that you need to be
[1:25:03] and you serve them in that measure and
[1:25:06] when you are effective and faithful in
[1:25:08] that measure he will take you on to
[1:25:10] greater things till you are living out
[1:25:12] the fullness of your personal Commission
[1:25:15] hallelujah I'm sorry about all the spit
[1:25:20] you might need a wearing jacket in front
[1:25:22] rate and the final word was a min what
[1:25:27] does that mean so be it
[1:25:28] in other words all these things Lord let
[1:25:31] them be in my life I don't just want
[1:25:34] half of what you've sinned all of what
[1:25:37] you've sinned let it be established let
[1:25:40] it be done Lord as much as it hurts and
[1:25:43] might feel like an inconvenience as well
[1:25:46] let it be done
[1:25:47] hallelujah and now you watch the change
[1:25:52] some of us I know that your people here
[1:25:56] this morning people here have been in
[1:25:58] that place of prayer you know the power
[1:26:01] of it but often for all of us and myself
[1:26:03] included they are memories of those
[1:26:06] times this is called to be more than a
[1:26:08] memory it is called to be a consistent
[1:26:10] everything in other words when you're
[1:26:14] washing the dishes you're in fellowship
[1:26:15] with God when you're out there spinners
[1:26:18] and grease all over your eyes in
[1:26:20] communion with God we're in the
[1:26:22] supermarket the communion with God he's
[1:26:25] the first one you talk to at the dawning
[1:26:27] of a new day
[1:26:28] the last one you talk to at the end of
[1:26:30] the day and the one you talk the most to
[1:26:32] during the day you're so conscious of
[1:26:35] God by being in fellowship with him my
[1:26:38] what a God and he wants that so much but
[1:26:42] you know what this God is a gentleman he
[1:26:44] don't push himself on you he's not like
[1:26:47] that he just wants you to act your own
[1:26:49] leisure your own willingness go before
[1:26:52] him and say Lord here am i and here we
[1:26:55] go and do you were a bless above what
[1:26:58] you can imagine thank you gentlemen it's
[1:27:01] all gone what you want to serve a God
[1:27:05] why don't be married to somebody like
[1:27:07] that God don't force himself the devil
[1:27:10] forces himself when he makes you listen
[1:27:12] to his music
[1:27:13] everywhere you go you have to listen to
[1:27:15] it you have to watch all his stuff on
[1:27:17] the billboards and see it in the
[1:27:19] magazines is on the television and
[1:27:20] Internet everything pops up it makes you
[1:27:23] see all that and what does it do for you
[1:27:26] yeah oh you do as you go through life
[1:27:28] the jected bombarded falling plenteous
[1:27:33] tears it's empty
[1:27:37] this is the devil that we make a lot of
[1:27:40] accommodation for and that's all he can
[1:27:44] do for you I think the devil cares about
[1:27:46] your talent the devil will harness your
[1:27:48] talent you glorify him and when you've
[1:27:50] served his purpose you'll spit you out
[1:27:52] and leave you on the side walls yeah
[1:27:53] that's the devil all these great movie
[1:27:56] stars ones have served their purpose
[1:27:57] they get spat out and all they end up is
[1:28:00] laying dead on a bear the whole bunch of
[1:28:02] needles around them they're drunk
[1:28:04] whatever shots they serve their purpose
[1:28:07] to glorify the devil and he spits them
[1:28:09] out and that's the devil we accommodate
[1:28:12] often what does God called us to spit
[1:28:16] you out
[1:28:17] I'll tell you what when you've served
[1:28:18] your purpose he takes you home to glory
[1:28:21] they take you've served your purpose the
[1:28:24] reason why you're here this morning and
[1:28:26] woke up and drew breath cuz you and not
[1:28:29] finish with you as long as you draw
[1:28:34] breath you have a service purpose what
[1:28:43] is God thing as he spit you out now he
[1:28:45] promotes you the glory
[1:28:46] death is promotion
[1:28:50] hallelujah she's not going down she's
[1:28:53] going to our greater body at the opening
[1:28:56] that's already waiting hallelujah we're
[1:29:00] talking about this last night and the
[1:29:02] Holy Ghost links you up with your word
[1:29:05] representation that is already there in
[1:29:07] other words brother Chris the real you
[1:29:10] is over there and perfection the real me
[1:29:13] is over there already in perfection and
[1:29:15] I never knew it without the Holy Ghost
[1:29:17] but when the word came my way something
[1:29:20] within me responded and when I received
[1:29:23] the Holy Ghost and aligned me with my
[1:29:25] word
[1:29:25] patience Alleluia death is only the
[1:29:31] proper set of buggy how it hitches you
[1:29:35] up to take you into the glory amen
[1:29:39] praise the Lord let these things be done
[1:29:40] Lord now what is prayer prayer is
[1:29:42] humanity praying to deity that's what
[1:29:45] the people stumble over if he is God why
[1:29:47] is he praying who's he praying to Jesus
[1:29:50] was all God and completely men oh that's
[1:29:55] the mystery of it's his humanity his
[1:29:58] flesh humanity prayed to the deity
[1:30:02] within him when you pray humanity praise
[1:30:06] to the deity who is a Holy Ghost already
[1:30:09] on the insane that's why the pattern of
[1:30:12] prayer is for those who have the Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost hallelujah my and if he was the
[1:30:21] fullness of the word and had to pray
[1:30:23] what about you only ever by measure yeah
[1:30:25] oh how much greater do we need to pray
[1:30:27] in this busy age slow it down
[1:30:31] lock yourself in a room for 24 hours and
[1:30:34] appreciate how long the day is you'll
[1:30:36] find nothing spit up yeah are you tired
[1:30:48] shall I continue you know if there's one
[1:30:53] subject for me in my whole life to this
[1:30:56] point that holds such a weight evaluates
[1:30:59] in the subject there is nothing like
[1:31:01] this this is the greatest tool and we
[1:31:04] are come to harness there's nothing like
[1:31:06] this subject
[1:31:08] Jesus Jesus showed us that prayer and
[1:31:10] fasting are connected prayers aren't
[1:31:14] optional when you feel like it prayer is
[1:31:17] not what you make yourself do pray comes
[1:31:19] forth from within you it's automatic
[1:31:22] amen
[1:31:23] that's why when we come to church for
[1:31:25] some of us it's automatic we brother
[1:31:30] Andy said last night David said I was
[1:31:32] glad and when they said to me come and
[1:31:34] let's go up to the house of
[1:31:35] something happened to David so when it
[1:31:38] was said let's go up to Zion
[1:31:39] oh my let's go up but but but for many
[1:31:44] of us it's or something and it's brother
[1:31:47] saw and said he has about two hours
[1:31:49] three hours and in a munch is the
[1:31:52] chicken is set for 12:00 p.m. and I know
[1:31:56] we get home and it's all carbon DUP and
[1:31:58] and listen that and what inconvenient
[1:32:02] they can the Lord change that you know
[1:32:08] what if you don't feel like that this
[1:32:09] morning I I'm glad to be in the house
[1:32:11] the Lord and I tell you there were days
[1:32:13] and my life rod was not glad to go up to
[1:32:15] the house to the Lord
[1:32:16] you know what changed that the Lord did
[1:32:17] for some of you it might be today it
[1:32:21] might be tomorrow might be in five years
[1:32:22] whenever but you all have your appointed
[1:32:24] time you can't get ahead of that time
[1:32:28] wherever you are no matter how messed up
[1:32:31] you are you exactly where God wants you
[1:32:33] even if it's the depth of sin you're a
[1:32:36] right where God wants you amen that's
[1:32:41] the paradox of free moral agency you
[1:32:42] have choice but God already knows
[1:32:47] hallelujah my prayer and fasting and
[1:32:51] connected now when Jesus was
[1:32:53] transfigured in Matthew 17 him Peter
[1:32:57] James and John descend from the mountain
[1:32:58] and the first thing they encounter is a
[1:33:00] man who has a child who is a lunatic
[1:33:04] possessed by a devil and the disciples
[1:33:08] were unable to cast the devil out and
[1:33:11] the the father of the child rushes to
[1:33:15] Jesus Falls of his fingers is not
[1:33:16] helping me
[1:33:17] my son he's possessed and he saw vex and
[1:33:21] he falls into the fire and into the
[1:33:23] water and he thrashes about you know how
[1:33:25] many times people had epileptic fits
[1:33:27] when they stood in the presence of the
[1:33:28] Prophet the devil always reacted when
[1:33:32] the people stood in the presence of the
[1:33:33] Prophet and thrash about because he knew
[1:33:37] his time was up
[1:33:38] and Jesus does Jesus work himself up
[1:33:43] devil I'll show these disciples
[1:33:46] stand aside this site was galloway bring
[1:33:50] me this - that's not what Jesus did
[1:33:52] bring me the child
[1:33:54] you see Jesus does the Bible says that
[1:33:57] he paused abundance of did Jesus shake
[1:34:02] the child come out of him devil Jesus
[1:34:08] rebukes the devil and the devil leaves
[1:34:11] and that her psyche was shocked because
[1:34:15] Jesus approach was so unorthodox because
[1:34:19] I'd been shaking the stuffing out of
[1:34:20] that little boy and he'd already been
[1:34:22] shaking enough with the devil in them
[1:34:24] and Jesus comes along it just says leave
[1:34:28] and the devil leaves a child and the
[1:34:32] disciple is a what is this and they come
[1:34:37] to Jesus apart and they say why could we
[1:34:39] not have cast them out why could we not
[1:34:42] cast out this devil you've already given
[1:34:44] us power to cast out Devils and now
[1:34:47] we've come across one that we are
[1:34:49] actually powerless against and jesus
[1:34:55] said unto them because of your unbelief
[1:34:56] I say unto you if you have faith as a
[1:34:59] grain of mustard seed in you shall say
[1:35:02] to this mountain being the Mount of
[1:35:03] Olives remove hints to you on the place
[1:35:05] and it shall we move now when we talk
[1:35:07] about this mountain if we're not
[1:35:08] spiritualizing it as a mountain of faith
[1:35:10] it's a mountain a grain of mustard seed
[1:35:14] faith has the power to move not a
[1:35:18] mountain of sin at a mountain now the
[1:35:21] Egmont mount ruapehu ad is that power
[1:35:24] just a great grain size faith spiritual
[1:35:29] eyes some of these things these things
[1:35:30] are that if you had that kind of faith
[1:35:36] you could say the mountain be removed
[1:35:38] and it would and nothing shall be
[1:35:40] impossible unto you healthy yet however
[1:35:42] this kind of devil dough is not out but
[1:35:47] by prayer and fasting
[1:35:51] man you mean you can only go so far
[1:35:55] handle Devils to a certain extent
[1:35:57] without fellowship with God yeah
[1:36:02] do you realize there are things there
[1:36:04] are Devils that often sit in your life
[1:36:06] that you are unable to deal with because
[1:36:08] you are out of a place of fellowship
[1:36:11] with God why do you have the setting
[1:36:14] sins that you just can't seem to shake
[1:36:15] off you've been up in older calls and
[1:36:19] they can't shake them out why there's no
[1:36:24] fellowship because in that fellowship
[1:36:30] see most two things that consecration is
[1:36:37] what will drive up every kind of every
[1:36:41] kind of devil why there are people out
[1:36:44] there in the world who because gifts and
[1:36:45] callings over their up dependence by
[1:36:47] birth
[1:36:47] they had a gift of faith and cast out
[1:36:49] there but they themselves have devils in
[1:36:51] their own life that are not cast out
[1:36:53] because unless they walk under this
[1:36:55] message to bring a real consecration
[1:36:59] there's no change in them this is more
[1:37:03] than just what we can revive is what
[1:37:05] could the Lord doing us these things are
[1:37:11] connected friends that's why I want to
[1:37:13] show you these things this morning Jesus
[1:37:18] never told his disciples how often he
[1:37:21] prayed how often he fasted yeah all he
[1:37:25] did was prove this consecration by
[1:37:27] casting oh yeah that's the secret
[1:37:31] something man who makes all the noise
[1:37:33] yeah there was a man just comes walking
[1:37:37] and he speaks it's not the place say
[1:37:43] stay Africa I've listened to ten
[1:37:46] messages of the prophets since Monday
[1:37:48] I've been praying for 15 hours minimum
[1:37:50] weekly and of that there is a man we
[1:37:54] behind-the-scenes private fellowship
[1:37:57] with the left hand don't know what the
[1:37:58] right hand is doing you like no idea
[1:38:00] he looks this person look absolutely
[1:38:02] ordinary to all of us
[1:38:03] just looks like the same brother Andy
[1:38:06] that he was last week or five years ago
[1:38:07] but what you don't know is what exists
[1:38:09] behind the scenes here comes a man
[1:38:11] walking and he can speak and he's
[1:38:13] effective and Devils are responding he's
[1:38:18] proving where he's at in the word by a
[1:38:21] manifestation by a life expressive
[1:38:23] what's happening behind the scenes you
[1:38:27] see that yeah it's not about how much
[1:38:30] you talk about what you do yeah your
[1:38:32] prowess with the quotes and the
[1:38:34] scriptures right it's when there is
[1:38:36] something to be done you go forth and
[1:38:37] you do like it's just ordinary the
[1:38:39] supernet was natural God wants to bring
[1:38:42] it in supernet was just natural just
[1:38:44] that's my life it's just what happens
[1:38:46] it's just what I do
[1:38:48] you eat breakfast because that's what
[1:38:50] you do you're in sweet communion with
[1:38:52] God because that's just what you do it's
[1:38:55] just my life I decide maybe we we have
[1:38:59] to start scrapping some things to give
[1:39:02] him now time you find out that 80% of
[1:39:06] what you do is totally a waste of time
[1:39:10] because as long as you want a body of
[1:39:12] flesh you are naturally attracted to
[1:39:14] fleshly service you can sit down for
[1:39:16] hour after hour on YouTube and and you
[1:39:18] start off watching about gardening and
[1:39:19] you end up watching about Jurassic Park
[1:39:21] by the end of the journey three hours
[1:39:23] later and you complain after we reach an
[1:39:25] hour and a half of the church what
[1:39:29] trilogy of law the Rings nine hours
[1:39:31] piece of cake easiest and complain yeah
[1:39:35] when you come into the house of God so
[1:39:38] you realize now that we indulge heavily
[1:39:40] and things that are totally unnecessary
[1:39:41] and you find that those things a bit
[1:39:44] from mental often to our walk they're
[1:39:46] not sinful some of those things they're
[1:39:48] not all sinful things but for some of us
[1:39:51] they are hindrances in our life and for
[1:39:53] God to have the greater effect in your
[1:39:56] life he calls you to a separation first
[1:40:00] there must be an acceptable separation
[1:40:03] to come into an acceptable union God
[1:40:08] will place the man's on you that he will
[1:40:10] not place on other people he will show
[1:40:12] you things in their private time of
[1:40:14] prayer hey look my son was spending too
[1:40:16] much
[1:40:17] I'm watching these things cut these
[1:40:19] things off because when you're cutting
[1:40:21] things off God gives you something
[1:40:22] better
[1:40:22] all right when you stop smoking it's not
[1:40:25] for you to go and be dry in a craving
[1:40:27] for a smoke for God to give you
[1:40:29] something bit time he always give me
[1:40:32] something better right we didn't come to
[1:40:35] serve the Lord to enjoy a life a
[1:40:37] disappointment it was to come at the
[1:40:39] true joy we actually find out what
[1:40:42] fulfillment is it's beyond winning the
[1:40:43] lotto amen beyond winning the lotto let
[1:40:47] me tell you this how many of you here
[1:40:49] this morning thought that when you got
[1:40:51] married you would be complete some of
[1:40:53] you did and when you got married and
[1:40:56] everything it settled down you found out
[1:40:58] that you were still not satisfied and
[1:41:00] then you thought if I got the pay rise
[1:41:02] and it's so much in the bank I feel like
[1:41:04] I'm really simple and complete and when
[1:41:06] you got there was good at the time in a
[1:41:09] little while no meeting more you thought
[1:41:12] when you had children family buy the
[1:41:15] home and have some own life and I'd feel
[1:41:16] completes and you've got the children in
[1:41:18] the family and it was all good and
[1:41:20] that's wonderful to hear but you found
[1:41:22] your student completes and you realize
[1:41:25] no matter what you think will be the
[1:41:27] thing that really settles it for you and
[1:41:29] gives you a sense of accomplishment it's
[1:41:31] always elusive it's never it's the only
[1:41:33] thing that can bring lasting fulfillment
[1:41:36] is when Christ is first then with your
[1:41:40] wife and your children all the money in
[1:41:42] the bank of the nice car in the flesh
[1:41:43] home your completes because God is in it
[1:41:46] hallelujah why not seek them first get
[1:41:50] your priorities the right way hey amen
[1:41:53] then all these other things can be added
[1:41:57] why do people run out to other things
[1:42:00] because they're empty you're empty
[1:42:03] that's why you run after other things
[1:42:05] get Christ in where you have a purpose
[1:42:07] and you find out you actually don't need
[1:42:10] those things because you're full of
[1:42:12] Jesus Christ and all you want to give
[1:42:14] your time to is serve Him you don't have
[1:42:17] time for the devil anymore you've got
[1:42:19] too much of God to deal with
[1:42:23] my can I have too much of God praise the
[1:42:28] Lord hallelujah my tailor I'm preaching
[1:42:33] to myself this morning
[1:42:35] I'm breaking myself over the tolls and
[1:42:37] cutting deep because it's it's needful
[1:42:39] for me but I see it in the when I say
[1:42:42] lord give me this give me that Lord
[1:42:46] hallelujah praying fasting a secret
[1:42:49] things they will produce a consecrated
[1:42:52] life watch what the Prophet said in
[1:42:54] Smyrna church age he says we have more
[1:42:57] wealth than we have ever had and yet
[1:42:59] unless is being accomplished spiritually
[1:43:01] it is not with money that God works
[1:43:05] he moves by his Spirit and that moving
[1:43:09] of the Spirit comes only to a life
[1:43:13] consecrated to the words hallelujah you
[1:43:16] want to see God move have a life
[1:43:19] consequent freeze alone the disciple has
[1:43:23] already had the power to cast out devils
[1:43:25] and mach3 they were already commissioned
[1:43:27] given the power and now they faced a
[1:43:30] devil they were lacking the faith cast
[1:43:33] out they didn't even have mustard seed
[1:43:36] faith because if they had that they
[1:43:38] could cast the devil out how much faith
[1:43:40] are we dealing friends
[1:43:41] cooking out what is faith revelation in
[1:43:44] other words give me a clearer
[1:43:45] understanding of your word
[1:43:47] and what is revelation relationship what
[1:43:51] he said last night it's a relationship
[1:43:52] that by the hour Albert's is their
[1:43:54] relationship that's what it is to know
[1:43:56] him because when you know him who's
[1:43:59] casting out the devil not me that's the
[1:44:02] God I know in me that's God standing
[1:44:05] there Oh what devil can stand against
[1:44:07] there was God standing before the
[1:44:10] lunatic child devil could stand before
[1:44:12] that but that was created by God had to
[1:44:16] obey God amen moving of the Spirit comes
[1:44:20] to a life consecrated to the word praise
[1:44:23] the Lord
[1:44:24] now what is fasting we pray teach us
[1:44:30] Lord how fast teachers no doubt of pray
[1:44:33] teach me Lord out fast what is it you
[1:44:35] realize these things and
[1:44:36] at all things are not actually a burden
[1:44:39] at all it's very straight for God is not
[1:44:41] going to give any things to
[1:44:42] inconvenience right that's not how God
[1:44:46] works 1964 the message identification
[1:44:52] the Prophet said a lady asked me coming
[1:44:54] down the road the other day from up here
[1:44:55] it's Florence who Shaqiri and brother
[1:44:57] Dimas his assistant it's just the
[1:44:59] Williams and then they sit in the car
[1:45:00] and she said brother Brennan I fast and
[1:45:03] fast and fast and still I can't cast out
[1:45:06] Devils
[1:45:06] I said you wasn't born to do such your
[1:45:10] duty is fast the Holy Spirit is working
[1:45:13] on somebody else out there for that in
[1:45:15] other words for the casting out of the
[1:45:17] devil but your part is too fast you
[1:45:19] don't know the place now this woman be
[1:45:22] Moisture carryin sister Florence she had
[1:45:24] a gift of fasting some people are gifted
[1:45:29] to pray right right there's a gift of
[1:45:32] bread that's why the church's prayer
[1:45:34] warriors who want to harness but then
[1:45:37] there's people like me who are not
[1:45:38] gifted in prayer and that's why for me
[1:45:42] it's breaking through the veil but when
[1:45:44] there's a gift you watch they can just
[1:45:47] soldier maybe as a gift and like this
[1:45:52] woman she had a gift to fast it was just
[1:45:54] an anointing something a better life
[1:45:55] just made her that way so fast cuz
[1:45:58] fasting is for a burden right it's
[1:46:01] because there's a need a burden
[1:46:03] something's weighing on you and she says
[1:46:08] I'm doing them fasting I'm praying when
[1:46:10] I'm fasting and I can't cast out
[1:46:11] villains the prophecy because you were
[1:46:13] not called to cast your Judy is too fast
[1:46:19] what was the success of the prophets and
[1:46:21] ministry the success of the ministry was
[1:46:24] not that just the angel had appeared to
[1:46:26] him the success of the ministry was the
[1:46:28] angels are the brothers you say out the
[1:46:30] back praying for the bros on their knees
[1:46:34] but nobody saw praying for him is what
[1:46:38] gave the success all those meetings
[1:46:41] I trust successive this morning is
[1:46:44] because they were phrase before Amen
[1:46:51] you've got to know what you're called to
[1:46:53] the limitations of boundaries of your
[1:46:55] corner yeah don't try and take dance
[1:46:57] portion or gets pushed ashes portion we
[1:46:59] take your portion what the Holy Ghost he
[1:47:02] finds to what Joshua tells you is yours
[1:47:04] this morning if you see that's yours
[1:47:06] you only take that much don't venture to
[1:47:08] brother Benz parts the other brothers
[1:47:12] and sisters pass on VIN cinta let's just
[1:47:14] be happy living in all that God said as
[1:47:19] you're not 50% but all the chosen of
[1:47:22] yours is only a small part living on the
[1:47:24] small parts it was a greater part of
[1:47:27] living all the great ago my and the
[1:47:34] prophet makes us an amazing thinkers
[1:47:36] remember showing you that fast things
[1:47:37] not a lot it not a chore it's not for
[1:47:40] you to go home brings hard enough the
[1:47:45] Prophet said people wouldn't miss port
[1:47:48] and fasting he says I won't read the
[1:47:50] crisis long one but here's a man wrote a
[1:47:52] book this isn't the message be in a veil
[1:47:55] 1956 a man wrote a book about fasting
[1:47:58] and he says that he had a picture of a
[1:48:02] woman on the cover and before she began
[1:48:05] her forty day fast apparently she looked
[1:48:07] a certain way but after the forty day
[1:48:09] fast she looked 20 years younger and
[1:48:12] everybody read the book all the woman
[1:48:15] read the book and they saw the picture
[1:48:17] of this young looking woman on the cover
[1:48:19] and they thought and they began to fast
[1:48:25] for 40 days he's woman because they they
[1:48:28] believe this because remember the
[1:48:31] inspiration behind the book was that
[1:48:32] Jesus fasted 40 days and so the man
[1:48:35] writes a book on the power of this kind
[1:48:37] of fast here is a young looking woman so
[1:48:40] everybody wants to lose some years and
[1:48:44] in the prophecies this so they began a
[1:48:46] faster forty days as is some of them
[1:48:48] with false plates and their teeth would
[1:48:50] drop out and the eyes would sink bet
[1:48:52] and mothers-to-be woman to be mothers in
[1:48:54] little ones that you understand they
[1:48:56] would go completely mentally out and be
[1:48:58] taken into the institutions many of them
[1:49:00] come in that condition and the
[1:49:02] prophecies I believe in fasting
[1:49:04] certainly but when you fast you don't
[1:49:07] hunger ah Jesus
[1:49:13] after he got through fasting the Bible
[1:49:15] says he was hungry ah that means you're
[1:49:22] not putting yourself into a fast yeah
[1:49:24] it's an automatic thing think about this
[1:49:30] we continue say you've got a nice roast
[1:49:33] you're really looking for hungry the
[1:49:38] fragrance of it is coming through the
[1:49:39] oven and you're ready that eats like we
[1:49:41] were last no we really that ate but
[1:49:45] imagine the phone rings we're all we're
[1:49:47] just ready to eat and the phone rings
[1:49:50] are we here tragedy in the family loved
[1:49:53] ones has been killed
[1:49:55] hunger gone automatic fast just lay your
[1:50:01] burdens you are burdened because this
[1:50:03] relates to you often you don't feel that
[1:50:06] way when it's tragedy about somebody
[1:50:07] else but when it starts heading home
[1:50:09] boom straight into a fast see that yeah
[1:50:14] now we understanding a bit more aren't
[1:50:15] we yeah how these things work
[1:50:19] the men and the prophecies he certainly
[1:50:21] captured the woman the man that did
[1:50:23] there wrote the book and says all these
[1:50:24] things fasting is an anointing it's a
[1:50:29] time where you were denying the flesh to
[1:50:32] get alone with God now what I want to
[1:50:34] show you is there's three levels of
[1:50:36] fasting and that fast that Jesus had was
[1:50:39] the highest level of fasting but there
[1:50:42] are two other levels the Prophet said in
[1:50:46] perseverance 1962 yesterday I was
[1:50:50] sitting in the room usually Friday is a
[1:50:52] fast day for me I don't eat on sometimes
[1:50:55] Tuesdays and Fridays till sometime in
[1:50:59] the afternoon that's he said that's not
[1:51:01] a regular fast that's just a couple of
[1:51:04] days a week too fast so
[1:51:06] a longer fast comes and more days when
[1:51:09] the Lord puts it upon you but this type
[1:51:13] of fast he's talking about that's just
[1:51:15] in respects and honor of God's great
[1:51:18] memorial to us the fasting a command and
[1:51:21] so after three o'clock usually I have
[1:51:23] something late now watch
[1:51:25] there is fasting out of respect to God's
[1:51:28] Word and when he would fast out of
[1:51:32] respected God's Word he would put time
[1:51:34] aside to just spend alone in the
[1:51:37] scripture in prayer it's not eating
[1:51:39] maybe to the early afternoon three
[1:51:41] o'clock then he might have something to
[1:51:43] eat in the fastest finish and he's
[1:51:44] hungry because it's not an anointing
[1:51:46] it's out of respect to the word and
[1:51:48] during that time he's he's devoting
[1:51:51] himself to the presence of God this is
[1:51:54] not something where you go to work in
[1:51:55] your fasting right when you're taking
[1:51:58] time aside to spin in the presence of
[1:52:01] God and you're hungry because it's not
[1:52:04] anointing it's respectable word that's
[1:52:06] the lowest level of fasting very brief
[1:52:09] not even a full thing this respect God
[1:52:14] honors his word now watch that's the
[1:52:18] lowest level when Jesus went to the
[1:52:20] wilderness to be tempted he did not go
[1:52:23] too fast for me they went quick I mean
[1:52:26] he did not go there too he went there
[1:52:30] because he was led by the spirit to be
[1:52:32] tempted and when he's when he's there
[1:52:36] being tempted he's not eating and he's
[1:52:38] unconscious of the fact he's not eating
[1:52:41] nor drinking he's oblivious to the fact
[1:52:45] that he's in a fast and after he what
[1:52:48] stands the devil by the word that he's
[1:52:51] trained in then the Bible says after
[1:52:54] what he wasn't hungry let me say that
[1:52:58] again the devil tempted him after he was
[1:53:00] a hunger after the anointing of the fast
[1:53:03] came off him and he was hungry that's
[1:53:05] when the devil tempted him but he did
[1:53:08] not go too fast it wasn't a 19th at was
[1:53:10] upon him right when Moses went up into
[1:53:13] Mount Sinai to receive the law and the
[1:53:16] instruction on how to build the
[1:53:18] tabernacle
[1:53:19] he did not go there too fast he went
[1:53:22] there because God instructed him to go
[1:53:24] on up and when he's receiving revelation
[1:53:26] from God he goes into an automatic fast
[1:53:29] because he's there for 40 days and 40
[1:53:31] nights and neither ate nor drank and
[1:53:34] he's not hungry the highest level when
[1:53:38] Elijah was fleeing from Jezebel in the
[1:53:40] Book of Kings and the angel prepared a
[1:53:43] meal free Elijah
[1:53:45] the Bible says Elijah went and the
[1:53:47] strength of that meal for forty days you
[1:53:50] know Elijah was not intending to fasts
[1:53:52] he just ate a meal and that was it for
[1:53:55] forty days
[1:53:55] it's an anointing it's an anointing that
[1:53:59] is the highest level and you may never
[1:54:01] experience it once in your life but that
[1:54:04] is a level of fasting that exists then
[1:54:08] the second level of fasting is what
[1:54:12] Daniel experienced and dangled Tim
[1:54:15] Daniel was burdened because the angel
[1:54:17] things have been revealed to him in the
[1:54:18] word and he's burdened about what he's
[1:54:21] singing the word and the Bible says he's
[1:54:24] seeking the will of God and the Bible
[1:54:26] says that he ate no Pleasant bread for
[1:54:30] 21 days the only thing he's not eating
[1:54:34] his Pleasant bread
[1:54:36] he's eating unleavened bread but not
[1:54:39] Pleasant bread so he's still having a
[1:54:41] little food and water over 21 days but
[1:54:45] the whole appetite to eat normally is
[1:54:47] not there because of the burden that he
[1:54:49] has to receive from the angel then after
[1:54:54] 21 days II angel comes down Gabriel
[1:54:56] comes down and apologizes for the delay
[1:55:00] and then after he has revealed certain
[1:55:03] things the fast is over and he's back to
[1:55:06] eating normally again that is the second
[1:55:08] level of fasting that is why when you
[1:55:11] are burdened about something this is now
[1:55:12] beyond respects to God's Word you just
[1:55:15] have your whole focus is Lord know what
[1:55:19] I'm needing something I need a response
[1:55:21] I need it I need to draw from you and it
[1:55:24] takes away the appetite you might sip a
[1:55:26] little water and have a little cracker
[1:55:28] here and there just to keep you going
[1:55:31] the main appetites not there that's the
[1:55:33] second level of fasting those are the
[1:55:35] three levels the lowest respect gods
[1:55:37] were not even a day you take time alone
[1:55:40] with God just to think on his word
[1:55:41] commune with them the second level is
[1:55:43] your burdens you might eat a little
[1:55:45] something here until the Lord comes on
[1:55:47] the scene and settles your heart the
[1:55:49] appetite returns and the highest level
[1:55:51] is when there is an anointing God comes
[1:55:54] down there's no thought there's no
[1:55:56] hunger there's no thirst there's nothing
[1:55:58] you understand that this morning so is
[1:56:00] it difficult it's so simple isn't it
[1:56:03] it's an inconvenient no it's not God
[1:56:07] would put rigors on us why those people
[1:56:13] who worship their foreign gods make
[1:56:14] trips to make and prays five times a day
[1:56:16] and all these demands and that's so
[1:56:18] faithful and all we have to do is push
[1:56:21] the pedal in our cars and come to church
[1:56:23] and it's too hot oh why how did the
[1:56:32] burden come on Daniel Daniel was looking
[1:56:35] in the word he was seeing what was
[1:56:38] written in the word and he wanted that
[1:56:40] see the word be reality he wanted to be
[1:56:45] in the place where the word was at amen
[1:56:48] he wanted to make the angel and when he
[1:56:51] prepared his heart when he got serious
[1:56:53] about what he was seeing the angel came
[1:56:55] he was reading The Book of Jeremiah here
[1:56:58] in about 70 years in Babylon and his
[1:57:00] burdens and Gabriel comes down to tell
[1:57:04] him about seventy weeks how does the
[1:57:08] angel come Prince you want to meet the
[1:57:11] angel take admit the angel how does the
[1:57:14] angel come down desperation serious go
[1:57:18] beyond the veil of tyldus or a humanity
[1:57:21] go beyond all that's and live and watch
[1:57:23] the Ange let's the presence of God
[1:57:25] coming down in your little closets
[1:57:26] that's where you can stay there for 40
[1:57:28] minutes one hour two hours three days
[1:57:30] whatever you'll just stay there
[1:57:37] once you finish talking and pouring out
[1:57:39] yourself just wait Thanks who's the
[1:57:43] angel friends I was telling this last
[1:57:44] night who's Gabriel who is Gabriel who's
[1:57:49] Michael I will tell you right now
[1:57:51] Michael and Gabriel Jesus Christ
[1:57:55] every time Gabriel appears in the Bible
[1:57:58] he is the giver of Revelation so right
[1:58:00] Daniel 8 he's revealing the vision of
[1:58:02] the RAM and he goes Daniel 9 he's
[1:58:04] revealing about the 70 weeks Daniel 10
[1:58:06] is telling about the the battle between
[1:58:08] the Prince of Persia and the things that
[1:58:10] will unfold he comes to Zacharias and
[1:58:13] Luke 1 and he discerns the condition of
[1:58:16] Elizabeth your wife is barren she's old
[1:58:17] stricken in years but will bring forth
[1:58:19] an angel with discernment an angel who
[1:58:21] gives revelation who is this angel all
[1:58:25] through the Old Testament the angel of
[1:58:27] the Lord he does not have a name but by
[1:58:29] the Book of Daniel he's given a name
[1:58:31] Gabriel a man every time Daniel saw him
[1:58:34] what did he see a man he described a man
[1:58:38] and that man was God Gabriel as the give
[1:58:43] of revelation comes to Mary you will
[1:58:45] bring forth a son you know that was God
[1:58:47] announcing his own birth
[1:58:49] Gabriel was God standing there telling
[1:58:51] Mary about when he's going to be born
[1:58:56] now let me tell you this in 1946 who
[1:58:59] appeared to the prophet
[1:59:03] Gabriel but I thought it was Jesus
[1:59:06] Christ who was with the Prophet who's
[1:59:09] Jesus Christ who was it that discerned
[1:59:12] the names and the addresses and the
[1:59:14] conditions of every single person was it
[1:59:16] brother Branham was it God was God
[1:59:19] wasn't it
[1:59:20] but what's God's name in that position
[1:59:21] when he's to give out of Revelation
[1:59:23] what's his name
[1:59:24] Gabriel he was a man that stepped out of
[1:59:28] the ball of fire
[1:59:32] do you realize before he was a man he
[1:59:35] was the pillar of fire that appeared in
[1:59:38] the log cabin in 1906 and hovered above
[1:59:40] the bed of the Prophet he was a ball of
[1:59:42] fire and then when the Prophet was seven
[1:59:44] years of age that ball of fire is now a
[1:59:46] whirlwind that's B
[1:59:48] a talking world winds then in 1946 and
[1:59:53] greens more Indiana and a cave here is
[1:59:56] the ball of fire and out all that steps
[1:59:58] a man whose voice is the same as the
[2:00:01] whirlwinds so who is this man it must be
[2:00:05] the pillar of fire
[2:00:06] it must be God himself Jesus Christ
[2:00:10] appearing in these last days as Gabriel
[2:00:13] who was the giver of Revelation so who's
[2:00:17] Michael Jesus Christ the protector of
[2:00:21] his word every time Michael is seen in
[2:00:24] the Bible Daniel chapter 12
[2:00:25] he's there to deliver the names written
[2:00:27] in the book it's your name written in
[2:00:29] the book he's there to deliver the names
[2:00:31] hallelujah when he's seen in Jude
[2:00:34] there's a contention between the devil
[2:00:36] and Michael about the body of Moses it's
[2:00:39] confrontation and Michael says the Lord
[2:00:41] rebuke Satan revelation 12 it's a war
[2:00:45] between Lucifer and Michael it's warfare
[2:00:49] God standing for his word God standing
[2:00:52] for his people that protector of his
[2:00:54] revelation God changing office depending
[2:00:57] on what he wants to achieve mine where
[2:01:03] do we first read about Michael in the
[2:01:06] Bible Michael comes to help Gabriel
[2:01:13] Daniel was in prayer
[2:01:14] 21 days fasting wanting the Lord to come
[2:01:17] my angel Lord send the angel and Gabriel
[2:01:20] finally turns up and he apologized he
[2:01:22] says gate Daniel I'm sorry but for 21
[2:01:24] days the Prince of Persia who is the
[2:01:26] devil withstood me and I he could not
[2:01:29] prevail as Gabriel over the devil in
[2:01:33] that office so what does Gabriel have to
[2:01:36] do change form and become Michael and as
[2:01:40] Michael the devil is driven back and it
[2:01:42] becomes Gabriel and speaks Daniel is
[2:01:45] that so hard you talk about one God but
[2:01:49] the Prophet come in these last days to
[2:01:51] reveal who God is and the prophets say
[2:01:53] God is not one like that yeah why
[2:01:55] because in Revelation 4 it's 1 God on
[2:01:57] the throne but the seven spirits of the
[2:01:59] one God before the throne and
[2:02:01] for cherubims of the one God before the
[2:02:03] throne I thought there's only one God
[2:02:05] there is only one God who can reveal
[2:02:08] himself and men afore offices
[2:02:09] hallelujah that one purifier became a
[2:02:13] hundred and twenty licks afire in the
[2:02:15] upper room one God became seven heavenly
[2:02:19] angels that formed the cloud in 1963
[2:02:22] that was the seven spirits of God in the
[2:02:24] form of the cloud revealing one God
[2:02:27] hallelujah so who is the mighty angel
[2:02:31] that came down in Revelation 10 Gabriel
[2:02:34] himself the giver of revelation the
[2:02:37] angel appearing to those who are looking
[2:02:39] for him those who are needing him to
[2:02:42] come he's descended on an age level but
[2:02:45] he has to descend to personally to me
[2:02:48] and that's what your prayer life is all
[2:02:51] about to bring Gabriel into your little
[2:02:53] big chamber bring him there now when
[2:02:57] you're walking with you when you're
[2:03:01] speaking Gabriel speaks for you amen
[2:03:04] when you're sick you don't need Jehovah
[2:03:07] Nissi you need Jehovah Rapha when
[2:03:13] there's something that you need you need
[2:03:17] more than Jehovah Shalom I want God as
[2:03:20] Jehovah Jireh
[2:03:21] I need God to manifest himself in a
[2:03:24] specific office to meet my need when he
[2:03:28] was the son of God a spirit being
[2:03:31] he cannot shed his blood in that office
[2:03:33] so he changes father becomes a son of
[2:03:35] man and in that form he can shed blood
[2:03:38] the penny of what he must have chief in
[2:03:41] his office he changes form becomes that
[2:03:43] tooth of thorns simple isn't it we're
[2:03:49] thinking about all these angels and it's
[2:03:50] one God revealing himself in different
[2:03:53] forms this angel who's appeared to us
[2:03:56] and these last days Saints is Gabriel
[2:03:59] himself Jesus Christ the person of the
[2:04:02] Holy Ghost has appeared to us
[2:04:04] when does he appear when there's
[2:04:07] fellowship winners and since the golden
[2:04:09] altar was where the incense was offered
[2:04:11] the incense is the prayers when the
[2:04:13] prayers are going
[2:04:14] before the Lord the angel appears where
[2:04:16] was the Prophet when Gabriel appeared in
[2:04:18] his cave pray where was Daniel when
[2:04:21] Gabriel appears alone praying where was
[2:04:24] echo rious when Gabriel appeared
[2:04:26] offering incense and the people were
[2:04:28] outside praying to where and when is the
[2:04:32] angel going to come when there's prayer
[2:04:35] when this fellowship when there is
[2:04:38] communion with God this Gabriel ceases
[2:04:42] to be a figment of your imagination and
[2:04:44] is a living reality walking and speaking
[2:04:47] through you you know where the golden
[2:04:53] altar was placed it was placed just
[2:04:56] before the Holy of Holies was the last
[2:04:57] piece of furniture before you go into
[2:04:59] the Holy avoids
[2:05:00] what brings you closest to God what will
[2:05:03] bring you the very presence of God the
[2:05:05] high priests could not go into the Holy
[2:05:06] of Holies unless and since was often
[2:05:09] first you want to go in the presence of
[2:05:11] God offer up the incense yeah get a lone
[2:05:15] fellowship with the Lord amen and the
[2:05:18] smoke goes up and were blankets it will
[2:05:21] blanket the sanctuary
[2:05:23] it will blanket your home will blanket
[2:05:25] your life you are enveloped by a
[2:05:26] supernatural atmosphere incense the
[2:05:33] Prophet said in the Victory Day 1963 you
[2:05:35] realized before the Prophet would step
[2:05:37] out in front of the people to preach the
[2:05:39] word he prayed first he was on his knees
[2:05:42] all however he was waiting on the Lord
[2:05:45] then when he stepped out the prophecies
[2:05:48] in victory day he says then I walk out
[2:05:50] and I say I am covered with prayer Satan
[2:05:55] you can't do nothing to me I come in the
[2:05:57] name of the Lord Jesus you see something
[2:05:59] happens you're covered in the incense
[2:06:02] you're covered in your prayer and you
[2:06:04] can walk out the Satan cannot do
[2:06:06] anything against you why was the angel
[2:06:12] Gabriel so pleased to stand next to the
[2:06:14] prophets because of the incense he
[2:06:18] stepped out a man prayed up and Gabriel
[2:06:21] can step into that kind of atmosphere
[2:06:23] yes God don't appear at the rock concert
[2:06:26] god don't appear there but he will pair
[2:06:28] with us the right worship yeah you've
[2:06:30] been hearing about worship in this
[2:06:32] church haven't you well pray and worship
[2:06:33] is the same thing yeah that's why when
[2:06:37] we sing our singing us to match the
[2:06:39] preaching of the word oftentimes if we
[2:06:42] preach how we sin we're living away down
[2:06:44] here but the preaching of the word is to
[2:06:47] produce song that matches amen
[2:06:50] and then the church is now singing about
[2:06:52] her journey but local is simply singing
[2:06:55] about their journey and the Junction's
[2:06:58] that they win through what God's doing
[2:06:59] not in America not in German and Africa
[2:07:03] but here in Wellington not not in
[2:07:05] Taranaki but here in wailing - we sing
[2:07:08] about what the word is achieving yeah
[2:07:10] amen let's be covered with prayer
[2:07:13] covered with that incense and the secret
[2:07:17] - as I wrap this up that's relief for
[2:07:19] those of you who are wondering
[2:07:20] remembering the Lord 1963 he says but
[2:07:24] I've wondered many times if that word we
[2:07:27] use it just right communion now commune
[2:07:30] means to talk to see to commune with and
[2:07:33] I wonder if really when we make together
[2:07:35] like this and have any places event
[2:07:37] isn't communion that we are communing
[2:07:39] with God talking to him now watch what
[2:07:41] he says and then if we just sit spill
[2:07:45] and let him answer us back many things
[2:07:49] and one of the horrible things that I do
[2:07:51] I will try I try to do all the talking
[2:07:54] and not sit still long enough for him to
[2:07:57] answer me back oh we do that so many
[2:08:03] times in prayer I think if we could get
[2:08:05] off of their heart what's in it and
[2:08:07] express ourself to the Lord Jesus and
[2:08:10] then just kneel and just be spill a
[2:08:13] while and just see what he would say
[2:08:16] back to us and sometimes I've did that
[2:08:21] and my whole opinion was changed you see
[2:08:23] I'd go to him ask him something now Lord
[2:08:26] these people really they've got
[2:08:27] something I believe they want me over
[2:08:29] here and I just start praying and first
[2:08:31] thing you know I'm just satisfied that
[2:08:33] that's the Lord's will but after I pray
[2:08:36] if I just linger a little while then
[2:08:40] it's changed altogether sometimes sent
[2:08:43] somewhere else just commune with the
[2:08:46] Lord
[2:08:46] oh what glorious fellowship just to get
[2:08:48] down and talk and commune and wait for
[2:08:50] him to talk back do we do that Oh My
[2:08:55] isn't that where we fall short we do all
[2:08:58] the talking
[2:08:59] amen we're ripping - our day we never
[2:09:05] just wait and wait wait just wait let
[2:09:12] him come because when he comes he can
[2:09:14] show you how you make this right maybe
[2:09:20] that faith that you're wanting in your
[2:09:22] life will come if you just wait and he
[2:09:23] can come down with the faith in the
[2:09:26] positive but you get up and he's still
[2:09:28] on his way he turns up in the room and
[2:09:30] you're not there the faith that was for
[2:09:33] you do you pray for you're not there
[2:09:34] receiving too much in haste communion is
[2:09:39] a two-way affair and natural life the
[2:09:44] husband's up just talking to his wife
[2:09:46] and then he gets up and leaves and never
[2:09:48] lets her speak bet that's how the voice
[2:09:50] happens naturally you talk to one
[2:09:54] another yeah but you don't do that with
[2:09:56] God you present your list of demands all
[2:10:00] these things that you want to get sorted
[2:10:01] out to start your day because it's quite
[2:10:03] inconvenient being in this place but
[2:10:06] when the word becomes much more real to
[2:10:09] you this is not about you even going
[2:10:11] before God with anything that you want
[2:10:13] yeah you're not even thinking about that
[2:10:17] you just thank you Jesus praise your
[2:10:20] name thank you for watching them and I
[2:10:24] tell you for many of us some of us may
[2:10:27] be where there's been no prayer life if
[2:10:29] there's a lot of things - thank the Lord
[2:10:30] for I'll tell you when you get down and
[2:10:33] you'll be now to fellowship with the
[2:10:35] Lord for a long time
[2:10:36] you'll be staying there a long time when
[2:10:38] you go in as president is a lot of
[2:10:40] porking do a lot of things to think of
[2:10:43] the for lot of things to make right you
[2:10:46] know what happens when there is this
[2:10:47] rich constant fellowship with God
[2:10:51] when you go before the Lord the second
[2:10:53] time in the third fine now you can start
[2:10:55] looking at the new territory yeah
[2:10:57] because you've got all those other
[2:10:58] things out of the way yes if a laborer
[2:11:00] in his present you spoken about these
[2:11:03] things we've conversed about this and
[2:11:04] that he's spoken back to me now we can
[2:11:07] look at other things now we can start
[2:11:09] addressing my shortcomings or things I
[2:11:11] would like to see or but the the home
[2:11:14] I'd like to buy all these other things
[2:11:15] you're gonna dress because all that bed
[2:11:18] block there backlog of undone business
[2:11:22] now you can just really spend time
[2:11:25] fellowshipping in a deeper level for
[2:11:28] many of us even this morning for some of
[2:11:29] us where you're at is just going to fall
[2:11:32] the Lord making things right lay it out
[2:11:35] before all your burdens or your
[2:11:37] vexations or your should get straight
[2:11:39] sort out things with God and get on the
[2:11:41] straight and narrow with God once that's
[2:11:43] all laid out then when you come before
[2:11:45] him again you can start looking at these
[2:11:46] things start addressing other things you
[2:11:50] see how it is but often all it is if we
[2:11:53] come before the Lord oh I need this and
[2:11:54] be with me today and be with mom and be
[2:11:56] and be just shallow stuff we're talking
[2:11:59] about getting alone pouring it out
[2:12:01] pouring it out that's so rich amen and
[2:12:08] sometimes that kind of rich prayer might
[2:12:10] only be ten minutes another day it might
[2:12:12] be an hour might be two hours might be
[2:12:15] five minutes just when it's done then
[2:12:17] you're satisfying the Lord is satisfied
[2:12:20] get up amen some days you will be in a
[2:12:24] channel to pray there are days where I'm
[2:12:27] in a channel to pray there are other
[2:12:29] days I'm not in a channel whether you're
[2:12:31] in the channel out of the channel
[2:12:33] breakthrough amen breakthrough bring
[2:12:37] flesh rugged soldiers of Jesus Christ we
[2:12:42] have trouble praying have you done like
[2:12:43] prank tell the Lord what I hate it I
[2:12:44] can't stand it I don't like coming to
[2:12:47] church
[2:12:48] I don't enjoy reading the Bible tell
[2:12:50] them you already knows how many times
[2:12:55] have I picked up the Bible and read
[2:12:56] Ezekiel and by the second verse I'm
[2:12:58] completely lost
[2:12:58] but no idea what it's talking about all
[2:13:01] the dates and the language confused why
[2:13:03] don't stand it
[2:13:04] too complicated but no idea what it's
[2:13:07] talking about help me to understand and
[2:13:13] then when you go on your journey when
[2:13:15] you go on your journey through life you
[2:13:16] musicians will come when you go through
[2:13:18] your journey we could maybe play into my
[2:13:21] chamber be free Holy Spirit this journey
[2:13:27] that you are on it's between you and the
[2:13:29] Lord right it's not so that for you to
[2:13:33] compete with each other better
[2:13:34] who's where who's the more in advance
[2:13:36] whose are more related that's not what
[2:13:38] it's about it's a personal journey the
[2:13:41] Lord might reveal one thing to you today
[2:13:44] you might not be a patch on
[2:13:46] understanding things like somebody
[2:13:48] else's but it's about knowing him see
[2:13:52] being in his will where he wants you to
[2:13:55] be that's that's how you want to walk
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:01] and so we want to I trust take these
[2:14:06] things go and think on these things get
[2:14:10] away from the kids get away from the
[2:14:12] husband wife some time now these things
[2:14:15] you cannot always do I'm talking about
[2:14:18] this private prayer you cannot always do
[2:14:19] it sometimes it's just not convenient
[2:14:21] but when there is the opportunity take
[2:14:28] there's opportunity this afternoon
[2:14:30] tonight for you whenever take it get
[2:14:35] alone with God maybe between Monday and
[2:14:37] Friday it's just you were just so busy
[2:14:39] as you are but when you get alone with
[2:14:41] God say Lord I have made my life so busy
[2:14:45] I have so many demands on me lord I
[2:14:49] cannot reengineer I cannot change it can
[2:14:51] I give you my full schedule and I'm
[2:14:56] asking that you were adjusted though I
[2:15:01] might have to work 12 hours a day and
[2:15:03] then sit with the kids and read them
[2:15:05] their stories and sit with a wife and
[2:15:08] talk to her and keep everybody happy
[2:15:10] Lord when I do all that I have no time a
[2:15:13] lord who reengineering so I have time
[2:15:16] this is why the prophets said if I could
[2:15:18] read us this quote here about Martin
[2:15:20] Luther he says he was a man given too
[2:15:23] much prayer and he learned that the more
[2:15:27] work he had to do and the more solely he
[2:15:30] was pressed for time the more of his
[2:15:33] time he gave to God in prayer in order
[2:15:37] to ensure satisfactory results that is
[2:15:41] so not what we are taught the more
[2:15:45] that's required of you the tighter your
[2:15:47] schedule is spend more time in prayer
[2:15:49] just stay there to watch all that other
[2:15:52] stuff God supernaturally arranges it
[2:15:56] because what's your desire God is first
[2:16:00] you honor me say at the water only
[2:16:05] amen she's been a help to us amen there
[2:16:19] are things that we do not understand
[2:16:20] fully this morning I for this afternoon
[2:16:23] listen to the recording there are things
[2:16:27] that you do not understand at all just
[2:16:29] wait there are things that I've said
[2:16:32] that you disagree with just wait wait a
[2:16:35] year wait five years wait until the
[2:16:39] revelation comes in your seer
[2:16:40] there are things I've asked the Lord
[2:16:42] about in his word I've waited 10 years
[2:16:44] to get an answer and when it came it was
[2:16:46] so straightforward so simple how could I
[2:16:48] not see it we're all at different levels
[2:16:50] sometimes when we preach were preaching
[2:16:53] seeing the vision here but often the
[2:16:55] people are only at this level and they
[2:16:57] only see things that they're live you're
[2:16:59] seeing a greater picture but wait just
[2:17:01] spend time with the Lord
[2:17:03] let them raise you higher and higher and
[2:17:05] higher and suddenly when I'm when you
[2:17:07] hear about Gabriel again you go yeah
[2:17:10] yeah I remember five years ago I didn't
[2:17:13] agree with what their privacy but I see

[2:17:18] said to her brother by email not long
[2:17:20] ago just leave it alone pray about it
