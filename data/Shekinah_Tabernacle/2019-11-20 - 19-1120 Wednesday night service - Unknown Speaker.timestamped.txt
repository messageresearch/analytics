[25:41] [Music]
[25:53] amen
[25:56] this is my story I mean this is my story
[26:00] I find myself in here and I can say this
[26:04] is my story
[26:06] it might be your story but this is my
[26:08] story and I prayed a night there we can
[26:12] just you can find yourself in there and
[26:15] find your story thank you mister
[26:17] musicians it's wonderful atmosphere
[26:20] that's so good to be in the house of the
[26:22] Lord just got a little thought for
[26:26] tonight and have you could put my
[26:30] slideshow up I didn't I don't really
[26:35] know what to call my message because it
[26:37] changed so much as I was thinking about
[26:39] it so I stuck with my original thought
[26:42] that I don't really kind of follow the
[26:44] theme that phrase got I love it when you
[26:47] go on a journey when you're reading the
[26:49] Bible so you go in your Bibles to first
[26:52] Corinthians 13 verse 8 and this is a
[26:57] scripture that I've taken deep note I've
[27:02] ever since we first become Christians
[27:04] and never really felt that I fully
[27:07] understood the context of the scripture
[27:09] and it's just one of those ones you know
[27:12] you just put on the side and one day the
[27:14] Lord will open it up to me in a slightly
[27:15] different way than maybe I've seen it
[27:17] before
[27:18] and so I was just following as leading
[27:20] so maybe it'll be a bit of a study
[27:23] denied that to see what the Lord's got
[27:25] for us
[27:26] 1st Corinthians 13:8 charity never
[27:30] faileth but whether there be prophecies
[27:33] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[27:36] they shall cease whether there be
[27:38] knowledge it shall vanish away for we
[27:41] know in part and we prophesy in part but
[27:43] when that which is perfect is come then
[27:46] that which is in part shall be done away
[27:48] up all stars and the next verse here
[27:51] he's adding a parable to this first so
[27:52] that would catch what he's saying when I
[27:55] was a child I spake as a child I
[27:57] understood as a child I thought as a
[27:59] child but when I became a man I put away
[28:01] childish things for now we see through a
[28:04] glass darkly
[28:05] but then face to face now I know in part
[28:08] but then I shall be known also even as
[28:12] also I am known
[28:14] let's just pray dear Heavenly Father
[28:18] lord I just pray father you just take
[28:20] this little little thought that I've put
[28:22] together Lord that you've put together
[28:24] Lord and just how Express it's of the
[28:26] people Lord for the servants just not
[28:29] you that's just not worthy Lord Jesus to
[28:31] bring forth your word Lord but just help
[28:33] us to get out of it out of the way Lord
[28:35] and just channel down Lord Jesus we want
[28:37] to hear from you tonight Lord we don't
[28:38] we're not here to hear from a man Lord
[28:40] Jesus father I just pray you take
[28:42] control of this service and I just say I
[28:45] love you Lord Jesus we thank you in
[28:48] Jesus name Amen
[28:49] can be seated so I just want to go
[28:55] through a few quotes because somebody
[28:58] asked brother Branham about this verse
[29:01] verse team in so I've I've got control
[29:11] and questions and answers please explain
[29:14] first Corinthians 13:8 212
[29:16] now that the perfect word is restored to
[29:19] the church are these verses fulfilled
[29:21] now I think I just went through that
[29:24] didn't I
[29:24] and when that which is a perfect has
[29:26] come that which is in part shall be done
[29:28] away with Paul said though I speak with
[29:31] tongues of men and angels and do all
[29:34] these things here but when that which is
[29:37] perfect is cut now as there anything
[29:41] perfect that God no sir as God the
[29:43] perfect and the beginning was the word
[29:46] and the Word was with God and the Word
[29:49] was God
[29:50] the words still God see all right when
[29:53] that which is perfect as can that which
[29:56] is impart has done away with and one
[29:59] thing that we tend to do and we
[30:02] shouldn't do a separate God in the word
[30:04] because God is his word and the word is
[30:06] God but often through just how we think
[30:10] as human beings it's easy to get next up
[30:13] and separate God in his word so he he
[30:17] was talking about this this verse a bit
[30:19] through this message but he had very
[30:20] broken up and so does a couple other
[30:23] places he talks about it I like how he
[30:25] says it
[30:26] Paul said though I speak with tongues of
[30:29] men and angels though I gave my body to
[30:31] be burned as sacrifice though I
[30:33] understand all the mysteries of the word
[30:35] though I give all my goods to the poor
[30:37] and all these things and have not
[30:40] charity I am still nothing I have faith
[30:42] that I can move mountains and so forth
[30:44] I'm still nothing been he said that
[30:48] which is in part shall be done away with
[30:50] when that which is perfect as come or
[30:52] when that which is perfect as made known
[30:55] now I've got a question on that I hope
[30:57] to get to tonight about what happened
[30:59] when the seals over and I think I'll get
[31:01] to that right here on this question so
[31:04] now he's saying when that which is
[31:06] perfect is made known now has has that
[31:10] which has the perfect Word of God being
[31:11] made known to the church amen that has
[31:14] been pick up one other spot he talks
[31:17] about it in this message first
[31:20] Corinthians 13 says this when there
[31:23] which is perfect
[31:23] has come that which is in part shall be
[31:25] done away with so all these little
[31:27] things of jumping up and down like a cat
[31:29] trying to talk in tongues and all these
[31:31] other things when that which is perfect
[31:33] and we do have today by God's help the
[31:37] perfect interpretation of the word with
[31:39] divine vindication then that witches
[31:42] impart has done away with when I was a
[31:45] child I spake as a child I understood as
[31:47] a child but when I became the man I put
[31:50] away childish things
[31:51] Amen I go to preaching and I don't get
[31:53] to these things so that which is perfect
[31:58] is come we've had the divine vindication
[32:01] revealed word come to us and you know
[32:05] people might say oh yes I see this in
[32:08] other people I don't see it I don't see
[32:10] it because this is something that takes
[32:11] place personally with you and if Jesus
[32:14] has come forth with a book and he's
[32:16] calling names and go praise God I heard
[32:19] him call my name someone else is I
[32:22] didn't hear him call your name him call
[32:24] your name what about when he came to
[32:25] Abraham and at this stage he comes and
[32:30] he calls an Abraham that Abraham was
[32:33] Abram he had just had his name changed
[32:35] but God knew his name was Abraham he was
[32:38] calling him by his new identity and so
[32:41] now when you hear the call when you hear
[32:43] God
[32:44] when you hear God calling you he doesn't
[32:47] call come and call you and say Andy
[32:49] cliff had come forth he reveals to you
[32:52] that your name's mrs. Jesus Christ when
[32:55] you hear him call your name this is
[32:56] Jesus Christ you feel him calling is
[33:00] making himself known to you personally
[33:04] because he's come forth to redeem those
[33:06] names that were written in the book and
[33:08] if he's come forth to a Dean ordered us
[33:10] to redeem that means to come and pick up
[33:13] something that was at a place somewhere
[33:16] to begin with and it got lost it somehow
[33:18] got separated from that original place
[33:20] and now he's going to redeem it back and
[33:23] bring it back to that place where it
[33:24] originally was so now he's only come to
[33:27] redeem those people that were originally
[33:30] there amen
[33:34] so he said in verse 9 for we know in
[33:37] part and we prophesy in part but when
[33:40] that which is perfect is come then that
[33:42] which is in part shall be done away with
[33:43] so that leaves us with a pretty serious
[33:46] question what what part is to be done
[33:48] away with
[33:49] if something's going to be done away
[33:51] with and we know with the opening of the
[33:55] word that we're now transitioning
[33:56] there's something taking place and under
[33:58] people because we have to be prepared
[34:00] for a body change so there's something
[34:02] taking place in this space of time that
[34:04] we're living in right now and I'm not
[34:08] very good at making up charts and I
[34:10] didn't want to plagiarize another
[34:11] minister so I sort of made a rough
[34:13] little chart but we know brother Branham
[34:16] taught that Jesus comes in three
[34:18] different sons names when he come and he
[34:20] was a prophet on earth he come in the
[34:23] name of the son of man he was a son of
[34:24] men he said who do they say I the son
[34:26] and their name and it was a prophetic
[34:28] ministry and then when he comes through
[34:30] the church ages as the Holy Ghost he was
[34:32] known as the son of God but then in the
[34:36] Millennium he comes as a son of David
[34:38] that's why the Jews must and because
[34:39] they were looking for the son of David
[34:41] they were looking for this King that was
[34:42] going to take over the world and role
[34:44] when they missed him because they were
[34:46] looking for son of David
[34:47] but we know revelation 10 7 what's
[34:50] happening as a son of man again was
[34:52] being revealed at the end time so he had
[34:54] to come back again as a son of man
[34:57] and something was happening in this
[34:58] transitioning time because when I can
[35:03] really see that so
[35:06] in 1963 when the word come open now the
[35:10] perfect interpretation of the word was
[35:12] coming made known to the church now you
[35:16] were responsible because when some links
[35:18] made no it's like a child when it when
[35:20] it's done something wrong it comes to a
[35:22] certain age and it knows that it's done
[35:24] something wrong now it becomes
[35:26] accountable and that's what's happening
[35:28] with the word that progressed and
[35:30] progressed through the Pentecostal age
[35:32] but it comes with a point in time where
[35:34] the word was fully made known and now
[35:37] the church has to become responsible for
[35:40] what's been revealed to the church
[35:44] because these are people that have been
[35:49] pulled out of Laodicea Laodicea church
[35:53] is not going in a rapture but he's
[35:56] pulling people out of the Laodicea
[35:58] Church to go into a rapture so now we
[36:01] find ourself in this you know brother
[36:03] Brannon use many tombs to express it but
[36:06] we were in this little breach of time
[36:07] between their church age period which
[36:10] was the church being led by man and the
[36:14] Millennium so brother Brennan said bride
[36:16] age astronaut age word age Eagle age all
[36:19] these different things this little space
[36:21] of time that the bride's getting ready
[36:25] and I find it interesting that brother
[36:28] Brandon when he's preaching the seals he
[36:30] takes the first six seals first six
[36:32] nights one after another the it's right
[36:35] that preaches the sixth seal and then he
[36:36] has a gap before he brings a seventh
[36:39] seal he brings questions and answers he
[36:41] would have thought the seventh seal
[36:42] would come straight on the seal of nine
[36:44] but he brings us get because he's a gap
[36:47] in God's great plan and then he brings a
[36:50] seventh co on the eighth night and you
[36:52] find the same thing in the book of in
[36:53] the book of Revelation through Chapter
[36:57] six first six seals all in a row then
[36:59] something else is taking place and
[37:01] Chapter seven there's a gap and then
[37:03] brings forth the seventh seal again in
[37:05] Chapter 8 we find ourselves in a small
[37:08] space of time where God has redeemed
[37:10] has chosen church out of layer to see it
[37:14] bringing her to a higher calling there's
[37:20] something taking place and if you're not
[37:22] paying attention you're missing what
[37:26] you've got to recognize is that the
[37:28] church has not been led by a man Church
[37:31] has been led by men for a long time
[37:33] thousands of years he's been led by men
[37:35] but we're not in that dispensation now
[37:38] we've been led by the Holy Ghost and
[37:41] that's why brother brother Branham was
[37:43] pointing us to Christ that's why he had
[37:44] to go off the scene just as John the
[37:46] Baptist said he must increase and I must
[37:49] decrease as a brother Brennan continued
[37:51] as ministry on people would have just
[37:53] kept following brother Branham oh you've
[37:56] got to stop looking at a man you're not
[38:01] going to be known by the church who
[38:02] attended when you were on earth you're
[38:04] not going to be known are you you know
[38:06] well if I just go to Shekinah Tabernacle
[38:09] you know I'll be safe so I would
[38:11] definitely make the rapture just won't
[38:14] work like that
[38:16] but we find that we're loving under an
[38:19] anointing bad and win ting that people
[38:22] feel that if they can just follow a
[38:24] certain ministry then they'll be saved
[38:28] you can come and follow brother bin but
[38:31] brother beans pointing you to Jesus
[38:33] Christ and if you only follow him and
[38:35] don't follow the one he's looking to it
[38:37] doesn't make any difference at all
[38:38] it doesn't matter how big the ministers
[38:46] putting on the whole armor of God just
[38:48] like the word in the beginning was
[38:50] spoken to us in the Garden of Eden
[38:52] spoken word and the second time was made
[38:55] flesh and dwelt among us and the third
[38:58] time that become a part of us when the
[39:00] Holy Ghost welling in us God coming into
[39:03] the man first spoke the word Adam the
[39:07] enemy tore it down then the word was
[39:09] made flesh Jesus and he was crucified
[39:12] but now I mean there's a difference in
[39:14] the word the word has become the church
[39:17] and the church as the word
[39:19] to God all that God was he poured into
[39:22] Christ all Christ was he poured into the
[39:25] church the Holy Ghost we've got to
[39:29] become one with this word we've got to
[39:32] become a part of it we've got to look
[39:33] into what we're going to put it on
[39:34] there's something different about this
[39:37] age than any other age we have a
[39:39] privilege that no other age has had you
[39:44] know brother Branham like talking about
[39:46] guns to explain things and so I like I
[39:50] just like this little example and maybe
[39:52] if you don't understand again you might
[39:54] not understand it but the gun has a
[39:56] breech in it so you can be walking
[39:58] around with this gun and it has a
[39:59] magazine and it's got seven bullets and
[40:02] that magazine and the bolts close
[40:04] because for this time of this church age
[40:06] period there's been a lid on on
[40:09] Revelation but it's and because Christ
[40:12] has come back to redeem our people when
[40:15] that bolt comes forward and the gun
[40:17] picks up a bullet that's sitting in that
[40:19] magazine and it pops it that bullet pops
[40:22] out of the magazine and it slides into
[40:24] the breech of the gun and now that gun
[40:27] that bolt goes down that bullet can't
[40:29] come out it's in a safe place and now
[40:31] that guns dangerous because all it would
[40:34] take is the pulling of that trigger and
[40:35] that that bullets going to leave the
[40:37] barrel but at the moment it's in the
[40:39] breech has been pulled up out of the
[40:42] church ages it's sitting there and it's
[40:43] loaded and it's ready to go and the
[40:45] moment and the twinkling of an eye when
[40:47] the master of that gun pulls that
[40:48] trigger gone and no one even knows but
[40:52] it's it's in a different place it's not
[40:54] studying with the other six even bullets
[40:57] here it's being pulled up out of it so
[41:00] now sitting in a higher place
[41:07] so I believe that we've come to this
[41:10] point in time where it's the ending of
[41:11] the church ages and God is pulling the
[41:14] church out sometimes it just feels like
[41:21] we're just everything's coming so much
[41:24] like and the curtain that separates us
[41:27] from this other dimension this this
[41:29] heaven you know it feels like it's just
[41:31] so thin that you could just climb
[41:34] through it and just dance around the
[41:37] throne and it's just so close but
[41:44] something has to be done away with God's
[41:47] not pulling a church pulling a people
[41:50] out there are just walking a partial
[41:53] walk with the Lord
[41:54] so this words been fully opened and it
[41:57] says and it says that Christ is not
[42:01] three different people and then you go
[42:03] oh I jumped just as much as you I shout
[42:05] just as much as you we pray for the
[42:07] second they get healed but you know we
[42:10] we see God's three gods it doesn't
[42:13] matter as partial revelation that's been
[42:15] done away with now in the Pentecostal
[42:17] age that was fine that was Pentecostal
[42:21] revelation God was pulling a church out
[42:24] of people that had a partial
[42:25] understanding of the word but now his
[42:28] word has been known and you're
[42:30] responsible for it you have to walk with
[42:34] God and that's why all these books won't
[42:37] work books are not gonna do it you know
[42:41] Irvine just lived by the co D book will
[42:44] be like this perfect message people and
[42:46] and we'll make it that won't do it you
[42:49] know you see so many books these days
[42:52] seven steps to seven steps to health
[42:55] seven steps of us I'm sure there's bound
[42:57] to be one Road and seven steps to a
[42:59] rapture but I can tell you right now
[43:01] that it's not going to work because this
[43:03] is something that's taking place between
[43:05] you and God personally yes only you know
[43:10] there's one book that you can read
[43:11] outside of the Bible and outside of the
[43:14] message there's one book that you can
[43:15] read
[43:16] will point you towards the rapture and
[43:18] that is it you you you are written
[43:21] epistles and men identification did you
[43:32] ever think he never wrote a book when he
[43:34] was on earth as far as we know he never
[43:36] wrote at one time that was on this sand
[43:39] then erased it out probably afterwards
[43:42] why didn't he write a word because he
[43:45] was the word see he left the word we
[43:49] don't need so many books when you become
[43:51] a written epistle of God see that's what
[43:54] God wants you to be images of him amen
[44:05] now that perfect word has come the only
[44:07] ones that are going to go on a rapture
[44:09] are the ones that become one with that
[44:11] perfect word so I want to read through a
[44:15] story and first kings and I've got it up
[44:17] on the slide so you don't have to turn
[44:19] there this was quite an amazing story
[44:22] when you begin to break it down and look
[44:23] at this I thought I made that bigger
[44:28] anyway
[44:31] then came there to woman that were
[44:34] harlots I considered this I thought you
[44:36] know before we become one with Christ we
[44:40] were acting as harlots - because we were
[44:42] a spouse to Christ but yet we were
[44:44] fornicating with the world but something
[44:46] changed but in this story there came two
[44:52] young woman that were harlots and to the
[44:55] King and stood before him and the one
[44:57] woman said oh my lord
[44:59] iron this woman dwell in one house and I
[45:02] was delivered of child with her in the
[45:04] house and it came to pass the third day
[45:06] after that I was delivered that this
[45:09] woman was delivered also then we were
[45:11] together there was no stranger with us
[45:13] in the house say if we - in the house
[45:16] now we find sometimes when this word
[45:19] comes to you well as birthing in you
[45:21] that's like a baby coming forth in you
[45:24] and sometimes it doesn't just come to
[45:27] you you know like when witness would
[45:28] come to me I was sitting in a house
[45:32] drunk stone ecstasy pee everything I was
[45:38] absolutely totally out of my mind at
[45:41] four o'clock in the morning and
[45:42] something played on TV and it showed
[45:44] God's creation at numbers - this wasted
[45:47] person at four o'clock in the morning
[45:48] that was an atheist and hated Christians
[45:50] now I was sitting there with my flatmate
[45:53] and something touched me and tears were
[45:56] streaming down my face and he saw he saw
[46:00] it too
[46:01] he saw it too we talked about it but
[46:04] something happened there was a reason
[46:06] something hated that the word didn't
[46:08] come forth in him he didn't nurse the
[46:14] word when a baby's coming forth it has
[46:16] to be nursed so it says here in verse 19
[46:21] and this woman's child died in the night
[46:24] because she overlaid it and the most
[46:27] dangerous time in your walk as when this
[46:29] child's being birthed than you now you
[46:31] can be you can be in the message Church
[46:34] for I don't hundred years not that you
[46:37] would have because it hasn't been open
[46:39] for a hundred years this trial when this
[46:41] child comes forth it can happen right
[46:43] now it could be happening tonight and it
[46:45] becomes a very dangerous time in your
[46:47] walk because Satan wants to come in and
[46:49] get that child Wallace young that's why
[46:52] we're doing this University work because
[46:53] that's where the devil wants to come in
[46:55] and gets those children why they're easy
[46:57] to manipulate but as a dangerous time
[47:01] and this woman she didn't care for her
[47:04] baby she didn't she wasn't aware of this
[47:07] child that she had and she just
[47:09] overlaid it and smother she didn't take
[47:13] it seriously and the other woman's are
[47:19] where am i sorry
[47:20] verse 20 and she arose at midnight and
[47:23] took my son from beside me while they
[47:26] had made sleep and laid it in her bosom
[47:28] and laid the D child in my bosom and
[47:30] when I rose in when I rose in the
[47:33] morning to give my child suck behold it
[47:35] was dead when I had considered it in the
[47:37] morning behold it was not my son which I
[47:39] did be so now we see this foolish woman
[47:43] that smothered the life out of her baby
[47:45] and you've seen it in this church where
[47:48] people have smothered the life out of a
[47:50] out of a booth that was coming forth and
[47:53] they ended up with a dead child and now
[47:56] they they found that they weren't
[47:58] satisfied with this dear child so now
[48:00] they come back to you go ahead my dear
[48:03] child honor take your live child so they
[48:05] come back in other semesters as a cult
[48:07] that's fake it's false and they want to
[48:09] give you the deed child and then you you
[48:14] you you pick up this what they're saying
[48:16] oh yeah well okay I consider it and then
[48:19] you've got this ditch hold and you go I
[48:21] consider as this is not my child this is
[48:25] not my child I had a living child take
[48:28] your dead child back I don't want your
[48:31] dead child and the other woman seen a
[48:37] but the living is my son and the deed is
[48:39] thy son and this said no but the deed is
[48:42] thy son and the living is my son thus
[48:44] they spake before the king and the King
[48:47] said the one saith this is my son that
[48:49] liveth and thy son is dead and the other
[48:51] saith neighbor thy son has did in my son
[48:54] is a living
[48:55] so now this is argument going on between
[48:58] these these two woman you know and we're
[49:01] never gonna win anybody over by arguing
[49:04] and fighting if someone can't accept the
[49:06] word and arguments not going to make
[49:08] them accept the word but there is
[49:11] something that will that will tell
[49:14] what's true I think God this something
[49:17] that will tell what's true and I like
[49:20] this okay that wasn't all supposed to
[49:23] come that bore 24 and the King said
[49:26] bring me a sword and they brought a
[49:28] sword before the King because there's a
[49:30] sword that came down in this age into
[49:32] the hand of a prophet and that sword
[49:35] will now tell which was true the sword
[49:39] hallelujah the Kings sword as quicken it
[49:44] sharp and it will get to the bottom of
[49:46] any problem we have today
[49:49] verse 25 and the King said divide the
[49:52] living child and two and give half to
[49:54] the one and half to the other be inspect
[49:57] the woman who's the living child was
[49:59] unto the king for a bowels ye and upon
[50:01] her son and she said o my lord
[50:04] give her the living child and a know why
[50:06] Slayer but the other said let it be
[50:08] neither mine nor thine but divided the
[50:11] king answered and said get through the
[50:13] living child and no wife Slayer she's
[50:15] the mother there off this bride's not
[50:17] going to take a half slain job I'm not
[50:19] going to take half a revelation I'm not
[50:21] going to take partial word either give
[50:25] me the full revelation of Jesus Christ
[50:27] or give me nothing but don't slay the
[50:30] word problem is these people that are
[50:34] willing to take a better brother means
[50:36] brother and Brennan's message here but
[50:38] you know I don't like the whole skirts
[50:40] thing you know but but when He healed
[50:42] the sick that was pretty good you're
[50:44] just having a slain child you're willing
[50:47] to have your child cut in half no sir
[50:52] I'm not happy with 1/2 cut up child it's
[50:59] too many people that even now will stand
[51:02] and preach this message but they're too
[51:03] cowardly to preach the truth we've got
[51:06] to stand forth with this message and
[51:07] bring it forth in its purity you can't
[51:13] get by by a passage message and the
[51:18] message that martin luther brought of
[51:20] justification that was a right for
[51:22] Luther's age that's as far as a twin
[51:24] sanctification was flown in Wesley's
[51:26] ages as far as a twin then we come into
[51:29] the Pentecostal age and the restoration
[51:31] of the gifts a very fine thing that was
[51:33] fine in the age but we're going beyond
[51:36] that now we are beyond that just as sure
[51:38] as there as a world we've gotta come
[51:40] beyond this thing because we have done
[51:42] the same thing that they did with it
[51:44] before make an idol out of it I belong
[51:47] to this church I belong to this order of
[51:48] it that order of it God will send
[51:51] somebody that will smash that thing and
[51:53] tear it to pieces and confirm his word
[51:55] the forward praise be to God now we see
[51:58] that that is true God rich in His mercy
[52:02] so God has made away God has made away
[52:05] for you to go in the rapture even though
[52:08] this partial revelations going to be
[52:10] done away with he's made away he never
[52:12] left his people without a way and he's
[52:14] never going to leave you without a way
[52:21] if there's one thing we need to
[52:23] recognize is that the pillar of fire
[52:26] that appeared and the desert the pillar
[52:28] of fire that appeared in brother
[52:30] branham's ministry it appears here in
[52:32] every single service and it's more than
[52:35] able to lead this church it's more than
[52:37] able to lead you you know so often we
[52:46] judge a man by his stature and a
[52:48] preacher you know I find it funny you
[52:52] know we can get so caught up in the way
[52:54] someone preaches you know I hope in your
[52:56] brother nd doesn't learn but you can
[52:57] watch brother end in you then they must
[53:02] have to replace the carpet in that
[53:03] church you know you miss the whole point
[53:07] of what the ministers saying I love the
[53:09] way that brother bang can get every one
[53:11] fired up now I love it too but you at
[53:14] that's all that you take out of the
[53:15] service you miss it you must see because
[53:19] God can speak through on us and tell he
[53:23] can tell anybody you know he does
[53:25] doesn't it God does not favor a man the
[53:31] greatest move of God that comes since
[53:33] Jesus Christ come through a little poor
[53:36] ragged little Kentucky boy biggest move
[53:40] don't look at the vessel its vessel has
[53:43] nothing to do with it
[53:44] but it's an man's nature to want some
[53:48] big respectable giant the guy with the
[53:52] biggest name just go to the biggest
[53:54] church that'll do it's not going to work
[53:57] it's the same thing that Azrael wanted
[53:59] it's what kept them out of the promised
[54:00] land you know Oh Moses you're not the
[54:03] only Holy One in Israel Oh what if we
[54:06] just have a if we just have a law if we
[54:09] just have the you know if we just take
[54:10] the co D book if we just have the law
[54:12] that'll do
[54:13] no I know and we're not happy with that
[54:15] or there'll be another men you know and
[54:18] we'll let search out the best man it
[54:20] doesn't matter look to the pillar of
[54:22] fire be a blessing or else only a couple
[54:27] of days away and then mercy a blessing
[54:29] for all that time forty years I don't
[54:33] want us to join in the desert but you
[54:38] know when someone's been in bondage for
[54:40] so long it's very hard to break free and
[54:45] I often I really like the story that
[54:49] brother Brennan told about the eagle he
[54:53] goes to the zoo and he sees this eagle
[54:55] locked in a cage and it disgusts him
[54:58] because he's a man of the wilderness and
[54:59] he likes to see things free he likes to
[55:02] see nature and its freedom and he goes
[55:05] to the zoo and this Eagles in there and
[55:07] this Eagles a heavenly bird it's not
[55:09] it's not supposed to be locked up and
[55:11] it's beating its head against the cage
[55:14] and us that's probably breaking its beak
[55:16] on there on the wires and scratching its
[55:19] claws up in its unhappy then it's
[55:22] bleeding and he just he can't be the
[55:26] thought of us Eagle in this cage and
[55:28] it's doing something in and he's getting
[55:30] upset he said he said have I had had a
[55:36] had the money I would have just paid the
[55:38] zoo to let me take take that Eagle away
[55:41] and it's so true not just in that we've
[55:43] seen it even we had a dog and then that
[55:46] dog grew up going for long walks
[55:49] I used to bike whether I think a living
[55:52] Ches every morning and then we moved out
[55:54] to the farm and he had the roam of the
[55:56] whole farm
[55:57] and it was just a happy happy dog but
[55:59] then we moved into a little Township and
[56:01] in a rental and he couldn't be inside
[56:04] then he had to be in a cage and through
[56:07] the summer that's all right because you
[56:09] go for lots of walks but then in the
[56:11] winter and it's dark and it's cold and
[56:13] the first winter you know it started to
[56:15] change his character as countenance just
[56:18] started to go a bit down and and that's
[56:20] what happens to a man you know when he's
[56:22] just been in a locked up for a bit long
[56:24] you know he used to be free but it's
[56:26] just a spirit come in or something and
[56:28] it's just started to sort of close them
[56:30] in a little button and it just started a
[56:32] Rob a bit of that joy coming forth and
[56:34] then the next summer year that was all
[56:36] right and we come to that next winter
[56:38] we're coming of a fair way through that
[56:40] winter and he's getting a bit unhappy we
[56:42] know he's unhappy and the next thing we
[56:44] hear this horrible noise that neither of
[56:46] us will either want to hear again and
[56:47] he's something snaps because he's been
[56:50] locked up for too long and he's trying
[56:52] to chew his way out of steel bars all
[56:55] the teeth are gone just just completely
[56:57] lost it because it's just what happens
[57:00] to a man and then you go oh I've just
[57:03] been there's no victory in your life you
[57:05] come to a place where you're so locked
[57:07] up so bound and there's just no joy in
[57:10] your life because you've been so bound
[57:12] up by the enemy and it's sad that's a
[57:14] very very sad space to be in brother
[57:18] branham see there's only one thing I've
[57:19] seen that sadder than that Eagle locked
[57:21] in that cage and it's to see a man
[57:23] locked up and bound up he tells us other
[57:30] story about Johnny crow
[57:33] he said Johnny crow you know he had been
[57:36] tied with a little cord around his leg
[57:38] for a long long time and all the other
[57:41] birds would fly down and that eat some
[57:43] grain with Johnny crow and then and he'd
[57:45] be happy he'd eat grain with him but
[57:47] then that all fly off and he'd go and he
[57:49] he couldn't go because his foot was tied
[57:53] and this went on for quite a long time
[57:56] and then after a while someone come in
[57:58] there and they cut that little clip off
[58:00] his leg they said Johnny the words open
[58:04] the seals have been broken you can go
[58:08] free Johnny
[58:10] well I don't know how and then all those
[58:15] other crows they fly away kin and I
[58:18] don't know how to go free I've been
[58:21] locked up for so long I don't know how
[58:22] to go free but little Johnny or C look
[58:26] he's standing on the edge there all he
[58:28] needs to do is take a ste take a step of
[58:30] faith and sometimes that's what it takes
[58:32] when you know there's something there
[58:34] but it just takes a step of faith you
[58:36] have to and you have to take that step
[58:38] of faith brother Andy's not going to
[58:40] take that step of faith for you he might
[58:42] pray for you but you yourself have to
[58:45] set your wings and fly we have to look
[58:53] forward beyond the Curt and this is
[58:54] where I'm getting to we have to look
[58:56] beyond what these eyes see naturally the
[59:00] pillar of fire is here to leave us the
[59:04] days of church revivals are done these
[59:07] big campaigns are off we just have
[59:08] another healing campaign like brother
[59:10] Brennan we're not going to that those
[59:12] days are over
[59:13] they're done the revival what the
[59:14] Pentecostal revival was over so now we
[59:18] can be guilty of thinking well there's
[59:21] got to be people here to be better still
[59:23] seed in Wellington you believe that I
[59:25] believe they're still sedum that will be
[59:28] sitting in these pews soon that's in
[59:30] Wellington now natural carnal man
[59:35] thinking let's have a big campaign we'll
[59:38] have a big convention right heaps of
[59:40] tracks and we're going to reach like
[59:43] we'll go sit up on the on the right at
[59:45] the waterfront down there in Wellington
[59:47] where the most people come through and
[59:48] we'll reach out to 20,000 people and
[59:52] we'll spread out that's man's thinking
[59:54] what are the chances that person that
[59:57] should be sitting in that seat right now
[59:59] wants to have anything to do with a
[1:00:01] message right now he probably wouldn't
[1:00:04] take a tract have you forced it to so
[1:00:07] that way of thinking is not what's going
[1:00:09] to bring the seed and then the in days
[1:00:11] but the sons of God are led by the
[1:00:13] Spirit of God and he can lead you
[1:00:15] directly to that person but we just
[1:00:19] become like a mule you know like
[1:00:21] Revelation comes to a mule no need to
[1:00:22] slide
[1:00:23] mmm yep yep but that mule will go out
[1:00:27] and or do twice that twice the work of
[1:00:30] the horse but we can become like a
[1:00:33] message mule just trying to do works to
[1:00:35] get people in the kingdom but we know
[1:00:37] who our Father is and we can say father
[1:00:40] where's that seed and then he can lead
[1:00:42] that horse he can lead you straight to
[1:00:44] where straight to where those seeds are
[1:00:48] you know you know why this work that's
[1:00:50] word coming open it brought us into a
[1:00:52] place to replace a place where we can
[1:00:55] rejoice it doesn't come to bring us into
[1:00:57] a place like say the Jehovah's Witness
[1:01:00] and you've got to go out of witness to
[1:01:01] so many people and do works that's not
[1:01:03] what the Holy Ghost came where he came
[1:01:05] to bring rest and he wants you to rest
[1:01:08] enter into his rest amen don't lead to
[1:01:18] that lean to that carnality you just you
[1:01:20] become like a man beholding his natural
[1:01:23] face in a glass and a mirror as we could
[1:01:26] say looking at me no hope brother Isaac
[1:01:34] trying to say this but he's already
[1:01:37] mentioned about a movie thing already
[1:01:40] then when I first heard this I thought
[1:01:43] no doubt brother and I shared it with me
[1:01:45] but a long time ago I thought you know
[1:01:48] that sounds like a lot of money a lot of
[1:01:51] effort what's the point you know just
[1:01:53] natural carnal man thinking you know
[1:01:55] that seems a bit over the top you know
[1:01:58] but as I begin to actually see the
[1:02:02] vision that's the problem we judge
[1:02:05] people before we understand someone we
[1:02:07] shouldn't do that we should give someone
[1:02:09] grace and the benefit of the doubt but
[1:02:13] you know if there are anything we
[1:02:16] sometimes think the only thing that
[1:02:17] we've got to do on this earth has find
[1:02:19] that last seat and we can go but there's
[1:02:20] something else that's taking place
[1:02:22] because there's lost souls that have to
[1:02:24] hear this word and that movie may just
[1:02:27] be a part of that vision where people
[1:02:30] were going to hear what the prophet that
[1:02:31] they're going to hear about a ministry
[1:02:34] we shouldn't be so quick to judge
[1:02:42] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:02:45] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:02:47] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:02:49] childish things so Paul's using as a
[1:02:54] parable the stature of a perfect man and
[1:02:58] I believe we're living in an age where
[1:03:00] we come to the full adoption we're
[1:03:03] coming to the fullness of what God has
[1:03:05] given to us we're not down somewhere in
[1:03:07] the feet not down somewhere in the
[1:03:10] leagues but we've come right to the head
[1:03:11] to the capstone and Christ is capping
[1:03:14] the church for now we see through a
[1:03:22] glass darkly so Paul's talking about his
[1:03:24] dispensation when I was a child for for
[1:03:28] now we see through a glass darkly
[1:03:30] but then when but then when when he
[1:03:35] becomes men but then we see then face to
[1:03:39] face now I know in part but then shall I
[1:03:42] know even as also I am known
[1:03:45] now that just gets me a little bit
[1:03:47] excited because I want to come back to
[1:03:50] know what on how I'm known because
[1:03:52] there's a picture of me that when I look
[1:03:55] in a natural mirror and I see that image
[1:03:57] that's not me that's that's not me my
[1:04:01] image is beyond that and it's something
[1:04:04] far more glorious than that and I want
[1:04:08] to see that I want to see their image
[1:04:10] because you know when I can see that
[1:04:12] image then I can truly say I'm a chosen
[1:04:16] generation called forth the show has
[1:04:19] excellence all that I require for life
[1:04:22] God has given me not a Maserati and a
[1:04:25] super yacht amen not a million dollars
[1:04:29] and a bunch of Max Factor that's not
[1:04:31] what I require for life he's given me
[1:04:33] the Holy Ghost and I know who I am and I
[1:04:37] know who God says I am and what he says
[1:04:39] I am amen praise God when you can behold
[1:04:44] their image when you can see their image
[1:04:47] of yourself
[1:04:49] then you will be able to say I can
[1:04:51] overcome why can I overcome because I
[1:04:55] see their image there I've already
[1:04:57] overcome
[1:04:57] I've already overcome what do you mean
[1:05:00] oh I'm you're struggling I'm not
[1:05:02] struggling like this is the image of me
[1:05:03] I'm not struggling I'm not sick I'm
[1:05:06] already healed hallelujah that image
[1:05:11] will change you I like that photo that's
[1:05:22] not what I was looking for though
[1:05:24] identification now he was God's Word
[1:05:29] expressed and he said now if you can
[1:05:32] believe me see it believe the works that
[1:05:34] I do search the Scriptures for in them
[1:05:36] you think you have eternal life and
[1:05:38] that's the very thing that tells Who I
[1:05:40] am oh I wonder if see that's the one who
[1:05:43] sees Who I am the Scriptures tell who I
[1:05:46] am and let me take that a little further
[1:05:49] will you the Scriptures is what tells
[1:05:51] what you are that expresses you and me
[1:05:54] and expresses me the Scriptures tell
[1:05:56] what we are that's so loud that our
[1:05:59] voice cannot even be heard our life
[1:06:02] speaks louder than our voice and it's
[1:06:04] God's way of letting us see what we are
[1:06:07] amen
[1:06:08] we need to behold a different image than
[1:06:11] the image we see in the mirror you know
[1:06:14] brother Phil was telling me something
[1:06:16] last week and I was like
[1:06:18] praise God if you knew what I was
[1:06:19] planning on preaching on you you would
[1:06:22] understand this so he's telling me you
[1:06:24] know he's been on a CC as it I flavor
[1:06:26] this foot and he broke his foot a while
[1:06:29] ago and now the image of his leg is not
[1:06:31] what it used to be it doesn't look that
[1:06:34] like it should do so he told me what I
[1:06:37] do is I take another mirror and I set
[1:06:40] that mirror there next to my leg and
[1:06:42] then I look at that mirror and I see the
[1:06:45] image of my other leg and then I just
[1:06:48] sit there and I look at that and it's
[1:06:49] wrecking my brain and to seeing the
[1:06:51] image of my good league I don't see a
[1:06:54] bang league when I look at it I see a
[1:06:55] good league because I'm looking at the
[1:06:57] image of the sleep if you can do the
[1:06:59] same thing with the word
[1:07:01] it will change these atoms amen if
[1:07:03] you're sick and you can look into this
[1:07:06] word for so long I don't see the
[1:07:08] sickness I see what the scripture says
[1:07:10] about my sickness I will change you it
[1:07:13] will do something hallelujah I love that
[1:07:18] song but Andy wrote and sung and Men
[1:07:21] when you were singing it I'll say he's I
[1:07:23] said to him I got a quote that you'll
[1:07:25] like now back in the Philadelphian age
[1:07:29] the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh
[1:07:32] what great loved that age manifested for
[1:07:35] him it reminds me of those beautiful
[1:07:38] words of first Peter 1:8 whom having not
[1:07:41] seen you love and whom though now you
[1:07:44] see him not yet believing he rejoice
[1:07:47] with joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:07:50] with him we rejoice also we haven't seen
[1:07:53] him but we have felt we know him as much
[1:07:56] as our limiting senses can lead us but
[1:07:59] one day it will be face to face that is
[1:08:02] for this age he's coming at the end of
[1:08:04] this age partial realizations will be
[1:08:07] made perfect realization complete
[1:08:09] realization hallelujah we've been
[1:08:12] looking through a glass darkly but soon
[1:08:14] that will be face to face we've been
[1:08:16] going from glory to glory but soon we'll
[1:08:19] be right in the glory and in his glory
[1:08:21] will shine we shall be like him
[1:08:23] wondrously like him Jesus our Savior
[1:08:25] divine isn't that wonderful we're
[1:08:27] completing him that is true he would not
[1:08:30] lie to us about that you know praise God
[1:08:32] I believe that's what that's really
[1:08:34] where we are we have a perfect
[1:08:36] realization of this word but what I like
[1:08:38] what he says here but one day we will be
[1:08:41] changed in the atoms we will put on
[1:08:43] immortality we will be all swallowed up
[1:08:46] in life then we will realize realization
[1:08:50] hallelujah no we can sing and shout now
[1:08:52] like we're dancing around the throne our
[1:08:54] heavens coming down I feel it and all
[1:08:56] this but one day we're actually going to
[1:08:58] realize what we realize now hallelujah
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:05] you know hot I'm gonna realize though I
[1:09:08] confessed my foot was healed and I
[1:09:10] confessed are gonna get there and I
[1:09:12] realized my foots healed though I
[1:09:14] confessed on earth that my diabetes was
[1:09:17] gone I'm gonna get there and I realize
[1:09:19] that was never there to begin with
[1:09:22] though I confess to Jesus all my sins
[1:09:25] are gone and I get there I'm gonna
[1:09:27] realize I never had any sin in the first
[1:09:29] place
[1:09:30] hallelujah and then how can anybody sit
[1:09:35] here and condemn us and tell us to sit
[1:09:37] down and be quiet condemn you of emotion

[1:09:51] bubbling inside of me that's not me what

[1:10:08] Canaan's Len they came back and they
[1:10:14] said yep there's a land their land land
[1:10:18] was promised to us but there's like
[1:10:21] these giant sea it is you know such and
[1:10:24] such preacher with such a big name and
[1:10:26] he said that it's this way and he said
[1:10:29] that we can't take the land just yet we
[1:10:31] just have to wait a while and there's
[1:10:34] such and such a church here and then
[1:10:35] they do they don't agree with this one
[1:10:37] but they say that we need to do this or
[1:10:39] such-and-such
[1:10:40] I praise God that there were two young
[1:10:43] men near that said well oh you guys saw

[1:11:21] it's not going to work I'm gonna shout
[1:11:23] and say hit me in anyway you know I was
[1:11:26] laughing about it I was thinking about
[1:11:27] that woman brother Brennan was telling a
[1:11:29] story and some some young girl that got
[1:11:33] married and was going to this her
[1:11:35] husband's Church some maybe Methodist
[1:11:38] Church and mum had been reading the
[1:11:41] Bible quite a button she was seeing
[1:11:43] yourself in those scriptures and the
[1:11:45] preacher said something well Jesus is
[1:11:49] God but you guys hallelujah amen
[1:11:52] you know what happened every Nick in
[1:11:54] that church went there goes brother Andy
[1:12:00] again something was taking place because
[1:12:04] she found herself and this word and when
[1:12:07] you find yourself in this word there'll
[1:12:09] be something and you just go I just
[1:12:11] can't I just can't hold it end is
[1:12:14] something that's been expressed and I
[1:12:16] can't stop it it's bubbling hallelujah
[1:12:23] when I look into that word and I look
[1:12:27] not at their natural image that I see it
[1:12:29] in the mirror in the glass and I'm not
[1:12:31] looking directly but looking face to
[1:12:33] face I see a glorious church without
[1:12:36] spot or wrinkle she's dancing she's
[1:12:39] singing blessing and honor and praise
[1:12:41] and she's rejoicing around the throne I
[1:12:44] don't see a trodden down cassock Church
[1:12:46] their image is not there what do you see
[1:12:52] you know we've come too far to turn back
[1:12:55] we've come too far in this journey with
[1:12:58] God to turn there
[1:13:00] and you know what happens if you turn
[1:13:02] back you turn into a pillar of salt
[1:13:05] right and you know what salt does it
[1:13:07] draws all the life out of you and I want
[1:13:10] to dehydrate my fishing bait so it'll
[1:13:13] it'll preserve it won't change at all
[1:13:15] anymore I cover it in salt and it sucks
[1:13:18] all the moisture sucks all the life out
[1:13:19] of it and then it just stays stagnant
[1:13:21] that's a bit of Bates finish it's just
[1:13:23] going to stay there never turn back
[1:13:25] we've got to keep pressing for there's
[1:13:27] no where else are you going to go
[1:13:30] you know like brother Ben was saying to
[1:13:32] me when when these people come at you
[1:13:34] and they say the message is false yeah
[1:13:36] oh yeah so what have you got for me
[1:13:38] that's better what have you got that's
[1:13:41] going to lead me any further with Christ
[1:13:43] because this message regardless I'm
[1:13:46] following Christ and I want to follow
[1:13:48] him closer every every day day by day so
[1:13:51] you bring me something that'll lead me
[1:13:53] closer to my Savior
[1:13:55] I'll follow you but until you do that
[1:13:58] I'm gonna stick with this because this
[1:13:59] is serving me pretty good at the moment
[1:14:04] amen that's what happened to people when
[1:14:10] they leave this message they turn into a
[1:14:12] pillar of salt
[1:14:13] they turned back and it just draws all
[1:14:14] the life out of you
[1:14:16] I wasn't gonna go to this but I couldn't
[1:14:21] seem to get it out of my nose
[1:14:23] for it is impossible for those who were
[1:14:25] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:14:27] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:14:29] the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the
[1:14:32] good Word of God and the powers of the
[1:14:34] world to come if they should fall away
[1:14:36] to renew again unto repentance seeing
[1:14:38] they crucify themselves the Son of God
[1:14:41] afresh and put him to an open shame if
[1:14:44] there's one thing that I do not want to
[1:14:46] be guilty of on this day it is
[1:14:48] crucifying Jesus Christ for the second
[1:14:50] time it was not a nice thing when he had
[1:14:53] to be crucified the first time now he's
[1:14:55] come forth to redeem of people he's hid
[1:14:58] his own blood ease and the whole
[1:15:00] everything coming to an end and his
[1:15:02] words open and then people were still
[1:15:04] willing to crucify him they don't feel
[1:15:06] that they need him I don't want to be
[1:15:08] guilty of that
[1:15:15] you know what happens people come into
[1:15:20] the message and they sweep this house by
[1:15:24] good works you know they just see the
[1:15:26] doctrine or you know I've come the pants
[1:15:29] and Longos here and they just start
[1:15:32] doing the works that outward works but
[1:15:34] they don't let Christ come in and be
[1:15:36] king of your life so what happens that
[1:15:39] devil that you swept out by works he
[1:15:42] goes and finds seven friends and he
[1:15:44] comes back in and because you don't let
[1:15:46] Jesus become king of your life to rule
[1:15:48] and lead you then that Devil comes back
[1:15:51] with more Devils and then it's even
[1:15:52] harder than it was in the first place
[1:15:55] we've got to protect this vessel while
[1:15:58] we're on earth because this part of our
[1:16:00] journey this this man this this part has
[1:16:03] not converted you that's still subject
[1:16:05] to Laodicea though my soul has already
[1:16:08] taken a rapture and has sitting in
[1:16:10] heavenly places with Christ this guy
[1:16:12] this silly silly guy is still subject
[1:16:16] still subject to Laodicea and we've got
[1:16:18] to watch it at every point because it
[1:16:20] will deceive you you know what that is a

[1:37:13] the truth
[1:37:16] [Music]
[1:37:34] what he says
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:42] [Music]
[1:38:50] and you walk in each flight a favor that
[1:38:52] means you walk where he wants you to be
[1:38:54] okay I may never do that amen
[1:38:58] I'll tell you a testimony before we go
[1:39:00] if you can play it with softly in the
[1:39:03] background because it's true so when God
[1:39:06] takes you on a journey sometimes he
[1:39:08] wants to see how far you can go
[1:39:10] and how much you trust him okay so if
[1:39:14] you just trust him because you get
[1:39:15] something from him that's a wrong
[1:39:17] relationship that's a child wanting a
[1:39:19] suite from a dad and if he doesn't get
[1:39:22] his suite he's upset so God said to us
[1:39:27] to to keep on just pressing on and he
[1:39:30] puts us outside of our house and he puts
[1:39:32] us in a situation where we don't always
[1:39:35] feel comfortable because you're out of
[1:39:37] your comfort zone but see your
[1:39:40] confession the things that you say that
[1:39:42] comes out of your mouth is what God
[1:39:44] listens to okay so sometimes it might
[1:39:48] not go well in here but just speak out
[1:39:50] here confess that all as well God as
[1:39:54] house for me I will get my place in his
[1:39:57] time
[1:39:57] not in my time days the song and his
[1:39:59] time is in there do we have that in his
[1:40:01] time I think we should put that one up
[1:40:03] because if I was looking at the favor
[1:40:06] and in all the things that God gave me I
[1:40:09] would have missed this whole thing and a
[1:40:11] warrant of her trust and love and
[1:40:13] patience and meekness and kindness and
[1:40:16] all those things so remember when God
[1:40:17] sits a promise before you and it doesn't
[1:40:20] happen right then we've been out of a
[1:40:23] house for a month enough now isn't it
[1:40:25] but a month in the house
[1:40:27] all our stuff packed in storage and God
[1:40:30] said he'll give a house for us and you
[1:40:32] know what he doesn't fail anything okay
[1:40:34] and even gives us better than we
[1:40:37] expected
[1:40:38] okay because all we did is say Lord I
[1:40:40] don't know how this is going to happen
[1:40:42] we had five no six knows basically and
[1:40:45] the more the harder we tried to do
[1:40:47] applications the more he said no so we
[1:40:49] didn't know why but you know what God
[1:40:52] had a house for us so we just keep
[1:40:54] walking and brother nd God bless you for
[1:40:56] you guys are just always just think you
[1:40:59] guys are really well and everyone thank
[1:41:00] you so much and I run the Christian in
[1:41:03] the open the house for us everyone here
[1:41:05] you know that's what we have is real
[1:41:07] it's not fake this love ye and
[1:41:09] everything we have is is real okay so if
[1:41:11] you don't get your your your gift right
[1:41:15] now or your prayer right now don't worry
[1:41:18] about the favor just keep walking in his
[1:41:20] world that is God's favor for you okay
[1:41:23] so if you sing that song again and you
[1:41:25] come to the favor part just remember
[1:41:27] that's God's will not your world
[1:41:29] okay I mean I think the world betrays
[1:41:31] that song so really bad how do we start
[1:41:35] this one brother Isaac
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:41] amen
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:48] that's it
