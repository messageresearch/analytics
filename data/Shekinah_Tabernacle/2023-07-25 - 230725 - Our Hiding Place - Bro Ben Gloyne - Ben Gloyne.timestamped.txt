[27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may have your
[27:45] seats tonight. So, I want to speak about
[27:47] this. Uh just just take this little
[27:49] thought here. Um he is our hiding place.
[27:53] Now, this photo here, I don't know if
[27:55] you can see it. I'll put in the
[27:56] background. This is So, this is um I
[27:58] don't know if you've heard of Cory
[28:00] Tenboon. Uh you know, in World War II,
[28:02] they um upstairs in their uh in their
[28:05] house in the Netherlands, I believe it
[28:06] was. They they they they made a false uh
[28:09] you know a false uh room or what do you
[28:11] call it like a hidden room so they could
[28:13] hide Jews uh you know from the Nazis and
[28:16] they saved hundreds of Jews from this
[28:18] hiding place. Now they um cut the wall
[28:20] out. It's now a museum. You can go see
[28:22] it but but the um down the bottom left
[28:24] there below where those sheets are
[28:26] stacked was actually the entrance into
[28:28] the hiding place. But they just cut the
[28:29] wall out there just to show you it. It
[28:31] was just about a room. You could about
[28:32] six people could stand there. But they
[28:35] hid many Jews. It was a hiding place
[28:38] that life would be saved. And I just
[28:40] want to take that little thought and
[28:41] take it into the spiritual now there
[28:43] where where where we have a great hiding
[28:45] place. Amen. That this this hiding place
[28:48] that we have, nothing can touch it. No
[28:51] technology of the devil can touch it.
[28:53] Nothing he can do can get into our
[28:55] hiding place. We know that hiding place
[28:56] is Christ, right? If you're in Christ,
[28:58] you're in the hiding place. And you
[29:00] know, it's like, you know, we just had
[29:01] that recent uh, you know, recent war,
[29:03] you could say, of Israel bombing Iran
[29:05] and then the Americans tagged in and
[29:06] they cuz they had the stealth bombers to
[29:08] use those bunker buster bombs to get in
[29:10] and try and destroy the Iranian nuclear
[29:13] uh, facilities and so on. I'll tell you
[29:15] what, they may be able to man may able
[29:18] to develop a bomb that can go through
[29:20] concrete and go through reinforcing, but
[29:22] there's nothing in existence or can be
[29:25] made
[29:27] of the devil's armory that can get into
[29:30] this hiding place.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; There's nothing. Amen. So, I pray that
[29:34] we could we could just just appreciate
[29:36] we're hidden.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our lives are hidden Christ. Amen.
[29:40] that we could really appreciate this
[29:42] because you know if we could think you
[29:44] know the Lord has fortified us behind
[29:45] the greatest reinforcing defense that is
[29:49] in existence you know you can't find
[29:51] anything greater you'll never will in in
[29:53] any dimension right so we are hidden we
[29:56] are hidden in this hiding place now when
[29:59] it speaks about that thou shalt compass
[30:01] about with songs of deliverance it
[30:03] speaks that that word songs of
[30:05] deliverance is escape
[30:07] so this hiding place where we are
[30:09] preserved from trouble trouble and we we
[30:11] know that this is a day of trouble like
[30:13] there's never been upon the earth as
[30:15] tribulation uh conditions are coming in
[30:17] pre-tribulation time is here it's a time
[30:20] of trouble but when David would be
[30:22] inspired to write this psalm I believe
[30:23] that he was speaking of this day he says
[30:26] that thou shalt you are my hiding place
[30:28] and you shall preserve me from trouble
[30:31] that that trouble can't come into our
[30:33] souls unbelief can't rain it's faith
[30:35] that takes control amen and what does he
[30:37] do he compasses us about with songs of
[30:40] deliverance. It's not songs of judgment
[30:42] or wrath or destruction. No, it's
[30:44] deliverance. Amen. If you listen to the
[30:46] message, amen, what you know what's a
[30:48] common thread that you hear through it?
[30:49] You're getting out of here. I'm going to
[30:51] catch a bride away. You're not here
[30:53] alone in this life. Amen. You're not
[30:55] just trudging along trying to find your
[30:56] way and following some blind religion.
[30:58] But no, the Lord is neither. Amen. He's
[31:00] present. He's a present help in time of
[31:02] trouble. Amen. He's not far from any one
[31:04] of us. He's closer than your next
[31:06] breath. And he's come to snatch you out
[31:08] of this trouble. Amen. So, so you know,
[31:10] he compasses about with songs of escape.
[31:13] You're going to get out of this.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be in a trial right now.
[31:16] You're going to get out of it. Amen.
[31:18] There's escape that's been spoken. Amen.
[31:20] You got to realize that God is God is,
[31:22] you know, it's more than just a nice
[31:23] idea. No, he can passes about with songs
[31:25] of escape.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; He is the way of escape. Amen. He's the
[31:28] way out of every temptation and trouble,
[31:30] but we just need to look for him in the
[31:33] trial.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; But praise the Lord. He doesn't he
[31:35] doesn't he never compasses his people
[31:38] about with songs of it's a dead end for
[31:40] you. God is not a God of dead ends.
[31:43] Amen. No, he's a way of escape. He
[31:45] always is. You look through the Bible,
[31:47] every every trial the believer went
[31:49] into, there was a exit door. Amen. And
[31:51] in God's time, he opened that door and
[31:53] they stepped out. Amen. So, same thing
[31:55] with us. Even you could say for the
[31:57] believer, the death, death is actually
[31:59] an exit door. It takes us to the
[32:01] presence of God. Amen. But we we know
[32:04] that there's nothing can take our lives
[32:06] until God is finished with with us upon
[32:08] the earth. We are here to fulfill a
[32:11] purpose and nothing the devil can do can
[32:13] take us from this world until our
[32:15] purpose is fulfilled. Amen. So if we've
[32:17] got life in our bodies tonight, we got
[32:19] to realize we've got a purpose to
[32:20] fulfill and God is determined that that
[32:23] purpose is done. So we might as well
[32:24] surrender and say, "Lord, use me for
[32:26] your purpose." Amen. So it doesn't
[32:28] matter what how much trouble the devil
[32:29] puts in our way. We have a purpose to
[32:31] fulfill and the devil can't take our
[32:33] lives. He can't stop us until our
[32:36] purpose is done.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So even you know so our lives are
[32:40] hid in Christ. Now there's um you know
[32:43] brother Brown speaks about the rapture
[32:44] of the bride and he really says it's a
[32:46] secret going. It's a secret going. It's
[32:49] a coming but it's really a going, right?
[32:52] And it's a secret going. He would say
[32:54] it's like Romeo and Juliet. you know,
[32:56] Romeo would get the ladder up and put it
[32:58] up against the uh, you know, Juliet's
[33:00] house in nighttime and, you know, get
[33:02] her off the balcony, whatever, and and
[33:03] and take her away into the night. It was
[33:06] a secret going of Juliet. It's the same
[33:08] thing with you and I. We're living in
[33:10] the time of a secret going.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's why our hearts are so,
[33:13] Lord, I want to walk with you. I want
[33:15] more of you, Lord. I love you, Lord.
[33:17] What is that? That's a draw. That's a
[33:18] deep calling. There's a there's a desire
[33:21] that the Lord put in here. I want more
[33:22] of you cuz he wants to reveal more of
[33:25] himself.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you have that longing
[33:27] tonight, you're a blessed person to
[33:29] hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[33:31] you're blessed.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we know he's he says, "I so
[33:35] see we're at the end now. See, I don't
[33:36] know. I'm looking for him today, but if
[33:38] he isn't here today, I'll be looking for
[33:39] him tomorrow. And if he isn't here there
[33:41] tomorrow, I'll be looking for him the
[33:42] next day. And if he isn't here this
[33:44] year, I'll be looking for him uh looking
[33:46] next year for him. I know he's coming. I
[33:49] don't know the hour or I mean minute or
[33:51] hour, excuse me, but I know everything's
[33:53] fulfilled. Ready for the rapture. The
[33:55] church is called out. It's a secret
[33:56] going just vanish and that'll be all.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Are you looking for that moment?
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust the Lord's put you in
[34:04] expectation. Soon and very soon the dead
[34:06] in Christ are going to raise and you'll
[34:08] recognize them. They won't be the the
[34:10] the the age that you last saw them. Many
[34:13] of them were up in their up in their
[34:14] years, right? But you'll recognize them
[34:16] as teenagers. Amen. But and you know and
[34:19] then we'll be gone. That's what we're
[34:21] looking for. Now our hiding place as I
[34:24] put here, it's not a it's not a physical
[34:26] building or a location, right? Our
[34:29] hiding place is a person as as I would
[34:32] say in Isaiah. And a man shall be as a
[34:34] hiding place from the wind and a coveret
[34:36] from the tempest as rivers of water and
[34:38] a dry place as the shadows I mean as a
[34:41] shadow of a great rock and a weary land.
[34:43] And the eyes of them that shall see uh
[34:46] shall uh sorry and the eyes of them that
[34:48] see shall not be dim. And the ears of
[34:51] them that hear shall hearken.
[34:54] Blessed are your eyes for you see and
[34:56] your ears for you hear. Amen. Your eyes
[34:58] will not be dim.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; You will hearken. I'm just breaking this
[35:02] down because I want to go slowly through
[35:03] this so you realize you're blessed
[35:05] &gt;&gt; to have spiritual ears in this day. That
[35:07] wasn't you.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; That wasn't your upbringing. That wasn't
[35:11] me. That wasn't this church. That was
[35:13] God
[35:14] &gt;&gt; gave you ears to hear. You're blessed.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; You're a fortunate people.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Even the angels desired to look into the
[35:21] salvation that's come unto you. They
[35:22] couldn't. They they weren't allowed.
[35:24] They weren't privy to what you have in
[35:26] your souls. The revelation of Jesus
[35:28] Christ. Amen. So, we're very blessed.
[35:30] But a man shall be a hiding place from
[35:31] the wind. So, so our hiding place is a
[35:34] person. And we know that person is the
[35:35] Lord Jesus Christ. And he's the biggest
[35:37] of them all.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like my daddy can beat up
[35:40] your daddy. Well, my daddy can beat up
[35:42] all the daddies, right? Cuz my daddy's
[35:44] the Lord Jesus. Amen. So, he's the
[35:45] biggest of them all. So, if he's the
[35:47] hiding place, he ain't some small hiding
[35:49] place. No, he protects you from all the
[35:51] wind, every wind of doctrine, every wind
[35:54] of trouble. You can watch it go by, but
[35:56] you can be hidden behind the rock. Amen.
[35:58] You can be uh in a place of safety in
[36:01] your soul cuz, you know, who's ever just
[36:03] really just sat there, you know, lots of
[36:04] things been going on in your mind, but
[36:06] when you really just meditate on the
[36:08] Lord, there's just something that's
[36:09] solid,
[36:10] &gt;&gt; right? And it's not mind over matter.
[36:12] There's just something in you just that
[36:13] that it's just unmovable.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; What's that? You're in that hiding
[36:16] place.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; You're in that hiding place. This can be
[36:19] going all kind of ways.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; But when you just kind of just, you
[36:23] know, take stock and there's something
[36:25] in there that's just anchored. I don't
[36:26] know how to describe it any better. To
[36:28] me, that's the hiding place.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Your soul is safe and secure. Amen. You
[36:33] may have all kind of worries going on,
[36:35] but there's something in you just holds
[36:37] on. And it's not you trying to keep
[36:39] everything level. He just he just keeps
[36:41] you.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz you're in the hiding place.
[36:43] He's a man who's a place, you know, he's
[36:45] a hiding place from the wind.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, every believer has
[36:50] a desire to dwell in the place of the
[36:52] Lord. To dwell in this hiding place as
[36:54] maybe let's just read Psalms 27 from the
[36:56] first verse. I don't have it here. Uh
[36:58] but you know, Brother Brham would take
[36:59] this scripture and he would he would use
[37:01] it as the as the text when he preaches
[37:04] the rapture. It's interesting how he
[37:06] doesn't go to I probably said this
[37:08] before. I probably say a lot of things
[37:09] before, but you know, he would um he
[37:11] would he would speak about the um you
[37:14] know, when he went to the rapture, he
[37:15] did not go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4
[37:18] as an opening text or he didn't even go
[37:20] to, you know, like Paul's speaking about
[37:22] how we'll all be changed in a moment or
[37:23] twinkling of an eye. He didn't go to
[37:24] those as the opening texts, but but he
[37:27] went to Psalms 27. So really when a when
[37:30] a minister stands up and he takes his
[37:32] opening text is really the foundation or
[37:34] really the whole you know is actually
[37:36] you could say the backbone of the whole
[37:37] service
[37:39] right so so I'm saying that because it's
[37:42] more important he's not just picking a
[37:44] nice psalm he's saying this to me this
[37:47] is the condition of the people who are
[37:50] in the hiding place because those who
[37:52] whose lives are hitting Christ they're
[37:54] ready to go
[37:56] &gt;&gt; right so let's start from verse 1. The
[37:59] Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom
[38:00] shall I fear? The Lord is the strength
[38:03] of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?
[38:06] When the wicked and even my enemies and
[38:08] my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh,
[38:10] they stumbled and fell. Now, there was a
[38:12] time when your enemy came against you,
[38:14] you stumbled and fell, right? Temptation
[38:16] came or just your carnal nature ruling
[38:19] you completely and you had nothing to
[38:21] oppose it in you because you're just all
[38:23] carnal, right? We all were walking by
[38:25] the spirit of the power of the this
[38:27] world, right? There was no resistance in
[38:29] us once upon a time. But then God came
[38:31] in. Then now there's this there's this
[38:33] force. There's this opposing force. And
[38:35] that's why the believer wrestles between
[38:37] the divine nature and the carnal nature
[38:39] because there's an opposing force.
[38:41] Before that force wasn't there. It was
[38:43] just carnal nature.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Right? But then when he came in, it
[38:46] changes everything. Right? So now, so
[38:48] there was once upon a time when our
[38:50] enemies came against us, we stumbled and
[38:52] fell. But then when the Lord comes in,
[38:54] he begins to mature and grow us. And the
[38:56] things that once dominated our lives
[38:59] eventually become under our feet. We may
[39:01] have to fight it for a while, but
[39:03] eventually that thing is subdued.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Right? And then there comes a time when
[39:06] it came to eat you up, you ate it up.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; It became your bread. It became your
[39:10] food. It became your strength.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Though a ho should encamp against
[39:14] me, my heart shall not fear. Though war
[39:16] should rise against me, in this will I
[39:18] be confident. Isn't it amazing how he's
[39:20] so David is speaking of this end time.
[39:23] He's saying that you know though a host
[39:24] should encamp against me and truly
[39:26] there's an innumerable company of devils
[39:28] that have been released upon this earth.
[39:30] There's more demon power released now
[39:32] than there ever has been in the history
[39:34] of the world. So you're saying this host
[39:35] is encamped against me. Sure the guns of
[39:38] hell are trained against you. But if God
[39:40] before you, who can be against you?
[39:41] Right? But but but notice what he's what
[39:44] what David is is is placing the
[39:46] confidence of the believer in. One thing
[39:48] have I desired of the Lord that I will
[39:50] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[39:52] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[39:54] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[39:56] inquire in his temple. For in the time
[39:58] of trouble he shall hide me in his
[40:00] pavilion. In the secret of his
[40:02] tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall
[40:04] set me up. He shall set me up upon a
[40:07] rock. This is the thing that David would
[40:10] say the believer would be confident in.
[40:12] My life is hidden in Christ. He's built
[40:15] me upon the rock of revelation that the
[40:16] gates of hell cannot prevail against
[40:19] what I'm built upon. My foundation is
[40:22] sure which is the word of God. The
[40:24] revelation of the word. He's more than
[40:25] able to perform his word. Whatever storm
[40:28] blows, there's something in the believer
[40:29] says, "God, you're more than able to
[40:32] fulfill your word. Lord, I'm going to
[40:34] look at what I'm built upon. I'm going
[40:36] to focus on that word. Lord, I'm not
[40:38] going to look at the storm. Look at what
[40:39] the devil's trying to do. I'm going to
[40:41] focus upon you. Because even Jonah got
[40:43] to a place in a whale's belly. They that
[40:46] observe lying vanities forsake their own
[40:48] mercy. He realized he was a son of
[40:51] Abraham. He realized he was a prophet of
[40:53] God. He realized, sure, he had jumped,
[40:56] you know, tried to escape the presence
[40:57] of God, but God wasn't finished with
[40:59] him. And by faith, he prayed towards the
[41:01] temple of Solomon. God heard his prayer.
[41:03] He got spat out on the bank and he
[41:04] finished his ministry. Right? But you
[41:06] see, he got into a tight spot. But you
[41:08] know what did he do? He realized that
[41:11] his life was set upon a rock. I trust we
[41:15] are too.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're built on the right
[41:18] foundation. And now shall my head be
[41:20] lifted up above my enemies round about
[41:22] me. Therefore, I offer in his tabernacle
[41:25] sacrifices of joy. I'll sing. Yeah, I'll
[41:27] sing praises unto the Lord. Now, I just
[41:31] want to keep going down to verse eight
[41:32] because I love verse eight. Hear, oh
[41:34] Lord, when I cry with my voice, and have
[41:35] mercy also upon me, and answer me. When
[41:38] thou saidest, seek ye my face, my heart
[41:40] said unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I
[41:43] seek. Why? Because because when the Lord
[41:46] speaks, where does that voice really
[41:48] come out of? There's a response in the
[41:50] heart. My heart said to thee, Lord, not
[41:53] my head, my heart said, Lord, thy face
[41:55] will I seek. But you see, this is the
[41:57] condition of the believer that is ready
[41:59] for the rapture. not having it all
[42:02] together necessarily, not not not
[42:05] walking like they know it all and
[42:06] they're confident all these well in
[42:08] themselves, but their desire and their
[42:11] confidence is in the fact that their
[42:13] life is hidden Christ. I mean that they
[42:15] are in the secret of his tabernacle. You
[42:17] see it is such a secret you know even
[42:19] you know the devil can't even understand
[42:21] how can God he's seen God he's been in
[42:25] the presence of God. He was the anointed
[42:27] cherub that coverth right? So he had
[42:28] access, he gave access to the throne of
[42:30] God. He's seen God in his great majesty.
[42:33] We have never seen him like that. Right?
[42:35] We have never seen God like that. He's
[42:38] seen God like that. Even the Bible says
[42:40] that the God is so holy even the angels
[42:42] are dirty in his sight. Sinless angels.
[42:46] So So, so he he doesn't understand how
[42:48] on earth could that kind of a being
[42:50] dwell in you and I.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; It's a secret. See, he doesn't it's it's
[42:54] not revealed to him. It's not clear to
[42:56] him. but to us by the power of the
[42:59] blood.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; How could God not dwell in us because of
[43:02] his sacrifice? How could God not dwell
[43:05] in our souls because of what he has
[43:06] done? Amen. The purchasing power of our
[43:08] redemption was the blood of God. Amen.
[43:11] So, if it was a perfect a perfect
[43:12] sacrifice, a perfect blood, a perfect
[43:14] atonement, then how could not how could
[43:16] God not dwell in you and I?
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't think that's too, you
[43:21] know, when you look at your lamb, you
[43:23] think, how on earth could I not
[43:24] overcome,
[43:25] &gt;&gt; right? But when you look at your lamb,
[43:27] you think, "How on earth can I not be
[43:28] victorious?" If you look at yourself,
[43:30] you think, "How on earth can I be
[43:31] victorious? And how could I overcome?"
[43:33] If you look at yourself, but if you look
[43:35] at him,
[43:36] &gt;&gt; it changes everything. Amen.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is this is the thing
[43:40] that that that the believer desires that
[43:42] they would seek after that dwell in the
[43:44] house of the Lord all the days of their
[43:45] life. Amen. Praise the Lord. So now we
[43:49] got to realize that this hiding place,
[43:52] we need to yield to this hiding place.
[43:56] Brother Bam says in the hour has come.
[43:57] He says, "Oh my, always there's um uh
[43:59] when there's anything going on down
[44:00] here, there's something going on up
[44:03] there also." Amen. There's always two
[44:05] sides to it. You know, when Satan's on
[44:07] the job, Jesus is also who um ever who
[44:11] you yield your faith to, that's the way
[44:12] it's going. He says, "Give it to
[44:14] Christ." So when something's going on
[44:15] upon the earth, there's something going
[44:17] on up in heaven also. I mean, God is not
[44:19] surprised when something happens to you
[44:21] and I. He's not shocked and he's not in
[44:23] reactionary mode. Our God never reacts.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; He He preempts. Amen. He warns. Amen. He
[44:29] knows before the time what's going to
[44:30] happen. He's never reactive.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Even in the garden, he wasn't reactive.
[44:34] He knew exactly what was what was going
[44:36] to happen. Amen. He knows what's going
[44:38] to happen in your life.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so whenever something's
[44:41] happening on the earth, something's
[44:42] going on up in heaven. Amen. So, what we
[44:44] need to do is yield our faith to our
[44:46] hiding place.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't don't yield it to your
[44:49] senses. Don't yield it to the enemy.
[44:51] Yield your faith to your hiding place.
[44:53] And you watch that hiding place step
[44:55] into action cuz he's a man, remember?
[44:57] He's he's not a static thing. He's not
[44:59] some building.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; He's a being.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our hiding place encamps about us.
[45:07] The angel of the Lord encamps around
[45:08] those that fear him and deliverth them.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for those last three
[45:13] words, and deliverth them. He doesn't
[45:15] just encamp about us like some silent
[45:17] onlooker just recording and just
[45:19] observing. No, he encamps about us, but
[45:21] he delivers us. Amen. He says, "Oh,
[45:23] taste and see that the Lord is good.
[45:25] Blessed is the man that trusteth in his
[45:28] hiding place." Hallelujah. Why? Because
[45:30] he encamps about us and he delivers us.
[45:32] Amen. I trust you. You know, I trust we
[45:34] could look at every trial we've gone
[45:36] through in life. We've come out the
[45:37] other side. What would our be our
[45:38] conclusion be? He delivered me. Amen. He
[45:41] came on the scene in his time and he
[45:44] delivered me. It's so important in a
[45:46] trial. Wait for God to speak. The devil,
[45:49] you know, God gives his word, then the
[45:51] devil gives his opinion, gives his
[45:53] feelings in temptation, but wait for God
[45:55] to come in and speak in the end. Amen.
[45:57] You can see it in the garden. God spoke,
[45:59] "Don't uh eat the tree." Right? Then the
[46:02] devil came along with his opinion. Yah
[46:03] had God said. Eve should said, "Hold on.
[46:06] Now I need to hear God again." But she
[46:08] didn't. Right? But Job sat there in the
[46:10] trial. God, you know, God gave his word.
[46:14] Lamb sacrifice is what I need. He gave
[46:16] the lamb, right? Then the devil came
[46:18] along, told God that Job is going to um
[46:22] curse him to his face if something bad
[46:24] happens to him. And God had confidence
[46:26] in Job already cuz he's been in Job's
[46:28] future, right? And then so what happens
[46:29] is God allows Satan to do certain things
[46:31] to Job. And so what happens is is
[46:33] calamity befalls him. And then what
[46:36] happens? Job's friends come along.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; And what's really happening? The devil's
[46:40] speaking.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; It's reasoning speaking. Did Job did Job
[46:44] start acting? based on what they were
[46:46] saying. No, he just said basically, I
[46:48] don't understand what's going on, but
[46:49] I'm not a sinner. Right? But he waited
[46:51] until God came on the scene and then God
[46:53] spoke.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; So in every trial, wait for God to
[46:56] speak.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll bring the conclusion of the
[46:59] matter.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Colossians 3, we're
[47:02] just going to go through a few here. He
[47:04] says, "See if if you been uh if ye then
[47:07] be risen with Christ, seek those things
[47:09] which are above, where Christ siteth on
[47:11] the right hand of God. Set your
[47:13] affection on things above, not on the
[47:15] thing things on the earth. For ye are
[47:17] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[47:19] God. I mean, so we're hidden away. I
[47:22] mean, we're hidden away in the best
[47:23] place that could ever be uh designed
[47:28] because our hiding place, as I said
[47:30] about a bunker before, he's our hiding
[47:32] place and our shield.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. A shield quenches the fiery darts
[47:37] of the enemy. And he's going to lift up
[47:38] your shield of revelation. You watch it
[47:40] go to work. Amen. You'll be amazed by
[47:42] how many fiery darts you can quench for
[47:44] jealousy, strife, gossip, bitterness,
[47:47] unbelief, reasoning, all these things.
[47:49] Raise up your shield of faith. I'm a son
[47:51] or daughter of God. I've been purchased
[47:53] by the blood of Jesus Christ. I'm never
[47:55] out of his care. He's mindful of what
[47:58] I'm going through. He cares about me.
[48:00] He's allowed this cuz he wants to prove
[48:01] his word. Amen. He's put me upon the
[48:03] earth to be a witness of his saving
[48:05] grace. Amen. I am not out of his care.
[48:07] I'm working. All things are working for
[48:09] my good. And though even if I'm in the
[48:11] permissive will of God, he'll bring it
[48:13] round to his perfect will. Nothing can
[48:15] go wrong. Everything's going fine cuz
[48:18] he's in control.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So
[48:27] So this hiding place, what is it? It's
[48:29] the greatest thing. How did what did God
[48:31] fortify us behind? He fortified us
[48:34] behind his own word. I mean, as long as
[48:36] you're in that word, you're safe. If you
[48:39] abide in me and my words in you, then
[48:41] ask what you will. That's it. The word.
[48:44] So his word is our hiding place. You
[48:46] step out of that word, you stepped out
[48:47] of the hiding place. That's why we must
[48:49] be always be very careful when something
[48:51] comes up unexpected. Don't react
[48:53] carnally. Don't react emotionally.
[48:56] Emotional decisions are never good
[48:58] decisions. You look at sales and
[49:00] advertising, different things, it always
[49:01] appeals to the emotion. You could have
[49:04] this and you could do this and you could
[49:05] do this. In reality,
[49:08] no. All you do is have an empty bank
[49:11] account or some debt or something. You
[49:13] know, you got to be but never do main
[49:15] things emotionally. Always take it take
[49:18] it back to the word of God. Every every
[49:21] decision should be based on the word.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, but my uh my circumstances are
[49:26] unique. There's nothing new under the
[49:28] sun. Especially in 2025. We've been here
[49:32] a while. There's nothing new under the
[49:34] sun, right? So, we got to make sure that
[49:37] our because his word is our hiding
[49:40] place. And I'm sure we all know the
[49:42] feeling even of when you're when you're
[49:44] when you're walking in a carnal way
[49:46] compared to when you're walking after
[49:48] the spirit. Who knows what that feels
[49:49] like? I mean, yeah, we're all human,
[49:52] right?
[49:52] &gt;&gt; I wave my hands on behalf of everyone
[49:54] right now. But so, you got to realize if
[49:56] you're feeling carnal and you're making
[49:57] a decision, you got to get back in the
[50:00] hiding place, right? get back and just
[50:02] give it all back to the Lord and just
[50:04] trust him. He's going to bring it all
[50:05] through the right way.
[50:08] Amen. Our hiding place is going to
[50:10] transport us to a new world. Amen.
[50:13] Remember remember Noah's Noah's hiding
[50:16] place was the ark. It was a God
[50:17] constructed boat and it carried him from
[50:20] one world to another world. Hallelujah.
[50:23] Our hiding place is our mode of
[50:24] transport.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to carry us from this
[50:27] world to the next. Amen. And it's not to
[50:30] a world after there's been a, you know,
[50:32] cuz Noah in reality went to a worseer
[50:34] world. The world before the Andolivian
[50:36] flood was a far nicer place, right?
[50:40] We're not going to a lesser place. We're
[50:42] going to a far more supreme place. It's
[50:44] going to take us to glory, not just
[50:46] another place upon this earth, right? I
[50:48] mean, so so our so before I, you know, I
[50:51] love this. He says, look, it could
[50:53] happen any time. There's not one thing
[50:55] left. Coming of the Lord's at hand. We
[50:57] see the uh in the hangers of Russia all
[50:59] the different world bombs and things
[51:00] that would destroy the complete world in
[51:02] one snap. The world could not stand it.
[51:04] And before that takes place, the church
[51:07] is going to glory. Remember before any
[51:10] rain fell, Noah was in the ark safely.
[51:14] Hallelujah.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; What do we have to fear?
[51:18] Really,
[51:20] if you're safe and secure in Christ,
[51:23] nothing can go wrong.
[51:26] You might, well, this has happened. This
[51:27] has happened. I tell you, in reality,
[51:29] has anything actually gone wrong. Has
[51:31] not God worked it out for his own glory.
[51:33] Has he not brought it out? All things
[51:35] work together for good, for the good.
[51:38] Right? I think I can stand here and say
[51:40] that. I think I qualified at the moment
[51:41] of time what what we're going through.
[51:43] I'm not saying these things flippantly.
[51:44] You got to be you got to take a step
[51:46] back and say, "Lord, I know this is
[51:48] working for my good. I don't need to
[51:50] understand it. I trust you, Lord."
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants a people that have faith
[51:55] in him and trust him.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Job didn't understand everything
[51:59] he was going through,
[52:01] but he trusted the Lord. And in the
[52:02] Lord's time, the Lord came and spoke.
[52:06] Fix the whole thing.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are we not in the same
[52:11] category as Job?
[52:13] &gt;&gt; But under the blood of Jesus Christ,
[52:15] right? Amen. So before before you know
[52:18] any any bomb drops, he says, you know,
[52:21] the church is going to glory. Remember,
[52:22] before any rain ever fell, Noah was in
[52:25] the ark safely. Before any fire fell,
[52:27] the angel said to Lot, "Get thee hence.
[52:29] Get out of here because I can do nothing
[52:31] till you've gone hence. Get away from
[52:32] here." Church going out before the
[52:34] destruction comes. And the scientific
[52:36] world says it's 3 minutes until
[52:37] midnight. The clock's ticked away all
[52:40] the time. Eternity's fixing to set in.
[52:42] The world knows, the scientific world
[52:43] knows. Said it would um scare the people
[52:46] to death. You heard they put it on the
[52:47] radio and so forth. I'm telling you
[52:50] what, we've got the best bomb shelter
[52:52] there is.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's not lined with reinforced
[52:56] concrete. It's not titanium. It's not
[52:58] some shock absorbing material. It's not
[53:01] some deep down under the earth. No, it's
[53:03] lined with feathers. Amen. Our our
[53:06] place, our bomb shelter, amen, is made
[53:09] of feathers. The feathers of of the
[53:11] wings of Almighty Jehovah himself. Amen.
[53:14] Why? Cuz we have come to trust to be
[53:16] under the shadow of his almighty wings.
[53:18] Amen. So our so our our shelter is not
[53:21] some hard place. It's not some cold and
[53:24] damn. I've been in bunkers before. When
[53:26] my parents were in Papa New Guinea, the
[53:28] Japanese had their headquarters during
[53:29] World War II. I've been and there's a
[53:31] there was a leader of the Japanese
[53:32] forces, you know, of that part of the
[53:34] Pacific. His name was Yamamoto. I've
[53:37] been in his bunker. It's cold. It's
[53:41] damp. It's dark. It's dingy. It's a it
[53:44] was this hiding place cuz what the
[53:47] allies did just a bit of random uh war
[53:49] history there in rebel what they did is
[53:52] they didn't because just east of there a
[53:54] couple of islands east was the battle of
[53:56] Midway the battle of Guada canal right
[53:58] the Americans turned the war there but
[54:00] then what happened is instead of them
[54:02] landing troops in in rebel to take the
[54:04] Japanese headquarters they just cut it
[54:06] off from the outside world and bombed it
[54:07] to pieces that's what they did so that
[54:10] was his hiding place
[54:13] damp camp, bunker, dark, hard concrete,
[54:17] dingy.
[54:19] Our hiding place is doesn't feel that
[54:21] way. If you feel Christ is a dingy, hard
[54:25] place to be with no light,
[54:29] that's not him.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Okay? That's a perception of him. That's
[54:33] the devil's perception. But he is our
[54:37] bombshell is made out of feathers. It's
[54:39] soft. It's comfortable. It's inviting.
[54:43] It's impeing. It's satisfying. Amen.
[54:46] It's warm. Hallelujah. Amen. It's full
[54:49] of light. Amen. It's opposite to a
[54:50] man-made bunker, hiding place. Amen.
[54:54] Under the shadow of his wings. Amen.
[54:56] That's the shelter. That's the
[54:57] everlasting shadows of his coming in
[55:00] glory. That's the place of refuge. The
[55:02] place to flee to. Amen. Because you got
[55:04] to realize that you know this hiding
[55:07] place when you get in it, you can let
[55:09] off the pressure. you don't need to
[55:11] stress no more. Like like uh you know in
[55:14] the Old Testament when Joshua went into
[55:15] the land he was instructed to to to to
[55:18] delegate six cities as a city of refuge
[55:20] or a hiding place. So if so if a man
[55:23] basic you know basically you know if you
[55:25] killed someone accidentally or something
[55:27] happened you know there was people of
[55:29] that family that tribe had a right to
[55:30] kill you but you could run to those
[55:33] cities of refuge as your hiding place
[55:35] for your case to be uh to be to be
[55:38] judged. And but the thing is when you're
[55:40] outside the hiding place, they had a
[55:42] right to kill you, the avenger of blood.
[55:44] But now when you get into the gate and
[55:46] you get into that hiding place, they
[55:48] can't touch you. So you can let off the
[55:50] pressure. Amen. You can let off the
[55:52] pressure. The hounds of hell can't get
[55:54] my soul. Amen. It is well with my soul.
[55:57] So what we can do, we can let off the
[55:58] pressure in our hiding place. Amen. This
[56:01] hiding place ruin doesn't make us like,
[56:03] you know, like this. You know, the Nazis
[56:05] would try and find and listen for
[56:07] movement through the wall. that, you
[56:09] know, you know, you know, they that that
[56:10] they they'd um, you know, basically do a
[56:12] raid and all these things and they and
[56:14] the Jews that were there, you know,
[56:15] rehearsed how to get into the hiding
[56:17] place quickly. But, you know, the Nazis
[56:19] were always searching for hiding places.
[56:21] And so, so so, so those in the hiding
[56:23] place, they could not even barely
[56:25] breathe cuz the Nazis had listening
[56:28] equipment. They were listening for signs
[56:29] of life. We don't have to be silent in
[56:32] our hiding place. Amen. We can be as
[56:35] loud as loud can be. We can let off the
[56:38] pressure. We can shout. We can dance. We
[56:40] can do a jig. And it wasn't it's not
[56:42] some confined place like that hiding
[56:44] place there where you had to stand. Six
[56:45] men could stand in that little
[56:47] compartment. There's heaps of elbow room
[56:49] to run and shout and scream and dance
[56:50] about.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can be you in the hiding
[56:53] place. You don't have to conform and be
[56:55] silent. You can be you. However God's
[56:57] made you to be. Have liberty to be you.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; If you're loud, be loud. If you're
[57:02] quiet, be quiet. That's fine. You just
[57:03] be you in the hiding place. Amen. We
[57:06] don't need to be afraid that any devil's
[57:07] going to hear us cuz he can't get in
[57:08] anyway. Hallelujah.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, trust. Oh, well, we better
[57:16] be quick about this. Now, this hiding
[57:18] place
[57:24] go here.
[57:26] There's been a few hiding places through
[57:28] the scripture representing pointing to
[57:30] being in Christ. Now, here we are. We
[57:32] have a family. This is on the night of
[57:34] the Passover. where they've killed the
[57:35] lamb has been instructed by Moses and
[57:37] you know that you know the father is
[57:39] taking the blood. It's his his
[57:40] responsibility to make sure the family's
[57:42] in the hiding place to create an
[57:44] atmosphere I mean where the holy ghost
[57:46] is welcome to dwell and change the lives
[57:47] of the family and make a welcoming warm
[57:51] atmosphere in the home not some stress
[57:53] and starchy kind of place but a place of
[57:55] warmth and love and safety that that
[57:58] that whenever the family comes in under
[58:00] the blood they can they can let off the
[58:02] pressure. And so and so here he is. is
[58:04] he's applying the blood with all
[58:05] sincerity. And his wife is there holding
[58:08] a holding a candle, holding a lamp.
[58:10] Amen. You can see the look on her face.
[58:12] She's happy.
[58:14] She's rejoicing. She's thrilled. Why?
[58:17] Because their house is turning going
[58:19] from a going from a house into a hiding
[58:21] place. Cuz remember, the death angel's
[58:23] going to come down. And if and and if
[58:25] any house is not a hiding place by the
[58:27] blood, that death angel can come in,
[58:30] right? But she is watching her husband
[58:32] apply the blood. Amen. And she is she is
[58:35] happy. She feels at ease. Why? Because
[58:38] she has confidence that their house is
[58:40] now becoming a hiding place. And this
[58:43] blood works because every word of the
[58:45] prophet that he commanded with thus say
[58:47] the Lord came to pass. Frogs, fleas,
[58:49] water turning into blood, boils,
[58:51] whatever it was. So this will work as
[58:53] well. Amen. So she could let off the
[58:55] pressure because why? The blood is being
[58:57] applied.
[58:58] I tell you what, friends, when the
[58:59] blood's applied to your heart, blood,
[59:02] you know, when the blood is applied to
[59:03] your life, you can be happy.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, you know, that that that
[59:08] spiritual death can't strike this thing.
[59:11] He can't get in. He's got to pass over.
[59:12] Amen. And but you see the son's a bit
[59:15] concerned cuz he's not too sure. He
[59:16] hasn't caught the fact that because
[59:18] remember, he's the firstborn.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; So, his life is on the line.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; You know, this is why you can see the
[59:23] look on his face. He's kind of watching
[59:24] this whole spectacle go on. And sure,
[59:27] he's seen what's happened in Egypt. He's
[59:28] seen all these things happen in church.
[59:30] And I'm not paralleling church in Egypt,
[59:31] but you understand. He's seen God move.
[59:33] But now it's it's it's his life. It's
[59:36] not someone else's life. Now his life is
[59:38] on the line. So he's like, "Oh, is this
[59:39] going to work? What's going to happen?"
[59:41] And then finally, you know, if we just
[59:42] skip forward, if I could, you know, the
[59:44] father finishes applying the blood. They
[59:46] go inside there. You know, she's
[59:48] prepared the unleavened bread and
[59:49] they've done everything that they were
[59:51] told to do by the word. And then they
[59:53] hear the screams of the neighbors as the
[59:54] death angel came through the
[59:55] neighborhood. And you know, he would he
[59:57] would be so, you know, he he so worked
[1:00:01] up. The son was. The father's just
[1:00:03] sitting there rejoicing.
[1:00:06] Amen. He's just so, you know, so glad.
[1:00:10] But then the son's like, "Dad, but can't
[1:00:12] you hear what's going on down the
[1:00:13] street? Can't you hear that scream?
[1:00:15] That's from Johnny's house." I don't
[1:00:17] know there's any Johnny's here, but you
[1:00:18] know what I mean. I'm just picking a
[1:00:19] name. That scream was from Johnny's
[1:00:20] house. I used to I was playing with him
[1:00:22] yesterday.
[1:00:25] How dad what's going to happen to me
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; and and and and the father can say look
[1:00:31] son look
[1:00:34] we believe in Jehovah
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; and we don't just talk about Jehovah we
[1:00:39] let his word be our hiding place.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe that he said it's the
[1:00:44] blood of the lamb will keep us safe. And
[1:00:47] we've applied the blood. We believe in
[1:00:49] the blood. and you don't need to worry.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; You're safe.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; And then finally, you know, as the as
[1:00:55] the screams go down the neighborhood and
[1:00:58] pass away, then finally he could realize
[1:01:00] just relax and say, "Dad, what you've
[1:01:02] told me about a God that changes lives,
[1:01:06] a God that sets the captive free, a God
[1:01:08] that fills with the Holy Ghost, a God
[1:01:10] that transforms, a God that takes a
[1:01:12] drunkard and a sitter and adulterer and
[1:01:14] a and a gambler and a liar and a cheat
[1:01:16] and a stealer and transforms them into
[1:01:18] sons and daughters of God." I say he
[1:01:20] could say, "Dad, I finally know what
[1:01:22] you're talking about." Why? And he could
[1:01:24] let off the pressure realizing that they
[1:01:26] are in the city of refuge.
[1:01:29] Amen.
[1:01:31] So, whatever you do, come into this
[1:01:34] refuge.
[1:01:36] It can't it can't get you if you're in
[1:01:40] that city of refuge. If you're in
[1:01:41] Christ, brother say, "Daddy, will it get
[1:01:43] me?" No, sir, son. He can't get you.
[1:01:46] Why? That's his promise. When I see the
[1:01:48] blood, I'll pass over you. Go back and
[1:01:50] get your toys and start playing, son.
[1:01:52] There's no need of worrying. We're in
[1:01:53] God's refuge. Let off the steam. Israel
[1:01:55] could sit back and read the Bible while
[1:01:57] the rest of them was screaming and
[1:01:58] building up steam. Israel was relaxed.
[1:02:01] Why? Death right at the door. What
[1:02:03] difference did it make? It can't hurt
[1:02:06] them. Amen. So when death comes to your
[1:02:08] door, glory to God, as long as God's
[1:02:10] requirement, the blood's being placed on
[1:02:12] the lintil of your heart posts, what
[1:02:14] difference does it make? It can't bother
[1:02:16] me.
[1:02:17] Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; And we know that that blood, that token
[1:02:21] is the Holy Ghost in our lives. Amen.
[1:02:23] Praise the Lord. I'm just going to I'm
[1:02:24] just going to try and find a place to
[1:02:26] quit because, you know, Rahab
[1:02:30] Rahab would Yeah. Because this this um
[1:02:33] this place of refuge, this hiding place
[1:02:37] isn't just for ourselves. It's for
[1:02:39] whosoever will. Now, if you look at
[1:02:42] Rahab, she turned her house, her house
[1:02:44] was once a a brothel. Let's just say it
[1:02:46] as it was, right? It was once that. But
[1:02:49] then when she received those two
[1:02:50] messengers came in, remember she never
[1:02:52] met Joshua. She never heard thus sayeth
[1:02:55] the Lord, take the scarlet rope. She
[1:02:57] just had the words of two messengers,
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; right? And and and they told her, look,
[1:03:01] hang this out your window, get everyone
[1:03:04] under it, and you will be safe when we
[1:03:06] take the city. Cuz she knew that
[1:03:08] destruction was coming to Jericho. She
[1:03:10] knew it, right? So, but the thing is a
[1:03:12] true believer when they hear judgments
[1:03:14] coming, they know somehow in God there's
[1:03:16] mercy. There's always mercy with God,
[1:03:18] right? So, so she heard, you know, you
[1:03:21] know, she testified to them how they had
[1:03:22] heard the testimonies of what God did to
[1:03:25] the Egyptians and Og and the Amorites
[1:03:27] and different things. And then she said,
[1:03:29] "But there must be mercy for me."
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. What? So, so she so she was saying
[1:03:34] basically, there's got to be room in
[1:03:35] this hiding place. Can I fit in this
[1:03:37] hiding place somewhere? Amen. And what
[1:03:39] did the spies say? You can
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; just take this scarlet rope that she had
[1:03:43] the the entire time, by the way. Hang it
[1:03:46] out your window. And and then she asked
[1:03:48] the question, "Is there room for more
[1:03:50] than just me in this hiding place?"
[1:03:52] Absolutely. Get your parents in. Get
[1:03:54] your children in. Get your get your
[1:03:56] relatives. Who whosoever will get them
[1:03:58] under this hiding place. So the hiding
[1:04:00] place had room for whosoever will could
[1:04:03] fit into her house. And I tell you what,
[1:04:05] friends, you allow this the Holy Ghost
[1:04:09] to create an atmosphere around you.
[1:04:11] Amen. It will bring an influence of God
[1:04:13] upon people's lives that they will want
[1:04:15] the hiding place that you're in.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You be salty, they get thirsty.
[1:04:20] What will they thirst after? I want that
[1:04:22] hiding place. I mean, I want that same
[1:04:24] God in my life. Amen. That's why we
[1:04:26] should be friendly. We should be loving.
[1:04:28] We should be warm. We should be
[1:04:29] considerate. Amen. We should be kind. We
[1:04:32] should be people of integrity. Amen. We
[1:04:34] should be all those things that people
[1:04:35] actually want what we have. I mean, but
[1:04:38] imagine if Rahab went around all all all
[1:04:40] all sourfaced and grumpy and down and,
[1:04:42] you know, trying to get her family in
[1:04:44] cuz they had to line up with this thing.
[1:04:45] They would never have come in. But she
[1:04:47] would have had a different look on her
[1:04:48] face after those messengers left. Begin
[1:04:51] to speak to them with conviction and
[1:04:52] passion. Look, just get under this
[1:04:54] thing. Get into this hiding place.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so what did they do?
[1:05:00] They came under the shadow of mighty
[1:05:02] Jehovah's wings. Isn't it amazing that
[1:05:05] uh Rahab's house went from a fourthstory
[1:05:07] apartment to a ground level
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; in one moment
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; and the place was exactly as intact as
[1:05:14] it was up there that it went down there
[1:05:15] cuz the Bible says the walls of Jericho
[1:05:17] fell down flat.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so the whole world shook apart
[1:05:22] for Rahab, but she wasn't shaken apart
[1:05:24] cuz she was in the hiding place.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe we can we are in the
[1:05:29] same hiding place, even a greater one,
[1:05:31] cuz we got more than a scarlet rope.
[1:05:33] We've got the King of Kings and Lord of
[1:05:34] Lords as our hiding place.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So what does he he
[1:05:38] becomes our city of refuge and we can
[1:05:41] invite anyone to come into the city of
[1:05:43] refuge. They can let off the pressure
[1:05:44] and they can realize I can be safe and
[1:05:47] secure. That it's not a religion looking
[1:05:49] after me.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; It's not a church looking after me. It's
[1:05:52] almighty God
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; looking after me. Amen. He is my hiding
[1:05:56] place. Amen. Who's enjoyed the hiding
[1:05:58] place? Amen. It's the greatest place to
[1:06:01] live. Amen. I never want to get out.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; I never want to go out into some barren
[1:06:05] wasteland of a world. I want to stay in
[1:06:06] this hiding place.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the wonderful thing is
[1:06:10] is the, you know, well, let let's just
[1:06:13] finish here.
[1:06:15] I'm just going to finish with this.
[1:06:16] Maybe the musicians could come. They
[1:06:19] say, well, what should I do now if I'm
[1:06:21] in this hiding place? This is one of my
[1:06:24] favorite quotes. quotes. I know it's one
[1:06:25] of Christian's favorite quotes. It's
[1:06:26] from He Swore by Himself.
[1:06:29] I know I've read it many times, but
[1:06:30] well, actually, I'm just going to go
[1:06:32] back here just quickly. Our hiding place
[1:06:36] is a is an active protection. It's like
[1:06:39] having the best security detail you
[1:06:41] could imagine because it's the angel of
[1:06:43] the Lord, right? So now, we don't need
[1:06:46] to try and keep the enemy away. He keeps
[1:06:49] him away. There's a repellent on your
[1:06:51] life that keeps every bug of hell from
[1:06:54] you. It may try and bite you. It may try
[1:06:56] and get in, but there's a there's a
[1:06:58] thing in you that it just can't stand.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because and then why can I say
[1:07:05] that is because he is the door to the
[1:07:08] sheep. He is the good shepherd.
[1:07:10] Remember, he's our hiding place. Now,
[1:07:12] the sheep don't need to rely on their
[1:07:14] own ability to keep the wolves away or
[1:07:16] the bears, right? They just be sheep.
[1:07:19] They just follow him. They eat grass.
[1:07:22] They go back to the corral the next day.
[1:07:24] They come out. They go out. They eat
[1:07:26] grass. They follow the shepherd, right?
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; He's a good shepherd.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; He's not a hiling. He's a good shepherd.
[1:07:33] So, we don't need to walk in this world
[1:07:35] in fear.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; We don't need to fear nothing. And that
[1:07:38] doesn't mean you got blinkers on and
[1:07:40] you're, you know, you're just totally
[1:07:41] oblivious to whatever's going on. No,
[1:07:43] you can be aware the devil's right in
[1:07:45] your face, but you don't need to fear
[1:07:47] him cuz you're in the hiding place.
[1:07:49] Amen. And it's and and it's God's job to
[1:07:51] keep him away.
[1:07:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Because why? He is the door to the
[1:07:57] sheep. And brother Bram says this. And
[1:07:59] the only thing that you can ever do to
[1:08:01] beat him is rely on Christ. Amen. And
[1:08:04] humble yourself and let him lead you.
[1:08:07] See, you'll never do it any other way.
[1:08:09] You in your intellect just rely on him.
[1:08:12] He is the shepherd. It ain't the sheep's
[1:08:14] business to keep the wolf away. It's the
[1:08:16] shepherd's business. All powers will
[1:08:18] never do it. I mean, I've got to
[1:08:20] believe, you've got to believe it.
[1:08:22] Pardon me. The sheep must stay with the
[1:08:23] shepherd in order to stay safe. That's
[1:08:25] my safety zone is in Christ. And Christ
[1:08:28] is the word. That's the safety zone.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm just going to finish with
[1:08:34] this. If we're in this hiding place,
[1:08:37] then just walk with that hiding place.
[1:08:39] Walk with God.
[1:08:41] He says, ' Listen, I'm going to say
[1:08:42] something. Look, faith is unconscious.
[1:08:44] Amen. You believe it. I've learned that
[1:08:46] in the years of travel around the world
[1:08:48] and meeting people of all different
[1:08:49] walks, but faith is unconscious. You've
[1:08:51] got faith and you don't even know it.
[1:08:53] That's right. You can be in the hiding
[1:08:56] place and not even realize it.
[1:08:59] Sister Bruce was in the hiding place and
[1:09:01] she went to the prophet for an interview
[1:09:03] because she wanted to know when did I
[1:09:04] get in or am I in?
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; She said, "I just can't. There's nowhere
[1:09:07] I can put my foot on an experience to
[1:09:10] say and and you can read her life
[1:09:11] through the message being used by God,
[1:09:13] part of the body, praying for people,
[1:09:14] all different kind of things. And
[1:09:15] brother Brown brings it down to a very
[1:09:17] simple thing. One day you're going that
[1:09:19] way
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; and then you started going this way
[1:09:22] towards the Lord and and he asked what
[1:09:25] did it? And and she said Christ. He says
[1:09:28] there it is. It's your desire. What do
[1:09:32] you want to be? You want to be a
[1:09:34] Christian more than anything? Love him.
[1:09:37] Serve him. What did that? The hiding
[1:09:40] place.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. The hiding place. I say focus on
[1:09:43] that. You're going through a struggle, a
[1:09:45] trial, things going on in your life.
[1:09:47] What's your desire?
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; More than a feeling, but what what do
[1:09:51] you want to be? If you could really just
[1:09:52] look at your life and say, Lord, what do
[1:09:54] I want to be? I'm not talking about
[1:09:55] careers or natural things. What do you
[1:09:56] as a person want to be? I want to be a
[1:09:59] Christian. I want God to live. I want to
[1:10:02] see him prove his word in my life. I
[1:10:04] want to be a living testimony of his
[1:10:06] grace. I mean, I want to be a billboard
[1:10:09] that people would know Jesus Christ
[1:10:11] lives and he cares and he redeems. I
[1:10:14] want to be a real solid everyday
[1:10:16] Christian. That's why brother A said,
[1:10:18] just go and live a simple Christian
[1:10:19] life. Amen.
[1:10:24] Jesus Christ, no matter if he was in the
[1:10:26] storm and a gale was knocking the boat
[1:10:28] from one side to another or he was
[1:10:29] standing in her face, a mess of demons,
[1:10:31] if he was hanging anywhere, it never
[1:10:33] moved him. He walked right on just as
[1:10:35] calm and quiet as he could be. Why? He
[1:10:37] was simply unconscious of fear or
[1:10:39] anything around him. That's right.
[1:10:41] Whether it was going to happen, whether
[1:10:43] it wasn't going to happen, he knowed it
[1:10:44] was going to happen because God said so.
[1:10:47] I love that. Don't you?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, is he really going to fulfill his
[1:10:50] word? Is he going to answer the prayer?
[1:10:51] That's up to him.
[1:10:53] We don't need to worry. I mean, we got
[1:10:54] full confidence just like the Lord
[1:10:56] Jesus. God said it was going to happen.
[1:10:57] God said so. He didn't say, "Oh, have I
[1:10:59] prayed through? Wonder if I fasted long
[1:11:01] enough. Wonder if I did this." He just
[1:11:03] walked right on unconscious. That's
[1:11:04] right. He believed what God said was
[1:11:07] truth. The words must be fulfilled. And
[1:11:09] he knowed what he's uh what his life was
[1:11:12] to fulfill them. That's right. And
[1:11:14] you're here to fulfill it, too. Just
[1:11:16] walk unconscious of fear. Walk
[1:11:18] unconscious of criticism. Walk
[1:11:20] unconscious unto the world. Walk as you
[1:11:22] walk in Christ, walk with him. Not
[1:11:24] paying any attention to the right or the
[1:11:26] left hand, just keep moving on. If
[1:11:27] something comes up in the church, walk
[1:11:29] with God. Hallelujah. If sickness
[1:11:31] strikes you, walk with God. If the
[1:11:33] neighbor don't like you, walk with God.
[1:11:35] Just keep walking on with God. Enoch one
[1:11:37] day walked like that. You know what he
[1:11:39] done? He walked all the way home with
[1:11:41] God. Just got so far up the road, he
[1:11:43] didn't want to come back anymore. Amen.
[1:11:45] Walk with God. Doctor says you're going
[1:11:47] to die, walk with God. Yeah. Doctor says
[1:11:49] you can't get well, walk with God. Just
[1:11:51] walk with God, that's all. For God has
[1:11:53] promised you, I'll never leave you or
[1:11:55] forsake you. I'll be with you to the end
[1:11:57] of the world. And he took an oath and by
[1:11:59] that covenant that he gave you that he
[1:12:01] would confirm it. Just walk with God.
[1:12:03] You'll have your ups and downs. Don't
[1:12:05] worry. You've got to go through bri
[1:12:07] patches, over sharp rocks, over bluffs,
[1:12:09] down over the hillsides, up through the
[1:12:11] mountains, over the waters. But walk
[1:12:13] with God. Yes, sir. There's so many
[1:12:15] hills to climb upward. You've heard the
[1:12:17] old song. But how little it'll seem when
[1:12:20] you get to the end of the way. My my
[1:12:22] just look at there. All that's been look
[1:12:24] back at your footprints won't be very
[1:12:27] much. So just walk with God. Enjoy the
[1:12:31] hiding place. Amen. Live a life that
[1:12:34] others want to be in that same hiding
[1:12:36] place. Being Christ like you are. Amen.
[1:12:38] There is power in it. If you're in that
[1:12:42] hiding place, the devil can't touch your
[1:12:44] soul.
[1:12:46] Amen. you're safe and secure. So, let's
[1:12:49] stand tonight, shall we?
[1:12:53] Amen. I want to sing that song, uh,
[1:12:54] Speak to the Mountain, I won't be
[1:12:56] shaking, I won't be moved. My God is
[1:12:58] faithful. His promises are true. Amen.
[1:13:01] Why would I worry when giants come
[1:13:03] calling my name? Isn't it actually
[1:13:04] interesting if you read the story of
[1:13:06] David and Goliath, it was David that
[1:13:08] pointed out, he wanted to know who that
[1:13:09] giant was. Who's that guy? Who's that
[1:13:12] uncircumcised Philistine that defies the
[1:13:15] armies of the living God? Why should we
[1:13:17] worry when the enemy comes against us?
[1:13:19] They'll fall at our feet.
[1:13:22] Amen.
[1:13:23] Let's sing.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, why would I worry when giants come
[1:13:31] calling my name?
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:37] Oh my God is so much bigger than the
[1:13:42] troubles I face.
[1:13:49] Oh, why would I hunger for hours or
[1:13:53] reaches our way?
[1:13:56] [Applause]
[1:14:00] Yes, my God is so much bigger than all
[1:14:05] of these things.
[1:14:09] Yes, I won't be sh.
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:16] [Applause]
[1:14:20] Yes, my God is
[1:14:26] his promise is true.
[1:14:31] So I sing to the mountain.
[1:14:37] Oh, it's time to move.
[1:14:42] Yes, my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:14:48] greater than you.
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:54] I encourage
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:23] Hallelujah.
[1:15:26] Yes. My God is gater.
[1:15:31] Hallelujah.
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:35] Hallelujah.
[1:15:44] Our
[1:15:47] God is faithful.
[1:15:52] His promise is true.
[1:15:57] Trust me to
[1:16:01] [Applause]
[1:16:03] Oh, it's time to move.
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:09] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:16:14] greater than you.
[1:16:19] Yes, I won't be sh.
[1:16:25] I won't be.
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:30] My God is faithful.
[1:16:35] His promise is true.
[1:16:40] I speak to the mountain.
[1:16:43] [Music]
[1:16:43] [Applause]
[1:16:46] It's time to do.
[1:16:51] Oh my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:16:57] greater than you.
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:04] There's no mountain to hide, no valley
[1:17:08] to go. There's no fear that I have,
[1:17:12] nothing.
[1:17:14] There's no problem to me. There's no
[1:17:18] weapon to strong. There is nothing for
[1:17:21] God that's impossible.
[1:17:25] There's no mountain to hide, no valley
[1:17:29] to low. There's no fear that I have. He
[1:17:33] doesn't already know. There's no problem
[1:17:37] too big. There's no weapon too strong.
[1:17:41] There is nothing for God that's
[1:17:44] impossible.
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:49] So I won't be shen.
[1:17:55] I won't be
[1:18:00] My God is faithful.
[1:18:04] You are Lord. Your promises.
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:08] Hallelujah.
[1:18:10] So I speak to the mountain.
[1:18:15] Oh, it's time to move.
[1:18:21] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:18:26] greater than you.
[1:18:31] Amen. I speak to that mountain, it's
[1:18:33] time to move. Brother Brandon says,
[1:18:35] "When you speak to your mountain, there
[1:18:36] may be one insignificant grain of sand
[1:18:38] begins to roll, but that mountain is
[1:18:41] moving."
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, you got to, you
[1:18:44] know, I felt maybe it was a bit out of
[1:18:46] balance. I said you just eat. You just
[1:18:48] follow the shepherd. The Lord wants to
[1:18:50] use you to speak.
[1:18:52] Amen. He is the shepherd. He's the
[1:18:53] hiding place in you, right? You just
[1:18:55] trust he will take care of all things.
[1:18:57] But he wants to use your lips to address
[1:19:00] your enemy. Amen. In the right time,
[1:19:02] right? So you just walk with the Lord,
[1:19:04] feed off the word, trust in the Lord.
[1:19:05] But there's a time you say, "Mountain,
[1:19:07] be gone in the name of Jesus Christ. We
[1:19:09] put up with you long enough." Amen. Why?
[1:19:11] Because there's power in this refuge.
[1:19:13] this power in this hiding place to
[1:19:15] conquer every enemy. Amen. Praise the
[1:19:18] Lord. Amen. Let's let's just bow heads
[1:19:19] in a word of prayer. Just say, "Thank
[1:19:21] you, Lord. Are you glad your life is hid
[1:19:24] away? No matter what you're facing, what
[1:19:26] you're going through, you say, Lord, I'm
[1:19:27] so thankful you brought me into the
[1:19:29] hiding place." Well, how did I get it? I
[1:19:31] repented. I was baptized name of the
[1:19:33] Lord Jesus Christ and I received the
[1:19:35] hiding place, the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:37] Ghost. Aren't you thankful for that
[1:19:38] tonight? Amen. Gracious Father, thank
[1:19:42] you, Lord. We're not hidden behind some
[1:19:45] in some cave somewhere, some bunkers in
[1:19:47] Iran, some man-made structure to try and
[1:19:50] keep the enemy out. Lord, we ain't hid
[1:19:52] in that place, dear God. We're hidden in
[1:19:55] in you, Lord. Hallelujah. Lord, under
[1:19:57] the shadow of your great wings, Lord,
[1:19:59] you've lined, Lord, you've lined our
[1:20:01] hiding place with your feathers, oh God.
[1:20:03] Lord, that we can be safe and secure,
[1:20:04] dear God. That Father, behind your word,
[1:20:07] that no weapon of the enemy, no missile,
[1:20:09] nothing he could devise can get us in
[1:20:12] that hiding place, Lord Jesus. Thank
[1:20:13] you, Lord, we can say that our lives are
[1:20:16] hid in Christ. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We
[1:20:18] praise your holy name. I pray, dear God,
[1:20:20] that when we go out these doors, may we
[1:20:22] have greater confidence, Lord, in our
[1:20:24] hiding place in you, Lord. Father,
[1:20:26] because you said a man would become a
[1:20:28] hiding place, Lord. You're that hiding
[1:20:29] place for us, dear God. And may we be so
[1:20:32] thankful, Lord. Lord, may we just have
[1:20:33] such a burden, Lord, realizing there's
[1:20:35] room in the hiding place for others,
[1:20:37] dear God, for whosoever will, Lord. So
[1:20:39] may we just live a life that people want
[1:20:40] to come into the hiding place. Granted,
[1:20:43] dear God, come into Christ. We love you,
[1:20:45] Lord. We thank you for this night. We
[1:20:47] praise your holy name in Jesus Christ's
[1:20:49] name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. God
[1:20:53] bless you, friends. Uh brother K, I'll
[1:20:54] turn the service to you. You want to
[1:20:56] sing a couple of songs. God bless you.

[1:23:54] Are you hurting and broken?

[1:24:04] Jesus is calling.
[1:24:09] Have you come to the end of yourself?
[1:24:14] Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
[1:24:19] Jesus is calling.
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:27] Amen. You may just take your seats this
[1:24:30] evening. We have a testimony from Sister
[1:24:32] Maki.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Ka. Um, I wasn't going to
[1:24:44] come up here and say anything. Um I was
[1:24:47] just going to put a text message on the
[1:24:49] brothers and sisters but um what brother
[1:24:51] Ben said at the end encouraged me to
[1:24:54] come up. Um so few months ago I asked
[1:24:58] for prayer for my parathyroid gland. Um
[1:25:02] it's been quite the levels are high and
[1:25:06] it affects my calcium levels. It's all
[1:25:08] to do with my kidneys. Um, and they the
[1:25:13] doctors had I had met with the surgeon
[1:25:15] and they were pressuring and talking
[1:25:18] about cutting out the gland. Um, but
[1:25:22] with the chances of not having to have
[1:25:24] the surgery if I had a transplant before
[1:25:28] then. Um, so I kept kind of pushing it
[1:25:31] out hoping a transplant would come, but
[1:25:33] then the levels went over 100 and the
[1:25:37] medication w wasn't bring it down. So,
[1:25:40] um it looked like likely that I was
[1:25:42] going to have a surgery soon and um
[1:25:48] had prayer up the front and then uh had
[1:25:51] a blood test at the start of the month
[1:25:54] and it's I got a call today and it's
[1:25:57] come down from 100 to 43 which is quite
[1:26:01] a big difference and they basically
[1:26:04] taken me off the surgery list. So that
[1:26:07] was a great answer prayer.
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We serve a miracle working God.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can just stand once again.
[1:26:27] We just sing one more song.
[1:26:31] Let's do a fast song. Yeah. Let's sing
[1:26:34] Bone, Bone, Bone Again.
