[0:16] be gathered Lord in this place to come
[0:21] away for a while Lord from Justice

[0:32] world from a spiritual perspective well
[0:35] just with spiritual eyes Lord this this
[0:39] evening that Lord all we would see
[0:41] around us was death and rot and decay
[0:45] Lord as men turns their back on you Lord
[0:50] and they turn their back on life they
[0:53] turn their back on light Lord all the
[0:55] essential ingredients for growth Lord

[19:30] know word of Prayer our gracious
[19:34] Heavenly Father no there's not much that
[19:37] we can do Lord but we can just surrender
[19:39] ourselves to you Lord the reason why we
[19:43] come here every evening the Lord is
[19:44] because we love you and we we want to
[19:46] fellowship with who you Lord and we just
[19:49] want you to minister unto us because
[19:51] we've got needs and questions hello that
[19:53] we sometimes need answers Lord and we
[19:56] are said tonight that this very sermon
[19:58] Lord and and anything that I can bring
[20:00] forth Lord you take that sword because
[20:02] it's your soul Lord cuz I'm not a salt
[20:05] producer Lord I'm just a sword Lord
[20:07] great I'm not a soul creator but I can
[20:09] just only take the thoughts that comes
[20:11] from you Lord and lay it in front of
[20:12] your Lord and ask the Holy Ghost to
[20:14] anoint the word and to bring it into
[20:16] everyone's heart Lord in season so I
[20:19] pray Lord even with the children tonight
[20:20] Lord may they enter in my all of us to
[20:23] leave the work week just a bit behind
[20:25] the Lord and just come in faith Lord and
[20:27] and just for this little bit of time
[20:29] Lord come and worship you in all truth
[20:31] and life Lord everyone that's not yet
[20:34] tonight Lord we miss them and we ask
[20:36] that your blessing be with him as well
[20:37] hello and thank you so much for this
[20:39] fellowship and just the time to spend in
[20:42] your word and share your word Lord I
[20:43] pray that you will anoint this word
[20:45] tonight Lord and you will be done here
[20:48] on earth
[20:49] he's in heaven we pray this all in the
[20:51] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[20:53] and the church says amen amen
[20:57] her brother Ben can you just do me a
[21:01] little bit down here on the fall peg
[21:05] please see if this works there we go
[21:11] well we're gonna first before I get you
[21:14] all to sit I just want to first tell you
[21:16] what am I going to speak about tonight
[21:17] and then we'll open the scripture and
[21:19] then you all can receive it I wanted
[21:22] tonight speak about personality versus
[21:25] character so there's a lot and and what
[21:30] I want to show you is there is so big
[21:33] difference between someone's personality
[21:35] and someone's character and I want to
[21:39] show you that when we Christians
[21:41] character is very important it is
[21:44] absolutely crucial to a walk as a
[21:46] Christian for everything we do so
[21:49] hopefully after tonight you'll see that
[21:51] it's good to have a personality but we
[21:54] need God's character so let's turn our
[21:57] Bibles to 2nd Corinthians 4 and we're
[22:01] going to read they just verse 18 I got
[22:04] it on the screen for you praise the Lord
[22:13] they say when you always mean it says
[22:19] yeah while we look not at the things
[22:23] which are seen but at the things which
[22:27] are not seen amen and but the things
[22:34] which are not seen for the things which
[22:37] are seen are temporal
[22:39] so children what temporal means is it
[22:42] has an int okay it's only a little space
[22:45] of time and everything that you see now
[22:47] will have an end okay but the things
[22:51] which are not seen are eternal we ask
[22:55] that the Lord will bless this word and
[22:57] add is basing to this word you all can
[22:58] be seated and I was nervous
[23:02] but then I spoke to a brother in the
[23:05] tooth brother beam god bless you and it
[23:08] just dawned that you're family so I can
[23:10] just be myself so I'm not gonna bring
[23:12] something massive from something there's
[23:15] this this deep thing I'm just gonna be
[23:17] me and I pray that you will see it that
[23:19] this is not me this is just the sort and
[23:22] I'm gonna deliver the sort and I'll pray
[23:24] that the Holy Ghost will just show it in
[23:26] your heart and you young children this
[23:28] is where you can get your blessing
[23:30] you only need a sentence in season or a
[23:33] word in season I remember when brother
[23:35] Isaac he preached about resolved
[23:37] I remember that sermon brother Isaac and
[23:39] it was one word and it changed a lot for
[23:44] me that night so even if you just keep
[23:45] the one word go with that I okay so
[23:48] don't miss your blessing so this let's
[23:51] kick away because I've got 18 slides but
[23:53] I'll run fast through them so if we look
[23:56] at this this is my and the reason why if
[23:58] the the thing is I made all these notes
[24:00] and it doesn't show on thee so I have to
[24:02] follow the computer so sorry about that
[24:04] so we look at the stream so all your
[24:07] kids this is a lovely tree so this is
[24:09] representing a believer okay so when I
[24:13] look at this tree I see nice above the
[24:16] ground I see nice green leaves and I see
[24:19] apples in it or fruit or you can even
[24:21] have peaches if you want and I see some
[24:24] nice green grass and leaves and it just
[24:26] looks so good
[24:28] so when I look at this tree I know the
[24:30] Bible says by the fruit that you Bay you
[24:32] shall be you that so be a record to what
[24:35] you believe but there is a lot of fight
[24:37] people that look like this that act like
[24:41] this that deceive you because it sees in
[24:44] the Bible that in this time the two will
[24:46] be so close together the Spirit of God
[24:48] and the spirit of Satan will be so close
[24:51] together that it will deceive the very
[24:53] elect that Eve was possible so what I
[24:56] want to show you tonight is not just to
[24:58] look at the fruits don't just look at
[25:00] the personality but I want you to see
[25:03] what is underneath the ground and where
[25:06] you put your roots because where you put
[25:08] your roots is what's gonna hold you in
[25:11] the wind blows when the storm comes when
[25:13] the waters sweeping past you way
[25:15] you of where you believe is is attached
[25:18] where you are founded upon that rock
[25:20] that's what's going to keep you and
[25:22] nothing will move you so don't always
[25:25] just look at the personality because a
[25:27] personality can be deceiving
[25:29] Amen so let's jump in this praise the
[25:33] Lord so I have to get a personality so I
[25:36] got the definition of personality it's
[25:39] very small oh you can see it I can see
[25:41] it I'll read it yeah but I'll just read
[25:43] the past that that makes for me that
[25:45] that describes a personality so it says
[25:49] that a personality is made of up of
[25:53] characteristics patterns of thoughts and
[25:56] feelings and behaviors that make a
[25:59] person unique ok Amen so your
[26:03] personality makes you a very unique
[26:07] person so here's a picture for you like
[26:11] that ok
[26:13] this frog I couldn't get a better frog
[26:16] that's cool cuz all the other frogs are
[26:18] bad but this frog has got personality so
[26:21] the reason I put it up like that is
[26:23] first of all it's an ugly frog second of
[26:27] all it's all about all the colors that
[26:29] he could have it's got cool glasses it's
[26:32] a cool frog it's like a frog that walks
[26:34] on eggs okay this is a cool frog if you
[26:37] look at this frog he has it all together
[26:39] he just knows he's got what the world
[26:41] calls today possess okay this frog is
[26:44] awesome but see this frog is only a
[26:48] personality okay I'll bring it into you
[26:52] into the thought now so that's what if
[26:53] you describe personality for me this is
[26:56] what I see okay now we're going to go to
[27:00] character and the very definition from
[27:02] character and I needed to show the
[27:04] picture because I'm gonna go one back I
[27:06] might not show the picture taken of
[27:08] course you might not like it but look at
[27:10] this frog okay so this frog how it is
[27:13] formed it's like when your personality
[27:16] is formed we you grow up so I grew up in
[27:18] the Free State and it's a very dry
[27:20] country very flat country so my
[27:22] personality can maybe be drawn flat but
[27:25] it's not what it is
[27:27] but where I grew up was a farming
[27:30] community so not much of this happens in
[27:32] a farming community okay though I've got
[27:35] a bubbly very nice personality sometimes
[27:38] when I grew up it wasn't always so
[27:42] because I want to bring it back so the
[27:44] area you live in
[27:45] affects your personality it can it can
[27:47] alter your personality it can it can
[27:50] give you a personality like I remember
[27:53] when we in the Free State we had people
[27:55] that was in the school called gray okay
[27:58] so Greg was a very it was like the next
[28:00] level college okay which is the best
[28:03] college you know you would say in
[28:04] Wellington like Scots college so and how
[28:08] you knew that someone was from grey as
[28:10] when he come and greet you ago I am a
[28:12] month
[28:13] I'm from grey and you're like I'm just
[28:18] Ricky and I'm from the Free State so it
[28:21] doesn't matter what but he was so proud
[28:24] of where he came from that that was part
[28:26] of his personality and everything that
[28:27] he spoke about will always go back to
[28:29] that school he'll always say I'm from
[28:31] gray and that gray we do it this way and
[28:33] so it was so engrained into him that it
[28:35] became part of his personality but if he
[28:38] wasn't in the Free State in gray that
[28:40] wouldn't be a part of it
[28:41] so your personality could be where you
[28:44] grow up forms a part of your personality
[28:46] okay your culture forms a part of your
[28:50] personality I'm a boogie I'm a free
[28:53] state we take it easy if something
[28:56] breaks we fix it with a number 8 wire
[28:58] and a shifting spanner you know and we
[29:01] can do everything with us anything can
[29:03] be fixed and everything is right but
[29:05] when you come from the town I pick up
[29:07] the phone about a breach stone yeah
[29:10] I've got a flat tire mate can you come
[29:12] and change this I'm sitting here next to
[29:13] the highway and that's how they work
[29:15] we're a free state that he gets on his
[29:17] knees and he's like span is going and
[29:19] wheels going is going on love you didn't
[29:22] pick the speed wheel in but I know
[29:23] someone and he phones he's friended the
[29:25] wrong size diet but that is how we grew
[29:27] up
[29:27] so my personality the try that I have is
[29:30] I don't give up no matter what this
[29:32] situation gives I know there must be
[29:34] somewhere answer but the guy in the city
[29:36] Hugo I'll phone afraid so that is also
[29:39] part of his personality the school you
[29:42] go to your brother and your sister
[29:45] good so form a part of your personality
[29:48] amen
[29:49] okay who's got brothers and sisters okay
[29:53] who loves the brothers and sisters amen
[29:56] who sometimes thinks they are so
[29:59] annoying amen so even that very brother
[30:04] and sister that you have with you can
[30:06] form a part of your personality can give
[30:08] you complexes you can you can react a
[30:10] certain way my brother used to be taller
[30:12] than me so every time when I get to him
[30:14] he would either flick my ear or rub my
[30:16] head so after a while if I walk in the
[30:17] door my brother comes and then because I
[30:21] don't do it anymore but that became a
[30:23] part of who I was okay so I'm not gonna
[30:26] stretch it even your enemies form a part
[30:28] of your personality how you react in
[30:30] conflict so when somebody attacks you
[30:32] and you like get on the defense quickly
[30:34] because you used to it so it is a part
[30:36] of you put a personality and you get
[30:38] some other people something happens and
[30:40] they just sit back and go well what just
[30:43] happen and they so calm and you can not
[30:46] understand what they're doing but it's
[30:48] part of the personality so now we go to
[30:50] the the next one character okay this is
[30:55] this is where it is and so the
[30:58] definition of character says that it's
[31:00] the mental and moral qualities that's
[31:04] distinctive to an individual so mental
[31:07] and moral but I want to say character
[31:10] goes much deeper than just a mental and
[31:12] a moral quality it's something that's
[31:15] here right inside of you
[31:17] it's something that comes out when I
[31:18] don't want to jump ahead but it's
[31:20] something that comes up when when the
[31:21] water gets shaken it's something that
[31:23] just goes I shall not be moved and you
[31:26] can't fake it you cannot fake it
[31:29] character you can't fake personality you
[31:32] can fake character you can so praise the
[31:35] Lord so I say we want today we want the
[31:39] Holy Ghost character we want the
[31:41] character of Jesus Christ
[31:42] okay this is not a preaching this is
[31:45] actually what we want because when Jesus
[31:46] was here on the earth and he was
[31:48] standing in front of a devil and the
[31:50] Devils were challenging and the
[31:51] Pharisees and the Sadducees were
[31:53] challenging on every corner he didn't
[31:55] run around
[31:55] he just was stoned and he waited because
[31:59] he said I couldn't do nothing until the
[32:01] father shows me say he was just waiting
[32:04] and he didn't bow to anyone and
[32:06] everywhere he went
[32:08] he's character everybody knew the
[32:10] character of Jesus Christ they knew when
[32:12] he was coming they were looking forward
[32:14] to him coming they knew that this man
[32:15] could cost our demons this man can't lie
[32:17] so he's he's very character with before
[32:20] him not just his personality but his
[32:24] character so now let's bring this all in
[32:27] here we go so this is what we want in
[32:32] proverbs 3 1 2 7 it says how cuz I want
[32:37] to know how can I get this character of
[32:39] God how can I get such a character that
[32:41] we're not deal with people that they see
[32:43] God and not just a personality you can't
[32:46] have a personality there's nothing wrong
[32:48] with it
[32:48] but we need that character so in
[32:51] proverbs 3 verse 1 to 7 it says they my
[32:56] son forget not my law but let thy heart
[33:00] keep my Commandments for the length of
[33:03] days and a long life and peace shall be
[33:07] and peace shall they add to thee so
[33:10] that's the commandments of the law so
[33:12] that's just following the law of God
[33:14] that's all good
[33:15] but here's where it comes he says let
[33:18] not mercy and true forsake thee bind
[33:21] them about the neck write them on the
[33:23] table of thine heart so when God is
[33:26] speaking to you and mercy comes your way
[33:28] and you see that this is more than a man
[33:30] speaking and this word is coming to talk
[33:33] to me and it's teaching me something and
[33:35] sometimes when the Lord speaks to you it
[33:37] hurts and pride comes in and and things
[33:40] come in and you just don't want to let
[33:41] it go cause we as humans or
[33:43] personalities are pretty hard to break
[33:45] but God is giving you something and is
[33:47] saying you need to address this lid not
[33:51] the mercy of God and the truth of God
[33:53] note forsaken goes
[33:55] mercy of God is when God brings you
[33:56] revelation and it's through a brother or
[33:59] a sister that's it's something maybe and
[34:01] it hurt you and now God goes what are
[34:03] you gonna do with it you have a choice
[34:05] now you can get character or you can
[34:08] just mess this whole thing so when
[34:12] somebody say something to you when when
[34:14] a brother or a sister anyone says
[34:15] something to you or even a situation
[34:17] happens you get retreats to anything God
[34:19] says what are you gonna do with it what
[34:22] are you gonna do with what I just gave
[34:24] you because God will not give it to you
[34:26] if you cannot handle it but he wants you
[34:29] to see do you want character or do you
[34:31] want to bail out and be a personality so
[34:36] then it says thou shall find favor and
[34:39] and good understanding in the sight of
[34:41] God and of men trusting the Lord was all
[34:45] thy heart and lean not unto thine own
[34:48] understanding don't try to figure it out
[34:52] don't try to understand it just lean
[34:55] unto God he says and in all thy ways
[34:58] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[35:02] paths
[35:03] be not wise in thine own eyes
[35:09] okay because what you see is not always
[35:13] what's out there
[35:15] Hollywood is the biggest fake in the
[35:17] world what you see on that screen is not
[35:20] what is on that screen you see only what
[35:24] the best picture and the best shot that
[35:26] they could do that's what you see
[35:28] brother Isaac when you did your music
[35:30] video and you edited it you would only
[35:32] pick the scene that you wanted to see in
[35:35] your head but all the other scenes you
[35:36] delete in throw away because you don't
[35:38] need them because that wasn't part of
[35:39] what he visualized but and you might
[35:42] look at that video and think man that's
[35:44] awesome music video but it took him so
[35:47] many hours of recording and it took him
[35:49] so many hours of editing to bring that
[35:51] and that's what Hollywood is it's fake
[35:53] if you take all that veneer off you'll
[35:56] see a green screen here and a boom mic
[35:58] yeah and a camera then five guys running
[36:00] around here but the cameras only focused
[36:02] on what they want you to see don't be
[36:04] fooled
[36:05] Hollywood is fake everything about it
[36:08] is fake okay though you are not gonna
[36:12] get anyway if you follow that I can
[36:14] promise you anyway okay doesn't matter
[36:17] how nice the story is it's not gonna get
[36:19] you anything right the Word of God alone
[36:24] can get you thing and I'm not saying sit
[36:27] in your Bible night and day and try to
[36:28] read and understand it walk with God
[36:30] okay he says and fear the Lord and
[36:34] depart from evil so this is instruction
[36:37] this is when you walking and something
[36:39] comes your way and you think whoa why
[36:41] shouldn't maybe be doing this you should
[36:43] turn around and walk away from it easier
[36:45] say don't even take entertain it don't
[36:47] think about it don't try to explain it
[36:50] or rationalize it just walk away
[36:52] you don't need that you don't need it
[36:54] it's not with you it says you be not
[36:57] wise the Bible says that the children of
[37:00] this world okay
[37:02] Satan's Eden is more wiser than the sons
[37:05] of God okay so this very country at the
[37:08] moment is so proud that they've got more
[37:10] atheist in Christians they proud of it
[37:13] they proud that they can Google and
[37:16] anytime and find an instant answer which
[37:17] you will go and study in the word to
[37:19] show them the truth they don't care
[37:21] about that they want instant now okay
[37:24] google can't tell me what's going on now
[37:25] I just put it aside and I walk on they
[37:28] so wise you tell anybody of this world
[37:30] God is real they tell you you lying says
[37:33] show me God Weezy show me they want
[37:36] instant they can't wait they want
[37:38] instant okay so be careful did well go
[37:44] on I choose to believe the word and the
[37:50] Word of God I'll explain to you this
[37:53] while I say verse 4 he says so shall
[38:00] define favor and good understanding in
[38:03] the sight of God now when I was still in
[38:06] the world young people when brother and
[38:08] one didn't meet the Lord is I look the
[38:11] part I dress the part I said very
[38:15] required in church I didn't bother my
[38:17] mommy or daddy I didn't go every five
[38:20] minutes try to go to the bathroom
[38:22] was a good Christian I prayed I read my
[38:25] Bible but you know what I never
[38:28] understood God I never understood him
[38:33] how could Samson a lion roll up against
[38:37] Samson a lion man we're talking about a
[38:40] massive animal that a lion doesn't come
[38:43] to you say can I bite you oh you look so
[38:46] good I'm gonna bite you tonight no a
[38:48] lion when it's attacking it's going for
[38:50] the kill it wants to destroy you
[38:53] it doesn't reason it's an animal it
[38:55] doesn't reason with a human or with
[38:56] anything to say
[38:57] hi mr. zebra can you run a bit slower
[38:59] because I want to kill you it goes for
[39:01] the kill and it kills so here's a man
[39:03] walking no weapon nothing in the middle
[39:06] of the desert or whereever he walk and
[39:08] this lion attacks him and it goes and he
[39:11] rips this lion's mouth open like a rag
[39:14] have you seen the canines on the lion
[39:17] brother Bob yeah okay you don't stick
[39:20] your hand in the lion's mouth and go oh
[39:22] I think I'm gonna get this oh well it's
[39:24] busy trying to attack you so I couldn't
[39:26] understand how could a man ripple line
[39:28] apart what's that it can't be true but
[39:33] see I never understood the anointing of
[39:35] God I never understood it because I
[39:37] never took the time to just walk with
[39:41] God and say Lord instead of me trying to
[39:43] figure it out just show me I don't
[39:45] understand it you show me Caicos and I
[39:49] don't want to go revelation and it's all
[39:52] but your personal walk with God it's not
[39:54] about you brother and your sister your
[39:56] mother and your father it's you not
[39:58] understanding something and you go Lord
[40:01] I just don't understand this would you
[40:02] show me okay I don't want to go of
[40:05] subject but I didn't understand God I
[40:08] was 32 years old and remember a lot of
[40:11] you young kids might not get to be 32
[40:12] years old just remember that it's by the
[40:17] grace of God we get you so at the age of
[40:20] 32 I meet the Lord and he starts
[40:23] changing my world do I still do I now
[40:25] know everything now no I don't but I
[40:28] keep walking okay cuz I want character
[40:33] oops comes out alright this one so this
[40:42] is looking at the unseen see we don't
[40:45] want to look at what's around us right
[40:48] now we want to see what God's showing us
[40:51] we want to see the angels around us we
[40:54] want to absolutely see we god wants us
[40:56] to go we don't want to just see a car a
[40:59] house a road a next person and that but
[41:02] that that is not gonna help you in your
[41:03] walk with God a ball being kicked oh
[41:05] there's another car there's a bird
[41:07] flying we don't want to see just natural
[41:09] stuff we want to see God what do you
[41:11] want me to do for you we're gonna win a
[41:13] soul how can i impact someone's life
[41:15] that they know these are God I don't
[41:17] need to preach it but my life does okay
[41:20] so here we go it says when God made man
[41:24] he made him thus for we made him a
[41:27] little certain compartment in the man
[41:30] for his own throne this is right in the
[41:32] heart of man his control tower God wants
[41:37] to lead man but man wants to lead
[41:40] himself doesn't want to wait for the
[41:42] Lord just want to lead himself he is
[41:45] therefore there is a war constantly not
[41:48] just every second day this is where I
[41:51] need your attention constantly does not
[41:55] stop brother and is brushing his teeth
[41:57] the devil comes in and tries to attack
[41:58] him yeah you always say it you say I'm
[42:02] brushing my teeth having a nice time and
[42:03] all of a sudden I have this mind battle
[42:05] going on constantly he will not let you
[42:07] go but you can overcome just keep on
[42:10] just keep on he says then man wants to
[42:14] go after what he sees with his eyes and
[42:17] that's where he is deceived that is we
[42:21] Satan deceived Eve by what she could see
[42:24] but the fruit was pleasing to thee hi
[42:28] okay she didn't understand it it was
[42:31] just Pleasant and she took from him but
[42:33] it was death to the soul
[42:35] so is it tonight God wants to lead man
[42:38] so he wants to make men a little control
[42:41] tower tower in the midst of his heart so
[42:44] that man
[42:45] be led by the Spirit of God getting out
[42:47] of his own leading is what separated him
[42:50] from fellowship looking what he could
[42:53] see with his eyes so now let me use your
[42:56] example here we've got Israel and they
[42:59] walking and and after everything God has
[43:02] done through Moses brought them through
[43:03] the desert they in the promised land
[43:05] they still walking and now all of a
[43:06] sudden they go we want the king you know
[43:11] cuz the Jebusites have the king and and
[43:13] I can't even remember all of it more
[43:16] vice every King everybody has a king the
[43:18] Philistines has a king everybody asking
[43:20] why can't we have a key we want a king
[43:22] they experienced all the miracles
[43:25] they've seen all these wonderful things
[43:26] blood water turning to blood they saw
[43:29] flies coming they saw so many miracles
[43:31] bread falling out of the skies now all
[43:34] of a sudden they want a king
[43:35] I want a king because what are they
[43:38] looking at and the other people that one
[43:43] drives this nice car and this one can go
[43:45] like this and that one that they looking
[43:47] around not at the unseen so they're just
[43:49] looking around and then they go to
[43:51] Samuel they say we want a king like this
[43:54] and Samuel wants them and say you don't
[43:56] really want that guy you want God
[43:59] leading you you don't want that guy how
[44:01] many times children has you dad said to
[44:03] you you don't really want to make that
[44:05] decision you don't want to really follow
[44:07] that guy that's not good for you man
[44:09] stay away from it and you just go yeah
[44:12] right he's so boring he doesn't know
[44:14] it's my friend I know him
[44:16] yes he's here he's hanging halfway down
[44:18] his Johnny shirt then he walks like this
[44:20] when he comes into the room and he's off
[44:22] his pants is up but he's a cool dude
[44:24] really
[44:25] okay I think you believe that not a cool
[44:31] dude cool doesn't get you anyway since
[44:36] and that is where he stands here tonight
[44:38] and those who are led by such things by
[44:43] the scripture it says the sons and the
[44:45] daughter of God are led by the Spirit of
[44:47] God your emotions is your control it
[44:51] sounds hard but I'm gonna bring it all
[44:53] in now your emotions is your control
[44:56] okay and you can take
[44:58] and you can notice a man or a woman that
[45:02] tries to walk after the things of the
[45:04] world they can never please God but a
[45:07] man or a woman that will not look at the
[45:10] things of the world but just go
[45:12] according to the leading of the Spirit
[45:13] they're usually in the world of God amen
[45:17] that is the great fight tonight Satan
[45:20] took the eyes a man's head to control
[45:23] him but God looked at the heart
[45:26] okay so here's David and his brothers
[45:30] and I want to bring this story because
[45:32] we all like David and his brothers you
[45:33] know if Samuel comes into the house and
[45:35] he says okay the brothers standing now
[45:39] right in front of Samuel the Prophet he
[45:42] needs to go and find David - anointed
[45:43] king and all the brothers like everybody
[45:46] says look at the biggest brother and
[45:47] he's going to be the one that he comes
[45:49] Boston he's the strapping lad and God
[45:52] says to settle not that one
[45:53] now then this has been preached so many
[45:55] times but but just catch this God
[45:58] doesn't look at what we see he looks at
[46:01] the heart
[46:01] he looks what's in here you cannot fake
[46:04] that because what is in your heart is
[46:06] character it's not personality it's
[46:09] character he says it eventually gets to
[46:12] David and David definitely doesn't look
[46:15] the part but there's something inside of
[46:17] David that God looked at and in God this
[46:20] the possible sees this is a man after my
[46:22] own heart
[46:23] amen so what will God see when he looks
[46:29] into your heart this might be this might
[46:34] be just something I want to drop in here
[46:36] if you stand right before God now what
[46:39] will God see when it looks into your
[46:41] heart now I'm gonna bring it in this is
[46:46] why I asked you this question and I'm
[46:50] not far away to thing indeed man's
[46:53] always trying to achieve something by
[46:55] his head he is supposed to achieve but
[46:58] by his heart you're not supposed to
[47:01] figure it out you're not supposed to
[47:03] over explain it you're supposed to
[47:04] believe in the Word of God that is the
[47:08] control tower where God wants to control
[47:10] him he directs his store
[47:12] he directs his walks he directs his
[47:14] emotion so this is why I said we lit by
[47:17] emotion but God directs that emotion so
[47:20] if you get excited and sure it's God
[47:22] making you excited in church if you want
[47:25] to cry it's God wanting you to cry don't
[47:28] you don't be ashamed of it your emotions
[47:31] as part of you don't get cold and
[47:33] starchy and when somebody moves next you
[47:35] got you removed again and cut you off
[47:37] this way in oh the arms are coming out
[47:39] again huh just be like this brother NDC
[47:42] singing again too loud oh I'm gonna miss
[47:44] tender stuff
[47:45] just let it be seriously let it be cause
[47:50] emotions proves that you know date
[47:53] seriously if you look in the car line in
[47:55] the floor you go cook and he just goes
[47:57] go maybe he's dead you go cook out okay
[48:00] that's that's today it's not he's a lot
[48:02] of you step away and he goes she heard
[48:03] me sorry might he's a lot you can see
[48:05] these something they but a date stick
[48:08] just sitting like this you could kick in
[48:10] the menus and move away kick you move
[48:12] away phrase the Lord move away
[48:13] praise the Lord move away oh I love him
[48:17] so much loving Wow
[48:18] cry do something let get give yourself
[48:21] to the Lord don't don't get starchy oh
[48:24] man I can't explain it he says yeah this
[48:30] is brother branham and I want you to
[48:32] listen to this
[48:32] sometimes I get so happy I just have to
[48:35] let it loose amen
[48:38] there's a woman in the service swinging
[48:40] a headband letting it go that happens in
[48:44] the church I could I can promise you
[48:46] there were some broads going oh oh you
[48:47] know let's just stay you know maybe she
[48:49] took it a bit before and the other guy
[48:51] will go yeah you know she threw a hand
[48:53] back a bit maybe she swung one the least
[48:55] time oh come on
[48:57] leave her be she's happy man leave it
[48:59] that way he says but here is where the
[49:02] trick come this is where the whole trick
[49:04] of the devil comes into course the
[49:05] moment that happens this is what the
[49:08] devil does he says and if I look around
[49:11] to see somebody then see I got my eyes
[49:14] upon people then yeah you miss your
[49:17] whole blessing you missed all placing
[49:20] because you're looking at people oh that
[49:22] one acted and that baby fall off the
[49:24] chain
[49:25] he's running again and you missing your
[49:27] blessing that preacher is preaching is
[49:29] hard out and you looking at a baby
[49:32] believe it be man if you kids if kids
[49:36] behave just you know these deacons for
[49:38] that they'll sort them out okay you just
[49:40] go get you blessing don't know how did
[49:42] the devil wrote your blessing he says
[49:45] but God helped me to keep my eyes closed
[49:49] so I encourage you when you're in church
[49:51] when you're sitting in a service and
[49:53] things happen close your eyes and just
[49:58] stay pray and say Lord I don't want to
[50:00] miss my blessing please don't let me
[50:02] miss my blessing because that very time
[50:05] why does Satan distract you because the
[50:08] preacher is about to say something that
[50:11] could help you and your walk and Satan
[50:13] comes boom and you go right and it goes
[50:16] from posture and you could have stopped
[50:19] that trial right there you could have
[50:21] stopped your trial right there but you
[50:23] chose to be fooled by a silly devil but
[50:27] he belongs under your feet so when
[50:29] something goes on in church and someone
[50:31] is yawning and the other one is falling
[50:33] asleep just leave them be you go get
[50:36] your blessing because if you go get your
[50:38] blessing you walked out bliss and you
[50:41] walked out change and God can do
[50:42] something to that okay but if you get
[50:45] cold and starchy and indifferent and
[50:47] looking here and having this excuses he
[50:49] cannot work in your life you can look at
[50:52] the unseen I want to be late by the
[50:56] Spirit of God that the flesh will have
[50:58] nothing to do with it
[51:03] Amen lord help us to do that
[51:08] I'm I skip over this and close here
[51:20] here we go this is I'll finish through
[51:22] this one and the Lord is good don't look
[51:32] at anyone look to God and if you can't
[51:34] see him look to the unseen okay
[51:37] seriously just keep looking that way
[51:40] close your eyes if you need to do
[51:41] anything bothers you close your eyes go
[51:43] on just praise the Lord you will get
[51:45] your blessing Jesus told Nicodemus once
[51:48] you see except a man be born again by
[51:50] the Spirit he cannot see the kingdom of
[51:52] God in other wise he made this you
[51:55] cannot understand the kingdom of God
[51:57] until you are born again so you have to
[52:01] make an effort first to accept it and
[52:03] then after you have accepted it you will
[52:07] be able to understand it how do you
[52:10] accept the world by saying Amen if a
[52:13] preacher preached something and you
[52:14] agree with it say Amen yeah okay is he
[52:17] fees busy keeping the devil a kick you
[52:19] go amen
[52:20] okay if this you is falling asleep don't
[52:22] say I mean don't okay but enter in
[52:26] because if you agree with it then you
[52:28] say I mean you stay awake when you
[52:31] listen to him and you say yeah that's it
[52:32] preacher you stay awake you entering in
[52:35] you taking you your show then you
[52:37] putting it behind the oxcart and you
[52:39] pushing and you're pushing because we're
[52:41] gonna get there but if you just stand to
[52:43] the next go that one could push harder
[52:45] and that one might do in the air you can
[52:47] pull a bit better and where you gonna
[52:48] stay the oxcart is moving you staying
[52:51] right there you haven't moved the meter
[52:53] you ain't getting any way with God you
[52:55] just staying right there and now this is
[52:58] where I want to go through this and I
[53:00] want to tell you this brother branham
[53:01] tells the story about the banner boy who
[53:03] knows the story was about better banner
[53:04] boy man I love this story and then he
[53:08] says about this is he is this watering
[53:10] hole the way the boys used to go and
[53:11] swim it says an after school in the
[53:13] summertime so when the spring starts and
[53:15] it goes into summertime they would run
[53:18] to this big pool of water to go and swim
[53:20] he says an Indy was this guy called the
[53:22] banner boy so how to choose the banner
[53:24] boy is the last one in is the next
[53:27] banner boy okay so if you're lost in the
[53:30] river or last in this in this pool
[53:32] you're the banner boy name
[53:33] so that means you have to go in first
[53:35] now the job of the banner boy is to
[53:38] check if the water's okay okay so
[53:41] brother Branham says he wasn't even the
[53:42] banner boy but he was the first one in
[53:44] amen
[53:45] so he says while the others are trying
[53:47] to get me clothes of man he was already
[53:48] in the water isn't you'll running you
[53:50] jump in and he says because the springs
[53:52] comes off the mountains the water the
[53:54] water comes off the mountains are flows
[53:56] into this big pool and the waters
[53:58] ice-cold so the sign was when you jump
[54:01] in and you're in the water you go this
[54:04] water is cold man because you need to
[54:06] know warn the other guys cuz you're the
[54:07] banner boy you raise up one finger and
[54:10] you go and that means hey boys treat
[54:12] carefully the water's cold
[54:14] okay so coming slowly but the next time
[54:18] when you run in you jump in the wood and
[54:19] the wood is nice and fine you raise up
[54:21] two fingers and you go boys the water's
[54:24] fine you could just jump on him okay so
[54:27] it's so is it with the gospel today the
[54:30] water is fine you can jump on in but you
[54:34] just have to give yourself don't be the
[54:37] one standing next to the river looking
[54:39] at this and going oh shoot I should not
[54:40] just jump in man jump in the gospel is
[54:45] fun man I never have one boring moment I
[54:47] think brother Andy said it I can't be
[54:49] bored I'm a Christian yeah you know if
[54:52] the Lord shows you a little thought man

[55:21] if you want to jump in you got a choice
[55:27] but you have to make the choice no
[55:30] preacher can help you make that choice
[55:32] no amount of words I tell you tonight
[55:35] young people and old people can make
[55:37] that choice you have to make it and what

[56:14] request you lift your hands to the Lord
[56:16] and you ask him for these phrases it's a
[56:18] very praising God and let's just all
[56:21] pray together but I want to ask you
[56:23] something when you prayed tonight to
[56:26] pray that the Lord will take your eyes
[56:28] and will give his eyes to you so when
[56:32] you look at things you'll see it
[56:33] different and if you ever look upon
[56:36] something that hurts your eyes look away
[56:39] because it hurts God's eyes as well amen
[56:43] so if you're looking at stuff you
[56:45] shouldn't look close your eyes and pray
[56:47] and say lord help me through this I
[56:49] don't want to look at it okay
