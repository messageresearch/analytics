me if i am not what you expected but um i pray that you that i'm led and that you are late tonight i pray that you um you you chew on the word that's been given has been a thought that uh that the lord's placed on my heart for a while um uh and i think it comes through my life sometimes as i as i look upon something slightly differently and this will this will be hopefully manifested through my little sermonate and for the kids i've got slides are you happy for all the kids 12 and under so that's brother armand and below yes yes praise the lord let's um maybe let's turn to our bibles i think that first slide this is the tire dahlia here we go thank you musicians you see how stressed i am i'm just holding on to the musicians here amen i was hoping this is the la double maybe might be here because she always plays that that nice song of um i see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life and then how it goes eyes [Music] promises and fulfillment all over my life all over my life i see the evidence i see what do you see with see with your eyes you look upon it you see the evidence how where's the evidence the evidence is all around us are you in turmoil are you stressed are you i'm straight here tonight for different reasons but out there in the world amen we've got peace we've got peace that passes all understanding and we've got testimony upon testimony of people that's in the workplace and that's just being themselves themselves as being the spiritual man and daughter that they are and they acknowledge that this there's a there's a higher being inside of them working taken over the soul and that's the one that's speaking and the people cannot fathom this why is this guy so so relaxed and there's there's times of turmoil and everything it's not going to get any better i'm sorry for that bubble bar burst but um this is a time to to look where are you looking okay and you'll see my title it'll come now um i i am afrikaans and english is my second language and me and the lord had a bit of a tussle and saying how do i put this title lord do i say are you looking do i say do you see do it and you'll see what i said was do you look do you look and hopefully it will all come together let's read the first let's read saint john 20 from about verse 11 but mary stand without attacker weeping as she whipped she stooped down and looked into this apoca and sea of two angels in white sitting the one at the head the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain and they say unto her women why who was thou whip is thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and they hear she's probably not speaking of angels of of people or the disciples or the apostles and i know not where they have laid him and when she had the safe uh she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not it was jesus jesus saith unto a woman why we bestow whom with secrets thou she supposing him to be the gardener saying unto him sir if thou born hence let tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away jesus saith unto her mary she turned around and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master may the reading of the word be blessed by our lord god almighty you might have your seats right hopefully this is not too there you go do you look um yes um that was that was the thought i got do you look and and because like i said i'm i'm a bit of a afrikaans thinker please don't hold that against me um it is basically what it comes down to what do do you look at your circumstances if i can start in that fashion do you look at at your god-given gift do you look towards where the trouble is coming from or do you look where are you looking where are you looking what are you looking at yeah now oh i played this in my mind and yeah please please just forgive me if it doesn't work out but i wanted to be a a little practical example can this go higher the crazy little maybe not that high it's wednesday night so we can be slightly more relaxed yes so mary comes in into the sepulcher into the tomb so that she stoops down she bows down and here's the angel sitting what were the angels talking about what would they think like that the one say to the other yes i actually really want to be out there jesus said we need to sit here and mary's gonna come in here like why would she come in here we told her jesus won't be here it's the third day it's past he's outside he's in the garden he's waiting she walks past him he goes here's mary what are you doing why are you weeping didn't you see him you know what was the conversation there between the angels saying i want to see mary's face on the outside i want to be there i don't want to sit here why did jesus say we need to sit here and now these angels are seeing the flesh just you know the natural just way looking look past now here comes mary out of the tomb and now this is important for me is and and this was a massive revelation for me probably almost here two years back when when brother ben read this and jesus just said mary and it turns back to her uh to to to to yeah to her to saying master rabboni so here she comes out of the and and she bumps into jesus and it's like oh sorry sorry apologies and walk but now she's all snot in tears because she's not seeing where she needs to look yeah you know she's not looking why why was she looking in the tomb why did she not believe the message of her l in due season right she should have had that revelation now he comes and he stops her now by the grace of god he will stop you where are you looking why are you looking there here am i amen and that's what i like about brother ryan's testimonial to say turn away to jesus this flesh this natural wants to go the opposite way so if you are on your way there you're gonna you're gonna get stuff in the way and you're gonna be you know ah the opposite think the opposite of this this flesh wants to go yeah there's things that's happening in the spiritual realm with with yeah just brothers and sisters in this congregation and i would sit in my natural and i go how did they get to that conclusion how why did they make that decision from a business from a personal from whatever but then i step back and i go but where am i looking i'm looking at what was i fed 39 years ago and for 39 years what was i fed in my traditions and cultures and denominations and all this kind of thing this is where you're supposed to look oh lord that's we so that's and and by the grace of god it was good i could i could speak to brother matthew a bit and um we had to have a clean cut so us coming from a denomination and all these views and all these peoples and interpretations and we have to have a clean cut and by the grace of god and by sister lundy's testimony she was seeking for that hunger seeking for that i've been baptized but something's not right something hasn't changed where's the new creation why am i not looking towards what this the holy living word is saying where i need to look why am i still not there but you were not correctly baptized so get yourself baptized get yourself married get in that marriage and be one with the maker the creator living breathing gospel that we have right in front of us oh yes mary at the tomb why why would you look into this old smelly tomb what what what what's your expectation what would you find in that too a tomb is for burial a tumor is for dead people okay looking at the sorry this is slightly segueing i don't even have it in my notes but the pyramids everyone's raving about the pyramid to build there it's a burial site for all these pharaohs and all that so why right in the middle of the pyramid they talk about enoch circle the egyptians talking about enoch circle and i want to tell you what are you looking where are they looking do they look at the right thing right they're seeing this pyramid and and again it's the egyptians it's pharaoh it's egypt it needs to it must be because no one could build that um brother lonnie uh sorry lonnie i've got lonnie that's coming brother donnie reagan has a has got a real good sermon around enoch the stonemason and i can highly highly recommend that but what were they looking at so a few quick examples and and and i want to say let's take a team sport again so here i was standing in the you know we're gonna run out now onto the field and there's the other team and i'm here and uh my captain is motivating us and saying come on boys you can do it we can win this and i'm standing there this guy's seven foot how long am i going to tackle him no and there's my circumstances yeah i'm not seeing maybe he's a fat or blob i'm just seeing this tall how am i gonna tackle them you're not thinking maybe you can run around and maybe you've got the energy to outlast in your 80mm or 90 minutes and you you you've got fitness you've got endurance you can run that race keep your eyes on the prize little ones eyes on the price the price that was paid and eyes on the prize where are we going yep all right just imagine noah building the ark okay we know all the story of noah building the ark but the lord says there's gonna be rain whoa whoa whoa whoa rain lord what is rain lord how am i going to explain this to the people where's this rain coming from what clouds what is so imagine the complexity of his situation in his time but he was not looking there he got that promise by faith and said there we need to we need to get over this we're going to get through this it's going to take a bit of a while and he just stood fastly built that ark because there was a promise so where was he looking do you look do you look towards that look towards your theophany and that's what i want to say mary you know sometimes if you're looking at that tomb sorry i'm taking back you're looking at the tomb and you bump into this if you are focused on your tomb right on your on your old nature focused on that and it's getting closer i'll get to that now maybe jumping ahead but focusing there and all of a sudden oh oh sorry sorry sorry that could be your theophany you're bumping against like the prophet saying now you're missing it and now you can't step into that one one tier higher that one level higher that one step closer to you being the perfect statue of a man right moses in the desert for how long how long did he tread and he knew a promise where was he looking at the desert at the sandals at the the clothes that's gonna there was a promise amen it was made at the saith walk that light walk that way where do you look there was a light there for them to look at so what causes us not to look or what causes us not to look away to jesus i like that sort of a play there i don't know what you call that in english but look a way to just almost sounds like the opposite to what you're actually supposed to but you have to do this look away but look towards jesus i like that i like that please do that examples all right so in my in my old life i would sit in the malls and i did not like malls so don't worry i was already converted back then from malls i do not like shopping sorry my wife knows this and bless the lord he's given me a wife that doesn't like shopping as well we get along swiftly so so well so i would sit there and stare at the people like the people just amazed me what were they what were they talking about oh that one is going to be in trouble when he gets home oh that one is going to get a box slow and they give you and they didn't get their lollies you know i would always watch that and brother and paul quickly touched on it the the people and what they wore in the malls is also that's a bit of a a mini fashion show as well going around there so if you in your in your right mind you would be looking at the ground you would not be looking at anyone out there because it's just absolute fulf right now the new me now i'm looking and and and the lord said sweat on your bowel you will be working i have to go to work i have to walk into the reserve bank i have to be wherever i have to be and along the way on the train wherever walk it's everywhere so like brother said i'm gonna bump my head if i just walk around like this and all but now when i see something or someone i look beyond what is that entrapment i'm looking there's a soul that's just missed what they were looking at what they were supposed to look at and she or he found the the the she they know the cause of it they they're still just looking at it because the natural manner will get there now is is easy the natural man is easy to slip back into so if you look away you need to walk away you need to you need to get away from that old you old nature all thinking right and thinking the opposite now i'm praying i'm saying lord touch that heart touch that soul where i am and where i'm standing i do not deserve this they they are in bondage free them yes i've got that sovereign grace now here with me they can have it please lord i don't know who's going into the rapture or not i need to sow the seed and like our watch tonight i said we can eat much we can we can we can drink too much we can do it but we can't pray enough so wherever you go watch your walk wherever the lord leads you we're looking you pray amen wherever you're looking pray your old nature so your old nature is always is is always still close behind you so let's go to that next slide um if you will so that was mary at the tomb crying definitely a heartfelt cry definitely in sorrow because now jesus is off the scene now the prophet's off the scene now we are walking alone are we sitting and are we moping are we crying or are we getting up and not looking into this and stooping down into the smelly tomb tomb but standing up and facing the other way so the other slide please do i have to click i actually do have the clicker sorry about that and i think it works if i switch it on there we go praise the lord she turned away to look towards jesus she looked up her redemption was nigh yeah amen why would you look into the tomb and look how close the two are to each other it is so close just just identify it just acknowledge in your heart the lord this old nature this old me the the way i'm turning or looking um may it be towards you the opposite of the what this old natural nature want to go so let's read this you must be born again that's the title of the sermon so in order if you're born again and got a new parent then you've got a new nature the old nature's dead and you've got a new nature you once was going one way now you're going another way and you once was going this way down and now you're going this way up praise the lord your affections are set on things on on above a new affection you don't love the things of the world no more your affections of god you don't care what means man says um how they laugh at you and say you old model or whatever it is like you don't care because you're born of above and do your affections are set on things above god's not ashamed of you and you not ashamed of him that's right so read the 11th verse 11th chapter of hebrews and i implore you to go and read that i read that again it is incredible by faith moses by faith abraham by faith it is all with that spiritual eye with that where are you looking do you look do you look where you should supposed to look look into the heavenlies look past your see your goal man eyes on that price yes um just our people in that day how they did and they wondered about the sheepskins and deserts and destitutes and everything else of whom the world's not even worthy of see read it it'll be good for you and you can see there what people when their nature has changed what happens they were stoned they were sawn asunder they tempted was slain with the sword they wondered about the sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted tormented did they care did they care i'll read you there what was that verse 37 they were stoned that's 37 um 38 of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and in denzen caves and all and these all having obtained a good report through faith to receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect and guess what the next chapter of hebrews the title is running the christian race please i implore you go and read this and i'm preaching to myself much more than to you don't you worry okay so why now back to the young ones let's yep why do we want to place something in your heart and and make you understand that you need to build your character in jesus christ among believers i'm in this church in this fellowship not this fellowship anywhere where when people with like-minded faith comes together and they rub um proverbs 17 17. iron sharp is iron but we are sharp sharp irons if we sharp each other then we can cut right but we don't cut with malice we don't cut the stripe we don't cut with that all things in the past right love is corrective sometimes it hurts but that's good that's why we're saying to you young ones why do we want you to to come here expected plant your seed receive something here come with the expected heart lord i've got this big old hole in my heart just fill it fill it with your goodness fill it with your temperance meekness i need some love and suffering come here because now i'm saying to you if you come to a point and you are turning now let's turn the other way because i was saying that was towards jesus let's stand this way something is turning you towards this way but like i said now you were here you were praying you were fasting you were in the sunday school you were singing songs you were opening up your heart to be to receive and something or this this world something and and that circumstances changing your your way of seeing where are you looking do you look now if this is your old nature if your old nature is temperance and love and joy and peace now you are surrounded by the heavenlies you are surrounded by jesus so now when we as a parent and tell me trust me we fail parents fail we fail right we are in this fleet as much as you are right but if you come and you build your character in jesus christ character so your nature right yes you're born in sin shaped iniquity speak coming into the world speaking lies but now your old nature doesn't know anything bad per se your old nature is now all of a sudden um just queen is just just thirsting for something your old nature is now built on all these um love joy peace long suffering temperance meekness your old nature so what is your new nature gonna be that's where we want you to be that's when the quickening comes if your old nature is right behind you and i'll show you now even the prophet was had a tremendous old nature that he had to keep in front of that he hated uh one step ahead you know as they say and we've all got that but now to prevent you from trapping to prevent you from turning away to an old nature that's filthy that's dirty that doesn't have any substance and won't be able to lift you up if we can get you here to establish a character in jesus christ and this nature of old nature if i can call it that because you are 18 11 13 years old that old nature won't be that far off the track as your mum and your dad was now all of a sudden your old nature could be almost a foundation not that we turn away turn towards the old nature but you've got a safety net now you you are being enclosed you're being um i don't want to say trapped but you are surrounded you are surrounded by that's that nice song um surrounded by you you're surrounded by jesus christ no matter where you're turning so the lord will go do you look do you look do you see you would start seeing things way in advance way in heavenly vision like an eagle and that's why we are we are so sometimes harsh sometimes hard sometimes we come over as uh bring your mind every day we we just want you to experience the love of god and we can go rest we can rest the weary soul can rest lord my sons they don't need to have to go through what i've gone through we can have a a stone here a rock of revelation where they can get rooted so when they fall lord they know exactly what to do get up brother mathen said there's race that we're running he falls daily do not stop getting up do not stop getting up get up run again you will fall repent from your remissions you will get up you will run again run this race how many times do you think have people fall just from this word we can talk about david we can talk about moses any of you murdered someone they've fallen they got up they ran the race do not stop getting up get up i'll quickly show you the the clip of brother lonnie it'll go um straight into it of the old character by old nature i quickly ran off a slide in the back room while ago and i don't think it's going to project it's a slide of this picture which was the seven licks of fire the supernatural picture taken in grass valley california and i don't think it's going to project what i want projected so i did a little ink addition on it right there and if you ever get this picture in your hand again you can look for that little picture there because it didn't show up on this transparency but i've told you before but i've never shown you the picture i was talking with brother sidney jackson one day prophet from south africa that was a close friend of brother branners and his brother he said brother branham took this picture and he says brother sydney he says look close behind me on the platform holding up this this picture and he says look closely behind me he says do you see that face that looks like an old indian chief or something and brother jackson says yes i see that said i've never noticed that there before he says that's my old nature he said it's always there to haunt you he says when he says when you receive christ and his word now i'm going to do my hands the way sydney did because it's very significant and he said that's the way brother branham did he says when you stand and receive the word for the hour the revelation of the hour he says that holy ghost fire comes down into your soul and he says burns out the old nature he didn't say a word but you got a picture it loses the position of dominion but it moves to a place of influence it cannot make you do anything but it'll talk to you as if it's in the same place that it always was but it has no power and he says that he says my old nature looks like an indian chief because he says because my mother was half indian now if that happened to a prophet that's what happens to every child of god the old nature is burned out of you and your new nature is god but the old nature is always there to hunt you it'll try to condemn you over the things that it did in your body are you following me so consequently that's why god says you are a new creature why because the control tower inside is brand new absolutely new and didn't do a thing against god and that's why you can stand justified before god as if you never did it because you the real you the predestinated soul from god you did not do it it was that amen amen you can go back to that slice sistertalia um see if i can see there we go thank you it's amazing hey i mean old nature will always be there now god bless brother lanier that's that's that guy had a tremendous life his t stephanie as well um he's he's run a race and can't wait to see him and glory um how do we get away from this old nature this old nature that sit in its ways doesn't know any better just here behind you i've got a few things that maybe the the kids you could know this is now time for you to to sort of interact into okay what can you see there let's start with reuben what do you see do you know what car that is reuben the ferrari there you go you petrol head is he is he is he in the right place is is that is that is that a good place to be in it's not a good place to be and why not what's wrong with that picture where's lelia what's wrong with that picture okay is that called built for four by fouring do you think it's like brother albert's guy he's got like a mean big 4x4 it'll do slightly better than that guy right slightly so i'm also a bit of a petrol hit that's a rear-wheel drive car what will happen if we put big wheels on it will that then go will that help probably to a point maybe you'll get maybe five meters further right and that is where that's where the old nature will go now we'll get through this we'll get to it let's change something let's change the i'm set in my ways i don't understand i don't know anything better but maybe let's check new wheels let's check new wheels new wheels the car the suspension the power delivery everything it doesn't have four-wheel driving it'll get only that far and you'll fall again right so when when i read when i read this you'll be born again you have to be born again that um and please go and read the rest of or or listen to this sermon you must be born again because it breaks down the the beautifully the sanctification the justification the the the fire of the of the baptism of the holy ghost in your life that you need to be new you need to be renewed okay do you think this vehicle is built purposely built to go a bit further than this vehicle i think so so immediately we can see this big chunky tires it's higher off the ground it's obviously got four-wheel drive it's got a little winch there in the front right so there's a few things that this vehicle is equipped for its circumstances now if someone would tell you we will we will drop a pin in russia and um you can choose your vehicle you want you can choose your vehicle um to get from this point to let's say i don't know tibet or maybe moscow or somewhere do you gonna choose your ferrari or are you gonna choose a vehicle that may be able to handle a bit more terrain than you you don't expect you don't know you don't know what's coming lord but if i'm equipped if i'm in the right vehicle if i've got the new nature and i've dressed in it i can go a bit further than i think my old nature will be able to take me and in closing purpose built one that will get you to the end doesn't matter the terrain that picture is brother armand's truck that is on an angle quite a interesting angle no we didn't take the picture skew he's in a ditch and he's in trouble so he's he's got the new nature he's got the new vehicle he's got the new creation he's got the nice tires that's the thing there's gonna thingy hey um but if we go back one there's a winch and there's something that can pull them out right still need to be equipped so sometimes we jump into the river we jump into the mud and say we are new creation we we are fervent we are we are zealous we're going to make this work but now we we we we we need to get filled by the holy ghost before we jump into the mud right so more equip equip us a bit more right now this leads in and and you can have this for free i i only realized this while i was preparing here tonight is so there's our beloved friend mr chris eddie god bless mr chris um you will see there's a there's a where's the um little marker here is it that one here we go this this there's a cable a rope going this way and from his vehicle that is his winch here this way and it comes together here on a tree so we put that on a tree now month was quite stuck so we put it on a tree on the winch and now all the guys that know science and all that kind of thing you are doubling the force that you can now winch with the with the winch block what do you call that winch block pulley pulley something and physics and he will pull us out right so do you look we are standing and looking at our vehicle because it needs to move out towards this this way it needs to get out so we can continue on we actually just get to our wives because they are starting to be panicky and all our sites so i'm standing there on the on the left here on the on the little um uh step because it is sort of tipping over so i'm standing on here there's a little tree just here and we're leaning towards me and our josh and all our focus brother armand me josh chris he's focused we need to move forward so all our focus is to get um that little black speck there full of mitsubishi all right that's where we focused on so we're looking there and you hear this winch is crunching and cr moaning slowly progressing and we're like are we moving or are we not are we still looking and we turn around and his vehicle is starting to move forward towards the tree so he's winching himself towards the tree and we're not moving an inch so okay plan b plan b listen up closely plan b young ones not plan b is just the next step right the next step is the back of this vehicle we took another nine ton snatch strap or a toe strap around another tree now we anchoring it now we're anchoring it me and brother kibin we're fishing now two days ago we're fishing we're fishing and i only thought of it today but i'm thinking you know joshua jonathan the boys jaden they're going into the water and casting and we expecting to catch this big you know snapple or kawaii or maybe maybe a kingfish but if the kingfish starts to wrestle this little guy he will pull him into the water because where's he anchored where is he he's just in the water with this fish that is almost his size he will pull him under the water now we're anchoring this four by four onto another tree all of a sudden our focus is now look at the tree the car everything looks anchored the winch is still working okay turn turn away to jesus turn away now to the place where we will see movement we will get out of this little rut forgive me lord get me out of this little rut i tried lord i failed i fell please get me out of this rut do not do not stay down do not stay down and that i want to tie into why is fellowship so important why is fellowship here amongst us amongst brothers and sisters so important because that is where you will get rooted you will get anchored so if you cost and you and this the the preacher here at the front is pulling you well is preaching and you are pulling you've got something to hold if this preacher is throwing a big old marlin your way you can handle it because you're rooted you are fellowshipping here you are anchored in the word you know where you stand you're convinced you're concerned you can you can by the grace of god you can handle the thrust the big the weight that's coming towards you because you anchored you are rooted you can now pull on bigger things you can start eating bigger things take bigger chunks go regurgitated during the week and pray important meditated i'm preaching to myself take more on board so fill that big old hole in your heart with substance with a i don't know marlin steak is that anything oh yeah fishing pulling and um that is basically what i want to close on so the the big fresh pieces of spiritual food that could shake your being right that will test your foundations and test your routing fellowship with one another other other other fellowships other brothers other sisters people passing by sitting down and and and as brother mathen says chewing on the fat that that's when you that's when you can see are you pulling are you are you rooted are you lord what you've shown me and the revelation that i've received i can stand strong by the grace of god and you can feed me lord and this is how we fellowship this is how we build each other up we're not breaking each other down we're not there to try and knock each other off we're there to to to test the strength together right we're all soldiers in the faith and we fight for the same same cause the same outcome the same way forward so do you look where are you looking do you looking do you look at the right thing praise the lord so we've got a few we've got a few prayer requests um brother ben is mentioned um uh png brother they are in a phase where they're going to trying to reconcile with the old denominational church now um yes where are we looking so we are looking at um our foundation is set our we are convinced that we are concerned that where brother imos is coming from or came from out of the denomination and got a nice clean cut and is pressing on these people are trying to come and and and understand um and please correct me if i'm wrong understand why are we what we are yes why we've got the i am in us they cannot fathom this because they've been looking towards this whole denominational layer of things and and and stuff that's been force-fed to them so these churches are coming together so we need to pray fervently that they meet they meet and they've got a a solid foundation a anchor point uh a center point a pivot that they can talk around and pray about and i know brother he was probably going to preach it sound like please please keep them in in your prayers we've got a few that's not here tonight we'll pray for them um every anyone that's in sickness and uh and body um god bless you brother john i saw you this evening it's nice to see you here you're probably building in more tiny more tiny homes with anything finishing up that i'll make some notes here if there's any um any any prayer requests yes for a place to say oh yes yep so the place got sold where brother ben both john and marian was living and they they all need a place for a place to stay yes just need to spell right that's good that's good yeah let's pray that he's his legs don't give in and keep on running awesome revolt outreach so this uh this coming saturday's outreach in otaki um so it'll be good to have you all have your support there your prayers for them if you can't be there any help is needed need a few musicians and maybe technicians um yeah is there anything else brother phil i want to speak on your behalf look the devil is going to attack you right we've established that we've also also established that we hate him he doesn't like us too much but that's okay because we made our choice so yes it might not look like it's getting easier but we will not give in we will not fall and stop getting up reuben yes yep another thing is we need to sow the seed we don't have to win souls by the grace of god if we win a soul because he was working and equipping us in the right time in the right place praise god but sower seed be your your life needs to be a testimony of um of the lord's goodness sing worship okay so i i probably suggest that we all pray together i'll start praying and then in your in your own please lift up um prayer is so important though um i've read it again it's just that um with much incense the angels came in the relation with the prayers of the saints so they had to they had to come with more incense because of the weight of the of the prayers of the saints so don't don't think your prayer doesn't count it does the great economy of god for all the prayers come together um things will happen believe it okay i'll stop praying lord jesus i am absolutely nothing nothing without you and me lord no matter what i feel no matter what i hear i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i look and it seems like it's broken i'll lay a hallelujah i'll lay a hallelujah [Music] [Music] he's a miracle working god a miracle working death a miracle working death [Music] [Music] keeping god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle in god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god a miracle working [Music] you
