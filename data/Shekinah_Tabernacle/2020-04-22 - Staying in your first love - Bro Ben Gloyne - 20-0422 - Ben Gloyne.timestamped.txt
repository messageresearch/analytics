[1:06] you
[1:07] [Music]
[1:27] okay hello everyone welcome to zoom
[1:34] Kitsch wave if you can hear me um how is
[1:43] everyone doing wave if you're good wave
[1:47] if your bed I'll just check the other
[1:52] screens so um it's it's nice to be able
[2:01] to gather albeit it's a unique
[2:04] experience gathering in separate places
[2:06] it's not quite the same as I'm being a
[2:11] church admittedly I did sneak into
[2:13] church the other day to get a guitar
[2:15] lead and um I must admit I felt really
[2:20] good being in church again I missed it I
[2:22] thought man it's nice being in this this
[2:24] place you know the sanctuary the place
[2:26] that we've set aside for the Lord and
[2:28] you know I thought I can't wait till we
[2:30] can be back in here and gather together
[2:31] again in person and you know we're very
[2:35] privileged in this day and age that we
[2:37] can we've got access to a lot of places
[2:40] why we can have motor vehicles and go
[2:41] and see a lot of people you know I think
[2:43] back from when and pools they you know
[2:45] it for them to go to another area was it
[2:48] was a big deal you know like if it was
[2:50] five hundred kilometres away or a
[2:52] thousand kilometres that he would they
[2:55] would plan the trip a year in advance
[2:56] and think maybe the next summer I'll go
[2:58] and was at the Brisbane up here so but
[2:59] they had it a lot harder than we do
[3:01] whereas weekend you know we can in New
[3:03] Zealand we can get in our car in the
[3:05] morning and almost was that anybody in
[3:06] the even time be any any Brethren's
[3:09] health's and the whole of the north
[3:10] island and the south island almost the
[3:12] same but um I think at this time we you
[3:17] know
[3:17] when you there's often the saying that
[3:19] you don't know what you've got till it's
[3:20] gone and hopefully that's not we don't
[3:22] have to lose things not like the law
[3:24] took it from us but you know we I
[3:25] believe when we all get back to
[3:27] fellowship will really appreciate you
[3:28] know when the doors open like brother
[3:29] Branham said you know and you've got
[3:30] Christ in your heart you can't wait for
[3:31] the doors to open you know to be there
[3:33] to fellowship but um in the meantime

[29:04] everybody praise the Lord okay so
[29:06] in Revelation chapter 2 I'm gonna read
[29:08] verses one down to verse five and it
[29:12] says here unto the Angel of the Church
[29:16] of Ephesus write these things saith he
[29:18] that holdeth the seven stars in his
[29:20] right hand who walketh in the midst of
[29:23] the seven golden candlesticks I know thy
[29:25] works my labor of my patience and how
[29:27] they all can it's not beard in which
[29:29] you're evil and has tried them which say
[29:31] they are apostles and are not and has
[29:33] found him liars and is born and has
[29:36] patience and for my namesake has labored
[29:39] and has not fainted nevertheless I have
[29:42] somewhat against thee because thou has
[29:45] left my first love remember therefore
[29:47] from whence thou art fallen and repent
[29:48] and do the first works or else I'll come
[29:51] unto thee quickly and will remove thy
[29:53] candlestick from out of his place except
[29:56] thou repent let's go down to judge's and
[30:00] we're gonna read the first six verses of
[30:03] chapter six of Judges and I mean who's
[30:08] who's happy to be a Christian tonight
[30:13] God is true to all generations at all
[30:15] time eternal amen got this you're I mean
[30:20] so we just got to read judges 6 in
[30:22] verses 1 to 6 very familiar piece of
[30:25] scripture to all I trust it's the it's
[30:27] the story of Gideon we're just gonna
[30:28] bring a bit of a context out of this
[30:30] she said the children of Israel did evil
[30:32] in the sight of the Lord and the Lord
[30:34] delivered them into the hand of Midian 7
[30:36] years and the hand of Midian prevailed
[30:38] against Israel and because of the
[30:39] Midianites the children of Israel made
[30:42] them the dens which are in the mountains
[30:44] and caves and strongholds you'd say they
[30:47] went into lockdown because the enemy was
[30:48] around and as it was and so it was when
[30:52] Israel had soand that the Midianites
[30:54] came up and Amalekites and the children
[30:56] of the east even they came up against
[30:58] them and they encamped against them and
[31:00] destroyed the increase of the earth till
[31:02] they come unto Gaza and lift no
[31:04] sustenance for Israel neither sheep to
[31:07] ox nor ass for they came up with the
[31:09] cattle and their tents and they came as
[31:11] grasshoppers for multitude for both they
[31:14] and their camels were without number
[31:15] they entered into the land to destroy it
[31:18] and Israel was greatly
[31:20] impoverish because the Emidio nights and
[31:22] the children of Israel cried unto the
[31:25] Lord amen let's bow heads in a word of
[31:27] Prayer Lord Jesus lovely Lord Jesus we
[31:31] come to you this this our Lord we just
[31:33] asking that you you will touch our
[31:35] hearts touch our lives like only you can
[31:37] father may you Lord come to our address
[31:40] tonight Lord may you minister Lord your
[31:43] word to our hearts O God father we want
[31:45] to thank you Lord that you're our God
[31:47] you're the one we've come to worship
[31:48] Lord it's it's wonderful truly to see
[31:50] each other but Lord we have come to see
[31:52] you this night Lord we've come to come
[31:54] into your presence and I just pray O God
[31:56] may you just move on every heart Lord
[31:58] may what you said the service service to
[32:01] accomplish might accomplish it Lord in
[32:02] our lives father please grind it bless
[32:04] the blood everyone who will hear this I
[32:06] pray may you just take control of the
[32:08] service we we yield that we surrender
[32:10] our lives our beings all we are into
[32:12] your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[32:15] Amen
[32:16] I mean God bless you all you may have
[32:18] your seat I wonder if I could if I could
[32:21] title this list tonight I'd like to
[32:24] title it about being restored to our
[32:27] first love now we read here in the book
[32:30] of Acts where where the Ephesian you
[32:32] know the ephesian church age we
[32:34] understand it had not started the day of
[32:36] Pentecost my feels a span of time
[32:38] brother Graham tells us where the church
[32:40] was under filed an hour walk in the
[32:42] fullness of the word that they had but
[32:45] then there came an antichrist burden and
[32:47] the church actually fell from a position
[32:49] and we can see this and in what we read
[32:53] here in Revelation chapter 2 because
[32:56] even though the Lord commends them for
[32:58] their for their works and for their
[32:59] labor and for their patience and you
[33:01] know how they couldn't bid in which
[33:02] you're evil and you know thou has tried
[33:04] to him say their apostles that have not
[33:06] found them liars and has born and has
[33:08] patience and for my name's sake thou has
[33:10] labored I mean I mean labored have not
[33:12] fainted so he's saying you've done a lot
[33:14] of good things but he said nippleless I
[33:16] have somewhat against thee because thou
[33:18] hast left thy first love so even with me
[33:22] when the first church age started when
[33:25] the Ephesian age actually started that
[33:26] there
[33:27] that the bride in that age had already
[33:29] fallen from a position which was being
[33:32] in their first love and and we know
[33:34] brother Bram would preach and messages
[33:36] like paradox in 1965 and he'd say we
[33:39] have come to an Ephesians again and I
[33:41] believe that that we just wouldn't be
[33:43] restored to to wear this ephesian church
[33:46] is and wood and wood and and wood you'll
[33:50] be restored to this fallen state even
[33:52] though they had many great things but we
[33:54] would be restored back to our first love
[33:56] that divine love could now flow through
[33:58] the body of Christ once again and we
[34:00] know that this message restores us back
[34:03] to the original gospel it's not another
[34:04] gospel that we have received but we have
[34:07] been restored back before even the
[34:09] church I just started where the church
[34:11] was walking with God amen in a state of
[34:14] I believe divine love so the bedless not
[34:18] that we would just be restored to our
[34:20] first love but we would stay in our
[34:21] first love because they had the Holy
[34:23] Ghost like we do we know that the Holy
[34:25] Ghost was poured out through seven
[34:27] Church ages short manifests at different
[34:29] parts of the word as the you know we
[34:31] know the church went down your diet
[34:33] under persecution went underground came
[34:35] forth and a Reformation and so on but
[34:37] all down through the seven Church ages
[34:39] the Holy Ghost was manifesting himself
[34:40] but we know that in the evening time
[34:43] he's put out in his fullness because
[34:45] there's nothing to restrict him moving
[34:46] anymore cuz all the creeds and doctrines
[34:48] of man have been taken out of the way
[34:51] and brother Baron would even say that
[34:52] this this entire message releases the
[34:54] Holy Ghost upon people we were restored
[34:57] back to the day of Pentecost into the
[34:59] condition the church was in I mean but
[35:01] so the battle is now sure we have we
[35:04] have been restored to that place but
[35:06] then there's the battle can we stay in
[35:08] our first love and continue walking with
[35:10] God because he did not say they lost
[35:12] their salvation they still had their
[35:14] victory they still it overcoming their
[35:16] age but they fell from a position I mean
[35:19] and we don't want to just be a a people
[35:22] where we come in rejoicing praising God
[35:24] have our first love and then we fall
[35:27] from it and remain there so I want to I
[35:30] just want to basically ask these three
[35:35] questions and then answer these three
[35:36] questions and then hopefully this will
[35:38] come out in the right way but you know
[35:40] the
[35:40] what does it mean to have your first
[35:42] love there should be a good question to
[35:43] ask and what is the condition of someone
[35:46] who has lost their first love and what
[35:49] is the way back they meant that some you
[35:52] know I think that's a good question
[35:53] because of course we look at history and
[35:55] say well they they they think they left
[35:57] their first love we say well what's a
[35:59] person that has their first love what's
[36:00] a person that's fallen from their first
[36:02] love now I'm not talking about people
[36:03] who are lost I mean found and lost so
[36:05] I'm not talking about that they still
[36:06] had the Holy Ghost but they fell from
[36:08] that place of first love and we can see
[36:10] that the big thing they I believe what
[36:12] caused them to fall from that first love
[36:14] as you can see that the battle that they
[36:16] were facing is that Antichrist burned in
[36:19] their rage you know as as the Lord when
[36:21] he admonished that church and he says I
[36:23] know thy works in my labor I'm just
[36:25] repeating this for emphasis but I want
[36:27] you to see that they were battling
[36:29] against something and God was addressing
[36:30] it I know thy works and thy labour and
[36:33] thy patience and how they're not thou
[36:35] can us not be them what your evils they
[36:37] they would fight this do these people
[36:40] who had these religious Antichrist
[36:41] spirits and he says and he says thou has
[36:44] tried them so they've tried them by the
[36:46] word but say there are apostles they're
[36:48] saying they're original and are not and
[36:50] has found them liars and have fought and
[36:53] has patience and for my name's sake has
[36:56] labored and has not fainted so they're
[36:58] under a labor they're under a pressure
[37:00] they're under a burden and that burden
[37:02] was fighting this religious bird we know
[37:04] the you know the deepest wounds that
[37:06] ever come to a believer are not from the
[37:08] world can we all say Amen it's not it's
[37:12] not that Jesus was wounded in the house
[37:14] of his friends and was those he
[37:16] considered to be his closest ones
[37:18] wounded of the most and is the same down
[37:20] through every age is those ones that are
[37:22] that you'd consider a brother or a
[37:25] sister in the Lord and maybe they are
[37:27] amen but but it's those ones you have
[37:29] the ones you love the most
[37:30] we're in the most but we need to we need
[37:33] to combat not you know we need to
[37:36] withstand those things and not just shut
[37:39] down you know I was going to call this
[37:40] being coming out of spiritual lockdown
[37:43] right I mean because you know what
[37:45] happens is like like when we go into
[37:47] Gideon you'll see it is that is that
[37:49] them Israel did evil in the sight of the
[37:51] Lord but I'll say this
[37:53] wasn't all of Israel I don't believe had
[37:54] an idol in the house someone would have
[37:57] still been true genuine believers but in
[37:59] the Midianites came in and then they
[38:02] just said well we're just going to go
[38:03] onto lockdown because the enemy's just
[38:04] just just moving around our land we're
[38:06] being hurt too much who've been under
[38:08] too much trouble and so they made Dean's
[38:10] in caves and they just locked themselves
[38:11] away that was still Israelites they were
[38:14] still living in the Promised Land but
[38:16] they had gone until you could say
[38:17] spiritual lockdown and it's the same
[38:19] thing with you and I people can so so
[38:21] when you're in your first love all you
[38:24] care about is him right you're not
[38:26] worried about what others doing in the
[38:27] church you don't care about you know
[38:29] good times bad times you give the give
[38:32] the Lord glory that's all you're about
[38:34] has been caught up with him it's it's
[38:35] staying in that relationship doesn't
[38:37] matter if you have it all or if you have
[38:39] nothing doesn't matter if you've lost
[38:40] your job lost your house you know
[38:42] doesn't matter what happens because
[38:44] you're in that first love all you care
[38:46] about is him you take a natural you take
[38:50] a natural relationship it doesn't matter
[38:52] if your spouse's you know has no money
[38:55] he doesn't have a job could be you know
[38:57] thick as a short plank you know you know
[38:59] it can be all the negative code it
[39:01] doesn't matter because you're not caring
[39:02] about the circumstances of your
[39:04] relationship that's not why you love the
[39:06] person you love them because of who they
[39:08] are yeah right and that someone who's in
[39:10] their first love they don't care about
[39:12] if things are going well things are
[39:14] going bad you just love the person
[39:17] hallelujah that's big in the first love
[39:19] it's same thing with the Lord I mean
[39:21] those are in their first love it doesn't
[39:22] matter if they know doesn't matter if
[39:24] you know you know the whole life is
[39:25] going sideways their children are going
[39:27] sideways their whole you know your
[39:29] everything around them is falling apart
[39:31] if they're in their first love they will
[39:33] they'll just love him anywhere they'll
[39:34] praise him anyway man yes amen so so
[39:38] they'd say you know I feel I'm just
[39:39] coming in behind brother nd service last
[39:41] Wednesday I mean the plumbers in the
[39:44] house and it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:45] he's gonna unplug the pipes hallelujah
[39:49] he's very good at doing those kind of
[39:51] things I mean three so it's those in
[39:53] their first love you take you take a
[39:55] natural couple they can have not even to
[39:58] sin stir up together
[39:59] doesn't matter where they are they are
[40:01] in love with each other you take brother
[40:03] Brownwood
[40:03] you know how he married those two
[40:05] couples one was very rich and one was
[40:07] very poor and then I you know a while
[40:09] later you know he went to see the rich
[40:11] ones and that was you know they had this
[40:13] big mansion and they had all this fancy
[40:14] stuff and you know he like ripped up to
[40:16] the house and look through the window so
[40:18] they are fussing at one another but he
[40:20] knocked on the door open the door they
[40:22] you know they put on this big front door
[40:24] hi how are you everything's so wonderful
[40:26] and you'd asked him you know how's
[40:27] things going house you know house merits
[40:29] and I said oh it's just wonderful as
[40:31] yeah we just loved each other real good
[40:33] and you know and it's just a front and
[40:35] it's because they didn't really love
[40:37] each other they had a physical
[40:39] attraction sure but it wasn't a real
[40:41] love because they had it all but they
[40:44] were fussing because of it you know she
[40:46] was dancing with the sky and all these
[40:48] things were happening around about them
[40:49] an hour they didn't really love each
[40:51] other but then he went down to where the
[40:53] poor couple were and they're living in a
[40:55] converted boxcar and and and she was on
[40:58] his lap and they had no like no money at
[41:01] all and and he was telling her you know
[41:03] I saw the stress in the stars walking by
[41:05] the shop I saw the stress in the window
[41:07] and I just would love to bark for you
[41:08] and you know you're they had nothing
[41:10] they had nothing but she said that's all
[41:12] right honey that don't matter you know
[41:13] they were in love and program didn't
[41:15] even go into the boxcar cause he's he
[41:17] saw everything was actually going real
[41:19] well for them why they stayed in their
[41:22] first love hello Lou yeah I mean it
[41:25] didn't you know you know they you know
[41:27] they loved didn't diminish I'll say I'd
[41:28] probably even got greater and it should
[41:30] be the same thing with our Lord you know
[41:32] we fall in love with him he becomes our
[41:34] everything I mean and then and then he
[41:36] walks with us through life's journey he
[41:38] wants to build a relationship with us
[41:40] hallelujah thing is once people lose
[41:44] their first love you could say in a you
[41:47] know in a in a natural relationship then
[41:50] it's about the you know how well their
[41:52] life is going to get his based on how
[41:54] much money they have the holidays they
[41:55] have all you know maybe he says why does
[41:58] he is tall that he always was that way
[42:00] but you know when you first married him
[42:01] you love them but then now you're
[42:03] annoyed because he's fat because all
[42:04] conditions now it's not the actual
[42:05] person right oh he's got a dumb job
[42:09] money already always had a dumb job but
[42:11] it doesn't matter to you at first but
[42:12] now matters because workers
[42:14] applause I'm just I'm just taking the
[42:16] woman you know woman's perspective you
[42:18] know you know but but you know at first
[42:21] those things never mattered but now
[42:22] edits why cuz you you still love him you
[42:25] know the woman still loves the man but
[42:27] but she has fallen from her first love
[42:29] we're nothing really mattered if follow
[42:32] me yeah where is everybody
[42:34] how we doing yeah amen so that's what
[42:41] happens when people lose their first
[42:43] love for the Lord things go sideways
[42:46] they get down you know they want you
[42:49] know and see they're just trusting him
[42:51] and worshiping him anyway walking with
[42:53] them anyway so uh you know this has
[42:55] happened and they get down and their
[42:57] relationships I feel you know that you
[42:58] know they become cold and withdrawn
[43:00] because you're unexpected things happen
[43:02] unexpected things always happen I mean
[43:04] but we don't want to go on to spiritual
[43:06] lockdown amen amen just like the
[43:09] children of Israel the Midianites came
[43:11] and they see it's just this I'll hide up
[43:13] on the hills this huxley this single you
[43:15] know you know hopefully it'll just it'll
[43:18] it'll blow over whatever ball we're just
[43:19] gonna go on the lockdown but it didn't
[43:21] help them none but that was still
[43:24] Israelites now living in the land now
[43:26] and they promised land but they weren't
[43:27] enjoying the benefit of it none and
[43:30] that's the same thing now we know this
[43:34] nation is in lockdown as while I was
[43:35] thinking along these lines now
[43:38] this nation now I just I just I just
[43:40] wrote some things down about this so
[43:43] this nations in lockdown and it's aw
[43:45] it's only just functioning right it's
[43:48] your God's a time when they decided this
[43:50] is essential so it's gonna continue this
[43:52] is not essential it's not going to
[43:54] continue and so and we're all in our
[43:56] homes and you know whatever more but the
[43:59] place is still functioning as a nation
[44:01] so we still have our prime minister
[44:02] we've got our parliament we've got the
[44:04] rule of law you know we've still got
[44:06] commerce going and all these things but
[44:08] it's in a very much smaller state then
[44:11] how it was before lockdown where you
[44:13] know trade was going on there was
[44:15] construction there was growth there was
[44:17] you know you know there was expansion
[44:19] there was all these things and it's the
[44:20] same thing so so what happened is you
[44:23] know beforehand previously so you know
[44:28] so so this this country's only just
[44:30] functioning and I'm sure we would all
[44:32] love to return to how it was
[44:35] who wants to come out of lockdown you
[44:41] know sure we would love to look how we
[44:44] used to you know go to the mall at your
[44:46] most loved going to the mall have school
[44:48] open again see our friends you know go
[44:50] to work like what you smell to your
[44:53] travel have church but that's just a
[44:55] natural look down yeah but it's a lot
[44:58] worse you know I'm afraid many believers
[45:00] are actually already in a spiritual
[45:02] lockdown and they went as a virtual
[45:05] lockdown before the physical lockdown
[45:06] ever started look Gina and and this may
[45:11] have been you know and some may may have
[45:15] been in lockdown for years where they
[45:18] used to be full of the joy of the Lord
[45:20] they used to travel around God's Word
[45:22] just have a Jubilee and it doesn't
[45:24] matter with Genesis of Revelation or or
[45:26] from faith as a substance all the way to
[45:28] communion you know I just have a Jubilee
[45:31] and rejoice and just have a good old
[45:32] time just like we should travel around
[45:34] this country almost like it used to be
[45:36] out you know just have our time I would
[45:38] say I feel like driving to Tarragona I'd
[45:41] get on my I get in my I'd say come kids
[45:44] come honey we're going and we'd go but
[45:47] now I can't do that and so I used to be
[45:49] when people are full of the Lord rejoice
[45:51] I say I'm just going to go up to
[45:52] heavenly places hallelujah I'm just
[45:54] gonna enjoy the word I listen to the
[45:55] seals
[45:56] you know I'm gonna read the scripture
[45:58] you know and and I just you just travel
[46:00] around God's Word have a Jubilee you
[46:02] know just enjoy the goodness of God and
[46:04] up in the high places look at the
[46:06] mountaintops living under the beach
[46:08] maybe go to this and you know you just
[46:10] like it's just like enjoying the nation
[46:12] you go on your your your your favorite
[46:14] places you go to it the same thing in
[46:16] the word you go to your favorite places
[46:17] just enjoy it again and again you know
[46:19] that's how that someone that's not in
[46:21] lockdown yeah but some but but
[46:24] unfortunately because you know because
[46:28] of hurt and pain because something has
[46:32] upset them people go into spiritual
[46:35] lockdown and instead of walking with God
[46:37] how they used to they just become
[46:40] withdrawn
[46:42] and then it only and then they only know
[46:44] it's on the essential Christian services
[46:46] that are operating in their life at the
[46:50] individual I'm young yes here we are
[46:55] Amen because thou has left our first
[46:56] love we want to get back they want to
[46:58] keep I mean people say you can't have a
[47:02] honeymoon your entire life brother
[47:04] Graham said you can be drunk on the
[47:05] Spirit of God every day of every day of
[47:07] your life to you lady moon the Prophet
[47:10] said I believe if I said look at me oh
[47:12] man
[47:16] hey man glory to God I mean we can never
[47:19] be too full of as good than same I mean
[47:22] so so because of pain and hurt people
[47:24] become spiritually withdrawn and now
[47:27] it's just the essential Christian
[47:28] services so they still go to church they
[47:31] will still come to camp maybe go to a
[47:33] convention even help on the sound now I
[47:35] tried to list everything in the church
[47:37] so you know so I'm not I'm not targeting
[47:41] anyone I'm just trying to have
[47:42] everything you know okay and this is not
[47:47] an order any any specific order by the
[47:49] way I'm on here to sit on you own okay
[47:54] so they may even help on the sound or in
[47:57] Sunday school or be in the band they may
[47:59] song lead or preach be it they can be
[48:01] part of the choir I mean they may be any
[48:04] part you know they may still be
[48:06] functioning in those roles but as
[48:08] brother Donnie Reagan said I mean
[48:10] there's a difference between working for
[48:12] God and walking with God all those
[48:15] things I listed that's just working for
[48:17] God but they start a walk I mean and we
[48:20] want to have that walk that walkers the
[48:22] most important thing you know you know
[48:24] Enoch walked with God and he was not not
[48:26] took I'm sorry so that's how we want to
[48:28] be we want to have a walk with God but
[48:30] the problem has been when someone goes
[48:32] into spiritual lockdown the essential
[48:34] Christian services are still operating
[48:36] they go to church they paint it I'd say
[48:38] they they do everything I just list it
[48:41] you know but then their walk with God
[48:43] become shut down and so there's a big
[48:48] difference between walking with God and
[48:50] work working for God during a lockdown
[48:55] get mothballed who knows what
[48:57] mothballing is I meant mothballing for
[49:00] those who maybe don't know the termas is
[49:02] like big machinery when it's not being
[49:04] used you know for a for a period of time
[49:08] it'll be kind of semi you know you know
[49:09] you know turned off it'll be shut down
[49:11] and and it'll be it'll be packed away in
[49:13] a certain way that data can be started
[49:15] up again later that's called mothballing
[49:17] and so what happens is a lot of
[49:21] unfortunately you know the joy the first
[49:26] loves that we had because of pain people
[49:29] mothball it or the shot that someone
[49:31] used to have it gets mothballed i'm or
[49:35] praising god or dancing in the spur or
[49:37] just being so full of his goodness it
[49:39] gets mothballed because this now
[49:41] essential Christian services are on the
[49:43] operating I mean you can look the part
[49:46] but but there's a very big difference
[49:48] between looking the part and being the
[49:50] part amen Oh God hey this cats both way
[49:55] so you know Oh amen you know I've been
[49:59] I've been down a road of just just being
[50:02] essential Christian services I've been
[50:05] there but I know what it's like to get
[50:07] out holy with you remember you are the
[50:12] one who's the government right of your
[50:14] own life I'm in your free will I mean
[50:18] that's the one who sees now we go down
[50:19] to level one well there's not even a
[50:21] problem the kids about the four four
[50:24] stage system a lockdown let's go back to
[50:27] where we were I mean so no I just want
[50:33] to show you a picture see see things get
[50:35] muffled and let's just see if I can do
[50:39] this real quick I want to show you uh
[50:40] I'm just gonna show you a picture here
[50:43] now who can see that yeah
[50:45] can everyone see that so so that's an
[50:47] edit I mean I mean an edit yeah sorry
[50:50] that's an etic now what happens is an
[50:53] edit is stuff that you used to use get
[50:56] stored away and so so things that maybe
[50:59] you know you know things like so for
[51:01] example there's a painting near this is
[51:03] some furniture you know there's
[51:04] different things
[51:05] maybe were they were they were part of
[51:06] the household though used every day they
[51:09] are essential part of the household you
[51:10] know maybe that painting there I don't
[51:12] know if you can quite see every role but
[51:14] it's got a lot of light shining on it
[51:15] maybe that had a you know a preeminent
[51:17] place you're over the mantelpiece but
[51:19] then something happened in the house
[51:20] where it was taken down and it was put
[51:23] into storage same thing with those
[51:25] chairs and you know those different
[51:26] things you can see in that picture what
[51:28] happened is there was a change in the
[51:30] household and things that were once very
[51:32] Valley but were actually hidden away and
[51:34] it's the same thing in the Christian
[51:36] life is that joy that yo-yo that
[51:38] abandonment to gardeners were that love
[51:41] for him you know they're rejoicing that
[51:42] shout amen crying you're crying in his
[51:45] presence and loving him of yo you know
[51:47] you know just opening the word a ten
[51:49] Dorp again some ministry and you hear
[51:50] the message and God begins to speak to
[51:52] you and God comes down into your house
[51:53] you begin to rejoice and yeah and what
[51:56] you look like it don't matter what you
[51:57] look like how they lose every glorious
[51:59] time and God's pouring it as revelation
[52:01] but then what happens is pain comes
[52:04] someone in the church someone close to
[52:06] you maybe someone on your family being
[52:08] sued maybe say snide comments and maybe
[52:10] you know try and make some little digs
[52:12] at you and say things about you and your
[52:14] you know other people that causes pain
[52:16] it causes warning and then what happens
[52:18] those things which he wants and loved to
[52:19] display just like that painting I mean
[52:22] the joy and the praise of God and loving
[52:24] him it gets put up in the Edit Amen now
[52:31] I just want to say this but then who's
[52:34] ever been in someone's attic edit and
[52:39] edit yeah
[52:41] please give a big and then and then and
[52:43] then you take out some treasures like
[52:44] you may be just a little kid maybe you
[52:46] go up into your grandparents place and
[52:48] you find this little thing and then you
[52:50] take it down them say it's a grandad
[52:52] grandma what's this you know I used to
[52:54] call my grandparents mum and dad mom and
[52:56] dad what's this and and - you don't know
[52:59] what it is but in but in you know they
[53:01] pick it up and then you can see almost
[53:03] the emotion just come over their faces
[53:05] because when that when an object is
[53:07] placed back in their hands all the
[53:09] memories associated with that object
[53:11] flood back and it's like they're back in
[53:13] that place once again hallelujah and I'm
[53:16] going to say the same thing
[53:18] I mean when it comes to coming out of
[53:20] coming out of spiritual lockdown we're
[53:23] going to go back into the edit and bow
[53:26] out our storage cupboards I mean about
[53:30] testimony I mean we're going to go back
[53:32] into our storage cupboard and pull out
[53:34] some testimonies and pull out that
[53:37] favorite of ours and then pull out
[53:38] whatever picture pull that when he saved
[53:41] you pull out when He healed you and pull
[53:42] out when he redeemed you and pull out
[53:44] when he ministered you know you know the
[53:46] word feel hard to pull out when a
[53:48] revelation became alive and going back
[53:49] emotions are pulled about it that's the
[53:52] mall and you know put the back on the
[53:53] mantelpiece and the next thing you know
[53:55] you because when those things when you
[53:56] when you hold them back up Holly oh when
[53:59] you hold it back up you begin to look at
[54:01] it the memory of what happened back
[54:03] there but it's a flood of three or
[54:05] sperner you begin to remember I mean the
[54:07] glorious things that happened in those
[54:10] and that's how you get out of a
[54:14] spiritual lockdown is when you begin to
[54:16] remember what God did for you when he
[54:18] ever going to take those treasures Holly
[54:20] you begin to hold them up to the light
[54:21] I've been keeping in to hold up the
[54:23] changes to the light and the light
[54:25] shines down you begin to see the details
[54:27] yeah wonderful they are
[54:28] hallelujah the next thing you know
[54:29] you're back in that moment might say you
[54:32] can't live on a memory no that's true
[54:35] but in a memory you're a memory can
[54:38] bring bring that you're a memory can
[54:40] bring that from being a memory into the
[54:42] present and then how amen Maureen we um
[54:53] I just want to go to this this this may
[54:56] seem you know a bit a bit a bit
[54:58] left-field but who knows what this
[55:01] picture is we've seen this picture this
[55:04] is this is the US Marines and they and
[55:07] he ran erasing the flag on Iwo Jima and
[55:10] and and this is one of the iconic photos
[55:13] of world war two and so here they are
[55:16] raising a standard and this is on a
[55:20] battlefield
[55:21] so so this is not something that was you
[55:23] know you know they actually raised this
[55:25] flag before this and this is the second
[55:27] flag raising this was actually video but
[55:30] the thing is they were still enemy on
[55:31] the
[55:31] Island you know the Japanese were still
[55:33] there they're still gunshots they were
[55:35] still you know you know you're you know
[55:37] there was cannon fire there was
[55:38] artillery fire they're your people were
[55:40] getting shot at you know but what they
[55:42] they determined and even with the enemy
[55:45] there they said we are gonna raise a
[55:47] standard
[55:48] I mean we're gonna raise a banner and
[55:50] the thing is you know we can we we have
[55:53] to come to a place in our walk where it
[55:55] doesn't matter what's going on around us
[55:57] we can still raise the bed a man he is a
[56:00] banner hallelujah the Lord has helped
[56:02] enemy to be standing on the parade
[56:05] ground and your raise a flag on the
[56:07] playground you know you can be in your
[56:09] home or even in a convention so all the
[56:11] Lord's wonderful begin to rejoice I mean
[56:13] but when you get back to your address
[56:14] you get back to your home oh yeah and
[56:17] you're in the house of your friends and
[56:19] and those ones that hurt you I mean
[56:21] those ones that have been firing arrows
[56:23] at you and we know it's just jealousy or
[56:25] can be many different things but you've
[56:27] got to be able to raise a standard even
[56:30] in their presence because we have to
[56:33] recognize I mean when Israel and
[56:36] Gideon's day when when when they make
[56:39] the caves and the foxholes and and they
[56:41] went and hid away did that deliver them
[56:43] it didn't help them win but I mean they
[56:47] had to come out and fight holier they
[56:49] had to they had to come out in a fight
[56:51] that's the only way that they could be
[56:52] delivered and so here we are now you
[56:55] know these men rose are standing in the
[57:00] prints of their enemy and we have to be
[57:03] able to raise a standard of the Lord
[57:04] Jesus Christ I mean in the presence of
[57:07] of every demon power in face of all
[57:11] criticism right in face of also snide
[57:15] remarks and people trying to tear us
[57:17] down
[57:17] hallelujah there's nothing nothing is
[57:20] going to help us if we hide away yeah I
[57:24] just want to show you let me show you a
[57:26] picture of where they raise this flag
[57:29] now here's an aerial photograph of this
[57:32] island now you see this mountain here
[57:34] yeah that's where they put the flag up
[57:37] it's all exposed you know it's not
[57:40] heading away down on the beach somewhere
[57:41] you know up on this mountain
[57:43] and they put the standing up there
[57:45] because they wanted the enemy to see no
[57:48] we're on this place we are taking this
[57:51] place I mean we're going to look right
[57:53] the Pacific Holly and we're going to
[57:55] push back the oppressor no I know it's
[57:57] just a natural battle by be using it as
[57:58] an example I mean but but they decided
[58:01] we're gonna put the standard up we're
[58:03] gonna put the standard up I mean almost
[58:05] mounted into the six in this exposed
[58:08] place Wow hallelujah oh we can't go a
[58:12] threshing weight like Gideon and secret
[58:14] by the wine priests I mean he just he
[58:17] just had essential services riding on he
[58:20] had Israel's essential services just
[58:21] trying to get a bit of food just trying
[58:23] to survive
[58:24] living well blows privileged I mean but
[58:27] the thing is he had some things in the
[58:28] storage cupboard that when that when the
[58:32] angel of the Lord came to Herman he just
[58:36] asked a question of God is with us where
[58:39] the miracle said yeah you know we're the
[58:41] miracles and like Moses or Josh or okay
[58:43] little mamas where's that God yeah oh
[58:46] yeah you know but we have to as if I'm
[58:49] following me okay yes I mean we don't
[58:53] you know the thing is what really you
[58:56] just take you just take heavy rock for
[58:58] example right her sons were were making
[59:01] fun there was snickering program said
[59:03] they weren't sitting there listening
[59:05] hall wasn't this wonderful but she
[59:07] raises standard I mean she raised the
[59:10] standard of faith holy when brother
[59:12] members tell the testimony the screws
[59:14] being crated I mean she didn't she
[59:16] didn't hide away in a bucket trying you
[59:18] know all these my sons whatever no no
[59:19] she looked into what the prophet of God
[59:21] was saying she looked into what God was
[59:23] doing and she there's nothing but the
[59:25] truth brother Brown and God can be
[59:26] honest its masculine amethysts way I
[59:30] mean egg her and her children
[59:32] amen I mean became believers her songs
[59:34] Aliyah so we should be able to I mean
[59:37] raise the standard we should had to
[59:39] worship we should be able to just be how
[59:41] we're meat to be no matter the
[59:45] circumstance now I'm not talking about
[59:47] putting on something I'm talking about
[59:48] how you really are with God
[59:51] and how you meet them me with God how
[59:53] you were in your first love
[59:54] we should be greater than that because
[59:56] it should just do oh I mean you take you
[59:59] take David David David was bringing the
[1:00:02] ark to to Jerusalem and because the word
[1:00:05] the prince of God was coming into a city
[1:00:07] he got a little bit excited holy and and
[1:00:11] and he begin to dance and he begin to
[1:00:13] worship any any and and because he was a
[1:00:15] man after God's own heart he just fought
[1:00:17] the law yeah hallelujah he just he just
[1:00:19] worshipped God he wasn't too worried
[1:00:21] about what other people are doing but
[1:00:23] then his wife would look at a window
[1:00:24] looked down on him and she would
[1:00:26] actually despise what she would actually
[1:00:28] despise his worship now some of us you
[1:00:32] know you know we get a baby a hurtful
[1:00:35] remark maybe from our spouse maybe from
[1:00:37] our children maybe from someone in
[1:00:38] church maybe just a your offend comment
[1:00:41] it's like a javelin mistake you know
[1:00:42] it's thrusts us through I mean but your
[1:00:44] David David did not leave her attitude
[1:00:48] her atmosphere I mean her comments
[1:00:50] diminish and his walk with God he did
[1:00:54] beseech your services I mean because of
[1:00:57] what she did she just hear you say well
[1:00:59] if you don't like this I'm just gonna do
[1:01:01] it again
[1:01:01] tomorrow I'm just gonna continue on man
[1:01:03] yeah I mean I mean we should just
[1:01:11] continue almost god I'm a boy and solace
[1:01:18] her to jail yeah I love it when Paul
[1:01:20] could good could begin to list down you
[1:01:23] know everything that could not see
[1:01:24] prayers from the love of God which is in
[1:01:25] Christ Jesus our Lord because all those
[1:01:28] things that he listed came against them
[1:01:30] right hallelujah
[1:01:31] he wasn't just riding something that was
[1:01:33] hypothetical he lived well I mean he
[1:01:35] really wait for me he came to a place he
[1:01:38] recognized doesn't matter what the devil
[1:01:40] does doesn't matter how it comes what
[1:01:42] what former maybe nothing can separate
[1:01:44] me from my first love
[1:01:46] because remember amen what what is
[1:01:49] manifested in the messenger of the age
[1:01:51] there's actually like the entire age
[1:01:53] just in one man I mean but I don't
[1:01:56] believe that the Apostle Paul cuz
[1:01:58] because when the Ephesian age started
[1:01:59] the Apostle Paul had already died did
[1:02:02] the Lord but I believe he was a man who
[1:02:04] was walking in his first love and it
[1:02:06] doesn't matter what came against him I
[1:02:08] mean he could he could endure and he
[1:02:10] could withstand and he could stay and
[1:02:12] that first time with our Lord Jesus I
[1:02:15] just read the you know you know you have
[1:02:18] a life the Apostle Paul and I just
[1:02:19] marvel I mean hallelujah but but Paul
[1:02:24] and Silas would find themselves in to
[1:02:25] jail and they were just in the jail
[1:02:29] there in the end of jail and and they
[1:02:33] just wouldn't you're escorted and they
[1:02:35] can you please stand the cell sir and
[1:02:37] you know no they were beaten they were
[1:02:39] dragged by a mob without beating and and
[1:02:41] they were just in a Cell theron and the
[1:02:44] inner cell and stop verified a place my
[1:02:48] mind they had you know they attempted
[1:02:50] this place had preached and this was the
[1:02:51] end of their preaching you know you know
[1:02:56] it's amazing you look at the life of
[1:02:57] Paul he goes to a city you know you know
[1:02:59] we're reading through the book of Acts
[1:03:00] at night and you know it's so amazing he
[1:03:03] goes to a place god moves an incredible
[1:03:05] way in the enemy that's following him
[1:03:07] from the other city comes along stirs
[1:03:09] the people up against them he gets
[1:03:10] beaten me get stoned or whatever happens
[1:03:12] is a picture more goes on and and the
[1:03:15] Apostle Paul just continues on you know
[1:03:17] many of us probably would have quit you
[1:03:19] know he doesn't get discouraged he just
[1:03:21] continued on I mean so porn solace for
[1:03:34] in a jail I'm not really a jail as I see
[1:03:37] it but they they they decided I don't
[1:03:40] know how they decided it but but
[1:03:41] something moved in their hearts they
[1:03:43] said we're not gonna let this keep us
[1:03:45] down and they begin to sing and they
[1:03:48] begin to praise the Lord hallelujah and
[1:03:51] then God came down into the prison maybe
[1:03:53] because of their worship to God
[1:03:55] remember we shouldn't worship God based
[1:03:57] on how well things are going for us
[1:04:00] I mean with God should give a big well
[1:04:02] praise the Lord I have this oh praise
[1:04:04] the Lord he's giving me the surprised
[1:04:05] one even I said my prayer you know it's
[1:04:07] you knew I want you giving me based on
[1:04:09] that but now with God's me based on who
[1:04:28] he's done we must continue doesn't
[1:04:47] matter anyway oh my god I mean seven
[1:05:30] billion people on the earth and you find
[1:05:31] me in that's how we should be he will
[1:05:44] make fun let them make fun remarks from
[1:05:47] family whoever it might be the kiss oh I
[1:05:51] don't I don't go to chase be seen by
[1:05:55] everyone else and then I come to church
[1:05:57] to wave my flag of worship say glory
[1:06:00] straight when King George regard for
[1:06:03] Canada and all the little kids that he
[1:06:05] won was given a little flag an hour
[1:06:07] along the streets they're waving their

[1:06:24] and in this one little girl whose name
[1:06:25] there's no present you know sorry so
[1:06:29] they begin to get worried that begin to
[1:06:31] search and then and then they're
[1:06:32] switching down the street and they find
[1:06:34] her attacked behind maybe a lamppost and

[1:07:24] hearts and he begin to see a vision of
[1:07:27] the woman that was standing in front of

[1:08:22] man and this old man would would go

[1:09:33] he wouldn't have to come down and
[1:09:34] disturb with that door and you by having
[1:09:36] their old fancy nice tea party and you
[1:09:39] know maybe the daughter had her first

[1:09:51] level I mean she just went down to their
[1:09:55] level and then the next thing you know

[1:10:13] explaining oh that's just my dad in your
[1:10:15] eye you know feeling embarrassed he was
[1:10:18] feeling embarrassed because of what he
[1:10:20] was doing and he was just worshipping as
[1:10:22] God we should never feel embarrassed and
[1:10:26] hold on someone I mean we should never
[1:10:30] feel embarrassed when God begins to move
[1:10:31] in the church amen
[1:10:33] God said look Lori bliss the ball Lord
[1:10:36] bless the Morrigan the worst thing but
[1:10:40] you know one thing I really hate as when
[1:10:42] when someone is squished when a gift is
[1:10:45] suppressed I meant by but but by someone
[1:10:49] who's jealous or something I hate to see
[1:10:51] that I hate to see someone's worship be
[1:10:54] torn to pieces I mean we're not putting
[1:10:58] something on they just wanted to look
[1:10:59] true to God that's just how they respond
[1:11:01] yeah I mean I'm not saying we all need
[1:11:03] to be noisy but he's gonna be true to
[1:11:05] how you out in the world and and and
[1:11:14] weird hair parties or something you know
[1:11:16] you just pass the ball around a few
[1:11:18] times the real quiet one is not quiet no
[1:11:20] more you know after a few hey they just
[1:11:32] you know to worry about who they're no
[1:11:34] more they've been getting shot and dance
[1:11:35] and mate you know yeah but you're never
[1:11:37] gonna cut up like everyone else why
[1:11:39] because he drinking the same spirit
[1:11:41] drinking from the same bottle and you
[1:11:44] know I believe we just drink from the
[1:11:46] same bottle let go and let God have his
[1:11:48] way God will always be in water it's an
[1:12:00] order that's right she was embarrassed
[1:12:04] if it be embarrassed when God moves on
[1:12:10] that person so you know so so so the
[1:12:17] party's all done and you know you know
[1:12:18] they didn't did her dad comes out and
[1:12:21] you know she's like dad what happened
[1:12:23] well you know was all that noise all
[1:12:25] that commotion all that screaming good
[1:12:27] you know the plaster was falling off the
[1:12:29] ceiling you know you embarrassed me dad
[1:12:31] Oh Jim Pat and said well well well honey
[1:12:35] you know you know he didn't care because
[1:12:37] you know he just loved the Lord right
[1:12:39] he's in his first love I meant he's just
[1:12:43] sent his first lot and you know he said
[1:12:44] well I don't have my Bible on me
[1:12:47] but I begin to be looking through some
[1:12:49] treasures oh yeah I begin to be looking
[1:12:53] through a few treasures in your attic
[1:12:57] and I found a geography book and I talk
[1:13:01] about the ocean and you know what this
[1:13:04] dumb every book they say they can't
[1:13:05] can't find the bottom of the ocean and I
[1:13:08] begin to sink when I was thinking about
[1:13:10] it I began to think that God put my sins
[1:13:12] in the sea and it got me really kind of
[1:13:21] excited you know so I'm just gonna I'm
[1:13:38] just gonna leave it just what made up
[1:13:41] well I just make a few more comments but
[1:13:43] I say this is the age of being in our
[1:13:46] first love amen
[1:13:48] capstone is divine love himself coming
[1:13:50] down right and if remember there are
[1:13:54] actually in the in the book of Proverbs
[1:13:56] I believe it is there's the statue of
[1:13:58] the imperfect man who's ever seen that
[1:14:02] right there's a statue of the imperfect
[1:14:05] man just like in Peter there's a statue
[1:14:08] of the perfect man oh boy amen and so if
[1:14:12] someone is built up in the statue of the
[1:14:15] imperfect man oh now if I can't find it
[1:14:23] forgive me and then if I can't find it
[1:14:27] we weren't worried about it just now but
[1:14:28] there's some homework
[1:14:36] now again James and Peter so second
[1:14:39] Peter so the statue of the imperfect man
[1:14:42] we got a proverb 6 okay we're just gonna
[1:14:44] have a real quick Bible study but we're
[1:14:46] not I just want you to think about this
[1:14:48] proverbs 6 and 16
[1:14:59] probably 6 and 16 so I mean when you did
[1:15:04] proverbs 6 and 16 these 6 things that
[1:15:09] the Lord hate a seminar in their BOTS
[1:15:11] are an abomination unto Him a proud look
[1:15:14] a long time and hands that she'd
[1:15:16] innocent blood a heart that deceiveth
[1:15:19] wicked and imaginations feet that be
[1:15:22] swift and running to mischief a false
[1:15:25] witness that speaketh lies and he that
[1:15:28] soweth discord among brethren yeah but
[1:15:32] and I won't do it now but you take the
[1:15:35] statue of the perfect man and you see
[1:15:37] the statue of the imperfect manners as
[1:15:39] the opposite but now there's actually a
[1:15:42] the capstone is not there to capstone as
[1:15:45] in 26 proverbs 26 and in verses 24 to 28
[1:15:52] I'll have this know correct he says me
[1:15:56] about he that hateth dissembler 'the
[1:15:59] with his lips was that song discord
[1:16:01] among brethren and laughed up the seat
[1:16:03] within him when he speaketh fear believe
[1:16:05] him not for there are seven abominations
[1:16:09] in his heart whose hatred is covered by
[1:16:12] deceit his wickedness shall be showed
[1:16:15] before the whole congregation so there
[1:16:20] is the statue of the perfect man we just
[1:16:22] read the statue of the imperfect man now
[1:16:25] if someone has built up in the statue of
[1:16:28] the imperfect man you'll see that
[1:16:30] manifested in his life right just like
[1:16:34] if you see the statue of the perfect man
[1:16:35] you'll see that those attributes
[1:16:38] manifested in the believer oh why you
[1:16:44] saying this I say this if you have
[1:16:48] divine love in your life
[1:16:50] it will manifest itself the battle is to
[1:16:55] stay in that divine love demon I'm
[1:16:58] calling the divine love the first love
[1:17:00] remember they fell from a position you
[1:17:04] know they cease repeat for us you can
[1:17:07] will be taken from you remember he sees
[1:17:11] in verse 5 of and and I was gonna wrap
[1:17:13] this up revelations 2 and verse 5
[1:17:15] remember from whence thou art fallen see
[1:17:18] you've got to remember you know if you
[1:17:20] you know if you're in spiritual lockdown
[1:17:23] and you just become a Christian
[1:17:26] essential services you have to remember
[1:17:29] from what you remember remember where
[1:17:32] you have fallen from that's why I say
[1:17:35] human go back into storage go back up
[1:17:38] yeah pull your testimony out hallelujah
[1:17:42] looking over relive it amen
[1:17:47] in the irritate opponent and you'll
[1:17:50] begin to see you'll begin to remember
[1:17:52] what it was like when you first met him
[1:17:55] that was when that first love when you
[1:17:57] came into that first love that's why it
[1:17:59] means that what says remember from weeks
[1:18:01] thou art fallen hallelujah you say well
[1:18:08] I've taken too many blows God can heal
[1:18:12] them just look with a memory and maybe
[1:18:16] maybe brother I story - just just just
[1:18:18] just after this I think what we'll do
[1:18:20] actually is we ACU's gonna in the stream
[1:18:22] and we're just gonna pray okay but don't
[1:18:28] just don't just live with a memory oh I
[1:18:32] used to be so happy you know God wants
[1:18:34] us to be happy
[1:18:34] I used to rejoice I used to just just
[1:18:38] just just bathe in his presence just
[1:18:40] love his word so much it's just so alive
[1:18:42] and so real but you know but now it's
[1:18:44] work you know you know I've been along
[1:18:46] the road a bit of a way God's eternal he
[1:18:50] doesn't get stabbed with time this gets
[1:18:53] richer and greater and you're it all the
[1:18:55] time no don't just live with a memory of
[1:18:59] when you first meet him I mean you can
[1:19:02] go back you can go back to that first
[1:19:05] love hallelujah but go back
[1:19:10] don't your edit go back into your
