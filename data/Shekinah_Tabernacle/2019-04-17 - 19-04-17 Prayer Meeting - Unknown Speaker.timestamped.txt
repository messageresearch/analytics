[8:52] and a more sincere and honest approach
[8:54] towards your world and the people that
[8:57] law despite the good battle with us amen
[9:00] I pray that you would just take your
[9:02] resort into captivity to 1902 and Lord
[9:05] we are set the table that we might just
[9:08] cost it out yes Jesus trying to get up
[9:12] listening tonight mother and Load become
[9:14] to fellowship around us
[9:17] oh this is Easter time Lord Jesus it is
[9:19] a very special time very Christian yeah
[9:21] this is where our walk has begun with
[9:23] unity though this is where the whole
[9:26] plan of redemption the whole Christian
[9:28] the Lord Jesus when you can't do this
[9:30] when you have started off that final
[9:32] Symphony Lord Jesus Lord and how you
[9:34] started revealing yourselves this day
[9:36] Lord not just in flesh law but once more
[9:39] in spirit through your people Lord Lord
[9:42] I pray Lord that the cross would not
[9:44] just be a thing of history logo but a
[9:46] very reality now in our life
[9:48] oh the
[9:49] you know that that blood is precious
[9:51] blood Lord but that's before even Lord
[9:54] when you you have the lamb that was
[9:56] shaped Lord the Passover lamb how's that
[9:59] lamb type you Lord Jesus
[10:01] and that blood Lord Jesus that they put
[10:03] on the lintel type you Lord Jesus and
[10:06] when you came to the crucifixion Lord
[10:08] and every precious blood that dripped on
[10:10] the floor Lord was for healing
[10:12] yes for an enticement was upon you Lord
[10:18] Jesus thank you Lord that we as
[10:21] Christians now can just walk Lord yes
[10:23] Lord walk with you in the newness of
[10:25] life
[10:25] yes long right it shake that offerings
[10:28] Lord
[10:28] maybe tonight Calvinism the shapes
[10:31] lattices Ram Lord and just remember what
[10:33] you've done for us that they on Calvary
[10:35] oh gee I pray that everyone would just
[10:37] aim to read tonight and when they get
[10:40] their blessing tonight oh man Lord for
[10:42] if we count Lord and we willing Lord you
[10:44] are able I know Lord Jesus please these
[10:47] words take this this little lesson Lord
[10:49] and just maybe glorifying you yes Lord
[10:52] and you'll keep going and I know the
[10:54] kingdom of saw here on this and help us
[10:58] in your food
[11:10] sometimes I get so nervous when I stand
[11:12] here I know every everyone that stands
[11:15] here basically gets nervous because when
[11:18] we talk about the Word of God we don't
[11:21] take it very lightly it's something
[11:23] that's very precious to us and maybe
[11:26] tonight I can encourage you that you
[11:28] might not always see things as someone
[11:30] else sees it but it doesn't mean that
[11:32] it's wrong because hopefully tonight
[11:35] when we look at the crucifixion we see
[11:37] it from a different angle and different
[11:40] people relate to different things that
[11:42] happen on that day of the crucifixion
[11:44] but it doesn't mean they just want to
[12:07] get my book and we're just going to read
[12:09] from verse 39 to verse 43 so you mean
[12:16] when you leave and it says here all he
[12:24] started verse 38 and the superscription
[12:29] also was written over him in the letters
[12:31] of Greek and Latin and in Hebrews this
[12:35] is the King of the Jews and one of the
[12:38] male factors which was hung raised on
[12:41] him saying if thou be the Christ saves
[12:44] ourselves and us but the other answering
[12:48] rebuked him saying does not thou fear
[12:51] God saying thou art in the same
[12:54] condemnation and we indeed justify for
[12:59] we receive a due reward of our deeds but
[13:02] this man have done nothing amiss and he
[13:05] said unto Jesus Lord remember me when
[13:08] thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus
[13:10] said unto Him verily I say unto thee
[13:13] today shalt thou be with me in paradise
[13:18] amen may the law just least the reading
[13:21] of his word you can sit down
[13:25] so we have we have three accounts of the
[13:29] crucifixion and what I've done because I
[13:31] always get nervous when I have to share
[13:33] a bit of about the law because I don't
[13:35] know what to share and and I always
[13:37] think that as a person sometimes when we
[13:40] see something we just see it wrong but
[13:43] the Lord has showed me so much that that
[13:45] if we just keep on reading the word and
[13:47] keep on listening to the message he will
[13:49] guide us into all truth and all life so
[13:53] then I went and I listened to to the
[13:55] book of Matthew and I and I read while I
[13:57] was listening and I read the account and
[13:59] see Matthew he was very concentrated
[14:02] about what the disciples did and and how
[14:05] they deceived the Lord and how they
[14:07] worked in the background and he's detail
[14:09] is a bit more if we look at the what he
[14:14] says he concentrates on the thieves but
[14:16] he doesn't really mention this part
[14:18] where the one thief rebuked the other
[14:20] one he just said they scorned him so he
[14:22] doesn't really mention this and when you
[14:24] get to Luke Luke mentions this story and
[14:26] he really points it out that hey
[14:28] something happened they but when we go
[14:30] to John John doesn't even mention any of
[14:33] it it just says they was he was hung
[14:34] between malefactors and and that just
[14:37] fulfills the scripture that he would be
[14:39] hung the prophecy you would hung between
[14:41] malefactors so that got me thinking I'm
[14:44] thinking here about three disciples all
[14:47] three of them at the same place but all
[14:49] three of them with a different part of
[14:51] the same account so they're always there
[14:54] and they all looked at the cross and
[14:56] they all see what was happening but one
[14:58] was concentrating on the the deceit of
[15:00] the disciples and one was looking
[15:02] through the thieves on the cross and the
[15:04] other one was looking at the prophecies
[15:06] being fulfilled so they had a different
[15:08] point of view that they looked at the
[15:10] crucifixion but it's the same with us if
[15:13] we come into Easter like we came now is
[15:15] there something different in Easter that
[15:17] that gets revealed to us and not
[15:19] everybody gets the same revelation when
[15:21] I first came into the the macy's praise
[15:23] the Lord
[15:24] the first thing that was very important
[15:26] to me was the blood then I could apply
[15:29] that blood and that blood once it's
[15:31] applied I'm on speaking terms with God
[15:34] again
[15:35] and for me that was important and that
[15:37] the blog would change me from all sin
[15:39] because when I was being purified I
[15:42] needed that blood so for me calvary had
[15:45] a meaning of blood and if I didn't have
[15:47] that blood I couldn't I couldn't talk to
[15:49] God because I had to apply the blood so
[15:52] he can see I have no sin and he can come
[15:54] the holy God and speak to me and he
[15:56] knows that I have no sin and we are on
[15:58] speaking terms so for me the first time
[16:00] I heard about the cross it was about the
[16:03] blood but then again the next year when
[16:05] we came to the very same time it wasn't
[16:08] about the cross for me and it wasn't
[16:10] about the blood me though they're all
[16:11] very important it was what was God
[16:13] revealing again to me to saying that he
[16:16] is Jesus Christ he was walking up that
[16:18] cross before he gone he got stripes on
[16:21] his back and that was for my healing and
[16:22] and he was bruised my iniquities so so
[16:26] the next year when I was in the I said
[16:27] oh but God didn't just purchased me he
[16:29] didn't just clean me but he also paid
[16:32] everything even my healing in future
[16:34] things already back then so I just kept
[16:37] on walking so this year I'm sitting and
[16:39] I'm looking at the same event and all of
[16:41] a sudden I see but they were two thieves
[16:43] and the ones attitude towards the Christ
[16:47] was get yourself all day and while you
[16:49] do it get me off with you as well
[16:51] because he was looking for a way out but
[16:52] the other one was looking for a way in
[16:55] so he was looking at God to get into
[16:58] heaven though he was he was as guilty as
[17:00] everyone and even could he even
[17:02] confesses he says I we get a just reward
[17:04] but this man is innocent and then and in
[17:08] while I look at this story now look at
[17:10] the judgment hall and here's its Pilate
[17:13] Pilate stands before Jesus and he and he
[17:16] says you say you're the King of the Jews
[17:18] he says no I don't say that he says you
[17:21] say that so Jesus doesn't come and say
[17:24] yeah I'm the King of the Jews you know
[17:26] I'm all God Almighty coming to look at
[17:28] all these wonderful miracles he was just
[17:30] very humble and he sees two stage to
[17:32] Pilate you say I am king and then he
[17:36] says but but these people they come all
[17:38] before you and they they give you all
[17:40] these accusations you say nothing and
[17:42] Jesus said nothing and then Pilate walks
[17:45] out unbeliever and he gets in front of
[17:49] the believers and he says I find no
[17:51] fault in this man and the believers
[17:53] answer is crucified he says okay I've
[17:56] got it
[17:56] I've got a deal I gotta do because he
[17:58] wants to get this off his hands he wants
[18:00] to come clean because he is a
[18:01] unbelievers looking at this situation
[18:03] going these more to this than meets the
[18:05] eye this man is not murdered someone
[18:07] this man is not killed someone he's just
[18:09] standing right before me and there's
[18:12] nothing wrong so he wants to get this
[18:14] off his hands he wants to get the blood
[18:15] off his head so he goes out one more
[18:17] time and he sees to the people he sees I
[18:19] find no fault in this man he says but
[18:22] let me tell you this we've got a custom
[18:24] that on this day of the Passover we can
[18:26] release a thief or of someone to your
[18:29] prisoner to you and and we've got this
[18:31] guy Barabbas so it was even trying to
[18:33] sell the hardest case to them so they
[18:35] would let Jesus go he was trying
[18:37] everything in himself as an unbeliever
[18:39] to get this man off Jesus Christ and and
[18:43] they were going now crucifying will take
[18:45] Barabbas and so he goes in front of them
[18:49] all and he says while I wash my hands of
[18:51] it and they answer but ladies blood be
[18:53] on us and upon our children and heaps
[18:56] why that's why the Jews is where they
[18:57] are now today because that prophecy is
[19:00] still being fulfilled they said so then
[19:04] I look at that and I think okay I don't
[19:06] I don't get this brother Branham says he
[19:08] and one of his service he says then they
[19:12] crucified Him and he says these words he
[19:15] says the message that I've got on my
[19:19] heart to preach up here and the next
[19:21] meeting on a Good Friday afternoon is
[19:24] theirs they crucified Him they the
[19:27] holiest religious place in the world was
[19:29] Jerusalem they the most holiest people
[19:32] supposed to be people in the world the
[19:35] Jews that's what he sees in the quote he
[19:37] sees they crucified the most cruelest
[19:40] punishment at Rome at that time and they
[19:43] says and what the greatest person ever
[19:46] lived they crucified him so then I
[19:50] thought this really struck me I was
[19:53] lifting this conundrum that and I'm
[19:56] gonna read this next part to you because
[19:57] this might be just highlight what
[19:59] happens is well when
[20:02] when people see it in a corner way and
[20:04] not in God's provided way so just before
[20:07] all of this if we go to Matthew 27 I'll
[20:12] just read it for you and it's verse 1 to
[20:14] verse 6 I'm gonna read since then when
[20:17] in the morning has come all the chief
[20:19] priests and elders of the people took
[20:22] counsel against Jesus to put him to
[20:24] death and when they had bound him they
[20:27] led him away and delivered him unto
[20:29] Pontius Pilate the governor then Judas
[20:32] which have betrayed him when he saw that
[20:35] he was condemned he repented himself and
[20:38] he brought again thirty pieces of silver
[20:39] to the chief priests and elders saying I
[20:42] have sinned and that I have betrayed an
[20:45] innocent blood so even Judas that was
[20:50] with the Lord that intentionally went
[20:52] out and did this started realizing man I
[20:54] can't take this back I have just
[20:57] betrayed an innocent man his blood is
[20:59] now on my hands as well same as with
[21:02] Pontius Pilate and then he was an
[21:04] unbeliever so both of them are now in
[21:05] the same situation but see now look what
[21:08] happens here
[21:09] he says saying I have sinned that I have
[21:12] betrayed an innocent blood and they said
[21:15] what is that to us just see that the see
[21:20] see those do that and then he calls down
[21:24] the pieces of silver in the temple and
[21:26] they departed and he went and hung
[21:28] himself and the chief priests took the
[21:30] silver pieces and said it is not lawful
[21:33] for us to put it into the treasury
[21:36] because this because it is the price of
[21:39] blood so even the Pharisees knew what
[21:44] they have done so when God said that
[21:47] I've blinded the the Jews eyes to this
[21:49] they were blinded but they when they
[21:52] knew what they'd done so I want to bring
[21:55] it in today's life we have gotten a
[21:57] message from the Lord that we walk in
[22:00] and isn't the same two spirits again
[22:03] fighting this battle is it at exactly
[22:05] the same time as at the time of Easter
[22:08] you have people that believe the report
[22:10] that sees what's going on and you have
[22:13] people standing right next to it saying
[22:14] we
[22:15] not have this man rule over us and in
[22:18] what they do is he is the two very
[22:19] characters now coming the thief that was
[22:22] wrong
[22:23] repented and says madam was wrong and he
[22:26] humbled himself and came to the Lord and
[22:29] the Lord received him but the other one
[22:31] was proud and boastful and he's
[22:33] character just took him further away
[22:34] from God so then it got me thinking that
[22:38] my biggest my biggest revelation out of
[22:41] this whole Easter this time is what is
[22:44] the Lord revealing to you and what are
[22:46] you willing to accept and if it goes
[22:49] against the grain inside you are you
[22:51] willing to just put it down then to go
[22:54] and fight and reason against the Word of
[22:56] God because it ain't going to get you
[22:58] anyway it's going to get you to a place
[23:00] where you might maybe push more than you
[23:02] should and then and then you had a place
[23:04] we go if I just if I just put it down we
[23:07] had a person and I'll share in the
[23:10] Fellowship we had a person come in and
[23:13] and brother Ben was one day was
[23:14] preaching and the person said I enjoyed
[23:18] the service until he said that I said
[23:22] but what about the rest of it and he
[23:25] said nah stop listening so this is the
[23:30] attitude but see a true believer says
[23:32] Lord I don't understand what's going on
[23:34] but please show me so so when I look at
[23:38] the cross Jesus going up hanging between
[23:41] two thieves and this is my Easter
[23:43] message if I can give it to you hanging
[23:45] between thieves the king of kings the
[23:47] king of the Jews and everybody else
[23:51] scorns him and lost city and said get
[23:53] off they you know get off the cross help
[23:55] yourself he could if he could have
[23:57] called angels and it would have all been
[23:58] over but so he's hanging there and he's
[24:02] just thinking about us that's here now
[24:05] because he was thinking about us because
[24:08] if God is eternal and he's sovereign and
[24:10] he knows the beginning from the end he
[24:12] knew we were here and when he was
[24:14] hanging there he was thinking about us
[24:16] it wasn't thinking about the unbelievers
[24:19] he was thinking about us and the very
[24:22] purpose why he purchased us so he's
[24:25] hanging there and he is you can many
[24:28] would have been in so
[24:29] Spain and it's just looking around him
[24:32] going man all these guys they spit on me
[24:35] they they they scoff us they tell me to
[24:38] get off this cross yet they blind yeah
[24:40] and he looks through the thief and the
[24:42] thief says yeah you get us and you off
[24:44] the cross and he goes another one and
[24:47] then the other thief sees rebukes the
[24:50] other season see you keep quiet this man
[24:51] is innocent and then he looks at this
[24:54] thief and Nene goes this is why I'm here
[24:56] this very fact that I'm doing now this
[24:59] is why I'm here because these are people
[25:01] that wouldn't be proud that wouldn't be
[25:03] boastful but would actually take my
[25:05] provided way and this is why I'm doing
[25:09] this and then the jury was before him
[25:11] and then he died and he cried out loud
[25:13] and he says he sees my God my God why is
[25:16] a forsaken it because the Spirit of God
[25:18] left him and he had to die as a man twas
[25:20] God cannot die and he died but then he
[25:25] rose again anything so I don't want to
[25:28] talk about the resurrection because
[25:30] we're gonna have to Easter weekend and I
[25:32] think it's gonna be wonderful the
[25:34] weekend are we gonna talk some some
[25:36] resurrection power over thee but I want
[25:38] to say that something had to die for us
[25:41] and when Jesus came and he died for us
[25:45] the same as with the Passover isn't it
[25:46] strange that Jesus died on the Passover
[25:49] you know other people find us strange
[25:52] and weird that we got all these
[25:53] connections in the Bible and you see see
[25:56] the head to have the lamb and they had
[25:57] to become one with the lamb and the
[25:59] blood had to be applied and every year
[26:01] when you walk you see that and then God
[26:02] connects a bit more and he puts another
[26:04] piece in the puzzle and he puts another
[26:06] piece in the puzzle but see God will
[26:08] keep on putting pieces in your puzzle if
[26:10] you are willing to have him put it there
[26:12] it is just not what you can do it's not
[26:15] who you are it's not how good you are is
[26:18] what God can show you revelation so yeah
[26:24] man praise the Lord there was one more
[26:26] that I wanted to say strange so we go
[26:30] past the just before the crucifixion so
[26:34] the holiest of holy people holding
[26:37] Beelzebub yeah
[26:40] but Legion hold him the Son of God so I
[26:45] I don't get it I don't get how how if
[26:48] they call him a devil the holiest of
[26:50] holy and and the devil calls him God we
[26:54] did they miss it
[26:55] how did they go wrong how did they not
[26:57] see it but see that was God's provide
[27:00] away now he is the message
[27:02] some people say their brother branham is
[27:05] just a false prophet some people say we
[27:08] just phonetics some people say there's
[27:11] nothing to this but guess what he
[27:14] confirms it maybe a bit of a testimony
[27:17] if I can close with that Liam can I see
[27:19] your testimony alright okay are you sure
[27:23] good okay so Liam header had a sore on
[27:29] his hand what do you call it a Frankie a
[27:31] wart on his hand
[27:33] a real bad wart on his hand and it was
[27:35] swollen and big and ugly and basically
[27:38] I'm gonna just make a long story short
[27:41] but I want to just get to the just of it
[27:44] so we pray over it and this wart and and
[27:48] while we praying the Lord speaks to
[27:51] Reuben and and he says that he should
[27:53] dip his ward a hand under water for one
[27:56] minute and we should pray for it then
[27:58] and then in two days it will be healed
[28:01] so we say to Liam Liam which you want to
[28:05] do it and Liam says well I don't know
[28:07] I'm scared
[28:08] so we said okay well if you skate we'll
[28:10] just we'll just leave it well back a bit
[28:12] off but we'll come back to this and so
[28:15] of course me and mum
[28:17] we forgot and time went past and in one
[28:21] day Liam said well and we reminded him
[28:23] of a nice in a while he'll try it now
[28:25] but see it's like at the Pool of
[28:27] Bethesda the water was stirred when we
[28:30] were praying so that time was then but
[28:34] God moved on so now we get to a stage
[28:37] where we do do it and we do pray but now
[28:39] nothing happens
[28:39] oh we go well this is a bit confusing
[28:42] now because because God said so and if
[28:45] God sees so heat will come to pass and
[28:47] if it doesn't come to pass God didn't
[28:49] say so and right as we say the Pool of
[28:51] Bethesda story comes back and I'm
[28:53] mmm that's it the water was stirred it
[28:57] would have happened that time so of
[29:00] course we all go and talk to Liam and
[29:02] said okay it didn't happen cause he
[29:04] asked his mom but it didn't happen on my
[29:06] stole all right with the story okay but
[29:09] it didn't happen I'm like brother Andy
[29:11] gets reminded a lot that brother peed
[29:13] and it didn't happen so we we prayed for
[29:16] him as well and and he was anointed with
[29:18] oil and but he really repented he said
[29:22] Lord I'm sorry you know you could heal
[29:25] me and I believe it and so we prayed
[29:27] again and then how many days after that
[29:30] that they let be prayed again about a
[29:35] week about a week it started going away
[29:38] in a piece of this this war fell off but
[29:42] there was a black dot in the middle of
[29:44] it and it started going black and it was
[29:47] like the life of this thing just went
[29:49] out it just died and then as he was
[29:53] playing it that something else had
[29:54] played and it felt completely over when
[29:55] he was healed but see God's told us
[29:59] things for us to tell us that he is
[30:01] still here so if this message is not
[30:03] true and we pray it wouldn't it wouldn't
[30:06] come to pass if we walking in the will
[30:09] of God and and we believe in these in
[30:11] these Commandments and we believe in and
[30:13] I don't stop listening to the tapes
[30:15] whatever you do don't stop listening to
[30:18] the tapes don't stop reading your Bible
[30:20] brother been said four chapters a day
[30:21] you can get through the Bible
[30:23] don't stop feeding because when you stop
[30:27] that's when the trials come because when
[30:30] you stop moving God will start moving
[30:32] you he will he will bring you trial
[30:36] after trial he will shake heavens and
[30:38] earth till he get you back in your place
[30:39] don't see it as a bad thing you see it
[30:42] is and it's not when you sometimes you
[30:44] reading Bible and you're praying every
[30:45] day and everything's good and you still
[30:47] get trials that doesn't mean you out of
[30:48] the will of God or God's not dealing
[30:50] with you that just means God's working
[30:51] with another face but I want to bring it
[30:54] back aside I went there I don't know why
[30:57] praise the Lord
[30:58] but when you look at the crucifixion
[31:00] every year when we do the Easter it is a
[31:05] personal walk with God I said to brother
[31:06] either one the other
[31:07] night I looked at that brother n Andy's
[31:11] what was his name John Andy's he
[31:15] preached about a personal God and God is
[31:18] personal to every single one of us and
[31:20] how you see the story your sister or
[31:24] your brother or your mom or your dad
[31:26] doesn't need to see it the same but if
[31:28] you really want to know what it means go
[31:31] listen to the tapes because it will be
[31:33] explained to you and God will keep on
[31:35] revealing as you walk so yeah I'm sorry
[31:38] I digressed I wanted to kind of end up
[31:40] with that but I the story of Liam this
[31:43] remember God is a God of miracle he is
[31:45] sovereign he can heal he can give you a
[31:48] job he can take care of his own he can
[31:52] do anything he's God why do we limit the
[31:55] power of God and the power of the blood
[31:57] so once God said hasn't forgiven you
[31:59] he's forgiven you it's over it's done so
[32:03] yeah I didn't want to stop thee but
[32:05] praise the Lord I think we can go into a
[32:09] bit of a pre maybe brother being you
