touching morning look like by the micron and thank you anyway more meaningful bye and don't analyse back we'd like to turn me you kept 20 in the night identified really with you see it on the news yet I need 25 really so what 24 I adopt her eyes and we saw Isaac he lighted off the camels for she and set out to the server what madness and the superintendent is my master therefore she took a veil and covered in milk and now we just want to go to Hebrews chapter to us through our water conference and so some of us may be but familiar to those who are here but I want to expand it's a Hebrews chapter to Murray from 18 for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death for all their lifetime subject to bondage for belly he took not on in the nature of ain't took train for barely he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham we're for all things that / heard them we made like under his rhetoric that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest of the things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the citizens of people well in that he himself has have suffered being kept it he is able to to secure them that are tempted as to help to able to relieve I mean my love is it's an L you know I'm balika know what I feel like I'm kind of going out into something that's being kind of it like it's a deep waters you know but uh you know I just trust a little put it all together yeah I just mean pondering a few things enough trust a little just over it up yeah we understand it Ecclesiastes 3 is it yes to everything there is a season into a time to every purpose under heaven so there's a there's a purpose for everything in life is a season forward as well and then the prophet Isaiah would say in chapter 55 and verses 10 11 as his froze the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return if not Heather but water if the earth and make root makers that bring forth and bud that it may give see to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper and the thing we're into I i sent it so gotta say that a season now when he sends his word upon the earth there is an intent that he has to send that work he has something in his mind that he wants to see expressed and it's a particular season you know the word that we have received mistake is not the same as though was work no your God told Noah I'm going to flood the earth build an ark and he told him exactly what to do that was the word for Noah's day and then brother bran brings out very simply Moses could not have come with noise message that would not have worked on that day he came in use all they've got to be expressible season and then you know as the prophets came down you know Elijah Malcolm all these things they had to bring a fresh part of the work and we see John the Baptist as well he could not um come with Moses message he had to come he was here to prepare the way the law says God was revealing as weren't down through the ages it was season a season to fulfill a particular thing yeah and we can see the same thing now in this day that god has sent a word of the state to do a certain thing and it's not just to call the people out of denomination and say all this is the this is the mark of the beast you must come out as more than just that but it's too as to bring us into a real union with Christ I mean that God would be revealed as leash again but in his bride that is the purposes message has been sent to us and so because we understand you and this is important that I that I really love from from prices of mystery of God revealed he says now he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space time and eternity he could not he's too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle of a hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and on out into the infinite and to the eternity and a great creature that was and still is how can how can man fathom such a great big being that is our eternal God but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was too I'm a son of man so that's the reason Jesus kept saying son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great victory for purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal herself in Christ secondly to have preeminence and his body of believers that is his pride that he might live in people now he could he could do that in adam and eve but since separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again oh my this is rich to me justjust even to think of it and see see what god's purpose was now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that before the fall then he would never been able to express his fullness his full attribute he could have been see he could have been a father there that's true but he's also a savior you say how do you know he was cuz I've had the experience see he's a savior and he had to express that and how could he do that only through Christ how could he be how could he be a son only through Christ how can he be a healer only through Christ see all things are wound up and that one person Jesus Christ and then he says when I think of that I just said denominations pass off the scene everything else just go when I see God's great purpose revealing himself first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of Godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence a--'s the oversight the leading so God you know is God wants to express themselves this is operation is he made this whole world and put you up on the school that he could reveal himself to you he's determined to have a relationship with a people yeah he's determined to express himself enter people but the only way that God bestowed on had all these attributes of himself to be healer and a savior and redeemer and a father and you know a counselor to God and all these things with him and he wanted to express them down to his children but the only way he could fully Express them as when they put on flesh and we can see this now where you know in the old testament where where Moses was you know he was commissioned you know you're the agile Lord came down the burning bush commissioner to take the people out of you know out of Egypt then and God would begin to display his attributes and that journey into the Promised Land you know they had the brains of server that they raised up in jesus said as that server was lifted up as Moses looked out the sermon so I will be lifted up because in their work divine healing and he was a sort of divine healing and then he was you know he you know of you with your they would say to him you're our fathers a manner and the wilderness he says I am that bread iron that matter you know idiot say you know and in Paul would Paul would identify the smith rock that they drank from of the wellness was Christ so all these so now attributes of God being displayed through these things but they could have displayed fully now what God wanted to express so for example the blood of bulls of God's you know redemption by blood that was that was a part cause attribute to be a redeemer but I can only cover the ascent in that form it had to but we didn't put on flesh now and put a whole new dimension and they're just cover the people since been annihilated this a minute mile andaman brother bran tells us at descent now goes through the blood of Jesus Christ and it goes on the head of the accuser I mean then he's going to take it to the judgment I mean then he's going to take it to the lake of fire I mean to your sin that you repeated over 30 min York I was even blogged you must be transferred and then on to the head of the accuser hallelujah so now you're all these things they had to be you know they had to be expressed that a man before your father name Amen and then even the same thing now where we're at your Nexus 23 now because he's expressed as a guide there as well he says behold i'll send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring them into the place which i have prepared and so that was just that was just an earthly journey from Egypt a new you know you know at the Palestine but then when he when he with that same angel put on flesh because that same God that thin them out of Egypt now you know our people he was he was Jesus Christ in a different form I'm indeed change for me put on flesh and then so now Jesus would say in John 14 I go to prepare a place for you there were I and II shall be also this is all the leave you comfortless I will come to you amen and he sees when the spirit of truth has come John would say he will lead to guide you into all truth sure there's a guy job they had a guide in a pot but it was was it was Yankee Lord wait before them but now that same angel comes as well to this church and then God is on the inside amen it's a whole whole different dimension to it where we once it was God above him you know God was still separated even though he he was at F&N who live and he could well with his people you know I've not anymore could go to the holy place not even go to the Holy of Holies you know it was dead too that's the mountain when God can be on Mount Sinai but now through the blood of jesus christ is dead dr. garden to the prison the Prophet tells us what time it was dead too to go one now did not to go it he must dip into the Prince of God another life and that same life that was there now comes into you and then he begins to him individually guide you in the way he say well what is that way the way is the work and the angel Lorde now will keep us in the work I mean that we won't your we may be things my influence we may go sideways a little bit but there will be it yeah that guy to lick it up maybe that's why you must know him personally because otherwise human human influence comes long different things come along and you know you can get sidetracked and push left and right amen and we can all be subject to that allows it i think last other Peter Peter came under human of look you know when the Jews came in and they tried to enjoy any separated himself it wouldn't eat with the Gentiles anymore as human influence coming in maybe but because they glide was on the inside of him now Emma sometimes what God to speak from the heavens sometimes he does but many times it'll be a part of his body come along amen I mean m3 you know brother Brennan he would he would you know 1111 sermon what message you know he quotes revelations 3 as videos i love by your rebuke and chasten he says you're receiving you're chasing you rebuke now and he's preaching you know some people think we gotta open the heavens and put a finger on something he comes a little man from Kentucky he opens the word as the prophet of the AG begin to speak some things and his Creek God is using that instrument to correct the people i mean because the Prophet can see far more than what we can see a menu say there was he say that was that was preached 50 years ago does the wood for the eight and then and in their word now God God will keep us in that work because the message is if your interpretation of this is not a different book not everything that's just this interpreter yeah I mean that light as one is now shone upon the work that we can really see you know we know God is one now how a manifest himself you know how you know we can see what the word really means is it's not just smoke and mirrors and patterns and add stories but it been young you know it's a living thing it was God himself and so now he would so it's just like you're one of the Old Testament prophets yours written in there watchman what are the night and God sets watchman above us here to Jabbar's people i meant they're still part of the body but God places them up in a certain office they can see more than what we can see and in so i watch minh up an attack and identify what's what your what's out there and a watchman is normally training they got keen eyesight don't want to put a blind man up in a tower and then you will have somebody's got twenty-twenty mission and they can pick things yo the enemy tries to sneak it you know and then did you pick someone that can identify things that are moving right amen so just like a problem we can look at something say what so you know just like how you know brother dining brought out that quote with Kennedy coming in today you know your ears available system come in there and through you know to America many men would have looked at that and then they say what's so bad about that it's a good man but the Prophet being up there having the keen eyesight now he could identify the spirits that we're working and then he can warn us about it that we can see it now it's comes with maturity amen so that's why now you know that's why you say well you know that's what God gotta send his angel in this day I'm talking about the one that was reflecting through the prophet amen yeah the very god of glory I can't reveal themselves through man answer that but that same Angeles still watching over us would what you got repeat like I had that then he would keep us in the way until we use the places prepared for us oh yeah well what is that place I've been glory at the wedding stuff but that place is prepared for us I mean we ever we have a body I mean that isn't comfortable if this earthly Tabernacle meters all we have one body way to go really bad maybe you can step into their body but now we have to be kept in the way yeah because we're you know we have these five senses we have our emotions you know where we are we're eternal beings for in the spine our body or go I met any time if we look at things you know we look at these things and we look at this world through our five senses now it will be swayed by things even and even if we look at through the sixties which is fight amen I mean we can look at the world of real identify what's going on maybe so we must be very careful only looking things and look at your brother brown can see things going on and you can see you know you know this the brother ground meat you know you know he would add another preview of the bride okay and he saw you know he go back into the other day you know the you know how could I frontier abounded he was he was raised at the clinic off in the 50s and 60 he was 11 years old sitting in sitting in those treat for meetings of 1965 and he was he was 11 years old and he was sitting on the USC because here was a prophet standing there relating Sydney jackson street the Angels new glory of God coming through the window università delivered he was looking for things to happen and he said he didn't go and so it came with an expectation and and that expectation was bent and then what it he saw out there he-man is 11 years old and you never be true God what your expectation us amen no I did those go in those days now part of the Pentecostal move was the liberation of the woman you see there's whole family was split some some states up the Bible way it seemed a bit of carrot dress for the using its right then the others with the liberal weapons right and in and those they can tell it's a zebra mall he visited a yes but then a problem can look at that say this is where it's going to go you man yeah because the promo ratings are deceitful yeah you understand yeah and then so he sees a season a sequel we may look at it say it's just a scene you know it's like you find some some some wheat that just gross yo covers your entire garden someone say don't plug that scene and say whatever some week and you say no it just looks like I want this on our roads or whatever do they look exactly the same we would be out of identify here we can look at that scene and say this is what is going to grow into you should that's why that's why the message is this Bible amen maybe the messages vital content that were now God has revealed on us work the way we should walk here amen you know we're not here I'll be thinking about you we're not here haphazard this is not a gathering this is not together your people are closed or what my family goes here or the people love me and I feel love here this is nice as walk out you know sure that you're part of an LLC part of it here and then we're elected group of people that God has gathered you know and there's a purpose that we are even sitting here you know there's a purpose that we have our families here is a purpose that we are here and we must identify God why do you place me in this place yes they will i'm jung yong i'm just raced here God placed you here for a purpose I've moved you here for a purplish unit and if we could identify that purpose then we can walk at what God has for us hey take Joseph you take Joseph he had the trendy good help having drinks yesterday they could help him spiritual he just had a couple of dreams but it so angered an assault that every you every step of his life that was that was always in front of them amen brother BAM says and the church age book just I'm probably jumping well ahead of myself but I'm not too worried about it he says he says no unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't rain because power apartment character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even as thrown on the same basis that he overcame and a sit down in his Father's throne then we have to overcome and sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes Oh what treasures are laid up for those that are willing to eat into his kingdom through much tribulation and you take you know because God has the white attributes that he wanted to express and we are part of those attributes amen this is a certain portion of God that he wants to display in you the event amen that's why that's why our duties you know we could identify that we have the same spirit of god in US but God will take us through through down different roads because he wants to express different things amen and if we don't understand what we're called to do then we'll begin to walk down the road and saying why am I going down this road right amen but God be pre pre would by God yes we are his attributes manifested upon the earth he knew exactly where you'd be sitting today he knew what close you'd be wearing he knew what breakfast you'd have men he knew we would be living just now he knows every you know if the Prophet could say that God Lord it every flea that with better side how much Tala would make Lord amen it say if he knows all the minor details of every part of every creature that ever been existence he knows like your life amen and he's ordained he's all day MacArthur we must walk yes amen but a week and we just look at the path for walking we can lose focus on while we're walking the path amen you know we have to we have to look at the end goal you
