TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] amen hey bless you saints welcome to the house of the lord it's another wednesday and we made it we're here a bit of a testimony it's quite nice that because we have less less times that we could be at church you know the kids starts asking you know when is our turn you know when can we go again and it's good to see because um i think when i was a young man i would ask when can i not go again because when we were back in the world we thought church was boring because we never took the time to stop and to listen you know because our minds were going all over the show but we never actually just stop and listen because the bible says he that have an ear led him here so sometimes we can be here and we can be miles away already doing tomorrow's chores and yesterday's things we could do better but why don't we just stop tonight and we listen i believe the lord has something special for us tonight brother anyas is going to be ministering for us tonight and i'm sure coming with a great expectation because what can the lord do what can the law do for us tonight so if you all just want to stand let's just open in a word of prayer and i'm going to invite two young men forward liam maybe you come forward as well ask them to come and sing a song with me come forward [Music] and they will just open their in the word of prayer [Music] gracious heavenly father oh it's wonderful lord to know that tonight we've come once more to hear those words of eternal life the encouragement lord and helping us to heal lord to surrender ourselves to learn more about you to understand your ways a bit better to understand ourselves a bit better lord jesus speaking to my dad this week it's a wonderful how we can make your example lord if we read the new testament lord and even the old testament that's the shadow of the new it just shows us so clearly lord that we can overcome if we just give chance lord that you would do the work through us the greater work lord and as we all come together tonight we ask lord they'll be here with us we're going to come here for no other reason than you it would be very disappointing lord if we came for any other reason because when you're here lord it's when things change when you speak to us then things change lord it just takes that one moment in the presence of god to throw away a complex to receive my healing lord to go a little bit more further with you lord jesus so i ask lord as you pass this way please don't pass us by just come and speak to me personally lord speak to every believer here lord everyone on the internet lord go speak to them father lord make it so real knock on their door call upon their hearts lord and lord whatever is in the way of you and us clear every channel in the name of jesus christ clear everything lord jesus may this next hour just be for you lord for your kingdom i asked lord if there is any spirit that came in this place lord that's against your contrary to your holy spirit lord that you would just cast that out in the name of jesus christ the name above all names lord and we ask that we'll have a clear understanding of what's coming over the pulpit and lord that you would reveal it to us because we know it's all about revelation so as we dedicate these songs to you lord jesus we welcome you in as we sit here tonight to listen lord you anoint the speaker you anoint the hearer lord so that we can just push this battle just that one little bit more step forward lord so we can go home one of these days lord we know there's still work to be done because we're still here so we ask lord teach us your ways in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen these young men are so very much they want to do to just be here tonight so i thought we're going to sing a song together so if you can just put that song up for us god is good all the time who knows the song we want to do it a little bit faster like god is good we're going to do it so let's go to um we'll start it slow like we always do it i think we're going to go into the nice fast rhythm george you know that one g for real oh we can do it in d let's go to d [Music] god is good all the time he put a song of praise [Music] goes through the darkest night and his light will shine god is gone his god is good all the time amen let's sing it god is cool yes all the time he put a song of praise in this heart of mine god is good yes he is night and his light will shine god is good oh yes he is oh yes he is all the time [Music] [Music] [Applause] and it happens and do not fear cause he will guide you and he will keep you safe [Applause] and his word is [Music] all the time through the darkest night his light will shine god is oh yes he's good all the time of course we were sinners it's so unworthy and still for us he chose to die he filled me with his holy spirit now i can stand and god [Music] amen oh god is his life will shine god is all the time we were sinners remember where we came from we were [Music] yet so unworthy and still for us he chose to die what did he do he filled us with amen his holy spirit now we can stand [Music] [Music] [Applause] all the time [Music] [Music] is [Music] they should have been nervous mike's will speak it is wonderful to see young people wanting to sing for the lord and not scared to come to the front and sing the reason sometimes you do those things is you want to be out of your comfort zone that's where god works with you when you really get past yourself and you're at that place where you're very uncomfortable and very unsure that's usually where god gets you and then he trains you teach you lifts you up and put you where you belong amen that's how i basically got songs singing a bit of a testimony that musicians didn't show up on wednesday and i got get in the guitar and say let's sing some songs and if you would ask me back then would i ever want a song lead again after that one session i would have gone no way it went that bad but praise the lord i'm still here and i figured out that it's actually when you come and stand here in the front the hardest work is you guys having to work and not us because we just start singing the song and you have to help us to sing it right so the preacher's off and now i can just sing for the lord and it's just all wonderful right amen we're all for real life people that love god amen let's sing the song because there is power in the blood who believes it when everything goes wrong all your sin throw it in the blood if you think you can't get through the next thing it's in the blood you have to remember that jesus christ paid that price so that you could use the blood that actually arrives but it's true he paid the price so that you can use it to overcome amen that's what this message is about is our lord jesus are we gonna need this one a bit faster sister i wonder there is power oh amen [Music] land [Music] is [Music] is [Music] blood of the land and would you be whiter amen i want to be whiter than snow this flower in his blood now we're in the blood [Music] our in the pressure blood of the lamb amen let's do service would you do service for jesus our king amen [Music] [Applause] oh yes there's power in the blood and would you live daily praises to sing this wonderful power in the blood there is power [Music] [Applause] in the pressures let's see that last one again would you do service say i would do service for jesus my king cause there's power in the blood power in the blood and i will live daily he's praises to see cause this wonderful power in his blood oh there is [Music] bow [Music] [Music] in the precious amen [Music] can take the unclean and make them clean the center make you a sight amen the last will be found we can go forever the weak will be strong amen amen [Music] and that's why let's go to the next one let's let's keep that one this is [Music] standing on the promises so with his power you see this power in the blood and there's a reason why we sing these songs like that they need with all these promises of healing forgiveness fruits of the spirit all the inheritance that we have in the land is now put in the book now you can claim it now but see you have to claim it because we say standing on the promises of christ my king but you can only stand on it when you claim it so remember with the gold rush when they were running brother on your side sorry but when they when they they used to go with the big gold rush they would send the guys out and you could claim your land because it's all open land and there where you stake your claim that's yours but you had to go and stake your claim so when you sing these songs don't just say i'm standing on the promises but you're not on it if you say i'm standing on the promise of healing then you stand on it if you're standing on the promise of my family will be delivered then you stand on it you don't stand backwards you put the claim there now god will come back and he will come and back that promise so when you sing this song and you say anything that you stand on the promise that god gave in the bible mean it and sing it these songs are not just songs for us to sing to get us all just in the spirit they are testimonies of what believers went through so if you sing it any other way you do yourself from great injustice because you're not reading what it's saying amen [Music] standing on the promises of christ my king through eternal ages let his praises free oh glory in the highest i will shout and sing cause i'm standing on the promises of god are you standing i'm standing standing [Applause] standing on the promises of christ my savior i'm standing standing i am standing on the promises of god and i'm standing on the promises that cannot fail do you believe that when the howling storms of doubt and fear sail and by the living word of god i shall prevail cause i'm standing on the promises of god oh yes i'm standing [Music] stand i am standing on the promises of god and i'm standing on the promises i now can see perfect prison cleansing in the blood for me you can claim it standing in the liberty where christ made free i am standing on the promises of god stand on those promises say standing don't let the devil move standing standing on the promises of god my savior i'm standing standing i am standing on the promises of god [Music] i am standing on the promises of christ the lord bow to him eternally by their love of stronghold amen overcoming daily with a spirit sword amen standing on the promises of god oh yes i'm standing standing i'm standing i'm standing on the promises of god my savior i'm standing standing [Music] i am standing on the promises of god cause i'm standing on the promises i cannot fail listening every moment to the spirit is gone resting [Applause] [Applause] standing on the promises of god my savior i'm standing standing [Music] oh yes i'm standing not lost first again please i'm standing on the promises i cannot fall listening every moment to the spirit score i'm resting in my savior amen oh yes i'm standing standing standing on the promises of god my savior i'm standing standing i am standing on the [Music] amen lord we're standing on your promises father glory lord amen what a confidence we have in you lord jesus that this promises that you put out there for his yay amen lord and that your word cannot fail it says i'm standing on the promises of god lord if we have any prayer request tonight you know it's a prayer meeting as well may those requests come forth tonight though may your bride speak lord and may she stand on your promises granted father for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen it's in the chorus i can [Music] face he lives is yes [Music]

of this little subject is believing in what's in your hand so i'll repeat that believing in what's in your hand so whatever it is you already have it all you need to do is to believe whatever it is so let's find out what it is let's just open with the word of prayer precious heavenly father we come humbly before thy throne tonight just to appreciate you and to thank you for bringing us here preachers heavenly father no one knew that we'll be here tonight but in your planning before the foundation of the world that was how you foresaw this sin we just want to commit everything unto you in the precious and wonderful name of follow jesus christ amen while we are still standing our reader of this scripture exodus chapter 4 from 1 to 8. exodus chapter 4 verses 1 to 8. sister maggie good to see you amen i don't know whether you're moving permanently or running away from taranaki or you're just visiting but whatever it's good to see you another visitors here i see sister kate's husband there as the husband no oh okay good to see you amen anyone else i have been greeted please let us know amen i'll read this here and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me no hacking unto my voice for they will say the lord has not appeared unto thee and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand so moses was already holding something in his hand and now god is asking moses what is that in thy hand and he said aaron and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a second and moses fled from before it and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and became a road in his hand that they may believe that the lord god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has appeared unto thee and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was left processed snow and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned against his other flesh and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither happened to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the letter sign you may take your seats now i'm looking at this man called moses now have you ever thought about this road that moses was using was it a special road did it really look special it was just a road so one time when he was out there heading sheep because that is what moses had been reduced to this is the man who was going to be a prince in egypt and he ran away from egypt and it says prabraham says it took god 40 years to to to take away all the knowledge from moses moses was going to be a great scientist he was a general they taught him everything because he was going to be the next pharaoh now it took god 40 years to take away all the equations from moses until he didn't understand what chemistry hydrogen and oxygen he forgot about it totally god put him in the back side where all he knew was counting sheep oh i had the 200 sheep here what happened to the other one his feet were no longer smooth because moses used to be washed by maidens yeah he didn't wash himself when he went into the tub there were some maidens that were washing him they wouldn't let him do anything because he was going to be a prince now look at moses now his feet are all cracked now his feet are all cracked oh he knows how to wear his sandals now no perfume no deodorants now and his beard is grown like that this is the man who was going to be a pharaoh in egypt so he has been reduced to forget about everything else and he said this is my life i got my wife he started even enjoying the desert the dust of the desert right and one day he was just moving about and he picked this road just on the ground it was just like another road there was nothing special about it then one day he missed jehovah he had heard about this god before and he would see this fire come down and go on the mountain what's really happening here but he never got close to the fire he's too dead a distance until one day he says no i really want to see what is going on there so he got closer and closer something kept telling me i want to find out what's happening ah there's a fire but it's not burning it's a fire that's been but there's no smoke what kind of a fire is this then a voice came from that fire moses moses who are you try to put yourself in his condition he was scared where is this voice coming from he looked for the man who was speaking he couldn't see the man but the voice sounded like a man but where is the man and now that voice who has just said i am your god i am jehovah he asks moses now moses what is that in thy hand and moses is a rod now moses was surprised can you not see that i'm carrying a road what is this got to do with going to egypt yeah it's a road it's just a stick that i picked some years ago and i'm using for ship and said now throw that road on the ground now can you imagine this road that moses has been using all these years suddenly turns into a big do you think it was a small snake you really think it was a small green snake that was screamed and ran from no this was a thick viper and this viper raised his head and looked at moses and moses screamed he said hey this voice wants me to be killed by this how can my road the road i've been carrying is now turned into a snake no no no no and the voice didn't let moses go he thought no he says touch what you want me to hold and this neck was not making it easy do you think the snake was looking away and running away no the snake raised his head and it was looking at moses and the voice said go touch the tail he please please please do i need to do this please i'm just a sheep header i'm just a sheephead i've got nothing to do with egypt i ran away from egypt and i've got nothing to do with egypt touch the tail oh god so you tried and snick he tried until somebody said no i'll do it anyhow he grabbed the tail ah and then it changed back into into the same road what's happening here this is supernatural it's like what you said brother a man moses was no longer in his comfort zone i've never come this far something's happening here something's happening here says yeah did you see what has happened your road is now turned into back that snake so it's a road is there anything special about this road no it's just the same road i've been using all this time so you see what was in the road you were carrying all the time now your road has come become a snake and it is turned back into the original do you want another sign moses so right there moses was starting to believe moses was starting to believe this was a road he had been caring all the time nothing special about this road it's just like another road this one only became special because that was the road that moses was carrying at that particular time that was the road that was in his hand and now god is using that road that is in your hand [Music] you want another sign moses see we wondered now so okay it was a road i'm not carrying anything else so what is he gonna use now see now take your hand now take your hand and put it under your armpit okay i'll do it moses did it take it out the end was diseased now full of wounds where did these wounds come from he says what do you see moses my hand is now disease says take it back put it back in your armpit you put it back in his armpit take it out moses moses took it out what's happened moses and the same hand he was born with that hand moses was not a so he actually grew up with his own hand when he was small his hand was small when he was 10 years old his hand was 10 years old when he was 20 years old his hand was 20 years if there were scars he knew his hand because it was his hand now that hand that he had put it under your armpit god didn't say zip your wife's hand no your hand put it under your armpit and tell me what's happening i see wounds now take it back it's clean so do you want any other signs moses no no no no i'm not gonna try you i've never seen my own road i always thought this road was just for sheep now this road only saturn has become a snake so you see now when you go before pharaoh now go back now to pharaoh i've given you the signs now go use those signs and pharaoh is going to believe you so if you ever watched the film 10 commandments the movie when moses went up the mountain he was just the man that his wife knew but when he walked back home his hair he turned white he was walking like a man in a dream he was just walking like that and the wife was saying hey what happened to my husband he was looking at him but it was like he was looking through here because all he could see was that fire all he could hear was that voice so him even the children were running to death and say hey something has changed it's still dead but what has happened to him he's walking different he was now anointed with what he has seen that experience changed moses this this is not just a road he started respecting that road where he used to go home because he's tired and hungry after a long day of heading sheep he would just throw that road away but this time he didn't just throw it away it became a special rod the children were trying to play with through no no no no no no what is happening to dad we have been playing with this no no no not this one and he put it against the wall the wife tried to say no but no no no no leave it it has to stay there what really happened there we are going back to egypt we are going back to egypt are you serious i'm not going back to egypt i am not going back to egypt they are looking for you you are made out of they are looking for you you are wanted man we are going back to egypt we are going back to it there was no and there's no argument about it moses is saying you are my wife children get the children in order we are going back to egypt we are going back to egypt how are we going back to egypt says god has given me a sign he has given me a sign those two so these two signs are going to deliver the children of israel that superpower we are going they are going to be delivered by two signs yes they are going to be delivered by two signs before i go to the next one i'm sure some of you remember brother shannon from south africa he came to zimbabwe and he said this testimony in church he's a pastor he is a pastor who is a church things financially were hard in the home no money no money for food and he is a pastor who stands in front of a church and is preaching about the god of miracles but there's no food in the house what does a pasta do now pick the phone and phone the deacon brother kuben things are tough out here man do you think you can lend me some money just between us just feeling the things are bad no milk in the house if i phoned the deal suppose it doesn't have the money what happens now do i fund the trustee again suppose the trustee doesn't have money maybe i should try that brother who is a business suppose he doesn't have the money then the five people in the church are going to know that the pastor doesn't have money but on sunday i was up preaching about this god of miracles this one is a tough one this one is a tough one what do i do you preach faith don't you so what is in your hands pastor man of god what is in your hands is facing you now this situation is right in your hands you are a believer you believe in god don't you now you are facing a mountain now we need to cross over you need food in the house the children are crying the wife is not talking to you because she needs food in the house you try to greet her she didn't answer you not because she's a bad woman but she needs a solution we need food in the house inside he came to a point where i said no i'm a child of god this got nothing to do with me god i believe in your word i'm a believer and i need food in the house i'm not asking for a car right now all i need is food in the house so he says he went to the supermarket no money in the pocket he grabbed a trolley says i'm going to put whatever told his wife just tell me whatever you need write a list i'm going to go to the supermarket so he went to the supermarket with a trolley no money and he's there hello there pastor hello there hello dad now i didn't wear a long face now to show the world that

for you to pay shall i lie that i forgot in my my person oh ah no this is for god this is what is in my hand i believe in god so this is time for god himself to prove that i believe in him so he pushed just before he got to the table past he looked the brother came running he brother came running hey yeah i was looking for you went home and your wife told me sister told me you'd come here i

you drive home you bought a car brother just get the children ready we are going to taranaki did you steal the car just get the children in the car we are going to taranaki we got a car we going how do you know you come back and say say actually we've just decided to have a special promotion for this type of car we don't want to take it from you now we don't want to take it from you because hey just drive it around just drive it around you are just advertising the car now i'll tell you this testimony this is a friend of mine he's a civil engineer back in zimbabwe there's this brother is mightily used by god to pray for sick people he's also a pastor so he came and slept at this brother's home he was going to preach somewhere so this brother well they were fellowshipping says he's a businessman this brother this friend of mine is a businessman he's a civil engineer builds roads dams and all that he wasn't getting the orders but he had a desire to buy you know some trucks and whatever so he's just fellowshipping with this brother you know if really the business was picking up this is what i would really like you know to buy this but i've got no money he takes this brother to where he was preaching so when his brothers was preaching he just felt inspired he said brother so-and-so and he looked yes you brother come up here and get your truck that's in church come up and get your truck he doubt it come up and get my truck i think i told this brother that i've got no money in the bank how can i go there and get my truck then the brother won't let him go brother come up and get your truck until he failed no i just have to go but inside himself i said how do i get a truck no money in the bank and i've got no business so he went the brother just said receive your truck in the name of the lord right so the brother no prayer is just told come up and get your truck goes back home a few days later a company that sells brand new trucks phoned him miss so and so we know your business man we've got some trucks that we are selling no no no no no no i don't even have money i don't even have money no no no no you don't have to pay us now all you do is just accept the truck then when you get the money whenever we're not giving you conditions you can pay us i am telling you there is absolutely no way now listen to what he's saying now you are now reducing your goal now there's absolutely no way i can pay and god is listening now you are making me cheap now you are saying i can't give you money there's absolutely no way in your little mind there's absolutely no way you can own it but you are saying you need that track for your business and he thought it was over later we have come to see you but i told you gentlemen there's no way i can pay we have come to live it here we have come to leave it here and he told me he didn't know where the money came from mysteriously he got that money because god has given you whatever you need but what's bothering you is your reasoning they advertise a job and they say they are looking for phd they are looking for phd did you know that some phds won't even apply for that job okay you don't have phd so you are in a comfort zone well i never got that far i don't even have the first degree how can i even think about a phd it's not for me you have closed the door you have closed the door how high is your faith no the phd guys come you think they'll claim it they're looking at it hey yeah i do have a phd but they are saying you need to have 10 years experience i don't have 10 years experience i got 2 years experience they don't apply you are a child of god phd or no ph.d [Music] dsa i'm interested in this job i don't have a phd no tertiary qualification but i am interested god is going to block all the phds if some of them apply their applications will be serious great loss then come closing day it's only your application that will appear on the desk hey we've been waiting we really need to give this job operations manager job but hey we only have one application okay let's look at it we can't extend because we really need hey this guy only did all levels did he really understand what we're looking for we said phd this is an older guy this is crazy man why can't people be serious let me read further what does he say about then now let's just call him just call him put you in your nice suit call you for interview miss so-and-so we are curious because we really said phd did you really read and understand what we said i did so then why did you apply because i know i can do the job i can do the job so it's not a problem how can you do you will train me you know exactly what it is you need so i'm sure you've got the means to train me to the standard that you want you will get it because you claimed it you want it so god now is challenged he wants to show that he's god but your fear is always getting in the way i want a child lord i want a child yes you want a child what are you doing about it start wearing the maternity clothes start wearing the maternity clothes that's your part yeah i want a child if you don't give me the child people are going to laugh at you because they know i go to church so i'm going to wear the maternity clothes if it gets to 10 months and 11 months and the child is not delivered then it's your fault i've got nothing to do with it i'm going to be declaring right now that i'm pregnant that's what is in your hands so show your faith show your faith we are not getting what we need not because god is refusing but because we don't believe what is in our hands what is in your hand today so that was moses i'll go to someone else here what is in your hand that spoken word notice moses said lord i can't go but god was determined he was going and he said moses you must go there's no negotiation about it there's no negotiation about it you must get what you want because you're a child of god what excuse do we have no to get what we want when we are children of god as god said no why are you here tonight there are so many places to go isn't it films a lot of films out there netflix is full of new films that you can be watching right now why are you here it's because you believe in god isn't it so put into the challenge show god your road i'm a believer look back at your life there are things that have happened in your life don't worry about the brother next door don't worry about this just look back at what god has done in your own life take time to look back but what happened that time when we know food in the house what happened that time when we needed this who did that that was god wasn't it so why am i doubting what's causing me to doubt what's causing me to doubt no no no from right now from right now i'm gonna start believing if you need it if you have a desire for something if you have a desire for something well if you married and you're desiring someone's wife that has got nothing to do with god but if your desire is noble god will say yes i want to challenge you tell me what you want and the bible even says ask for big things yes ask for big things a phone just comes from nowhere from a

also i believe or the message the house somewhere she had come to beat my wife knock on the door who is knocking at this time of the night my wife says hey you haven't you come to the pastor yeah i'm coming from there so but you were supposed to go there and pray i said i've got a job you got a job at night you got a job at night where you interviewed no i wasn't interviewed but i got a job a real job a real job i'm starting on monday i'm starting on monday so those are the things i look back in my life when the devil rises in storm i said hey who was that one who gave me a job at night wasn't that a testimony i'm supposed to speak about when things go bad what happened there and that same god is always faithful you must go back at the beginning and when god answers your prayer what was the state of your mind when god answered your prayers what were you thinking of when he gave you money were you not thinking of god were you not listening to a tape were you not singing about the things of god amen how were you acting in the house of god when you answered your prayer were you showing that things are hard did you come to the house of god and stand there you weren't even singing you were showing oh things are hard you were doing the devil a favor you know what you were doing you were telling the devil that your god is powerless your situation is so hard that you can't even sing in the house of god your situation is so hard i can't even say amen because there's no food in the house what about calvary how much do you oh god for calvary what about the air you are breathing if god just said for each time you're breathing in air it's a scent how much would you owe at the end of the day and you dare accuse my god that he doesn't love you he said what is in your hand it's you that shows a packet of doritos yeah you decided to choose a packet of doritos isn't it you were told choose what you want but you looked at your height you looked at your family background you looked at your education and everything was against you did you know you were doing the devil a favor when you were supposed to stand and say no no no no no i'm a child of god i'm holding a road in my hand and this road here will give me all that i need the prophet says your situation is totally nothing to do the word of god is still the same i don't know about my time i don't want to get it so now i read this one here i was talking about he noticed moses said lord i can't go but god was determined that he was going and he said moses now put your name there put your name there instead of moses put your name mo you must go and he said show me your glory lord and notice god told moses what is that in your hand so god is asking you today you know what that man at the pool of besides he was full of excuses 38 years 38 years when you really look at it look he had come a long way isn't it here you look at it each time he jumps in the water someone has been there before him someone is healed but what caused that man to keep coming back here the right to have a grudge with god but you don't have a right to have a grudge he kept coming and others are praising god he comes he even pays money you know what what is going to happen is wealthy what i state young men please just push me in the water yeah so those people took the money by the time they pushed him in someone was there already i got no one in the world i've got no friends no friends he had no relatives it was just him alone but come next year the man is back again he's back again you know what he had in his hands faith that faith would not keep him still but i've seen people healed i'll keep going and notice god told moses what is that in your hand he said it's a stick or a rod just an old dry stick of the desert where he'd walked along with it in his end that may be all that he had was a stick maybe you you even you maybe you haven't even got that much but whatever you got give it to god what do you have tonight if you got faith give it to god he says whatever you got give it to that's what he's going to work with god is going to work with your situation so whatever it is give it to god look what he did with that stick why what was in his hand a slingshot but god was with him that's the main thing is god with you tonight he's with you that's why you are here because you believe in his so don't listen to that voice of doubt say i'm a child of god yes from today i am not going to doubt each time you pull out the spoken words from the archives you are fitting on them your faith is rising your faith is positioning you to claim what you need that's the main thing whether you got a bachelor's degree or a degree of art or whatever you got if you got christ in you what difference does it matter so whether you are educated tonight whether you're undereducated the kingdom of god has got nothing to do with your education so don't go about if you're having a long face i don't have a degree i i can't get you know a brother is being so blessed so much because he's got a degree he is using he is believing in what he is in his hand he has a degree and he is using the degree what do you have in your hand that's what you use use what you have in your hand but you have to believe in what you have in your hand whether you know your abc's or whatever you do know as long as you know jesus christ in the power of his resurrection do you know jesus christ in the power of his resurrection tonight that's what you have to know second kings chapter 4 verse 1-7 now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy seven did fear the lord so the good thing here is that this man feared the lord but he is a situation where he left a wife there's nothing in the house no pension no savings she was destitute now you know what happened the creditor came he tried he looked around no cause nothing nothing nothing until he was taking the children can you imagine the creditor now you are so poor now that the creditor is taking your children to work for him to pay off your husband's debt and elisha said unto her now remember where did she go where did she go social welfare was there but maybe it was tired now mom we helped you last time no we can't anymore we go to other people also to help but the children there's no no no no we can't do this anymore so the doors were closed but there was a prophet in the land there was a prophet in the land isn't there a prophet in the land today who is william branham to you isn't there prophet in the land today isn't there the word today what did he tell you feed on the spoken word keep listening to those steps keep reading keep feeding on them you will get your rapturing faith from them so do what the word says so the prophet says unto this woman what shall i do for thee tell me what is thou in the house what do you have in the house what do you have in your hands and she said thine handmaid has not anything in the house save a pot of oil so all she had in the house was a pot off now do you think it was a big pot do you think that pot was full of oil no maybe she had actually borrowed from a neighbor and the neighbor said we are we are tired of this each time you are begging a big that's not your husband should have solved his problems queer can't look after you we are not related to you she was begging for food says all i have in the house is a pot of then elisha said go borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty bottles borrow not a few so there is nothing in the house just a pot of oil and your situation is what god is going to use to bless you you are busy complaining i shouldn't be in this situation but that's exactly what god is going to use to bless you so those empty vessels now the prophet now says go borrow empty vessels go borrow empty vessels your solution is in your empty vessels because that is what you have oh i don't have any education it doesn't matter god is going to use that lack of education to show that is god oh i'm a god is going to use your situation to show that he's god go borrow empty vessels and borrow not a few told the children we have to borrow empty vessels they've got tired went to this one are you using your drum oh you can't have it you can they started laughing at hands followed everything put out everything until don't stop you don't believe faith is not going to let you rest faith is going to make you claim more and more faith doesn't claim a small hill when there's a mountain that's not faith you're doubting i want to give you a mountain no lord i'm just happy to have this small hill why can't you have a mountain i'm just happy to have a small hill what happens if god wants you to have a bus then you can take us to the convention can't you here then you can take us to the convention we want someone to have faith of a jumbo jet get a jumbo jet how long can we spend 10 hours to go to a convention in auckland huh we are all getting in touch with each other where are you now brother where are you oh i'm stuck at phuketia bay i'm stuck in the traffic congestion here what about you sister kay anyway where are you oh i haven't even got to attack yet i'm just stuck here but what about you sister ah you know i just passed i just passed the bulls i don't know what's happening why can't we have someone who can buy a jumbo jet here huh we are too used to standing in a queue when we are traveling somewhere oh you almost wish each time you go to the airport you are putting a queue sometimes they are cutting your bag to check for drugs hey to check for drugs in a suitcase of a child of god you are being reduced a dog is following me because you are being mistaken for a drug trafficker when you're a child of god no lord we are tired of this we tired of this we want our own planes brethren i've just bought a plane it carries 300 so we need nums don't worry i'll put the bill for the fuel we just want numbers we have our convention and done it then so we're providing the transport my plan is to take you out there but do we want planes we are too used to these traffic congestions we almost pray that there are no traffic congestions but they will be there just come out of the house 10 minutes in the traffic condition and you are going to save your god you are going to save your and the unbelievers do you know what happened with this coffee deal the unbelievers were buying planes yeah they've never had this so good buying planes they said no we're not staying in a queue i just get aboard my plane so while we are cutting these cues the unbelievers are enjoying themselves and now when we take the word to them they think we want their money they think we want there i don't think they it's really they want my money they want to take my money so we want to claim there's nothing wrong with claiming for a plane i'm not here to tell you to claim a plane if you don't never want to take play so don't take me wrong i'm just saying don't limit your faith because it's right there in your hands it's time to stop having excuses about our situation because the word tells us that our god is real our god is real he's more than able to grant us all that we need i'll just quickly read this here so i've already spoken about this man from the pool of the siddha all right now brother pranam this old man always touches me congressman i'm sure you know how long he was in a wheelchair 66 years 66 years hey that's not a joke in a wheelchair but the man never felt pity for himself he never felt pity for himself he was even a congressman in a wheelchair he was even a congressman no pity he went to oral roberts to be prayed for if meetings of healing he would go there why was god not allowing him to be healed so that we would learn from his faith he was holding on to his road he was holding on to his then one day someone told him there is a prophet in the land there is a man called william branham i want to go to that meeting i want to go to that meeting as i started to tend to the woman i looked going down across the audience and here went that old congressman this is from the spoken word has the lord spoken only to moses now he was dressed with a blue suit and a red tie on which if any of you know him that was his very way he liked to dress but this time he had on a brown suit light brown with a white stripe in it and he had owned one of these heads like i wear frankly he is the one that sends them to me so he had one of those heads on southern head little stetson and he was going along tipping his head with this very southern hospitality you know tipping his head very gentlemen like going down the street like that walking down over the people so this is brother branham he's on the stage he's during a discernment praying for sick people and he sees this congressman who is in a wheelchair but he sees him walking over the people and tipping his head so and he said to him congressman yes my son he said do you own a teen striped suit he said i bought one three days ago and brother branham says god has honored your faith god has honored your faith rise up congressmen and receive your healing now if the congressman for 66 years was just complaining about god complaining you are a to begin with you need help but all you are doing about your situation is complaining to god why did you put me in this why did you put me in this wheelchair until the congressman was healed you know he lived for two years he lived 66 years in the wheelchair to be healed to live just for two years to testify to the whole world about the healing of god and he went before kings so these kings that did not believe the message of the hour on the day of judgment they will answer because god will say you know this man he was healed and he came to you king george he came to you you saw him standing after being in a wheelchair for 66 years why why didn't you believe why didn't you believe he knew all these big presidents and he went to them and they could see that man who was here crippled is now standing is healed what's our excuse today each time we look at the spoken word there's discernment there is discernment someone is being healed someone without eyes receiving his sight someone without faith working out with feet women without you every situation under the sun god dealt with it why so that today you know exactly who you are you know who you you are you stop wearing a long face in the house of god you start singing like you've never sung before you start this new experience like moses that road in your hands that faith that you have let me start doing wonders to you now don't pack it oh i believe in god i believe in god then why are you not testifying why are you not claiming what you want if you really believe in god why are you allowing the situation to put you where you are i came in this country two years ago on 18 february so it's almost two years now exactly a year later i was operated on cancer why did it have to be 18. it could have been another debt but it was exactly the date i came into new zealand now exactly a year later cancer because god is telling me always remember i healed you of cancer and he gave me a sign he gave me a sign do you ever want to see the dove that came on my window it came it's no white dove i saw it it worked there it was looking at me it didn't fly away go to strike i've healed you i'll give you the sign i took it my wife and them they took the photos of that and they've got the videos of that so what happened to florence nightingale when brother branham went to england that woman who was dying of cancer that god is still alive that's why i didn't die then because i was supposed to stand here and tell you our god is still a healer and tell you that your situation is too small for my god your situation is too small for my god challenge him challenge my god he wants you to challenge him with whatever situation you have tonight amen we have brother ben there he can pray for you rather than if there's anyone here tonight that want you to lay hands on them i just feel feel free you want your faith to rise to a level where you never allow that devil to whisper anything in your ear this is your opportunity to say lord i'm sorry i've always said moses yes the road in his hands you get excited it's good to get excited but what is the lesson behind the world it is what moses said god is going to use your situation so don't look down on your situation thank god for your situation because that's what god wants to use to bless you but first of all you have to believe the rod believe what is in your hand and what is in your hand let it be faith tonight amen don't leave this place without faith claim whatever it is from the lord because the word says believe in what is in your hand amen he's cold in simply city now revealed in humility [Music] king of kings a lot of laws his name is called the word of god he's called in simply city he's called in simply city now revealed in humility oh king of kings and lord of lords his name is called the word of god is called in simplicity his call in simply city now revealed in humility oh king of kings a lot of love he name is called the word of god is god his simplicity he's called in simply city [Music] [Music] [Music] o king of kings the lord of lords god the word of god is god he's simply silly amen who wants to have unlimited faith not limited faith unlimited faith amen you know when brother kaido was here so i just real quick kind of testimony we were in the middle of wellington and there was some real nice car there and he said you know brother ben god can give you that car and i thought in my mind no he wouldn't he wouldn't but why not emma why not why should i limit god if god wanted to give me that he could give me the whole car parkful but why should in my mind say no you know i i wrote down my notes we can believe god all things are possible the law with healing and deliverance what about natural things as well he's god over everything i mean so let's let's bow our heads you want to be remembered and pray and raise your hand to the lord who wants unlimited faith i ask the question again gracious heavenly father lord we just want to come to you this night first confessing our wrong lord i ask you to forgive us of our unbelief father for not taking you completely at your word lord for lord jesus just lord doubting what you can do in our lives father not walking by eyes of faith lord but by walking by lord our natural eyes and who we think we are and what we deserve and different things lord you can do anything lord you can give us anything lord jesus we don't want to limit our faith anymore father we even think lord these last few weeks me and my darling wife at home lord as as you've been providing for us over and over again lord just to show me lord that i can't limit you no more lord on anything so father i prayed forgive us of our sin forgive me of my sin lord for limiting you lord you can do anything you want so father i pray lord you just unlock our faith like never before father you're more than just a healer more than just a savior you're our provider father and you're an unlimited lord we do not want to limit you in any way in our lives so dear god i pray just increase our faith lord like never before father i pray our past wouldn't hold us back lord what others would think of us wouldn't hold us back lord jesus unbelief wouldn't hold us back oh god but may we believe that all things are possible father he said ask and your joy shall be full ask anything in my name and it shall be done lord these are the promises you've made to us in your word so father from now on we want to take you at your worded lord for every part of our life lord jesus we thank you dear god we want to claim every promise father in jesus christ's name we thank you for the word tonight we thank you lord we are in a different economy lord jesus this world is falling apart prices are skyrocketing but lord you're still our provider father we thank you for that oh god maybe walk by faith from now on in jesus christ's name amen amen praise the lord amen thank you brother onyas amen god bless you amen amen i believe the lord wants to challenge our faith we should take him for his word for everything amen um where's brother can i turn the servers over do you sing a few songs amen praise the lord god bless you brother honest if you knew how accurate your preaching is amen um amen praise the lord let's sing um bless the lord o my soul hallelujah let's give the lord praise tonight [Music] [Music] name oh bless the lord like never before [Music] oh my soul the lord [Music] [Music] your only name sing like never [Music] name [Music] [Applause] [Music] and

i see the evidence of your goodness if you can just start playing that let's just all pray together tonight while she's singing and playing it just forget about yourself now remember what brother anya said i don't i do believe it's not brother onions that said it so many times we sell ourselves short and we belittle our god and we have a wonderful god that is true and powerful and he's never lost a battle he's never failed and even when i was dark and in sin he still chose to came and give me another chance but see we belittle our god because we proclaim that we can't do it let's leave that now as we pray to god let's confess that he is worthy that he is faithful and that he can do whatever he can do because he's sovereign is almighty he can deliver the greatest sinner he can set free your brother he can help your sister he can heal cancer he can defeat death you ask lazarus you ask lazarus what happened that day he will testify that my god is greater than anything but what we do is we choose to listen to that bluff when the enemy comes in and says boo we listen to that book so i encourage you now ask for forgiveness ask the lord to forgive you for doubting for forgiving you for just thinking that he cannot do it nothing is impossible the prophet of god said all things are possible them that believe and what happened on that day is he said the angel of the lord said to the prophet he says if you can get the people to believe all things are possible so i encourage you now let's just pray together and ask our god to do the impossible amen and let's see how god would raise that standard oh gracious heavenly father oh lord we come before you tonight lord we are emotional and we come with the expectation lord because we know you can deliver lord we know that you are the mighty conqueror lord and this is a close case lord and the devil might tell us whatever he wants to tell us lord but in the name of jesus christ we say the devil you are defeated and you take your hands of our family and you take your hands of our friends lord lord and there's many of us that comes before you tonight lord i pray for deliverance lord i pray for a mighty deliverance in our life no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe [Music] if i look in it seems like it's broken i'll lay a hallelujah and if i look in it seems like it's over la la hallelujah on the altar [Music] he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle [Music] no matter what i feel no matter what i hear i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i look and it seems like it's broken how late seems like it's over on the altar [Music] because he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a
