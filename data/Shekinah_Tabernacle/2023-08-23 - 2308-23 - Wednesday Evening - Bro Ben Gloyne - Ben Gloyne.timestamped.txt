[26:48] evening in Jesus Christ's name amen
[26:52] amen so well-known scriptures we know
[26:54] James 4 and 7 and 8 says submit
[26:57] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[26:59] devil and he'll flee from you draw night
[27:01] to God and he'll draw night to you
[27:03] cleanse your hearts ye Sinners and
[27:04] purify your I mean sorry cleanse your
[27:07] hands he Sinners and purify your hearts
[27:08] ye double-minded amen may the Lord bless
[27:12] the reading of his word you may have
[27:13] your seats tonight I want to speak about
[27:15] tapping into the resources of God where
[27:19] brother Braham said that there's
[27:20] untapped resources in God there's parts
[27:22] of his character that have not been
[27:24] really tapped into until it's full well
[27:26] maybe if I could say full potential like
[27:29] like like we can access in this day you
[27:31] know we have an ability this day to to
[27:34] to draw a night to God and we know that
[27:36] you know many people use the scripture
[27:37] say well I'm drawing night to God and
[27:39] they do some human kind of effort to do
[27:41] that but really the reason there's got
[27:43] to be a reason why we want to draw night
[27:45] to God you know we need him to come on
[27:46] the scene like never before you know we
[27:48] need God more than ever today you know
[27:50] we really need him amen every day we
[27:52] needed more than the day before you know
[27:54] we need him in our lives and we need his
[27:56] presence we need his guidance and his
[27:57] counsel and his love and his protection
[27:59] and his hand of Deliverance and so so
[28:01] you know there's a reason why we draw
[28:03] night to God now it's amazing when you
[28:05] think about it that God has built us to
[28:07] to draw night to him you know he wants
[28:10] us to be closer to him that we want to
[28:12] be closer to him you know he wants us
[28:14] right by his side and you know he loves
[28:16] us with an unfailing love and you know
[28:18] he wants us to draw night to him that we
[28:20] can tap into his attributes now brother
[28:23] bam says this about the contest you know
[28:25] there's a contest there's a test of
[28:26] strength and we where we have the um um
[28:29] we have the test strength we used to
[28:32] have the Indians used to put a fire and
[28:33] they would put so many men on this side
[28:35] of the end of the rope and so many on
[28:37] this end and the tug of war the contest
[28:39] of strength would pull the losing party
[28:40] across the fire now we know there's many
[28:43] things that that we could base us upon
[28:45] for a few minutes of contest but I want
[28:47] to speak of these
[28:48] for these minutes quickly upon the
[28:50] greatest contest there is that is
[28:52] between the church and Satan that great
[28:55] test of Satan and we want to speak of
[28:57] the great strength of God in his church
[28:59] amen so he says now this now this great
[29:02] contest has been going on for many years
[29:04] it started in heaven and Satan was
[29:07] kicked out into the Earth and then he
[29:08] become an enemy to God's people and
[29:10] since then he's used all of his strength
[29:13] and his strategy to try and pull God's
[29:15] people across the fires or into his
[29:17] fires and we know that who has the most
[29:20] power God does and God when he gave his
[29:24] power his people the best thing that he
[29:26] could to combat Satan with was his word
[29:29] now because the word is God who's
[29:31] stronger than God so the word is God and
[29:34] the word became our strength God in the
[29:36] church became its strength to pull Satan
[29:39] to his own fires that he has made and
[29:42] the tug goes on now Jesus said in Mark
[29:44] 16 in my name they shall cast out devil
[29:47] so there's a great contest of strength
[29:49] going on and it's the power of God in
[29:52] his church against Satan and his power
[29:54] now as we just read we know who the
[29:56] greatest one is which is God he's more
[29:58] powerful than the devil can ever be now
[30:01] in a tug of war match the strongest one
[30:03] is the anchor on the end
[30:06] many times people think who are pulling
[30:08] they think they're doing the job but
[30:09] it's actually the anchor just standing
[30:11] there with you I can't make them you
[30:12] know can't make them move forward you
[30:14] know and you know our anchor is the Lord
[30:16] Jesus Christ I mean he's the strongest
[30:18] one there ever was you know he can't be
[30:19] pulled amen and when you realize that
[30:22] you know where where the Bible says I
[30:24] don't have the scripture on me it says
[30:25] he that heareth my words and believeth
[30:27] on him that sent me has passed shall not
[30:30] come to the condemnation but has passed
[30:32] from Death unto life now that
[30:34] condemnation Jesus speaking about there
[30:36] in John chapter 5 is the great white
[30:38] Throne judgment so if you hear his words
[30:40] and believeth on him that sent him right
[30:43] you shall not go to the condemnation now
[30:46] that is not just a Baptist give your
[30:48] life to the Lord give your heart to the
[30:49] Lord kind of justification in scripture
[30:51] that's a bright scripture I mean where
[30:53] God Reveals His word to you and you
[30:55] believe it amen God sets you on a course
[30:58] not to the great white Throne judgment
[31:00] amen but to the New Jerusalem Hallelujah
[31:03] sets you on a course into a Rapture amen
[31:06] and and so now if that's the case we
[31:08] cannot be pulled into the devil's fire
[31:10] Hallelujah
[31:14] show going on but if you're real if your
[31:17] name is really on the Lamb's Book of
[31:19] Life you cannot be pulled into that fire
[31:20] it's impossible for you to be pulled in
[31:23] amen maybe others sure but you can't be
[31:25] pulled in I mean so now if you can't be
[31:28] pulled in then there's only one thing
[31:29] you can do pull him in amen so now
[31:32] there's a test of strength going on
[31:33] where we can pull the devil into his
[31:35] fires I mean we can pull him onto his
[31:37] face drag him through the mud Into the
[31:39] Fire amen because God wants to prove his
[31:41] strength in the church amen he doesn't
[31:43] see brother Brown says God hates a
[31:45] powerless religion amen because God is
[31:47] full of Power full of Might full of
[31:49] ability amen and he put that ability
[31:52] because of his life that came into the
[31:53] church that same ability is in you and I
[31:55] tonight amen so we have the privilege of
[31:58] pulling Satan Into the Fire
[32:00] hallelujah amen we have the privilege I
[32:02] mean to make the devil look like a fool
[32:05] that's really the Lord in you that makes
[32:07] the devil look like a fool amen because
[32:09] remember a testimony is that the Lord's
[32:12] doing it's not us we can't boast Amen in
[32:14] any testimony because it's what God has
[32:16] done that matters right so there's a
[32:19] test of strength going on now we are we
[32:22] have an anchor of the Soul
[32:24] both sure and steadfast which entered in
[32:27] uh into that is within the veil I mean
[32:30] so so we have an anchor so so there's an
[32:33] anchor on our rope which is the Lord
[32:35] Jesus Christ he's the Anchorman he's the
[32:37] main one you know I don't know if you've
[32:38] ever seen like kids doing tug of war
[32:40] there's two adults on the end maybe you
[32:42] know and the kids think they're gonna
[32:43] pull the other team over it's just
[32:44] really the anchor guy pulling it like
[32:46] this right you know it's the same thing
[32:47] with the Lord we think yeah praise the
[32:49] Lord you know we're really doing
[32:50] something that's really God in us just
[32:51] pulling pulling the devil into his fire
[32:53] amen but we have an anchor of the Soul
[32:56] now brother Brown would speak about a
[32:58] lover so you say it'd be like someone
[32:59] flying a kite and then the then the
[33:01] clouds come down and they can't see they
[33:04] can't see where their kite is but
[33:05] because they feel the tug they know the
[33:07] kite's there now the storms of life can
[33:09] come in trouble can come in amen it
[33:11] looks like you're separated from God you
[33:13] don't know what's going on but you still
[33:15] feel that tug I mean you still feel
[33:17] you're anchored somewhere Hallelujah in
[33:19] that anchor I mean that Anchor Holds
[33:21] both sure and steadfast now if
[33:24] something's think it it cannot move I
[33:27] mean when Anything Is Anchored it can't
[33:29] move God makes you immovable
[33:33] you're fixed
[33:34] amen I have an anchor that keeps me
[33:36] whole steadfast and sure when the sea
[33:39] blows roll anchored in the rock that
[33:41] makes me hold grounded safe and sure and
[33:43] the savior's love this anchor when I was
[33:45] out um Yonder beyond the spray one day
[33:48] one day God took this poor Lost Sinner
[33:50] and pulled him through that spray yes
[33:52] sir and brought him over here and
[33:54] anchored me in there put his arms around
[33:56] me and everything else no matter what it
[33:59] is amen my soul looks up to thee see
[34:01] have an anchor steadfast and Shore so no
[34:05] matter what it is if it's peer pressure
[34:06] amen if it's mind battles whatever it is
[34:10] things going on in the world things
[34:11] going on in the family things going
[34:12] within and without doesn't matter what
[34:14] it is amen my soul looks up to thee amen
[34:18] amen Heaven anchor steadfast and sure
[34:20] see we're not called just to drift with
[34:22] the world we don't just have some
[34:24] Dragnet that we're holding on to like a
[34:26] you know there's such a thing that
[34:27] Yachts have when they're when they're
[34:29] deep in the ocean they have a they have
[34:30] a sea anchor but that sea anchor is not
[34:33] fixed to anything on the ground you know
[34:34] something that just drags behind the
[34:37] boat we don't have that kind of an
[34:39] anchor we have something that's anchored
[34:41] to the Rock of Ages himself amen that's
[34:43] where our anchor is so no matter what it
[34:45] is we're not going to drift with the
[34:46] storms we're going to stay steadfast
[34:48] because he's keeping us steadfast
[34:51] Hallelujah it doesn't matter what the
[34:52] rest of the world is doing amen westang
[34:54] steadfast with this word
[34:56] amen and it's worth every every inch of
[34:59] it amen
[35:01] Hallelujah now God has attributes we
[35:03] know we know enem was to be you know and
[35:05] then before the foundation of the world
[35:06] there was attributes to be a father to
[35:09] be a son to be a provider to be a
[35:11] redeemer to be protected to be a God to
[35:14] be a husband to be a comforter to be a
[35:16] counselor you know all those things are
[35:18] in him
[35:19] but now he has to he had to he didn't
[35:22] just want to keep those parts of his or
[35:24] all of his character to himself he
[35:26] wanted to express it to someone and we
[35:28] know that he couldn't express it to the
[35:29] universe he couldn't express it to the
[35:31] animals he couldn't express it to just
[35:33] the planet Earth without human life but
[35:35] he but he but he put a part of himself
[35:37] upon the Earth his children that in
[35:39] order that he could express himself to
[35:42] his son son and daughter there in the
[35:43] Garden of Eden and now we understand
[35:45] that without the fall he could not
[35:47] express his full character as full
[35:49] nature they knew him as Creator they
[35:51] knew him as father they knew him as as
[35:53] you know as their God and all those
[35:55] different things but they never knew him
[35:57] as as uh Redeemer they never knew him as
[36:00] sacrifice they never knew him as a high
[36:03] priest because they didn't need a high
[36:04] priest with because they didn't have any
[36:05] sin they didn't need a redeemer because
[36:07] they were never lost you know that you
[36:09] know they never knew him as Advocate or
[36:11] guide because they were never lost they
[36:13] never needed comforting so there's many
[36:15] parts of his character that he could
[36:16] never express to Adam and Eve before the
[36:18] fall so really all the devil did was
[36:21] actually unleash the full character of
[36:23] God upon human beings amen by bringing
[36:26] sin into the world so really in a way in
[36:29] a strange way this may sound a bit
[36:30] strange you know
[36:31] he did us a favor
[36:34] by bringing sin into the world because
[36:36] you imagine it you could you know Adam
[36:38] Eve you know maybe this is just my
[36:39] little thoughts but you know if you
[36:41] never really need someone you can kind
[36:43] of take them for granted
[36:45] they've always been there
[36:47] you know yeah and literally they've
[36:49] always been there you know talk about
[36:50] just Adam and Eve in the garden yes he's
[36:51] wonderful we love his presence we love
[36:54] him with all our hearts he gives us such
[36:55] a wonderful place to live but but but
[36:57] there's never been a time where where
[36:59] he's really reached down
[37:01] and redeemed us and saved us and you
[37:03] kind of kind of take you know it's
[37:05] really when when crisis comes and
[37:07] someone steps to the Forefront of that
[37:09] crisis and somehow you know navigate
[37:12] through it and comes out the other side
[37:14] you know it's it's in crisis when you
[37:17] appreciate people's character for what
[37:19] they really are amen it's not when
[37:20] everything's just fine and bubbly and
[37:22] happy and things it's when trouble comes
[37:24] in that character can really come out
[37:26] and manifest itself and in those times
[37:29] of great trouble and that character
[37:30] comes out you really appreciate that
[37:32] person amen don't you think so I mean
[37:34] you really appreciate what they're
[37:35] really made of because it's it's in
[37:37] those times I mean what they're really
[37:39] made of comes out
[37:41] Hallelujah
[37:44] I'm not pausing for a um effect I'm just
[37:46] thirsty
[37:47] but you see
[37:49] and then and then so the Lord now
[37:52] because of what the enemy did
[37:55] he could become a redeemer he could
[37:58] become a savior he can become a Healer
[38:00] they were never sick before but then now
[38:02] they'd get sickness amen he would you
[38:05] know you know he'd be their Advocate
[38:06] their high priest he'd be their Defender
[38:08] their Shield their bucker I mean all
[38:10] these great attributes of God you know
[38:12] could now be manifested to Adam and Eve
[38:14] and now it's the same thing so it was in
[38:16] crisis when really God's heart came out
[38:18] yeah just like with the prodigal son
[38:20] when The Prodigal Son came home you know
[38:22] the heart of the father came forth when
[38:24] he was just happy to see his son come
[38:25] home you know the other son had a you
[38:28] know elder brother syndrome didn't
[38:29] understand what it was like to be lost
[38:31] and you know it didn't have the same
[38:32] heart as his father did that was really
[38:35] his real nature coming out it wasn't
[38:37] necessarily how well the farm was looked
[38:39] after and you know the you know the
[38:41] increase to the crops and the you know
[38:42] the you know the herds and all those
[38:44] things that wasn't really who he was
[38:46] that was part of him but that wasn't his
[38:47] core self who's with me tonight remember
[38:49] when is when his son came home
[38:52] Hallelujah his real heart came out so
[38:54] when a crisis came into his life of
[38:57] what's he going to do now sure he was
[38:58] longing day after day for his son that
[39:01] path he walked down to go into the world
[39:03] he has expected him to come back and he
[39:05] had times of prayer where the piece of
[39:07] God just came over me knew he was going
[39:09] to return but then finally it happened
[39:11] so really what's he going to do in that
[39:13] circumstancy yeah because he didn't just
[39:15] stand there and wait for the sun to come
[39:16] grovel his feet he ran to his son amen
[39:19] he ran to the one that was lost and now
[39:21] is found amen hallelujah so it was that
[39:23] time of great crisis really Express what
[39:25] was in the father and now it's the same
[39:27] thing with you and I times of great
[39:29] crisis is when God loves to show himself
[39:32] he loves to show his strength love to
[39:34] show his ability
[39:35] amen and we have we have the uh
[39:37] privilege of tapping into every
[39:40] attribute of God
[39:42] Hallelujah
[39:43] amen we have that
[39:47] praise God Amen you know you look at the
[39:49] Book of Ruth you know there's you know
[39:51] as we read in our opening scripture draw
[39:54] Knights of God and he'll draw a night to
[39:56] you now now there's an initial time of
[39:58] course where God finds you none of us
[40:00] were seeking him
[40:02] doesn't matter if you thought you were
[40:03] you weren't it was him finding you amen
[40:06] it was him going running after you amen
[40:08] and then he found you you gave your life
[40:10] to him but then there's a time now where
[40:12] you can draw night to him now and then
[40:14] so it's initiated it's initiated by us
[40:17] as opposed to him
[40:18] Hallelujah but the reason that all
[40:20] happens is because there's really a deep
[40:22] calling to the deep as brother Ram said
[40:24] like there has to be if there's a deeper
[40:26] if there's a hunger in here for
[40:27] something there's got to be something
[40:28] there to satisfy that hunger right so if
[40:32] there's a longing for salvation there's
[40:33] got to be a savior there before that
[40:35] longing for salvation can never be in a
[40:37] human soul amen so so the whole reason
[40:40] we draw an eye under Hermes because
[40:42] there's a deep calling to the Deep
[40:45] and I'm so thankful that God just
[40:47] doesn't leave us with an unsatisfied
[40:49] longing
[40:50] he never leaves us just with a
[40:53] you know I didn't really get that thing
[40:55] you know he satisfies every longing it
[40:58] may be in a long period of time but in
[41:00] his time he'll do it
[41:01] right amen yeah because remember the
[41:03] fruits of the spirit the patience there
[41:04] is patience with God
[41:06] we're going to have patience with him
[41:08] all right yeah God will answer in his
[41:09] time
[41:10] our schedule is not his schedule but I
[41:12] think 100 of the time that's a good
[41:14] thing as opposed to a bad thing
[41:17] right so so now we have the ability to
[41:20] draw night to God and he'll draw night
[41:22] to us now if you look in the Book of
[41:24] Ruth you know there's the initial time
[41:25] where where where Ruth you know follows
[41:28] follows Naomi you know they leave Moab
[41:30] we know Ruth is a moabite the law says
[41:33] she can't even come into the
[41:34] congregation of Israel but we know that
[41:36] you know if there's always a if there's
[41:38] a hunger to come in there's always a way
[41:39] in you know Grace overshadowed the law
[41:41] and Ruth came in amen just like you and
[41:43] I we had no Covenant with God God made
[41:46] no promise with us but Grace
[41:47] overshadowed that amen and he gave away
[41:49] for the Gentiles to come in aren't you
[41:51] glad for that Hallelujah and so now Ruth
[41:53] you know she you know she says to her
[41:55] mother-in-law because her mother-in-law
[41:57] says look you know there's no point
[41:58] following me to Israel you know are you
[42:01] going to wait for me to have another son
[42:02] I'm going to be you're going to be old
[42:03] he's going to be young how's this all
[42:05] going to work just you know just go back
[42:06] home and we know offer you know embrace
[42:09] your whipped and went home but Ruth said
[42:11] you know your God will be my God your
[42:13] people my people will you die I'll die
[42:15] and so she just made up her mind I'm
[42:17] following them I'm you know I'm
[42:18] following you wherever you go and so
[42:20] there was initial meeting when when Ruth
[42:22] would be in boaz's field and she just
[42:24] found herself in the right right place
[42:26] at the right time
[42:27] as uh you and I just happened uh it
[42:30] seems like coincidence that we just
[42:31] happened to come across the Lord and the
[42:33] right season of life right time and but
[42:36] God orchestrates everything you know and
[42:38] then so so there's that initial meeting
[42:39] and even Boaz says stay in this field
[42:41] don't go to another field you'll stay in
[42:43] my field but then now in order for
[42:45] Redemption to happen that that
[42:47] everything Naomi lost would be restored
[42:49] back to her we know that Ruth had to be
[42:52] married
[42:53] by Nick Kinsman remember there was a law
[42:55] in the in the Old Testament of the law
[42:57] of the Kinsmen Redeemer and that would
[42:59] be that if a family member sold
[43:01] themselves into slavery or went into
[43:03] whatever more that a near Kinsman could
[43:05] could go and redeem that person back to
[43:07] what they fell from but it had to be a
[43:10] person who was who who was who was blood
[43:12] relation they had to be able to do it
[43:15] and willing to do it and we know Boaz
[43:17] met all those qualifications amen he had
[43:20] to be near Kinsman he was he had to be
[43:23] able to do it and he was able to do it
[43:25] he'd be willing and he was willing same
[43:27] thing with our Lord Jesus Christ had to
[43:29] be related to you and I
[43:31] remember Adam was the son of God
[43:34] we are the sons and daughters of the
[43:36] most high God Amen and our new birth
[43:39] shows that it's not our first birth it's
[43:42] our new birth shows that we're her sons
[43:44] and daughters like it says in Galatians
[43:45] because you are Sons you receive the
[43:47] Holy Ghost you don't become a son or
[43:49] daughter of God when you receive the
[43:50] Holy Ghost you receive it because you
[43:52] are Hallelujah
[43:54] I like that don't you I mean so so you
[43:57] know so had to be relation he had to be
[43:59] able to do it and who could who could
[44:02] undo the curse
[44:03] only God as a man could do it remember
[44:06] by one man sin came into the world so
[44:09] man would ever come and undo it amen but
[44:11] we all know we're born in sin shaped
[44:14] iniquity come to World speaking lies
[44:15] doesn't matter you take every prophet of
[44:18] the Bible
[44:19] even Joseph there was one Mark against
[44:21] Joseph he told his father to tell a lie
[44:24] to Pharaoh you know before they win him
[44:25] because it was an Abomination to the
[44:27] Egyptians for anyone who was a Shepherd
[44:29] so Joseph they're coming to the throne
[44:31] room he just says to his dad's you don't
[44:33] don't say you're a Shepherd you know
[44:35] that was the one Mark against his whole
[44:37] life
[44:37] because every man has to fail
[44:39] so not one of us of all human record
[44:42] could actually redeem man back to God
[44:45] had to be one come from Glory One Day
[44:48] become a man to redeem us hallelujah
[44:51] amens who had to be related able to do
[44:54] it and willing to do it and we know that
[44:55] Joy set before our Lord was us redeemed
[44:57] that's why he went to Calvary The Joy
[44:59] set before him endured the cross
[45:01] despising the shame Hallelujah I trust I
[45:03] trust this is all right tonight amen so
[45:05] there came a point in in Ruth's
[45:08] experience where she had to she actually
[45:10] caused or she caused Boaz to become her
[45:14] Kinsmen Redeemer So within him was the
[45:16] attribute of Kinsmen Redeemer there's an
[45:18] attribute of that within him but Ruth
[45:20] actually caused it to be manifested
[45:24] amen tsunomi her father um her
[45:27] mother-in-law said unto her my daughter
[45:29] shall I not seek rest for thee that it
[45:31] may be well with thee and now is not
[45:33] boas of our Kindred with whose maidens
[45:35] thou was behold he went with Bali
[45:38] tonight in the threshing floor wash
[45:40] thyself therefore and anoint thee and
[45:42] put thy raiment upon thee and get thee
[45:44] down to the floor but make uh not
[45:46] thyself known unto the man until he hath
[45:49] done eating and drinking and it shall be
[45:51] when he lieth down thou shall Mark the
[45:53] place where he shall lie brother Brown
[45:54] says that's Calvary Mark where he lied
[45:56] lie down there and thou shall go and
[45:58] uncover his feet and lay thee down and
[46:00] he'll tell thee what thou shall do and
[46:02] she said unto all that thou saith unto
[46:04] me I will do we're going to be willing
[46:07] to do all that the word says not just
[46:09] part of it you know this was a kind of a
[46:11] sticky situation too
[46:13] put herself into
[46:15] but she humbled herself to the word of
[46:16] God and she said to her mother-in-law
[46:19] all that you say I'm going to do it not
[46:20] just part of it not the convenient part
[46:22] just all of it
[46:26] amen and then so now
[46:28] and then so Ruth goes down uncovers
[46:30] boaz's feet now this is just jumping
[46:32] down a bit
[46:33] and
[46:34] he says to
[46:37] I have it here right
[46:41] let's actually go to the Bible I don't
[46:42] have this in here properly but I'd like
[46:45] you to read this because I think it's
[46:46] pretty neat
[46:47] I know I've brought it up before but I
[46:49] just want to show you how we can we we
[46:51] have the ability by God's grace to
[46:54] actually cause us attributes to be
[46:55] manifested in our lives
[46:57] amen so we're going to Ruth we'll go to
[46:59] chapter three
[47:04] and then we go down to we go down to
[47:06] verse eight I don't have that here do I
[47:08] no I don't
[47:09] I thought I'd put that in
[47:11] okay so so Ruth 3 and verse 8 maybe you
[47:15] wanna you wanna put that up
[47:18] it says here now and it came to pass at
[47:21] midnight that the man was afraid and
[47:22] turned himself Behold a woman lay at his
[47:25] feet
[47:26] and he said who art thou and she
[47:28] answered I am Ruth I'm handmade spread
[47:31] therefore thy skirt overline handmade
[47:33] for thou art are near Kinsmen
[47:36] so now here she is she's gone down to
[47:38] the threshing floor and she's actually
[47:40] causing that attribute of kins and
[47:42] Redeemer to come out and be manifested
[47:45] out of Boaz to her amen because she's
[47:47] saying I'm a near Kinsman to you cover
[47:49] you with my skirt so cover my shame
[47:51] cover my old life cover where I came
[47:53] from cover all of my dark past and my
[47:56] widowhood and all those things in the
[47:58] idolatry in my past all those troubles
[48:00] cover who I was and make me someone new
[48:03] and the only one that that she could be
[48:05] made knew was that she would be United
[48:07] with Boaz I mean so because she went
[48:10] down to the threshing floor there and
[48:12] lay at his feet it actually caused him
[48:14] to step forth and manifest that
[48:17] attribute of Kinsmen Redeemer in her
[48:20] life now this is where I want to go do
[48:22] here also he said bring the vow that
[48:24] thou has upon thee and behold and hold
[48:26] it and when she held it he he measured
[48:29] six measures of barley and laid it on
[48:31] her and she went into the City and when
[48:33] she come to her mother-in-law she said
[48:36] daughter and she told all that the man
[48:39] had done to her and she said these six
[48:41] measures of Bali give gave he me for he
[48:44] said go not empty unto thy mother-in-law
[48:46] then said she sit still my daughter
[48:49] until thou know how the matter will fall
[48:52] for the man will not be in rest until he
[48:55] have finished the thing this day amen so
[48:58] this stirred up Boaz he's I've got to do
[49:00] something about this amen here she has
[49:03] come to me is my near Kinsman and I know
[49:05] the state of her family I know her State
[49:07] and it's within me to undo to give her
[49:10] her new identity to change to change her
[49:13] name to change her station from a from a
[49:15] moabite that's not even in the Covenant
[49:17] of God to bring her into the family of
[49:19] Israel by marriage Hallelujah and this
[49:21] is exactly what he did amen so so by her
[49:24] going to him caused him to be that
[49:27] attribute of kins and Redeemer to come
[49:29] out of manifest in his life Hallelujah
[49:32] to me this is an uh immensely powerful
[49:34] where where she has given six measures
[49:37] of Bali because we know that this is the
[49:40] this is the promise actually because the
[49:42] seventh the seventh uh is always a
[49:45] mystery which is Christ so now the seven
[49:47] seal is Christ himself we know there's
[49:49] six Cities of Refuge in the Old
[49:51] Testament the seventh is Christ Jesus
[49:53] would would turn the six water pots from
[49:56] water into wine and he's the seventh
[49:58] hallelujah amen so to me now Boaz is
[50:02] giving her a down payment saying say
[50:04] I'll give you this but you're going to
[50:05] get me soon Hallelujah I like that amen
[50:09] so to me that yo Hallelujah to me to me
[50:13] this just shows Yo God gives us a down
[50:14] payment but we're going to get it all
[50:17] amen hallelujah way to get the whole new
[50:20] Heavens A New Earth New Jerusalem
[50:23] eternity
[50:24] new bodies
[50:26] Hallelujah no more sin no more trouble
[50:28] no more sickness no more being pulled by
[50:31] spirits and all this kind of troubles
[50:33] going on and things and you know we're
[50:35] just going to have glory after Glory but
[50:38] we can have glory after Glory right now
[50:40] amen because we can we can tap into the
[50:43] attributes of God and pull the devil
[50:45] across his fires amen pull him into his
[50:48] own fire
[50:49] Hallelujah but you see now Ruth had to
[50:52] act and so upon the word and so we have
[50:54] to act upon the word amen when Moses
[50:57] Moses had to believe and this is
[50:58] speaking about the burning bush but
[51:00] Moses had to act upon it act upon what
[51:02] God's word said he wanted to see whether
[51:05] that was God or not he said while Moses
[51:07] act upon what I tell you now listen here
[51:09] tonight brother sister if you want to
[51:11] know who God is just act upon what he
[51:13] says here repent everyone you'd be
[51:15] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[51:16] you'll become a miracle that's his
[51:19] promise that's what he said act on his
[51:20] word and you shall receive the gift of
[51:22] the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto
[51:24] you unto your children oh that's just
[51:26] for the apostles and then there's a fire
[51:28] off as many as the Lord Our God shall
[51:30] call that's where the promise is too
[51:33] amen so so we have the privilege to act
[51:35] upon his word then he in faith then he
[51:38] fulfills that word now brother bear
[51:40] speaks about when drawing night to God
[51:42] is to think about how lovely he is think
[51:44] about how wonderful he is just fill your
[51:46] thoughts with how good he is and how
[51:48] great he is in your find his anointing
[51:50] start coming to you I mean the
[51:52] atmosphere around you will begin to
[51:54] change amen and that's what God wants to
[51:56] do he wants to he wants to meet with us
[51:58] amen that he can manifest his attributes
[52:01] in our life
[52:03] Hallelujah so it just just keep thinking
[52:06] on them now to me this is powerful this
[52:08] appearing of the Angel fright and the
[52:09] little little virgin that's speaking
[52:11] about Mary she had been taught that the
[52:13] days of Miracles was passed but she had
[52:15] been but she had seen something happen
[52:17] the angel told her said Hail Mary hell
[52:19] means to stop and he had a message for
[52:22] her when that when an angel comes it's
[52:24] got a message for you and the Holy
[52:26] Spirit God's angels here tonight with a
[52:28] message for every believer just keep him
[52:30] on your mind keep thinking about him how
[52:32] lovely he is how sweet he is of his
[52:35] promises if you're sick get this on your
[52:38] mind heals wounded for my transgressions
[52:40] he was bruised from my iniquity the
[52:42] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[52:44] and with the stripes I was healed keep
[52:46] your mind centered like that something
[52:48] will happen to you all of a sudden
[52:50] there'll be something drawn nigh to you
[52:52] and anointing will come on you and take
[52:54] you out of that chair you'll go draw
[52:56] night unto the Lord and he'll draw night
[52:58] unto you now when you begin to think our
[53:01] lovely it he is it really makes you
[53:03] relaxed hey who's at that experience
[53:05] you'd be all tensed and troubled then
[53:07] you think how great the Lord Jesus is
[53:08] and what he's done for you and what he's
[53:10] doing and his promises and how he's met
[53:13] God of his word he's never lied he's
[53:15] never failed he never backs up on a
[53:17] promise and you know he's there to keep
[53:18] you there to guide you there to calm you
[53:20] down and you know there to watch over
[53:22] you and your children and keep
[53:23] everything okay and you know and then
[53:25] you begin to think about that and it
[53:27] makes you relaxed now when you get into
[53:29] that relaxed State then your spirit is
[53:30] open and God can minister to you you
[53:32] know it's one of the greatest things
[53:34] brother says is just relax and submit
[53:37] yourself to the Holy Spirit and watch
[53:39] what he will do I mean so it's so
[53:42] important in this age full attention
[53:44] don't be tense
[53:46] just be relaxed now that doesn't mean be
[53:48] lacks relaxed and lacks at two very
[53:51] different things I'm not talking about
[53:52] being lacks now I'm talking about
[53:53] relaxing resting in his ability resting
[53:57] in his promises resting in his word it's
[53:59] like when Abraham was um Abraham was um
[54:03] Walking with God and God revealed
[54:04] himself as al-shaddai to him which means
[54:07] which means the almighty God the
[54:09] breasted one I mean like a mother
[54:11] breastfeeds her baby and Abraham has
[54:13] just been told by God just come and
[54:16] nurse off me strength at the promise we
[54:18] manifested so just rest if you see a
[54:20] little baby all squirming and kicking
[54:22] and fussing but as soon as it starts
[54:23] breastfeeding it relaxes it's happy
[54:26] right as a God is saying just nurse off
[54:28] me nurse off my promises and then draw
[54:31] strength from me I'm the strength Giver
[54:33] Hallelujah and then you'll see that yo
[54:35] all the tension will begin to leave no
[54:37] in spite of what's going on you'll be
[54:40] relaxed in the storm
[54:42] you know imagine imagine the Apostle
[54:44] Paul
[54:46] you know the first storm strikes the
[54:48] ship
[54:49] he said to them they shouldn't have left
[54:51] but they left anyway 14 days no no
[54:54] sunshine just storm continuously but
[54:58] then but then he began to pray because
[55:00] he could because because God made a
[55:02] covenant with him because remember the
[55:03] blood of Jesus Christ puts us on
[55:05] speaking terms with him right it puts us
[55:08] in that condition that's why I put that
[55:09] quote there by the front door I like to
[55:11] read that when I walk in I realize I'm
[55:13] in this condition Lord you put me in
[55:15] this condition Lord that you can speak
[55:17] to me and I can speak back to you and
[55:20] it's your blood that puts me in that
[55:21] condition it's not what I think I can do
[55:23] to achieve it it's what his achievement
[55:25] has done that matters amen so now the
[55:28] Apostle Paul could tap into the Lord and
[55:31] and and and tap into his attributes as
[55:33] guide and comforter and counselor and so
[55:37] he began to have a prayer meeting
[55:38] bobbing up and down in a storm but the
[55:40] angel Lord came to him and told him no
[55:43] one's going to perish the boat's gonna
[55:45] sink but everyone's Gonna Save their
[55:47] life you're going to Rome Paul what I
[55:49] told you in the beginning it's going to
[55:51] be fulfilled in your life doesn't matter
[55:53] what's going on you're gonna get there
[55:55] and friends we're not getting a boat to
[55:57] roam we're getting a Rapture to Glory so
[55:59] you're going to realize what God has
[56:00] told you is going to be fulfilled amen
[56:03] doesn't matter what storm comes in
[56:05] Trouble Comes whatever's going on the
[56:07] angel of the Lord has come in this
[56:09] generation to tell you you're my bride
[56:10] you're my queen I'm going to take you to
[56:12] Glory Hallelujah so we can have
[56:14] confidence that's why Paul when he got
[56:16] bitten by the ass bear he just shook it
[56:18] off in the fire he shook it off because
[56:20] subconsciously said no this thing can't
[56:22] harm me I'm going to Rome that was a
[56:24] deadly snake and everyone was watching
[56:25] and saying man he must have been a real
[56:27] sinner
[56:28] you know you know he somehow he survived
[56:30] the storm but now well
[56:32] Karma's got him I don't know what they
[56:34] would say in those days you know just
[56:36] bad cow kamish mama you know what you
[56:39] reap is what you sow yeah
[56:43] yeah one's free anyway you know but
[56:45] because he had because subconsciously it
[56:47] was revealed to me he's going through
[56:48] him that thing didn't bother him and
[56:49] then they thought he's some kind of a
[56:50] god it's amazing public opinion can
[56:53] swing in a moment you know and it's
[56:55] always a big pendulum thing you know I
[56:57] just read the book of Acts the other day
[56:58] and thinking you know Paul just goes
[57:00] preacher somewhere preach as the Lord
[57:02] Jesus people get saved the Holy Ghost
[57:04] fills people and then a riot breaks out
[57:07] these men are come to turn the world
[57:09] upside down you know they come to
[57:11] destroy all these things it's like man
[57:13] just calm down but that's what the devil
[57:14] does
[57:15] he takes it he takes not even a molehill
[57:18] and makes it a mountain of a real big
[57:19] deal
[57:20] same things happened today
[57:22] you know sensationalism all these things
[57:24] against the word of God but you see so
[57:27] if you just keep your mind on him see
[57:29] don't get don't get tense because of
[57:32] your tense you can miss the moving of
[57:33] the spirit of God you can miss God's
[57:35] blessing someone can be right next to
[57:37] you having a glorious time but because
[57:39] you're tense and stress you can miss the
[57:40] whole thing and I think that's why God
[57:42] told us pardon me about a month ago when
[57:44] we had that tongue's interpretation the
[57:46] last thing he said to us is I have not
[57:48] left and you know if you get fixated on
[57:51] this is wrong and this is going on and
[57:53] this tension and trouble in my family
[57:54] whatever more you've been going to think
[57:56] well I don't feel God God must have left
[57:57] that's why to me he said I have not left
[58:01] so it must never be tense just relax you
[58:04] say there's a lot of there's a lot of
[58:06] unknowns let God take care of those
[58:09] quantities let God deal with those
[58:10] things as brother Isaac preached a while
[58:12] ago Jesus has been in your future he's
[58:15] already seen it now it comes back to
[58:16] tell you how it's going to go he leads
[58:17] you into it I mean so I think we can
[58:19] just rest and we can rejoice
[58:22] amen and we can draw not to God
[58:26] you know Cornelius Cornelius spent time
[58:28] in prayer during night to God
[58:30] and it brought eternal life to his
[58:32] household and those who had church with
[58:35] him one man praying loving the Lord he
[58:37] says you know the angel comes and says
[58:39] your prayers and your arms have come up
[58:40] before God now go get Peter he'll teach
[58:43] you the words of eternal life he'll tell
[58:44] you and then he Peter came about a house
[58:46] meeting Peter came at a house meeting
[58:48] and God filled them as as he was
[58:50] preaching the word
[58:52] so I think it drills benefits eh just
[58:54] think on the Lord you say well what
[58:56] Good's that going to do well his his
[58:58] presence come down and change the whole
[59:00] picture
[59:01] I mean some bestsetting sin some trouble
[59:03] in your mind or something that you just
[59:04] can't overcome he just comes down and
[59:06] breaks that thing I think it's good
[59:07] remember because like brother bam says
[59:09] worry has helped no one
[59:12] if we could have every single human
[59:14] being upon the planet from Adam and Eve
[59:16] all the way down down now we ask them
[59:17] the same question did worrying help you
[59:19] at all
[59:21] no would be the answer
[59:23] whatever it's translated from doesn't
[59:24] matter that would be their answer but
[59:26] what about faith and then the Heroes of
[59:28] Faith would say absolutely I subdue
[59:30] kingdoms Queen survives of fire the
[59:32] mothers receive their dead back to life
[59:34] you know would say faith faith made us
[59:37] float above the Judgment Hallelujah
[59:39] Enoch would say faith took me in a
[59:41] Rapture amen yo they would say faith
[59:43] you're delivered me from many enemies
[59:45] Hallelujah so Faith work saying
[59:48] amen so that's why the Apostle Paul
[59:51] would say and be not drunk with wine
[59:52] wherein is in excess but be filled with
[59:55] the spirit
[59:56] Harley speaking to yourselves in Psalms
[59:58] and hymns and spiritual songs singing
[1:00:00] and making melody in your heart to the
[1:00:02] Lord giving thanks always for all things
[1:00:04] unto God in the father in the name of
[1:00:06] our Lord Jesus Christ submitting
[1:00:07] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:00:10] God that's why he says speak speaking to
[1:00:13] yourself in Psalms and hymns and
[1:00:14] spiritual songs
[1:00:15] Hallelujah you're drawing not to God
[1:00:17] it's not just filling your mind with
[1:00:19] something for the sake of it no it's
[1:00:21] actually that God will draw night to you
[1:00:23] who wants that who wants more of him
[1:00:25] it's like you just wake up in the
[1:00:27] morning it's like you're on Sunday night
[1:00:28] at Camp the whole day
[1:00:31] you may be working you may be getting
[1:00:33] shopping maybe looking after kids you
[1:00:34] may be clean but it's like you're but
[1:00:36] it's like you're at camp
[1:00:38] I don't think that's too far-fetched I
[1:00:40] don't think that's Pie in the Sky kind
[1:00:42] of a thought we can have that you know
[1:00:43] brother Brown says that a man can be
[1:00:45] drunk every day of his life till God
[1:00:46] takes him home
[1:00:48] drunk in the spirit that is
[1:00:50] others try the other one but doesn't
[1:00:51] really help them too much amen so now we
[1:00:55] can
[1:00:56] we can live in such a way
[1:00:59] that we can live closer to God and tap
[1:01:01] into his attributes now I put this up on
[1:01:04] the brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:01:05] repeat it if we if we'd stay close to
[1:01:07] God and loved him and just kept living
[1:01:09] for him and not trying to push things
[1:01:11] over but just live for God and live a
[1:01:13] pure holy life and live and pray every
[1:01:15] day keep yourself refreshed in his
[1:01:17] presence God will take care of the rest
[1:01:19] of it he will adopt the people into his
[1:01:21] own beloved body the church and when the
[1:01:23] Rapture comes you'll be found without a
[1:01:25] blemish because you're living in the
[1:01:26] presence of the king there's the secret
[1:01:28] friend do you want the secret that's the
[1:01:30] secret amen just love him and walk on
[1:01:33] and he'll take care of the rest of it
[1:01:36] that's a lot to take care of but I hate
[1:01:37] you do it all you know he's very good at
[1:01:39] it amen so this is this is so important
[1:01:42] who's uh praise the Lord I trust you're
[1:01:44] having a good time I'm enjoying myself
[1:01:46] amen so God God is God is able but you
[1:01:49] see now we can we have the privilege of
[1:01:51] tapping it takes Faith to tap into the
[1:01:54] attributes of God now you read through
[1:01:56] the gospels this yo Jesus does you know
[1:01:59] heal so many people now we know that it
[1:02:02] took faith in whatever the people did to
[1:02:04] get what they had need of out of God we
[1:02:06] know that it's very simple you know we
[1:02:08] know that the you know the woman with
[1:02:09] the blood as you touch him of His
[1:02:11] Garment she got healing the you know the
[1:02:14] um soldiers and the scribes and
[1:02:15] Pharisees beat him and hit him and
[1:02:17] things they got nothing but condemnation
[1:02:19] right because they did not believe oh
[1:02:21] well if you had Faith how could you
[1:02:22] strike our lord Jesus but you see they
[1:02:25] had unbelief driving their life but she
[1:02:27] had faith and so because she had a need
[1:02:29] now she could tap into that he is the he
[1:02:32] is the Divine healer right he is the
[1:02:34] source of all healing amen and she got
[1:02:36] what she had need of now Rahab Rahab
[1:02:40] only heard of the testimonies of what
[1:02:42] God did to Egypt
[1:02:44] but then when the spies went to her she
[1:02:47] began to repeat back to them what they
[1:02:50] had lived through so they had lived
[1:02:53] through all the plagues in Egypt they
[1:02:54] lived through the past overnight they
[1:02:55] lived through going the Red Sea they
[1:02:57] lived through you know fighting the um
[1:02:59] you know seahon and OG and the amorites
[1:03:01] and all those things so they lived
[1:03:03] through the testimony that she was
[1:03:05] telling them and then but the thing is
[1:03:07] because she believed that God was coming
[1:03:09] that way and God was going to take the
[1:03:11] city but she had faith that she could
[1:03:14] actually get Redemption
[1:03:17] salvation out of a God that just seems
[1:03:19] to be a god of wrath see real faith it
[1:03:22] doesn't matter what state we're in real
[1:03:24] Faith always asks there must be Mercy
[1:03:26] for me in that one
[1:03:28] Hallelujah because here she was she was
[1:03:31] she was in Jericho man that place is
[1:03:33] going to go down it's going to be
[1:03:34] destroyed everyone's going to be killed
[1:03:35] but then yeah and and she knew it was
[1:03:37] going to happen you know if you read
[1:03:39] that chapter it says that you know this
[1:03:40] you know the fear of all the the fear of
[1:03:43] them has become of the Israelites has
[1:03:45] has come upon all of our soldiers a lot
[1:03:47] of people that have no heart they have
[1:03:49] no morale anymore but yet he said but
[1:03:51] yet she says give me a true token
[1:03:55] yet you know since I've shown you
[1:03:57] kindness show kindness to my father's
[1:03:59] house and give me a true token
[1:04:01] Hallelujah this is the you know so to me
[1:04:03] this is astounding that a gentile that's
[1:04:05] living in a day of judgment could get
[1:04:07] Mercy kind of speaks of you and I we're
[1:04:10] living in a day of judgment we're living
[1:04:11] in pre-tribulation time I don't know if
[1:04:13] you've realized that amen but but as the
[1:04:15] tribulation is about to walk in amen
[1:04:17] Mercy's present amen Mercy steps in as
[1:04:20] well hallelujah amen as hell has opened
[1:04:22] itself upon the Earth amen all of
[1:04:24] Heavens turn loose also amen I'm so
[1:04:27] thankful for that amen that we can have
[1:04:28] a true token and we know that that true
[1:04:30] token is not just a Scarlet court amen
[1:04:33] it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:04:36] so we can tap into we can tap into the
[1:04:39] attributes of God if you need healing
[1:04:43] you can tap into it if you need
[1:04:45] Deliverance
[1:04:46] you can tap into it see everyone is
[1:04:49] going to experience an attribute of God
[1:04:50] one day
[1:04:51] they're going to be judged at the white
[1:04:53] Throne judgment so everyone's going to
[1:04:55] experience a part of God's character but
[1:04:57] we can experience all of his character
[1:04:59] what do you mean by judge well he
[1:05:02] received our judgment that down Calvary
[1:05:04] and a judge doesn't also find guilty he
[1:05:06] finds not guilty
[1:05:09] Hallelujah so remember a judge can
[1:05:12] condemn or pardon and we have been
[1:05:13] abundantly pardoned by the blood of
[1:05:15] Jesus Christ
[1:05:16] Hallelujah
[1:05:18] amen the Rahab um I'm the Harlot Rahab
[1:05:22] when she heard when she hid the spies
[1:05:23] she was a gentile and outcaster
[1:05:25] prostitute but she heard she didn't say
[1:05:27] you bring up Joshua here and let me take
[1:05:29] a look at him lets me see how tall and
[1:05:31] how handsome he is how it comes us here
[1:05:33] how he Grims himself how big is how big
[1:05:35] of his shoulders she didn't care what he
[1:05:38] looked like she said I've heard all what
[1:05:40] God did for you there you are I don't
[1:05:42] care what Joshua looks like I don't care
[1:05:44] whether he's got a PhD or an lld or
[1:05:46] hasn't got nothing I know God is with
[1:05:49] you I want protection Hallelujah so amen
[1:05:53] we can do the same thing
[1:05:55] we're not caught up with the personality
[1:05:57] of the messenger
[1:05:59] if I never go to Sabino Canyon in my
[1:06:01] life I don't mind if I never go to
[1:06:03] Jeffersonville in my life I don't mind I
[1:06:05] really don't mind because I'm caught up
[1:06:07] with the word hey those things would be
[1:06:09] cool I like to do the tourist thing I
[1:06:11] like to travel but you know that's not
[1:06:12] going to make me a believer
[1:06:14] I don't need to go to the I'd like to
[1:06:16] see the Tomb in Jerusalem but I don't
[1:06:17] need to go to believe that he rose
[1:06:19] because he's met me he found me amen
[1:06:21] he's alive today Hallelujah so
[1:06:25] amen so I don't need to know how big
[1:06:27] tall whatever I just want protection
[1:06:30] see she tapped into an attribute that
[1:06:32] none of those other people in Jericho
[1:06:33] tapped into and because she tapped into
[1:06:36] that attribute of Deliverance
[1:06:39] and salvation her family received the
[1:06:42] benefit of it
[1:06:43] Hallelujah
[1:06:45] amen
[1:06:47] dryas came to a point where everything
[1:06:49] failed around him
[1:06:51] his church couldn't help him the doctors
[1:06:54] couldn't help him
[1:06:55] but then he began to realize that there
[1:06:57] was a god of History
[1:06:59] who had raised from the dead I mean who
[1:07:01] could raise the dead and he went to find
[1:07:04] him
[1:07:05] Hallelujah he went to find him see
[1:07:07] something stood up in him that Jehovah
[1:07:10] that I preach about that Jehovah that I
[1:07:12] read about in the you know you know in
[1:07:14] the in the Torah that Jehovah that we
[1:07:17] say is still alive he's still a god of
[1:07:19] Miracles today I mean I can still meet
[1:07:21] him like Gideon did or Joshua daughter
[1:07:23] Moses did or you know Elijah or Elisha
[1:07:26] or you're the shooting white woman or
[1:07:27] anyone like that I can I can meet the
[1:07:29] same God and he realized that this God
[1:07:32] of history I mean there was a god of
[1:07:34] History who could raise the dead and he
[1:07:36] went out to find them and the Bible says
[1:07:39] that you know
[1:07:40] we must believe that he is
[1:07:44] for he that cometh the God must believe
[1:07:46] that he is and he is a rewarder of them
[1:07:48] that diligently seek Him amen so what do
[1:07:51] you have need of he rewards those that
[1:07:53] diligently seek Him amen not just a
[1:07:55] little bit of a
[1:07:57] you know
[1:07:58] casual thing on a Sunday but Larry Lord
[1:08:00] I need you I need an answer Lord You're
[1:08:03] My Guide you're my shepherd Lord
[1:08:06] what would you have me do Lord I need
[1:08:08] counsel Lord I need understanding amen
[1:08:11] and he's a rewarder of people that
[1:08:12] diligently seek Him who's had that
[1:08:14] experience amen whether you've needed
[1:08:16] you've needed wisdom you've needed
[1:08:18] something you Lord yeah I've come to a
[1:08:20] Crossroads in my life the world's
[1:08:22] pulling me this way you're pulling me
[1:08:24] this way or you know it seems right to
[1:08:25] go with the crowd or what should I do
[1:08:27] and then he comes on the scene because
[1:08:29] you're seeking him
[1:08:30] Hallelujah I'm so glad that our God is a
[1:08:33] rewarder of them to diligently seek him
[1:08:35] Hallelujah
[1:08:37] amen and you see now like Rahab
[1:08:39] Rahab she wanted protection or even
[1:08:42] Jarius we'll just go back to him amen he
[1:08:44] found that God of History because that
[1:08:46] God of history is walking in flesh in
[1:08:48] his day Hallelujah and even when he
[1:08:50] heard when he found Jesus there and and
[1:08:53] and and he hadn't received the news yet
[1:08:54] that his daughter was dead he thought
[1:08:57] this is going to be all right Hallelujah
[1:08:59] but in the messenger Council room's
[1:09:01] household distressed and said don't
[1:09:03] trouble the master she's gone but he
[1:09:05] says no no it's okay isn't it good when
[1:09:07] you're facing even worse than use and
[1:09:10] there's still small voices it's gonna be
[1:09:12] okay
[1:09:13] I've got this Hallelujah and then he
[1:09:16] brought not just healing into his house
[1:09:18] but Resurrection
[1:09:20] amen so it shows what we what we place
[1:09:22] in God's hand
[1:09:24] he multiplies it amen heat that makes it
[1:09:27] far greater than than what we think will
[1:09:29] happen like Rahab she didn't just get
[1:09:31] salvation for herself but for her whole
[1:09:33] household it wasn't just for her it was
[1:09:36] for her whole house although it was
[1:09:37] probably greater than she imagined amen
[1:09:39] Noah God him and him and his house saved
[1:09:41] Hallelujah
[1:09:43] amen so yeah it's it's what we put in
[1:09:45] his hands you know brother bear likes to
[1:09:48] dramatize and I like to dramatize too he
[1:09:49] said that that boy that had that lunch
[1:09:52] you know Jesus had been preaching you
[1:09:54] know I've been it's you know it was you
[1:09:55] know they didn't have food to feed the
[1:09:57] multitudes and there's a little boy that
[1:09:59] you know was walking to school one day
[1:10:01] and he heard a noise and it was the
[1:10:03] crowd Jesus ministering to the crowd he
[1:10:05] just decided I'm gonna go see what's
[1:10:06] going on
[1:10:07] you know so he gets about school he said
[1:10:09] well I'm gonna get a whooping anyway I'm
[1:10:10] late so hey I'm just gonna you know
[1:10:12] what's the point I must make it count or
[1:10:13] something and you know and then he finds
[1:10:15] himself
[1:10:16] he's carrying a school lunch
[1:10:19] and then he finds himself in front of
[1:10:21] one of the disciples because because no
[1:10:22] doubt that disciples like you know
[1:10:24] they're getting worried we need to feed
[1:10:25] the people what are we going to do
[1:10:27] and then the boy just says look I've got
[1:10:29] my lunch
[1:10:30] and then Jesus receives that
[1:10:33] and then he feeds thousands of people
[1:10:36] Hallelujah so whatever you put in God's
[1:10:38] hands he multiplies above more than you
[1:10:40] even realize what it can do you know
[1:10:42] maybe the boy would have thought well I
[1:10:44] can I can share a bit with her maybe a
[1:10:45] few a few people it didn't just feed a
[1:10:47] few people it fit a whole bunch of
[1:10:49] people it fed everyone and there were
[1:10:51] leftovers you know Jesus believes in
[1:10:54] leftovers
[1:10:55] Hallelujah
[1:10:57] amen sometimes people get so stressed
[1:10:59] about food and things Jesus believes in
[1:11:01] leftovers he made leftovers
[1:11:03] praise God I like that maybe I just like
[1:11:05] food too much but hey you know we
[1:11:07] shouldn't be so worried about these
[1:11:09] things
[1:11:10] is that okay
[1:11:11] amen see now that little boy that little
[1:11:14] lunch he had wasn't very much in his
[1:11:16] hands but when he let what he had going
[1:11:18] to Jesus hands it fed thousands and
[1:11:21] maybe what little faith you say well I
[1:11:22] wish I had great faith but what little
[1:11:24] faith you got you've got faith enough to
[1:11:26] come to church who's got that faith I
[1:11:28] mean you're all here and those streaming
[1:11:30] right amen then if you've got that much
[1:11:33] Faith why don't you just give it over
[1:11:34] into the hands of Jesus and it'll feed
[1:11:37] thousands if you there's not much in
[1:11:39] your hands but once in his hands then
[1:11:42] it'll do Miracles if you let that Faith
[1:11:45] get in his hands
[1:11:47] Hallelujah it'll do more than you
[1:11:49] realize
[1:11:50] I'm so limited but put it in his well
[1:11:52] you think you're living to put it in his
[1:11:53] hands the become unlimited what God can
[1:11:57] do
[1:11:58] Hallelujah amen
[1:12:02] praise the Lord I'm just gonna I mean
[1:12:04] you can take this whole thought through
[1:12:06] the whole Bible
[1:12:07] the believer tapped into attributes of
[1:12:09] God that others didn't you know like
[1:12:12] Jesus would say in Luke chapter four
[1:12:14] maybe I'll just close with this here
[1:12:16] um this has got to Luke chapter four and
[1:12:18] then and then we'll have the musicians
[1:12:25] and this is this is here in
[1:12:28] uh Luke 4
[1:12:30] and then verse 24 and he said Phil I say
[1:12:33] unto you no Prophet is accepted in his
[1:12:35] own country but I tell you the truth
[1:12:37] many widows are in Israel in the days of
[1:12:39] Elias when the heaven was shut up three
[1:12:41] years and six months that Great Famine
[1:12:43] was throughout all the land but unto
[1:12:46] none of them was a liar sent saved unto
[1:12:48] sarapa a city of sidon unto a woman that
[1:12:52] was a widow you know brother Graham says
[1:12:54] that that Widow was the same caliber as
[1:12:56] the prophet that's why the prophet went
[1:12:58] to her amen and when the word comes your
[1:13:01] way God's saying you're the same caliber
[1:13:03] as me not in your Humanity now but that
[1:13:05] seed on the inside of the inside of you
[1:13:07] many times we think we're worthless but
[1:13:09] God says you're worth more than ten
[1:13:10] thousand worlds you know they found
[1:13:12] asteroids out there in the cosmos that
[1:13:14] you know it's full of platinum or
[1:13:16] whatever precious metals and they want
[1:13:17] to try and bring it to the Earth
[1:13:19] and it's and its value is so vast it'll
[1:13:22] just break the whole Market of things
[1:13:24] just just just one asteroid
[1:13:26] it's not even a world it's just an
[1:13:28] asteroid we're worth far more than those
[1:13:30] things amen but unto and and many lepers
[1:13:33] were in Israel in the time of so um
[1:13:35] Elisha the prophet and none of them was
[1:13:38] cleansed say saving Naaman the Syrian
[1:13:41] see these ones had the ability to tap
[1:13:44] into God's provision and healing power
[1:13:47] remember Naaman Naaman was real upset
[1:13:50] when he was told to dip in the Jordan
[1:13:52] but remember it's a deep calling to the
[1:13:54] Deep
[1:13:54] and God wants to give it to you more
[1:13:56] than you want to receive it
[1:13:58] so he had to Humble himself and he got
[1:14:01] his healing
[1:14:03] Hallelujah but God's put an ability it's
[1:14:05] not in your mind how smart you are what
[1:14:07] you think you always put a faith in you
[1:14:10] that you can tap into his attributes
[1:14:12] just like what who saved here
[1:14:16] he gave you Faith to tap into attribute
[1:14:18] of Savior
[1:14:19] amen who's received the Holy Ghost you
[1:14:22] know who's experiencing Redemption
[1:14:25] you're tapping into attributes that
[1:14:26] other people haven't been able to tap
[1:14:29] into necessarily it
[1:14:31] healer a god you go through all of us
[1:14:34] you know you realize he's your father
[1:14:35] why is that because he revealed that
[1:14:37] attribute to you I am your father and we
[1:14:40] know he's not a father like an Earthly
[1:14:41] father who's limited and can fail and
[1:14:43] has a you know
[1:14:44] but he's a true father anyway that's a
[1:14:46] whole nother subject but let's have the
[1:14:48] musicians tonight but you're glad he's
[1:14:50] given you a faith when you have need you
[1:14:52] can draw on God you can draw night to
[1:14:54] him he draws nice to you amen that you
[1:14:56] can you can tap into his character and
