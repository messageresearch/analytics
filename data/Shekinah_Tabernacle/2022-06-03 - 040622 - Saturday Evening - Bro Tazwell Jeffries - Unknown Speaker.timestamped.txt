[0:08] other time i've pulled through this one
[0:10] i'll do the same don't worry about it we
[0:12] can just trust
[0:14] the trials don't get any easier
[0:16] but our faith gets stronger
[0:19] that's the difference
[0:20] they actually get slightly harder to
[0:22] increase our faith but but our faith
[0:25] always meets the the need
[0:28] and god won't test us above what we're
[0:30] able
[0:31] because he's a faithful god

[3:02] have or
[3:04] even when someone fell on elijah's bones
[3:06] they they raised back to life the lord

[39:32] i sought the truth in
[39:36] men gave their answers
[39:40] but something just
[39:42] wasn't right
[39:47] i couldn't explain it
[39:50] they sounded like strangers
[39:54] it just didn't meet my thirst inside
[40:00] and then i heard an eagles cry
[40:05] i heard a word speak to my heart
[40:08] it said shout you don't belong down
[40:12] there
[40:12] come up from where you are
[40:16] then i heard an eagles cry
[40:20] it told me i could fly
[40:23] and i believed the word that i had heard
[40:27] and sought up to the sky
[40:30] when i heard an eagles cry
[40:39] how i was thirsting
[40:43] and i was calling
[40:47] from somewhere deep
[40:50] inside
[40:55] the deep unveiled
[40:58] through your seventh angel
[41:02] the voice of the bridegroom calling to
[41:05] his bride
[41:08] and then i heard an eagles cry
[41:12] i heard a word speak to my heart
[41:16] it said shout you don't belong down
[41:20] there
[41:20] come up from where you are
[41:24] then i heard an eagles cry
[41:28] it told me i could fly
[41:31] and i believe the word that i had heard
[41:36] and sought up to the sky
[41:39] when i heard an eagles cry
[41:44] now i'm flying
[41:48] now i am flying above all the confusion
[41:54] below
[41:55] everything's clear and now i'm flying
[41:59] above the storm
[42:02] in every situation
[42:06] whatever comes my way i
[42:10] i have a peace with jesus flying above
[42:14] the storm
[42:17] there is a joy within me
[42:21] now that i'm soaring freely
[42:25] your word has set me free i'm flying
[42:28] above the stone
[42:32] and i won't be going back down my soul
[42:37] is glory bound
[42:39] i'm built to dwell in the heavenly
[42:45] for eternity
[42:49] then i heard an eagles cry
[42:53] i heard a word speak to my heart
[42:57] said child you don't belong down there
[43:01] come up from where you are
[43:04] then i heard an eagles cry
[43:08] and told me i could fly
[43:13] [Music]
[43:21] cry
[43:26] hallelujah
[43:28] amen that's why we gathered isn't it
[43:31] we've heard the we've heard the voice
[43:32] behind the voice
[43:34] we've heard papa eagle call us
[43:37] and you know the reason why the eagle
[43:38] stirs the nest and gets the youngins
[43:40] flying
[43:41] is because mama eagle wants baby eagles
[43:44] to know that they can do what she can do
[43:47] i mean it's the same life that's in mama
[43:49] as in baby but babies need to realize
[43:51] that life is in them so they can soar
[43:53] and the lord said the works that i do
[43:55] you shall do also and grant these that
[43:57] shall you do because i go to my father
[43:59] so he wants you to realize you're built
[44:00] of the same material
[44:02] hallelujah that that he's made of the
[44:04] word itself
[44:06] hallelujah amen well we're in for
[44:08] another treat
[44:09] you know i i love this morning
[44:12] you know
[44:14] you know the um amen i love this morning
[44:18] hallelujah
[44:19] you know so i like it you know when the
[44:21] when the third seal opened the black
[44:23] horse rider rides forth there's a voice
[44:24] from the midst of the throne saying
[44:26] touch not the oil and the wine
[44:28] so don't touch the revelation and the
[44:30] stimulation caused by the revelation so
[44:32] the devil can't hold it back
[44:35] but the devil will try and make you hold
[44:37] it back
[44:38] that's why we're free to rejoice you
[44:39] know if we just think where we came from
[44:42] where i came from
[44:44] how can you not shout and rejoice and
[44:46] when the word comes open to you and like
[44:48] john saw john you see yourself beyond
[44:50] the curtain of time already you see your
[44:52] theophany there your glorified body
[44:54] there how can you not shout

[45:39] if the first service was like it was
[45:42] what's this one going to be
[45:45] because you know this is god's doing
[45:47] he wants to pour himself into you more
[45:49] than you want to receive him
[45:51] and brother bam said the dynamics of
[45:53] this end time bride will be a refilling

[54:07] that's when the regis is actually the
[54:09] the second part of the verse but it says
[54:12] so it speaks of a couple of things but
[54:14] it says here what
[54:16] shall we then say
[54:19] to these things
[54:21] so this morning we heard some things
[54:24] being preached to us

[54:31] precious promises from the world
[54:34] tomorrow we're going to hear more
[54:37] tomorrow morning tomorrow night
[54:40] the verse says here what shall we then

[54:59] whatever and oh father we ask you to
[55:02] speak
[55:03] lord
[55:04] there's a song that we sing that says
[55:07] word of god speak
[55:10] that's what we want father
[55:12] in jesus name we pray
[55:14] amen and amen god bless you
[55:17] amen you may be seated tonight in the
[55:20] presence of god
[55:23] eminence i really appreciated my
[55:25] brother-in-law this morning
[55:27] man was just awesome and
[55:29] yeah that's just the way i know him
[55:31] [Laughter]
[55:33] he's actually my uh my my mentor
[55:38] i was i remember years years ago
[55:41] i was i was i still am but i was very
[55:44] very shy and
[55:46] very much in the background very much in
[55:48] the you know not wanting to be seen
[55:51] and somehow the lord inspired him to see
[55:55] a gift on this young taz
[55:57] and don't forget the first time he asked
[55:59] me to
[56:00] lead the song service
[56:02] in the youth meeting
[56:04] and i was so stressed out but i prepared
[56:06] that whole week
[56:07] [Laughter]
[56:10] to lead the song service
[56:12] and i'm just so grateful to god you know
[56:14] that the lord allowed him just to
[56:17] recognize
[56:19] something
[56:20] and then you know like he said you know
[56:22] once god came and he he brings a change
[56:24] in your life
[56:26] you can't
[56:27] see that the key is easy brings a change
[56:30] in your life
[56:32] so the things i used to do or the way i
[56:35] was you can't be like that
[56:37] you know once once you've seen what is
[56:39] done in your life
[56:41] once he's revealed this to you you can
[56:43] never
[56:44] ever be the same again
[56:48] so i'm really grateful to the lord just
[56:50] for the
[56:51] various people he's allowed to
[56:54] come my way
[56:57] so i've got i've got a title for tonight
[57:03] and uh you know as freddie was
[57:05] ministering this morning he hit on a
[57:06] couple of things and which i said they
[57:09] heard you pulling off my notes but we're
[57:11] just going to see and there's there's
[57:13] something that was key that ferdi said
[57:15] which i felt
[57:17] i i believe it was the it's it's it's
[57:21] god wanting to get our attention on
[57:23] something specific this weekend
[57:26] but i want to just give you my title
[57:28] and then i've got an a sort of an
[57:30] inspirational the subject behind it but
[57:32] the title says that
[57:34] god's
[57:35] purpose
[57:36] for your life
[57:39] will never be defeated
[57:43] [Music]
[57:44] i i want you to to grab that now i'm
[57:48] saying god's purpose for your life
[57:52] will never be defeated
[57:55] but i want you to take that
[57:57] turn it back on yourself and say god's
[58:01] purpose for my life
[58:06] can never be defeated
[58:10] because he's got a purpose
[58:13] and he's got a plan
[58:16] for each one of you
[58:18] and me
[58:19] as i'm standing here so that's the title
[58:22] for tonight and then i've got a little
[58:25] subject and brother any on tuesday night
[58:28] your you said something which just
[58:30] activated something within me
[58:32] and my my my subject for tonight is that
[58:36] you
[58:38] you are moving
[58:40] from the position of a prisoner
[58:44] into a position of power
[58:48] so if i may use a simple term i might
[58:51] say you are moving from prison
[58:55] into power
[59:04] now i don't know what you're going
[59:06] through
[59:08] and you know that
[59:09] and i know that
[59:11] but god knows
[59:14] so he knows why he tells certain people
[59:17] to say certain things
[59:20] because there might be somebody sitting
[59:22] here
[59:23] that maybe doesn't recognize or know
[59:26] that i am an eagle
[59:29] but they are
[59:30] eagles and they might be sitting here
[59:34] in this meeting
[59:36] but acting like chickens
[59:39] but they are eagles
[59:42] their makeup is that of an eagle
[59:46] and maybe tonight today the service
[59:51] may god come down to that person's seats
[59:57] and make them realize that i am an eagle
[1:00:02] i'm not a chicken
[1:00:04] i am walking what was the words that
[1:00:06] further used i'm gonna write i wrote it
[1:00:08] down here further used we need to switch
[1:00:11] position
[1:00:15] and i think that is so key
[1:00:19] i think that is what god wants to tell
[1:00:23] you and me over this weekend
[1:00:26] let's switch
[1:00:28] position
[1:00:31] wherever you are right now
[1:00:34] when you came to this meeting
[1:00:37] take it from here
[1:00:39] and move higher
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:49] i like that
[1:00:51] and he didn't know what i was gonna
[1:00:52] write in my notes
[1:00:54] but earlier this week the lord said from
[1:00:57] prison
[1:00:58] to power
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:03] shall switch positions
[1:01:05] allow god
[1:01:08] allow the word
[1:01:11] to infiltrate your heart today
[1:01:16] allow it
[1:01:18] please
[1:01:20] i beg you especially the young people
[1:01:23] i beg you
[1:01:26] allow god
[1:01:29] as he speaks
[1:01:32] many of you know my testimony
[1:01:35] i came into a meeting i sat down
[1:01:37] thinking i'm just a cool
[1:01:39] smooth young person
[1:01:41] not realizing it i
[1:01:44] was an eagle
[1:01:46] i was always an eagle
[1:01:49] but i acted like a chicken i clocked
[1:01:52] like a chicken
[1:01:54] or i tried to
[1:01:57] but i just couldn't come out right
[1:02:00] until one day
[1:02:03] the word of god by the emerson
[1:02:06] came my way
[1:02:10] it changed my life
[1:02:14] it made me who i am today
[1:02:21] and because i know what it does
[1:02:25] and because i know
[1:02:27] where it's taken me from
[1:02:31] and because i know what is helping me to
[1:02:34] do
[1:02:36] i would
[1:02:37] i would if i could push it into everyone
[1:02:40] especially the young people
[1:02:42] i would
[1:02:47] so i want to encourage
[1:02:50] expert this is not a young people
[1:02:52] service
[1:02:53] but i'm so bad
[1:02:56] i'm so burdened for the young
[1:03:02] don't let my crying or my emotion
[1:03:04] try to make you emotional
[1:03:09] i mean it's normal as human beings
[1:03:12] but don't let emotion
[1:03:15] control
[1:03:16] decisions
[1:03:17] that needs to be made
[1:03:21] allow the word
[1:03:24] allow
[1:03:25] the word
[1:03:32] brother brennan in the message i know
[1:03:34] my redeemer liveth he says
[1:03:37] god's purpose
[1:03:39] can
[1:03:40] never
[1:03:41] be
[1:03:42] defeated
[1:03:44] and i want i want to carry that
[1:03:47] all over this meeting tonight
[1:03:49] i want you to know
[1:03:51] and i want you to receive
[1:03:54] that god's
[1:03:55] purpose for your life
[1:03:59] will not be defeated
[1:04:02] can never well not
[1:04:07] [Applause]
[1:04:13] you see
[1:04:15] it's important
[1:04:16] that you receive the words
[1:04:20] you've got to
[1:04:21] receive the word
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:26] so he says there's nothing can defeat it
[1:04:30] so how happy
[1:04:32] what we to be today
[1:04:34] resting upon that beautiful revelation
[1:04:37] of the word
[1:04:39] of the living god
[1:04:40] that there is neither things present
[1:04:43] nor things that can come
[1:04:46] he says there's no sickness
[1:04:49] no sorrow
[1:04:51] no death
[1:04:53] no perils
[1:04:54] he says nothing
[1:04:56] can separate us
[1:04:58] from the purpose
[1:05:00] of the loving god
[1:05:02] now we know there's a scripture that
[1:05:04] says nothing can separate us from the
[1:05:08] love of god
[1:05:09] and his love
[1:05:11] is projecting
[1:05:13] to you
[1:05:14] and to me
[1:05:16] so that his purpose
[1:05:18] for you
[1:05:25] what god has imagined in his mind
[1:05:29] what god
[1:05:30] has purposed
[1:05:32] in his heart
[1:05:33] to bring to pass he says there's no
[1:05:36] demon
[1:05:38] there's no power
[1:05:40] there is nothing
[1:05:42] that can ever separate god's
[1:05:45] great
[1:05:46] immortal
[1:05:47] eternal plan
[1:05:50] he says it must
[1:05:52] be
[1:05:53] as god has said
[1:05:58] if you want to know what god has said
[1:06:01] about
[1:06:02] you i encourage you
[1:06:06] to find it
[1:06:08] in his precious word
[1:06:12] as you feed on the word
[1:06:15] as you listen to the messenger as you
[1:06:18] think on those tapes
[1:06:20] it tells you
[1:06:22] who you are
[1:06:28] the purpose of god for you starts
[1:06:31] unfolding
[1:06:33] and you start to understand
[1:06:39] and then rather when you use that term
[1:06:42] it stimulates you
[1:06:45] stimulation
[1:06:46] of revelation
[1:06:49] because you're seeing yourself
[1:06:52] in the word
[1:06:54] and as you see in yourself
[1:06:57] mind stimulates you
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:12] it makes you want to shout
[1:07:13] it makes you want to scream
[1:07:15] and say thank you jesus
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:22] thank you for your grace
[1:07:29] oh
[1:07:31] praise the lord
[1:07:34] nobody would come and
[1:07:37] in the message i know my redeemer liveth
[1:07:40] and you just touch on that word
[1:07:43] purpose
[1:07:46] and you talk about a home
[1:07:48] that you live in
[1:07:50] he says that home is not just
[1:07:53] or the house is not just a building that
[1:07:55] was put together just because
[1:07:58] there's a purpose
[1:08:00] for that house
[1:08:02] that you're living in
[1:08:05] that house so that home
[1:08:07] is to house you
[1:08:09] its purpose
[1:08:11] is to keep you warm
[1:08:13] sometimes even maybe to keep you but
[1:08:15] safe from the elements outside
[1:08:19] so there's a purpose
[1:08:21] for that house
[1:08:24] you tell us about you'll use the word
[1:08:26] automobile i'll use the word car
[1:08:29] he'll tell us that many of us came here
[1:08:31] maybe without vehicles
[1:08:34] that vehicle when it was created
[1:08:37] it wasn't just created to be there and
[1:08:40] to look nice
[1:08:41] that vehicle was created to bring you
[1:08:44] yeah
[1:08:46] and this is a memorial time this is a an
[1:08:49] awesome very important time
[1:08:52] this year tonight over this weekend
[1:08:55] i can imagine how god is looking and
[1:08:58] he's smiling
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:01] and he's saying my ten years
[1:09:04] being ten years went so quick
[1:09:07] but look what i've accomplished
[1:09:10] in you
[1:09:12] know
[1:09:17] not only chicago
[1:09:24] and he's smiling
[1:09:26] and he's saying there's my daughter
[1:09:29] there's my son
[1:09:31] maybe they they sting here and they they
[1:09:34] they don't really know
[1:09:36] that they're my daughter
[1:09:38] or my son maybe that realization hasn't
[1:09:40] hit them yet
[1:09:42] but i'm going to because i know what
[1:09:45] needs to be said
[1:09:47] and i'm going to allow
[1:09:49] someone
[1:09:51] to say something
[1:09:53] that will activate
[1:09:55] something within them
[1:09:57] that will make them realize hey
[1:10:01] i'm a son of god
[1:10:04] i'm a daughter of god
[1:10:07] not a chicken in the barnyard
[1:10:09] priming eagle
[1:10:12] the bran would say
[1:10:14] you talk about a church building and
[1:10:16] i'll talk about this building here
[1:10:19] this building
[1:10:20] was built
[1:10:22] for a purpose
[1:10:24] maybe the people when they built it
[1:10:26] thought they're gonna have it for
[1:10:28] conferences
[1:10:29] thought they're going to have it for
[1:10:30] business meetings and various kind of
[1:10:33] business events
[1:10:35] but i believe god had a purpose
[1:10:38] for this building
[1:10:41] to be created
[1:10:43] so when the designers of the architect
[1:10:46] went and they architected this this
[1:10:48] building
[1:10:49] they didn't have in mind
[1:10:52] that there's going to be royalty
[1:10:55] shooting
[1:10:57] in this place
[1:11:00] because that is who
[1:11:02] you are
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:05] you are royalty
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:08] you are the apple
[1:11:11] of his eye
[1:11:15] you special
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:23] and i'm not just giving you good words
[1:11:26] that's not just good words
[1:11:29] go and read the word
[1:11:33] i know i'm coming back i this for me is
[1:11:35] so important
[1:11:38] read the word
[1:11:41] and you will realize
[1:11:43] i'm royalty
[1:11:46] thus balding
[1:11:48] was bought for a purpose
[1:11:51] to house
[1:11:54] he's purchased
[1:11:58] to house
[1:11:59] royalty
[1:12:02] so that
[1:12:04] so that god
[1:12:06] could sweep into this place
[1:12:10] and take captive
[1:12:13] and change lives
[1:12:17] and help you
[1:12:19] to switch
[1:12:33] is calling you come
[1:12:37] up
[1:12:38] higher
[1:12:42] david i'm sorry i'm going to use you as
[1:12:43] an example
[1:12:46] we pointed to david very pointed to
[1:12:48] david isaac
[1:12:49] david isaac
[1:12:51] it's favoritely sorry
[1:12:52] very pointed to david lee
[1:12:55] and i sat there
[1:12:56] and i had this inspiration in my heart
[1:12:59] and i said this building
[1:13:01] was built for a purpose so that isaac
[1:13:05] lee
[1:13:06] could stand there
[1:13:07] and say preach it brother
[1:13:10] preach it
[1:13:11] [Applause]
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:13] and that god could use the minister
[1:13:16] to show and point to a trophy
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:20] of his grace
[1:13:22] [Applause]
[1:13:26] this year is a trophy
[1:13:29] to the grace of god
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:41] a trophy
[1:13:46] i'm looking at trophies
[1:13:48] of his grace
[1:13:50] all of you
[1:13:52] you are trophies
[1:13:55] hallelujah
[1:13:59] [Applause]
[1:14:02] [Music]
[1:14:08] god did not make you and i
[1:14:10] just to see we could do it
[1:14:14] made us
[1:14:15] for a purpose
[1:14:21] there is a purpose for all of us being
[1:14:23] here
[1:14:25] he
[1:14:26] says for a specific
[1:14:30] purpose
[1:14:32] now you know as we go through the word
[1:14:33] we can
[1:14:35] we can realize and read and understand
[1:14:38] you know why
[1:14:39] and where
[1:14:40] god is leading us in what he wants us to
[1:14:43] do and you know he's called us for for
[1:14:46] bigger things than whatever we're doing
[1:14:48] out there
[1:14:52] but you know i was i was thinking about
[1:14:53] this and i i mentioned something similar
[1:14:55] when we spoke in fielding but
[1:14:58] i the lord just
[1:14:59] impressed on my heart say it again
[1:15:02] you know many times we come to these
[1:15:04] gatherings
[1:15:06] and we think it's just about the
[1:15:08] minister coming with the word
[1:15:12] preaching the word
[1:15:14] so that my son and that my daughter can
[1:15:17] be delivered
[1:15:19] many times you want to put it on the
[1:15:21] minister
[1:15:23] now the word is of vital importance
[1:15:26] but i believe with all of my heart
[1:15:30] that god has placed you
[1:15:33] as you sitting here
[1:15:36] he's gifted each one many of us
[1:15:39] what so many gifts
[1:15:42] so it's not only the minister
[1:15:46] but it's you
[1:15:48] it's you
[1:15:49] it's you
[1:15:51] you can bring about a change
[1:16:00] just be sensitive
[1:16:02] to the moving
[1:16:04] of the
[1:16:09] there's gifts of discernment
[1:16:13] there's gifts of prophecy
[1:16:17] you know i stand here today
[1:16:23] i'll throw down here god's purpose
[1:16:26] for your life
[1:16:27] will never be defeated
[1:16:30] many many many years ago
[1:16:32] back in south africa
[1:16:34] a prophecy went out
[1:16:37] over tears
[1:16:39] that was just hiding in the corner
[1:16:41] very much scared
[1:16:43] and shy
[1:16:45] ashamed of himself sometimes
[1:16:48] a prophecy went out
[1:16:50] that said
[1:16:52] you're moving overseas you leaving south
[1:16:54] africa
[1:16:55] i had no plans no intentions nothing
[1:16:58] of leaving the country
[1:17:00] prophecy went out
[1:17:03] you're leaving the country
[1:17:04] you're going overseas
[1:17:06] and god is going to use you
[1:17:09] i heard that
[1:17:11] and i thought
[1:17:12] me
[1:17:14] i come to shy to speak in front of
[1:17:16] people
[1:17:19] but god
[1:17:21] when i when i look back
[1:17:24] and i look at where he's taken me from
[1:17:26] south africa
[1:17:28] moved me to the uk
[1:17:30] moved me here
[1:17:32] i see
[1:17:33] that there were certain things
[1:17:35] that god needed me to he wanted he had
[1:17:39] planned it out
[1:17:41] i had to just die to be obedient
[1:17:44] to what he wanted them
[1:17:46] and doesn't matter what came my way what
[1:17:49] challenges
[1:17:50] the purpose of god for my life
[1:17:54] had to be fulfilled it had to come to
[1:17:59] pass
[1:18:03] so no matter how little you are
[1:18:05] how big you are
[1:18:07] how important you are how unimportant
[1:18:09] you are
[1:18:10] you
[1:18:11] are here
[1:18:12] to serve
[1:18:13] a purpose
[1:18:16] as i'm looking at you tonight
[1:18:18] you
[1:18:19] are here
[1:18:21] to serve
[1:18:22] a purpose
[1:18:24] and you just allow him
[1:18:28] allow him amen
[1:18:30] open up yourself and say lord
[1:18:33] i'm available
[1:18:36] to
[1:18:37] you amen
[1:18:47] until god's
[1:18:48] purpose is fulfilled
[1:18:51] no matter how much trouble
[1:18:54] i listened to brother isaac
[1:18:56] and i'm so grateful for your testimony
[1:18:57] you could you stood here and he said i
[1:19:00] went to this and i went through that but
[1:19:03] i overcame
[1:19:09] that's your testimony
[1:19:11] you are overcomers
[1:19:14] do you know that
[1:19:17] that you are an
[1:19:19] overcomer
[1:19:24] he's called you
[1:19:26] to be
[1:19:27] an overcomer
[1:19:33] i told the church back home
[1:19:35] because some people looked at me kind of
[1:19:37] strange and i said that
[1:19:38] being overcomer
[1:19:40] so i said okay let's push the spiritual
[1:19:42] stuff aside
[1:19:44] let's just go natural for the change
[1:19:46] and so i told him i said
[1:19:48] this morning
[1:19:49] maybe it was a bit cold
[1:19:51] and you were laying in your home bed
[1:19:56] but you had to
[1:19:57] overcome
[1:19:59] the desire
[1:20:01] to sleep in
[1:20:03] you see you knew that this was happening
[1:20:05] this weekend
[1:20:07] but there was a desire man it's so cold
[1:20:10] i don't want to get out of this home bed
[1:20:12] but you did
[1:20:16] and because you did that
[1:20:18] you overcame
[1:20:22] the warm dead
[1:20:26] so just on the natural side you i'm
[1:20:28] looking at overcomers here today
[1:20:33] now take that to the spiritual
[1:20:36] and know that there's a god
[1:20:39] that's loving inside of you
[1:20:43] why
[1:20:44] [Applause]
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:46] [Applause]
[1:20:56] he talks about abraham and sarah he says
[1:20:59] nothing can defeat his purpose
[1:21:01] not even death
[1:21:03] abraham was as good as dead
[1:21:05] and sarah's whom
[1:21:07] had been dead for 40 or 50 years
[1:21:09] but nothing can defeat god's purpose
[1:21:13] her body was old
[1:21:15] it was wrinkled
[1:21:17] the milk veins would ride up
[1:21:21] so when the natural person would look at
[1:21:24] that they say how
[1:21:26] is it possible
[1:21:29] but the purpose of god
[1:21:32] if god said something
[1:21:35] is going to happen
[1:21:37] so he said
[1:21:39] he
[1:21:40] changed sarah
[1:21:42] made her a young woman again
[1:21:44] and took a man 100 years old turned him
[1:21:47] back to his youth
[1:21:49] no matter how
[1:21:51] unreasonable
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:54] it
[1:21:55] may
[1:21:56] sin
[1:21:58] if god
[1:22:00] has given
[1:22:02] a promise
[1:22:04] that promise
[1:22:06] will stands
[1:22:12] and i like i like i like telling people
[1:22:14] this i say
[1:22:15] don't
[1:22:16] when when god has given you a promise
[1:22:19] focus
[1:22:21] on
[1:22:22] the promise
[1:22:24] you will see the problems
[1:22:27] all around you
[1:22:29] but don't focus on the problems
[1:22:33] focus on the promised
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:41] focus on the promise
[1:22:42] [Applause]
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:49] like i said i don't know i don't know
[1:22:51] many of your
[1:22:53] you know things that you go through in
[1:22:55] life
[1:22:56] but i wrote down yes it even
[1:22:59] if you might feel
[1:23:01] bound
[1:23:04] maybe not even spiritually bound
[1:23:07] maybe just
[1:23:09] bound with some kind of sickness
[1:23:12] maybe some kind of i don't know what it
[1:23:15] is
[1:23:16] maybe you you know you're sitting here
[1:23:18] you're listening to the ministry you
[1:23:20] listen to by the tears and you saying
[1:23:22] man i
[1:23:24] want fats
[1:23:26] that brother tells us
[1:23:28] i want it
[1:23:32] you
[1:23:39] all you need to do
[1:23:43] is they say take that step
[1:23:47] that's all i mean
[1:23:49] don't listen to things around you
[1:23:52] don't worry about who's around you
[1:23:55] all you do is
[1:23:56] take that step
[1:23:59] once you've taken that step you know
[1:24:02] because it's always difficult
[1:24:04] it's difficult
[1:24:06] to take that one step
[1:24:09] but once you've taken that one step
[1:24:13] you can take the next step and then you
[1:24:16] can take the next step
[1:24:20] [Applause]
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:22] [Applause]
[1:24:27] it could be a step now i'm not saying
[1:24:30] come to the altar and
[1:24:32] i'm not pushing it away either
[1:24:34] right
[1:24:35] god works in various ways
[1:24:38] if it means
[1:24:39] that you need to take that step
[1:24:42] and come here and pray and say lord i
[1:24:45] need you
[1:24:48] do it
[1:24:51] [Music]
[1:24:52] it might be god just calling you
[1:24:56] calling you
[1:24:57] saying
[1:24:58] come
[1:24:59] just take that step
[1:25:01] take that step
[1:25:03] this greatness within you
[1:25:07] there's a there's a specific purpose
[1:25:10] that i have for your life
[1:25:12] but i need you
[1:25:14] or even in your seat
[1:25:16] i need you
[1:25:18] to open up your heart
[1:25:20] and say lord
[1:25:22] forgive me
[1:25:24] lord i want to serve you
[1:25:29] help me
[1:25:32] simple as that
[1:25:35] it's not rocket science
[1:25:37] it's not that complicated physics or
[1:25:38] complicated maths
[1:25:42] it's as simple as saying
[1:25:45] i need you
[1:25:47] it's as simple as just being
[1:25:50] brutally
[1:25:51] honest
[1:25:53] with him
[1:25:55] you see he wants to move you if
[1:25:58] there's no one here
[1:26:00] in the meeting and there's maybe someone
[1:26:01] on the live stream
[1:26:03] he wants to move you from a he wants you
[1:26:05] to switch positions he wants to move you
[1:26:09] from a position where you think you are
[1:26:11] in a prison house
[1:26:13] and he wants to move you to the rightful
[1:26:16] position where you should be
[1:26:19] a position of authority a position of
[1:26:22] dominion
[1:26:24] because that is why you were created
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:34] so i ask you allow god
[1:26:38] to reveal himself
[1:26:40] to you
[1:26:43] and i apologize
[1:26:45] for saying this in message churches
[1:26:46] because all message people are very holy
[1:26:48] and they don't make mistakes and they
[1:26:50] and i apologize for that
[1:26:53] but if you're someone
[1:26:55] that's struggling and really wants to
[1:26:58] go to that next level with god he's
[1:27:02] available amen not cares not about cat
[1:27:06] it's about him
[1:27:08] he's available amen to you
[1:27:12] just take
[1:27:14] that
[1:27:15] step
[1:27:17] that's all you do
[1:27:19] and he can switch your position amen
[1:27:23] switch you from wherever you are and
[1:27:25] take you into another level
[1:27:28] with him
[1:27:29] because he wants you and me to come
[1:27:33] up
[1:27:33] higher
[1:27:34] he wants to move you
[1:27:36] from a
[1:27:38] prison
[1:27:39] into
[1:27:41] power
[1:27:42] i love that
[1:27:44] prison
[1:27:45] to power
[1:27:47] amen
[1:27:49] and you know who in the bible went from
[1:27:51] prison to power
[1:27:52] [Laughter]
[1:27:55] someone i love in his name was joseph
[1:27:59] joseph
[1:28:02] prison
[1:28:03] to power
[1:28:04] to authority
[1:28:06] sickening command
[1:28:08] to pharaoh
[1:28:10] now just let me just go through some
[1:28:12] things here
[1:28:13] i like i like joseph so he would allow
[1:28:15] me just to
[1:28:16] let's just walk through a little bit of
[1:28:17] joseph if it's okay
[1:28:19] and i'm gonna try to make it as simple
[1:28:21] as i can especially
[1:28:23] for young people you know
[1:28:25] many times i used to find myself sitting
[1:28:27] in church as a young person and
[1:28:29] listening to the minister's minister and
[1:28:31] they would use all these complicated
[1:28:33] words and to just go over my head and
[1:28:37] you know it just confused me but not
[1:28:39] that you mustn't do that just that i
[1:28:42] remember as a young person
[1:28:44] many times i would just sit in church
[1:28:45] and have no idea
[1:28:47] what's being said then
[1:28:50] and obviously tried to memorize those
[1:28:52] big words
[1:28:53] so i could use it for somebody and sound
[1:28:57] sound very messy intellectual
[1:29:02] anyway so you know you know if you go if
[1:29:04] you read in the messages of brother
[1:29:05] branham and he would he would talk about
[1:29:07] joseph and i'm not going to go into
[1:29:09] these things but you know you talk about
[1:29:11] how joseph you know the life of joseph
[1:29:14] would be a perfect he says it's a a
[1:29:17] perfect type
[1:29:18] of our lord jesus christ
[1:29:20] you know and uh you would you'd use
[1:29:23] words like you know joseph perfection
[1:29:25] you'd use words like jacob grace and uh
[1:29:29] or you'd say there's nothing against
[1:29:31] joseph
[1:29:32] perfect joseph you know and um
[1:29:35] and and then he would come and you'd
[1:29:36] take that and you turn it and say
[1:29:38] there's nothing against you
[1:29:42] and many times we would sit there by the
[1:29:44] crest and we would hear that nothing
[1:29:46] against you
[1:29:48] nothing against me
[1:29:50] does the lord know what i did yesterday
[1:29:53] no
[1:29:54] nothing against me
[1:29:57] so we would hear these things and read
[1:29:59] hear things like you know you're the
[1:30:00] poor the pure sinless virtuous bride
[1:30:05] of our lord jesus christ and that is who
[1:30:07] you are amen
[1:30:09] and that's why i say this building it
[1:30:11] was elected year
[1:30:14] was for you
[1:30:16] so that we could be here the purpose so
[1:30:19] that shekinah could could could
[1:30:21] celebrate 10 years of the grace of god
[1:30:24] and this body would be available to
[1:30:27] house
[1:30:29] the pure
[1:30:30] bride of jesus christ that's sitting
[1:30:34] here right now
[1:30:37] in his presence
[1:30:41] and i i mentioned that word you know as
[1:30:43] as you know and as we're going through
[1:30:45] the word and as i i read about joseph
[1:30:48] and you know i i read about the various
[1:30:50] things it just gets me so excited it
[1:30:52] gets me so enthused when i see the grace
[1:30:56] of god
[1:30:57] in that life
[1:30:58] of joseph
[1:31:02] so now psalm 105 verse 17 said that you
[1:31:05] know um joseph was sold
[1:31:08] for a servant
[1:31:10] now we know for those of us that know
[1:31:13] what happened
[1:31:14] with joseph
[1:31:16] joseph was he was a
[1:31:18] he was um
[1:31:20] to his brothers
[1:31:22] to his brethren he was kind of strange
[1:31:25] kind of kind of weird
[1:31:28] now i want to just read something
[1:31:29] whether branham says he says
[1:31:31] let me show you a beautiful type here in
[1:31:32] joseph
[1:31:34] he says joseph
[1:31:35] the spirit man
[1:31:37] he says the eagle he was born amongst
[1:31:39] his brothers
[1:31:41] just like the real church is among the
[1:31:43] other and he could interpret dreams and
[1:31:45] see visions you see there was something
[1:31:47] different about joseph
[1:31:49] but the rest of them hated him
[1:31:53] but his father loved him
[1:31:57] and maybe there might be some sitting
[1:31:59] here today and you know people out there
[1:32:01] might hate you and might ridicule you
[1:32:03] and might think man you're so strange
[1:32:07] or that church a kind of man they are a
[1:32:10] strange bunch of people
[1:32:12] but god loves you
[1:32:15] he's mindful of youth
[1:32:17] if we look at what is done in shaking
[1:32:20] the tabernacle
[1:32:22] man it it makes me so emotional so i was
[1:32:24] crying
[1:32:26] to see the grace of god
[1:32:30] so
[1:32:31] the brandon says he was thrown into
[1:32:32] ditch and supposed to be dead
[1:32:35] he says that he says
[1:32:37] joseph was a perfect example he said it
[1:32:40] was christ
[1:32:42] in joseph
[1:32:44] he talks about the brothers and everyone
[1:32:46] else around they hated him
[1:32:49] without
[1:32:50] a cause
[1:32:53] they hated him
[1:32:55] because he was who he was
[1:32:59] he couldn't help
[1:33:01] being who
[1:33:03] he was
[1:33:05] but the problem says
[1:33:07] the man joseph
[1:33:08] couldn't help
[1:33:10] he was just who he was
[1:33:12] but the brandon says what he was he was
[1:33:16] and all the brothers hated him
[1:33:20] because joseph
[1:33:21] was spiritual
[1:33:23] joseph
[1:33:25] had dreams
[1:33:27] joseph the lord
[1:33:29] would reveal things
[1:33:31] to joseph
[1:33:33] yeah
[1:33:34] but joseph probably in the home of his
[1:33:36] dad and mom and
[1:33:38] you know even though the brothers hated
[1:33:39] him dad loved him
[1:33:41] so he probably had an okay life
[1:33:44] but he had no idea
[1:33:47] what was coming
[1:33:50] ahead
[1:33:51] in his life
[1:33:53] but joseph
[1:33:54] was spiritually minded
[1:33:58] you know we know about he had these
[1:33:59] spiritual dreams and he was even rebuked
[1:34:02] by his dad to say ah are you telling me
[1:34:05] that me your mom and i we're gonna bow
[1:34:07] down to you
[1:34:09] but joseph was just who joseph was
[1:34:14] and the brethren the brothers probably
[1:34:16] thought
[1:34:17] you know i don't know if you've heard
[1:34:18] the statement before
[1:34:19] and that he was heavenly minded
[1:34:23] and no earthly good
[1:34:26] i don't even heard that statement before
[1:34:27] now
[1:34:28] i i used to use that statement sometimes
[1:34:31] right we i would say people they're so
[1:34:32] heavenly minded all they want they want
[1:34:34] to act super spiritual but their life is
[1:34:36] a mess
[1:34:38] until the lord came to rebuke me
[1:34:41] the lord came to rebuke me
[1:34:44] and he he allowed me to come across
[1:34:46] something that somebody had said
[1:34:48] about that statement
[1:34:51] you heavenly minded
[1:34:53] but you know earthly good
[1:34:56] they said yeah i'm gonna just read this
[1:34:58] if you read history you will find that
[1:35:01] the christians
[1:35:02] who did the most for the present world
[1:35:06] were just those who thought most
[1:35:10] of the next most of heaven
[1:35:14] he says the apostles themselves
[1:35:17] remember the apostles
[1:35:19] they were heavenly minded
[1:35:22] they said the apostles themselves who
[1:35:24] set on foot the conversion of the roman
[1:35:27] empire
[1:35:28] the great men who built up the middle
[1:35:30] ages and the english evangelicals who
[1:35:33] abolished
[1:35:35] the slave trade
[1:35:36] all left their mark on earth
[1:35:40] because their minds
[1:35:42] were occupied with heaven
[1:35:46] let's get our minds
[1:35:50] occupied
[1:35:51] with heaven
[1:35:54] and as our minds are occupied
[1:35:57] with heaven
[1:35:59] heaven will come down
[1:36:02] and teach us
[1:36:04] how to control our home
[1:36:06] how to run the home
[1:36:09] how to run the church
[1:36:12] how to be a christian
[1:36:15] at work
[1:36:20] it is
[1:36:22] that since christians have largely
[1:36:25] ceased
[1:36:26] to think
[1:36:28] of heaven
[1:36:30] that they have become so
[1:36:32] ineffective
[1:36:34] in this world
[1:36:37] let's think on him
[1:36:40] allow him
[1:36:42] to lead us
[1:36:44] to guide us
[1:36:46] you make us better parents
[1:36:48] better moms
[1:36:50] better dads
[1:36:52] better deacons
[1:36:54] better ministers
[1:36:56] better pastors
[1:36:59] let's be heavenly minded
[1:37:01] so that we can do good
[1:37:04] with
[1:37:06] now joseph was so
[1:37:08] strange to his brethren
[1:37:11] that they hated him
[1:37:14] but joseph at the time obviously was
[1:37:16] protected by dad so
[1:37:17] maybe it didn't really bother him
[1:37:20] the hatred
[1:37:22] he probably felt that he knew about it
[1:37:24] but he had that protection by that
[1:37:28] so
[1:37:31] we know the story
[1:37:32] how joseph
[1:37:34] was then sold
[1:37:37] as a slave
[1:37:39] so the brothers came for those of us
[1:37:40] they don't know the what happened in the
[1:37:42] bible the brothers came joseph came to
[1:37:45] visit them they grabbed him threw him in
[1:37:47] the pits
[1:37:48] wanted to kill him
[1:37:51] some slave traders came past they took
[1:37:53] him out of the pit
[1:37:55] cave sold him to the slave trader slave
[1:37:58] traders
[1:37:59] and sent him away told lies to the dead
[1:38:04] so here's joseph
[1:38:06] a slave
[1:38:09] having every reason
[1:38:12] to hate
[1:38:14] his brothers
[1:38:17] every reason
[1:38:20] because i can imagine
[1:38:22] being a slave in those days
[1:38:26] wasn't nice
[1:38:28] it was probably horrible
[1:38:31] slaves were mistreated
[1:38:33] now i know we read about how david found
[1:38:36] that joseph found favor
[1:38:37] but i know and as i read it
[1:38:40] joseph had to prove himself
[1:38:43] in order to find favor
[1:38:45] but until that time
[1:38:48] man i can imagine he was probably
[1:38:51] mistreated
[1:38:54] and every time the master would kick him
[1:38:57] he'd probably think to himself about the
[1:38:59] brothers
[1:39:02] and maybe
[1:39:04] something would rise up inside of him
[1:39:08] but because joseph
[1:39:11] was joseph
[1:39:13] i believe god
[1:39:15] was using these opportunities
[1:39:18] for joseph to learn
[1:39:22] forgiveness
[1:39:26] i can imagine joseph
[1:39:30] being ordered this way and ordered that
[1:39:33] way
[1:39:38] then as the orders would come in
[1:39:41] maybe he's getting so tired
[1:39:44] and then maybe his mind would go back to
[1:39:47] the days with dad and mom
[1:39:50] then maybe he'd start having those
[1:39:52] battles in the mind
[1:39:55] my brothers
[1:39:57] it's because of them
[1:39:59] that i'm here
[1:40:03] but joseph had every reason
[1:40:07] to hate them
[1:40:10] every reason
[1:40:12] to point fingers at them
[1:40:15] we find as you follow the life of joseph
[1:40:20] he calls as a slave in the house of
[1:40:23] potiphar
[1:40:26] and in the house of potiphar he starts
[1:40:28] to prove himself
[1:40:31] and then potiphar realizes hey i've got
[1:40:34] golger
[1:40:35] and then potiphar starts elevating him
[1:40:37] into a certain position
[1:40:40] and the bible teaches us how everything
[1:40:43] that joseph touched prospered
[1:40:46] and you'd say joseph son of prosperity
[1:40:52] so maybe there was a time in joseph's
[1:40:54] life where things were going okay
[1:40:57] still a slave but things were going okay
[1:41:02] but you see god
[1:41:04] had a purpose
[1:41:06] and a plan
[1:41:07] for joseph's life
[1:41:10] now us sitting here today 2022 we know
[1:41:13] what happened we know where joseph ended
[1:41:16] up
[1:41:17] but at the time of the marcus joseph had
[1:41:20] no idea yes he had visions maybe yes he
[1:41:24] had dreams and you know the lord had
[1:41:26] probably spoken to him and showed him
[1:41:29] but maybe being in the situation that he
[1:41:32] was maybe he would question and think
[1:41:35] man am i really
[1:41:37] going to move
[1:41:39] into the position of power am i really
[1:41:41] going to move from this present house of
[1:41:44] slavery
[1:41:45] into a position of power amen but you
[1:41:48] see god was moving things
[1:41:54] and then in the house of potiphar
[1:41:57] part of his
[1:41:58] wife tries to seduce joseph
[1:42:04] brother actually uses the word he says
[1:42:07] this beautiful woman
[1:42:10] tried to seduce that joseph was a man
[1:42:14] and the bible does say he resisted
[1:42:17] but i can imagine as a man
[1:42:20] being seduced
[1:42:22] by this beautiful woman
[1:42:24] it took something within joseph
[1:42:28] to say no
[1:42:32] and i believe that today as you and i
[1:42:35] sit here
[1:42:36] in the presence of almighty god there's
[1:42:40] something within you young man and young
[1:42:43] lady and brother and sister that can say
[1:42:47] no
[1:42:50] [Applause]
[1:42:56] and then if we look at that story we
[1:42:57] know that joseph
[1:42:59] was then
[1:43:01] falsely accused
[1:43:03] by potiphar's wife
[1:43:06] and then she end he ended up
[1:43:09] in the prison
[1:43:11] in the prison house
[1:43:15] not in power
[1:43:18] but in prison
[1:43:20] in the pharaoh's
[1:43:21] prison
[1:43:23] a dirty place probably
[1:43:25] ugly place
[1:43:27] horrible place
[1:43:29] that is where joseph
[1:43:32] ended up
[1:43:34] in prison
[1:43:36] and then being in prison
[1:43:38] i can imagine joseph sitting there
[1:43:41] and thinking how
[1:43:43] did all of this start
[1:43:46] then maybe his mind would go back
[1:43:50] my brothers
[1:43:52] it's because of them
[1:43:54] that i am sure
[1:43:57] and again he had all the right amen
[1:44:02] to say i like them
[1:44:06] but nowhere in the scriptures
[1:44:09] do we find excuse me
[1:44:11] that joseph ever said
[1:44:15] i hate them
[1:44:16] but the brandon teaches us joseph
[1:44:19] was a perfect type of christ
[1:44:22] he said there was christ
[1:44:24] in
[1:44:25] joseph
[1:44:29] the brandon says he says in the prisoner
[1:44:31] maybe he's sitting in the prison and
[1:44:33] he's
[1:44:34] remembering the dreams
[1:44:36] and he's remembering
[1:44:38] the prophecy that went out maybe
[1:44:41] remembering this and remembering that
[1:44:44] but he's sitting
[1:44:46] in a prison house
[1:44:48] in a forfeit
[1:44:50] dirty
[1:44:52] ungodly probably place
[1:44:55] random says in a prison he says now
[1:44:57] remember he was thinking
[1:45:00] he also became a total failure
[1:45:04] so maybe joseph was sitting there
[1:45:07] in prison
[1:45:09] thinking about this and thinking about
[1:45:12] that
[1:45:13] and maybe even feeling like a total
[1:45:17] failure
[1:45:20] i mean
[1:45:21] yes the lord had given him the dreams
[1:45:23] and he knew that you know this
[1:45:25] there's something special about me
[1:45:28] but here i am
[1:45:30] sitting
[1:45:32] in a prison house
[1:45:36] there may be some of us sitting here
[1:45:37] tonight
[1:45:39] maybe we've been going through hellish
[1:45:42] times
[1:45:44] maybe we've had our own brethren
[1:45:48] turn
[1:45:49] against us
[1:45:53] and we have every reason
[1:45:58] to point fingers
[1:46:01] every reason to say i hate them
[1:46:07] but joseph
[1:46:09] being a type of christ
[1:46:14] nowhere in the bible
[1:46:16] did joseph
[1:46:17] ever say
[1:46:19] i
[1:46:20] hate them
[1:46:24] it might be someone sitting here you
[1:46:26] might think i'm a total
[1:46:29] failure amen
[1:46:32] i want you to know
[1:46:34] that you are not
[1:46:37] you might be sitting here today and
[1:46:39] thinking i'm in a prison house
[1:46:42] circumstances happen in my life this
[1:46:45] happened and that happened and here i am
[1:46:48] and i feel so like a
[1:46:53] the nothing just
[1:46:55] pressed on my
[1:46:56] heart to let you know
[1:46:59] don't tell yourself that
[1:47:04] you are not a nothing
[1:47:09] there is greatness within you
[1:47:14] and maybe god is just using the
[1:47:18] opportunity
[1:47:20] to get that greatness
[1:47:23] to come to the surface
[1:47:26] this may be using certain circumstances
[1:47:30] maybe using certain brothers maybe using
[1:47:33] certain situations
[1:47:36] because greatness is inside of you
[1:47:40] and that greatness
[1:47:42] needs to come
[1:47:43] to the floor
[1:47:48] you know a lot of times we always tend
[1:47:49] to think that
[1:47:51] trouble and
[1:47:52] problems if we want to blame the devil
[1:47:55] but sometimes god
[1:47:58] allows
[1:48:00] certain things
[1:48:01] to happen
[1:48:03] in our lives
[1:48:05] if you want if you want to argue that
[1:48:07] just go and look at the life of joseph
[1:48:10] how god allowed certain things to happen
[1:48:15] and i had to learn from that and tell
[1:48:18] myself tess
[1:48:20] don't judge
[1:48:22] maybe god just allowed certain things to
[1:48:24] happen
[1:48:26] because something needs to be changed
[1:48:29] in that young person
[1:48:31] something great is in that sister
[1:48:34] and god is just using that kind of
[1:48:37] pleasure
[1:48:38] to bring it out
[1:48:41] i'm obviously not advocating that you
[1:48:44] can go out and sin
[1:48:46] but i'm just saying the lord has taught
[1:48:48] me
[1:48:49] not to point fingers
[1:48:51] not the judge
[1:48:53] but to pray
[1:48:58] and i was listening to um
[1:49:00] brother kaidrina the other day
[1:49:04] and he actually he was he was i think he
[1:49:05] was giving his testimony
[1:49:08] and he talks about how he just you know
[1:49:10] wasn't really interested in god
[1:49:13] but he says god then
[1:49:15] allowed cancer
[1:49:18] to hit his brain
[1:49:21] and you see it for him
[1:49:23] that was
[1:49:24] a wake-up call
[1:49:27] for god
[1:49:29] to get
[1:49:30] his attention
[1:49:34] no i don't know again i'm repeating
[1:49:36] myself me the lord doesn't want me to
[1:49:38] repeat myself but i don't know what
[1:49:40] you're going through
[1:49:42] but just think about the things that you
[1:49:45] are going through
[1:49:48] and ask yourself the question
[1:49:51] is this maybe the lord
[1:49:55] that's calling me
[1:49:58] pulling me
[1:50:00] beckoning me
[1:50:02] and saying come
[1:50:04] come
[1:50:06] that's all i want from you
[1:50:08] i want you just to take that step
[1:50:11] if it means just
[1:50:13] raising my hand if i've never done it
[1:50:15] before
[1:50:16] raise your hands
[1:50:19] if it means just
[1:50:21] giving over
[1:50:23] because that's what he wants
[1:50:25] he wants you and me just to
[1:50:28] give over
[1:50:31] give it to him
[1:50:33] don't you try to fight
[1:50:37] your battles
[1:50:40] give it
[1:50:41] to him
[1:50:44] he will help you
[1:50:48] he will show you
[1:50:51] how to do
[1:50:53] what you
[1:50:54] must do
[1:50:58] you know as you're sitting here tonight
[1:51:02] there's a greatness
[1:51:06] within you
[1:51:09] you might be the youngest person here
[1:51:11] tonight we have faith
[1:51:13] she's maybe one of the youngest out here
[1:51:16] with this younger
[1:51:18] there's something special
[1:51:21] within you
[1:51:25] and maybe others can't see it
[1:51:28] but he sees it
[1:51:30] i mean and he wants you
[1:51:33] and me
[1:51:35] to recognize
[1:51:37] that there's something within you
[1:51:41] there is something there
[1:51:44] that can be a help
[1:51:47] against the powers of hell
[1:51:53] you
[1:51:55] can be a catalyst
[1:51:59] for your friend
[1:52:05] you
[1:52:06] can be a conscious
[1:52:09] but all he wants from you
[1:52:12] is to surrender
[1:52:14] all he wants from you
[1:52:16] is to let go
[1:52:21] he told me to tell you don't let the
[1:52:23] devil
[1:52:24] pull you around
[1:52:27] don't let the devil kick you this way
[1:52:31] and kick you that way
[1:52:33] because he's a bullish
[1:52:37] don't let him
[1:52:44] you need to do tonight tonight i just
[1:52:46] feel in my heart
[1:52:48] tonight
[1:52:50] give
[1:52:52] your life
[1:52:53] to jesus i mean
[1:52:55] just
[1:52:56] let go let go
[1:53:02] because if you go and look at the story
[1:53:04] of joseph
[1:53:05] there came a time
[1:53:08] when joseph
[1:53:10] had to switch position
[1:53:14] where joseph had to step from
[1:53:17] prison
[1:53:18] into a position of power
[1:53:22] into a position of authority it was
[1:53:25] always in him
[1:53:29] and that's right now within you his
[1:53:32] people
[1:53:36] but he wants you
[1:53:39] he wants you
[1:53:41] just to let go
[1:53:45] it's a song that says let go
[1:53:48] and let god have
[1:53:50] his wonderful way
[1:53:53] let go
[1:53:55] and let god have his
[1:53:57] way
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:00] your troubles will vanish
[1:54:04] your night
[1:54:05] turn
[1:54:06] today let go and let god have
[1:54:11] his way
[1:54:13] as you bow our heads and
[1:54:15] the musicians can come
[1:54:20] thank you

[1:57:45] [Music]
[1:57:47] where my life was changed
[1:57:52] that was the day
[1:57:55] i received the holy ghost
[1:57:59] that was the day
[1:58:02] i responded
[1:58:07] not to the voice of brother tears
[1:58:12] but i responded
[1:58:15] to the voice of god

[2:01:25] you can move
[2:01:27] and switch position
[2:01:30] where you can move out of that prison
[2:01:33] house
[2:01:35] into a position of power
[2:01:38] where there's a greatness within you
[2:01:42] that will have an authority and a power
[2:01:45] over that demon of pornography
