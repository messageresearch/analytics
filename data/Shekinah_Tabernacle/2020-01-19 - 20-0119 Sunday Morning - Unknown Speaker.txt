musicians music and bless you enjoy the song service to begin and I just just want to say a real special thank you for for this local church for all the effort that you've put in and I know many of

special greeting from from Stratford from the church back home and but I didn't also contacted me this morning and said say hello again to them from me so I'm passing on the greeting he really enjoyed the time with you last weekend and I trust that you enjoyed the time with him we just we just all part of the body we all just fell out a little little path and the whole real real special tools I have brother Freddie and sister Doreen here this morning I I would much rather sit in the pews and listen to you my brother seasoned minister but I understand it's your weekend off so we like really to have a break this morning praise the Lord so this morning I would like to share something that that I've just been looking at over the last last few months just little bits and pieces and and I I testified last night that when the Lord touched my my heart about seven years ago now the the message became a new message and things that over the years that I looked at intellectually and try to understand and try to dig into things and so forth when the Lord starts opening it it's just so simple it's just so completely different and when the Lord opens the word it's I don't know it becomes personal and something that that I found is that that even the deepest doctrine have a life application because it's a life that's lived in us and so forth and it's just it's just wonderful and and I always say that the word is is to me like like a little kid in a candy store these little pink lollies and blue lollies and purple lollies and all sorts of in-between lollies and where do you start you know that's the kind of thing and the word is just like that there's so much in that what I what I just I don't know and I trust this is okay brother Ben but but for me when I read the message is exactly the same spirit that's that's behind the Bible you know where you can read in the Bible and and it's not presented in an intellectual structured way exactly right but you can read the same verse over and over and over and over and get more and more and more than more you read it and for me the message is the same you rested listen to some of those messages and we were we were just sharing I think yesterday or the day before with one of the young brothers that you know you would listen to a message and rejoice in it and enjoy it and get a lot out of it and then you would sit and listen to someone else preaching out of that exact same message and it's like well I didn't see that question I didn't see that quite a night you see because the Lord just keeps on anointing little bits and pieces over so I'm just gonna I guess prop perhaps I'll say this is this is my testimony did and when I say my testimony is just what the Lord is currently kind of making a life to me and and and what I'm rejoicing in this morning and I'll say again if anything is said that that's causing might be a question in your mind or anything go to your pastor you know his place they the Lord has placed him as responsible over your souls and and brother Brennan makes very clear statements that he will see you through and and I pray for your pastor he always needs that you know these things that that happen behind the scenes pressures etcetera they that you often don't know about keeping before the Lord keep on praying that the Lord will continue to open the word for you and so forth I remember I'm sorry this is just kind of personal like I guess but I remember thinking as a young Christian we on earth doesn't minister get something to preach about every week sometimes two or three times a week I mean wages come from I mean you got a really be sharp and I found out you don't have to be shy in fact I'm probably one of the least sharper ones in the room I mean but you know what the Lord is always there the Lord always has something the Lord the Lord always provides and I thank the Lord for them anyway I don't want to take more of your time I wonder if you could stand with me and we can turn in our Bibles to John 11 now the young people from church back home will recognize this the service I preached that the little while ago so if if you don't get anything more out of that than you got the first time then at least be my aiming corner okay johnny levin and we're gonna read from verse 41 don't 11:41 the end i took away the stone from the place where the date was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that there here is me always but because of the people which stand why I said it that they may believe that they are sent me and we need thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith unto them blue seam and licking go loose him and let him go have we lost the power point okay no problem so I'm just gonna hone in on that on that verse 43 and we need a dust spoke and he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth let's just pray one more time maybe as we pray this morning if you ever need on your heart that you haven't expressed to me it make it known to the Lord take these things to the Lord father we we are needy people Lord God but you've made us needy people so that we can draw on your attributes father because you wanted to wanted us to experience your attributes this morning father we want to come and bring our needs to you Lord father I pray that you will look into every heart law father I pray that you will Lord address those things that need to be addressed fun well Jesus I pray that you will provide that you will heal but you will undertake that you will manifest your attributes to us in every way we need comfort I pray that you will be the comforter well Jesus we need our coming I pray that you will be that of a common law father we need healing Lord we pray that you will provide the healing father God we thank you for these things I commit myself my brothers and sisters into your hands this morning and private in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seats but I mean is it okay if I take my jacket off hate me is this thing working not quite okay here we go so there's that vest right look at price the world so now we can relax not too much so you fall asleep I mean especially the young ones that were so busy yesterday I understand they they had to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning the Dinkelman so good on you my god biess you for those things so now brother branham speaks about how that that voice that rose lazarus from the date was the voice of the resurrection thank you very much ramela was the voice of the resurrection and how that voice had all the power of heaven behind it now brother Branham speaks about how it's it's not physical power it's the it's the authority like that young policeman like you see the thin little scrawny policeman with a cap hanging over his eyes and so forth but we need put his hand up I mean those big cars have to stop it's the same thing when Jesus stood they I mean he was not much to look at I mean the Bible speaks about not no beauty that we should desire him and so forth but when he spoke I mean all that although all of heaven was behind him and nothing can stop his voice I mean nothing can stop his word from coming to pass and we thank the Lord for that brother Brennan makes the statement he says I believe brother if he hadn't have called him specifically by the name of Lazarus I believe the general resurrection would have spiked in place I mean that's how much power there was in the voice I mean if he just said come forth I mean then all the graves would have come forth I mean that's what I think about him brother Branham says that's right I believe the resurrection of every date thing that ever died would have come out of the grave if they had just said come forth yes sir but he called Lazarus come forth I mean in this morning I'm titling this Lazarus come forth and that voice is called Lazarus by name that same voice is calling us by night in fact the same voice is called us by name I mean and that is when when we get the revelation of who we are that's that voice I mean getting through to us so that we are called by name and respond and we thank God for those things hallelujah but that's how much power the in the word now our brother branham specifically links that voice that calls Lazarus Lazarus out of the grave with the voice of the rapture and I'm just I'm gonna have a few calls in in in between year this morning and I'll trust you you enjoy quotes I'm gonna shout and then a voice and then a trumpet chat and Mason Jay getting the people ready the second I remember these things because I'm gonna spend a bit of time on it so first shot the messenger getting the people ready second is a voice of the resurrection the same voice a loud voice and sanjana live and that's what we just read that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the dead sea to be caught up with it now watch the three things takes place the next is what was a trumpet a voice this is a shot a voice and a trumpet but what I want to hone in they he speaks when he speaks of that voice I mean he says it's the same voice that grows Lazarus from the date that's the same voice that you and I have heard that voice that rose Lazarus there's another place in the Bible and brother Branham refers to that quite often another loud voice and that loud voice was when Jesus I mean died on the cross and he cried out with a loud voice and so on but then there's other instances in the Bible many beautiful places and we read a number of places in in in in the Book of Revelations we with John pins down I heard behind me a voice and so for various places that it refers to voice but there's two specific ones I want to also include you revelation chapter five now we're talking opening of the seals happening now and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book loud voice that same voice then you have I'm sorry revelations chapter 10 which we know so well again that angel came down and cried with a loud voice as when the lion ruler roarer that's the voice we've heard I mean and that voice calls the seven thunders to otta I'm just kind of really having to rein myself in here because I don't want to run I hate too much yeah brother branham speaks about these things and and he links it all to the voice of the resurrection and he makes the statement in Revelation chapter 4 part 1 it is the same voice that summoned John come up the same voice and say to John come up is the same voice that will summons the church someday summons the church also the same voice that summoned John to come up is the same voice that summons dead Lazarus out of the grave that same voice of the Archangel it's the same voice that voice that life-giving voice but that voice that takes us from death into life hallelujah from temporal into eternal from part into fullness amen so now I know that we are very familiar with these things but but I'm just gonna kind of take it slow in and and just be Who I am and just relax and it lifts the Lord just kind of open these things so please don't think for a moment I'm kind I'm kind of under estimating you or nothing like this but I'm just gonna kind of slowly work my way through these things just because I'm so rejoicing in these things at the moment there's laws he's opening it so we had that quote and we know these things very well I mean about the the the three parts of the rapturing process and we read that in 1 Thessalonians I mean brother Branham referred to it and I'm just gonna focus on it again quickly for the Lord himself shall be seen from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God shut voice trumpet I mean very clear biblical background for those things so now I'm going to continue the others path of shout voice trumpet for a little bit what was the shot brother emcees it's a messenger the voice that has a message that means so so I let me not confuse things yet okay it's the shot we way God speaks through the messenger to reveal himself to the bride so so to put it bluntly I believe with all my heart that the message we've heard via the Prophet is that shirt I'll put it stronger than that I'll say I believe with all my heart the message that we've heard is the initiation or the first part of the rapture process so now it's the voice where the Ramseys is that same voice now in the bride that same message becoming alive in a bride now I'm gonna say it's the same shout but now it's in bride form it's no longer just in messenger form so now as that message becomes alive in our lives we've got to become the voice and and when I say it that way it's so easy to get under some impression that I have to manufacture something or I have to do something no it's his voice you see like when Jesus stood there all power of heaven was behind him it's that what I'm talking about it's not the vessel it's not us hallelujah and then the Trump I mean that finality of the rapturing process the body changing the the bride taking to the marriage feast and going on to reign with him and so on so now when we listen to the Seventh Seal message and this is this is coming to the things that that over the last few years have just really been such a blessing to me brother Branham makes a statement be that initially really confused me and yes I know I'm slow but you know what when these things just fall into place is so beautiful brother Adam starts preaching the Seventh Seal now I know this this debates around the message stories the Seventh Seal open isn't it open and so on and so on and it's just so much India that that's that's so beautiful of how how I'll just say it I it's it's pressing on my heart to say it the Seventh Seal is him the Seventh Seal is gone and and and I trust this is okay brother Ben but feel free to correct me afterwards if you don't agree but I believe that when revelation Steen came down what it speaks of is the seventh seal stepping down with a book in his hand and the Seventh Seal was actually the first one that opened because for the Seventh Seal for Jesus Christ to come down and open the seals he had to be here he had to have the six Scrolls in his hand and I and I know this is strong statements and I really hope this doesn't upset anyone that I trusted she's okay brother Ben but but there's so many principles in the Bible so many places and I don't want to take too much time because that's not really what I want to focus on this morning but just type after type after type after type and for me probably the most beautiful one is that woman at the well the seventh seal came to her and sat next to her and revealed to her she had five husbands and she's now with a 6-1 the seventh revealed to her that they six the seventh the the Lamb's Book of Life was open to her and showed her her natural part has six her man path has six steals the seventh seal reveals the six seals I mean I'll just leave that there I don't wanna I don't want to spend too much time but I trust that's okay so now brother Branham makes his statement in the seventh see when he preaches it now and he sees no can you roll on that slide I don't know what's happening he says and now as certain as I stand in a platform tonight I had the revelation that revealed it's in a three-fold manner a seventh seal nails in a three-fold manner and then he says I will speak to you by God's help of a fold of it so it's three fold three parts three whatever you want to call it of the seventh seal and then brother Branham says I am going to speak to you about the first part of the seventh seal the first fold of it and then brother Branham starts speaking about the baby shoe and the dreams and his own ministry and when I first read that it was I thought he was gonna speak about this evil see you now but he's speaking about his own ministry what's happening I mean what was the shout again I think the message that went forth when the Prophet was speaking about what when he was breaking the Seventh Seal what I was showing is the first part of the Seventh Seal is the shirt I believe when brother Branham was preaching the civil seal I mean he was opening the fact that the Seventh Seal is exactly the same thing because what is the Seventh Seal it's Christ its Christ descending it's Christ coming down in person and marrying a wife which is none other than the rapture process the first fold of the rapture process is what a shot he comes down so now when he opens the civil seal we often look for something that's so difficult and so hard and mysterious and out of reach and so forth and yes it is to the to the to the wise and prudent I mean but but God has opened these things to us and it is so simple and it is so I want to say intellectually not not out of reach for us and the youngest ones of us can understand these things because it's not difficult understanding wise but if your eyes are closed if we haven't received the ear to hear we can never get those things hallelujah now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna labor day for a moment I want to make it very very very clear like what brother Branham was doing these he was linking the Seventh Seal very very clearly with the rapture process and it is it is not something that is conceptually out of reach because like I said it is a bridegroom coming and our bridegroom in his descending he does it with a shout voice and a trumpet so I guess just to be very blunt about it what would be the second fold of the 7cu the voice what would be the third fold of the 7cu the Trump I mean now in that wonderful wonderful sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Branham he also makes amazing statements and I and I want to ask you the question what's the thrust of that sermon the thrust of the whole crisis the mystery Germany's God has a three-fold purpose I mean and and I just want to stop there for a moment what was was that purpose just suddenly something that God thought that that God wake up one morning and say this is a great idea Eureka I mean God doesn't have Eureka moments I mean when something is God's purpose it always was God's purpose it eternal II was because remember eternity goes back and it eternally will be his purpose and and brother Branham showed us the three-fold purpose of God and if we if we really put some emphasis on that the the the eternal purpose of God I will call it that that three-fold purpose of God that is his reason for existence that's his purpose that's what he wanted to achieve that's what he wanted to see that's what he wanted to fellowship with now remember it's Christ is the mystery of God revealed what's Christ is the anointing it's the life of God it's a life behind the word and of course we know these things I know this is really simple teaching but what's the first purpose Christ revealing himself to the bride second purpose him getting preeminence in his bride third purpose restoring it back to Eden restoring the kingdom and so forth now I'll just say it this way how did God reveal himself in this way that first purpose revealing himself how did God reveal himself in this day well a little Kentuckian went onto a platform and said remember when I preached to you sir is this a time I mean and he made statements like those things were prophecy but it's near history that little Kentuckian I mean reveal to us who God is that little Kentuckian took this word that was ink on paper and he might this will alive so that this word can now walk around I mean and we can all be this word and we become that way so what am i doing now Christ is the mystery three fold purpose the first purpose was the shot the first purpose was God making himself known and he made himself known like I said through elisa messenger he lisa is what get me a bride i mean get me right i'm coming down you know i'm gonna meet her I mean but give me a bride ready prepare that bride I mean and the bride is prepared in that threefold process hallelujah I mean so in the bride now receives this message now I'm taking you back to revelations Tina what does the bride to do she eats the book when she eats the book she what you are what you eat I mean spiritually speaking you are what you eat I mean we're not supposed to become youtube we're not supposed to become the internet we're not supposed to be anti Google we're supposed to grow into the world you are what you eat I mean this bride is this bride will be Eagles and Eagles will feed on eagle food I mean and that's what we eat and what's happening now is when this bride now receives through ILI's of the word that he sent to reveal himself I mean this bride now becomes that word so what's the second part of the threefold purpose the voice the second part is him getting preeminence in us I mean him being the main one us becoming him oh that I need to qualify some of these things lace of self and more of him dying to self relating Christ lived through us hallelujah and then of course the last portion of that is brother Ramses and when she really knows who she is the rapture will go I mean which is what the trumpet part I mean hallelujah back to Eden that's the third purpose I mean so he reveals himself to us he gets preeminence in us and then it takes a song which is exactly the rapture process again which is exactly the Seventh Seal again so now there's a few things that that started opening up to me that that I just and as I say I know I'm slowing and I just trusted you're awake enough to stay with me and that we can just rejoice in these things this morning so the shirt was revealing the bridegroom was relieved was revealing the Seventh Seal which is the revelation of the second coming like I said which is the revelation of the ravaging process which is the revelation of the fullness of the word the threefold purpose and the rapture and the seventh seal is exactly the same event in fact is exactly the same person and it's expressed in three folds and those folds are sharp voice trumpet now it becomes clearer to me everyday how it seems like every pretty near every major sermon brother Branham preached after the seals was on one thing and that was on the seventh seal pretty near every sermon he preached was along these lines him coming down him being here the presence of God unrecognized all those things him actually making known to us hey hang on it was not just a Kentuckian that was here there was more he was preaching who is this Melchizedek I mean he was preaching all those things he's prison here I mean recognize the sign of the Messiah was performed how many times were the sign of the Messiah performed in the past every time the sign of the Messiah was was performed it was showing Melchizedek was here the first time was what when he came to Abraham Sarah behind him in the teen the second time what Jesus was here on earth he says yes you had six husbands and so forth or Peter I know you you've used your father's name is Jonas and so forth I mean the sign of the Messiah and that same sign of the Messiah was performed again in this day saying what I mean this year again I mean Messiah Melchizedek is here again the same word is here again I wanna say the same fullness of the word is here again hallelujah I mean so the shout really was the open Word of God expressed through the seventh angel messenger first but then becoming alive in us hallelujah I put it this way the shout was the son of man revealing himself firstly through a son of man hallelujah now I'm gonna just say this is me this is how I understand it and this is how I believe it but really I believe the son of man ministry I mean was really only the third pole part of brother branham's ministry yeast his lap over period and so forth but when he started breaking that word he moved on into death eagle anointing he moved on into the seventh seal so to speak the first and second pools were partly under a man anointing under a church age dispensation but the third pole goes further now remember I'm not saying later Decius finish don't get me wrong but I believe as he's pulling us into him as he's becoming one with his bride now remember brother Ramses the marriage takes place here I mean and as we becoming one with him we are now in a bride age I mean because he's not calling us Church anymore he's calling us bride but what the churches are still in the church age I mean so I'm not saying we dine I'm not saying we're in the Millennium now I'm not saying we know glorified bodies now I'd be very disappointed if that was the case I mean but the reality is we are no longer in laodicea these people around us that's in later this year but we have been called higher he said come up higher John I mean and John represented the bride and he said come up higher come into me come become one with me I've got more for you than I have for the laborers I've got more for you than I have for the Gleaners I've got more for you than I have for all those people out in working in your vineyards and stuff you are mine and I am yours and this is what we have and the race doesn't matter I mean that's what God is saying to this bride and he's revealing it to the bride but he's revealing it in simplicity and he revealed it and he started that process through a little Kentuckian who who grew up with a bad name because of his family because of his father's alcohol problem and so forth had really no religious background whatsoever and people would pull their noses up and say best guy he doesn't even have a he hardly has a seventh grade education how can he do this and that's the point God doesn't need our intellect I mean God doesn't meet our abilities God needs only our availability I mean God only needs us to die so completely to self so that he can be glorified in us so that he can use us and so that he can get the glory so that we not bigshots so it's not this big preacher or this big brother or this big sister or nothing like that so that God can be lifted up because he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me hallelujah I mean I believe that third pole was the Eagle anointing or laypeople at this place this this way I believe at the third pole that Eagle anointing was fully in place and it was really completely now present in Word form now I just want to place the emphasis slightly different to start making a point now so I'll ask again be with me what was the shirt the message that means forth now I'll ask you this question now what was the message was the message the little Kentuckian was the message i mean was the Stander's hallelujah a little Kentucky and speaking for a week long in March 1963 yes and no because yes God used that vessel to express himself through yes that was the ELISA that God spoke those things through but the reality is it wasn't his voice it wasn't his ideas in fact brother Brahim said himself he said I would have had it completely wrong but the angel came and it was he's where that was expressed I mean so yes in one way it was brother Brennan because he was the vessel that God was using but the word the inspiration the life came from something different I mean and that was that Melchizedek that was the god behind him what's the voice well the same thing is that same message now in a bride I mean and as this bride eats the book I mean like I said we become the word but the bride is of this age is coming to maturity I mean and we're getting a personal revelation of the same message that brother Branham got I mean and and brother Branham according to some of those testimonies he made the statement that he says I've got to get out of the way so that you can come up to where I am I mean God that you take now brother Andy I loved I just loved hell the more the Lord was preaching this morning through the songs and things already I was so rejoicing when I when I heard those things that it was a brother Hadley riff referred to I think it was he referred to the the wife sheaf Jesus was our wife she the firstborn of many brethren but in our die also I believe it would be al-qaeda to say that we've had a wave sheaf brother branham was the first one in this die to count to come to this bride age if I can call it maturity I mean but we he came to he lives that example I mean but we're not trying to be like brother Burnham I mean we want to be like God we want his life with us I'm but he's the first wave sheaf that came to maturity in this age and there's a whole crop to follow I mean the wave sheaf was just the first one but by God's grace this whole crop that follows hallelujah so now this bride is supposed to come to exactly the same position I mean we can so easily say who is this Melchizedek well mecki mecki ascetic was day in 1963 1964 1965 whenever it was I mean and and and he turned his back to the to the congregation and so forth know that say Melchizedek is here I mean but same with that same person that same Christ that I mean he's in the process of descending I mean that same Christ is now living through a many men but bride and whereas in the time of Jesus I mean he was expressing himself through a virgin born vessel now he's expressing himself through redeemed vessels hallelujah and he is the message God is the message I mean he's the voice he's the life it's not of ourselves so I ask you this question and I've already answered that I know and I mean this is not as if this is new to you now but he's the bride the voice alongside like brother Branham yes and learn because we are the vessels but again the voice the true voice the true life I mean he's him behind us is that simon cassidy so who's the one that shouts and who's the one that is the voice and for that matter who is the one that that blows the trumpet I mean you see he said in 1 Thessalonians he said I will be Saint I will be same in a sharp voice trumpet brother branham axe is very very well-known statement can I have the next slide please three things happens a voice is a voice a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now shut Jesus does all three of them when he's descending in the process of dissension in his second coming in his second son of man coming put it this way I mean he does all three things he shouts he's the voice in the bride the voice of the Archangel and he blows the trumpet calls us back now when I ask you another question we read that portion about Lazarus when Jesus was standing there calling Lazarus out of the grave who was it was it Jesus well yes because Jesus is the name of God but I'm asking you really more specifically was it that man Jesus that was standing there no he did not have physical power in that frail body to be able to call Lazarus out of the grave it was the life of God that anointed that body that call letters out of the grave so I'll put it this way it was the voice behind the voice I mean like we're seeing in that Jubilee song I mean it's the voice behind the voice in the time of Jesus it was the voice of the behind the voice it wasn't the flesh part I mean it wasn't the flesh part that rosary Lazarus it was the god that indwelt that vessel I mean so now again I want to ask you this question I mean when the shot went for senior died like I said was it brother Bram was it the little Kentuckian yes and no but the reality is the the life behind it I mean the voice behind the voice that's what called us I mean hallelujah we have a voice behind the voice but we received it as a shout and I trust this is not going to confuse you I'll get to that in a little bit if you don't you should just hang on now now I'm gonna ask this doesn't it sound like I'm confusing the shout and the voice now I mean so I'm just gonna I just want to share a few things just to kind of place that a little bit but just be with me it was God's voice speaking at the time of Lazarus it was God's voice speaking through the prophet and it's now God's voice speaking again can I have the next slide we read the in Revelations thing and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar I mean II had cried seven thunders uttered their voices so now what's happening here is this is the shout this is the shot this is the son of man expressing through a son of man in 1963 the opening of the seven seals but yet it says voices because what's voice is God speaking I mean it's God's voice is God's Word this expression of God's will so now when brother Branham was speaking it wasn't him speaking as a man it was God speaking we were hearing God's voice we were hearing the heavenly angel speaking through that vessel and that verse when it speaks of like I said when it speaks of that seven thunders uttered a voices it was God's mystery behind the things that was actually just spoken through a voice of a vessel there was a voice behind the shout and the voice was God speaking is that clear enough I trust that that's very simple so now when I also read a second part of a quote I had earlier I'm just going to quickly run through the first part the same voice that summoned John come up it's the same voice that all summons to church Sunday is the same voice as summons did Lazarus so then he sees Christ is the voice of the Archangel now remember Christ is the mystery of God reveal him he's anointing his word his life is descending but he is the life behind it I mean with hallelujah we are now mrs. Jesus Christ when we get in that union with him and he is the voice the power the life behind the name is that song he's the life behind the name I mean it's the life behind the name I mean it's his life behind us and we are now mrs. Jesus Christ we bury same name and it's the same life behind us I mean it's the same voice of the resurrection that's expressed through us now I mean so then what about the voice paths I mean we've spoken about the shell so now that same Christ is now living in a mini man but bride I mean and and and brother branham at that reason and he and he and he spoke about I'll write this trial once more I'll write this trail once more now now we did we write it in our generation he wrote it through the Prophet he wrote it through the shout part but the same life that same person that same God he's now writing this trial now in the bride he's here that same voice that same word is now expressing himself I mean now through a mini man but bride this time through redeemed vessels I mean how can we be worthy how can we ever be worthy how can we ever offer our vessels to God if it was not for the blood of the Lamb I mean if he did not cross the breach that's why we need a breach before we can have I mean the seals revealed where he needed to cross the bridge in order to be able to make the path open so that we could become one with him we could never cross that bridge from outside we could never merit anything we could never offer him anything we could never bribe him we could never convince him we could never meet him halfway he provided everything he crossed the breach I mean and he made the way I mean we were just in caught up in church ages man ages and so forth but he made the way to bring us into the ego age hallelujah he is now reflecting himself through mini redeem vessel vessels now the same voice I mean like I said the same God that expressed himself through the shaft he's now the voice behind this list behind this voice behind our voices so now I want to ask you another question he's the shout pass things brother Brahim is deep that vessel is gone and I know this is a trick question the shout is the voice calling out to a bride the shout is the ill either call the shout is go find a wife now these members of the bride that hasn't heard the shout yet but they not mostly that it's sometimes happen but most of them don't just go onto internet and randomly start listening to brother bands messages and hear through thee most of the time they hear through you through me and when you speak to them as a member of the bride they are hearing the shaft they are hearing the ill either call you understand what I'm saying so this is not trying to bring some weird new doctrine and confusing shout voice trumpet but what I'm saying to you is the process of us receiving the call is the sharp the process of of him revealing to to us who he is is the seer is the shot what God is doing this morning through the ministry he's shouting he's revealing who he is but first part I mean of the three fault purpose and when you now go home and you and you think about these things and those things become alive in your life then you become the voice then you become the shout again for the next person I mean that's the whole process of disciple I mean we everyone come up to maturity and then is able to pass on the seed again I mean because we come into that side process so to answer my own question I mean the shot is not past I mean it's still shouting it's still calling I mean and I believe it will continue to come until the last one is in hallelujah the shot is not limited to books and types the shot is not limited I mean to do a stack of mp3s or a SD card the shot is not limited to that God is shouting and he's shouting through you and sometimes without you opening your mouth he shouts I mean sometimes why someone just looking at your life they become thirsty your life is speaking louder than your words sometimes I mean that's still shouting god is still shouting and what is it that shouting is not yuge not the vessel I mean it's God's a God that's living through the vessel is God that's manifesting himself through the vessel it's God getting preeminence in the vessel which is what the whole point of the second purpose I mean we received the shot but God comes and he gets preeminence in us hallelujah I mean and he becomes the boss brother and speaks so beautifully in that Christ is the mystery any any mic statements about about Paul the prisoner that's all under the shout path where we become completely subject to him and I'll just throw this in as a as a side comment many times we've suffered under under under hard hit chips and different things and naturally speaking we have a fear or a frustration or a complex or hurts associated with each other but headship is so crucial to our Christian walk because part of the show part of this voice process part of the second part of the three fold purpose is ask becoming completely subject to his nature hallelujah I just leave that day what's the purpose of the voice in the time of Lazarus the voice called him from the grave it awakened him in this day can I have that next quote please before the message calls the bride together see the shout and the at the same one he with a loud voice he screamed at with a shout and a voice and well as arose with a loud voice he cried Lazarus come forth and the voice wakes up the sleeping bride the sleeping did I mean it reminds you of that parable of the five foolish and the five wise virgins I mean and you know what they all heard the shout I all heard the message but only five of them had oil in the lamps only five of them had the complete rebirth experience only five of them was filled with the Holy Ghost part of that process so now these various avenues where I can go from here and I just want to focus on one particular direction some that is called wake up to this revelation I mean this is it this is what I've been waiting for this is what I've been made for I'm an eagle I've always been made to be an eagle and others might just see it as better doctrine a better explanation of the of the Bible a group of nice people or whatever it is and never become that voice hallelujah some wakes up to the revelation oh no I'm undone I don't have what I thought I did that voice goes forth to wake they brought up hallelujah and the voice I believe the purpose of the voice is to wake us up to the fact that the rapture is on the rapture broses is on the mere fact that the shot went forth showed the rapture is on the rapturing process if the stumbles you if I say the rep cheese on hallelujah now I'm just I'm just like bring these things please forgive me I'll just I'll just be myself but I'll ask again the shaft God revealing himself to his bride does God only use brother branham to do that no he doesn't he uses all sorts of vessels today I love her brother Brennan put CD and I think I had that quote before I'm just gonna read that last part when God when Jesus stood there any cold Lazarus he said he answered year mi and he come from the dead after he was dead in his body rotten when you hear that you think of Isaiah standing in the temple I mean and when when he was touched with a coil of fire I mean he responded saying Here I am Lord seeing me I mean when that voice of the Archangel really touches you I mean you really personally become a carrier of the light I mean you get the Commission not only brother Branham had a commission every member of the bride has a commission because what we carriers of the world we carriers of the most important possible thing that can ever be on this earth I mean hallelujah you might not be able to preach like I said but you can shine your light you can shine your lamp you can testify I mean and people around you can be thirsty because of the life you live before you we have bright bringing forth bright by the life of Christ being reflected through members of the bride amen and we are just carriers of that same seed the Bible speaks in revelation about that voice of many waters and brother Ramses is the voice of ministers and and preachers and so forth I mean how he's revealing himself through those through all those different vessels and through the fivefold ministry and so forth but I want to say this morning brothers and the voice of many waters doesn't stop with a fivefold ministry I mean the voice of many waters is the same voice it's the same resurrection I mean it's the same life it's the same weight and that where his experiences expressed through the whole body I mean the whole purpose was that the voice would express himself through us as we become scum as we become completely subject to him now I'm just gonna have me in for a moment I trusted you some of you are struggling I see tiredness of the week in kicking him but I trust that most of you can can kind of stay with me so I'm just gonna hone in a little bit on that voice bath and and this is we we practical day-to-day life application comes in how does God get preeminence in his bride well I can see it we had a wave sheaf in the other day how did he get preeminence in the Prophet God said to him go out on the mission field mother-in-law said no the Prophet listened to mother-in-law and suffered heavily brother Branham even make my statements lighter in his life he said that some of the some of the illnesses and things he suffered is perhaps because he didn't listen to God that first time when he called me Safford and we can think God is unfair God so God is not unfair God was doing something very spacial the tea in the hand of Jehovah was doing something in that prophets life I mean and then you then you see how it becomes a lot more subject to God can you see what's happening here I mean he's being submitting now I mean so now brother Branham has his own voice experience where he himself has to come become subject to the voice that God is even speaking through him I mean he's gotta as a person subject himself completely to the world and then he goes to South Africa and God says to him this is how you do it and this is how you do it and those guys stand against him and even his closest friend turns against him inside to umbrella banham I think uses eyes and think you honestly wrong those guys say to him does the angel only speak to you but God had told him what was God doing it was preparing a vessel that's completely subject and brother branham when you read it I feel so sorry for him because it was really cool he tried everything naturally possible to stand for the right thing and I just didn't give him an option and he suffered for it why because God was preparing him for a third pool and God had him had to have him completely subject to himself in order to give that complete open word through him so what was God doing in the hand of Jehovah preparing him to use him as a vessel that's how God always does it in the voice path of your walk hallelujah even when God gave him that that vision of the fishing and so forth God seek Him you always try to explain you get you the lines dangle that God at you till the last minute I mean pull those things out of the Prophet so that why he would do what the angel places on his heart to do no matter what mother-in-law sees no matter who the what who says God must be the boss God must be the head that's the process of the voice the second part of the three fold purpose trust you're still with me on those things so now when God put that vessel through all those trials what was the result a subjected vessel and vessel hallelujah and I trust you will recognize this that knows what he wants done with his word but will have thus saith the Lord or she will keep still and I'm speaking she because I'm speaking about us of course I mean the width that garden in brother Branham was to mature that vessel so that he could Thunder forth the word through him I mean so that he could have thus saith the Lord and that brother branham being the wife she fan out I could show us the example of what God wants to do to us I mean we God wants us to become completely subject hallelujah the work that God is doing in our lives is a work in the soul that's the main focus a work way by his perfecting our character because our character is all that we get to take with us when we get out of here so we need trials and peace you know when we read in the Bible how suffering for a little while is more than gold and all those things in the Bible naturally speaking we think doesn't make sense naturally speaking we think do we really need that but it is more than gold it is the best thing possible for us in fact I will go as far as to say and I hopefully will get you to some of those things this life was not made to be easy God did not put us on this earth and I'm not saying this sarcastically or to look down on anyone but God did not put us here on earth to like the charismatic scam the big BMW and claim the big Mercedes and claim the big house that's rubbish that's completely out of God's plan I mean God did not put us to achieve all those big things God put us here to do what one sane character and that's in the soul I mean and God is willing that cheat in the hand of Jehovah who was willing to let 68 million martyrs be killed through the Dark Ages so that he could perfect his church that same God that allowed six million Jews to be killed so that he could bring them to their homeland so that he can reveal himself to the hundred forty four thousand that same God will three stain the hand mature us perfect us form us so that we can become just like the wife chief in our die is subject to his word completely so that the voice is now manifested and alive in this bride I mean now I just want to say this just niches think about the 68 million martyrs over the last 2,000 years can God closed the mouths of lions yes he did it for Daniel I mean can God quench the fire or protect from the fire he did it for the for the three in the in the fiery furnace by why didn't he for so many of those souls I will fade to the Lions I was sold into pieces they were burnt at the stipple that God loses power no of course not I mean God was allowing it sometimes we have this perception that if we don't ask and God doesn't answer us immediately or we seek and it doesn't heal us immediately or God doesn't change our circumstances I mean that God is being unveiled that God is not true to his word or that we don't have enough faith or we start breaking our faith down and all sorts of stuff that's not real we need trials we need hardships we if we think of God is just a genie that we you know we wipe the bottle and he comes out yes I grant you three wishes okay what can I do for you today god I want to be healed I want to be rich I want car doesn't work that way we will never grow in God we will just become a stupid little nagging child that's from Tantrums God why didn't you give me my big Mystery's today I mean that makes us babies but when we ask God and we cry before God like the Prophet death and it doesn't give us our healing immediately I mean thing is when character is developed then it is when character comes we brother Branham says if I prayed for five hundred tonight and not one of them gets healed I will still preach divine healing in the morning because God is God and His Word is truth that's a mature sign a mature son is not the one that every time he he you know mom and dad is a credit card company every time I need something more just give me the card I mean that's not how God works can he do it yes of course and easy the same yesterday today and forever yes of course he is but it's the best possible thing for us if it doesn't just answer our prayers like that he needs to give us patience and all those things he needs to build us a and that's the only way he does it I mean he's for allowing all sorts of hardships to come across her path if we really look at it through God's eyes then we rejoice in our suffering then we get excited when God is allowing things to happen in our life because then we can say my my I wonder what this is going to achieve if we're honest with ourselves most of us can look back over our lives and think back at some of the hardest things we went through and we can say I came out to be the person I came out with some spiritual growth I came out stronger or I came out with more compassion for my brothers and sisters I mean it's so often that you see someone that's really judgmental and hard and other people and so forth and then God puts them through something and suddenly the whole attitude changes I mean we need that because in a human makeup we just self focused and we're just all prideful and we just want everything to work for me I mean the best for me but my god stop us from those things I wanted to I just want to take you even to Jesus Christ himself for a moment he now if you battle with the Garda this is gonna throw you but he needed to become so completely subject to the Father's will that he had to say I can do nothing until the father shows me first brother random hones in on how Jesus at that Pool of Bethesda stepped over many people that were perhaps more sick than when he prayed for but God sent him to that one and I thank God that I'm the one that he touched when the angel came by camy he sovereignly found the father's will and executed the father's will and if he just moved with human compassion I mean you and I because we care for people I mean we would like to heal everyone in the room clear up the whole pool of bethesda but he found the Father's will brother Aaron refers to her pool when that when that soothsayer was behind him everyday and harassing them and harassing them and one day God gave him permission and Dana cast the spirit yeah I mean but until that point God formed his character through it I mean my god help us to become so subject that we will take that same approach Jesus had to before he went to the cross I mean he prayed that pray that I always referred to father let this cup pass me that's what Jesus the word praying that the word will not be fulfilled he was the lamb he was the lamb that was prophesied from before the foundation of the world I mean in God's mind was already signed he was that lamb now and he was praying against the will of God but not my will a thy will be done that's how much that vessel had to subject himself to the world don't you think our vessels should do the same hallelujah and he prophesied and he said she will know what he once done with his word or she will keep still hey man I thank God for it brother Brad makes a statement this is so much promises today making made among Christian people so many ministers promise the people a false thing if you'll just come to Christ all your troubles is settled I tell you when you come to Christ they then begin hey how's this for sales talk praise God come to Christ so your troubles can begin but you see it's a path of growth and the end thereof is with him on the throne amen hallelujah this Christian Road is not a flower bit of ease it's a battle from the very hour you start until your spirit set free by death right so that's pretty blunt and pretty clear there's not a point were you gonna be poof free of all the trials on this side but there's gonna be a point but it's not on this side the mind battles that you're struggling with the struggles the pressures and so forth like good for you I mean but Antley those things crush you my God give you grace to grow through it become stronger through you are not on no picnic you're on a battleground hey I mean life was not meant to be easy I hope I haven't spoiled it for you but once we get to that place we recognize life was not mean to be easy and we stopped expecting that somehow some utopia will happen on this earth with life would suddenly become easy we can actually make peace with the fact that life is not easy and then it becomes easier because with my peace for the fact that life is easy it's not easy save me price of all I hope that doesn't confuse you now I'm just gonna bring this into the context now of the threefold purpose again it won't be too much longer so just just all along also like brother cadre I'm about to close so now in the three fold purpose now in that first purpose God reveals himself to the to the bride now the third purpose and I'm just gonna skip over the second purpose for a moment the kingdom is restored and we rule with him we reign with him you know we sit on the white throne during the why from judgment we're gonna rule the earth with him but brother banner makes a beautiful statement in the church age book that points directly then back to the second purpose and that is unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him unless there's a second purpose you don't get to the third purpose you know what Satan was offering Eve in the Garden of Eden Satan was offering Eve you can be like God you can be equal with him without subjecting yourself to the word first that's still Satan's way I mean Satan is in the emancipation of the woman and the in some answer patient of the children and emancipation of all sorts of stuff because he doesn't want he'd ship but God's Way is you come the threefold way I reveal myself to you you submit yourself completely and then I place you to rule with me I mean go back to that quote the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering so if you say hearing you thought well maybe God will pass me over on this one well there's only two choices you're gonna get character with suffering or no character without suffering so if you want the character if you want the state purpose if you wanna sit with him on the throne well it comes with a package praise the Lord and included in that package is suffering but the suffering is not to break up just like I say this is tender hand I'm just gonna start start over unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is a character simply he's never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift so again it's not something that you can buy from count down and buy top dollars for it's something that is hard work over a long period man without character control because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is for like I said if you come through the threefold purpose then when you get to the Trump part and you're taken back to Eden condition and you sit on the throne with him and so forth then you are ready to rule with him because why then you will know what he wants done with these words then you will not have your own ideas then even if everyone disagrees with you you do what God wants you to do that's it that's the big difference between the first and second pull focus and the third pull experience you see a first and second pull focus and an outsider's was with respect is God I'm see kill me God I'm struggling sorted out please but a third pull focus is character Eagle anointing is character God's eternal purpose for us is character you put up that mix Lloyd again well Graham's is a persecuted Church God called him persecuted God looked upon the persecutions now speaking to this murnian Church idea God looked upon the persecutions and gave them grace to bear it he looked upon his two relations and gave them victory over death looked upon their poverty and give them riches in him I mean he gave these spiritual blessings for the physical sufferings they had the Church of Smyrna passed through the fiery furnace of tribulations but was a sweet-smelling savior unto him so now as I start winding down now I'm gonna gonna speak about Lazarus a little bit I'm taking you back to that last verse again what I read in the opening scripture hmm when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth but you know when you read that when I read that this this time it it just jumped out at me as if he was saying release the spell he was saying unleash this mighty power it's like unleashing a racehorse you know when before they go before they let him out of those those pits or whatever they really and they place by throbbing to go and they ready to go and and it was as if God was saying two letters come forth I mean explode go forth I mean released the energy released the Bearer release the testimony and so forth and that testimony was unleashed on Galilee when Lazarus came forth and now and we don't have time to read it but we really bear hell there was a feast made and and Lazarus was invited to the feast and how the Pharisees and and the the leaders they wanted to kill Lazarus what did he do he was the evidence of the resurrection I mean do you think they're gonna love you I mean do you think they're gonna like to have you around I mean there was one day who had already tasted death but he cannot die again I mean spiritually speaking I mean he was already they was already resurrected and no matter what I said I could not disprove it because he had the experience that's what God brings every member of the bride to when God reveals himself to us what's he revealing he's revealing his attributes but it's not putting them down in a Sunday School class since I remember one of my attributes is to be Redeemer repeat after me Redeemer he's not saying it that way God is letting you fall and then experience Redemption God is letting you get sick and experience healing God is letting you get all stressed out and frustrated and then give you that peace then one thing you can say yes I believe you jehova sholom because I've experienced Jehovah Shalom I mean so we're gonna have a much better relationship than Eve head then Adam had because they were in perfect conditions God good say to Adam I am your healer and Adam would say whatever what do you want me to do here God but when he says to us I'm your healer we say yes God I know because I've experienced him you see why God allowed the fault to happen and where I go I gotta let all these things it was all part of his purpose because God needed to express those attributes by experience to this bride and Lazarus was wandering around and some people came just for the first and second pool wow he did a good trickier look at this guy he rose this guy from the dead that it changed their lives no I kind of wonder how many of those people who actually stole Asura's and alive after he died were perhaps part of those who cried the Hosanna and ended up being part of the same crowd I mean who say crucify him in our day it sounds like this well he did wainy many mighty miracles and yes he was a good man but he went off the rails in there that's what it sounds like they think the same of you and me yes there are good people they nice and they do nice stuff for you but hey something's wrong with him I mean of course they call the hare the master of the house Beelzebub how much more wise I mean many different approaches but the reality is for Lazarus it was real for Lazarus he had the experience no one could take it away anymore you see it wasn't Lazarus that they hated they hated the God that was able to do that I mean they hated the God that was proving that the life that he expressed to Lazarus showed up that they were lifeless that there was nothing lead that they just had formed but they just pretended but there were just a bunch of Pharisees who walking around trying to be more holy than the next one but they have no life behind the name they had no voice behind the voice they had no power of God manifested through them and I'm gonna say to you this brothers and sisters we sometimes tend to measure power of God by how many miracles God does every five minutes that's not how he works because Judas Iscariot came all the way through justification all the way through sanctification and under sanctification only he was able to do many mighty miracles mighty things the Devils were subject to him but he needed to go all the way to the rebirth and he couldn't because he was not a predestinated eagle but eagles will go all the way hey me they were brother Branham preaches souls that I imprisoned now and he speaks about how part of the third pole is to preach to these eternally lost how they were some people walking around on this earth who could never be alive eternally who were already in hell now so just people in prison now but you see there's a flipside to that these people walking around on this earth that can never die these people walking around on this earth with that voice of the Resurrection has become so one with him you can blow up at embalming their body you can blow this body to smithereens payme but they cannot die because they have eternal life in them they've become part of life the Living God has manifested himself through them and all you would do is do them a favor because that were just released him from the soul pictures hallelujah in closing I spoke about how that same voice of the Archangel is now expressing himself through this Brian and I want to say Lazarus come forth let the life in you speak let the life that was that was that has now become one with you be manifested to those around you that are still in need remember not everyone is the ego some people can only access the first and second pull through you but they some that will receive it as ego food they will be born and they will grow up and I will come in the same image and I will reflect the same guy Lazarus come forth it stand together wonder if I can ask him to these the musicians to come trust that this has been not been too much all over the place and that the Lord will just shake it all up and put it in the right direction in our you know hearts you know that song this old world can even hold me well we have won praise the Lord maybe you need to come help me sing does anybody else know the song you do

wedding garment that's all [Music] [Music] man hallelujah I trust you can save me here got my ticket in my hand I'm ready to leave my wedding garment on I mean I'm so thankful we're living in a resurrection our holy the same voice of called Lazarus how the grave has called you out of the grave we're alive forevermore you'll imagine that your Lazarus and you here you know they want to kill you the scribes and Pharisees want to kill you imagine that you just laugh you mean I get to go back to fellowshipping with with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Daniel all the believers there you mean I get to go back what do you just chuckle at that the other Devils postmen hate me I thoroughly enjoy that this morning thank you brother all right I think I'm thank you I just want to I just want to say one thing you know people people have come you know come and they've even spoken to me saying and how brother BAM he tells the story of the of the shepherd and he's got the little lamb that they're dead its leg was broken song comes along that says why how's the slim get a broken leg and the ship it's in I brokered sleep people are shocked what why would you break your own lamb's leg see well I sort straying it was going off doing its own thing so I had to do something to bring it back to me so our ladders think get broker then I can pull my love and show my care for now it's by my side the whole time people don't understand why God allows trials and hardship ma you know and people say how can a loving God allow such things to happen to us but it's amazing when you you know because when brother Brown tells a story like that it's in the scripture and you read Psalms 51 I won't read the whole song but this is some that David wrote when they when Nathan the prophet came unto him after he had gone and to best sheepish after Nathan win and said you're the man you know you're yo you took your eyes yo yo yo you killed your I took his wife you did all these things and then he would say he traded me a clean heart O God who knows that son but then he comes down to verse 8 he says make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice so he was he was he was tying exactly what heaven was worth with Bathsheba and his son died because the child died he said his parallel net with bones being broken to God allow that to happen that David would come back to God again so everything works for our good I mean he has our best interest in mind I mean so I think we can just rejoice I've had a cold wasn't a man calling me wasn't a church calling me as we heard it wasn't a Kentuckian calling me God came and called me he's called us to a high and holy calling on you glad you know brother Graham said about the widow woman there then Elijah went to the Gentile widow woman he said that she was the same caliber as the Prophet that's why he was sent to her this word has come to you because you're the same caliber as this word as our Lord Jesus you may not think yourself much but God he put your life a greater value than his own blood hallelujah amen see or think yo you are nothing I'm worthless no you're more valuable than this whole world you're more valuable than this whole universe to god you are so never ever let the devil think you're worthless you're not worthless you're very important to God that's why I've God sent
