God bless you thank you for the specials as well Brothers appreciate that amen hallelujah amen amen good to have everyone here this morning amen God bless you amen let's just turn to the scripture yeah I was wondering well I was I was sharing with the girls I think I shared this a few months well probably about six months ago now I guess time is kind of Blends all together but you know I was talking to Christine uh at work she was driving with the girls in the car and we're just talking I was walking in the car park talking to her and they were singing the song uh in Heavenly arm we enter the land and The Battle Belongs to the Lord just in the background and as I sing the spirit of the Lord just fell upon me and you know I was telling I was telling the girls this week I was saying you know we're a team it's not just me standing here and you're there you know we're in this together you know we can create an atmosphere you can create an atmosphere with your words you know with your singing that God can just come down and Inspire and you know and and I say that cuz we're a team yes sir you know it's not just me here preaching let's preach together today Hallelujah let's just let's just let's just get this thing over the line hallelujah hallelujah amen so God bless you all amen let's um let's go to Matthew chapter 26 um I've got a I pray the Lord just just bring this out brings this out just right yeah we on oh yes the first one's blank sorry um I had a battle with my I iPad this morning but here we are had to free some space up I said now you can't open this not enough free space I had to delete some things and I think I should just print things out and stay old school but anyway amen so we're going to read here then we're going to going to read a portion of uh scripture from John 12 as well it speaks of the same same event now when Jesus I just see if I can drive this yep okay now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial verely verely verely I say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also uh this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her amen now now now notice this then notice this word then after that event then one of the 12 called Judas a scarat went unto the chief priests and said unto them what will you give me and and I will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for 30 pieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to portray him amen let's just go to uh John 12 sorry to keep you standing but um we just got a few more scriptures to read amen John chapter 12 is everyone everyone there everyone happy today amen praise the Lord we're in the prin of our of our King amen we can just let the pressure off and just enjoy his presence and love him and amen John 12:1 then Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus uh was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead uh there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him then took Mary a pound of ointment of of Spike nard very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment then saith one of his disciples Judas a scarat Simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear that which uh was put therein then said Jesus let her alone against the day of my bearing hath she kept this for the poor always have uh ye have with you but me ye have not always amen so any want to have a need this morning you want to be remembered in prayer I just want to slip your hand up to the Lord gracious father you see the hands that have been raised Lord you see the needs that are behind those hands and Lord I have both hands up this morning I just ask dear God may you just come down as you Lord we just invite you to this meeting Lord we invite you to where we are into our hearts and we're just asking as you are our King you're not just our savior but our Lord so as our Lord may you just take the service under your control may take our lives Lord we willingly surrender them into your hands and I just pray dear God you see I have these slides these notes but Lord I just pray Lord You' it go beyond just slides and notes Lord that you would come and Inspire Lord and not just anoint the speaker but the hearer as well Lord we need you to anoint your word to our hearts oh God Lord that Lord it has to go beyond just human reasoning and understanding and hearing but Lord It's a spirit of Earth that hears the word and receives Lord into our lives so I pray Lord may you anoint speaker and hearer and Lord may you just be with us in a very personal way today be with those who are not here today Lord Jesus just pray you'd be mindful of them Father wherever they are Lord may be their portion today and Lord we just want to pray Lord as we have sung what a powerful name it is your name the name above all names the name of Lord Jesus Christ Lord I pray you just manifest yourself in our midst for your glory Lord we have come not to see one another but we've come to see you so may we see you here today Lord may we lord we want to thank you we can worship you in spirit and in truth so Lord we just commit the service into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we ask Lord amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I want to um I want to talk about now I was kind of thinking about what I could um call this today um and I really was you because I I want to I want to uh contrast the heart of of Peter and Judas and it can be very you know easy I was thinking maybe just call it being corrected by the word but then the legalist would say amen for all the wrong reasons so I just want to speak on be a Peter never be a Judas now we have you know and then also I trust that no one brought their pitch folks today right all right bring the right tools here amen and that goes for YouTube land as well now I just want to make a few background comments before we go into what we've just read brother brandham says here um just like the word predestinate he says it's a bad word I used to um I used it a few minutes ago and I caught myself cuz I felt the spirit moved back many people don't believe in predestination predestination is a bad word it's really for knowledge God knows before who will and who won't so therefore he can predestinate by his for knowledge that's the reason he knows who will and who won't see he's not willing that any should perish but he knows who will perish if he wasn't I mean if he wasn't then he wasn't God he has to be omnipotent just the same as omnipresent see omniscient omnipresent omnipotent infinite he's infinite if he isn't he isn't God for he knows all things therefore he can tell the end from the beginning because he is the word so the Lord he's not willing that any should perish but he knows who will you say well how does that work God made man in such a way he doesn't go beyond our free moral agency he does not force us to receive him right he doesn't pressure anyone he doesn't he will never override anyone's free moral agency that to make them become a Believer we have to do that by our own choice but because God is God he can look through the streams of time and he can see who will receive him and who will not remember God is Not s back after he said let there be sun moon and stars and then he's watching things unfold saying I wonder if this will happen I wonder if that'll happen he knows what's going to happen right many times we because we can't see into the future we see well how's things going to work out he knows how it will work out but you see he so he knows who will receive him by his full knowledge and but he knows also those who won't but he's not willing that any should perish he he fed me so I need you to put this in mind because God doesn't make us Christians he knows we will choose him right so therefore he could put a seat of predestination there but he doesn't Force us we have to make our own choice now Judas had to make a choice Peter had to make a choice and it was out of what was in their heart they made that choice now so God does not override our free moral agency now if we could just go um we read you know we read there of the account of of of Mary coming in and an anointing Jesus for for his for his burial now if we could go back to you know those two accounts you know are the accounts of Jesus being anointed in the house of Simon the leper there in Bethany now if we were there if we could be transported back to that moment you know imagine if we were I think I was talking to brother Armand about this on Wednesday I'm not sure but imagine if we were if we lived in the um in the in the village of Bethany or the city whatever it was and we knew Lazarus we knew Mary we knew Martha and no doubt we had seen Jesus before because he had come through Bethany before no doubt we had seen him preach we'd seen him you heal the sick and so on but then we hear Lazarus is sick maybe he's he's our next door neighbor and so maybe we would go and help and see how he is maybe we' take him meals and you know offer words of encouragement and you know just just just ask Mary Martha can we do anything to help you know alleviate the burden and they would say no doubt you know don't worry Jesus is on his way but then it seems like Jesus makes a delay in his coming and then finally Lazarus is is you know gets sicker and sicker then and then maybe in the middle of the night you hear a great Cry of Anguish come from the house Lazarus is dead and then you know we would go and comfort them and try and help with the burial and then we would we would go maybe and you know you know help with the burial we'd see lazarus's body maybe carried by his own brokenhearted sisters carried into the tomb and the stone would be rolled over the tomb and that was the end of it but then we know Jesus is never late and and you know and 4 days he may seem late on our timing but his timing is always on time amen so you know we would be there and we'd support them the best we can then we hear Jesus is on his way and then finally Jesus Jesus would come and you know he would come to town and maybe we would follow follow him and you know follow him and the disciples to the tomb to see what you know to see what would happen you know we think maybe he's just gone to you know he raised you know he did many mighty things but he couldn't this case was too hard there's no case too hard amen there's no case too hard for you know for our Lord so so he would go to the tomb we think maybe he'll just maybe you know give a give a tribute to his friend and you know but he would stand there and he would he would pray out loud and say father I thank you that I wasn't here when Lazarus was sick basically I'm just I'm just ad liing but you can go read it he says father I thank you you hear my prayers and I'm just here to basically say that that that that the people would know that you have sent me and you hear what I call for and then he would tell Mary and Martha roll the stone away and they would say but Lord he stinketh it's 4 days he said roll it away and they' roll it away and then he would say those words Lazarus come forth and then a man who was rotten four days in the grave came forth healthy well and strong what an incredible moment that would be maybe we weren't at the tomb but the next morning we see Lazarus maybe you know go for a walk to the corner Dairy and say what H but you were dead I was dead but now I'm alive why cuz Jesus is in town Hallelujah you know and then maybe we could as you know as we're maybe joining the procession there maybe we would we would Fallen among the disciples and we'd begin to talk to them cuz you know we' just seen something that never happened before never happened before in the history of the world and Man four days in the grave you know by then the body's already rotting away but he came healthy strong and well out of the Grave alive and maybe we would begin to talk to them and you know we would maybe maybe we would be walking with Judas and Peter and as we walked with them they would they would cuz we we've only seen a little bit of Jesus's Ministry but they've been walking with him the whole time and you know no doubt they would you know begin to testify of you know Legion being delivered Hallelujah thousand Devils out of him and you know seeing the swine run into the sea and all those things or maybe maybe coming to the woman at the well and you know Jesus was already speaking to her and you know we didn't really know what was going on there cuz she's a Samaritan and he's a Jew but they're talking and but but she she drops her water pot runs into the city says come see a man that told me all I ever did is this not the very Messiah and you know maybe or maybe they would talk about you know we were we were crossing the Sea of Galilee and a big storm was whooping up and you know we thought we could handle it being Sailors Sailors but then we realized we can't handle the storm it got too big and we woke up the master and you know we and then he just stand up and say peace be still and a WI a did come hallelujah or maybe you know they would relate Jesus walking on the water and Peter would say I walked on the water too hallelujah or Jesus healing the lepers or Jesus you know turning the water into wine or Jesus raising D's daughter Jesus healing the blind the lame am mean feeding the thousands they would just go testimony after testimony after testimony and then it would become a bit more personal because they could no doubt talk about how in Matthew chapter 10 they were commissioned by the Lord to go and preach the gospel yeah and they are anointed to preach the gospel cast out Devils raised the Dead heal the sick and they would and they would begin to testify that the anointing they felt around him they felt it come on them and they went out two by two and they would you know and they' give their own testimony of God living in their lives or they would testify of going into the synagogue and Jesus would find Isaiah the scripture that was written about him about the spirit of laws upon me to bind up the Brokenhearted to to set at cab set at C set free the prisoners and you know those things you preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he'd say this day the scriptures fulfilled you know so they could they could testify of that they could also testify of hearing many Mysteries that were hidden from the foundation of the world you know Jesus would say to them in Matthew 13 the things the reason I speak to them in Parables and you plainly is because it's not know it's not for them to know but I'm going to tell you Mysteries so Judas knew the mysteries of the book he was part of the ministry he knew what it was like to be anointed he knew it was like to preach under inspiration he knew it was like to pray for people and they'd get well and he knew the mysteries of the word but yet even in that state there was something in his life that he was holding on to that he valued more highly above following and being corrected by the word of God and now after all that we're in Simon's house and we're sitting there and Here Comes Mary with this expensive ointment we read that it was very costly amen and she came and anointed the feet of Jesus wiped her his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment now she was inspired to do this the disciples didn't anoint her sorry the the disciples didn't anoint him for his burial she did but she didn't even understand what she was really doing but she was inspired to anoint the word for what it was about to accomplish even though she was not aware of the significance of what she was doing are you all following me I'm going to if we go slow let's just go for a walk okay you know but but I want this to sink in I pray now you say well how do you anoint the word well if we look back in the Old Testament they would take a king and they would anoint a king signifying he is now the king over the nation right and everyone we may not a physically poured the oil on his head but being there and being behind that King we're saying we anoint you King over this nation and Asing over this na you are my king right so to anoint the word amen we are actually signifying this word this Lord Jesus is our kingen hallelujah amen that's how we anoint the word for our day now and then also amen when the word is given we say Amen to the word you're actually taking ownership of that word by saying amen so be it or hallelujah amen so that's anointing the word see we need to you know the bride needs to anoint the word for what it's going to accomplish what's it going to accomplish a Rapture Hallelujah he doesn't need to go to Calvary he's already done that now he's come to take his bride away amen so this is the part of the word that's that we're in the process of fulfilling amen cuz we understand and know the Rapture cycle is already taking place hallelujah amen you see but her you know we read there that the odor of that you know when she broke that Alabaster Box and poured it on his feet that her you know that the smell of that filled the house hallah so her worship filled the house amen signifying you know that's not done in a corner but she wasn't worried what are these people going to think about it she just went and anointed the word hallelujah now it's it's amazing because even Jesus did not understand initially what she was doing now I have this here if we go back having a bit of a Sunday school lesson today welcome to Sunday school or welcome to Super youth or whatever you want to call it now it says here when Jesus understood it so he didn't initially understand what was going on but then then he understood it he fed me it says when he understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she has wrought a good work upon me for you have the poor with you always but me ye have not always for in that she has poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial so now I want you to notice the disciples aren't rejoicing here they are here's here's someone in their midst who has actually caught a revelation this is where he's going he had told them he's going to be crucified he's going to rais on the third day but here she was actually she had a revelation this is what's going on and then see Jesus understood it says then Jesus understood it now if I can find where I was so I want to I want to try and stay with the stay with my so it says then Jesus understood it now see Jesus even Jesus didn't understand it at first but it was after the criticism of her worship then Clarity came from the master himself see they were filled with they were filled with indignation what a bunch of waste what a bunch of what is this person what is she doing this is breaking all the cood this is breaking all the way you know this is wrong you know they were angry they were upset about what was going on they were criticizing her for what she was doing but notice after after the criticism came where are we see they had indignation saying what purpose is this waste what a waste of a song what a waste of why is this person doing this why are they praising God like this why are they running around the church why are they being like this why are they saying hallelujah what a waste effort so criticism came but then after the criticism came Clarity amen so criticism should bring Clarity Hallelujah see Clarity see criticism is its intent is to drag someone down amen we know New Zealand has a has a tall poppy syndrome spirit in this country basically you everyone wants to cut everyone down to be the same much like a bunch of Moine grass right but so so that's how it is so but criticisms intent is to drag you down to stop letting God live in your life see what if people you know people people get inspired they shout they dance they Rejoice under the anointing then someone comes along say oh this person yeah you did that again well it's it's trying to drag that person down to withdraw that God can't manifest himself in that way or or singing or you know playing an instrument whatever it might be but all criticism should do is Drive the believer closer to God and it brings Clarity that you're right on track remember Jesus brought Clarity no no this is not a way she did it for my burial she's done a good work in me and it's such a good work that wherever the gospel is preached it's going to be it's going to be spoken as a memorial of of what she did Hallelujah so you know see like like it's first you know see what does criticism do it drives us towards where the Lord is it drives us into his presence right see at first people can just come along to church because of the food or the people or because their parents come but if that person is sincere when someone makes fun of them or attacks them then they begin to seek the Lord and ask him Lord is this the right way and he will begin to make it more real in the scripture right he confirms his word amen it's like you know we are baptized according to the scripture we know we know we're in the end times according to the scripture we know we're in the Rapture cycle according to the scripture Jesus brings Clarity amen hallelujah see it's a classic example water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now I don't have it up here but if you read Matthew 28 you know Jesus didn't say now speak these words over someone when you immerse them in water I baptize you in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost no he said baptize in the name he didn't say repeat these words he said baptize them in the name and the name is the Lord Jesus Christ right so someone can come and criticize say your baptism what are you going on about this baptism there's nothing to it you know it doesn't matter how it is well Jesus said baptize in the name what it drives that criticism drives you into the scripture and it brings Clarity amen hallelujah so that's how that's how criticism should bring bring bring Clarity from the master himself now Jesus would say um brother brah would saying God's word calls for total separation from unbelief I know they stand criticism but if we wasn't criticized then there'd be something wrong the world always knows its own but as I've said that remember criticism on the account of the word of God Is On The Growing Pains of his grace hallelujah amen it shows that you have separated yourself to be a Christian to act like one to live like one to obey every commandment of God it's a Nazarite vow to separate to call h a call from God that separates you from the things of the world so it's only Growing Pains of his grace but it brings Clarity amen hallelujah amen amen now I want you to notice this wait am I on the right technology forgive me you're staying with me so far see they all said at such a waste and then after this after no the Lord said no no no no don't think that way this is actually a good thing she's done the word brought correction and this correction triggered Judas to start the cycle of the Betrayal all right all right amen now in indignation if I have it here I what see they they had indignation now indignation from the Greek it means to be greatly Afflicted in indignant to be much sure displeased to be moved with indignation so they just weren't a little bit annoyed they were greatly they were they were much sore displeased they were upset by what she was doing they weren't happy about it they weren't excited they were they were very upset now the Cambridge Dictionary says it it means anger about a situation that you think is wrong or not fair that's wrong she did that what a waste of money what a waste of you know maybe if Judas if he had seen her carrying the ointment before she Anointed The Lord Jesus he might have been starting to think how can I get hold of this that I can profit from it remember we read he's a thief so he has and now I've got it here but you know he he had a side hustle they call it today they had a side hustle going on while he was being a disciple and that side hustle was more important to him than following the word this is Judas this is is the heart of Judas now he was more interested in making money out of the thing and robbing people than actually following the word because if we want to follow the word you know if this word says no you're wrong on a certain thing I say forgive me Lord change my heart to match your word right that you know that's how we should be it shouldn't be you know we shouldn't get angry like Judas remember Judas had a choice yeah the Lord knew he would betray him but he had a choice he had to agree with that betrayal he had to agree with that thought for the devil to take him over and actually do what he did so he was much displeased because Mary he was so sore displeased that Mary anointed the word for what he was going to do next because it was hindering what he wanted to do while he was in the church he wanted to make money that resentment I'll call it spread to the rest of the disciples it's got to start somewhere you know an attitude or you know something among people there's a starting point amen there's an ending point too and that ending point is Deliverance by the Holy Ghost right but there's always got to be a starting point amen so so that resentment spread to the rest of the disciples so we must be very careful how we talk about anointed worship and anointed life anointed singing preaching praying and living the devil wants the gift we all have a gift right he wants the gift in our lives to stop operating if it's the gift of singing preaching praying saying amen being a living witness being an encouragement being a Sunday school teacher being a technician being a musician being a deacon being a trusty I'm just trying to cover everything there is in the body being a help being a government whatever it is he does not want that to operate amen so so how does he start how does he attempt to stop things like that happening it's by giving someone an attitude against that personen that's how it begins that's why you should never cut one another down never criticize one another we're here to build one another up we're going to take a Rapture together we're going to make it Hallelujah so we should encourage one another you can do it brother you can do it sister let's get across the line amen if God is for us who can be against us no one that's right so let's press hey if someone if God is for someone why would I want to come against that person I'd be the most fullest stupid blind person in the world for me to come against someone of God is for them because I'm not just coming against them I'm coming against God and who can beat him come nobody you know it used to be When We Were Young we'd say my daddy's bigger than your daddy my daddy will beat your daddy up you know my uncle's bigger than you you know my daddy is the biggest daddy Hallelujah he's already conquered hell death in the grave I believe that hallelujah amen so it started it starts by an attitude and how does that attitude spread it begins by snide offhand comments about someone that's how see he he had his side hustle going on who knows what a side hustle is yep so you have your main job that you do something on the side to make a bit of money that's a side hustle this is what he was doing he had a side hustle going on and that is what triggered him to make the choice of betraying Jesus was that when the word actually got in the way of what he really wanted to do which was to make money he had a choice is he going to keep being a thief or is he going to follow the word and he decided on silver and gold he decided on the wrong thing see the by Jesus saying no he did a good thing Judas begin to resent it because of what was in his heart now we read the uh we read the two accounts here in in Matthew and John CU Matthew just being under the lion anointing saying all the disciples had ignation and you know they said what a bunch of waste but then John under the eagle anointing could look deeper than what what was in spired to Matthew and he could look into the heart of Judas and he said the reason Judas said that is because he was a thief and didn't even care about the poor it's amazing God knows everything he looks beyond our maybe how we emphasize a certain thing to get a certain thing our our motive and you know our objective God looks right through it we can put on a front and say one thing but really meaning another thing to twist a person this way and God just looks all through that thing you know so we shouldn't play games with people's emotions play games with people's lives and no we just point them to the scripture and cage them along the way amen hallelujah now I'm just I'm just surmising or presuming but no doubt because Jesus I mean sorry Judas was a thief he was a thief before he was called by the Lord to be a disciple it was already in him when he was called you know we come with a lot of baggage we all come with a lot of baggage we all come with things but we're not meant to keep those things amen and that spirit in his life was really the thing that allowed the devil to open the door and him to use him to betray the Lord amen now if you allow me to have that kind of Liberty yes sir you'd say well this was all before Pentecost well Judas showed his colors before he went to Pentecost if he went to Pentecost he would have been a changed man I believe he would have been accepted because Jesus said father forgive them you know they don't know what they do and Paul would say if they really knew he was the Messiah they would never have betrayed the Prince of Life they would never have done it if he really knew that Jesus was the Messiah he would never have betrayed him imagine sitting there at the feast and you I've got it later but imagine there this is the last supper feast and then Jesus says one of you is going to betray me and then it's and then and then Peter because Peter's not close to where Jesus was we'll get to it later he asked John because John was like close there with Jesus he'd say John can you ask him who it is' and then and then well John asked Jesus and Jesus says well the one that I give the soap to that's the one going to betray me I'd stop eating right then I would sit like this for the rest of the evening I I'm done doesn't matter if I'm hungry doesn't matter if I haven't even touched that food I ain't re receiving nothing on that table wouldn't you be that way I am not betraying you Lord hallelujah but the thing is because the devil was already working in his heart he did it even though Jesus said exactly and you know you know it was it was John sitting here Jesus in the middle Judas on the other side of him so it wasn't like he was doubt well the table is actually a U-shaped table but it wasn't like he didn't hear what Jesus said oh Lord help us now he say that was before Pentecost this is where I was going now I can I can probably blank this that was before Pentecost now we have you say that was before Pentecost well if he went to Pentecost he would have become a changed man you know I've had a man say to me this is years ago that Pentecost when when the Holy Ghost fell at Pentecost everyone who is a believer in that geographical location automatically received the Holy Ghost I think that is such nonsense we all have to have our own Pentecost right we may you know we all have to have a supernatural experience amen many times and I say every time it's those parts in our hearts that we don't surrender to the Lord it's the reason people don't receive the Holy Ghost right now see if we're really sincere and seek him with all our heart he will show us what is in our lives stopping from the Lord taking completely over you know there's a man called Simon the Sorcerer in Acts chapter 8 and the thing is you know you know God you know he had great influence among the people of Samaria you know people would come to him and he would give potions and make lots of money out of them and do different things and but then Philip went down there and people were healed they delivered they got baptized name of the Lord they having great joy Hallelujah but then they but none of them had received the Holy Ghost it says in Acts 8 and8 and there was great joy in that City and there was a man who was a sorcerer who used to bewitch the people of Samaria sorry I don't have it up here and and he was giving out that he himself was some great one and then he saw what Philip was doing he even got baptized and became a Believer and then he saw Peter come down who had the keys to the kingdom and and and he laid his hands on the people and then they received the Holy Ghost but then Simon didn't believe it I mean I mean sorry didn't receive the Holy Ghost and he even went to Peter and said can I give you some money that you can give me this gift that I can receive the Holy Ghost see it's all about money-making schemes but his intentions were wrong cuz he wanted to basically go from a sorcerer to a Christian but be a sorcerer at the same time we can't multitask in these things you can't have two occupations it's either God or the devil which one you can't serve two masters the scripture tells us very plainly and it says in Acts 8:18 and when Simon saw that through laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money I'll pay you for this what's your price name your price I want to be able to do this but then Peter Peter said unto him he says Thou but Peter said unto him acts 8 and 20 but Peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou Hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money thou Hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of this thy wickedness now remember he was already a baptized believer he continued with Philip the scripture says if you go read it so he was he was a Believer walking with them but he hadn't given this part of his life up repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity so here he actually was you think about this here was a man who knew he wasn't right with God he didn't have the Holy Ghost like these others and he actually goes to an apostle who has a gift that actually can perceive what's in his heart he's actually tapping into a gift of God isn't that wonderful you know I was thinking you know many times over the years you know I've tapped into gifts of God in this church you know I go to brother kabin ask him about something and wisdom would just come I speak to brother ID or or or anyone even even my wife would just talk about things in wisdom would just come why cuz you tap into a gift of God hallelujah you know we got to really think about what's what's even among us even children you you can tap into something in your parents that God will inspire them to say something to you they might even be conscious of what's going on but you can tap into God by your right approach you see so he even approached you know Peter Peter E Peter now discerned that he was in the gal of buness and in the bond of iniquity so so Peter's basically saying Simon this is what in you but then Simon answered and said pray ye for to the Lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me so what's he saying the Lord chose Peter this is in you and Simon the sister is saying it's pray that it doesn't come into me so what's going on there Simon doesn't ackowledge he doesn't say yes that's how I am right now he just says that May these things not come into me into in the future so basically he was comfortable with the spirit that was in him are you all following Meen yeah right so so he he was actually yeah see yeah no no go back I'm glad they cook on the trigger they're big screens you can sleep behind but they're not sleeping can you put that back up see if perhaps the thought of th yep go go next one for I perceive that thou in the B Gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity this is your your current status Simon this is this is you right now next one go next one then answered Simon pray you to the Lord for me that none of these things which you have spoken come upon me they already were upon him he was functioning with these things in his life I don't know how many years it was but the problem is people can get so used to a demon power that they think it's them right so but but there's no record in the scripture of Simon ever getting free because he was comfortable living with that spirit I say Jesus help us help us help us Lord see we have to completely die out to ourselves right it's not trying to do better or trying to grow into it we have to completely lay their lay our whole lives on the altar our whole lives not just part of it not the convenient bits our whole life see a sacrifice cannot be consumed by the fire unless it's completely there amen hallelujah if we want the fire to fall what is that the Holy Ghost come into our lives we got to surrender everything we have you know there would be others that would profess to be Believers but they would just baptize Pharisees this is this is acts 15 there there came a whole stir up in the church you got to be circumcised you got to follow the law of Moses and then then you can become a Christian whole stir was stirring up and there was a group of them that were a sect of the Pharisees which believed Saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to and to command them to keep the law of Moses now my question is this is acts 15:5 my question is why are these people labeled as a group a sect of Pharisees which believed on Jesus why aren't they just Christians it's because they were still holding on to their old way of life like Simon was like Judas was and that thing was hindering their walk with God they couldn't go any further and you'll see that they were actually they held more dear to being a Pharisee then actually to the transforming power of Jesus Christ in the blood of the blood of the Lord why because they they were actually saying no no these Gentiles have to become like us first as Pharisees then they can become Christians but if they were truly born again if they truly transformed by the Holy Ghost they wouldn't they wouldn't be talking about being a Pharisee keeping the law right but the but their old life became more important to them than actually being transformed see and this didn't help the work of the Lord none and it's because they brought their old ways with them they had not died out to them they thought that being in the the message of the hour was just a tack on to what they already had that was the message of the hour in that day but they thought it was just a tack on but the tack on was not important as what they had already are we all following are we are you all with me we can't we can't bring our old life in it's got to die our our first nature you can't bring it in it's got to be dead and buried not just hung up for a future time it's got to be dead and buried amen hallelujah yes amen it became more important to to them being a Pharisee or making little Pharisee Christians then actually the people becoming a new creature in Christ because the Apostle Paul he was a faracy of the Pharisees but he didn't say oh you got to follow the law of Moses and become a Christian no you just got to meet him and the church said amen we're not a bunch of Pharisees this is not following a law amen you be we become new creatures in Christ Hallelujah and he comes and becomes the the Christian in us I'm really you wow okay see Judas could not in his mind work out how he could get out of fixing what he had done and he went and hung himself Peter we'll get to it Peter was was in the same bracket in terms of he denied the Lord three times he thought how on Earth can I fix this yes but he couldn't he he didn't go out of the presence of the Lord he went into the presence of the Lord that Judas when and betrayed now they already knew now I just I just want you think how crazy people can get my question is what did he think would happen to Jesus when he betrayed him this was back in John 7 so I don't know you know this is before John 12 after these things Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk in jeury because the Jews sought to kill him so they knew he was going to kill him so then what was going through through J judas's mind when he went say well I'm going to betray the Lord but you know the devil never will ever show us the circumstan or or the or the consequences of what we do now this is this is in John 13 sorry if you know we're just going through this now before the Feast of Passover so remember Judas has been corrected by the word and he's resented it and now he's got and then straight after he was corrected he went to the chief priest to betray the Lord now before the Feast of Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own where which were in the world he loved them until the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him so now this is what resentment can do yes it opens a door for the devil to put a thought in so so the devil put in judas's heart go betray this man he had to agree with that thought right he had to consciously agree with that thought now this offense opened the door to the devil to put in his mind to sell out the word now maybe maybe Judas would begin to think in his mind I don't understand Jesus here's Mary breaks pretty much every rule in the cood and he says she has done a good thing and we could have really helped the poor with that money this man just doesn't you know he's he's so caught up in what about the Natural Things what about helping the poor you know he's kind of I think he's missing the point remember remember Jesus Jesus was a man but he never mistreated anyone in his life cuz there's no Mark against him so it's not like you know Jesus God In the Flesh and did this he did no no he always did things exactly right so there's nothing that Jesus actually did towards Judas that Judas could have said no no no I'm justified in my actions but it was his resentment because he held on to being a thief more than being a disciple which caused these things to happen see we could have really helped the poor with that money and myself of course well I do all this work carrying the money and keeping tabs so yeah I think I should be able to have a five finger discount from time to time you know just to keep things you know keep things running and you know he seems like he just has lost his vision he's so so shortsighted and you know maybe begin to think that way but we know the Lord knows where everything is he would speak to Peter one day when when they needed tribute money he said go fishing the first fish you catch open its mouth there'll be a coin in there go pay the tribute with that so he knew exactly where everything was but see the devil had put it in in in judas's heart this thought to go betray Jesus see we got to be careful what thoughts we entertain yes we got to be very careful what thoughts we entertain and then he tells he tells his disciples one of you is going to betray me but notice none of the none of the disciples see and then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake so when he said these words one of you is going to betray me they didn't all say it's Judas they had no idea this is how close remember this is the believer in the make believer so close together that you can't it's very hard to tell before Pentecost who's the real deal amen and so they didn't say it's him oh obviously it's Judas no they had no idea who it was going to be and you know I think it's incredible you think here's here's Judas he has seen Jesus discern Hearts before yeah the woman of the Well's heart many others he seen that happen and then he goes to the see this is how blinding the devil gets he goes to the scribes and Pharisees he arranges the whole thing and then he walks back into church as if nothing happened you think Jesus couldn't look through that I say Jesus knows all about everything now but Peter had a few marks against his name so I've talked a bit about the heart of Judas now we're going to talk about the heart of Peter I said be a Peter never be a Judas now Peter had a few marks against his name even even even when Jesus called the discip deciples he said don't you know I've called you 12 chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil so this is already hanging over them he called one of us a deal oh boy and then after after this Peter would Jesus would ask his disciples who do men say that I am yeah and then you know he you know he would say well they say that you're one of the prophets Isaiah Jeremiah or one of the prophets but then Jesus would ask but who do you say that I am and then he would say well Thou Art the Christ Simon Peter would say thou art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock I'll build my church The revelation of who Jesus Christ is I'll build my church upon that rock but then Jesus immediately after that begin to tell his disciples how he would be crucified raised again on the third day but then Peter after he received this Revelation that Jesus was the Christ he began to rebuke Jesus saying no no no far be it from the Lord that this shall be unto thee in other words Lord you're not going to be crucified this is not going to happen but then notice Jesus would turn to him and say unto Peter get thee behind me Satan for thou art an offense unto me for thou savest not the things that be of God but those that be of men now we know that he's not calling Peter Satan but he's identifying the inspiration that's speaking through Peter a few minutes before this it was God speaking through through Peter thou artart the Christ the son of the Living God Nick minute when Jesus begins to say about what he had to accomplish and and Peter's actually rebuffing him saying no no you're not going to do this he see he could not understand how God could suffer in the flesh and die for Humanity and so but this was because Satan doesn't sure he sure doesn't understand that himself and so he was inspiring Peter to actually say Lord you're not going to do this and so when he said get thee behind me Satan he was identifying the inspiration of the spirit that was upon Peter so here's Peter he's already be called Satan and Jesus said one of you is a devil and then and he says one of you is going to betray me so how do you think he's sitting right there and then after Jesus Jesus said to said to um them you're going to betray me so there was there was a disciple that was leaning on see none of them knew it was Judas none of them realized it was him and even even in the Inner Circle there at the Last Supper it was Jesus John and Judas sitting there and then so Simon Peter actually had to go ask ask him and say ask John can you find out who it is and then he says you're it's the one that you dips dips the so will be the next one and then of course immediately I would have stopped eating but he gives the soop he gave it to judas's and then um Jesus answered it is he to whom I give a so when I have dipped it and when he had dipped the soap he gave it to Judas scariot now imagine if Jesus just said these words he says it's the one I give the soap to I'm sitting on my hands but Judas because the devil had put it in his mind to betray the Lord took it and then when he took it then Satan entered into him and then he became an instrument to do Satan's will and then he went what thou doest do quickly and then he went out and the disciples didn't even know what was going on now in this time it's amazing because after I don't have it here but after um Judas leaves then Jesus says to his disciples now I give you a new commandment that you love one another and by this all men shall know that you are my disciples because you love one another so I could say hatred had to leave the room in order for him to say now now this is actually something I can't tell everyone but now I've ordained you to love one another love one another with the love of God Amen not everyone can do that oh Lord give us the Holy Ghost so we can love one another and then Simon Peter would actually say to Jesus wherever you go I'm going to go with you I'll come die with you and he says no no you're going to deny me three times so Simon Simon had a heart he miserably failed just like Judas miserably failed but he didn't betray the Lord but when when the Lord really needed him in his great trial he couldn't stand that's the same thing with any believer without the Holy Ghost you can't stand the pressure of the age but with him we can un we can we can withstand all things so so Jesus says to him before the crows three times I mean the shall not Crow till thou Hast denied me Thrice and Peter never says oh Lord may I not have to go through this no in his mind you know sometimes when people don't answer this saying I don't agree with you so basically he's saying to to the Lord I don't I don't believe what you just told me and here's someone who can look into the future and into the past he knows exactly what's going to happen and he's seen it go he told them go into the village there's a cult there go get it when when you go to untie the the owner will come out and say what are you doing he says well the master has need of this and you'll bring it here and so he's already lived out a vision before and then so the the Lord is telling him this and basically he's saying by not answering I don't believe you this is intellectual Faith instead of actually falling on the Rock and saying Lord help me forgive me Lord take my pride out of my life that I think I can stand on my Humanity this this this big Burly fisherman he basically said no I won't deny you and then the pressure came on we know the rest of the story don't we Jesus was betrayed he was taken Peter went Peter went with them was was warming himself by the fire and then as just servants come along women came along different ones aren't you a Galilean aren't you aren't you one of his disciples he says no I don't know the man totally denied him three times publicly and then and then then in one part of the gospels after the crowed or just before Jesus looked him in the eyes and then he went out weeping bitterly so here we are we have a man who has betrayed the Lord and he knows he is he has betrayed innocent blood and we have a man who said he would not deny the Lord and he's denied the Lord one of them had pride in his heart that he was the best the biggest and the brightest Peter that he's going to stand when the Lord really needs him and he fails miserably he's been called a devil you know he's been you know well you know he Jesus has identified the inspiration that that that is en through him here's Judas who no one would have thought would have been the betrayer betrays him because he'd rather be a thief than a disciple and so now he really brings out what's in the heart of man because on one hand they both needed forgiveness of what what they did they both needed it right and so one one it actually he left the presence of the Lord and he never came back Judas what left the presence of the Lord he didn't know he was forgiven but he just knew if I could just get back to where the master is hallelujah I don't know if I'll be received but I'm going anyway amen that's a that's a real believer to me Hallelujah in spite of failure fluster disappointment whatever it may be they say if I can just get into the presence of God hallelujah I don't know if I'll be receive but I'm coming anyway hallelujah amen see it's what a crushing disappointment it must have been for the disciples it must have been such a such a disappointment they would never have thought imagine he just Rose Lazarus from the grave how could this man ever die and here he is taken away by you know by the soldiers different things and and and he doesn't even really say a word and he's hanging there on Calvary now he's in a tomb the their whole world just falls apart what a crushing disappointment for the apostles they had seen their savior the one they had loved they had seen him even raise up the Dead from the grave they had seen him do that and then they think here he lays cold in the grave himself this morning those people who had seen him Open the Eyes of the blind seen him stand there perceive the very thoughts that was in the people's hearts how did he know that'd say uh that them was coming after him how did he know why didn't he know Judas Judas betray him see he knew it why didn't he know the soldiers were coming up the mountain mountains there with starves and and and swords and everything to get him if he could perceive their thoughts see the devil was working on them putting them on an as sheep see if we go through hard times we need those hard times sometimes maybe the lord always brings out everything for his glory but Peter had to go on an as sheep because God had to mold him in order for him to be the spokesman Acts chapter 2 he thought he had the goods but he didn't have the goods but the thing is the Lord you know we can utterly fail but the Lord isn't going to leave us in our utter failure amen amen amen he's not going to leave us just just in that state if we have a heart of Lord I want to get back into your presence Lord oh I'm wrong I know I'm wrong and you know maybe you don't know the way out but Lord I want to get back see Peter wanted to get back into his presence his actions proved it Hallelujah and and we'll get to that soon see the devil was working on them putting them on an ash sheep for they wanted to give them a testimony of I know see they had to know that their redeemer lived see not guess or perhaps it's so I know I know and remember those trials are brought upon you the same way so that you'll not say well maybe this is right maybe the scripture is true maybe Divine Healing is right maybe the Holy Ghost is right but when you get that experience and come off that Ash Heap and you get the revelation of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can scream I know my redeemer liveth because he lives in me Hallelujah see see that cures everything in life that really cures everything in life we don't need seven steps to become a better person you just we need more of God we just need more of his presence in our lives Hallelujah that takes all the fussing all the trouble all the anxiety all the whatever it may be it takes it out amen who's had that experience Hallelujah see Peter got to a stage where he said I'll just go fishing because he was a fisherman I'm just going to go back to all my old life of course he was a leader the disciples said well we'll just go with you and they went fishing all night remember they knew you think well at least I can fish at least I can do something you know and then they fish all night they throw the net out and you can feel when you got something there's a tug or a weight you know pull it up it feels the same throw it out again nothing rinse and repeat all night and your hope begins to fade because the thing you thought you were you can't do no more not a single fish nothing all night but then as the dawn breaks remember his Mercy a new Every Morning his mercies a new Every Morning Hallelujah they don't get old they don't get St they new every morning at the breaking of that Dawn they saw a figure standing on the on the bank and he cried out children do you have any fish do you think they would have been happy in their response no we don't have nothing Hallelujah that would have been grumpy you know no no we got nothing all night Nole fish I thought I was a fisherman I really did I really thought I could fish I had the skill I had everything and nothing oh and then they hear a cry throw your net on the other side the other side we've tried that the other side okay and they throw it out immediately it was full Hallelujah and then John who could maybe see a bit better than Peter said to said to Peter it's the Lord now here he is he's a man who feels so condemned he wept bitterly because he denied the Lord three times he was broken inside he went tried to go back to his old life that failed and now here's the resurrected Lord remember it's a new day Hallelujah and then John says it's the Lord now here's a believer's heart he's Broken Hallelujah he can't do nothing to get off the Z sheep but something in him just says I got to get to where he is I don't want to stay in this boat I got to get got to get to where he's at Hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and I oh I failed but I just got to get to where he is if I can just get into his presence one more time Hallelujah everything will be fine Hallelujah so he puts on his fishing coat swims swims to the shore he has no idea what the Lord's going to say to him but he just comes up gets there before the rest of them hauling in these fish and he sits there by by the fire and then the Lord begins to talk to him what do you think he's going to say Peter didn't know what he's going to say he say brother Ben I've heard these stories over and over again well I just pray it would live today right and he would he would sit there and and then and then Jesus would speak to him Peter do you love me thousand emotions would flood through his being you know I love you feed my sheep Peter do you love me Lord you know I love you feed my lambs and then he and then he would say a third time you think this would kind of grade on the soul a bit and then he says Lord you know I love you Hallelujah he says well when you're converted strengthen the Brethren amen see this is what we need this is what really takes all the deviation out of our walk when we're really converted yes not not not mentally being tied to a word right not mentally being tied to a word but the but the God who gave the word comes and lives on the inside of the inside of us and that word we just find ourselves living by that word because he's in the inside of the inside of us there's no deviation when that happens hallelujah hallelujah you know a burden is something we need yeah when someone to me really meets the Lord they get a burden amen they get a burden for for one another yes sir they get a burden to see God live and they put that burden before anything else Hallelujah they put that burden before anything else they have a burden for the Youth amen they have a burden for the old people they have a burden for the children they have a burden for every and in between they have a burden Hallelujah isn't that right we had we had you know I think brother Isaac said here when it was he says you know we were the super youth I'm just deviating but here we deviate you know we were the super youth when we started the church and we were the super youth when we started the church we were we were the super youth age but we just had a burden amen that's not how is this going to happen we just had a burden Hallelujah and that was the thing Peter had a had a burden I just got to get into his presence amen hallelujah some of you are looking at me like what are you talking about it changes the world it changed Peter's world just to get into the presence of the Master One More Time hallelujah hallelujah and all of a sudden they looked over on the bank just the same kind of Revelation that job got there they seen that job seen 4,000 years before there stood the Redeemer alive and fresh standing on the bank with a Fire Maiden fish cooked on it like that and said invited them Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed he invites his chosen people come and dine with his Mana he do feed and supplies our every need oh was sweet to S with Jesus all the time come and die the master cth come and die you may Feast at jesus' table all the time Hallelujah so there's the two hearts Judas because he held on to his old life more than walking with the Lord it made him betray the Lord he was corrected he was corrected like the other disciples but the other disciples actually forsook all see we can physically forsake all but what's in here see it's the things in here we need to forsake that are not of the word if it's contrary to the word some little private thing to try manipulate and do do your own sign hustle that's got to die am that's a thing that hinders people from actually walking more with the Lord amen yeah but they all they're all corrected by the same Lord Jesus but because of that Judas went and decided to do what he did but also because the others had a real heart of a Believer like Peter even though he miserably failed he if I could just get into the presence of God I know all will be fine even though as I say he did not know how he would be received I just I'm just going to finish with this and the only thing we have to do is to know he is here is get yourself out of the way see as long as you're in the way then God cannot do nothing for you when you think your thoughts then God's thoughts don't have a chance his thoughts are his word we know amen but if you'll quit thinking your thoughts and think think his thoughts my thoughts are not your thoughts he said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things not what some church is going to say about it but what God said about it like this little lady laying here shaking in this cot that uh that woman is going to lay like that all of her life unless she can get her faith set straight on Jesus Christ and no matter what goes uh comes or goes it be revealed to her then there is nothing going to stop the healing that's right but when you get your it's it depends on what you're thinking about if you'll just believe and have faith God can do anything for you and the greatest thing he can do for you tonight I'll say this morning is sweep your soul right back into the presence of his being right back there to where every person Hallelujah in here that's what he wants to do sweep ourselves back into the prin of his being Hallelujah but we just have to take him at his word you know Jesus said only believe only believe his promises don't bring anything into consideration but only take him at his word only believe and but what he wants to do is sweep our souls right back into the presence of his being just like Peter was swept back into the prince of is being there Hallelujah on that dawning of that new day and it changed his life he says just think oh sorry I don't have this one on here just think there's a continuation of that quote from Once More Lord 1963 in sh Port just think what if the Holy Ghost has had everybody in here completely in his control think of what would take place tonight think what would take place in sh Port by this time tomorrow night they would have headlines everywhere a bunch of people went crazy they were Healing The Sick raising the dead they're doing all kinds of things down in shreport Louisiana United States USA they'd have it on television of what they was doing if the Holy Ghost could take completely control why don't he he wants to he's willing to he's waiting well you say I'll ask him so many things I just hate to ask him too much ask abundance that your joy might be full you know if you're on God's side you better have big plans not small plans big plans big plans for his kingdom not to try and say what you want to do about it but you know we shouldn't limit God amen amen ask that you're ask an abundance that your Joys might be full Hallelujah so I just want to I just want to put it in your lap this morning whose heart do you have you have something in you that's more important than following the Lord you get rid of that thing amen you get rid of that thing right now I've got my plans forget your plans what about God's plans you say God line my plans up with your plans then it'll come out all right that's right Hallelujah he say well I failed him so many times Peter failed him in his crucial hour but he just got to Jesus hallu and everything was fine hallu Hallelujah can we have the musicians please this morning amen I want to sing in your presence that's where I belong in your presence I am strong amen let's stand let's stand this morning this may have been a different kind of a service but I'm glad I can have a heart like Peter you say well you called me at Judas today brother Ben you don't have to stay at Judas that's the power of the blood you know people people get offended oh he called me a Cain he called me a Judas a balam or whatever you don't have to stay that way Hallelujah there's a power there's a transforming power in his holy spirit that can change us from any other those things to be a saint of God hallelujah who wants to be in his presence that's where we belong isn't it not out of his presence he built us to live in his presence continually hallelujah amen let's start with the oh in your [Applause] presence that's where I am strong in your [Applause] prence
