booked in okay we'll take that one way or some way I don't know oh my okay amen let's go to the book we'll just leave that there shall we let's go to the Book of Psalms shall we this morning amen um so I want to speak on this morning I want to speak on rested fighting seated and walking I probably won't get to all of it today but we're going to start off with this amen so sounds like a contrary of our terms but we're doing all these things at once praise the Lord amen people say you can't multitask the believer can multitask amen that includes men especially amen Psalms 1 amen blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and his and in his law doth he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper they ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away amen then we're just going to go to um we're going to go to Psalms 231 well it's the whole Psalm amen and then and then we can have our pray and have our seats amen so Psalms 23 I know I'm sure we could all recite the off by heart I won't put put anyone up to the challenge but says this say Psalm of David the Lord is my shepherd let's let's make this this is my Psalm Hallelujah Joe David was inspired to write it but this is this is our word amen the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake ye thou walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen praise God Amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen gracious Heavenly Father we just desire to approach you with a heart full of Faith this morning Lord with Thanksgiving Lord knowing that you're more than able to fulfill your word in our lives and as we as We Gather here this morning we just want to ask once again that you would take control of Our Lives take control of all that we are dear God may you cleanse us of our secret faults forgive us of our iniquities and our sins we're just asking dear God our whole lives be covered in your blood may you have the preeminence Lord take control Lord God it's always such a joy Lord to stand back and see you take over a service and that's what we want Lord that wouldn't be me preaching it wouldn't be the Believers in the congregation listening Lord but you'd be preaching through me and be listening through them Father You' be worshiping through us all father that Lord you would take the Supreme place oh God that you deserve father we thank you we also want to especially remember those who couldn't be here this morning be their portion Lord Lord we're so thankful doesn't matter where we are you don't forget us dear God so father be with them anoint them Lord as well we commit the Our Lives the service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh um this morning so I want to speak about resting fire seated and walking now this is this may said seem like contradictory of terms but the believer is doing all these things now we are seated we are so I want to start with the resting aspect of this amen because you know the Christian walk is all based on the principle of rest yeah we are we are resting in his ability now I just want to read a couple of quotes here brother BR he um he said now now there's now the whole he says now what I found around most Christian lives most I hate to say it this way but it's true that most people that profess Christianity they seem to be have such a hard struggling time to hold on I believe it's a lack of correct teaching of the Bible I mean there's no such a thing as holding on he done the holding on Amen the whole Christian principle is based upon rest amen so it's not your striving not your pushing your pulling not your ability it's his ability amen so when we sit because remember we are resting in his ability and that is not just a idea of well he can fulfill his word but we rest in the fact he's in US fulfilling his word amen so we we see he says come unto me all ye that labor and a heavy laden and I will give you rest don't have to worry and struggle you're just resting that's all given rest you enter in peace the whole and that the whole thing's finished them who has called is Justified those he has Justified he has already glorified amen he says quoting scripture so as the Lord said that come unto me and I will give you rest now I just want to read a couple of these because to me it's so powerful and I pray that this becomes just the just the experience of our whole Christian Journey as that the Christian experience is based solemnly and wholly upon rest so not partially upon rest not a little bit of rest but complete rest come unto me all ye that labor in a heavy laden I'll give you rest we're tossed about with everything until you come to Christ then it's all finished am mean resting in Christ perfectly no matter what comes or goes nothing can touch us without it comes over the shepherd He has to permit it the Bible says all things work together for good to them that love the Lord and I say if you're in rest that is a real to you it's not just an idea you're trying to connect your life with it's a reality amen because you're resting that he has allowed all things amen and there's nothing that the devil can pull over our god he has to go before our God and ask permission before he can do anything whether the devil likes it or not he is not the boss our God is the boss the Lord Jesus Christ is supreme he is the boss and he has to go ask permission and whatever God allows he cannot overstep that boundary he cannot go beyond it he can't stretch it he can go as far as the Lord allows amen you know when job entered his great Temptation you know that where God would God would actually testify to the devil about job and say he's a perfect man there's none like him in all the Earth and you know so the devil would make a challenge while it's the only reason that he loves you the way he does is because nothing goes wrong in his life look he's blessed he's got family he's got riches he's got all these things and but then God God knew what was in job before job knew what was in job amen and Jo and God knew more about job than the devil did amen because God knew that job's experience of his Christian walk was not based on the blessings and the things the temporal things that come and go it was solemnly bled upon rest what was he resting in the shed blood of the Lamb that's he was resting in amen so when the enemy came against him God first gave gave gave instructions or gave license say look you can touch everything he has but not him and the devil did that he went to the nth degree took everything right and then the next time the Devil comes up before God you know God says basically I Told You So I Told You So devil right basically what he said and then he said well the only reason he still loves you is because he's got his health so once again God gave him God gave him permission you can do whatever you want you just can't take his life and what the devil took him to the nth degree but so our God is in control of all things amen we're got to just rest in this fact amen that God allows all things and those things are going to work together for your good amen if you love the Lord and are called according to his purpose it's going to work for your good you may not understand it in the circumstance but it's going to work for your good otherwise Romans 8:28 is a lie it's true hallelujah amen so if you're resting in that fact amen or if it's been revealed to you you can rest in that amen let me tell you that when God permits anything it'll be working for your good so when sickness be the so would sickness be the same thing certainly that God might heal you and show you a great testimony give you a little something to move on for all things work together for good amen let's just do one more because I like this but a True Believer his faith it rests solidly un shifting as he approaches the word of God why CU he's resting in the ability of his God I see the Christian fa faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to place wondering if this is right or this is right or is this true is this opinion right no they don't shift those kind of things they are Bas solemly upon the word of God a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a Christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary that's right oh sickness may come and disappointments but the Christian is at rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has performed amen knowing that no matter what the thing is and how it looks that there is neither sickness sorrow death nor neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that's in Jesus Christ we're at rest Just Let The Old Ship toss any way she wants to The Anchor Holds hallelujah amen so so the Christian journey is based completely upon rest amen the Christian experience is based completely upon rest it's not based upon our ability or anything that we could we could achieve it's no resting when you enter into his rest amen because we know that the that the true Sabbath is receiving the Holy Ghost it's not keeping a day it's not it's not your own works that would allow you to enter into this rest but this rest as the Lord Jesus Is Us quoting there from those quotes he says come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest amen I'll give you rest for your souls amen and and and we know the Apostle Paul he picks these things up when he when he's writing the book of Hebrews in the book of Hebrews he's cont contrasting um the you you the Old Testament the blood of bulls and goats amen with the blood of Jesus Christ he's contrasting the aonic priesthood with the priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ he's contrasting everything and he says that the that the one we now have is far Supreme than the old the old is just a shadow it's just a just a form but the new is the reality amen so when we are resting we're resting in reality amen remember this rest we're talking about is not an absence of trouble it's not an absence of Trials it's not an absence of hardship no that that is not the rest we're talking about this rest is not some yoga retreat somewhere with some with some scentered candles and you know nothing no problems no that's not the rest no the rest is there you can be in the greatest storm that's ever existed but there's such a solid unmovable Rock in your soul that God is able am mean God is willing God is present and I'm his child and he cares for me and I'm at rest I'm not worried what about the future he holds the future he held the past he holds the present and he's going to hold the future amen so we can rest in his ability don't be worried about nothing does that mean you get all laxad dael and nonchalant and no you don't if you're at rest you're fighting at if you're at rest you're pursuing if you're at rest you're walking with God I mean you're not sitting under a coconut tree watching the world go by no you're pushing the battle I mean cuz you have such a rest in your soul I can't lose amen cuz God can't God couldn't lose amen he came all the way down through the Old Testament the devil couldn't stop stop him amen he stood in a body of Flesh the devil couldn't stop him I mean he went to Calvary the devil couldn't stop him he went to hell the devil couldn't stop him he arose from the grave cuz the devil couldn't stop him he pulled his Spirit out upon the day of Pentecost cuz the devil couldn't stop him amen and the spirit of God has gone through seven Church ages and devil couldn't stop him and the devil can't stop him in this day am mean so if you're at rest you know if if the devil couldn't stop my God then he can't stop me now am mean cuz my God is in me my God is able hallelujah amen so so so what are you doing then then you're pushing the battle you're not hiding in some bunker saying W is me you say no where's that enemy amen where's that thing that's hindering me amen because if nothing could stop him and he's in you nothing can stop you so then why let things stop you oh my Lord Jesus hallelujah amen that's why if we're at rest we're fighting amen we're not just sitting around just pretending nothing's going on no we're at rest cuz we have Supreme confidence in the Supreme one that dwells in you and I Hallelujah Hall amen so the Apostle Paul would say here in Hebrews he said let us therefore fear lest our promise being left of us entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them he know he's speaking about Israel coming out of Egypt as you if you read the previous chapter uh for the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and them that heard it for we which have believed to enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place on the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore remaineth that that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if you'll hear his voice Harden not your hearts with Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterwards have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he also he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief now as I've said that rest is talking about is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost I mean that because that because when God comes and dwells in your Soul you cease from your own works it's not you trying to please God anymore it's not you trying to live the Christian life anymore no he comes and takes over amen amen amen he takes over your life as the Apostle Paul would say the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen the life I now live I used to live a different kind of a life I was trying to be a Pharisee of the Pharisees I was trying to please Jehovah God in my own ability and what I learned and did and all these things but then one day I met him on the road to Damascus amen and he transformed my life amen the no I was no longer just learning about a god of history but he stepped out of history and he became alive to me and he showed me the scripture he's fulfilling in this day amen and he changed my life and was living in me am mean just swallow your chewing gum and join in the ride today amen so like so so he's saying that this rest we must enter into this rest now what is this rest this rest as I said is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost as the Apostle sorry as as Isaiah would prophesy in in in Isaiah 28 he says Whom Shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there a little for stammering lips in another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear amen so on the day of Pentecost when the rest had fully come and the 120 in the upper room were filled with the spirit of God they they out there like a bunch of drunk people I mean they're stammering and they shouting and praising God and acting like a bunch of drunk people because they're under the impact they became intoxicated amen by the by the Holy Ghost dwelling in them and the people on the outside said these people are drunk with new wine these people are drunk because they were staggering they were stammering with lips and and and what it was was the rest had come the true rest had come to the people of God Amen so it's not keeping a day it's not it's it's not you know a Sabbath keeping and all these things is so just for the reading but let's just I'm just want to read these things I'm sure we'll get off reading eventually but it says and whom also we are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands this is in Colossians 2 and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in bapt baptism wherein also ye Arisen with him through the faith of the operation of God who raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh ha he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a holy day or a new moon or of the Sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ amen so he's saying don't let people judge you about what holid days you keep what feast days you keep all these kind of things you know that's just a shadow so why live in the shadow when you can have the reality I mean why have a shadow of keeping a Sabbath or just trying to be a good person good church person when you can live in the reality of the power of God and we come and live in your life and transform your life amen that you enter into a true rest hallelujah amen I was saying that this true rest is based completely uh it's it it's it this rest is is completely trusting in the ability of God Amen as as Ruth you if you read the book of Ruth it's the book of redemption it's not just a love story it's not just a nice uh you know nice love story they kind of slaughtered into the scripture but the book of redemption is in the Book of Ruth the whole Plan of Salvation for the whole world is in that book amen where where where there's the Redemption of the Gentile Ruth comes in she comes into Israel she's Redeemed by marriage to Boaz amen by her Union to Boaz um um she is redeemed and we know Boaz is a type of Jesus Christ Ruth is a gentile bride amen and through that Union then Naomi who's the who's the uh uh Israel is redeemed as well and then not only not only she is redeemed but then also the the the land they had before they left Israel and went into Moab is is redeemed right amen so so everything is restored by the end of the book of Ruth that they lost in the beginning and and and when when the whole word of God is complete When the eternity's Roll On The Devil's burning in the Lake of Fire a bunch of bunch of char in the bottom there gone and we're dancing around the Throne of God what's that the whole Plan of Redemption is complete amen so so within the four chapters of Ruth is actually the whole story of God's Plan of Redemption now there comes a stage we know the first stage of Ruth is is Ruth has to decide she's got to decide I'm going to follow you I mean when when Naomi was was um you know heard that there was food there was grain back in Israel she tells her two daughters-in-law that she's left with saying I'm going back to Israel you stay in Moab stay here go back to your father's house find someone else to marry I'm going home and then offer offer her um Ruth's other um Ruth's sister-in-law decides to stay turn back and go back to Moab you never hear about her again she weeps they weep she goes back but Ruth Ruth makes up her mind she says anomi your God be my God your people be my people where you die I'll die I'm following you I'm not I'm not turning around I'm not going back to the world I'm not going back to some religion I came out of I'm walking with you all the way I mean so she made up her mind and then ala said I mean sorry Nomi said she you know you said that she couldn't persuade her otherwise so she let her go with her so so there was a stage of her deciding I'm going to be a Christian I'm going to serve the Lord I'm going to give my life to the Lord Jesus Christ but then but but then there came a stage where she was working she was laboring she was in the field she was in has his field so she was in the right kind of field amen she was in the field of the word amen she was in the right kind of field amen amen but she was just just trying to scrape together a few blessings here and there a few scriptures and a few things to just to keep her going just to sustain her but that wasn't the end of her journey amen that that that was never meant to be the end of her journey because she found herself Grace brought her into boaz's field amen and the chief Reaper pointed um pointed out or introduced uh Boaz to Naomi and then Bo said to her stay in this field stay in this field but then there had to come now a time when Ruth stopped laboring and she came into rest amen now now this rest if we um this is this is Ruth chapter 3 I've just taken the first verse and the last few verses so she's been laboring in the field and Naomi knows that the field that she works in which is Boaz as is a near Kinsman unto her and we know the law of the kinsman redeemer in Israel is that someone had to uh uh in order to restore someone that have you know lost everything sold themselves into um um servitude or whatever that that a Kinsman had to there was a law that a Kinsman could redeem them and their property so the Kinsman had to be a blood relative had to be able to do it and and had to want to do it that was the that's the three criteria for a kinsman redeemer now we know our lord Jesus he had to be we had to be related to him and it's not this thing it's not not this thing it's this thing that makes us around doesn't matter what color you are doesn't matter where you're from language you speak that's got nothing to do with being related to our Lord Jesus Christ now there there's a SE Gene of predestination he puts on the inside of you before the foundation of the world am mean so he's got to be a relative to us that's why God became a man to redeem us amen cuz he had to fulfill his law right am mean he couldn't do it as an angel or the pillar of fire he had to become a man just like you and I amen and so and so he's related to us he he had to have the ability to do it our lord Jesus owns the universe in his veins is the purchasing power to break the power of sin amen the life of God is the only thing that can break the curse of sin amen so he had it in him so so so he is carrying the gold around if I could put it this way to do it but he had to be willing oh he was willing he was very willing to do it amen hallelujah why the joy sit before him that's why he went to Calvary she he was very willing to do it amen so so here is here is Nomi here speaking sorry just a bit of a background but um he says now noomi her her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee so now the whole cycle is turning into Ruth must come to her rest Hallelujah and she lay and then and then and then and then n instructs Ruth to you know change her clothes whatever and then go down and find you'll find Boaz at the threshing floor and where where he is L down at his feet now this is just the earlier part of the chapter you can go away and read it and she lay at his feet until the morning she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman come down into the floor also he said bring the veil that thou Hast upon thee and and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of Bley and laid it on her and he went and she went into the city now we know in the Bible there's six of a lot of things the seventh is always Christ so so Joshua would would Institute six Cities of Refuge in the promised land the seventh the true City of Refuge is Christ himself amen when Christ went to the went to the um wedding supper I mean you you know the marriage that had no wine he said get six pots for purification he's the seventh he's the source right he's the source that turned the water into wine right you know the woman at the well she had six husbands Christ was the true husband amen so it's like the Els the seventh is a mystery but it's Christ himself winding up his plan amen so when so when Boaz gave six measures of barley he's basically telling Ruth Ruth I'm the seventh these are little blessings but you're going to get everything Hallelujah when you're United to me yeah Hallelujah so now she could she could take that as a token or a promise and she went back to her mother-in-law amen praise God hallelujah now and then she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day amen so we enter into rest but our God's working amen and he will not rest until it's all wound up amen he will not cease until everything is done amen when you know I love those words in the Book of Revelation it is done hallelujah it is done amen there'll come a day when he says it it is done and it is done hallelujah amen but he will not rest until that day amen he will not he will not Slumber or sleep or rest or anything until his Plan of Redemption is done he is committed to his plan he has sold out to his plan and he's going to see it through am mean our lord Jesus is very determined am mean so now she could she could enter into rest because it was no longer Ruth trying to do anything it was now Boaz was stepping into his position as kinman Redeemer Hallelujah so amen so to me this is a glorious thing where now she's in the cycle of resting and then she goes from resting to rewarded amen but it's Boaz that does the whole thing you go read the book of Ruth there's a time where it's just Ruth and Nomi and and then there's a transition where Boaz comes in and then he takes over the story Hallelujah then he gets a hold of Ruth marries her redeems everything puts everything back how it should have been in the beginning Hallelujah and that's what our lord Jesus like us our book of life it started we just thought it was just all us and we found ourselves through through circumstances coming into his field coming into the message of the hour amen and then he what we find Grace in his sight and then we found out and then the word instructs us lay down at his feet where he's laying down and we go to Calvary we lay down at his feet amen and then it what then begins to move on our behalf he knew you before the foundation of the world he knew you'd come and lay there he knew you'd come down and lay there but he wants you to come into a state of rest and then what does he do he begins to do a work in your life he transforms your life he gives you Victory he proves his word amen he shows you who you really meant to be who you really are hallelujah amen I trust we're all happy today amen so she she enters into rest amen so what's she doing now she is resting and that rest only comes when you realize God's going to finish the job amen God's going to finish the job amen hallelujah amen he says when the morning came way before the break of day she gathered up a great big bunch of barley six measures I believe it was put it in a little Shaw went home noi said my daughter after she raised up from the altar went back now what's going to happen mama what's going to take place now rest amen rest Ruth because the man will have no rest until he's done the full price of redemption amen amen right there's where I stand amen he'll not rest until he's done the full price of redemption to redeem you everything that you ever lost everything that you was he's going to restore it amen it's like you see you know it's amazing when you really see that God's able to do it it causes you to rest amen as as as um John was caught up in the spirit in the Lord's day he was taken up into the throne room of God and then he you know sees this great Throne uh scene of the Throne of God the 4 and 20 elders and different things around the throne and he sees that little book in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne sealed with Seven Seals and he heard a strong Angel proclaiming who's worthy to take the book but then John looks around he sees no man's worthy I mean to to take the book even to open it there's no man worthy and he weeping much because he knew that that PL that book was tied to the Plan of Redemption and and there was no but this scene isn't just the 4 and2 Elders John on the throne and these things now all the redeemed are encapsulated in the scene so all the prophets were there all the Believers were there didn't matter how holy and righteous they were no man was found worthy an angel could have done it but an angel didn't lose the didn't cause the fall it was man that allowed the fall to come so man would have to come and redeem it amen so John's weeping because he's not resting because he's not seeing the picture right he's not seeing the whole plan right amen he's all worried and stressed because wondering what's going to happen now because the whole creation himself is in Jeopardy because no one's found worthy but then one of the one of the elders turned to him and said no no you can rest John don't weep John don't weep over your situation John don't be caught up in what's going on right now John I'm going to show you something to look at that you can rest in amen he says that behold the line of the tribe of Judah amen has prevailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals amen and then and then and then I don't have the scripture here but I think verse six says that he looked and he saw the lamb he saw the one he walked with the shores of Galilee he saw the one that Rose Lazarus from the grave he saw the one that he saw that resurrected out of the Grave himself he saw the one that he laid on his bosom that he loved and loved him and then now he could he could rest amen he could rest that now that now the Plan of Redemption will be completed because the worthy one he walked with was now the worthy one that was going to finish what he started hallelujah amen so he's going to finish what he started and then so his weeping turned into worship His weeping turned into rejoicing amen he did not keep his voice silent he couldn't keep himself silent when he saw the lamb step forth amen he said blessing everything in Earth under the earth and the Sea and all those everything basically said heard me saying blessing and honor glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever amen he saw but then also in that scene he saw himself there redeemed already hallelujah amen so he could have a jubilee cuz he was resting God's able to I may be repeating myself the needle will move on the thing eventually you know but but we need to rest in what God's doing prise the Lord amen because because now John could have confidence that God's going to finish his plan amen so what he started he will perfect amen and it's the same thing with you and I what he started he's going to finish it am mean what he finished what he started he's going to finish it amen and he's going to finish it how he wants to finish it amen so if he saw you made in His image before the foundation of the world that's how you're going to end up amen but we've got to we've got a rest that he's going to do it amen now in order to be resting and fighting we've got to be drawing strength from his promises amen we can't be drawing strength from you don't draw strength from doubt or unbelief or any of these things no we must draw strength from him right we must draw strength from him amen because you look at you look at you look at Caleb now Caleb was resting he was resting when Moses came into Egypt he was resting when he walked across the Red Sea he was resting by Mount Si he was resting when he looked at the land he was resting he said let's go take it at once he was resting for 40 years in the wilderness waiting for his day he didn't sit back and say someone else to do it he says give me a piece he said to Moses he's 84 years old I'm as strong now as I was then amen why cuz he was drawing strength off the promise God told me I'm going to dwell on that mountain God told me that Mountain's mind God told me my children are going to live there and he drew strength off that promise that he wasn't going to perish in the wilderness that God gave him Faith Revelation and because he received that Revelation he was resting amen I trust it's the same thing with you and I he's given you Revelation see we got to realize we've seen the end of the picture amen if you've receiv received the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true seal of God you're sealed to the day of your Redemption amen so therefore you know your destination Hallelujah so if you know your destination why why not rest in the today amen if he's got your end sorted he's got the everyday sorted he's got every battle lined up for you to get a victory out of amen that's why that's why Caleb knew my destination children is there maybe going Google Maps we're traveling here this place is mine I've already renamed it on Google Maps this is my home address this mountain amen and my my home address is not here it's in glory but Caleb knew nothing could stop him until he he receives that inheritance because God quickened it to his soul so he could rest Hallelujah he fought a lot of battles and it wasn't shooting from a trench somewhere this is right in the person's face there been a lot of enemies maybe a lot of close calls but he could rest in the battle I can't die here I can't die here I got to go live there I ain't living there yet so I can't die here are you with me amen David knew he was anointed to go sit on the throne he had a lot of time of trouble he had a lot of struggles he had lot of things going on but he encouraged himself in the Lord that God had anointed him by a prophet that he's going to sit on the throne so when he's sitting in zigg the place in ashes his family is gone his men's family is gone they thinking of stoning him I mean he encouraged himself in the Lord because he realized I'm not on the throne yet I've been anointed to sit there I'm not been anointed just to sit here in ashes I've been anointed to sit there so he could encourage himself he drew strength he didn't draw you can't draw strength from wor worry questions trouble doubt that just weakens Faith am me but he he allowed us strength he allowed us Faith to take over by encouraging himself in the Lord amen and then so what happened now is that rest he was resting in because the atmosphere he generated went upon his men Hallelujah men this is a bad spot I don't know what he would have said but maybe something like this Brothers remember when you found me in the cave Brothers remember when you felt the anointing on me come upon you Brothers remember the day you became giant Killers Brothers you remember the day that God has given us great victories he ain't going to leave us now he anointed me to be on the throne I'm going to get there how you going to get there David he's going to I'm resting in the fact he's going to get me there I'm resting in the fact that he's going to get me on the throne and so that rest now went into them what should we do pray yes they to pray Hallelujah and what happened God said go pursue you'll recover all Hallelujah so they could all rest in the fact we're getting them back they didn't just sit there and say well if God's going to do it God's going to do it and if he doesn't do it he's not going to do no that's not resting that's unbelief speaking no faith says it's mine faith says the promise is mine faith says now is the day now is the day for Liberation now is the day for deliverance amen hallelujah amen praise God Abraham Abraham would would would come to a place of rest in his walk with God in the 17th chapter of Genesis God would God would appear to Abraham say I'm the almighty God the strong one now if you look into the definition of that um name there the almighty God uh part of the meaning of it is uh you know it's from the word El Shai and that doesn't just mean the strong one it means like the breasted God like a mother breastfeeding her baby so God is telling Abraham Abraham nurse off the promise nurse off my word nurse draw strength from me Hallelujah you can't fulfill it in your own strength so you need a source of strength and here I am amen your source of strength is not the economy or what's going on in life my I am your source of strength Abraham so draw strength out of my word draw strength out of the anointing and you'll find your body begin to change you'll find Faith begin to rise just rest at my bosom and drink Hallelujah and you'll find now you'll begin to rest cuz you're drawing strength from me amen hallelujah you say does that really work who's ever felt such a rest when we're at say camp for example you go Monday morning you're like man I'm resting in the promises of God hallelujah why cuz you've been drawing strength from God all weekend amen amen you've been you've been drinking from Al should I right so now you're resting and you're drawing strength for the promise and that's what we've got to keep doing amen now I heard brother Tim P mentioned this um and this is from this is from this is part of the letter that brother brah was sent out with a prayer cloth they said he had more success with prayer cloth and healings from them than even just the ministry so there's a lot of Miracles that happened with the prayer cloth sent out and so in the instruction he said we are not to be occupied with our feelings or symptoms of our faith or or lack of faith but only with what God has said amen that's how you rest i' I've shared this with a few people thought well I'm going to share it with everyone cuz I like this we're not to be occupied with our feelings our feelings lie our feelings don't give you strength our feelings help no one you know oh I'm happy sad up and down I'm going to make it not going to make it I feel this I feel that forget that forget that no or our oh do I have enough Faith or do I not who's got the faith meter that they can just like some app no no one has that so don't be occupied with well can I believe for this and can do I have faith for this no we have to you don't get strength from that because you're looking at you and what you perceive you as amen but if you're looking at his promises if you occupy yourself with what he has said I mean then what are you doing you're drinking from Al Shai and you're getting strength from him amen so let's be occupied with what God has said amen you know the human mind has only so much uh capacity mine's like this it's not big well I should feel that with what he has said amen amen with what he has said not what I think or this person says or this person feels no what does he said I'm going to occupy myself with that yeah amen now the simple way is to begin calling the thing we have prayed for ours and to thank God for them before we feel or see the answer God is faithful he cannot deny himself the word of God tells us when we pray believe mark 11:24 we must believe that we have the answer even though we neither see it nor feel it that we have it amen God says now Faith is it's Hebrews 11:1 not faith shall be for that would only be hoping for and not and not present tense believing and having faith begins now amen so why not start resting now why not let God take over now or one day when I'm old what about now what about at this age this age is a good age amen today is a day of salvation amen so let's be occupied with what he has said amen so let's if you don't mind I think let's go through some things he said let's go through some things amen who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed well those who believe his report the arm of the Lord is revealed to amen for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he is no form nor com and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we are we HD as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely Heath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows has he done that you think you're carrying all your sorrows and grief he's already carried it amen he so he understands your grief and sorrow cuz he's carried it himself amen no one understands you like the Lord Jesus understands you hey amen I trust you believe that this morning amen he was yet we did esteem him strick him smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions this is what he said he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen we are like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone out of his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all amen the last book before Revelation now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy remember this is the presence of the one we're talking about can see everything he can see all things there's nothing you can hide from the only thing you can hide is when you put things under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ then he can't see it CU it doesn't exist anymore amen so he's able to keep you from falling amen amen if this is quick into your heart you can really well if you really know him you can just really enter into rest get the idea out of your mind you can ever fall amen because if you realize hey I can't lose then you'll press the battle with a greater Zeal with a greater love and determination a greater Thanksgiving amen cuz you can't think oh the devil's going to take me out I say if he could have taken me out he would have amen if he wanted if he was able to kill us before why are we still here remember nothing can take us till our purpose is done upon the Earth nothing can take us out till our purpose is done when our purpose is done upon the Earth and God takes us home we go to be with the Lord amen so so we got to get this thing out of our mind that we can f fail we may have disappointments we may have things that don't seem to work out but no but Faith still exists faith is still there now unto him that's able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty Dominion power both now and forever amen amen so can you rest in his ability this morning I trust you can amen for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him amen so he was our sin offering he's our scape go he carried our sins far away but that but that's not just the end of it that we would be made the righteousness of God in him can we rest in his the power of his blood today can we rest in it it's not it's not Sal salvation is not the blood of Jesus Christ and her own Good Conduct no that's a Methodist idea from a past age now the reality of the word has come back say it's nothing but the blood of Jesus salvation is of God Alone amen it's his blood it's his ability it's his anointing amen can we rest in that amen amen Zephaniah 3:16 in that day it shall be said to Jerusalem fear thou not and to Zion let not thy hands be slack the Lord thy God in uh in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will re over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will Joy over thee with singing hallu amen doesn't that give you a great rest when God is reveal to us his attitude towards you and I amen he's not he's not ashamed of you he doesn't want to put you in a corner and hide your away because he doesn't want any no he rests he rests in his love he Joys over you with singing amen he rejoices over thee with joy you think we're the ones that Rejoice no God rejoices over you amen you think this is a bit strong I'm just reading scripture to you you can take it oh but not me no that's you the word's got to become personal oh that's brother sister so and so no that's you amen how can he rejoice in me you're the workmanship of his hands amen you're you're in the back of his mind you're in his heart you're expressed upon the Earth he's walking with you he wants to know you amen and he's rejoicing because you're are part of him he's not ashamed of any of his family there's no weird uncles in this family you know no that we're all Sons and Daughters of God Amen Hallelujah but now thus sayith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine when thou passest through the waters I'll be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and SE before thee since thou was precious in my sight Glory what more can we say to these things friends we wrestle with does God accept us oh we're accepted in the belove of the Bible says because my lamb is accepted I'm accepted remember in the Old Testament the worshipper knew he had sinned he brought a lamb without blemish that he thought was a lamb without blemish or bulock or a goat you know according to the word took it to the priest yeah right when the priest saw the sacrifice he did not sit the worshipper down and interrogate them for two hours about everything they've done and the reason they here and all these things no he inspected the lamb amen and if the worshipper was was genuinely sincere and believe the word he could enter into rest when this his sacrifice was accepted on his behalf cuz he had true faith in the word our Lamb's been accepted our lamb was examined he's been accepted praise God so we can rest that he's more than enough amen now since thou is precious in my sight thou has been honorable I have loved thee therefore I'll give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for I with thee I'll give thy I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I'll say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have made him amen amen so he says bring them back I'll call them from afar we're resting in that ability of God to bring the prodal home Amen to bring to bring these Wayward ones home are we resting that he can do it amen remember we are the sons and daughters of God am maybe I should be like Jeremiah don't look at their faces when you preach we are the sons and daughters of God we're not beggars in the kingdom of God we are God's children he wants us to take him at his word amen he wants us to rest in his ability but not just be sitting back and saying well God will do it or or not no we're fighting for it remember if the promise has been revealed to you you take it right you take it with both hands amen you don't let it go amen when you realize that the Lord's your savior you don't let that go no you hold on to his you hold on to his salvation amen when you realize he's your protector you don't let him go amen if you realize he's your healer you don't let that go amen he's your deliverer you don't let that go you hold on to it amen you're fighting you realize no my God is more than able amen that in every battle I face he is there to win the Victory and maybe not how I think it should be won but he knows how it should be won amen but we've got it we can't panic in the fight if we rest if it's been if if he has revealed himself to us we don't panic in the fight I mean no we're strong in the fight because our God is mighty he's fighting our battle amen it doesn't matter what the enemy tries to do to us no we can rest that God is able hallelujah amen because he's made us to believe for the impossible amen he's made us he's made us not to doubt not to be discouraged the devil tries to make us feel that way but he but God hasn't made us to be that way he's made us to be strong in the me to be Rock Solid on the word of God to take God at his word and take every promise that's ours now is not the season if we're resting in his ability we're like Caleb Caleb was a shadow pointing to you and I amen cuz Caleb said that piece of the land is mine and what did he what did Caleb do he spent four years fighting for everyone else until he got his inheritance that's what he did he says I'm 84 years old I've been fighting these four years he said to Joshua Now give me my Mountain so he was he was helping because he he saw the end of his journey but brother SOS is going through something he picked up his sword let's take out that am malachite amen sister so so's going through this let's take out that Anakin amen let's take these ones out amen he was fighting all the way to his promise and then he got his promised amen now we are what are we going what are we pressing for a body change that's right amen we're living in the season of the Resurrection am mean no we're not we're living in a season where the dead and Christ are going to raise oh one day it'll happen no this is the season this world is this close to the Great Tribulation this world has fallen apart it's not falling apart it has fallen apart the wheels are off the bus the bus is in the in the ditch it's on fire it's upside down that's how the world is oh someone's going to fix it no oh this is no it's not we are preparing to leave this world but as we're preparing to leave amen let's get everyone we can on the Gospel Ship amen let's fight for every soul see we're going to see Lord you saved me you when I first met God I thought everyone's going to believe this I was just so sold out I just thought man Jesus is Alive why cuz he stepped I didn't have a religion I met Christ he changed my life I was a drunk I was doing all kind of things to the world you would have written me off a long time ago but he found me and transformed me all I had was the Bible in the message didn't have a church didn't have someone to tell me what to do God told me what to do God guided me amen God found me he saved me he cleansed me he kept me amen I realized he lives Hallelujah so what then you begin to testify you begin to share you going to be a witness amen why because if he saved me he can do it for anyone Hallelujah so Caleb would have thought well if God's going to be give me this mountain he's going to give all of Israel their inheritance so I'm going to help you out in your in your battle amen amen that's why we must never I'm just that I I'll probably pick this up another time but I'm just going to close with this thought let's not quit am let's not quit if you're resting you will be fighting amen if you're really resting in Christ you will be fighting amen if you're not resting you'll just be worrying right or can he do it am I really his am I really his child no but when he reveals himself to you remember the book of Galatians says because you are Sons you receive the Holy Ghost because you are you don't become a son or daughter by the new birth you receive the new birth cuz you are amen so that should take all the worry out of our lives I'm his child he can't lose one of them that's the one thing God can't do he can't lose one of his children he can't lie he can't he can't fail there's lot things he can't do but that's one of the things he can't do is lose one of his so if I'm one of his he's going to get a hold of me maybe I'm got to go through a lot of dealings and a lot of buckl a lot of things to get back on the road but hey he's going to correct me as long as I'm his child he's going to keep me on the road Hallelujah but if I'm his I'm his well let's press the battle Lord where are we going today it's like Jonathan's armor Bearer I think Jonathan was the only one with the sword right the Philistines are up I think mishmash they had a Garrison and Saul sitting there in the camp backsliding saying no one can eat anything and you know Joshua say to's armor Bearer let's go let's go check out the enemy and then and then and then so so the armor Bearer says okay Lord I'm coming with you basically the God God says let's go into this let's walk here I'm coming with you I'll carry the armor what do you I'm just carry his armor he does the fighting I carry the armor the armor Bearer had to go with you Jonathan if you look there um actually know where the battle fought it's like upper Cliff was the Garrison and Jonathan and his armor bear had to go up on their hands and feet and then so Jonathan said to the armor Bearer I might get this the wrong way like I normally mix things up if I have two options but basically I think Jonathan says the Amor be now if they if they say come up God's given us the battle if not then we haven't got the battle so so the Philistines see them climbing up and then and then the Philistines say come up here and Jonathan says we got the battle so the armor Bearer carrying Jonathan's Armor gets up there Jonathan's the one that has the sword and of course eventually the AR be gets the sword but what I'm trying to say is just go with God and he'll fight the battle for you and they won a great Victory right what if the what if the amaba was not resting in Jonathan's leadership oh Prince Jonathan I don't know if we should do that you know your father said we got to stay in the camp and do all these things now he said look we're won where you go Jonathan I'm going what battle you press into I'm right there with you Hallelujah I'll carry the shield of Faith I've I've got the full armor of God I'm coming with you Jonathan and they won a mighty victory that day why because the armor Bearer went with Jonathan you want to see a mighty Victory go with Christ go with Christ amen follow him into the battle amen he will fight it for you don't hide don't quit don't be silent don't let

of it probably another time then you're fighting hallelujah amen and you have complete rest in the battle that God's going to do it how when why that's him but if God said so God said so amen if he's
