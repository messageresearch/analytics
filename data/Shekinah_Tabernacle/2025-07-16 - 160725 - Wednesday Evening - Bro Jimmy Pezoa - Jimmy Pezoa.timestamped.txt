[27:45] Thank you, Jesus. Man, what atmosphere?
[27:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Well, finally,
[27:52] I'm here. Was it like three times that I
[27:55] had to skip? But I'm here. Um
[28:02] I had um sermon that I prepare.
[28:06] But last night I I was just praying and
[28:12] it was like I have this ready. I can
[28:15] just go to sleep and just I have the
[28:18] message. But the Lord was like no. I I
[28:22] just couldn't settle. So I just had to
[28:24] change it. So it's going to be a little
[28:26] bit like me.
[28:28] Just mixed up just
[28:34] so Oh, I put it in Spanish. First
[28:37] Timothy 1
[28:41] chapter 1:3
[28:44] says, this is Paul, but this can be you
[28:47] too. who was before a blasphemer and me
[28:50] too and a persecutor and injurious. But
[28:53] I obtained mercy because I did it
[28:56] ignorantly in unbelief.
[28:59] Verse 14 says, "And the grace of our
[29:02] Lord was exceeding exceeding abundant
[29:05] with faith and love which is in Christ
[29:07] Jesus." 17 Now unto the King, eternal,
[29:12] immortal, invisible, the only wise God,
[29:15] be honor and glory forever and ever.
[29:18] Amen.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have your seat.
[29:21] Let's let's talk a little bit of Jesus
[29:23] Christ, the King of Kings. Amen.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; We accept Jesus as our King. So, he can
[29:32] have full dominion of our lives. So, we
[29:34] just give everything to him. He rules
[29:37] our life. He's in control. Amen.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; And which ones are this? Kings.
[29:44] Revelations one says, "And from Jesus
[29:46] Christ, who is the faithful witness and
[29:49] the first begotten of the death, and the
[29:52] prince
[29:54] of the kings of the earth, unto him that
[29:56] love us, and washes from our sins in his
[29:59] own blood, and hath made us kings and
[30:02] priests, unto God and his father. To him
[30:05] be glory and dominion forever and ever.
[30:07] Amen.
[30:09] I'm just surrounded by royalty tonight.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; You are all kings, queens,
[30:17] beautiful people. Amen.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; But to be a king, we have to conduct
[30:25] ourselves as royalty.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; We have here the pyramid with the seven
[30:32] um the statue of the of a perfect man.
[30:38] Now I'm I'm going to do this uh
[30:40] parallelism between
[30:42] what God thinks about a king and what
[30:45] the world can offer you as a king.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; So we have virtue,
[30:52] faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[30:54] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness,
[30:57] and love. That's what God thinks about
[31:01] the way that we should be. Amen. That's
[31:05] what we aiming for. Amen. I was thinking
[31:08] about just temperance, just being able
[31:10] to control your character in when the
[31:14] things get hot, you have to control
[31:16] yourself. That only can be done with the
[31:19] Holy Ghost.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; As I work um as a trady, me and David,
[31:24] we have a joke about builders cuz some
[31:27] builders, they can lose the plots quite
[31:29] easily. just just the it's so much
[31:31] pressure that they always seems to be
[31:34] angry and just swearing. It's just they
[31:36] are just running big projects. It's just
[31:39] take from the Lord like we just do to
[31:41] the floor. So we that's what we do but
[31:45] they are doing so much stuff. So that
[31:48] always like
[31:50] doing something.
[31:52] So here we have a king
[31:56] Christian the 7th. He was a king in
[32:00] Denmark in Norway and a duke from one
[32:03] place that I wouldn't even pronounce.
[32:07] So this guy
[32:10] had the annoying habit of throwing food
[32:13] at his dinner guest.
[32:16] He also um used to be put some um what's
[32:21] that?
[32:23] Oh, he used to also like slap people in
[32:26] the face just because he used to put
[32:30] some pins into his um under the chair of
[32:33] her uh grandmother.
[32:36] And also he when he was introduced to
[32:39] people and when they bowed to him, you
[32:42] know, when you see a king, you're
[32:43] supposed to bow, he used to do like a
[32:46] lip frog over them as a way to amuse
[32:49] himself. So that's what he used to do
[32:51] when you used to bow him. He used to
[32:53] just jump you over. He had some mental
[32:56] issues.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; But he was a king.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; He was a king. But they they did like a
[33:04] coupe. They took him over. He was still
[33:06] the king, but he was not ruling cuz he
[33:10] man how
[33:13] there was another uh some more cases. I
[33:15] didn't just want to put them there. But
[33:17] yeah, that guy was a king from Denmark.
[33:19] And
[33:21] yeah,
[33:23] our Lord Jesus Christ is also a king.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Full of virtue. Yeah.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; The the important thing about a king is
[33:32] that he has to have dominion.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz how a king can be a king without a
[33:38] territory. He needs dominion. And that's
[33:41] where your heart comes. Yeah. You have
[33:44] to let Jesus rule your heart. You
[33:47] especially you. Jesus Christ is our king
[33:52] and we accept him. And that's a way that
[33:55] we can say that we want him to clean us
[33:58] from our sin.
[34:01] How many of you have you give your heart
[34:03] to Jesus?
[34:05] &gt;&gt; I hope that everyone. Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; That's the most beautiful thing that we
[34:10] can do.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says that if you don't
[34:15] serve Jesus,
[34:17] &gt;&gt; you are serving something else.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; You can't have two masters. There's only
[34:22] one that you can serve.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:27] But as Christians, sometimes you and
[34:30] even myself, I'm preaching to to me.
[34:33] This is for me. This is for brother
[34:34] Jimmy.
[34:36] You can be a Christian. You can come to
[34:38] church and still being do silly stuff.
[34:42] Amen.
[34:45] That's why the Bible talk to us about
[34:49] the new birth. You must to be born
[34:53] again. Otherwise, you cannot make it.
[34:56] You have to be born again. And if you
[34:58] have been at the hospital when a baby is
[35:01] getting born,
[35:04] man,
[35:06] what an experience. E there's blood,
[35:09] there's crying, there's you are worried,
[35:12] you don't know what's going to happen. I
[35:14] remember when Bella was born, no one
[35:16] told me that the babies hit. Sometimes I
[35:18] go in a funny way. hit was like an ig.
[35:22] And I was so worried. I was like, "Man,
[35:24] my poor daughter." Like, and I remember
[35:26] the the doctor, she was like,
[35:30] she was, "Oh, she's so beautiful." And I
[35:32] was like, "What?"
[35:36] I told somebody, "When are we going to
[35:38] talk about the elephant in the room?"
[35:39] Like,
[35:41] but now she's her head is all good. No
[35:44] one told me. I was just worried about my
[35:46] daughter. Amen.
[35:48] So when as you are growing you can see
[35:51] like you have to experience some stuff.
[35:54] You have to try to walk by yourself. You
[35:57] have to learn how to talk again. Things
[35:59] that you have you can do and you cannot
[36:01] do.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; If back in the world you used to grab a
[36:07] pen and scratch the walls and do drawing
[36:10] like Bella is doing now probably you are
[36:13] not supposed to do it. You know like
[36:15] just as a type here when you are
[36:20] um
[36:22] how you call it when when you are
[36:24] um you must to be born again when you
[36:27] are growing up. Amen. There's some
[36:29] things that you cannot do. That's why
[36:32] our character has to be changed. Amen.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; But the Lord Jesus Christ is
[36:44] He make him sure. He does the job for
[36:46] us.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; We can just rest in him.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; We have um here David, which I call just
[36:58] royal holidays. This is when a king just
[37:01] decide to have holidays. He didn't go to
[37:03] the war. He just stay home.
[37:06] And one day he saw this girl, but she
[37:10] had a husband. Amen. Yeah.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; So we all know what happened. They had a
[37:15] son. The poor son died.
[37:19] Because for everything what you do,
[37:20] there are consequences.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; And this is for the young ones.
[37:25] And the world the only thing that wants
[37:27] you to do it's to get dirty and filthy.
[37:31] So then the devil has that leverage
[37:34] &gt;&gt; and it's tell you like how can you go
[37:36] back to church if you just did this
[37:38] thing and start just pulling you
[37:41] &gt;&gt; pulling you and as you keep doing more
[37:44] more bad stuff that leverage is more
[37:47] strong that's how that's what happened
[37:50] to me back in the world I mean like when
[37:52] when I was a young one I start doing
[37:54] silly stuff and the more silly stuff
[37:56] that you do is the more conscious that
[37:58] comes to you and you are like man I'm
[38:00] bad I'm bed and bed and the devil start
[38:02] to talk to you and telling you you
[38:04] should stop going to church. There's no
[38:05] way back for you. But I'm here tonight
[38:08] to tell you there's a way back. You can
[38:10] always turn around from your sin. Amen.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Was listening today the message um
[38:17] message of grace.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Oh man, what a message.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:23] Because when David sinned in that way,
[38:28] God's grace for him was sending him a
[38:30] prophet
[38:31] &gt;&gt; and telling him that story about the
[38:34] ship.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; And when King David was like
[38:39] so fast and just said, "Yes, that man
[38:42] shall die."
[38:43] That prophet said to him, "That man is
[38:45] you." Yeah,
[38:50] &gt;&gt; but God's grace was with David. Not
[38:53] because David was something else. It's
[38:55] just because he showed mercy to whom he
[38:58] wants to show mercy.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; So David was in that state
[39:05] &gt;&gt; filthy and he thought that he was going
[39:08] to get away with it. He got married with
[39:10] Bashiba.
[39:12] He thought that everything was
[39:13] undercover. like everything is covered.
[39:16] I got married. The baby died. I can rest
[39:19] now. But God is never going to let you
[39:22] in that state.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; That sin has to come out cuz he has to
[39:26] clean you. He can't lose you. That's the
[39:28] thing.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; You are part of him.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; He can't lose you. He cannot do it
[39:34] because you are part of him. Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Bible said John 10 said, "My sheep hear
[39:39] my voice and I know them and they follow
[39:42] me and I give unto them eternal life and
[39:44] they shall never perish neither shall
[39:46] any man pluck them out of my hand. My
[39:49] father which gave them give them me is
[39:53] greater than all and no man is able to
[39:56] plug them out of my father's hand. I and
[39:59] my father are one."
[40:03] So, I'm here tonight just to let you
[40:06] know that doesn't matter what you have
[40:09] done.
[40:11] There's a way back. You can always turn
[40:13] around. Doesn't matter what you have
[40:15] done. You can turn your heart to Christ.
[40:19] He's waiting for you. Amen. He's waiting
[40:22] for you. And I'm going to
[40:26] use this um opportunity that my wife is
[40:29] not here. She's in Tanga with the kids
[40:33] to talk a little bit what happened when
[40:35] I was when I was young. I felt from the
[40:37] Lord to do it. So I'm just going to do
[40:38] it.
[40:40] I was a young one probably when I was
[40:42] like 15 16. I had this girlfriend
[40:46] and you know when you have a girlfriend
[40:47] for a long time then you start doing
[40:50] really bad stuff that the Bible said
[40:52] that you should die.
[40:55] So the devil just had that leverage on
[40:57] me and I felt that I I that was it. You
[41:02] know the Bible said that you know who
[41:04] whoever does fornication just put to
[41:07] death. That's what I felt like man I'm a
[41:10] failure. I cannot turn back now. This
[41:12] this is it. Stop going to church getting
[41:16] back in the world drinking drugs and the
[41:19] thing just start like a snowball. You do
[41:22] something and then just get bigger and
[41:24] bigger and bigger and then you are like
[41:27] that ship completely
[41:31] filthy.
[41:34] And that's how the devil want to see
[41:36] you.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Filthy.
[41:39] Thought to commit suicide.
[41:42] But man, there was grace.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; There was grace, man.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Grace. I always thought in when I was a
[41:50] little kid that God
[41:52] had a favorite in the Bible and that was
[41:54] David. Cuz David, you know, David, he
[41:56] used to do bad stuff, repent, go back,
[42:00] do bad stuff, repent and the Lord was
[42:02] always there for him. And just today I
[42:05] was thinking and I was like, and what
[42:06] about you?
[42:08] What about me? Like I have done so much
[42:11] stuff and the Lord always has been there
[42:14] for me.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:16] So if you have done anything that's
[42:19] really really bad, don't think that is
[42:22] the end.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; You can always turn around.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; There's hope. If you are alive tonight,
[42:28] &gt;&gt; you can fix anything.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; There's hope.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is hope and there is grace.
[42:42] So it's a prayer meeting. So even if I
[42:44] would want to be long, I can't. You know
[42:48] me.
[42:49] I have a quote here and I thought it was
[42:51] very beautiful. It says God's grace is
[42:54] like this. Let me tell you a story in
[42:56] ending. God's grace is like this. One
[42:59] time there was a mighty king and this
[43:01] mighty king had a son and it was his
[43:03] only son. And one day a murder killed
[43:06] that boy. And through that kingdom went
[43:10] the delegate hunting for that murder.
[43:12] They finally found that murder and when
[43:15] they found him they brought him him and
[43:17] imprisoned him and when they did
[43:20] when they did a trial was set a sentence
[43:24] was made or it was a terrible thing. He
[43:27] had murdered the king's son and he knew
[43:30] knew that was coming to him. They put
[43:34] him into the inner cells. They locked
[43:37] the doors. They put pet on it so no one
[43:42] the gods around it cuz we know what kind
[43:45] of a horrible punishment that boy was
[43:47] going to receive because he killed the
[43:49] king's son the royal king's son sons
[43:53] guts was placed all around the door he
[43:56] was put in inner cells stripped with
[43:58] nothing but a loin cloth on and there
[44:01] was he was s there in a in that
[44:04] condition starving wouldn't give him
[44:07] nothing to eat He was sitting in that
[44:09] condition.
[44:12] Then they brought him out to a trial. He
[44:15] was found guilty and proven guilty. A
[44:17] sentence was me.
[44:20] Yeah. To be executed under horrible
[44:22] capital punishment. He was to be killed
[44:25] by inches until his mortal life was
[44:27] gone. Sentenced by the judge. He was to
[44:31] and he was to die. And he begged and he
[44:34] cried and he said through I am guilty
[44:36] though I am guilty I'm sorry that I did
[44:39] that I wish I had never done it I'm
[44:41] sorry that I did it in a moment in a
[44:43] rage of temper I did it I didn't mean to
[44:46] do it in that way
[44:49] one day the king went down to the place
[44:51] to visit the the boy to tell him talk to
[44:54] him and tell him about the killing of
[44:56] his son the only son he had he had
[44:59] killed that boy he said I'm going down
[45:01] to talk to him And when he went down
[45:03] there, he looked back in that cage like
[45:06] a cage animal. He saw his little skinny
[45:10] body laying back there in a corner
[45:12] crying. His face all sunk in. His jaw
[45:15] sank back. His eyes way back. Matter was
[45:19] all in his eye and his mouth was all
[45:22] wide over. No water. Thirsty laying
[45:24] back. There was his face crying. The
[45:27] king said, "Stand up." He come to him
[45:30] and he looked at him. looked at him and
[45:33] said, "Why did you kill my son? Why did
[45:37] my what did my son to do
[45:44] to you?" Sorry, just English is not my
[45:48] first language as you can see. What did
[45:50] he do to merit such a death as you kill
[45:53] him, stabbing him and death with a
[45:55] spear? He said, "Nothing, my lord.
[46:00] Not one thing
[46:04] was just my own impendance, just my own
[46:08] ways. I kill him because I was jealous
[46:11] of him and I got in a temper fit and I
[46:14] kill him. Said now I am to I'm to die
[46:18] under your justice here. I realize that
[46:20] I deserve to do it. Only thing I'm
[46:23] crying for that I'm just sorry that I
[46:25] killed that royal man like that without
[46:28] a cause. The king turned on his heels
[46:32] and walked out, went out of the desk and
[46:34] said, "Destroy the records."
[46:37] You know, put him into the sea of
[46:39] forgiveness. Destroy all the records.
[46:43] Wash him up, clean him up, and send him
[46:45] down a robe for him. After a while, the
[46:48] great big limousine drove up to the
[46:50] door. When it did, a carpet was spread
[46:53] out of the prison cell. The king stood
[46:55] to the end at the end of the limousine
[46:57] and said come my son and ride home with
[47:00] me to the place put the king's robes
[47:03] around his shoulder he said from
[47:05] henceforth you are my son
[47:09] because he had pity that's grace that
[47:12] was me that was you killed the son of
[47:14] god with our sins we were alien dirty
[47:17] filthy laying in cells of our will God
[47:21] washed us by the blood of his own son
[47:24] and cleanse us. Put on a robe of the
[47:26] Holy Ghost. And now the great chariot of
[47:28] God will back up to the door someday and
[47:32] we'll go home to live with him. All
[47:35] records are destroyed. We can be judged
[47:37] no more. Bend them. Burn them up. He put
[47:40] them in the sea of forgiveness and
[47:42] remembrance about it no more. No wonder
[47:45] we can sing amazing grace.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; All the records have been destroyed. If
[47:53] you laid your sin,
[47:54] &gt;&gt; if you pray and if you pray for
[47:56] forgiveness, that sin that is there, it
[47:59] get destroyed and then you can worship
[48:02] God again.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Let's just have the musicians.
[48:06] There's no reason to keep living in that
[48:10] condition.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no reason to have a hidden
[48:12] sin
[48:13] &gt;&gt; because man,
[48:19] &gt;&gt; his nature,
[48:21] &gt;&gt; he's going to clean you.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; He has to. He promised and he's going to
[48:26] do it. Amen. You can't stay in that
[48:29] condition. Even if you try to hide it
[48:31] like David,
[48:33] &gt;&gt; he thought that everything was sweet.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:36] But man, God, he made him ensure that
[48:40] his son
[48:42] was clean.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing Amazing Grace and then
[48:47] we can call Ben our pastor.
