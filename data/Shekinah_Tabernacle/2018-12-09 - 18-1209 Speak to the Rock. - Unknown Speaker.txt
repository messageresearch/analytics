school praise the Lord does he have any young testimonies or something on the Hat we're gonna extract one this morning at least one don't make me point fingers probably'd bless you Saints just a quick one I was standing here I think it was last Wednesday maybe last Sunday and I just dawned on me the true definition of undefeated but I have to come outside the topper to show you because you've got two feet and there's under that feet in this under that feed you undefeated the devil is undefeated we we are undefeated because the devil is under our feet undefeated I mean you'll never think of that word again ever ever that's it it's done under our feet do you mean Amy that was that one you no one else said why not should we just move on oh it's a Brahman actually I just think about subtle this morning because you know with the um probably most of you saw yesterday we had a big gang presents the side that way and this one that way and there was shootings last night in there and I just thought how so many people in our community are living in fear and these people in fear today you know thinking about yesterday or people walk around and they have fear and there's different things and I was thinking all the devil has to offer you know and people fight for him and you know all it offers and I was thinking about how blessed we are and what we fight for and in what we have and I was just thinking about the play actually and I was thinking what a blessing it is because we're going to invite our whole community and you never know there's people that you know there and stuck in these horrible places and these horrible situations in our community and I was thinking they might just come you know and they might actually they will they will hear the truth though hear the words of eternal life and they'll see that cierra living truth and men you never know they might there's this one house and Stokes valley you know there's one place that people could come that's a safe house you know and it's actually like a Goshen in the middle of this horrible thing that happens up and down the street you know in these horrible situations and the Lord's here and I was thinking man then from that play you never know that the Lord might just actually draw some children this little light of mine I'm going through this shining if you got do you have one brother okay it's like that you kind of get it started and then you've got to eventually try and stop it I praise the Lord just on that sister Bronwyn has touched something that happened recently and my boys will be witness to this under my feet so we the Bride of Christ we walk on this earth but sometimes how we this is at Easter might happen we went to the skate park and we were just skating the on the skate park and there were some young people coming around and they started skating in amongst us and and they were swearing because the young people do and kind of being just disrespectful and you you lived with the thing is do you say something or do you not say something you approach these people because your kids are they and stuff you know and and how do you go about it because a lot of thing that happened with the Bride of Christ is is we want to show God but we don't always wanted to say it as it is because we skate we might shake someone off you know like keep them away from the Lord or keep them to to to curse at the Lord which we don't want to do we don't want to ski somewhere away from the Lord we want to get them closer and so I was skating and I heard the the swear words going on and I thought you know what other right as a Christian to go up to these people and just ask them please don't do it what they do with that is up to them on the Lord and that's between them and the Lord but I'm gonna go up in anyway and just and just tell them sorry I scared it up and stop next to the guy almost wiped out next to him I couldn't get up quick enough but and so as I was there he saw me I'm kind of falling I said anyway listen sorry I almost wiped that view but I just want to ask you a nice thing you know my kids are young and and I know you guys you know you're swearing a bit and stuff which you just might not swearing because they don't need to hear that and he and he straightened me apologize to said you know what I'm very very sorry and we won't do it again and they really tried not to do it again and then they went on and they skate and they were really nice around the boys as well but she had to do something to make him just see that that maybe what I'm doing is wrong so it wasn't judging this the sinner it was just judging the sin and and because you approached him with love you had a reaction then later on they was there was five gang guys that came in like like gang the type of guys you know all in a huddle with bicycles and they started intimidating these boys that worthy because now all of a sudden it went from an ice skate park to this is my domain and now me and the boys are just skating around they witness to this and we just go on like we always do another stage you could see every day was this atmosphere something happened something changed this is not holy and fun and nice anymore now this is something going on you and the young people that was the first started feeling real uncomfortable and they they started leaving but then again I'm I'm just sitting here thinking but there is more to this that meets the eye so I skated up to that guy and I stopped right next to him and I say these words are you local and he goes yeah yeah I'm local I said my name is Almonte what's your name and he gave me his name when he says what was his name Ruben a Denis is all my name is Aidan I said hey Aidan how you doing and and I made all five of the other guys that were there just for mischief and I started but but because I disarmed them I didn't like the devil get rain over that because cause what happens is these are atmosphere bolt and then it's not us against you type of thing instead of just saying listen we're all in the same boat we all live in this earth I just want to tell you it's more to this first it meets the eye so instead of going to say hey you guys are making trouble and get out of you and stuff like that which you you can't do if you want I just went in Greek to them and say what is your name cuz god kid so when I was in the world he came and see what is your name and then he started talking to me and so five minutes later they leave you know and everything turned into peace and this is what the bride can do we don't need to to come and review people too tightly wrong and they right we just stand on the word and we just go anyways and God will do the race and for me it opened up because sometimes because you guys know I get very spirit that sometimes you kind of want to attack the sinner in the Sun at the same time instead of just speaking to him like a normal person and let God do the work so yeah if that's the only revelation about this last week that's that's it glory to God I'm impressible to like it it's good amen let some stand and sing just a few worship songs this morning just to change the atmosphere slightly before our brother Ben comes up to minister well start with this one we don't sing it too often but I think we all most of us know this one it's called um forevermore [Music] [Music] you put

the in Isaiah 32 a man praise the Lord he is our Rock amen good to have everyone here this morning a man I trust you know let's just rejoice amen John 7:37 John 7:37 down to 39 it says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water not a trickle not a drip rivers of living water but this he spake of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified amen oh let's go to Isaiah 32 verse 1 to 3 a man who loves the Lord the sporting hallelujah amen we are the happiest people in all the world just can't lose being a Christian you know one day we're going to step on the rock and take a rapture hallelujah amen Isaiah 32 and 1 it says behold a king shall reign and righteousness and princes shall rule and judgment a man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind and a covet from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock and a weary land and the eyes of them that see shall not be dumb and the ears of them that hear shall hearken hey speaking of me wholly speaking of you I mean let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer gracious Lord Jesus Lord we're excited Lord because anything can happen in your presence Lord anything could happen father now Lord we thank you that you are the rock and Lord we are standing now in the presence of you Almighty God just pray father you would anoint your word as speaker and hearer Lord the devil is a liar nothing will hold us back Lord not even our own humanity so father I pray Lord just take dominion Lord and we thank you that we are undefeated

away further doubts and frustrations may there be cast to one side Lord and may we just lay hold on the promise of your word father in Jesus Christ's name may you grant it amen amen god bless you all you may have your seats this morning I want to speak about this morning speaking to the rock now you know we have you know I was listening and will and we'll get into it but you know brother Brown speaks about the you know he speaks about a broken systems about how you know we don't just have a local revival but we have a revival that's unending it's not just that's filled with local rains eurotech that sort of range but we have the fountain of living water gushing forth and there's a force and the believer I trust is a force of the Holy Spirit you water is pouring out life was pouring out you can't contain it you can't stop it it just comes hallelujah and I thank you that we have a rock you know King David it's amazing when you just search through the scripture and you and you look about where you're how many times that the believer would obscure to God being a rock and he would say we just got a few I don't have it on me on the slides but and and second Samuel 22 and 2 I'm just going to go through these quickly he would say you know now David we know he knew what trouble was he knew what hardship was he knew what being in a very tight situation where life and death was there yeah he knew what it was like to be in distress but he knew was like to have a rock I mean to have a shield to have a defense you know ever with a god that would anoint him that he would fulfill the word for his day and so in second Samuel 22 and 2 he said and he said the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer the Lord the God of my rock and him will I trust he is my shield and the Horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my Savior they'll say with me from violence David you what it's like to you know being violent times second Samuel 22 down 32 he says for who is God save the Lord and who was a rock save our God the Lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation the God of Israel said the rock of Israel spake to me he that ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of God holy and in Psalms 27 and 5 from the time of trouble we know this is from the rapture you know the tick's that brother bran would preach the rapture message on you know Sam's 27 and 5 from the time of trouble he shall hide me in his provision in the secret place of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock hallelujah Psalm 28 and one unto thee will I cry O Lord my rock be not silent to me lest if thou be silent to me I've become like him that go down into the pit Psalm 40 and verse 2 he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings hallelujah so now we can we can just see from these scriptures you know we know understand that God in order for God to be our rock he must be a revelation to us because Peter was young jesus said to Peter upon this rock upon the revelation of who I am I trust these things are not common to you I mean but the the river of Who I am and in the season that you're alive upon this rock I will build my church so there's a rock as a firm foundation it's not sand it will not move according to storms or or troubles but it's a firm foundation where Jesus would give the parable of yo yo you know the man who built his house upon a rock but in that probably says he dug down until he found the rock and then he built this house you didn't just say well there's rock somewhere he dug down got rid of the dirt and the soil whatever maybe the loose sand and stones and then when he hit bedrock holier then he cleared off the bedrock he built his house and then the storms came in the house was still there hallelujah and that's what we I'm so glad there's a rock I mean in this weary land we're living in the presence of the rock you know I was moved oh just thinking about this Oh God the rock is here you're here huh Lou you are the rock and we're and we'll show you that Paul says that the that the rock that followed the children of Israel in the wilderness was Christ there's not just a piece of stone whatever whatever marble or quartz or whatever rock I'm not a geologist but you know whatever it was as Christ right so now it's in that parable he dug down till he found the rock and he built his house but that but the and wise man just builds his house this is a nice piece of land and then the storms came and the house fell and great was the destruction of the house we don't want to build our house about our lives upon the shifting sands of man's ideas or the shifting sands of culture or the shifting sands of of what's acceptable we want to build our house upon the revelation of the Living Word of God for this day which is description right this message is the rock I mean where God has come down in the center you think this is a weary land there's a desert Amos 8:11 said that there become a famine in the land not for bread or water but for hearing the word of the Lord why see they say there's not a famine for Bibles or churches or theology but a famine would come for the hearing of the word of the God honor of the Lord the true interpretation of the word and many would run to and fro that would not find they would fight for thirst but I say thank you lord I didn't find the rock the rock found me hallelujah when I couldn't know where to go the rock found me and maybe we chased a lot of mirages you know you know on the horizon looking for water looking for this rock but the rock found you hallelujah that's why we can rejoice say thank you Lord you found me in this thing amen so now David you what I was like you know he knew his Lord was the rock and I'm so thankful that when it goes beyond just being anointed many everyone can be anointed but it's those predestinated ones God's attributes upon the earth they built upon the rock right and when it goes beyond anointing and the United Church you're not listening to your favorite preacher or your favorite song and you may be in just in the world you know going about your daily life but there's a rock you're built upon right when everything is gone you're there and you're upon the rock I mean I'm glad that we can you know I believe I'm looking at people that whose lives are built upon the rock of of the word in this day hallelujah that we can stand amen because we're build upon the rock now if we go to I think I put this on here so right here we go and we'll go back that's why I don't like slides cuz page 1 never stays page 1 page 2 becomes paid shipping you know just you know so anyway so he says moreover brethren so this is this is the Apostle Paul speaking about the children of Israel you know journeying from Egypt into the Promised Land is more of a brethren I would not that ye be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat but me and all the drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ so he's saying that this rock followed them you think about this they journey they turn around there I thought that rock formation was back there no it's following right that's following oh yeah I mean wouldn't that be you know I don't know yeah I'll just leave that but the rock was Christ as more than just a rock the rock was Christ have followed you know followed them so they had this fountain of water followed them they didn't leave it it went with them now we know that when you know Israel they just looked to the natural eye they just like look like a bunch of ragtag people just just doing a migration and Moab didn't think too much of them you know Balaam Balaam that you're Moab hired Balaam to come and curse them and and they both had the same alters Balaam and Moses had the same approach to God so fundamentally they were both believing in the same God they had the same worship to approach him but one group was staying in a bland they were fixed in a land Moab they weren't moving they had their borders this is our nation they were staying they had their organization they had their king natural king the Headley government right the Headley denominational system right they were stuck there but then suddenly but there was another group they didn't have a nation they didn't have boundaries yet right they were journeying but they had a swing Rock they had the brass serpent they both have prophets Balaam was a prophet Moses was a prophet right there so they bowed their prophecies you know they had the same approach to God but one group had a smitten Rock one group had the brass serpent one and the main thing that they had was the shout of a king was in the camp I mean the Kings word was there among Israel that was the main thing hallelujah so they had all that you know they had the Messiah walking among them bagged Christ right Moab didn't have those things and that's the thing we got to look at now there's a lot of churches around nothing against them but you we need to be in a place with a smitten rockers right with a brass serpent us right we're the shout of the king is in the cap where the word is present we're going to be in that kind of place amen I thank God by this message we have the smitten rock and then we have the brass serpent right it's all Christ right we have the shout of the King the Kings word Amen where you know with a voice of a king as there's life there's peace hallelujah amen so now the rock is present you know I trust that yo if this is all you get out of the service he's present you were to speak to him look right you can't just sit back and say well you know and that's why you see the devil always tries to silence people tries to make them just a piece of marble you know a tombstone that they won't speak to God that the other ways tries to silence you you got to speak and you got to speak because if something's going on in your life and you don't speak it forth it'll remain there and the devil takes up residence but when you expose him expose what you're going through expose the mind battle I mean that's why we should confess our faults one to another right I'm going through this and I'm going through this and you speak to a real genuine believer they don't judge you they don't push you down they don't condemn you there's something in them because it should be a liver I mean a liver you you should ever liver but a river of living water right if Christ is in you and you as a fountain of living waters right so we are all here one for another it's not necessarily what you can get us what you can give you create the atmosphere you sing your dance you shout you say Amen you pull on the word you say yes Lord Here I am to worship Here I am to praise you yeah I need to give you glory Here I am to say Amen hallelujah and atmosphere has changed amen it's not always this area the volume of the Amen but the the faith behind it I mean the pull of faith hallelujah Amen so now Allu yeah now as we where were we so Moses was commanded as the numbers 20 take the rod gather there the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it's young and it shall go forth as water so it shall go forth his water he shall give forth as water not it Amen that's Christ hallelujah and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their Beast drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded them no didn't put it there but you continue reading he didn't speak to the rock he smut he he smoked the rock twice cuz you're in his anger he said you bunch of rebels tried to bring forth water for you and he said of speaking to her off he smote it twice speaking of the two crucifixions of Christ right he was crucified once in a body for our sin you know in the scripture but then the word because he is the word the word had to be crucified again and the word has been crucified in this day now when the seven seals came and when the title deed came up and that was revealing Christ and Christ udders isn't as full manifestation all the word is open brother Ram says what other seals the seals reveal Christ because Christ is the seals right you say well I thought it was horse riders and there's horse riders in this tribulation yeah and there's 144,000 but you got to see beyond that because many people can study the word say well that's the Antichrist riding forth yeah sure it is but behind that it reveals Christ right because the anointing that sent forth to combat the the the four moves of the Antichrist those anointings as the anointing God released in the age to overcome what the devil is doing and that's what you should be you're the first are mothers of the seals I saw horse riders in tribulation the next time it was different I just saw the lamb step four I saw my redeemer step four with an open word saying you belong in this word and that's why my voice has called you in this hour hallelujah hey hon you glad yeah as I see it I think last Sunday you read the word you're here message and then you hear it again and something else jumps out at you because God he's like an onion he peels back layers right it's all onion all it's all word the same way down but it gets deeper and richer and better amen yeah yeah I know that's a crude way yeah that was church he called Jesus an onion yeah I hope you get what I mean though I know it's a crude way of saying it but you just don't just look at the outside they're gone again there's always more this is eternal hallelujah and it gets richer and deeper and greater so he he actually smites the rock but in there so so now the rock smitten and water comes out so now the rock was smooth in that day on Calvary so we're so Isaiah 53 where it speaks of your he was wounded for our transgressions of chastisement of our peace was upon him by His stripes we were healed there was a prophecy forward when Isaiah saw it but then its history it happened it was manifested in the flesh right so he doesn't have to be smitten again you read this you know had to smite the rock oh it's already smitten you just need to speak to your rock speak to the rock and it will bring forth what you need right speak to the rock that's why you can't just sit back and be silent no speak to him Amen speak to the rock and it will bring forth water for you if you need salvation tonight speak to the rock there's brother band speaking Redemption and completeness and enjoy he says if you need salvation tonight speak to the rock it'll bring forth its water if you're a backslider tonight I'll say this morning speak to the rock it'll bring forth its water if you're here tonight 'm without christ you've tried every church there in town to find salvation speak to the rock it will bring for that's water you believe it if you're a backslider got away from God you think there's no chance for you just speak to the rock and it will bring for this water you believe that with all your heart you believe that God would granted with all your heart you believe it hallelujah he's here tonight I say he's here this morning if you're sick and you've tried everything in the world you've tried to get in the prayer line you can't get in the prayer line you've had prayer cards turned down you went from one meeting to another if you've been anointed by the pastor you've gone through this prayer line you've been everywhere else and you can't get healed why don't you speak to the rock now he will bring forth his water that's right I mean the rock is present right the rock you just got to speak to him life and death ISM power of the tongue the scripture tells us now many times we think of how our tongue will affect others but your tongue will affect you right you have to take the word and you have to speak it you have to confess it it says in Revelations 12 that they overcame him there became the dragon and all of us devils and the other angels or the fallen angels they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony that's how they overcame and those people that are written in Revelations 12 is you right because the devil's been cast down in this hour right the bottomless pits open house come upon the earth but there's a people standing up on this work on this earth and they are the Word made flesh and they overcome by the power of the blood by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony so they have to start testifying of something right and they do not testify of what they see and they themselves you look in the mirror you get disappointed right let's be honest you look at yourself and it's not maybe you're aging and things are expanding necessary but you look at your character right you get disappointed and things you see and your things and you wonder why you know whatever but and then what happens as you start to you start to get focused on those things and you begin to ponder those things and your words will become flesh I mean your thoughts will become our thought our word as a thought expressed right so now you begin to think it then you'll speak it to someone and then it'll become manifested in your life someone is ways- and down-and-out they become that way it started somewhere right they weren't born that way there we have all good sides and bad sides to our character what side he gonna pander to brother Brahim had an interview with a sister Bruce and it's and it's in the message you can hear it's not very long and she's wanting to know she you know she's asking brother Branham I need you I need to find out when did I receive the Holy Ghost and she's expecting that he'll see a vision and you know point back in his life because God showed him what's been and what will happen why so it comes before you know and and and she says that interview well there's just nowhere I can put my foot on right now I met him and and and and brother Ben speaks to us is well your nature you know you get burdened for someone you pray pray pray pray until the answer comes and God uses your nature that way and the devil uses that same nature against you because we're a nature this is you know like any gift a gift can be used or a nature can be used a good way like someone who's a mercy you know God built them that way they're very merciful they want to help people but the devil can use that same nature against you right this is you know you got to know about yourself because the devil knows about you you know or someone who's a perceiver you know more that way they can see beyond and see what's going on well God can use that but then that can be used against you and the person right you got to know where to shoot right this is not carpet bombing you know you know what I mean you don't just blow everything up you know so it's like someone who can see something well you got to pray until God gives you the answer that that person can receive a way of escape you can't just say that's wrong well that doesn't help me it may be true maybe 100 percent true but you got to give a way of escape right so now sorry so so he says to her well your nature God uses you this way the devil uses you this way and she's like well I nee and she's looking for stability when did I receive it and and he just asked the question to her or one day your life was going this way and then you need turned around all you want to do is serve the Lord who did that and you hear oh she says Christ and and he says there it is there to see one day you're doing this then and then he turned you around there it is you go listen to it it's so simple sometimes we want to we're looking for something big and we've met him there's a devil you know there's the problem we have this gun and never overheat it's guided amen and it never runs out of ammo right it never does and it doesn't get here me to carry you understand but so the devil so so we're fully equipped if you have the Holy Ghost you're fully equipped to overcome the sage the whole armor of God is supernatural right and if you have you been if you've really been born again you're nature's changed you see him living out of your life overcoming every day becoming more like Ken becoming more like the word that's what I mean by to go more like him you're equipped right but then the devil tries to get it you know tries to tries to make you think no you're not even ready and then and then you get in your mind well I've got to go back to this starting position and now I've got to start all over again in some way with no the believer who's crossed Jordan who's come out of Egypt who's come out of the world who's been cleansed of the desires the things he once loved you just there's nothing in you to want it anymore and you died to yourself there's something that you had to give over hallelujah and you cross Jordan you've come into Christ right now you're in the promised land well the enemy comes against you because you still got this nature right this this is why this body's got to be changing I think that's why we're going to rejoice winners changed thank God I'm not carrying this thing around thank God that this is caught up with my soul hallelujah and so now you're in Jordan I mean I mean sir so now you're in the promised land then the enemy comes against you then sometimes I think well I've got to go back here again and back into Egypt you understand no you've got your gun you understand we asked we are undefeated we are undefeated hallelujah hey we're on defeat where wherever we are in the land we're undefeated I mean and that's why we don't just shout sing although all the promises are over Jordan oh you crossed Jordan right and now you're in the Promised Land you've got your weapon right stand on your god-given privilege don't don't go back and say well I'm not I don't have it in me to overcome the stuff he's the overcomer in you right he caused you to overcome the world because you'd overcome in the wilderness because you'd overcome yourself and cross Jordan and then you're on the promise that he's you overcome around you I'm saying this because you know the devil fights us and he's gonna kick and he's gonna kick and he's gonna kick until he burns he's gonna keep kicking and the more he kicks you should say hallelujah because he's fighting me I'm not on the side I'm not his prisoner he's kicking just kick him back how're you gonna take the word brother NGO there's a vision or a dreaming and that you know the devil is coming against someone and and and and the guys getting more scared and scared and the devil got bigger and bigger yeah and then finally he picked up the word hey just forget say boo you know and then and then everyone swore that he disappeared you gonna say boo devil you had a look who's gonna blink it's like a game of chicken he doesn't have a gun it's like game of chicken he's trying to intimidate you yeah that's all it's old talk he's just nothing but a shadow he's nothing but a bluff right here I had to put up with anything he says I mean you've got the gun he don't never go he doesn't have a sword the Prophet said his back was broken at Calvary if you've ever seen an animal with a broken back they don't have too much control and they're in a lot of pain and their victory you think about in the scripture a day with the Lord one day with God as a thousand years upon the earth so only two days ago Jesus died and and and and Jesus resurrected it's just a couple of days ago it wasn't that long ago the blood still there amen the sacrifices being given it's still fresh hallelujah it means it's not a long time ago it happened and so it's still just as potent and I even may say this it's more potent it's more potent because in this hour people are going to be translated from this world to the next world and then we're not ordained and gone to the grave or a day to take a body change hallelujah you know what we're gonna take a body change for those Peaks we're just attributes of God attributes just like your children are part of your father's they're attributes of you that's why you're looking to their gorgeous faces and say I see my character there amen I'm sorry children you become your parents some of you are saying no sir you'll find out yes sir vital all you are well there's a new birth anyway but you know but but they are attributes of us they're part of us and God looks at you he sees an attribute he sees a part of himself buried you know you're you're a buried and flesh and it doesn't matter what the outside was doing there's that scene in there but there's that attribute in there it just has to come to life holy it's got to come to life and that's what the rapture is God finds all of his attributes carry some home holy amen isn't that wonderful we're part of the word comes to the word right the living word comes to you the word and it makes the word in you alive with the woman at the well I will come to her laters we're gone to that yet but she was an attribute she had to become alive watch his part the word that had to be quickened amen no life and death is in the power of the time that's why we should our testimonies should be God's Word is true and we believe it not you don't testify what the devil's doing oh he's got this and this is happening that may all be so but a testimonies evidence right you're giving evidence and your evidence should be the my rock is my refuge he's my salvation he's my healer he's my redeemer he's my Savior he's my deliverer he's my shield is my Buckley he's my guide he's my husband he's my bridegroom he's the lover of my soul he's my Redeemer he's my sustainer he's my keeper he's my high priest he's my blood a man he's my he's the one standing he's my intercessor is my mediator hallelujah he's my all and all he's the very life of my being hallelujah that's what our testimony should be he's my help he's my God he's my shepherd amen I trust he's that to you you know it's so amazing when you really know someone well it's more than just knowing about them you know them and you know has he shepherded you through some dark places has he guided you as he comforted you as he healed you as he redeemed you has he kept you hallelujah I'm so glad he's that way isn't he wonderful I mean he's out rock hallelujah I'm glad he's not some big piece of stone that's been molded by human hands and human tools he's a living God hallelujah now as I see it so so the rock has been smitten he's got to speak to it for water to come to you as a season romans 8:28 and we know all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate I like predestination then you like it I like election I like it because you know if I'm elected I'm going to be there if I'm predestinated to be there I'm gonna be there we say well how do you know you'll produce there and I'd say jesus said all the father that has given me will come and then all that come who I'll no wise cast out right so the devil just a waste yeah this is big whoa it's not for you you know the devil speaks from his own experience do you know that it's not for him right hell was prepared for the devil and his angels right so he has a place he hasn't expected end it's not it's not a you know it's not in the New Jerusalem upon this earth right hell was made for him and his angels and that's why he says it's not for you heaven because heaven is not for him he got kicked out he speaks to you of his own experience he wants you to believe his experience amen oh it's not for you it's not real you know you know he's not he doesn't really love you well the devil doesn't know anything of love he's just a servant angels the servants you know do this do this do this you know this is not part of the family we're family with yo-yo we're the family of God so the devil tries to give you his experience it's not for us not real you'll never make it you think you're good enough that it I don't know you know you say devil that's your testimony this is my testimony right and the end of my testimony is I'm there eternally you're gone oh yeah just read the end of the book that's a good chapter holy and they all lived happily ever after that's basically what's gonna happen who's the all us in the Lord hallelujah amen I'm glad okay and whom he did foreknow he did also he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so he is so he so to whom he foreknew so he foreknew you right and he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of a son which is his word so he predestined us to be conformed to the image of his son his word so he knows before yoyoyo before there was anything in his great mind he thought of you and when he thought of you he says now they're going to be become my word in the day an hour in which they live Allu yeah I'm glad moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and to whom he called them he also justified now this call is not just a big call going out there's an individual call right like the Peter James and John come follow me right it's not just a great big call no this is an individual call hallelujah whom he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so who's been called and you know you've been called you got to speak to the rock so don't just sit there you know even if you're up to here in the world I'd say Lord I'm cold you've called me you know they overcame him by the blood of Lemonwood are they testimony you know when you testify when you speak it it becomes real to you right you've got to really say yes and and and confess the word for yourself so if you've been called then you've been justified right and and you know brother Bram says true justification is you never did it in the first place and you got to go what where is the first place the first place is what God thought of you and his mind before the foundation of the world so what God thought of you perfect sinless redeemed nothing held against him whatsoever without spider cool washed in the blood of lamb that's how he thought of you and if that's how he thought of you that's how you'll be manifested upon the earth you following me hallelujah so if we have been justified that way then who can lay charge now that's to whom he's all justified them he also glorified it's already done then you know them he also glorified so this is a finished yeah we just catching up to the scripture you following me it's already been spoken daughter II thought we're just catching up to what God said we would be oh you got to speak to your rock say thank you lord I've been sanctified thank you Lord your holy spirits for have been filled thank you I being justified by your grace amen now he so if what shall we then say to these things were in Romans 8:31 if you're there if God be for us who can be against us that's a good question if God is for you who can be against you he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things what shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us not against you for you a meant for you who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword and he keeps going down nothing can know nothing can you gotta speak to your rock right well what's the best way to do it quote his word back to him Amen that's why you got to do amen brother brems says and this is a broken cisterns in 1964 he says if you are sin sick speak to the rock if you are weary speak to the rock see it looked like it would be anywhere it looked like if there was no water down little places there were Springs there wouldn't be order up on that mountain but the rock God does things just backwards from what man thinks the rock the driest place in the wilderness he said speak to the rock today people are so to see if they think if they can go and say their prayers pay some priest and say a few priests for them and pay their way through they'll just build some big church somewhere and some rich man will sponsor it go on living and lust have somebody else pray for them he thinks that's it but God don't want your filthy money all the thing he wants is your devotion in your life to speak to him God has given you money don't spend it for things that satisfy if not spend it for things that satisfies but to bring real satisfaction you'll not get until you speak to the rock he brought forth life-giving waters without money or without price that's a perfect parable of their in this wilderness they they never had to pull dig pump or anything just partake of his provided way freely that's his word why they didn't have to dig it out of a pond they didn't have to pull it up with a bucket they didn't have to win lit down with it they just had to partake of it and that's all there is now you don't have to join nothing you don't have to go down at the altar and work up something pump it in you don't have to say a word over and over till you get a confusion of language the only thing you have to do is partake of them freely guys provide away no pumping no pushing no nothing just take of it freely nothing you have to do just partake of it that is just believe that's all I can say that's all I can say to it you never had to do anything for it you never had to dig for it you never had to go way down cry all night you they just partook of it it was smitten and ready that's right I'm looking at an old man nervous I'm sitting here in the back of the room I remember telling that to an old telling that on an old bath stall one day by a manger and he said but I'm no good I said I know you're not and I said I'm not either but I said you're looking at what you are quit looking at what you are and look at what he is we're going to keep doing that right even if we've been sealed into the kingdom you ought to keep you know we're saved by grace and we say Amen our walk is by grace divine insulins upon the heart and its reflection in the life right that's his doing so stop looking at what you are quit looking at what you are and look at what he is I say that's the same thing for loved ones and family quit looking at what they are and start looking at what he is right he said if I could just get rid rid of these cigarettes brother branham I'd be a Christian he said don't get rid of them you're trying to get good and then come to him you never come I mean sorry he never come to save good men he come to save bad men that knowed they were bad he said well listen you don't want to go to hell do you he said no I said well you don't have to he died that you might not have to go he said what do I have to do I said nothing it's just that simple he said but if I could ever I said there you go back to that cigarette again quit thinking about that cigarette just remember think about him what he did what he is not what you are you're no good and you never was and never will be but what he is he's the one and I said now the only thing you have to do as if if he took your place down there you just willingly accept what he did only thing you have to do is accept it why he said it's simple I'll do that and I said here's the creek and I boarded him up here and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ some of his people are sitting here and I know they felt funny at me for doing it I knowed what I was doing I'd seen in the man something that was genuine see something that was genuine in him I could see it there and I took him a baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus and when they did that it wasn't long till after that I was down it to a son's house and I'd seen a vision of a tree being broke at a certain place and a man fell almost broke his back took him in the hospital and that night the Lord revealed to me that that was the end of the cigarettes so the next day he wanted some cigarettes I said I'll buy him a carton and take it to him you just watch and see now this is a prophet knows what he's doing okay so if you're thinking why would you ever do this he knows what he's doing okay his cigarette days are done he never smoked one since never wanted one since God see the first thing you've got to do is come to that fountain amen you've got to come to that water realize it's nothing you can do it's what he'd done for you once that's why I said to the me say well that's quite a contrary you know why would he tell the man there's nothing you can do no you just got a partake of it right you've just got to believe his word right and then that faith will fix you right faith in the word will fix you you know because many times we people think well I'm no good I'll never you know I just I've got to do this and then I'll become a Christian no you become the Christian then that'll go away right you've just got to take him at his word right and the faith you have in his word will change you that's right this power and receiving the word by faith well how do you do that you say I believe it right more than just and he say yeah that's true I believe it and you'll watch it now if you and if you've really received it by faith you'll see the word have an effect in your life and will change you Olu you see you don't have to dig you don't have to pump out you don't have to quit this you don't have to quit that the only thing you have to do is get there and drink right that's all if you're thirsty drink now he was the rock God smote him for us and he gave forth abundance of pure clean water he does yet today to everyone that will believe this is as grace of course to his people as there's something like that the people of today ready to receive what they can get but don't want to give any service in return Israel was ready to drink from the rock now but they didn't want to give God his service that was jus him and he's always giving us a service you know we can't even breathe without him we can't breathe without God's service that's how dependent we are on him and yet it's almost practicing too if we if we have to do something for him he gives he asks us to do something go see somebody go pray for somebody go help somebody it almost breaks us up to do it but we don't want to do anything for a service now so he says all you got to do is drink of the fountain right but you got to speak to the rock to receive the fountain right now in and Jeremiah now I'll try not just see how we go but in Jeremiah is very outstanding Scripture I think Jeremiah Oh God is speaking to Jeremiah says hath a nation change their gods which are yet no gods but my people have changed their glory from that which does not profit be astonished o you heavens at this be horribly afraid be very desolate saith the Lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and have hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water so they have changed he says they have forsaken now now this is this is incredible we're a people would would subsidy they they first forsake God that brought them out of the wilderness that the rock that was spinning brought forth fountain of living water and they they substituted that by a man-made tank that they your system is a man-made tank so instead of living by the fountain you know a great artesian well I think it's one under pitoni it just comes forth there's a great big you know a reservoir of water I think even under the seabed down there it just pushes forth right why would you substitute that with a tank you build and and then you soak so just imagine you're living in batoning there's the fountain there on the street you're living in this house here and you decide no I'm not going to drink from this fountain there's nothing wrong with the water it's pure it's clean real good tasting natural there's no man-made contaminants in it right nothing from the pollution the air can get in that water it comes forth but you build a house over here and say I'm gonna have my own tank I'm gonna have my own water tank right here and and you build the guttering and you build the tank and it can ever look so nice this is modern this is the latest material this one will always give you clean water this one is dependent upon the local atmosphere upon the local rain efile me if it's raining you'll get water if it's not raining the tank will run dry and you'll start to worry right so you're so so how much water you have is based on your situation and then you've got to clean the guttering out I remember well I remember my dad doing it when we were young as we had rainwater tanks and Gisborne right so I have to clean the guttering out you got to clean the tanks out once in a while right so everything that falls on the roof washes into the gutter and gets into your water so a bird can poo up there all kinds of things can happen right it'll go down you know some people out of their tanks they get dead rats and did things well cause it died up there and ended up in the tank and that's how people are with the Word of God they they they said of having the true fountain of living water appear interpretation of the word they make their own tank of theology and then depending on local rains to come and fill it and all kinds of wiggle tails and dead stuff gets in it and they drink that water right why would you substitute now if we will you know if we were standing in Pretoria and say well this man built this but he could have this you think why didn't he stay with the tank I mean why did he why did he go with the tank and not with the artesian well say well you know and he would have his argument but ultimately you say that's foolish he's got this water why I have this man-made tank right we don't have a man-made tank and you to personally be tapped into the great fountain of living water right because even you can make your own message system and it will break and leak by adding man's ideas to it it'll become a man-made religious system a tank but he says that they have hewed themselves out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water so could hold no you know it just leaks we aren't called to have a broken cistern religion hallelujah we are called we are called to have the fountain of living water the Word of God ever flowing free ever rich deep and cold and refreshing that's what we're called to have I mean we don't have to you know you know a tank you've got to have filters because stuff gets into the water you've got to do all kinds of things you know but you know and and Brother Bear calls it a strainer rank it doesn't need so so so the artesian well it doesn't need a strainer rag rag to take the parasites out for it's coming so deep down there in the rock until there's no parasites there amen don't have an educational rag hanging on it some worldly made system of manmade denominational wisdom to tell to tell you before a psychiatrist whether you're able to preach or not don't have one of those filthy rags hanging on it and a push right off as soon as you put it on there because there because the waters bubbling forth right out of the great artesian well hallelujah you can't do it that well is bubbling up all the time if you'd put one of them rags on it and throw it plumb out to the other side of the other that don't have no time for a denominational rag on it you don't need no filter no strainer no pumping no jerking no nothing else it's just there bubbling up it don't have it doesn't have to depend on local range to fill it up rains or revivals we're that fountain that's at the fountain of life where the carcass as the Eagles will gather you don't have to pump up a revival you don't have to pump up nothing the other thing you have to do is just has just come to the fountain it's always good a fool it's always full of good fresh water there's no end to it it just keeps bubbling you don't have to go to the cistern say well if it rains and washes off the barn I'll have something to drink is here's my mind not this that artesian well spreading forth good cold water all the time you can depend on it you don't have to say well I'll go to this old cistern I used to drink out of it and it hasn't rained for a long time I tell you it may be dry that's the way some of these man-made systems are you go in if you've got something big something great big caboose selling something or some kind of something going on big parties and things during a Bunco games parties in the basement everything you might have find a full house but we you go to where the fountain is bubbling up always the people are there getting them a good cold drink of water you can depend upon it say well they haven't had a revival for ten years if you live by that fountain she's always got a revival going on amen like the little Welshman I mean one time when the Welsh revival was going on some great dignitary came from came from the United States and now some great doctors of divinity and they went to the Welsh yeah I mean I mean they went to Wales to find out what was going on and they had their turned around collars and and and their plug hats walking down the street and a little cop came along you know whirling his little billy club in his hand whistling down at the cross where my savior died down there for cleansing for sin I cried dear to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name so they said that seems to be a religious man will go ask him and I said mister he said yes sir he said we're here from the United States we're a delegation we've come over here to investigate the Welsh revival so called we had doctors of divinity and we're here to look at over he said we want to know where the revival is and where it's held he said sir you have arrived I am the Welsh revival amen the Welsh revivals and me that's where it's at that's the way it is when you live by that fountain of living waters that's living all the time bubbling over and over and over and over and there's no end to it and we not go and see if some water you know if we've had rain not long ago it's not it it's the fountain of living water it gives us water free you don't the put rags in it to find out some educational rags I mean you don't have to depend upon local range to fill it up or local revivals it don't have to do that for it's the power and as the purity is within itself that's where the word is its own power hallelujah so we don't have to if you're really built into that living well if that living fountain is in you pushing forth living water you are the revival I mean if he if he becomes a living reality to you I mean you don't need a local revival to fill up some tank that you've made I mean but he is in you pushing out the water he is then you're pushing out a spirits here's any pushing out the word hallelujah where you don't get dry and thirsty its bubbling that's coming forth you can't stop it hallelujah and that's why those who really see him in their day I mean they will they will become one with the fountain and in the scribes and Pharisees the rock became flesh in Jesus Christ right he was a shadow now he's the reality he was the fountain of living waters right and those who looked beyond the veil of a man from golly look beyond he's more than a prophet but he was the Messiah I mean those who really saw him in the day the Word made flesh and their day I mean they became one with the fountain hallelujah that they just didn't talk about God and you know this happens and this has happened that they met him right and it's so vital that you see him in this day where the message is more than just your healing or supernatural or prophecy but the Living God has come down among us he's opened his word to us he's spoken the Living Waters coming for hallelujah amen that's right isn't it those those who see him in their day they become the revival hallelujah and it's and it's the same thing today cuz God doesn't change right God hasn't yahoo when brother Brown died Jesus didn't leave the earth the mighty angel didn't go he's still among us right he's still among us in his word he's still among us living in and his people hallelujah and that's why I certainly on the Vail right when you look beyond the mouth when it becomes more than books and tapes in the Bible that becomes Christ living person in your presence right and not in not in the past I mean but living now hallelujah the woman at the well knew of a historical God she was now living in Samaria and she went to Jacob's Well she was living by a man-made well it provided water but it was a man-made well then say at the woman of Samaria so I'm just dropping into the story I'm going to show you this then say at the woman of Samaria unto Him how was it that thou being a jew asketh me of a drink which I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans jesus answered said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given the living water so you got to speak to the rock if you really knew who's present you'd say give me this water give me this water I'll never thirst again Allu you and the woman sit under sir that has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water art thou greater than our Father Jacob which gave us the well and drank there himself and his children and his cattle see Jacob a man Dugard jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again because as a man made well but whosoever drinketh of the water I will give him shall never thirst but the water which I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him Sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come to draw I was dropping down and then they began to speak about well you know our fathers worship here the Jews say you should worship worship in Jerusalem they get all religious it wasn't enough she needed water you know I had to go beyond just talking about while they did this and they made this church here and this is history what about today because she is actually sitting in the presence like she asked him are you greater than our Father Jacob and here's the God who spoke to Jacob it's far greater than him but now he's so and then and then finally it comes down to a point where where you know she says he says to her go get the husband he's the Fountains gonna go speaking and then she says well I don't have a husband and he says you have said well if you've had five and the one your worth is not yours you know I'm married and then she says we know where Messiah cometh he'll do these things so those are now the big big big big junction in the conversation right because she's mad and look beyond we know we're Messiah cometh so so she heard something and she sees well this looks like it but then she um he he just sees under her he that speaks he that's Jesus said under I that speak unto thee a.m. he hallelujah and upon this Camus disciples a marvel that he talked with the woman yet no man said speak if they'll or why speak it there with her the woman then left her waterpot you're gonna lure to drop your drop your drawing device from your sister right she had to
