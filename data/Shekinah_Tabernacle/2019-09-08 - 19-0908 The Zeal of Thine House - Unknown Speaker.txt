memorial service back home and for me it's it's been a tough couple of weeks because as a few you might remember it's this time of year again it's been two years very short time that's my brother went away he went home and for me it's one day and then the date is falling day at home and then on the Saturday we got the news of mr. Chappelle's grandpa and I know what it's like to not not be there and to miss to miss those important things and then on the Sunday night I got in my car after church and the first messages popping up on my phone that cousins dad passed away of a heart attack suddenly he went home and a few days later my friends and Flagstaff they lost their daughter charity there's no there's no answer is that we as humans can have when it doesn't seem to be just an explainable thing you know something seemed to be explainable car accidents and natural death and sickness you were already you were kind of ready you understood but a lot of things are unexplainable when I was listening this morning and whether Erin McGarry was taking the service I just really touched my heart and he said for us as Christians just there is no there is no premature death and I really believe that there is not one moment that Satan can steal from your life there's not one day that he can take you early said God has a purpose for your life when your purpose is over so precious in the sight of the Lord is the death this Saints thing and that Bible verse didn't give any reason why a death would not be precious when you're one of God's and that really just helped me this morning charity sisters sang this song and I I don't know the music so I'll just read you the words said I may have moments of unbelief but I don't let it worry me it's just a feeling that comes and goes my head made out but my heart knows my heart knows jesus loves me and washed my sins away I knew he will keep me [Music] no matter where my head is at I will not remove cuz my heart knows the truth Satan will whisper try to to see to make us doubt what we believe but we know better we have God's Word it's in my heart safe and sure my heart knows Jesus loves me and washed my sins away I know he will keep me I will not cuz my heart knows the true waves of doubt me toss us to and fro oh but we will sail on this [Music] my heart knows Jesus loves me and washed my sins away I know he will keep me oh no matter where my head is that I will not be moved coz my heart knows the truth my heart knows Jesus loves me and washed my sins away I keep me no matter my heart came and God bless you sister I mean that was truly special and even that's the code that we serve is our friend is our father or mother I mean it's their first through our darkest

all this morning I mean great great to see each one here praise the Lord Amen let's um let's just go straight to the scripture so just a reminder we um with our fellowship lunch next door Amy and praise the Lord so it's always good together I mean let's just read from I want to read from Isaiah 59 and and verse 16 down to verse 21 we got three three places to to read this morning Isaiah 59 and 16 and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness and sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversary's recompense to his enemies and to the islands will he pay recompense so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of Lord shall raise up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turned from transgressions and Jacob saith the Lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon me and my words which I've put in my mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed there out of the mouth of thy seed seats at the Lord from henceforth and forever amen let's go to John 19 and we're gonna read a couple of verses here John 19 verses 4 & 5 and Pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold I bring him forth to you that ye may know that I find no fault in him then came Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and purple robe and Pilate saith unto them behold the man let's go to John let's go back to John chapter two that's all I trust will will tied together as we as we journey on John 2 and verses 13 to 17 and the Jewish Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and changes of money sitting and when he were when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them out of it all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and seed under them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father's house a house of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house has eaten me up I mean this bear heads in a word of Prayer gracious father we want to thank you we can gather as a people Lord redeemed washed in your blood new creatures and you our God and Father want to thank you for the zeal of thine house dear lord I just pray father you take this little thought and multiply it Lord I pray father you would quicken your word to every soul father I pray Lord that we would Lord we would be changed Lord we wouldn't Lord we're not here just to go through a religious motion or to fill up time on a Sunday morning but Lord we're here to be in your presence law that you would move us O God your change us Lord your transform us father so lord I pray we would walk out of these doors changed transformed father may you meet every need oh god father may you cleanse us of our secret faults Lord may you anoint your word - speaker and hearer Lord just help us to all get ourselves out of the way you can come down anoint the Lord the faith in our lives O God may you grant it for your glory we want to pray father or Lord also for those who are away be their portion Lord be their strength bring them back to us for those who are second body father may you touch them Lord heal them thank you by your stripes they were healed my lord and father we just pray Lord that you would receive all honor glory and praise in the service and Jesus Christ name Amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning I want to take I want to take that from that last Scripture we read the zeal of thine house has eaten me up now we read here that you know we read in Isaiah how-how-how there was no man those do wonder there's no intercessor yet and then so and then so here came this one he was he was you know he was he put on the breastplate as righteousness helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak and when we read about here here when this when the scripture was was fulfilled I mean here was a man that Pilate was was trying to wash his hands worth and there he was standing and and he was he was robed in a purple robe oh really he was robed and zeal you know the cloak that he had Alma's ill and he was there to take care of his house I mean he wasn't worried about the political system he wasn't worried about what was going on but he was there for his household he is there to take care of his house I mean another word zeal in the in the scripture it means a it means that jealousy it means properly a heat something that's burning something that's got life it's got energy Amen it's not cold it's not it's not frozen it's not stuck it's it's burning it's living it's consuming I mean it's a it's a it's a it's a fervent mind it's a jealousy it's an again nation it's a zeal and that zeal ate them up and when something eats some someone up they can't control it it takes over their life it consumes them that your dominates the other word the word you're eating me up it means to eat up that is devour so the zeal of us house of that house ate but consumed to me couldn't you know he couldn't just sit back and watch what was going on it drove him you know it took over his thoughts his emotions everything his whole objective all of us everything he was doing it ate him up he couldn't contain it something who said something just yo just beat on their mind they can't rest until it's done I mean that was the kind of zeal I mean that he had he couldn't rest and just watch this house his father's house be a house of merchandise I mean he couldn't just stand there and say it's just all about buying offerings and and you're making money and cheating people and you know that wasn't the purpose of the house of God the purpose of the house of God is God will come and dwell among his children God would be there I'm in between the cherubims and the Holy of Holies I mean because you know you're the Israelites we know when Solomon dedicated the temple the pillar of fire came down Wynton a hallelujah above the mercy seat between the cherubims and there was such a you know you know there's such a cloud came down that even the ministers couldn't the priest couldn't minister no more God came to his temple and it was glorious and that was the purpose of that building is that God would be there I mean that people could come and bring an offering and their sins could be forgiven them I mean they could have fellowship with God I mean it's like Henner and the Old Testament she came she had a burden she had a zeal I must have a son and she went to the right place she went to the Tabernacle in the wilderness where God was and she wasn't deep she didn't care what other people thought she didn't care what others were saying what others thought about her she didn't care about them she had a zeal it was eating her up I need a child I must have a son I must have a child she didn't care hallelujah and when we get to that place we don't kin or more what this person says what this person thinks who cares about what others think what does God say what is God purpose I mean I think we should be so gripped I mean when we come into the house of God God what could you do in this service what could you do for me you can change my life in a moment hallelujah we should have be so gripped with the zeal of his house hallelujah just like I was sharing on Wednesday with your you know a showing of Papua New Guinea brother Ronnie who is the translator and the convention is so gripped he said he said the word is so powerful yes I moved and he went and he went and testified to thee to the Pentecostal brother the pastor and then you know and I shared the other part is my brother Robert had the dream that he is going to come into the church the next day brother Ronnie when testified to him brought him in I mean to the church God gripped him and now seven churches have come into the message because someone was moved someone was gripped I don't know if he expected that to happen but it happened to him hallelujah that should be the same thing with us we should be I don't know what you're gonna do God you can do anything in this moment of time you could change my life forever you can change how I think change my outlook then I'm no longer negative and downtrodden and feeling down but I'm positive I'm happy I'm rejoicing cuz I know the word is true and it will be fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah that's why I think you ever let the devil poke it down your throat that Campbell just be can't you go back to be normal how does he know he doesn't know I mean but you can be so moved that your life can be changed forever and it could be the same thing I mean even now I mean we're not cool just to come to church and go back to our old ways that's not what it's about and we had changed from glory to glory to glory by the Word of God from glory to glory to glory hallelujah so I think we should we need a greater expectation you mean well I've been in the message for years well this is another moment this is another season hallelujah so it means it's something that so so just just googling the meaning of the what you're eating me up it means to devour something that dominates the thoughts of someone completely that's when something eats you up it's not just part of your life not just something you do sometimes it's eating you up your assume you're gripped I mean you can't shake it you can't get rid of it you've been you're being apprehended just like the Apostle Paul's II thought I would apprehend that which has every hindered me I mean so the Lord apprehended him on the road to Damascus now he's reaching back saying Lord I want to pretend you I want more of you hallelujah amen now they in the other Gospels yo this this event is recorded on the other Gospels but it never just like for example in Luke I'll just read it Luke 1945 and he went into the temple and began to cast them out that salt therein and then that bought saying unto them it is written my house upon me is the house of prayer but you have made it a den of thieves it's only in John's Gospel that Eagle anointing that was upon him that is actually quickened to the disciples that's the zeal of thine house which is caused us to happen so it's more than just the outward what was going on but I could say something gripped them it gripped them I mean when the Lord came hallelujah it was the zeal of his house but you see now we aren't you know when when when well maybe let's just go through a few things we know that the house of God is not a building made with hands you know you think of when when the apostles were were there and they were with Jesus in Jerusalem and and his disciples said to him and in mark 13 and 1 he says um one of his disciples said unto master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here so they were saying master look how great those complexes look how great the temple is and really if he could have seen it he could have said you don't know what you're talking about these aren't the stones that are marvelous on the side of Lord they just human the cat stones put in the building I mean but he could have look at them and could have said no you're the stones you're the you're the habitation I mean of God you're the place where God dwells you're the place where God is going to be palaces not just your the building you know as Azimut season x7 he says who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob but Solomon built him in house howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands as say at the Prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will he build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest and it so you know he's asked a question so you know he says yo man men built Solomon built God a house and God was willing to be in that house but that wasn't his final destination that wasn't his final resting place that wasn't his final abode I mean but you know God doesn't dwell do you think about it God says I made the heavens you look out there the great the great pictures we have in the heavens down the galaxies and the nebulas and all those things because I made those things that's my throne I mean earth is my footstool is where I put my feet but where's the place of my rest he's I made all things but where am I gonna rest partly he could have rest it anywhere they said no where is it and and what he's saying he's actually putting out a question to humanity hallelujah where's the place of my rest and there should be something in the Bride of Christ saying in here and my soul is your resting place and me is where you dwell hallelujah amen so you know so the house that God finally dwells it is not a building of stone but it's people so when we talk about the zeal of thine house has eaten me up we're not talking about a building we're talking about a people we're talking about a people there should be a zeal something that consumes us for the house of God I mean for the Bride of Christ we should be gripped it should dominate our thinking should dominate our thoughts you say well that's the ministers job it's not just the minister's job I mean it's mums job it's dad's job as brother's job as sister's job and there we should be so gripped I mean here's the habitation of God's dwelling place amen this is what God you know you know think about it the devil this civilization is the devil's achievement me and brother Andy were talking when we're here whatever night that was you know this is this is the devil's achievement out here this is the best he can do and there's nothing in the bride that wants it and may try and distract us but it's all shiny things and we see it's Hollow it just rings hollow there's nothing to it there's no substance I mean but you know but that's the devil's achievement and the reason he's put it out there is because now God has his achievement upon the earth a mirror people where the book has come up into them cause inheritance is no longer sealed has come unsealed I mean he's placed it into the hands of the people hollar he's made him in his image I'm in hallelujah whereas achievement what the Ephesian I should have became but they looked at and relaxed we haven't just looked at and relaxed we have become and we William just looked at the land and see that's a good land we're in the land and when we're cross Jordan we're taking our mountains am i taking out heritage hallelujah so you know this is God's achievement God's achievement is that people would vanish amen this mortality will put on immortality I mean by the Spirit of God that's within you the life and you will quicken your body how am I going to go on a rap you have God dwell in your soul I mean that life will change you so when we're talking about a house as I've seen it's a people see Paul would speak of Moses in Hebrews three he says wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house fullest man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses and so much as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things as God and Moses Valley was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after perming but Christ as a son over his own house who Hausa we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end so here he's saying is that we are the Lord's house I mean so now here he was I just want to take you back to the moment of of you know here's Jesus standing before Pilate he was there as a man he was a guy he was fully gobby as a fully man he had to be that way in order to pay for our Redemption and here he was he was done before his accusers he is fulfilling the would of god what a Oh was the zeal the joy that was set before him was you redeemed and it gave him a zeal that consumed him amen he doesn't want us like the temple was made a house of merchandise things were traded things were bought things were sold you know there was just a religious form going on money-making scheme you know the devil just wants to make us a house of merchandise I mean he wants to put his brand upon us he wants to put his logo upon us he wants to put us his thoughts in our mind and consume us and you know but we just become a house of merchandise a mirror a dinner of thieves or how can you be a dinner thing so if you have a bunch of Devils in your den of thieves I mean but we're not called to be that kind of a person I mean we're called to be a place where God dwells I mean we're not a house of merchandise we're not just something that's just here to have a religious form forget the form forget religion it's not about religion it's about knowing Jesus Christ hallelujah according to his word this is relationship this message brings relationship Talya with the Lord Himself I mean so now so we don't want to be a house of merchandise and we should be zealous just like you're a cane ask God am I my brother's keeper he was his brother's keeper amen but it's more selfish about how he looked before God and he was right so he killed him we are our brother's keeper amen brother won't see a thing going on you go and pray for that person I mean you go lift them before God don't Gossman talk and run them down now lift them before the throne of heaven I mean what's gossip done for anyone has it helped anyone man no so why why continue if we continue doing the same things we'll get the same results I mean but that's why that's why this is not a Reformation I mean the Reformation produced denomination I mean but this is transformation time this is legal anointing time is where God comes down and carries the people away hallelujah I meant it you know we should have a zeal for the house of God I'm not talking about these four walls only but we should say this is our church this is not my church this is our church amen I trust your borden yeah I mean yeah you're behind it this is where I fellowship and it's not about the name on the door that's irrelevant who cares about it we just need a name because you know where do you go this is where I go maybe we just could have put an address here what yeah whatever but you know it's not about a brand or something no this is this is this is us I mean we should we should be behind it we should be invested I mean and it's not about the building is about the people we should have a genuine care about one another I mean you know many taught you know the Bible says then so I'll probably eat this mixed up like I do do a lot of things but if you want to have friends you got to be friendly the scripture says so if you want to obtain mercy you've got to be merciful I mean so they but they should be they should be such a zeal and you there doesn't matter what's happened to you the zeal of thine house should eat you up in such a way that it should override whatever has happened in the past it should override it should cancel up it should make it actually irrelevant what has happened hallelujah you take the Apostle Paul he was shipwrecked he was beaten he fought with the beasts of Ephesus that was religious spirits and people you know he was robbed he was put in jail did that stop him no because the zeal of thine house he was a man like we mean but he had such a zeal it didn't disable his faith he didn't just go sit in the corner say well it's too hard no here too zeal he had a passion amen I trap I pray God give us a zeal and this wishy-washy age they stand they stand for the word let's have a real gumption why should we just let the devil ride it and ride out I say no we should stand on waters out as you just like Moses are these hideous faithful at all this house and your fear I tried to negotiate I'll just take your old or just take leave your children leave this he says no no no no no everyone's coming no one's staying we're taking our old we're taking our young we're taking our teenagers we're taking your parents we're taking everyone everyone is coming that is coming why Moses because I said they're coming holy that was the zeal here too zeal for the household of God here a zeal for Israel he said now they're not staying in this condition I'm gonna take them out of this place you say well God's gonna do it yeah but God uses man many times we pray Oh Lord just like it used to pray Lord help me get up early in the morning to pray to you and I woke up thinks my realize I've got to get up you know he's not just gonna tip the bed in here I am you've got to get out of bed you've got to put your going to put legs into your face you're gonna put action into what you're praying for a man it's like lord help that person well you know and then we expect Lord's gonna supernatural just get a hold them sometimes he does but sometimes he's like whoa what are you gonna do it should be Lord anoint me to speak to them Oh hallelujah you know I mean you to put legs you to put action into your faith I mean you can't just talk about it pray about it put some action in hallelujah that's how we should be should I mean if we believe it's like an Israel now there's a group of people who are actually resisting the nation of Israel being Jews but not not God will give us the land but they're not doing anything about it and there's those who are actually building settlements taking land you know this I know this is else they're putting action into their faith they're putting works into their faith if you know what I mean because they believe it's theirs they don't just talk about no I want this this is mine it's in here go it to me whatever the opposition you know they don't go and I'll see you in what they think about it first they just go and do it you know I know I'm not condoning everything they do but you know they believe it's this so they're aggressive we want this hallelujah and it should be the same thing with you and I we should be aggressive in prayer though we should be aggressive seeking the Lord Lord I mean he's not an unjust judge he's a righteous judge I mean but it's not just you know cinema you know you're just a simple prayer walking along the road sometimes it is but you know it's not just look you do this and walk on though you should seek Him that seeketh shall find him that knocketh him that knocketh Lord look help me Lord help me in this Lord those seven churches that came in just now into the message they are praying for 12 years that God would come and visit them and when they heard the message they're all in tears saying this is what we've been looking for twelve years seeking God winds are going to happen God knows when it's going to happen hallelujah amen that's why we know we need a we need some yeah I'm not saying you don't have it we have a rule determination real grit it's the size of the fight and the dog not the size of the dog in the fight how they it doesn't matter on just a little old thing you know no it doesn't matter what size you are David just looked like a little old thing going to fight Goliath but he got when he saw the Philistines there and Goliath he got mad how dear this uncircumcised Philistine come on my land come on my inheritance how dare he come down here he came into Judah that was David's he just got mad how dare this devil come stand on my land and the devil's nothing but a bluff why didn't glass just go okay boys you're afraid let's go charge no because the devil just came on the land it's here boo and for 40 days boo and uh and a narrow afraid and in this and in the most unlikely one came along he's just he's just Oh bang his dead David go take food down to your brothers in the battle he's just obeying his parents it's a good way to start you want to see some Devils kill children start obeying your parents hallelujah he's just he's just he's just he's just serving the body and then that same challenge that was going on for 40 I fell on the wrong ears and the zeal of thine house he got angry why because Ezra was being held captive by this bluff by this devil hallelujah Goliath was his armor was brass what does brass represent divine judgment so that weapons the armor of glass was already judged by God to be worthless and useless and defeated hallelujah and David got mad how dare he do this who is this uncircumcised Philistine and he starts to testify around you know and then why didn't what and everyone else just rally around him SiC him David God's with you obviously you got something we don't Sikkim David you know as amazed I was reading you about Samson the men of my camp I come in what part of Israel three thousand of them came to Samson and said we're going to tie you up and give you to the Philistines three thousand men that's an army three thousand men we're coming to the champion you know coming to the champion of it of Israel that was that was created that was in the land to destroy the Philistines three thousand men and then and then what happened they tied him up and they took him to the Philistines and then that's when and it says that the Philistines shouted at him and the Spirit of God came upon him hallelujah I pray when the devil comes against you you just feel anointed I'm not putting up with his nonsense he must die sorry sorry for the enemy shots against them he gets anointed he breaks the bands of the rope he picks up the jawbone he kills a thousand of them now my question is three thousand a thousand three thousand and God's anointed champion against you know three thousand his rights Samson God's anointed champion against a thousand Philistines the math doesn't add to me why didn't they just rally around and say Samson God's with you hallelujah you killed the lion you've done all these great things the anointing still with you we can see you're still separated to God I mean we're just rally around you let's take them what was wrong the zeal of thine house hadn't eaten them up there are more worried about trying to survive then then take back their god-given rights we are not here to survive I mean it doesn't say to him that survives I'll van to sit on my throne as I said that on my father so no as to him that overcometh Amen if there's an overcoming there must be a battle there's got to be a contest and when your faith has got to be tested it's got to be tried I mean it's got to be on every angle the devil's going to fight you sure he is a man but you're going to recognize you're made to be an overcomer I mean you're anointed amen to overcome this age to overcome everything upon this earth you are made to overcome all sickness all disease every weapon of the warfare of the devil you are anointed to overcome it I mean you've got to believe it you're not here to lose your hair to win and then we're here to walk out victorious hallelujah amen the overcomers what at you it says when yo John is there in Revelations 5 and he's and he's looking and he sees no man is worthy to take the book and he's but then he's yeah yeah one of the oldest is don't wait John one of the other for the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed that would prevail means to wrestle with and overcome so he wrestled hallelujah but he won amen and then he steps forth out of the eternity takes the book and opens the seals it changed John's whole life and because he now here was a man amen that could redeem us he was a man that could restore us and that was the same man they leaned on the bosom upon in the days of his earthly journey it changed us whole oh and brother Bram says if we could lay aside our sinful thoughts this morning that same Lamb could go come all the way from eternity to you hallelujah that's why the devil gets a so caught up and while Monday I've got to do this I've got to go here I've got to do this and I wonder what's happening in this and this news thing and a forget about it that's the devil trying to rub you that's the deal you know it seems like the word of God's a seed and it scattered but then the birds come along and eat it and pluck you know that's the devil comes and steals the word out of you how does he do that well you hear the word you rejoice but you don't meditate upon it you go out the door think about everything else it doesn't grow it's really that simple you get caught up in the busyness of this and this and this who cares about that don't take care of itself Jesus says tomorrow take care of itself it'll look after itself it's its own problem you don't need to worry you understand so I don't want the devil to come and take the wood out of my life I want to bring forth a hundredfold I mean that's why you should think meditate upon the word think about it hallelujah who's thought about the Lord and felt just a sweet presence come down you know brother brown says that's angels you feel a sweet humble feeling coming of you that's angels coming in why what's happening because you're thinking about the Lord then the Lord changes the atmosphere as angels come down then he steps in hello yeah and you can't and and once you've been in that kind of atmosphere you like Lord I want to get back in well that's why you bleed in here what you what you meet at 8:00 upon think on things above I mean whatever things are faithful good honest think on those things how lujah why could think it changes it because God comes down so you got to see the value there's nothing to this that is everything to this but you've got to experience it Amen you're that pillar of fire brother and CEO comes down into the meeting that same one is still here he's not a historical God you know there's more visitations of angels pretty much in the New Testament than the old and angels didn't stop visiting people after this book was finished being written amen brother I said we can have visitations of angels in our house where we have God that they could come and minister to us amen that's not pie in the sky that's reality who wants visitations of angels who wants the Lord Himself to come down where you are doesn't matter where you are you can be cleaning dishes vacuuming you can be driving you can be in the supermarket doesn't matter what's around you I mean you've got a focus on him hallelujah because you'll find the more you're in their atmosphere the more he'll change you to be like him I'm in oh yeah by the way I'm said just read this he sees this and um where we going I'm more back-to-front here we are okay I don't think I can count I a page two page three that's how it goes good he says this this is a dedication he sees he sees but when God came to his own temple the church the people when he came to them he filled it the temples that were dedicated just like he did at Solomon's Temple he filled it not with Creed's not with denominations but with himself he filled the temple with his Shekinah glory so he did on the day of Pentecost he filled them 120 temples that was up there with himself with the holy spirit itself the Shekinah glory broke through upon them then then what Nimrod failed to do build a temple that every man spoke contrary to what he could understand God came down and with one Galilean language made every man understand what he was saying and they know that it was brought this is God to his temple God to his dedicated temple not a man-made achievement not what man has done but what God did himself I mean and that's what the that's what his houses it's his achievement it's what he has done brother Aaron preaches the statue of a perfect man and the title is actually wrong he never called it that he says I want to speak this morning I want to speak on the subject now I'm not gonna go into this but but this is what he called it or teach rather if we can building the Living Tabernacle building the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place that sounds a lot better than statue of a perfect man that's what and and isn't that what the word has to do build the Living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place that he would build his house hallelujah I mean so it was Jesus standing before Pilate he was cloaked with zeal because he had a burden for his house amen went to the woman at the well why did he go the zeal of thine house has eaten him up I mean here was one who been made merchandise of the world she had six husbands one I mean five husbands the one she is worth wasn't hers you know the world is made merchandise over turned her into what you know that way but but the zeal of the Lord said I'm not gonna leave you this way you are not going to stay this way I mean that's why he went by the way of Samaria and because her zeal neo zeal can be a big wild fiber can be just a quiet burning flame who's never seen like a blowtorch and and and when it's it just right you know yellow flames is not actually hot as white a blue a blue flame the oxygen mix is just right and it's burning way hotter than the yellow flame and a zeal can just be a quiet burning determination day-in day-out we're pressing the battle we're one day closer I mean the Lord is here he's come to take us away and everything you do is just ye this way the zeal of thine house I mean I care about the household of God Jesus said I sanctify myself not for my sake but for that for this ation that's why he's separate that's why he sanctified himself separated himself I mean it was for the disciples sake and it was for our sake and it should be us you say well I can do anything I want sure but what about the zeal of his house amen shouldn't be that way we should sanctify ourselves we should be separated unto God not just for our sakes but for everyone's sakes hallelujah don't we want to have services with God just comes down and takes over completely I mean don't we want to have services we don't even remember really what happened because God just came down God anoints the minister got an oyster song leader got an oyster worship it just takes over hallelujah don't you want that kind of to anyone that kind of church I mean Sunday and Wednesday I mean don't you one that kind of family altar at home God just comes down I mean you got up in the scripture then you feel to go somewhere else and God anoints that scripture I mean when you pray together God comes down you have a pre-meeting not because and this here you're desiring that he comes hallelujah why is that because you're separated this should be a zeal we shouldn't be caught up in our own things well I've got this to do I've got this this is enough forget those things what about Lord what do you want done may the zeal mate made the zeal of thine house eat me up consuming dominate my thinking my motives and objectives are just because of the zeal of his house not because of selfishness or political agendas or trying to sway people at different things no the zeal of his house should eat us up I'm just gonna hammer the circle it's hammered okay because you know we are this this country is so wishy-washy because we have it too easy amen we'll never run out of food we have it too easy we're not starving we don't run out of water amen we have it way too easy we go oh you know I want new clothes just go buy them you know we don't we're the same thing day in day out take it down to the river wash it put it back on we don't do that kind of thing why we have it too easy and people's lives are so consumed in things that don't matter but when they come to the end of the road then what then what we've got to have a gumption a real wrought yard just a real let's let's let's push this thing through hallelujah amen let's take a rapture amen let's have a let's have a church where God just anoints how was that service anointed what happened I felt drunk hallelujah what happened the word just passed through my soul and just took out all the world I mean what happened I walked in those tongues interpretation cooled out my life I needed it praise the Lord I mean brother I'm said to the church had come to a place where as soon as someone comes in with sin in their lives this should be prophecy and interpretation of tongues it speaks them directly saying this is what's wrong with you make it right yeah God knows all things why are we trying to hide hallelujah you say well you could never obtain that number God wants it and if God wants it I believe if we just yield ourselves and surrender to them say Lord what do you want make it happen I'm just an instrument in your hand do with me what you will hallelujah then he will cause it to happen amen we should the zeal of thine house we don't want to be caught up we don't want to be made a house of merchandise or a den of thieves that's not our portion that's not what we're here now let's go to the book of Judges I'm just going to jump to this and we'll just see how we see how we go but let's go to let's go to judges judges 6 we're gonna read from judges 6 and 1 you say well you're too fanatical I tell you what there are people on this earth there are atheists and they're way more fanatical than me they are way more fanatical about what they believe them what I believe I mean you go to the sporting realm I don't spend my life savings to go to one tournament overseas and that's all I can the bar gotta I've got a you know sacrifice everything else just to get there and the early paint my body blue and sub-zero freezing weather you know think I'm having a great time I don't do that kind of thing that's extreme but the world thinks man that's awesome what's it gonna do and the

played it's not even in history it's not even recording you know we don't even know but in that day all that guy and I won't try and even you know those kind of names they have all the syllables you know but you know it's not even a it's not even a memory it's not it's not popular culture it's not you know we don't play that game but back then all this is amazing I want to be just like them I want to be just like the Lord Jesus Christ I mean I let L you the loudest screaming rejoicing time will be when we get on the other side it's going to be noisy you can't be different because nothing can be damaged but it's going to be a noisy place it's going to be a rejoicing place hallelujah but why not start the rejoicing now and because of your children of the kingdom you have what you need

those things they forget what do you mean you have eternal life and you're having a bad day and God has you in his hand you're a graft in the palm of your of his hand he can't let you go you're part of him and then he he is part of you he will not lose you he cannot lose his elect I'll just be so I'll just say he cannot lose one part of his brain no not one no not one it's impossible to him to lose one of them how less if you believe that you're one of them I just rejoice I'm if he has called you by this word and become real to you I just shout I just be happy doesn't matter what happens in life how they'll say well I have eternal life what's the worst can happen my brother Isaac said you can die if I'm dead I can't be unhappy I'll just be happy hallelujah I just be rejoicing you know why because I have eternal life I can't Pierce no more than God can perish hallelujah I mean it God has invested in his bride I mean if she fails he fails he cannot fail I mean brother Han says he will bankrupt I think it was him he'll bankrupt the bank of heaven before he lets one of them be lost all of his everything he has he will bankrupt it before he loses one of you hallelujah if God is for us who can be against us hallelujah I think we should just be happy doesn't matter what happens what comes what goes good times bad times eternal life maybe put that on your fridge or first thing you wake up in the morning set right I have eternal life the first thing you see Amen hallelujah someone else wakes up in the house I hear amen our mums awake or dad's awake why not we gave all things we possess all things holy and we have the greatest life they can be you know I'll say this this may be crazy well I don't think it is if there was no heaven I'd still have this life amen because I don't have a broken broken marriage broken home bunch of complexes hurts pains regrets we don't have those because God washes it away he makes things new hallelujah I'd rather be have this and be strung out on drugs whatever I would probably be doing because I will pay end up that way I'd rather have this life what do you mean but there's no heaven but this is the best of you a peace that passes all understanding what do you have peace I don't know it's a piece of passes all understanding I can't explain it you can't understand it but I'm feeling peace hallelujah hallelujah what are you taking some you meats or something yeah I I took a gospel and I feel fine there's no side effects I'm just happy you know that's how we should be we have eternal life hallelujah when the devil is not even a memory we shall still be hallelujah glory to God now are we sorry you were there judges one now and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them dense which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds and so it was when Israel had so and that the Midianites came up and the Amalekites and the children of the east even they came up against them and they encamped against him and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto Gaza upon me and left no substance I mean sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor oxen or ass for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it now this word Midian is very interesting and so the same word means Midian which is a son of Abraham but that same word as also a brawling or it's a very a brawling or contingence that's what Midian means and it's actually from the root word of a contest or a quote or a quarrel or a discord or strife so just put it this way when the when the discord came in when the strife came in when the contingents came in what it is Rael do did they stand on their god-given right and say this is my land no they said we're just going to bury ourselves in a cave or a stronghold we're just going to try and ride this thing out we don't here to ride this thing out we're here to conquer every devil we are here we're not here to put up with his nonsense no not one day the zeal of thine house should eat you up I mean God is jealous of you of the godly jealousy he is zealous over you I mean his whole all of his energies is at you hallelujah he's not you're not his part-time girlfriend he doesn't have any amen he he makes a full commitment I'll be with you to the end in sickness and in health good times and bad times richer or poorer I'll be with you I'll be with you in the flood the fire the famine wherever it may be I'll be with you you shall be my people I'll be your God he makes a commitment he doesn't break that commitment hallelujah so we need to have a real and so if he's that way to us how should we how should we respond in sickness and in health richer poorer I'll be with you good times bad times happy times sad times questioning times I'll be with you it pays off to stay with Jesus Christ amen so now so so it's when the quarrels or the contention or the discord of the strife came in and they just said let's make caves let's make dents let's make strongholds let's go hide away we're not called no I just wanna I'm just gonna hammer this for a little bit maybe I should have been a builder we're not called win the win when trouble comes in we're not called you to say well I just can't handle this this is too big I'm gonna quit I'm just gonna I'm just gonna shell it within myself become detach from everyone and become an individual in my home emotionally detached from everything and just shell up and just basically like a tortoise or whatever pulled itself into its shell and you know kind of wait for it to go away that's not what we call to be I mean that's not what we call to be and you see now when these problems in the you know that your other contingents of disc discord and strife coming in as soon as Israel sews the Midianites the trouble came and plucked away so never actually enjoyed amen the fruit of the land because that trouble took it away the discord took it away we are not cool and I just I'm just so we are not called to live in that condition why are we you know so many believers are human shields for the devil because the devil's exposed God shoots them and you're free you know a human shield is a you know they sometimes it's against the world sometimes people maybe even do it you know willingly but we're not caught you know brother and says with the discernment he says you should see the look on the people's faces when the devil knows he's about to be exposed and that's why he hates it amen and that's why the devil hates a Holy Ghost filled Church where the word can come bypass whatever's here amen and God can come and meet your need and expose the devil but now you've got to have a choice eager to hold on to them we should not be you know you say well I've loved them I've lived with him with all these years one why you used to get rid of the guy get rid of the thing you say but I've been harboring this pain for such a long time check it out what's it gonna do what's it done for you and maybe build a bunker well I've been okay maybe I'll show up one day I've been in so so so in Papua New Guinea where my parents were the Japanese had their headquarters for World War two and I've been a news Emeril Yamamoto was the main Emeril over the Japanese forces I had been in his bunker and it's not even it's maybe the size of this room and there's a partition wall down the middle it's all concrete a bunker it's a world war ii bunker i wouldn't want to live in it outsides tropical jungle lovely beaches coral reefs see beautiful landscape where would you rather live in the sunshine eating coconuts and mangoes and yo and you know fishing in all those it what are you living a cold damp bunker we're not called to live in a bunker when I call to look that's a that's a cave or a dinner a stronghold we're not cool just to be oh I'm just gonna know you gotta you have to open the door you have to open the door and you've got to walk out amen you've got actually you know you've got open the door remember as I see it the scripture says you know those that are friend those that have friends show themselves friendly so in order to overcome the bunker you've got to do the opposite of the bunker you have to do the opposite you can't just do the same old thing well this person's got to get me out now you've got to do the opposite you've got to break the cycle you've got to put action to your faith if you believe the law can deliver you of all things step out of the bunker step out of the pain step out of the her step out of the complex you say well but I'll feel silly no that's the devil trying to tell you that I but people think less of me no that's the devil telling you that because it's the devil being ridiculous he he snared you into it and now he doesn't want to be exposed that's why you feel that way but when he's gone you just rejoice I mean there's no longer a bunkie I mean I mean I mean a bunker it's a testimony of God's grace holy and God can use it as a weapon against the devil I'm it's a way why should we come into this kind of state that whenever we try and so oh I'm going to do something different I'm going to try and mean the relationship I'm going to do something more but if you're living in a stronghold that trouble just gobbles it up we're not cool to live this way well I live below your privilege they went God never see to them in you show you shall dwell in caves and Den's and you know no you're gonna live in the land you're gonna live in the valleys you're gonna live in the good places you're gonna live you know you're gonna enjoy your inheritance Allu yeah so what happened the Midianites came in the trouble overcame them it wasn't the zeal of us of their house didn't eat them up it was what the trouble was causing dominated their lives that's why they built they didn't build the strongholds because nothing was going on no the trouble came in that contentions the strife that's why we should never be troubles going to come into every family I mean we don't live in some bubble the devil can't you know if he can't get me he'll try and get my wife if he can't get my wife who try to get my children he'll find a way in if he can Amen he will he doesn't hate you no he's not a gentleman he doesn't take prisoners he's just he's a slicker he'll do whatever he can just trying to get a toehold but as soon as it comes in you know these Israelites were still circumcised Jews living in the Promised Land amen so they were still the children of promise but why put up with trouble we have a right to kick it out but the problem is people bury themselves and other things they bury themselves just to try and cope we're not called our coping mechanism as the Holy Ghost our joy comes from him I mean our joy comes from her me say well I just need to feel happy get in his presence long enough you'll feel happy I mean that start well how do you do that start the signal what song what's your favorite Christian song start to sing it and you'll find burdens left you'll find yourself happy crying rejoicing amen you say well I can't sing well there's there's a lot of good message music on YouTube or something just go listen to that and pretend you're in the show you'll sound awesome and sing away you'll change the atmosphere and you say man I was having a great time you can have that time anywhere you can turn the volume down and be having a shouting time in here walking down the street oh yeah I can't be done or yet can't be done to the wrong places that can't be done hallelujah but the problem is we get caught up the devil always tries to you know he always tries to make us feel down you know you're not happy today you're having a bad day eternal life which one but if he can get you to agree with his thoughts it's gonna take you down a very dark and lonely road of this person to this maybe they did love covers a multitude of sins he did it again well love covers a multitude of sin I've never had to forgive someone 70 times 7 in one day I you know incredible I mean no I mean who's ever had to do that Jesus said you have to do that we don't well we don't keep well we shouldn't keep accounts anyway you know or you're 50 away then I cannot forgive you you know come on you know but you know but we should if the devil the devil can try and get our thinking on his line of thinking he's got us amen all these nothing - this is not real as my parents are just emotionally misses because I raised this way is it amen no that's God hallelujah Jesus Christ is alive amen beer it so people bury themselves or hide themselves in something to try and cope and it begins to eat them up that's the wrong zeal now I'm going to go into this and another time but I'm going to just drop us in here because I was I felt - he sees this I mean I mean this is so there are there are such things today that are on the same power as gambling and drug and alcohol addiction but it looks okay see where's your comfort where's your comfort there's a there's a there's a thing called

than boys and men and it appears to it to affect individuals based on the social media platform use such disorders can be diagnosed when an individual engages in online activities and the cost of fulfilling daily responsibilities or pursuing other interests and without regard for the negative consequences what's that people bury themselves in something and you can bury yourself in a hobby oh it's not all a clone or any device you can bury yourself in a hobby you can bury yourself in your job you can bury yourself in anything and that thing can dominate your life it can dominate your relationships with your family you can dominate your relationships with others that thing becomes first place what is it it's a cave it's a DIN and people can put a scripture you're a spiritual tag on it but it can still just be a place where people have buried themselves cell phone addiction sometimes referred to as problematic mobile phone use as a behavioral addiction thought to be similar to that of an internet gambling shopping or video game addiction and least a severe impairment or distress in one's life it's addiction people have done studies you know there's a there's a part of your brain and it's like the pleasure part of your brain and every time you do something that that you find it's pleasurable it produces a chemical called dopamine and it actually activates it makes you feel good it's a feel-good chemical in your brain and people have found that when people can be everytime people can send a whatsapp or a text or something what what they trying to do is they try to get people to respond and then when they get a response dopamine is triggered in their brain they're actually people actually feeding an addiction now I'll say this now there's nothing wrong with contacting people amen there's nothing wrong but but why yeah people feel lonely and down and within themselves whether people can start texting hey what are you doing what's going on yeah there's a fine line what's your motive and objective is it to feed a addiction or is because you actually genuinely care about the person you know is it about demmer is it about you because if it's about you you're just looking for a hit you're looking to light up another cigarette or you know shoot some drugs it's basically the same thing because it's producing pleasure in your brain amen well what is that why do people turn to such things for the thing we don't drink amen we don't smoke amen we don't do drugs amen but we can be on this and be the same kind of edit nothing wrong with the phone it's the user or we can be on the internet we can be a we can be buried in our job and our studies we can be a bird and say what's that you're addicted and and how's the relationship with your family but this I need a release God is our release brother I see the lid off the pressure get in this presence and you let the pressure off what's happened the devil wants to try and ward us away that we can can't get into his presence no more why honestly all we need more of is the Holy Ghost all we need is more of him he say but I've got this issue in my life give it to him give it because we know we know when things are in us and they read our cage in these complexes and paints we know what it is just shout it from the rooftops this is what happened to me the devil did this to me I hate him I don't want to be a human shield no more I don't want this strife these many nights to get me down no more hallelujah amen so now if we have a zeal listen if we have a zeal for his house we have a zeal for our families we have a zeal for our brothers and sisters now we have the privilege today to apply the token I mean that the life of God would be applied now I'm going to basically repeat what brother Tim preached it you know you know Cloverdale Kemp bases you apply the token to yourself first apply it to your own life first I mean so if you're lazy if you're indifferent apply the token apply the Holy Ghost to your laziness your indifference to your slothfulness I mean we're not called to be slothful people we're not cool to me in different people we're called a Brazil I mean cuz whatever you know you're the world just bombard us we just think well we cannot obtain to anything let's just sit back and watch the world go by no that's not what we're called to do we should have a drive we should have a real Drive I'm serving God I'm worshipping Him I'm loving him I'm walking with him hallelujah we should have that drive shouldn't we have it we say well I don't have that kind of Drive you say God give me a burden give me a burden to pray give me a burden to be a blessing not what I can take what can I give what can you pour into me to give to others that's how it should be I mean we are here for one another we're not here for ourselves or what can I get out of the service though what can I do for others I mean I can produce an atmosphere that God can come down amen if there's anything in God of those people how what were they having hallelujah that's how we should be we should not be inward looking we should be outward looking how can we help our children I mean you say apply that how do you apply the token get on their level become their friends that they can you know one of the things that devil did with me my parents were living overseas in America and some are eyes at boarding school I just thought my parents don't understand me but did I ever go and speak to them that I ever try and help them to understand me maybe they wouldn't understand me but the devil had it twisted in my mind they're on there in another country they don't understand me they don't know what I'm going through what's happening the devil now has broken a lifeline isolated who's ever had those sorts my parents don't understand me I'll put my hands up for everyone basically because you always come to that place in life amen the sky doesn't hoodies you know but they want to understand you I mean if they love you they'll want to try and understand you but you can't if you want to but sometimes we have to make the stip amen it's not just you know we can be crying on the inside for help and you know hey done good what's going on nothing and you can have this big bowl of pain sitting right here he said well I don't know how to start start somewhere how you feeling today pass things what's too big no God can do anything God can do anything God can take care of anything you know we should never just have a front you know I put on my church front today do my hair praise the Lord you know if we need help we need help there's nothing wrong with needing help my help cometh from the Lord I need help I need this help every day hallelujah I need this help just to get to work and to do working to come home amen I need his help one of my biggest praises help me Lord I need your help I can't do this I don't know how to work it out and my brain is too small I don't understand you know so we all need help and he wants to help us he's never too busy he ever doesn't care but the devil says he doesn't care well he doesn't care about the devil that's why the devil says he doesn't care who doesn't care about him he cares about you if he died for you he cares about you he cares for you cast all your cares upon him because he cares for you but then do you care enough to respond I mean so we have the privilege to apply the token to our families we have the privilege to apply it to ourselves I mean to get the slothfulness get the dross get the laziness get the indifference out of our lives I mean we can spend hours on this but what about talking him what about in his word I mean when I first met the Lord and I was single I'd such a burden the Lord just opened the door in Papua New Guinea I was just listening to sermons all the time Oh hallelujah I see eating it up I was printing books I was doing things work because I but I was just you know I don't know I didn't care what my flatmates sort of me I was just having a Jubilee why because there was a hunger we should have that kind of hunger hallelujah shouldn't we is that well that's being too spiritual I don't think we can be too spiritual I mean if you want to help your family just get more spiritual because he'll make your make your nature more like his I mean that then when trouble comes into the house maybe the day before you were you just jumped on the bandwagon but after you meet him and you know you're a spiritual frame of mind your hold on and you can be that you can be the one who's the peacemaker you can be the one that brings the reconciliation hallelujah but we have the privilege to apply the token to ourselves apply it to our families apply it to our house and we should have a zeal and it's not just laying down the law it's producing a life I mean there God comes down into your home hallelujah and then when he comes down then what happens hey hallelujah then then things can change because the void oh you know she'll kick stuff out but don't you stay there amen they should be a zeal Lord I want you to live every day I want you to manifest yourself in my life I don't just want to I just don't want to go from Sunday to Wednesday to Sunday and everything in between no may the zeal of thine house eat me up hallelujah that's how we need to be wish ever we should have such a burden for one another Allu yeah well how they doing and you know asking just because of gossip how are they doing and then you can just get such a burden for someone you don't even know what they're going through and you find out now going through a great big thing and the Lord help them why why do you put the burn on your heart there's a zeal there's a love there's a concern yeah there's nothing wrong with saying I'm worried about you how you doing amen shouldn't we be that way shouldn't we be jealous of one another be jealous of one halation we have such a passion such a burning hallelujah that we want to see I mean when the rapture takes place this place is vacant there's no one left behind that's how we should be I mean it doesn't matter we are the people that always we shed such a zeal for the house of household of God for this bride Holly and I and and I pray Lord the same zeal you have for your bride give us the same zeal give us the same love the same concern hallelujah that our hearts will be Lord I want you to live why are you a Christian I want to see God live amen and if he really loves there's no I in it it's him it's not I did this he did this he's the one who came amen so take your Midianites what happened after many nights came in the eighties and Lord came to Gideon my mighty man of Valor told my mind and he was Gideon so the name Gideon is a fella a warrior but Manasseh of the tribe he came fro means causing to forget so he wasn't living under his first thing he was living under his tribal name he had cause to forget who he was in the Lord and the angel Lord came to him by my team a novella and here he is in the same condition the rest of us rollers he's threshing wheat and Secret in this cave because trouble has come unto the land helliya but the Lord kind of God my might thy mighty man of Valor what me yes you hallelujah that's the same thing with you go on my might my mighty men a woman of Valor hallelujah go on

seal brother and said we need some missionary zeal to push this gospel out through the jungles and I think we need some missionary zeal to push this gospel out through the suburbs into the city hallelujah that's what we need amen so go in my might you say well I can't do it well you know you shouldn't be depending upon yourself it's him that does it I mean but but step out of your bunker step out of your cave or your Dean whatever it is so I'm done with it I'm done living this way hallelujah doesn't matter what others do I'm done Satan we're through it hasn't been fun I don't want to relive it I'm done and step out because the zeal of his house of the Lord's house should dominate your thinking should dominate who you are and if it's dominating who you are what should be your

parents we try to be we want to see our children redeemed hallelujah I mean why why do we treat each other the way we treat each other we want to see each other redeemed we want to see each other climb higher up the ladder I'm in these more up there keep climbing don't just start don't you start the beginning give your heart keep walking up to the Holy Ghost and then walk up into your
