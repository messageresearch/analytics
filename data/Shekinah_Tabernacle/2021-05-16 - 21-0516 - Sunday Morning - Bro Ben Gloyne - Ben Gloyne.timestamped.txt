[8:09] our family there from taranaki god bless
[8:12] you what a wonderful family the milans
[8:14] we love them so much
[8:15] amen sister marti god bless you
[8:19] welcome oh easter she spent a bit of
[8:21] time with us and
[8:22] man why did you believe we had amen
[8:25] um we've got a a prayer request today
[8:29] and uh whoever has a need
[8:32] this is where we bring it we could we
[8:34] could pray the whole week
[8:35] but when we get here and you really have
[8:37] a need we can lay before the lord and we
[8:39] all can pray together as saints
[8:41] and if one prayer can change the heart
[8:43] of god how many more
[8:45] if we all get together and we pray as a
[8:47] family together
[8:49] so um we've got sister deborah walker um
[8:52] she's got breast cancer on both her
[8:55] breasts
[8:56] and we want to come and stand against it
[8:58] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[9:01] if you have a need this is where you
[9:03] bring it before the lord
[9:04] and this is where we pray and we say
[9:06] lord just come now and
[9:08] and take this battle because the doctor
[9:10] he can only do what he do
[9:11] but god brings the healing he brings the
[9:14] supernatural he brings that element
[9:16] where when we get to our end he takes
[9:19] over
[9:20] so let us just bow our heads and if
[9:22] emily has a prayer request
[9:23] just lift up your hands to the lord and
[9:25] ask him
[9:26] to just come in and help where it's
[9:28] needed our gracious heavenly father
[9:31] lord we know that when we pray father
[9:34] your ear is open to every word that we
[9:37] say lord
[9:38] lord we know that when we pray we don't
[9:40] just pray into some ceiling
[9:42] or some far-off dimension father but
[9:45] lord you said we two or more gather in
[9:47] my name
[9:48] there i am in the midst father and we
[9:50] know lord that there we are welcome lord
[9:52] that is where you go lord jesus
[9:55] lord and we see here lord that sister
[9:58] walker lord
[10:00] she's been tried and and lord the devil
[10:03] is trying to put
[10:04] something on her lord we stand against
[10:07] it in the name of our lord jesus christ
[10:10] lord we know that you've done so many
[10:12] miracles lord
[10:14] you have you've done so many wonderful
[10:16] things lord jesus
[10:18] lord and how not more to ask the
[10:20] sovereign god lord to just
[10:22] come in and and lord stand in the gap
[10:25] lord
[10:25] between our our human flesh lord
[10:28] and our faith father lord we ask that
[10:31] you
[10:32] would go to our lord jesus lord that you
[10:34] would go to sister deborah lord and
[10:36] minister unto her
[10:38] and lord we know you don't put anything
[10:39] on someone lord if it doesn't achieve
[10:42] something for your kingdom
[10:43] so lord may you speak with sister debra
[10:45] lord may you help her in comfort
[10:47] and give us strength wisdom lord and to
[10:50] stand in this time lord when the enemy
[10:52] comes in like a flood lord
[10:54] we know that you would raise a standard
[10:56] you're a miracle working god
[10:58] you're an unfailing god you're a
[11:00] righteous god you're
[11:01] sovereign in all your ways lord and we
[11:04] just come before you
[11:05] humbly and say lord who has the words of
[11:08] eternal life
[11:09] who can speak worlds in existence lord
[11:12] who can create only
[11:14] you lord who can heal only you lord
[11:17] so we we just pray lord as the saints
[11:19] all hear lord everyone that has a need
[11:22] we lift the hands up father and say lord
[11:25] come and help us lord
[11:26] come and stand with us lord jesus in the
[11:29] fight lord
[11:30] there's a great fire burning lord
[11:32] there's three men about to throw in the
[11:34] fire lord jesus
[11:35] looks like all's over but lord you
[11:37] waited for him right there lord jesus
[11:40] you caught them lord before they even
[11:42] touched the ground father
[11:43] and everything was just burned away and
[11:46] lord they could walk freely
[11:48] with you and and lord sadhara
[11:53] they didn't care where they went because
[11:55] lord if they had to die they know they
[11:57] were
[11:58] in your arms lord but they knew you
[12:01] could deliver as well
[12:02] so father may we as a christian as well

[12:25] comes over the pulpit today lord

[23:20] amen hallelujah amen
[23:25] glory be to god amen
[23:30] i feel like to ask if somebody has a
[23:31] testimony i don't know why i just had a
[23:33] thought anybody near
[23:35] has a testimony they want to share don't
[23:37] want to put you on the spot sister
[23:38] belinda
[23:39] god bless you i feel like when the lord
[23:42] tells you to do something you don't do
[23:43] it
[23:46] you get in trouble
[23:50] yeah that was on my way this morning i
[23:52] thought lord if someone asks
[23:57] i think it was a few weeks back at one
[24:00] of those meetings we have on a saturday
[24:02] night
[24:04] and brother cuban was there as well
[24:07] and it was just a prayer meetings and
[24:09] you know sometimes you can just think
[24:10] okay lord are we doing the right thing
[24:12] and all this
[24:13] there's all these thoughts happening
[24:15] anyway but he always comes on the scene
[24:18] so one of the prayers was um
[24:21] oh someone says has anyone else got a
[24:23] prayer request and i just hit on my
[24:25] heart
[24:25] i just thought lord i would really need
[24:27] a job and then
[24:28] i thought nice too trivial to ask you
[24:31] know like
[24:32] more i'm more likely to ask maybe if
[24:34] they need someone healing or something i
[24:36] just had it on my heart anyway
[24:38] and then i didn't speak out that prayer
[24:40] request but it was right at the end and
[24:42] then by the cuban prayed that final
[24:44] prayer
[24:45] and he said lord hear also the unspoken
[24:48] prayer requests
[24:50] and my hand just went up like that and
[24:53] and then
[24:53] um and then sister baba came in late
[24:57] on that day on that saturday and so we
[24:59] just spoke to her afterwards
[25:01] i said how was your day you see that i
[25:03] was extra busy
[25:04] why are the receptionists couldn't be
[25:06] there and so she just expressed these
[25:08] things and i said well i can't do that
[25:11] and she said are you serious yes so
[25:14] basically
[25:15] straight after the meeting the lord made
[25:17] a way answered that request
[25:19] and so it took a little while before i
[25:22] actually got to meet the boss and things
[25:23] but on the same night
[25:24] on that saturday night sister barbara
[25:26] was messaging me
[25:27] i sent her my cv she sent it to her boss
[25:31] and i'm starting on the 25th and praise
[25:34] the lord
[25:35] so thank you for the prayers and
[25:40] thank you for the prayers and i know
[25:42] says the baba only said to me yesterday
[25:44] there was a lot of people applying for
[25:46] that job
[25:46] which i didn't know because when i got
[25:48] there for the interview the
[25:50] the boss lady that interviewed me didn't
[25:52] actually express that part
[25:53] um so there was obviously that that is
[25:56] just the lord you know
[25:57] so we just give him the thanks and
[25:59] praises and uh
[26:01] i think my husband also has a testimony
[26:04] it has
[26:06] he has one now it has to do with um with
[26:09] food
[26:10] the lord supplies us with food the lord
[26:12] supplies us with
[26:14] firewood and all these things that we
[26:16] need in a time when we don't
[26:17] have the availabilities to get these
[26:21] things
[26:21] easily but it's his testimony of how
[26:24] that
[26:26] came about
[26:31] god bless you all husbands i
[26:34] put on the spot by the way
[26:39] yeah things have been going well at the
[26:40] um outreach it's been a real wonderful
[26:43] time
[26:44] it's just a triple effect because when
[26:47] you drop the stone in the bucket
[26:48] it's a ripple effect that goes out and
[26:51] it's only those ones and twos that are
[26:52] coming in
[26:54] praise the lord every saturday there's
[26:56] been just an extra one coming in
[26:59] amen and
[27:02] the testimony about food is that when we
[27:05] did the barbecue out
[27:07] side uh the butcher shop the butcher
[27:09] shop actually gave us a lot of
[27:11] veggies from living we know levin is a
[27:14] place of veggies
[27:15] and so we have to give it out to the
[27:17] community
[27:18] and at the same time on the way home
[27:22] there's about three or four cows on the
[27:24] main road everyone's driving around the
[27:27] cows
[27:28] there's poor little ladies trying to get
[27:29] the cows into the driveway so i stop in
[27:32] the middle of the road
[27:33] typical lights on doors wide open no one
[27:35] can get past you
[27:37] and then i have to hood the cows in and
[27:40] then about a week later which was
[27:42] the other day we were talking about
[27:44] firewood
[27:45] talking about food and the farmer rang
[27:49] me up and
[27:50] asked me to come over and he gave us all
[27:53] this firewood
[27:54] heaps and heaps of firewood for free and
[27:57] also the wife came out which i then
[27:59] recognized and she gave us a huge
[28:02] leg of pork so that was
[28:06] good to go towards all the food or the
[28:07] soups that we make out there
[28:10] and yeah it's just a triple effect you
[28:12] know we're the bride we get blessings
[28:15] and i'd like to thank you all for your
[28:17] prayers
[28:19] and just looking forward to a sign we
[28:22] have to get a sign being made up saying
[28:24] the supper room it is still the supper
[28:26] room and
[28:28] i'm just blessed that the church is
[28:31] behind it
[28:32] right financially supplying us with food
[28:35] i'd just like to thank brother ben and
[28:38] also especially brother
[28:40] andy for his input as well he's a sign
[28:43] maker
[28:44] and last night one of the brothers came
[28:48] and most of you had been to to the
[28:50] birthday party i had had met this guy
[28:52] tainui
[28:53] well he came along last night and he
[28:56] fell in love with sister barbara
[28:59] and brother honest right
[29:02] and he called him family it's the first
[29:04] time he comes from a dysfunctional
[29:06] family so it's the first time he felt
[29:07] that this is
[29:08] actually whanau this is actually family
[29:12] and he plays the chauffeur the horns the
[29:14] rams horns and all this
[29:16] and he's designed to come to church

[29:55] amen
[30:02] my testimony is a song so i don't have
[30:05] much to say

[45:16] i'm going to go down to
[45:20] verse 39
[45:27] for i say unto you among those that are
[45:29] born of woman
[45:30] there is not a greater prophet than john
[45:32] the baptist but he that is least in the
[45:34] kingdom of god is greater than he
[45:36] and all the people that heard him and
[45:38] the publicans justified god being
[45:40] baptized with the baptism of john
[45:43] but the pharisees and and lawyers
[45:45] rejected
[45:46] rejected the council of god against
[45:48] themselves
[45:49] being not baptized of him and the lord
[45:52] said
[45:52] where unto then shall i liken the men of
[45:54] this generation
[45:56] and to what are they like they are like
[45:58] unto children sitting in the marketplace
[46:00] and calling one to another
[46:02] and saying we have piped unto you and
[46:04] you have not danced we have mourned to
[46:06] you
[46:06] and ye have not wept for john the
[46:08] baptist came neither
[46:10] eating bread nor drinking wine and you
[46:13] you say he hath the devil
[46:14] the son of man has come eating and
[46:16] drinking and you say behold a gluttonous
[46:18] man and a wine bibber and a friend of
[46:20] publicans and sinners
[46:21] but wisdom is justified to all her
[46:24] children
[46:25] and one of the pharisees desired him
[46:27] that he
[46:28] would eat with him and he went into the
[46:30] pharisees house and sat down to meet
[46:32] and behold a woman in the city which was
[46:34] a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at
[46:37] meat in the pharisees house brought an
[46:38] alabaster box of ointment
[46:40] and stood at his feet behind him weeping
[46:43] and began to wash his feet with tears
[46:45] and had wiped them with the hairs of her
[46:46] head and kissed her his feet
[46:48] and anointed them with the ointment now
[46:51] when the pharisee which had bitten him
[46:53] saw it he spake within himself
[46:55] saying this this man if he were a
[46:57] prophet
[46:58] would have known who and what manner of
[47:00] woman is this that toucheth him
[47:02] for he is sorry for she is a sinner
[47:07] amen let's just pray this morning if you
[47:09] ever need you want to raise your hand to
[47:11] the lord
[47:11] amen as we go to the lord and pray
[47:13] together gracious heavenly father thank

[47:53] give thanks and praise unto your great
[47:55] name for what you've done and we
[47:56] ask that you'd be magnified in our midst

[48:17] lord for this opportunity to be gathered
[48:19] together we always lord want to remember
[48:21] those who couldn't make it today be
[48:22] their portion be their strength lord
[48:25] may your presence fall upon them lord
[48:27] may minister there to their hearts also
[48:29] grant it please in jesus christ's name
[48:31] we ask amen
[48:33] amen god bless your friends you may have
[48:34] your seats this morning
[48:36] i want to speak about being identified
[48:39] in bible characters
[48:41] now it's you know we were we were
[48:44] talking christie and i were talking
[48:45] about this the other day and it really
[48:46] kind of got me going
[48:48] you know in a good way you know
[48:51] it's very easy you know for people to to
[48:54] say yes i would have been with joshua
[48:55] and caleb or i would have been with
[48:57] you know noah and the ark or the
[48:58] disciples or you know it's very easy to
[49:00] you know but
[49:01] it's our attitude towards the word which
[49:03] really dictates what kind of character
[49:05] we are
[49:06] now you know it's it it all boils down
[49:09] to that
[49:10] it's our attitude towards the lord jesus
[49:12] that you know that that that dictates
[49:14] what kind of character we would be
[49:16] webster would give the definition of
[49:17] attitude one of the definitions is a
[49:20] position assumed
[49:21] for a specific purpose so an attitude
[49:24] is a position assumed for a specific
[49:28] purpose that's what an attitude really
[49:29] is you know you can
[49:31] you can have a threatening attitude and
[49:33] what is the what is that position
[49:34] assumed for
[49:36] to threaten someone right because so
[49:38] it's an assumed position for a specific
[49:40] purpose now
[49:41] so it's our attitude we come with an
[49:44] assumed position when we come to church
[49:46] some of us come now let's just be honest
[49:50] right some of us come and say lord i
[49:52] want you to speak to me i want you to
[49:54] change my life
[49:55] make me more like you take the take the
[49:57] weaknesses out of my life mold my
[49:59] character
[50:00] take sin out of my life mold me minister
[50:02] to my heart change me
[50:03] you know that's a specific attitude or a
[50:05] specific position that that someone
[50:07] assumes when they come to the house of
[50:09] god
[50:09] irrespective of the trouble they have in
[50:11] their life the trials the strife
[50:12] whatever's going on
[50:14] you know but but people have a have have
[50:16] that kind of position assumed and the
[50:17] purpose is
[50:18] if we have that kind of attitude towards
[50:20] the lord then he can minister and change
[50:22] our lives
[50:23] amen but then some people come with an
[50:25] assumed position if it's boring
[50:27] when's he going to quit i've heard that
[50:28] before you know what's for lunch you
[50:31] know what am i going to do monday i've
[50:32] got to do this for tuesday this
[50:33] wednesday and they think about that
[50:34] whole week and
[50:35] you know that's an assumed position and
[50:38] unfortunately the specific purpose of
[50:40] that
[50:40] and even unwillingly is you can miss
[50:43] your blessing
[50:44] so we don't want to come with that kind
[50:46] of position the devil wants us to sit in
[50:47] that position
[50:48] he wants us to worry about tomorrow
[50:50] tomorrow will take care of itself and
[50:51] then tuesday we'll roll on on wednesday
[50:53] and you know
[50:54] so it'll take care of itself we don't
[50:56] need to get too worried about tomorrow
[50:58] tomorrow god's got tomorrow hallelujah
[51:02] amen so we can just rest in that so we
[51:04] ask the question now what is our
[51:06] specific purpose in in coming to church
[51:08] today
[51:09] have you have you come with an assumed
[51:10] position oh my you know i
[51:13] i trust our assumed position as lord
[51:15] transformed my life
[51:16] give me a moment in your presence that
[51:18] i'm never the same
[51:20] oh that's what we want so you know i was
[51:22] i was driving you know sometimes i
[51:24] i i dropped the girls off at school and
[51:26] we're driving up carlson hill
[51:28] and you know we all pray around and when
[51:31] i was praying the thought came into my
[51:32] heart
[51:33] this may be the last prayer you ever
[51:34] pray in your life it really made me a
[51:36] lot more sincere
[51:38] you know you know because you think
[51:39] about it because sometimes we just go
[51:40] through the motions and
[51:42] but then that thought just flashed
[51:43] across my mind what if this is the last
[51:45] prayer you ever pray in your life
[51:46] it makes you a lot more sincere you know
[51:49] and
[51:50] because the reality of it is there will
[51:52] come a day when i do pray my last prayer
[51:54] and then i'm done right you know so
[51:57] we've got to have
[51:58] the attitude what we need so
[52:02] we're just gonna we'll just see how this
[52:03] goes today but yeah i trust we can
[52:05] really just enter in because this is
[52:06] more than all the gospels some people
[52:08] just take the gospels oh that's just a
[52:09] story
[52:10] it's more than a story because how
[52:12] people reacted to the son of man then is
[52:14] the same way they react to him now
[52:15] because he's the same god and so we'll
[52:18] find ourselves in a
[52:19] in a character in the scripture now the
[52:21] reason we started you know it's amazing
[52:23] how the how the scriptures arranged
[52:25] we were talking about this brother and
[52:26] paul and brother andy out here remember
[52:28] on friday
[52:29] the arrangement of scripture because how
[52:31] how how the gospels are arranged as a
[52:33] specific reason it's arranged in a
[52:35] certain way that this story is given now
[52:37] and this and then and
[52:38] you know and so it's amazing where jesus
[52:40] was likening that generation
[52:42] to a to a group of children sitting in
[52:45] the marketplace
[52:46] and one group is playing to the other or
[52:48] mourning to the other
[52:50] and and and they're not receiving it in
[52:53] the same spirit it's given him
[52:55] so they're sitting back like this
[52:58] and he's saying that there's one group
[53:00] of children he says we're piped here and
[53:01] you have not danced
[53:03] you know we mourn mourn to you and you
[53:05] have not wept
[53:06] so you're saying this is how the
[53:07] generation is that you have not
[53:08] responded
[53:10] in the same spirit that it's given in
[53:12] right because
[53:13] because that's why i'm saying that the
[53:14] that you know what happens with people
[53:16] is they don't receive the word and the
[53:17] same
[53:18] spirit that it's given and because the
[53:20] spirit of the word is given is
[53:21] is a spirit of mercy it's a spirit of
[53:24] deliverance a spirit of healing it's
[53:25] eternal life
[53:26] it's deliverance salvation you know it's
[53:29] it's for the devil to be cast out that's
[53:31] that's the spirit that the word has
[53:32] given him but he's saying that the other
[53:34] group
[53:35] are not responding in the same spirit
[53:37] because you think if someone starts
[53:38] playing music to dance now
[53:40] i didn't realize i was a musician until
[53:42] i read this last night
[53:44] because there's a there's a song coming
[53:45] forth there's a song coming forth i mean
[53:48] when someone stands up there and
[53:49] preaches the word you hear your pastor
[53:51] preach or whoever preaching
[53:52] there's a song being played there's some
[53:54] sheet music that's being played and
[53:56] and god's desire is that the same
[53:58] inspiration that comes upon the minister
[53:59] falls upon you
[54:01] and your life begins to dance and dance
[54:03] amen that's the same as the word
[54:04] hallelujah
[54:05] amen because we know that this message
[54:07] is sent to produce a
[54:09] body change this is a message of
[54:12] rapturing faith
[54:13] amen it's not a reformation it's a
[54:15] transformation message
[54:17] to changes from this you know mortal to
[54:20] be that will put on immortality
[54:22] that will be built in the image of
[54:23] christ that's why this message came
[54:25] i mean so now if that is if that is it
[54:28] now so i'm now
[54:29] singing a song or every sermon i say
[54:32] preach you know what i'm singing
[54:33] i'm walking right up into a body change
[54:36] i feel it coming on and it might be
[54:37] today
[54:38] that's every service you'll ever sit in
[54:39] in this church i'm singing that song to
[54:41] you
[54:42] you've got to come under the inspiration
[54:44] of them of this of the song
[54:46] hallelujah and start dancing to that
[54:48] beat
[54:50] hallelujah now brother abraham says in
[54:53] the mighty god available for us he says
[54:55] now the only way
[54:56] he says no we can't live in the light of
[54:58] luther he is a reformer
[54:59] we appreciate his part but we played
[55:02] that out
[55:03] we're way over here at the back of the
[55:05] book now we can't play it out like that
[55:07] so we can't play it out like what the
[55:08] lutherans did
[55:10] now the only way we're ever going to be
[55:11] able to do it my brethren is this and
[55:13] the
[55:13] and brethren of the world of different
[55:15] parts of the world i might say there's
[55:17] only one way
[55:18] for that director to do he has to get in
[55:21] the same spirit that the composer is in
[55:23] then he's got it so it's like an
[55:25] orchestra someone writes some music
[55:27] and then that music's given to the you
[55:29] know given to the director and then he
[55:30] directs all the musicians to play that
[55:32] music
[55:33] the only way that the director can play
[55:36] or get the
[55:37] um get the musicians to play that is if
[55:39] he's in the same spirit as a composer
[55:43] he must be in the same spirit of the
[55:44] composer then he's got it and when the
[55:46] church the symphony itself
[55:48] where the world is at watching for these
[55:50] signs and wonders
[55:51] when the church and the composer and the
[55:53] director all
[55:54] get in the spirit of the composer that
[55:57] means we've got to get into the spirit
[55:58] of the lord jesus christ he's the great
[56:00] composer
[56:01] we've got sheet music here hallelujah
[56:04] you say well
[56:05] i don't have a very big part no god
[56:07] wants all of his musicians to be playing
[56:10] you know you know sometimes in
[56:11] orchestras we watch the lead violin or
[56:13] the lead something but you know
[56:15] everyone has a role maybe you can just
[56:17] be the man who just plays the triangle
[56:20] you know he goes to every practice you
[56:22] know he dresses the part he gets
[56:23] prepared
[56:24] and he's standing there watching the
[56:26] music maybe he only makes one ting in
[56:28] the whole thing
[56:29] and maybe many in the audience would
[56:31] have missed it but if the composer's
[56:33] sitting there and the man doesn't think
[56:34] at the right time he says there's
[56:35] something wrong here
[56:36] because to the composer that thing is
[56:38] important because he put it there for a
[56:40] purpose
[56:41] we may be the triangle player in the
[56:42] band but hey it's important to god
[56:44] i mean we've got part of the word to
[56:46] play out
[56:48] harley every part of the symphony is
[56:49] important
[56:51] hallelujah hey if i'm a triangle player
[56:52] praise the lord i'm going to play that
[56:54] triangle
[56:55] one shot 10 hallelujah you know they
[56:58] stand there how they do and they just
[57:00] you do this they still
[57:01] if i've got to stand there the whole
[57:02] time for the last movement of the music
[57:04] wouldn't just go ting
[57:06] hallelujah hey there's going to be a
[57:07] ting one day and the body's going to be
[57:09] changed maybe that's the part we've got
[57:10] to play harley we're going to be
[57:12] standing ready lord okay
[57:14] when's it going and you're watching the
[57:15] composer and you're watching he begins
[57:17] to nod and do all the
[57:18] indenting and then what does he do he
[57:21] puts his triangle away he goes home gets
[57:23] changed but he's done his job
[57:26] that's what we want to do amen and when
[57:29] they say the day of miracles has passed
[57:31] it didn't hit the right note but when it
[57:34] gets in the right swing of it the right
[57:36] spirit of it how
[57:37] how are you going to do it until the
[57:39] spirit comes down of the composer
[57:41] amen then you say the day of miracles
[57:43] never pass the symphony cries out amen
[57:46] when we hit jesus christ the same
[57:48] yesterday today and forever the symphony
[57:49] cries out amen what's the symphony
[57:51] that's your life
[57:52] crying out amen you shall receive power
[57:54] after this holy ghost has come upon you
[57:56] the symphony cries out amen i got it
[57:58] there's no more guesswork about it then
[58:01] the whole symphony is right in harmony
[58:03] with the word it's going that's it oh
[58:04] it's a magnificent thing
[58:06] the director and the composer must be in
[58:08] the same spirit and so must the
[58:10] musicians be in the same spirit
[58:12] to act it all out the world is wondering
[58:15] what's going on
[58:17] now it's interesting how jesus would say
[58:20] that this would be like children in a
[58:21] marketplace
[58:23] a marketplace in the scriptures
[58:26] the town square it's a public part of
[58:28] the
[58:29] um place you know there's a lot of
[58:31] things going on there people are selling
[58:33] people are buying
[58:34] you know we know that you know new
[58:36] zealand we're not very big on people
[58:38] trying to get in your face and sell your
[58:39] things but other parts of the world they
[58:41] uh yo that's normal you know your
[58:43] brother antipa knows about that from
[58:45] israel you know they try and get in your
[58:46] face and sell these things and do this
[58:48] and
[58:49] you know people don't really change a
[58:50] lot so no doubt back in jesus day it was
[58:52] the same kind of thing
[58:53] they had their bread they had their food
[58:55] they were selling whatever they'd be on
[58:56] the you know they're trying to get
[58:58] everyone's attention and
[58:59] there's a lot of hustle and bustle going
[59:01] on and you know and there's
[59:02] here's these children there now so it's
[59:05] in a public place
[59:07] and one group starts playing so they had
[59:10] so you think about it the reason people
[59:12] play a song is because they've got it on
[59:14] their heart
[59:15] and they start playing the music they
[59:17] start piping so there's a song on their
[59:20] heart and they want the others to join
[59:21] in this is what god wants he wants us to
[59:23] join in
[59:24] with the music he wants us to dance
[59:26] along
[59:27] amen but then you see but the other
[59:30] children aren't responding now
[59:32] now why would people not respond in a
[59:33] public place
[59:35] because of the pressure of the place
[59:38] because of the atmosphere of the place
[59:39] now i'm going to go into atmosphere it's
[59:41] not some vague thing it's not like
[59:42] seeing some clouds up in the sky oh
[59:44] that's the atmosphere
[59:46] you know no no that's not about the
[59:47] atmosphere of an age but
[59:49] we'll get to that later but you know
[59:50] here here they are you know the children
[59:52] are dancing
[59:53] or playing and they want the other group
[59:55] to dance they're calling to them why
[59:56] don't you join in with us
[59:58] but you know there's a there's a
[59:59] pressure that comes on
[1:00:01] for people to conform to what's going on
[1:00:03] around them
[1:00:04] so in a marketplace you know you know if
[1:00:06] you go to the riverside market here you
[1:00:08] want to keep your children close don't
[1:00:09] let them wander off too much you know
[1:00:10] because you've got to go here and buy
[1:00:12] this and
[1:00:12] get this here and get this here and get
[1:00:14] lunch here and you know you don't want
[1:00:15] them just wandering off you know
[1:00:17] there's a certain atmosphere in the
[1:00:18] market
[1:00:20] but these children playing you know they
[1:00:22] want to change the atmosphere and god
[1:00:23] wants us to change he wants our
[1:00:25] atmosphere to be changed
[1:00:26] he wants the anointing upon us not to be
[1:00:28] the anointing of the age but to the
[1:00:30] anointing of his word
[1:00:31] upon us and then so there they are
[1:00:33] they're playing but the others aren't
[1:00:34] responding and maybe they had in their
[1:00:36] minds well
[1:00:37] you know this is not a place for dancing
[1:00:39] or for weeping
[1:00:40] you know what if daddy sees me what if
[1:00:42] what if so and so sees me what if this
[1:00:44] one tells me off you know there's a
[1:00:45] pressure comes on
[1:00:46] and they don't respond to the piping
[1:00:50] you know it's not a convenient time not
[1:00:52] a convenient place i'll respond at
[1:00:54] another time another place that's the
[1:00:56] wrong attitude
[1:00:58] when god starts piping we should start
[1:00:59] dancing
[1:01:01] hallelujah amen and yes the same thing
[1:01:04] he says yo yo they said we have mourned
[1:01:07] if i can find it here he says we have
[1:01:10] mourned to you and you have not
[1:01:11] whipped if someone's weeping or
[1:01:13] rejoicing
[1:01:15] they want to convey an emotion to
[1:01:16] someone hallelujah
[1:01:19] now now the gospel doesn't make us well
[1:01:21] we may weep over our sins but we don't
[1:01:22] stay weeping you know but when someone
[1:01:24] preaches
[1:01:25] i trust that you know the love i have of
[1:01:27] the lord jesus in my heart
[1:01:29] you want to convey that to your audience
[1:01:31] the people around us that we talk to on
[1:01:33] the street
[1:01:33] you know my houses are if people would
[1:01:35] only fall in love with him
[1:01:37] that's what we want done we want we want
[1:01:39] people to fall in love with the word
[1:01:40] fall in love with jesus christ
[1:01:42] you know we just convey the emotion you
[1:01:44] say well well the gospel
[1:01:46] is not about emotion but brother brahm
[1:01:47] said very clearly anything without
[1:01:49] emotion
[1:01:49] is dead you bury it so you know this is
[1:01:52] a heartfelt religion
[1:01:53] we're not led by our feelings but love
[1:01:55] is a feeling
[1:01:56] hallelujah it's a manifest hallelujah
[1:01:59] you know so
[1:02:00] you know you can't say you love someone
[1:02:01] but not feel it that's just an
[1:02:03] intellectual conception of love
[1:02:05] it's got and you say you love the lord
[1:02:06] jesus there should be a feeling there
[1:02:08] however we know we are sure our walk is
[1:02:10] based on the word or not our feelings
[1:02:12] our feelings and beat us around but
[1:02:13] there should be love
[1:02:15] there should be a feeling of love so
[1:02:17] he's saying that these children say
[1:02:18] you're not entering into the same
[1:02:19] emotion we have
[1:02:21] because of the condition of the
[1:02:23] marketplace they were afraid to step
[1:02:26] out of the status quo and dance
[1:02:29] or weep what if daddy sees me weeping
[1:02:32] here
[1:02:33] i'll get in trouble you know these
[1:02:35] pressures and things going on
[1:02:38] so people are atmosphere generators
[1:02:43] everyone here is creating an atmosphere
[1:02:45] it's not some vague thing
[1:02:46] you know it's like people talk about
[1:02:48] economics oh it's just market forces at
[1:02:49] work hold on it's not some vague thing
[1:02:51] there's actually things
[1:02:52] at work but people use it as an excuse
[1:02:54] i'll just market forces in the market
[1:02:56] yeah well who dictates the market this
[1:02:58] is not a vague thing it's like oh an
[1:03:00] atmosphere it's not a vague thing
[1:03:02] it's a very concrete thing and so people
[1:03:04] are atmosphere generators now it's what
[1:03:06] we
[1:03:07] the things that we think on the things
[1:03:09] that we do our actions the things we
[1:03:12] talk about it creates an atmosphere
[1:03:14] motherboard says it is your life is
[1:03:16] worthy of the gospel he says well we've
[1:03:18] seen those that every time
[1:03:19] you shun them all the time they want to
[1:03:21] talk about something evil and talk about
[1:03:23] somebody
[1:03:24] and say oh my here they come they're
[1:03:26] going to criticize somebody here here he
[1:03:28] he's in here now he's going to talk
[1:03:30] about this man all they're going to do
[1:03:32] is tell dirty jokes or something about
[1:03:33] women
[1:03:34] or something like that you just hate to
[1:03:36] be around them
[1:03:37] people like that why because they're
[1:03:38] creating an atmosphere see they create
[1:03:40] seemingly nice
[1:03:42] pretty nice people but they create that
[1:03:44] atmosphere
[1:03:45] and as i said the atmosphere is the
[1:03:47] things we think on
[1:03:48] the things you do our actions the things
[1:03:50] we talk about it creates an
[1:03:52] atmosphere right you know i
[1:03:55] i debuted as a netball coach yesterday
[1:03:59] literally here at annelise's netball
[1:04:00] coach now what kind of atmosphere would
[1:04:03] i have created
[1:04:05] if i tell those girls they're not going
[1:04:06] to win what's the point of trying
[1:04:09] you know and especially even kids i
[1:04:10] don't know well it doesn't matter for my
[1:04:12] own or other kids what if i tell them
[1:04:14] girls let's face it you're going to lose
[1:04:16] you can't catch it to save yourself you
[1:04:18] know
[1:04:18] that would create an atmosphere it would
[1:04:20] create an atmosphere of unbelief that
[1:04:22] they couldn't win
[1:04:23] right but i told them girls you're going
[1:04:25] to win that's a real good pass
[1:04:27] that you're you're doing well that's a
[1:04:28] good shot you're doing good keep it up
[1:04:30] you know
[1:04:30] and it creates an atmosphere hey we can
[1:04:32] do this
[1:04:33] hallelujah so you know our words have
[1:04:36] power
[1:04:37] our actions have power what we think
[1:04:40] about has power
[1:04:41] you say well i'm just in my own little
[1:04:43] nothing box in my head
[1:04:44] no no that nothing box spreads out
[1:04:47] around us
[1:04:48] hallelujah that's for the brothers by
[1:04:50] the way apparently sisters don't have
[1:04:52] nothing boxes
[1:04:53] but you know yeah but but it actually it
[1:04:55] actually has ramifications
[1:04:57] of of of the people around us i just
[1:05:00] wanted people say i just want to live in
[1:05:02] my own little world now that'll have
[1:05:03] ramifications because you're withdrawing
[1:05:06] and that will hurt someone around you
[1:05:09] man is not made to withdraw within
[1:05:11] himself or within herself
[1:05:14] so jesus saying that that generation was
[1:05:16] like that
[1:05:18] and history repeats itself this that
[1:05:20] same son of man has been revealed in
[1:05:22] this day
[1:05:23] amen through the prophet messenger so
[1:05:26] many times the reason that people do not
[1:05:28] respond today the way they really should
[1:05:30] if they are in their right mind is
[1:05:31] because of the influence of an
[1:05:32] atmosphere
[1:05:35] amen now we must go beyond that now i'm
[1:05:38] just saying all this is a background to
[1:05:40] simon's house
[1:05:42] because there's a there's a reason why
[1:05:45] the scripture's arranged this way
[1:05:47] jesus didn't just tell this com you know
[1:05:49] tell how that
[1:05:50] how the generation is now he's going to
[1:05:52] show why that generation's that way
[1:05:54] and it's going to be lived out we're
[1:05:56] going to be real careful we're not
[1:05:58] we're not we're not reading off the
[1:05:59] wrong script you know
[1:06:01] no doubt if simon could have redone his
[1:06:03] lines again he wouldn't have done those
[1:06:04] lines
[1:06:05] he would have been the woman washing his
[1:06:07] feet you know
[1:06:08] we're going to be real careful what kind
[1:06:09] of life that we're projecting
[1:06:11] now simon simon was a pharisee we know
[1:06:15] he was a very rich man brother brown
[1:06:17] tells us that that this was an annual
[1:06:19] feast that he would he would host and he
[1:06:20] would you know
[1:06:22] call all the great dignitaries and try
[1:06:23] and show off his wealth and you know
[1:06:25] but there's a whole agenda that he had
[1:06:27] behind it
[1:06:28] you know you see the way he treated the
[1:06:31] lord
[1:06:31] really reflects to us the kind of man he
[1:06:33] was
[1:06:34] because he had a purpose in inviting
[1:06:37] jesus and that was not to give him the
[1:06:38] best place at the feast
[1:06:40] that was to make fun of him ridicule him
[1:06:42] he says basically i'm just going to put
[1:06:44] a whole damper on this thing and i'm
[1:06:45] going to show you really what kind of
[1:06:47] stuff this man is made out of and so he
[1:06:50] had a
[1:06:50] so so no doubt he would have maybe you
[1:06:53] know if he treated
[1:06:54] jesus a guest this way how do you think
[1:06:56] he would have treated his servants
[1:06:58] you know maybe they put a foot wrong he
[1:07:00] would have ridiculed them publicly made
[1:07:02] them feel embarrassed you know run them
[1:07:03] down
[1:07:04] this is the kind of man he was he wasn't
[1:07:06] a sweet humble nice kind of a boss
[1:07:09] you know some people it's amazing what
[1:07:12] kind of conditions people live
[1:07:14] in and i'll just talk about work life
[1:07:16] we'll just
[1:07:17] you know it's amazing the the the stuff
[1:07:19] people put up with
[1:07:21] just for a dollar you know because i
[1:07:23] doubt
[1:07:24] this is my opinion i doubt the foot wash
[1:07:26] flunky loved his job
[1:07:29] you know how's your job satisfaction
[1:07:31] this year 10 out of 10.
[1:07:33] i love washing feet i love washing the
[1:07:35] grime and the stench and the manure and
[1:07:37] the
[1:07:38] dust and you know i love i just enjoy it
[1:07:42] i doubt very much he had that kind of
[1:07:44] mindset
[1:07:45] you know he saw one maybe maybe he would
[1:07:47] grimace when he see people come to the
[1:07:49] door
[1:07:49] you know but he had in his mind you know
[1:07:53] but at least i'm getting paid something
[1:07:55] at least i'm earning a wage and sure you
[1:07:57] know
[1:07:57] not all jobs you know if work was always
[1:08:00] fun it wouldn't be called work it'd be
[1:08:02] cool fun
[1:08:04] you know and it moulds our character a
[1:08:06] certain way if we persevere so i'm not
[1:08:07] you know
[1:08:08] but the foot wash flank flankie came
[1:08:10] under the influence of simon
[1:08:13] and he had to you know put up with
[1:08:15] probably a lot of abuse
[1:08:17] but because of his because well he
[1:08:20] reasoned with it himself or at least i'm
[1:08:22] earning something you know sure i'm at
[1:08:24] the bottom of the ladder but hey a
[1:08:26] promotion is going to come someday
[1:08:28] you know maybe i won't just be the foot
[1:08:29] wash flank you all the time maybe i'll
[1:08:31] be
[1:08:31] cleaning the dishes or i'm not doing
[1:08:33] some marking out the stables whatever a
[1:08:35] promotion would be in that kind of
[1:08:37] you know and so he had this in his mind
[1:08:39] and
[1:08:40] the other servants would have been much
[1:08:42] the same way see people are attracted to
[1:08:45] riches and it's not always for a good
[1:08:47] intention
[1:08:48] many times it's actually a selfish
[1:08:50] motive people attracted to certain
[1:08:52] people you know so
[1:08:55] here he is no doubt
[1:08:58] most of his servants didn't really like
[1:09:00] simon but there's prestige
[1:09:02] in working for an up and up in society
[1:09:06] right people say you know they work for
[1:09:08] a certain company i work for so-and-so
[1:09:11] and they think they've made it somehow
[1:09:12] but you know it doesn't really mean too
[1:09:14] much at the end of the day
[1:09:15] but you know so they were thinking no
[1:09:17] doubt he was singing well at least i'll
[1:09:18] work for this guy and you know he's well
[1:09:20] known and
[1:09:21] you know but the atmosphere you know how
[1:09:24] he would have
[1:09:24] how he would have been treated no doubt
[1:09:27] it would have become quite hollow that
[1:09:29] he was working for simon
[1:09:31] maybe at first it would have been
[1:09:32] exciting i don't know i'm just let's
[1:09:34] just step into a story
[1:09:36] because there's a lot of reasoning goes
[1:09:37] on you know many times we read the
[1:09:38] scriptures and we just kind of
[1:09:40] this person did this and this person did
[1:09:41] this we just think it's just a scripted
[1:09:43] play that there's no emotion there's no
[1:09:45] reasoning there's no
[1:09:46] you know but there's a lot of things
[1:09:47] going on but the challenge is can these
[1:09:50] people step
[1:09:51] out and actually give the lord the right
[1:09:53] kind of worship he deserves
[1:09:55] you know so so here's the footwash
[1:09:56] flunky he has this kind of way and then
[1:09:58] you know
[1:09:58] there's a lot of you know other
[1:10:00] attendants there that you know
[1:10:02] that are there in simon's house there's
[1:10:03] bakers there's cooks there's
[1:10:05] maids there's cleaners you know there's
[1:10:07] security there's all kind of different
[1:10:08] people
[1:10:09] and there's also there's also the ones
[1:10:11] who go personally
[1:10:12] to give the invitations now this was a
[1:10:15] very fancy kind of job because you get
[1:10:16] to go talk to people face to face
[1:10:18] you know you're not just washing feet
[1:10:20] you know you're not just just in the
[1:10:22] kitchen you're not just cleaning
[1:10:23] afterwards you know
[1:10:24] you get to you know you're a diplomat
[1:10:26] now i'm just a lower scale
[1:10:29] so now this is a bit of you know you can
[1:10:31] really sell yourself
[1:10:33] you know you know what i mean you can
[1:10:35] make a name for yourself
[1:10:36] how you how you how you give the
[1:10:38] announcement and how you give the
[1:10:39] invitation and you know you can
[1:10:41] brush up on your oratory skills and you
[1:10:43] know you can and then so people can get
[1:10:45] so caught up in these things and they
[1:10:47] they can get so focused on their task at
[1:10:49] hand we can misread the big picture
[1:10:52] you know simon the pharisee
[1:10:55] because this was a was a was a a
[1:10:58] calendar day you know
[1:10:59] in his you know you know very important
[1:11:01] part in his in his calendar
[1:11:03] he would have overseen the whole
[1:11:04] arrangement of this feast yes
[1:11:06] right so he didn't just say what's for
[1:11:08] dinner tonight i invited some people
[1:11:10] over and you know no no
[1:11:11] he would have had the guest list he
[1:11:12] would have gone through it all because
[1:11:13] he wanted to impress certain people
[1:11:16] and a lot of those people probably came
[1:11:18] to the feast but didn't even like him
[1:11:20] but they came because they were invited
[1:11:21] and his name was well known
[1:11:24] we all following me yeah so you know a
[1:11:27] lot of these people would have come and
[1:11:28] they would have not necessarily liked
[1:11:29] him but they came but you know he would
[1:11:30] have gone over the guest list
[1:11:32] and then he would have talked to his
[1:11:34] talk to his servants
[1:11:36] about this is how i want the people
[1:11:38] welcomed
[1:11:39] and he would have gone through now when
[1:11:41] their carriages come you servants you
[1:11:43] take the horses and things put them in
[1:11:44] the stables make sure they're fed
[1:11:46] and now you and the guest list you stand
[1:11:47] here you know and when they come you
[1:11:49] know they'll give you you ask their name
[1:11:51] and they'll give the name then you'll
[1:11:52] announce who's coming through the door
[1:11:54] and then the footwash flunky you're here
[1:11:56] with the towels and the bowl you make
[1:11:57] sure that's ready you're ready and then
[1:11:59] the person who anoints and kisses mike
[1:12:00] welcome
[1:12:01] this is the procession of them coming
[1:12:03] into the feast
[1:12:04] but he would have said now now this is
[1:12:06] the guest listen know that he would have
[1:12:07] read
[1:12:08] it out and he says now everyone's going
[1:12:09] to get this kind of treatment but
[1:12:11] one jesus of nazareth has been invited
[1:12:16] foot wash flunky you don't wash his feet
[1:12:19] don't anoint him you
[1:12:20] don't make him welcome you and and the
[1:12:22] person will
[1:12:23] no doubt they would have been ushered to
[1:12:25] a certain seat
[1:12:27] make him sit in the corner this would
[1:12:29] have all been arranged it wasn't an
[1:12:31] accident simon didn't just look up in
[1:12:32] the face and say hey this is wrong
[1:12:34] it was all orchestrated because there's
[1:12:37] way that people can come to church
[1:12:40] and we can put jesus in the corner and
[1:12:42] make him unwelcome
[1:12:44] but we can just be stuck in a certain
[1:12:46] mode of things and you know
[1:12:48] we don't want to be that kind of people
[1:12:50] remember what bible character are we
[1:12:51] today
[1:12:52] now so so he sends out his his his his
[1:12:55] couriers that have got everyone's
[1:12:57] invitation and now here's the one who's
[1:13:00] given the task you have to give this to
[1:13:02] jesus of nazareth
[1:13:04] and because he wants to impress his boss
[1:13:07] he makes his journey
[1:13:09] and you know he's got a journey you know
[1:13:11] a couple of days
[1:13:12] he's on foot that's a long way to go he
[1:13:14] doesn't just get in his car and go
[1:13:16] he's got to walk and he's going to find
[1:13:18] out where jesus is because jesus is
[1:13:19] always moving around
[1:13:21] he's having a meeting here healing
[1:13:22] people here going here
[1:13:24] you know but eventually he came to where
[1:13:26] the crowd now wherever jesus there's
[1:13:28] always a crowd
[1:13:29] you know and maybe maybe he walked over
[1:13:31] the last hill and he heard the hum of
[1:13:33] the noise of the people
[1:13:34] and he sees a group of people gathered
[1:13:36] up on a hill and he says there he is
[1:13:39] and no doubt there would have been a bit
[1:13:41] of relief in his heart
[1:13:43] i finally found him sweat running down
[1:13:45] his down his brow
[1:13:47] heat of the day you know he's tired
[1:13:49] maybe a bit dehydrated but
[1:13:50] you know he begins to walk through the
[1:13:52] crowd
[1:13:54] up to where jesus is now no doubt as
[1:13:56] he's walking through he would have heard
[1:13:58] testimonies
[1:13:59] of what just happened that morning
[1:14:01] hallelujah someone who has crippled is
[1:14:03] now walking carrying crutches
[1:14:05] the lord took me off these this morning
[1:14:07] and they would have testified
[1:14:08] he would have heard the hum of the
[1:14:09] meeting afterwards you know isn't it
[1:14:11] wonderful we can sit down after a good
[1:14:13] meeting and talk about what god just did
[1:14:14] and what ministered to our hearts and
[1:14:16] what he did for us and you know
[1:14:17] that hum would have been going on but
[1:14:19] he's so caught up in what he has to do
[1:14:21] he's really missing his moment because
[1:14:24] remember he has an audience with jesus
[1:14:27] he's not just going to talk to anyone
[1:14:29] and now he's coming
[1:14:30] under an atmosphere of faith amen but
[1:14:33] because he's so
[1:14:34] caught up in what he's doing he's
[1:14:36] missing it
[1:14:37] may we never be numb to an atmosphere of
[1:14:39] faith and so he comes up and you know
[1:14:42] jesus had his inner circle and you know
[1:14:44] he had the other disciples and there was
[1:14:46] layers of security around him because
[1:14:47] he's tired and he's busy and
[1:14:49] you know and he maybe comes to philip or
[1:14:51] one of the other disciples he said you
[1:14:52] know and he announces who he is and
[1:14:54] this is why i've come and try and look
[1:14:56] all important and here i am and
[1:14:58] you know he says yeah i've got to see
[1:14:59] jesus and philip's like well he's
[1:15:02] busy and he's tired and you know he goes
[1:15:04] to talk to some of the other disciples
[1:15:06] and this guy is really insistent i've
[1:15:07] got to see him
[1:15:08] i've got a schedule to keep you know we
[1:15:11] can get so caught up in schedules
[1:15:13] and then so finally he's led in and then
[1:15:14] finally he steps into the presence
[1:15:18] of more than a man he looked like
[1:15:20] everyone else jesus wasn't dressed up
[1:15:22] any different kind of way he looked like
[1:15:23] a common man
[1:15:25] but when he looked into those eyes he
[1:15:26] was looking to the eyes of eternal life
[1:15:29] and he and he had an audience a
[1:15:31] one-on-one audience you know many people
[1:15:33] would have wanted that wouldn't you want
[1:15:34] that
[1:15:35] wouldn't that would have been wonderful
[1:15:37] not just to be at the back of the back
[1:15:38] it would have been amazing to see him
[1:15:40] from the
[1:15:40] edge of the crowd it would have been
[1:15:42] amazing to be in the middle of the crowd
[1:15:43] or be close but
[1:15:44] to get a one-on-one audience because you
[1:15:46] don't know how much longer he's going to
[1:15:47] be on the earth for
[1:15:49] here's an opportunity where all the
[1:15:50] prophets and the wise men all the
[1:15:52] believers through the ages have been
[1:15:53] looking for this moment and you're
[1:15:55] living in the moment
[1:15:56] and he finally gets into the prince of
[1:15:58] jesus he says jesus
[1:16:00] i am the courier of simon the pharisee
[1:16:03] and i have come to invite you to his
[1:16:06] feast it's going to be an excellent
[1:16:07] feast so and so it's going to be you
[1:16:09] know he paints a real good picture you
[1:16:10] know you paint a good picture if you
[1:16:11] want people to come
[1:16:13] and jesus looks at him
[1:16:17] and no doubt in the back of his mind
[1:16:20] he's thinking
[1:16:22] what this is such a sad thing going on
[1:16:26] he jesus knew who he was he says
[1:16:29] i've come i'm the lamb of god take away
[1:16:32] the sin of the world
[1:16:33] he knew he was emanuel so when he knew
[1:16:35] he was god he wasn't making himself
[1:16:37] something he wasn't
[1:16:38] he was the fountain of eternal life he
[1:16:40] was the one who could have given this
[1:16:42] man what he really needed
[1:16:44] and he would have thought in the back of
[1:16:45] his mind what a shame
[1:16:49] and and and and the courier is saying
[1:16:51] this to him and no doubt the disciples
[1:16:53] are kind of gathering around listening
[1:16:54] to what's going on and
[1:16:56] they're probably thinking simon the
[1:16:57] pharisee he's not good enough he's not
[1:16:59] going to accept this
[1:17:00] what a waste of time you know but then
[1:17:02] jesus
[1:17:03] because he always comes where he's
[1:17:04] invited he always comes where he's
[1:17:06] invited he'll say sure i'll come
[1:17:08] such and such a date yeah i'll be there
[1:17:11] yeah sure thing tell your master i'll be
[1:17:13] there
[1:17:14] and then then the courier now
[1:17:17] he lets out a sigh of relief or maybe
[1:17:19] something in his heart a joy because
[1:17:20] remember the whole reason that jesus
[1:17:22] he's going to be the entertainment
[1:17:26] it's going to be a different feast this
[1:17:27] year he's going to be the entertainment
[1:17:30] he's got an important job to invite
[1:17:32] jesus and now he's just heard he'll come
[1:17:34] no doubt satisfaction rose up in his
[1:17:35] heart
[1:17:37] yes i'm going to get promoted maybe i'll
[1:17:40] get a bonus maybe i'll get something
[1:17:41] from simon
[1:17:42] and he turns around feeling satisfied
[1:17:45] and he walks back down the hill
[1:17:48] and no doubt jesus would have looked at
[1:17:50] him as he walked down
[1:17:51] and thought what a pity he had an
[1:17:54] opportunity to talk to me
[1:17:56] and that's what he said he relayed what
[1:17:59] someone else said as opposed to really
[1:18:00] what should have been on his heart
[1:18:02] what would have we done when we went
[1:18:04] there wouldn't you get down at his feet
[1:18:06] say lord be merciful to me a sinner
[1:18:08] lord change my life you're the founder
[1:18:11] we know you're christ
[1:18:13] hallelujah remember what jesus did was
[1:18:16] not done in a corner
[1:18:18] paul would say to king agrippa these
[1:18:20] things weren't done in a corner speaking
[1:18:21] of the death burial resurrection of
[1:18:23] jesus christ and everything he did
[1:18:24] and that was about 20 i have it here
[1:18:26] somewhere about 20 odd years after the
[1:18:28] fact
[1:18:30] so even king agrippa knew what happened
[1:18:32] they knew they knew jesus had a name
[1:18:35] they had heard stories and rumors about
[1:18:37] what he did sure they heard a lot of bad
[1:18:39] things about him but they
[1:18:40] did here blind bartimaeus he's no longer
[1:18:43] called blind bartimaeus
[1:18:45] legion no he's no longer legion where is
[1:18:47] he went back to his family healthy well
[1:18:48] than normal
[1:18:50] hallelujah yeah dries his daughter yeah
[1:18:52] she's well
[1:18:54] remember he was he was a religious man
[1:18:56] as well
[1:18:57] are the lepers yeah no longer lepers
[1:19:00] hallelujah
[1:19:01] you know hey that storm that blew up on
[1:19:04] the sea of galilee the other night that
[1:19:05] was wild
[1:19:06] and it just stopped what happened i
[1:19:08] heard jesus was going across
[1:19:10] yeah they would have heard those kind of
[1:19:12] things but yet because he was so
[1:19:15] caught up under simon's leadership
[1:19:20] he thought he had done his job and he
[1:19:23] walked away
[1:19:26] it was 29 years after the death burial
[1:19:28] resurrection of jesus that the apostle
[1:19:30] paul said to king agrippa
[1:19:32] i am persuaded that none of these things
[1:19:33] are hidden from him for this thing was
[1:19:35] not done in a corner
[1:19:38] it hadn't gone away even even even that
[1:19:40] long afterwards now
[1:19:42] so here comes jesus no wait the courier
[1:19:45] runs back down
[1:19:47] he's got a spring in his step he goes to
[1:19:49] simon
[1:19:50] simon oh great simon pharisee master
[1:19:53] i've done my errand and here i am and
[1:19:55] in good time and you know and jesus said
[1:19:58] he'll come
[1:19:59] and simon's saying excellent the
[1:20:02] entertainment's coming
[1:20:03] this is going to be a special time and
[1:20:06] then now
[1:20:06] jesus makes his way with his disciples
[1:20:11] slowly or however they walked and they
[1:20:14] got there on the evening of the feast
[1:20:16] others other guests are arriving before
[1:20:19] he arrives
[1:20:20] no doubt they come in their fancy
[1:20:21] chariots or on their mules or whatever
[1:20:23] their horses and
[1:20:24] there's a lot of pomp and ceremony
[1:20:26] because here comes the great chief rabbi
[1:20:28] of so and so and this is a great
[1:20:30] pharisee of this bible school and you
[1:20:31] know because they're trying to impress
[1:20:33] one another
[1:20:34] and the trumpets tooed and all the
[1:20:35] things go on and you know here come
[1:20:37] here come the guests and just as just as
[1:20:40] um
[1:20:40] simon told his servants this is how
[1:20:42] you're gonna do it and it was all and
[1:20:44] it was just carried out perfectly
[1:20:46] because all of the servants are trying
[1:20:47] to get something out of simon
[1:20:49] they want to be noticed that they're
[1:20:50] better than the others yet they don't
[1:20:52] really like him
[1:20:53] but they want something from him
[1:20:56] but then finally a ragtag if i can say a
[1:20:59] ragtag mob of common looking peasants
[1:21:00] walks down the street
[1:21:02] here comes jesus
[1:21:05] he doesn't come in some great big
[1:21:07] trumpet blast and a great big pomp and
[1:21:08] fanfare and ceremony
[1:21:10] here comes a meek humble way and then he
[1:21:13] be
[1:21:13] he comes forward and then normally the
[1:21:16] ones with the guest list
[1:21:17] that see some fancy guy with a big hat
[1:21:20] and stuff coming
[1:21:21] they say oh sir great sir what is your
[1:21:23] name it's so nice to see you here you
[1:21:25] know
[1:21:25] it's i'm pharisee jones from hebron
[1:21:28] pharisee jones oh yes pharisee joseph
[1:21:30] here please come this way sir it's so
[1:21:32] nice to have you here and
[1:21:34] you know and there'll be a lot of
[1:21:35] flattery and all that stuff going on but
[1:21:37] then
[1:21:37] but then they see this group of men
[1:21:39] coming
[1:21:41] and they look like common peasants
[1:21:44] and then that same one says and who are
[1:21:46] you what are you doing here
[1:21:48] because because they think they're here
[1:21:51] just to try and get food or just cause
[1:21:53] them
[1:21:53] cause a disturbance because we've got
[1:21:54] this great entrance way going on
[1:21:57] and jesus steps forth and says i'm jesus
[1:21:59] of nazareth
[1:22:01] jesus yep sure come
[1:22:05] there's no big welcome mat remember
[1:22:07] attitude
[1:22:08] i'm talking about attitude here you know
[1:22:10] and so jesus comes in
[1:22:13] and no doubt when simon gave the orders
[1:22:16] to the footwash slunky and the person
[1:22:18] who anoints and kisses makes welcome all
[1:22:20] those people
[1:22:21] no doubt something would have flashed
[1:22:22] through their minds when he instructed
[1:22:25] them
[1:22:25] don't wash his feet don't anoint him
[1:22:28] don't make them welcome
[1:22:29] same with a flash through their minds
[1:22:30] jesus
[1:22:32] what's he done i heard he healed the
[1:22:35] sick i heard he raised the dead
[1:22:37] i heard he set this person free i heard
[1:22:39] he did this he's only done good to
[1:22:40] people and something would have flashed
[1:22:41] through their minds
[1:22:43] but this doesn't seem quite right
[1:22:45] because pharisee jones came he spat on
[1:22:47] me the other time
[1:22:48] that one doesn't give me time of day
[1:22:50] this one doesn't care about me
[1:22:52] and yet i've got to wash their feet and
[1:22:53] all these things but all because
[1:22:56] they weren't willing to go beyond
[1:22:59] what simon the pharisee said
[1:23:02] they would have tried to reason with it
[1:23:03] but then no doubt maybe the footwash
[1:23:05] flankie said
[1:23:06] well i've got the lowest paying job here
[1:23:10] first in first out so so so i just
[1:23:12] started last week i can't
[1:23:14] yo this is too important i've got a job
[1:23:16] now
[1:23:17] and the others would have thought well i
[1:23:19] really want to anoint him
[1:23:21] i really want to make him welcome but i
[1:23:24] can't stick my neck out above these
[1:23:26] others if they're not going to do it
[1:23:27] well i can't do it
[1:23:28] we can't go with the crowd are you all
[1:23:30] following me and they would have had
[1:23:31] this battle in their minds but but but
[1:23:33] we should but well we can't but we
[1:23:35] should but we can't and
[1:23:36] well if well if the person in front of
[1:23:38] the fort wash flunky makes him
[1:23:40] oh no no if the man with the guest list
[1:23:42] you know gives him some great flattery
[1:23:44] then i'll know yes it's right to anoint
[1:23:46] you know wash his feet we can't
[1:23:48] respond to the word because of how
[1:23:50] others are responding
[1:23:51] we can't just say oh yeah well if no
[1:23:53] one's going to cry and praise god well
[1:23:55] i'm not going to do it or
[1:23:56] you know if everyone's going to fall
[1:23:58] asleep well i can't be happier
[1:24:00] yeah we yeah we can't respond because of
[1:24:03] how it what what everyone else is doing
[1:24:05] you know the first convention i ever
[1:24:06] went to was was up in auckland brother
[1:24:09] ron spencer and brother harold
[1:24:10] hildebrand were
[1:24:11] preaching and and i i i went with um
[1:24:15] brother emerson to go get jose from the
[1:24:18] bus or wherever so we turn up to the
[1:24:19] first meeting late and the deacons of
[1:24:21] the ushers
[1:24:22] put me on the front row and i sat there
[1:24:25] i thought praise god
[1:24:27] because there's no there's no
[1:24:28] distractions in front of me i can't see
[1:24:30] what
[1:24:30] all the monkeys are doing i don't care
[1:24:32] about it that's me and god
[1:24:35] hallelujah isn't that right and and i
[1:24:37] thought well i'm just going to sit here
[1:24:38] for the rest of the
[1:24:39] you know so i didn't what sorry
[1:24:42] you're not monkeys but you know what i
[1:24:44] mean you know who cares about this but
[1:24:45] some people they want to sit in the back
[1:24:47] and they want to sit now
[1:24:49] don't feel bad where you're sitting but
[1:24:52] it's motive and objective sure if you've
[1:24:54] got little kids here but you know some
[1:24:55] people they want to sit in the middle of
[1:24:56] the back though and see what everyone
[1:24:57] else is doing
[1:24:58] she's wearing this and he's wearing that
[1:25:00] and look at him do this and doing
[1:25:02] and they're missing god god wants to
[1:25:03] pour himself in and change your life
[1:25:05] and they're really missing what he wants
[1:25:07] to do to them and then so you know
[1:25:10] so i just decided i'm just going to sit
[1:25:11] in the front and i didn't it was a
[1:25:12] glorious time
[1:25:14] but that's the problem the footwork
[1:25:15] slunky thought well if he reads out his
[1:25:17] name a certain way then i'll wash his
[1:25:18] feet and then the
[1:25:19] one anointing they don't talk about it
[1:25:21] they say well if the foot was flunky
[1:25:23] because he's before me if he washes his
[1:25:25] feet then i'll anoint him
[1:25:26] then the one making welcome said well if
[1:25:29] if if the one reading the guest list
[1:25:30] says it this way footwork slunky does it
[1:25:33] this way this person anoints i'm going
[1:25:34] to make him welcome
[1:25:36] but there's the pressure but simon what
[1:25:38] about my boss
[1:25:40] jesus is the best boss and so jesus
[1:25:44] comes in
[1:25:45] and i don't know how but therefore was
[1:25:49] slunky
[1:25:50] he saw those feet walking and he pulls
[1:25:53] the ball to one side
[1:25:54] i i just i just i just don't know how
[1:25:56] you could do it
[1:25:57] you think about how could you how could
[1:25:59] you be there this is your opportunity
[1:26:02] here comes this man you've heard he
[1:26:04] raised the dead healed the sick cast out
[1:26:05] devils he's only done good
[1:26:07] and you've got an opportunity to wash
[1:26:08] those feet
[1:26:10] you know and then so here he is
[1:26:14] he pulls the bowl away because of his
[1:26:17] reasoning
[1:26:18] he says no no i'm going to keep church
[1:26:20] order
[1:26:22] if it's the anointing of god doing it
[1:26:23] it's an order
[1:26:25] that is church order man's control is
[1:26:27] not church order that's man's control
[1:26:30] so he says well i better keep pharisee
[1:26:32] jones church order he pulls the ball
[1:26:34] away
[1:26:35] and jesus just keeps walking and the
[1:26:36] person with the anointing maybe they
[1:26:38] turn around try and act busy
[1:26:40] trying to do something because they
[1:26:41] can't look the word in the face
[1:26:43] and turn it down that way you know
[1:26:46] we should just be honest sometimes but
[1:26:48] somebody yeah they try and do different
[1:26:49] things and you know they don't want to
[1:26:51] you know but realize you just come out
[1:26:53] and say no
[1:26:55] amen yeah you know the rebuke of this
[1:26:58] age is i worry you're hot or cold
[1:27:00] but you're lukewarm you know the
[1:27:02] definition of lukewarm from webster is
[1:27:05] is one of them is actually a lack of
[1:27:07] conviction
[1:27:09] that's that's being lukewarm a lack of
[1:27:10] conviction so you have a bit of
[1:27:12] conviction but there's a lack of it
[1:27:13] there's not enough to it so these people
[1:27:16] you could say well lukewarm they didn't
[1:27:18] have they lacked conviction to really
[1:27:20] welcome the lord in
[1:27:21] even if they reasoned we should really
[1:27:23] hey this is this is more than a teacher
[1:27:25] more than a rabbi
[1:27:26] he's done incredible things bible days
[1:27:28] are here again
[1:27:30] we can have a different kind of you know
[1:27:31] but they reasoned it away and then he
[1:27:33] walks in
[1:27:35] and then now here comes the one who's
[1:27:36] going to usher him to his seat
[1:27:38] puts them in the corner with unwashed
[1:27:40] feet
[1:27:42] all because of reasoning
[1:27:46] bubble characters but there was someone
[1:27:50] standing
[1:27:50] outside remember there's always someone
[1:27:54] where jesus
[1:27:55] is someone's going to anoint him
[1:27:57] someone's going to make him welcome
[1:27:59] someone's going to do the job hallelujah
[1:28:02] it doesn't it
[1:28:03] yeah and the thing is this woman she
[1:28:06] wasn't worried
[1:28:07] about what everyone else thought see
[1:28:09] that's the big problem
[1:28:10] everyone else thought well pharisees
[1:28:13] simon will think
[1:28:14] this so i can't do this and the foot
[1:28:15] wash flunky thinks this so i can't do
[1:28:17] this and they're all worried about and
[1:28:19] that's why i gave that about the first
[1:28:20] convention i went to i don't care what
[1:28:22] everyone else was doing
[1:28:23] i'm gonna have a good time i'll let god
[1:28:25] change my life
[1:28:27] hallelujah wasn't that a good time
[1:28:29] hallelujah brother chris wasn't a good
[1:28:31] time
[1:28:31] amen you know and then so there was
[1:28:34] someone standing on the outside she
[1:28:35] wasn't invited
[1:28:37] hallelujah she wasn't on the guest list
[1:28:41] she wasn't even included but yet
[1:28:44] something stood up in her heart
[1:28:46] that's wrong that's wrong that he's been
[1:28:49] not made welcome look at him sitting in
[1:28:52] the corner there you know with those
[1:28:53] kind of feasts people would kind of
[1:28:54] gather around the outside to see who's
[1:28:56] there in the music and try and get some
[1:28:57] free food and whatever more and
[1:28:59] you know but she went there and she
[1:29:00] looked and she thought this is wrong
[1:29:03] this is wrong that he's not been made
[1:29:05] welcome this is wrong that this church
[1:29:06] surface is a bit stale and cold and
[1:29:08] starchy
[1:29:09] this is wrong i want to do him a service
[1:29:11] i want to anoint him i want to make him
[1:29:12] welcome
[1:29:13] and she stood up in her heart hello she
[1:29:16] didn't look at what well
[1:29:17] well if he does it if he makes a move
[1:29:19] first then i'll make my move
[1:29:21] or if she says this i'll do this or you
[1:29:24] know well maybe if they put him in a
[1:29:25] better seat then i'll then i'll go in no
[1:29:27] no she didn't consider any of that
[1:29:29] hello she went home the prophet says she
[1:29:31] got all of her money
[1:29:33] not just some of her money all of her
[1:29:34] money now this woman was a prostitute
[1:29:37] we know that don't we so she got all of
[1:29:39] her earnings from her ill-gotten game
[1:29:40] not just some of it whole thing goes
[1:29:43] under her mattress grabs the bag out
[1:29:44] picks it up
[1:29:45] puts it into her dress and then she runs
[1:29:47] through the apothecary
[1:29:49] door bangs open sweat on her brow no
[1:29:51] doubt she comes in
[1:29:53] and there's the and there's the
[1:29:54] apothecary owner guy and he turns around
[1:29:57] sees who walks in the door as the
[1:29:58] you know you know the bell jingles as
[1:30:00] the door comes open he says
[1:30:02] oh you what do you want
[1:30:06] why are you here you know looks down his
[1:30:09] nose at her and oh yeah okay
[1:30:11] he says and and she's looking and she
[1:30:14] says i want your best
[1:30:17] my best and he takes her money back
[1:30:20] pulls it out on the
[1:30:21] on the bench and no doubt his eyes lit
[1:30:23] up as oh well ma'am welcome to my shop
[1:30:26] you're so welcome to be here i'm so
[1:30:27] welcome but please what can i get you
[1:30:29] and he reaches up to the very best
[1:30:32] puts in a verified alabaster box and
[1:30:35] gives it to her
[1:30:37] and she puts it in her robe and then she
[1:30:39] makes a beeline straight for the feast
[1:30:41] there's a lot of obstacles in her way
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:44] there's guards there's servants there's
[1:30:47] only one door in
[1:30:48] there's only one door into the feast
[1:30:50] she's got to get in there
[1:30:51] hallelujah we can come to church there
[1:30:53] can be a lot of obstacles
[1:30:55] we just had a busy week the devil's been
[1:30:57] jumping down up and down on our heads
[1:30:59] we've had trouble sickness strife going
[1:31:01] on and different feelings whatever more
[1:31:03] they're gonna be a lot of things in the
[1:31:04] way
[1:31:05] but she was determined i have this
[1:31:07] alabaster box
[1:31:08] i'm gonna i'm gonna i want to anoint him
[1:31:11] hallelujah she had no idea how she was
[1:31:13] gonna be received
[1:31:14] somehow she got past the guards i don't
[1:31:16] know how she did it but you know
[1:31:18] if there's a if there's a desire there's
[1:31:21] a way through
[1:31:22] if there's a burden there's a way
[1:31:23] through it may seem impossible but
[1:31:26] there's a way through
[1:31:27] god just somehow opens doors where there
[1:31:29] seems to be no door
[1:31:30] he makes a way where there seems to be
[1:31:31] no way so somehow she slipped past the
[1:31:34] guards slipped past all these ones and
[1:31:36] you know if we can backtrack a little
[1:31:39] bit
[1:31:39] can you imagine the attitude of the even
[1:31:42] even
[1:31:43] even the even the thought when simon
[1:31:46] said don't wash this man's feet
[1:31:48] no doubt some of the servants would have
[1:31:50] been getting a bit upset in themselves
[1:31:52] he's going to traipse all that dirt and
[1:31:54] that mud in here
[1:31:55] and he's going to make these pillows
[1:31:57] messy and the carpets messy and all the
[1:31:59] job you know
[1:32:00] and maybe i think in their mind well
[1:32:01] what if we wash his feet so he doesn't
[1:32:03] do this or make our life easier
[1:32:04] afterwards
[1:32:06] but they're all worried about simon
[1:32:09] anyway she grabs her alabaster box
[1:32:12] she gets through and she's looking for
[1:32:15] someone
[1:32:15] and she sees him locks you know
[1:32:19] sees them no doubt maybe some people are
[1:32:21] turning around looking to who she is
[1:32:23] who's this one coming to my feast who's
[1:32:25] this one you know
[1:32:26] and she makes a beeline straight for his
[1:32:28] feet she has no idea how she's going to
[1:32:31] be received
[1:32:32] hallelujah she has no idea remember this
[1:32:34] man's a prophet he can look straight
[1:32:36] through someone
[1:32:37] and see their heart and their condition
[1:32:39] but that's the kind of people god wants
[1:32:41] at his feet
[1:32:42] amen it's not those people who have who
[1:32:44] have the attitude i've got it all
[1:32:46] together
[1:32:47] look i've been in the message four
[1:32:48] billion years i'm fine you know
[1:32:50] i know all the quotes and all the
[1:32:52] doctrine and you know you know my phone
[1:32:54] can out quote me
[1:32:56] and in many languages that can out quote
[1:32:58] me right
[1:33:00] it can my phone can out quote me with
[1:33:02] the scripture
[1:33:04] but god i'm taking this in a rapture the
[1:33:06] devil cannot quote me
[1:33:09] hallelujah he can't but he can't produce
[1:33:12] the life
[1:33:14] right so we must never get an attitude
[1:33:16] well i know it all
[1:33:17] no we don't know it all we're on our
[1:33:19] journey
[1:33:20] god is still ministering to us and
[1:33:22] making us more like him so she runs in
[1:33:24] she has no idea
[1:33:26] am i going to be received by the is he
[1:33:27] going to pull his feet away what's he
[1:33:29] going to do but there's something when
[1:33:30] you get into the prince of god
[1:33:32] you begin to act a little bit hysterical
[1:33:35] she began to cry
[1:33:36] hello she wasn't all stoic and and you
[1:33:39] know
[1:33:39] lifeless but you know she something
[1:33:41] moved on her heart because she as she
[1:33:43] began to pour her life out at his feet
[1:33:45] she realized here i am stepping into the
[1:33:47] holiest of holies
[1:33:49] hear me blackened out a sinner lost to
[1:33:52] begin with but now i'm standing in the
[1:33:54] prince of more than just a man
[1:33:56] hallelujah she wasn't waiting for what
[1:33:58] everyone else was doing
[1:33:59] she didn't care about everyone else she
[1:34:01] said i've got to get to him i've got to
[1:34:03] anoint him
[1:34:04] and she takes the alabaster box now
[1:34:05] winner alabaster box is broken you can't
[1:34:08] put it back together
[1:34:09] hallelujah it's broken so she came
[1:34:12] past but the thing is when she looked in
[1:34:16] and she saw that he wasn't made welcome
[1:34:18] she had already crossed a point of no
[1:34:19] return
[1:34:21] she had already crossed the point of no
[1:34:23] return what do you mean by a point of no
[1:34:24] return
[1:34:25] or maybe i won't do this today maybe
[1:34:27] it's a bad idea
[1:34:28] she crossed the point of no return she
[1:34:30] made up in her heart i'm going to anoint
[1:34:32] this man
[1:34:33] i'm going to anoint this prophet and she
[1:34:35] gave all of her money
[1:34:37] she yeah because what that was a
[1:34:38] manifestation when you cross a point of
[1:34:40] no return
[1:34:42] i don't care what the world says about
[1:34:43] me what my friends say about me what my
[1:34:45] family says about me what anyone says
[1:34:46] about me i don't care what they say
[1:34:48] i've crossed the point of no return i'm
[1:34:50] going all the way jesus i'm going all
[1:34:52] the way
[1:34:52] what your word says to do i shall do how
[1:34:54] i shall be i shall be
[1:34:56] i mean like ruth she came to a point
[1:34:59] naomi
[1:35:00] your god is my god your people my people
[1:35:03] will you die i'll die
[1:35:04] she passed a point of no return
[1:35:07] hallelujah
[1:35:08] isn't it glorious to break through that
[1:35:10] sound barrier you just make up your mind
[1:35:12] somehow god makes up your mind for you
[1:35:14] a lot of wrestling going on and this but
[1:35:16] then god just makes up your mind no
[1:35:17] you're going to cross this point
[1:35:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:22] so she goes in she breaks her alabaster
[1:35:25] box she pulls her whole life out of his
[1:35:27] feet
[1:35:28] hallelujah and then she begins to weep
[1:35:31] because we get a bit hysterical when we
[1:35:34] get into the prince of god and there she
[1:35:37] is pouring her life out
[1:35:39] you know it's amazing in the presence of
[1:35:42] god
[1:35:44] when someone thinks something an answer
[1:35:46] comes
[1:35:47] because her whole worship didn't just
[1:35:51] stay in a corner
[1:35:53] she hadn't asked permission to do it
[1:35:54] either but the fragrance that ointment
[1:35:56] filled the whole house and her weeping
[1:35:59] and her crying and her losing thank you
[1:36:01] jesus and forgive me i've lost it
[1:36:03] forgive me lord and here i am
[1:36:06] fill the whole house and it interrupted
[1:36:09] their
[1:36:10] third course and maybe some others were
[1:36:13] looked over and
[1:36:14] some others who would have thought i
[1:36:16] should do that
[1:36:17] yes but they didn't step up and join her
[1:36:22] see it's an individual affair with god
[1:36:24] it's not me and everyone else and if
[1:36:26] they're doing it well everyone else is
[1:36:28] doing it that's probably the silliest
[1:36:29] silliest reason ever but no one else got
[1:36:32] up
[1:36:33] even though they probably would have
[1:36:34] thought i'm glad his feet are being
[1:36:35] washed
[1:36:37] you can't just sympathize with us with
[1:36:39] the gospel
[1:36:40] you've got to partake of the gospel
[1:36:42] hallelujah
[1:36:43] so here they are and the whole whole
[1:36:46] whole thing's being interrupted
[1:36:47] because of this woman and then simon
[1:36:51] thinks within himself
[1:36:52] if he really was a prophet
[1:36:56] if he were see this just proves me this
[1:36:58] man is not what he claims to be
[1:37:01] he would have known what manner of woman
[1:37:03] this is that toucheth him for she
[1:37:06] is a sinner as he's thinking that
[1:37:09] an answer is going to come
[1:37:12] and jesus answering said unto him no he
[1:37:14] didn't say this out loud he thought it
[1:37:16] in his heart
[1:37:17] and then he said simon i have somewhat
[1:37:19] to say unto thee
[1:37:21] and he saith master sayon there were
[1:37:24] certain creditors which had two debtors
[1:37:26] one owed 500 pence and the other 50.
[1:37:30] and when they had nothing to pay he
[1:37:31] frankly forgave them both tell me
[1:37:33] therefore which of them will he love
[1:37:35] love him most simon answer said i
[1:37:38] suppose that he to whom
[1:37:39] he forgave most and he said unto him
[1:37:42] thou has rightly judged
[1:37:43] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:37:45] and said unto simon
[1:37:47] see us thou this woman i entered into
[1:37:49] thy house that gave us me no water for
[1:37:50] my feet
[1:37:51] for she hath washed my feet with her
[1:37:53] tears and wiped them with the hairs of
[1:37:55] her head
[1:37:56] she thou gave us me no kiss but that but
[1:37:58] this woman since the time i came in has
[1:38:00] not ceased to kiss my feet
[1:38:02] my head with oil thou does not anoint
[1:38:04] but this woman hath anointed my feet
[1:38:05] with ointment
[1:38:06] wherefore i say unto thee her sins which
[1:38:08] are many are forgiven
[1:38:09] for she loved much but to whom little is
[1:38:12] forgiven the same loveth little
[1:38:14] and he said unto her thy sins are
[1:38:16] forgiven now you think about that
[1:38:18] really our sin debt is all the same it
[1:38:22] may be
[1:38:23] on paper on our human mind someone's
[1:38:25] more of a sinner than the other
[1:38:27] but really sin is sin we're all born in
[1:38:29] sin
[1:38:30] the wages of sin is death it's the same
[1:38:32] wages
[1:38:33] right so in reality if we are forgiven
[1:38:37] much
[1:38:38] we will love much so if we're really
[1:38:41] forgiven who knows they're forgiven
[1:38:42] today amen
[1:38:43] the lord has washed all your sins away
[1:38:46] amen so therefore
[1:38:47] if he's done that irrespective of your
[1:38:49] past it doesn't matter what past we came
[1:38:51] came from but he's forgiven it all other
[1:38:55] so if he's forgiven at all
[1:38:56] then we love much but if someone legally
[1:38:59] tries to justify their old life and who
[1:39:02] they are then they'll begin to quantify
[1:39:03] things
[1:39:04] well my old life wasn't as bad as that
[1:39:06] guy and that protocol and this one
[1:39:08] and what happens is they begin to
[1:39:09] quantify it therefore they'll love
[1:39:11] little
[1:39:12] because they think they were forgiven of
[1:39:13] less than the other guy who is forgiven
[1:39:16] of more
[1:39:17] are you following me amen amen but
[1:39:20] those who are truly know the forgiveness
[1:39:22] of god as brother ahmad said this
[1:39:23] morning a pardon
[1:39:24] is not a pardon unless it's accepted as
[1:39:26] a pardon and those who have truly
[1:39:28] accepted that part and they know they
[1:39:30] will love much because they have been
[1:39:31] forgiven much
[1:39:33] hallelujah amen and he said unto her thy
[1:39:37] sins are forgiven and they that sat
[1:39:39] at meat with him begin to say within
[1:39:40] themselves who is this the forgiveth
[1:39:43] sins also
[1:39:45] and he said to the woman thy faith is
[1:39:47] safety go
[1:39:48] in peace hallelujah
[1:39:52] see there'll always be someone who will
[1:39:54] anoint the word
[1:39:55] yes there'll always be someone who'll
[1:39:57] anoint the word
[1:39:58] that will go beyond the status quo of
[1:40:00] life and
[1:40:01] you know they'll actually go beyond what
[1:40:03] everyone else is doing everyone else is
[1:40:04] thinking
[1:40:05] oh will this be okay she didn't ask
[1:40:07] anyone she had to anoint the word
[1:40:10] that was her burden this word must be
[1:40:12] anointed
[1:40:13] i must put it but i must sit at its feet
[1:40:15] hallelujah
[1:40:16] and that's what she did amen and she as
[1:40:19] a true believer receives
[1:40:21] hallelujah she left that place she
[1:40:24] didn't know maybe she didn't she didn't
[1:40:26] sneak out she just probably would have
[1:40:28] walked out i've been forgiven
[1:40:30] i've been washed in the blood of the
[1:40:31] lamb hallelujah
[1:40:33] she had no more money to her name but
[1:40:34] she didn't care because she had given it
[1:40:36] all to the right
[1:40:37] hallelujah hallelujah and she walked out
[1:40:42] forgiven now
[1:40:46] let's just bring this down on home what
[1:40:48] bible character are you
[1:40:50] amen are you simon the pharisee tries to
[1:40:53] put a dampner on on god living now i'm
[1:40:55] not just talking about i'm not really
[1:40:56] even talking about him i'm talking about
[1:40:57] what about in your home
[1:40:59] we can be simon the pharisee in our own
[1:41:01] home where it just becomes a religious
[1:41:03] order and gods
[1:41:04] can't even get in there and you know
[1:41:06] because of attitudes and so on and
[1:41:08] you know are we like that
[1:41:11] oh see the biggest problem people have
[1:41:13] is letting go and letting god do us
[1:41:15] do what he wants to do are we like that
[1:41:19] or are we what like the foot wash flunky
[1:41:22] or the other servants
[1:41:23] that they'd rather hold on to their next
[1:41:25] coin hold on to job security
[1:41:28] i'm secure in my little life this is all
[1:41:30] i know
[1:41:31] my dad was a foot wash flunky his his
[1:41:33] dad was a foot washed slunky i come from
[1:41:35] a great line of footwash slunkies
[1:41:37] and and and two and to go against my
[1:41:39] boss i'll now get fired and that means
[1:41:41] i've got to step into the unknown
[1:41:43] it's worth stepping into the unknown
[1:41:44] with god because he knows the unknown
[1:41:47] so are we that kind of people or what
[1:41:49] about the one who anoints and they say
[1:41:51] well
[1:41:51] if that person does it first then i'll
[1:41:53] just i'll just join in
[1:41:56] are we that kind of people remember
[1:42:00] your life is like brother brahm says
[1:42:02] your life that you're currently living
[1:42:04] shows you who you are in the scripture
[1:42:06] or are we like the woman with the
[1:42:09] alabaster box
[1:42:12] hallelujah where wait hey i wasn't
[1:42:13] invited to this thing
[1:42:16] do you think about this i'm not talking
[1:42:17] about simon's house now i'm talking
[1:42:18] about the spiritual feast of the word
[1:42:20] i wasn't invited i wasn't on the first
[1:42:22] guest list
[1:42:23] but then there came a call where god
[1:42:25] said go to the highways and to the
[1:42:27] byways get the good
[1:42:29] get the bad get the maim to halt the
[1:42:31] blind whatever they are
[1:42:33] doesn't matter what condition they are
[1:42:34] go get them and compel them to come
[1:42:37] and one day the lord came my way and
[1:42:38] said you're you're made by the world
[1:42:41] you're blind you can't see
[1:42:42] amen your halt amen you're you're bad
[1:42:45] hallelujah
[1:42:45] he said get the good and the bad
[1:42:46] hallelujah so it doesn't matter what
[1:42:48] condition
[1:42:49] and and the spiritual compelled me and i
[1:42:51] found i wasn't on the first guest list
[1:42:53] but i ended up in the feast
[1:42:56] if i can put it that way i'm using the
[1:42:57] parable of the wedding feast
[1:42:59] we all know where i am hallelujah she's
[1:43:01] having to find ourselves here she wasn't
[1:43:03] invited but she was the one who really
[1:43:05] made the party the party
[1:43:08] hallelujah
[1:43:12] and i'm going to leave that with you
[1:43:15] what is your life is your life anointing
[1:43:17] the word that it lives
[1:43:20] hallelujah giving it first place that he
[1:43:23] lives
[1:43:24] or they say well if this person breaks
[1:43:27] through
[1:43:28] then i'll break through if that person
[1:43:29] gets the holy ghost then i'll get the
[1:43:31] whole i'll just join right in with it

[1:44:15] the nuremberg trials the nazis at the

[2:12:40] have a
[2:12:41] two-way conversation with god and he
[2:12:43] starts helping you
[2:12:45] and guiding you on what is actually the
[2:12:47] truth for your day
[2:12:49] but but don't get hard don't get busy
