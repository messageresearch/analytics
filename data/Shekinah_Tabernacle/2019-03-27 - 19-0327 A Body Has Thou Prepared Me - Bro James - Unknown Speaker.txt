[Music] I mean hopefully should stand as we create the work we'll go to a bruise this fighting this fight and you just five points PowerPoint and you'll get some reason that's not bringing amen just like my slideshow and I'll start and he opened it PowerPoint that's called a body thou has prepared Hebrews 10 verse 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body thou has prepared me the time it pray dear Heavenly Father Lord we just pray father that you just come and just anoint this word Lord I only see Lord that Satan were just trying to attack what I'm trying to show the people father Lord we just pray that your Holy Spirit would come down like oh Jesus just cast the devil out of this place we love you we thank you and we praise you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ so a time had come when God had been building this masterpiece up through the Old Testament and he had built it up to the point where now the son was going to camp because God no longer wanted the sacrifice of bulls and goats all right he wanted a body they wanted a body to dwell in and he wants exactly the same thing in a second coming he wants a body to dwell in and the scripture that we just read it can apply also to this coming God has always chose man to express himself and the whole Bible was an expression of the character of Jesus Christ everything that was in Christ is on display even the bat that good you know the good things but also the bad things that ugly things us all revealed and the Bible but there was going to have to come a time where Jesus Christ would come into the world and break that cycle of sacrifice and bring us into into the blood atonement of Christ right and John 1:18 it said no man has seen God at any time there a low hand the eternal thought no man had seen God at any time the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared so in the first coming it was being declared and in the seeking coming it would do just the same the expressed and the Jesus would be expressed in the flesh and he's going to work through a prepared body and we know brother Branham taught three comings of the Lord right not two comings like the world see but three comings because this first coming was to redeem his bride and his seeking coming was in his bride and the third coming he comes with his bride so we can't mix up those coming and his bride and coming with us Brian yeah God has always had a three-fold plan like he's completed in threes and there's a work to be done on the body of Christ and the seeking coming and it started with that shout where he himself descended but he never left he continues and now he has a voice and their voices and the bride and it continues right on to the final right body thou has prepared me it was Christ and brother Brennan revealing the Son of Man and its Christ and the bride I mean when when when the prophet went off the scene God didn't go off the scene God stay amen have you got that brother can you give me a remote and take me on to the second slide x1 verse 7 and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth this is our this is our mission to get this word to the uttermost parts and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked up steadfastly towards heaven as he went behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven the same Jesus which has taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him going together it wasn't every man that saw him ascend into heaven it was just the ones that he came to his bride and not every man will see him when he returns it will be those that are looking for him why because the world's looking for now Pierce hands and we're not looking for now Pierce hands we're looking for the Word made flesh I mean and he's returned and like manna and the son of man ministry and the son of man has declared and said that's our Judge up there he was declaring the coming of the Lord I think I've got control of this Matthew 28 verse 16 then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted and he has returned and like manner that he went up and he's been declared there's our judge and his bride believed amen but some doubted so don't worry about the people that doubt this message that wasn't given to them to receive the message and they're just fulfilling the scripture because some doubted and right now he's working in the church and I believe he's working in this church and he has a ministry and my question to myself was what is their ministry what is their ministry that's on the bride Matthew 8 verse 19 and certain scribe came to him and said unto her master I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest and jesus saith unto Him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head so they were asking him where is your kingdom we're weird where do you go I thought the son of David come to establish a kingdom where do you lay your head and King David you know he thought the same thing he wanted to build the Lord a house but the Lord didn't want to dwell in the house made by hands he wanted to dwell and Men and so the Lord's been building up this bride through seven church ages until she can come into a maturity and because that Capstone's got to come down the seeking coming that's the headship and it's coming to the body so now he has a place where he can lay his head today that scripture is fulfilled I mean the bride will be Christ himself expressed and the flesh brother Brennan said she is him just as he was in his first coming so will he be in a second coming the bride is the feminine part of God right so in when God took Adam and he said it's not good that man be alone and so Lucy creates men and he takes a lump of dirt and he creates men and now he's gonna and now he's saying now I'm going to create a bright because he doesn't go and grab a different month do it man it grabs the same lump the same lump that Adam was made out of he takes out an ad on the site so the brightest every part of Christ as he is part of private it's just been separated to the express to the body the marriage of uniting us here and mighty goddamn bow before us then it was God in them days it was God and a man but his son Jesus the Son Jesus Christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man ordinary human it was God in Christ God and man the fullness of the Godhead bodily and a man God and a man yeah I mean now it's God and men the fullness of God and the Godhead bodily and his entire church manifesting himself manifesting himself fulfilling his word now we find God and all ages has had skin on earth he God has been hid behind a veil is this not working so the Lord showed me something and it's quite hard to Express so I really just I just pray the Lord will help me to show you it the way that he revealed it to me so I want to go back and look at the Tabernacle in the wilderness because it's revealing something for our day because the Old Testament was a shadow right yeah a shadow was not the real so if you see my shadow on the wall there and that but that's not actually me it's only it's only a shadow of me it's showing the real thing but the shadow is not the real thing so the Tabernacle in the wilderness was not the real thing but it was a shadow of the real thing that would be expressed that's his full bedroom it was a shadow of the real thing that would be expressed in the New Testament and we know it had three courts our outer court the inner court and the Holy of Holies and it's our body our spirit and our soul represented and inside the Holy of Holies was the mercy seat which as Jesus Christ Christ was a true mercy seat but the tabernacle was veiled with badger skins and I asked myself brother Branham talks about us all the time they were behind badger skins so I started searching deeper what what does this mean so we're going to come to that in a minute the next was a scam of Iran it was dyed red showing the blood offering Isaac being offered up the hat to be an offering he had to come through the blood before you could have access to come further into the tent to approach than the SEC so and Easterns revised Bible dictionary this is on the on the Bible on or anywhere you find your Bible dictionary this is the revised version and they said the word badger skin is found in Exodus these scriptures and in numbers the tabernacle was covered with badger skins the shoes of woman were also made of them in Ezekiel our translators seemed to have been mislead by the similarity and the sound of the Hebrew takács and the Latin Texas a badger the revisers have correctly substituted seal skills Wow Wow because this is just a shadow right and now the whole team is hidden behind the seals so it's going to take the opening of the seals coming and approach Christ I also found it interesting that this badger skins that's true that's mentioned six times in Exodus and if you know your Bible numbers sex has always got about to reveal something in the seventh of a six waterpots revealing Christ there was a seventh right so I thought this is something going to happen here and the next time the seventh time it's mentioned as a numbers chapter four which is also an important number number of deliverance so numbers for first five it says and when the camp sitteth fourth so now they're talking about when the camp moves right Aaron shall come and his sons and they shall take down the covering Bale and cover the Ark of the testimony with it and shall put there on the covering of badger skins and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue and shall put on the staves thereof so the tents about to be packed up to be moved and I thought what's this picture painting because if the bible's painting a picture here of what they did with the mercy seat when they when they moved there was a process of how they moved the mercy seat in Christ as that mercy seat and he's wrapped up in a vow that the veil was broke at Calvary right the veil was torn at Calvary giving men access to the mercy seat but the fullness of Christ was still to be wrapped up in a mystery and had behind seven seals head behind skin God still veiled behind skin bailed behind the seals so why a cloth of blue I R so I studied what is blue mean in the Bible what does it represent and blue I found as representing the law and so I searched in the Bible blue and I found it came out 49 times and the Old Testament 49 times 49 the 49th year was the longest year right because why we were held under law and so then you go over into the new test and that and the word blue is not even mentioned at all it's not even in the New Testament so then I went to my other Bible app that I had and i typed in blue and it came out 50 times and I thought what's going on here why is the Bible contradicting itself what happened in the second Bible ever brought up another word that the first Bible web didn't and that was blue Ness so the word I had still had blowing up a balloon s and so I found out and I thought oh yeah this is very interesting yeah so it come up in proverbs 20 verse 30 so straightaway I thought oh 50 so here's my 50th verse coming into this blue and it says the blueness of a wound cleans up the way evil so do the stripes that n-word parts of the belly so now we're going to transition from law of the Old Testament and to the Grace and the New Testament and we know in Isaiah 53 it says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised see the blueness right the blueness of a wound cleanses the way evil he was bruised for our iniquity and and and the so do the stripes and wood parts of our bella le and by his stripes we were healed amen it's the jubilee which breaks us away from the law you know though we fall though before we shall not be cast down amen the sounding of Revelation 10 seven has broken you free from the law of men and from tradition and that's why you know you say well we have that we have if we're not under the law we can just sin right but it's not it's not that we're under a law but when C relied you know she lied directly to God in God could have killed it but she was under grace because she was a part of of Christ right Jacob he lied upon the name of God but he was a part of Christ but we don't we just we don't sin we live a holy life because we love Christ not because we're under the law and you will neither come into the fullness of this message and see Christ while you're stuck under that book you will not see God doesn't roll over his bride with law yeah he doesn't want to bribe that Susan out of out of been suppressed like a controlling husband that controls his wife she she she just as with him because she's scared she'll get a beating I mean he wants a wife that serves because she loves him so you know it's other laws that have been broken the law of gravity right don't tell me to be quiet and sit down in my view I mean that law of gravity has been broken I found it funny one time Nadine was riding a bike and she was texting and I said that's not a good idea she said there's no law against that I said here there is it's called the law of gravity but we're defining gravity you know often thought about this that's that law of gravity that stops you from raising your hand and surrender to Christ we go I surrender all okay now the police come in here and say put your hands up I surrender what are we give Christ you know what do we get the devil what do we give Christ we ought to fall surrender as we love [Music] and shall put there on the covering of badger skins and shall spread over a cloth holy of blue and she'll put the staves and the staves zero to get to the mercy seat you had to break through the law break through that blue cross you have to be freed from the law before you can go through the opening of the seals and approach that in a veil to go through that in a veil you can't even go through the in avail until the seals are opened and now you come right into the place where Christ is amen all wrapped up in a mystery so don't get stuck in tradition don't get caught up looking at the law you can have an intellectual understanding of this message right yeah and you can have an understanding of the seals yeah but still have very little revelation and what will happen the devil will get you looking at everybody else's fault what about the mote that's and all he's doing is robbing your attention yeah he doesn't want you to get anything out of the service so instead of receiving from the ministry you're looking or looking at the preacher going there or you're looking at someone else man whose skirts short today I can even see her knees or something else and you'll you know help us not to be like that because that's been broken and what you need to realize is you have an opportunity to help that person and you're going to sit there and judge them and put them out of the body so it's how do you apply your ministry towards the issue that you've maybe recognized until you can recognize the trumpet sound sounding the jubilee you can not see Christ the word as he's hidden behind those seven seals this whole mystery this whole picture of this Tabernacle wrapped up and this picture and you have no access to that mercy seat without coming through the process that's been laid out the other interesting thing was all the precious things of this Tabernacle when it was moved were wrapped up and badger skins and seal skins so the seven golden candlesticks they took it down they wrapped it up in a seal skin so you can't even see the messengers to the church age until the seals are open and you can see them these badger skins and regards to the tabernacle were mentioned six times in Exodus and seven times and numbers making thirteen we know thirteen as a number of a woman so what's it showing us this whole tabernacle is showing a picture of a woman because brother Branham said it was husband in the Old Testament and wife and the New Testament and this was the shadow so I was showing Christ at the same picture and the New Testament are showing a woman it's all about marriage a seventh seal and it's revealed and every type in the Bible and just in case you search this and look and you see badger skins come out 14 times the last verse which is in Ezekiel it talks about the sandals that the woman would wear so now as a picture of a woman that's got her feet shod with the gospel the opening of the word walking in the light of the word that just all pieces together it's just amazing he's leased some very important work to be done in this time and he will now work through his bride bespoken weirdest original see those in the bride do only as well no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God and them doing the works for filling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen there's been a work leaf to do in this time and this breach right we're in a breach between the church ages and the Millennium because brother Brennan showed us when Christ came the first time he come a son of man but in through the church agents he was son of God but then there would come a time at the end of the Laodicean Church age spiritually that he would come again as son of man before he's the son of David in the Millennium so we're right in this breach now right in this breach time and there's been a work lift to do we actually have a part in the plan of redemption for this day and the time of Easter there would have been no hopefully for God's people if she didn't play her part in God's plan of redemption right the whole plan of redemption for God's people actually rested on Easter do you think of that and how important our ministry then is our God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voices and the bride as we have said so my three questions do you recognize who he is and some some response do you recognize who he is do you recognize who you are I mean until we do we know what our ministry is what's our ministry because this is what I'm asking myself what's the work that he wants to do through me and a second coming identified masterpiece of God he is making a bride yes sir he is hoeing the chips now chopping off the world Oh church joining in creeds and denominations and dogmas all has to be cut away from the church the formal ideas their indifference their doctrines and things come back and let the master pick up the bow let the master pick you up in his hands strike the word say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now this is incredible say Amen Lord make me mold me make me Lord what I should be then there'll be a different thing then if I be lifted up from the earth I'll draw all men unto me amen now he's placing the scripture on the bride if she'd be lifted up she'll draw me in unto her because he's been a bride call that's called you out of Revelation chapter 3 right through the opening of the word and to Revelation chapter 4 and we're under their eagle anointing that rapture anointing will have been lifted up and now we're in a position where we can call the bride why cause we're repro for saying the same word that's already being spoken as a rapture taking place right now through the descending the shout the voice of Trump and he's calling us up out of Darkness and as he's lifting you up you know we've got to these Rebekah's and Stokes Valley you know there's Rebecca's in Vietnam this still a Rebecca to be called and this still has to be in a liaison ministry going out to call the Rebecca's no man could come unto Jesus unless he drawed them and the son of man through his bride as now calling his own the Prophet Elisha was the first fruit of the resurrection to call bride that Christ didn't leave with brother Brennan yeah but he played placed a double portion of that same spirit onto Elijah and the ministry continues the bride call as continuing through you revelation 10 verse 8 right you must eat the book and reprocess I the word there's some Debra's in this church that are already up the mountain that have already been lifted up they're placed right there set mature and Deborah was dwelling up Mount Ephraim and now Ephraim means to be I will be doubly fruitful and Deborah is calling down into the valley where JJ Ella's and she's under the suppression of cesira and she but she wants to Sarah to come up so Sarah the devil was going to be sold into the hand of a woman jo was predestinated but she's not in her mature place yet but there is a mature one that's helping her come near that legalistic you know we're not judging our brother or sister that's doing wrong but we're going to go and help them come into the same maturity of the word because jail hos under that suppression she has to take so Sarah into her own tent and strike the tent pig through the temples right through the temples which is the battleground and the mind she has to crucify the devil in her own mind because you cannot be united to Christ until your old husband is dead not divorced did Amen he continues this quote he's cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only cutting all the creeds and dogmas everything away from you trying to get you back to a bride for the son another masterpiece part of the word that word Jesus couldn't take that place you remember that day when they read in the book he read just a part of the prophecy left the rest of it for the last day we're supposed to take them so this is six months before he comes and preaches in me such birth pains and you know what happens on birth pains brother Brennan goes to take his test and the page is stuck together and he can't find his place in the tears and a Catholic priest gets up from the back and he's all dressed in his robes and he comes up and he said God's fixing to do something read out of my book so brother Brennan takes his book and he reads his text and he carries on doesn't think anything about it he's still focused on why his pages were stuck together but then as he was driving home I think the Lord says to him remember the time where Jesus went into the temple and the priests gave him the book and he read and he said this day the scripture is fulfilled so now in the second coming of Christ right and brother Brennan is in the same situation and in the priests hands in the book and he preaches the second part of the verse and he says this day the scriptures were thought that scripture related to Christ right so now he's showing the son of man ministry this day the scriptures fulfill and brother Branham was preaching birth pains which was the Vengeance of the Lord she's now groaning in pre tribulation and shaking she's burning about to give way to a more glorious one and the Lord shows him this day the second the second part of the scripture has been fulfilled the same Jesus Christ again behind the skin veil and a prophet but when Christ descended and veiled himself behind the Prophet God didn't leave with that prophet he just failed himself again behind skin and a bride hallelujah we're living in the second coming of Christ you know when Jesus came the first time when was his first coming was it when the star appeared and they said the Christ has come or was it when when the seed was placed inside the womb of Mary was that the start was that the first coming of the law or was that when he was born or was it when John the Baptist baptized and was that the first coming of the Lord or was that when he was on the cross and as he's dying and the graves opened and some of the dead raised up out of the grave was that the first camera or was the whole thing the first coming of the Lord then how should it be any different for the second coming it's not a single event right it was declared that brother Branham was the first fruit of the resurrection and it ends with the dead in Christ just like the first coming right amen it's a cycle what I found interesting just a little bit after he preached birth pains he preaches choosing of a bride and now he takes the sticks from Sam's and it takes from Revelation 21 verse 9 and he places himself in Revelation 21 verse 9 as the seventh vial angel because his ministry was to bring vengeance as started their cycle so at the opening of the word and the people rejected the word they crucified Christ for the second time and it started a cycle that was going to end with the full tribulation period right they said right now we're in pre tribulation but not all of this prophecy was fulfilled that day the scripture carried on right and there's an elijah pride ministry trailing right behind elijah to continue the work so i'll just pick it up and look for 17 and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he read when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance and to the captives recovering sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and he sat down and all eyes were and sinning were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day the scripture is fulfilled is same picture as what happens in the second coming right and the scripture he takes it from as as I a 61 verse 2 to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord that's what Christ did right he doesn't come to judge the world not first coming he splits averse and the day of the vengeance of our God so now he comes to judge the world and the seeking coming but it doesn't end there it still carries on and this is where Elijah ministry picks up with a Brides ministry picks up and continues on to comfort all that mourn to a point unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified so we have a message to re prophesied of the world not a different message the same message right and our message as the world is and birth pains she's gone and this is the Uniting time you either unite to Christ or you perish but the world and there's only one place that he has provided that you can find that mercy seat and the bride is the mercy seat today right she is that she can be approached if you give you entertain angels unawares you offer somebody something and you actually don't realize that could be the Bride of Christ and the way that you treat that person may reflect on you when your face the white throne judgment and I'm not going to go too much on that because I want to look at that at another time a body thou has prepared me as bride to dwell Jesus is not far off I think I heard brother a man say Jesus is not far off away in some other world he's right here tonight and you can touch the hem of His garment he's manifesting himself again through you he's right here Jesus Christ I mean I look at you I see Christ why do I see Christ because I see the word made flesh in your life the bride is here for a purpose like Easter with a ministry God working through it so here to comfort all that mourn to appoint them that mourn in Zion and we know Zion is speaking of the bride to comfort all them that mourn and the bride yeah so how we were talking about not judging that helping to comfort all them that mourn and when to appoint all then that mourn in Zion and so in the Strong's when you look at this word and the Hebrew a point and means to put in place to sit in place so now it's the administrative Deborah putting that one that's not in her place you were pointing them appointing the bride showing her her place in the word to give them beauty for Ashes when I look into the mirror of God's Word it doesn't matter what my old life looks like I'm not looking at my old life I'm looking at the beauty that the Lord is doing sometimes it's hard but here's a ray doesn't find learn and clean away just don't criticize each other I just don't criticize because you have a ministry and an ability to put that person in their place through the word not through the heavy hand at all so this word for beauty and the Hebrew and means headdress or a turban to give them beauty for Ashes so they were once dead and their son but now you have the ability to give them beauty for Ashes a headship a headdress right because the headship has come that you can now have beauty for Ashes by putting on Christ instead of your old life that was dead you were born and sin and you were dead until that eternal seed that was inside you was quickened and lined up with the word lined up with your theophany Esther was head up to half the kingdom as yours you know why do you mourn why you said don't you know your inheritance don't you know what you have access to up to half of everything goes 5050 right marriage 50/50 sometimes we take a little more than 50 but Christ wants to give you 50 amen if you know who you are you will do the greater works brother Brennan seeing as you are a part of I am I am a part of I am it sees here the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness and garment and this text here and the Hebrew it means a mantle you have the garment of praise the mantle what was Elijah what did Elijah pick up when Elijah left the scene he picked up a largest mentor so now you have the garment of praise why because you've picked up the Christ and knew the same ministry you put on that same garment garment of praise and carry on the same ministry because Jesus has left the work to be fulfilled and he's given us a double portion so what Christ did and the Prophet we should be able to do twice as much when we realize who we are and when Christ comes in and we come into maturity we should be able to do twice what we see we're not going to let the devil win anything and it should give you happiness to know who you are and that we have the power of the Resurrection in us and we have the power to call Lazarus from the grave it was a loud voice that awakened Nazareth and we just read the voices and the bride we have that loud voice we just have to have the faith to use it we have the resurrection life within us to call a bride to life that's been suppressed that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord there's not one member of the bride coming in today without hearing this message I'm just bringing it to a close I purposely not looking at my watch it's not one member of the bride coming in today without hearing this message taking sides with Jesus well one message that I preached this is my justification for going overtime well the one message that I preached to you all look I've been preaching from one to six hours I think this is interesting one to six hours six is always revealing Christ right one to six hours to you on a message well if I had to use one of those messages I take a week to take it just a little bit here a little bit there see because it's been stored up here it's just so much it's just so hard to express to you thorry because it's just it just all lines up together Nix Nix paragraph it's on tapes it'll go worldwide on the tapes with people in their houses them tapes will fall right into the hands of the predestinated of God he can direct the word he'll direct everything just exactly to its course that's the reason he sent me back here to do the store up food overseas and that's why we must be so sensitive to the leading of the Lord because every predestinated seed of God will find this message will find them because God directs his word and he's directing you he's directing you right to wear that Cedars that they can hear this message you know brother Brennan said that and then I didn't even know how this works right but he said there's going to be a people they never had the chance to hear the message and he said they will be raised up in the Millenium and given an opportunity to hear the message I don't even know how that fits but that's how much God directs his word it's directing your children as well you know and new children you have a ministry God can send you to talk to somebody about us he uses everybody he doesn't just use the ministry the whole pride the ministry musicians can come up it's not by chance it's not by chance that you were there when someone cried out to God God placed you there it's not by chance that brother Andy's going to Vietnam at a certain date of time for a certain amount of time to a certain city has been pre appointed by God it's not by chance because he's directing it's not by a chance then brother Branham was unfund land and a boy was hit by a car and killed and it just happened to be that the Prophet was there and the Prophet had seen it in a vision years before the Prophet didn't know that deed boy was going to be in Finland but God directed him to go at Finland at a certain time right in a certain season right to a certain town to a certain road where the dead boy was hurt as he can direct his word brother Branham said I'm afraid we're not getting people to Christ and that stumbled me for a long time when I seen people really strongly preaching the message and I thought why just take this Bible and preach the Bible because the Prophet said we're not getting people to Christ and the Lord revealed to me that this word is Christ and this message as this and this is there and without without this message this is just incompetent because I don't understand it because it has to be open so you're not going to get people to Christ without showing them the opening of the seals for a start because the mercy seat was wrapped up in the seals and if we just preached milk all we're going to do is grow big babies right there has to be something that we're growing into because it's the word as an it yeah and when you apply the net on the right side of the boat it'll catch the trophic trout maybe a me read our text again we for when he cometh into the world he say it's a crow Feist and offering thou what us not but a body thou has prepared me and I want you to recognize it he has prepared a body and it's your body and it's Christ in you the same Christ that was in the Prophet it's the same Christ that's in you it's still the second coming it started in the Prophet that's still here and never lived I know there's a whole lot more to the bride's ministry and this is maybe just a opening to my thought of what is here ministry but this is just to show you the Lord is working through here it means so let's sing a couple of songs do we have that song let your word be born and a manger of my heart I said and worship extreme know how about more of you I mean more
