[14:17] I just want to deliver it in the name of
[14:19] our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[14:23] good evening so welcome to brother our
[14:26] month's Bibles another the use of all
[14:28] now our role you always have to have
[14:30] something to look at when I when I give
[14:32] a class for that I like giving classes
[14:34] so I'm gonna do this this evening a
[14:36] sunday-school class if you will allow me
[14:38] to do that so you all must now think
[14:41] like thirteen year olds and it's not
[14:44] hard trust me I do it every day
[14:46] and I mean just try to see what God
[14:51] wants to
[14:51] show you so if you feel you're getting
[14:53] tired start looking at the clock because
[14:57] I only got 20 minutes I'll try to to
[14:59] keep to my time so let us all just stand
[15:02] we're just going to read a script here
[15:04] and we going to go to Matthew 24 being a
[15:10] Sunday School class and we're going to
[15:12] start reading from verse 42 and we're
[15:16] going to read down to verse 47 Matthew
[15:25] 24 and we'll started with 42 now I was
[15:31] um I had I was praying the whole week
[15:33] cause I get nervous when I do these
[15:35] things basically before grown-ups
[15:37] because I think I I don't want to get
[15:38] things wrong but you know what if I
[15:40] don't try what Noah so be with me if I
[15:43] do say anything and and you you might
[15:46] not agree with it just just take it to
[15:48] the Lord and ask him to maybe show you
[15:49] what he but he showed me because this is
[15:51] what he showed me so I praise the Lord
[15:54] so let's just just start thee from verse
[15:56] 42 he sees watch the fall or you know
[15:59] not what hour your Lord do with come but
[16:04] know this that if a good man of the
[16:06] house had known in which the thief would
[16:09] time defeat would come he would have
[16:12] watched and would have suffered his
[16:14] house to be broken up they will be also
[16:18] ready for in such an hour as you think
[16:21] not the Son of man cometh who then is
[16:25] faithful and wise servant whom his Lord
[16:28] hath made ruler over his household to
[16:30] give him meat in due season blessed is
[16:35] that servant whom his Lord when he
[16:37] cometh shall find so doing verily I say
[16:41] unto you that ye shall make him ruler
[16:44] over all his goods may the Lord just
[16:48] listen to this word you can so I didn't
[16:54] come to to give you bad news I came to
[16:57] give you good news so so I'm gonna walk
[17:00] around cuz I love it but walking around
[17:01] so the reason why I put the clocks here
[17:04] is these one thing
[17:05] that we do really struggle and keeping
[17:07] in this modern age and it's time it is
[17:11] the most valuable asset we have in this
[17:14] time is time because it's running out it
[17:18] is actually run out and and if we look
[17:21] in the book of Revelation steam which is
[17:23] actually what I wanted to do the opening
[17:25] scripture but I I didn't really want to
[17:28] do it because uh I thought maybe it gets
[17:30] too serious
[17:31] but if we go to verse five it speaks
[17:35] about the angel that I saw standing upon
[17:38] the sea and upon the earth that lifted
[17:41] up his hand to heaven and sway by him
[17:43] that lever for ever and for ever who
[17:45] created heaven and all the things there
[17:47] are in and the earth and the things that
[17:50] therein are and this sea and the things
[17:53] which are therein that they should be
[17:56] time no longer so now I want to give you
[18:02] the thought there wasn't an angel that
[18:06] came to earth a messenger in the seventh
[18:11] churches now this messenger which we
[18:15] will read now in verse 7 because I want
[18:17] to go they came with the Commission and
[18:20] his Commission if we look at verse 7
[18:23] they cease but in the days of the voice
[18:25] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[18:28] to sound the mysteries of God should be
[18:31] finished as hath declared to the
[18:33] servants to his servants the prophets so
[18:37] we don't find that brother Branham came
[18:39] to earth for no reason yeah he is the
[18:42] messenger of the savin okay we all
[18:45] believe it I mean it's been vindicated
[18:47] we're not going to go down that path we
[18:49] just say it is what it is okay you
[18:52] either believe it or you don't that is
[18:54] between you and the Lord he will reveal
[18:55] more to you as you walk but there was a
[18:57] voice and see just before this voice
[19:00] that angels say time is no more so how
[19:03] much time if brother Branham has left
[19:05] this earth as a prophet 53 years ago do
[19:07] we actually have late so how precious is
[19:11] the time that we have lived so the only
[19:13] reason I say this now if this is where I
[19:15] get excited okay cuz
[19:19] time is given to us from God yeah so why
[19:22] did he put us into this earth why did he
[19:24] put us here you know young people we
[19:27] always ask why my year what am what is
[19:29] my goal what am i doing you know and we
[19:31] look at the clock and as we just look at
[19:33] the clock it does this wonderful thing
[19:36] keeps ticking no no seriously and you
[19:40] look at the clock and again and you go
[19:42] like man if I've done this for five
[19:43] minutes already only have 15 left you
[19:47] know that we've always against the clock
[19:49] you go to work and you sit down and
[19:51] you're going to start working and you
[19:52] find you start typing something and all
[19:54] the Sun is almost down so you can you do
[19:55] this and this and you and you keep the
[19:57] helping busy I'll pick when you get back
[19:58] you look o'clock it's lunchtime and then
[20:00] you in lunch time and then when you come
[20:02] back another guy stands you seeking your
[20:03] help and you're like oh we let go and at
[20:05] the end of the day you never get to
[20:07] finish your first job and you go now I
[20:10] have to do this at home so now your time
[20:13] became the work style that goes into
[20:16] your family time that goes into God's
[20:18] time do you see what happened now I'm
[20:20] just get stolen from us like there's
[20:22] nothing these these videos there's games
[20:24] there's all these these things that keep
[20:26] us busy reading too many books drinking
[20:29] too much coffee fellowshipping is never
[20:31] never again fellowship too much but it
[20:34] does take time with God though we're
[20:37] sharing testimony so we do all these
[20:39] things it does take time from God as
[20:41] well
[20:41] so we're doing God's work and we
[20:43] fellowshipping but there is also a time
[20:45] where we fellowship junkies has to go
[20:47] hey you know we have to go sleep
[20:49] tomorrow is work okay so I would
[20:52] encourage you let's see God gives us a
[20:54] time now I want to say why does God give
[20:56] us the time because we are time-tested
[20:59] memorials we are put on this earth to
[21:02] vex the devil yeah it is it is for God's
[21:05] glory it's for God's work all things
[21:07] were created by God for God so we
[21:09] actually just here for God so okay so
[21:12] now we bring it back if God is the
[21:14] keeper of our time and the one that
[21:16] gives us the time how much time do we
[21:18] eat back to him in your hope is a day
[21:22] and everybody suture or not because this
[21:24] week I've been searching mine and man I
[21:26] found I need to do a bit of a time shake
[21:30] seriously because I felt my
[21:32] of spending and my whole week five
[21:35] percent of my time dedicate the time to
[21:40] the Lord
[21:40] five percent I got shocked because when
[21:43] I'm looking at it so I get home and then
[21:46] there's a presentation to do now I'll
[21:47] share a bit of of work if I may just
[21:49] just because this is what happened this
[21:51] week I have a presentation to do a rush
[21:53] to presentation and in one of his Ummah
[21:55] go I first have to give my boys a bit of
[21:57] time and then about and then give my
[22:00] wife a bit of time and then I'll have to
[22:02] clean the fish tank and now I have to do
[22:03] a presentation and oh I forgot to do
[22:06] this and I run around so much that in
[22:07] the time I don't get to the presentation
[22:09] I get to my bed I go Neil I say okay
[22:11] Lord I'm gonna pray and I say lord thank
[22:13] you for this day everything is so
[22:14] wonderful thank you so much and so tired
[22:17] in a full estate or you just go lie on
[22:20] the benny go okay I'm gonna pray now I
[22:21] just want to read my buck gone and it
[22:23] happens now I'm thinking if God gives me
[22:26] time and in any and he puts me on this
[22:29] earth to be for him at work at his time
[22:31] he's actually the main employer of us
[22:33] what am I giving back
[22:35] and so I started thinking with this why
[22:40] does he give me time why does he give me
[22:43] all this time to work with because I
[22:45] have to be a good steward because if we
[22:48] look at this story there was five
[22:50] foolish virgins and five wise this and
[22:54] this story is just before Jesus goes
[22:57] into the parable of the five foolish and
[22:59] five wise virgins we sees if you're a
[23:01] good steward and I return you will you
[23:05] will reign over your home basically you
[23:06] will have what you have then it goes
[23:08] right into it and he says that if you're
[23:10] a foolish man this is what happens and
[23:12] he goes into the parish parable of the
[23:14] the five foolish and the five wise now
[23:16] the five wise took the time got the oil
[23:20] got ready they also they also will
[23:24] waiting they were also looking at the
[23:25] clock and this is the kicker and just
[23:28] watching the time pass and go man it's
[23:29] late it's late
[23:31] he's not coming but he said he'll come
[23:33] but it's late and the five that didn't
[23:36] take time to store up the oil that
[23:39] didn't take time to get into the wood to
[23:42] have a relationship with the was the one
[23:44] coming to marry them
[23:46] they messed up they actually fell asleep
[23:48] and and so when the loud shout came all
[23:52] of them fell asleep now this is the
[23:54] kicker all of them fell asleep so they
[23:58] they had the wine they took the time to
[24:00] store up like brother branham stored up
[24:01] all this lovely food for us to go and
[24:03] eat in the message
[24:04] any-any he spent a thousand how many
[24:07] over a thousand even more sermons he
[24:09] preached and he just stored up all these
[24:11] food for us to go in and eat and take a
[24:13] bit of time to help us to strengthen us
[24:16] so we don't fall asleep because if we
[24:19] don't have any time left young people if
[24:22] there's no more time left and that angel
[24:25] already declared the time is no more how
[24:28] much time do we have and we don't we
[24:31] don't come and try to scare you but if
[24:34] your whole day is going about what
[24:36] soccer balls to kick makes what am i
[24:38] doing tomorrow at school and man I want
[24:40] to play a bit more Legos and I want to
[24:43] watch that YouTube video and I can
[24:44] preach to the young people are finding a
[24:46] bindi so if we as young people and young
[24:50] people don't start throwing back that
[24:52] time what do we do because it's God's
[24:55] time so here comes the good news the
[24:59] time is there for a warning the reason
[25:03] why God put time on this earth and put
[25:04] us into time is it's a warning listen to
[25:08] this do the devil yes in Isaiah it says
[25:13] if in Ziya 14 verse 12 to 16 it's way
[25:16] way lucifer it says our son of Lucifer
[25:19] son of the morning and I'll go to it
[25:20] quickly because I got it you're my my
[25:23] it's easier how they ought fallen from
[25:27] heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how
[25:29] are they cut down to the ground which
[25:32] thou did that is weakened the nation's
[25:34] all thou has seed in thy heart I will
[25:38] ascend into heaven and I will exalt my
[25:40] throne above the stars of God and I will
[25:44] also sit upon the Mount of the
[25:45] congregation in the sides of the north
[25:48] and I was seen above the heights of the
[25:50] clouds and I will be like the Most High
[25:54] so now asking you why did God put us
[25:57] here as to tell Satan
[26:00] that the iniquity that was found in his
[26:02] heart and the and that intention in his
[26:05] heart to kill and destroy what God has
[26:07] made will come to an end so the fact
[26:10] that we are in time and time is no mores
[26:11] to tell Satan - your time is running out
[26:13] there is a lake of fire you gonna burn
[26:16] and everyone that wants to be with you
[26:18] and give all these things you they'll
[26:19] burn with you that is God's Word he
[26:21] doesn't go around but see we're not
[26:23] scared of this time this is not for us
[26:25] to get kid kids if you get scared you
[26:27] think you're gonna run our thumb don't
[26:28] worry all I want to ask you is can you
[26:31] close that valuable time and not let it
[26:35] go - to finish because I don't have a
[26:39] lot of time but I've got another one you
[26:41] know the devil is on borrowed time which
[26:44] is fantastic okay and it's gonna come to
[26:47] an end and we will rejoice and the
[26:49] rapture is gonna happen just to let you
[26:51] know if anybody ever told you these no
[26:53] such thing as a rapture they don't read
[26:55] the Bible I don't read the Bible there's
[26:58] gonna be a day when we start walking
[27:01] like like just think about it we're just
[27:04] gonna start walking and we're gonna fill
[27:05] a ship and we're gonna start walking
[27:06] higher and this this thing called
[27:09] gravity there's this law that has been
[27:11] put there it's gonna be broken I will
[27:12] just start walking
[27:13] I will walk up and we'll see you and
[27:15] then after that I don't think we'll be
[27:17] walking anymore we'll be running you
[27:19] know because it will be so happy and
[27:21] your kids might not understand what it
[27:22] means but if you take that little bit of
[27:24] time to pray now if I can encourage you
[27:29] prayer is the most important thing
[27:30] that's where the devil got everyone he
[27:32] will steal your pray time yeah because
[27:34] that's when you actually speak to your
[27:36] dad you know
[27:39] Ruben would you like it if daddy comes
[27:41] up and you want to really tell me a
[27:43] story and I just you start telling me I
[27:45] got tip it's fine and I walk away would
[27:47] you like that because we all want a
[27:50] relationship with your dad in your mom
[27:52] so if you pray and you just go sit every
[27:55] night and pray now occurrence you don't
[27:56] do this because they don't wait upon the
[27:59] Lord shall renew these three you go to
[28:01] your bed and you go pray and you say
[28:03] Lord I want to speak to you tonight you
[28:05] don't have to say fancy things you're a
[28:07] child I'm a child you know I speak to
[28:10] God I speak to him like I speak to
[28:11] anyone else just with reverence
[28:14] I don't try fancy words I don't I don't
[28:17] say the Steven Church ages are here and
[28:20] you're the one between the candlesticks
[28:22] years I don't go and try to impress him
[28:24] he knows me I am Who I am so if I come
[28:29] any other way I am not who I am anyone
[28:31] he will just go what are you doing but
[28:34] if you got really news and you go on
[28:35] your knees at night and maybe try it
[28:37] maybe try to I encourage you to try but
[28:41] these days a kicker to this so you go
[28:43] sit in you pray and you say Lord I want
[28:45] to hear your voice I really really
[28:49] really want to hear your voice and I
[28:52] want you to speak back to me but don't
[28:55] go and I want you to speak back to me I
[28:57] mean you're not giving him chance to
[29:02] speak back to you and if you pray again
[29:05] you feel oh these are Jacek and I use
[29:08] the example they okay there's an elbow
[29:11] coming my way hit me in the left eye and
[29:13] that one and I remember the soccer ball
[29:16] in the air and so when you're praying
[29:17] and those type of things start happening
[29:19] what should you do
[29:21] passed him down so how do we cost down
[29:25] sighted young kids how can you do it how
[29:27] how do you cost down Satan yes resist
[29:32] him you tell him you put him in his
[29:34] place you tell him spoken word you say
[29:36] Satan get thee behind me in the name of
[29:39] our Lord Jesus don't think it because I
[29:42] will tell you a secret you know that
[29:44] Satan cannot hear what's going on in
[29:46] your mind it can put thoughts in need
[29:49] but it can't hear what you're saying
[29:50] God can but Satan can't so now just hear
[29:53] me out so you're gonna tell Satan to go
[29:55] and he caught you the thoughts in your
[29:57] head are you gonna go do you think it's
[30:02] gonna leave you alone and be honest do
[30:05] you think it's gonna leave you he
[30:05] doesn't even know what you're doing you
[30:07] ghost man is that go out of breath you
[30:09] know you see trying to breathe this guy
[30:10] you know or does he have heartburn
[30:12] especially when we all then in Chile
[30:14] from brother Andy you know but because
[30:16] you're sitting there trying to think you
[30:18] maravene is going but when you speak
[30:24] when you speak the words and you address
[30:27] him and you say Satan in the name of our
[30:30] Lord Jesus Christ get behind me
[30:34] I want to pray I don't want to be robbed
[30:36] by you because the moment you start
[30:37] speaking now you start addressing the
[30:40] problem now you start speaking in faith
[30:42] and then God comes down because you just
[30:45] sent Satan out the door then God comes
[30:47] back and says but my child called me and
[30:49] Here I am so then you can pray and then
[30:54] wait don't stop your prayer and walk out
[30:58] the door wait this is the most important
[31:01] sin brother Branham sees you know why
[31:03] people don't speak to God anymore
[31:05] because they don't give him time to
[31:06] speak back they want to hear the voice
[31:08] of God they want to hear him speak they
[31:10] want to hear him see everything but they
[31:11] never give him a chance to speak they
[31:13] talk and then they turn around and they
[31:15] walk away and he's still waiting for
[31:17] them he says they don't wait upon the
[31:18] Lord so he hasn't chosen to come down
[31:20] yet and you already have to do and that
[31:23] and we do find it us as grown-ups as
[31:25] well we busy
[31:27] we've got freezing we got a lot of
[31:28] things going on you start praying and I
[31:30] don't know if some of you do it as well
[31:31] but this is just me and you praying and
[31:33] all of a sudden I go some other thought
[31:36] line and I find myself waking up to the
[31:39] Spree and I going we did I just go and
[31:41] you have to start again it's a fight you
[31:43] actually have to start again a selca
[31:45] Lord forgive me I don't want to go that
[31:47] way but first of all I know there's a
[31:49] problem because the moment I'm trying to
[31:50] get to my lord
[31:51] Satan's right next you're going and
[31:53] think about that and what about that
[31:55] sister seed and what about what that
[31:56] brother said and did you realize this
[31:58] and did you see that one's child and
[32:00] what happened at work today and and all
[32:01] of a sudden you flooded with all these
[32:03] ideas and all you want to do is just
[32:04] pray you really just want to pray so I
[32:07] encourage you when you pray that's when
[32:10] the battle starts that's when the battle
[32:13] starts because you want to speak to your
[32:14] dad and every other child in that place
[32:16] where now call them just a child as an
[32:19] example like you're three three boys so
[32:21] that walks in the door all three of you
[32:23] want to see your dad first and whoever
[32:25] fights the base is the one that grabs
[32:27] the dad and he's like fine dad so why
[32:29] don't you fight the same when you want
[32:31] to speak to God so when all these
[32:32] thoughts come and all these people want
[32:34] your attention all these thoughts these
[32:36] enticing spirits why don't you shove the
[32:38] out of the way and say Lord I'm coming
[32:39] for you you'll find yourself in the
[32:43] freeze ins of gas and something happens
[32:45] I don't know if you ever realize that
[32:46] you're praying and you're praying and
[32:48] you're fighting all these things signs
[32:49] and all of a sudden just goes and you're
[32:53] like what just happened and that is when
[32:56] God has caused everything away from you
[32:58] and now it's you and him and now you can
[33:01] ask anything you want because you'll
[33:03] answer you but then when you in that
[33:06] environment when you praying when you in
[33:08] that spot do not come out of it just
[33:11] stay and wait and say Lord I'm now here
[33:14] all my thoughts is gone I have nothing
[33:17] more to ask what do you want from me
[33:19] what I just want to hear your voice
[33:21] speak to me give me instruction give me
[33:23] give me wisdom give me anything that you
[33:25] can give me that could help me to break
[33:28] this time because when you come back I
[33:31] want to expect you so here's my story to
[33:34] finish there was a little lady cousin
[33:37] and she had three and brother branham
[33:39] tells the story she had three cousins
[33:41] and and he was there like the Cinderella
[33:44] story okay and this this farmers rich
[33:48] farmer's son came and he was looking for
[33:52] a wife and he saw something in her and
[33:55] then he had a time to speak to him yeah
[33:57] so they had a conversation and he said
[34:00] man I like you okay and I'm just
[34:01] paraphrasing because I know the story
[34:03] only by the world has taken the
[34:05] Cinderella story and just absolutely
[34:09] because the bride didn't run away
[34:11] she was waiting so and he saved through
[34:14] the bride and he says to her I want to
[34:15] marry you and I vowed to you that I will
[34:19] return I promise you I promise you in
[34:22] this Bible I promise you saving sure
[34:24] changes is gonna go fast you're gonna go
[34:26] into the bride age I'm walking between
[34:27] the candlesticks all these missions just
[34:29] that I have the light that they shine
[34:31] I'm in the midst of them this is me I'm
[34:33] revealing myself to you personally and I
[34:37] am gonna come back but I want you to be
[34:40] ready because when I come I'm marrying
[34:43] you I'm not I'm not just taking you away
[34:45] and then dressing you up I am taking you
[34:47] away for good we're going to get married
[34:49] we do the
[34:51] and if you really want to go deeper in
[34:52] we're already married I'm just coming
[34:54] going to prepare our house and I'm
[34:56] taking it to myself but see the bride
[34:58] had to do two things she had to jump
[35:00] into action she had to listen to the
[35:03] word that was preached and said okay I
[35:05] will make myself ready and she made
[35:08] herself a dress and she did everything
[35:10] she could to be ready but see then when
[35:14] she stood there and the cousins looked
[35:15] in and go he's not gonna come and it's
[35:18] five minutes to twelve or three minutes
[35:21] to ten past he's not gonna come but he
[35:26] promised me no but he doesn't love you
[35:29] it's just things he said he's rich he's
[35:31] got all going for him he can choose any
[35:33] woman on this earth but guess what he
[35:35] chose her and he said I will come and
[35:40] she was standing there and all of a
[35:41] sudden her cousins were starting to
[35:43] laugh with her are you even in a wedding
[35:44] dress
[35:45] this is even more fun you got all this
[35:48] fanaticism going rapture and all these
[35:51] wonderful gifts of healing and you'll
[35:53] speak food into existence when before
[35:55] the squeeze comes and all these
[35:56] wonderful gifts you have it's nonsense
[35:59] in the days of miracles are past it's
[36:01] the same thing but we stand here we say
[36:03] but God sees but he said so don't make
[36:07] myself ready and she just stood there
[36:09] and all of a sudden she heard something
[36:12] she heard those horses coming she goes
[36:15] that's him that's him the seventh church
[36:21] age we are at the end that is him when
[36:23] the Prophet started speaking and all
[36:25] these mysteries and your Bible became a
[36:27] new book that's him saying I'm on my way
[36:30] there's a type for you there's a place
[36:32] for you in my scriptures I am on my way
[36:34] are you reading so now what we need to
[36:37] do is grab that time and can get it back
[36:39] and say lord help me to manage my time
[36:41] such a way that our relationship is good
[36:43] that when you come that I'll recognize
[36:45] you and that you recognize me and then
[36:48] we Bokke
[36:48] and it's done so if I can encourage you
[36:52] he did show up and you know what
[36:55] happened to the three cousins they stood
[36:56] like this
[37:00] it is true and they just go what just
[37:04] happened but it was too late the five
[37:07] foolish virgins when they came back in
[37:09] the doors closing can I come in I don't
[37:12] know you you worker of iniquities
[37:14] you should have been doing what I asked
[37:16] you to do do you think they were looking
[37:18] they're going home so happy
[37:20] they stood there going so now he gave us
[37:24] a lovely to call the message of the hour
[37:27] that points us back into the Bible
[37:30] hey that seems to us that that Bible is
[37:32] not a bunch of stories it's not a
[37:34] religion it is life it's a lovely so all
[37:40] I can encourage you if you do find
[37:41] yourself trying to fight back time why
[37:44] don't you start with putting on a table
[37:47] 15 minutes if you're gonna fight back
[37:50] time you're gonna have to do a fight
[37:51] it's a fight ain't gonna come easy it's
[37:54] a fight every inch man some days I'm so
[37:58] tired I speak to my dad and I'm yawning
[37:59] it goes man you tired
[38:00] I'm like 'i'm tired but see if you agree
[38:03] with the devil guess what your body says
[38:04] you're tired and in your whole body goes
[38:07] arms oh I just need to sleep but the
[38:09] moment you go oh no sorry no I'm not
[38:11] tired you know what I still have to meet
[38:14] with my Savior I still have a
[38:15] conversation with you I've got a couple
[38:16] of questions I'm gonna ask him and
[38:18] tonight is tonight you will see how
[38:20] quickly your life changes around you'll
[38:23] quickly walk and there will be some
[38:25] leaves blowing and you'll go man I
[38:27] remember those leaves blowing and it's
[38:29] it's autumn time and all the seasons are
[38:32] changing and you'll find yourself in a
[38:33] spiritual realm seeing God everywhere so
[38:38] I encourage you you little one
[38:40] if you sing a song for the Lord fight
[38:42] back that time that your song for the
[38:43] Lord seen it I'll rather sing songs for
[38:46] the Lord in songs for the world I'll
[38:48] rather read a book about the Lord in
[38:50] Rick book about the world ok so what I
[38:53] don't want to stay in the world my
[38:55] purpose is not to be here not saying
[38:56] it's wrong I'm just saying what time are
[38:59] you giving to this and what time are you
[39:01] giving to him and I encourage you if you
[39:05] feel yourself struggling start singing
[39:09] put yourself in a different exercise its
[39:11] public it's bubbling in my soul and go
[39:16] and just start creating atmosphere and
[39:20] your brother might come back and say uh
[39:22] I don't think you understand how can he
[39:26] keep it quiet then cause he caught it's
[39:29] bubbling bubbling you just keep going on
[39:31] fight back your time and you'll find
[39:33] yourself it's easier then that night
[39:35] when you go and pray to get into his
[39:36] prison but if you had if you had video
[39:40] games and YouTube and and all these
[39:42] things and
[39:44] soccers and footballs and rec bees and
[39:47] all these other stuff that comes in I
[39:48] know I used to be a cricket consume my
[39:50] mind you know and in the end of the
[39:53] night you want to pray you cannot
[39:54] actually get your thoughts back keeps
[39:57] going that way but it has to start
[40:00] already the morning you wake up so
[40:03] tomorrow morning when we all wake up I
[40:05] encourage you say it's bubbling start
[40:08] singing that song and if a guy tells you
[40:10] to shut up at school guess what you tell
[40:12] him just don't sing in front of him just
[40:16] go sing somewhere else because it is
[40:18] it's your song God gave it to you you
[40:20] seen your song if your brother sees myrn
[40:22] you sell so bad you go I'll sound so bad
[40:25] talika
[40:26] doesn't matter I see if we don't put in
[40:30] time we won't be we will miss it Vice
[40:34] grace or we have to give him the time
[40:37] okay I hope afraid that it was a
[40:40] blessing to you and I I hope I didn't
[40:42] say it was you for face and and maybe
[40:46] when we going to prayer just maybe thing
[40:50] speak to the Lord and ask him to reveal
[40:53] to you yourself personally because no
[40:55] one can really reveal to you what's
[40:56] going on in your heart except in how to
[40:59] win back your time how can I get back my
[41:02] time with you and what should I do
[41:04] because there is something that's
[41:06] keeping a hinderance there is something
[41:08] I know I'm preaching to myself and once
[41:11] God shows you a listen get a bit away
[41:12] from the work get up a little bit away
[41:14] from from a YouTube video get away from
[41:16] a lot of things that I do wrong as well
[41:19] then you go Lord you know what if I cut
[41:21] those things
[41:22] would you help me and once you start
[41:24] cutting it out he helps you you have to
[41:26] do that yeah praise the Lord if you're
[41:45] winning you still want to score some
[41:46] more goals it's really deal to them man
[41:52] and it's the same thing you know with us
[41:54] he minutes to go
