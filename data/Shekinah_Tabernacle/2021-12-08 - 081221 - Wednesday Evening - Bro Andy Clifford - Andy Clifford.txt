lamb who's glad to be in the house of the lord tonight amen hallelujah laurie thank you musicians really appreciate that hey man who's thankful for the musicians amen great atmosphere thank you brother ed really appreciate that and i just love that song you know that's a very powerful song i believe that's the that's a bride song that one oh man that's that's real third paul to me hallelujah that's what it's all about amen glory to god amen as a personal he said i'll meet you in there and i trust that tonight you're fulfilling that that desire of god that he will meet you in there amen hallelujah i want to speak tonight amen on the desire of god actually so if we can turn in our bibles please to um um to you know the desire of god is a very broad subject so you can use any scriptures in the bible basically to back up what you're saying so and i just had so much inspiration you know of this subject and so amen like yeah just everything spoke to me about it so i've narrowed it down now under the lord's leading to a few scriptures and we've got one here in joel chapter 2 and we're going to read from 21 to 27 amen hallelujah then we're going to turn to jeremiah 29 and we're going to read verses 11 and 12. i want you to think about god's desire for you what does he want what does god want you know what is his desire you know sometimes we we think of god as he's just so mighty that it's all just this big sterile plan and it's all just going to happen as he foresaw it and foreign but woven through it all is god's heart and his feelings he's a person and he feels pain and he feels you and he and you and and he's looking for a heartfelt religion amen hallelujah amen he says here in verse 21 it says fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things be not afraid you beast of the field for the pastures of the wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down to you for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat hallelujah can everyone just say full of wheat amen and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil amen who wants to claim that for themselves tonight that's god's desire for you he wants you to have that and i believe that you do have that and he wants you to walk in that and realize that and just i don't know just bask in it hallelujah hey man just just go over the top hey man let's go over the top tonight amen let's not go under the power let's go over the top hallelujah amen you give them more praise than you can hallelujah and you drink more water than you need amen who believes that we should do that it's very good amen hallelujah i'm going to get carried away so i just keep reading hallelujah so and the and i love this so much and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the parma worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that has dealt wondrously with you and i love this and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed hallelujah you can have your seats god bless you you know he says my people shall never be ashamed he didn't say that once he said it twice and i believe he's talking about his bride and i believe he's talking about israel he's talking about you and he's talking about the jews because they're his people there's two groups of people that shall never be ashamed amen you know why because he bore your shame he took your burdens upon himself hallelujah i believe tonight if you want to leave the service changed you need a pool if you're just going to sit here and wonder what brother andy's going to say you're going to get nothing you're going to get nothing and your black dog's going to get fed so you just do that if you want to leave the service down but if you want to leave the service on fire if you want to leave the service with a spiritual strength pull right now i challenge you i challenge you to a jewel of pulling and if you keep pulling it'll just keep coming out if you want me to stop just stop pulling amen don't stop pulling but this is how it works okay this is how it works it's not a one-way thing here this is a two-way amen and if you want to have a good time let's have a two-way thing going on amen glory to god amen we've got that straight hallelujah god has a desire for you to leave the service changed god has a desire for you to be restored to have all your walls you know like a city a city's got walls and you know the city of the of jerusalem it was like a living organism built in a in an architectural structure you know that we're not going to get right into that because that's not the scope but it was it had all these different gates and walls and it was like a living being you know that a living organism and it had to function so it would work properly as a city and god's desire to you is that you would be a thriving bustling jerusalem hallelujah with all your gates working with everything working and with you as a son and daughter of god walking on the water because you're going into a storm i'm going into a storm we're actually not going we're in it hallelujah who believes we're in it amen and you know god's calling us as sons and daughters to crest every wave he didn't say there wouldn't be waves the prophet says in the stabilization we talked about stabilizing the ship we're going to crest every wave amen hallelujah and god's calling you not even you know we're going higher than just being in a boat now amen because the you see you've got to go further than just being in a boat you've god's calling you to walk on the water he's calling you out of the boat tonight oh lord you might be in the boat of your house you might be in the boat of your family you might be in the boat of your mummy and daddy hallelujah but tonight god's calling you out of that boat it's time to come out of the boat sons and daughters of god sons and daughters of melchizedek sons and daughters of he who walked on the water amen and he didn't rock he didn't go that way or that way he just stayed straight and he crested every wave who believes that jesus crested every wave every wave he didn't go left or ride or twist this way and that way and get scared he was completely he was completely immune to all the storm completely immune who wants to be immune invincible i said to my children last night i said you can be in such a place with god that you're invincible nothing can hurt you and this is a very this is this sounds very far-fetched right because we're now dealing in a natural thing the prophet said that you could you can have faith and no fear and no reaction and a hot fat that which would melt your skin will land on there and it wouldn't hurt you who's heard that before and you know you look at that and you go whoa it's pretty it's pretty like you know that's right there that's right there now that is an invincible person amen hallelujah that cannot be touched by any wiles or snares of the devil and god is calling you tonight his desire for you is to come out of the boat of your camp come out of the boat of your comfort come out of the boat of your will hallelujah come out of the boat amen now peter was called out of the boat and peter had faith but you see peter led a church age that could not go on a rapture it will go on the rapture but it could not be the dead in christ uh the the live and remaining they'll be raised up so it symbolized and peter yes that age began to walk on the water began to crest every wave they came into a place of perfect love they came into an economy that could that was in god was imperfection and it was unconditional love and it was it was so perfect and they crested every wave and peter was cresting every wave that first church age cresting cresting no effect amen hallelujah he could walk on the water amen and that first church began to walk on the water but then they looked around and they began to get sinked down amen they began to sink down because god was his desire was to see the pattern of nature in the church his desire was to see a seed go on the ground so that seed went into the ground underground and came back out but now hallelujah who knows where i'm going but now god's desire is not another seed in the ground amen that seed's been in the ground and it's come out and he's restored it and his desire is that you would be a thriving son and daughter of god that you would rise up and you would crystally wave and you ain't going to sink no sinking amen no sinking hallelujah amen jeremiah 29 11 12 it says for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end amen then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken to you hallelujah god was speaking this to these people because through jeremiah he prophesied of a of a time of judgment where israel had fallen so far away from god and and they had begun to worship all these idols in the peace and and taking on the religions of the land and so god said you know according to the law of moses that they would be banished from the land and so through but yet god always left them with a way out amen and so you see now after he said yes you're going to go but you're going to come back and i these are actually the thoughts i think towards you my people i'm not thinking towards you all this destruction that's not the end the end is i'm going to hearken to you i'm going to bring you back amen and you might have gone far from god we do sometimes go far in our actions and things but never too far for god to say this is what i really think of you this is my desire for you tonight i have my desire for you towards you is thoughts of peace amen not of evil to give you an expected end hallelujah then shall you call upon me and shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you amen and it says here in hebrews 12 2 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of god amen you see there was a desire in him amen do you know what desire means i looked up the definition of desire and it says a conscious impulse towards something that promises enjoyment oh my hallelujah you see there was a prospect within his heart of a people and that their life and their redemption and them coming into sonship and then coming off out of the world and coming to know him would promise him enjoyment you see you are a bringer of joy to the lord and his desire for you is to take you above sin above unbelief above lust above fear above all the works of the devil and all the things of the flesh above yourself above your limitations above the things that have troubled you all your life and the things that's come through your family and all these things god's desire is to take you higher than that to bring you above it who believes that tonight hallelujah hallelujah amen because you god is calling us now this is not just in some one-way thing amen this is not a one-way thing where you know we just follow this thing and we enjoy it but actually it's a two-part thing with us and god and just as you are rejoicing he's rejoicing and you know as you come into the holy of holies and your walk gets holier and i don't just mean by your behavior i'm talking about your heart your faith your your connection with god your worship amen when you sit in church are you getting anything are you getting something or is your mind not in it has something broken you from the household of god is something broken your connection with god tonight it can be fixed right now it can be fixed right here it doesn't have to be here at the altar just right in your seat right now right now you can have a connection with the one that you this is what you want you see we think we know what we want oh my we think we know i want this and i want to be that and i want to do this because this is going to make me happy but it ain't going to really make you that happy i tell you what's really going to make you happy is when god comes into your life when you receive the holy ghost amen and then it gets better and better you know because when you first receive the holy ghost man you're having a good time but then it becomes more and more of a love more and more since like a real depth hallelujah it's like a marriage you know it's like there's cloud nine and then it just gets deeper and deeper and deeper providing that marriage is centered on christ providing this healing in the camp providing that family altar has god in the center amen it just brings the people together amen hallelujah and it's the same when the holy ghost comes into your life and gives you that joy that you need you know he says that i i can't remember the first part of the verse but he said the the promise in this verse is that he will give you rivers of pleasure and you know just about everything that we do we do for pleasure you just do it you just want to be we just want to sit there and be pleased and not do anything right that's kind of the human nature oh my you see and and really we're in in christ and in the holy ghost that's that's actually the condition that we live in that will be in a constant joy that you can't even fathom you can't even imagine it the prophet could not even describe it in english language that's what we will exist in because there's no corruption there but yet there is an unconditional love within us to drive us to serve and to to participate in life because there's going to be a normal life over there we're going to live we're going to fellowship we're going to do things prophet says we're going to work you know that everyone's probably like oh my we're going to work this is going to be good work man we're going to have a good time amazing time and you won't have you won't get paid one cent and you'll love that because you'll realize that that whole payment system is satanic did you know that who knows that the monetary system is satanic it's the only way satan can get a bunch of falling no hopers to do something sorry not us but this world that's a very general statement that's the only way that the devil can get this world to work is by paying them something because no one wants to do anything for free now i'm not attacking anybody because you know we have to actually go and work we the the lord said we've got to be in this but not all this all right so who's who's we're in it but we're not of it all right amen hallelujah i deal with people and all sorts of things and there's different people and if there's so many different places where money has in people's lives and i just encourage you to put money where it belongs in your life it is a tool and a servant do not put it any higher than your feet that's where it belongs amen it's true don't treat it with anything higher than a servant and a tool and you know what god promised you seed of abraham amen i'll make you the head and not the tail and he's promised you that if you just follow his formula amen he will you won't ever have to worry about anything natural you won't have to worry about all of these things and trying to make your life something and trying to build this big empire or do anything like that you just have to worry about it all he says is you just put seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness seek ye first kingdom of god and his righteousness amen and and all these things who knows what these things are sorry i'm getting a phone call who's that mate that's just anyway my i'm not gonna answer it i promise oh man that's one way to get distracted isn't it man you see he set this up the whole thing's set up so that you can have a real good marian martha balance he's it's it's fully set up man it's this is rigged it's completely rigged you don't have to serve no monetary system you don't have to serve the devil's storm you know you know i don't know if i spoke to i think i spoke to john or someone about this and because it came so clearly to me about a week two three weeks ago the monetary system is a storm it's a storm you know that you know what a storm is a a storm is satan's kingdom the whole thing is one big storm and it's got lots of little storms inside of it and a storm if you look at it it you know it just it's just this terrible chaotic thing that just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and then disappears and it hit and it doesn't have any fun foundation it's at all it causes is destruction confusion wrecks things and that's the devil system and the monetary system is just the perfect example of that it's that you you take this this value and first of all it was real trade and then it became a gold piece and that gold had value in itself and then it became something that represented the gold and the gold was in the bank and then they took the gold out of the bank and all you had was this thing that represented what gold should be in the bank was not even there but then it got even more than it even it became value that was that the bank could lend way more than it even had and make money off it you know this is this is the and what happens is that value because of all that that value of that dollar has become less and less because it just goes bigger and bigger and bigger it's like a big storm and that is a life that's like without god if you walk away from the lord and you begin to trust in yourself and trust lean to your own understanding and you begin to go to the way of the world and you begin to go the way of a prodigal and you begin to go this different way that is not the way of the lord then you enter a storm you enter a place of perpetual destruction perpet unfounded unsatisfactory and and all you have to do is keep building it and building it building and getting better and better and better you come this big thing and then all of a sudden you crash crash down because you're in a storm it's not stable am i who loves stable who loves paradise you know this is this big storm and it just gets bigger and better and just you know you go out there and you just go real bad or you go real into something and your life even you cannot it doesn't even have to look that bad you might even still come to church but you're in a storm because something happened something tipped you over or you're going through a trial whatever it may be that's an individual walk and you're going through and it's getting worse and worse and bigger and bigger and the foundation's ripped from underneath you because you the storm there's no foundation oh my this is the devil's way this is his kingdom when you trust in money you begin to follow money you begin to go for the pursue the things of this world and you and you go out there and you look for the the whatever you want to call it you know of the world the pearl of the world which is gold all it does is pavement you're going to walk it's just pavement you know that's all it is you don't have to chase this our mind god has rigged this thing for you just says just seek me first put me first when you come to church children young people don't just wait for the service to finish oh my honestly and i know this i don't want to be a broken record but you know if you just say lord i just want you to speak to me lord i just want i'm going to be here for another 10 20 i don't know how many years i'm going to sit in this church and and you might be in a place where you just have to be here and you don't know why or you don't get much but there is a place that you can get something you can actually young people children there's no limit god's not looking at your age and thinking oh he's too young i'm not going to bother with that boy i'm not going to bother with that girl she's too young doesn't understand god understands and god can speak to you in your way in your level in your language he can tell you what you're thinking hallelujah because you see there's a purpose of the service and it's oh man and i know what brother ben i i just you you feel it it's like man let's not waste the time let's enter in with all of our heart hallelujah you want to get something real tonight hallelujah because you see you can sit in the service and the purpose is that you would give god all the glory and he would do something for you he would help you you would leave different you would have something changed in your life or god just the spirit of god can just man he could really do something for you of whatever scale it is momentous things in your life he can take you from influences of evil there's influences that are all around us and they're infiltrating at every point and when you begin to open your heart to those things and they get your joy and you begin to draw from them joy and you begin to get comfort from these things and it doesn't matter what it is whether it's your business whether it's your education whether it's your sport whether it's you know your religion your your performance in the church all those things don't feed your spirit man your inner man all those things do is feed the flesh and they make it harder for you to worship god they make it harder for you to pray they make it harder for you to enter in and have fellowship that's the that's the carnal mind the carnal mind is enmity against god the carnal mind has divided it's repulsive to god god sees it as repulsive and your carnal mind sees god as repulsive i know that sounds strong but that's what the bible says and you know i was thinking about that one night and it just dropped down it's the same as the serpent your carnal mind is serpent do you know that it's a serpentine ideology it's the carnality and when you if you don't feed the spiritual man and you begin to feed that carnal mind by doing good things and i'm going to say good things okay because that's going to be a little bit more striking than going out and committing sins and all sorts of stuff i'm talking about life i'm talking about business and i'm preaching to myself because i've got all those things happening to me so i'm preaching from experience i'm not just preaching uh someone else's experience i'm preaching exactly what i'm going through and go through and have gone through and have come out of and gone into and come out of and you know it's like man you've got to manage these things and we're in a world now and you're called to certain things and you're called to certain places and to be a witness now be careful martha how much you give be careful martha how much of your heart and your desire and your worship you begin to try and worship god through your works you try and worship god like martha oh i'm gonna serve i'm gonna make him so please i'm gonna do all these things and miss the very thing that mary had and so there we have to manage our output we've got to manage our time the bible says redeem the time for the days are evil everything is trying to take your attention it's trying to rob you it's trying to delay the inevitable do you know what the inevitable is oh my [Applause] oh my you can just start shouting and rejoicing right now the inevitable is your body change hallelujah the inevitable is the devil's under your feet it's inevitable who knows what inevitable means it has to happen doesn't matter whether he's kicking screaming whatever and and remember this the devil was wounded a mortal blow at calvary and he became very vicious see how vicious he was when the when that life that was in christ came unto the disciples and they and they took a man who was limping and made him leap when they did that through the power of god through them then the viciousness of the devil came upon them and they were beaten and they were scourged and they were removed from their position in society because of the life and then the devil began to push the church down and it became religious and the true seed was getting less and less and less and pressured and down underground but then one day hallelujah you know and then it started raising up and it was still denominational denominational but then one day hallelujah a mighty angel came down with an open book to give back the fullness however to give back the inheritance that inheritance tonight my brothers and sisters that inheritance tonight is in the hand of the mighty angel ready for you to take it amen hallelujah now man we've taken it right who's taken the book who's eating the book who's feasting amen now i want you to feast go beyond the camp of your own oh my let me not say it i'm not gonna go too far into that hallelujah go beyond the camp hallelujah of the influences that are influencing you to not feed on the book that are influencing you away you have to say no i'm gonna just say no because you see they are trying to delay the inevitable it's the spirit in them it's not your friend friends are lovely i've got friends out there but i'm not gonna let them pull me away from my god i'm not going to let them pull me away from my inheritance i'm not going to let them pull me out of my joy i'm not going to let them pull me out of my rejoicing not going to let them pull me out of my freedom who wants who no one in here should would whatever want to be pulled out of your freedom pulled out of your joy pulled out of your privilege hallelujah oh my hallelujah you see god has a desire and his desire is a complete restoration of your life his desire is so strong that he's not looking at all your mistakes he's not looking at all of your shortcomings he's not worried about any of those things he's not worried about the performance of your flesh oh my he's not looking at all that he has a desire and he has spoken it and it does thus say of the lord that you have been restored and there is a full provision over you and in you and through you to see it all manifest that's god's desire for you regardless of your performance regardless of your personality regardless of your complexes regardless of all those things god is calling you to crest every wave to walk on the water to ride above the storm to live in victory who wants to live in full victory amen let me tell you the stabilizers are in the ship the stabilizers are in you amen hallelujah you know when you find your life rocking left and right unstable tossed about you're emotional and you can't it's just uncontrollable and all these things begin to grip you and change you and take you in this direction in that direction but there is a stabilization there is a real man that can turn on the light in your engine room you know we've got an engine room you know that engine room is your subconscious and it's full of all sorts of memories and things that you've been through and stuff that gets activated when you don't want it and all of a sudden you do something you didn't mean to do or you you didn't do something that you were meant to do and it stops you and i'm talking real things too like believing to receive healing or believing to receive the holy ghost that you can be hindered from receiving the baptism of the holy spirit by your subconscious just not believing or not being able to believe maybe a dead figure in your life hurt you and broke that channel of you trusting your father and that goes subconsciously to your heavenly father but tonight there's healing in the cup tonight there's healing god has just got a desire for you to be healed from that god's got a desire for you to be healed so that you can receive the holy ghost god's got a desire for you to be healed from anything that your parents ever did to you amen because remember parents aren't always perfect and parents made mistakes i make mistakes we all make mistakes and we all create complexes in our children that they may not even see until they're old that's the subconscious that's the engine room but there's a man in this place that can turn on the light in your engine room there's a man in this place his name is jesus and he can come into your engine room tonight and heal those little things that can take away your privileges and you know they're your privileges and they're given to you and you've got that you know you you serve the lord and you you you just worship him as best as you know how as the prophet would say and and and he would take you further and deeper and then you come across things that you feel like what's going on and it's that there's things and it's time then and you begin to fail and you begin to go through something and a storm begins to start raging just remember who's in the boat remember there's a stabilization hallelujah and while you're cresting the waves going through the trials that god has ordained for you to go through you're cresting the waves stable who wants to be stable amen this storm we're in a storm but this ain't nothing this is nothing this whole covert thing is nothing i'm gonna read something my and it's very striking and if you've just been playing church tonight is the end of your church playing the end because you can now you will not survive this without a real experience from god oh my there's no way to go through the storm without the stabilizer in your ship you know the greatest technology hallelujah the greatest technology of stabilization is in the big ships and you know they create they go over some rough seas they go over like man it's so big and you look at who's ever watched a video of a boat going through a storm it's insane and i would not want to be in there man oh mate it's going up and it goes crash and water just goes everywhere it's massive i'm talking huge but within the engine room hallelujah of that ship it's going through the storm but it's just going straight and water and stuff is going everywhere millions of liters well maybe i don't know how many liters but lots it's going and it's just majestically crested you know and there's the captains on the ship he knows how to tackle that wave he's going up and down but down in the engine room as this technology is called gyroscopic technology no it's not no weight going that way or this or whatever no no no this is this is technology now and it goes and and it's called it's got these things that it's a wheel and a wheel and it spins like this who's ever no heard of inertia so if you get a big powerful drill or an engine and you turn it on it goes and you move it and it actually causes gravity it's got a different center of gravity it pulls because of the weight of the spinning parts that is the technology of stabilization very smart you see that's where the in the countdown the prophet joined technology and the revelation of god because you see as god reveals and begins to give to his church the tree of knowledge or also growing right up alongside it and technology starts to get released so you see now in the end time when god begin to release a stabilization into his church into his bride that would cause her to walk on the water here comes this technology in the marine industry that would cause a boat to come into a real stable and be able to crest the waves because of the stabilization so it will go up and down and up and down and crest the waves and get to its destination where before that just like a person and you can be a true believer but without the stabilizer in your ship without the stabilization of the holy ghost preeminent in your life oh my the ship goes like this and starts listing like that and listing and listing if it gets too much it just tips over and it's gone and that's like a ship like a person who has not got the stabilization of the holy ghost in their life who is just walking around and miserable got enough religion to be miserable and really just you just don't have any joy or you're a person who did have religion and it was heartfelt and something's happened in your life and you've lost it and you've lost your connection but tonight hallelujah in your ship in your engine room there's a man in this place that can turn on the light his name is jesus hallelujah he made provision for you hallelujah he made provision for you to be healed he made provision for you to be stable he made provision for you because the oncoming storm is going to be so raging it's going to be tsunamis of waves and all sorts of crashing in that way and if your ship is going like this and like this and crashing around what how will it survive but if your ship receives the wheel in the wheel if you're a ship receives the stabilization of the holy ghost and you give him preeminence and he begins to take over your life and you begin to feed the white dog and when you come to church you rejoice and you begin to worship god and out of your lips praise god is there anyone in this room that's never said praise god sincerely because if that is the case it's time for your lips to give our god praise hallelujah you'll be surprised the difference it makes when you really say it you really say praise the lord you see when i enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise who am i entering i'm entering the court of the holy of holies i'm coming into fellowship with my king he's prescribed to me a way that i can enter in and have fellowship and i can come to church and have fellowship i can come and i'm not just going to leave the same i'm going to leave different i'm going to leave change i'm going to leave healed i'm gonna leave stabilized i'm gonna be different who wants to be different tonight who wants to be ready for the oncoming storm hallelujah amen you know it says that the wise virgin trimmed and cleaned the lamp because you see it gets filled up with carbon there's things in this world and the the cares of life and none of us are exempt from carbonization oh my god's desire for you is a clean shining lamp or full of oil and oil in your vessel so the light never runs out that's his desire tonight amen who receives that you desire then who desires that he desires it more more you love him he loves you more and he's actually his desire is that you would come up to where he loves that's his economy it's perfect love it's a it's a whole system of life that works because everybody loves each other and serves each other unconditionally they don't come and do something and then put their hand out you know and go i want um i want you to go come and do me something you know you know i want you to come and give me something and take a list you know he doesn't have like a list okay i've done all these things for brother andy or andy and now he owes me and like in his economy this is why it works because people will serve without anything in return amen this is the god's economy but in satan's economy it cannot work he tried it with communism communism doesn't work because it's got corrupt human beings that aren't converted that are unstable when the storms come and the temptations come for greed they just take advantage can't take advantage amen now you see that god has a desire he's got this desire for the earth he's got a desire for jerusalem he's got a desire for his sacrificial system he's got a desire for israel he's got a desire for his enemy he's got a desire for you he's got desires that he wants to express and i just happen to be so thankful that i'm of the desire of the bride and i'm his darling hey man who's glad to be his darling who's glad to be the apple of his eye who's glad to be the one who's got his sights on to restore and to heal and to bring you life not to leave you in your condition he doesn't want to just leave you miserable children he doesn't want to just leave you in a state of limbo he wants you to be so filled with his joy so full of his spirit amen tonight things can change just by a simple prayer amen don't think about your friends don't think about anyone else what anyone thinks just think about what he thinks because his thoughts are eternal everyone else's thoughts are just carnal and they are going to corrupt they're going to be forgotten so what your friends think of you now in 20 30 40 100 years time will mean zulch who's heard that word zilch before hey man i don't mean sugar free food oh my they mean nothing the thoughts of your friends your school buddies whatever how they probably laugh at you for being a christian or you know like that you are going to a church you might not even identify as a christian because you feel ashamed all those thoughts are going to just absolutely be gone and never be remembered never to be remembered but god's thoughts are of peace and of an expected end and of eternal life and now right now not just in heaven but he wants to give you satisfaction and joy and a stable environment you know i talked about the storm and this tumultuous thing was unstable and it's just going in every direction and that's the devil's world and that's what he's got to offer and it might come in the form of you having a good time it might be something that your flesh enjoys but it never can last it always peters off it always changes it always turns into something corrupt it always takes you away from god it always takes you into a condition where you cannot sustain it it's unsustainable it's un you know it's not sustainable let's just leave it there but and you've got this big raging storm and rain and lightning and thunders and winds and all the stuff going and mudslides and everything that's what satan has to offer and it might you might enjoy it but it can't last and it will cause you to end up in hell but i know that doesn't sound very good it sounds very positive but this is the truth and i don't want to sugarcoat it but god and you take that big dark thing now if you want to take a picture of what god's life that he has to offer think of a beautiful green environment of just nice grass and a beautiful still lake that's just still and there's some just a nice real high little white cloud or and just a blue sky nice palm trees just a gentle cool breeze about 25 degrees celsius just still peaceful the birds chirping it's just still it's just calm and you can just sit there for eternity and fellowship it's eidetic that is what god if you could picture his life what he has to offer what the holy ghost is if you could just you know i know it's i'm not belittling the magnificence of god but i'm just trying to so that even the children can understand that that it's like paradise you know brother branham who knows that brother branham was taken beyond the curtain of time has everyone heard that story before and he says it was it was beyond sublime and it was just this beautiful place and everyone loved each other and there was no sexual connotations or there was no nothing like that there was nothing it was just perfect beautiful love and there was no yesterday no tomorrow it was all just now it was the most amazing and it was so stable and it's so sustainable that's what it's like that's what the and the voice said to him this is what you've preached this is the holy ghost it's perfect love perfect peace perfect satisfaction a and and sustainable now we're going to that place but let me tell you something when you receive the holy ghost when you get the baptism of the holy ghost and he gets preeminence in your life that that hap begins to form within you and and and you go from this storm of emotions and roller coasters and up and down and tossed about you have to go through it every son that cometh to god must go through these things because they're part of the deliverance they're part of you've got to take the enemies camp you've got to go and take your inheritance back but you've got to go through those things but you see you start off with this mess of a heart you start off with this destruction zone and it's full of all these idols and false religions and buddhism and hinduism and darkness and and and satanism and lust and selfishness and he comes into that do you know that that's what he comes into he comes in to begin to work in a life like that you know after the world is finished and and this and i'm remember i'm talking about god's desire because he has a desire to take your heart he's got his blood has got the power to change the vilest sinner's heart you may feel condemned because you may have bile things going on in your heart and you think that god doesn't want you he still wants you his desire doesn't change based on you having a bad season in your life and you go do the violence things or you think oh because i'm like this i can't even have a you can actually that can all be dealt with right now and you can pass the point of no return and come into christ so deep that the devil can't touch you again hallelujah oh man i just love these things so you see god is promising us us these things he's promising us this edenic condition so the earth you see and now when i saw talk about these desires of god he desires this for you but let me show you what he desires for the earth so that you can understand what he's come what he comes down to into your heart and to my heart what do you think he found in my heart i ain't going to go through it oh man do you think that if it was based on performance the lord would never come near me i'm such a bad man and so vile and so evil and and didn't even believe but he came hallelujah amen hallelujah i'm gonna i have to read something i hope it's not too late oh man i promise hallelujah after it's all been said and done after we've gone in the rapture you know we've gone up and we've had a rejoicing time at the wedding supper and we've been there three and a half years and tribulations poured out on the earth and remember that the the jerusalem has been trampled down by the gentiles and you remember god's desire is that we would live in jerusalem god's desire is that jerusalem would be paradise it'd be identic who knows that he doesn't want do you think god wants jerusalem to look like it does right now with a big pimple on top of where the temple was looks like you just need to really pop that thing you know and i'd oh man but i just think okay well the lord's going to have his day amen who believes the law is going to have his day and that's going to see you now you can picture jerusalem and i was walking through that old city and i was walking through and i looked at civilization after civilization and building because of war and because of darkness and because of byzantine roman catholic and then muslims and allah and moon gods and and then all this other rubbish old false religions all just building themselves these big spires in jerusalem and it's all just this big idolatrous mess and that is the heart of the earth that's the where the throne of god that's the apple of his eye that's god's desire for that is not that and you know what god if god's desire for that is not that and god's desire for that is he didn't guess what's going to happen eden so we have an inevitable reality that that torn up place and it gets worse in the tribulation it gets torn up it gets trodden down by the gentiles so they're all just going to come upon us or there's going to be a big armageddon battle it's going to be destruction and that's what it's like in your heart before he comes but yet and you know you think oh my i look like this just an average person right i look like this average why me who's ever thought that why me lord how did it be me the odds are pretty slim right that you would be in a left seed and you think why me i'm going to leave it there i'm just going to read you this and then we'll revisit that because and i want you to think why me lord and remember the scripture it says despise not the day of small thing for the you know the lord wants to do an amazing restoration to israel and change everything and you know he came down to jerusalem and what did he do you know after the supper if he reads through zechariah 14 it shows the the lord coming to jerusalem to restore it and actually it's after the marriage supper after the armageddon after the false prophet and the beast of cast into the lake of fire i hope you follow me um who's with me okay so after all those things after we've been raptured everything then we go back to the earth but you see if you read the war zone that we come to and he comes to that's terrible but he starts a work he begins to bring stabilization he takes what the see that's the fruit of the devil if you buy into the devil's lies if you start listening to his narrative and i'm talking about your narrative your flesh narrative that he begins because he uses your flesh against you he uses your old nature uses your old inheritance he uses all those memories and he uses leverage if you buy into that and then he uses all these friends and people out in the world that would pull you from god which are not really your friends because a friend will bring you closer to god a real friend because they're a friend of your soul they want the best for you eternally but you know you see all these things but god he begins to pull you and he begins to take this war zone and and it's all just terrible and torn up and everything and he and and and and he comes down to it and he begins to turn it into a beautiful paradise because if you and not instead of a tumultuous storm because if you buy into the devil's lies and you buy into his thing and you begin to listen to all that you will end up in a storm and you'll end up with your heart like jerusalem which is what it's like now but god's desire is greater than that god's desire is greater than the storm if anybody's listening on that camera god's desire is greater than the trouble you're going through god's desire is causing an inevitable destruction on your enemy glory because you see god's desire is not our simple sinful condition god's desire is not for us to be destroyed and to be trodden down to the gentiles to be trodden down by hollywood to be trodden down by some youtube star or whatever you call them now i don't even know where it is now my goodness not to be trodden down by some ideology some communists that thought some disaster some storm that's just been all like that but here comes god he has a desire for eden he's got a desire for paradise he's got a desire that you'd have a life sustainable he's got a desire that you would be free and that you wouldn't have to live under some sickness or some plague or be fearful of some vaccine or anything no fear his desire is fear not so if you if you have any fear in your life god's desire for you is freedom god's desire for you is faith and guess what he did he gave you faith if you doubt that you've got faith then you're doubting the word and it's not true just just doubt those doubts just can't that if you think oh man i'm just not i don't have much faith and when you go to pray you think and the thought comes because i know the thought comes that you don't you might know you can't believe that it's a lie do you think the syrophoenician woman who was crying after jesus you know all of those things even all mate she had to go through a gauntlet man we got it easy so you just need to you know this is the littlest desire is that that you would have faith so he gave you faith the lord's desire is that you would go in the rapture so he gives you the holy ghost the lord's desire is that you would walk in your privilege so he gave you an open book the lord's desire is that you would live in eternally so he gave you eternal life the lord's desires that you would be redeemed so he paid for you with his own blood he he searched for you he searched you out and he knew how to woo you without interfering with your free moral agency and you would make a decision to serve him hallelujah somebody's pulling man i'm trying to get to my notes here hallelujah i'm going to read this and then we're going to close brother branham says faith is not that loose it's got to be based upon some noted fact you've got to know something about what you're having faith in before you can have faith in it so we first must know how and what god's desire is what god's plan is and how to approach god by that plan and now i've just told you what god's desire is and god's plan is it's for freedom it's for righteousness it's for holiness it's for all these things and he's made all these provisions that you would fulfill that and you're on an inevitable path to victory so just let god be god in your life amen and accept that god's desire over you as of for good things amen hallelujah so let me read this this is a tongues and interpretation from the message of grace and it's been a very striking thing for me and i really believe that this is from the lord and also just as an annex to that i believe that this is not just for them in that day actually it probably wasn't even for them it's for you right now and i know i'm putting myself out there but you wait till we get to the end of this and you're going to see it definitely wasn't for them there was portions of it of course for them and proportions for brother branham because a lot of a lot of the times those tongues and interpretations were to encourage brother branham because he was going through you know like imagine the pressure he at this this individual man that was pressing up against all like global darkness was was pressing him backwards trying to couldn't because the unstoppable power of the resurrection was controlling and leading him and that angel of the lord was with him with us so ever he went the never failing presence of jesus christ fear not you know that he said and that's over you as well when you carry this message and when you begin to testify when you raise up your hands and you begin to witness god will come down and witness through you he will do the talking amen hallelujah and we're going to go into the greatest storm and it's going to be pretty hard and it's time for you to get the stabilizer in your ship and if you've got the holy ghost it's time to let that stabilizer take its place within your engine room and get activated you know like just it needs to come into preeminence you need to give him all the glory and surrender yourself so that he can live fully amen he says again i have spoken to you this morning by my spirit again calling to your remembrance that i will talk to you this morning by the voice of my prophet i have given him a message this morning that might seem to be strange to him yet it has been ordained of me that your understanding might be made fruitful that you might look upon my work of righteousness that i'm working in my church this day that your hearts might be lifted up that your understanding might be made fruitful this is god's desire now you see that you might be receptive to these things that i'm going to speak to you this morning that you might become encouraged in the way that i desire you to walk in so you see now it's very important that you know what god desires you to do individually but also on a dispensation on an age level on a church level what is god's desire for chicana tabernacle amen hallelujah and we should pray god reveal your desire for this tabernacle and then when i say that i'm not talking about the building i'm talking about this family that we have of that we love each other and that we walk in unity and that there is no chisholm and that we're just of one mind and one accord and living in revival amen untouchable you know by the devil's antics and his and his and his and all of his devices that just they just go off like a water on a duck's back hallelujah the oil of the dove amen it says that that i desire you to walk in that you might lift up your voices in praise and thanksgiving to me if it causes to be of service to know that i have been here and that my spirit is in the midst of you even now look unto me the true and the living god because i'm standing in the midst this morning i'm wri and i love this this is this is where i talk about this is this is just this whole it's not just me worshiping it's god rejoicing with me and it's not just you singing and having a wonderful time who's with you hallelujah it's not just david dancing around the ark but god do you think god wasn't happy that his ark was going back to where he really wanted it to be for so many years it was stuck down the back in some place that was not even jerusalem silo tranquil silent the seventh seal sitting in silence for so many years but one day hallelujah under david's restoration when all the promises of the prophet joshua would come to pass and it pulled it all and everything began to come into its place don't you think god was rejoicing don't you think god was dancing with david around that ark what about when you begin to dance when you see the return of the seventh seal in your life do you dance is there a dance in your life are you in the victory of dance yet have you come to the victory where you've danced with god who starts with god hallelujah i'm challenging you tonight that there is a dance that is for you hallelujah who there is a shout that is for you you've got to shout that's part of your dna you've got to you've got to praise i said it before someone in here has never said praise god there's a praise for you there's a praise god that's for you amen someone that hasn't danced in the spirit and got so high on god that you can't even control yourself and you go beyond the camp of your own style like david and he was rejoicing because his god in the representation of this blessing of the seventh seal he didn't call it that but the ark was coming to jerusalem it was coming to his house what about you what about me amen and i have no doubt in my heart that god was rejoicing oh my you know you see david he was so s part of god's word we just knew how to enter in that he began to just get further and deeper into god until he became acquainted uh became connected to the very rejoicing of the spirit let me read this because i'll tell you now god says this now look unto me the true and the living god shall kind of tabernacle because i'm in thy midst this evening i'm rejoicing with you in my spirit he says that i'm rejoicing with you in my spirit and i will lift you this morning by my strong right hand in the place where you can lift this head and walk beside

you see and this is why we sing before we listen to the word you know just oh my you sing first to get into his courts and then you hear the word it's real simple but a lot of the times we're singing we're not even thinking about what we're singing and we're just going through the motions and and then we hear the word and we learn something and then we go but that's not what it's all about it's more so much more you know you're coming here and you begin to sing and god gives you your praise because you said tonight you said you said lord i'm not leaving here without my praise i'm not leaving here without my dance and my victory dance it doesn't mean you're going to go dancing around this place tonight you can but what i'm talking talking about is that you lay a steak down and you say lord
