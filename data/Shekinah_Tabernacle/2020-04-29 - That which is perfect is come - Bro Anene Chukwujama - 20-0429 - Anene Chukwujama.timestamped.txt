[34:41] tapes you have the baby with the the
[34:44] Bible you have the books is for you to

[34:54] your mouth yeah but in the belly they do
[34:57] bitter and make a prophesy you know the
[35:00] bitterness is the tryouts Chris alone
[35:02] and so when you are going to the trial
[35:05] instead of good having a clean self pity
[35:10] party oh no I mean no wine is then you
[35:14] just speak the world like Moses cement
[35:20] Moses on that day amen here was there we
[35:24] ever see Moses was only on the duty line
[35:27] or doing in obedience but trouble came
[35:32] between the ocean between the Red Sea
[35:37] and behind them was he angry am your
[35:39] Pharaoh yeah let me to kill them as one
[35:42] man in one day and see if you chose the
[35:45] choices army together didn't know that's
[35:49] the great a general then the general
[35:51] email my team was switching one of the
[36:04] message that we should recognize who is
[36:10] in amen and then you will not be devil's
[36:14] football to teach you here into here to
[36:17] here no you say no Satan
[36:19] it may this is my place the word Amen
[36:21] Alleluia and then the world is in
[36:25] lockdown there's a Lord when I walk into
[36:29] the hospital and actually cannot smile
[36:31] laughs and they closed all the doors are
[36:34] sealed their cruises do against some
[36:36] that angels anything but anyway so but
[36:40] God is our protection remain that's what
[36:43] I say now the world is in lockdown but
[36:47] but we are we are locked in with Jesus
[36:52] and joy the power strength to make it
[36:56] through the new year
[36:57] no with the dull and sober burns said
[37:00] that we should be so on fire for God
[37:04] yes you should you should be going day
[37:08] and night nothing should be able to stop
[37:11] us amen
[37:13] and we should be so sweet and so present
[37:16] and so kind and so crestlake no lives
[37:20] and he takes every day life
[37:26] been like the world remembers Christ's
[37:30] resurrection was in a year but for the
[37:33] believer
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:42] Hospital blessings amen
[37:45] and so if that be the case he should be
[37:50] I was talking about thinking I was
[37:54] singing and one works
[37:56] amen he should be the prism of our life
[37:59] if he is the principle of the Bible and
[38:02] the bubbles in you then he should be the
[38:05] principal theme of everything that you
[38:07] do mine so when we were so predicted
[38:12] yeah the channel opens the pipeline gets
[38:16] on plot is we move freely
[38:25] he made a promise and he will come and
[38:29] fulfill the promise we have to make us
[38:32] available to him to him and we have to
[38:37] will increase God will look beyond our
[38:40] ability or inability our strength
[38:45] our witness is view to him and so what
[38:50] we are so yielded to him at all times
[38:55] what is ready or this the sun is shining
[38:59] I saw a bloom and that look at what I've
[39:02] said here impact on vision isn't it
[39:04] beautiful we can really encode your soul
[39:08] in price a man in such a place till you
[39:12] can get quiet before him and hear his
[39:15] voice speaking to you i am the lord the
[39:20] hillary hallelujah
[39:23] young good lord that give it its inner
[39:26] life I love thee I am no day before the
[39:32] freshman world man
[39:34] I put the name upon the book thou art
[39:38] mine yet not it's me don't be afraid I
[39:44] am with you
[39:46] so say Amen hallelujah so when we get to
[39:52] his presence we we will need to get in
[39:56] the spirit led tonight
[39:58] amen in the spirit of the worship and
[40:03] praise and fellowship amen and it's
[40:07] always saying and now we can be able to
[40:11] get on that great expectation for the
[40:14] supernatural
[40:14] yes I believe tonight and if it can
[40:18] happen that if you are sick you can be
[40:22] healed I believe that if we need the
[40:25] Holy Ghost you can be filled because in
[40:28] life my mind lies my face twice right
[40:33] but God does not like if I take the
[40:37] sword I cut off everything else and let
[40:39] him come then tonight can anyone hear
[40:44] somebody say Amen so we meet above
[40:49] everything else with a revelation from
[40:51] God yeah I mean we said now so he said
[40:54] to Peter I will tell in the hood would
[40:57] you say
[40:59] two men sit at the hem is it all this
[41:01] awesomeness true say you are this your
[41:04] ledger you are this or that and it won't
[41:06] again be disciples like tonight yeah who
[41:09] do you yeah hey this message is yeah
[41:17] Peter say that what Christ instead of
[41:21] living God you mind your intellectual
[41:27] your power of thinking did it help you
[41:31] that I would need that a man would talk
[41:36] with you turn into receive nothing he
[41:38] made so I believe is here tonight to
[41:41] give you a question
[41:43] right shall we shall we turn to these
[41:45] pictures tonight and I want to pray upon
[41:49] the scripture and they will sit down
[41:51] because I'm good at carpentry as I read
[41:54] the scriptures Heavenly Father we just
[41:55] about to open your word Lord but an
[41:58] 18-man that it reads alright can open
[42:03] the Bible and read yeah but to let me

[42:35] the 3 and in first John 4:17 and lastly
[42:41] fourth graders to 9 to 10

[42:47] maybe sit there let let's start from
[42:50] first Corinthians chapter 13 8 to 12 may
[42:55] be seated
[42:59] you got you got it ok alright so I read
[43:04] charity never fail it but whether there
[43:08] be prophecies they shall fail whether
[43:12] tongues they shall cease whether there
[43:15] be knowledge it shall vanish away for we
[43:18] know in part and we prophesy in part but
[43:21] when that which is perfect is come then
[43:23] that which is in part shall be done away
[43:27] when I was a child as big as a child I
[43:31] understood as a child I thought as a
[43:35] child but when I became a man I put away
[43:38] childish things verse 12 for now we seek
[43:42] true at that glass darkly so it was true
[43:46] true true a glass darkly but then face
[43:49] to face now I know in part but then
[43:53] shall I know even as also I am known
[43:56] please alone that was 12 says if we go
[44:02] back in time where pork preaches he said
[44:06] now we see through a glass right so Paul
[44:11] at that point was saying this is where
[44:14] we are Marama said that that this this
[44:20] messengers did not live long a love to
[44:22] this day of course you know and that's
[44:25] that's what it should be not enough to
[44:28] this day so we we a nanny said but then
[44:34] face to face so we we are now we are
[44:40] moved on from that now then to now here
[44:45] so things have changed so we are no
[44:47] longer seen in true that glass right
[44:50] okay and everybody said but then we will
[44:55] see for surface right so the dead is now
[44:58] hallelujah face and see what I'm trying
[45:05] to say is it now I know impart what they
[45:08] should I know even as I am known so so

[47:19] manner had this hope in him purifies
[47:21] himself even as he is pure first John
[47:26] chapter 4 verse 17
[47:29] herein is faulted for just the next
[47:33] chapter
[47:34] you got it first okay I read he release
[47:38] all of meat
[47:39] that we may be that you may have
[47:42] boldness in the day of judgment because
[47:44] as he is so are we in this world tonight
[47:52] as he gives praise God can you imagine
[47:57] that as he is so are we
[48:00] I think less Sunday's been back
[48:04] inspiration make some demonstration got
[48:08] a big job water and they pour a little
[48:11] bit in a glass that water in that glass
[48:14] had the same chemical composition as the
[48:17] one in the main in the main difficulty
[48:19] of this portion and get a drop of water
[48:22] I mean what's the difference this was a
[48:34] liar that comes to mollify you are not
[48:38] it would be you are you did this you did
[48:42] that now let me tell you he is permitted
[48:44] to do that is his job because doctors
[48:50] Butterfield is the mind
[48:55] amen that is why you showing you who you
[48:59] are able to draw your sword and chop me
[49:05] left and right and you seem wrong when
[49:08] you take your stem with the word what
[49:10] God says you are to be church members to
[49:17] be to be to to have with your spirit or
[49:21] Billy Joe's know he's beautiful songs
[49:24] and those of God Psalm tonight amen
[49:29] tonight so as he is so are we Chris
[49:38] alone in this world in this world we're
[49:41] not going to heaven yet right
[50:03] so I by his spirit what does this one
[50:53] mean and nothing hallelujah guru to blow
[50:56] when you see somebody boasting on his
[50:59] riches or treatment you only only
[51:03] operate on this level whether him go has
[51:07] by spirituals
[51:09] the main thing he meant for his research
[51:12] at all things here the ditches of God
[51:15] his alone so tonight my tattoo tonight
[51:20] is that which is perfect is come for
[51:27] subject now we know as we are known
[51:33] guessing we have Matthew funny
[51:36] hallelujah so when the food is prepared
[51:40] is a quid pro comes and reduce himself
[51:43] to you as an individual
[51:46] you'll see him clearly face to face it
[51:50] is then only then that you will know as
[51:53] you are known oh praise God
[51:57] hallelujah and so and so so that pretty
[52:02] spanner who is him the divine love and
[52:06] proceed weirdest tongue it will cease
[52:10] weirdest knowledge it will vanish where
[52:13] does faith it will fill all this is
[52:15] fulfill but when that which is prophets
[52:18] come he says which is love divine love
[52:23] amen and the Sunna say God is long I'm
[52:26] the one who lives in God you see him and
[52:29] go live see him hallelujah
[52:33] Chris a lot so I noted tonight that's
[52:36] where we are and he said and again he
[52:39] said that Critias puppet is the word in
[52:42] food so it is to put into context and
[52:45] what I said that means from it is come
[52:47] we know what we're doing we are where we
[52:49] are and what is what has come to us is
[52:53] it is the first of the world and
[52:55] somebody asks problem in question answer
[52:59] he says please explain first for
[53:01] internship director chambers it will
[53:03] lead to 212 and and the question was now
[53:07] that now that the puppet world is
[53:10] restored to the church the church and
[53:13] these verses fulfilled if you look at
[53:16] that question that's what that brought
[53:18] us aside the question by him or herself
[53:21] yes he says now that now that the world
[53:25] is restored so what else is who s is the
[53:30] word but God love I mean I mean I'm they
[53:36] if you read out there he said he said
[53:42] now I think I just went to that the
[53:47] entire and when the authorities has come
[53:50] that which is in part shall be done away
[53:51] with
[53:52] Paul said though I speak with tongues of
[53:54] men and angels and do I speak these
[53:57] things but when the authorities come now
[54:00] it's easier anything of it but God see
[54:04] actually tell you by asking question no
[54:08] easy no sunset is
[54:11] perfect yes the beginning was I'm the
[54:15] Commission said the word Amen hallelujah
[54:18] and the word was with god and the word
[54:21] and the word was god amen and what is to
[54:26] God praise the Lord
[54:31] how are we doing so they said in the
[54:42] Oval of God therefore after him the
[54:44] fullness we cannot point to something
[54:47] else it points back to him the word
[54:52] unbound P the Bible just like what men
[54:54] did last Sunday P the Bible that same
[54:56] before next year present Lord it says
[54:59] this is the complete revelation a man
[55:02] nothing can be added or taken from each
[55:04] there is a compilation all that they
[55:09] should offer him to come but when he
[55:10] came he was perfect so that which is
[55:17] forbid us come amen
[55:20] who the Lord so he said how how did he
[55:28] accomplish in our day
[55:30] so the the perfect one was made known to
[55:34] us when as we all know when the several
[55:36] super convention was open and he said in
[55:39] his reunion now notice but but at the
[55:43] opener with seven seals relation chain
[55:46] before word is been born into
[55:50] manifestation again and vindicated by
[55:55] the Spirit of God your full strength it
[56:00] was when it was when he was here on it
[56:04] so it was strength as it was when he was
[56:08] here on earth manifested in the same way
[56:11] doing the same things that he did when
[56:14] it was here own if it was a gross amen
[56:19] and so on he said moving on he said in
[56:23] the answer say that
[56:25] we have today Amanda by the help of God
[56:30] the perfect interpretation of the word
[56:34] with divine vindication do you see where
[56:39] you have resistance amazing by the grace
[56:43] of God we have a prophet in the pressure
[56:45] of the world of the work with divine
[56:49] vindication so why is he coming why is
[56:52] he here and what is he doing right now
[56:55] as we talk amen
[56:57] he's here to gather the bride amen
[57:02] I will say here remember in what time is
[57:07] it sir he says then we've got the
[57:10] revelation in these last days for the
[57:12] message of the Lord to go gather his
[57:15] bride no other age has it been promised
[57:18] in swamis in this age mark I for look
[57:24] something 30 days like an egg when the
[57:27] Son of Man is revealed what is it God
[57:31] very in flesh
[57:33] you are so and so you came from Tucson
[57:36] so I lost me before for your enemies
[57:38] this was a problem no men that was price
[57:45] Alleluia oh man he said this draw of
[57:49] John 14:12 jewel to that eight these
[57:52] promises are just exactly like John the
[57:55] Baptist and they define himself instance
[57:56] in Scripture and so why are we here
[58:02] tonight I think it was a brother Zeke
[58:06] were talking about you know how we all
[58:09] came God taught us you know in his own
[58:14] way if I should if we should tell our
[58:15] testimonies
[58:16] it will all be mind-blowing how God
[58:20] called you and Isaac's testimony amen
[58:25] can you imagine this the same book was
[58:28] near rubbish I was supposed to be thrown
[58:30] away hallelujah praise God who let him
[58:35] there yeah
[58:36] who made you know what's the
[58:40] circumstance uh he was a tree in a
[58:43] church where there was supposedly
[58:45] supernatural manifestation so it's not
[58:48] just from the tournament my position
[58:50] because Pentecostals
[58:51] can heal the sick raise the dead Chris a
[58:55] lot go do what denied the word praise
[58:59] the Lord he will turn them about Godhead
[59:01] they say forget about it you are trying
[59:04] to spit here I remember when we were in
[59:06] medical school when I got the message
[59:20] then I knew that I can help anybody I
[59:24] have to run my own race praise Allah
[59:26] so dust of God is you and if you are
[59:32] blowing this message it is not a mistake
[59:34] I mean God put them to be Buddhist
[59:38] majority we hear this word and receive
[59:40] it
[59:42] alone so and then use the history of the
[59:47] ego and the eaglet to tap him so he let
[59:51] X the eaglets the ego literally takes
[59:53] and then and there's somebody pitch it
[59:57] and put under the head or something I've
[59:58] done I've got hushed and here was it
[1:00:01] with a glare would be with the chickens
[1:00:04] with a new cheeks they were all you know
[1:00:08] come out picking on the ground equal to
[1:00:09] stop men to pick some edges around the
[1:00:11] goose is meant to fly in the air Amen
[1:00:15] somebody say Amen we are supposed to fly
[1:00:22] into the heavenly places and Savior and
[1:00:26] be blessed but every switch our blessing
[1:00:29] a man in your life amen
[1:00:32] there was no right to oppress you to
[1:00:36] suppress you right to make you sad I
[1:00:38] make you afraid you made he has right to
[1:00:41] try you but you got to know your right
[1:00:44] to say to take the sword of the word and
[1:00:48] chopping down by taking the promise
[1:00:50] somebody say Amen so when the motor it
[1:00:55] will give a scream scream and then the
[1:00:57] other other the chicken they went to
[1:01:00] cover oh my this is a Rondo trainer like
[1:01:03] the truth but as it is see here I see
[1:01:07] all right and they rather cover but
[1:01:10] something about his voice yeah you know
[1:01:17] sympathy in me amazing reason watching
[1:01:20] with that voice mama have known from
