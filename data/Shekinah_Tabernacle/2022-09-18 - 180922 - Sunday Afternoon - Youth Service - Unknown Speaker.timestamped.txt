[34:27] amen
[34:35] and it says here and being in beth uh
[34:38] bethany the house of simon
[34:41] the leper he sat at me so this is jesus
[34:43] and we will i trust we all know the
[34:45] story became a woman having an alabaster
[34:47] box appointment and spikenard very
[34:49] precious
[34:50] and she broke the box and poured it on
[34:52] his head
[34:54] and there were some
[34:56] and there were some that had indignation
[34:58] within themselves and said
[35:00] why was this waste appointment made
[35:03] for it might have been sold for more
[35:04] than 300 pence
[35:06] and have been given to the poor and they
[35:08] murmured against her
[35:11] amen and jesus said let her alone why
[35:13] trouble you her she hath wrought a good
[35:15] work for me
[35:16] for she for ye have the poor with you
[35:19] always when so ever you
[35:21] well ye may do them good but you have
[35:25] uh but me ye have not always she has
[35:28] done what she could she has come
[35:29] beforehand to anoint my body to the
[35:32] bearing
[35:33] verily i send you whether so ever the
[35:35] gospel shall be preached throughout the
[35:37] whole world this also that she hath done
[35:39] shall be spoken for a memorial for her
[35:42] i mean how powerful
[35:45] amen
[35:46] amen so i was thinking on that i want to
[35:48] preach my sermon um this afternoon is
[35:51] called our past faults can't hold us i
[35:53] mean so what we do
[35:55] actually doesn't affect us you know if
[35:56] we if if it's forgiven us god forgives
[35:59] us it cannot hold us at all amen amen
[36:02] and i'd like to look at the story and
[36:03] just use a story for a little bit of as
[36:05] an example
[36:06] i like to think on this woman you know
[36:08] the act that she did she brought her
[36:10] alabaster box to jesus you know
[36:12] and i was thinking you know i i like to
[36:14] think about the story a little bit and
[36:15] you know maybe
[36:17] you know she didn't let you know what
[36:18] she did wrong take bring that blue box
[36:20] woman and anoint jesus you know she
[36:22] didn't let it allow it to stop her and
[36:25] i like to think you know maybe she
[36:26] worked for a whole year you know to to
[36:28] she she all she wants stills i want to
[36:30] buy this alabaster box and anoint jesus
[36:32] i mean maybe she worked for one entire
[36:34] year you know to buy this box for jesus
[36:36] and you know it would have been hard
[36:37] it's like oh you know who faults might
[36:39] have got to after week one you know i've
[36:41] done this i shouldn't really be doing
[36:42] this but maybe she pressed on and she
[36:44] saved up enough money to to buy this box
[36:46] i mean because you know the people back
[36:48] in those days you know they weren't they
[36:50] weren't very rich
[36:52] and you know maybe she was one of those
[36:53] people you know quite poor so you're
[36:54] just here to save up for a while
[36:56] and then you know also you know maybe
[36:58] there was someone
[36:59] taking an example you know maybe she was
[37:01] real poor she went to the sky and she
[37:02] says oh could i please buy some some
[37:04] bread some food off you and you know
[37:06] maybe turn her down and shamed her
[37:07] because oh you know you're poor and and
[37:09] maybe he was with you know adam and
[37:12] and bethany with with um simon let her
[37:14] in them and with with jesus you know
[37:16] maybe he was sitting there and she came
[37:17] and she says oh no look who's here you
[37:19] know i've this man's disgraced me and i
[37:21] have to go be disgraced again and as you
[37:23] know but this is how i have to get to
[37:25] god you know but she made it and and and
[37:28] look what happened to her for doing that
[37:31] um
[37:33] this also that she has done this is
[37:35] verse nine done shall be spoken for a of
[37:38] for a memorial of her she gets
[37:41] remembered amen amen
[37:43] i mean i believe you know she gets
[37:44] eternal life i mean but how how powerful
[37:47] is that you know she don't
[37:48] shouldn't allow her faults to stop her
[37:51] and and now she's remembered amen so she
[37:53] pushed
[37:54] me
[37:55] she she pushed on through
[37:57] man
[37:58] hey man oh sorry you guys might be
[38:00] seated i'm sorry
[38:01] sorry i don't think you've got it done
[38:17] and then if we could turn to um
[38:19] james five and then we'll go
[38:22] to verse 15. so james chapter five and
[38:24] then go versus 15.
[38:30] so james 5 and
[38:32] verse 15 it says here and the pure of
[38:35] faith shall save the sick
[38:38] and the lord shall raise him up
[38:40] and if he have committed sins they shall
[38:42] be forgiven him amen so if you've ever
[38:44] done anything wrong it shall be forgiven
[38:46] you and then also says here in verse 16
[38:48] confess your faults one to another
[38:52] and pray one for another that you may be
[38:54] healed and i was gonna finish there and
[38:55] so you know you know confessing our
[38:58] faults there are certain things that if
[38:59] we do we must go apologize for those
[39:02] things
[39:03] no yes but you know we we we can't you
[39:05] know just
[39:07] you can go apologize for you know
[39:08] whatever you want you know but it's you
[39:10] know i wouldn't but you know there are
[39:12] there are certain things that there are
[39:14] certain things that you must you know
[39:16] some things you do you have to apologize
[39:19] and and you know it's you know once we
[39:21] confess our faults god can then there's
[39:23] a light come because you know satan
[39:24] likes as well in darkness you know
[39:27] as soon as soon as we we bring that
[39:29] darkness to the light light just shines
[39:30] and it just and and we can see things
[39:32] what it is you know we're not we're not
[39:34] stumbled at this massive darkness we can
[39:36] just step over it like it's a little a
[39:38] little twiggy you know just step on it
[39:40] amen
[39:41] amen i want to use i want to use a bit
[39:43] of a bit of an example i was um
[39:47] there was this place that i've been to
[39:50] and you know i didn't like it all and i
[39:52] you know it but and and i left and then
[39:54] a couple months later i was it was kind
[39:56] of you know satan likes to everything's
[39:57] glamorized i say hollywood it's actually
[39:59] the where they have the hollywood um
[40:02] uh like presentation stuff it's actually
[40:04] like a place in the hood or some you
[40:05] know some real dumb place but it's got a
[40:07] nice signboard you know that everybody
[40:09] can see those like this you know and you
[40:11] know satan was trying to glamorize it
[40:12] for me i'm like man you know i wonder if
[40:14] i should go back and then something
[40:15] inside me said no that's extremely wrong
[40:17] and i actually and i and i
[40:20] and i apologized for being there in the
[40:22] first place
[40:23] and then instantly
[40:24] the light shone man also oh my goodness
[40:26] what an awful dark place i never ever am
[40:28] going back there again in my life amen
[40:35] it was so terrifying i was like oh my
[40:36] goodness
[40:37] but yeah you know we um
[40:40] you know if we our faults shouldn't let
[40:42] us you know shouldn't shouldn't hinder
[40:43] us
[40:45] you know because we're the bride of
[40:46] christ
[40:47] amen and it says in the bible you know
[40:49] that um once you're saved i think it's
[40:51] in john or something once you're saved
[40:53] no man shall pluck you out of the
[40:54] world's hand so if you you know you
[40:56] can't go anywhere anymore you're now
[40:58] you're trapped and you've been giving
[40:59] this eternal life that you can't let go
[41:01] amen
[41:02] amen so
[41:04] why do we why would we live in our
[41:06] faults and just let things you know
[41:07] smash us down man we want to raise up
[41:09] because yeah
[41:10] amen
[41:12] oh they're quite powerful and then um uh
[41:15] brother branham
[41:16] actually does um i just want to read a
[41:18] quote from brother branham
[41:20] and he says here amen put um
[41:23] put them in the sea of forgetfulness and
[41:26] remember them no more that's what kind
[41:28] of god we have not goes and digs it up
[41:30] again and holds it against you
[41:32] forget i forget
[41:35] amen that's the brother that's what
[41:36] brother branham says you know god god um
[41:39] uh devil's saying you know god doesn't
[41:41] have a um god doesn't have a satan's got
[41:44] a book you know and he just opens up and
[41:46] so you know sam's got a book about each
[41:47] and every one of us you know and it's
[41:49] it's you know it's not about the good
[41:50] things it's just you know what we did
[41:51] wrong you know we feel down he comes and
[41:53] tries to read it to us
[41:54] little little little passages of what we
[41:56] where we messed up but amen but god
[41:58] doesn't have one of those he just grabs
[41:59] it and throws it away i mean so it
[42:02] wasn't there to begin with
[42:04] amen
[42:07] i found i was like you know what what a
[42:08] great god we serve you know he doesn't
[42:10] just doesn't just disgruntle us and hold
[42:12] us down you know
[42:13] yeah
[42:20] with positive people amen so there's you
[42:22] know it's just awesome to be to be here
[42:25] be with you guys and just yeah with a
[42:27] lot of
[42:28] positive brethren that no i've loved
[42:30] people and you know generally there's
[42:31] nothing wrong anyways you know it's just
[42:33] an awesome awesome place to be you know
[42:35] yeah it's like man how how how amazing
[42:38] yeah anyway
[42:41] yeah i'm just gonna i'm just gonna leave
[42:42] it at that but i hope you all were we're
[42:45] truly
[42:56] blessed amen
[43:29] [Music]
[43:33] thank you
[43:37] [Music]
[43:51] get that
[43:52] [Music]
[44:00] because he's given
[44:04] jesus christ
[44:08] is
[44:12] [Music]
[44:30] [Music]
[44:31] jesus christ
[44:36] [Music]
[44:58] has
[45:00] [Music]
[45:24] the lord has done
[45:34] [Music]
[45:45] [Applause]
[45:48] [Music]
[45:58] jesus christ
[46:03] [Music]
[46:17] [Music]
[46:25] jesus christ
[46:30] [Music]
[46:39] you can sit now if you want
[46:46] this is a little bit strange for me
[46:48] because uh english is not my first
[46:50] language
[46:52] i know that you are
[46:54] quite familiar now with a south african
[46:56] accent
[46:57] but now you're going to have to get used
[46:59] to the spanish one
[47:05] so
[47:06] and probably
[47:08] i'm not going to speak for long but i
[47:10] thought that brother david he was going
[47:11] to speak for a longer time
[47:14] so probably he's going to be the
[47:15] favorite of the kids now
[47:19] so we can open our bibles in a
[47:23] book of luke
[47:24] chapter 15
[47:26] and verse 11 this is a very
[47:29] uh popular story
[47:32] it's the prodigal son
[47:42] um
[47:44] amen
[47:46] so i said
[47:47] and he said
[47:49] a certain man had two sons
[47:51] and the younger of them said to his
[47:53] father father give me the portion of
[47:56] good
[47:57] that followeth to me and he divided unto
[48:00] them his living
[48:01] and not many days after the younger son
[48:04] gather all together and took his journey
[48:07] into a far country
[48:08] and they wasted his substance with
[48:10] righteous living
[48:12] we can pray now
[48:14] almighty lord
[48:15] we want to give you thanks for
[48:17] everything thank you thank you
[48:19] for that service that we have this
[48:21] morning lord thank you for your blessing
[48:23] sir we want to ask you to please use me
[48:26] lord to
[48:27] probably just bless someone that needs
[48:30] to hear something from you my lord we
[48:32] want to ask you this in the name of our
[48:34] lord jesus christ amen amen
[48:38] so
[48:39] i felt in my heart to talk about this
[48:42] because i wanted to talk about another
[48:44] thing i wanted to preach about the king
[48:46] david
[48:47] what no when i was driving
[48:50] my car from levin
[48:52] i felt in my heart the entire week to
[48:55] to say something to to the young people
[48:58] so
[48:59] if you are not young you can walk out
[49:03] no just kidding
[49:06] so
[49:08] i wanted to
[49:09] share a little bit of my testimony
[49:11] because when i was a kid i was like one
[49:13] of you i was
[49:14] always a church
[49:16] and i was like one of you guys when when
[49:18] you sing you lift your hands
[49:21] and you feel the presence of the lord
[49:24] amen
[49:27] so
[49:28] one of the most beautiful remember that
[49:31] i have when i was a kid
[49:34] was when my parents they used to rent
[49:36] this old
[49:38] vhs you know there's movies
[49:40] all movies my brother
[49:43] and we used to watch movies about uh
[49:46] king david or jonah
[49:48] and all these movies and we were
[49:49] learning about the lord
[49:51] i'm pretty sure that some of you parents
[49:54] you're doing the thing and you try to
[49:56] teach your kids about the world
[49:59] and
[50:00] and that was a blessing for us for me
[50:02] and my brother my brother just did
[50:04] so he knows that everything what i'm
[50:06] what i'm going to say is true
[50:08] [Laughter]
[50:10] so
[50:11] there is a proverb
[50:13] uh a very
[50:15] true proverb that said train up
[50:18] a child in the way
[50:20] that he should go and when he is all he
[50:23] will not depart from it
[50:26] and that's why it's so important that
[50:28] you young people are here because you're
[50:30] learning the way your parents are
[50:33] teaching you the way this is the only
[50:35] way that's the only this is the only way
[50:39] so when i start to grow up my parents
[50:42] they start to
[50:43] um
[50:45] trying to get us more involved
[50:47] in the church so they start to
[50:50] um
[50:50] buying us guitars or mandolins from my
[50:54] brother
[50:55] so we they wanted us to be more involved
[50:59] with the church and we and be active at
[51:01] church and that's so good my brother he
[51:04] is so nice when you can see that if
[51:07] someone is playing the base and go to
[51:09] the bathroom there's like three little
[51:11] kids that try to grab the base
[51:14] or the guitar or whatever they just want
[51:16] to be there
[51:19] that was something that really touched
[51:21] my heart the first time that i came here
[51:23] when we moved the first service i came
[51:25] here
[51:25] we were i think we were singing um my
[51:28] god no
[51:29] yes my god is awesome
[51:31] and there was a little kid behind me
[51:34] and he was singing just
[51:37] almost
[51:39] i don't know how to say it
[51:41] but he was singing so loud my god is
[51:44] awesome
[51:45] and i feel so blessed with the young kid
[51:47] here because man they they're so nice
[51:51] that's all good i i really love them
[51:53] glory so
[51:55] my childhood
[51:57] got like engraving my heart with all
[51:59] those
[52:00] beautiful moments that my parents and
[52:02] they were trying to teach me the word
[52:04] and that was just awesome
[52:06] that's something when you grow up you
[52:08] cannot get rid of it
[52:10] because
[52:11] that's really really engraving your
[52:13] heart
[52:14] yes but when i became a teenager
[52:17] i became more wise too
[52:20] all wise
[52:21] [Laughter]
[52:24] and i started to doubt
[52:26] about everything everything in the bible
[52:29] that wonderful book became to me like a
[52:32] book of tales
[52:34] i didn't want to believe anymore in the
[52:36] bible there were so many
[52:38] stories like a donkey that speak
[52:41] and and the whale and i thought no no
[52:45] there's now i'm smarter yeah i don't
[52:48] want to believe this
[52:49] no
[52:50] no
[52:51] but the thing is
[52:53] that in my house my parents
[52:56] they were praying for me
[52:58] and they knew what i was going through
[53:00] and they were praying for me they were
[53:02] praying for me and i really give them a
[53:03] hard time
[53:05] really give them a hard time my brother
[53:07] and
[53:08] when the devil start to drag me to the
[53:10] world
[53:11] was slowly but slowly
[53:14] with music
[53:16] with a girlfriend with alcohol with
[53:19] drugs but slowly slowly
[53:22] and there was a time that was just in
[53:25] the world
[53:26] i could realize that man
[53:29] i'm here in the world i don't want to
[53:30] believe in god
[53:32] because no one of my friends believed in
[53:33] god
[53:35] so i don't want to believe i wanted to
[53:36] fit with them
[53:38] but
[53:39] my childhood was here yeah hey man
[53:43] and when i realized that i was totally
[53:46] lost
[53:47] i knew there was a deep calling a deep
[53:50] my brother hallelujah
[53:52] and i was told and there was no way out
[53:55] so i prayed to the lord so i was a
[53:58] atheist i didn't want to believe in god
[53:59] but i prayed
[54:03] because i i really knew that it was a
[54:05] god yes i wanted to say there was not
[54:08] but i knew that there was a god
[54:10] hallelujah
[54:11] in
[54:13] in the verse 17
[54:14] of the parable of the prodigal son said
[54:17] and when he came to himself
[54:20] and that's what happened to me when
[54:22] you can be lost but there is a moment
[54:24] that you
[54:26] you you come to yourself and you realize
[54:29] everything and and keep saying and he
[54:32] said how many um hard servants of my
[54:34] fathers have bred enough
[54:37] and to spare and i perish with hunger
[54:41] and i realized i was lost but i prayed
[54:44] to the lord
[54:45] and my mind got restored
[54:48] amen
[54:51] so
[54:52] when i was when i was a kid i always
[54:55] listened to the um
[54:57] to the other brother saying
[54:59] god is my savior
[55:01] but to me he was not mercedes because i
[55:04] was not lost but when i got lost
[55:07] i could see that he was my savior
[55:10] amen amen
[55:12] but you don't have to go to the world to
[55:14] realize about that
[55:16] because in the world there's no anything
[55:18] for you
[55:19] you are not going to be blessed in the
[55:20] world because you are meant to be here
[55:23] here here's your place it doesn't matter
[55:26] if some of your friends they can be
[55:28] happy over there
[55:30] but you're not going to be happy because
[55:31] the lord is going to drag you here
[55:34] there is no escape
[55:36] i'm so sorry there's no
[55:38] glory there's no okay for you my brother
[55:42] so
[55:43] all the time when i was um
[55:45] reading the parable of the prodigal son
[55:49] um there's not many people talking about
[55:52] the father's side of that story because
[55:54] i'm pretty sure that that father he was
[55:56] just praying for his son
[55:58] and he was praying and praying
[56:00] and there is a
[56:03] in the book of acts chapter 16 verse 31
[56:06] said
[56:07] and they said believe
[56:09] on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt
[56:11] be saved in thy house
[56:14] so to that promise you can hold
[56:17] and you know that your kids
[56:19] they need to come back
[56:22] there's there's no way out
[56:23] it's a promise from the lord yeah that's
[56:25] right so the lord had another plans for
[56:27] me
[56:28] and i'm very happy that to be here my
[56:31] brother
[56:32] and today i can tell you all of you kids
[56:36] that there's nothing for you over there
[56:38] there's just sorrows
[56:40] you're gonna be sad you're not gonna be
[56:42] happy you're gonna be happy just for a
[56:44] couple of months or something
[56:46] but
[56:47] believe me god is going to make your
[56:50] life this is a little bit hard
[56:52] but your life is going to be miserable
[56:55] out there because you are not meant to
[56:57] be there you are meant to be here
[57:01] so
[57:02] and probably one day you can walk off
[57:05] through that those doors
[57:08] and believe that you are never going to
[57:09] come back
[57:11] but you are going to
[57:12] and the way that you're going to go out
[57:14] is not the same way that you are going
[57:16] to return
[57:17] you are going to
[57:18] come back like with a broken heart
[57:21] and only you're going to to normal
[57:23] brother surrender your heart to the lord
[57:25] there's nothing for you over there
[57:28] so
[57:29] our heavenly father he's not gonna let
[57:31] us to get lost yeah and
[57:34] now
[57:35] um me and my brother we are third
[57:38] generations of believers and the story
[57:40] started with my grandma that she was one
[57:43] day in the countryside
[57:45] and she heard a sound
[57:47] in the field and she ran there and there
[57:49] was some
[57:50] missionary brothers preaching the gospel
[57:53] in the middle of nowhere
[57:55] and she believed
[57:56] and by the faith of that old woman
[57:59] my grandfather is going to be safe
[58:02] my uncles are going to be safe
[58:04] and all our family is going to be safe
[58:06] my brother and
[58:08] me and pedro we are now
[58:10] opera and i
[58:12] how do you say that
[58:16] we are the first generation now here on
[58:18] a higher ground my brother
[58:20] we are the first generation believe in
[58:22] the message
[58:24] so
[58:25] just to end
[58:26] the decision that you're going to make
[58:28] today or in a couple of days is going to
[58:31] affect your future
[58:34] yeah so you
[58:35] you should choose wisely because with
[58:38] god everything
[58:39] everything is possible and there's no
[58:42] anything for you out there
[58:44] and
[58:45] there is so many brothers here that they
[58:47] can tell you the same thing it doesn't
[58:50] know anything for you out there
[58:52] anything
[58:54] and
[58:55] i heard once that to remember something
[58:57] you need to do something different
[59:00] otherwise you forget
[59:02] so i really would like you young people
[59:05] to stand up and go and give a hug to
[59:07] your parents
[59:08] and tell them how much you love them
[59:11] and how much you
[59:13] how happy you are for your parents to
[59:15] teach you the way
[59:17] how to go to heaven so you can now stand
[59:21] and go and hug your parents if they are
[59:22] here
[59:27] [Music]
[59:36] so one day if one day
[59:39] you start believing that you are smarter
[59:42] i want you to remember this moment
[59:46] the moment when you were so grateful to
[59:48] the lord
[59:52] so
[59:53] that's all what i have that's all i want
[59:55] to i wanted to share with you
[59:58] and i would like to invite brother kiera
