[6:09] [Music]
[8:02] I enjoy coming to church I enjoy
[8:11] conventions I enjoy meetings special
[8:13] meetings and that but there's something
[8:16] about your own fellowship that where the
[8:19] Lord's called you the Lord's place you
[8:20] and you can just go there and be
[8:24] faithful we can week at weekend we cap
[8:27] and be in our place sometimes they're
[8:32] going is good sometimes the goings rough
[8:34] whatever it is we're there we press on
[8:36] and yeah this is the this is the first
[8:39] service after our camp who had a good
[8:41] camp a good good camp meetings in well I
[8:44] guess none of the people here was anyone
[8:46] here young enough to go to the camp and
[8:47] this in here yeah I think it was 35 was
[8:54] the cutoff you know I think I'm 35 or
[8:56] thei I think I'm 35 maybe 36 but I'm
[9:02] pretty sure it's 35 I might yeah okay so
[9:05] yeah I could have made it to the Kemp if
[9:09] I wasn't married and had children
[9:11] because I think there were some 35 year
[9:14] olds at the camp that were that were
[9:16] there as campers man makes me feel old I
[9:20] think having children and that sort of
[9:23] thing you the responsibilities of life
[9:27] are slightly different when you've got
[9:29] children and that sort of thing in it
[9:30] your approach to life is different you
[9:32] kind of not really young anymore you
[9:36] find it
[9:39] I refuse to get old brother in you're
[9:45] not old are you
[9:46] no men they're a and here as young as
[9:50] anything little boy you know free and
[9:53] the Spirit of God our spirits don't get
[9:55] old men the body does its thing and
[9:58] deceives everyone but the Spirit is yang
[10:00] full of life that's what I love about
[10:03] Christians he just doesn't matter how
[10:06] old they get they're full of life
[10:07] because their spirit is alive you know
[10:10] there's nothing worse than seeing an
[10:12] unbeliever and just watching their
[10:13] spirit become decrepit and start to die
[10:16] because it's an unfortunate thing but
[10:18] their spirit will one day die like and
[10:22] it's kind of like it goes through this
[10:23] process they get they complain they're
[10:25] when as they say they're all they it's
[10:27] all negative it's the spirits going down
[10:29] I'm so glad that we can stay alive and
[10:32] be fresh the old people as young as the
[10:35] young people that's the way that it is
[10:36] so let's we're probably going to get
[10:39] interrupted halfway through by the I
[10:41] think the troops are on some secret
[10:43] mission outside but let's um let's stand
[10:48] this morning and welcome at the service

[25:42] amen praise the Lord on that though
[25:46] let's maybe count our blessings you can
[25:48] take a seat who's got a testimony this
[25:50] morning I was going to do one more song
[25:51] but maybe someones got a testimony from
[25:53] camp or something like that big like
[25:55] this year brother Adam and come up here
[26:01] but man so we can hear you in the
[26:03] microphone
[26:12] good morning Saints has been a wonderful
[26:16] camp but sometimes when when God deals
[26:19] with you it's not always fun you know
[26:21] it's like here you ask ask the question
[26:25] Lord what am I missing
[26:27] and you've not dealt with me for a while
[26:29] you know and I was in this Jubilee and
[26:31] all those things and and I stood still I
[26:34] said Lord I'm missing something no I'm
[26:37] not being dealt with you know and I want
[26:39] to learn more about you and get closer
[26:41] to you but I can't do it if you don't
[26:43] help me and of course they knee he
[26:45] doubted was me and I was pride here oh
[26:47] man I was proud you know I couldn't take
[26:49] what he was saying to me and it came out
[26:51] of the word and it was perfect but my
[26:54] thought was different and instead of
[26:57] just entertaining the thought I did what
[27:00] brother Branham said always to do and I
[27:02] went back to the word and I kept asking
[27:04] the Lord I said Lord I'm missing
[27:05] something you know this is hurting it's
[27:07] not I don't agree with it but I agree
[27:09] with it and I don't want to go into
[27:10] details because I don't think it's it's
[27:12] time for that but I want to say is I was
[27:14] confused and it was about the Word of
[27:17] God and Word of God is never confusing
[27:19] it does not confuse you it is perfect
[27:22] and I kept looking and I kept looking
[27:24] and I and I just kept looking I said
[27:26] lord I don't understand when I went to
[27:28] camp brother then he preached about when
[27:31] he went to preach and he was empty as
[27:34] empty as he could be he says but the man
[27:36] told him after the service there was a
[27:38] man behind you holding you up that whole
[27:40] service and that was me before camp and
[27:43] because when camp happened you go into
[27:45] camp mode you just start working and and
[27:47] you do what you need to do and you lay
[27:49] aside all these things because now you
[27:50] it's for the children it's not for us
[27:52] but they were still that emptiness
[27:55] inside and when he preached that God say
[27:58] but now I can deal with it because I
[27:59] carried you through this whole thing and
[28:01] all that brother Danny was preaching
[28:02] about was about pretty much what I was
[28:05] going through and so the praise the Lord
[28:07] even in when we were serving I was being
[28:10] served and that's how God is but he's
[28:12] never confusing these words never
[28:14] confusing it is 100 percent just
[28:17] sometimes you need to lay in the
[28:19] presence of God and keep baking and keep
[28:21] baking until that shell breaks and you
[28:23] can get
[28:23] through its the hardest thing to do but
[28:26] trust me God gets the glory every time I
[28:29] pray so if it could help anyone who all
[28:32] goes through hard times just keep laying
[28:35] in his prisons and go back to his word
[28:37] every time and it will be alright I know
[28:40] so to God be the glory amen anyone else
[28:58] right brother George Ellis here maybe
[29:14] come up here then we can hear you I
[29:16] didn't mean to put you on the spot I
[29:17] wasn't going to I just looked at you and
[29:18] I saw your face beaming enough of I mean
[29:28] I wasn't planning to give a testimony
[29:30] but Sunday evening was very very
[29:35] powerful very powerful I was I was blown
[29:41] away completely I was crushed completely
[29:44] I was I think that's the evangelizing
[29:47] spirit that ministry you know it
[29:51] sometimes is like fire and brimstone but
[29:54] it's you know it's a shaking it's a
[29:57] wake-up call you know and I felt like I
[30:06] felt like a soldier who was had
[30:12] neglected his duties you know and and
[30:15] the Lord comes in you know the training
[30:19] soldiers get is you know sometimes
[30:25] Special Forces come in and take your
[30:27] weapon it you have to tell you up you're
[30:31] not you're not up you're not you know
[30:37] logically you're not alert yes and it's
[30:41] part of the training
[30:42] I mean God loves us even and even if he
[30:45] does that and that's what they do in the
[30:49] army you know they don't kick you away
[30:51] they just train you they just come and
[30:53] beat you they'll say you know where's
[30:56] your weapon here it is I've got it you
[31:00] know taking it away you know and it is
[31:03] part of the training and it is and it's
[31:06] you know although as much as I don't
[31:09] want to give this kind of testimony it
[31:11] is true and I felt like a soldier that
[31:15] had neglected his duty and uh and man
[31:20] sunday sunday was you know was pretty
[31:23] rough was pretty rough for me but it is
[31:27] a testimony from god but even the way I
[31:30] felt was quite rough and but Tuesday man
[31:39] Tuesday came in and that was that was
[31:45] you know I told brother Andy that was
[31:48] custom made yeah you get a suit and man
[31:54] and you know the Lord measures in and
[31:56] that suit is for you and I think the
[32:02] Lord was so and it was such an
[32:07] encouraging moment and you know although
[32:12] army life is not our entire life you
[32:16] know we're in balanced society we're not
[32:18] you know supposed not like Spartans you
[32:22] know living like a military life you
[32:27] know God has you know has has laid out
[32:32] everything for us you know we you know
[32:34] we're supposed to farm we're supposed to
[32:37] herd
[32:41] we're supposed to do many things but we
[32:44] are soldiers of God as well yeah
[32:46] and we have we need to be trained and I
[32:50] pray I pray to God that He will give us
[32:53] the training you know be like true
[32:58] soldiers of gods
[33:04] [Applause]
[33:16] it's not really a testimony it's just um
[33:18] glorifying God I didn't want to go to
[33:21] the camp I was looking forward to it
[33:23] and lots of things had happened and I'd
[33:26] built up walls and complexes around my
[33:29] heart from hurts and instead of taking
[33:31] good intentions are always to bad
[33:33] intentions because I'd been feeding the
[33:35] black dog I hadn't had much time for
[33:37] praying with the Lord so in something
[33:39] comes along and starts attacking you
[33:41] you can't just laid aside to the Lord
[33:43] and just keep walking on and so yes I
[33:45] was not looking forward to camp but on
[33:48] Sunday night the Lord took everything
[33:51] it's broke down all the walls he broke
[33:53] down all the complexes and it is
[33:54] completely full making such joy and love
[33:57] that I've been missing in my life I've
[33:59] missed that love and I just want to
[34:01] thank him so much that he was so
[34:03] thoughtful - even though I didn't want
[34:06] to go he still knew he was gonna meet me
[34:08] there and just completely change me
[34:09] again and I'm thankful to him for that
[34:11] so praise God for it praise the Lord
[34:20] brother George maybe that was prophetic
[34:22] what we've been calling you the last
[34:24] couple of weeks
[34:25] so rather jaws is Greek you know and
[34:28] then you know the Spartans are kind of
[34:29] Greek so yeah and they're these
[34:35] naturally speaking supposedly they're
[34:37] they're like warriors you know that you
[34:41] know one man can kill a hundred sort of
[34:43] type of guys you know so we could have
[34:45] we've been joking around and calling
[34:47] brother jords of sparta hey it's true
[34:50] your brother you're a spiritual Spartan
[34:51] I mean any late son I had an item this

[45:34] scripture
[45:37] well actually 1:1 testimony just as
[45:40] you're as you're turning to Exodus 24 I
[45:43] just got this message from brother
[45:45] Jeremy dear away and um they're away in
[45:47] Auckland but so brother Jeremy he came
[45:51] up for Priya a couple of months ago for
[45:53] one of one of us customers at Moss chef
[45:56] Sarah who had she was going through
[45:59] cancer treatment and that was a couple
[46:03] of months ago and then so she so this is
[46:06] her words I mean sorry his words rather
[46:08] he just sent me no whatsoever he said
[46:09] she came back and said she has no
[46:11] terminal cancer in her body I believe
[46:13] with all my heart that God answered that
[46:15] prayer he is good I mean she's going
[46:17] through going through treatment but now
[46:19] it's gone hallelujah and I trust you all
[46:22] had ably said well let's just read the
[46:24] scripture then we'll saw am i driving
[46:26] this
[46:30] here we go Exodus 24 verses 12 to 15
[46:35] we're gonna have a bit of a sorry bit of
[46:37] a that were chopped up reading but here
[46:42] we are says and the Lord said unto Moses
[46:47] come up to me into the mount and be
[46:50] there and I'll give the tables of stone
[46:52] and a law and commandments which I've
[46:54] written and thou that thou mayst teach
[46:56] them and Moses rose up at his minister
[46:58] Joshua and Moses went up to the into the
[47:01] Mount of God and he said unto the elders
[47:03] tarry ye here for us until we come again
[47:05] unto you and behold Aaron and Hur are
[47:08] with you
[47:08] If any man have any matters to do let
[47:11] him come unto them and Moses went up
[47:14] into the mount and the cloud covered the
[47:16] mount and then we keep reading it says
[47:19] in the glory of the Lord a boat upon
[47:21] Mount Sinai and the cloud covered at six
[47:23] days and the seventh day he called unto
[47:26] Moses there the midst of the cloud and
[47:28] the sight of the glory of the Lord was
[47:30] like a devouring fire on the top of the
[47:32] Mount and the eyes of the children of
[47:33] Israel and Moses went into the midst of
[47:36] the cloud and get him up into the mount
[47:38] and Moses was in the mount forty days
[47:41] and forty nights and then we're going to
[47:44] go to Exodus chapter 28 and we're going
[47:46] to read a couple of scriptures from here
[47:49] and then we're gonna go to Psalms 110
[47:52] just as a bit of a context he sees here
[47:56] now this is excess twenty-eight one two
[47:58] three it says and take them unto these
[48:02] as God speaking to to Moses and take
[48:05] down unto the Aaron thy brother and his
[48:07] sons with them from among the children
[48:10] of Israel and that they may minister
[48:12] unto me in the priest's office even
[48:13] Aaron never a bill Eliezer a thema Aaron
[48:18] sons and thou shalt make holy garments
[48:21] for aaron and thou shalt make holy
[48:24] garments for aaron my brother for glory
[48:26] and for beauty and thou shalt speak unto
[48:28] all that are wise hearted whom i have
[48:30] filled with the spirit of wisdom that
[48:32] they may make Aaron's garments to
[48:34] consecrate him that he may minister unto
[48:36] me in the priest's office now going to
[48:39] read one more scripture in Psalms 110
[48:41] and verses one two three
[48:44] and this all this will all come together
[48:46] as we as we go along the service sums
[48:49] 110 verses 1 2 3 it sees this is just a
[48:56] bit of a context a psalm of David the
[49:00] Lord said unto my lord sit thou at my
[49:02] right hand until I make money in amis
[49:03] thy footstool the Lord shall send a rod
[49:06] of thy strength out of Zion rule thou in
[49:09] the midst of that enemies thy people
[49:12] this is you thy people shall be willing
[49:15] in the day of thy power this is a day of
[49:17] God's power and the beauties of holiness
[49:20] from the womb of the morning
[49:21] thou hast the Jui of thy youth amen
[49:25] let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer

[49:42] way of streaming Lord may this
[49:44] atmosphere that's here may be in their
[49:46] homes Lord father may be more than just

[50:18] anoint each one now we ask in your word
[50:21] Lord especially in Jesus Christ's name
[50:23] Amen amen you may have your seats I just
[50:26] want to mention just quickly about camp
[50:28] so they night was a tremendous every
[50:31] service brother Danny was ministering
[50:33] was a tremendous service Sunday night
[50:36] was like the Pool of Bethesda was open
[50:38] and where God moved and I'm glad you
[50:41] know I would encourage you you can't get
[50:44] that kind of atmosphere watching a
[50:45] recording sometimes you see a recording
[50:48] you think was it really that great but
[50:50] you got to remember being back there it
[50:51] was really that great
[50:52] and so I encourage you friends if we
[50:54] ever have surfaces like that again you
[50:56] don't want to don't rub yourself and be
[50:59] there I mean it was tremendous never
[51:02] seen but then even said this this
[51:04] doesn't always happen like this it at
[51:05] youth camps I was I picked them up from
[51:08] the airport we're driving home and he's
[51:10] ministered at brother Tim Pruitt's youth
[51:12] camp at Louisiana they have it every
[51:13] every Easter time and you should if you
[51:17] go watch those services this there's
[51:19] like six hundred odd youth of their
[51:21] parents are there they have pre Alliance
[51:23] God comes down you see you see even in
[51:25] the video a wave of the Spirit come down
[51:27] upon the people and demons are cast out
[51:29] people are delivered people are filled
[51:31] with the Holy Ghost and I said to him I
[51:34] want meetings like that and that's why
[51:36] we originally had the youth camp with
[51:37] the adults being there as well
[51:38] he said it makes a big difference you
[51:40] know people people they're pulling God
[51:43] speak to them speak to me move move down
[51:45] every pew so I want to say thank you to
[51:48] each and every one I mean for being
[51:50] there you bringing your look of fire it
[51:53] makes a difference makes a big
[51:55] difference amen it was wonderful so I
[52:00] encourage your friends if we have
[52:01] services like that you want to be there
[52:04] because God was there he met Mike he he
[52:08] blew out he totally went beyond my
[52:11] expectation amen and so I was very
[52:14] thankful he had moved like that and it
[52:16] wasn't like it trying to pull people it
[52:18] was just like one big one mind everyone
[52:19] just stood up went forward God came down
[52:22] I saw people I see if on the earth
[52:24] crying out to God God people were
[52:27] changed I mean people were changing
[52:29] those services see people worshiping
[52:31] they never seen worship before people
[52:33] were enjoy seeing people broken but
[52:35] being restored was wonderful as the book
[52:38] of acts going on right there amen
[52:42] that's my testimony from Camp Alleluia
[52:45] amen praise the look so it was wonderful
[52:49] I mean so now I've read here we've read
[52:53] a few a few scriptures and I want you to
[52:56] notice there's a pattern here
[52:58] Moses was called up into the presence of
[53:00] God on Mount Sinai God gave him
[53:03] instructions he gave him a pattern that
[53:05] just
[53:05] it just wasn't the pattern of the of the
[53:07] tabernacle but here this is how the
[53:09] priesthood should be and those who are
[53:12] called to the priesthood what what God
[53:15] delivered to Moses
[53:17] it became material in them they were
[53:20] dressed for a service now the scripture
[53:22] tells us we are kings and priests to God
[53:25] right now we are kings and priests of
[53:27] God is not we will be one day now you
[53:31] are every one who is a believer who's
[53:33] been called by this message as a king
[53:36] and a priest to God does everyone
[53:38] everyone following me but it was Moses
[53:41] received the vision from God and then we
[53:44] read there I want this to really kind of
[53:48] maybe change our thinking a little bit
[53:51] but sees here now God tells them you
[53:56] shall make the garments for the priests
[53:58] here in verse 2 so God used Moses I'm
[54:03] gonna be if I'm a bit slow you know I
[54:06] just am gonna be a bit slow I maybe get
[54:08] the preaching after a while but just
[54:10] just stay with me this is very
[54:12] fundamental because what God God has a
[54:15] pattern in the scripture and he does the
[54:17] same thing
[54:17] I'm gonna go from Moses then I'm going
[54:20] to go to Paul and then I'm going to go
[54:22] to this day amen because this is not
[54:25] just history the Old Testament is not
[54:27] just a history book or or something that
[54:29] doesn't apply to us that's a shadow the
[54:32] Apostle Paul says in the book of Hebrews
[54:34] the law is but a shadow but the reality
[54:36] is Christ
[54:37] so the priesthood that was there in the
[54:39] Old Testament was just a shadow of the
[54:41] reality which we're in today amen but
[54:44] you see only those who addressed only
[54:47] those who addressed by the Prophet could
[54:49] stand as a priest
[54:50] only those who addressed it wasn't those
[54:53] who just decided well I feel like being
[54:55] a priest today and I'll try and you know
[54:57] be partaker of the altar and do
[55:00] different things it was God had to call
[55:01] them amen and the Prophet had to dress
[55:04] them and if they were not dressed
[55:06] according to what the prophet saw in
[55:08] heaven I mean the vision he received on
[55:10] the mountain if they were not dressed
[55:12] according to that they couldn't be a
[55:14] priest
[55:15] amen and even some of some of Aaron's
[55:18] sons they took strange firing before God
[55:21] and God killed them they meant now you
[55:25] say well we're under a season of grace
[55:27] we are under a season of grace but God
[55:30] doesn't change god has a provided way
[55:32] and we must come according to his
[55:35] provided way and he gives us the power
[55:38] by His Spirit to be the priest and king
[55:41] it's not us doing it I y'all feel like
[55:44] doing this today God calls you God
[55:46] speaks to you God draws you you respond
[55:50] to his call and he wants to use you for
[55:51] a purpose it's not just to fill a seat
[55:54] on a Sunday morning or have a different
[55:56] kind of lifestyle you're a king and
[55:58] priest to God God wants to put you in
[56:00] service holily just like David David was
[56:03] carrying fruit from his father to his
[56:06] brothers in the battle he was serving
[56:08] the body and he just found an enemy come
[56:10] upon his way but he was serving serving
[56:13] in the body hey amen and when the good
[56:16] guys made his boast he says well I'm
[56:18] just serving in the body but how did
[56:20] this men defy the armies of the Living
[56:22] God hallelujah and he defeated that
[56:24] devil and it's got to be the same thing
[56:27] with us you got to serve in the body
[56:28] friends we're not here to see what we
[56:30] can we can just get what can we give I'm
[56:33] in the body every joint supplies the
[56:36] needs
[56:36] hallelujah says not like what can I get
[56:38] out of it God place me in the body
[56:41] that I can strengthen the body I'm in
[56:43] one I mean two is better than one
[56:46] hallelujah and God wants a church he
[56:49] wants a body that everyone's in their
[56:51] position fulfilling what they mean to
[56:52] fulfill that the whole body functions
[56:55] Amen so we're going to be in our place
[56:57] God wants to place us in the body
[57:02] hallelujah
[57:03] so now Moses came I'm just gonna Moses
[57:08] came and he was told you dressed them
[57:12] you dressed them they came out of we're
[57:15] gonna read in 1st Peter 2 here the
[57:19] Apostle Peter is now speaking about us
[57:22] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[57:25] all guile and hypocrisy and envies and
[57:29] evil-speaking lay it aside don't speak
[57:32] ill of each other
[57:33] amen don't speak ill of each other as
[57:35] newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
[57:39] the word that ye may grow thereby who
[57:42] wants to grow amen
[57:44] first thing is lay aside all malice and
[57:46] strife and envy who cares about those
[57:49] things it's just you and God I went to
[57:52] camp for me I think I see that the
[57:53] Sunday before camp I'm going for me
[57:55] hallelujah and God came and met my needs
[57:59] amen you talk about lifting burdens I
[58:02] say glory to God take it to the Lord and
[58:05] leave it there we're all in a battle
[58:08] when all immune from the devil trying to
[58:10] bog us down and and put a put a
[58:13] heaviness on us and and tell us it's not
[58:15] for you and you know let's just this
[58:17] just settle down
[58:18] we're not here to relax and the seats of
[58:20] we enter into rest you understand I'm
[58:23] enriched but we're in a battle is a
[58:26] season for fighting and we're fighting
[58:28] there's a season for resting eternally
[58:31] we're resting but this let's buckle on
[58:34] the whole armor I mean let's let's push
[58:37] the devil out hallelujah let's push him
[58:39] out of every life amen why should we
[58:41] settle back and just you know I heard a
[58:43] brother in our Auckland I'm just gonna
[58:46] deliver my heart today amen you know and
[58:48] he said we're not cool to be
[58:50] peacekeepers with the devil just you
[58:52] have this part I'll have this plate
[58:53] everything's fine
[58:54] that's not where there's not what we
[58:56] call - dude the priesthood was vital in
[58:58] Israel I mean because that was the
[59:01] connection with God and when the
[59:03] priesthood was strong the people were
[59:05] strong I mean when the people claims to
[59:08] God and say you'll be my god we'll be
[59:11] your people hallelujah they took the
[59:13] land I mean they drove out the enemy
[59:15] when the priesthood was strong as the
[59:17] same thing in a family when they when
[59:19] the husband is strong in God I mean them
[59:22] I mean the family will prosper when the
[59:24] husband and wife are one and purpose
[59:26] working together hallelujah you got to
[59:29] remember husband and wife for one amen
[59:33] you are one unit some people you looking
[59:38] at me like what you're one flesh
[59:41] and if you're strong you should do every
[59:44] single nurse of heart we're gonna serve
[59:46] God amen we're gonna you know the Bible
[59:50] says that we can now this is just me but
[59:53] no it's not just me but the Bible says
[59:56] you have a piece of passes all
[59:57] understanding Amen that what Christ
[1:00:00] Christ is to the church husbands are
[1:00:02] defeated their wives and what the
[1:00:04] churches what the brightest to Christ
[1:00:06] the wife is to be the husband to the
[1:00:08] husband amen
[1:00:10] so that units strong hallelujah
[1:00:13] you know season Peter you know speaking
[1:00:16] about the mean don't don't you know love
[1:00:22] your wife and all these things that your
[1:00:23] prayers are not hindered it's not it's
[1:00:27] actually your what the husband does will
[1:00:30] hinder the praise I'm just kind of
[1:00:32] putting it out there that's what the
[1:00:34] scripture says but we call to be one
[1:00:36] unit you know we're not we're not called
[1:00:38] just to be in a constant state of trench
[1:00:40] warfare you know where we've got our
[1:00:43] bunkers we've got our frontline and we
[1:00:45] have no man's land and there's the devil
[1:00:47] and he's got his bunkers in his front
[1:00:49] line and we're just firing artillery
[1:00:51] barrage us and maybe doing some you know
[1:00:54] I heard now this is not exactly trench
[1:00:56] warfare but in World War two the Soviets
[1:00:59] apparently from I may be wrong in the
[1:01:02] distance but it was the same casualty
[1:01:04] rate I think it was from Stalingrad to
[1:01:07] Berlin or something
[1:01:08] they lost ten men for virtually every
[1:01:12] meter of ground or something that they
[1:01:14] took or every hundred meters or
[1:01:17] something that was the cost of the life
[1:01:20] for them to overthrow the Nazi regime
[1:01:24] now we're not called to take casualties
[1:01:28] that way he's following me we're called
[1:01:32] but we're not called the sit back and
[1:01:34] let him have his field day he comes at I
[1:01:37] mean but this is the day of his power
[1:01:39] this is the day of his power it has
[1:01:41] never been there has never been the
[1:01:44] power of the gospel as of this day this
[1:01:49] is the strongest the gospel has ever
[1:01:51] been as today
[1:01:53] the power of God has been loosed in a
[1:01:56] greater way today than it ever has been
[1:01:59] amen because the enemy is far greater
[1:02:02] today than he ever has been when the
[1:02:06] enemy comes in like a flood God said
[1:02:08] I'll raise up a standard and that
[1:02:10] standard as his anointing and his people
[1:02:12] that is suspended he's lifted up his
[1:02:15] word hallelujah he's lifted up a
[1:02:18] standard amen the enemy is coming like a
[1:02:21] flood there's a time in revelations
[1:02:23] chapter 9 where two hundred thousand
[1:02:25] thousand demons will leave where we're
[1:02:27] loosed and that is this season that they
[1:02:30] have been loosed so there's more demon
[1:02:32] power upon the earth than there ever has
[1:02:34] been amen but God doesn't leave us amen
[1:02:38] at the you know at the whim of the devil
[1:02:41] what he wants to do his powers always
[1:02:43] greater hallelujah greater that is in
[1:02:46] you that is in the world hallelujah now
[1:02:53] he says now that you may grow thereby
[1:02:57] and if so you have tasted the Lord is
[1:02:59] gracious to whom coming as unto a living
[1:03:02] stone disallowed indeed of men but
[1:03:04] chosen of God and precious ye also as
[1:03:07] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:03:09] house about me a holy priesthood see
[1:03:12] Peter saying you're a priesthood a me to
[1:03:15] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:03:17] to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it
[1:03:20] is contained in the scripture behold I
[1:03:23] lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone electra
[1:03:26] sheis that he that believeth on him
[1:03:28] shall not be confounded that administers
[1:03:30] Jesus Christ himself he he's a chief
[1:03:32] Cornerstone and to you thereby which
[1:03:35] believe he is precious but unto them
[1:03:37] which be disobedient the stone which the
[1:03:39] builders disallowed the same as made the
[1:03:43] head of the corner and a stone of
[1:03:45] stumbling in a rock of offense even to
[1:03:48] them which stumble at the word now this
[1:03:51] is not what I'm majoring on but this is
[1:03:52] what we're eating being disobedient
[1:03:53] whereby also they were appointed but ye
[1:03:57] are a chosen generation a royal
[1:03:59] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[1:04:03] people
[1:04:03] now that word peculiar doesn't mean
[1:04:06] strange
[1:04:07] it means the precious people it doesn't
[1:04:09] actually mean oh these people are but
[1:04:11] weird the world is actually weird
[1:04:14] we have it all the way around the wrong
[1:04:16] way the world is actually the weird ones
[1:04:19] amen the believer is not the weird one
[1:04:23] because this is what God ordained people
[1:04:25] to be right anything that is outside
[1:04:28] what God ordained to beat that's weird
[1:04:32] so now that you should show forth the
[1:04:35] praises of him who hath called you out
[1:04:37] of darkness into his marvelous light
[1:04:39] which in time past you were not a people
[1:04:42] but are now the people of God which had
[1:04:45] not obtained mercy but now have obtained
[1:04:49] mercy hallelujah so now it's like the
[1:04:53] here comes Israel out of Egypt they're a
[1:04:55] bunch of slaves they have no priesthood
[1:04:57] there they have no way of of approach to
[1:05:00] God all they have is a promise from the
[1:05:02] past and then God calls them out of out
[1:05:04] of Egypt and now there has to be God has
[1:05:07] to put his how he wants it to be for
[1:05:11] them to worship Him so God has to take
[1:05:13] her people and he has to change now
[1:05:16] remember the you know the law of the Old
[1:05:18] Testament God talks about how they
[1:05:20] should dress who can marry who who can't
[1:05:24] marry who what they should eat what they
[1:05:27] should do the law covers every part of
[1:05:30] their life because they were in chaos in
[1:05:34] Egypt they were just slaves but now God
[1:05:37] when he speaks his word he takes chaos
[1:05:41] and turns it into order like in Genesis
[1:05:44] 1 darkness covered the world your water
[1:05:46] covered the earth you know it was just
[1:05:49] chaos and then God said let there be
[1:05:51] light and he began to separate light
[1:05:53] from darkness and he brought forth the
[1:05:55] land and he and he and he brought an
[1:05:57] order and when he had finished speaking
[1:05:58] there was an Eden that's what happens
[1:06:01] order comes out of chaos when God speaks
[1:06:04] but when the devil begins to speak order
[1:06:07] turns into chaos it's the other way
[1:06:09] around
[1:06:09] this is why the devil's been speaking in
[1:06:11] these you know since since the fall of
[1:06:14] man the devil has been preaching and his
[1:06:17] preaching caused the fall in the
[1:06:18] beginning through the serpent
[1:06:20] and look at the cows we have out here
[1:06:22] when we have the technology I mean we
[1:06:25] have everything we have need off to
[1:06:27] eradicate most diseases to take away
[1:06:29] famine to bring actually like a kind of
[1:06:32] a mature millenium upon the earth does
[1:06:35] man not have it we have all these things
[1:06:38] but yet the world is in chaos the world
[1:06:41] is falling apart and man seems did sit
[1:06:44] I'm destroying each other and destroying
[1:06:46] the very earth they live on its how does
[1:06:50] so why is that because the devil has
[1:06:53] been speaking and people have been
[1:06:55] listening and this is why we have this
[1:06:58] chaos but now when God speaks and a
[1:07:04] people listen it takes them out of chaos
[1:07:07] and brings them into order only it
[1:07:10] brings him into harmony with him
[1:07:11] that was the reason for the law remember
[1:07:13] under the blood of bulls and goats man
[1:07:15] and God could never become one like we
[1:07:17] are under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:07:19] because the blood of bulls and goats
[1:07:20] could not change a person's nature they
[1:07:23] still had that full of nature I mean
[1:07:26] because they because the life of an
[1:07:27] animal could never come and change a
[1:07:29] person is a different order of life
[1:07:31] that's why God became a man hallelujah
[1:07:33] that he would become our lamb amen that
[1:07:36] his life he shed his blood he took your
[1:07:39] place hallelujah his life was given for
[1:07:42] your life
[1:07:43] I mean freely it was given hallelujah
[1:07:46] and so now but it wasn't that's not the
[1:07:48] final end of it now he dies that his
[1:07:50] life was coming to you that he would
[1:07:52] reconcile you with himself as the
[1:07:55] Apostle Paul says and Corinthians I
[1:07:57] believe it was in the last chapter he
[1:07:58] says we have the Ministry of
[1:08:00] reconciliation I mean that man and God
[1:08:03] that's the reason for the preaching of
[1:08:05] the gospel that God and man would become
[1:08:07] reconciled
[1:08:08] hallelujah that they would have peace
[1:08:10] again and it's not God that's out of
[1:08:12] order
[1:08:13] people are out of order hallelujah and
[1:08:15] that's why God has to come and change
[1:08:17] our nature that in the Davis power we
[1:08:19] become willing hallelujah if there's
[1:08:23] anything in us that's that as fighting
[1:08:25] against his word you should be in prayer
[1:08:27] change my heart change my ways that I
[1:08:30] become reconciled to your word
[1:08:33] we all have to do it that's what a real
[1:08:35] repentance are dying out is is where we
[1:08:38] say Lord changed my heart that I will
[1:08:41] live according to your word that's what
[1:08:44] real salvation is is because once upon a
[1:08:48] time we were doing anything we wanted to
[1:08:50] do we heard about it at camp Ephesians
[1:08:52] chapter 2 we walked according to the
[1:08:54] spirit of this world we did whatever we
[1:08:56] want it it says in Romans not one man
[1:08:58] seeks after God but then he comes and he
[1:09:02] becomes he he comes to draw you because
[1:09:05] he wants to reconcile you with him
[1:09:08] hallelujah that's what he wants to do
[1:09:11] and then so but then because we have a
[1:09:13] free moral agency we have to be willing
[1:09:16] lord take you you have to give it to him
[1:09:19] and say change my heart hallelujah amen
[1:09:23] than anything you have given in your
[1:09:25] word for me to do I'm willing it's just
[1:09:27] like a very simple thing water baptism
[1:09:31] Christine's dead brother Albert it was
[1:09:34] baptized and the titles back in
[1:09:36] Switzerland River it was it comes to New
[1:09:37] Zealand and then God begins to deal with
[1:09:40] them are going to be rebaptised name a
[1:09:41] Lord Jesus Christ but there's a struggle
[1:09:44] going on in his mind but then he comes
[1:09:46] to realize what spirit would stop me
[1:09:48] from fulfilling God's Word and he
[1:09:51] realizes just the demon spirit and then
[1:09:53] when it got baptized hallelujah it
[1:09:55] should be the same thing with anything
[1:09:59] Amen how we act how we dress how things
[1:10:02] we do things we watch whatever it may be
[1:10:04] I don't know this world this world is
[1:10:08] preached to you know what Hollywood is
[1:10:11] you know what all these ungodly things
[1:10:13] are that sermons
[1:10:14] it's sermons goddess because movies are
[1:10:19] more just entertainment they're
[1:10:20] conveying a message and they're actually
[1:10:22] written and made in such a way because
[1:10:24] they want to get a message across and
[1:10:26] they just have a whole bunch of
[1:10:27] Technology and CGI and everything and
[1:10:29] they can make it so amazing and you
[1:10:31] begin to enjoy people enjoy you know the
[1:10:35] film or whatever it is because it's
[1:10:36] entertainment and they open up their
[1:10:38] spirits because they're enjoying it and
[1:10:39] a message slips in' and haw and people's
[1:10:43] thinking and everything they do has been
[1:10:45] changed because there
[1:10:46] sitting listening to a message that's
[1:10:49] what it is Allu you not praise our God
[1:10:54] but I think praise our God because we
[1:10:55] can see these things we should not be
[1:10:57] ignorant to the devil's devices and the
[1:11:00] devil's not stupid I think sometimes we
[1:11:03] well not we should give him credit but
[1:11:05] he's not stupid
[1:11:06] he knows how man works he studies you
[1:11:08] he's been studying he was studying men
[1:11:12] in the garden and he's studying men now
[1:11:14] and the more you study something the
[1:11:17] more you learn and the more you
[1:11:19] understand it he knows all human
[1:11:22] nature's he knows how to war against you
[1:11:26] yes amen and that's why everything's so
[1:11:29] tailor-made amen even even you take now
[1:11:33] this is even like restaurants you know
[1:11:35] you take like McDonald's and so on they
[1:11:37] actually do studies about how they
[1:11:40] should have their lighting how they
[1:11:41] should have they'd be cool how they
[1:11:43] should have their seats how fast the
[1:11:45] food comes how big the portions are
[1:11:47] those things actually have committees
[1:11:49] and plans and they study these things
[1:11:51] they look because it's being refined
[1:11:53] down how can we get the most turnover
[1:11:55] what's the optimum time we want people
[1:11:57] to be in a seat people studied these
[1:12:01] things now that's just food how much
[1:12:04] more the devil wants to take the sons
[1:12:06] and daughters of God because he's
[1:12:08] determined because he knows God can't
[1:12:10] lose a part of himself he knows he saw
[1:12:12] it and the last thing Adam did as a god
[1:12:15] was he joined himself with his wife
[1:12:17] because he knew that the God could not
[1:12:19] destroy him and so God knows
[1:12:22] sorry Satan knows that God cannot lose
[1:12:26] part of himself and if and if Satan can
[1:12:29] get one he's won and that's why he
[1:12:33] fights against you he say I'm going
[1:12:35] through a battle praise the Lord praise
[1:12:37] the Lord I'm going through such a mind
[1:12:40] battle hallelujah
[1:12:41] why is that because the devil is trying
[1:12:43] to weigh you down he's trying to get you
[1:12:45] to surrender put up your white flag
[1:12:48] Amen because you have something that he
[1:12:51] wants and you're not willing to give it
[1:12:53] hallelujah no price can buy it you don't
[1:12:56] want to give yourself to him you've
[1:12:58] given yourself to another
[1:13:00] hallelujah this the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:02] hey man you say well I feel very trapped
[1:13:05] there's a deliverance I mean to set you
[1:13:08] free
[1:13:09] hallelujah just because you got my
[1:13:11] battles don't let the devil make you
[1:13:13] think you're not a believer I have mine
[1:13:15] battles I'm just going to tell you so
[1:13:19] because some people think how can those
[1:13:20] and their Christian didn't know everyone
[1:13:22] has mine battles everyone has struggles
[1:13:24] everyone has Hard Day's if one has
[1:13:27] valleys of hard experience and you're
[1:13:29] wondering Lord where is the way out how
[1:13:33] is this ever going to end up we all have
[1:13:35] it
[1:13:36] amen but then also at the same time if
[1:13:38] he god has allowed you to go through it
[1:13:41] and he leads you through it you'd have
[1:13:43] confidence if your will is surrendered
[1:13:45] to Hennis all you want is this perfect
[1:13:47] world sometimes it's how we go into his
[1:13:51] permissive will and then we end up
[1:13:53] wandering down some garden path and we
[1:13:55] give God credit for leading us there
[1:13:57] it's not always the case
[1:14:00] amen but you got to say and then if you
[1:14:03] find yourself down that way you say Lord
[1:14:04] forgive me get me back on the road
[1:14:07] hallelujah as brother Danny was saying
[1:14:11] you know these things called familiar
[1:14:14] spirits and we become familiar with a
[1:14:17] spirit amen and we shouldn't be and the
[1:14:20] thing is we get used to being a certain
[1:14:22] way that's why we are creatures of habit
[1:14:24] because there's something called the
[1:14:26] familiar spirit and we're familiar with
[1:14:28] it a spirit of a family or maybe our
[1:14:33] workplace or our school or our country
[1:14:36] we use that spirit and we begin to think
[1:14:39] that's us
[1:14:41] that's why they're in Egypt and God
[1:14:45] called them out there because he wants
[1:14:47] to get him to know you're not used you
[1:14:49] don't mean to be familiar with the
[1:14:50] spirits of Egypt you mean to be I want
[1:14:53] you to be familiar with my Spurs so I
[1:14:56] call you out he's called us out and he
[1:14:59] brought them into the wilderness and now
[1:15:01] God shows Moses this is how my
[1:15:04] priesthood is going to be and anyone who
[1:15:07] is dressed
[1:15:08] outside of that way was not a priest
[1:15:11] they could be religious
[1:15:13] they could offer sacrifices they could
[1:15:16] take incense they could do whatever they
[1:15:17] tried to do but God had to dress them
[1:15:21] through the word of a prophet okay now I
[1:15:29] got to see where we are he sees us in
[1:15:36] Hebrews chapter 8 who serve unto the
[1:15:42] example and the shadow of heavenly
[1:15:44] things as Moses was admonished of God
[1:15:47] when he was about to make the tabernacle
[1:15:50] for see saith he that they'll make all
[1:15:53] things according to the pattern showed
[1:15:55] to thee in the Mount so he was
[1:15:57] instructed what you see on the Mount you
[1:15:59] ought to make it upon the earth it's not
[1:16:01] just the tabernacle it's the priesthood
[1:16:02] what's good having the what's good
[1:16:04] having the tabernacle of wilderness
[1:16:06] without people I mean to minister in
[1:16:08] that tabernacle I mean what's the good
[1:16:10] of having the church building
[1:16:11] I mean without having the people it's
[1:16:14] not about the building it's about the
[1:16:15] people
[1:16:16] I mean God doesn't want a you know a
[1:16:18] nice building I mean he wants people
[1:16:20] giving spiritual price sacrifice to him
[1:16:23] hallelujah now but now hath he obtained
[1:16:29] a more excellent ministry by how much
[1:16:32] also he is the mediator of a better
[1:16:34] covenant which was established upon
[1:16:36] better promises for if the first
[1:16:39] covenant had been faultless there should
[1:16:41] have no place being sought for the
[1:16:43] second so he's talking about contrasting
[1:16:45] Moses in Jesus's ministry so he is a
[1:16:48] mediator of a better covenant mediator
[1:16:51] of a better covenant which was
[1:16:52] established upon better promises we have
[1:16:55] better promises than the Old Testament
[1:16:56] they meant we have better promises than
[1:16:59] just a denominational group hallelujah
[1:17:02] we have better promises than just a past
[1:17:03] age he says this for finding fault with
[1:17:13] him he said behold the days come saith
[1:17:18] the Lord I'll make a new covenant with
[1:17:19] the house of Israel with the house of
[1:17:20] Judah not according to the Covenant that
[1:17:23] I made with their fathers in the day
[1:17:24] that
[1:17:24] took them by the hand to lead them to
[1:17:27] lead them out of the land of egypt
[1:17:28] because they continued not with my
[1:17:30] covenant and i regarded them not saith
[1:17:32] the lord for this is the covenant that i
[1:17:33] will make with the house of israel after
[1:17:35] those days saith the lord he's talking
[1:17:37] about you to remember i will put my laws
[1:17:40] in their mind and write them in their
[1:17:43] hearts and I will be to them a god and
[1:17:46] they shall be to me a people this is
[1:17:49] what are you saying this is what I'm
[1:17:50] gonna do I'm going to take my laws my
[1:17:52] word I'm going to put it not just I'm
[1:17:54] gonna put in their mind and I'm gonna
[1:17:56] write it in their hearts hallelujah amen
[1:17:59] and I will be to them a god and they
[1:18:02] shall be to me a people this is what
[1:18:05] he's promising and we are this is where
[1:18:08] we're living that God takes his word
[1:18:11] writes it in your heart takes a table of
[1:18:13] your heart and writes it in there
[1:18:16] because it's like we are like a computer
[1:18:20] a computer has programming it has
[1:18:24] software does it not computerhead
[1:18:26] software and the computer can only
[1:18:28] operate by the one the hardware but then
[1:18:31] to the software to make the hardware go
[1:18:33] there
[1:18:34] hey brother George yeah well you're
[1:18:36] there you're one of the experts here
[1:18:37] you're a software engineer so I see
[1:18:40] shaking here but maybe you're going off
[1:18:41] the wrong way but you have to have the
[1:18:44] right software now you can have the same
[1:18:46] computer but then you can wipe out the
[1:18:48] software give it new software and alap
[1:18:51] right differently it's the same thing
[1:18:53] with God and you know we are actually
[1:18:56] just one big battery we're organic
[1:18:58] battery do you not know anyway we won't
[1:19:02] do you not know that maybe I'll share a
[1:19:05] few diagrams I'll show you how the cell
[1:19:06] works where one big battery anyway but
[1:19:11] God takes us we were born with the wrong
[1:19:14] programming because we're born in a
[1:19:16] fallen nature the devil by the Fallen
[1:19:19] Eden gave us the wrong programming and
[1:19:21] that's why you have killing in your
[1:19:23] blood sugar of hatred and malice and
[1:19:25] strife and envy and selfishness and
[1:19:27] pride because that's his programming but
[1:19:31] then God has to come and he's got a he's
[1:19:34] got a more than just he's got a totally
[1:19:36] erratic
[1:19:36] hey I'm in the programming and he's got
[1:19:40] to rewrite your life he's going to give
[1:19:42] you a new programming that you begin to
[1:19:44] operate a different way not the same way
[1:19:46] as you Winston
[1:19:47] hallelujah how can you operate Amen if
[1:19:51] you say I've been rewritten how can you
[1:19:53] operate the old way I mean because
[1:19:56] you're programming you know I may have
[1:19:58] said this many times I don't have to
[1:20:01] avoid being trapped in the world I don't
[1:20:04] have to avoid video games and movies and
[1:20:06] rock and roll music and drinking and the
[1:20:09] pubs and whatever more I don't have to
[1:20:12] say Lord don't let me get near those
[1:20:14] places Kirby dragged in
[1:20:16] my programming has been changed my
[1:20:19] perfect everything says hallelujah and
[1:20:22] it's not just an update it's a total
[1:20:24] revamp hallelujah hallelujah ami we've
[1:20:28] been rebooted worried you gotta be
[1:20:31] rebooted hallelujah if you haven't been
[1:20:33] rebooted say God reboot me reinstall my
[1:20:36] life hallelujah that's because he says
[1:20:40] I'll take my word I'll write it in your
[1:20:43] heart that's your operating system I'll
[1:20:45] take my operating system and I write it
[1:20:47] in you and you'll be my people
[1:20:50] amen and I'll be your God hallelujah
[1:20:53] that's how it's got to be I mean so now
[1:20:56] that was that was there that was there
[1:20:59] in the Old Testament now we're coming to
[1:21:02] Jesus ministry and now it changes is
[1:21:05] happening they are under the law but now
[1:21:08] as a dispensational change we're now
[1:21:10] here comes grace and then now Jesus
[1:21:14] comes the lamb comes he's been given his
[1:21:17] spirit now has been real released upon
[1:21:19] the people and then now the Apostle Paul
[1:21:22] says in a few places a dispensation of
[1:21:24] the gospel has been given to me so God
[1:21:28] has now taken a man he takes him out
[1:21:30] into Arabia different place he says in
[1:21:33] Galatians I went into Arabia after I
[1:21:35] meet the Lord on the road to Damascus
[1:21:36] and he began to look into the Old
[1:21:38] Testament to see who was this being that
[1:21:40] I met on the road and he began to find
[1:21:42] out the same God that met Moses had met
[1:21:44] him and then God begins to anoint him to
[1:21:48] write most of the Newton
[1:21:50] estimate but they notice what he goes
[1:21:52] through he so first he he shows us just
[1:21:55] like Moses he says the Lord thy God is
[1:21:58] one you know he begins to show the deity
[1:22:00] of God and then he goes into how and
[1:22:03] then you read a lot of his writings how
[1:22:05] we should dress how parents should be
[1:22:08] how children should be we should abstain
[1:22:12] from fornication and and you know or
[1:22:14] adultery or all those things he he late
[1:22:17] and he goes down to every part of the
[1:22:18] life this is how the family should be
[1:22:20] and you would think being a Jew you'd
[1:22:22] say but we had all these things under
[1:22:25] Moses but what God now God was turning a
[1:22:27] corner it was a new dispensation and a
[1:22:30] lot of them had to one come out of out
[1:22:33] of old religion but it was all the
[1:22:35] Gentiles had to come out from their
[1:22:36] idols just like coming out of Egypt they
[1:22:39] had to forsake their idols they were
[1:22:41] called out of Egypt but now they had to
[1:22:43] go into Christ so that's why the Apostle
[1:22:45] Paul under this dispensation he says now
[1:22:47] he he he says this other family should
[1:22:50] be are you following me because he's
[1:22:52] saying it's not just a priesthood of a
[1:22:53] men that's now the whole congregation's
[1:22:56] our priesthood hallelujah so now
[1:22:58] everyone has to be dressed everyone has
[1:23:01] to be spiritually dressed I mean by the
[1:23:03] word that was delivered to that prophet
[1:23:06] hallelujah because remember you'd say
[1:23:08] well well that seems a lot less greater
[1:23:12] than what happened in the Old Testament
[1:23:13] no it's greater what is greater you say
[1:23:16] Moses Moses you know putting after he's
[1:23:19] seen the vision on the mountain and he
[1:23:21] and he puts together the Tabernacle in
[1:23:23] the wilderness and they have the
[1:23:25] priesthood and they and they apply the
[1:23:27] blood and all different things than the
[1:23:28] glory of the Lord fills the tabernacle
[1:23:30] now that would have been an amazing
[1:23:32] thing and then that was repeated again
[1:23:34] when Solomon built the temple but was
[1:23:36] that greater or was it greater than they
[1:23:38] have Pentecost I mean where there was a
[1:23:40] hundred and twenty people 120 priests I
[1:23:44] mean I mean they've been under the
[1:23:46] Ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:23:47] maybe the Ministry of Jesus Christ was
[1:23:49] continued through the Apostles are you
[1:23:52] all following me I pray you really are I
[1:23:54] mean so now what's greater that happens
[1:23:57] what happened in Solomon's Temple or
[1:23:59] what happened on the day of Pentecost I
[1:24:00] say it was great
[1:24:02] what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:24:03] with the same God that we'd down to the
[1:24:05] holy of holies now came in 12th and 120
[1:24:08] people that's a flag greater glory
[1:24:11] hallelujah so he begins to tell the
[1:24:13] people this is how you should be this is
[1:24:15] how you should trace this is how you
[1:24:17] should treat each other because they've
[1:24:19] been in chaos now they're coming into
[1:24:21] order and he says if any man is
[1:24:23] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:24:26] things I teach of the commandments of
[1:24:27] the Lord amen she had to be willing to
[1:24:31] receive that word receive that
[1:24:33] instruction I don't want to be a half
[1:24:36] dressed priest and if you look in the
[1:24:39] scripture if you continue to read an
[1:24:42] exodus they were anointed and then they
[1:24:44] were dressed amen you can't just be a
[1:24:49] half dressed priest you ought to be
[1:24:51] fully dressed by this word you're
[1:24:53] following me and be fully dressed and
[1:24:55] then so now it came in order but then
[1:24:58] what happened as people then but then
[1:25:03] the enemy start to come into the church
[1:25:05] and formalism came in and creeds of men
[1:25:09] came in and then finally they came into
[1:25:11] a chaos of a dark age that was cast
[1:25:14] because the devil was speaking and now
[1:25:16] they're in chaos but then God said I
[1:25:18] will restore and God called out Luther
[1:25:22] but they came out with a lot of chaos
[1:25:24] but they had a little bit of water
[1:25:26] because I just shall live by faith and
[1:25:27] then Wesley came and there's all
[1:25:29] different parts of the Reformation as he
[1:25:31] as the bright tree was regrowing
[1:25:33] hallelujah but they still had a lot of
[1:25:35] chaos because they had a lot of
[1:25:37] denomination man's ideas but here we are
[1:25:41] in the end here we are on the end now
[1:25:44] this is why I said I was going to go
[1:25:45] Moses I'm going Paul and I'm coming down
[1:25:48] to this age because what's good just
[1:25:50] talking about history and this is really
[1:25:52] real really want to get to in this
[1:25:54] message it is so now here comes God says
[1:25:57] behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet
[1:25:59] before the Great and dreadful day of the
[1:26:01] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:26:03] children to the father's that you're
[1:26:04] part of the scripture to be fulfilled I
[1:26:06] mean so he will preach a word hallelujah
[1:26:09] he says that I think in the church age
[1:26:11] book is those divine mystery truths will
[1:26:14] literally
[1:26:15] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:26:18] father's amen so you say well I don't
[1:26:20] understand it but there's an anointing
[1:26:22] there's a Spirit of God coming through
[1:26:24] the word and it causes you you'll have
[1:26:26] to be turned hallelujah well yet Peter
[1:26:29] spake these words the Spirit of God fell
[1:26:30] upon them I mean and they were bunches
[1:26:33] living under the law a former age and
[1:26:36] then they found themselves in the
[1:26:37] current age hallelujah was malicious
[1:26:39] blood of bulls and goats but the very
[1:26:41] Messiah had come
[1:26:42] hallelujah now he is living in them
[1:26:45] hallelujah and so now he says oh I'll
[1:26:48] send you Elijah the Prophet he's been
[1:26:50] seen but why was he sent to cool the
[1:26:53] people out of chaos and bring them into
[1:26:56] order that they can be spiritual priests
[1:26:58] and kings unto our God that's why his
[1:27:01] ministry was safe it's not just a know
[1:27:03] some more stuff or or or quote a man a
[1:27:06] man who said God would come and it was
[1:27:08] God speaking by the way I mean I
[1:27:10] wouldn't put myself above a prophet by
[1:27:12] trying to say is this a Moses him or is
[1:27:14] this his idea is this God I'd say Lord
[1:27:17] there's enough as I've said it before
[1:27:20] God's character and his life has
[1:27:23] preached through those servants amen and
[1:27:26] what God loves and what he hates has
[1:27:28] ministered through those servants a
[1:27:30] prophet a man has a perfect balance in
[1:27:33] the scripture
[1:27:34] it's not his leaning this way or this
[1:27:37] way I mean when a prophet is perfectly
[1:27:39] balanced where God would come down and
[1:27:41] use that vessel I mean the Apostle Paul
[1:27:44] wasn't leaning one way amen that was
[1:27:46] God's perfect balance when he wrote thee
[1:27:48] when he when he preached and when he
[1:27:51] wrote the New Testament there wasn't his
[1:27:52] idea
[1:27:53] I mean people call him a woman-hater all
[1:27:56] different kinds of things he wasn't a
[1:27:57] woman-hater that was God this is this is
[1:28:01] God making himself known and the people
[1:28:03] that received that word they were
[1:28:05] dressed they were placed in a priesthood
[1:28:08] hallelujah Amen that's the same thing in
[1:28:11] our day it was chaos so many loose ends
[1:28:14] the part of the Ministry of Malachi
[1:28:16] fools take all the loose ends that the
[1:28:18] Reformers were proving it is that this
[1:28:20] in the Bible is of this in the Bible
[1:28:22] what are the seals mean what is all this
[1:28:24] and all this and then God says I'll show
[1:28:26] you
[1:28:27] hallelujah as he three is he five is he
[1:28:30] to z1 I'll show you he's one
[1:28:32] he is manifests himself in different
[1:28:33] ways hallelujah all the difference so
[1:28:36] we're being called out of chaos but now
[1:28:39] we have to come into order
[1:28:41] I'm gonna read this let's just I don't
[1:28:46] have this on my notes malicious go to
[1:28:48] Luke 17 this is very familiar scripture
[1:28:53] but we have more we have more than
[1:28:58] religion you notice there yeah you who
[1:29:02] are there on Sunday Sunday night that
[1:29:04] wasn't the music working people up that
[1:29:07] wasn't the that was God coming down that
[1:29:10] was God coming down and God made every
[1:29:13] every need it wasn't a bunch of work up
[1:29:16] by people I mean he didn't even need to
[1:29:18] say you know unlike Priya it was like
[1:29:20] here what a bust Ana barricaded and
[1:29:22] jumpin hallelujah cuz God was calling
[1:29:26] hallelujah and you won't find it I don't
[1:29:29] believe you won't find that anywhere
[1:29:30] else
[1:29:31] you can search YouTube you'll end up
[1:29:34] disappointed I mean we don't need a
[1:29:36] bunch of lights and a bunch of dark and
[1:29:38] a bunch of loud stuff and you know it's
[1:29:40] God comes that's that old time religion
[1:29:44] hallelujah and it was good for them I'll
[1:29:47] take what worked hey if it if it took
[1:29:50] Elijah Anna and a chariot of fire
[1:29:52] hallelujah but if it you know ever
[1:29:56] brought Jesus out of the grave even if
[1:29:58] it filled the Apostles filled the
[1:30:00] disciples on day of Pentecost if it gave
[1:30:03] them over Cameron power if it works
[1:30:05] hey you know hasn't been tested it's
[1:30:07] been tested hasn't been proven that's
[1:30:10] been proven I'll take it there
[1:30:12] hallelujah amen it's like if they had
[1:30:15] like Google you know people can write
[1:30:17] stuff and be all five stars and I think
[1:30:20] maybe I'll just be testimonies and then
[1:30:22] it works amen now we're a yes so Luke 17
[1:30:32] and we'll just read we're just going to
[1:30:34] read verse 30 but if you read it before
[1:30:37] and after
[1:30:38] it's speaking Jesus's
[1:30:40] what its gonna be like at the end and it
[1:30:47] speaks in the days of nor in the days of
[1:30:48] lot and we can see that that is here
[1:30:51] this is in verse 30 even thou shalt be
[1:30:54] in the day when the Son of Man is
[1:30:56] revealed that's when God has revealed
[1:30:58] again the Son of Man is Jesus Christ so
[1:31:01] when you see the world of the condition
[1:31:02] at son he will be revealed he will be
[1:31:06] revealed now that is more than a
[1:31:09] prophetic gift but that is his word
[1:31:12] being seen him declaring himself so the
[1:31:16] same God that met Moses on the Mount
[1:31:18] Sinai was the same God that was that
[1:31:23] same God had a body he dwelt in it they
[1:31:28] meant that's Jesus Christ and that same
[1:31:30] God was there in the upper room and the
[1:31:33] same God has been walking through the
[1:31:35] church ages and the same God is here
[1:31:38] hallelujah the very same one and so nice
[1:31:41] is even that shall be when the Son of
[1:31:44] Man is revealed now the revealing of the
[1:31:47] Son of Man is Jesus Christ being made
[1:31:48] known again this has happened I know you
[1:31:52] say well we all believe all these things
[1:31:54] but I wanted to enter down a little bit
[1:31:56] more because you've got to look at now
[1:31:58] why did God do this to call the people
[1:32:01] out of chaos bring them into order with
[1:32:04] himself that they will be dressed to be
[1:32:08] in a priesthood and that's all of us man
[1:32:11] woman boy girl old young we we all have
[1:32:14] a part of this ministry now this is all
[1:32:20] years no way I have the English here
[1:32:22] I'll read the English there's the
[1:32:23] Spanish okay so this is an event made
[1:32:27] clear by prophecy this is the end of the
[1:32:30] service there's a 1965 Oh God Jesus
[1:32:33] manifested god of the word you see it as
[1:32:37] it was the days of Sodom the word the
[1:32:40] world would be in that condition just
[1:32:42] before the destruction of the Gentile
[1:32:44] world this is where we're living the
[1:32:46] Gentile dispensation here we are
[1:32:48] sodomites to the core speaking of this
[1:32:50] world then you see that the son of man
[1:32:52] which has always referred
[1:32:54] - as a profit would be revealed in that
[1:32:56] our fulfill my words our God we you're
[1:33:01] believing children wait with sincere
[1:33:03] hearts to give us faith Lord that when
[1:33:05] we have the prayer line the people will
[1:33:07] believe that it's the evening time
[1:33:09] father that the evening lights of the
[1:33:11] Son of God he that was which is and
[1:33:14] shall come manifest himself by the
[1:33:16] prophecy that he made and Jesus Christ
[1:33:19] name Amen
[1:33:24] would you know this is just a little bit
[1:33:27] doubted just after that priests is would
[1:33:29] you believe if God would manifest
[1:33:32] himself ensure that he is here alive
[1:33:34] doing the same things that he did at the
[1:33:36] beginning after this message would you
[1:33:38] accept it as your healing may God grant
[1:33:41] it now I'm asking anybody in the house
[1:33:43] no matter who you are where you're from
[1:33:45] I'm asking you just to solemnly believe
[1:33:48] this message to be the truth that is the
[1:33:51] message that God has in his Bible for
[1:33:53] this hour that Jesus Christ is here
[1:33:55] tonight and as alive he says now nearly
[1:34:01] now nearly and then just down a bit he
[1:34:03] says you believe it a lady sitting here
[1:34:06] before me now says remember God when
[1:34:09] Jesus was here in flesh he knew the
[1:34:11] thoughts of the people in you everything
[1:34:13] about them that same ministry is
[1:34:16] repeated again in this last day the
[1:34:18] ministry happened there amen
[1:34:20] that a people would be called out of
[1:34:22] chaos to come into a priesthood why I
[1:34:25] would and this is repeated again in this
[1:34:27] last day he says you believe it

[1:37:04] sitting there praying you're back
[1:37:06] trouble is healed now Jesus Christ makes
[1:37:09] you well now why don't I take the time
[1:37:12] to read that out because it's the same
[1:37:14] ministry that Jesus Christ had it would
[1:37:18] return through a prophet but it was all
[1:37:21] done that you would know here comes God
[1:37:24] has come in this end time to call the
[1:37:26] people out of chaos
[1:37:28] I mean that they would come to order
[1:37:29] they would come under order to him
[1:37:33] hallelujah so now here comes a prophet
[1:37:36] now I'm just gonna I'm just going to sum
[1:37:38] it up Moses went up a mountain he
[1:37:41] received a word and through that word he
[1:37:44] dressed a priesthood that they could
[1:37:46] operate as a priesthood and then here
[1:37:48] comes Jesus and his ministry continues
[1:37:50] through the Apostles hallelujah and then
[1:37:53] Paul now writes most of the New
[1:37:54] Testament and he receives a word and in
[1:37:57] an order of priesthood will be dressed
[1:38:00] amen this is not far-fetched go go read
[1:38:03] the scripture Alleluia he he receives
[1:38:07] the word and it covers every part of the
[1:38:09] people's lives amen because there's a
[1:38:12] change of dispensation right then if
[1:38:15] people would know how to live how to
[1:38:16] treat each other you know and what to do
[1:38:19] because God wants them dressed that they
[1:38:23] would be in a priesthood them have come
[1:38:25] through a Dark Age we're in chaos now in
[1:38:28] order God sends Malachi for upon the
[1:38:30] earth amen and he receives the word
[1:38:33] which is the same revelation that the
[1:38:35] Apostle Paul received a meant that all
[1:38:38] of man's chaos would be done away with
[1:38:39] that a people had come into order
[1:38:42] then that would be put into a priesthood
[1:38:44] but you have to receive it all to be
[1:38:48] dressed have you basically that's it you
[1:38:54] got to receive the whole word well that
[1:38:56] was it him or was it God just take it he
