[44:43] this further part of the service Lord
[44:45] Under Your Divine control Lord we need
[44:47] you to take over so we surrender
[44:48] ourselves Lord and may you anoint
[44:50] speaker and hear him may you anoint our
[44:52] faith oh God lord to receive and believe
[44:54] your word and to act upon it dear God
[44:56] may he change our Lives May you may you
[44:59] do what we think is impossible Lord may
[45:01] you come and do the impossible because
[45:02] you're the god of the impossible Lord so
[45:04] Lord we want to commit Our Lives into
[45:06] your hands may be with those who
[45:07] couldn't be here today Lord May bless
[45:09] all of us oh God in Heavenly places in
[45:11] you in Jesus Christ's name we commit the
[45:13] service and the day into your hands amen
[45:16] amen God bless you friends uh you may
[45:18] have your seats this morning I want to
[45:20] speak about getting out of your comfort
[45:21] zone getting out of the safety place
[45:23] because a safe place is not actually the
[45:26] only safe place is Christ right but
[45:28] people get into a you know oh it's safe
[45:30] to stay where I am in the Lord that's
[45:32] not safety that's actually death so we
[45:34] want to keep we we want to keep walking
[45:36] with God you know our walk is not a
[45:38] standing still we're walking we're
[45:40] moving you know there's movement there's
[45:41] change going on as we read there you
[45:43] know we've got to go with you know you
[45:45] know the Apostle Paul as he's he's
[45:47] written to the Hebrews here and and you
[45:49] know he comes down to the last chapter
[45:50] he says now let us go therefore uh unto
[45:53] him without the camp so he's telling
[45:54] them you've got to move from where you
[45:55] are you know because he contrasts in the
[45:57] book of Hebrews he contrasts the blood
[45:59] of bulls and goats with the blood of
[46:00] Jesus Christ and you know how Aaron was
[46:03] the high priest and they had a natural
[46:04] lineage of high priest but then Christ
[46:06] is our high priest forevermore and so
[46:08] he's contrasting these things he's now
[46:10] he's telling them listen you've got to
[46:11] go beyond your Camp amen you've got to
[46:13] go without of your Camp you gotta you
[46:15] gotta leave the place that you're
[46:16] dwelling in spiritually and go without
[46:18] the camp I mean because a camp here if
[46:21] you look at the definition it means an
[46:22] encampment it's a it's a camp of Israel
[46:25] in the desert amen it's a city it's a
[46:27] it's a um
[46:29] assembly you know a a uh sacred
[46:32] congregation it's a Barracks of Roman
[46:34] soldiers or it's an Army in the line of
[46:36] battle now if you'll look at all those
[46:38] things they're all things that are set
[46:39] up and you've got to keep the status quo
[46:41] of where where you are so an Army in the
[46:43] line of battle you've got to keep
[46:44] formation but you know the Lord is
[46:46] saying go beyond the formation of your
[46:48] life and the formation of what people do
[46:50] and the formation of your past you've
[46:52] got to go beyond those things you know
[46:54] you've got to go beyond the encampment
[46:55] of your comfort zone you know this is
[46:57] this is a faith Walk we're walking in
[46:59] you know this is not a standing still
[47:01] you know the Bible says the footsteps of
[47:03] the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[47:04] but in order for your footsteps to be
[47:06] ordered you've got to be making
[47:07] footsteps you've got to move moving in a
[47:09] direction and we know that we're not
[47:10] guessing in the direction we're going
[47:12] because we have the revealed word of God
[47:13] in this day I mean so we're not guessing
[47:15] which way how to please God what we
[47:17] should do no we know the way we should
[47:19] go right amen so we're not guessing but
[47:21] we're not called to stand still you know
[47:23] we're not just called to be raised in
[47:25] the message be part of a church you know
[47:27] and that's it you've got to go beyond
[47:29] the camp of well I've been raised in the
[47:31] message you've got to go well beyond
[47:32] that I mean you're going to go with
[47:34] beyond that to a supernatural experience
[47:36] where you know you've met God you know
[47:38] our God doesn't leave us in a guessing
[47:39] game of am I going to heaven am I going
[47:41] to Rapture and am I not no he wants you
[47:43] to be double sure that you know amen
[47:45] because when he died on Calvary he said
[47:47] it is finished right so the sin question
[47:49] in his mind is done but is it settled in
[47:51] your mind that he did it for you amen he
[47:53] wants to answer that question amen so
[47:55] we're not called just to come to church
[47:57] and be part of a church we'll miss
[47:59] everything if we just do that but we
[48:01] must go beyond the camp of being part of
[48:03] a church and being part of a church
[48:04] culture and go unto him amen and have a
[48:06] real experience with him you know some
[48:09] people come in and they say you know you
[48:11] know and all they want to know is what
[48:13] do I need to do just tell me how to
[48:15] dress tell me what's expected of me you
[48:17] know tell me a do's and don'ts list and
[48:19] then that's it that's not walking with
[48:21] God that's just conforming to a set of
[48:23] rules God doesn't want us to conform to
[48:25] a set of human rules he wants us to walk
[48:27] according to his word and love him I
[48:30] mean so we can't just cabbage down on a
[48:32] on some past idea of a comfort zone
[48:34] we're going to go beyond the camp even
[48:36] even if we've already had a supernatural
[48:38] touch from God he's changed our lives
[48:40] we're to keep walking with him don't
[48:43] stand still don't just keep looking back
[48:44] remember Christianity is not a rear view
[48:46] mirror kind of a drive right if you look
[48:48] in your rearview mirror and you're
[48:49] driving you're going to hit something
[48:51] you're going to crash into something
[48:52] that if you're looking forward you would
[48:54] have seen it but if you're looking back
[48:55] you're going to hit it amen so we're not
[48:57] looking back we're looking for him I
[48:59] mean God has so many promises in his
[49:01] word that are lying right now that
[49:02] you've got to be looking forward for
[49:03] them to be fulfilled so he must go
[49:06] beyond the camp of our comfort zone we
[49:08] must go beyond God is calling us to go
[49:10] beyond that to him amen he wants to walk
[49:12] with us in a supernatural walk in a far
[49:14] greater way than we've experienced thus
[49:16] far amen because this is not a plateau
[49:18] we're not walking on a level piece of
[49:20] ground we're marching to Zion we're
[49:22] marching onwards and upwards amen sure
[49:24] there may be valleys and hard places to
[49:26] go through but as long as your
[49:27] trajectory is this way as long as the
[49:29] graph is trending upwards that's a good
[49:31] walk with God Amen so we must always be
[49:34] looking forward you know Enoch Enoch
[49:37] walked with God the Bible said he did
[49:39] not just stand still amen amen he did
[49:42] not just stand this you know but he kept
[49:44] walking with God amen amen so you know
[49:46] because we're not saved by a checklist
[49:49] like I said some people they just want
[49:51] to know the do's and don'ts and
[49:52] therefore I'm in no we're not saved by a
[49:54] checklist you know we are not saved by a
[49:56] measuring stick as the prophet would say
[49:58] we are saved by the grace of God Amen to
[50:01] us not by a measuring stick we're going
[50:03] to take a Rapture it's by God's grace
[50:04] calling us and leading us and US
[50:07] surrendering to his grace he's going to
[50:09] take us all the way through amen so
[50:11] we're not safe by a measuring sticker or
[50:13] a list of do's and don'ts no it's a walk
[50:15] with God you know it's amazing you know
[50:17] you know you think about when you look
[50:18] at the Believers all the way down
[50:19] Through the Ages God always called them
[50:22] to step out of their safety zone
[50:24] as uh as as Brother Andy was um
[50:27] preaching on Wednesday you know about
[50:28] how you know you know how I think as
[50:30] Ezekiel Saw The Vision how how he walked
[50:32] into the river it was ankle deep and
[50:34] went deeper and deeper and deeper you
[50:35] know but there's a walk out into when
[50:37] we're now swimming Waters yeah we're not
[50:39] just called to stand the shallow things
[50:40] of God but to go deeper into the
[50:42] fullness of him amen amen but now every
[50:44] believer as has has been called really
[50:46] to step out and walk into impossible
[50:48] situations you know like Peter on the
[50:51] boat there with the disciples there's a
[50:52] storm they're afraid Jesus comes walking
[50:54] on the water and you know Jesus calls
[50:56] him to come walk with him
[50:58] it's impossible to walk on water
[51:01] physics will tell you it won't work I
[51:04] mean who's who's ever sunk to a bottom
[51:05] of a swimming pool or a spa you're just
[51:07] struggling to swim all right
[51:09] yep you know but he walked on water he
[51:12] didn't drown at first amen because he
[51:13] kept looking at the Lord but so God will
[51:15] always cause us to walk into the
[51:17] impossible but if faith is anchored in
[51:20] the heart you can walk in that place
[51:21] amen like like it says in Hebrews 11
[51:23] verse 8 by faith Abraham when he was
[51:26] called to go out into a place where he
[51:28] should after receive an inheritance
[51:30] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[51:32] whether he went isn't that incredible
[51:34] God doesn't see many of us expect God's
[51:36] going to give us a timeline he's going
[51:38] to give us details he's going to show us
[51:40] exactly where when how why what all
[51:43] those things right but God doesn't give
[51:45] us those things right we walk in faith
[51:47] and then he shows us as we're walking
[51:49] but you've got to obey the call of the
[51:52] Walk amen he wants to walk with you this
[51:54] morning amen we sing a song Walk With Me
[51:56] Jesus walk with me but rarely he wants
[51:58] you to walk with her more than you want
[51:59] to walk with him amen so you know can
[52:02] you imagine if we go back to Abraham's
[52:04] house you know after God said leave this
[52:06] land I'll show you a place you're going
[52:07] to go maybe you're Abraham's neighbor
[52:09] you've known him for years you're known
[52:11] as parents for years but but one morning
[52:13] you wake up early to the sound of a
[52:15] people packing up and unloading and you
[52:17] know you're unpacking the house there's
[52:19] a moving truck turns up and you know you
[52:21] get up you look over the fence you see
[52:23] Abraham's carrying boxes and loading his
[52:25] camels and you know and you think
[52:26] Abraham what's going on you know what
[52:28] are you doing and and and he'd say God
[52:30] spoke to me last night all right well
[52:32] what did God say God says I have to
[52:34] leave so I'm leaving he put his faith
[52:37] into action all right and then and then
[52:39] you know maybe you'd say well where are
[52:40] you going yeah and Abraham would say
[52:42] actually I don't know
[52:44] I don't know where I'm going but God
[52:46] called me to leave so I'm leaving
[52:48] um uh what kind of Are You Gonna pack
[52:50] you know you're going to go into
[52:51] mountainous country is going to be snowy
[52:53] is going to be hot you know what kind of
[52:54] clothes you're packing I don't know I
[52:56] actually don't know where I'm going I
[52:57] have no idea and then and then you think
[52:59] Abraham what kind of God called you
[53:02] all right you know he sure he doesn't
[53:03] have a real hot kind of a curry and a
[53:06] rich dessert you had some crazy dream in
[53:08] the night and you know he said no no yo
[53:10] what kind of God called you your
[53:11] imagination no no who the creator of
[53:13] heavens and earth called me see the
[53:16] thing is it looked ridiculous to the
[53:17] neighbor but the neighbor didn't have
[53:19] the Revelation see Abraham had the
[53:21] Revelation and therefore he could walk
[53:23] in that Revelation and he knew if
[53:24] Jehovah God who made all things called
[53:26] him that same God can look after him
[53:28] every step of the journey and it should
[53:30] be the same thing with you and I friends
[53:32] that we should have such a confidence in
[53:34] God that God can lead us in every
[53:36] situation you may not know how you may
[53:39] not know when there may not be a time
[53:41] scale but with God that's irrelevant he
[53:43] wants you to walk in faith see many
[53:46] people want it all laid out before them
[53:48] but that's not Faith that's not a faith
[53:50] walk that's walking by a facts that's a
[53:52] carnal Man how he walks but we're
[53:54] spiritual people this morning
[53:56] amen hallelujah
[53:59] amen he will take care of us every step
[54:01] of the way he has not called us to leave
[54:03] us he will not abandon us on the side of
[54:05] the road amen but we're walking all the
[54:07] way up into glory and he's going to
[54:08] ensure that we get there
[54:12] Hallelujah
[54:13] amen now it says it says in Hebrews 6
[54:17] and 1 the Apostle Paul is uh speaking
[54:20] about how we've got to leave a certain
[54:22] place and go to a deeper part of God now
[54:25] it says therefore leaving the principles
[54:27] of the doctrine of Christ let us go on
[54:30] unto Perfection not laying again the
[54:32] foundation of repentance from dead works
[54:34] and of Faith towards god of the doctrine
[54:36] of baptisms of the laying on of hands of
[54:38] the resurrection of the dead and of
[54:40] Eternal judgment
[54:41] and this and this will we do of God
[54:44] permits now all of those things
[54:45] basically encapsulate all of the
[54:47] Christian faith
[54:48] there's repentance you know
[54:51] repentance from dead works and Faith
[54:53] towards God what does that repent be
[54:54] baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ you
[54:56] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[54:57] doctrine of baptisms water baptism right
[54:59] laying out of hands that's Divine
[55:01] Healing resurrection of the dead that's
[55:03] talking about you know the you know and
[55:05] you know end of Eternal judgment but he
[55:06] says we're going to go beyond this we
[55:09] can't just have this Foundation it can
[55:10] become a comfort zone
[55:12] you know many people come into the
[55:13] message they think all it is is God send
[55:15] a profit long hair long skirts long
[55:17] faces one God baptism in Jesus Christ's
[55:20] name that's not what it is at all as
[55:22] Jesus Christ revealed today he wants to
[55:23] live in you he wants to take this
[55:25] printed word and manifest it in your
[55:27] lives that's what the message is the
[55:28] message is declaring Christ is here to
[55:30] fulfill his word amen so weak so we're
[55:33] going to just go beyond just those
[55:34] things and go into the fullness of
[55:36] Christ see Paul is calling him let's not
[55:38] lay a foundation again the foundation's
[55:40] been laid but we're not neglecting a
[55:42] foundation because any decent Builder
[55:44] doesn't build a foundation when he's
[55:46] building a house leave that foundation
[55:48] and build the house somewhere else he
[55:49] builds the house exactly where he's laid
[55:51] the foundation right so you don't you
[55:53] don't abandon the foundation you build
[55:55] on that Foundation amen and we are a
[55:58] holy habitation unto the Lord Jesus
[55:59] Christ himself amen so when I say these
[56:02] things some people think well you're
[56:03] just neglecting the basics though
[56:05] actually with God there's no Basics it's
[56:07] all deep
[56:08] even basic things of baptism it's deep
[56:11] yeah right laying on of hands that's
[56:13] deep amen resurrection of the Dead
[56:16] Eternal judgment those things are deep
[56:17] things but it depends how much you let
[56:19] God show you the depth of it
[56:21] yeah amen like I remember during our
[56:23] first lockdown before the first lockdown
[56:25] there was uh when I was at work there
[56:26] was a people were uh just had all these
[56:29] old books that they were just giving
[56:30] away and I picked up a book there that I
[56:33] read in my uh when I was about 10. I
[56:36] read about eight times the whole series
[56:37] and I thought I'm going to read this
[56:39] again and I read it and it was exactly
[56:42] the same as I remembered it nothing was
[56:44] added nothing was greater nothing it was
[56:46] just the same book
[56:48] but then when I pick up and and to me
[56:50] that showed me one thing this is not a
[56:51] normal book
[56:52] this is this is the word of God because
[56:55] you read it once you get something you
[56:57] read it again you get something else you
[56:59] read it again you get something more you
[57:01] read it again you get something more I
[57:02] could do that until the Rapture I could
[57:04] say that same phrase because it's true
[57:06] right because this is God's infallible
[57:08] word it is God and print form it's more
[57:10] than a novel more than a nice idea it is
[57:12] God in print form amen so you know it so
[57:15] so any like as I say there's nothing
[57:17] really basic with God you just let God
[57:19] reveal more of the depth of it and and
[57:22] he'll build the house
[57:24] Hallelujah so we need to go beyond the
[57:26] camp
[57:27] and go unto Perfection we need to go
[57:30] beyond the camp of where we are and go
[57:32] on and that Perfection we know is not a
[57:34] sinless Perfection because by one
[57:36] offering he has perfected them forever
[57:37] that has Sanctified the Bible says so
[57:39] that by that Perfection means a maturity
[57:41] it means growing up into a full full
[57:44] adult in the faith right amen he was
[57:46] also saying Hebrews if you know down
[57:48] that same chapter in verse 12 being be
[57:51] ye not slothful but followers of them
[57:53] who through faith and patience inherited
[57:56] the promises and that word followers
[57:58] means to be in uh you gotta um
[58:01] me and my dyslexia I can't read it but
[58:03] you gotta um
[58:05] I can't read it I've read it anyway
[58:07] you've got to basically copy what they
[58:08] do yeah
[58:10] there we go that's exactly what I just
[58:12] eat anyway you got to copy what they do
[58:13] but we're not actors right but if the
[58:16] same life that was in them comes into
[58:17] you you are copying what they do because
[58:20] the same life that was there will
[58:21] manifest in the same way in you it'll be
[58:23] a faith walk as as Paul would say in
[58:25] Romans 4 and 12 and the father of
[58:27] circumcision speaking of Abraham to them
[58:30] who are not of the circumcision only but
[58:32] who also walk in the steps of that Faith
[58:34] of Our Father Abraham which he had being
[58:37] yet uncircumcised so there's so those
[58:39] who also walk in the steps of that faith
[58:42] that our Father Abraham had remember if
[58:44] he is the father of the faith then we'll
[58:46] walk in the same way if we're the
[58:47] children of that Faith Hallelujah so now
[58:50] God wants us to walk he doesn't want us
[58:52] just to stand still amen so there's a
[58:54] faith walk that we must walk we know
[58:55] we're not just here to you know I will I
[58:58] want to talk this morning on about
[58:59] zeroing in on the Promises of God
[59:01] uniting with them because we've got to
[59:03] unite with something you're right if we
[59:04] just Unite with where we are right now
[59:06] we'll stay there but if we Unite with
[59:08] every promise of God Amen God can
[59:11] manifest himself and we'll see those
[59:13] promises be fulfilled
[59:15] amen so we've got to stay see Abraham
[59:18] Abraham came to a spot where he only
[59:20] believed God
[59:21] he didn't consider his body dead he
[59:23] didn't consider the state of his wife it
[59:25] was impossible for Isaac but he United
[59:27] himself with that promise where God was
[59:30] more than able to give them the promised
[59:32] son Amen to that that was the walk that
[59:34] he walked right he had battles along the
[59:36] way he had troubles and strife and you
[59:38] know we're not immune from any of those
[59:39] things but those things really don't
[59:41] matter
[59:41] right those things actually don't matter
[59:43] amen we're looking at the promise Joe
[59:45] will have trouble but God will take you
[59:46] through the trouble sure will be you
[59:48] know we won't have any money in our bank
[59:50] accounts whatever may happen but God
[59:51] will take us through those things I mean
[59:53] but see God allows those things for us
[59:55] to actually seek him more and have a
[59:57] closer walk with him amen but to unite
[59:59] with a promise it means that you come to
[1:00:01] a place where you only believe that
[1:00:02] promise see see the on the day of
[1:00:05] Pentecost
[1:00:06] on the day of Pentecost there were 120
[1:00:09] in the upper room yeah and they and
[1:00:11] Jesus told them to stay there until
[1:00:13] you're in Jew with power from on high
[1:00:15] until the Prophecies of Joel where God
[1:00:17] said he'll pour a spirit out upon All
[1:00:19] Flesh will be manifested amen so so
[1:00:21] remember in that time there were
[1:00:23] actually Pentecostal people outside
[1:00:25] because it was the Feast of Pentecost
[1:00:27] see somewhere in Jerusalem just because
[1:00:30] of a tradition well it's the Feast of
[1:00:32] Pentecost I should go up to Jerusalem
[1:00:33] this is what we do our parents did this
[1:00:35] so it became a tradition but to the 120
[1:00:38] in the upper room it wasn't a tradition
[1:00:40] they had come to see the Fulfillment of
[1:00:42] the word but the thing is they had to
[1:00:44] they had to get rid of their own ideas
[1:00:46] and what they thought about everything
[1:00:48] and only take God in his word and then
[1:00:50] God came down when the day of Pentecost
[1:00:52] had fully come and he fulfilled that
[1:00:54] promise in their lives see some of them
[1:00:56] maybe they would have stood up maybe
[1:00:57] Andrew after about eight days or six
[1:00:59] days said well Brothers surely we've
[1:01:01] received it by faith because everything
[1:01:02] is received by faith and we believe that
[1:01:04] Jesus city of sin the promise of the
[1:01:06] comforter and here we are but you see no
[1:01:07] doubt Peter stood up and said Andrew
[1:01:09] that sounds all very very good I believe
[1:01:11] as well I know you're a Believer too but
[1:01:13] I need something to change me I need
[1:01:15] something to change me that when
[1:01:17] pressure comes against me I'll not fall
[1:01:19] and fail and deny the Lord like I did a
[1:01:21] few days ago see it's good to see the
[1:01:23] failure in your walk because if you see
[1:01:25] the failure in your walk you know that
[1:01:27] God can change you and take that failure
[1:01:29] out and give you Victory amen that's
[1:01:31] exactly what Peter he said he said yes I
[1:01:33] believe it but I need God to change me
[1:01:36] Hallelujah so that's why when the day of
[1:01:38] Pentecost fully came what'd they do they
[1:01:40] got rid of their reasoning they got rid
[1:01:42] of their ideas they got rid of their
[1:01:43] well I think it's going to happen this
[1:01:45] way until they sat there under
[1:01:47] expectation and then God came down and
[1:01:50] confirmed the promise in the emits
[1:01:52] Hallelujah but you see now we must
[1:01:54] always be willing to go beyond the camp
[1:01:58] Hallelujah see they got into a places on
[1:02:00] the day of Pentecost where it fully came
[1:02:02] it says they were of one
[1:02:04] they were all with one Accord in one
[1:02:07] place
[1:02:08] I mean many times you say they are one
[1:02:09] heart one mind and one Accord in one
[1:02:11] place so they had to get to a place
[1:02:13] where they were one Accord remember a
[1:02:15] lot of trouble had happened before that
[1:02:17] Judas had killed himself Peter was
[1:02:19] sitting there with his condemnation even
[1:02:21] though the Lord told him do you love me
[1:02:22] and all those things you know lots of
[1:02:23] trouble had happened but they had to lay
[1:02:25] aside all those things until they became
[1:02:28] in one Accord and that word won Accord
[1:02:31] it means to be unanimous amen it means
[1:02:34] to have it means to have one mind to be
[1:02:37] one Accord with one passion oh amen they
[1:02:41] they came into a position where they
[1:02:43] were of one mind what is that we're
[1:02:46] going to see God's word fulfilled right
[1:02:47] here in this church service we're going
[1:02:49] to see the prophecy become reality Amen
[1:02:52] in this church service we're going to
[1:02:53] see what's being laying on pages for
[1:02:55] hundreds of years or what's been in the
[1:02:56] message is gonna be put on flesh in you
[1:02:59] and I and that became their passion amen
[1:03:02] when you when you focus on the word of
[1:03:04] God everything else takes second place I
[1:03:06] mean when you really focus on it Lord
[1:03:07] you're more than able to fulfill this
[1:03:09] promise I mean everything else lays
[1:03:12] aside hallelujah amen like Brother Andy
[1:03:15] was saying you know we have a certain
[1:03:16] amount of affection but if you spread it
[1:03:18] everywhere they'll only be this much on
[1:03:19] the word of God but if you can take your
[1:03:21] affection from a whole bunch of nonsense
[1:03:22] in the world and place it on the word
[1:03:24] then what will that do your infection
[1:03:26] for the word will affection will
[1:03:28] increase then your expectation will
[1:03:30] increase what happening God will meet
[1:03:32] that expectation and fulfill it in your
[1:03:34] life who's with the who's with me this
[1:03:36] morning Hallelujah sometimes I feel like

[1:04:34] praise God it just took the anger out I
[1:04:36] just I just became happy I thought
[1:04:38] praise the Lord the reason that I feel
[1:04:40] this way is because that's how the devil
[1:04:41] feels towards me I thought praise the
[1:04:43] Lord the prophet said I hate him he
[1:04:45] hates me so you're allowed to hate
[1:04:47] someone that's the devil not your
[1:04:49] brother and sister not the person on the
[1:04:50] street not the person that's hurt you
[1:04:52] whatever more that's the devil you can
[1:04:53] hate Hallelujah so hey just Channel all
[1:04:56] of your hatred towards them and you know

[1:05:03] best way amen hell doesn't mean you get

[1:05:15] Hallelujah because your devil may be
[1:05:16] fighting you all week praise the Lord
[1:05:18] but we're coming to church amen God's
[1:05:20] going to come on the scene
[1:05:21] Hallelujah if you think I'm crazy well I
[1:05:24] did lose my mind
[1:05:25] I got a new one the mind of Christ
[1:05:28] Hallelujah and I've been happy with that
[1:05:30] mind ever since
[1:05:32] praise the Lord
[1:05:34] amen if we can get everyone to believe
[1:05:37] it's unlimited what Jesus will do
[1:05:40] it is unlimited he is Unlimited in his
[1:05:43] ability he's Unlimited in his power amen
[1:05:46] there is nothing too hard for him amen
[1:05:48] he is the god of the impossible I mean
[1:05:50] we think there is no way he is the way I
[1:05:54] mean when the three Hebrew children were
[1:05:55] thrown into that fire they already made
[1:05:57] up their mind if we burn we burn but
[1:05:58] we're still not going to Bow amen and
[1:06:00] God said I can identify myself with
[1:06:02] those kind of Believers and the
[1:06:03] impossible stepped into the fire and
[1:06:05] they had a wonderful time of worship I
[1:06:07] doubt very much they just stood there
[1:06:09] like this all right there would have
[1:06:10] been a worship of Praise His Adonai El
[1:06:13] Shaddai has stepped into our furnace and
[1:06:15] then he stepped into my trial Amen in
[1:06:17] the very last minute he stepped in
[1:06:18] Hallelujah I think that's something to
[1:06:20] praise God about and then we've seen God
[1:06:23] Time After Time step into trouble amen
[1:06:26] and he stealed the water amen he's calm
[1:06:28] the sea he's taken us through many
[1:06:29] battles amen I think if we can just
[1:06:32] unite ourselves with that kind of a God
[1:06:33] Amen it's unlimited what Jesus Christ
[1:06:36] will do you know the prophet tells us
[1:06:38] that we must think of God as being
[1:06:41] unchangeable
[1:06:43] he said we must make God real
[1:06:45] unchangeable
[1:06:47] we know he's unchangeable right in our
[1:06:49] mind but in our hearts we must realize
[1:06:51] he is the great unchanging Jehovah God
[1:06:53] who became Jesus Christ so our lord
[1:06:56] Jesus is unchangeable in his ways he's
[1:06:59] unchangeable in his nature I mean he's
[1:07:01] unchangeable in his ability amen because
[1:07:03] he's the all-powerful one so there's
[1:07:05] many times we see him and we can Rejoice
[1:07:07] what he's done for us in the past but in
[1:07:09] the present trial that we're in we're
[1:07:10] saying Lord how's this ever going to
[1:07:12] happen but if we realize he's unchanging
[1:07:14] amen and the same faith that he gave you
[1:07:16] back there and he's actually increased
[1:07:17] it from the time you got here there to
[1:07:19] here amen that same God can step upon
[1:07:21] the scene and manifest himself in your
[1:07:23] battle you're in right now remember
[1:07:25] Abraham the more he walked with God the
[1:07:27] greater challenges he faced
[1:07:29] all right yeah I remember he had the
[1:07:31] Armor's servants and go get locked they
[1:07:33] had all kinds of troubles goes on and
[1:07:35] you know but the thing is the more the
[1:07:36] more he walked with God the greater the
[1:07:38] battle became but the more he walked
[1:07:40] with God the more faith he he actually
[1:07:42] accumulated as he walked with God so
[1:07:44] remember God never comes to a battle and
[1:07:47] he's going to be defeated he never ever
[1:07:49] comes to a battle and says this is too
[1:07:51] big this is too hard I cannot do it no
[1:07:53] God raises the faith that your faith is
[1:07:56] more than able to overcome amen and we
[1:07:59] know faith is a revelation right amen
[1:08:01] faith is a it's revealed to you it's not
[1:08:03] a human
[1:08:04] understanding her idea it's it's a
[1:08:06] revelation yes yes Hallelujah just like
[1:08:09] just like David he was a Shepherd there
[1:08:10] and he killed the lion and then killed
[1:08:12] the greater enemy a bear and so what
[1:08:14] happens is Faith was increasing because
[1:08:16] he could look back at what God had done
[1:08:18] and he realized God was unchangeable to
[1:08:20] the same God There Was the Same God that
[1:08:22] was with him in the valley to fight
[1:08:24] Goliath and he had a revelation I can
[1:08:26] destroy this enemy why because I am a
[1:08:29] circumcised Son of God I'm standing in
[1:08:31] my inheritance and this enemy has to
[1:08:33] move amen he United himself with a
[1:08:35] promise where God told them one will
[1:08:37] chase a thousand two or chase ten
[1:08:39] thousand because he told he told Goliath
[1:08:41] and the armies of the Philistines he
[1:08:43] said I'm going to feed all your
[1:08:44] carcasses to the birds all right and I
[1:08:47] believe he could have done it one man
[1:08:48] could have killed one one teenage boy
[1:08:49] who's 15 here who's 16.
[1:08:52] anyone can you stand yeah stand up see
[1:08:56] his brother Kidder
[1:08:58] here we go
[1:08:59] that's kind of an age God bless you both
[1:09:01] this kind of an age walked into the army
[1:09:04] and his older brother say you're just
[1:09:06] naughty you're just here to you know you
[1:09:08] just want to see a battle and all these
[1:09:09] things these kind of an age stepped in
[1:09:12] and got mad at the Devil why is no one
[1:09:14] accepting this challenge why is no one
[1:09:17] doing this think you may have your seats
[1:09:18] you God bless you know teenage young
[1:09:21] person walks in and rallies the old
[1:09:23] generation rallies the whole church and
[1:09:26] says God gave me victories in the past I
[1:09:29] have a covenant with my God this
[1:09:31] uncircumcised Philistine has no promise
[1:09:33] with my God and he's going down
[1:09:36] Hallelujah
[1:09:37] praise a lot he's the same yesterday
[1:09:39] today and forever
[1:09:41] I remember the thing is we're gonna
[1:09:42] we're gonna come to a place where we
[1:09:44] unite ourselves with every promise now
[1:09:46] brother Brown says and works as Faith
[1:09:48] expressed he says no longer no matter
[1:09:51] how long it takes it's gonna happen he's
[1:09:53] speaking about when Isaiah prophesied a
[1:09:55] virgin shall conceive did you know it
[1:09:57] was 800 years before that happened God
[1:10:00] for knew the woman who who should be
[1:10:02] what her name was and and where that
[1:10:04] seed would fall into do you believe that
[1:10:06] sure he did and from a little literal
[1:10:09] womb will come forth this great miracle
[1:10:11] God knew about it he just revealed it to
[1:10:14] his Prophet who is faithful and spoke
[1:10:16] the word even uh without even thinking
[1:10:19] about uh what it was he just said it he
[1:10:21] never tried to reason it out if you try
[1:10:23] to reason it out what if this man this
[1:10:25] woman or this man here or somebody else
[1:10:27] try to reason now I've been crippled all
[1:10:29] these years the doctor says there's not
[1:10:31] a possible chance well there might not
[1:10:33] be as far as he knows that's true but if
[1:10:36] something can tear away them weeds so if
[1:10:39] something can tear away that which is
[1:10:40] choking faith
[1:10:42] if God by his grace not the preacher not
[1:10:44] anyone else but God can place into your
[1:10:46] heart of Revelation that I'm going to be
[1:10:48] well there isn't nothing going to keep
[1:10:50] you sitting there there's nothing can
[1:10:52] hold you there you're going to be well
[1:10:54] but until that does happen you're going
[1:10:56] to sit right there where the doctor says
[1:10:58] that you're going to sit until that
[1:11:00] happens it has to be revealed it's the
[1:11:02] grace of God that reveals it amen so if
[1:11:05] something can tear away them weed see a
[1:11:07] lot of promises in the Bible just stay
[1:11:09] up at our head it can be done he's our
[1:11:11] healer he's our provider he's our savior
[1:11:14] he will save my children all these
[1:11:16] things can be up in him but there's
[1:11:18] weeds of reasoning and doubt that that
[1:11:20] can choke the promise of God but he says
[1:11:22] if something can tear away them weeds
[1:11:24] then the Revelation can anchor into the
[1:11:26] heart and then God can begin to move who
[1:11:28] wants a revelation
[1:11:30] there's many promises I mean we could
[1:11:31] sit here unless all the promises of God
[1:11:34] and and all the promises of God are for
[1:11:37] you amen not just some of them all every
[1:11:39] promise in the word is for you for this
[1:11:41] age amen so but many times you say yes
[1:11:43] that's a nice thing amen but it's mental
[1:11:45] Faith it's got to become a revelation so
[1:11:48] now how do we how do we get rid of the
[1:11:50] weed see because see if there's a
[1:11:52] promise you read and you have need of
[1:11:55] don't just read it and say well it's a
[1:11:57] nice promise seek the Lord with all your
[1:11:59] heart till it becomes a revelation see
[1:12:02] ask seek knock you shall receive that's
[1:12:04] what the Lord said Heaven that seeketh
[1:12:05] find him that asketh not just ask asketh
[1:12:08] it shall be opened right so and we know
[1:12:10] faith is a revelation
[1:12:12] it's not in here it anchors down in your
[1:12:14] heart anchors down your soul and we know
[1:12:17] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:12:18] the word of God so if we want to unite
[1:12:20] ourselves with every promise we need all
[1:12:22] the weeds pulled out right so in order
[1:12:25] for the weeds to be pulled out then
[1:12:26] faith has to take a hold amen so so
[1:12:29] you've got to give God something to work
[1:12:32] with amen see you've got to feed your
[1:12:34] experience until it becomes a revelation
[1:12:37] who's following me this morning amen
[1:12:38] because because remember we want to
[1:12:40] unite ourselves not with reasoning not
[1:12:43] with doubt not with what our five senses
[1:12:45] declare but I want to unite ourselves
[1:12:47] with the promise of God Amen so in order
[1:12:50] to do that we're going to take out
[1:12:51] something's got to take out all of them
[1:12:52] weeds so now if you're sick for example
[1:12:55] a great way for God to tear them weeds
[1:12:57] of reasoning and doubt away is to find
[1:12:59] every healing testimony you can find
[1:13:01] right and what does it do it begins to
[1:13:03] build faith I mean you take every every
[1:13:06] promise of healing in the Bible and just
[1:13:07] begin to meditate upon those things amen
[1:13:09] it'll go from in your head down into
[1:13:11] your heart amen if you you know if you
[1:13:13] have need of the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:15] Ghost then you take God at his word and
[1:13:17] you find every instance in the Bible
[1:13:18] where they receive the Holy Ghost then
[1:13:20] you look into what the blood of Jesus
[1:13:22] Christ has already done for you and take
[1:13:24] every testimony you can find of people
[1:13:25] really meeting the Lord and it will
[1:13:27] build your faith right because whatever
[1:13:29] you focus on that's what you'll become
[1:13:31] amen so if you focus on those things
[1:13:33] amen focus on the good then God can step
[1:13:35] in and manifest it Hallelujah see it's
[1:13:38] whatever you're going through I'll
[1:13:39] guarantee there's a testimony on the
[1:13:41] Earth
[1:13:43] that someone has walked the steps you're
[1:13:45] you're walking maybe not exact details
[1:13:48] but there's but there will be someone
[1:13:49] that's already walked away that you've
[1:13:51] walked before
[1:13:53] and what will that do that will build
[1:13:54] that will build Faith so if it's a
[1:13:56] disease someone's already fought it
[1:13:58] remember Jesus has conquered it right if
[1:14:00] it's a financial need
[1:14:02] someone's already gone through it if
[1:14:04] it's salvation of your family someone's
[1:14:06] already gone through it I'm in marriage
[1:14:07] trouble trouble at work whatever it may
[1:14:09] be fine testimonies amen that that
[1:14:12] applied to your stories in the Bible and
[1:14:14] what it'll do it'll pull the weeds of
[1:14:16] reasoning and doubt away and and
[1:14:18] revelation will drop it who wants to
[1:14:20] have that kind of a walk I mean we're so
[1:14:22] focused Lord this is the battle I'm
[1:14:24] facing but Lord I know you have the
[1:14:26] answer you are the answer to this
[1:14:28] trouble and Lord I'm going to seek you
[1:14:30] with all my heart until the Anchor's not
[1:14:31] in my mind because if it's in your mind
[1:14:33] then reasoning can come in worry and
[1:14:35] doubts and troubles can come in and
[1:14:37] Cloud it up but if it anchors down in
[1:14:39] your heart it doesn't matter what you're
[1:14:40] facing doesn't matter what the symptoms
[1:14:42] if God said so it's going to happen then
[1:14:44] you can rest in that amen and go
[1:14:46] rejoicing that God is going to answer
[1:14:48] Hallelujah
[1:14:50] amen like you take like George mule I
[1:14:52] was thinking about you know providing
[1:14:54] financial needs you know I just I just
[1:14:56] Wikipedia to him he was the he was one
[1:14:58] of the founders of the um uh Brethren
[1:15:00] and different things but you know he he
[1:15:02] felt led to open an orphanage this is in
[1:15:04] England
[1:15:05] and um he cared for during his lifetime
[1:15:08] 10 000 and 24 orphans
[1:15:11] and he and he provided education
[1:15:14] opportunities for the orphans to the
[1:15:15] point where he he was even Accused by
[1:15:17] some of raising the poor above their
[1:15:19] natural station and British life is that
[1:15:21] how the devil works
[1:15:23] yeah you're living beyond your station
[1:15:25] that's what the devil says about you
[1:15:26] about the bride of Christ she's living
[1:15:28] beyond her station she has no right to
[1:15:30] be joint heirs with our lord Jesus I
[1:15:32] mean but God wants you to be joining us
[1:15:34] with him I mean I said George Mueller
[1:15:36] see he opened 117 schools that offer
[1:15:40] Christian education to more than 120 000
[1:15:42] students and it was all by faith many
[1:15:46] times there'd be nothing on the table
[1:15:47] but he'd have the table set and and you
[1:15:49] know they'll be praying thanking God for
[1:15:51] the food that wasn't even there and when
[1:15:53] he said amen there was a knock on the
[1:15:54] door someone said I've outlined to give
[1:15:55] you this
[1:15:56] that means there's many times of prayer
[1:15:58] but it was in his heart I want to do
[1:16:00] this for the people so God can supply
[1:16:02] any need it can look impossible but you
[1:16:04] think about ten thousand twenty four
[1:16:05] orphans 117 schools 120 000 students
[1:16:09] that's incredible
[1:16:11] and if he you know if he can do that by
[1:16:13] faith back in the day he lived how much
[1:16:15] more you and I living in this age
[1:16:18] amen you say well I'd like a
[1:16:21] um
[1:16:21] I want something from the Bible to prove
[1:16:23] about listening to testimonials will
[1:16:24] raise your faith okay the woman with the
[1:16:26] blood issue had never had a single
[1:16:29] person before of a testimony of someone
[1:16:32] touching the hymn of Jesus garment being
[1:16:34] healed but something anchored into her
[1:16:36] heart if I can just get to that man and
[1:16:37] I can just touch the hymn of his
[1:16:39] government I don't even need to ask him
[1:16:40] permission I don't even need to have a
[1:16:42] conversation tell him I need all I
[1:16:43] needed to do is touch the hymn of His
[1:16:45] Garment and then I'll be made well
[1:16:46] Hallelujah so and we know what happened
[1:16:48] the blood as you stopped
[1:16:51] now that's in that's in Matthew 9. now
[1:16:54] in Matthew 14 when Jesus goes across the
[1:16:56] sea it says that the men when they were
[1:16:59] and when the men that of that place had
[1:17:02] knowledge of him they sent out all into
[1:17:04] that country round about and brought
[1:17:05] unto him all that were diseased and
[1:17:07] besought him that they might only Touch
[1:17:09] the Hem of His Garment and as many as
[1:17:11] touched were perfectly made whole so
[1:17:13] what happened the testimony of the woman
[1:17:15] with the blood issue spread and then
[1:17:16] when Jesus turned up they said hey if
[1:17:18] the law can do it for her they can do it
[1:17:20] for us amen so what happened that
[1:17:22] testimony ignited faith and the people
[1:17:24] got the same results as the woman before
[1:17:26] them Hallelujah it should be the same
[1:17:28] thing with you and I when you look at a
[1:17:30] testimony that's why it's very important
[1:17:31] go through this go through the
[1:17:33] discernment lines
[1:17:35] there'll be needs there that you're
[1:17:37] facing that God answered there and if
[1:17:40] you realize that he is unchangeable in
[1:17:41] his ways and in his nature and it's the
[1:17:44] same Faith they had you receive you can
[1:17:46] get the same thing amen because remember
[1:17:48] we have the same faith are we Believers
[1:17:50] this morning I mean do we have a do we
[1:17:53] believe in the finished work of calvary
[1:17:56] I mean brother Brown said that is the
[1:17:57] key that unlocks every Divine promise
[1:17:59] faith in the finished work doesn't
[1:18:01] matter what you're facing faith in that
[1:18:03] finished work will bring it to pass amen
[1:18:05] but let God anchor it into your heart
[1:18:07] Unite with the promise don't Unite with
[1:18:09] your history with your past with your
[1:18:11] doubts with your troubles even what
[1:18:12] you're going through right now don't
[1:18:14] meditate upon those things meditate on
[1:18:16] the Promises of God because remember he
[1:18:18] is a god of the present he's The Great I
[1:18:20] Am he's not the I was or the will be
[1:18:22] he's The Great I Am he is present here
[1:18:24] Amen to meet every need I believe that
[1:18:27] this morning
[1:18:28] Hallelujah but you see now we've got to
[1:18:30] go beyond
[1:18:32] beyond our camp
[1:18:33] we go beyond our camp of just going
[1:18:36] through the motions yeah
[1:18:38] yeah amen we need to be willing be be
[1:18:41] willing to lay aside things from the
[1:18:43] past yeah yeah you know I'm um so when
[1:18:45] David was anointed king over Israel
[1:18:47] remember they just had Civil War
[1:18:50] they had civil war between between you
[1:18:52] know Judah and Benjamin and then the
[1:18:55] rest of Israel
[1:18:56] right because there was still Saul's
[1:18:58] house there and there was David right
[1:18:59] there's after Saul died but they had to
[1:19:01] lay aside those differences they had to
[1:19:03] go beyond the camp of what just happened
[1:19:04] and remember Israel was eye for an eye
[1:19:06] tooth for a tooth so no doubt when their
[1:19:08] brother was killed in battle and this
[1:19:10] happened they said I'm going to settle
[1:19:11] that score and that's what happened to
[1:19:13] Abner remember joab killed her murdered
[1:19:15] him in a time of Peace why because he
[1:19:17] wanted to settle the score but they had
[1:19:18] to lay aside all those things in order
[1:19:21] to anoint David King they had to go
[1:19:23] beyond the camp see it's it's so see
[1:19:26] shamgar had to come to a place where he
[1:19:29] realized he was a circumcised son of
[1:19:31] Abraham that he had to go beyond the
[1:19:33] camp of just being of of just letting
[1:19:35] the devil come and the Philistines come
[1:19:37] in and take his Harvest so he had to go
[1:19:39] beyond the camp of world this is just a
[1:19:40] season look we've harvested all these
[1:19:42] crops now now next on the agenda is it's
[1:19:45] going to be taken from us he had to go
[1:19:46] beyond the camp of the blessing being
[1:19:48] stolen it should be the same thing with
[1:19:50] you and I many times we get a blessing
[1:19:51] in church and the devil wants to try and
[1:19:52] take it from us we're going to put an
[1:19:54] end to that amen with the atmosphere
[1:19:56] that we Kevin Church of rejoicing loving
[1:19:58] God that atmosphere should go home with
[1:20:00] us I mean that should continue church
[1:20:02] should be every day doesn't mean you
[1:20:03] stand and preach you'll sing by just
[1:20:05] your life you live should be be a
[1:20:06] worship to God Amen says but the thing
[1:20:09] is you need the we need the right
[1:20:10] atmosphere to unite to the promise we
[1:20:13] didn't we don't need an atmosphere of
[1:20:15] moodiness
[1:20:16] amen we may be Moody's well we're human
[1:20:18] right I know I ask every question that
[1:20:20] every week and some of you say yes I'm
[1:20:22] still human others have gone to a Next
[1:20:23] Level right but right so there'll be
[1:20:25] times when we're grumpy there'll be
[1:20:27] times where we're Moody but we're gonna
[1:20:29] we're gonna go beyond those atmospheres
[1:20:31] see our feelings should not dictate to
[1:20:34] us our Victory amen right faith faith
[1:20:37] gives us Victory Faith gives us
[1:20:40] overcoming power it's not if we feel it
[1:20:41] it's not if we think it it's do we
[1:20:45] believe it see many people are lit
[1:20:48] remember this world has led by their
[1:20:49] feelings whatever feels good do it and
[1:20:52] there's no restrictions nowadays if I
[1:20:54] feel like a woman I'm a woman it feels
[1:20:57] good I'm excited or if I'm not I'm a man
[1:20:59] or whatever more you know but whatever I
[1:21:01] feel to do I can just do
[1:21:03] but we shouldn't be led by our feelings
[1:21:05] we should be led by the Lord by his word
[1:21:08] amen and you've got to realize if you're
[1:21:09] feeling Moody you're feeling grumpy it's
[1:21:11] a devil trying to ward off the blessings
[1:21:13] of God out of your life see because God
[1:21:15] wants us to be happy he wants us to be
[1:21:17] at peace he wants us to be happy in our
[1:21:19] hearts amen rejoicing in spite of the
[1:21:22] circumstances
[1:21:24] Hallelujah see that's why we've got to
[1:21:26] get rid of that and come into an
[1:21:27] atmosphere of Faith to unite with the
[1:21:29] promise of God well how do you get into
[1:21:31] that kind of atmosphere what you think
[1:21:33] upon will become the atmosphere so if
[1:21:35] you think about what brother sister blah
[1:21:38] blah did to you
[1:21:40] you know and hurt you and this person
[1:21:41] hurts you this person did this it's
[1:21:43] going to create an atmosphere around you
[1:21:45] you're not going to be happy and loving
[1:21:47] everyone you're going to be shelled up
[1:21:48] hurt and and and Bob sticking out right
[1:21:51] but then if you begin to think about how
[1:21:54] good the Lord is and what he's done for
[1:21:56] you and where he's called you from and
[1:21:59] every time he's answered prayer and your
[1:22:01] own testimony you'll go from grumpiness
[1:22:03] and moodness to you you'll be rejoicing
[1:22:05] Hallelujah all the weight of the world
[1:22:07] will fall off your shoulders because you
[1:22:08] realize if my God called me he's going
[1:22:11] to keep me amen of my God save me he
[1:22:14] can't lose me amen and if he saved me
[1:22:16] he's going to save my family because the
[1:22:18] Bible said so amen so we already have
[1:22:20] the victory Hallelujah amen and what
[1:22:23] that is what does that do create the
[1:22:24] atmosphere of atmosphere of Faith yeah
[1:22:27] yeah what does it do pull all the weeds
[1:22:29] out amen it gives us
[1:22:32] see it gives us an atmosphere of unity
[1:22:35] with the promise he says in wisdom
[1:22:37] versus faith says you've got to believe
[1:22:41] you've got to believe it then that falls
[1:22:43] into an atmosphere of faith and it's got
[1:22:45] to produce it it's just got to so if you
[1:22:48] have an atmosphere of Faith around you
[1:22:49] it's got to produce what you're
[1:22:51] believing for
[1:22:52] amen see the Lord produced I mean he he
[1:22:56] see we have to realize that if we're in
[1:22:59] an atmosphere maybe we're facing a
[1:23:01] depression or some mood and or something
[1:23:03] you know you just feel down all the time
[1:23:04] you know the there's a greater one that
[1:23:08] can stop you being bound into that I
[1:23:10] remember when I was in
[1:23:12] I think it's year 10 they call it these
[1:23:14] days fourth form as a boarding school
[1:23:15] and one of my friends told a lie on me
[1:23:18] that was my birthday and apparently on
[1:23:19] your birthday you get thrown into the
[1:23:21] swimming pool in your full uniform
[1:23:22] so he said it it's his birthday
[1:23:25] so four guys grab me picked me up took
[1:23:28] me to the school swimming pool threw me
[1:23:30] in we had to wear stuff like this for
[1:23:33] school
[1:23:34] it wasn't my birthday
[1:23:36] but you see I could not in My Own
[1:23:38] Strength break that light break the
[1:23:40] effect of that lie to be free you see
[1:23:43] but we have one greater because if the
[1:23:46] devil's telling you you're never going
[1:23:47] to make it it's not gonna happen this is
[1:23:49] just how life is you know that person's
[1:23:51] never yet saved you'll never have
[1:23:53] Victory you're never going to overcome
[1:23:54] this what is that that's a lie and if
[1:23:56] you believe that lie you get it you get
[1:23:58] Bound by it just like I was picked up by
[1:24:00] my school friends
[1:24:03] you see but if I had one greater than me
[1:24:05] there I could say no that's a lie it's
[1:24:07] not my birthday and those boys would
[1:24:09] have had to drop me and I would never be
[1:24:10] thrown into the pool
[1:24:12] amen so you've got to realize we've got
[1:24:13] one greater than ourselves or all the
[1:24:16] lives that the enemy tells us in our
[1:24:18] minds that can break us of those things
[1:24:21] Hallelujah isn't that wonderful
[1:24:25] thank you praise the Lord now
[1:24:32] people say things are safe
[1:24:34] we need to go beyond safety I'm just
[1:24:36] going to come back to the store that I'm
[1:24:37] going to that I'm going to finish
[1:24:40] now the danger of every age
[1:24:42] is when God moves in a powerful way
[1:24:45] then fear Creeps in
[1:24:47] it says how can we keep this brother bam
[1:24:49] says in the church age book he says a
[1:24:51] few moments ago I mentioned John
[1:24:53] understood what it was to love God that
[1:24:55] great Apostle of Love would certainly
[1:24:57] see it when the church began to lose
[1:24:58] that first love of God in first John 5 3
[1:25:01] he says for this is the love of God that
[1:25:03] we keep his Commandments his word one
[1:25:06] little deviation from that word was to
[1:25:07] step away from Christ people saying they
[1:25:09] love God they go to church they even
[1:25:11] shout and rejoice and sing and have a
[1:25:12] great emotional time but when it's all
[1:25:14] over watch and see if they are in that
[1:25:16] word living in it walking in it if they
[1:25:18] go through all the other and then don't
[1:25:20] walk in that word they say they love God
[1:25:21] but their lives tell another story I
[1:25:24] wonder if John didn't see a lot of that
[1:25:25] before he died some people say they love
[1:25:27] God but not obeying his word oh Ephesian
[1:25:29] Church something's happening to you
[1:25:30] someone is trying to either add to that
[1:25:32] word or take from it but they are doing
[1:25:34] it so subtly that you don't see it they
[1:25:37] don't they haven't made a big move
[1:25:40] bigger move so you can see it out there
[1:25:42] in the open but it's undercover and
[1:25:44] they're bringing it by way of reason and
[1:25:47] human understanding and it will take
[1:25:48] over unless you refuse it get back to
[1:25:50] Pentecost before it's too late but as
[1:25:52] usual guy people don't heed God's
[1:25:54] warning that Revival fire built upon the
[1:25:56] sacred word is so wonderful and the
[1:25:58] manifestation of the spirit so blessed
[1:26:00] that a little Fair Creeps in and a
[1:26:02] whisper in the heart says how can we
[1:26:04] protect this truth we have what can we
[1:26:06] do to see this revival goes on that is
[1:26:09] when the Antichrist Spirit comes in a
[1:26:11] Whispers look you have the truth now see
[1:26:13] that it doesn't get lost organize and
[1:26:15] set up your Creed of what you believe
[1:26:17] put it in a church manual they do it
[1:26:19] they organize they add to the word they
[1:26:21] die just like Eve did for taking one
[1:26:24] wrong word it's God's word that brings
[1:26:25] life it's not what we say about the word
[1:26:28] that counts but it's what God Said So
[1:26:30] there's a fair creeps and how do we keep
[1:26:32] the fire burning on well let's basically
[1:26:34] put a full stop behind what we believe
[1:26:35] that's basically a church manual so so
[1:26:38] what happens it becomes a camp it
[1:26:39] becomes a full stop and people and
[1:26:42] people can't move on it's good
[1:26:43] intentions because we want to see God
[1:26:45] keep moving right
[1:26:47] I'm glad some of you love him Hallelujah
[1:26:50] I know the rest of you do too amen but
[1:26:52] you know you see but but we don't just
[1:26:53] want to put a full stop around where we
[1:26:55] are we want to keep walking with the
[1:26:57] word I mean just like you know Moses
[1:26:59] would plead with God lord if your
[1:27:01] presence may your presence always go
[1:27:03] with us amen don't leave us amen if we
[1:27:06] found Grace you know if I found Grace in
[1:27:08] thy sight show me show me how thy way I
[1:27:11] may Know Thee if I found Grace in thy
[1:27:12] sight and consider that this nation thy
[1:27:14] people and he said my presence will go
[1:27:16] with you and I'll give thee rest and he
[1:27:17] said If thy presence go not with me
[1:27:19] carry us not up hence so basically God
[1:27:22] wherever you are I want to keep moving I
[1:27:24] don't just want to stand here and stay
[1:27:25] here in the desert here and then you
[1:27:27] keep going and then you know oh I don't
[1:27:29] just want to keep going on and you don't
[1:27:30] go with us amen so this is where this
[1:27:32] fear comes and how can we keep this
[1:27:34] protected and then people say this is
[1:27:36] how it should be and then that's it
[1:27:38] and they don't move with the revelation
[1:27:40] of the word
[1:27:41] see
[1:27:43] a very easy way to look at this is if
[1:27:44] you just take music for example
[1:27:46] some just say stay with the old songs
[1:27:48] and think that they are the only Godly
[1:27:50] songs to sing that they are safe they
[1:27:52] are safe and The Godly songs
[1:27:55] amen
[1:27:56] some of the old songs are inspired right
[1:27:58] Amen to some people say stay with those
[1:28:01] and they say well you know the newer
[1:28:03] songs they're all actually evil there's
[1:28:04] a spirit of rock and roll on them and
[1:28:06] then that spirit will come into the
[1:28:08] church and then some say well you know
[1:28:10] drums is an instrument of evil just
[1:28:12] playing a drum brings
[1:28:14] a demon spurred into the church
[1:28:16] but brother Bram never condemned the
[1:28:18] particular instrument yeah he never
[1:28:20] condemned a certain thing you know if we
[1:28:22] want to condemn an instrument actually
[1:28:24] rock and roll started on the piano yeah
[1:28:26] and then if you take the the very formal
[1:28:28] dead churches it's the organ
[1:28:31] I remember you know
[1:28:32] I was a boarding school in King's
[1:28:34] College they had a they had a literal
[1:28:35] pipe organ in their Chapel and that
[1:28:38] thing would really play had the massive
[1:28:39] pipes everything but you see it's all
[1:28:41] formal and dead and Powerless
[1:28:43] that's a dead religious spirit that's
[1:28:45] controlling that there sorry should we
[1:28:46] get rid of that should we get rid of the
[1:28:47] piano because that's where Rock and Roll
[1:28:48] start a boogie woogie didn't start on
[1:28:50] there it started here yeah yeah see but
[1:28:53] people who say it's safe say we should
[1:28:54] keep that and get rid of that and they
[1:28:56] don't understand it's actually the
[1:28:57] people playing it that actually makes it
[1:28:59] a certain way amen it's the it's the
[1:29:02] it's the person playing it brings the
[1:29:04] spirit yeah amen it's not the particular
[1:29:06] instrument at all because brother Ramsey
[1:29:08] I'd rather be beating the drum of the
[1:29:09] Salvation Army on the street corner and
[1:29:11] having God live that have a big fire and
[1:29:14] fancy church and everyone's fussing and
[1:29:15] fight against during see what does it
[1:29:17] produce see amen so you know but some
[1:29:20] people say well the older way is just
[1:29:22] safe and we shouldn't we shouldn't have
[1:29:23] these things but really you've got to
[1:29:25] look at now what fruit is the worship
[1:29:27] producing
[1:29:28] you know because we can have the finest
[1:29:31] Church the finest instruments the finest
[1:29:32] musicians the finest singers but if but
[1:29:35] but if everyone is separated everyone's
[1:29:37] in their clicks they won't talk to one
[1:29:38] another there's no forgiveness there's
[1:29:39] business and strife something's very
[1:29:41] wrong
[1:29:42] amen and then and then if we are that
[1:29:44] way we should go back to the street
[1:29:45] corner we should go back there to Sea
[1:29:47] View where we're worshiping in a
[1:29:49] building where there be buckets of water
[1:29:50] literally come through the come through
[1:29:52] the ceiling and you know it's freezing
[1:29:53] cold and you know amen if God was there
[1:29:56] we should stay where God is thankfully I
[1:29:58] believe God has come with us right or we
[1:30:00] have come with him
[1:30:02] Hallelujah you see it's by by a fridge
[1:30:05] now people say you know drums are wrong
[1:30:07] well actually the timbrel or the
[1:30:09] tambourine
[1:30:11] began as a as a drum a hand drum it says
[1:30:15] in the Jewish encyclopedia
[1:30:17] it says that the it's it's at the
[1:30:19] timbrel or the tambourine originally in
[1:30:22] Bible days was was more of a hand drum
[1:30:24] and it was in Jewish music of that era
[1:30:26] the timber was actually used for rhythm
[1:30:28] as opposed to the melody
[1:30:30] so it kept the Rhythm and the Assyrians
[1:30:32] and the Egyptians also used it so just
[1:30:34] because the Egyptians and syrians used
[1:30:36] it do you think we should throw it away
[1:30:39] right but it was actually used for
[1:30:40] rhythm all there than it was today the
[1:30:44] temporal is an instrument which is its
[1:30:46] whole character is inappropriate for
[1:30:48] more mournful occasions
[1:30:50] so we're not here to have a funeral
[1:30:52] March right so so if we want to have a
[1:30:56] dead church and it'll be a funeral March
[1:30:58] we should get rid of the timbrel the
[1:31:00] drums that's what it evolved into it
[1:31:02] started as a hand drum now it's on a
[1:31:04] stand yeah right so we should get rid of
[1:31:07] it if we're here for a mournful occasion
[1:31:08] but I'm not here for a mournful occasion
[1:31:10] I have eternal life I'm going to heaven
[1:31:14] I'm going in a Rapture he's redeeming by
[1:31:16] his blood that's not what I've done it's
[1:31:18] what he has already done for me that's
[1:31:19] what I rejoice in I rejoice in the god
[1:31:21] of my salvation amen I'm not here to be
[1:31:24] mournful and weep and cry because
[1:31:25] everything's falling apart no I Rejoice
[1:31:27] because God is greater than the problem
[1:31:29] I mean God is the solution to every
[1:31:31] problem see that's why it's
[1:31:33] inappropriate for a mournful occasion
[1:31:36] amen but in keeping only with cheerful
[1:31:39] songs and games such as accompanying
[1:31:41] weddings this is from the Jewish
[1:31:42] encyclopedia we should this is a wedding
[1:31:45] time you come to a wedding twice a week
[1:31:47] if you come twice a week hello what's a
[1:31:49] union between Christ and his bride I
[1:31:51] mean that's what churches meant to be
[1:31:53] it's for popular rejoicings so so for
[1:31:56] example the reception of a Victorious
[1:31:58] General lift up your hands all your
[1:32:00] Gates of the king of glory shall come in
[1:32:02] Hallelujah he's the Victorious Mighty
[1:32:05] conqueror that conquered hell death in
[1:32:07] the grave so he should play the timbrel
[1:32:09] why because our Kings come to town
[1:32:11] hallelujah amen it's for banquets
[1:32:14] hey man we're having a banquet of the
[1:32:16] word hallelujah hallelujah don't just
[1:32:19] look at the food eat the food
[1:32:21] don't just look at the drinks table
[1:32:23] become one with the drinks table
[1:32:25] Hallelujah you'll enjoy it real good I
[1:32:27] mean religious religious festivals of a
[1:32:29] joyful and a popular character
[1:32:33] Hallelujah
[1:32:34] see what happens though is people say no
[1:32:36] it's not safe because of what the world
[1:32:38] has done with it yeah I'm sure some of
[1:32:40] you have seen videos that very
[1:32:42] fundamental conservatives churches put
[1:32:44] out and they and they show the evils of
[1:32:47] this music and you know how we should
[1:32:49] just not have drums we should just have
[1:32:50] strings and different things like this
[1:32:52] but then my question was if that's
[1:32:55] really the case
[1:32:56] then why on Earth are they still in
[1:32:59] their denomination because Jesus said
[1:33:01] when the spirit of Truth has come he
[1:33:03] will guide you into all truth now we
[1:33:05] know music brings an anointing right
[1:33:07] it's not entertainment if you listen to
[1:33:08] music for an entertainment you need to
[1:33:10] look beyond that because because music
[1:33:12] either brings God or the devil down or
[1:33:15] the devil up rather because the devil is
[1:33:17] not up he's down right so so that's what
[1:33:20] music in the Bible does is what music in
[1:33:22] this world does it brings an anointing
[1:33:24] and then whatever the anointing is on
[1:33:26] that music will be manifested in the
[1:33:27] people so so if if if there's a correct
[1:33:30] way to play and the correct music to
[1:33:32] have instruments to have and if they
[1:33:34] have it then why are they denominational
[1:33:35] because of the spirit of Truth which is
[1:33:37] the Holy Ghost comes down in their
[1:33:39] worship the wood would open they'd say
[1:33:41] let's get out of this dead Place let's
[1:33:44] embrace the full word
[1:33:45] but they're still stuck in that sea so
[1:33:48] it goes beyond just having what they
[1:33:49] call
[1:33:51] the right instruments yeah amen and then
[1:33:54] they also say well worldly Tunes
[1:33:57] doesn't matter if there's Christian
[1:33:59] words on it we'll actually bring a devil
[1:34:01] into a church as well
[1:34:04] and if you do that even if you're
[1:34:05] sincere you're being deceived well
[1:34:07] brother Bram loved the song down from
[1:34:09] his glory
[1:34:10] who loves that song down from his glory
[1:34:12] every living story do you know the tune
[1:34:14] where'd that tune come from it was an
[1:34:16] Italian
[1:34:18] love song
[1:34:19] is the tune
[1:34:21] so if they are right then then the
[1:34:23] prophet was wrong
[1:34:25] so you're going to look Beyond these
[1:34:26] things but you see it's safe to stay
[1:34:28] with the old now I'm not saying get rid
[1:34:30] of the old I love the old songs I love
[1:34:32] some of the new songs some of the new
[1:34:34] songs I don't care for yeah right but as
[1:34:36] brother Isaac said years ago well we'll
[1:34:37] do it as a special if God anoints it
[1:34:39] we'll keep singing it if it kind of I
[1:34:40] know what the word you use but if it
[1:34:41] didn't work we'd just throw it out and
[1:34:43] and I think that's a good way of looking
[1:34:45] at it if God amends the song Praise the
[1:34:47] Lord we want him to keep amening I mean
[1:34:49] but if he doesn't well praise God we can
[1:34:51] move on from there amen but you see the
[1:34:54] devil attacks worship because he knows
[1:34:57] if a people really get into worship into
[1:34:59] the spirit of worship not just singing
[1:35:01] songs but into the spirit of praise and
[1:35:03] worship and they forget about themselves
[1:35:05] and forget about their battles and their
[1:35:07] problems and they worship the law with
[1:35:09] all their heart then the Lord steps down
[1:35:11] because remember he inhabits the Praises
[1:35:13] of his people amen so when you begin to
[1:35:15] praise God sure you may have had the
[1:35:16] worst week of your life the worst year
[1:35:18] of your life the worst decade of your
[1:35:19] life but if you walk into the prince of
[1:35:22] God you begin to praise Him amen then
[1:35:24] God begins to inhabit that praise
[1:35:26] Hallelujah he begins to step in and say
[1:35:28] I'm going to worship with them and then
[1:35:30] the atmosphere begins to change
[1:35:31] Hallelujah and the devil knows if the
[1:35:34] people get into that kind of a condition
[1:35:35] anything can happen I mean because God
[1:35:38] is Unlimited in his ability amen he can
[1:35:41] do anything in that kind of an
[1:35:42] atmosphere anything can happen there's
[1:35:44] no telling what our Lord will do when
[1:35:46] the moment Jesus gets a hold of you
[1:35:48] Hallelujah so you've got to read that's
[1:35:50] why the devil attacks worship I mean
[1:35:52] because he knows that the people if we
[1:35:54] get into that kind of state then you
[1:35:56] know prayer goes up gifts begin to
[1:35:58] manifest answers come peace comes the
[1:36:01] Holy Ghost comes down you know Paul and
[1:36:03] Silas are in the inner prison they're
[1:36:05] beating their feet in stocks but then
[1:36:06] they begin to look but then they begin
[1:36:08] to unite with a promise I'll never leave
[1:36:10] thee nor forsake thee I'll be with thee
[1:36:13] to the End of the Age the world may
[1:36:14] seeth me no more but ye shall see me and
[1:36:17] then Paul would say yo Silas I saw him
[1:36:18] on the road to Damascus hey man I didn't
[1:36:20] see him before that but I saw him and he
[1:36:23] changed my life and so I'll say you know
[1:36:24] Paul I remember the day Jesus met me
[1:36:26] Hallelujah I'm so glad that he's alive
[1:36:28] and and there may be signs to say to
[1:36:31] Paul Paul what's your favorite song Oh
[1:36:33] My yeah down from his glory well I'm so
[1:36:35] glad I can say I'm one of them I wasn't
[1:36:37] in the upper room but the same God in
[1:36:39] the upper room was the same God in the
[1:36:40] road to Damascus Hallelujah they begin
[1:36:42] to sing they begin to praise when the
[1:36:44] atmosphere beginner change in the prison
[1:36:45] they forgot they were in prison and God
[1:36:47] came down and shook the place amen and
[1:36:50] every prison door came open
[1:36:52] Hallelujah so everyone that was bound
[1:36:54] became free because two men began to
[1:36:57] praise God you say well that's just for
[1:36:59] natural prisons no no we don't need
[1:37:01] natural prison bars to come open this
[1:37:03] morning we need spiritual change to be
[1:37:05] broken we need spiritual bars to be
[1:37:07] broken in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:37:10] so if you you can create an atmosphere
[1:37:11] you know the Welsh Revival started by
[1:37:13] one young young person young sister go
[1:37:16] up and say I love the Lord with all my
[1:37:18] heart then God came down and started a
[1:37:20] Revival over a hundred thousand Souls
[1:37:22] came to the kingdom because one young
[1:37:24] sister stood up and said I love the Lord
[1:37:25] with all my heart and God came down in
[1:37:27] power
[1:37:29] Hallelujah he's the same one today we
[1:37:31] can have that kind of river we could
[1:37:33] have that kind of Revival why we can
[1:37:36] have it the devil says no you can't I
[1:37:37] say yeah we can I mean our God can do
[1:37:39] anything amen we can have a time where
[1:37:41] God can move in such power like never
[1:37:43] before Hallelujah why because he's the
[1:37:45] god of the impossible amen so what
[1:37:47] everything begins to manifest I mean
[1:37:49] when we begin to worship God
[1:37:51] holla you know I found the greatest joy
[1:37:54] in prayer recently was telling God how
[1:37:56] great he is and what he means to me I
[1:37:59] found the greatest blessing if you can't
[1:38:00] think of you may feel dead as a post you
[1:38:03] may feel like what's the use of praying
[1:38:04] you begin to tell God how great he is
[1:38:06] and what he means to you it'll change
[1:38:08] the atmosphere in your prayer I mean
[1:38:10] you'll begin to pray to begin to flow
[1:38:12] you begin to have such a wonderful time
[1:38:13] then maybe it starts to get a bit hard
[1:38:15] again you start to tell God how great he
[1:38:16] is again it comes down again Hallelujah
[1:38:19] and that's what Jesus told us to do Our
[1:38:21] Father which out in heaven Hallowed be
[1:38:22] thy name yes why because he gave the
[1:38:24] model for the model yeah he gave the
[1:38:26] model prayer right
[1:38:28] so it doesn't matter what you're going
[1:38:29] through just begin to tell God how great
[1:38:31] he is and you'll find him come on the
[1:38:33] scene like never before
[1:38:35] Hallelujah
[1:38:37] every Revival through history has had
[1:38:39] its own songs written
[1:38:42] that's why we can't just stay with the
[1:38:43] old songs we've got to keep let God
[1:38:45] bring forth manifest the Revival and
[1:38:47] song
[1:38:49] amen
[1:38:50] David would say this Praise You the Lord
[1:38:53] praise God in the sanctuary this is
[1:38:54] Psalms 150. Praise Him in the firmament
[1:38:57] of his power praise him for his mighty
[1:38:59] Acts
[1:39:00] he's done so much hasn't he friends he's
[1:39:02] done Mighty things Among Us Praise Him
[1:39:04] according to his excellent greatness
[1:39:06] praise him with the sound of the trumpet
[1:39:08] praise him with the pulsory in the harp
[1:39:10] praise him with the Timberland the dance
[1:39:12] amen praise him with a string
[1:39:14] instruments and organs Praise Him upon
[1:39:16] the loud symbols
[1:39:18] hallelujah praise Him upon the high
[1:39:20] sounding symbols let everything at hath
[1:39:22] breath praise ye the Lord amen to he
[1:39:24] says make it you know we should play
[1:39:26] skillfully
[1:39:27] amen but he says yo make a loud noise
[1:39:30] basically praise the Lord amen give him
[1:39:32] glory amen he says I'll praise the Lord
[1:39:34] at all times
[1:39:36] Good Times bad times I'll praise the
[1:39:38] Lord what does that do it makes you
[1:39:39] Unite with the promise I mean when we
[1:39:41] begin to praise God we can Unite with
[1:39:43] every single promise amen if we come one
[1:39:45] mind one heart one Accord one passion
[1:39:48] brother Ram says it's unlimited what
[1:39:50] Jesus will do
[1:39:51] Hallelujah so I believe this morning we
[1:39:54] can have that kind of a time amen see
[1:39:56] the devil fights our worship but I say
[1:39:58] no devil if you don't like it we're
[1:40:00] going to do it again just like McCall
[1:40:02] you know you know we're watching David
[1:40:04] the other side and sound playing you
[1:40:06] know David's dancing before the ark and
[1:40:07] all these things and of course you know
[1:40:08] and you know it's just like in the Bible
[1:40:10] McCall there who is the daughter of Saul
[1:40:12] who's married to David looks out the
[1:40:13] window and disdains him here's the king
[1:40:16] of Israel and he's and he's dancing
[1:40:18] before God half naked before everyone
[1:40:20] rejoicing remember she was a king's
[1:40:22] daughter she knew what ceremony was like
[1:40:24] right she had seen it before but this
[1:40:26] just seemed out of order to her all
[1:40:28] right this just seemed out of this just
[1:40:30] seemed out of out of step with what her
[1:40:32] dad did but you see Saul was a previous
[1:40:34] generation now was a new dispensation I
[1:40:37] mean where God wasn't just there a
[1:40:39] little bit but they were going to take
[1:40:40] every Divine promise everything that
[1:40:42] Moses promised them or God promised
[1:40:44] through Moses then they were going to
[1:40:45] actually fulfill it when David became
[1:40:46] king so so maybe the ceremony looked
[1:40:49] similar but David just seemed a little
[1:40:51] bit out of but then God looked down and
[1:40:53] saw David said David you're a man after
[1:40:55] my own heart now look because what God
[1:40:57] saw in his mind was now manifested upon
[1:40:58] the Earth here's someone who really
[1:41:00] Praises me with all their heart they
[1:41:02] don't care what's going on around them
[1:41:03] they don't care that they should be
[1:41:04] dignified the king whatever or no the
[1:41:06] ark is coming into the city I mean God's
[1:41:09] presence is coming into the city
[1:41:10] Hallelujah God has given us a capital
[1:41:12] and we can praise His great name
[1:41:15] Hallelujah
[1:41:16] so don't despise it
[1:41:18] dance along
[1:41:20] and there's no telling what our God will
[1:41:21] do
[1:41:22] Hallelujah
[1:41:24] you ever need this morning Worship the
[1:41:25] Lord You've Got trouble Worship the Lord
[1:41:27] amen your unanswered questions worship
[1:41:29] the law you have a need or you don't you
[1:41:31] don't know the way forward Worship the
[1:41:33] Lord and see what he'll do see what
[1:41:35] he'll show you amen God is Unlimited in
[1:41:37] this place I believe hallelu let's have
[1:41:39] the musicians this morning
[1:41:41] amen we can praise God this morning
[1:41:43] can't we yes Hallelujah
[1:41:46] amen there's not there's no telling what
[1:41:48] our God will do
[1:41:49] Hallelujah
[1:41:53] see if we let go see it's safe to stay
[1:41:56] reserved
[1:41:57] it's a safe thing to stay reserved
[1:42:00] has this not been announced
[1:42:01] oh okay I wasn't here happy birthday
[1:42:04] Joshua God bless you I think
[1:42:08] God bless you
[1:42:09] amen Margaret and Claire God bless you
[1:42:11] welcome Hallelujah
[1:42:14] amen happy birthday say happy birthday
[1:42:15] praise the Lord but you see now there's
[1:42:18] no telling CeCe the devil makes people
[1:42:21] think it's safe to stay reserved people
[1:42:22] are afraid to actually surrender to the
[1:42:24] Holy Ghost
[1:42:25] they're actually afraid that's why
[1:42:27] people that's why people actually speak
[1:42:28] against the gifts because the gifts
[1:42:30] require a full surrender for God to come
[1:42:31] down and use that person you see they
[1:42:33] say well let's just keep Church order no
[1:42:35] church order is actually a full
[1:42:36] surrender to the Holy Ghost and let God
[1:42:38] begin to move and that's why he fights
[1:42:39] worship because if we can get beside
[1:42:41] ourselves forget about our problems and
[1:42:43] what else going on what people are doing
[1:42:45] around us and worship God then God can
[1:42:47] come down and manifest himself how he
[1:42:48] wants
[1:42:50] amen amen praise the Lord let's um let's
[1:42:53] stand who's who's ready to go beyond the
[1:42:55] camp amen say Lord I want to go beyond
[1:42:57] the camp of my comfort zone and what
[1:42:59] people say and this and that more I want
[1:43:01] to go unto you Lord I want to walk with
[1:43:03] you in the power of your Resurrection
