========================================

I wanded far from the fold [music] where I was safe. And it wasn't long [music] till I found I'd lost my way. And I cried with fear as the night [music] began to fall. One more [singing] lost lamb. Then I heard the shepherds call. [music] He [music] saw [singing] my steps as they walked right [music] into the dark. And though I went astray, [singing] I never [music] once left his heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [singing] That [music] night long ago, [singing] how I still recall [singing] when I lost [music] my way. I heard the shephers call. And he left the fold to [music] search out that one last. [singing and music] Thank you, Jesus. He [music] left 99 for there was one to be saved. And there on that ledge, one step [music] would have entered it all. But I felt the hesus and I heard the shepherd's call. Oh, [music] [singing] because [music] he saw my steps as they walked right into [singing] [music] the dark. And though I [singing] went astray, I never [singing] once left his heart. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And that [music and singing] night long ago, how I [singing and music] still recall [singing] when I lost [singing] my way. I heard the [music] sheepers call. [music] And that night long ago, [singing] how I [music] still recall [singing] when I [singing] lost my way. I heard the shepherds [music] call. [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; [applause]
