Masters because she wasn't the only one seeing that is like coming the whole city did and she was standing there knowing that she will be redeem and saved from this attack and by the time the seventh day rolled around and the walls broke there was a single house and whoever was in that house that house was saved because God saw their token and he honored that and that's that's what I wrote it doesn't capture a full tower to our sermon but it spoke to me that night I had no idea how to write the song and in 40 minutes the Lord just poured it onto me and I will sing it to you [Music] [Music] she was sitting by her window looking towards the Rising Sun she had seen the people coming from miles and miles away [Music] but a promise has been given to the one with a scarlet rope just hang it

everyone here in the house of the Lord let's just turn to first Corinthians chapter 11 and we're also going to go to mark chapter 15 so 1st Corinthians 11 and we read verses 1 down to verse 16 and then we're going to mark chapter 15 you're going to read verses 15 to 20 it says now I praise you brethren that you remember me and all things and keep the ordinances as I deliver them to you but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man and the head of Christ is God every man praying or prophesying with his head covered dishonest as head which is Christ but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth he'd uncovered this Arthur ahead for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her be sure also be sure but it would be but if it be ashamed for a woman to be shorn or shaven let it be covered for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this course or the woman to have power on her head because of the angels nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as a woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman by all things of God judging yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her here has given her for a covering but if any man seem contentious we have no such custom neither the Churches of God it's got a mark chapter 15 and we're going to read verses 15 to 20 and so pilot willing to contend the people content to the people release Barabbas with unto them and delivered Jesus whom he which when he had scourged him to be crucified and the soldiers led him away into the Hall called Pretoria and they called together the whole band and they clothed him with purple and planted a crown of thorns and put it about his head and began to salute him saying hail King of the Jews and they smote him on the head with a reed and had spit upon him and bowing their niece worshipped him and when they had mocked him and took off the robe from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him let's pray gracious father Oh Lord as we read these words father Lord how people would come and worship you yet mocking and crucifying you father I just pray you just take these words and lord I pray you're sinking into every heart this morning father may we be attentive today as has already been prayed father may we receive what you would have seen today Lord all of us including myself especially Lord we ask that you would be worth the fry whole family also in Arizona Lord and brother Kristin sister Cherith as they fear well Lord their son and brother Lord at noon today father may you be there at the memorial service father be a witness I pray use them as a witness Lord those who don't know you Lord draw them yes father Lord and draw them in Lord don't just draw them but Lord bring them all the way into you father may you grant it for your glory bring healing to the family as well well pour in your oil and wine Lord pour in your love Lord comfort them Lord you're more than a scripture Lord they need more than a nice scripture saying you're a comforter I need you in reality we thank you Lord that you have been very merciful and a strength to them at this time but Lord especially at this moment Lord father may you grant it for your glory bring them safely home to us as well father when they travel and father bless our time in your presence Lord and Christ's name we humbly ask amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats this morning now we read we read two very different kind of scriptures there but I want to continue on my thought about divide and conquer but especially influence now both these scriptures who read seem quite different but they show the influence that leadership has upon our lives and we took a family structure there and if we would we could read Apostle Paul you know in the book of Ephesians how he goes from the you know the the husband is the head and the wife is underneath in the children underneath it but that's the structure of the family and it is the influence of those in leadership or the headship of the family or the church or the group whatever it is that influence manifests and the people below them you take an army for example you know the will of the king or the general is manifested in the troops efforts to invade this place or to beseech this place or burn this place down you know they just give the order in the troops go and do it I mean so it's the influence of the of the of the command is a very powerful thing now we read here about a a band of soldiers where they had a band in the Bible hear from me this is from Smith's Bible Dictionary a band is referred to as a tenth part of a legion that was called a cohort which numbered between 400 to 600 men so when it says and they called the whole band together it wasn't just one or two soldiers like you see maybe in a picture Bible it was between 400 and 600 men and they were gathering in a hall at a place for the praetorium which is where the soldiers lived in and there was a courtyard or Hall in the middle of it and they were gathering to do one thing they were gathering to worship they were gathering to have church they were gathering to have a have a service that's what they were doing it sees that they they worshiped him they brought the word they brought the word of their myths they invited him he came amen they didn't force him to go to every there's no man take my life I lay it down he allowed it to happen and when everyone someone invites God to come he comes but it's our response to him when he's present that makes the world of difference hallelujah here was four hundred men and the Centurion or whoever's in charge said now we're gonna have a service today boys he comes the lamb I so move with us same thing could be sings here they had a chance here was the lamb that they needed here was the one that they needed to be the hit of their house the head of their army Oh Lydia the Prince of life and they had an opportunity I mean they went somewhere else in the Empire they were there I mean not many people knew that God Himself was made flesh in the day an hour not many people in the world knew about it but here they were I mean that were maybe they weren't born in the Middle East I don't know maybe they're from Italy or some other part but God allowed them to be there in that season amen and they took him and they worshiped them it was a mockery it was a mockery many people do it today this is the lose my home cracks of my service because of influence they take the word they could deliver them they could heal them they could set them free of the conflicts or pain or they pasta their unforgiveness and they mock him they crucify you they do it today people do it today and don't don't go don't think beyond the four walls I bring it in here this is a judgment house judgment starts at the house of God this is the house of God amen they took him they weren't willing to lay down people are willing to give up the bitterness well they weren't forgiveness I mean oh they complexes if they lay down their armor they laid down their shields they surrendered oh my things would have ended up very different for the but they hail them King of the Jews what do people do in churches and their life oh Jesus you're my king no you're no he's not do you reject them you mock him you saw I'm a Christian your life will prove of you're a Christian and all I'm in the very life you live people stand people say they're Christians and what are they saying they say the power of the Cross produces what I live and people live all kinds of lives they wear all kinds of ungodly filthy things they do all kinds of filthy things and they're mocking God they're mocking the power of the Cross they're mocking Redemption they're taking them and crucifying them and their very lives they are people do this Church has a black name or wherever people know about this place they say oh is a fanatic bunch of fanatics it's a cult stay away from those people they follow some man someplace or they follow Jesus here's the Word made flesh we follow this as we make flesh we follow Jesus the word we don't follow am and I say that photograph it's the color firing the photograph that makes it important it's not the man it's the pillar fire speaking through the man brother Branham says in the indictment he says they crucified the Word made flesh and that thing and now they crucify the God manifesting through the flesh in this thing amen that's what people do they take they say have nothing to do with those people what are they doing they're taking the effect of what Calvary should achieve they're taking what Calvary should achieve and they're crucifying it they're killing it's influence of the people but they're worshipping Him they worship God in a mockery in a hatred they weren't adoring him they were there to say have the highest place Oh God he was in the last few hours of his earthly journey and they took him they made a mockery and they crucified him and they despised him and he was the lamb it says we he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes we were healed and he was living in the moment with that manifestation it was being released hallelujah Healing was being released the briefly the test our lovely iniquities the peel released Oh God and they made a mockery all my friends think about it for a second is what they do let's say will not have this man rule over me all that Evers man away with such a fellow they did know what the prince of life they would not have the one that could save them they were too proud in their religion that you're proud of their belief what in campus's take the high priest commons and say you're the hype Oh God and here's a trial why did they say what did they look at what he did all he did was raise the dead heal the sick deliver the demon-possessed that's all he did in Canada's children people walking in darkness and what is he doing today only does is heal the sick raise the dead bring stability Allah will reward him Oh God that's all he does he doesn't do anything bad he doesn't do anything wrong again they say will not have him will not have this rule over us and they fashion an idol and they make a mockery that's what people do but I say do not put it beyond these four walls we are not to compare ourselves with anyone else they are not our absolute they are not our measuring stick he is our measuring stick I don't care what other people do what is it today follows out him follow down me and my family rejects them I'll walk with Him and you will reject them I'll still walk with her and the whole world turns him down I'll take him hallelujah who cares what people say they're just one family says Rajendra mum and dad say I'm not trying to please them I want to please him hallelujah take up your cross and follow teach and it's worth it all hallelujah but they would not have him that hair rather have some man some century some you think of Pilate God's mercy to Pilate he didn't just have Jesus's presence what yet it twice because he is from Galilee but then here it's in the back yeni could not find I find no fault in this man I find their fault they says I just tried to wash my hands you cannot wash your hands you can know what my hands of the blood of Jesus Christ you could not what'd he say you be governor you take that you take the throne but they knew who he was they were not crucified they would know crucified the Prince of life did you say well they had to do that what do you want to fulfil what part of the word do you wonder fulfill their scoffers that said that would rise in the last day saying where is the sign of thy coming the world has continued as it has is his presence a man he came down on the Ohio River as John the Baptist hit to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will foreigners shaken coming amen and the God that moves among us I mean it's not hit and miss that he comes down it's not a hidden mysteries quicken you I mean it's not just some random thing that you wondered into I mean the God has ordained this I think God has been brooding over the earth only here he was the end of his earthly journey they could have you know they could have got messy how different it was to the woman with the alabaster box I'd never do it was to the woman with the alabaster box she wasn't invited to the feast but something pulled her telling pulled her she knew hey Jesus Jesus had a bad name he was not well thought of when he began to say I am he when he begin to reveal himself saying I am the I am the word these words they've made be made flesh this scripture is fulfilled in your ears you would think you would think how crazy it is when a man would come and stand in the church and he would open the scroll to Isaiah and you'd say the Spritle Lord is upon me Lord has anointed me I mean to preach preach preach the acceptable year of the Lord - to your scene at liberty them that are bruised and heal the brokenhearted you know a sea is this day the Scriptures fulfill and if they weren't proud in their religion they could have sent back and said well what's happened in his meetings that's exactly what's happening why did they not gather around well then I say here's the one here's the one who considers free amid this animals this that's the sacrifice we do what good does it do they don't think if they didn't think about it if they were like Gideon arrow said if God is with us we're in the miracle where's the one who was with Joshua where's the Wonder was with Moses where's the one of Mount Carmel with Elijah where is he they didn't think that they said no we're just going to plow on because they are too proud oh we're Abraham's seed we have the Torah where the traditions and Jesus said woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites and he pronounces seven woes upon them of Matthew 23 you say well that's not nice God is love brother bear him and the Misses Shalom he speaks about the condole priest cuz you got to look at back and do it you say there's nice people out there yeah there's nice people everywhere but being a nice person doesn't give you a ticket to heaven I mean brother Brown would speak in Shalom you'd say says there's a young fellow around here by the name of Jesus of Nazareth speaking now in the in the juice juice they have nothing to do with them now this is insanity this is insanity right here here's the very God that the scripture said would come even his forerunner said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way thought he quoted the scripture from Isaiah saying this is me and if they really sat down and said well if this is him that he's going to introduce the very Messiah we're looking for I'm going to hang around here you listen to what he says I'm gonna follow the man he points out hallelujah that's what they should have done but because of their religious pride because of a because they were not willing to humble themselves to the scripture they crucified the very Prince of life he says now who's first what does our Bible teach us God is love who was the first when you're born you're kind old priest that's right who come to you when you as a need didn't have no money loaned you some money you're kind old priest exactly who put his hand on your shoulder and mothers shoulder when you was about to separate and prayed you back to God your kind of priest who was it that who was it took sides with you when you and your neighbor wasn't wasn't fussing and brought you back together in fellowship your kind o priest that's right who is it who as the as gonna say the last words going to say over you at the day out yonder who is it they let you lay there and rock but your kind old priest comes and blesses you and since the Word of God along with you your kind or priest what about this guy called Jesus of Nazareth you see what school that he come from your kind old priest had to sacrifice all of his life his grandfather was a priest his great great great great great grandfather was a priest priest he put his whole time in the organization he has trained to the word he knows what he's talking about but you see now we're talking about the fruit of the Spirit kind Lovejoy peace understand long-suffering patience he fruit of the Spirit what about this Jesus where did he come from we dem got a word than he ever came ever came out of any school all he does have tried tear up the schools that were built not much fruit of the Spirit is there he sees and humanly you'd say you're right he's trying to break out traditions he's trying to do away with the daily sacrifice he's trying to break up our you know break up the synagogues and break up all these things but our kind I'll preached these kinds old priest today kind o priests in every denomination but which one would you rather take a man who's got an education who can speak multiple languages we're fine ropes or do you or what have you have taken John the Baptist a man who stomped down to the wilderness clothes and camel skin eating locusts and wild honey probably never took a bath in his life that we know of and he began to preach new generation if I I'm in the axes late to the root of the tree every tree that doesn't bring forth fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire make way for the coming of the Lord now which one would you take oh let's go look at what these guys say about this one on Facebook this renegade John the Baptist who is this guy he tears down our religion he always preaches against us he preached against you know Herod and Herodias and all these different ones he's always breaking up trying to break up all these things but we're about love and acceptance and community amen edit but this guy's a renegade which one was the word makes me because that ultimately you go look back you got to go beyond human psychology and human emotion and you say which one is the Word made flesh which one would you take sides with because the sake ones who were the kind old priests they crucified the very Bryn's of life [Music] Pilate had twice the opportunity to be in the presence of the Lord he should have beg for mercy but he sold them to the dogs to try and keepers his standing in the community because he is worried well if I don't if I don't do anything with them then there'll be an uprising and then I'll get in trouble with the Emperor so because of social standing and worrying about what other people thought of him he tried to wash the blood of Jesus Christ off his hands he can't do it friends you know don't what is your what is your ultimate oh we're we're Christians we believe the Bible but what is influencing you the most because what influences either most is your absolute it actually is your God it is I mean what what you what you walk before look at your life just just look at yourself for a minute what is my what am I my how I conduct myself how I treat my spouse what I wear where I go the things I say the things I watch what are they you say but people will think I'm mad too I I'll just jump into this I'm not worried about these nuts but I had a dream a few months ago I was in a place I was in like Papua New Guinea which I'm going to in a couple of weeks and I was talking to a native man there and he was just here so he's a Christian of some sort near saying I just don't believe this serpent seed and water baptism and you know all these different things and I said I see if you only knew if you only knew the reality the reality behind it it's not doctrine it's more if you could only have the reality if you knew the reality behind and this word he begin to cry then I came back to this place came back to New Zealand and I saw three brothers walking around in shorts oh I mean to be believers I woke up so grieved o worker breathed I thought if they only why do people not get the reality it's not rules and regulations and a conformity there are spiritual principles behind these things when we have baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ we are telling this world the unseen world I'm buried with him I'm uniting myself with him you are telling the unseen world this is my I've taken aside I mean and people everywhere I reflecting one of two sides it doesn't matter if they're prostitute on the street cover their and make up and ungodly clothes or their religious person crucified in the word I met someone with a lust spurt being in church China trying to be a Christian you're identifying yourself you're telling the unseen world this is my side it's true whose side are you on today whose side remember just because you come to this place doesn't mean you're going in a rapture that has nothing to do with it it is a personal walk between you and God the scripture says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together so much as you see that they approach and it could be right now it could be tomorrow I mean really you're my precious wife I said sister's call up you who don't live here and they just watch the streaming and they're crying but finally we could be in their presence and they as our need a hook and they don't know what to do and we take it for granted my goodness we do we are spoiled how god spoils us you have any idea how good he is I mean a pour himself out I mean he keep us humble and yield it oh my goodness they take this for granted do they did not take his presence for granted oh just go next week it may not happen next week and then he may never blow through this place again the wind blasts worthlessness you cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes save it is when the spirit of low blows through the place Jesus said the wind does not always blow amen that's according to the scripture we should not take we should not take it for granted what he does for us we should never just make it common I'm in the atmosphere and I know he's present today and use it last week I mean the atmosphere we have in our homes hallelujah the evidence that you carry wherever you go do not take it for granted do not just say well this is just me and I'm just stumbling along I mean when he is present hallelujah do not take it for granted Oh Muffy people will give their lives to be in a place like this they would be in their life it says a name or say to live and let's read a scripture I think we take it for granted I honestly do I don't think we cherish what he does for us we are so privileged and this is all over the world I'm not saying we're special or unique amen as long as we're people on the beach I'm happy yeah this is expression you think you're the only people on the beach well as long as I'm on the beach I'm happy hallelujah hurry but people Amos Aidan 11 we take this for granted friends it's a prophecy and a mosh a more Satan 11 it says behold the days come saith the Lord that I'll send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but hearing the words of the Lord it says I'll send this famine and they shall wander from sea to sea and from North even to the east and shall run to and fro seeking the word of the Lord and shall not find it and that they shall the fear virgins and young men faith faint for thirst those are the ones that have this physical strength it says it's coming a famine we are living in this day this scripture is being looked down upon the earth people go on YouTube and I search church the church the church the church and I go to remind a bookstore they're trying to find and they're trying to find things they have a hunger and they try to find it and they can't find it they cannot find it it doesn't say a famine for Bibles or a famine for religion or a famine for churches but hearing the word of the law hallelujah it says they shall not find it and it value value you should we should be there are thankful people at all the way we should be so thankful and this time of famine he brought you in do not take it for granted do not take it for granted for a second brother Bram said if the bride really understood what he is that for her she'd be on her knees crying every day they take this place for granted do not take this message for grimy I mean you people would travel thousands of miles just to hear one service they would travel you go see he talks about people traveling from Georgia up to Indiana that's a long way in a car and they had worst cars and worse roads than we do and they would travel and they would sacrifice I mean the DAO family would follow him all around all around the country United States to hear and preach and they didn't fully grasp what he was saying but they knew the angel of God was there I'm in a newsie Messenger was there Oh God and we have it we have it available we have it available they take it for granted people and they would sit and far more uncomfortable conditions than this and they would sacrifice and their whole lives where I'm going to follow this I don't know where it will lead me but I know it'll lead me into heaven one day I'm gonna follow this worry and they sacrificed and gave of themselves what about you we are without excuse we are without excuse I mean it's in our languages I mean it's an over about six year old language of the earth I'm in its incurring and it's an English and Afrikaans and Spanish it's in every language we need and it's available and it's free there are times when people would get big reel-to-reel tapes and they would they would order one and so they have one in their house I'd listen to it that order for another one and then it had to basically exchange them all the time and wait for the next one to come and a loose tail mail and and the tapes are unfiltered - very hot you know some of the my handles do it was like that pretty much all of them and that's it there and they'd listen and not absorb it with that's great sacrifice then we have it here you say well there's a lot of other books that are good I'll tell you this these two anointings in this age it's two anointings you take Jesus's first coming there was Antichrist and there was him the Antichrist was religious it said good things it's the kind old priest yeah he said some good things some encouraging things but when it boiled down and it revealed what was in him he seat away with this man I'll not have this word roll over me I'll not have this word I will not have him crucified what season he hasn't done anything wrong crucify him I find no fault in this man crucify him who will you give us Barabbas or Jesus who should I release just my customer we want Barabbas we want a murderer later bracer murderer will welcome a murderer in trial Mets will have the prince of life yeah amen and that's exactly what people do today they say we will not fully surrender to this man and they say and they explain it away they explain Jesus ministry away that's right I mean Josephus year the other historians they see that Mary was impregnated by some soldier all these doc back names that we put over Jesus in and the disciples stole his body and they ate it and all these different things it's in history away with such a fellow thanks played them away that looks playing this away - brother I'm said if you're looking for saying to criticize the devil will give you plenty to criticize and there was the message remember the Jesus has hid in the common people heard him gladly he didn't speak in great big high Hebrew words he spoke like the common people and he comes a messenger of this day good evening friends and fetch and tote and carry and straw tick and sassafras experience and you know all these things you say who taught this guide of written and speak but it was God let's go through a man I mean and God makes himself so humble he makes himself so little because he's really what I see with your pride it better be dead cuz you're gonna become more humble than that you're gonna you got to humble yourself under him under the word amen we got it and so we're living in this time of famine and yet we have a band all feast do we do we really appreciate what we have what do you take it for granted now as I said about if we could really understand when we do anything we are signifying to the unseen world whose side you're on and brother BAM he was shot when he was 14 and he fell down to the regions of the lost and he saw those woman with the painted up eyes the cat cat eye makeup and groaning when he was 14 and then it's years later he's sitting there on the street escalator coming out of JC Penney store and he and he thinks he's back there again because it's now what he saw there as being manifested here upon the earth now you say that's pretty far-fetched that's just his idea I'll say what's his vision that was his vision that fascism and communism would rise Nazism you know all of us even made divisions that they all come to pass did Mussolini rise to power did he Theo P or whatever was fullest if we came to a shameful end and he's hanging up there in Italy by his feet him and his mistress and his people are spitting at him and mocking him he came to a shamefully I mean that Adolf Hitler rise in power amen in and in but then even he came to a mysterious in I don't know what happened to him you know some say that he'd killed himself in the bunker and the Russians burned his body or whatever more you know has has technology advanced do we have driverless cars I mean do we have the Catholic Church isn't power in America it is the supreme judge that the supreme court they're they don't they don't get reelected they're there for life that's Jews and Catholics there's no Protestant judges anymore I mean both both vice-president nominations in this last lecture were Catholic the whole place is riddled with it did he say it would come and it's here that he said he'll be great moral decay and we live in it did he say America would be smoke bombs and craters and it will be and it will be if those things are true those visions were true the vision he had of being an JC Penney store or the outside of it and being back in the region of the last that was true amen when he had the vision of the preview of the bride Oh onward Christian soldiers and he saw the first age go up then he saw every every nation come up then he saw this modern modern America or modern modern Christianity come up dancing to a leading buyer which to the beat of rock and roll basically naked and they go to a place and they go down and he stands he's saying is this Lourdes is full of gifts because you're worthy then he heard of the Christian soldier match against to the Bride of Christ and full array walking matching to the beat of the world but the end of the last the last few of them are going to get their eyes off without going and now looking at the worldly church and even getting to screen they're getting out of line hey screech stay alive get back at line cuz he saw me that ways was going and he came to himself I believe that vision is true I believe that as I say the Lord I believe God was showing us the vision and sight and it was the ones that thing in which you were getting off they were looking at the wrong thing stay alive who cares about what the world is doing in their religion and they sir you know the songs they sing producers the people that are in their congregation and I'm not condemning them but by your fruits you shall know them said judge righteous judgment she you should Melda discern between right and wrong daughters that yours it not because there's no great devil hides in great but there's no great it's not part-time Christian part-time serving the devil it's either full time and full time you got to look at what what is being produced well it's just a bunch of lust spurts their people expose their flesh men and women and it's a big performance and people are caught up in an atmosphere course is an atmosphere do you think there's not an atmosphere in devil worship well that's strong no we know if we went to a real voodoo priest a real genuine one and we sat in the service there would be an atmosphere there would be a real atmosphere it's not a put off there anointed by devils and they do their voodoo enchantments so you go to a place big massive what why does it have to be in black well has have to be black and smoke and light so you know at different things going on why does it have to be like that the gospel glows with the glory and purity of God Hollywood glitters we can't compete with them we don't want to go on their grounds why what are we wanting to produce do you want to produce a people that stay in line and go up you want to go up do you want to go down make your choice because you're like there's no there's no halfway there's no I'm just waiting here I don't want to mother Brown says in the sermon ashamed of him and I wish I had the video of about years ago that I had this clip from brother on Maleeva about this ecumenical movement and it was in to enter religion there was a and it's all using music together young people they have big concerts and they gather young people and unity and have this thing out on a stage this big picture of water big giant D jar in all these different faiths he was a rabbi preached Protestant religion buddhist everything under the sun they had their they had their glass of water nice and both be pouring it in saying we're of the same we're all the same and they're using music now to capture the young people and bring them and they were doing it and they are doing it and the Prophet said that the spirit of rock and roll will take the world to the battle great battle of arm again it will take them there amen it will and it is you say well what about us well if you go into the Battle of Armageddon you're not going in the rapture because the rapture happens before the Great Tribulation said sir amen so you say well I'll just go and you would never want to go into that place wild earth would you want a big here and there's no God here mercy shot and you're stuck in this place why would you even the Lord has given a way of escape if there's a call in your heart Lord I want you that's because he wants to take you out of this darkness hallelujah and you cannot buy that it is given that's why that's what many times we should just say thank you Lord you're calling me thank you Lord you're dealing with me there I am below thank you don't look at what you have to the case about what you have to give up I mean do you think the Apostle Paul when he was putting his neck down I mean there his head cut off do you think he really said I wish I was in the Bible school a bit longer oh I wish I talked to commandeer one more day you think you would have done that thank God there's a crowd Elena's a crown of life awaiting me there was and we'll see it put on him hallelujah he had no regrets I bet you the maddest I'd say you have to go through this you

you close your fluence are you know on whom you have belief oh let nothing can sway you I mean Dean on whom you have beliefs hey that goes through do you think quite just in a few moments I'll be in the friends to the one that I love and I had nothing can be to what we hear they had nothing there in the dark ages they had nothing could be to what we hear also gladly go many of them didn't even get tied to the stake stand here I'll be burnt and they gladly did it Oh aloo yeah they say well was it worth it was the worth to be half starving in some cold frozen freezing Rhett's come and try and eat your toes and fingers off when you're asleep yeah it was worth it hey was the worth being dragged in front of you take John Huss who's fishery church history here about John house it comes all he wants to do just like anyone he doesn't want to start a new church he wants to fix the Catholic Church this is 100 years before Luther if you wondering where he was and at the end of his life his friends had forsaken him he had no earthly friend he had no earthly backing and he didn't understand why are you doing this to me I just want to fix let's go back to the original and they burned him as a heretic he had no earthly friends and he was living in the dark ages hundred years after the Reformation started here he was what about you what about you and the persecution and the pressure that comes on you oh you don't have to wear that stuff you don't have to dress it says modest apparel and that word of power means a long dress have you read any Greek does anyone actually dig that's what it means Paul says we have modest apparel woman oh you shouldn't you know oh you shouldn't have have long hear that that word long we read in first Corinthians means to let grow it's not a physical link because otherwise the African sisters can never have it and cut here long you a meant long hair does not link its let grow and you're showing now I have been separated unto the Lord I'm a Nazarite Amen I've been separated under him say well it's just so and people say don't do that that's not the modern trend wear it with pride if God says it's a glory it's like what here's Mike I wouldn't be I'm in our where feet who you who's your absolute who is your absolute someone who says now that's ridiculous what do they know hey you should respect your family but if your family says you should get rid of these things and stop doing this I would say I'm following this I'm following this because this is going to give me a rap shot what are you gonna give me you cannot give me anything ultimately but they'll turn against me should we be surprised when we face opposition should we really be surprised when it's the ones closest to us at fight Amen we shouldn't be surprised we should expect it unfortunately but live a life live a life even if you don't see them maybe for years at a time so how you doing they're real good he's still the same I'm still are yo your zeal will burn out oh I'm into the full resource of the oil and it's fully amen my vessel never runs dry hallelujah you can't put this out I mean you can't stop it burning are you still full of zeal yeah I am oh oh no you just know I've heard some people say God help these people oh you'll you'll cool down after a while and I think that may be your testimony but I don't want what you have I don't want what you have I want to be and I believe it's been ten years ten years ago I met them and I think I'm more what they would say crazy and fanatical now I was back then hallelujah and I pray God burn on and online Alleluia we don't need to just plateau and the people just want you just to come to church Oh kept tough some religious all yes and yes and the prophets see this here and the bomb no it's not just that it's gotta be burning it's going to be living it should expand hallelujah it's how it should be yes and yeah but people say oh you just simmer down no burn on Holy Spirit burning me hit my heart of fire we are not called to leave our first love we are not anointed to leave our first love we are actually anointed to be more in love with our first love every day yes every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before passing moment I love him more Jesus say that keeps me for he's the one I'm waiting for hallelujah I trust that your testimony I mean oh wear with pride sisters wear it with pride it's your glory I'm gonna read so I can find it see it's a spiritual thing I can find this this is this is my darling wife's testimony the first part of it it was early in 2007 when I became very tempted to cut my hair although I knew it was wrong this is her words and theirs on our website if you want to go read it and I've been taught that log here and the Bible means uncut here which it does that would long me select wrote at that time in my life I was struggling with a few worldly things in several sisters I knew had begun to trim they're here and I heard every excuse as why it was okay so eventually I decided I trim I hear but when I went to do it I felt so convicted that I decided I'd first asked God to clearly show me if I shouldn't cut it at all and if he didn't answer me I would cut my hair the following week this is God's tremendous grace I think it was two days later I had a dream where a man was chasing me with a knife and had me cornered and tried to stab me but I was unable to touch me with it though even though he's stabbing wildly towards me then a voice said to me he can't touch you because of my own cut here the next night I had another dream now this is the significance I had another dream I saw myself holding scissors about to cut my hair and all around angels were crying and pleading for me not to cut it saying they only have authority to protect me if my hair is uncut and suddenly realized though I can't write it in words what it would mean in the unseen spiritual world if I cut my hair and I started screaming my self don't cut it please don't cut it needless to say I didn't cut it so the unseen world we have our see before this angels around the angel of the Lord which is God himself and kemp's about those who fear him and delivers them amen so the believe of that is fully separated to him hello I trust I trust you could say that is me I've sold out everything I've strained and I know I've surrendered and I want it all my hardest hello if you're fully surrendered to him he's like now you have now you go bodyguards now you've got protection we just see we just see on the street the influence of the demonic power and they put it out especially beautiful woman and it's lust it's not real beauty and if we could see if we could see the spirit that is actually anointing that person we would run a million miles I think it was I may get the brothers there or there's some brothers in Australia and they went out to a restaurant and the waitress comes up and well so I started eating and a waitress comes up and then this brother looked up and he actually saw the lust diamond on this on this waitress and he instantly threw up in his food and they just left if we could actually see and because they say oh that's beauty no it's not beauty it's lust and the world has exchanged lustful love amen and when people say well the spark is gone it's actually maybe the lust is gone and you actually need to say well let's go back to when we really loved each other for who we are amen you got to go back to that place you can go back to that place it's if we really understood and then so now so in the unseen world angels are sent to protect those who are separated to God hallelujah so we are we have we have the best secure in the world amen we are looked after in a tremendous way and then and then the rest of the story as we know is he's after about three or four weeks after this it was strangely quiet at work and I work on my family business to the knife shop selling knives about 4:00 p.m. there wasn't a person in sight when a drunk crazed man staggered in swearing and shouting and that he was going to stab me and kill me he was very worked up and angry and use extreme foul language I looked at him and suddenly realized that this was the same man who had unsuccessfully tried to stab me in my dream glory to God I mean and I felt such a peace and just looked straight at him knowing he could do absolutely nothing to hurt me he suddenly went all nervous and ran out and a few seconds later he walked back and said sorry about that lady then left now if you've been to that shop there was no way she could have run there's no way she could have run the counter and there's the back wall and the only way to get around the counter is over there and they're only doors as where he was standing there's nowhere to hide there's nowhere to hide but God was showing that to say I'll look after you if you're separated to me yeah Amen hallelujah so and then there was the time just before we got married all we got engaged she's walking through the park and there's an ambush said it sickly for her there's a man with a dog she walks up to them anew and then two or three other men jump out the bushes and they think now we've got her then she felt that same power come down that they'd surrounded it which is the dog out of the way and keeps walking on and they do nothing what is there because in the unseen world identified with you Lord Jesus or Lord Jesus I'm identified with you remember he's our husband he's our protector he's our provider I mean he's our shield he's our fortress I mean he's our strength he's our captain Harley he's our protector he's a jealous God I mean he will he hate the devil tries to get a hold of one of his children he will fight the battle hallelujah all because of protection because she was walking down there hello fire was there hallelujah my friends those what would they have done well she played she might have been killed in the knife shop and if she survived that within she maybe could have been brutally raped in the park but she had protection but yet the world would say that's crazy for letting your head like this well I'll tell you what if you are here and then there was that lady member head that worshipped oh my poor brother endings there was that lady there and anyway when I'm at work I get this text or this phone call Christine says that lady at the worship pump she came over to the house and so she came to English she just started attacking and are you just a bunch of bramma night brand of mites and there's nothing real there's just all rules and stuff and then and starts wearing it all these things Christine just starts to testify about these things God comes down the woman runs out of the house and and Tara leaving even her handbag there amen oh that's just for her do not let that unbelievable get him to here well that's just her and her walk that is just unbelief because it's for everyone who serve a will they become richer whosoever will never just say well that's that person that's just the devil actually saying I don't want you to have it because because if he knows if you actually if you could only see the reality of this living word amen if we just grasp the reality of it you would say Lord Rock of Ages cleft for me myself have a shelf in me if we could really see the power behind it amen and one of the Chiefs hallelujah hey you say well there's nothing I can do this wrong it's all the perfect will of God don't lean too much or man in first Chronicles David decides to bring the ark into the city and here's a man who's anointed remember I just maybe you know don't walk just just plowing on ahead Paul says that least I become he says he says I want to walk in such a way not not with uncertainty I mean I want a therefore so Rand Paul says not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep my body and bring it into subjection least there by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway he knew that that could possibly happen to him so he walked in such a way he says I don't want that to happen I so run remember we are not presuming there's nothing there is nothing in this when it comes to what God likes and what God doesn't like and our relationship with him there's nothing that we're guessing it there is nothing he is laid out everything how the family should be how the husband should treat their wives wives husbands how would you treat the children and forgive me I'm not getting gonna get into that today maybe next time you know all those things and all those things are in the message and the earlier messages he talks about influence and and and dealing with children and how you treat your wife and the atmosphere you have in your home and all those things all the family I need I need you know people go get marriage counseling books those things may be okay but it's all in the work it's all in the message you just got to dig you just got to dig it and look we have such programs people never used to have such programs they would they would listen and most of the books are not even printed anyway they would listen that write things down and that in that and they'd form like quote books about certain things so don't have to fool them they just have a search program what do you want to find out about [Music] you should look into these things this is not a Catholic this is not you know we can't just rely on ministry to dig into things and look into things for us this is not a Catholic institution where the priest will tell me I'll let the priest find out for me no you dig into it yourself you dig dig this this up yes there is untapped resources in the Word of God I'm tapped what does that mean no one has ever dug into it no one has ever looked into it no one has ever refined it I mean no one has it so we got to dig in and look ourselves you say well I only have 24 hours in the day what eternal value a lot of things we do have no eternal value a lot of things a vain things yeah a lot of things we do you know oh but I I just need some me time why don't you make it God time brother mcgi he always went hunting nothing wrong with hunting but he went they'd have communion with God yes that was his main that was his main objective of going hunting and fishing is to spend time with God there's your hobby and what you do does it bring you closer to God what is it what does it produce can you do it can you take Jesus to the places you go there's some places he says I don't want to go there oh but I'm going there well maybe you shouldn't go there consider think on your ways children and Sir David and first Chronicles now he wants to bring the arkin and he consulted the captains of thousands of hundreds and every leader and then all the people said yep let's do it let's get the arkad in but some people think I can do nothing wrong and then so they have a great they they you know so they put the ark on a new cart and they begin to bring it into the city and they shout and they sing and they dance with all their might and they're excited about what they're doing but it's not that David was presuming that's how you bring the ark into the city he was presuming Oh God God will overlook my mistakes God does not overlook our mistakes God is not a doting grandfather it just is off I don't see you doing that yes you love me I know he sees everything we do we can't just take for granted oh nothing you know it's it's God's grace and mercy it is God's grace and mercy but God's grace and mercy is not him putting blinkers on and ignoring what you're doing the same god of the Old Testament you know we're seeing there's no God like Jehovah well Jehovah became Jesus so the same God in the Old Testament it's the same God in the New Testament what he hated in the Old Testament he hates in the New Testament and people will go on about gay marriage and how it's you know all those things it's an abomination in the Old Testament and God doesn't change and you God see it's an abomination for a woman to wear a man's garment and if it's abomination to him there it's the same here whether he liked it or not well that's that's that's old-fashioned thinking I say it's eternal thinking and I'd rather have eternal thinking let this mind that was in Christ be in you so they begin to play they begin to shout they begin to dance it was a big time and they were excited and they were sincere but the ark was coming the wrong way the ark was he presumed this is how we should do it why did he do it that way because it came out of the Philistine land on an ark I mean on a cat what they do they put it on a cart put on gave their offerings of gold and things and they sent it on its way and the oxen just walked into Israel to a certain place I thought this is how we'll do it but it wasn't according to the scripture he was just presuming even his sincerity he was wrong he was trying to do God a service without it being his will and you know there is a story is the man who tries to stand in the Yaak because he doesn't want it any harm I'm gonna protect this word I'm gonna keep it work and he died it's a David's actions cause one good man to die even in his sincerity we should just plow on friends don't just presume there's a question mark don't do it it may be right but you've got to have you got a search and say God is this right so don't do it if there's a question mark you say well that means I won't be able to do anything in life no God will lead you God will take he'll guide you don't just presume I'm under the blood everything's fine David was anointed king and he was king at that time he was adopted he was adopted into the body right and of course there's one man to die and here we are today don't presume anything if you haven't listened to the sermon trying to God a service vows will you go listen to it and you got to put it on on your lap yeah cuz it's no good saying yeah they're wrong what about here who cares about them we're not under their covenant and there'll be some of them that go to that that go to the Great Tribulation and give their lives to Jesus and they get no salvation of the white throne judgment but that's not what we call - this word is not calling people to go into a tribulation this message was sent to take a people up into a rapture to do a means of don't worry don't worry about them if they turn it down you say God bless you go on don't deed Christianize them you know sure some of them they'll take the mark of the beast they'll hold on to your religion like think that it is first coming and whatever more but what is it to thee i thinkin about myself this is my life this is my eternal destination I don't want to just take this casual and I want to just know it's just this just walk on Oh everything oh she'll be right and now to work out and no no do not presume anything Amy do not presume anything wish the PISA sister come you don't presume anything that's why we take it back today what are you doing with this Jesus called Christ what are you doing with this revealed word if you listened to the indictment sermon brother fights he actually proves that they have crucified the word again today to their congregations and that's the same as the soldiers they crucified and they say today by holding on to their creeds and dogmas and the traditions well I was taught this way this is how it's always been listen who says it's right that's why it's so much easier for someone who has no religion whatsoever to come in and just embrace the truth because there's not all this religious falsehood that they're going to be purged of oh but those people are good people in that church yeah they might be good people I'm not condemning them but what are you called to do what are you called to be amen don't let your life become a mockery of him whatever you do when you see those soldiers I pray your life is not producing that same kind of how King of the Jews they beat him and they spit on them and they mock them put a crown of thorns on his head don't join that number well how do I do that no that's not true I'm not gonna do that I don't accept that let's say you killed the effect of the word and parents do it - children children do and assess what the parents do in moderation Amen brother BAM told yo it says about Elisha he's there and and 42 children come out of the village and they say go up bald head go up all did they make fun of him because Elisha had been raptured before this and and anger came upon the Prophet and two she bears came out of the woods and killed the children now you say well that's a gift use Rob sure it is but what influence caused the children to go say that it was the parents talking about the Prophet and their harm and the influence came upon the children and the children died oh how did this happen what are you talking about it hurt what-what-what-what influence you putting upon your children yes think about it you have to remember for us to walk in victory individually it's not a haphazard thing you know Israel they conquer the land drive out the enemy they shouldn't be like wow how did this happen I didn't you know this is no they should have said yes we have rallied around Joshua Joshua received his commission meditate upon the whole Word of God you'll be successful he has been stayed true to his Commission and because he stayed true we rallied around it as leadership we took our promised land it snow wasn't a haphazard thing they didn't say we'll try this trying snow they they rallied around the gift and the gift today is the Holy Ghost they rallied around him in their day and they took the lamb so it shouldn't be a you know I'm sure God's grace has to fall upon our families absolutely but it shouldn't be a such a strange thing well how come they're serving God well how come that one got baptized well how come this happened how come this family how did they end up so good it shouldn't be it shouldn't be a mystery you understand what I'm saying friends GG this day I'm not going to call it altar call but just talk to him say Lord I don't want to mock you remember worship is not just here every day your life is a worship to God everything you do everything everything you do is a worship you say Lord I don't want my life to mock you saying one thing how King of the Jews and crucifying him again let's bow our heads in a word of trishul let's sing that song hide me now under my wings gracious Lord Jesus father I just pray Lord that you take these words Lord I prayed that we would meditate upon them Lord we don't want to be Lord that ground
