Lord Father in Jesus Christ's name lor we commit the service into your hands amen and amen amen hallelujah amen thank you brother Indy hallelujah it's not the good old days glory and those good old days are still burning on Alleluia amen so good we don't we rejoice when we look in the rearview mirror but then we rejoiced as we're looking forward to Alleluia I mean happy birthday brother our man a man hallelujah I mean let's go to Saint John chapter 1 amen and we're gonna read verses 34 down to 36 good to see everyone out on this night I mean God bless you all who's happy to be a Christian hey Lou yeah hey man I'm happy and I saw let's just go from verse 32 say of John 1 and John be record saying I saw the Spirit two sitting from heaven like a dove and abode upon him and then you have naught but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me whom upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw him be record that this is the son of God and again the next day after John stood and and two of his disciples looking upon Jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of God I mean may you I made a little bit of good you may be seated tonight now I want to if I could take a bit of a thought tonight I want to preach on I don't I want to preach on Jesus knew who he was you know who you are you got to know who you are brother Brown would say in perfect faith that Jesus knew who he was therefore he could have perfect faith now here it's amazing you see John as we read there as he watched them walk he said behold the lamb of God as he looked upon Jesus he walked he saith behold the lamb of God now Jesus as I said had faith in who he was now he was he was God made flesh when the announcement of his birth came they were instructed you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins and the prophet Isaiah when he saw eight hundred odd years from the time he was standing upon the earth and he saw the Redeemer coming says you shall call his name Emmanuel I meant God with us now if he is he now he was the Lamb of God now a lamb God's lamb has certain you could say characteristics or things that go with it remember Jesus I'm going to it do you know who you are Jesus knew who he was now if he was the Lamb of God therefore he was the perfect sacrifice without sin remember he knew who he was so he knew he was the Lamb of God it is for this course I've come into the world so he knew that he was the Lamb of God he knew he was God's propre Shi ation for sin so therefore if he was he had to be a spotless lamb I mean he had to be without blemish without anything that could be held against him and when Pilate now you know when he went through his great examination in a pilot's judgment Hall you know Pilate came to the conclusion I find no fault in him I mean so he was examined yo false false witnesses came up against him all all manner of things but when the judge gave his verdict he says I find no fault in this man so Jesus now he was he was the Lamb of God's he was a perfect sacrifice without sin and he was examined and found to be that way by man now also he was the second Adam so as the first Adam lost at all the second Adam would redeem it all now the first Adam had Dominion God and in Genesis when when when twin wet when man was created by God God told them now he said he said be fruitful and multiply replenish the earth subdue and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth so they had total dominion over creation now if they had total dominion over creation that anything that came into their realm to try and upset it they had dominion over that thing and so now Jesus now being the second Adam he proved that he had power over nature amen he cursed the fig tree and it didn't bring forth any more figs when when he was asleep in the boat and brother Bram says ten thousand demons swore they drown him that day on the Sea of Galilee and there was now a contest now who really wasn't charge of nature I mean because the devil believed now I'm in control but here was a man who who is maybe he wasn't too tall there's nothing when you when we saw him there's nothing of him that we desire him but he was the crater and flesh a man and and his disciples are welcome don't you know we're going to perish and he stood up and he looked at thee looked at the wind and the waves that he made and he just said peace be still holy he didn't make a big show of it he just said a few words and instantly the storm ceased I mean creation obeyed it's crater hallelujah amen so now he was proving now he was a seeking atom because he was now exhibiting everything that the first Adam did now the first atom when he was standing in his position as a son of God having dominion over the earth there was no death so so Adam could not show that he was ruler over death but now death came into the creation so because the second Adam had dominion over it he could call back the dead back to life again all sickness had to leave amen all manner of diseases had to go every devil had to be cast out nothing could stand before the second Adam hallelujah because in you who he was Amen so now he so he now had power and he demonstrated that power yes hallelujah but also because he was he was the son of God not only did he show that he had dominion over the devil in this realm but when he when he died on the cross and they put his body in the tomb Amen he showed I have power all power in heaven and earth and he went down into hell and privily had dominion over hell and and the death that you know the grave couldn't hold him I mean hell couldn't hold him hallelujah he just went down there to prove to Satan this is me Amen you've you've been waiting for me to come being trying to stop me to come you couldn't stop me coming here I am and now I'm in control a means that he proved now that he had dominion glory to God I meant because he is the second Adam I meant so Jesus knew who he was Jesus believed me but he was a man me but Jesus was he was totally God but it was totally man he had to be totally God because no man could who could redeem the earth because we're all born in a fallen state not one of us could save another amen doesn't matter how holy we think we are all it doesn't matter any prophet amen because when John was there up in heaven waiting and he saw the book seal and he wept because he couldn't see anyone no man was found worthy Moses was there Elijah was there Joseph was there I mean all the prophets down through the ages were there but he couldn't he wept because in you if someone wasn't found worthy a man to be worthy to take that book amen to to to redeem back everything that had been lost everything was in jeopardy but in John was told weep not John he comes the lamb hallelujah and he stepped forth Amen to prove to prove that what he purchased on Calvary Amen that purchase was good enough he paid it in full then he steps forth hallelujah to lay claims on what belongs to him glory to God now if this is the case which it is then there has to be a people now because if here's the second Adam there has to be a second Eve I'm sure you've heard the message the masterpiece brother Bram speaks about your there was the perfect family in Eden there was the husband and the wife Adam and Eve they were God's masterpiece but then send kripp then and and broke the masterpiece down but then God he wouldn't be defeated how God won't be defeated holy you gotta have that it always in the back of your mind my God will not be defeated Amen he won't allow me to be beaten down and trodden and and and you know lost and undone he won't be defeated hallelujah if God has called you friends I mean if God has called me if God has spoken to me hallelujah there's a purpose of them speaking to me there's a purpose of him dying for me is a stealing me with His Holy Spirit I mean he's not gonna leave you in the hands of the devil or in just some battles some trent someplace he's gonna see you overcome hallelujah he will not be defeated I mean we will walk victoriously of this earth amen it has to happen Alleluia Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies concerning his first coming when he's here in the days of his flesh he knew the grade couldn't hold him as I said he was a man so that means he had their faith revealed faith he he knew who he was you know he wasn't trying to just hold on to a nice scripture when he went to Calvary he he was living out he was a prisoner to the word that was promised him he couldn't live any other kind of life I mean he knew he was the Lamb of God he knew he was the one I mean to redeem the earth and he knew his soul could not stay in hell because his body could not see corruption he knew it amen any went to Calvary with that one scripture with the sin of the world upon him as a sinner but in you I'm not going to stay there Allu yeah my body will not decay a lujah and that faith he says I have power to lay my life down of my power to raise it back up again no man takes my life but I give it freely hallelujah and he did exactly that now as I said God's masterpiece he was the masterpiece of the Old Testament brother bran would say that Jesus in the days of his flesh fulfilled the Old Testament and he says as as Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament the bride will fulfill the New Testament Alleluia oh I'll find the court later for you brother BAM speaks about it so he knew all the prophecies that he would fulfill and when he was walking with the two on the way to Emmaus and Luke chapter 24 he began to speak to them I'll fulfill prophecy in their day and they did not understand who he was but he it says he started at Moses and went from Moses and went all the way down through the scripture and meant to see if the people would understand if they would catch what is going on in their day an hour they had seen God do something they knew he is a prophet know many of us bake like this man they've seen him do incredible things but now it had to come a time where they just didn't look upon God doing things they had to become they're part of the vision a man where because the mystery the mystery of Jesus coming wasn't wasn't him coming in the flesh that was prophesied they will come but the mystery is Peter James and John I mean it two ways the woman that's actually you know the bride 120 in the upper room there was a prophecy I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh but who would fulfill that prophecy was the mystery so here was Peter James and John they were part of the first coming a minute on the way to Emmaus they were part of that resurrection hour but they had to go from seeing God fulfill it as a man to understand that now they become the fulfillment of the rest of them of the coming hallelujah that's why he walked with them and he began to open the scriptures to them because they had to understand you're part of this you're part of the resurrection you're in the resurrection I'm walking with you that you would understand you're part of this resurrection I mean because it wasn't just Jesus that had to be resurrected there's the people that had to be resurrected hallelujah and it's the same thing with you friend you got to understand why is this message become alive why is it precious to you why is it more than your next breath I mean why is it so important why is this this Bible so precious to you hallelujah because God is wanting you to see your part of the fulfillment of the word I mean God has to put on flesh to fulfill his work and he's gonna fulfill it through his bride Alleluia now he says here if I can find it now now let's just go the others a Vincent made clear by prophecy let's just go back a few minutes and now let's listen to the words quoted from himself watch the word quoted from himself watch here the word itself quoting the word of himself the word itself quoting the word of himself not tell them that he was that by just let the word speak for itself then they know who he was the letter of the word quoting the word the word and flesh quoting the word of the letter being fully identified with himself look here now let's listen to him quote now we know that they were all briefed on the late happenings that is of the crucifixion and of the story of the resurrection the tomb as we just read now you go Rick Lou your read Luke 24 they tell Jesus are you a stranger here you don't know what's been going on they said we believe you as a prophet he is crucified and and they say he's yo they they say he's risen from the dead again he they tell him men they don't fully grasp what's going on and then he begins to speak to them Oh falls and slow of heart and he begins to heat you know in these starts at Moses and now he goes straight to the word of prophecy about himself now let's just think what he said he said a lot more than this but watch remember he's got six hours he's going to give them a six hour sermon offer filled scripture there's a reason he's doing it he's not just he's not just wine to excite their minds but he's warning them as I said before to understand the reason that they have been their eyes have open to what's going on they weren't like the scribes and Pharisees they believe this is him right they believed there was him and they had to but Jesus himself had to come and take them the rest of the way to show they are in the resurrection and he has come as I see why is this so incredible why is this message so alive as God is just holding us down more and more to be more like him amen and we begin to see that we are part of the word amen that we are the Word made flesh today that God is fulfilling his New Testament through you through your life it's a now turn over to Zechariah 11 and 12 and wasn't the Messiah to be sold according to the Prophet for thirty pieces of silver you just said this man was sold for thirty pieces of silver turn over you're getting them scripture Zechariah living in 12 then he said did you notice that David said in the psalm Psalms 41 and 9 that he was to be betrayed by his friends than again in Zechariah 13 and 7 he was forsaken by his disciples and in Psalms 30:5 xi accused by false witnesses you said you just said he was isaiah 53:7 he was done before his accusers Isaiah 50 and 6 they scourged him the prophecy it sounds 22 he was to cry on the cross my God my God why cell for sake of me did he do that day before yesterday afternoon Psalms 22 a again 18 his garments were to be parted among them did they do that and Psalms 22 7 to 8 them mocked by his enemies the church Psalms 22 again there was not a bone in his body to be broke but they pierced my hands and my feet he said holding his hands behind him no doubt at a time isaiah 53:12 said he would die between malefactors isaiah 53:9 said he'd be buried with the rich Psalm 16:10 said I will not leave a soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption and was not Malachi 3 the forerunner of this man I'd like to I've heard him quote look at all the prophecies notice in all the types he might have went through about Isaac in Genesis how God overshadowed I am Isaac how father Abraham took him took his own son packing the wood up the hill and offered up his own son any-any and he just continues on you know six hours this day the Scriptures fulfilled amen and and the questions you know did he do that and they would have actually said yeah he did do that and then he cry my god my god was there for sake of me they would have said yeah he he I heard him I heard him say all those things and then now we've come down to this hour you say well why are you talking about these things because history has repeated itself I merely see was it that was in the days of Sodom as was the days of lot you know of Noah so shall it be when the Son of Man is revealed now that's Jesus being revealed again and you could ask the question you know did he send her did he send a prophet with the spirit of Elijah did he do that amen did he turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers did he do that amen did he reveal the truth of the word has he done that as all seven seals open has he done that Amen has he restored us back to the faith of the fathers has he done that has he become a living reality has he stepped out of history has he done that when he promises on the ever leave thee nor forsake thee has he done that I mean when Paul would speak about thee y-you know about the cycle of the rapture and about how the Lord Himself well this yo will descend with a shout has he done that I mean he says you're not children of darkness that they should overcome you but your children of the light 1st Thessalonians chapter 5 has he done that has you opened up your eyes of understanding holy has become a God of reality to you I mean it has he done that has he made this Bible live has he done that hallelujah why is he done those things you must understand you are part of the word I mean you are fulfilling the scripture I meant to be a to be a written epistle read known of all men there's more than just doctrine I mean but it's a life being expressed hallelujah Amen has he opened his word hallelujah is this row back in its homeland has he done that hallelujah yes he has Amen we live an incredible time now has he called the people out of every kindred nation and tongue has he done that there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all aflame virtually every language under heaven there's a believer that can say Amen when you say Amen and they know the same God you know hallelujah has he done that a man is he has he has he opened up his plan of redemption to us Amen that this is a new book personally to you has he done that Alleluia has he taken a bride for himself as he said he would I'll take her people for my namesake has he done it a man has he you know has he what the enemy is doing has he done that has he has he totally taken the cover off of Satan and his workings has he done that hallelujah has he declared his bride sinless a man has mr. fighter has he glorified or as he called her yes he's done that now when I say these things you'd say Lord you've done that for me amen that man's talking about me holy when you hear about the message you hear invisible union of the Bride of Christ and he talks about a sinless virtuous woman Alleluia I mean that she was trapped into it the other reason why we so we think of our pastor we get so shocked by it's because once upon time we weren't all that shocked by it but God gave us a new nature hallelujah I mean that's why sometimes it's not guilt it's just shock oh I can't believe I did that well the old you didn't do that any but the new you would never go near those things hallelujah amen has he given us a heart of taking out our heart of stone giving us a heart of flesh and a new spirit and then his spirit in the middle has he done those things hallelujah yes he's done those things uh is there a woman in the land that is made by his word has he done that well Alou you wear the most Bible believing people in the earth Amen he restored us back to the truth Alleluia you know this there's a person at work I work with and uh we might have there we need to look at the Hall but we're gonna maybe use the hall at the end of November gospel hall they see if we don't use this we don't allow funny people here like you know Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses your people that are on the Bible I thought my heart well you'll probably put us in that box because you got to put us in some box but we're the most Bible believing people there are Alleluia cuz he's turned us back to the truth the message reveals Christ in here Alleluia now the Bride of Christ they got okay so as I said Jesus had faith and who he was he knew who he was he wasn't you know he wasn't guessing maybe this is me or maybe this is what I got to fulfill he knew the word that he had to fulfill now if that's the case another I said he was the Lamb of God he was a sick in Adam and he was more than that right I just took two examples but he knew I have come to take dominion Amen I've come to take over I've come to Oh Satan what a man really can do in the hands of God because he's our example now if that's and then he was the lamb she was sinless he says I have no part in the devil he has no part in me a mint now if that's the case in the Bride of Christ has certain things as well but they're not of her own not of herself but the bride as I've said and we can read in here you go read Romans chapter 8 that whom he is called he's also justified whom is justified is also glorified who can late charge to God's elect it's God that justify you know so Paul begins to lay out some things there and the reason that you know Paul would be inspired to write those things as God is wanting to tell you this is what I think of you as the Bride of Christ you are a very special woman right and so now the bride is perfect the bride has a perfect sacrifice may I see it her everything she has is not of herself it's of him right but now because now this is where I came with this thought sometimes you know such a big challenge can be later I let well he believed who he was therefore he had perfect faith even know what about us and we begin to look at they say now how can I kind of climb this mountain this seems too big to kind of you know grasp or you know walk walk with if I can put it that way but then you've got to understand now if he has made you thus and he's given you things that you can do it all right is that right so now if the bride the bride has a perfect sacrifice now now did that go over why you got to understand so he has made as his mate as bride perfect she is sinless she has robed in his righteousness right she amen she is as righteous as God is righteous okay she has been fully justified as if you've never did it in the first place the first place was the mind of God right let's just read some scriptures revelations 19 revelations 19 will read verses 7 to 9 I know this is familiar to everyone but you got to see what you know you say I don't know if I can be the Bride of Christ has he given you the invitation and the reason I laboured so much in the star the service was he's walked with you modernly means to make clear by prophesy he walked with it - on the way to Emmaus - tell them they are in the resurrection and they begin to realize we are part of this resurrection because now we find ourselves going up into the upper room and now we find the resurrected one coming dwelling in us hallelujah so he walked with them that they would understand and know they are part of the fulfillment of the word for their day and the reason that this message has become so incredibly wonderful to you and it's more than life and it's become a reality is because he wants you to know it is because you're part of the word for this day yes okay and if you're part of the word for this day you are the Bride of Christ okay and he has made you thus you say well I don't have a big understanding if there's a little twinge in here hello everyone I'm looking I'm

linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God what does this message invitation come to the wedding supper you have a seat prepared for you Alleluia and as I've said for a few weeks ago it comes down in the parable he says get the good and the bed doesn't matter what state they're in if they're if they accept the invitation will furnish them with the garments and then will wash their feet hell are you'll wash all the muck and the your on the dirt and things that they you know this world has put on them as they walk through the darkness of this world and then we'll wash it off their feet we'll give them a new row holla we were annoyed them hallelujah at the stench of this world it's not even there anymore hallelujah and we'll place her in the highest place hallelujah I mean do you think the bride six sits down by the by the back door the fire escape and a big feast oh she's at the big table yeah we know it's one big table you got to understand but you're highly honored you're highly favored hallelujah so there's an invitation now so so her righteousness it was granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and what it's been granted to you remember the bride the bride has been given a few things what is the perfect sacrifice hallelujah there's a blood there's an offering and the offering hasn't you know it's not waiting to be offered it's been offered and it's been accepted hallelujah it's been given any and he said to Mary when he when he opened her eyes he said yo he spoke her I just love it where if you know she's there she ran to the tomb his body's not there and now she's troubled wisdom was the body of my Lord and he and and she sees now this is the morning of the resurrection she's troubled and she turns around she sees a man he's a young looking man now it doesn't she doesn't recognize him she thinks he's a gardener if you had those kind of things you know you're trying to look in here you don't really understand exactly may listen to a tape what is going on and then he speaks your name oh yeah this is one word it changes their whole life that's the law oh yeah hey man I'm happy as he called you by name you understand he may never physically see it out of Muenster rig but something you has worked called you happy birthday Aliyah amen and and you begin to understand he's not a God of history he's not a God of tradition he's not a God of denomination or someone else's God he's rezard and he's made himself known to me hallelujah oh and her whole life change amen and then now but but he says to her don't touch me yet I haven't ascended sacrifice had to ascend up hallelujah and then he came back down that said he said to Thomas now I love this verse because it just blows the Trinitarians out of the water because he because Thomas coz Thomas is I won't believe until even if I saw the I have to see the evidence and his hands in his feeding aside and then eat and then all the doors are locked up Jesus appears among them Thomas touch my hands and my feet put your hand in my side and his reaction was my Lord and my god hallelujah not not one person of the Godhead my Lord and my god hallelujah amen now hallelujah I love that oh sorry here he is now he's got to become that real to you they meant he's not he's a person he's a person he's not an idea he's a person hallelujah and he is his as real then as yesterday I mean when he appeared to Mary he can appear to you maybe in a different form but it's still the same one hallelujah now and he's doing all this because he wants them to know I died you saw me hanging between heaven and earth program said that Jesus when he's hanging between heaven and earth on the cross he's running a covenant with the families of the earth they didn't know fully comprehend what was going on there but but he himself made sure I'll tell you you're going to know and it's going to sink into your soul and you're gonna really rejoice as I've said maybe a while ago if they really knew here's the lamb he's carrying hallelujah he is he going up the hill with my sin on me up on his shoulders they would have been happy that'll be rejoicing boy hallelujah they wouldn't have been said they would have been rejoicing there he goes my son did he's carrying it away hallelujah where to god they didn't fully understand but they need no doubt he may be looked at them I'm gonna tell you you're gonna understand that's why I resurrect and he walked with them amen he wasn't gonna let it pass him by and passed by many people but there's a few he said I'll not let them I'll not let it pass him by hallelujah and now it comes let's go 2000 years down the road he steps out of history hello and he walks by your way do you understand what's going on I have no idea oh it's you hallelujah and he declares his word to you this is what's going on holy and not just to know that the world's going to be destroyed but you've got mercy at a time of destruction Halloweeny apart of the resurrection hallelujah Word of God hallelujah and he's still walking he walks with me and he talked hallelujah more than a first pull more than a second poll but a third polls I mean the third poll pulls the bride to himself hallelujah and his word went for I mean we're not caught up with the personality of a prophet we're caught up with the God that the prophet reveal Holly the word was revealed a man has pulled you a trusted has Amen there's more than just Church and this is what we do because my mom and dad do it but there's a pull it doesn't matter what the world wants to do it can pass me by here I come Lord Jesus just as I am hallelujah or to God hey me hallelujah to the lamb I mean John when he was there beyond the curtain of time boy and lift it up and do tyrannies brother mcjohn so John yeah that's why he was rejoicing that's why when the book was over he saw himself hallelujah as the same thing with us yes I've never seen a book physically open in that manner but something in his word that's why it goes beyond this I mean it may be your culture or ever you're from but it gives a hold of your soul I mean even if you wrestle with and I don't understand I don't know I mean just give yourself to him don't worry about don't worry about that I have to do this I've to do that it's not about that it's I come even so Lord Jesus I come hallelujah second Corinthians five and 21 for he hath made him remember the brightest perfect you look at yourself forget what you think of yourself just forget about it I mean take what God says about you for he had made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him hallelujah he was made sin what a credible transaction I'll take your place children I'll redeem you back to myself Alleluia that you would be made the righteousness of God in him therefore we can say by according member al this our walk with God is based on faith in his word above all things your emotion comes with it sure rejoicing comes with it or you know his anointing comes with a bow first and foremost it's faith in his word that's we're saved through faith amen so now I believe that Scripture I believe it that he became sin that I would become as righteousness hallelujah so therefore based on that Scripture I the brightest is righteous as he is righteous she is sinless as he is sinless amen she is perfect as he is perfect hallelujah amen by one offering he has done this I mean it would it says in Hebrews I love it this word is more I think it has more potency I mean this the epistles have more power I mean this word has more power today to me does just me they did when it was written they hadn't fully even the Apostle Paul didn't fully grasp I don't think I mean when he would say who can lay charge the gods he left immense God that justify earth hallelujah all guilt is gone amen all guilt is gone by the blood of Jesus Christ don't let your past hold you back if anything you should rejoice I was once that I'm not that that person died I don't know where he's gone hallelujah I'm a new creature I mean we are not remember we are not a patched up job we're a new creation I mean when it would say in in revelations chapter 3 that he is the beginning of the creation of God the Prophet would tell us that this word beginning is actually author revelations 3 and 14 and I see it unto the angel of the church of the lady of seon's write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness and the beginning of the creation of God now this word beginning actually means author so he's going to and it's actually speaking of an author of a new creation I meant member when Paul said that you're if you're in Christ you're a new creature you're a new creation so we're not just a patched up job but we've been created over again this body is still falling body but our spirit our soul have been converted to faith right and he's made us over new again we still the same old soul I hope I get the terminology right we can understand we're not just patched up we're a new we are a new creation we're a brand-new man so here he comes just like in Genesis chapter 1 broods over the earth hallelujah I love Genesis 1 and 2 well heard of God amen chapter 3 as well because there's a promise on three I'm going to undo this and now we're living at the end of that promise I mean where he came and he died amen that the head of the serpent was bruised I mean by his faintness he'll was you know the seat of the woman's heel was was bruised because that's where he his feet you stand upon there he stood upon the head of the serpent there at Calvary Amen brother Brahim said on that day of Calvary he says brother it's like the devil has gone oh he's like an animal with a broken back hallelujah and hasn't been healed it hasn't even as even scabbed over a man you could like try and operate with a broken back that's how the devil is God has totally our enemy is defeated but he's a liar and you got to expose us lie I remember Genesis 1 it says the earth was without form and void discover the face of the deep that was you that was you but then the Spirit of God began to brood over the face of the waters why is that he's got a creation it's got a creation that's got to come you know this earth isn't the biggest planet you know in the universe that they say that there's other planets that are in a habitable zone where life can come and that means a zone where it's certain amount of distance from the Sun that it orbits that it's not too hot not too cold life couldn't be there now to me I'm not worried about that it's like many people it's 7 7 billion people on the earth but there's only a few that have real life that can come forth it's like this earth it may not be the biggest planet where life could be it may not be the smallest or the most fancy but it's there and it's got life and it's the same thing with you is it you understand what I'm saying Alleluia here you are and God broods over you because he's a life that must come forth and the creation comes forth and here you are where are new creations glory to God now I'll read something then we'll maybe close I know Jesus said and I said before you'll find the scripture he says I have no part in him the devil and he is no part of me and the bride because we are part of him we had that same testimony we never belonged to the devil I mean we're never meant to be under his Dominion Amen we have no part in him he is no part of us hallelujah now we are joint heirs with Christ the scripture tells us amen we had joint heirs with Christ so as he had Dominion we have dominion through him as Jesus is the word and manifested the promised word for his day so she'll is bride fulfill every prophecy that speaks of her that's why as I said I think on Sunday look at all the promises that relate to you get those exceeding precious promises and look at them look at them spend time read through read through what brother Brown would sound the message he say Lord by your grace I'm one of them amen I want to see this live amen say that's pretty bold to say Lord you want to see the scripture love Father Brown was out hunting and for many years he would think about Matthew I think mark where it says if you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea he was thinking about that scripture how does that work how does this happen he's out hunting and then the Lord comes he says how many screws do you need they say I'm gonna show you what that scripture means I'm gonna show you what it mean I'm going to interpret that scripture to you you're gonna experience a member to be a disciple is not just a disciple is not made by teaching only a disciple is made by practical experience all right that's why that's why as we walk with Him the Lord teaches us different things because he's making us his disciple by practical thing sure we listen and we and we you know and we read and all those things and we pray but it's through practical things he shows us that's like I am the love of Hills all thy diseases they can just be up here but then you get sick and you say oh God heal me and he shows you this is the interpretation of the scripture amen I am your you know I'm your Shepherd and he allows you maybe to go off some path someplace and he's seen sheep man I just when I Drive over hay woods you see sheep they on the side of the road I think man those things would be chomped up a visit any wolves around there's such a helpless animal but think about our Shepherd he knows before you need a when you call he'll answer you say Lord I've got off I don't know where I don't know how to get out of this and you call upon him he reaches down as great hands maybe just twist your view look there oh I go this way hallelujah that's a practical thing isn't it amen when you you know when you feel lonely or down he's a comforter yeah amen when you you know when you feel down cast amen he comes he comes to you there because he wants to show you you say you know sometimes he yeah we begin to think maybe we have crossed the line you know we've we've overstepped the blood I think it's a show you know hit no I'm you're offering I have your intercessor I'm your advocate I'm so glad he's our advocate hallelujah Amen now now this isn't the masterpiece he says now for nearly two thousand years God has been making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam to get a masterpiece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that the perfect masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he'd got a piece off of him that's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and oldest husband and wife see and it's taken the new I mean the old to foreshadow than you Christ came the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another masterpiece in is in making as it was taken him 4,000 years to make his masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2,000 years making another masterpiece of bride for Christ another masterpiece and so doing it he does it by his never-changing method the same way he made the masterpieces word that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he can only be a perfect masterpiece when it's the perfect word Alleluia this is the bride wolf of will fulfill all the New Testament amen so now as I said he believed who he was and that's how he had perfect faith brother I'm sitting the perfect face message he says you just think about Calvary and what he's done to you he said that ought to give perfect faith I mean does it not when you think about it we have such assurance blessed assurance Jesus is mine I mean that he dead he died in our place he took all of our sin remember we were trapped into it we were the first nature that we were born with we were trapped into it by Adam aney to be born the way we were we were trapped into it and that's why we can be so sometimes even disgusted by the things he once did but it was because it was that old nature in our life but he made us new creations and that's why we can look back at those things and say I can't believe over did them because we're being made new again but so that shouldn't give you guilt to think about the things you used to do it should just give you Thanksgiving saying thank you Lord I don't have that nature anymore it's been killed out of me I mean I'm a new creature in you hallelujah amen no I want to read this now this is in the spoken word original seat this is the words of the church a part of it now the second the second son has spoken seed word of God was given a bride like Adam but before he could marry her she had fallen also for she was to be put on free moral agency like Adams wife was to believe God's Word and live or doubted and died and she did then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that's been promised for his hour and the Virgin who knows no man-made Creed's or dogmas I'm reading about you okay I'm this is you should say how does he know about me the word of promise in himself like it wasn't Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own word of promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb type of the spirit room now so will the Virgin now accepting a would be done to me as thou has said who said that who said that to God he said that be done to me according to thy word hallelujah though it was said by an angel while it was yet the written word Isaiah 9:6 they will love him who loves them love his and and will have his potentials for his their head and they are his subjects subjects to us head headship of Christ was was his notice what harmony Jesus never did anything until seen it of the father or the father showed him first how many between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life hello you should just be saying yes yes yep glory because this is just basically my my walk with him amen and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts that nothing can harm not even death Florida God for if the seed be planted the water will rise it up again I mean then I got a great big hallelujah here is the secret this is brother man here's the secret the word is in the bright and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the work and she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord then it is Germanized so the Holy Spirit waters it until it growin and serves its purpose amen what do you think the Lord just come you know it quickens his word to you MS Dermot eyes comes alive hallelujah and it's growing and serves its purpose Alleluia they will only do his will Amen I believe that no one can persuade them different they have that said that Lauder they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself and them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete all when he is here for it was no time yet he didn't go into all the world and preach the gospel they meant there are things that he had not the things that he did not fulfill in his body of flesh he came to purchase our Redemption and the user's man to find all the lost ones I mean and to complete his work now he says now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb now what's closed this is going to have a spiritual background now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight as nearing the time to be given Joshua and Hebrew means Savior and represents the promise in time leader to take the church over caleb represents the true believer who stayed with Joshua God started as rails a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day church notice how God did not move as role till his own appointed time now listen this is going to mean something Joshua waited for that time no matter how much people might have said God give us the land the promise let us go now and take it they might have said Joshua you lost your commission you're all washed up why are you not doing something you used to know the sat the Lord in a moment and what was the will of God but this wise God sent prophets knew the promise of God but also knew to wait for that promise a clear-cut decision from God for his time see these parables now watch and then the time come God give it to Joshua who had stayed with him by the word and he could not trust others he could he could trust him so it will repeat amen and we've had a Joshua commissioned brother Branham had a Joshua commissioned and his word places us in the land hallelujah now we just have some musicians to come what is this all about do you know who you are why suspicious become a lot this message has come to will seem to call out a bride and here you are well what does that mean I'm the bride it's very elementary so if I am the Bride of Christ you got to see what the word what the word the effect of the word in your life look at the woman at the well we know we're Messiah cometh he'll do these things he that speaks the a.m. he and then she drops her waterpot runs into the city of your life is never the same again scribes and Pharisees heard the same kind of things they said this is Beelzebub away with such a fellow well 1 1 well because one was to call one person and the others weren't cool and then here you were don't worry about the ones not cool just just here you are woman at the well and then Messiah stepped out of history the word is Messiah and then something and you just says come see a man he told me everything I ever did is this not the Messiah hallelujah and why did that happen to her because she was part of the bride for that age and here you are glory to God amen let's just stand we need to sing I'm amazed that you love me aren't you amazed hallelujah amen he walks with us you're in the resurrection
