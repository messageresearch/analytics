[54:47] something that is alive in us amen he is
[54:49] the resurrection and the life and it's
[54:51] he that is in us who has already
[54:52] quickened us from the dead amen so we uh
[54:55] we we're not just here to put in a
[54:57] Traditions or time but we are truly here
[55:00] to be changed from Glory unto glory amen
[55:03] God bless you it uh we just uh are so
[55:06] happy to be here with you this morning
[55:08] brother Ben and Sister Christine
[55:09] everyone just been so kind so lovely I
[55:12] see so many uh of of our familiar uh
[55:15] friends and faces that we know and
[55:17] family that we know and we just say God
[55:19] bless you to each and every one of you
[55:21] amen if you'll turn with me in your
[55:23] Bibles to the Book of Exodus chapter 38
[55:28] sorry Exodus
[55:31] 33 I do need to get
[55:35] glasses so if I misquote a number here
[55:38] or there it's just um it's it's this
[55:41] body that is being change from glory to
[55:43] glory from one weight to another weight
[55:47] and it's and I see my wife is smiling
[55:49] there she's saying yes definitely
[55:50] getting
[55:51] heavier amen but there's a glory that is
[55:54] that is taking place there's a glory
[55:56] that is inside of you um and I want to
[55:58] speak a little bit about this this
[56:00] morning Lord willing and I want to just
[56:02] maybe title the sermon uh just so we
[56:04] have a kind of a reference point as we
[56:06] go through the service today just come
[56:08] back to this title it um being the glory
[56:11] of this body and I wanted to subtitle it
[56:14] face to face with his
[56:17] glory so I want to speak on the glory of
[56:19] this body and I want to hone in on this
[56:22] this one element of of of of this sermon
[56:25] today and that is coming face to face
[56:28] with his glory I think that was so
[56:30] appropriate how we how the song was sung
[56:32] this morning the songs were sign just
[56:35] every song this morning was perfect but
[56:37] just that one song really touched me
[56:39] this morning that standing on Holy
[56:41] Ground we are standing on Holy Ground
[56:44] And if we truly believe that this
[56:45] morning then whose presence are we in
[56:48] can we come face to face with our maker
[56:51] you know wouldn't that be amazing if if
[56:53] you could be given the opportunity this
[56:55] morning and and we could say you know um
[56:58] God is just sitting in that little study
[56:59] in the back there he's waiting there for
[57:01] you if you want to see him face to face
[57:03] this morning you can go in there and you
[57:06] can talk to him personally your creator
[57:09] your maker the one who knows everything
[57:11] about you he's he's in there he's got
[57:13] some things he wants to share with you
[57:15] you can go into the little room and you
[57:17] can come face to face with God wouldn't
[57:18] that be a wonderful experience how many
[57:21] here would turn down an an an invitation
[57:24] like that that was a trick question
[57:25] right nobody nobody would turn down an
[57:28] invitation like that but I believe we
[57:30] would all go into that room and we would
[57:32] want to have an audience with him and
[57:34] that's truly what I want to speak about
[57:35] this morning is is this invitation that
[57:37] we have had to come to his table this
[57:39] invitation to come face to face with his
[57:42] glory and so what does this mean you
[57:44] know it's not just sometimes when we
[57:46] think of the word Glory we think of
[57:48] Great Expressions and great
[57:49] demonstrations and and a big Fanfare and
[57:52] you know it's a loud and and everything
[57:55] but we really want to H what does this
[57:56] mean to come face to face with the glory
[57:59] of God and I trust it'll encourage you
[58:03] amen Exodus 33 and 18 and it's just one
[58:05] line of scripture I want to read here
[58:07] and he said I beseech thee this is Moses
[58:10] he's speaking out he's got a a question
[58:12] to God he's got a request to God he says
[58:14] I beseech thee show me thy Glory how
[58:19] many he this morning want to say to the
[58:21] Lord Show Me Your
[58:24] Glory I want to re bound one more time
[58:26] Lord we we have a request on our hearts
[58:28] Today show us your glory father we ask
[58:33] for your blessing upon the reading of
[58:34] the word may you come and bless the
[58:35] service now anoint the words that are
[58:38] spoken father as we just get out of the
[58:40] way have preeminence Lord and may your
[58:42] Holy Spirit move in our hearts and in
[58:44] our midst in Jesus Christ's name amen
[58:46] you may have your seats 1 Corinthians 15
[58:49] and 40 says this there are also
[58:53] celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial
[58:57] but the glory of the terrestrial
[58:59] Celestial is one and the glory of the
[59:01] terrestrial is another there are
[59:03] different bodies and basically he's
[59:05] saying there's the moon the Sun and then
[59:07] on the on the earth there are other
[59:09] kinds of bodies they are more like you
[59:11] know terrafirma kind of bodies they are
[59:14] bodies of of trees there are bodies of
[59:16] rocks you know every Everything has a
[59:19] body a flower has a body right amen you
[59:23] have a body this morning the sun has a
[59:25] body the Moon has a body and all these
[59:27] different bodies have are in different
[59:29] Realms different Dwelling Places but
[59:31] they all have been given a body and they
[59:33] all have a a Divine architect someone
[59:35] who made them amen they have they have a
[59:38] design they have a specific purpose you
[59:40] know the sun doesn't uh you know trade
[59:43] off with the Moon from time to time no
[59:45] it's the Sun and the Moon you know and
[59:47] they have very specific purposes and you
[59:49] can't replace the sun with anything else
[59:51] the sun has been designed to be there to
[59:53] bring warmth to bring light to bring
[59:55] light life to the Earth amen the Moon is
[59:57] there to bring light to be a reflection
[59:59] of the Sun and so what is he saying by
[1:00:02] these different bodies why did he create
[1:00:03] these different bodies it is to it is to
[1:00:06] show us something it is to be an
[1:00:08] expression of something but he
[1:00:10] specifically says that these bodies each
[1:00:12] have a glory and the one glory is
[1:00:14] different from the other all right the
[1:00:17] sun has a certain kind of Glory I I
[1:00:19] would say that probably most people
[1:00:21] enjoy the sunshine you know they enjoy
[1:00:23] that as I was walking up the path here
[1:00:25] it was just a a little bit chilly and
[1:00:27] and and just coming up the path here and
[1:00:29] the sun just kind of peak through the
[1:00:30] clouds there for a moment oh man that
[1:00:33] felt good that little bit of warming and
[1:00:35] and that is the glory of the sun that's
[1:00:37] the value that is the expression of the
[1:00:39] sun and it has an influence it has an
[1:00:41] effect on things amen so he created God
[1:00:44] created all these things for for a
[1:00:46] purpose and and he's specifically saying
[1:00:49] I'm going to put these things out there
[1:00:51] so that you can see by the visible
[1:00:53] things what is in the invisible so that
[1:00:55] you can
[1:00:56] understand me amen and so the the sun
[1:00:59] speaks of God Amen who brings life to
[1:01:02] the Earth he's the light and so forth so
[1:01:04] the sun has a glory it has a certain
[1:01:06] expression but all the Expressions all
[1:01:08] the bodies point back to their
[1:01:11] maker ohen amen each body has its own
[1:01:15] Glory it has its own purpose and
[1:01:19] expression like the glory of the Moon it
[1:01:22] may not have the glory of the Sun but
[1:01:24] it's the glory it's glory glory is to be
[1:01:26] able to reflect that that which is of
[1:01:29] the Sun the light and it's to reflect
[1:01:32] that upon the Earth and it brings a
[1:01:33] light in the evening time so we can see
[1:01:36] all these things have been laid out
[1:01:37] there like like uh brother brandom says
[1:01:39] you know the the stars and the and the
[1:01:41] Moon and the Sun that was uh job and
[1:01:44] that was Enoch's first Bible Abraham
[1:01:46] could look up there H the Lord referred
[1:01:48] to the stars in the heavens your seed
[1:01:50] will be like that amen so all these
[1:01:52] things are reflection of something that
[1:01:54] is real something that is tangible it it
[1:01:57] is it is a weight of Glory hallu in the
[1:02:00] message things that are to be glorious
[1:02:04] message speaking about the things that
[1:02:05] are coming up by the way things that are
[1:02:08] coming up is is better than what we have
[1:02:10] now it's only going to get better amen
[1:02:12] The Best Is Yet To Come amen so we we
[1:02:16] are looking at tangible things now we're
[1:02:17] looking at at different bodies and
[1:02:20] things and all these things point
[1:02:21] forward to something that's coming it's
[1:02:23] crying out it's reflecting it's it's
[1:02:26] speaking to something that's coming amen
[1:02:28] and so it's exciting amen because we see
[1:02:31] it in in a shadow of a shadow of a
[1:02:33] shadow we see it in in such a dim light
[1:02:35] but we we see that those things are all
[1:02:37] pointed to something great something
[1:02:39] amazing amen and so in the message
[1:02:41] things that are to be this is kind of
[1:02:43] the context of of how he's bringing this
[1:02:45] message and he says I just want to read
[1:02:47] a couple lines from it for you it says
[1:02:49] now they only express that there's a
[1:02:51] greater of the same kind so this body
[1:02:56] for instance what he's saying is this
[1:02:57] body this human body when we are changed
[1:03:01] from glory to glory when we finally
[1:03:03] cross over or or we drop this robe and
[1:03:05] we put on an immortal robe that body is
[1:03:08] not going to suddenly now look like an
[1:03:10] animal's body or look like something
[1:03:11] strange or or be some Whisper of a of a
[1:03:14] of a wind or something like that no it's
[1:03:16] going to be the same look we'll be able
[1:03:18] to identify one another that was a
[1:03:20] question brother brandom had when he
[1:03:22] went beyond the curtain of time he he
[1:03:23] was excited that he could shake
[1:03:25] someone's hand he could Embrace somebody
[1:03:27] we were still in the same form but this
[1:03:30] form speaks of something that is greater
[1:03:32] that is coming amen
[1:03:35] so have you ever been in a situation
[1:03:37] where you know things are getting really
[1:03:39] wor really bad and it's it's it couldn't
[1:03:41] get any worse that's really that's a
[1:03:43] good place to be because it can only get
[1:03:45] better man we're in a position where
[1:03:47] things can only get better amen
[1:03:50] hallelujah so there's an expression here
[1:03:52] what you're looking at it is an
[1:03:54] expression it's a reminder
[1:03:56] every day we see we see this guy we see
[1:03:59] we you see yourself in the mirror you
[1:04:01] you see your hands right there a
[1:04:02] reminder that there is something that is
[1:04:04] greater of the same kind because they
[1:04:08] are the same kind now the brother
[1:04:10] brother Rand says this goes on in
[1:04:12] paragraph 53 he says the likeness all
[1:04:15] the things that he did expresses the
[1:04:17] things that are to come amen all the
[1:04:21] things that he did remember he said that
[1:04:23] if you a uh if you are something here if
[1:04:25] you hold a position here of some kind he
[1:04:28] says you will be the same on that side
[1:04:29] it just continues on brother brandham
[1:04:31] will remain a prophet to our generation
[1:04:33] he will stay in that office amen so
[1:04:35] that's just a reflection of something
[1:04:37] that is coming up the likeness all the
[1:04:40] things that he did expresses the things
[1:04:42] that are to come just as the body gives
[1:04:44] you here just as this body he gave you
[1:04:47] to live in only expresses that there is
[1:04:50] one that is greater take a good look at
[1:04:53] that body you've got that you're
[1:04:54] dragging around every every day there's
[1:04:56] one that is
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:04:58] [Music]
[1:05:00] greater and this body is to remind you
[1:05:03] every day it's it's it has a glory this
[1:05:06] body has a glory and the glory of this
[1:05:09] body is to remind us that there's a
[1:05:11] greater one waiting for us it only
[1:05:14] expresses that there is one that is
[1:05:15] greater Yet to Come the heavens declare
[1:05:17] his glory the Bible tells us what is
[1:05:20] that saying they are the mirror of God's
[1:05:22] glory the the heavens declare his glory
[1:05:26] it's a reflection of God's glory so they
[1:05:28] are the mirror of God's glory remember
[1:05:31] the the subject today is we want to come
[1:05:34] face to face with his
[1:05:36] glory we're going to have to do a little
[1:05:38] bit of homework here before we get to
[1:05:40] the main meat of the subject so the
[1:05:42] everything points to or is a mirror or
[1:05:45] is a reflection or is a shadow of the
[1:05:48] real thing of his glory ultimately
[1:05:51] everything points to who he is
[1:05:54] everything points to the its maker amen
[1:05:57] everything points back to the original
[1:06:00] everything the prophet makes this
[1:06:02] beautiful analogy how the trees and and
[1:06:05] and plant life and animals he says
[1:06:07] everything is struggling for life why
[1:06:10] because the because there's something in
[1:06:12] us there's something that's built into
[1:06:13] us that knows that there's an eternity
[1:06:15] out there there's immortality there's
[1:06:17] something that's that is fighting that
[1:06:19] is struggling for life and maybe you're
[1:06:22] struggling for life this morning maybe
[1:06:24] you've lost your way a little bit but
[1:06:26] you're struggling for that life I'm
[1:06:28] struggling to come face to face with my
[1:06:30] maker amen God changing us every day
[1:06:36] every moment sermon to sermon from Glory
[1:06:39] unto
[1:06:41] Glory there's changes happening right
[1:06:44] now you know it's amazing when we're
[1:06:46] talking about Glory you know it's it is
[1:06:49] it is something that excites us and it
[1:06:50] and it sounds like a victory and and
[1:06:52] it's amazing but you know we're going to
[1:06:54] get into this a little bit more does
[1:06:55] this mean the glory you know there's
[1:06:58] there and what does it mean that we are
[1:06:59] being changed from Glory unto Glory
[1:07:02] because at every moment in your life you
[1:07:04] are an expression of your maker amen you
[1:07:08] mothers are an expression of God's love
[1:07:10] and grace to the children you're you are
[1:07:12] a a a a visible representation of the
[1:07:15] invisible amen you are the you are a
[1:07:18] reflection of the glory of God and so
[1:07:21] there's there's portions of our life
[1:07:22] where we can say wow this is amazing we
[1:07:24] we have like like last night we had
[1:07:26] wonderful uh uh uh healings taking place
[1:07:29] and people coming up for prayer and and
[1:07:31] we hear the word of God and it's great
[1:07:33] and we and we look to those things as
[1:07:35] glorious amen but your whole life is
[1:07:38] glory to God your whole life brings
[1:07:40] Glory the high points the low points
[1:07:43] everything is an expression of his
[1:07:44] keeping power of his love of his grace
[1:07:47] of his Redemption plan your whole life
[1:07:49] speaks to him it speaks of him it's it's
[1:07:53] the it's the story that he had in his
[1:07:55] mind playing out in your life amen so we
[1:07:58] see every moment of your life is is a
[1:08:01] step higher up every every day that you
[1:08:03] live every time you come to church every
[1:08:05] time you feed on the word we live by the
[1:08:07] word of God we are doing what we are
[1:08:09] being changed from Glory unto Glory
[1:08:12] we're not being changed from one
[1:08:13] weakness to another weakness we're being
[1:08:16] changed from Glory unto Glory the bride
[1:08:18] is is making herself ready dressing
[1:08:21] herself in the word of God we are being
[1:08:23] changed amen we are as as brother Andre
[1:08:25] started off on a Friday we are pressing
[1:08:28] forward amen we are not going backwards
[1:08:30] going forwards into the glory of God but
[1:08:33] it's amazing how Jesus Christ you know
[1:08:35] he was sitting there one day around the
[1:08:36] table amongst his disciples and and
[1:08:39] those that that people would would would
[1:08:41] say are his not re not not uh realizing
[1:08:45] that Judas was not was going to betray
[1:08:47] him and here they are everything is
[1:08:50] going so well you know the the ministry
[1:08:52] is going well they are they are they are
[1:08:54] uh having he healing campaigns and
[1:08:56] there's great Miracles taking place and
[1:08:59] oh my goodness you know there's so many
[1:09:00] testimonies we can share and if we had
[1:09:02] to talk about the glory of of Jesus
[1:09:05] Christ's Ministry a lot of people would
[1:09:07] point back to those Miracles they would
[1:09:09] point back to the first pull of his
[1:09:10] ministry the second pole of his ministry
[1:09:13] they would look at those things as the
[1:09:14] Glory Days you know they would say that
[1:09:16] is that was amazing that was the
[1:09:18] expression of the power of God and so
[1:09:21] forth but you know there come came a
[1:09:22] time where he was sitting around a table
[1:09:24] with just 12 12 people just 12 just a
[1:09:27] small little group and it became a
[1:09:29] personal time one-on-one kind of
[1:09:31] fellowship and it was in this time where
[1:09:33] where those two trees those two Vines
[1:09:35] amen was was walking together Cain and
[1:09:38] Abel walking together amen we have we
[1:09:40] see these twins growing up both bringing
[1:09:43] glory to God because remember God
[1:09:45] created both Satan did not create
[1:09:47] himself there's a scripture in the in
[1:09:50] Isaiah that says that even the evil I
[1:09:52] have made all these things God is the
[1:09:54] maker of all these things amen so he
[1:09:56] created Judas to bring a glory because
[1:09:59] he needed Judas to do a a job for
[1:10:02] him so we don't have to fear the devil
[1:10:05] he was
[1:10:06] created he was made by our God the one
[1:10:09] who loves you made him to serve a
[1:10:13] purpose for you and there so there comes
[1:10:16] a time where where Jesus Christ is
[1:10:18] sitting there the word and and he's and
[1:10:20] he's looking around the table and and he
[1:10:22] knows that you know this is a wonderful
[1:10:24] scene this is what this is lovely to
[1:10:25] have Fellowship like this to be in
[1:10:27] harmony like this but there's coming a
[1:10:29] season where he himself had to be
[1:10:34] glorified it wasn't just the Miracles
[1:10:36] those things were signpost for what was
[1:10:38] coming for to get the attraction of the
[1:10:40] people but there's coming a season where
[1:10:43] that that person Jesus Christ where he
[1:10:45] himself would be
[1:10:48] glorified what does that mean to be
[1:10:50] glorified there was a season where Jesus
[1:10:52] Christ was going to become was going to
[1:10:54] conf Faith face to face with the very
[1:10:57] image that God had of him before the
[1:10:59] foundation of the world the Lamb of God
[1:11:01] slain upon a cross he he he was going to
[1:11:04] come to a moment in his life where he
[1:11:06] would literally come face to face with
[1:11:08] the very purpose that he was created for
[1:11:11] that he was made for that he came to the
[1:11:13] Earth for he was going to come face to
[1:11:14] face with the glory of God in his life
[1:11:17] so there comes a season where he had to
[1:11:19] be
[1:11:20] betrayed and he looks over and he says
[1:11:22] to John whoever I say this to you know
[1:11:25] you know the story he's the one who's
[1:11:28] going to betray me and he leans over to
[1:11:30] Judas just for the sake of time I won't
[1:11:32] go into all the details he leans over to
[1:11:33] Judas and he says Judas what whatever
[1:11:35] you have in your heart to do go do it
[1:11:37] quickly amen he didn't argue with him
[1:11:40] what you're going to do is wrong it's
[1:11:41] immoral it's it's not right no you have
[1:11:43] a glory to your body that you have to
[1:11:45] bring out you have a certain value that
[1:11:48] you've been created for you have a
[1:11:49] certain purpose and you need to go do it
[1:11:51] because it's manifesting time my brother
[1:11:54] and sister we don't have to be be afraid
[1:11:55] of all the things that are manifesting
[1:11:57] everybody is playing their part but the
[1:11:59] question is what about your part don't
[1:12:01] be afraid of it everybody's got to do
[1:12:04] their thing amen just let them do their
[1:12:06] thing whatever you have in your heart to
[1:12:08] do go do it but I'm also going to do
[1:12:10] what's in my heart because it's a season
[1:12:13] for us to be
[1:12:15] glorified Hallelujah so he tells Judas
[1:12:17] whatever you do go do quickly go hurry
[1:12:20] up amen cuz I want to be glorified I
[1:12:23] want to come face to face with the the
[1:12:25] promise that is concerning me I want to
[1:12:27] come face to face with a prophecy that
[1:12:29] is laying over my life I want to be
[1:12:31] glorified I want to have a change of
[1:12:35] body I want to go into a Rapture I want
[1:12:37] to go through that Resurrection I want
[1:12:39] to see the my loved ones that have gone
[1:12:41] before me I want to meet with them I
[1:12:43] want to be
[1:12:44] glorified I want to come face to face
[1:12:46] with the glory of God in my life and so
[1:12:49] there comes a season where we're not
[1:12:51] afraid of these things we're not afraid
[1:12:52] of death we're not afraid of those
[1:12:54] things that have been cre created and
[1:12:56] they're harnessed by the hand of God
[1:12:58] Amen it's we don't have to be afraid of
[1:13:00] those things God is for us
[1:13:04] so Judas leaves the room and as he goes
[1:13:07] to betray the word as the word is going
[1:13:09] to be rejected as the word is going to
[1:13:11] be sold out as the message was going to
[1:13:14] be rejected and and there was going to
[1:13:16] be the the scoffers and they were going
[1:13:18] to come against the the the message of
[1:13:20] the day the word of their day guess what
[1:13:22] it was at that moment Jesus said now can
[1:13:25] the son of man be glorified it is at
[1:13:28] this time now that's now the ministry
[1:13:30] can be completed now the victory can be
[1:13:33] won without that betrayal without that
[1:13:36] what looked like a dark thing what
[1:13:39] looked like a sad thing what looked like
[1:13:40] defeat what looked like division what
[1:13:43] looked like whatever he was going to use
[1:13:45] that to bring glory to finish his
[1:13:47] product hallelujah what about you today
[1:13:51] whatever is happening to you it's
[1:13:53] happening for a reason that's right so
[1:13:56] these things are to express the greater
[1:13:58] thing that is
[1:14:01] coming the Mighty God unveiled before us
[1:14:04] 1964 brother B says now when their
[1:14:06] traditional veil of traditions of the
[1:14:08] elders and the word is broken through of
[1:14:11] course today then that comes into Plain
[1:14:13] View we see him amen so what's he saying
[1:14:17] getting through just the the everyday
[1:14:18] stuff don't you know we we we we have a
[1:14:21] certain expectation like maybe those
[1:14:23] disciples thought you know we're all
[1:14:24] going to stay together how is it
[1:14:26] possible that this person would betray
[1:14:27] us how is it possible that there would
[1:14:29] be these things happening around us but
[1:14:31] we have to look through those things we
[1:14:33] look through it amen to see the glory of
[1:14:36] God so we have to look through because
[1:14:38] somewhere in the picture Christ is
[1:14:40] unveiling himself the Mighty God
[1:14:43] unveiling before us hallelujah as Satan
[1:14:47] unveils himself as he shows his hand God
[1:14:51] also is showing his
[1:14:53] hand so deity again is veiled in human
[1:14:57] flesh brother Braham says you can go to
[1:14:58] Hebrews 1 and so on he goes on in
[1:15:01] paragraph 146 and says also Genesis 18
[1:15:04] you remember God was a
[1:15:06] man standing there eating and talking
[1:15:09] with Abraham and told what Sarah was
[1:15:11] doing in the tent behind him we we know
[1:15:13] what this means we've seen this also and
[1:15:16] Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:15:18] Sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[1:15:20] the son of man deity veiled again in
[1:15:22] human flesh I want to see the glory of
[1:15:25] God deity veiled in human flesh
[1:15:28] Hallelujah now remember Jesus didn't say
[1:15:31] when the Son of God is being revealed in
[1:15:33] Luke chapter 17 I believe about the 21st
[1:15:36] verse he says along there and when the
[1:15:37] son of man is being revealed he said the
[1:15:40] son of man the church is going again he
[1:15:43] says not the Son of God being revealed
[1:15:45] but the son of man being revealed amen
[1:15:48] you want to make sure I said that right
[1:15:50] and when the son of man is being
[1:15:51] revealed the son of man is in the church
[1:15:53] again reveal healed in human beings not
[1:15:56] the Son of God but the son of man again
[1:15:59] back in his church again in the last
[1:16:01] days man that's sped up right to our day
[1:16:04] we went right from from Sodom and
[1:16:06] gomorrah's day right up to our day amen
[1:16:08] it's a expression of each other it's a
[1:16:10] mirror of each other they're pointing at
[1:16:12] each
[1:16:13] other so if you want to see God we can
[1:16:16] go through the parallels we can go
[1:16:17] through the the types brother Brown says
[1:16:19] I'm a typologist why because we see
[1:16:21] Reflections it's a mirror of Who We Are
[1:16:26] Hallelujah we find that he promised that
[1:16:29] in God's promises for the last days now
[1:16:31] we notice another thing in the Old
[1:16:33] Testament I have the scripture here in
[1:16:35] Exodus that old Badger skins what did it
[1:16:37] do it hid the glory of God from the
[1:16:42] people the badger skins how many here's
[1:16:44] got some Badger skins you know what I'm
[1:16:46] talking about right we got some Badger
[1:16:48] skins and it what does that do it's a
[1:16:50] veil for the glory of God so that tells
[1:16:54] me that the glory of God is here but
[1:16:57] there's a veil just like when they were
[1:16:59] sitting around that table and and and
[1:17:01] and and you know there was a time when
[1:17:03] they were all in Harmony and unity but
[1:17:05] then suddenly there came a time where
[1:17:06] they started to manifest what was behind
[1:17:09] the veil started to come out and there's
[1:17:12] also but he's saying the glory of God is
[1:17:14] hid from the people in Badger
[1:17:16] skins the badger skins even people
[1:17:19] couldn't see it because it was a skin
[1:17:22] that held it that skin the glory of God
[1:17:25] was behind the skin now the glory of God
[1:17:28] is behind your skin I'm just reading
[1:17:31] what the prophet said the glory of God
[1:17:33] is behind your skin Oh I want to come
[1:17:36] face to face with the glory of God you
[1:17:38] don't have to go very far we are
[1:17:41] standing on Holy Ground oh brother Chris
[1:17:43] I've had a terrible week I've had a
[1:17:45] rough week I'm sick and this of God you
[1:17:47] are tabernacling the very glory of
[1:17:52] God he says and now the glory of God is
[1:17:55] behind your skin that's right and the
[1:17:56] Traditions don't see it it's the inside
[1:17:59] of the veil where the word was what was
[1:18:03] on the inside of that skin back there
[1:18:05] the old badg of skins he says which he
[1:18:07] says there was no beauty that we should
[1:18:09] desire it right Badger skins isn't
[1:18:10] necessarily A A greatl looking animal
[1:18:13] right but there was no beauty that we
[1:18:14] should desire it and when it was made
[1:18:16] flesh and dwelt Among Us it was still no
[1:18:18] Beauty we should desire it it doesn't
[1:18:22] matter the glory of God was tabernacled
[1:18:24] in that
[1:18:25] skin amen what about you today it's not
[1:18:28] about how we feel it's not about our
[1:18:30] emotions it's not about what we think
[1:18:33] it's not about our reasonings our
[1:18:34] imaginations it's about the glory of God
[1:18:36] that is tabernacled within you now the
[1:18:39] same thing is today amen so that just
[1:18:42] kind of clears it up the same thing it
[1:18:44] is today there's nothing in a man or
[1:18:47] woman that can be desired he says it's
[1:18:49] what's in behind there that's what it is
[1:18:53] well you say that fellow I know he used
[1:18:55] to be a drunkard he used to do this I
[1:18:57] don't care what he used to do what's hid
[1:19:00] behind that
[1:19:02] skin I don't care what you used to be

[1:19:07] your
[1:19:09] skin praise the Lord what is behind
[1:19:12] there that's what counts that's what the
[1:19:15] people is blinded he says the skin
[1:19:17] blinds the people and you know I'll go
[1:19:19] as far as to say that sometimes we're
[1:19:20] blinded by our own skin we can't see
[1:19:23] past our own mistakes we can't see past
[1:19:25] their own failures but in behind there

[1:20:08] that man or that

[1:20:13] boundery but now it's hiding the glory
[1:20:15] of God got it housed up behind it it was
[1:20:18] on an animal but now it is housing the
[1:20:20] glory of God before that skin was on an
[1:20:24] animal but now it's been converted it
[1:20:26] had to die and now it's housing the
[1:20:29] glory of
[1:20:30] God Lord praise the Lord he says
[1:20:34] now there's nothing in a man or woman

[1:21:29] and failures what seems like those
[1:21:31] things and and what you think is just
[1:21:33] you know a miserable existence that can

[1:21:37] be changed to be made a housing place
[1:21:40] for God God dwelling in humanity I'm
[1:21:44] still reading from the message here of
[1:21:45] brother brandham he says now in
[1:21:47] paragraph 155 he says look the old
[1:21:49] Badger skins we find out behind it
[1:21:51] inside there was the word
[1:21:55] and that word there also was the
[1:21:57] showbread The Ark was sprinkled and what
[1:22:00] was it the shakina of Glory was in there
[1:22:02] now the word is a seed and it cannot
[1:22:05] bring forth until the shakina glory
[1:22:07] strikes it that son has got to be upon
[1:22:12] the seed the s o n son has got to come
[1:22:15] and shine upon that
[1:22:18] seed to make it bear or to make it come
[1:22:21] forth and that's the only way you take
[1:22:24] the word see take the word of God in
[1:22:26] your heart and walk into the shikina
[1:22:28] glory oh we are standing on Holy Ground
[1:22:33] you sang it this
[1:22:35] morning it's so
[1:22:38] perfect walk into the shikina glory and
[1:22:40] when you do it'll bring showbread it'll
[1:22:43] bring Mana that's that's only give for a
[1:22:46] separated people a royal priesthood amen
[1:22:50] the only thing that can eat it is that's
[1:22:53] permitted to eat it is just the people
[1:22:55] who are permitted and knows it Paul said
[1:22:58] they're changed from glory to glory so
[1:23:02] when we are when we say that we are
[1:23:03] being changed from Glory unto Glory I
[1:23:05] mean this is the process that's
[1:23:06] happening the shakina glory of God is
[1:23:09] shining upon you and is shining a light
[1:23:11] upon that sea that is on the inside of
[1:23:13] you that is tabernacled in your
[1:23:16] skin so much so one one of these days
[1:23:19] your skin won't be able to contain it
[1:23:21] amen Enoch is our is our example it was
[1:23:24] it's so sha in his life so much so that
[1:23:27] he could not contain the glory of God
[1:23:29] anymore there'll come a day when the
[1:23:31] glory of God will shine so bright that
[1:23:33] Ministry won't be able to speak
[1:23:35] anymore because it'll be so real there
[1:23:38] won't be any Shadows anymore won't be
[1:23:40] any uh uh mirrors or or or anything like
[1:23:43] that or expressions of an expression no
[1:23:45] it'll be the thing you will be face to
[1:23:48] face there'll be no Shadow between the
[1:23:50] two
[1:23:57] H it's just like a seed of a morning
[1:24:01] glory I'm still reading from the message
[1:24:03] there's so many good things in this
[1:24:04] message amen the seed of a flower it
[1:24:06] falls into the ground the seed of corn
[1:24:08] falls in the ground remember this is
[1:24:10] what got job's attention this is where
[1:24:12] he saw something in the flower that
[1:24:14] flower had a glory to it it had a value
[1:24:17] and that and it spoke to something and
[1:24:19] and to me what is incredible just let's
[1:24:22] just pay attention to what is happening
[1:24:23] here it's a flower it's just a fragile
[1:24:26] Little Flower but that flower was
[1:24:29] literally mirroring job's life it was
[1:24:32] literally showing forth what was going
[1:24:34] to happen to job here God has created
[1:24:36] something from the invisible realm we
[1:24:39] call it a little flower that dies in the
[1:24:41] winter and and it goes to to nothing it
[1:24:44] just dissolves and we we won't be able
[1:24:46] to find it there might be a little seed
[1:24:47] in the ground or somewhere and it looks
[1:24:49] like it has died it is it looks like
[1:24:51] it's over but in the springtime with the
[1:24:54] right atmosphere there's a glory in that
[1:24:57] seat that must come forth why because
[1:25:00] it's the law of life that's in that seat
[1:25:02] and that little flower shows that there
[1:25:04] is a resurrection that there is power in
[1:25:07] the word of God there is power in the
[1:25:08] glory of
[1:25:09] God so that body of that flower was a
[1:25:13] representation was a reflection to job
[1:25:15] he was saying to job job look at me I am
[1:25:19] you I am showing you what's going to
[1:25:21] happen to
[1:25:23] you oh my when job said I know my
[1:25:26] redeemer liveth amen it wasn't just you
[1:25:29] know it wasn't intellectual there was
[1:25:31] something happening in him he was being
[1:25:33] changed from Glory unto glory and what
[1:25:36] happened they had to go through a
[1:25:38] terrible time he had to go through great
[1:25:40] distress loss and and and and and and
[1:25:44] and and and what looked like failure and
[1:25:46] people turning against him he had to be
[1:25:48] betrayed he had to go through this
[1:25:50] process of refining to do what to show
[1:25:53] the value to show the glory that was
[1:25:55] already in his
[1:25:57] life there's something in your life that
[1:26:00] God wants to bring out there's a glory
[1:26:02] in your life and you might say brother
[1:26:04] Chris why am I being beaten why am I uh
[1:26:07] you know emotionally physically verbally
[1:26:09] whatever it is why am I going through
[1:26:11] these hard trials why why am I
[1:26:13] distressed why am I being pushed around
[1:26:16] why do I feel like I'm an elastic being
[1:26:17] stretched beyond my my my normal
[1:26:20] conditions my comfort zones why are
[1:26:22] these things happening it's because God
[1:26:24] is bringing glory out of your life you
[1:26:26] might not see it there but he invested
[1:26:28] something in you he sees something
[1:26:30] inside of you and that is a piece of
[1:26:32] himself he's looking at himself in your
[1:26:34] life and it has to come forth because
[1:26:37] without that he is not
[1:26:39] complete
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:26:42] hallall
[1:26:45] Hallelujah I better stick to my
[1:26:48] notes we're on page three of 24 for
[1:26:51] anyone's keeping count I I'm here till
[1:26:54] Friday
[1:26:55] so we got no other plans amen all right
[1:26:59] so the church has to come there's a
[1:27:01] morning glory there's a seed of the
[1:27:03] flower it falls into the ground the seed
[1:27:05] of corn falls in the ground brother
[1:27:06] Brown saying this what's the first thing
[1:27:08] it comes up and it's a little Sprout and
[1:27:10] then it goes into a tassel then from a
[1:27:12] tassel back to its original grain
[1:27:14] exactly what the church has
[1:27:17] done it come from Luther Wesley now back
[1:27:21] to the original grain back to its
[1:27:23] original
[1:27:26] Glory back to the glory it was at the
[1:27:30] beginning now I'm I want being very
[1:27:32] careful to say it exactly the way the
[1:27:34] prophet says it because what is
[1:27:37] Glory now he's saying the glory that we
[1:27:40] have as a church is is is the same as
[1:27:43] what we had at the
[1:27:46] beginning oh it's so good but you're
[1:27:48] going to have to just hang on for a
[1:27:50] minute the glory we have we've been
[1:27:53] restored to what is in the beginning
[1:27:55] remember the Little Flower it didn't
[1:27:57] come up a tree next time the glory it
[1:28:00] has it it is restored back to its
[1:28:02] original Glory nothing is lost nothing
[1:28:05] is added to we don't have to worry about
[1:28:07] what's going to happen we don't have to
[1:28:08] wonder how things are going to play out
[1:28:10] no it's going to be the same the same
[1:28:13] amen nothing will be lost everything
[1:28:15] will be given back amen the resurrection
[1:28:18] will fix everything that death did amen
[1:28:21] I'm just quoting the message to you
[1:28:24] amen that same
[1:28:27] one so it's the same all right I'm going
[1:28:29] to skip through some of this so it's the
[1:28:31] same it's but he says it's changing as
[1:28:34] it's moving from the East the Sun that
[1:28:36] Rose in the East it's the same Sun
[1:28:39] that's manifesting the same thing in the
[1:28:41] west changing from glory to glory so as
[1:28:45] that gospel moves is it is changing the
[1:28:48] bride it is dressing her until one day
[1:28:50] she will come face to face with the
[1:28:52] glory of God concerning her all right
[1:28:56] Hallelujah it changed from the Pagan
[1:28:58] down into Luther from Luther down to
[1:29:01] Wesley from Wesley into Pentecost and on
[1:29:04] and on changing from glory to glory
[1:29:06] producing the hidden manner something
[1:29:09] that's
[1:29:10] inside he says and now it's ripe to
[1:29:13] bring him back exactly like he was at
[1:29:17] the beginning who's he talking about
[1:29:18] he's talking about you to bring him back
[1:29:24] like he was at the
[1:29:25] beginning his same
[1:29:29] Ministry the same Jesus the Same power
[1:29:33] the same Holy
[1:29:34] Ghost the same one it's very important
[1:29:37] that it's the same some people might say
[1:29:40] that it's glory and so because it's
[1:29:41] glory is going to be bigger it's going
[1:29:43] to be different no it's going to be the
[1:29:44] same and there's a reason for that it's
[1:29:47] the
[1:29:49] same he says the same one that come down
[1:29:52] on the day of Pentecost is the same holy
[1:29:54] holy ghost that is manifested today from
[1:29:56] Glory unto Glory unto Glory this
[1:29:59] changing is a revolving back to the
[1:30:02] original okay it is drawing you closer
[1:30:06] to the real you to the original the one
[1:30:09] that God has the the picture that he has
[1:30:11] in his photo album he's taking you back
[1:30:13] to that you know the prophet actually
[1:30:15] says he's not just changing you back to
[1:30:16] when you were 16 178 he not that would
[1:30:20] be
[1:30:22] terrible you know when I was 16 17 18
[1:30:25] you know I had pimples on my face I was
[1:30:27] I was sickly I had a I had a chronic
[1:30:30] cough you know I mean I was not
[1:30:33] mature he's not just changing us back to
[1:30:36] when we were SI that's not original he's
[1:30:39] changing us back yes to young again amen
[1:30:42] and we will look like this but he's
[1:30:44] changing Us in other words he's he's
[1:30:46] reversing everything he's taking us back
[1:30:48] to who we were in the
[1:30:50] beginning Abraham and Sarah when he
[1:30:52] changed them back if he only changed
[1:30:54] their bodies then they would have had
[1:30:55] the same problems they still would not
[1:30:57] have been able to bring forth the Sun
[1:30:59] but when he changed their bodies they
[1:31:00] were able to bring forth the Sun so in
[1:31:03] this changing from Glory he he brings
[1:31:05] you back to who you are full of Power
[1:31:08] full of Glory the real
[1:31:11] you but it's the
[1:31:15] same that's
[1:31:17] Redemption that it's finest amen nothing
[1:31:21] will be lost
[1:31:24] fully redeemed completely
[1:31:27] redeemed from glory to glory and is back
[1:31:29] to the original seed with the baptism of
[1:31:33] the Holy Ghost with the same signs same
[1:31:34] wonders same baptism same kind of people
[1:31:37] acting the same way with the same power
[1:31:39] the same
[1:31:40] Sensations it's from Glory unto glory
[1:31:43] and the next will be changed from this
[1:31:47] Glory into a body like his own glorious
[1:31:52] body where we shall see him Abraham saw
[1:31:56] the same I'm still reading from the
[1:31:58] message now notice we see how it was
[1:32:01] changed since Calvary we are invited to
[1:32:04] share his glory I thought that was so
[1:32:06] perfect brother Isaac just just being
[1:32:08] open to the the moving of the Holy
[1:32:10] Spirit and just singing that song of
[1:32:12] being invited to the table we are
[1:32:14] invited to this Glory we're invited to
[1:32:17] be changed amen so he says notice see
[1:32:21] how it was changed from Glory from
[1:32:23] Calvary we are invited to share his
[1:32:25] glory now in 1 Corinthians 12 we are
[1:32:29] baptized into his body by one Spirit
[1:32:32] we're all baptized not by one water one
[1:32:34] Spirit we're all baptized that's right
[1:32:37] now and then we become part of him okay
[1:32:39] so in a nutshell that is how we become
[1:32:41] part of the Lord right is we are
[1:32:43] baptized now so what is his glory we
[1:32:45] still got to answer this
[1:32:47] question what is the glory of
[1:32:51] God 2 Chronicles 5 14 said so that the
[1:32:55] priest could not stand to minister by
[1:32:57] reason of the look at how these things
[1:32:59] are connected by reason of the
[1:33:02] cloud for the glory of the Lord had
[1:33:06] filled the house of
[1:33:08] God so there's a season in their in
[1:33:11] their Journey where they were preparing
[1:33:13] the Tabernacle they put Badger skins on
[1:33:16] it they were making it ready for a
[1:33:18] dwelling place for the lord and there
[1:33:20] came a time when the Lord looked upon it
[1:33:22] and he said everything's in order
[1:33:24] precept upon precept word upon word this
[1:33:26] bride has made herself ready and at the
[1:33:28] season of time what does he do a cloud
[1:33:31] appears and it overshadows this just
[1:33:34] like Mary you are highly favored amen
[1:33:37] and he overshadowed Mary to do what to
[1:33:40] bring glory to her so he comes and he
[1:33:42] and he brings glory and fills the house
[1:33:45] of God it is God looking for a place of
[1:33:48] rest it is God looking for a tabernacle
[1:33:51] why because that is the whole purpose of
[1:33:53] this whole things to redeem you to be
[1:33:55] part of his family
[1:33:57] again the glory of the Lord had filled
[1:34:00] the house of God so we see we're going
[1:34:01] to look at the characteristics of the
[1:34:03] glory of God so that we can understand
[1:34:06] what glory is so there came a time when
[1:34:08] the picture was complete God was happy
[1:34:11] with the scene and he was happy to come
[1:34:13] and dwell therein but it's amazing and
[1:34:16] maybe one day we'll touch on this the
[1:34:18] cloud was present for this okay I'll
[1:34:20] just leave that with you Isaiah 40 and3
[1:34:23] says The Voice of him that crith in the
[1:34:24] wilderness we know who this is a
[1:34:26] prophetic Ministry who was being
[1:34:28] prophesied of that is going to prepare
[1:34:30] the way of the Lord it was going to
[1:34:31] point out who the Lamb of God is amen
[1:34:34] and so he says prepare ye the way of the
[1:34:36] Lord make straight in the desert a
[1:34:38] highway for our God every Valley shall
[1:34:41] be exalted and every mountain and Hill
[1:34:43] shall be made low and the Crooked shall
[1:34:46] be made straight and the rough places
[1:34:47] made plain
[1:34:49] and and the glory of the Lord shall be
[1:34:56] revealed he's going to send a prophet
[1:34:58] who's going to stand in the waters who's
[1:35:01] going to
[1:35:02] reveal why because prophets is the
[1:35:05] secrets of God come to prophets first
[1:35:07] right nothing happens until God unless
[1:35:09] God Reveals His secrets to the prophets
[1:35:12] so he is going to be there he's going to
[1:35:13] be standing in the Waterway and he's
[1:35:15] going to reveal he's going to expose
[1:35:19] he's going to point to the glory of God
[1:35:23] I'm just showing you highlights of what
[1:35:25] is what is this glory of God Amen we're
[1:35:27] going to just approach it from different
[1:35:28] angles so we can see what the glory of
[1:35:30] God is so the glory of the Lord shall be
[1:35:32] revealed and All Flesh shall see it
[1:35:36] together for the mouth of the Lord has
[1:35:38] spoken it in Isaiah uh 40 and 5 in the
[1:35:41] Amplified it says the glory majesty and
[1:35:44] Splendor of the Lord shall be revealed
[1:35:47] his majesty who he is now I want you to
[1:35:50] remember when he was revealed like this
[1:35:52] not everyone saw it yeah but nonetheless
[1:35:55] the glory of that vessel the glory of
[1:35:57] that body would be revealed the prophet
[1:36:00] would point it out there is the Lamb of
[1:36:02] God Amen and the Lord the the the we we
[1:36:06] find a cloud there we find a dove coming
[1:36:08] out from the cloud and we find this
[1:36:10] connection between Heaven and
[1:36:13] Earth the glory of God will be revealed
[1:36:16] God dwelling in a body again amen all
[1:36:19] right John 1:14 let's just look at John
[1:36:23] 1:14 here just for a moment and the Word
[1:36:26] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:36:29] beheld His
[1:36:31] Glory Hallelujah oh he's just a Man from
[1:36:33] Nazareth he's just this he's just that
[1:36:35] no we beheld his glory what does this
[1:36:38] mean Glory you see what I mean in the
[1:36:40] worldly sense there's no glory there
[1:36:43] there's no armies there's no Prestige
[1:36:45] there's no wealth there's none of these
[1:36:47] things going on but when when when the
[1:36:50] scriptures are being written when when
[1:36:51] it declares who this was this is the
[1:36:54] glory of God being
[1:36:55] unveiled you see God's not looking for
[1:36:58] great pump and and Prestige and great
[1:37:00] demonstrations of things he's just
[1:37:02] looking for his own he's looking for his
[1:37:05] family he's looking for his expression
[1:37:07] he's looking for his part in you that's
[1:37:10] his glory that out of the darkness and
[1:37:13] out of the muck and mire of this world
[1:37:14] out of the cursed condition of this
[1:37:16] world that he can bring forth Glory he
[1:37:19] can bring forth Redemption he can bring
[1:37:21] forth Deliverance he can heal the sick
[1:37:24] he can save the Lost he's looking for
[1:37:27] those who will represent that he is the
[1:37:32] Redeemer oh and we beheld his glory the
[1:37:36] glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:37:38] father full of grace and truth in the
[1:37:40] Amplified it says it like this and the
[1:37:42] word Christ became flesh human incarnate
[1:37:46] and tabernacled fixed his tent of Flesh
[1:37:50] and live for a while among us and we we
[1:37:53] actually saw his
[1:37:57] glory in other words we saw his honor we
[1:38:01] saw his value we saw his
[1:38:03] majesty what are we looking at when when
[1:38:06] it says we saw his glory what are we
[1:38:09] looking at and you know what I mean like
[1:38:12] you have to excuse me my brain works
[1:38:13] like this it is terrible because I get
[1:38:16] to a place like this and it's like okay
[1:38:17] I'm looking at his glory what am I
[1:38:19] actually
[1:38:20] seeing because Glory the word Glory like
[1:38:22] that is really
[1:38:24] vague amen or maybe it's just me forgive
[1:38:27] me everybody here who smart and
[1:38:29] understands everything just forgive me
[1:38:31] just put up with me for a few minutes
[1:38:33] but what does this mean I'm looking at
[1:38:35] glory we actually beheld his
[1:38:38] glory so what am I looking at because we
[1:38:42] Tabernacle his glory also so when we
[1:38:45] when we understand what Glory we're
[1:38:46] looking at then what are we looking at
[1:38:48] in
[1:38:51] here amen such Glory as only begotten
[1:38:54] son receives from his father full of
[1:38:56] grace favor loving kindness and Truth
[1:38:59] these are all the things he was looking
[1:39:00] at Exodus 16 and10 says and it came to
[1:39:03] pass and Aaron spake unto the whole
[1:39:05] Congregation of the children of Israel
[1:39:07] that they looked toward the Wilderness
[1:39:09] and behold the glory of the Lord
[1:39:12] appeared in the
[1:39:14] cloud when they looked at the cloud they
[1:39:16] saw the glory of the Lord what were they
[1:39:18] looking
[1:39:20] at just a cloud no there was something
[1:39:23] about this Cloud when they looked at it
[1:39:25] they saw the glory of the Lord It's you
[1:39:28] see what I'm getting at what is the
[1:39:30] glory of God what does this mean the
[1:39:33] glory of
[1:39:35] God I want to know because I Tabernacle
[1:39:38] the glory of God you Tabernacle the
[1:39:40] glory of God but when they looked out
[1:39:42] there in the wilderness they beheld they
[1:39:45] saw the glory of the Lord appearing in a
[1:39:48] cloud that's for another day amen
[1:39:50] appearing in a cloud and behold the
[1:39:52] glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud
[1:39:54] which went before them this this is the
[1:39:56] cloud that was traveling with them
[1:39:58] through the Wilderness a cloud that
[1:40:00] follows you
[1:40:02] around you know normally that that's a
[1:40:05] negative thing right you have have this
[1:40:07] Cloud following you around no this was a
[1:40:09] positive thing it meant protection it it
[1:40:11] meant identification we have this Cloud
[1:40:14] following us around amen and in the
[1:40:18] cloud the glory of the Lord
[1:40:21] appeared what is the glory of the Lord
[1:40:23] we'll get there eventually maybe I
[1:40:26] should save it for tomorrow morning hey
[1:40:27] brother
[1:40:29] Ben okay a cloud expressing or
[1:40:34] tabernacling the glory of the Lord so
[1:40:37] even This Cloud BEC becomes a focal
[1:40:39] point becomes a veil becomes a
[1:40:42] tabernacle for the glory of the Lord
[1:40:45] okay this is very important as we move
[1:40:48] forward Christ the brightness of the of
[1:40:50] his father's Glory the express image of
[1:40:52] his person
[1:40:54] appearing in a
[1:40:56] cloud so okay what is Glory we need to
[1:41:00] get down to this because I can see some
[1:41:01] of you are just on the edge of your
[1:41:04] seat what is Glory when the Bible is
[1:41:06] talking about the glory of God as
[1:41:08] Tabernacle in glory what is he saying we
[1:41:11] have to go kind of back to the original
[1:41:12] language use right to figure out what
[1:41:15] does it mean the glory of God this word
[1:41:19] it is to mean properly if I'm just
[1:41:21] reading it right out of the strongs here
[1:41:23] properly it means
[1:41:26] weight w we i g HT weight for instance
[1:41:33] this Bible I don't know how heavy it is
[1:41:36] but it weighs a certain value right and
[1:41:40] we can measure the weight of this Bible
[1:41:44] so this Bible has a certain
[1:41:49] Glory you see where I'm going this Bible
[1:41:52] has a certain Glory glory to it and it's
[1:41:55] measurable if there was three pages
[1:41:57] missing out of this book it would not be
[1:42:00] the same Glory anymore but you see if it
[1:42:03] was adding as they were printing this
[1:42:05] Bible and they were adding pages into it
[1:42:07] and finishing it and finally you know
[1:42:09] they were putting on the leather it was
[1:42:11] being changed from glory to glory until
[1:42:14] finally it comes to its full Glory it
[1:42:16] can now be glorified it has reached the
[1:42:20] exact weight of what it's intended to
[1:42:24] be it can be measured by
[1:42:28] weight so the glory is weight it is to
[1:42:33] literally be
[1:42:35] heavy so when the Lord fills us with his
[1:42:38] glory it's a wait just think of Ruth
[1:42:41] when she was there with with with Boaz
[1:42:44] in the tent and it was going to come a
[1:42:46] season when he would would extend His
[1:42:49] Garment it would apply a certain weight
[1:42:51] upon her and that weight changed her her
[1:42:55] position she was now not just Ruth uh
[1:42:59] you know out in the fields and so forth
[1:43:01] the the the Gentile you know now she was
[1:43:03] going to come under his headship it was
[1:43:05] changing position she was being changed
[1:43:07] from one dwelling place to another she
[1:43:09] was being changed from one glory to
[1:43:12] another because of a weight that came
[1:43:13] upon
[1:43:15] her a certain
[1:43:18] heaviness this this Glory that we feel
[1:43:21] it is it is tangible it's got a
[1:43:24] measurable uh uh value to
[1:43:29] it the glory of the Lord appeared in the
[1:43:35] cloud it's something real it's to make
[1:43:38] weighty I I I think it's amazing how the
[1:43:41] the the dictionary here in the in the
[1:43:43] strongs it says to make self
[1:43:49] many okay let's move on you can go look
[1:43:51] up this word glory in the Bible it is
[1:43:54] remarkable if you move forward a little
[1:43:57] bit in the definitions it also means
[1:43:59] wealth obviously you know because that's
[1:44:01] generally what comes to our minds being
[1:44:02] carnal we think of wealth we think of
[1:44:04] prestige we think of of great things
[1:44:06] tributes or
[1:44:09] Treasures right Treasures it means
[1:44:11] abundance wealth treasure but but
[1:44:14] specifically when it's speaking about
[1:44:16] treasure and you using the word Glory it
[1:44:18] is a measurable treasure it is something
[1:44:21] that has come to us full
[1:44:26] fullness in Revelations 21 and 24 it
[1:44:29] says and the nations of them which were
[1:44:30] saved shall walk in the light of it and
[1:44:34] the kings of the earth do bring their
[1:44:36] Glory and Honor into it it bring they
[1:44:39] bring their treasure their wealth they
[1:44:42] bring their tributes into the
[1:44:45] city now look at this here just to shine
[1:44:47] a little light on this it being weighted
[1:44:51] measured second Corinth Ians 4 and 17
[1:44:54] says for our light Affliction which is
[1:44:57] but for a moment worketh for us a far
[1:45:00] more exceeding and
[1:45:03] eternal weight of
[1:45:07] Glory very
[1:45:09] specific so here's the original you on
[1:45:13] this side and it has a certain weight
[1:45:17] right now over here maybe you're just as
[1:45:20] small right Pretend This a
[1:45:24] and it's a different just a different
[1:45:25] weight right but there's a connection
[1:45:27] between the two and over time right we
[1:45:30] come through this time sequence this
[1:45:32] little little dip in from eternity right
[1:45:35] we come through here and we are being
[1:45:36] changed from Glory unto glory to bring
[1:45:38] you out exactly to the same weight you
[1:45:40] were over
[1:45:42] here but now if you're going through
[1:45:45] this process here and you're and you're
[1:45:46] still you know small like this and
[1:45:48] you're coming through this process and
[1:45:50] through this little time sequence this
[1:45:52] little space of time a little Vapor
[1:45:54] right just this little nothing but if
[1:45:56] you come through the space of time these
[1:45:59] light
[1:46:00] afflictions these little things we deal
[1:46:02] with right it's not a big deal right
[1:46:03] nobody here goes through stress or
[1:46:06] anything like that nothing is really
[1:46:07] overwhelming it's it's light
[1:46:10] afflictions compared to the
[1:46:14] glory that is here okay so do you see
[1:46:18] what something's happening there's a
[1:46:19] comparison so the scriptures when it
[1:46:21] talks about Glory there's a comparison
[1:46:23] between the original and where you are
[1:46:25] now and your destination which is
[1:46:27] basically back here again right so
[1:46:29] there's a comparison and is saying that
[1:46:31] that the things that are happening to us
[1:46:33] now for our light Affliction this weight
[1:46:35] so the afflictions we go through also
[1:46:37] have a glory it is also weighed out it
[1:46:40] is measured in other words the Lord does
[1:46:42] not allow anything to happen to you
[1:46:44] beyond what you can handle it is
[1:46:46] measured out it is weighed up amen and
[1:46:49] it is distributed exactly the way it
[1:46:51] should be amen it is all pled out it's
[1:46:53] all predestinated it's almost boring
[1:46:56] I'll be honest with you it's almost
[1:46:58] boring right because it's
[1:47:03] fixed in other words it should bring us
[1:47:06] peace today everything is weighed out
[1:47:09] everything is measured out everything is
[1:47:10] so the the hairs of your head are
[1:47:13] numbered praise the Lord right so some
[1:47:18] people are laughing at me now so
[1:47:21] everything's weighed out in this light
[1:47:22] of Affliction our light Affliction which
[1:47:25] is for but a moment worketh for us far
[1:47:27] more exceeding an eternal weight it is
[1:47:30] changing
[1:47:32] usen don't be afraid of the light
[1:47:36] afflictions that is working for out a
[1:47:38] Eternal Eternal weight of Glory a
[1:47:43] complete picture full salvation full
[1:47:46] Redemption full adoption full
[1:47:49] weight so there's a comparison so the
[1:47:52] scriptures is is is starting to
[1:47:55] show that there's a comparison there's
[1:47:57] there's this expression when when the
[1:48:00] you know when God is in the invisible
[1:48:02] realm that he needed an expression he
[1:48:05] needed something to point back that is
[1:48:07] tangible so there's this comparison
[1:48:09] always there's always these parallels
[1:48:11] running there's always these comparisons
[1:48:13] or Expressions pointing back at one
[1:48:15] another like the sun points back to God
[1:48:18] right but it everything has a certain
[1:48:21] glory to it do you understand what I'm
[1:48:23] saying amen so even as as we go through
[1:48:26] these light a afflictions everything is
[1:48:28] is pointing us is it is changing us it
[1:48:32] is changing our expression it is
[1:48:33] bringing us to the fullness just like
[1:48:35] Jesus Christ on that day he said now can
[1:48:37] the son of man be glorify those light
[1:48:40] afflictions that would come by his way I
[1:48:43] say that very R reverently that would
[1:48:45] come by his way it would produce it
[1:48:48] would change it would magnify it would
[1:48:51] bring his weight in glory to the per
[1:48:53] perfect sum of all the Prophecies of
[1:48:57] everything that was in the mind of
[1:48:58] Christ it would bring out all the
[1:49:00] manifestation of everything that was
[1:49:02] written of
[1:49:07] him so there's a comparison so when we
[1:49:10] are talking about Glory think of it like
[1:49:12] that it's a scale you know the old
[1:49:15] scales I know the kids probably don't
[1:49:17] know what these are when we were working
[1:49:18] in the automation industry we still had
[1:49:20] to go back to these scales to prove the
[1:49:23] digital stuff right so anyway we have
[1:49:26] these scales so on on one side you know
[1:49:28] there'll be two dishes like this you got
[1:49:30] this little triangle like so and if you
[1:49:32] put you know 10 lbs on this side and you
[1:49:34] put 20 lbs on this side it's going to be
[1:49:36] off balance right and the scales will
[1:49:39] tip right so what is he saying the glory
[1:49:42] that is over here the original Glory he
[1:49:45] wants you to come to a place where the
[1:49:47] it's weighted perfectly where the
[1:49:50] expression is is perfectly balanced
[1:49:53] across that's why you know legalism in
[1:49:56] the message that's why these distorted
[1:49:58] views things like that it doesn't
[1:50:00] balance out it's something is off and it
[1:50:02] doesn't bring the right Glory it's not
[1:50:05] the right picture amen but there's a
[1:50:07] glory that God brings out of your life
[1:50:10] and the idea is is to Fashion you to
[1:50:12] mold you he's the Potter we are the clay
[1:50:14] he's you're on the potter's wheel on
[1:50:16] this side and he's making you fashioning
[1:50:18] you allows a trial to come by this way
[1:50:20] why because he's taking a little
[1:50:21] milligram off here and a little ounce
[1:50:23] over here and a little piece over there
[1:50:25] and maybe drying it out a little bit
[1:50:26] more why because he's going to balance
[1:50:29] it out till one day you see him face to
[1:50:33] face you can look across the CM and you
[1:50:36] can look at at the word of God you can
[1:50:38] look through the word through that Veil
[1:50:40] and you can see
[1:50:42] yourself the mystery of Christ revealed
[1:50:45] is Christ in you but there come a day
[1:50:48] when we are changed so much we'll look
[1:50:50] across the table and you'll see yourself
[1:50:52] in here
[1:50:53] him it'll be perfectly
[1:50:56] weighted then this body can be
[1:51:02] [Music]
[1:51:04] glorified not sure where we are with
[1:51:06] time I'll just go on for a little bit if
[1:51:07] that's okay brother Ben you just you
[1:51:09] just shake your head or something
[1:51:13] if okay so it's about a comparison it's
[1:51:18] about being redeemed back if you are
[1:51:21] redeemable I mean it's so many things we
[1:51:23] could bring in here right it's a it's
[1:51:25] about going back to the original and it
[1:51:27] and it's not like a digressing but it's
[1:51:29] to the full image is to be weighted out
[1:51:32] perfectly to bring the right
[1:51:34] Glory all right so when when they saw
[1:51:38] the uh glory of the Lord appearing in
[1:51:40] the cloud that expression was weighed
[1:51:43] out exactly with what was in The
[1:51:45] Invisible and it was showing now in the
[1:51:47] visible realm exactly what was in The
[1:51:49] Invisible and it showed forth the glory
[1:51:52] of of the Lord that expression becomes
[1:51:55] perfectly weighted it is the
[1:52:00] same that is True Glory when it is
[1:52:04] Christ in you when it is the same so
[1:52:08] much so that when when people look at us
[1:52:10] brother brandham says it like this he
[1:52:11] says when they look at us will they see
[1:52:13] Christ not Chris will they see Christ
[1:52:16] will they will will we have been
[1:52:18] weighted so will we have gone through
[1:52:20] enough trials will we our character have
[1:52:22] been refined kind enough to the place
[1:52:23] where the true glory of the Lord can
[1:52:26] shine forth where it's not about your
[1:52:27] reputation anymore it's not about my
[1:52:29] opinions anymore it's not about how I
[1:52:31] feel anymore it's not about My
[1:52:33] reasonings it's about Lord what is the
[1:52:35] expression you want to bring from my
[1:52:36] life what is your will for me Lord I'm
[1:52:38] willing to go wherever you want we're
[1:52:41] talking about invitations earlier you
[1:52:42] know brother brandham is's a hunter
[1:52:45] right he was a hunter and he was going
[1:52:47] down that that mountain and the storm
[1:52:49] was brewing and he knew in his in his in
[1:52:52] in his Hunter expertise he knew that
[1:52:54] that this is bad he needs to get away
[1:52:56] from the storm he needs to get down into
[1:52:57] the mount to to back to base camp where
[1:53:00] it's safe that's the logical thing to do
[1:53:03] but there was a glory that was waiting
[1:53:04] for him in the storm there was something
[1:53:07] about brother brandham that was waiting
[1:53:09] for him in the storm and it could only
[1:53:10] be measured out inside the storm there
[1:53:14] was no way for him to get that Glory or
[1:53:16] to get that extra gram or to be changed
[1:53:19] from glory to glory down there in base
[1:53:21] camp where it felt comfortable where it
[1:53:24] was safe where it was nice and cozy by a
[1:53:26] warm fire no he heard a voice that said
[1:53:29] come back into the storm there was a a
[1:53:33] voice that called him why because the
[1:53:35] his maker was refining him and he was
[1:53:37] looking at the the weight on this side
[1:53:39] and the weight on this side and he was
[1:53:41] saying I got to bring you further I got
[1:53:43] to change you more from glory to glory
[1:53:45] Come Back Into the Storm come back into
[1:53:47] The Potter's House come back on the
[1:53:50] potter's wheel don't be afraid I know
[1:53:53] everything inside of you wants to run
[1:53:54] the other way everything inside of you
[1:53:56] wants to quit and give up and we're
[1:53:58] weary and we're tiresome and then we
[1:54:00] hear this voice come up a little higher
[1:54:03] come a little farther come a little
[1:54:06] deeper and it takes another dying out it
[1:54:10] takes another uh uh resisting and it
[1:54:12] takes another throwing down our
[1:54:14] reasonings and casting aside fears it
[1:54:16] takes more faith it takes more
[1:54:19] stretching but we got to go and take
[1:54:21] that invit
[1:54:22] Lord I hear your voice it doesn't make
[1:54:25] sense it looks hard it looks rough but
[1:54:28] oh my just look at the Potter's
[1:54:31] hands it's his hands in the storm that
[1:54:34] is going to make sure that you're
[1:54:36] weighted just right so that the life
[1:54:38] that light that shines from your life
[1:54:41] will be the exact expression that he
[1:54:43] wanted from you before the foundation of
[1:54:45] the world you may wonder why you go
[1:54:47] through hard times when friends leave
[1:54:50] you and churches upset you pastors uh
[1:54:53] disappoint you and and mothers uh cast
[1:54:56] you aside whatever it may be my brother
[1:54:58] and sister all these things have been
[1:54:59] fashioned for be by The Loving Hands of
[1:55:02] God by his tender loving care his Mercy
[1:55:05] his grace why because he's weighing out
[1:55:07] Glory out of your life there's a
[1:55:10] treasure in your life that is measured
[1:55:14] out and he wants to bring glory to
[1:55:16] himself it's him that he's looking at
[1:55:19] you know come you come to a place where
[1:55:20] it's like Lord I can't even I don't even
[1:55:23] know how to figure out tomorrow I don't
[1:55:24] even know how to take the next step I
[1:55:26] don't even know what to do just keep
[1:55:28] walking with the
[1:55:30] Lord keep trusting in the Lord because
[1:55:33] the the scales are
[1:55:35] balancing hallelu maybe we still have
[1:55:38] too much of
[1:55:40] ourselves maybe we have too much of
[1:55:42] ourselves still huh it'll take a little
[1:55:44] bit more refining to balance those
[1:55:46] weights and then when the bride has made
[1:55:49] herself
[1:55:50] ready oh we shall see him as he is we
[1:55:54] shall see his reflection in us when they
[1:55:57] look at us it'll only be Christ the life
[1:56:00] and I live it's not my own Paul
[1:56:03] said but it took a refining and brother
[1:56:06] Brandon goes back into that storm and in
[1:56:08] the storm oh it's such a beautiful scene
[1:56:11] in that storm where it was supposed to
[1:56:13] take his life it changed
[1:56:15] him that invitation should have should
[1:56:18] have caused his death but it brought
[1:56:20] life so much so you can go read that
[1:56:23] story again if you want to refresh your
[1:56:24] memory but so much so that what he said
[1:56:26] he was walking and he says every thought
[1:56:28] I had was like a young man I was I felt
[1:56:32] young again and I looked at my himself
[1:56:34] and he and he was young he was going
[1:56:37] through a change being changed from
[1:56:39] Glory onto Glory one of these days we'll
[1:56:41] go through the same thing it might be an
[1:56:43] invitation back into a storm it may be a
[1:56:45] trial it might be some light Affliction
[1:56:47] but my brother and sister don't be
[1:56:48] afraid he's refining the weights so that
[1:56:51] one day the T will come and everything
[1:56:53] will just be right and just perfect and
[1:56:56] then you will look and you'll see it's
[1:56:57] Christ it's you
[1:56:59] lord it's you it's always been about
[1:57:02] [Applause]
[1:57:06] you I am you in that day you shall know
[1:57:09] that I am in you and you are in me and I
[1:57:11] am in the
[1:57:12] father everything will be weighted and
[1:57:16] the glory you will be
[1:57:20] glorified but he went through the St
[1:57:22] more how many he is going to turn down
[1:57:25] the next invitation not
[1:57:27] me not me I said Lord give me strength
[1:57:31] in the trials Give Me Faith Lord give me
[1:57:34] what I need but I'm
[1:57:36] coming I'm coming what is in your heart
[1:57:40] go do it quickly
[1:57:41] Satan amen go do it quickly now can the
[1:57:46] son of man be
[1:57:47] glorified we you see what I'm saying we
[1:57:49] have control over these things we have
[1:57:52] power we have
[1:57:53] authority because there's a measurable
[1:57:57] weight there's a picture of you before
[1:57:59] the foundation of the world it's
[1:58:00] measured out every hair the eye color
[1:58:04] the way you will be your position in the
[1:58:06] body it's all weighed out there's a
[1:58:08] glory there's a value there's a purpose
[1:58:10] to your
[1:58:11] life and you cannot fail Hall cannot
[1:58:18] fail so there's a reflection it's
[1:58:20] pointing to each other
[1:58:23] amen Exodus 28 and 2 says and thou shalt
[1:58:27] make holy garments for Aaron thy brother
[1:58:30] for Glory so even the garments that the
[1:58:34] priesthood of of of that day they they
[1:58:36] had to wear specific garments the
[1:58:38] garments were made in a specific way why
[1:58:41] to signify the glory of the Unseen make
[1:58:45] garments for thy brother a for Aaron thy
[1:58:48] brother for Glory and for beauty oh
[1:58:52] could talk about Aaron's garments
[1:58:53] because it had the breastplate on there
[1:58:55] with the names of the tribes and that
[1:58:58] whole expression of that priesthood was
[1:59:01] a glory it was a measurable it was an
[1:59:05] identifiable Glory uh uh uh weight that
[1:59:08] you could look at and and identify with
[1:59:10] there's me in that stone there's me
[1:59:13] that's my name on that stone there I
[1:59:15] belong to that Tribe of Benjamin I
[1:59:16] belong to that tribe of Judah and I'm on
[1:59:18] the breastplate of that it's a
[1:59:20] reflection of who you are in the
[1:59:22] priesthood so go and make garments for
[1:59:25] the priesthood that will reflect the
[1:59:27] glory they will be for Glory they will
[1:59:29] be for wait for a balance so when that
[1:59:32] priest goes in behind the veil he's your
[1:59:37] representation oh we could preach on
[1:59:39] that for an hour or
[1:59:41] two you see what I mean the glory is
[1:59:44] used for a record it is used for
[1:59:48] balancing the scales
[1:59:55] let's talk about woman's hair for a
[1:59:57] moment huh isn't that
[2:00:00] beautiful I look at all the sisters here
[2:00:02] today with their
[2:00:05] Glory what does that glory mean what do
[2:00:07] your hair
[2:00:09] mean 1 Corinthians 11:7 says for a man
[2:00:12] indeed ought not to cover his head for
[2:00:15] as much as he is the image and glory of
[2:00:20] God so do you see what that means now
[2:00:23] you're a
[2:00:24] reflection you represent him men you
[2:00:27] represent God that's why we don't cover
[2:00:30] our heads because we have a different
[2:00:33] Glory than the woman the woman has a
[2:00:36] different Glory from us but it's weighed
[2:00:40] exactly right to measure or to be a help
[2:00:44] meet or to be in reflection to mirror
[2:00:47] who we represent who we have come to
[2:00:50] know who we are known
[2:00:56] by for as much as he is the image and
[2:00:59] glory of God but the woman is the glory
[2:01:03] of the
[2:01:05] man verse 15 says but if a woman have
[2:01:08] long hair it is a glory to
[2:01:11] her for her hair is given her for a
[2:01:15] covering so it's
[2:01:17] measured there's something about a
[2:01:19] woman's hair when you look at the
[2:01:21] woman's hair hair it is literally
[2:01:23] weighed perfectly across the scale as a
[2:01:27] representation that she is under that
[2:01:30] man's headship she's under his
[2:01:32] protection she's under his wisdom she or
[2:01:35] lack of wisdom under his wisdom under
[2:01:38] his care under his love amen but that
[2:01:41] hair is weighed perfectly it's a
[2:01:44] representation it signifies that she
[2:01:47] belongs to
[2:01:49] Somebody That Glory of the woman it is a
[2:01:52] reflection of your husband the headship
[2:01:54] of your husband and the husband we are a
[2:01:57] reflection we have a glory we are made
[2:02:00] in the image of God and so that
[2:02:02] represents God to to people here on the
[2:02:04] earth we are that other side of the
[2:02:07] scale and then again the woman is the
[2:02:09] other side of the scale representing the
[2:02:11] man even though they look different the
[2:02:13] Moon looks different from the Sun have
[2:02:16] you noticed how the world is trying to
[2:02:17] make this all neutral diluted because
[2:02:22] knows that when those scales are met
[2:02:25] when the scales balance out everything's
[2:02:27] going to
[2:02:29] change and so he tries to take away the
[2:02:31] glory of the woman he tries to take away
[2:02:33] the glory of the man whose headship over
[2:02:35] the W woman amen Godly headship over the
[2:02:37] woman woman is under her husband's head
[2:02:40] right but her hair signifies that she
[2:02:43] understands that she is is a reflection
[2:02:46] that she sees the measure she sees the
[2:02:48] weight of Glory in her husband
[2:02:52] just like the church sees it in Christ
[2:02:55] amen so do you see this concept this
[2:02:57] principle throughout the scriptures that
[2:03:00] Glory means weighted against each other
[2:03:03] it's weighed against each other you know
[2:03:05] the Old Testament all the stories of the
[2:03:08] Old Testament are therefore our
[2:03:10] example all the laws all the the
[2:03:12] Traditions all those things are a
[2:03:15] reflection of what was
[2:03:17] coming you see how that works
[2:03:24] now Moses was afraid to look at
[2:03:28] God in Exodus 3 And1 it says now Moses
[2:03:31] kept the flock of Jethro his
[2:03:32] father-in-law the priest of Midian and
[2:03:34] he led the flock to the backside of the
[2:03:36] desert and came to the Mountain of God
[2:03:37] even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord
[2:03:40] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[2:03:42] of the midst of a bush he looked and
[2:03:46] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[2:03:48] Bush was not consumed Moses said I will
[2:03:51] now turn aside and see this great sight
[2:03:54] why the bush is not
[2:03:56] burnt excuse me and when the Lord saw
[2:03:58] that he turned aside to see God called
[2:04:00] unto him out of the midst of the Bush he
[2:04:02] said Moses Moses and he said here am
[2:04:05] I and he said draw not nigh hither put
[2:04:09] off thy shoes from off thy feet for the
[2:04:12] place whereon thou standest is Holy
[2:04:16] Ground moreover he said I am the god of
[2:04:19] thy father the god of Abraham the god of
[2:04:21] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[2:04:24] his face the Bible says Moses hid his
[2:04:28] face for he was afraid to look upon God
[2:04:31] I'm not just making this up this is in
[2:04:32] the scripture you know we talk about the
[2:04:35] presence of the Lord we talk about
[2:04:37] coming face to face face with God and
[2:04:39] and we we picture this huge Revival this
[2:04:42] great demonstration of refreshing all
[2:04:44] those things are fine I'm not speaking
[2:04:46] against that but I'm talking
[2:04:47] specifically about coming face to face
[2:04:50] with God your maker face to face with
[2:04:53] God Almighty on sacred Sands where to
[2:04:57] even get there we have to take our shoes
[2:04:59] off we have to approach him in in
[2:05:01] humility in reverence with a head bowed
[2:05:03] so much so that when Moses Moses was a
[2:05:06] prince in Egypt Moses commanded men and
[2:05:09] arms and and he and he and he built
[2:05:11] cities and he was a great man of renown
[2:05:14] and here suddenly he comes into the
[2:05:16] place of this strange atmosphere he's
[2:05:18] never been in an atmosphere like that
[2:05:20] before well was happening he was being
[2:05:22] changed from Glory unto Glory the real
[2:05:24] Moses was going to be revealed the real
[2:05:28] Moses was going to be on Veil that that
[2:05:31] measured portion of Glory was going to
[2:05:33] be weighed in the scales amen and so
[2:05:35] here we find him coming on the sacred
[2:05:37] grounds and and and it was so much so
[2:05:39] that when he came into the presence of
[2:05:40] the Lord there was the pillar of fire
[2:05:42] burning in the bush the Bush was not
[2:05:44] affected by
[2:05:46] it but he hid his face just like Adam
[2:05:49] hid his face from God when he came into
[2:05:52] his
[2:05:54] presence he was afraid to look upon God
[2:05:58] isn't that amazing afraid to look and we
[2:06:01] and we so quickly we say I want to look
[2:06:04] at his
[2:06:05] face I want to come face to face with
[2:06:09] God it's a hard
[2:06:11] thing we go through these trials we go
[2:06:14] through the things we face and we almost
[2:06:16] turn our
[2:06:18] face
[2:06:19] right the Lord said I have surely seen
[2:06:22] the Affliction of my people which are in
[2:06:24] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[2:06:26] of their taskmasters for I know their
[2:06:28] sorrows and I am come down I am come
[2:06:32] down it's so beautiful because remember
[2:06:34] who went down Moses actually did but I
[2:06:37] am come down the Lord
[2:06:39] descending right we're talking about
[2:06:41] glories right we're talking about scales
[2:06:43] and all these things this harmony
[2:06:45] between God and and man I am come down
[2:06:49] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[2:06:51] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[2:06:52] that land unto a good land and a large
[2:06:55] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[2:06:57] unto the place of the Canaanites the
[2:06:58] hites the amorites the perizzites the
[2:07:00] hivites and the jebusites come now
[2:07:02] therefore and I will send thee unto
[2:07:04] Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth the
[2:07:06] people the children of Israel out of
[2:07:09] Egypt so we we see this picture where he
[2:07:12] comes and he's now afraid to he's afraid
[2:07:14] to look at God but he is commission
[2:07:16] there's a commission upon his life that
[2:07:18] he must go down there I will come down
[2:07:19] I'm going to go with you I will send
[2:07:21] amongst them amen we know the story I
[2:07:23] don't really want to focus so much on
[2:07:25] the story I want to just hit these
[2:07:26] highlights of of the journey that Moses
[2:07:28] was on now first time he goes up to get
[2:07:31] the law we find this in Exodus 24:15 and
[2:07:34] Moses went up into the mount and a cloud
[2:07:38] covered the mount here again we see the
[2:07:40] cloud covering a mountain and the glory
[2:07:43] of the Lord Cloud glory of the Lord
[2:07:47] right glory of the Lord Abode upon Mount
[2:07:49] Si and the cloud covered it 6 days very
[2:07:54] specific six days and the seventh day in
[2:07:57] the seventh day there's a voice that
[2:08:00] comes out from the cloud and calls Moses
[2:08:03] and he calls unto Moses out of the midst
[2:08:05] of the cloud I hope you're catching
[2:08:08] what's happening here and the sight of
[2:08:11] the glory of the Lord was like a
[2:08:13] devouring fire Paul met this fire on the
[2:08:17] way to em uh Damascus Amen on the top of
[2:08:21] the mountain in the eyes of the children
[2:08:23] of Israel and Moses went into the midst
[2:08:25] of the cloud so now he's going into the
[2:08:27] midst of the cloud and got him up into
[2:08:31] the mount and Moses was in the mount 40
[2:08:33] days and 40 nights that's a long time to
[2:08:37] be in this presence in this place Exodus
[2:08:41] 33 and12 and Moses said unto the Lord
[2:08:44] see thou sayest unto me bring up this
[2:08:46] people and thou Hast not let me know
[2:08:48] whom thou will send with me yet thou
[2:08:51] Hast said I Know Thee by name God had
[2:08:54] spoken to him remember these experiences
[2:08:56] that Moses has with the Lord God is
[2:08:59] actually communing with Moses with his
[2:09:01] creation and he's telling him this is
[2:09:03] the real you this is who you are this is
[2:09:06] what I've called you to do you thought
[2:09:07] you were going to do it as an Egyptian
[2:09:09] uh with the with the armies of Egypt
[2:09:12] maybe or maybe you thought you were
[2:09:13] going to cause a rebellion or a coup but
[2:09:15] I'm going to show you really what is on
[2:09:17] the other side of the scale who the real
[2:09:19] you is it's going to be just you and me
[2:09:22] Moses me and
[2:09:28] you and the glory of the Lord Abode upon
[2:09:30] Mount Si sorry um ver uh chapter 3312
[2:09:34] and Moses said unto the Lord thou sayest
[2:09:36] unto me bring up this people and thou
[2:09:38] has not let me know whom thou will send
[2:09:39] with me yet thou has said I Know Thee by
[2:09:42] name and thou Hast also found Grace in
[2:09:44] my sight and therefore I pray thee if I
[2:09:47] have found Grace in thy sight show me
[2:09:48] now thy way that I may know thee that I
[2:09:52] may find Grace in thy sight and consider
[2:09:55] that this nation is thy people this is
[2:09:58] Moses speaking to God before he was
[2:10:01] afraid he turned his face away but
[2:10:03] trials and suffering and light
[2:10:06] afflictions has cause them now to look
[2:10:08] into the word to look into the cloud to
[2:10:11] look into these things and say Lord Now
[2:10:13] teach me your ways teach me what my name
[2:10:15] is teach me who I am in your kingdom
[2:10:18] teach me how this will come to pass and
[2:10:20] remember that this nation is thy people
[2:10:23] he said my presence shall go with thee
[2:10:26] and I will give thee rest and he said
[2:10:29] unto him If thy presence go not with me
[2:10:31] carry us not up hence for where it shall
[2:10:35] be known here that I and thy people have
[2:10:37] found Grace in thy sight how will the
[2:10:40] the nation know how will people know
[2:10:42] that I have found Grace in thy sight is
[2:10:44] it not that thou goes with us so shall
[2:10:46] we be separated I and thy people and
[2:10:49] from all the people that are upon the
[2:10:51] face of the earth and the Lord said unto
[2:10:53] Moses I do this thing also that thou
[2:10:55] Hast spoken for thou Hast found Grace in
[2:10:58] my sight and I Know Thee by name and he
[2:11:04] said I beseech thee look at the Turning
[2:11:07] of the
[2:11:09] face so
[2:11:12] Peter when he stood in front of Jesus he
[2:11:15] stood face to face with him but there
[2:11:17] came a time where it wasn't just looking
[2:11:19] at Jesus Christ anymore he was looking
[2:11:20] through the
[2:11:22] veil he he looked
[2:11:24] fully right not looking through a g
[2:11:27] glass Darkly he looks fully into the
[2:11:29] face this he looked through the veil and
[2:11:32] he saw the face of God he saw the glory
[2:11:34] of God Thou Art the Son of God Amen Thou
[2:11:38] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[2:11:41] and what happened right it was God
[2:11:43] revealed that to him we know the story
[2:11:44] right so here here we see this this sort
[2:11:47] of a courage that comes up in in Moses
[2:11:49] and he turns and he and he and he
[2:11:51] realizes there's more I need to see him
[2:11:54] face to face who is this that is talking
[2:11:56] to me what is happening I've heard your
[2:11:58] voice I've heard about you and you and
[2:12:00] we've had this journey together so far
[2:12:02] but the trials are getting harder and
[2:12:05] trickier and there's a greater evil in
[2:12:07] the day I I'm going to need more than
[2:12:09] just the experience that I've had I'm
[2:12:11] going to need to know you more I need to
[2:12:13] go deeper with you and so I'm turning my
[2:12:16] face to the my
[2:12:18] maker you see what's happening here
[2:12:21] I beseech thee show me thy Glory show me
[2:12:24] the weight show me the full measure show
[2:12:27] me the full mystery unveil to me the
[2:12:30] mystery that I have in
[2:12:33] you show me thy glory and he said I will
[2:12:37] make all my goodness pass before
[2:12:40] thee that should have been good enough
[2:12:43] and I will Proclaim look what Revelation
[2:12:46] comes out from the cloud out from this
[2:12:49] communion that he's having when he turns
[2:12:50] his face towards his maker and he says
[2:12:53] show me thy Glory he starts with
[2:12:56] identifying who he is he says and I will
[2:13:00] proclaim the name of the Lord before
[2:13:02] thee and will be gracious to whom I will
[2:13:05] be gracious so when the cloud shows up
[2:13:07] and the presence of the Lord shows up
[2:13:09] the name of the Lord is revealed so that
[2:13:11] we can measure him out so we know what
[2:13:14] our name
[2:13:16] is you know when a boy sees a girl he's
[2:13:19] attracted to her yada yada y right and
[2:13:23] he gets to this place where what is your
[2:13:26] name right it's important it's an
[2:13:29] identifier so he turns now it's it's
[2:13:31] measurable and now I can tell where you
[2:13:33] are from now I can tell who your family
[2:13:35] is I can tell your your personality
[2:13:38] traits because I can see your family
[2:13:40] right the name says a lot about a person
[2:13:42] it's a weight of Glory it's a value
[2:13:46] right and will be gracious to whom I
[2:13:48] will be gracious and will show Mercy on
[2:13:50] whom I will show mercy and he said thou
[2:13:53] c not see my
[2:13:56] face for there shall no man see me and
[2:14:00] live o we've re we've hit this like
[2:14:06] roadblock thou can not see my face for
[2:14:10] there shall no man see me and live I
[2:14:14] want to see his
[2:14:16] glory but he's saying that if I look the
[2:14:19] way it reads here if that I see it if I
[2:14:21] see my reflection if I see the
[2:14:25] fullness of him his his glory if I see
[2:14:29] him face to face he's saying that I will
[2:14:31] not live that's what it's
[2:14:33] saying for there shall no man see me and
[2:14:36] live what does this mean remember we're
[2:14:38] talking about the glory of God what does
[2:14:39] it mean to look at the face of God to
[2:14:41] look at the glory of God we say I want
[2:14:44] to see his
[2:14:46] glory well to look at this a little
[2:14:48] further if you I I don't know where we
[2:14:50] are in time but I'll just go through
[2:14:52] this one story we're we're only on page
[2:14:57] seven see some worried
[2:14:59] [Laughter]
[2:15:00] looks right let's all stand up for a
[2:15:04] second praise the Lord let's sit
[2:15:09] down all right just be 5 10
[2:15:13] minutes I want to talk about Jacob for a
[2:15:16] second because he said that if we see
[2:15:18] his face we shall not live this is like
[2:15:20] a road block and and Moses has come to
[2:15:23] this place now it's amazing how the Lord
[2:15:25] um he how he's training his man you know
[2:15:28] how he is he is he is sanding off the
[2:15:33] rough edges to make it weight out
[2:15:35] properly right he he's working on Moses
[2:15:38] and look at how he does this he he's
[2:15:39] saying no man can see me and live so
[2:15:42] let's look at Jacob real quick in
[2:15:43] Genesis 32 and and 24 and Jacob was left
[2:15:47] alone that's a good place to be with the
[2:15:48] lord and there wrestled Amy man with him
[2:15:52] until the breaking of the day so many
[2:15:54] beautiful parallels here and when he saw
[2:15:56] that he prevailed not against him he
[2:15:59] touched the hollow of his thigh and the
[2:16:01] hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint
[2:16:04] as he wrestled with him I mean these two
[2:16:07] men are are wrestling they have come in
[2:16:09] contact here's a man called Jacob he's
[2:16:12] gotone a hold of an Angel he's gone a
[2:16:14] hold of God Amen in the form of a man
[2:16:17] he's G he's gone to a place where he can
[2:16:19] handle God can you imagine that handle
[2:16:23] God he's he's wrestling out with God and
[2:16:26] Jacob I mean he is in such a mess his
[2:16:29] life is is in disarray he's about to
[2:16:32] meet Esau he's got he's got his his his
[2:16:35] father-in-law on his back I mean
[2:16:37] everything is is going against him how
[2:16:39] is how is this uh promise that is over
[2:16:41] his head how is this going to play out
[2:16:44] all these questions may be in his head
[2:16:45] and here he comes to this place where
[2:16:47] he's left alone suddenly he's alone oh
[2:16:49] it's a good place and he and he finds
[2:16:51] that he is he's wrestling with this man
[2:16:55] you know God didn't like walk by in the
[2:16:57] cool of the evening and suddenly you
[2:16:58] know accidentally stumble over Jacob and
[2:17:00] and here they are in a tussle it's not
[2:17:02] no God descended he came down to meet
[2:17:05] with Jacob he came to wrestle with his
[2:17:09] creation he came to get a hold of you
[2:17:12] amen and in the in the form of light
[2:17:16] afflictions he puts his hands upon you
[2:17:18] and he starts to wrestle you and and
[2:17:21] suddenly you feel a little off Bal
[2:17:22] balance and and and something's
[2:17:24] happening and and then he's tugging this
[2:17:26] way and and you think you've got your
[2:17:27] job all figured out you've got you know
[2:17:29] your finances all all so well managed
[2:17:32] and just everything is so nice you know
[2:17:34] and then suddenly all that is just like
[2:17:35] you know it's just all out of cater and
[2:17:37] something's what is that God is
[2:17:39] wrestling with your life because he sees
[2:17:42] something in you he knows you better
[2:17:44] than you know yourself he's looking at
[2:17:45] the other side of the scale amen and so

[2:17:49] life he starts to take things away he
[2:17:51] starts to move you he starts to the
[2:17:54] eagle stirring his nest amen he's got
[2:17:56] his hands in there and you're just
[2:17:59] you're you don't know what's happening
[2:18:00] you're just you got a hold of something
[2:18:03] amen you got a hold of something but
[2:18:05] through the wrestling something starts
[2:18:07] to unveil there's something about this
[2:18:09] man that I am uh that I am wrestling
[2:18:13] with because it comes a time where it it
[2:18:16] it says that he touched the hollow of
[2:18:18] his thigh it didn't he didn't like you
[2:18:20] know he wasn't like in there and like
[2:18:22] ripped his you know thigh out of joint
[2:18:24] that's not what happened the Bible is
[2:18:25] saying he touched it so here he's
[2:18:28] wrestling with this this man and
[2:18:29] suddenly in the wrestling in this
[2:18:31] process amen of his life this everything
[2:18:34] coming to this point in this life he
[2:18:37] he's wrestling with God he doesn't
[2:18:39] realize fully what's happening but as
[2:18:41] this as this being as this person
[2:18:43] touches him he was a man touches him he
[2:18:48] everything changed and he realized
[2:18:50] something different about this
[2:18:53] man
[2:18:55] amen and he said let me go for the day
[2:18:58] breth and he said I will not let thee go
[2:19:02] except thou bless me this man that was
[2:19:06] destroying him this man that had the
[2:19:08] upper hand over Jacob Jacob held on for
[2:19:12] dear life and where we would have let go
[2:19:15] this trial is too great this pressure is
[2:19:18] too much there was something inside of
[2:19:20] Jacob amen there's a glory in Jacob
[2:19:23] there's something about Jacob he was not
[2:19:25] just Jacob the Shyer he was a prince
[2:19:27] with God but he doesn't know this yet
[2:19:30] but something inside of him there's
[2:19:31] there's something in in his life there's
[2:19:33] a glory in his life that is hanging on
[2:19:36] to God he is connected something keeps
[2:19:38] holding me and he's hanging on to this
[2:19:43] man I will not let you go unless you
[2:19:46] bless me verse 27 and he said unto him
[2:19:48] what is thy name
[2:19:51] what is thy name and he said Jacob and
[2:19:53] he said thy name shall be called No More
[2:19:55] Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast
[2:19:57] thou power with God and with men and has
[2:20:03] prevailed the
[2:20:05] balances right the the scales are
[2:20:08] balancing you are not Jacob the scales
[2:20:11] are balancing right it's coming
[2:20:14] up you are Israel
[2:20:21] you are
[2:20:22] Israel for as a prince has thou power
[2:20:26] with God this this is a huge
[2:20:29] statement we have we have met our
[2:20:34] equal is what he's saying Jacob you are
[2:20:37] not you're not really Jacob forget about
[2:20:40] Jacob you are
[2:20:42] Israel and I'm telling you you are equal
[2:20:46] with me you have power with me
[2:20:51] and what's he saying um he's saying you
[2:20:54] have a place with
[2:20:56] me you are equal you come from
[2:20:59] me you have power with God and with men
[2:21:03] and thou Hast
[2:21:05] prevailed amen you have overcome Jacob
[2:21:07] asked him and said tell me I pray thee
[2:21:09] thy name and he said wherefore it is
[2:21:11] that is it that thou Dost ask after my
[2:21:14] name and he bless him there Jacob called
[2:21:16] the name of the place panil for I have
[2:21:20] seen God face to
[2:21:23] face and my life is
[2:21:25] preserved now he makes that comment
[2:21:28] because he probably knew what Moses said
[2:21:30] that if you see God face to face you
[2:21:32] will die you will not live it's what the
[2:21:36] Bible says right you will not live but
[2:21:38] now a man comes and he wrestles with God
[2:21:41] he comes in contact with God he sees God
[2:21:43] face to face and he makes this
[2:21:45] declaration I have seen God face to face
[2:21:48] in other words though remember what did
[2:21:50] he say see he got a revelation of who he
[2:21:53] was that's what he saw when he looked at
[2:21:56] God's face when he came in contact with
[2:21:59] God he got a revelation of who he is in
[2:22:02] Christ that's where the scales balanced
[2:22:05] amen and he says and when he did this
[2:22:07] where he should have died or where he
[2:22:10] should not live anymore it's he's saying
[2:22:13] that my life is
[2:22:16] preserved and he passed over panil the
[2:22:18] sun rose upon him and he halted upon his
[2:22:20] thigh now he was not dead did God change
[2:22:24] his mind did did God you know change his
[2:22:26] rules what's going on here not dead but
[2:22:30] changed here's the key he was he did not
[2:22:34] die coming face to face with God he was
[2:22:38] changed he walked different he had a
[2:22:41] different name he was identified now as
[2:22:43] the prince having power with God Jacob
[2:22:47] in Ty here showing what will take place
[2:22:49] with Israel the s of Jo Joseph fear
[2:22:52] feared greatly when Joseph revealed
[2:22:54] himself to them face to
[2:22:56] face but there was a revelation and when
[2:22:59] they should have died amen you see how
[2:23:02] this now this pattern plays out over and
[2:23:04] over now where they should have died
[2:23:06] when they came face to face with
[2:23:08] Joseph their lives were
[2:23:12] preserved whereas he had met God himself
[2:23:15] and wrestled with him in the form of a
[2:23:17] man and yet he was preserved he could
[2:23:19] meet his brothers now with no fear of
[2:23:22] being hurt because he knew who he was in
[2:23:24] Christ something had changed about Jacob
[2:23:27] something was different how can you meet
[2:23:28] God like that and not be the
[2:23:31] same how can you meet the supernatural
[2:23:34] Eternal God and not be
[2:23:36] changed how can you come face to face
[2:23:38] with God how can you see God in his
[2:23:41] glory in other words how can you receive
[2:23:43] the revelation of who you are in Christ
[2:23:46] and not live differently
[2:23:53] I'm going to skip some of this here it's
[2:23:55] it's about Revelations
[2:23:56] 1:10 where they see him one likee unto
[2:23:59] the son of man and when he saw him he
[2:24:00] fell on his feet as dead but remember he
[2:24:02] was there in the midst of the gold
[2:24:04] golden candlesticks he is there in the
[2:24:07] church in the pmos vision he says no
[2:24:09] human being could stand the full effect
[2:24:11] of that Vision he's talking about coming
[2:24:13] into the presence of God right remember
[2:24:16] Jacob came into the presence of God and
[2:24:18] he did not die he was changed so that
[2:24:21] word not live does not mean that you
[2:24:24] will die it means that you will not live
[2:24:26] the same way that you have been
[2:24:29] living now the patmas vision when you
[2:24:32] come into this Vision when you come the
[2:24:34] prophet saying when a human comes to the
[2:24:36] full effect of coming face to face with
[2:24:39] your the revelation of Christ in you you
[2:24:41] and Christ no man could stand the full
[2:24:44] effect of that Vision he even tells the
[2:24:45] story of how when when he saw that that
[2:24:47] one right and he saw him from the side
[2:24:50] like that he could see a man and he says
[2:24:52] he he when he turned he passed out
[2:24:55] right his strength he says will be
[2:24:58] utterly Gone John fell at his feet as
[2:25:00] though dead but the hand of the Lord in
[2:25:03] love touched him and the voice of
[2:25:06] blessing said fear not Don't Be Afraid
[2:25:09] John I am the first and the last I am he
[2:25:11] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[2:25:14] alive forever more what is there to fear
[2:25:16] the Judgment that fell upon him at the
[2:25:18] cross at the grave and when he descended
[2:25:20] was for us he absorbed the full brunt of
[2:25:24] the wound of sin and there is therefore
[2:25:26] now no condemnation to them which are in
[2:25:28] Christ Jesus see for aurity our eternity
[2:25:32] our attorney our judge is our judge our
[2:25:37] attorney is our judge he is both
[2:25:38] attorney and judge as judge the case is
[2:25:41] settled it is finished there is
[2:25:43] therefore now no condemnation why should
[2:25:45] the church fear what promise has he ever
[2:25:48] failed to manifest before us
[2:25:51] why should it fear why should it fear
[2:25:55] punishment or death it has all been
[2:25:57] overcome here is the mighty conqueror
[2:26:00] here is the one who conquered Both
[2:26:02] Worlds of unseen and
[2:26:05] seen not like Alexander who conquered
[2:26:08] the world at the age of 33 and knew no
[2:26:10] other way to turn for further Conquest
[2:26:13] so he died a victim of sin and righteous
[2:26:16] living not like Napoleon who conquered
[2:26:18] all of Europe but finally Was Defeated
[2:26:20] at waterl and banished to Elba only to
[2:26:22] find himself conquered but nothing could
[2:26:25] conquer this one Christ he that
[2:26:29] descended has now ascended above all and
[2:26:32] unto him has been given a name that is
[2:26:34] above every name yes he conquered death
[2:26:37] hell and the grave and has the keys
[2:26:39] thereof what he loses is loosed and what
[2:26:43] he binds is bound there is no changing
[2:26:47] of it there is no conqueror before him
[2:26:49] and there there is none beside him he
[2:26:51] alone is the savior the Redeemer he is
[2:26:55] the only God and his name is Lord Jesus
[2:27:00] Christ so he says Don't Fear
[2:27:03] John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I
[2:27:06] am you are air too remember we are
[2:27:10] coming face to face with our maker today
[2:27:13] all that I am you are air too all my
[2:27:17] power is yours
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:23] thank you
[2:27:24] Lord the scales are balancing
[2:27:28] today all my power is yours my
[2:27:32] omnipotence is yours as I stand in your
[2:27:35] midst I have not come to bring fear and
[2:27:39] failure but love and courage and
[2:27:44] ability all power is given unto me and
[2:27:47] it is yours to use you speak the word
[2:27:51] and I will perform it that is my
[2:27:53] Covenant and it can never
[2:27:59] fail I should try and close here
[2:28:06] somewh oh
[2:28:08] boy let's just close
[2:28:10] here so let's get back to
[2:28:13] Moses musicians can come Exodus 33 and
[2:28:17] 21 and the Lord said behold
[2:28:20] there is a place by
[2:28:22] me talking to Moses he just said no one
[2:28:25] can see my face and live and in this
[2:28:28] instance though in verse 21 the Lord
[2:28:30] saying now to Moses behold there is a
[2:28:33] place by
[2:28:35] me that's
[2:28:37] sacred can you can you hear the Lord
[2:28:39] saying that to you today there's a place
[2:28:41] by me in other words there's a there's a
[2:28:44] position there's a there's a a place
[2:28:47] that only you can fill there is a place
[2:28:49] by me
[2:28:50] and thou shalt stand upon a
[2:28:53] rock rock of
[2:28:55] Revelation there is a place the place
[2:28:59] that we are standing in today is a
[2:29:01] revelation of Jesus Christ in us that's
[2:29:04] the rock we stand on that is our place
[2:29:06] when we say Lord I want to see your
[2:29:09] glory show me thy Glory he's saying
[2:29:12] there is a place for you here next to me
[2:29:15] we're going to walk hand in hand through
[2:29:17] this Revelation and it's upon a rock
[2:29:21] and it shall come to pass while my Glory
[2:29:23] passeth by that I will put thee in a
[2:29:26] cliff of the rock I will put you in the
[2:29:29] Revelation I will hide you in the Cliffs
[2:29:33] of The
[2:29:35] Rock and I will cover thee with my
[2:29:38] hand while I pass
[2:29:41] by and I will take away mine hand and
[2:29:44] thou shalt see the my back Parts but my
[2:29:47] face shall not be seen
[2:29:51] oh
[2:29:53] my you might say we don't want to leave
[2:29:57] Moses just seeing the back parts of a
[2:29:59] man his journey
[2:30:02] continues Journey continues I'm going to
[2:30:04] just skip through things here there's a
[2:30:07] place where if I can find
[2:30:10] it there's a place where he literally
[2:30:13] comes face to face with the
[2:30:18] Lord It's it's called the tent of
[2:30:21] meeting this is the this is
[2:30:24] the like a title in my in my Bible it
[2:30:28] says the tent of meeting you know we
[2:30:31] have The Shining face of Moses because
[2:30:33] he was in the presence of the Lord and
[2:30:35] and and the people could not look upon
[2:30:37] him because he had been with the
[2:30:39] Lord he was God to the people and Aaron
[2:30:41] was his Prophet I mean he had come to
[2:30:44] such a place of communion of connection
[2:30:47] the scales were were perfectly balancing
[2:30:50] and it says here in Exodus 33:7 it says
[2:30:53] and Moses took the Tabernacle and
[2:30:54] pitched it without the camp far off from
[2:30:57] the camp there was a a place away from
[2:31:00] everything the tent of meeting and he
[2:31:04] called it the Tabernacle of the
[2:31:05] congregation and it came to pass that
[2:31:08] everyone which sought the Lord went unto
[2:31:12] the Tabernacle of the
[2:31:14] congregation that was without the
[2:31:17] camp and it came to pass when Moses went
[2:31:19] out out unto the Tabernacle that all the
[2:31:22] people rose up and stood every man at
[2:31:24] his tent door and he looked after Moses
[2:31:28] until he was gone into the Tabernacle
[2:31:30] and it came to pass as Moses entered
[2:31:32] into the C
[2:31:34] Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended
[2:31:39] and stood at the door of the Tabernacle
[2:31:42] and the Lord talked with
[2:31:47] Moses and all the people saw the cloudy
[2:31:50] pillar standing at the Tabernacle door
[2:31:53] and all the people rose up and worshiped
[2:31:55] every man in his tent door and the Lord
[2:31:58] spake unto Moses face to
[2:32:05] face as a man speaketh unto his
[2:32:08] friend as a man speaketh unto his friend
[2:32:13] he was not an enemy with God he was not
[2:32:15] working against God he was talking face
[2:32:18] to face we are friends
[2:32:20] you know you are a friend of
[2:32:24] God as a man would speak unto his friend
[2:32:27] and he turned again into the camp but
[2:32:30] his servant Joshua the son of nun a
[2:32:31] young man departed not out of the
[2:32:34] Tabernacle so so
[2:32:36] beautiful I'll close with this brother
[2:32:38] Ben if you'll
[2:32:40] come no man can see my face and live do
[2:32:44] we understand what this means

[2:32:49] the same again you can never go back to
[2:32:51] your old life again this is what it
[2:32:55] means to be face to face with God God
