made a great effort for us to come here to hear your word father to hear you speak to our hearts may you come father God in the power of your Resurrection move me out of the way father and speak to your people my father my God may your Holy Spirit come tonight Lord and anoint every heart and anoint every desire that when we leave this place my father my God we will be changed people when we

Christ I pray amen amen God bless you God bless you I greet you all tonight in the name of our loving Lord Jesus Christ amen can we say Amen amen means let it be so when I say can I I greet you all tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ my expectation is that amen thank you brother David thank you for the songs and the musicians thanks all of you thank you each one amen so we while we're standing we're going to read the scripture but I just thought as I'm sitting there I just failed to tell you that each one of you is very special each one of you is very special before God each one of you is unique and God tonight has brought an unworthy human being maybe like myself insignificant just to come and deliver for you something that can maybe change your life for good so that's the whole purpose why we are here tonight that God can deliver unto us something even if it's so small because nothing is smaller when he's in God's hands amen so I'll be standing let's read the scripture but I just wanted you to know that you are very special to God each one of you is very unique and very special and don't underestimate or underage yourself that ah me I'm just by the way no you are very special before God and you will see why as we go along let's read the scripture before we sit down and we will read Joel chapter 1. from verse 1 I mean Joel chapter 2 sorry once we get there please just say amen Joel chapter 2. 124 amen are you there the Bible says blowy the trumpet of Zion and sound and alarm in my Holy Mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord cometh for it is nigh at hand verse two a day of darkness and glooming gloominess a day of clouds and of thick Darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong and a strong there hath not been ever the like neither shall be any more after it I wonder if anyone can start to see themselves in this scripture even to The Heirs of many generations there will be no other people like those ones a fire developed before them and behind them a flame Bennett a land the land is at the Garden of Eden before them and behind them a desolate Wilderness yay and nothing shall Escape oh wow Hallelujah Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for your word that we have read amen I know that I'm not able to deliver or even to speak or qualified before these people but you father God you are the god of Heavens you can take even a stone father and preach your gospel father God I pray today that you can move me out of the way Lord as we come here to dine on the table may you anoint the speaker and the hearer anoint every heart father as we think of what we have done as we think of what you have planned for us as we think oh God and we we really father God take into our hearts what what you have gone through for us to be here today we thank you for Calvary we thank you for your sacrifice we thank you for your predestination your foreknowledge for us for choosing us father out of so many people out there who might have been chosen but you chose me even as the song says father we want to bless your name we love you and we appreciate you father Lord may you just help me Father God move me out of the way Lord Lord let not my weaknesses hinder these people let not father God anything that I think I can do be an obstacle to me and to the brothers and sisters we

praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you during that restoration amen with you and and my people shall never be ashamed Hallelujah man today I want us to talk about a simple subject it's not so simple but it's a it's a it's a teaching subject really it cannot be accommodated in this one a service even in prayer meeting it can't he said brother Brandon priesthood I think in two hours this this sermon if I'm not mistaken so we're just going to take the key points or whatever the Lord is leading us to deliver and to to enjoy and to remind each other to motivate and to refresh each other in our hands what we God has in store for you amen do you believe God can change your life tonight amen amen I believe that so let's talk about God's law of restoration God's law of restoration it's been on my heart this subject and I was talking to I was talking together the other time I said man this is moving me because I was thinking about restoration and about Harvest and I I was trying to bring the two subjects together and I realized that you know actually harvest the Harvest what we Harvest is the actual true restoration amen who how many know a harvest do you understand what harvest mean you know Harvest is when we have planted a seed and it has now come to its maturity it has now come to what it was before yeah but that's not our subject today we just want to talk about God 's law of restoration let's let's just read this before we move forward quickly Genesis 20 7-8 this is the story about Abraham when God was telling the king abimele is it abimelech to restore the wife of Abraham the subject of restoration is so powerful and God said now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt leave and thou and and if thou restore her not know that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine he's asking he's telling this King to go to the prophet and restore restore because he took the wife and this King did not know yeah yeah so the issue here is that what the enemy that we are going to talk about him he knew what he was doing yeah he deceitfully took what didn't belong to him unless King abimelech King abimelech the prophet lies to him but he still had to restore or else die can you see the seriousness of restoration yes therefore amimela grows up early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their eyes in their ears and the men the men were so afraid now for God has a law in his weight the law of God is his word amen look at it this way how can I start this subject just pray for me as we go along amen so I wanted to talk about a subject of being sensitive to the spirit I wanted to talk about it that's the sermon I Was preparing and all of a sudden I don't know what happened I stopped preparing that one yeah that then I came to this subject that was so strong on my heart but I found as I went along that they are actually connected that they are linked but the law of God is actually built in inside his weight God himself his weight is the law and many many times when we think about the law we think about you know and something you know that is going to be pushing you that is going to be that is going to be you you're going to be uncomfortably do whether you like it or not but but there's many different kind of laws are we are we together there is different kind of laws but I want us to go slowly and a little bit and understand the the subject of the law and then you'll be able to see what is this law of restoration because God said I will restore think about the Garden of Eden in the Garden of Eden not the Garden of Eden think about Noah when he was about to take all the animals into the ark what happened there what what happened to those animals that were afraid to human beings that were running around and everything but all of a sudden they started to come together enemies of animals I see a chimpanzee I see a lion I see a Mamba I see I don't know if your mama did your mama go in I see all sorts of animals which are even enemies moving into the ark what kind of atmosphere was there yeah for the animals to move into the ark because it right now we are in that atmosphere where we are moving into Christ and we are being restored to an idiotic condition yes things that are not that are not normal are happening come on things that are actually under according to the flesh not normal yeah they're happening right now people just gather every Wednesday every Sunday they are listening to one person shouting or speaking in front of them is that normal according to the flesh is not people just come and then they say they start to sing things that are happening you know are happening that are not normal yeah yeah and that's abnormal it is because the law of restoration is taking place as we speak God is busy restoring because he said in the Garden of Eden I'm going to restore listen now for God has a law and his weight is law I I just enjoyed putting that one in bold and everything is surrounded by some kind of law think about it the plans think about the plants when a plant grows you plant a seed of a pumpkin it cannot help it but as long as it gets under the right atmosphere yeah yeah and it starts to grow it is because of the law that God has put in the seed the law of life and the law of growing and the law of germinating and it Bears fruits and those fruits they become and have seeds that is similar to the one that was planted because it is the law of God that he has put now Allah is something very striking there is a law there is a law of of gravity yes yes there is a lot of physics there is a law of human you know a human body how it grows there's a certain pattern and law that God prescribed if now you just you know you know something just happened my body knows how to respond because of the law of God they see just keep giving waves and giving ways all we know we don't know from when because God has set up a law in his word so it has to follow that pattern of the law of God Amen so now now if we if we read carefully and we're going to jump there now if we we just try to understand what is what is this restore what is the meaning of the word restore now men of God says that to restore it means to return to the former owner or to bring back to the former estate of condition and we can enforce a claim to be restored so so when when you take something back to the original owner but it's not a copy no no you take something that belongs to Sister Rebecca that you Stone and now you are giving it back to her in its condition it is being restored to his original owner so you and me are actually at the moment in that process where we are going back to where we used to be yeah we are being restored at the Garden because at the Garden of Eden things were messed up Adam took up everything and sort of tried to destroy the plan of God how God wanted things to be but God said okay go be in the world but I am going to restore and that's where we are going right now so this thing of restoration listen to the man of God there he says now that's what the Webster says the way to restore means to bring back to the Homer owner to bring back to a former State condition to restore means to bring back is to restore a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to his rightful owner where it belongs therefore some way therefore some way it went away rightful owner can wander around anyway but to restore is to bring back in to it who really owns it your eternal life has been somehow deceitfully robbed almost taken away from us God said never I cannot allow this I have a plan of restoration and there is a law in the word of God that whatever God says must happen that is another law there's no way in which God's word cannot be fulfilled so listen to this and in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there is a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore I just I just don't know how to explain it but the law is like this there is a law of Life yeah how life comes how Life Starts there is a law you know of Grace who who knows the law of Grace so there is a law of love love there's love built inside the lamb there is there is a lot of redemption yes you know there is a law of anything you can think of yes even here on Earth they are trying to replicate the law but they can't it's not Eternal that law you that's why when you you do you what do you do you do something against the law you get punished you do this and this because that law is not perfect but the law of God for example the law of love how does the law of love work the law of love was in such a way that we will say is abnormal how can you love someone who don't love you yeah come on the true love of God you love you forgive someone unconditionally even before they ask you you forgive them that that's the law of love the true love of God so there is build lock the beds when they fly there is a law built in the bed that makes it to be able to fly me and you you can try but you just fall down but there is a law built inside a bed to fly a fish has got a law built in it to be able to swim yeah hallelujah how many believe this yeah yeah now now let's let's look at the law now let's say we have the law and then that law is not being implemented it's not taking place oh no one obeys it no one applies it nothing happens what is the use of that law right why do we have the law of Grace when no one is going to make sure that I have Grace what is the use of a law a speed limit here on this road if everybody is going to drive the way they want this is the use a law is there to be implemented to be enforced when I'm saying enforce don't think of violent right no no I you can force something using love yeah I are you are you are you following me the Believers okay let's let's read this let's read the next slide we'll be together by end of the end of the night amen enforcement of the law the law will be of no benefit if and use of it if it's not applied and enforced that's my statement there there will be no no results no fruits Satan will get away with anything he wants because he is the first one to disobey God Satan is not just going to obey the law of God he's not something has to enforce him do you think all these people all of them are a law abiding citizens there must be a policeman to enforce their law and if the policeman cannot see an offender somebody has to report otherwise you are colluding with the criminal if you see someone doing crime you do what you report if you don't report it can be interpreted as a collusion why don't you report it yeah because you see something someone is doing something is harming somebody you just go and live it ah you are afraid of the criminal or are you I you don't have the trust and the confidence in the law those things do exist but let's bring it to the spiritual part who is our enforcer we've got a policeman called the Holy Spirit and we must inform him oh yes to and to be he's the only one who's going to put Satan inside the cell and put the what do you call those things handcuffs and enforce the law of God unfaited yes he's the only one now I don't hear that and sometimes people don't report wrong things to the police for some other reasons some people maybe they didn't know some people may be they were ignorant some people maybe they they is their friend so so there's many many reasons why people don't report but hey you can also not report because you're actually supporting do we want to be found on the side where we are supporting Satan that means we are supposed to be reporting him on a daily basis otherwise look you are a Believer whether you like it or not you have been chosen by God ah it's not up to you God chose you and God found you when you did not look for him now therefore you you are stuck with Jesus and therefore you have everything that God said you have to apply it according to him otherwise if he turns out that you are not it simply just proves the opposite that maybe you are not his after all otherwise why should God's word fail God's word will never fail and if I am going to be a an object that is going to make God's word not able to be fulfilled ah there could be a suggestion there maybe this one is not the son of God so every Son of God has to go according to the law of God and there are laws that are rigid that you know like thou shall not and as I'm lost that you know this the law of the spirit of God that guides you the law that will teach you every step of the way the law of love the law of forgiveness all those things that built inside God's word which is the ultimate law amen so we cannot be found colluding with this Criminal you know the criminal and our crime can be not to report him how many understand the meaning of the word iniquity yeah amen I don't if you find that I'm too hot maybe just forgive me and don't take it up with me take it up with the Lord because it's not me I I'm just trying to to transfer or to give you what what the lord gave me but if you may find that maybe that something is too hard to swallow don't take it up with me me I'm just your brother yeah I'm just your brother take it up with the Lord just like if you get blessed you're going to go to the Lord and thank him isn't it and praise him and say father I thank you I appreciate you father so if something comes and you don't like it take it up with him not me what can I do like it's just only going to allow that criminal to cause a frackers between me and you I'm a ninja you prayed when you came to church did you did you pray for the minister and you say Lord come and speak to me tonight so if anything comes here and you go away home and you're not blessed whose fault is it mine or yours I don't mean to be that way but what I'm trying to say is the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord surely you must pick up something from what we read here from what we prayed for what we've left everything and came here to church something home that will who can remember forget about forget about the neighbor I wanted to tell you at the beginning of the service that okay I wish I had a button you know where I can press and reset you all of you and just reset you clear away forget about the day and what happened everything I just I just wanted to press that button just to clear everything that happened during the day and we reset and start and then from there I give you the cubicles each one in their cubicles so that it says you and the Lord so that when you say Amen is that you and the Lord they are not looking at who's next door who is saying what who is thinking what and what have you you've just been reseted clear oh my clean Road I'm starting a new page that's the service that's attitude we come to church to come and hear God on a clear heart and a clear mind and say speak to me my Lord so let's hear the next slide we said the officer is the holy spirit right tonight I'm trying to just teach or just go slowly not be jumping around the officer was going to going to take the fellow that stole your property was going to take him court and you keep pulling him back well I don't know just whether you should do this or not he will never get him there just let him go what the prophet is saying here is that do not hinder the Holy Spirit from dealing with the Devil right tell the Holy Spirit you know that song that says I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus you know it you don't know I'll teach you after this yes so take Jesus everything go to him talk to them and force them you cannot do anything yourself there is a person specifically appointed oh yes to deal with the Enemy you are not supposed to deal with the Enemy whether that enemy comes in whatever form of shape whether through your brother you see him and you see ah no no don't deal with it give it to the agent there's a police officer talk to him give it to him then you'll see how he's going to handle yeah that's what the man of God is trying to say here he says that that way you do let's let Satan just get away all the doubts and everything flee from mind then God will raise up you raise you up good he will restore everything that death killed that's right now the only way it can never remain dead let it lay in the wrong place so this is the problem the only way in which we are not going to be able to be restored is if we don't get into the right place staying in the weight staying remaining in the world remaining in the spirit at all times that's the thing that is going to make us to be fully restored by remaining in the spirit of the Lord at all times are you hearing me Believers that's the only thing that the moment we get out of our position and we find ourselves colluding with the Devil colluding with Satan by not reporting I like what brother and he said the ultimatum that he gave the devil I thought you when he said you know you know devil and I went and watched that testimony again he said he said you know I said Satan you know if you if you bring this thing again I thought my I wonder what the end he's going to say oh boy I thought he was going to say I'm gonna kick you say I'm gonna I'm gonna pray to everyone I said wow how many of you said wow is it the law of God is we don't fight the way the world fights amen When you pray actually you are bombing the compound of Satan when you bring the word of God to Satan you're actually blasting him off it's not just a prayer when you pray when you think where good thoughts about your brother you're blasting the devil yes when you do things that the devil don't want you to do that are in line with the you are actually destroying that because you are giving them no grip you are not giving the enemy anything to hold on the moment you find it physically you are not allowing the Holy Spirit allow the spirit yes to deal with Satan you just get in line I said oh this brother is going to say devil if you're going to do this again and I feel this Spirit coming you know what I'm gonna do David I said my I wonder what he said I'm gonna start from the from the up north and I'll finish I said ah this is how I fight my battle yes this is how I fight my battle so that is how we fight our battles yes what the brother mentioned here was that he was saying okay now I'm going to to take you personally to the police men who is going to deal with you and brother Brandon I remember when he was praying for the people just praying the player will cast The Devils until he will see and he will feel and he will see some of them in the shape of a tortoise or a bed yeah yeah getting excited and overwhelmed just from him praying just praying praying a faithful prayer it was burning the devil it was hitting them it was blasting them yeah it was bombing them and they were calling each other to come and help each other it's just the man of God I pray just your simple prayer of faith amen amen just your simple blessing of your sister and your brother right right huh help us Lord enforce then we are the the we we have a privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God gave us right for what does he say there for God has a law and his law his word is a law and a God is in God in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have the right to force the claims upon Satan yes that's right to say give it back come on and he has to do it yes because that is God's word and the God said it you didn't say it sister number did you I didn't say it's God God said it and then it's like the law the policeman comes to you and say hey brother you are speeding this is your speed limit you can't tell him that no no no no no no no no he's got the law he said hey I have got the law he says if you are driving this pit in this road I'm supposed to arrest you or give you a ticket I want to enforce the law on you I can see you're a doctor I can see you are in a pastor I can see you are an up man I can see you are rushing I understand but there is a law right right I'm I've been forcing the law on you right give me your lessons he's enforcing the law he can be a young man and maybe you're an elder you say this boy is disrespectful no he's not disrespectful he is enforcing the law and that's what me and you we may be a small little boy to the devil but we've got the law of God which is his way and we must enforce it yes yes preach it listen to this we use a different type of a law you cannot apply and enforce God's law without the spirit of God so because we We Are Spiritual Beings we apply the with the spirit of God is the one that is leading us apply this law in other words I'm not going to come to you remember Paul said hey be careful the letter killeth you know the letter I can say oh no brother okay can I use the example brother Ben the pastor was here telling us about the church order how many beliefs in church order Church order and then just order it means that we must respect the sanctuary the spirit being holy spirit is here now he does not mean that you must it's not it's not just a letter that we must not talk yet no no is understanding the spiritual part that there is a presence of God in the sanctuary this place we dedicated it to serve God therefore if someone some people got delivered even after service that's why we must come here 30 minutes before and praying when we leave we live respectfully not is nothing to do with the building it's nothing to do with the chairs it's the sanctuary of God there is a certain order that the spirit wants yeah but we are so guilty me included amen and we forget like the children of Israel did they forgot and they were reminded with a spanking we don't want the spanking of God so we want to understand the physical and the spiritual implication of our actions of our thoughts and our doings because he said somewhere the holy spirit is so sensitive yeah but even a little child running here he can just move when the atmosphere is right he comes back so we have to understand that but the key is this we must do it physically and it's not a physical job I don't know how to explain it better I'll leave it to Brother Bear but I thought I can give that example it don't it's not just we we must respect the presence of the Living God when we come in the church when you come in the century it's more about the house of God this is the house of God the people of God the presence of God everything about him if we do that the spirit of God will come down and he will enforce the promises that God has given to us and who will see things that we never expected to see here because we are simply aligning yeah just by simply a woman listening to the husband or by simply you listening to Jesus Christ here can make miracles just came in the house and the children were crying and everything was out of order he didn't say hey what is this this this this this this no no he starts talking apron and started to wash the dishes mm-hmm and that changed the atmosphere because he brought the atmos he he used the right channel to enforce false I don't know how to say it sister Naomi the Lord help me am I saying it right thank you so the law of the land is to enforce if someone takes your property you go to court they enforce and you get it back that's the law right but the law of God the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan I want to reiterate this point Satan must be enforced amen to give up that which here he unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of man he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he plays upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and and force upon him Satan that's what we must do yes and we must believe and enforce it oh yes the way he said it sorry now one day we've got an event in this family in this church right we've got a family of the events they are not here now you know their car was stolen remember and that brings me to another family of the events also during Brothers time it was also the events family their car was stolen as well the evidence family here their cow was also stolen a few years ago remember so the Indian family they share the car was stolen and at the same go today and forever yeah yeah he did what he did during Brothers time and the events family here their cow was restored is it when you when you enforce God's law he restores yeah so brother here was just telling about the story about you know how the thieves stole the car of this man and and then the clothes and everything were in there and this man drove so long to come to church the clothes for his wife and the children are in the car and the prophet prayed and the brothers five of them knelt and prayed that's the thing now another more circumstances or let me say under this abnormal circumstances we're supposed to go to the police and chase them and find them and put the car insurance in the car and the tracker and everything and when we find those thieves we must hit them right and I ask them the men of God prayed in state that's how the law Works in our family we the lowest it was not the police who found the car no no that the Holy Spirit he the real police convicted that man amen and that man had to come back and pack the car there yeah the police of this world did not arrest him right I didn't hear any report he left he why didn't the Holy Spirit make them to arrest him no that's not how we work right our police officer restores and that's all who can who can tell what that meant what went on in his life what what happened you you spend so much time and I put petal and steal a car and go all of a sudden you want to come back I don't see many of them brothers [Music] I don't see many of those incidences I can see him he's swearing like this like this like this like this and he's turning back five brothers including the prophet they nailed and they pray and the prophet said I I enforced the law of God I enforced it and the death you have to come to a point where you want to do it otherwise imagine the police officer does not want to do his job oh yeah let's talk about the law of love now this is another unusual one to the flesh to say that I must love my enemy oh yeah and not only that I must love my enemy the way I love myself or my neighbor sorry amen even my enemy yeah that person that if if given an opportunity can just poison you and kill you that one is the one you must give a class of what and love you yeah that's not according to the law of the flesh that is very an unrealistic unusual right so the Bible says that you know I said that in the title The Law of love I know it comes from the Ten Commandments but you know it is actually the true love of my neighbor is not even based on thou shall do it no it's the spirit of God moving in me that I love my brother my sister and my neighbor and I love them the way I love myself that is deep to love someone the way you love yourself if you pause and think about it unless you don't love yourself enough but the way you love yourself you must love the next person isn't it and I think it's awesome to be able to be challenged by the spirit of God to love forget about us here as as we don't even ask you you must love us the neighbor who is an unbeliever right me I don't even think of myself I'll just pray for you if I see a bit of a little bit of a lovely but me I must love you whether I like it or not it's very important I loved you and I chose you and I took you from a childish stupid sinful world I was very naughty one day I'll tell you and he pulled me I know don't Glory so who am I to pick and choose God's children amen amen hey I cannot give this one a present like this and then tomorrow's ah sister Maggie oh sorry I just give it a small little present yeah huh based on what I must love them I must be adding more more what we call it those those of love for all of them equally I must do that that's the law of love so a neighbor must see that love someone driving with me on the road must fill my love driving there amen he mustn't feel attention that ah this guy was just stopping and just kicking and swearing me at me because there's a road rage or or you know the spirit is here on this on the on the road you know that yeah so oh yeah and and people you can almost feel those those Spirits yes you can you can see you can if you are sensitive to the spiritual Spirits you can sense yeah on the road yes yes you must be able to that at the same time people must be able to sense that's not the usual driver that one huh may God help us me included now we have the law of life in US it's given to us we don't only thing you have to do you are made and born and placed here in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to knock down the devil we've got the law but that's the law of the Holy Spirit the law the only thing you know have to do is to know how you let go and let God that's what I was trying to say earlier to be in the right position to to stand right make sure you're standing right one day my house bent and a brother calls me from Over the borders and he says to me brother I'm sorry about your house and and he says so many things and then what he what stood for me he said to me brother I wanna ask you something you know stand before the Lord stand you are sure everything is fine you check your life and everything I say yes my brother he said stand amen and watch God amen so to stand to stand before God is to say God I've everything I can do but here I stand all right before you yeah my heart my life my family my everything is open before you you know it Lord stand and see the hand of the Lord amen that's what the prophet says if we just stand and know how to let go it's not easy to let go nowadays yeah but there is a man who's called an agent of God he can remove things that are difficult for you he can enforce Satan he can he's the only one who is able to erase memory yeah he's the only one who is able to remove head and bitterness yeah time a root of bitterness arises among people you find that it's because we opened up again yeah it's true and the root of bitterness come so we must be able to see it in a sense sense it our love must be so strong that an unbeliever must want to want to be with us Hallelujah That's the Law of the Holy Spirit the only thing you can you know he have to do is to know how to let go and let God you keep fighting at it see and I want never work when you let go and let go that's all see that's all I want to read for you again this part here the Locust has done as has done it the locals has done it all off the Locust has done eat eat all of it it's not me I'm reading there can you see that sure the leaves off of it now that's just might as well set out there in the Sun so you are your end there ain't no cooling there all right now so there but you know what we are supposed to do the Bible said the predestinated church they predestinated the sons in God what do they do set it in Heavenly places what is it coolness Comfort feeling at home let God just stand and let God do it for you don't say God has already plans and everything in place amen all you need to do tell him the police officer does not need your help he's been trained he's been authorized by the law all he wants you to do is to go and say office that man has knocked my car and he has done this and this and this and this right and I would like the law to take place a recourse of the law against that man yeah and the police officer goes and he applies the room what do you do nothing you just go to court and the judge gives a a verdict and say this man is guilty must pay this man sorry I'm sorry according to this law and law and law and law and law as we did in case number what what right you you there's nothing much you do there not even your legal fees in our kingdom even your legal fees are paid even your lawyer you you someone owes you on the physical side someone sees you no no take them to the right person all right man yep amen I know of situations where I did I tell you brother Andy or someone a brother who has owed money in his business and they brought the prayer request to church and on a Thursday morning the guy phoned you and he said hey I I want to transfer the money now and he paid him all his money that he owed him for months and the brother's business was going to fall and he paid him wow he uses the right law debt collectors what would happen it was going to cost him more yeah but he took him to that to the higher lawyer the real true agent when we have problems situations and things let's take them to the right lawyer the right agent he's the one yeah yes and wait there and just stand before God and see stay on that word that was that's what we got to do brother stay there now we are getting now on the last days and we know that the hour is here the hour is here right now so we need to be able to come to a point where we allow the spirit of God to do his job yeah amen but now we've got a job to do what is our job to stay in his presence one to tell him we need to convey the matters to him yeah and report and tell him what we want amen we are the only ones who can say Lord and like brother Arman says you know when he was praying I hope I'm allowed to say to brother he said you know when he prayed when they they left there in Belmont and they went to that he prayed specifically for God to give them a house like this like this like this that's what Holy Spirit work the Holy Spirit does not want us to be vague be clear I want a job like this I want this salary and I want it in Willington and Lord I want also a car like this like this and I need my sister the one who left to to be restored I wonder how to be convicted amen and Lord I wanted to come to the altar in tears Lord my mother and the Lord wants you to be specific yes yes don't be vague with the Lord God specifically and then the officer will take them all down all right go before the father and say father this is your daughter this is your son he is living right and this is the situation then the Great Master Jehovah and enforce the law all right Milo of restoration forgive him don't tell me about her qualifications don't tell me about her experience don't tell me about her her weaknesses give my daughter according to my weight otherwise the unbelievers will appear to be above us last scripture for you then we pray Romans chapter 8. there is therefore no more no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus you know the scripture who walk not after the flesh but after that and that's the gist of what I wonder I want us to I just want to keep it with this scripture yeah now there's no condemnation to them now that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit it means everything that we do in our lives at all costs we must try to see the spiritual side of it are we together yes because if if you're going to apply things as a Believer and you apply things all the time physically you the flesh is very limited make sure you consult your Mentor who is also an officer who is also your guide who is also your everything concerned apply even the things that don't some people will say oh how can I just be Consulting God for no no consult God in everything when there is a thought when there is a situation when there's everything everything I mean take you to the officer for the law of the spirit in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death the law of sin and death is the law of this world for for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and foreseen condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in US who walk not after the flesh Paul is emphasizing this point we cannot walk on the Flesh and also walk on the spirit we can't we cannot be able to be both sides that's right that's right as a Believer I would say we are on this world we are doing whatever we are doing but we are actually more Spiritual Beings yes every day in every aspect of our life is supposedly supposed to be okay I'll read verse 7. either six for to be carnally minded is death to be kindly minded is death Yes somewhere it says enemity to God to be kindly minded in other words to always think put things and do them things in a carnal way in a flesh way is enmity to God but to be spiritually minded is life and peace that is why he said Lord forgive them for they don't know what they're doing how can you do that and then under according to the law of sin and death you can't yeah yeah because the canal mind is enmity against God yes that's what I was trying to say for it is not it is not subject to the law of God amen so I just wanted to encourage you brothers and sisters that God has is restoring amen he promised to restore if I didn't go fully in that message of the restoration forgive me bear with me but I needed just to emphasize on this aspect of enforcing the law of God for restoration for restoration of your gifts restoration of your healing restoration of anything that you want the Lord knew what he was talking about when he said if you ask anything yeah yeah he knew yeah he knew that there will be a cell phone in this day he knew that there's going to be anything and he said it clearly you cannot suffer and struggle as a child of God right no no take it to the Lord because you are not you are above the law of sin and flesh may the Lord bless you tonight may the Lord grant you these few ways that I've mentioned here that I've said and if the Lord may he be the after speaker maybe the one that will go with you and and fine tune what I wanted to convey to you that very Holy Spirit we are talking about may he be the one amen amen so let us all take put the shoulder on the wheel and say Lord my job is not much my job is to give it to the officer there is an agent appointed for that leave it there and be comfortable be at peace when things go wrong he will make them right Hallelujah you know the song so let's pause here and be prayerful and I made a little note there I said the demonstration and manifestation of the fruits of restoration shows that you are obedient to God's law of restoration is a powerful code that I ever made the demonstration and manifestation of the fruits of restoration shows that you or we are obedient to God's law of restoration so may God help us let us not be carnal let us move away for to be carnally minded is enemity to God so we we are not God's enemy but sometimes the devil wants to bring these little things that he wants to to keep us delayed let's be sensitive to that we are about to go home very soon amen what's the song that I said I wanted to teach you let's sing that one if the musicians can come because we're going to pray there are some prayer requests and then and then we will pray over them and God will answer he said before you speak I would have answered before you can request I will answer you you are not cheap people your sons and daughters of God Amen the song says sister Tabitha you know it I must tell G I must tell Jesus and someone to help me wife parents let's start over let's study that nicely and let the musicians give us the right key you know that I'm always out of care I
