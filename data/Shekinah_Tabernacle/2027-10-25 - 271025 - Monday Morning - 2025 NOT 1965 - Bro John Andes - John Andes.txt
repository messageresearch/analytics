So, so today we actually have a but today the the youth are going to be playing today. So, we've got like you notice there's all new people there apart from &gt;&gt; Jimmy. He's still a youth. Yeah. So, so this is this is quite a big moment for them. But um you know and the Lord he he helps us and trains us and grows us and you know that's that. So we try and do the same thing with the with the youth in our church. You know, the Bible says, "Do not despise the day of small things." Not that this is a small thing. You know, sometimes when something starts, you think, "Oh, let's, you know, whatever it is, but you know, we all start somewhere." So, yeah. But they're going to be great. They're all They're very They professionals, so let's go. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh, some glad morning. Some glad morning.

Well, my mama told a story from the Bible long ago about Shadrach, Meack, and Obedo. How the wicked king commanded they be thrown into the flame because they would not bow and then deny their father's name. Mama said the king stood high upon a balcony so tall. And when he looked up, he was shocked by all the things he saw. Cuz he thought that he laying dead upon the ground. But instead of three, he counted four walking all around. Then I said, "Mama, wait a minute. There's one thing that I must know. The three went in, the tree came out. Then where did that fourth man go? And I never will forget it. Mama danced across the floor. And these were the words I heard her say while shouting through the door. Well, she said, "He's still in the fire and he's walking in flame and he'll be there to help you when you call upon his name. And he can still deliver by his almighty power here below. It's good to know he's still in the fire. Oh my friend, you may be destined to face life's hottest flame. But I'm glad that I can tell you through the power of his name. Not one flame of fire will touch you. You'll come through it and you'll tell. Yesterday, today, forever, God is still alive. And well, well, he's still in the fire and he's walking in the flame. And he'll be there to help you when you call upon his name. And he can still deliver by his almighty power. While here below, it's good to know he's still in He's still in the fire. He's still in the fire. And he's walking in the flame. And he will be there to help you when you call upon his name. And he can still deliver by it. Almighty power. While he below, it's good to know he still in the fire. While here below, it's good to know he's still in the fire. While here below, it's good to know he's still in the fire. Amen. Amen.

[Applause] Amen. Just just Oh, you can get just Praise the Lord. You know the the um the three specials there one after the other were speaking about mountains and it seems to be each camp has a different theme but this one seems to be that the this mountain moving theme running through it. And there's three things that we can understand about a mountain. The first thing about a mountain is that it's been there for a long time. And the second thing is it's very big. And the third thing is it's supposedly unmovable. But not today. &gt;&gt; Not this season. This is mountain moving season. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what is in your life. It doesn't matter how big it is. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how long it's been there for. &gt;&gt; If you want it to move, it's going to move. &gt;&gt; It's mountain moving season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand this morning and just sing some worship songs before we call up brother John. Brother John, we deposited a lot of money in your bank, too. So, you're you're back up to you're in the millions for this morning's service, brother. You got money in the bank. [Music] I'm s Further stormy sea.

If some of you in the back want to move a little closer, I'm being really serious. I'm serious. If there's some in the back that want to move, just grab your Bible. Come up a little closer. Come up a little closer. I mean, David is on the front row all by himself right here. &gt;&gt; He needs company. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. Thank you. Just move on a little closer. Yeah. Just move up a little bit. Grab your Bibles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thought maybe a sister would come up and stand by brother David maybe. Or Hallelujah. You all know what happens after those things happen. Then you just start moving back and back. and your children and then [Music] Amen. God bless you. I'm just going to let you have your seats for a moment and we this is our final words and I'm going to make a deal with you about the length of the service. So, &gt;&gt; Amen. Just after we have some opening comments and we read our scriptures, I'm going to make a deal with you. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Cuz some of you all stayed up all night. I heard last night and so you just were must have been fasting and praying and talking about the word and my we thank everyone for all your giving the just every part of it the coffees who appreciated the coffees and Amen you know as a minister pastor you get all kinds of spiritual questions Is there going to be coffee in heaven? Is there going to be chocolate in heaven? You know, this is serious, you know, and well, all that you loved or ever loved you. So, you answer the question. Amen. Amen. Isn't the Lord good? And the the food, the fellowship, the room, the um showers, the the towels, the water. &gt;&gt; The water was hot. Was it hot in your room? &gt;&gt; My That's incredible. &gt;&gt; I've been to camps where it's been cold. &gt;&gt; You take cold. I guess it wakes you up, you know, and cold plunges aren't bad for you. Some of the people left uh last evening and some left this morning for Auckland and other churches and some have to leave immediately after the service. So, we're very mindful of our time and our our time together. And um back at home um our church has already had their morning service and they're about ready to have their Sunday evening service cuz the time change. You know, you all live in the future, &gt;&gt; living in the future. You know that that's New Zealand. &gt;&gt; And so we're really thankful that um God's given you churches and the church bodies and and um well, how's the sheep doing this morning? [Applause] Amen. I had to just remind everybody, you can you can be as spiritual as you want to and &gt;&gt; but when it all comes down to it, we're just sheep. Amen. And &gt;&gt; somebody said, "Dumb sheep." Well, sheep need to be led. And &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said, "We can't even lead one another." &gt;&gt; So, um, we just are thankful for the Lord. I wanted to make a couple comments. Um, and that is if the Lord has spoken to anyone during these services and meetings and you've never been baptized, I would encourage you. I know that uh brother Jonathan's messages have been so profound and the times in the word, but sometimes we forget that there's hearts that are maybe just young and tender or new ones or children that um just need to take that step. And I want to encourage you, the Bible says to repent and to be baptized, every one of you, and that you would be filled with the Holy Ghost. So, if the Lord has talked to you and you've never been baptized or I would just encourage you to take those steps &gt;&gt; and let the Lord fill you with the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and then I feel it's real important to get into a good home church. &gt;&gt; Um, support a home church with your presence. You know, my wife and I, we just visited back where I was born and raised in Jeffersonville and the Brandham Tabernacle, and it just sits, it sits empty today. There's no sermons. There's no Sunday school. There's no children. There's no amens. &gt;&gt; They've changed in their thoughts. They're just staying home and press and play. &gt;&gt; I'll be very honest with you. If brother Brandham was alive and back on the scene, he would be ashamed of that. &gt;&gt; Going to church is what every Christian should do. &gt;&gt; And that's not even staying home and streaming. &gt;&gt; I know through co and things and I still got money in the bank. Amen. So, &gt;&gt; and I'm leaving this afternoon, too. But going to a home church isn't just all about you. It's for others. &gt;&gt; I saw it even last night to some that are in these meetings that don't have a home church and they stream and they whatever. But I saw other people connect with that person. And I just want to remind you as a sister, as a brother that church is not all about you. It's about being part of a body and &gt;&gt; being part of people that can um be together. &gt;&gt; Streaming is not the answer. &gt;&gt; And through COVID and things, I know people from New Zealand, you can stream from America or Trinidad or Europe or somewhere around the world, but that's not your pastor. &gt;&gt; You need to get under a pastor, &gt;&gt; a local pastor. It's not good enough on a Sunday to listen stream three or four or five of your favorite ministers from America or Europe or somewhere else. That's not the order of the of the Holy Spirit for your life. &gt;&gt; And I I'm I'm a pastor. You don't need to come to my church. You don't just always need to say, "I like this certain brother, this certain purse, and this certain music program, and then just sit there in your chair with, you know, your little bunny slippers, you know, and your coffee and &gt;&gt; you know, and go to the bathroom and come back and they're still preaching." That's not church. &gt;&gt; You need to go physically &gt;&gt; and support it with your presence and be present in worship. &gt;&gt; So repent. be baptized, receive the word for your day, and then get into a local church &gt;&gt; that you can serve. I understand that there's some here that are are moving to Perth, Australia on Tuesday. Can they stand to their feet? Can they stand to their feet? Some of our the family that's going to Perth, Australia, and God bless you. I think there's a family and children going there. God bless you. Um, thank you. Um, I I was 16 years old when my father moved us to another church and to be part of a ministry and and um it wasn't easy for them. They my father and mother made a decision to move their children to a church and sacrificed for that. And I um I'm thankful for that. Sometimes doing what God asks us to do is not easy. &gt;&gt; And um this is our last service and so the comments that's going to be made today is kind of uh moving beyond the now, looking beyond the now. And it's just looking down the road and after you leave camp, every single person that drove into this camp through that um fence there when I drove across it and the little place that they have so sheep and cattle and and horses can't cross, I just prayed that every single person that came in when they go out that they would have had a um something happen within their hearts. Can the church say amen? That &gt;&gt; we came in and we go out. But I pray for you that as you go out that the Holy Spirit would have lodged something deep within your heart. &gt;&gt; Four years ago, we made decisions uh in our local area and we've made decisions. I wrote these notes when brother Jonathan um was um speaking last night because I knew that this was going to be my last Where is Brother Jonathan? There's brother Jonathan who appreciated the words that we have. Amen. Hallelujah. The message. And I'm not going to get into our testimony or my wife's life and what's happened to us in the last four years. Brother um Jonathan mentioned his wife and his family or his personal ministry. I was streaming in January when brother Jonathan made a decision to from being a pastor to join another church and be a part of that group and it's not easy. Every decision that we make is not always easy &gt;&gt; and many times others will misunderstand. &gt;&gt; They might even cancel culture you and cancel you &gt;&gt; out of their lives. But you just need to know that that's what the Lord's called you to do. &gt;&gt; We stand by grace. We live by grace. &gt;&gt; We preach it. We talk about it. But when we walk out of this uh camp and drive out of here, we're going to need grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just spoken from a preacher, but we need it every single day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; So today, and if you're writing notes, would like to write down a title, like to know where we're coming from. I would like to speak on 2025, not 1965. &gt;&gt; We're not in 1965. &gt;&gt; That's 60 years ago. &gt;&gt; To the bride of New Zealand, we must turn the corner. &gt;&gt; This is Monday morning, October the 27th. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Did I have the date right? &gt;&gt; And whether we like it or not, &gt;&gt; whether we realize it or not, it's not a surprise that we're living in 2025. &gt;&gt; Your cell phones tell you that, your computers tell you that, the calendar just keeps turning. It keeps turning. It's not a surprise to anybody in the natural that we're 2025. But why is it so difficult to see that we're in another season spiritually? We are in another season. And before we stand, I just wanted because I'm going to make you deal in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; I'm going to make you a deal. I'm going to hold to it. And um cuz I'm not going to keep you long. But when brother Brandham was talking in in 1964, this is after the seals, he said each generation, the church usually gets it so mixed up and everything till when the time comes for the word to be fulfilled. They're looking back to some other generation way back what happened way back some other day and they miss seeing what's happened in that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; In another place, he said, "Science don't look back." They say what science says. I read where science proved by rolling a ball over in France about 300 years ago, if a man ever went the terrific speed of 35 miles an hour, he'd leave the earth. And I come back down here and he was talking about traveling to the meeting at about 60 miles an hour. That's 100 kilometers an hour. So science don't refer back to that. Science doesn't refer back to, well, if we go 35, we're going to leave the earth because we're already traveling faster today. &gt;&gt; You say, well, I'm I'm going to whatever science says. Whatever science says. No, science don't even refer back to that. They keep pressing on. They got him now looking hundreds of miles an hour. They don't stop at that. They just keep on pressing. But we we're looking back. What did Finny say? What did Sanki say? What did Moody say? They were fine men. So was Moses. So was Joseph. That was another age. &gt;&gt; Let's see what the word says today. What Jesus Christ is. &gt;&gt; Let's all say is. &gt;&gt; I don't want to offend anyone right away. Finny was a good man. Sanki was a fine man. Moody was a fine man. Moses was a good person. Joseph was a good person. WILLIAM BRHAM WAS A GOOD PERSON. YES. &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; I want to live back there. No, you're 2025. &gt;&gt; Wake up today. &gt;&gt; I didn't lose anybody already. Did I say your title? You lost me. Well, just get just keep looking down the road. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So our last quote before we stand these little creeds and and greater than Solomon, he said if you know our creed and he said you're looking back to what Luther said, a great man of his day, no more than some of these women here 75 years old trying to be 16. Looking back trying to dress like they're 16, cut off their hair, wear shorts. He said, "Anybody that drives looking through a rear view mirror has a wreck." &gt;&gt; And that's what's the matter with the church today. It's looking through a rear view mirror to what it was. &gt;&gt; No wonder it's wrecked up. Paul said, "Pressing to the mark of the high calling, I go forth. I go forward." &gt;&gt; LET THE LORD PUT THAT FAITH IN YOUR HEART TODAY. Every single man and woman that came to this camp, I go forth. &gt;&gt; I GO FORWARD. &gt;&gt; I know Moo. Mr. Moody was a great man. Mr. Wesley was a great man. The Pentecostal move. The Baptist move were great. But let's press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ. Don't look through a rear view mirror 40 years ago. &gt;&gt; Look what is tonight. Can I say this morning? Look what the scripture promises tonight. He did promise THEM IN THAT DAY. BUT WE'RE LIVING ON above there. Now we're going on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not leaving THE MESSAGE, BUT THE MESSAGE IS MOVING on in the people. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this again. I hope I'm not offending anyone. Mr. Moody was a great man. Mr. Wesley was a great man. The Pentecostal move was great. Baptist move was great. SO WAS WILLIAM BRHAM. A GREAT MOVE OF GOD. BUT WE'RE NOT IN 1965. &gt;&gt; Wake up. Look to YOUR NEIGHBOR AND SAY, "THIS IS 2025." [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm doing that cuz some of you stayed up till 1 and 2 in the morning. And &gt;&gt; so, let's all make a deal. It's 10:55 &gt;&gt; almost 11:00. Well, let's make a deal that Brother John will turn the service over to brother Brother Isaac or Brother Ben before 12:00. &gt;&gt; One hour. &gt;&gt; Who thinks we It's the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; So, can we make a deal? Yes, &gt;&gt; brother Jonno will keep my part, &gt;&gt; but you got to keep your part. &gt;&gt; You You I know you're weary, but you just got to say, "Lord, help me focus, Lord, in your word. It's not by might, not by power, but I need what's going to be spoken for down the road next week or the Can we agree with that?" So, Brother John will do my part. I'll watch my time and we can stay focused. I could preach for three hours, &gt;&gt; but let's just keep it focused. Keep it within the hour. We can pray, sing, say goodbye, love one another, cry on one another's shoulders, take all the photos you want. &gt;&gt; Do we all agree? &gt;&gt; So, no dazing off and everybody's lumping down and &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's get in the spirit together and let's hear what the spirit would say to the church. Okay, let's go. Leviticus chapter 23. We stand together. Turn to the scripture. No, &gt;&gt; it's by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So, I had kind of have two parts of the the message this morning. I've brought this with me today. Does anybody know what this is here? &gt;&gt; This is a baton. This is a baton. So, about halfway through, we're going to kind of make a turn and speak about trusting the new generation, passing on the new generation, and passing the baton &gt;&gt; to the new generation. So first is Leviticus 23:9. Lord, just take the word now as we take it into our hearts. May our hearts burn within us while you talk to us along the road. Help us as your children to be disciplined. Help us to be focused. May it not be word only, intellectual only, but let it be the Holy Spirit taking the things that we need for tomorrow, for Wednesday, for the coming days. If you would, Terry, I'm just being reminded right now of our believers in Jamaica that uh there's a forecasted uh storm hurricane coming striking their country and there's believers there. Our brother Jonathan just came from there. He's going to Pakistan in a few days. But some of our believers in Jamaica need our prayers today from the flooding, from all the rain, from all the waves. I pray in the name of Jesus that you would calm that storm and do a miracle. The news is saying how catastrophic it's going to be to destroy even most of the country. I pray in the name of Jesus that the believers would be safe that you would keep them. Lord, you did it for my wife and I. You turned a category 4 hurricane coming straight for us and you moved it and went off the path. Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus, you would be with your saints. Lord, in Jamaica and New Zealand and around this world, LORD, FILL US WITH THE HOLY GHOST. LORD, EVEN WHILE WE HEAR THE WORD, SEND US OFF ON OUR ROADS AND THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY TRAVELING WITH SAFETY AND MERCY. I pray, Lord, we are in 2025. Give us the strength we have need of for the journey in Jesus' name. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Leviticus 23 and verse 9, we see the Lord speaking unto Moses. Verse 10, speak unto the children of Israel and saying unto them, when you become into the land which I give unto you and shall reap, do you notice how positive the word is. &gt;&gt; Come on, we need your strength today. When ye become, not if, not maybe, you're going to drop off along the road, you shall reap the harvest thereof, &gt;&gt; then you shall bring a sheath &gt;&gt; of the first fruits &gt;&gt; OF YOUR HARVEST UNTO THE PRIEST, &gt;&gt; and he shall wave the sheath before the Lord &gt;&gt; to be accepted for you &gt;&gt; on the Tomorrow after the Sabbath, THE PRIEST SHALL WAVE IT. &gt;&gt; The Sabbath IS THE SEVENTH DAY. THE TOMORROW IS THE DAY AFTER THE EIGHTH DAY. &gt;&gt; You were, IT WAS TO BE WAVED. THE PRIEST WAS TO WAVE it over the congregation over &gt;&gt; verse 12. And ye shall offer that day which ye wave the sheath and helium without blemish of the first year. THIS IS A TYPE OF CHRIST, THE TOKEN, THE lamb being waved for you and I. Verse 14, the last part of this, THE LAST PART OF verse 14 says this would be a statute forever. Let's all say forever. &gt;&gt; Forever &gt;&gt; throughout your generations in the message, in all your dwellings. &gt;&gt; Verse 15. And you, and that's 2025. AMEN. IN ALL OF YOUR DWELLINGS, IN ALL OF YOUR SERVICES, WAVE THE TOKEN over the people. &gt;&gt; Verse 15, you shall count unto you. Here's another revelation. From the tomorrow after the Sabbath, &gt;&gt; from the day that ye brought the sheath of the wave offering, seven Sabbaths, &gt;&gt; seven * 7 is 49 shall be complete. Verse 16, but even unto the tomorrow after the seventh Sabbath shall you number 50 days. &gt;&gt; 7 * 7 is 49 Sabbaths. The next day would be 50. 50 is Jubilee. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; So let's focus. It is the rising of the sun. It is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not just a message. &gt;&gt; BUT I ASK YOU TODAY, WHAT HAS THIS RISING &gt;&gt; PRODUCED &gt;&gt; IN THE LIVES OF THE BELIEVERS IN NEW ZEALAND? &gt;&gt; What has it produced? I was just a few days ago with brother Donnie Reagan here in Kentucky. This was the church that was being dedicated to the Lord. I didn't have internet in my room or I would have um show put in my notes because I gave my notes last night. So everything I say today and things was on my heart and what the Lord as far as putting on the screen or quotes was already by last night before brother Jonathan spoke. And a lot of what he said I just my my my I was like my I'm just going to be repeating but it's good for us. I would have put a picture of our of the Shakina camp right there to show you this is 2025 &gt;&gt; 1965 our prophet spoke a message it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful message. It is the rising of the sun. Not just su n but the s o n. But it's also the setting of the sun. IT SHALL BE LIGHT IN the evening time. &gt;&gt; SO IN THE TIME OF THE GOING DOWN OF THE SEN, THERE'S A RISING OF THE MOON, &gt;&gt; WHICH IS THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S A RISING OF THE SUN, THERE'S A RISING OF THE BRIDE. THERE'S A GOING DOWN OF THE SUN, THERE'S A RISING OF THE MOON. AS he rose, she will rise. THE SAME SPIRIT THAT ROSE HIM FROM THE DEAD IS WHAT ROSE THE BRIDE OUT OF THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; SHE HAS RISEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED CHRIST THROUGH THIS MESSAGE DWELLS IN YOU AND I. IT HAS QUICKENED US FROM OUR DEADNESS OF THE WORLD AND A AND DENOMINATION. YOU SAY THAT TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE MESSAGE. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT A DENOMINATION. SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, STAY WITH THE TAPES. STAY WITH THE TAPES. YOUR CHILDREN DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A TAPE IS. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A CASSETTE IS. IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. IT'S ABOUT STAY WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT MESSAGE HAS QUICKENED OUR SOULS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS SPOKEN IN 1965 and and those that word HAS QUICKENED OUR SPIRITS. IT'S QUICKENED OUR BODIES BACK TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But we're not living in 1965. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH JUST FOR US TO BE QUOTERS OF THE message &gt;&gt; spiritually. We must live in a SEASON THAT GOD HAS PLANTED US. &gt;&gt; I'm being very focused. If I'm looking down, that's because I want to BE VERY SPECIFIC. WE'RE NOT IN A PAST SEASON. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LIVING IN ANOTHER DAY. WE'RE LIVING TODAY. AND WE NEED TO STOP JUST ALWAYS LOOKING BACK, LOOKING BACK IN a rear view AND WANTING THE GOOD OLD DAYS. &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE GOOD OLD DAYS &gt;&gt; FOR OUR CHILDREN, FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, FOR THE NEW GENERATION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THE GOD OF THE YESTERDAY MUST BE THE GOD OF TODAY. NOT A QUOTE, NOT JUST A SCRIPTURE, NOT A POWERPOINT, NOT A A SONG THAT GETS US WHERE WE'RE JUST YES. YES. YES. AND THEN TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, WE'RE JUST RIGHT DOWN. THE SAME GOD THAT'S BEEN AT THIS CAMP IS GOING TO BE WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; HE LIVES IN YOU. &gt;&gt; God has called YOU FOR THE NOW. &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLED YOU TO LIVE IN A PRESENT GENERATION. &gt;&gt; And to live in THE GLARE OF A PAST AGE IS NOT FOR THE BRIDE. TO ALWAYS BE TALKING ABOUT THE PAST, &gt;&gt; BUT TO BE ALWAYS LOOKING FORWARD AND TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE &gt;&gt; AND MISSING WHAT GOD IS DOING TODAY IS A MAJOR FAILURE &gt;&gt; OF EVERY AGE. THEY'VE ALWAYS QUOTED AND QUOTED JESUS WHEN HE WAS HERE. THEY WERE QUOTING MOSES, ABRAHAM, and all that. AND AND THEY MISSED THE GOD OF THEM. &gt;&gt; And then PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAVEN AND THE MILLENNIUM AND OUR FUTURE HOME. AND WE CAN ALL GET GUILTY OF THIS. OH, I WANT TO BE THERE AND OH HEAVEN, WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE, YOU KNOW, ONE ETERNAL YOUTH CAMP. WE CAN KIND OF LIVE LIKE THAT. AND THEN HERE WE GOT TO GO BACK TO school and back to &gt;&gt; So we need to ask the Lord. AND I WAS THINKING OF THIS THIS MORNING. WE CAN HEAR GREAT MESSAGES. WE CAN BE UNDER INSPIRED PREACHERS. WE CAN JUST FEEL LIKE THERE THERE'S ANGELS ALL AROUND US AND WE GET CAUGHT UP INTO A CERTAIN PLACE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO OUR SCHOOL AND BACK TO OUR JOBS AND BACK TO OUR HOMES. THE THE HOME CHURCH WILL PROBABLY HAVE SERVICES WEDNESDAY or Thursday or next Sunday. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE LIVING OFF THE PAST. &gt;&gt; I WANT A GOD OF TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE CAN MISS WHAT GOD'S DOING TODAY, LOOKING BACK, LOOKING FORWARD. WE'VE GOT TO WALK IN THE LIGHT &gt;&gt; AS IT'S BEING REVEALED TODAY. [Applause] &gt;&gt; How many remember the message birth pains? &gt;&gt; And how many know what year it was preached in? &gt;&gt; 1965. Brother Brandham was speaking, opening up his scripture. His wife had given him a Bible. The pages stuck together. He's trying to read a scripture he didn't know at the time. A CATHOLIC PRIEST that was on the the platform passed him his Bible AND ACTUALLY PROPHESIED to him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham called him Brother Stanley. &gt;&gt; Brother Stanley. &gt;&gt; He he passed him his Bible and brother Brandham READ THE SCRIPTURE. BIRTH PAINS and then handed it back TO THE PRIEST. HE PREACHED A WHOLE MESSAGE OF BIRTH PAINANS &gt;&gt; AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY LIVING in a prophecy &gt;&gt; TILL IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN HIS CHILDREN NEEDED A sandwich &gt;&gt; and him AND HIS WIFE WERE TALKING IN THE CAR AND WASN'T YOU SO embarrassed she said and he SAID NO NO I JUST IT'S A NEW BIBLE AND THE PAGES WERE STUCK TOGETHER AND THEY GOT IT AND THEY REALIZED THE PAGES WERE JUST STUCK TOGETHER. HE WAS READING FROM ANOTHER PLACE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY SPIRIT SPOKE TO HIM AND SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE SCRIPTURE &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PRIEST HANDED THE BIBLE, HANDED THE SCROLL TO JESUS." &gt;&gt; AND HE FOUND THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS WRITTEN IN ISAIAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I've come to heal the brokenhearted. &gt;&gt; SET THE CAPTIVES FREE. LOOSE THOSE THAT ARE BOUND. THE EYES COME OPEN. HE FOUND HIS PLACE &gt;&gt; AND HE GAVE IT BACK TO THE PRIEST. IT WAS ONLY THEN, &gt;&gt; SEE, HE WENT BACK TO HIS NORMAL COURSE OF LIFE WHEN THE LIGHTS CAME ON AND HE REALIZED THIS DAY, THIS SCRIPTURE is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; The very next night after birth pains, he spoke that to the to the church. I think it was 20 or 30 minutes. that when he went back to Jeffersonville and speak that spoke that weekend, don't don't worry about this young man. Don't let him be distracted. We we we're under a time limit. Amen. He's just being fine. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless the lambs. &gt;&gt; My thought about this is if William Brham, OUR PROPHET, COULD PREACH A WHOLE MESSAGE AND NOT REALIZE HE'S FULFILLING THAT UNTIL LATER, WHAT ABOUT THE BRIDE OF CHRIST? IS IT POSSIBLE that you and I COULD ACTUALLY BE FULFILLING THE SCRIPTURE FOR TODAY, PROPHECY FOR TODAY, AND NOT EVEN REALIZE IT TILL THE HOLY GHOST OPENS OUR EYES AND WE BEGIN TO SEE THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD SPOKE ABOUT IN THE BIBLE IS HAPPENING RIGHT IN MY LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WENT BACK TO JEFFERSONVILLE AND SPOKE THIS DAY THIS SCRIPTURE is fulfilled and laid it all OUT THERE SO THAT we would understand. BUT THAT WAS 1965. &gt;&gt; So from 1965 TO 2025 IS 60 YEARS. &gt;&gt; I'm asking believers here in New Zealand, what did that produce in your country? What has it birthed? &gt;&gt; CUZ HE WAS TALKING ABOUT BIRTH PAINS. AND A WOMAN when is in travail. A woman is a type of the church. &gt;&gt; What did she produce? &gt;&gt; We're 60 YEARS LATER. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT A LITTLE B BRIDE BOUNCING DOWN THE aisle like just youth and everything's JUST NEW. WE'RE 60 YEARS NOW. EVEN THE BRIDE IN NEW ZEALAND is older. &gt;&gt; Some of you older ONES HAVE HAD A CHANGE OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT AS WET AS IT USED TO BE. THE SEED DOESN'T COME DOWN THERE. THE FUN AND EXCITEMENT OF BEING NEWLY MARRIED AND ALL OF THAT. A LOT OF I'VE HEAR A LOT ABOUT CHURCH PROBLEMS AND CHURCH ISSUES AND THINGS, BUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE IN THAT FERTILE TIME WHERE THE WORD IS STRIKING THEIR HEARTS AND THEY NEED TO HAVE IT FRESH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT THE CHURCH OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE BRIDE IS NOT JUST A YOUNG YOUTHFUL HEARING AT IT FOR THIS TIME AND YOU KNOW FIVE BAPTISMS EVERY SUNDAY AND WE'VE HAD 10 BAPTISMS IN THE LAST MONTH. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT ANYMORE. WE ARE IN ANOTHER SEASON. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HAS THE MESSAGE PRODUCED &gt;&gt; IN our lives? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT IN 1965 &gt;&gt; and it's not GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE NEW GENERATION JUST TO HEAR ABOUT THE WAY THAT IT USED TO be &gt;&gt; because the whole mission of THE MESSAGE IS TO PRODUCE CHRIST BACK INTO THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE MISSION OF THE GOSPEL IS TO PRODUCE JESUS CHRIST BACK AGAIN IN THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE OLD PEOPLE, THE YOUNG PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AND IN THE CHURCH AGE BOOK WHEN BROTHER BRANDON WAS TALKING ABOUT THE AGES AND THE TIMES AND AND THE BLACKOUT OF THE WORD AND things and how it would come to where there would be even coming into A GREAT TRIBULATION. BUT IF YOU ARE TRUE SEED and are truly baptized WITH THE HOLY GHOST, YOU will esteem HIS WORD ABOVE YOUR NECESSARY MEAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS GROANING, THIS CRY, THIS THIRST HAS GOT TO BE MORE THAN OUR MORNING COFFEE. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE GREATER THAN WHAT CHURCH YOU BELONG TO AND WHO MY FRIEND LIST IS AND WHETHER THEY'RE THUMBS UP OR WHETHER THEY'RE THUMBS DOWN. I'M SERVING JESUS. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PART OF A CLUB. I I DON'T I'M NOT DIRECTED BY A GROUP OF MINISTERS CHAT THAT, YOU KNOW, PUTS THUMBS UP AND OH YES, BROTHER AND FRIENDS. IF ALL HELL, ALL THE WORLD IS AGAINST YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT GOD'S CALLED YOU TO DO. &gt;&gt; There's no man, THERE'S NO WOMAN, THERE'S NO FRIEND, THERE'S NO ONE THAT CAN MOVE YOU OFF TRACK. &gt;&gt; BUT WHY HAVE SO MANY GOT OFF TRACK? &gt;&gt; WHY HAVE WE MADE CLUBS AROUND THE MESSAGE? &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, WE ARE LIVING IN 2025, NOT 1965. Joel chapter 1 and VERSE TWO TALKS ABOUT I WILL RESTORE SAYETH THE LORD &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS GOD. I WILL RESTORE. &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE IS NOT MAYBE. &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE SAYAETH THE LORD MEANS I'M GOING TO MAKE AMENDS. I'm going to end ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH AND ALL THE STRUGGLES AND YOU SAY WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE MILLENNIUM. NO, HE'S TALKING ABOUT INTERNALLY. HE'S GOING TO FINISH THE WAR. HE'S GOING TO STOP THE FIGHTING. HE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU BACK AGAIN ALL THE YEARS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT GOOD. HE'S GOING TO PERFECT YOU. HE'S GOING TO PERFORM IT. &gt;&gt; AND BRING YOU TO PEACE. &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL PROSPER. &gt;&gt; GOD IS GOING TO REWARD YOU FOR GIVING YOUR LIFE TO HIM. YOU ARE NOT A BEGGAR. YOU ARE NOT A SECOND RATE CITIZEN. YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THESE BIBLE DAYS. WE'RE LIVING IN 2025. &gt;&gt; BUT THESE ARE BIBLE DAYS AGAIN. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT IN 1965. BUT IF BROTHER BRANDHAM STOOD HERE, AS BROTHER JONATHAN STOOD HERE, and we STOOD HERE, BROTHER BEN STOOD HERE AND THESE OTHER PASTORS THAT WERE HERE THIS WEEKEND, I BELIEVE THE BRIDE OF NEW ZEALAND IS A TROPHY OF GOD'S AMAZING GRACE. DON'T TALK TO ME ALWAYS JUST ABOUT YOUR TROUBLES AND YOUR WARINGS AND YOUR FIGHTINGS BECAUSE THE WORD HAS ALREADY LIFTED US UP INTO HEAVENLY PLACES. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T SEE YOUR SPOTS. HE DOESN'T SEE YOUR WRINKLES. HE FRIENDS, WE NOT JUST IN THE FRONT YARD OR THE BACKYARD. OUR LIVES IS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, IN THE FRONT YARD WE ALL ARE NICE AND GOOD, BUT WE FIGHT IN THE BACKYARD." BUT THE BRIDE IS LEARNING we cannot FIGHT IN THE BACKYARD. &gt;&gt; STOP YOUR FIGHTING. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I will restore means I'm going to bring your mind back to where it ought to be. &gt;&gt; I'm going to BRING YOUR SPIRIT BACK TO where it ought to be. &gt;&gt; YOUR WANDERING SPIRIT, YOUR TROUBLED MIND. I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO WHERE YOU CAN BE WHOLE &gt;&gt; AND COMPLETE. &gt;&gt; I SPEAK IT OVER YOU AT OUR LAST SERVICE. GOD HAS GIVEN YOU A COVENANT OF PEACE. &gt;&gt; AND AND WE HAVE OUR COMPLETENESS TODAY IN JESUS CHRIST. MY SOUND MIND HAS BEEN GIVEN ME BY JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; He is your medicine. &gt;&gt; HE IS YOUR GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT AGAINST MEDICATION. I'M NOT AGAINST MENTAL ILLNESS uh situations where PEOPLE NEED MEDICINE. BUT OUR GOD IS THE ONLY HEALER THERE IS. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT AGAINST CRUTCHES OR WHEELCHAIRS OR I'M NOT AGAINST THINGS OF THIS LIFE THAT WE NEED. AND AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED pills or HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR LOW PRESSURE, WHATEVER IT IS. I WAS LISTENING TO A MESSAGE THE OTHER DAY AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THIS. HE SAID, "TAKE THE SUGAR OUT OF THEIR BLOOD." TALKING ABOUT DIABETES. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THERE'S POWER IN THE WORD TODAY. &gt;&gt; But if YOU HAVE BLOOD SUGAR PROBLEMS AND DIABETES AND STRUGGLE WITH THAT TILL YOU DIE, GOD'S STILL MY HEALER. &gt;&gt; AND THE MOMENT I PASS FROM THIS LIFE INTO ANOTHER, I CHANGED. I KNOW HAVE NO DIABETES IN THAT OTHER PLACE. &gt;&gt; I MIGHT STRUGGLE HERE, BUT THERE'S NO STRUGGLE THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Speaking to some of you privately and hearing your testimony. Some of you are so vulnerable and honest. Even yesterday, some speaking about suicide and things that have happened in your families, in your homes. Yesterday after we closed the service, I was sitting over there and I think brother um Isaac mentioned something about seeing someone committing suicide. I'll never forget being born and raised in the tabernacle. Can I give something personal real I'm going to be quick. I'm speaking quickly. My best friend being raised in the Brandham Tabernacle was the pastor's grandson. His father was a deacon. If I would say his name, you would know it from the messages. And I was raised up. HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND IN THE BRANDOM TABERNACLE. We grew up together. I was in his home, slept in the bed. We were friends. But as WE GOT INTO OUR TEENAGE YEARS, HE KIND OF WENT ANOTHER WAY AND BECAME PART of his student council at at the high school, lost his he would COME TO CHURCH. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT JUST HE BEGIN TO GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. THEY found him one day. He had committed suicide and taken his own life. I'LL NEVER FORGET BEING IN THE GRAVESIDE. IT'S THE GRAVE, SAME GRAVESIDE WHERE BROTHER WILLIAM BRANDHAM IS BURIED, where brother Billy Paul is buried, where my grandpa's buried there. Many other believers is buried there in Jeffersonville. He's buried THERE. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY. I MEAN, THEIR SCHOOL BUSES ARE PACKED FULL of young people from all around and him from his school. He was popular and he had committed suicide. I'LL NEVER FORGET BEING THERE. IT'S IN MY MIND FOREVER seeing his mother just throw herself OVER HIS CASKET AND SAY, "BUT YOU NEVER SAID GOODBYE." &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; A MOTHER JUST WAILING. YOU NEVER SAID GOODBYE. &gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. AND I THOUGHT OF SATAN, HOW HE COMES TO BREAK UP HOMES AND COME THROUGH A MOTHER, THROUGH A FATHER, THROUGH A SITUATION IN AT SCHOOL, SOMEBODY BULLYING YOU, ABUSE THAT HAPPEN, SEXUAL ABUSE, MENTAL ABUSE, and how it wears on us. AND OFTEN TIMES WE FEEL BROKEN &gt;&gt; AND CONTRITE. SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE THE LITTLEST person in the message. &gt;&gt; WE FEEL LIKE A DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE A CHRISTIAN. I I'VE PRAYED WITH MOTHERS THAT ARE EVEN WONDERING WHETHER THEY HAVE THE HOLY GHOST OR NOT. &gt;&gt; IT'S INCREDIBLE. WE WE FACE INCREDIBLE MIND BATTLES. &gt;&gt; AND THEN TO HAVE THE WORD COME TO US LIKE WE EVEN THIS WEEKEND IS SO POSITIVE AND SO GOOD AND WE CAN STAND. WE CAN LIFT OUR HANDS. WE CAN WE CAN EVEN DANCE. &gt;&gt; BUT THE REALITY OF OUR EXPERIENCE COMES RIGHT BACK WHEN THEN WE'RE FACED WITH OUR THE THE THE NORMAL COURSE OF LIFE. THIS THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING. OFTEN TIMES THERE'S A GREAT DISCONNECT between the message, the sermons we hear, CHARISMATIC PREACHERS THAT ARE ANOINTED, AND THEN JUST OUR DAILY LIVES. LET'S BE REAL. &gt;&gt; THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT. THE MUSIC, the church, Brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; these ministers, AND AND WE CAN ALMOST BECOME WHERE WE MAKE GOOD MINISTERS ALLSTAR PREACHERS, AND WE MAKE THEM OUR BEST AND ON OUR LIST, AND WE GOT TO JUST BE FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN WE'RE IN, OH, HEARING THAT SERVICE. IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE'LL RAISE A WHOLE GENERATION LIKE THE DRUG ERA THAT JUST LOOK FOR FRIDAY NIGHT, THE NEXT PUNT, THE NEXT MOVEMENT, THE NEXT PRAYER LINE, THE NEXT SPECIAL SERVICE, THE NEXT MEETING. I'VE GOT TO HAVE THIS. AND FRIENDS, THAT IS A RAZOR'S EDGE FROM REALITY. Back in Leviticus 23, &gt;&gt; remember when the field was there and crops were growing, they would go into the first ones that came to maturity and cut down a sheath. Amen. &gt;&gt; They would bring it to the house of God and the priest would wave it over the field &gt;&gt; AS A PROMISE &gt;&gt; THAT THERE WILL BE OTHERS IN THE FIELD THAT WOULD COME TO THE SAME LEVEL OF MATURITY. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE WAS WAVED OVER YOU. &gt;&gt; CHRIST WAS WAVED OVER YOU. &gt;&gt; NOT WILLIAM BRHAM, BUT CHRIST WAS WAVED OVER YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WITH A PROMISE &gt;&gt; THAT THERE'S OTHERS OUT IN THE FIELD THAT ARE GOING TO COME TO MATURITY &gt;&gt; OF CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD. &gt;&gt; HAD HE WRIGHT WAS JUST I'VE BEEN TO HER LITTLE PLACE, HUMBLE LITTLE PLACE. BROTHER BRHAM HAD $20 IN HIS POCKET THAT SHE HAD GIVEN AS an offering. He was COMING BACK TO HER LITTLE TRAILER TO GIVE IT BACK TO HER. &gt;&gt; That's what he was THERE FOR. AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT TESTIMONIES AND THE GOD OF HEALING AND THINGS. SHE'S SITTING OVER IN THE CORNER WITH HER TEENAGERS THAT WERE JUST LAUGHING AND THEY WERE JUST IN ANOTHER SPIRITUAL LEVEL LAUGHING AND ALL THIS AND CUTTING UP AND WHEN WHEN SHE HEARD THE WORD SHE SAID THAT IS NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT IN THE 60S AND IN THE 50S THE ME BUT WE ARE NOT BACK THERE. THERE'S OTHER HADY WRITES THAT HAVE YOUNG MEN OR YOUNG LADIES OR HAVE NEEDS IN THEIR MARRIAGES OR IN THEIR FAMILY LIFE AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT IS NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How many know what that sword came down and brother Brandham's hand was a physical sword? I'D BEEN TO THE VERY SPOT IN SABINO CANYON where the light came through at I THINK IT WAS 10:10 IN THE MORNING and it only comes through THAT LITTLE PLACE AT THAT CERTAIN TIME. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS IN PRAYER and and THEN THE SWORD STRUCK HIS HAND. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A PHYSICAL SWORD. &gt;&gt; HE TURNED it and IT GLISTENED IN THE sun &gt;&gt; and the word spoke to him and SAID, "THIS IS THE KING'S SWORD. &gt;&gt; It's the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; God gave him that experience for his third pool. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM WALKED BACK OFF THAT MOUNTAIN, HE DIDN'T PICK UP CARRY THAT SWORD DOWN THERE AND THEN THROW IT INTO THE BACKSEAT OF HIS CAR AND THEN TAKE IT TO JEFFERSONVILLE to be some monument &gt;&gt; for us to go to and worship. And that's THAT'S THE PHYSICAL SWORD. IT'S A SPIRITUAL SWORD. &gt;&gt; WHERE is that sword today? &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want everyone to just catch this. This is a major part of the message. In the Old Testament, when they CUT DOWN THE MATURE one and waved it over the field, it was a promise that THERE WOULD BE OTHERS COME TO THE SAME LEVEL of of &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD. &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER, when you cut IT DOWN, THAT PART PASSED AWAY. IT WAS DEAD. YEAH, &gt;&gt; CHRIST WAS CUT DOWN. &gt;&gt; He was waved OVER US, BUT HE ROSE. &gt;&gt; WILLIAM BRHAM AS A MESSENGER CARRIED THE WORD AND IT WAS WAVED OVER us &gt;&gt; throughout the We have messages of brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Some might say, "Well, brother, I'm listening really close because I think that you're wanting us to leave the message." We're not leaving the message. We are the message. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT HE SPOKE IN 1965 HAS BECOME FLESH IN ME, &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; It's the same seed. It's the same life. It's the same fruit. &gt;&gt; And that sheath, now I'm quoting that. It is the rising of the sun and the first of your seed that you plant and when it comes up and ripens, you cut down this sheath and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the Lord for your acceptance. He said there'll have to BE A SHEATH WAVED again in the last days. talking about waving of the sheath. The first one that come to mature. HE SAID MATURITY IS WAVED OVER US. Christ the word was WAVED OVER US. THAT IS A MESSAGE THAT THERE'S MORE LIKE THIS. THERE'S MORE LIKE ME TO COME. &gt;&gt; And here WE ARE IN THE FIELD of humanity. AND GOD HAS SAVED YOU. GOD HAS FILLED YOU. GOD HAS DELIVERED YOU, healed you, recovered you. AND SOME OF YOU THAT FEEL BROKEN AND SMASHED UP AND BRUISED, LET IT BE A TESTIMONY OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. I AM RECOVERING. GOD IS RECOVERING ALL IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAN THE CAMP SAY, &gt;&gt; "AMEN." &gt;&gt; IN 1ST SAMUEL 30:8, WHEN DAVID AND AND his men left ZIGLAG AND CAME BACK and his wives AND CHILDREN, ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE were gone, the church was SMASHED UP. GOD GAVE HIM A PROMISE AND SAID WITHOUT FAIL YOU SHALL RECOVER ALL. &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS YOU WILL NOT FAIL. &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL RECOVER. MEANS I'M GOING TO DEFEND YOU. I'M GOING TO DELIVER YOU. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE DRIVE OUT OF THE CAMP TODAY, THIS AFTERNOON, WE HAVE THESE PROMISES IN EARTHN VESSELS. &gt;&gt; MY GOD IS MY DEFENDER. HE'S MY PROTECTOR. IF I'M THE ONLY YOUNG PERSON, IF THERE'S ONLY THREE IN MY YOUTH GROUP, IF I'M THE ONLY ONE IN MY FAMILY, WE ARE YOUR FAMILY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [Applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE ARE CHRIST TO ONE ANOTHER. WE ARE MERCY TO ONE ANOTHER. FRIENDS, YOU CAN TAKE ALL SIX SERVICES FROM this weekend. IT IS POSITIVE. IT IS POSITIVE. IT IS A POSITIVE TOKEN. BROTHER JONATHAN AND MYSELF. IT IS POSITIVE TOKEN. POSITIVE TOKEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM PREACHED TOKEN FOUR TIMES AND OUT OF THREE OUT OF THAT FOUR, I'M TALKING FAST, BUT HE SAID IT'S A POSITIVE TOKEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Stop dangling people over to hell with your carnal fleshly nature and your negative personality. We are not defeated. WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS. &gt;&gt; Our young PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR THIS. OUR SISTERS NEED TO HEAR THIS. &gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, HONEY. LET'S GO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You shall recover all means you shall escape. I'm going to pluck you out of that. I'M GOING TO RESCUE. I am here to rescue you. I'M GOING TO STRIP SATAN OF ALL HIS POWER. &gt;&gt; God is going to do this &gt;&gt; through you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going TO BRING YOU BACK FROM THE ENEMY. I'M GOING TO DELIVER YOU FROM YOUR SIN AND GUILT. &gt;&gt; You are greater THAN YOUR COMPLEXES. YOU ARE GREATER THAN THAT DEATH. YOU ARE GREATER THAN THAT SUICIDE. YOU ARE. THAT WAS MY BEST FRIEND. &gt;&gt; It was a deacon's wife. It was the pastor's grandson that found him. If we had more services, I could speak to you about personal things in our own lives or our family, what we've seen in the message. IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY. &gt;&gt; No one said it's going to be easy. And we AND WE CAN LAUGH AND cheer and say, "Well, we got a few more minutes, Brother John, and we're going to GET OUT OF HERE." BUT WE ALL HAVE LIFE TO GO BACK TO. AND IT'S NOT EASY. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD HIS CROSS. THE MARTYRS HAD THEIR CROSS. THEY TOOK UP THEIR CROSS AND THEY FOLLOWED JESUS. &gt;&gt; YOUNG PEOPLE BACK DURING THAT MARTYR'S TIME AND THE UNDER THAT OX ANOINTING, THEY CAME TO THE STAKE AND THEY SAID, "YOU DON'T HAVE TO TIE ME HERE. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHAIN ME HERE. I'LL STAND HERE AND GIVE MY LIFE FOR CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'M ASKING TODAY, WHERE ARE WE AT IN THE MESSAGE? &gt;&gt; WE OUGHT TO HAVE YOUNG LADIES AND YOUNG MEN WILLINGLY SAY, I GIVE MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; NOT A DADDY OR A MOMMY OR SOMEBODY IN THE THIRD ROW BACK SAYING, "YOU NEED TO GET TO THE ALTAR. YOU NEED PRAYER. YOU LET THE HOLY GHOST DO THAT." &gt;&gt; WE'VE HAD TOO MUCH IMPERSONATION AND AND PEOPLE DRAG PEOPLE THIS AND THAT. BE QUIET. YOU MAKE SURE IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; I'm using money in the bank. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm withdrawing it, too. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL RECOVER ALL, NOT PART, but inclusive &gt;&gt; yourself, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR LOVED ONES. AND THE BIBLE SAYS IN 1ST SAMUEL 30, DAVID RECOVERED ALL. &gt;&gt; VERSE 18, VERSE 19, THERE WAS NOTHING LACKING. &gt;&gt; You have A LACK THIS THIS MORNING, THIS AFTERNOON, JUST COMMIT THAT TO GOD. WHEN CHRIST ROSE ON SUNDAY, HE WAVED GOODBYE. &gt;&gt; I'm quoting out of it is the rising of the sun, paragraph 36. He rose on Easter and he waved goodbye. HE WAS THAT SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT CAME TO MATURITY. IT WAS WAVED. IT WAS A SIGN. HE WAS WAVED OVER US. THE WORD WAVED. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU LISTENING? THAT WORD AGAIN IS WAVED OVER THE PEOPLE. IT WAS THE FIRST FRUITS OF THOSE THAT SLEPT IN THE BRIDE COMING OF CHRIST. NOW HE'S TALKING IT IS THE RISING OF THE SUN IN THE BRIDE COMING OF CHRIST. 1965 I have it is the rising of the sun right here. &gt;&gt; He said I'm concerned. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT IT'S TOO MUCH OF US ARE NOT GETTING people to Christ. &gt;&gt; We're getting them to church. &gt;&gt; We're getting them TO RULES. &gt;&gt; WE FORCE OUR CHILDREN. WE WE WANT TO MAKE THEM BELIEVERS SO HARD. WE WANT THEM TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS. God's works are stronger than our works. AND EVEN THE WEAKEST OF GOD AND THE FOOLISHNESS OF GOD IS GREATER THAN MAN. &gt;&gt; There's no better hands TO COMMIT THEM TO. BUT THE LOVELY HANDS OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST THAT SHED HIS BLOOD AND GAVE HIS LIFE AND REACHED OUT HIS HANDS. HE COULD HAVE CALLED 10 THOU. I'M PREACHING UNDER INSPIRATION RIGHT NOW. COULD HAVE CALLED 10,000 ANGELS. JUST A MOVE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THE ANGELS WERE SITTING ON EVERY TREE BRANCH JUST LISTENING SAYING, "GET ME DOWN OFF OF HERE." AND IT WAS LOVE. &gt;&gt; IT WAS LOVE THAT HELD HIM THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT SAME LOVE IS IN YOU &gt;&gt; ALL THE WAY TO THE END. HE'LL GIVE YOU WISDOM. HE'LL GIVE YOU LEADERSHIP. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOT ALONE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LOOK TO YOUR NEIGHBOR AND SAY, "YOU ARE NOT ALONE." &gt;&gt; You are not alone. &gt;&gt; You're not alone. &gt;&gt; Stop talking in church. Amen. No. &gt;&gt; Just listen to the word now. Listen to the word. Page 19, Brother Brandham SAID, "IN THE BRIDE COMING OF CHRIST, THERE'LL BE A SHEATH waved again in the last days." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IN THE BRIDE AGE, SPEAKING TO HIS WIFE, PARAGRAPH 42, WHAT A RESURRECTION THAT THAT WAS. AND WHAT A RESURRECTION THIS IS. &gt;&gt; SAY 1965, WHAT A RISING OF THE SUN THAT WAS. BUT 2025, WHAT A RESURRECTION THIS HAS BEEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT A GLORY OF GOD. I SEE ON YOUR FACES. [Applause] GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; Here we are friends living in a season, living in a time. &gt;&gt; So here we have in front of us today this baton. Brother John brought it all the way from America. This is a short stick. It's a tube that is passed from one runner to another runner in a relay race. &gt;&gt; If you notice here, it's very light. It's not a Jesus said, "My yoke is easy and my burden is light." Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you notice in a relay race, and there's different relay races that you know from school and things, &gt;&gt; but I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE OLD GENERATION AND THE NEW GENERATION. The baton is in your hands. &gt;&gt; And if I HAD ANOTHER MESSAGE, I WOULD HAVE SPOKE ON trusting the new generation. Not just encouraging them, &gt;&gt; NOT JUST SUPPORTING THEM, &gt;&gt; NOT JUST LOVING THEM, NOT JUST BEING GOOD EXAMPLES or leading or guiding or sponsoring them, but trusting them. &gt;&gt; ALLOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT TO LEAD THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THE PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; He knows the calling. HE KNOWS the seed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Our services MUST BE DECLARING OUR CHURCH GATHERINGS and meetings MORE THAN JUST CURRENT POLITICS, CURRENT EVENTS, WHAT'S HAPPENING in Israel or Iran or the Pope &gt;&gt; and all the debates that go on and all the riots and all the looting and all the things that COMES IN YOUR ALGORITHMS ON YOUR news channels. ALL THE KILLING, ALL THE MURDER, ALL THE VIOLENCE HAS CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE PREPARING PEOPLE FOR A TRIBULATION ON ONE SIDE. ON THE OTHER SIDE, WE HAVE THE WORD THAT'S BEEN MOLDING AND MINISTERING AND I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU. I'LL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. &gt;&gt; You are not alone. YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT YOU GO THROUGH, NO MATTER HELL HAS BEEN THE THE THE LID HAS BEEN TAKEN OFF. &gt;&gt; WE ARE FACING HELL. WE'RE DRIVING OUT OF HERE ON THIS MONDAY. HAPPY LABOR DAY, NEW ZEALAND. BUT WE'RE FACING HELL OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, I remind you, Brother Jonathan and our wives and myself, we we'll get on airplanes in a few minutes and just one of the segments is 13 hours for me. 14. One of just one of their segments is 14 hours. JUST ONE. THEN THEY GO ANOTHER. WE CAN'T. THERE'S HOURS and hours, AIRPORTS, MONEY, THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. JUST TO BRING THREE SERVICES EACH. &gt;&gt; So this baton, there's something that is amazing. Brother David, just step up here just for a moment. So the old generation has ran their course. This is now THEIR THE LAST PART OF THE RACE. And there's something called an area in the middle here. IT'S CALLED THE TIMES OF TRANSITION. &gt;&gt; TIMES OF TRANSITION FROM THE OLDER GENERATION to the new generation. &gt;&gt; AND SO THE NEW GENERATION, they they WAIT IN THIS AREA WITH LIKE THIS WITH THEIR HANDS OUT. ARE YOU watching back here? Israel or David? &gt;&gt; David. David. AND YOU'RE READY LIKE THIS. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING BACK. YOU'RE NOT. BUT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON YOUR PART OF THE RACE. &gt;&gt; So can your posture just get in that? Just this hand. Yes. That hand back. Open. Open up wide. Yep. AND HERE I'VE COME. WE'VE HAD A GENERATION THAT'S GONE BEFORE US. WILLIAM BRANDHAM. OUR P MANY PASTORS AND LEADERS, CHURCHES IN NEW ZEALAND HAVE RUN THEIR COURSE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE COMING AND THEY'RE SWEATY AND THEY'RE TIRED AND THEY'RE WEARY AND AND OUR DUTY IS TO JUST PASS THIS RIGHT INTO THEIR HAND. AND NOW YOU RUN, BROTHER DAVID. YOU GO. [Applause] Is that is that light? It's not a heavy load. I didn't give you some big brick or log, did I? Let's do it one more time quickly. So, here I've RAN MY COURSE. I'VE HAD MY SONG LEADING. IT'S TIME FOR SOME OF US TO HAND OVER THE SONG LEADING, the preaching, BEING A DEACON &gt;&gt; TO THE NEW GENERATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The transition has been a failure in a lot of places in the message. And they run around and they just want to do it better. That can do it better. You're I see that you're not ready for that. You're this and and that's they just want to run. The old generation wants to keep running till they die. Till they JUST FALL INTO THE I'LL DIE WITH MY BOOTS ON. THEY SAY, &gt;&gt; "OH, come on." &gt;&gt; They feel like if they'd ever retire, that they're letting down on God when really it's a failure to have trust &gt;&gt; that the same God that led me And now I'm running. I'm running. And brother David and And he just reaches behind and he just runs and and the baton is passed. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; But one of the worst THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IS THE DROPPING OF THE BATON. &gt;&gt; YOU COULD BE FASTER. &gt;&gt; You could be better. &gt;&gt; You could be stronger. &gt;&gt; You could have more money. You could look better. BUT TO DROP THE BATON. AND I WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION HERE IN NEW Zealand as WE PASS THE BATON TO THE NEW GENERATION. HOW are we doing? &gt;&gt; The last message before we all go home from the family camp as individuals, as families, as a church within the message locally and globally. How are we doing in passing that baton? Then h how the older generation is passing. How are we doing? But then the new generation, how are you doing in receiving? &gt;&gt; This is one of the biggest complaints against the new generation and that is a lack of character. They feel entitled. They just feel like it's going to happen overnight. It's going to be easy. And the old generation sees that lack of fiber and lack of character. So they want to keep the baton. But we must trust the new generation. &gt;&gt; We must nurture them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory &gt;&gt; into THEIR SPIRITUAL ADOPTION, &gt;&gt; ALLOWING THEM TO FLEX THEIR EAGLE WINGS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THE OLD GENERATION. NOW, THIS TAKES CHARACTER AND MATURITY FROM THE BOTH OF THE GENERATIONS. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION QUICKLY. ARE YOU WILLING TO GROW WITH OTHERS &gt;&gt; INTO THE CAPSTONE? &gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE DIFFERENT DIFFERENCES OF ADMINISTRATION. PAUL SAID IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12, there are diversities. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Psalm 78:1-4, the Bible talks about how that we are to show to THE GENERATION TO COME THE PRAISES OF THE Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the negative, &gt;&gt; NOT CHURCH POLITICS, NOT FAMILY FAVORITISM. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; We have family churches in the message and they just pass it off to their son or their grandson. Sometimes there's another brother or another gift in the church that's actually a better pastoral or way with the people. People because they're so tied into money and their legacy and their name. &gt;&gt; God help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; And then PEOPLE BEGIN TO GIVE UNRIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT AND TAINTED WISDOM BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT. IT'S AMAZING HOW PEOPLE WILL QUICKLY FORGIVE PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN FAMILY. That's my friend. But if it's another CHURCH OR ANOTHER GROUP, THEY'LL QUICKLY EX them out. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you don't have that in New Zealand. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT TO KEEP PUTTING A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. THERE OUGHT TO BE MORE WISDOM, &gt;&gt; NOT SARCASM. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE'S VERY CLEAR IN PSALM 78. SHOW THE GENERATION TO COME THE PRAISES OF the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works. &gt;&gt; We are not TO CREATE A PARTY SPIRIT ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; We're passing through Leodysia. WE ARE NOT PART OF LEODYSIA. WE'RE NOT TO JUST PASS OFF LEGALISM AND UNBALANCED TEACHING AND DOMINATING FAMILY STRAINS. WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. that we WOULD GIVE THE NEW generation as Psalm 78:5 that WE WOULD MAKE THESE THINGS KNOWN TO THEIR CHILDREN THAT VERSE 6 THE GENERATION TO COME MIGHT KNOW THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN THAT'S YOUR GRANDCHILDREN THAT THEY MIGHT SET THEIR HOPE IN THE LORD ARE YOU AWAKE THIS THIS MORNING &gt;&gt; SET YOUR HOPE IN THE LORD MY HOPE IS IN THE LORD &gt;&gt; NOT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS NOT HOLLYWOOD NOT AI AI IS NOT OUR LEADER. THE HOLY GHOST IS OUR LEADER. &gt;&gt; NOT THEIR DEGREES OR CERTIFICATES OR THEIR NATIONAL SPIRIT OR PRIME MINISTER. OUR HOPE IS IN THE LORD. NOT IN BUSINESS. NOT IN BUSINESS. NOT IN THE ECONOMY. NOT IN THE STOCK MARKET. IT IS NOT IN OUR HUMAN FRIENDSHIPS OR OUR RELATIONSHIPS. PEOPLE WILL FAIL YOU. CHURCHES WILL FAIL YOU. MINISTRY WILL FAIL YOU. BUT JESUS NEVER FAILS. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, HE HAS NEVER FAILED YOU. &gt;&gt; HE HAS NEVER FAILED YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother John's 53 years old. My wife's birthday is a few days. She'll be 54. I married an older lady. Amen. She'll take care of you better. BUT WE COULD WE'VE SAW SO MUCH IN OUR LIFETIME TRAVELING FROM AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, AND living in America, and this church and that church and all that WE'VE SEEN IN THE MESSAGE. BUT OUR HOPE IS IN THE LORD. WHEN YOU'RE AROUND BROTHER JOHN OR SISTER SHARON, WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF NEGATIVE TALKERS and slanderers. &gt;&gt; I I I JUST CHALLENGE YOU WHEN YOU'VE BEEN AROUND BROTHER JONATHAN MARTIN OR HIS WIFE. HAS ANY OF YOU HEARD JUST GONE ON AND ON AND ON ABOUT THIS CHURCH, that church, THIS DOCTRINE, THAT THIS NO, IT'S POSITIVE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THEN IT'S NOT JUST IN WILLIAM BRHAM. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST IN JESUS WHEN HE WALKED IN EARTH. IT'S NOT JUST IN MOODY AND FINNY AND ALL THESE GREAT PRE. IT'S NOT. IT'S IN THE WORD FOR YOUR DAY. &gt;&gt; WE ARE 2025, MY FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LOOKING BACK. &gt;&gt; Brother John has sought to allow this type of atmosphere to be in the meetings. Not reaching down, not just always, you know, LOOKING DOWN ON PEOPLE. And and from the old generation to the new generation, there ought to be a respect. &gt;&gt; I ran my course. I I'M DOING WHAT I CAN. I I DON'T HAVE IT ALL. I CAN'T MEET ALL YOUR NEEDS. AND I'M SORRY FINANCIALLY. If you would counsel or want A WORD WITH SOMEONE, WE'RE NOT A PROPHET OR BROTHER JONATHAN SAID SONS OF A PROPHET. BUT IF YOU LOOK IN THE SCRIPTURE, A LOT OF PROPHETS FAMILIES RAN INTO TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; SO STOP ASPIRING TO BE A SON OF A PROPHET, TO PROPHESY, TO HAVE DREAMS. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS ONE MAN THAT WANTED TO HAVE DREAM. OH, I WISH I COULD HAVE A VISION. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham reached his hand over on his shoulder and say, "Every time you open your Bible, you see a vision." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; What are YOU LOOKING FOR? WHAT DO YOU WANT OUT OF CHURCH? &gt;&gt; SAY, "I WANT A CHURCH FULL OF PERFECT PEOPLE." WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT. THERE'S NO CHURCH PERFECT IN NEW ZEALAND. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, SOME OF YOU STREAM FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT IS OFFENDED WHEN WE MAKE MEN OUR SUPERSTARS. HE'S OFFENDED WHEN WE PUT THOSE THINGS ABOVE HIM. AND HE WILL CRASH DOWN YOUR KINGDOM. HE WILL HUMBLE AND BREAK YOU FOR YOU TO LOOK UP TO SEEK HIM. &gt;&gt; We need to take care. Our revival IS NOT THE CHURCH BARBECUE. &gt;&gt; Every generation deserves their chance AT THE WORD. OUR REVIVAL IS NOT A CHURCH SOFTBALL TEAM. IT'S NOT A POLITICAL PARTY THAT we finally GET IN OFFICE THAT'S more conservative and we say, "HALLELUJAH." NO, IT'S NOT ALL HALLELUJAH. EVERY COUNTRY, EVERY NATION IS CONTROLLED BY THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; OUR REVIVAL IS NOT RELIGION. OUR REVIVAL IS NOT A SLOGAN OR A CERTAIN CHANT OR CERTAIN QUOTES, HIT QUOTES THAT WE JUST SAY OUT AND THEN HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. [Music] &gt;&gt; OUR REVIVAL IS NOT OUR HEALTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Some of you are healthy and strong RIGHT NOW. SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN BEFORE YOU GET HOME, BEFORE I GET HOME. &gt;&gt; And in less THAN ONE WEEK, &gt;&gt; YOU COULD BE PUT DOWN INTO THE GROUND. AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL BODY AND YOUR STRONG MUSCLES, THE SKIN WORMS THAT'S ALREADY IN YOU WOULD HAVE ALREADY ATE IT UP IN ONE WEEK. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST JUST NOTHING BUT ASHES. &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE SO GREAT. WE'RE SO BIG. NO, YOU'RE NOT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God will break you. You start thinking like that. Say, "I'LL LIVE LIKE THE WORLD. I'LL ACT LIKE THE WORLD. AIN'T my earring so beautiful? Ain't this makeup MAKE ME? ISN'T THIS TATTOO so nice?" &gt;&gt; NO, YOU'RE JUST MARKING YOURSELF LIKE THE WORLD MARKS THEMSELVES. &gt;&gt; MY HOW THE WORLD WANTED TO MARK US. &gt;&gt; BUT HOW GOD WANTS TO MARK US. &gt;&gt; HOW HE WANTS TO IMPRINT HIS NATURE UPON OUR HEART. &gt;&gt; SAY, "I want another book of Acts. I want another book of Acts." Well, in the book of Acts, there was struggle. THERE WERE FIGHTING. &gt;&gt; BROTHERS COULDN'T HARDLY AGREE. There were THINGS GOING ON. A REVIVAL IS NOT HAVING A BOYFRIEND OR A GIRLFRIEND. &gt;&gt; THE REVIVAL THAT THE BRIDE NEEDS IS NOT MUSIC &gt;&gt; or building a new church. &gt;&gt; THE REVIVAL IN THE NEW ARE WE DOING OKAY? IN THE NEW GENERATION WILL BE A BORNAGAIN EXPERIENCE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, WALKING IN THEIR OWN PERSONAL ADOPTION, WHICH IS MATURITY AS THEY COME TO THE HEADSTONE AND AS THEY NEAR HIM AND HE CUTS OFF ALL THE THINGS THAT'S NOT LIKE HIM AND THE STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN IN THEIR PERSONAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; NOT MY CHURCH BELIEVES THIS, MY MOMMY BELIEVES THIS, MY THAT'S A BUNCH OF NONSENSE. Your revelation is being reflected in your life. WHAT YOU DO THIS NEXT WEEK AND IN THE WEEKS TO FOLLOW SHOW WHETHER YOU REALLY CAUGHT THE WORD OR NOT. &gt;&gt; Are we getting one another's spirit or are we getting the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; I have a whole page of quotes on the old fighters. Brother Renham said get away from the old fighters disposition. All the old fighters is gone now. But your sword, put your sword back in its sheath. &gt;&gt; He's talking about fighting. They fought. They fought. THEY FOUGHT. PUT YOUR SWORD BACK IN ITS SHEATH. &gt;&gt; He said it would be the sons of the old fighters. These fellows are not fighters. THE NEW GROUP, YOU can just just go look IT UP. THESE FELLAS ARE NOT FIGHTERS. THE NEW GROUP WASN'T FIGHTERS. HE LET ALL THE OLD FIGHTERS DIE OFF. In another PLACE, HE SAID, "WE'RE READY TO DO IT WHEN YOU sons of the old fighters get together." &gt;&gt; Brother John has sought to bring this over the years that we've been with you. Here's a good scripture for us. Hebrews 4:12. For the word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing aunderder of soul and spirit and joints in the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. It's 11:51 as we go to each one of you personally. I just want to have you personally in a room. He is our daily bread. &gt;&gt; WE SPEAK ABOUT DAILY BREAD. I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE on keto, Tito, wheat free, dairy free, carnivore, hunore, whatever diets. I'm not speaking negatively about it. I'm just talking about he is our daily bread &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit is the shepherd to feed you sheep food from this word. &gt;&gt; Let's all finish strong today. You can say amen as we go. THE HOLY SPIRIT IS THE SHEPHERD TO FEED YOU SHEEP FOOD. &gt;&gt; IT ALWAYS COMES BY THE SHEPHERD. He is our shepherd. &gt;&gt; Listen to him. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE SHEEP OF HIS FOE. &gt;&gt; If you are, you hear HIS VOICE, &gt;&gt; NOT WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE SAYS. YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAYS. &gt;&gt; A STRANGE VOICE YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; DO WE HAVE THE HOLY GHOST? DO WE HAVE THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; THEY THAT ARE THE SONS OF GOD ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; If you're A DAUGHTER OF GOD, YOU ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; A CREED IS ALL RIGHT, BUT IT JUST DOESN'T SATISFY TILL YOU GET DOWN TO THE WORD. MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE, BUT EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDTH OUT OF THE MOUTH of God. WE'RE GOING TO EAT LUNCH. MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVE TO GO BEFORE LUNCH. BUT WE LIVE NOT BY JUST THE NATURAL FOOD THAT WE EAT OR THE DRINKS THAT WE DRINK. WE LIVE BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND LORD, GIVE US REVELATION MORE THAN EVER AS WE LEAVE THIS CAMP, LORD, IN OUR DEVOTIONS, IN OUR HOMES, IN OUR CHURCHES. MAY THERE BE A FRESH BAPTISM. &gt;&gt; I'M ASKING YOU, LORD, BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS PLACE, THAT'S WHAT WE LIVE BY. THE WORD OF GOD IS A MAN'S SPIRITUAL DAILY BREAD. &gt;&gt; If you want to mark down this scripture, this is incredible SCRIPTURE. I HAVE THIS MESSAGE proving his word right HERE IN THESE FEW VERSES. YOU HAVE THE OLD GENERATION AND THE NEW GENERATION. YOU HAVE A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL, GYRUS'S DAUGHTER, THAT PASSES AWAY. YOU HAVE A ONE THAT'S SENIOR going through midlife and and her cycle is ending. She's going through a menopause, AN ISSUE WITH BLOOD. AND THE BIBLE SAYS SHE HAD IT FOR 12 YEARS. &gt;&gt; SO THE VERY YEAR THAT A YOUNG PERSON WAS BORN, A SISTER STARTED TO HAVE TROUBLE. And then THE 12YEAR-OLD GIRL, SHE GREW AND SHE DIED. You say, "All hope IS GONE. THE SITUATION'S DEAD." BROTHER JOHN, THERE'S NO LIFE. THERE'S NO LOVE. THERE'S NO FEELING. THERE'S NOTHING ANYMORE. AND HE'S DEAD IN A TOMB. AND THEY ALL BEGIN TO WHAIL AND CRY. JESUS PUT THEM ALL OUT. SAID, "I CAN'T HAVE UNBELIEF AROUND ME. I JUST WANT BELIEVERS THAT'LL TAKE ME OUT BY WORD." &gt;&gt; YOU ALL KNOW THE STORY. HE RAISED HER UP. &gt;&gt; AND THE WOMAN THAT TOUCHED THE BORDER OF HIS GARMENT WAS CLEANSED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; FROM THAT VERY MOMENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; No matter what you're going through, the promises of the word are true. YAY. AND AMEN. I SHALL BE CHANGED &gt;&gt; IN A MOMENT, IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE. COMFORT ONE ANOTHER WITH THESE WORDS. IT'S THE COMING OF THE LORD. WE'VE APPE WE'VE RECEIVED THE SHOUT. THE SHOUT IS A MESSAGE TO GATHER US ALL TOGETHER. THAT IS THE BRIDE'S REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; In 1 John 4:4, greater is he that is in you THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BRIDE OF CHRIST. WHAT COMES INTO YOUR MIND WHEN you see THESE PICTURES? BROTHER JOHN BROUGHT IT ALL THE WAY TO TO JUST LET IT BE AN EXAMPLE IN FRONT OF YOU. WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET YOUR ATTENTION ON CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WHETHER IT'S BY DEMONSTRATION, WHETHER IT'S BY TESTIMONY, WHETHER IT'S BY POWERPOINT, WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING PHYSICAL, BUT NOW IT'S IN YOUR HANDS. &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO GO. MY WIFE'S GOT TO GO. BROTHER JONATHAN'S GOING TO GO, SISTER LO, BUT YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF NEW ZEALAND. &gt;&gt; RECEIVE THE BATON. THE BATON IS IN YOUR HAND. THE BIBLE SAYS IN EXODUS 4, THE LORD SAID UNTO HIM, "WHAT IS THAT IN THY HAND?" &gt;&gt; AND HERE WE HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD FOR OUR DAY. THE OPENING OF THE SEALS IS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THE SEVEN CHURCH AGES WAS THE FEMALE. THE SEVEN SEALS IS THE MALE. THERE'S BEEN AN INVISIBLE UNION. THERE'S BEEN A PASSING OF THE BATON. THERE'S A RECEIVING OF THE BATON. I HAVE IT IN MY HANDS. &gt;&gt; I thank God for faithful MEN AND WOMEN THAT'S GONE BEFORE US, BUT THE BATON IS IN MY HANDS. &gt;&gt; And Lord, help us not to DROP IT. HELP US, LORD. IN THE NATURAL, IT LOOKS LIKE THIS, BUT IN THE SPIRITUAL, WE'VE RECEIVED THE GOSPEL MESSAGE. HELP US NOW TO CLOSE. IT'S THE WORD FOR OUR AGE. IT'S THE MESSENGER THAT'S PASSED IT INTO YOUR HANDS. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECEIVED IT AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO RUN. &gt;&gt; TO PASS IT IS A RESPONSIBILITY. TO RECEIVE IT IS a responsibility. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT IN TIMES OF TRANSITION AND AT JUNCTIONS OF TIME ARE SO CRUCIAL. IT'S BEEN A PROBLEM OF EVERY AGE. LET'S STAND TO OUR FEET. WE HAVE COME TO THE END. WE HAVE COME TO THE END. And 2025 is not 1965. &gt;&gt; There's been a rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; I'm on my last slide there. In the name of Jesus. When he said you are his victory, then you're not defeated. &gt;&gt; You're not a backslider. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might have went through this whole week and not have felt anything. You might be going home saying,"Lord, I'm nervous. I'm I'm shaking. I don't even know what's going to happen when I get home. I don't even know what's going to happen in my job. What's going to happen in my marriage?" You might be a miserable failure as a spouse. YOU MIGHT BE A YOUNG PERSON THAT SAYS, "BROTHER JOHN, I'm hearing all you're saying. BROTHER JONATHAN, I LOVE YOU, &gt;&gt; but you don't know me. You don't know what we go through here in New Zealand, but there's one that knows everything. &gt;&gt; He knows the future as much as he knows the past. &gt;&gt; He sends DIVINE GIFTS LIKE YOU'VE HAD THIS weekend to show his love for you. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. I thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Take our feeble efforts. Let's lay hands on one another. Take our feeble efforts. Take our efforts, Lord. As we go, as we say goodbye, Heavenly Father, as our musician, come and our song leader, Brother Ben, come. Lord, may the Holy Spirit take this group of people into your loving care, we commit them to you, Lord, for the future. Whatever comes before them, whatever lies ahead, may the blessing of God be upon them. May the word of God grow, be stronger than ever. May the fog leave. May demon spirits leave.

Thank you so much. There's lunch soon. Just remember to clean your rooms, all those things. There should be instructions on your door before you leave. But we love you so much. Thank you for making allowing the Lord to live through you to make this camp such a success. So, God bless you. &gt;&gt; I know someone said it before, but &gt;&gt; No. Well, no. I just It's just uh like how would I describe this? Like you you have both given up a lot to to to do this. You've essentially given up your life really to for the work of the Lord. Like I I don't and I mean that cuz I I know what your life is and I know you've given up the what could be to serve the Lord, you know, and that's a real servant of God. and and and you'd think, you know, if you do that, then the Lord will make it easy for you, you know, and then they go they on top of that, they tend to go through all the stuff year after year and just battle. But it's it really is inspiring to all of us like like Yeah, we we are all inspired by it. We we we really appreciate it. We really do like Yeah. And Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah. And just Yeah. And we I just we just I just really want to honor you and everyone here does, you know, we we honor you and we we we appreciate you. We appreciate the Lord giving you to us and we we appreciate the gift that he's put in your life &gt;&gt; and we respect it and and may it just continue to grow because it's bearing a lot of fruit. &gt;&gt; So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We you all honor and respect them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know you do. Praise the Lord, too. I I meant that. That wasn't just lip service. I mean that from my heart. The Lord knows I've never there's never been a bad word or a bad thought in my mind about these two in my existence. And on the day of judgment, my thoughts will play back and you'll see that's the truth because I know that they're called of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and and you know, when you Yeah. It's just it's good to value servants. You got to value everyone. And then it says, "But those that are work for the Lord are worthy of double honor." So it's Yeah. Good little tip in life. Yes. Um say, just one other thing. So there's a after this um there's the our there's the um get after party at the pizza factory. Um we've got like there's like all sorts of stuff there. There's like pizzas. No, I think I should say there's burgers. If I say there's burgers, cuz we do pizza, burgers, Mexican and stuff, but if I say there's going to be something, then everyone's going to expect it. So, the people that are making it will have to make it cuz they don't want to make it. They just want to make pizzas cuz it's easy. But who wants like Do you guys like burgers? Wow. It's pretty much the majority, I think. Was that? So, I'm not going to I'm landing people in it, but I won't actually be there. I have to drive to Oakland Basically after this um because I got to be in Oakuckland early in the morning. But, um Hannah, stand up over there, Hannah. So, this is Hannah. And also, this is this is Jesse. So, and there'll be a few other people there and different ones are going to be helping out and things. So, they will Yeah. If you need anything when you're there, they will be they will look after you and it doesn't cost you anything. Okay? So, you don't have to pay for anything. Um, but I don't I don't just want to say, "Oh, yeah. Um, look how good I am." Like, I don't mean it like that. the way we do it here. But I've also learned in my Christian walk that you also it's a bit selfish to not give people opportunity as well, you know, cuz I think oh no, I'll keep you all the opportunity for me to you give to me and I'm this look how great I am, you know. So, so I'm Hannah doesn't know I'm going to do this. But like if you do want to give anything, you can just go and see Hannah. She can swipe it and do do whatever. So there's the two-way thing. If you want to, you can. If you don't want to, you don't have to. Like we there's a blessing either way. Don't matter which way it falls. There's a blessing. It doesn't. Okay? But there's no obligation, no nothing. Just turn up. It's a great time. We got about 100 seats orund something. There's room for everyone there. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; No, that wasn't a call for money. Okay. The Lord. But I just I've learned that in life, you know, you just you got just when you give it over to the Lord, he does what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; So So yeah, I don't I don't want to I don't want to rob We don't want to cuz brother used to say, "No, no, don't do But then he learned I'm robbing people of an opportunity that the Lord wanted to bless them and he wanted them to do it so he could bless them. So yeah, that um so there was a song that came on my mind. I thought, what's what's a closing song we could do to sort of encapsulate the the end of the service? And a little song came up. You might know this one. Can you bring this song up? Who knows this song? I thought it was quite fitting. I was like, "Oh, that song. It's not by might, not by power, by my spirit, sayeth the Lord." than the first two. This mountain shall be removed. So, wow, that fits. So, let's um so let's stand up and let's um just sing this song here. Who knows the song? A few people know it. Yeah. Oh, great. Okay, let's let's let's sing this song a time or two and then we'll just um dismiss in prayer. &gt;&gt; I think it's G. Well, here's a test. Young musicians never You didn't even know this song, did you? We're going to do it in front. We'll go a It's not by might, not by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. Not by might, not by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. Oh, this mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed by my spirit says not by might nor by my spirit saith the Lord. Not by might, not by might, not by how my spirit say the Lord. For this mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed by my spirit. Listen one last time. Not by might, not by might. Not my power, but by my spirit, say the Lord. Not by might, not my power, but by my spirit, say the Lord. Oh yes. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed by my spirit, said the Lord. Amen.
