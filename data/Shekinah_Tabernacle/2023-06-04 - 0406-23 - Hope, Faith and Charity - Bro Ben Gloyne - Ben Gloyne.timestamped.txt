[9:01] it's good to be here this morning
[9:03] welcome everyone to the house of God and
[9:05] to this very hello Chris good to see you
[9:09] to this very uh special occasion which
[9:12] is our church anniversary weekend
[9:16] and you know the Lord has been really
[9:18] good to us over the last and we only
[9:21] live in
[9:21] we are yeah yeah 11 years
[9:25] um it's been
[9:27] it's been a journey upwards
[9:30] there's been no downwards everyone has
[9:32] gone upwards in their faith in their in
[9:34] their walk with the Lord and their and
[9:37] and everything that the Lord would want
[9:38] for us I believe that each person that
[9:40] has come under the ministry
[9:42] here and the the and being involved in
[9:44] the body of Christ has moved
[9:47] upward well I have anyway so I'm just
[9:50] going to say we all have
[9:52] have you
[9:54] good okay I'm telling the truth then
[9:58] because that's the way the Lord does
[10:00] things you know his his kingdom grows
[10:03] sometimes it doesn't grow as fast as
[10:04] what we want you know because when you
[10:05] look at these flowers they didn't turn
[10:07] up in a day
[10:08] they take a while to grow God's ways are
[10:10] not really there's no sort of quick way
[10:13] get rich quick sort of scheme it's just
[10:15] it's just solid growth in the Lord
[10:17] um that's that's the way the Lord does
[10:19] it when we look at nature that's how he
[10:20] does nature you know Satan tears down
[10:22] quickly Satan can tears think things
[10:24] down and in months he can tear something
[10:26] down that takes years and years to build
[10:28] but thank God that he's a wise master
[10:30] builder
[10:31] um I just had a scripture that I that it
[10:34] just came to my mind as I was thinking
[10:37] about these services
[10:38] and
[10:40] um
[10:40] from Ephesians 4 verses 11 and 12 and
[10:44] 13.
[10:46] because this Gathering has not been a
[10:48] natural Gathering where we just meet
[10:50] together this isn't a club you know
[10:51] where we've we're enrolled in some club
[10:53] and we just
[10:55] Gathering naturally but this is a
[10:57] supernatural Gathering
[10:59] with Supernatural things happening
[11:03] that we can't see but that we we accept
[11:06] by faith and that heaven have an impact
[11:08] and it and change our lives in ways that
[11:10] even that we can see naturally and
[11:14] manifest in our life but there's there's
[11:16] a supernatural element and that is
[11:17] Ephesians 4 11 says and he himself which
[11:21] is the lord gave
[11:23] gave to us
[11:26] some Apostles some prophets some
[11:28] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[11:30] this is a supernatural thing now it's
[11:32] not just a natural I'll just go Rosen
[11:34] I'll take the job it's God gave that
[11:37] gift to somebody and then they the Lord
[11:40] directs them to end up in a place and
[11:42] then Minister that gift so it's a
[11:43] supernatural
[11:45] next one next verse for the perfecting
[11:48] of the Saints
[11:49] for the work of the ministry for the
[11:52] edifying of the body of Christ so this
[11:54] is happening
[11:55] now it's manifest in our life as we've
[11:57] seen it over the years but this is the
[11:59] this is not a club this is a
[12:00] supernatural thing happening
[12:02] next verse
[12:04] till we all come all
[12:08] and the unity of the faith and of the
[12:10] knowledge of the Son of God and to a
[12:12] perfect
[12:13] person
[12:15] male or female
[12:17] and to the measure of the stature of the
[12:19] fullness of Christ
[12:21] so for the last 11 years this is what's
[12:23] been happening
[12:24] and it's gonna it's happened yesterday
[12:27] it's going to happen today and will
[12:28] happen tomorrow it's going to keep on
[12:30] happening praise the Lord
[12:32] let some stand and we'll just commit the
[12:34] service to the Lord this morning and
[12:35] just have a have a good time in the Lord
[12:37] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you so
[12:38] much that you have been with us on this
[12:41] journey Lord as we've walked this walk
[12:43] with you
[12:45] and this Fellowship Lord that I that has
[12:47] a special place in my heart Lord because
[12:49] I can see your gifts Lord that have

[13:12] let them minister to our life Lord so I
[13:14] just thank you so much Lord for the

[51:36] after six days Jesus taketh Peter James
[51:38] and John his brother and bringeth them
[51:39] up into a high mountain apart and was
[51:42] transfigured before them and his face
[51:44] should shine as the sun as Raymond was
[51:46] white as as the light and behold they're
[51:48] appeared unto him Moses and Elias
[51:50] talking with them then answered Peter
[51:52] and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for
[51:54] us to be here if thou Wilt let us make
[51:56] here three Tabernacles one for thee one
[51:58] for Moses one for Elias while he yet
[52:01] spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed
[52:03] them and behold a voice out of the cloud
[52:05] which said this is my beloved Son in
[52:08] whom I'm well pleased hear ye him and
[52:10] when the disciples heard it they fell on
[52:12] their face and were sore afraid and
[52:15] Jesus came and touched him and said
[52:16] arise Be not Afraid and when they had
[52:18] lifted up the rise they saw no man save
[52:21] Jesus only that's what we want we want
[52:24] to have a mount Transfiguration
[52:25] experience this morning amen when we see
[52:28] Jesus only amen let's just bow heads in
[52:30] a word of prayer amen if you ever need
[52:32] you want to raise your hand to the Lord
[52:33] and you're glad he knows all about our
[52:35] life not one of us are forgotten amen
[52:37] not one of us are put to one side he
[52:39] knows everything we're going through and
[52:40] he's mindful of every situation amen so
[52:43] let's pray together gracious father
[52:44] we're so thankful we can sing Hosanna oh
[52:47] Lord we praise the Lamb that will slain
[52:49] but Lord You're Alive forevermore we're
[52:51] so thankful Lord you took our sins upon
[52:53] your shoulders went up Calvary Lord now
[52:56] them to your cross Lord you separated
[52:57] our sins from us as far as the East is
[52:59] from the West we're so thankful for that
[53:01] dear God we're so glad we can gather
[53:03] together Lord Jesus with Saints of like
[53:05] Precious Faith Lord father we want to
[53:07] ask Lord may your anointing fall on each
[53:09] Heart Lord may he touch each life dear

[53:31] today may have your way dear God may you
[53:33] be glorified now mitz father and Lord I
[53:35] just want to remember those who couldn't
[53:36] be here today because of sickness father
[53:38] Lord may he touch their bodies and be
[53:40] with them Lord be their portion Lord

[53:46] them too father we love you Lord we
[53:48] commit the service into your hands may
[53:50] take preeminence now dear God in Jesus
[53:52] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[53:55] friends you may have your seats this
[53:57] morning so I want to talk about hope
[53:58] faith and charity I mean you've got to
[54:00] take hope faith and charity and then
[54:02] you'll see Jesus Christ glorified amen
[54:04] because that's what we want to do this
[54:06] morning that's what we want to see in
[54:07] our lives is Jesus Christ glorified amen
[54:09] not a man glorified not a church
[54:11] glorified but Jesus Christ himself the
[54:14] word glorifying so it's very important
[54:16] you know you're showing us here in
[54:19] Matthew that you know if you want to as
[54:21] we're ascending up the mountain yeah
[54:23] we're going up Mountain Zion we're going
[54:24] on our way to a translation of the body
[54:27] we know we're living in a Rapture cycle
[54:28] but if you want to see Jesus Christ
[54:30] glorified you need hope faith and
[54:32] charity amen says the main thing see but
[54:35] see we do this one thing when they
[54:36] looked around this is speaking of the
[54:38] Apostles where you know with all the
[54:40] power upon him they saw Jesus only and
[54:42] the true real believer don't care
[54:43] whether he's backing up a denomination
[54:45] or nothing about it he only wants one
[54:47] thing
[54:48] for you to see that glorified Christ
[54:50] makes any difference a real true Mount
[54:53] Transfiguration experience only
[54:54] glorifies Jesus Christ it didn't glorify
[54:57] Moses didn't glorify Elijah didn't
[54:59] glorify themselves didn't glorify
[55:01] nothing else but they send the glorified
[55:03] Christ and any True Believer that's
[55:04] what's in his heart to glorify Jesus
[55:06] Christ that's what he's trying to get
[55:08] the people to see see we're not here to
[55:10] try and glorify a gift amen or even a
[55:13] Ministry we're here to glorify Jesus
[55:14] Christ the word that's our host desire
[55:16] this morning we're not trying to point
[55:18] fingers to any person amen but the
[55:20] person I mean that's what we want is to
[55:23] see him glorified in our lives I'm going
[55:25] to emphasize that quite a lot today
[55:26] because man have risen up church has
[55:28] risen up people have risen up influences
[55:30] have risen up they want to glorify
[55:32] themselves but we're not here to do that
[55:34] we're here to glorify the word and
[55:36] because he's the king of kings and Lord
[55:38] of lords and I trust this morning he's
[55:40] your king amen he's not just your savior
[55:42] but he's your Lord he's your all in all
[55:45] amen see oh the CC Peter James and John
[55:48] represented hope faith and charity
[55:51] see when he taken Peter James and John
[55:52] hope faith and charity don't you see
[55:54] those gifted people them through hope
[55:56] faith and charity Hope was in James he
[55:58] was the one who set the church in order
[55:59] Faith was in Peter and charity was in
[56:01] John hope faith and charity and that's
[56:03] God's Representatives on the earth so
[56:06] you need all three Amen to see God live
[56:09] to see him glorified Hallelujah and yeah
[56:11] I'm trust by the end of the service you
[56:13] go rejoicing saying you have all three
[56:15] right this is not like you get the Holy
[56:16] Ghost and you've got to get Faith in
[56:18] charity and hope that's not how it works
[56:20] but you know so you see we need all
[56:22] three for God too God to move because if
[56:24] you just have a Burly Faith you can
[56:26] damage people your influence can be
[56:28] ruined among the people so you've got to
[56:29] have all three amen for Christ to be
[56:31] glorified see many people say they've
[56:33] got all the faith but if they don't have
[56:35] charity amen then some people can have a
[56:37] real Bulldog Faith they can just be you
[56:39] know grab it by the horns and here we go
[56:41] I believe listen you know real dogmatic
[56:43] and if you don't see it my way you're
[56:45] going no way you know you're not you're
[56:47] not going to be there that's how some
[56:48] people get in their mind but you know
[56:50] you can ruin your own influence before
[56:51] the people I say you're going to ruin
[56:53] the influence of the glorified Christ
[56:55] among the people if you just got barely
[56:57] Faith with no love with it see we don't
[57:00] just need faith we need love and hope
[57:02] with that amen we need all three to
[57:04] manifest I think that's the only way
[57:06] Christ will be glorified see we've gone
[57:08] well past the day of just quoting
[57:10] scriptures and quoting quotes and having
[57:11] Church order we all need those things
[57:13] we're going to beyond that amen but
[57:15] Christ has put on flesh in our day I
[57:17] mean he's living in a people right now I
[57:19] mean the bride of Christ has been adored
[57:21] with the winning gown the baptism of the
[57:23] Holy Ghost amen it's more than just
[57:24] talking quotes and just you know arguing
[57:27] and fussing and fighting those days are
[57:28] over that dispensation is gone now
[57:31] Christ has come Amen to to anoint his
[57:34] people to manifest his word out of their
[57:36] lives see this is not an argument we're
[57:38] not here to debate things we're not here
[57:39] to have a collection of arguments
[57:40] Systematic Theology Systematic Theology
[57:43] is just putting it making it make that
[57:45] it sounds that it makes sense this
[57:46] message is going to more than just make
[57:48] sense to you I mean the Bible's got to
[57:49] be more than just something to make
[57:50] sense it's because of tradition many
[57:52] people say it makes sense but you're
[57:54] going to go beyond that amen that you
[57:55] see Jesus Christ alive in your life this
[57:58] is very important we need the anointing
[58:00] of God more than ever in this day they
[58:02] needed it All Through the Ages but it's
[58:04] this day we need is anointing up on our
[58:05] lives because the devil's anointing this
[58:08] world but Christ is anointing his bride
[58:10] aiming to overcome every obstacle amen
[58:12] so we can have real Burly Faith but no
[58:15] love with it you'll ruin your influence
[58:18] before the people if you haven't got
[58:19] love mixed with it see you've seen
[58:21] people real Burly you know it's like
[58:22] people used to say you know we're Eagles
[58:24] now Eagles are Terrors of the beak and
[58:26] they just have all the quotes and the
[58:28] belt buckles and all the things and they
[58:29] just say you know they just fuss and
[58:30] fight oh we're eagles they may have
[58:32] Eagle Faith they don't have Eagle love
[58:34] they don't have the love of the dove in
[58:36] their hearts amen but really that's just
[58:38] actually to me a lot of that is actually
[58:39] just human Faith you know it's like
[58:41] Peter without any discernment cutting
[58:43] off people's ears trying to stand for
[58:44] the word and you know it may look good
[58:46] on the outside but it just ruined you
[58:48] know you just ended up a great failure
[58:51] but thank God even though in his failure
[58:53] Jesus didn't forget him and you know
[58:54] many times we can fail trying to be a
[58:56] witness but Jesus didn't forget you I
[58:58] mean you just maybe just got to have a
[59:00] Pentecost Hallelujah like he did that's
[59:01] fine amen God will bring you through
[59:03] praise God Amen see people can just be
[59:06] so rough with it then you see what you
[59:08] do see doesn't it if you haven't got
[59:10] kindness here to move with it so what we
[59:12] need is hope faith and charity isn't
[59:14] that right hope faith and charity
[59:15] together God help out Church to have it
[59:18] like that the people to have that
[59:20] combination see to have that combination
[59:22] that means Jesus Christ becomes
[59:24] glorified in your life amen that's what
[59:26] we need so we need hope you know many
[59:28] times we say well you know hope your
[59:30] hope is a bad thing no hope is actually
[59:32] a good thing because hope is actually in
[59:35] the Bible hope is an expectation with
[59:36] pleasure so hope is actually an
[59:38] expectation God's going to move you know
[59:40] I trust when you drove here this morning
[59:42] you had a hope you had expectation I'm
[59:45] going to meet Jesus Christ I'm going to
[59:46] have more than maybe a nice time meeting
[59:48] other believers from around the country
[59:49] but God's going to come down he's going
[59:51] to anoint his word to my heart I'm going
[59:53] to walk out of these doors change that
[59:55] Spirit of that mind battle has been
[59:56] bothering more always going to be cast
[59:58] out by the washing of the water of the
[1:00:00] word and God's going to touch me like
[1:00:02] only he can see that is a hope I mean
[1:00:04] that's why we have you know camps you
[1:00:06] have special meetings anywhere around
[1:00:07] the world and God moves in power because
[1:00:09] people have a hope they have an
[1:00:11] expectation when they go praise God so
[1:00:14] it's good to have we we need hope
[1:00:17] but hope by itself ain't gonna work
[1:00:19] right because hope you need faith and
[1:00:22] you need charity with it see see if you
[1:00:24] just rely on Hope You Hinder faith
[1:00:26] brother Brian CC I've got all this in
[1:00:28] yellow because I want to emphasize I'm
[1:00:29] just not making these things up I trust
[1:00:31] it sticks a bit more if it's up there I
[1:00:33] mean see you just can't rely on Hope See
[1:00:35] You Hinder faith if you just rely on
[1:00:37] hope now see hope looks for something a
[1:00:39] way off but Faith claims it right now so
[1:00:42] Faith takes the expectation and brings
[1:00:44] it into the present amen just like Jesus
[1:00:46] when he is standing there by lazarus's
[1:00:48] grave and he's speaking to Miriam Martha
[1:00:50] and you know he said you know do you
[1:00:52] believe you know your brother will raise
[1:00:53] again and one of them said I know he'll
[1:00:55] raise the resurrection of the last day
[1:00:57] see she had a hope but now faith hope
[1:00:59] faith and charity was there talking to
[1:01:02] her and he was saying no no hold on I
[1:01:04] want to take your Hope from the future
[1:01:06] and bring it into the present because he
[1:01:08] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:01:10] so right now your hope is going to
[1:01:12] become manifested in a faith amen it
[1:01:15] should be the same thing with you and I
[1:01:16] that our expectation shouldn't just be
[1:01:18] in the future but Faith brings it into
[1:01:20] the presence
[1:01:21] Hallelujah see hope looks for something
[1:01:24] way off but Faith claims it right now
[1:01:26] faith says God said so in its mind that
[1:01:28] settles it I don't care if I'm still
[1:01:30] crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still
[1:01:32] sick it don't have nothing to do with it
[1:01:34] I believe it anyhow it's mine right now
[1:01:36] God said so that settles it see that's
[1:01:38] Faith but hope said God said so and I'm
[1:01:41] expecting to get it someday you see I'm
[1:01:43] expecting someday and as long as Satan
[1:01:46] can put you off to another day see one
[1:01:49] day see hope says the conditions aren't
[1:01:51] right but faith says the conditions are
[1:01:52] right right now amen so don't just don't
[1:01:55] just be putting it's good to have a hope
[1:01:57] but don't just mat not always be
[1:01:59] tomorrow
[1:02:00] remember
[1:02:01] today
[1:02:03] was yesterday's tomorrow
[1:02:05] so have it today not always a tomorrow
[1:02:09] praise God see I'm expecting it says as
[1:02:11] long as Satan can put you off to another
[1:02:13] day it's as good as he wants that's
[1:02:15] right you'll never get it just believe
[1:02:17] you got it now it's your personal
[1:02:19] property faith is the substance of
[1:02:21] things hopeful for the evidence of
[1:02:23] Things Not Seen is that right Faith acts
[1:02:25] now it's positive there's no Maya tell
[1:02:28] you sickness and everything else when
[1:02:30] Faith steps in it's just like a snowball
[1:02:31] on a hot stove it just melts away
[1:02:33] everything goes away from Faith because
[1:02:36] Faith stands up and takes over a rule
[1:02:38] When Faith speaks everybody else keeps
[1:02:40] still that's right amen so so let let
[1:02:45] Faith get a hold of your hope and bring
[1:02:46] it into the present amen amen hallelujah
[1:02:51] see hey see we need an expectation
[1:02:55] see what if we all came and we had the
[1:02:57] same agreement that Jesus Christ is the
[1:02:58] same yesterday today and forever that we
[1:03:01] love him with all our hearts that his
[1:03:02] blood has cleansed us from every sin
[1:03:04] amen that we are sinless right now in
[1:03:06] his presence amen that God has done such
[1:03:09] a complete work in our lives that we're
[1:03:11] ready for the Rapture because we are by
[1:03:12] the way if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:03:13] you're ready amen you've got your ticket
[1:03:15] in your heart you're ready to go amen
[1:03:17] that God has made you into His Image
[1:03:19] amen that we're all on the same team
[1:03:22] we're wearing the same colors today
[1:03:24] praise God we're all cheering the same
[1:03:26] hey team Jesus is our team amen we're
[1:03:29] we're the same rallying cry that this
[1:03:31] word lives amen that he transforms lives
[1:03:33] amen that he's here to meet our needs
[1:03:36] amen hallelujah that Jesus Christ is
[1:03:38] alive the tomb is empty amen his blood
[1:03:40] was more than enough do we all agree
[1:03:42] with this amen well then then then when
[1:03:44] we when we come into that common
[1:03:45] agreement amen that brings a power into
[1:03:47] the room
[1:03:48] I mean because you can take it the
[1:03:50] negative if you know if if people resist
[1:03:54] then uh then then then it then then that
[1:03:57] power of God can't come into the room
[1:03:58] right because it's unbelief because
[1:04:00] remember Jesus had said of him he
[1:04:01] couldn't do many mighty works because of
[1:04:03] their unbelief so now what about if we
[1:04:05] take the opposite and bring Faith into
[1:04:07] the picture I mean imagine that if if
[1:04:10] that scripture was actually written a
[1:04:11] different way and he did many mighty
[1:04:13] works because of their faith amen now I
[1:04:15] believe that we're we are a people right
[1:04:17] now that have faith
[1:04:19] not just a human Faith but God's Own
[1:04:22] Faith amen so now what if we join our
[1:04:24] faith together and say Yes Lord and what
[1:04:28] do we join our faith you're going to say
[1:04:29] Lord I Want to See You Walk Among Us
[1:04:30] Lord I want to see your angels come
[1:04:33] Among Us amen you know this is how we
[1:04:34] fight our battles we're surrounded by
[1:04:36] him I mean if we just realized this
[1:04:38] morning that angels of God have gathered
[1:04:40] amen they were with you in the car
[1:04:42] driving here amen now with you when you
[1:04:44] got up out of bed this morning amen now
[1:04:46] they're gathering in an unseen realm
[1:04:47] amen because they want to watch the
[1:04:49] children of God worship and they can't
[1:04:51] join in and worship like you can worship
[1:04:53] because there is no atonement for them
[1:04:55] there's no Redemption for them they
[1:04:57] didn't know what it was like to be lost
[1:04:58] and be found Amen to be redeemed they
[1:05:00] don't know what it's like to walk with
[1:05:01] God like you know amen so they gather
[1:05:04] around though but well they're here they
[1:05:05] come to energize our faith and then God
[1:05:08] steps down into the worship himself Amen
[1:05:10] to where there's far more in this room
[1:05:12] than we can see right this morning amen
[1:05:14] if we can just believe it amen that God
[1:05:17] is here I mean he can anoint our faith
[1:05:19] to meet any right now amen that God is
[1:05:22] here to meet every need if we can just
[1:05:24] believe that if we can go beyond our
[1:05:25] week in our day and what we're facing on
[1:05:27] Monday and whatever more but you know if
[1:05:29] we can just can you what's going on here
[1:05:31] I'm on the radio
[1:05:33] I mean you know if we can just go beyond
[1:05:35] all those things
[1:05:36] and believe and let our faith loose Amen
[1:05:39] to take every promise of God Amen I
[1:05:41] believe we'll have a meeting like
[1:05:42] there's never been on the history of the
[1:05:44] Earth because God is unlimited amen God
[1:05:47] God Is No Limit amen and and the Bible
[1:05:50] says all things are possible to them
[1:05:52] that believe amen so there's nothing
[1:05:54] impossible with you amen if God is on
[1:05:56] the inside of you there's nothing
[1:05:58] impossible with you your faith is
[1:06:00] actually unlimited if you're allowed to
[1:06:02] take control
[1:06:04] Hallelujah I believe that I believe God
[1:06:06] can do anything he can go and save
[1:06:07] anyone they can be on the other side of
[1:06:09] the earth amen God can go get a hold of
[1:06:11] them they can be alone somewhere they
[1:06:13] can have a hangover somewhere they can
[1:06:15] be in drugs somewhere and God can get a
[1:06:17] hold of that person bring them to their
[1:06:18] right mind and they can come back to him
[1:06:20] I believe nothing is impossible with our
[1:06:22] God Amen do you believe it this morning
[1:06:24] amen we don't look at symptoms we look
[1:06:27] at Faith amen we look at the word of God
[1:06:28] I mean God is placing in our hearts to
[1:06:31] claim every Divine promise
[1:06:33] Hallelujah
[1:06:34] amen I believe it I I'm sorry but I've
[1:06:37] seen God do this world he just spoken to
[1:06:40] exist as the universe he just spoke into
[1:06:42] existence and sometimes we think our
[1:06:44] troubles are big trouble no God just
[1:06:46] spoke it and here it is and we're
[1:06:48] walking upon it and if he can create
[1:06:50] this world and put you here and look
[1:06:52] after your four Bears all the way down
[1:06:54] to where you are right now can you get a
[1:06:55] hold of the ones that are on your heart
[1:06:57] this morning amen Connie Connie heal the
[1:07:00] sick rays of dead Save The Lost can he
[1:07:03] do those things I believe he can amen
[1:07:05] there's no one greater than our God Amen
[1:07:07] we've seen him glorified over and over
[1:07:09] again amen may he be glorified in our
[1:07:12] hearts see what is that doing that's
[1:07:13] building the power of yes
[1:07:15] yes that's building the power of Amen so
[1:07:17] be it Hallelujah then what happens God
[1:07:19] begins to anoint our faith I mean a
[1:07:21] faith Bank begins to build oh look
[1:07:24] that's what we want to do this morning
[1:07:25] let God come down
[1:07:27] amen see what happens the first thing
[1:07:29] see it says yes the next man says yes
[1:07:31] look at it you got double power yes
[1:07:33] Triple Power yes four times yes the
[1:07:36] first thing you know it becomes a
[1:07:37] thousand pounds of years then the holy
[1:07:38] spirit moves in and confirms the word of
[1:07:41] God with signs and wonders following
[1:07:43] that's it that's what we need an
[1:07:45] expectation
[1:07:46] I mean that's what we need a hope
[1:07:48] hallelujah amen that's why it's so
[1:07:51] powerful I mean to say Amen from your
[1:07:53] heart say yes
[1:07:54] you know maybe a service goes a bit
[1:07:57] quiet maybe see the you know preacher's
[1:07:58] struggle but just say Amen we're going
[1:08:00] to pull on that gift say God pull Lord I
[1:08:03] want to pull words out of that man's
[1:08:05] mouth Lord that you put in his mouth
[1:08:07] maybe he's not even thinking about God
[1:08:08] you can speak it Hallelujah Jesus our
[1:08:11] son put to pull on the gifts of God and
[1:08:13] the song leader and the musicians
[1:08:14] special say yes Lord
[1:08:17] Hallelujah
[1:08:18] Hallelujah I believe God can do anything
[1:08:21] this morning
[1:08:22] amen now Abraham was the father of the
[1:08:24] faith we're the children of the faith he
[1:08:26] says now who against hope believed in
[1:08:28] hope that he might become the father of
[1:08:29] many nations according to that which was
[1:08:31] spoken so shall thy seed be so he had
[1:08:34] two hopes yeah there's the hope of his
[1:08:36] body that he could physically do it but
[1:08:38] then against that hope he believes the
[1:08:40] hope that God was going to do it amen so
[1:08:42] he had a hope he against hope believed
[1:08:44] in hope so he had an expectation where
[1:08:46] against the expectation of his body he
[1:08:48] believed in another ex a greater
[1:08:50] expectation that God was able to do it
[1:08:53] see so Abraham had a hope
[1:08:55] Hallelujah and he had Faith too praise
[1:08:58] God I believe he had love as well
[1:09:00] why because he stood on the gap for a
[1:09:02] lot in his family
[1:09:04] amen see against hope yet believed in
[1:09:07] hope hope is all gone yet he believed in
[1:09:09] it when hope was done dead to him Hope
[1:09:12] was dead every scientific search every
[1:09:14] resource of wisdom Hope was gone but he
[1:09:17] still believed in it what was it faith
[1:09:19] in it Faith and Hope When Hope wasn't
[1:09:21] there Hallelujah Faith and Hope when you
[1:09:24] got no hope yet yet he still believed in
[1:09:26] hopes because he said that he told me so
[1:09:28] so shall thy seeds be amen because he
[1:09:31] told me so see see because he told you
[1:09:33] so therefore you can have expectation in
[1:09:36] that I mean because his word is true
[1:09:38] amen Hallelujah see we need we need hope
[1:09:41] faith and charity you see Jesus Christ
[1:09:43] glorified now when when where when Jesus
[1:09:46] would go and raise driest daughter from
[1:09:48] the dead you know there's always a
[1:09:50] reason why he would take Peter James and
[1:09:52] John with him it wasn't just because
[1:09:54] they were the in inner circle of the uh
[1:09:57] disciples no because they were
[1:09:58] representing hope faith and charity and
[1:10:01] so whenever we have a need that arises
[1:10:03] Among Us in our family or in church we
[1:10:05] need hope faith and charity to walk into
[1:10:07] the room with us amen because when when
[1:10:10] Jesus went into driest house and driest
[1:10:12] daughter was dead you know he just said
[1:10:14] no she just is asleep she's not actually
[1:10:16] dead and they laughed at him they made
[1:10:17] fun of the Messiah so he kicked them all
[1:10:20] out except for the parents and and Peter
[1:10:23] James and John amen so why because he
[1:10:26] took hope faith and charity with him to
[1:10:28] bring a resurrection of the Dead amen
[1:10:31] and and we're looking for the ultimate
[1:10:33] resurrection of the dead the dead in
[1:10:35] Christ the raised amen so not just one
[1:10:36] here one there but all of the body of
[1:10:38] Christ Through the Ages to see them come
[1:10:41] to life I mean see they laughed at him
[1:10:43] and what he said was the word of God so
[1:10:45] when he said to them words he put them
[1:10:47] out of the house and look what um who he
[1:10:50] took with him Peter James and John love
[1:10:52] faith and charity I mean faith hope and
[1:10:54] charity Peter James and John those three
[1:10:56] that's what you want to take along with
[1:10:58] you hope faith and charity walk into the
[1:11:00] sick room I mean so when we're walking
[1:11:02] there's a need amen and there's those
[1:11:03] three in US something's going to happen
[1:11:05] I mean God is going to answer prayer I
[1:11:08] mean sometimes it may not be right then
[1:11:09] and there but God is working amen so we
[1:11:11] can have ultimate confidence when we
[1:11:13] when we lay our hands on the sick when
[1:11:15] we have a need amen that hope faith and
[1:11:17] charity is already within you God's
[1:11:18] going to move something's gonna happen
[1:11:21] Hallelujah who has that kind of a belief
[1:11:23] this morning amen God hears our prayers
[1:11:25] amen he's not he's not far away
[1:11:27] somewhere amen but he's here to meet
[1:11:28] every need
[1:11:30] so we need hope expectation we know
[1:11:33] faith is a revelation I mean this
[1:11:36] message gives us a revelation of perfect
[1:11:37] faith it puts perfect Faith within our
[1:11:40] lives by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:41] but we need charity yeah
[1:11:45] amen charity is the most important
[1:11:48] Divine love we need Divine love more
[1:11:50] than ever in this day amen because
[1:11:52] iniquity shall abound the Bible says the
[1:11:54] love of many shall wax cold amen but I
[1:11:57] believe love is getting greater among
[1:11:58] the bride of Christ it's it's on the
[1:12:01] increase it's not it's not a vessel that
[1:12:03] is just leaking out of and it's going
[1:12:05] down and down and down no it's
[1:12:07] increasing faith is increasing hope is
[1:12:09] increasing love is increasing I mean Joy
[1:12:12] is increasing the fruits of the spirit
[1:12:14] are increasing amen it's not being
[1:12:16] chewed away it's increasing Hallelujah
[1:12:18] because we can look back even a year ago
[1:12:20] and see where we were and see where we
[1:12:22] are now and sure we've been through
[1:12:23] struggles we've had battles you may have
[1:12:25] come through those doors with struggles
[1:12:27] and battles but you can look back and
[1:12:28] say the person I was I'm not that person
[1:12:30] I've I've ascended the Lord has brought
[1:12:33] me closer to him he's brought me higher
[1:12:34] in his word I mean he's been doing a
[1:12:36] work in my life Hallelujah I trust you
[1:12:38] can see that amen you may be through the
[1:12:40] worst year of your life but yet I
[1:12:42] believe you'll be closer to God Amen
[1:12:45] because God harnesses trouble and cause
[1:12:46] it to bring us closer to him
[1:12:49] praise the Lord hallelujah see charity
[1:12:52] suffereth long see love is more than a
[1:12:54] word it's an action amen it's a life
[1:12:56] amen only oh you can only have True Love
[1:12:59] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I mean
[1:13:02] outside of that it's just human love and
[1:13:03] human love as if you do this I'll do
[1:13:05] that for you but the love of God says
[1:13:07] I'll do it for you even if you do
[1:13:08] nothing for me Hallelujah
[1:13:10] amen praise God hallelujah you see
[1:13:13] charity suffereth long is kind charity
[1:13:15] envious not charity vaunteth not herself
[1:13:18] is not puffed up does not behave itself
[1:13:21] unseemly seeketh not our own is not
[1:13:23] easily provoked thinketh no evil
[1:13:25] rejoiceth not an iniquity but rejoiceth
[1:13:28] in the truth it beareth all things
[1:13:30] believeth all things hope with all
[1:13:32] things endureth all things see if you
[1:13:35] have Divine Love You Have Faith and Hope
[1:13:39] Hallelujah praise God they're all there
[1:13:42] amen see charity never fail us but
[1:13:45] whether there be prophecies they shall
[1:13:46] fail whether it be tongues they shall
[1:13:48] cease knowledge they shall vanish away
[1:13:50] for we know in part we prophesy in part
[1:13:52] but then what that which is perfect has
[1:13:54] come then that which is part shall be
[1:13:56] done away when I was a child I spoke as
[1:13:58] a child I understood as a child I
[1:14:00] thought as a child but when I became a
[1:14:01] man I put away childish things for we
[1:14:04] see through a glass Darkly but then face
[1:14:06] to face amen now I know in part but then
[1:14:09] I shall know even also as I am known
[1:14:11] this is this day he's talking about amen
[1:14:14] and now abideth hope faith and charity
[1:14:16] these three but the greatest of these is
[1:14:18] Charity amen see now when we talk about
[1:14:21] these things we don't kick the gifts out
[1:14:23] we understand that amen but God is here
[1:14:25] to take all the measure of the gifts and
[1:14:27] manifest it through his people as he
[1:14:29] sees fit to do amen we're not here just
[1:14:31] to have a dead lecture every Sunday but
[1:14:33] we want to see a living God Amen come on
[1:14:35] display see it see it's not it see it's
[1:14:37] not how it's how it's manifested up here
[1:14:40] see I could just see see someone who's
[1:14:42] anointed and teaches it can look very
[1:14:44] very dry in The Sims it's not very
[1:14:46] charismatic but as long as God takes
[1:14:48] that word anoints it to her heart then
[1:14:50] that's exactly the same as the
[1:14:51] Evangelist running the building right as
[1:14:53] long as God does what he wants to do
[1:14:55] that's perfectly fine as long as it's
[1:14:57] anointed amen the manifestation may be
[1:14:59] different but as long as God takes the
[1:15:01] word anoints it to someone does what he
[1:15:03] wants to do then that's what we're
[1:15:04] looking for I remember we need Divine
[1:15:06] love the greatest of these as Charity
[1:15:09] Hallelujah
[1:15:11] amen you see now Faith love and faith
[1:15:14] work together
[1:15:16] now we're living in a day where there is
[1:15:18] perfect faith
[1:15:19] there's perfect faith in a people
[1:15:22] yeah perfect Faith the bride of Christ
[1:15:24] has perfect Faith this morning
[1:15:27] yeah well you say I don't feel like I've
[1:15:29] got perfect Faith well faith is not a
[1:15:30] Feeling
[1:15:32] right you may feel you know there's
[1:15:35] moments that are in my life like even
[1:15:37] this past week I feel like I'm ready for
[1:15:39] a Rapture next minute I feel like Lord
[1:15:41] how are you ever going to save me you
[1:15:42] know and then Nick minute Lord why are
[1:15:44] you even wasting your time
[1:15:46] and they can be in the same afternoon
[1:15:47] you know and me and then you come out of
[1:15:51] it and then you're rejoicing again see
[1:15:53] so so we can't go by feeling see this
[1:15:55] world this world has been engineered to
[1:15:58] go by feelings
[1:15:59] well I don't feel like doing that I feel
[1:16:01] like doing that whatever feels good do
[1:16:02] it
[1:16:03] well that's crazy
[1:16:05] you know but you see the world is
[1:16:07] engineered that way now to go by
[1:16:09] feelings we don't go by feelings we go
[1:16:11] by Revelation I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:16:14] daughter of God lord Jesus you died on
[1:16:16] Calvary for me you washed all my sins
[1:16:18] away you have made me in your image but
[1:16:20] irrespective of how I feel I'm still a
[1:16:23] child of God
[1:16:25] Hallelujah so I believe there's a
[1:16:27] perfect faith on the earth this morning
[1:16:29] Hallelujah
[1:16:31] perfect faith is a master of all
[1:16:33] circumstances perfect Faith Masters all
[1:16:36] circumstances no matter what it is it
[1:16:38] Masters it
[1:16:39] see we've got to just realize the word
[1:16:41] gives us perfect faith God gives us
[1:16:44] perfect Faith you don't give yourself
[1:16:45] faith
[1:16:47] see you you don't build up a faith in
[1:16:49] your own ability in your own mind no God
[1:16:51] deposits it in you right and we've got
[1:16:54] to realize this see the end time message
[1:16:56] releases a perfect Faith because it
[1:16:59] gives us a stability that we know who we
[1:17:02] are we're not guessing who we are we
[1:17:04] know who God is right we know what he's
[1:17:06] done for us and we know where he's
[1:17:08] taking us right we know what we know who
[1:17:11] the enemy is
[1:17:13] that should give us a perfect Faith see
[1:17:15] Jesus knew exactly who he was and that
[1:17:17] gave him a perfect faith see gone to
[1:17:20] drice's house race drives his daughter
[1:17:22] he could speak to the storm he could
[1:17:24] bring Lazarus out of the Grave remember
[1:17:26] heels led by Vision he was led by the
[1:17:28] father right but he knew he was the son
[1:17:31] he was his son so he knew if God is my
[1:17:33] father and I'm his son he will lead me
[1:17:35] to do what he wants me to do and that
[1:17:38] was a perfect faith and that should be
[1:17:39] the same thing with you and I we know
[1:17:41] who our father is I trust you know who
[1:17:43] daddy is I'm not talking about your
[1:17:45] natural Daddy I'm talking about your
[1:17:46] real daddy
[1:17:47] Matt yo yo your real daddy used your
[1:17:49] natural mum and dad to bring you here
[1:17:51] but he's your real father
[1:17:52] amen so I trust you know who he is and
[1:17:55] if you know who he is the reason you
[1:17:56] know that is because he wants you to
[1:17:58] know who you are see we're not see the
[1:18:01] Lord did not save us
[1:18:02] to lose us you know Chris and I are
[1:18:04] talking about the Ten Commandment film
[1:18:06] you know I mean what you just read in
[1:18:07] the Bible God God plagues Egypt brings
[1:18:10] the Israelites out then they start
[1:18:12] complaining and then God delivers to
[1:18:15] them again and then something else
[1:18:16] happens then they start complaining and
[1:18:18] then God comes on the scene again and
[1:18:20] God answers their needs and then they
[1:18:22] keep complaining
[1:18:25] there's something very wrong with that
[1:18:27] picture because they should realize that
[1:18:29] that that the second Moses walked back
[1:18:32] into Egypt anointed by the pillar of
[1:18:34] fire that realized that the prophecy
[1:18:36] that was given to Abraham and what
[1:18:38] Joseph said concerning his bones was
[1:18:40] going to happen amen that Joseph's bones
[1:18:43] were not going to be taken halfway out
[1:18:44] of Egypt dropped somewhere and they were
[1:18:46] going to be dragged back into slavery
[1:18:48] again but they should have a perfect
[1:18:49] confidence God has answered that
[1:18:51] prophecy right now and he's going to
[1:18:53] take us out of Egypt and not just leave
[1:18:55] us in the wilderness he's going to take
[1:18:57] us into the promised land amen and it
[1:18:59] seems to be the see Joshua and Caleb
[1:19:01] they were just like they weren't
[1:19:02] murmuring and complaining they are right
[1:19:04] behind the vision of God I mean because
[1:19:06] they believed amen was put in their
[1:19:08] hearts God has not brought us out to
[1:19:11] kill us he hasn't brought us brought us
[1:19:14] out just to be massacred by the
[1:19:15] Egyptians he hasn't brought us out just
[1:19:17] to leave us in the wilderness but we're
[1:19:18] going all the way through Hallelujah so
[1:19:22] that so to me Caleb had perfect faith
[1:19:24] Hallelujah I made it mastered all
[1:19:27] circumstances remember he was in the
[1:19:29] same circumstances that Cora and ether
[1:19:30] maroon and all the murmurs and
[1:19:32] complainers are in he had the same dust
[1:19:34] problems he had the same water problems
[1:19:36] he had the same desert problems he had
[1:19:38] the same he had the same view when he
[1:19:40] got out of his tent in the morning let
[1:19:41] the yeah yeah that they did he had all
[1:19:43] the same problems but they were
[1:19:45] murmuring and complaining but his faith
[1:19:47] mastered the circumstances why because
[1:19:50] his faith said I'm not staying here
[1:19:52] we're on our way to canaan's Fair land I
[1:19:55] mean I've got an inheritance in that
[1:19:56] land others what his faith mastered the
[1:19:59] circumstance it didn't change the
[1:20:01] circumstances they were still in the
[1:20:03] desert they still let sand come into the
[1:20:05] tent and go out they sell out all those
[1:20:06] things but his faith mastered the
[1:20:08] circumstance
[1:20:10] Hallelujah
[1:20:12] that same Faith was in Caleb is in you
[1:20:14] and I
[1:20:15] know Hallelujah amen you say well I
[1:20:18] don't feel that kind of way are you a
[1:20:20] Believer this morning
[1:20:21] you believe you're going in a Rapture
[1:20:23] today or this you know today this
[1:20:25] morning we can go right now that'd be
[1:20:27] fine what a great anniversary meeting
[1:20:29] that would be and we came to church and
[1:20:31] and then and then we we all disappear
[1:20:35] and it's not because we went to lunch
[1:20:36] it's because we went into Glory what
[1:20:39] what do you want to see the glorified
[1:20:40] Christ amen see him as he is amen
[1:20:43] hallelujah I trust that's your
[1:20:44] expectation
[1:20:45] I mean so Caleb's Faith mastered all the
[1:20:49] circumstances it mastered the Giants at
[1:20:52] Master Jericho at mastered every part of
[1:20:55] that Journey at mastered those Devils on
[1:20:57] his inheritance his faith mastered them
[1:20:59] he says I'm as strong now as I was when
[1:21:01] I came out of Egypt give me my Mountain
[1:21:04] so his perfect Faith actually caused all
[1:21:07] of his enemies squatting on his promise
[1:21:09] to be destroyed and he took possession
[1:21:11] of that promise Hallelujah
[1:21:14] amen see no matter what it is that
[1:21:16] Masters it now just watch when you
[1:21:19] believe anything do anything and you've
[1:21:20] got faith in what you're doing
[1:21:23] I believe we're living in a day that
[1:21:25] we're not just as doing a stab in the
[1:21:26] dark kind of a Christianity we know
[1:21:28] exactly what we're doing I mean because
[1:21:30] we know the heart of God we know what he
[1:21:32] loves what he doesn't love we know how
[1:21:34] to please him we know how to approach
[1:21:35] him we know how to walk with him right
[1:21:37] the message is revealed all these things
[1:21:39] amen so we can have confidence
[1:21:41] have faith in what we're doing I mean
[1:21:44] when you take God in his word we have
[1:21:46] faith in what we're doing we're not just
[1:21:48] hoping that the promises got to work
[1:21:49] right we know it's going to work amen if
[1:21:52] it works for me it'll work for my
[1:21:53] children amen if I work for this person
[1:21:55] to work for the other person right
[1:21:57] because Faith Masters all circumstances
[1:22:00] do you have confidence in what you're
[1:22:02] doing
[1:22:02] you know I trust you out of faith that
[1:22:04] how you raise your family it's not I
[1:22:07] hope this turns out fine
[1:22:09] you have a confidence
[1:22:10] God's going to get a hold of my kids
[1:22:12] they're going to have a Revival the next
[1:22:14] generation is going to have a have an
[1:22:16] earth-shaking Revival of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:18] amen they're going to see God move in
[1:22:20] power it's not going to be my testimony
[1:22:21] only what's going to be their testimony
[1:22:23] they're going to see God live amen like
[1:22:25] I saw them live they're going to see him
[1:22:26] live if you have confidence that you
[1:22:28] create an atmosphere when you have
[1:22:29] family prayer that God's going to step
[1:22:30] down into your until your family all the
[1:22:32] time or maybe you're at the table maybe
[1:22:34] you're just talking and you're just
[1:22:36] under expectation that God will step
[1:22:38] down why because we've created our homes
[1:22:40] as a sanctuary for God Amen that he
[1:22:42] would feel pleased when he drives up
[1:22:44] your driveway knocks on your door he's
[1:22:46] like I'm so glad I'm so glad I'm home I
[1:22:48] can dwell here I can spend time with
[1:22:50] these people because they're my people
[1:22:52] and I love them they love me Hallelujah
[1:22:54] I trust that's how you are in your heart
[1:22:56] amen Hallelujah
[1:22:59] praise God see we we're going to have
[1:23:01] faith in what we're doing amen well what
[1:23:04] about the other person
[1:23:05] I you can't answer for what they did
[1:23:07] maybe it didn't work for them but the
[1:23:09] word still works for the believer amen
[1:23:12] and you know just because it doesn't
[1:23:13] appear to work doesn't mean it's not
[1:23:14] going to work in the end
[1:23:16] right Hallelujah just because our
[1:23:18] families go Wayward doesn't mean it's
[1:23:20] not going to work we're going to have
[1:23:22] confidence we're to look beyond what we
[1:23:23] see and look to the promise of God Amen
[1:23:26] we can't get discouraged remember just
[1:23:28] unusual discourage you
[1:23:30] you know I was thinking what if we made
[1:23:32] a website of good news yeah I'm just
[1:23:34] talking about natural news now this is
[1:23:36] good news today Herald or whatever paper
[1:23:39] it'll just be an old lady Timmins got
[1:23:41] her cat back from the tree it'd be like
[1:23:43] one article around the whole world you
[1:23:45] know there won't be much good to fill a
[1:23:47] big way because the news is all negative
[1:23:50] right it's all negative and but but
[1:23:52] problem is the news is looking at the
[1:23:54] circumstances right and if we look at
[1:23:57] circumstances we will get discouraged
[1:23:59] right but if we look at the promise it
[1:24:01] looks beyond the circumstances and it
[1:24:04] will bring actually the promise into
[1:24:05] manifestation but don't get discouraged
[1:24:07] amen by what you see
[1:24:11] amen because remember as I said last
[1:24:13] Sunday we're all going through a trial
[1:24:16] but if you go through a place you don't
[1:24:17] stay there
[1:24:19] amen now I just want to I want to drop
[1:24:21] this in this is um
[1:24:23] you know because many times we think
[1:24:25] Lord are you actually do you see me in
[1:24:27] my plight
[1:24:29] do you see me in my struggle and I was
[1:24:32] thinking about there with this is the
[1:24:33] account won't read it but you know Hager
[1:24:35] when she's when she's with child you
[1:24:38] know by Abraham and then of course Sarah
[1:24:40] hates her and and and kicks her out and
[1:24:43] then she begins to be in distress saying
[1:24:45] you know what is
[1:24:46] what is going on here and then and then
[1:24:49] the angel of the Lord actually found her
[1:24:51] by the Fountain of water in the
[1:24:52] wilderness amen and you know and then
[1:24:54] the angel says what are you doing here
[1:24:56] what's going on and then he said you
[1:24:58] know return to your mistress and submit
[1:25:00] yourself
[1:25:01] and then you see but then the promise
[1:25:04] was still given to all uh multiply those
[1:25:06] seed exceedingly
[1:25:08] and then now because she felt like she
[1:25:10] was she was just Cast Away that she
[1:25:13] wasn't cared about that she wasn't going
[1:25:14] to be looked after though she was
[1:25:16] actually she was carrying a part of the
[1:25:18] promise it wasn't the promised son but
[1:25:20] it was a son of Abraham right and and
[1:25:23] then yeah we know Ishmael he'll be a
[1:25:25] wild man you know his hand is against
[1:25:26] every man and all those things but then
[1:25:28] she called the name of the Lord that
[1:25:30] spake unto her thou God seeth me
[1:25:33] four she said have I also looked uh have
[1:25:37] I also looked after him that saith me
[1:25:39] therefore the well was called burla
[1:25:42] harore behold it is between kadish and
[1:25:44] burrito so that's the well of the god
[1:25:46] that seeth me
[1:25:48] now I just put this in because you think
[1:25:51] about this is Hager
[1:25:52] she's having a son by Abram
[1:25:55] not even part of the promise really but
[1:25:58] yet God was still mindful of her that
[1:26:02] she was not forgotten so now if she
[1:26:05] wasn't forgotten how much more you and I
[1:26:08] the bride of Christ the Sarah group
[1:26:10] right how much more of the Sarah group
[1:26:12] this morning amen of Hagar who was the
[1:26:15] mother of the wild man amen was looked
[1:26:17] after by God she has provided for she
[1:26:19] didn't perish how much more the Sarah
[1:26:21] group the bride of Christ I mean we've
[1:26:23] got to remember this God sees us many
[1:26:25] times we feel like he doesn't hear our
[1:26:27] prayers he doesn't understand what we're
[1:26:28] going through he does
[1:26:30] God see from the oldest of us to the um
[1:26:33] oldest to the youngest amen he sees all
[1:26:36] of us he cares for you
[1:26:38] we must not forget that see the devil
[1:26:40] would like to think we're not important
[1:26:42] with God but we are very important with
[1:26:44] God
[1:26:45] his focus is actually upon you and I in
[1:26:48] the same time Hallelujah
[1:26:51] amen now
[1:26:53] see Faith believes that God will work it
[1:26:56] out just go back to the yellow again I
[1:26:57] don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:26:59] he'll do it anyhow see that's Faith how
[1:27:01] do you know how's this going to happen I
[1:27:03] don't know but God said it's going to
[1:27:04] happen I just have confidence in God
[1:27:06] will work it out according to his riches
[1:27:08] and Glory I don't know how he's going to
[1:27:10] do it but he'll do it anyhow see it
[1:27:12] Masters all circumstances and faith and
[1:27:15] love is relation because you can't have
[1:27:17] faith unless you got love because your
[1:27:19] faith isn't what God is in a God Who is
[1:27:22] the very essence of love Faith and love
[1:27:25] worketh together
[1:27:27] brother I said it's like a husband and
[1:27:29] wife faith and love that's why you can't
[1:27:31] just have a Burly Faith or a hope you
[1:27:33] need hope faith and charity because
[1:27:35] faith and love work together if you love
[1:27:37] God you have faith in God
[1:27:40] right it's more than just a trust in
[1:27:41] someone you know no if you love someone
[1:27:43] you trust someone far more than if you
[1:27:45] didn't love them but yet you could trust
[1:27:47] them right workers faith and love works
[1:27:49] together now we know we live in a day
[1:27:52] where men will be a lovers of their own
[1:27:53] selves right so their love is on the
[1:27:56] wrong person their love this is a this
[1:27:59] is an age of self-care
[1:28:01] we'll look after number one can be the
[1:28:03] body can be what you eat can be can be
[1:28:05] free time it's all me me kind of a life
[1:28:08] but we're going to realize that we don't
[1:28:10] actually live here for ourselves we live
[1:28:12] here for one another we live here for
[1:28:14] God we come to worship you know we are
[1:28:16] here to worship and serve the Lord and
[1:28:18] we know when we get married our all of
[1:28:20] our old lives should basically be kicked
[1:28:21] to one side we can't be a bachelor that
[1:28:24] now has a wife and maybe some children
[1:28:25] part of the old boys club that does the
[1:28:27] same old hobbies and doesn't make room
[1:28:29] no you got to get rid of all that stuff
[1:28:30] God can bring it back surely but you
[1:28:33] can't expect to live the same old life
[1:28:34] now that you're married because your
[1:28:36] life is for your spouse not for you
[1:28:38] amen so we don't want to be lovers of
[1:28:40] our own selves right lovers of pleasure
[1:28:42] more than lovers of God see people say
[1:28:44] well they love the Lord but if they love
[1:28:46] Pleasures more see with where's the love
[1:28:49] balance now I'm not saying you can't
[1:28:50] have hobbies you can't have pastimes go
[1:28:52] have fun
[1:28:54] but love the Lord more than anything
[1:28:56] right it doesn't mean you can't play
[1:28:58] sport you can't do whatever but what is
[1:29:00] your main focus if your main focus is
[1:29:02] your free time you've got a your focus
[1:29:04] has got to be changed
[1:29:06] right having a form of Godless but
[1:29:08] denying the power from such turnaways is
[1:29:11] actually talking about Christians in the
[1:29:12] end time but I believe I'm looking at a
[1:29:14] people that that that aren't fulfilling
[1:29:16] this part of the scripture I trust you
[1:29:18] not anyhow
[1:29:19] amen AC
[1:29:21] I'm just going to come back to the faith
[1:29:23] in love we're just doing a bit of a
[1:29:24] Segway you see now Abraham ye uh know ye
[1:29:28] therefore that they which are of Faith
[1:29:30] the same other children of Abraham and
[1:29:33] the scripture foreseen that God would
[1:29:34] justify the Heathen through faith preach
[1:29:36] before the gospel unto Abraham saying
[1:29:38] and thee shall All Nations be blessed so
[1:29:40] then they the which are of Faith are
[1:29:42] blessed with faithful Abraham
[1:29:45] I mean so if you're of Faith you're
[1:29:46] blessed with faithful Abraham now
[1:29:49] Abraham was given a promise when he when
[1:29:51] he was going to authorize the cup on the
[1:29:52] altar but but but
[1:29:54] um you know the angel stayed at his hand
[1:29:56] that thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:29:59] his enemies amen so this is a blessing
[1:30:01] that comes with with um Abraham is that
[1:30:04] his seed or his offspring will possess
[1:30:06] the gates of his enemies now we know
[1:30:08] that this seed is ultimately Jesus
[1:30:10] Christ he possessed the gates of all the
[1:30:12] enemies it was more than just Samson
[1:30:13] carrying the gates of Gaza amen ripping
[1:30:16] them off the hinges taking the doorposts
[1:30:17] with and carrying them away but you know
[1:30:20] that was just a shadow of what Christ
[1:30:21] would do amen because remember our lord
[1:30:23] Jesus he possessed the Gate of sickness
[1:30:25] he possessed the Gate of death he
[1:30:28] possessed the Gate of culture he
[1:30:30] possessed a gate of religion he
[1:30:31] possessed the Gate of sickness he
[1:30:33] possessed the Gate of unbelief he
[1:30:35] possessed every gate that can be named
[1:30:37] he possessed that gate and because he
[1:30:39] possessed that gate we can possess every
[1:30:40] gate too amen that we don't have to put
[1:30:43] up with the devil and his nonsense but
[1:30:44] we can possess the Gate of the enemy and
[1:30:46] when you possess the Gate of the enemy
[1:30:48] you actually come and con in control of
[1:30:50] us going out and is coming in
[1:30:53] Hallelujah
[1:30:55] amen there you stand this morning their
[1:30:56] stands the Church of the Living God I
[1:30:58] don't care what anyone else says what
[1:30:59] the doctor says what anything what the
[1:31:01] unbeliever says you can move more than a
[1:31:04] match we can more than a match for
[1:31:06] anything that comes along we're
[1:31:07] Abraham's seed and we shall possess the
[1:31:10] gate to our enemy no matter what the
[1:31:11] enemy is God gave the promise see that's
[1:31:14] the that's the keynote of the whole
[1:31:16] thing God gave the promise amen that's
[1:31:19] that was theirs their possession healing
[1:31:21] is your possession salvation's your
[1:31:23] possession the Holy Ghost is your
[1:31:25] possession uh there's great thousands of
[1:31:27] preachers so forth in Atlanta that says
[1:31:29] it's not so but the Seed of Abraham
[1:31:31] knows it's so they weighed right in
[1:31:33] possess the gates of the enemy God said
[1:31:35] they wouldn't they believe it because
[1:31:37] it's a promise his seed shall possess
[1:31:39] against the enemy now you'll go through
[1:31:42] testing and trials but you'll possess
[1:31:44] every gate
[1:31:46] it doesn't matter what everyone else is
[1:31:48] amen we will possess every gate now now
[1:31:51] from time to time I see Christine
[1:31:53] sitting there and she's underlining
[1:31:54] scriptures in the Bible with her red pen
[1:31:56] I'll say what are you underlining so one
[1:31:58] of them was this last night the secret
[1:32:00] things belong unto the Lord Our God now
[1:32:02] this could probably be a whole sermon
[1:32:03] but he's going to drop this in the
[1:32:04] secret things belong unto the Lord Our
[1:32:06] God but those which are revealed belong
[1:32:08] with belong unto us and to our children
[1:32:11] forever amen to the secret things are
[1:32:13] Gods but if they're revealed they belong
[1:32:15] to us amen so now the word has come
[1:32:17] fully open in this day the Seven Seals
[1:32:20] have opened I mean the Thunders have
[1:32:21] uttered their voices which is the
[1:32:22] revelation of Seven Seals All the word
[1:32:25] has been revealed the Rapture has been
[1:32:27] revealed overcoming power has been
[1:32:30] revealed Amen to walk with God has been
[1:32:33] revealed in this end time all that
[1:32:34] Christ is he's poured into the church I
[1:32:37] mean so there's no promise in the Bible
[1:32:39] that's actually a secret anymore that
[1:32:41] pertains to you and I it's all been
[1:32:43] revealed so if it's been revealed it
[1:32:45] belongs to me and to our children
[1:32:47] forever amen so it's been revealed to
[1:32:50] you at belongs to your children Amen to
[1:32:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been
[1:32:53] revealed to you and if God has met you
[1:32:56] and changed your life that belongs to
[1:32:57] your children if if he's healed you once
[1:33:00] healing's been revealed to you it
[1:33:01] belongs to your children amen of
[1:33:03] overcoming a mind battle has been
[1:33:05] revealed to you by his word it belongs
[1:33:07] to your children amen though because
[1:33:09] remember we've got to realize that the
[1:33:11] spirits we fought our children will
[1:33:13] fight
[1:33:14] amen amen the same things they go we've
[1:33:17] gone through okay they go through as
[1:33:19] well and maybe rebranded just like
[1:33:20] telecoms now spark and vodafone's now
[1:33:22] one New Zealander still the same old
[1:33:24] company
[1:33:25] different logo different color different
[1:33:27] whatever buzzwords and things still the
[1:33:30] same old thing and it's like the devil
[1:33:32] he you know he just rebrands you you
[1:33:34] know you take music from what like like
[1:33:36] the Beatles and it's just rebranded down
[1:33:37] I don't know who's trending hashtag now
[1:33:39] on Instagram I'm not interested but it's
[1:33:41] the same spirit
[1:33:43] just rebranded right maybe different
[1:33:45] it's a different genre Same Spirit just
[1:33:48] being rebranded right so the same
[1:33:50] spirits that we fought there fought amen
[1:33:53] but have been revealed to us so we can
[1:33:55] overcome it and we did and we'll be
[1:33:57] revealed to them
[1:33:58] Hallelujah
[1:34:00] praise God why it belongs to us Amen to
[1:34:03] every every Divine promise that has been
[1:34:05] revealed to us belongs to us and to our
[1:34:08] children forever
[1:34:10] hallelujah amen so now we can Rejoice we
[1:34:12] say Lord It's been revealed to me
[1:34:15] therefore it's going to be revealed to
[1:34:16] them it belongs to me then it belongs to
[1:34:19] them and as I say don't look at what you
[1:34:21] see with your fire you're with your eyes
[1:34:23] what you hear with your ears from them
[1:34:24] that's irrelevant look at the promise of
[1:34:27] God
[1:34:28] hallelujah look Beyond those things
[1:34:31] now it's amazing how how the Apostle
[1:34:34] Paul
[1:34:35] he uses this phrase in Galatians twice
[1:34:37] I'm going to go into it that you know
[1:34:39] for in Christ it says so for we through
[1:34:41] the spirit wait for the hope of
[1:34:43] righteousness by faith for in Christ
[1:34:45] Jesus neither circumcision avails
[1:34:47] anything nor
[1:34:48] uncircumcision so use that phrase twice
[1:34:51] and we're going to go into it now so so
[1:34:53] from Christ Jesus neither circumcision
[1:34:55] so keeping the law or uncircumcision not
[1:34:58] keeping the law availeth or actually
[1:34:59] does anything
[1:35:01] but Faith was which worketh by love
[1:35:05] this is what avails in Jesus Christ it's
[1:35:08] Faith which worketh by love so not just
[1:35:11] a Burly Faith by itself not just a hope
[1:35:13] and a faith but Faith which worketh by
[1:35:17] love so if you want Faith to work in
[1:35:20] your life how does it work by love
[1:35:24] amen see now this is from the dictionary
[1:35:27] I'll throw it up there so it means to be
[1:35:28] operative to be at work to put forth
[1:35:30] power so if you weren't Faith to be at
[1:35:33] work in your life or put forth power
[1:35:35] love Jesus love the Lord worship Him
[1:35:38] from your heart be thankful for what
[1:35:40] he's done amen if you want Faith to have
[1:35:42] effect or to display one's activity so
[1:35:45] your Works remember works as Faith
[1:35:48] expressed love the Lord
[1:35:50] this is what avails this is actually
[1:35:52] what gives prevailing power as that
[1:35:54] Faith worketh by love see it's not it's
[1:35:57] not it's not dressing just the right way
[1:35:59] conforming to a standard outwardly doing
[1:36:02] things because you're told to that's not
[1:36:04] what avails that may be part of the
[1:36:06] truth but what really avows his faith
[1:36:08] with workers by love because if you love
[1:36:10] the Lord you will obey his word right
[1:36:12] and no one has to make you do anything
[1:36:14] it's out of a free will Lord I love you
[1:36:16] I'll do whatever you want me to do you
[1:36:18] want me to get baptized in Your Name
[1:36:20] Lord Jesus praise God if you want me to
[1:36:22] put away those TV thing you know
[1:36:24] streaming device yo yo everything on the
[1:36:26] internet because TV is old-fashioned
[1:36:28] word these days you know that music
[1:36:30] whatever more I'll get rid of it Lord
[1:36:31] because I love you I want to please you
[1:36:33] because you gave all your life for me so
[1:36:35] I'm going to give all my life to you
[1:36:39] Hallelujah
[1:36:41] amen now here's the next one but God
[1:36:43] forbid that I should Glory save in the
[1:36:44] cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom
[1:36:47] the world is crucified unto me and I
[1:36:49] unto the world for in Christ Jesus
[1:36:52] neither circumcision of ours anything
[1:36:53] nor uncircumcision so we read that just
[1:36:55] before but a new creature
[1:36:58] and as many as walk according to this
[1:37:00] rule
[1:37:01] peace Beyond them and mercy and upon the
[1:37:03] Israel of God so upon the people of God
[1:37:06] so what avails in Christ is actually
[1:37:08] being a new creature in Christ see
[1:37:10] that's why the devil wants to keep the
[1:37:12] new birth from us that's why people
[1:37:14] actually afraid of being born again but
[1:37:16] she must be born again because when you
[1:37:18] become a new creature in Christ then
[1:37:20] overcoming power comes into your life
[1:37:21] then the love of God then the faith of
[1:37:23] God come into your life this is what
[1:37:25] gives you see it's not just conforming
[1:37:27] outwardly to the message that's not
[1:37:29] going to get you anywhere it's just
[1:37:30] going to make you miserable I remember
[1:37:32] when you really meet the Lord yourself
[1:37:33] and are born again amen that's when a
[1:37:35] joy comes into your life and you and you
[1:37:38] don't get bored serving God you love him
[1:37:40] amen you rejoice in him see so what
[1:37:43] avails or gives power is being a new
[1:37:46] creature see many times you think Lord
[1:37:47] you know you come into a trial your
[1:37:49] faith is put to the test you begin to
[1:37:51] think Lord how can I overcome this thing
[1:37:53] how can I live a life that's pleasing to
[1:37:55] you how can I you know get through this
[1:37:57] and we think well if I pray enough if I
[1:37:59] read enough if I listen enough if I do
[1:38:00] this enough buy fast enough all those
[1:38:02] things are fine but that's not what
[1:38:04] avails it's being a new creature in
[1:38:06] Christ that's one of our trust you're
[1:38:09] all with me this morning see we've got
[1:38:10] to put out of our minds that it's our
[1:38:12] own human works that that'll mirror
[1:38:14] anything with God
[1:38:18] how many draws night to us but but when
[1:38:21] God when a testimony is all done and
[1:38:23] gone and we're and we're rejoicing and
[1:38:24] the fruits of it there can't be any of
[1:38:26] us saying well we did something
[1:38:28] right you know Moses couldn't say well I
[1:38:31] open the Red Sea no God told him to
[1:38:34] raise the staff who who parted the water
[1:38:36] who made it like dry land it wasn't
[1:38:38] Moses it was God it wasn't Moses it even
[1:38:41] brought the plagues he just got told
[1:38:43] what to do and he did it right the same
[1:38:45] in the New Testament it wasn't you know
[1:38:46] you know it wasn't
[1:38:48] um you know Jesus said I do nothing but
[1:38:51] what the father shows me that I do
[1:38:53] likewise
[1:38:54] you know so any anything that's
[1:38:56] Supernatural we can't say well we did it
[1:38:59] you know who who actually anointed your
[1:39:01] faith to do it
[1:39:02] right it was God who initiated it who
[1:39:05] initiates a testimony God initiates the
[1:39:07] testimony who manifests the testimony
[1:39:09] God manifested testimony and that's
[1:39:12] that's why it's not that's not us and
[1:39:13] our human ability that can that can
[1:39:16] actually gain a favor with God and Lord
[1:39:18] you know I've done this therefore you've
[1:39:19] got to do this we know you love him
[1:39:21] you're a new creature in Christ you're
[1:39:23] one of his children right and that was
[1:39:25] what avails so he's trying to get the
[1:39:28] Galatians out of this idea of keeping
[1:39:30] the law in an outward Conformity and all
[1:39:31] keeping rules and so on he's saying
[1:39:33] those things won't avail
[1:39:35] you know you want to be overcoming
[1:39:37] Christians things those things won't
[1:39:39] help you none as being a new creature in
[1:39:41] Christ or faith working by love amen now
[1:39:44] as many as Walker so so we do have a
[1:39:46] rule to follow as many as walk according
[1:39:48] to this rule that's why I underlined it
[1:39:51] Hallelujah
[1:39:52] you know we say we don't follow rules
[1:39:54] well we follow this one yeah yeah right
[1:39:55] is that okay amen so as many as walk
[1:39:58] according to this rule peace Beyond them
[1:40:01] because there's a peace that comes into
[1:40:03] your heart when you realize I'm a son or
[1:40:05] daughter of God I can't God can't lose a
[1:40:08] part of himself and I'm part of him
[1:40:10] hallelujah amen you know if David could
[1:40:13] say I've never seen the righteous
[1:40:14] forsaken nor has seed begging bread I
[1:40:16] mean that still applies to me I mean
[1:40:19] quiet because the Lord has made me
[1:40:20] righteous amen so if the so if the
[1:40:22] righteous have never been forsaken in
[1:40:24] the Old Testament how much more in the
[1:40:25] New Testament right now
[1:40:27] praise God and mercy so peace and mercy
[1:40:31] shall be upon you yes
[1:40:33] yes and upon the Israel of God or the
[1:40:35] people of God so if you walk according
[1:40:38] to this rule what is it that being a new
[1:40:40] creature in Christ that's what avails in
[1:40:41] Jesus Christ not what I do outwardly
[1:40:43] only you know it's not trying to conform
[1:40:45] and do all these things but it's an
[1:40:46] inward change of the heart a birth
[1:40:48] right then peace and mercy rests upon
[1:40:51] you but also upon the church
[1:40:55] who wants that to be so amen that you
[1:40:57] can you can just walk with God and
[1:40:59] people can have trouble and no peace and
[1:41:01] they just come to the atmosphere the
[1:41:02] Holy Ghost peace comes upon them and
[1:41:04] they're wondering Lord can I ever be
[1:41:05] forgiven for this thing can I you know
[1:41:07] will you forgive me
[1:41:08] and then mercy comes upon them
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:13] praise God
[1:41:15] and walk it you know there's just one
[1:41:17] hell say two direct one's life to live
[1:41:19] so so
[1:41:21] if if you realize this avails it will
[1:41:24] keep you on the straight and narrow
[1:41:26] Hallelujah
[1:41:29] amen but you see now the problem is
[1:41:31] people come to a spot where they say
[1:41:33] well the Revival's been so great you
[1:41:36] know God's done so much how can we keep
[1:41:37] this going
[1:41:38] well
[1:41:40] really the best way is um
[1:41:42] is this and Faith worketh by love that's
[1:41:45] what keeps the revival going you love
[1:41:47] the Lord you want to walk according to
[1:41:49] his word you know that you know what
[1:41:51] avails is I'm a new creature or a new
[1:41:53] creation in Christ Jesus but then people
[1:41:55] come to a spot say how can we keep this
[1:41:57] going and now this was I've been meaning
[1:41:58] to put this in for a few Sundays but
[1:42:00] here it is finally to talk about the
[1:42:02] Ephesian age now when it's all over
[1:42:04] watch and see if they're in the woods
[1:42:05] says after God has moved walking and
[1:42:07] living in it if they go through all the
[1:42:08] other and then don't walk in that word
[1:42:10] they can say they love God but their
[1:42:13] lives tell another story I wonder if
[1:42:14] John didn't see a lot of that before he
[1:42:16] died people saying they loved God but
[1:42:18] not a Banger's word oh Ephesian Church
[1:42:20] something's happening to you someone is
[1:42:22] trying to either add to that word or
[1:42:23] take from it but they are doing it so
[1:42:25] subtly that you can't see it they
[1:42:28] haven't made a move so big
[1:42:30] um you can see it but um out there in
[1:42:32] the open it is undercover and they are
[1:42:34] bringing in it by the way of reason and
[1:42:35] human understanding and it will take
[1:42:37] over unless you refuse it go back to
[1:42:39] Pentecost before it's too late he says
[1:42:41] but as usual people don't heed God's
[1:42:43] warning that Revival fire built upon the
[1:42:45] sacred word is so wonderful and the
[1:42:47] manifestation of the spirit so blessed
[1:42:49] that a little fear Creeps in and a
[1:42:51] Whisperer in the heart says how can we
[1:42:52] protect this truth we have what can we
[1:42:55] do to see this revival goes on that is
[1:42:57] when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and
[1:42:59] Whispers look you have the truth now see
[1:43:01] that it doesn't get lost organize it set
[1:43:04] up your Creed of what you believe put it
[1:43:06] all in a church manual they do it they
[1:43:07] organize they add to the word they die
[1:43:09] just like Eve did for taking one wrong
[1:43:11] word it's God's word that brings life
[1:43:13] it's not what we say about the word that
[1:43:15] comes but it's what God Said now don't
[1:43:18] put this on some church somewhere some
[1:43:19] organization this can be families it can
[1:43:22] be individuals we say now let's just
[1:43:24] standardize this this this faith
[1:43:27] you know starts off God moves in power
[1:43:29] you're so glad you get saved you begin
[1:43:31] to rejoice and just walk with God and
[1:43:33] you're like man how can I keep the
[1:43:34] momentum of this all right he say well I
[1:43:36] just I just I just I just make this
[1:43:38] little Comfort Zone in the word and this
[1:43:40] is me and this is what I believe and
[1:43:41] that's it that's putting it on a church
[1:43:43] manual right but we're gonna just keep
[1:43:45] walking with the word keep loving God
[1:43:47] remember Faith worketh by love I
[1:43:51] remember what he started he's gonna
[1:43:52] finish amen so we don't need to add or
[1:43:55] take away or make a man-made way doing
[1:43:57] things we can just walk with the word
[1:43:59] and God will vindicate his word amen see
[1:44:02] it's not what we say about the word that
[1:44:04] counts it's what God Said so I'm kind of
[1:44:06] we're kind of losing time here so I'm
[1:44:08] just going to skip a few things now
[1:44:11] remember the new birth is what avails
[1:44:14] you know we were at Christie and I were
[1:44:16] at um so so annalize and Gabriela were
[1:44:18] at the um in the zone cross-country you
[1:44:21] know all these kids running and you know
[1:44:23] I was thinking about David and Goliath
[1:44:24] because you know when kids are young
[1:44:25] parents look at the potential potential
[1:44:28] in their children
[1:44:30] they're going to be the biggest and the
[1:44:32] strongest and the tallest and the
[1:44:33] smartest and the most beautiful and the
[1:44:35] most whatever you look at these things
[1:44:37] and if you think about it how opposite
[1:44:39] David and Goliath would have been
[1:44:41] Goliath always would have been the
[1:44:43] tallest in the class right he was never
[1:44:45] the you know he would have been
[1:44:46] the first pick in every basketball game
[1:44:48] he would have been the first pick in
[1:44:50] every rugby game it would have been the
[1:44:51] first pick he would have been the anchor
[1:44:53] in the tug of war because you look at
[1:44:55] the class photo be like this thing
[1:44:56] Goliath like this right you think man
[1:44:58] he's going to be a soldier he's going to
[1:45:00] be our champion he's going to be the
[1:45:01] greatest one all of all of all of the
[1:45:03] Philistines would have thought this
[1:45:04] about Goliath because they saw the
[1:45:07] potential on the outside but then David
[1:45:09] was the opposite to Goliath I mean he
[1:45:12] wasn't even invited to the feast when
[1:45:13] the prophet Samuel came to Jesse's house
[1:45:15] he wasn't even included and maybe being
[1:45:17] brought before the prophet he was the
[1:45:19] one who wasn't thought of he wasn't
[1:45:20] considered none but yet when God saw him
[1:45:23] he said this is my king
[1:45:26] he had a potential that no one else in
[1:45:28] Israel saw but God saw the potential and
[1:45:31] not just the potential like it might
[1:45:32] actually happen but a potential as in he
[1:45:34] is the king already rights is not a
[1:45:36] could be maybe it's a in Jesse's house
[1:45:39] is my king how this he already was a
[1:45:42] king on the inside of the inside of him
[1:45:43] amen so so here are the actually the two
[1:45:46] champions of the world at that time
[1:45:48] one looked like a champion you often
[1:45:51] wonder what happened to the armor Bearer
[1:45:52] guy
[1:45:53] winners you know
[1:45:56] he probably got fired man he couldn't he
[1:45:58] couldn't hold the shield high enough
[1:46:00] anyway I just think about that but you
[1:46:02] know
[1:46:03] one's a champion on the outside one's
[1:46:06] the one who'd be considered the other
[1:46:08] one wasn't even considered even by his
[1:46:09] own family I mean but God looked beyond
[1:46:12] what his family saw what Israel saw and
[1:46:15] said that's my king that's a giant
[1:46:17] killer right there that one's going to
[1:46:19] take all the promised land he's he's my
[1:46:21] king and it's the same thing with you
[1:46:22] and our friends the world wouldn't
[1:46:24] wouldn't consider us for nothing amen we
[1:46:27] we're not the smartest we're not the
[1:46:28] tallest we're not the strongest we're
[1:46:30] not the most athletic we're not the
[1:46:32] richest amen but God looked beyond
[1:46:34] everything amen and he saw a seat of
[1:46:37] predestination on the inside of you and
[1:46:39] said these are my giant killers in this
[1:46:41] day I mean they're going to conquer
[1:46:43] every devil I mean they're going to
[1:46:45] overcome every trial they're going to
[1:46:47] walk out of this world Victorious robe
[1:46:49] to my righteousness washed In My Blood
[1:46:51] Holy white cause God look Beyond this
[1:46:54] and looked in here and said that's my
[1:46:56] bride oh this and then what does that do
[1:46:58] that now avails when you realize that
[1:47:02] David when he was anointed king he knew
[1:47:04] I'm going to the throne
[1:47:06] God will get me there sure God had to
[1:47:08] take him through many trials and
[1:47:10] distresses and heartaches and whatever
[1:47:11] more but he got to where God would have
[1:47:14] him go Hallelujah and so what happened
[1:47:17] that that that's why he could stand
[1:47:19] there and says who is this uncircumcised
[1:47:21] Philistine that defies the armies of the
[1:47:23] Living God hallelujah and it worked
[1:47:26] because it was revealed to David
[1:47:28] I'm the son of God I've been anointed I
[1:47:32] was just anointed by a priest I've been
[1:47:33] anointed by a prophet amen and he
[1:47:35] prophesied over my life and God's spirit
[1:47:38] was with me from that day on he's with
[1:47:39] me now and this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:47:42] is gonna die
[1:47:43] Hallelujah and that's exactly what
[1:47:45] happened wasn't it
[1:47:46] amen so we you know because why he was
[1:47:49] actually a new Creature if I put it that
[1:47:51] way in Christ Jesus it wasn't his height
[1:47:54] that Avail them it wasn't you know it
[1:47:56] wasn't how smart he was you know it's
[1:47:58] like brother bam says about you know
[1:47:59] Saul would try and give him his armor
[1:48:02] and he said that ecclesiastical jacket
[1:48:04] didn't fit a Son of God right so he
[1:48:07] couldn't you know he said he hadn't
[1:48:09] proved those things but he approved his
[1:48:12] sling
[1:48:12] he proved his stuff so you know the
[1:48:16] things that have been proved in our life
[1:48:17] we should keep using them until God
[1:48:19] gives us a different weapon
[1:48:21] amen what because he didn't use the
[1:48:22] sling after that I remember but but we
[1:48:25] can draw from testimonies of the past
[1:48:27] have God delivered there he's going to
[1:48:28] deliver now why because Faith worketh by
[1:48:31] love and I'm a New Creation in Christ
[1:48:33] Jesus
[1:48:34] Hallelujah
[1:48:37] amen see it was revealed to David
[1:48:41] it was revealed to David the others of
[1:48:44] Israel knew it could be done
[1:48:47] but it was revealed to David that's the
[1:48:49] big difference see you need faith hope
[1:48:52] and charity
[1:48:53] amen amen and you'll see Christ
[1:48:56] glorified in every situation
[1:48:59] amen see if it's revealed to you it
[1:49:01] doesn't matter how big the enemy may be
[1:49:04] Amy notice when it's revealed David
[1:49:05] become Fearless he says today I'll cut
[1:49:07] your head off amen that's our God by
[1:49:09] grace and that crucial moment when
[1:49:11] decisions had to be made that same God
[1:49:13] that produced The Grace in that day and
[1:49:15] drop that seed of faith in that little
[1:49:16] Hunchback looking boy being in his heart
[1:49:18] that same God in this crucial moment
[1:49:20] could take that woman from the
[1:49:21] wheelchair that man this woman had that
[1:49:23] child that little grain of faith is
[1:49:25] revealed to you I don't care how long it
[1:49:27] takes it's gonna happen
[1:49:29] amen because faith is not based upon a
[1:49:32] time
[1:49:34] Hallelujah
[1:49:35] now
[1:49:36] this word transfigured we're going to go
[1:49:38] back to our opening text correctly
[1:49:40] um then we're going to close this word
[1:49:42] transfigured this is where we get the
[1:49:44] word metamorphosis from so it's a
[1:49:46] transformation from one thing to another
[1:49:48] like a caterpillar to a butterfly so
[1:49:50] there's a transformation took place
[1:49:52] there amen now we are going through a
[1:49:54] transformation as well now if you want
[1:49:57] to go through that transformation you
[1:49:59] know you need the Holy Ghost you need
[1:50:01] God to live in your life more than a
[1:50:03] religious spirit more than saying you
[1:50:05] believe a Doctrine but God must come in
[1:50:07] and live and transform your life right
[1:50:09] and then now
[1:50:10] you go with hope faith and charity up
[1:50:14] the mountain right you're ascending and
[1:50:16] it will make you have a Transfiguration
[1:50:17] or a transformation see we're going from
[1:50:20] glory to glory I don't know if you've
[1:50:21] realized that the world has fallen but
[1:50:23] we're ascending right that's why the
[1:50:25] world seems more foreign to us now than
[1:50:27] it did maybe a year ago things are crazy
[1:50:29] yeah I was thinking we're 11 years old
[1:50:30] now
[1:50:33] you know imagine if we sat down 11 years
[1:50:35] ago and said let's imagine what the
[1:50:37] world's going to be like in 11 years
[1:50:40] I tell you what our guesstimation and
[1:50:43] what we see would have been poly polar
[1:50:45] opposite would probably say well we're
[1:50:47] going to be in the Rapture by then you
[1:50:49] know we're going to be in glory that
[1:50:50] would have been real good but you know
[1:50:52] we're here for a purpose right we're not
[1:50:53] here just to occupy time every day is
[1:50:55] important but you see now we're going
[1:50:58] see we're going see and so now the Lord
[1:51:01] is that spirit and where the spirit of
[1:51:02] the Lord is there is Liberty but we all
[1:51:04] with open face beholding as in a glass
[1:51:05] the glory of the Lord a change into the
[1:51:08] same image from glory to glory even as
[1:51:10] by the spirit of the Lord that word
[1:51:12] changes that word transfigured
[1:51:13] metamorphosis so we're going through a
[1:51:14] metamorphosis we are being transformed
[1:51:17] by the life that's within us remember a
[1:51:19] caterpillar has a life within it to
[1:51:21] transform it into a butterfly it doesn't
[1:51:23] go get something else and then become a
[1:51:25] butterfly it's already within it to
[1:51:27] change right that change is already
[1:51:29] within it and it's the same thing with
[1:51:31] you and I the change the body changes
[1:51:34] already within you I mean the Rapture is
[1:51:36] already Within You by the baptism of the
[1:51:38] Holy Ghost we don't have to go see it's
[1:51:40] not you get the Holy Ghost then you've
[1:51:41] got to go get rapture in faith no if you
[1:51:43] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:51:45] have rapturing faith the prophet says
[1:51:47] that when you get the Holy Ghost you
[1:51:49] have everything you need for your
[1:51:50] Earthly Journey
[1:51:52] Hallelujah so we can walk with
[1:51:54] confidence right now amen that I am
[1:51:56] Rapture Ready if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:51:58] I'm Rapture your Rapture Ready that
[1:52:01] should take off a lot of pressure why
[1:52:02] because what are vowels in Christ Jesus
[1:52:04] being a new creature
[1:52:06] hallelujah amen so same thing with us
[1:52:09] that transforming power just like a
[1:52:11] caterpillar has got transforming power
[1:52:13] we have transforming power amen that
[1:52:16] we've been changed from glory to glory
[1:52:19] Hallelujah so if you have that you have
[1:52:21] hope faith and charity you'll see Jesus
[1:52:23] Christ glorified
[1:52:25] every day in your life and in the change
[1:52:28] of the body
[1:52:30] amen
[1:52:31] Hallelujah I'm just going to finish with
[1:52:33] these couple of quotes and we'll
[1:52:35] then I will finish
[1:52:36] okay and so it is today we don't try to
[1:52:38] be some big persons I mean we don't care
[1:52:41] what the people say about us our our
[1:52:44] name ain't nothing it's his name our
[1:52:46] life it's nothing it's his life it's his
[1:52:48] power not our power and there's only one
[1:52:51] thing that we love to do is to see him
[1:52:53] glorified
[1:52:54] hey man and how can it be when he's
[1:52:56] glorified in Us by his resurrection
[1:52:58] that's in us we we see him represented
[1:53:01] again as he was today did you get that
[1:53:03] see our desire is not to be glue is not
[1:53:06] to be glorified our desire is not some
[1:53:08] big name our desire is not to boast some
[1:53:10] church or make more in the Sunday school
[1:53:12] or try and bring in hogtied push and
[1:53:14] offer a picnic party or bring Stars
[1:53:17] buttons or something or something else
[1:53:18] like that that's not our desire our
[1:53:20] desire is to see him glorify glorified
[1:53:22] not with self-pride but in us our lives
[1:53:26] to prove he's alive and living in US hey
[1:53:29] Macy's now if I can get myself out of
[1:53:32] the way so in William Branham is not
[1:53:34] even thought of and you not even thought
[1:53:36] of till we see Jesus glorified Among Us

[1:53:41] problems and what we're going through
[1:53:43] and maybe our humanity and all those
[1:53:44] things but we forget all about that
[1:53:46] that's why it's so important forget all
[1:53:48] about yourself and just worship Christ
[1:53:50] the Lord amen till we see Jesus Christ
[1:53:53] glorified among us see see him that's
[1:53:56] our desire that gives us quickening
[1:53:58] power it gives us joy to know that we
[1:54:00] are with them both flesh and bone of him
[1:54:02] being the Bride of him and seeing his
[1:54:04] same Vindicated methods proving in us
[1:54:06] that he's now risen from the dead
[1:54:09] see
