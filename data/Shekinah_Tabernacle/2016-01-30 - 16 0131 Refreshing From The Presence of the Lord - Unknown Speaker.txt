========================================

welcome to the house of god amen who's feeling good amen that's the way it's always good being a christian amen it's not always easy but it's always good amen he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you and when you go through life's journey you realize that's the truth and i think the whole walk is just to help us to have faith in god and trust him if you look at all your trials at the end of it we had more trust and more faith in god and he's a very big god and he knows all things and he's got all things under control and we just need to rest and trust him you know when we start off in our walk we get worked up over a lot of things and we think we need to sort a lot of things out but as we go on and on and on we realize the more that we just cast our cares and our burns upon him the more that he can undertake and it just gets easier because we don't have to carry so much or deal with so much because we can just lay cast our burdens upon him and he never fails he never fails and he just wants us to trust him so let's um let's just thank the lord this morning that we can be here and have the opportunity to walk in the light because it's a grand opportunity that we have to walk in the light amen heavenly father we're so grateful that we can be gathered here this morning and to know that you've called us lord that there was there was something in us to respond to that call and we we're lord we're eternally grateful for that and we just pray that you would um feel welcome in our midst this morning maybe last side the the things of the week and the cares of this life for a moment lord of the times they might seem like they're worthy of thinking about and dwelling on lord but one thing is need for lord and that's just to fix their eyes upon you lord and be filled with your spirit and to fellowship with you that's that's ultimately what is needful in our life so we just come to do that this morning just to cast all our cares and everything aside and just focus on upon you and let you speak to us lord through the minister to us through the word and and and just relax our spirits through the music lord maybe enter into that place of just total fellowship with you lord that you could just speak to us this morning and and change us and mold us and make us into the people that you desire us to be and that may we get ourselves out of the way and let you work in our lives this morning lord so i just pray you bless each one here bless those who couldn't make it lord and we just want to commit ourselves to you and we commit the service to your hands and we just invite you here in jesus christ's name amen amen praise the lord okay you can um stand this morning and we will do number 201 there is power in the blood would you be free from your burden of sin

and then is your one slow okay cool that will be a good lead into the worship so we'll do we'll do the music team have kind of been working on a song kind of but um this is our first time doing it but we just want to uh it's a new song and we just i just want to play it in a church atmosphere just to see how what what what the just what it's like um so this is when we we're a new one we're working on and we'll play it through once maybe and then the second time just join in and sing it the second time through and can you bring that up um brother ben has put it on on the projector i just want to read out some of the words and we'll just see how this one goes we've kind of been enjoying writing songs lately and we all sort of work together on it and um all the songs that we sing here someone else has written so we figure hey we'll just write our own you know well not like we don't like the other ones but if someone else writes them so can we that's kind of how i've always looked at it so the words are this um and it's called jubilee it's about it's typing the um you know in the old testament jubilee when someone had debts and they were sold then they had the jubilee year and typing that to our jubilee that when we heard the jubilee call we went free so the the verse the verses years and years i labored toil and tears were my meat since my debtors took me prisoner sold sold me to slavery but every day that i toiled the jubilee was drawn closer the 49th year was the longest year that i heard the trumpet sound and in the choruses and when i heard the jubilee i'll walk free and then the last one ain't going back to slavery because jesus has set me free the second verse because um years i spent in confusion i had ice but couldn't see the enemy had me stumbling in darkness spiritual slavery and i heard the prophet speaking i heard the voice behind the voice he opened up the word and let the light shine and said you can all go free and then this is the last piece just to get you to know what the song is like okay i'll probably be doing this on my own for most of the first time through sorry i need sorry about that i just need the words if you start to catch it just start singing along it'll be good good let's do years that years i labored toiling tears with my me since my deadest took me prisoner sold me to slavery but every day that i toiled that you believe was drawing closer the 49th year was the longest year then i heard the trumpet sound and when i heard the jubilee i walk free i walk free i woke free when i heard the jubilee i woke free and i ain't going back to slavery because jesus has set me free years i spent in confusion i had eyes but couldn't see enemy had me stumbling in darkness spiritual slavery but then i heard the prophet speaking i heard the voice behind the voice he opened up the word and let the light shining said you can all go free and i'm going back to slavery because jesus has set me free and when i heard the jesus has set me free jesus has set me free and he whom the son sets free he is free indeed jesus says set me free jesus has set me free jesus has set me free and he whom the son sets free i because jesus when i because jesus has set me free amen praise the lord should we do it once more stand up let's do it again we'll do it all together amen years and years so me to savory the 49th year was longest because

hallelujah well god bless you friends it's good to have everyone out today um if you could uh please turn with me to acts chapter three just gonna read a couple of scriptures from acts chapter three and then uh then from matthew chapter four and then i want to read one scripture from micah chapter seven so acts chapter three we'll just start from verse 13. i'm going to read down to verse 21. and so he says here now this is after the man at the gate beautiful was healed and so now peter begins to speak to the people he says the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers has glorified his son jesus whom he delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he were when he was determined to let him go but he denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and kill the prince of life whom god has raised up from the dead whereof we are witnesses and his name and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all and now brethren i what that through ignorance ye did it as did also your rulers but those things which god before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he has so fulfilled repent you therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the restitution i mean until the times of restitution of all things which god has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the word began i mean sorry since the will began then we'll go to uh matthew chapter four so notice he says that there have come at times of refreshing from the presence of god and i want to go into that a little bit today so matthew chapter 4 and read verses 12 down to verse 16. just for a bit of a context and we've got it then we'll go to micah chapter seven now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the seacoast and the borders of zebulun and nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isis the prophet saying the land of uh zebulun in the land of nephilim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the regions and shadow of death light is sprung up from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heave the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen and we'll just go to micah chapter seven and we're read verses seven and eight it's uh micah is after obadiah amos obadiah them are the minor prophets amen but just listen to listen to this he says therefore i will look unto the lord i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me rejoice not against me oh my enemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me amen you may be seated may the lord bless his word now i want to i want to talk about the times of uh so so the refreshing sent from the presence of the lord today and hopefully i just want to um maybe just yeah i really pray by the end of the service you'll appreciate a little bit more the time that we're alive in now we understand that that that god and his in his great plan as certain things happen at a certain time you know the law came at a certain time the prophets came at a certain time jesus was born died rose again at a certain time you know there was always season for certain things to happen and it says in ecclesiastes 3 it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven and so god god has a season that that certain things are going to happen and this time of refreshing that peter was speaking about here was was actually he was speaking of something that would come and i can say by what god is doing among us i mean worldwide we are living in that time of refreshing so you know it says in isaiah 55 and i'm just going to read some scriptures here um so in isaiah 55 10 and and we know this quite well it says for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not hither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give sea to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please it shall prosper in the thing we're into ascended so when god sends his word there's a specific purpose it is from sending his word and it always comes in a certain season and so there is a reason why why god would send a message in this end time and that and he has a particular intent why he would send it and we understand it's not just that we would understand the bible but it would actually liberate a people i mean it would open a people's eyes that they would not walk in darkness anymore but they would be able to walk in liberty and so this time of refreshing because you know we understand how peter said here that your sins may be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord so there's a time where the people's sins would be fully blotted out and that was in the times of the refreshing now that this if i just want to i'm just going to try and tie this all together but i just hope you bear with me now this word times in the greek it means a set or proper time it means also means an opportunity or a or a season so it's talking about a certain season where a refreshing is going to come from the presence of the lord and this refreshing in the greek it means it means a it means a recovery of breath and figuratively it means a revival and a revival is an awakening so when it says when this refreshing comes it will it is actually a revival comes from the presence of the lord amen an awakening comes upon the people and we understand that there has been sure there's been revivals down through the ages but there has to come a time where a revival doesn't just break forth and then die down and then break forth and die down but there comes a time where the people actually stay in revival amen and brother braham says he yo he says about the church world you know early i think it's early 60s or maybe late 50s he says the revival fires are going down but then he says later on keep that spirit of revival around you amen so for the church world the revival fires were going down and you can see that in church history where great healing revivals came upon the scene but then they all began to go down and they went towards either intellectual ideas or went off into fanaticism whatever they did and but then he said he says at the end of his ministry he says now the bride he says he says there's an awakening of the bride happening a revival of the bride he says he says you know he says uh you know you know the great paper the herald of is coming and it's still published today he says all they say is right yo all they print us fast and pray fast and pray sound and trumpet pray pray pray there's gonna be a new breaking of the day and he says why do they do that he says they're good people and being christians they feel the pull of the hour but he says they've missed the awakening of the bride amen they've missed the refreshing that's being poured out from the presence of god i mean to awaken the people so the the refreshing that he sends i say is linked to his word his word being sent is linked to the refreshing amen god always sends his word and then that accomplishes a certain thing and then he also says in joel he says it's in joel chapter 2 he says be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in your god and in the lord your god for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and i'll restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palm worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed so he's speaking prophetically of a time of restoration that would happen and this this restoration ties into these two rains a former and ladder rain and in the hebrew a former rain it means a teaching rain that's what the word former actually is is a teaching rain and then the latter rain is actually a harvest rain or a gathering rain so these two rains will actually merge together to to cause the crop to grow amen so in times past and that's why you can see you know you go back people have been in the meshes 40 years and then now you come in and you see people have been in the message maybe two years and they've actually grown to the same level amen where it took people 40 years to grow to a certain level of maturity people just two years have come in and they've come to that same maturity now why is that because there was a there was a former a teaching reign that fell but then there has to come a season whether whether whether teaching rain falls and then there's another reign of the spirit because we understand what he's talking about rainier he's talking about the spirit coming down and there comes a season where where that ladder rain or that harvesting rain they both run together so one time it was planted then then years later it's actually come to be grown i mean by ladder rain but now it's actually running together that those both rains are running together so so the word goes forth the teaching goes forth and then there's also a reign there that quickens that that word in the people it begins to grow amen and so this this is the season that we're alive and that's why people who come in nowadays they're just catching so quickly they just grow because those anointings those reigns are running together thank you hallelujah see to me it's so tremendous because we didn't have to you know god allowed us to be born in this hour and i'm talking about spiritually born i mean that we didn't have to maybe fight those battles that that people have been years have fought amen but we just came into this time where god says i'm going to pour out the latter and the former rain together and you know there's a time of refreshing amen and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with oil and wine your wheat is bread give us us to our daily bread and the fat shall overflow with wine we know wine is a stimulation caused by the revelation of the word amen and then oil is the anointing we understand that and he says i will restore so he says when these when these two reigns come together he says i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankworm the caterpillar and the palmer worm and we understand that that was the actually the antichrist coming in and chewing down the true true church into nothing and then it was grown again amen so he's saying when these two reigns come together this is all going to happen and we are living in this time amen we are living in this time because even the prophet he says he says in 53 he says he said in the last days i'll send down the reign in abundance like that both former and later reign will fall on this date and what they had back there plus what god's going to give us is right now at hand amen i believe with all my heart and i believe we're at the age of the battle don't you think so let's not push back but they want to push back let them push back but we're going forward amen it's ours god says it's yours now go on there and take it so he's saying that he's saying that he says he says amen he says now and what they had back there plus what god is going to give us right now at hand amen so he's saying it's going to happen this isn't 53 and then in 65 he says if they so this isn't things that aren't the beast is the is at the end of his ministry if they look back in the scripture and see what the messiah was supposed to do then they would have known him by the vindication that god through christ would reconcile the world to himself and to bring to pass all the promises that was of the messiah that he was to do jesus bore the record of that word making that word live for that day and i believe it's the same thing we live in today god bring record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do now we know that this is the day of salvation where god is calling man from the world from a life of sin unto a life of service and in the day that god has poured out his spirit from on high great signs and wonders are to to accompany the ministry of this day this is when the former and latter rain are falling together amen so he's saying this is the season now where this is taking place and we know that they're supposed to be great signers and wonders which in many great denominations this is turned down but i'm thankful for these open doors that i have had to come into an inspiration amen of he says to give a young man like your pastor here that's causing him so he's saying that so he was looking for it in 53 but says now it's falling together it means there comes a change in the season so refreshing as i said a refreshing is a revival amen so so that word refreshing as i said is as a recovery of breath or figuratively a revival to be and and to be a revival as an awakening now this may be a bit dreary but just just just just just hold on now in the presence of god unrecognized and he says this many times in his in his in his ministry where where he went and he stood by lake michigan and he saw that you know as a great storm had whipped up on the lake and then he says you know he says now what is happening to the lake and he realized the lake is having a revival amen so so it's the wind that comes down upon the lake caused the waves to whip up and so and he said he said there's no more water in the lake than before the wind begin to blow so there's not a it's not a adding to the lake but it's an awakening and stirring up of the lake and then when the wind comes down over the lake then all the all the trash and all the you know uh driftwood and whatever more that gets blown up on the bank amen so so so he says that this is what a revival does now he says that's what we need now he's speaking now he says a washing of unbelief onto the bank let the word of god have preeminences that's what we need a revival to wash all the unbelief out and all the bugs and superstitions and things come out and see that god's still god so he's saying no and a revival is to awaken a people and it actually pushes the unbelief oh so so when people when people become awakened i mean it pushes the unbelief off of them i mean that they're not carrying the unbelief anymore but the unbelief has turned to faith amen amen that they really believe and then it says let the word of god have preeminences so there are people when they turn from unbelief to faith what happens is this has becomes number one i mean this has this has pre-eminence you understand so that now when we when the word has preeminence that means when it becomes number one then people can stand upon the word alone and when a believer stands upon the word alone in faith then nothing will shake them i mean if you can stand upon not your feelings or not or not what you see with your eyes but if you can stand upon the word amen nothing can shake you nothing can shake a believer that's standing upon the word of god it doesn't matter how they feel they may feel upside down turned around about whatever more but if they can say this is what the word says and they stand there in faith amen nothing can shake them hallelujah so so a revival causes the people amen for all their superstitions because if someone has some superstition a superstition is having faith in the wrong thing amen and unbelief you can have faith in something that's wrong and if you actually do that's actually an unbelief amen because you're believing in the wrong thing amen but if you have faith in the pure word of god that's a very different thing it's like someone you know you know brother isaac wrote the song and if people actually say you're free i mean the gospel trumpet blows you're free but then someone actually has a superstition well i'm not good enough how can i be free and they wrestle with their humanity amen they're actually putting faith in the fact that they can't do it i mean they're believing the wrong thing amen but it's not the condition you know you know you go back in the old testament times when when someone was a slave they had to sell themselves into slavery or whatever happened the condition they are in when the when the trumpet blew had had no bearing on them going free it had absolutely no it there was no you know you know it didn't even come up into the equation in god's mind he said all you have to do is hear the trumpet i mean drop what you're doing and go back to what belongs to you that's all you have to do you don't have to weigh up you know well i've been this kind of slave and my inheritance is all the way over there and you know well i yeah i've been this kind of person and you know going into your backstory and this is what caused me to come into slavery we're all born slaves that's right amen it doesn't matter how that manifested upon the earth that's irrelevant i mean when you hear the trumpet just drop what you're doing amen and walk back to what belongs to you that's all you have to do because this member it's not the person in slavery that actually cause themselves to become free it's god's trumpet that is blown his word that's proclaimed i mean that is what causes the freedom hallelujah not the not the people amen it's our condition whatever we wrestle with don't don't bring that to the forefront amen just let the spirit of god brush that aside amen amen because the very reason if you've got something in your heart that you want to be free that you want more of god that means you have more of god to have amen because there can only be a deep in here longing in here if there's something out there to meet that longing that was there before it was in here hallelujah amen we always got to remember that now we read there in matthew chapter 4 about the verses of the people and they and they said and you know you're that sat in darkness now let's just go let's just go to isaiah chapter nine from where matthew was uh quoting from because the people the light the light that people see amen is tired that is the refreshing coming i mean because you could i'm sure you could agree when jesus became when god became flesh then god was about to open a great big gusher of eternal life a refreshing a revival was going to come i mean to awaken a people that that they were not meant to be whatever state they found themselves in before jesus came hallelujah the woman at the well she wasn't meant to be like that just life had caused her to go in that direction but that wasn't who she really was hallelujah amen that's not who we really are meant to be isaiah chapter nine now let's read this isaiah 9 and we'll read one to four he says nevertheless the dimness shall not be as shall not be as such as was in her vexation when at the first she lightly afflicted the land of zebulun in there in the land of naphtali and afterwards did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in the galilee of the nations the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shine he has multiplied the nation and not increased the joy they joy before thee according to the joy and harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil for thou has broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder and the rod of his oppressor as in the days of midian so he's saying so so isaiah prophesying here saying that when when these people that walked in darkness had seen great light and they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them has the light shine this is what's going to happen to these people amen that that the bird so so he is going to break the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder and the rod of his oppressor as in the days of midian now in the days of midian speaks of when gideon and his 300 defeated the people of midian and the people of the east amen so there comes it so so that was a liberation of the land you're with me amen there was a liberation of the land and so so there was a remember gideon he was hiding away in a cave wherever he was trying to thresh some wheat because the midianites came in the people of the east they just ate up the whole country so the israelites they were living in israel but they sure weren't in control of the land amen so they were believers they were believers in their inheritance but they were on the run from these other forces that came in amen so so it's possible to actually be birthed into the kingdom i mean to actually be standing in your inheritance but then you're on the run amen there's actually a a rod of the oppressor is on you i mean there's a burden upon you it is possible amen but then he says now when these people saw great light so there came a system where light came i mean in the times of the refreshing and so a light came and it broke it broke his burden and the staff of his shoulder and the rod of his oppressor now the days of midian as i said it was getting his 300 men they they they came to the camp of the of the midianites and the people of the east and they separate themselves around the camp and you see how they how did they defeat that enemy amen he was instructed to to to uh shine the light and blow the trumpet amen that's how that's how they found me that's how they defeated the enemy in that day so they so they blew the trumpet and they shone the light i mean so they blew the gospel trumpet and shine the light amen amen how do you how do you see the enemy defeated blow the trumpet amen hallelujah and shine the light amen this little light of mine i'm going to let it shine this life that's in me i'm going to let it shine i won't say to it i'm not going to let satan blow it out amen you blow the trumpet amen share the word amen in wisdom share the word and that's what causes the yoke of the oppressor to be broken amen shine the light this is a day where the light needs to be shot hallelujah i'm not just talking about on the streets but but in our homes i mean among our friends i mean at work shine the light amen hallelujah sound the trumpet because it's the word that sets the people free amen that's how they did it and it was a jubilee for the land in that day in a way because the land was freed from the enemy and they went back into their possession i mean shine the light friends shine the light now this this refreshing scent from the prince of the lord sets the people free and brother abraham and christ is a mystery god revealed he says this he says he so he's just i'm just coming halfway through a thought but he says well they say now wait a minute brother brown you're talking about the old testament it says he's the same yesterday today and forever it's the full revelation of god if god ever says anything he can never change it he's the way he always magnifies it not change it the law was magnified not change magnified whosoever commits adultery shall be guilty of death but whosoever now magnified looketh upon a woman to lust after her he never changed the commandment he magnified it remember the sabbath day keep it holy one day in a week now he magnified it the rest comes from keeping the spirit of god precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little hold fast to that which is good for stammering lips and other tongues while i speak to this people and this is the rest that's the refreshing from the presence of god amen and so and so he says now the coming of the holy ghost in the end time is the refreshing come from the presence of god amen amen so when so so the light shines the word shines amen and it causes the people to receive it in faith and they receive the holy ghost and they enter into rest it's a refreshing that's poured out amen so it sets the people free and that's why this yoke you know you could say that the rod of our oppressor was was broken i mean you can take isaiah 9 because he says all right he says shalom he says good morning it's sunup i mean the light shining the wood has been made manifest so he's saying now here comes a season that's come you know we've had we've had seven church ages and remember there was there were seven years of sabbath for the year of jubilee that's 49 yeah i mean i mean yo yo yo every year i mean seven years was a sabbath to them you know in this and then after the 49th year was a year of jubilee and then now we've come down seven church ages that's right amen we've come down seven church ages and then what happens now is because you know when we read the seventh church age jesus says behold i stand the door and knock so he's kicked out of his own church so there comes a time of the ladies and church age where jesus is on the outside of that church age and that was you know yo that happened 50 odd years ago he was kicked out because instead of them accepting jesus the word who was declaring himself they took their creeds and dogmas and two can't be in control so jesus was kicked out because they took a lie and they're now worshiping a lie so what happens now is is if you you know if you study the message brother brown speaks about a bright age at the end of 1965 and you say well how can there be a bright age because there's only seven ages well it's an age within an age and then you just take like the modern era there was the era of the motor car and then the airplane then the jet plane then then there was space flight in the atomic age you know now we're in the age of the inter you know you're entering all these different things it's all different eras both in the same span of time amen excuse me so he's saying now this bright age he says he says that now because an age where we're where god is you know you know where god is that's where god is dealing so if he's kicked out of the way you know kicked out of the lady you're seeing church age where he has to be dealing somewhere and that's why now that's why the prophecy is now now we're in a bright age because he's calling a bride out as many as open the door and then in hebrews chapter 12 i believe it is it says let us go beyond the camp amen and suffer his reproach so he's actually a calling come out from where you are go beyond the camp amen and then go because remember he he died without jerusalem he died without the camp amen so we have to go with from wherever we are we're to go out to where he is amen so now he's so he's saying that now we are in a we are in a bright age so as i said there's been there were seven year cycles of sabbath every every seven years was a sabbath and then the fiftieth year so after seven seven times seven is forty nine in the fiftieth year is the jubilee i mean so so after seven church changes i put it that way now comes a time of jubilee amen now comes a true time of jubilee where the people do not go back into slavery i remember they keep walking in liberty amen and this is the time of the refreshing that's a saying if you can recognize a day and now and what god is doing for you i mean i think you'll appreciate this age a lot more because some people they say it's so dark it's so vile and why did i have to live in this age sure it's dark and vile but don't look at the darkness look at the light i mean look at the look at what the light has done for you hallelujah because it's sure it's dark sure it's terrible but a light shining a liberty is being sounded amen where people can walk in freedom hallelujah that we don't have to walk and be you know slave to sin nature or or something that tries to blind us down you know if the devil tries to keep you down by something just recognize his rod is broken amen the yoke of the oppressor's done away with whom the son is set free is free indeed amen not partially free not on a parole or or on um what is it uh bail none of those conditions we're free indeed and all you have to say is yes lord i come amen amen that's all you have to do he says this there's on the rising of the sun he says now who is the son of man i'm just taking one quote where he speaks about the bright age it is in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and of all the teaching that we have and the confirmation of the word of god by the word of god by science by wonders we see today it's in the book of luke here i've just quoted luke 17 30 and malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we're acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy ghost right among us and giving us life amen as christ was the first ones arise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept and the bride coming of christ coming out of the church there'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheath what was the sheath the first one to come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheath hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time they will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders he did back there because i live ye love also speaking to his wife i mean that's you by the way because i live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest and as i say he's to be waved again in the last day amen so he say and and he's actually saying he is being waived amen he is being demonstrated and it's not just remember that at the times of refreshing we're living in a times of refreshing and i'll say his word is still being waived i mean that same god that was there is here i mean the same god that called them back there is calling you hallelujah the same god that has actually caused them to walk in freedom has caused you to walk in freedom i mean the same god that caused them to grow up into maturity is is maturing you amen hallelujah amen we're living in a time of refreshing from the presence of god hallelujah we're not here just just just trudging along but god is doing things i mean god is molding and shaping us he's working on us hallelujah where are free people today amen at times of refreshing as i said that was a time when the jubilee was going to be amen hallelujah amen we're not bound amen we're not bound by unbelief hallelujah or some or or something in life amen you say well i'm carrying a few heavy bags just drop them i mean they don't belong to you they never belong to you just drop them hallelujah now we understand in the book of acts now that the people when when when they came out of the upper room that was a time of refreshing amen those people became free before they went into the upper room they are still bound with sin nature i mean peter tried to believe and he had some revelation now the christ the son living god but then when the pressure came down he cursed and he denied the lord three times and and and when he took the sword in the garden he wasn't just trying to wound the guy he's trying to chop his head off amen and then he just gets discouraged saying i'm going to go fishing again amen and jesus after he rose here without converted strengthen the brethren amen so here was one a sincere who believed and he actually had had had some faith but there wasn't there was no power yet to defeat that sin nature that was in his life amen so he was still a slave amen he was still a slave to that sin nature he was born with but then on the but then in the upper room now another life came in amen hallelujah eternal life came in amen that same one that was jesus said i'm not gonna just be with you i'm gonna be in you hallelujah so now he says you know when the day of you know when the day of pentecost had fully come amen there came a sound from heaven like a russian mighty wind you know shook the place in the pillar of fire came down separated itself upon the believers and now that was a refreshing that had been sent from the presence of god hallelujah because it awakened them to what they were amen and they were set free that day and we must have the holy ghost otherwise we'll still be in bondage amen even at our good attentions it takes a full surrender to god amen amen for that rest because they had not yet entered into the refreshing or the rest yet i mean because i just i just tying those two things together but then on day of pentecost the refreshing came and they were free indeed and then when they came out because the question is now you know you know brother brown makes a statement this is an invisible union he says in another woman so he's speaking of the church but he's going natural to his spiritual all the time and if a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat or something she's got the mother something it it's their nature but to bear a child for a husband and raise it to the service of god that's entirely out of her line she should be so disgraced if she did uh if she did by her sin loving society in 1965 type of woman a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngins around here no she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination they had one like that and one of the churches why they throw her out right quick why do you let such stuff go on so you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but you don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belongs to that throw her out at the next council she can't have it so you don't so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind the word can bring forth born of the spirit of god it has the spirit of god in it no intellectual church joining creed going bob here painted face is not such a thing as that you don't find it in the word of god you find an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god hallelujah so he says now he says they don't want an old-fashioned where where god comes in i mean then a life is lived out that's what they're saying it says they don't want it see miserable creatures they think that she is hallelujah but that is the only he says that's the only kind the word can bring forth i mean where life comes in you know something happens and now but we understand some people say well brother braham said this he says he says and is this a sign of the answer he says the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation amen so some people just take that and they say you never feel nothing and you just continue on but that's not what but that's not the whole quote because he says comma but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did and my question is now the book of acts is it the acts of the apostles or is it the acts of the holy ghost and the apostles is it the acts of jesus and the apostles amen and it was so we see when the day of pentecost had fully come their jubilee was coming now amen when they staggered out of the upper room you know the people you know others mocked saying these men are full of new wine and actually in truth they were full of new one because new wine has life and it's still still fermenting i mean so they were they were they were full of new wine hallelujah they were stimulated because they recognized that god had done something for them amen that they would actually be made free indeed and that's why when when peter stood up he said he said ye men of judea and all them that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you but this is you know we are not full of new wine i mean we are not drunken as you supposing it's just about the third hour of the day but he says this is that spoken by the prophet joel that he'll pour his spirit out upon all flesh amen to peter went into the word and said this is that amen this day this scripture is fulfilled amen where the life of god would come into a people hallelujah that they'd be set free glory amen to you sorry he says he's saying he's saying we you know in a way they were drunk hallelujah amen because i remember when i used to drink i mean all the inhibitions go i mean conservative people who are quiet aren't so quiet anymore all the loud ones are still loud sometimes they go quieter hallelujah everyone just and then everyone forgets about maybe maybe how rich or poor they are their differences i mean and they're just all united by one thing hallelujah and they just enjoy what they're doing amen and if that is just the counterfeit what about the real holy where where people can come together and then and and then and they take off the mask they don't try and put up some kind of stand of well i'm a good christian everything's fine i remember they can just come and just be real amen then they can just be united and recognize the same life amen why do people yeah birds of a feather flock together people who like to drink whiskey they congregate together people like to drink beer they congregate together wine drinkers they congrat together and they have fellowship around what they're drinking hallelujah it's the same thing with the bride of christ i mean today the reason we are together is because we're drinking from the same fountain amen we're enjoying the same wine holy worst we're enjoying the same life hallelujah amen and we can we can rejoice in these things because it's a reality hallelujah that we are living in a time of refreshing amen a time of liberation for the people of god hallelujah this is this is this is the hour that we're alive in amen we're living in a time of refreshing where god is pouring out his spirit i mean god is opening his word hallelujah this is where we are amen that that truly we say our light has come amen we're not sitting in darkness i mean we're not stumbling around you know what does the bible say and how should we do things and and you know is there really a holy ghost we know the holy ghost is real amen we feel we're failed as quickening power amen we feel his reality amen harley we where you know you know how it is you know sometimes you can get a little dry and then you begin to compare yourself with other people and then you even begin to say well i wish i could do what they do out there but then when you come into the prince of god i mean all those things they just fade away and you say oh god i'm so glad i can come into your presence hallelujah i'm so glad that there's nothing between me and you anymore hallelujah and all you want to do is worship him holy why because there's a refreshing comes amen and the things that the devil tries to tack on to you they just washed away hallelujah they just washed away i mean a lake is not a lake you know the trash in the lake is not part of the lake amen the lake is just clear water whatever life's in the lake but all the man-made stuff that's thrown in that's not part of the lake that's right and we have to recognize the things that we wrestle with they're not part of you amen they're not water they're not part of the lake hallelujah they're just they're just things that try and you know you know you know have you ever seen a lake i remember i was in papua new guinea where my parents were is active volcano and sometimes the sea would just be covered in pumice just your small small pumice you know it floats just just cover the whole bay just from the volcano now that's not part of the sea amen but it's something that's been added too and we know when you put trash when you put over the water it just blocks out the sunlight that's trying to go into the water amen but then if the sea tried to take ownership of that pumice well then the water's not i mean the light's not going to shine down amen and you need and you need light for life to be there amen so the same thing with us if the devil tries to put something on you as i said on wednesday he tries to put a shadow or a question across the word yeah he has god said and that's putting a shadow because remember in god is no darkness at all amen but the first question the first shadow he put on the word it was the serpent talking to eve yeah hath god said remember if your path is covered in shadows it's harder to see where you're going whether it's fully lit up you can just walk as bold as you want to hallelujah so don't let the devil try and put a shadow on your walk yay is the message really real we'll just go listen to the last 15 minutes of virtually every service amen and he says if i be a true servant of god and if i've said the truth let him come and prove that it's true in front of thousands of people over and over again i was you know i was driving in my car it's hearing a prayer line he just called someone out of the audience this is your name this is your address you know you know you live at whatever whatever whatever whatever street in this city accurate you try you try and do that it'd be a it'd be an absolute you could never you know yo imagine the the the you know the statistical uh amount of zeros of the percentage chance of getting that right if you bring in thousands of people never seen before then you try and guess where they're from and their street number and why they're here i mean it was about four or five things just just listed down and you think no man can do that they didn't have wireless things and people talking and you know they didn't have that stuff they didn't cook it up i mean it was god and he was declaring i'm here to set my children free there's a time of refreshing that's here i mean you're living in a season where we're not slogging i'm glad we're not slogging down and you know you know down in the dark ages or or in luther's age or even the early pentecostal age or even when jesus was here sure it would have been wonderful to walk the shores of galilee but this is a greater day this is a greater day amen we're we're where brother speaks about the bride coming of christ i mean god coming and dwelling in his children hallelujah that we wouldn't go down in death amen but the revival would continue burning on hallelujah until these bodies are changed hallelujah god is pouring his spirit out amen don't miss what he's doing sometimes we we it's so simple but yet it's so you know but it doesn't change the fact that it's god amen and that's why now i read there rejoice not against me oh my enemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me amen amen and if it was a day where where there's darkness it's today but as if it was a day when there's light shining it's today amen there's never been a day like this day amen so just remember you may be sitting in darkness you know the devil may have because remember the enemy at the end is not a person amen it's a spirit anointing a person that is the enemy amen if you look through carnal eyes you say it was this person this person and this person no if you look through spiritual eyes it'd be it's satan it's satan it's satan i mean it's it's not your brother or sister or family or or person whoever it is it's the devil amen and then you can say in your heart rejoice not against me my enemy amen when the light when i when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me when i fall i shall arise hallelujah and we know we understand this is a day where the scripture has been fulfilled arise and show for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee hallelujah this is the day where this scripture has been fulfilled amen refreshing has been poured out amen amen as always always remember if the devil's trying to bog you down you know say don't rejoice against me my enemy i shall arise hallelujah this bride is rising up amen i'm talking about around the world the bride is rising up in power hallelujah i mean individually it's not it's not just a prophet it's a many-membered body amen we can come together and love and function as a as as as one body one mind and one accord hallelujah that's why it's important the scripture says to confess your faults one to another not your sins your sins are to god but your faults you confess one to another why is that that we can pray one for another it's not some gossip channel or this person that doesn't no no no it's not that it's going to someone saying i need prayer for this amen and if they're a spiritual person they won't condemn you for it or put you down a little bit they'll say this person you know a person who bottles things up i'll say this is actually carnal that's right amen and it may be not there it's the environment they're in has caused them to become this way but someone who's actually spiritual can actually recognize this is the devil trying to bog me down i'm a son or daughter of god i'm not meant to be bogged down by these things this is not my inheritance and but then the devil's warring against me and so a spiritual person will go to another one and say i'm i'm fighting this i'm wrestling this pray pray with me amen that's a spiritual person amen amen hallelujah that's absolutely a spiritual person because because if someone comes to you and say i need prayer for this if you're spiritual about it you'll recognize this is a son or a daughter of god coming to me amen and they're not really trying to contact me they're trying to for me they're trying to contact the god in me amen and so you should be able to reckon you know it's like it's like israel fighting different tribes are fighting whatever they're doing different tribes went to help different tribes fighting amen it didn't you know and so we're to help one another and that's why we're built differently some people are more prayer worry some people are not it doesn't mean one is less spiritual than the other one amen it doesn't mean that the one is greater you're like which is greater peter who stood there with boldness and preached to thousands or one of the other apostles that was a real prayer warrior who was greater well some people can't leave they look at peter say oh i wish i could be peter stand there like a line of boldness and then and lay down the truth but a spiritual would say lord whatever you make me i want to be part of your body i mean and the function that i meant to function in amen so our light shining remember when i fall i shall arise amen and that's why it says i'm not sure i think it's in galatians i might be wrong that when someone when a backslide sign comes back restore them in this i think uh yeah i might be totally wrong with the scripture but it says restore in a spirit of meekness amen so we have to be able to recognize that if someone falls in any way it is the devil that is that has twisted them in some way and dragged them out amen you have to you have to look you have even even if they made the choice to do it amen you have to look beyond well that person deserves this and they have to do penance and they have to do whatever more no restore them if they if they genuinely repented about it they're sorry about it amen we should you should be able to look and even if they're going in the wrong direction if you've got christ in your heart you won't condemn them for the direction they're going in i remember you'll pray for your brother you'll pray for your sister because if remember the if the lights come to you you'll want to shine it to someone else amen why did why did gideon blow the horn and shine the light i mean to sit to set the whole nation free amen and if our light is shot a lot you know you know we're called to shine the light and sound the trumpet that that others would come into a time of refreshing as well i mean because unless people recognize what's going on they can't be part of it amen so we must always and and i'll just close with this you know always look don't look at the person remember because if we've been awakened we want others to be awakened you know if we want yo if we enjoy the praise of god it's automatically now i want others to to enjoy the presence of god and if i'm walking in victory i want others to walk in victory amen and so we must always look beyond what we see and look at people and say they are the bride they may be wrestling with things because sometimes we can walk we can have years of light uh yeah you know what brother ram says families everything's in cycles families have cycles you have a day time everything's going well there's suddenly a night cycle after a family and everything's kind of falling apart and then there's another day breaks so sometimes you have good times and bad times it doesn't mean you're suddenly walking in unbelief sometimes you just darkness comes and the devil fights you in all these different things amen so you got to recognize it for what it is amen and then pray accordingly and talk to that person accordingly amen because sometimes sometimes we should say you know you should know better but some but you forget you should have known better whenever something happens sometime amen so you gotta you gotta approach it the right way that's right you understand amen could we have some musicians to come please amen because you know we don't just want to sometimes if we take the wrong approach we take the wrong approach because we're looking at the wrong way amen does it say we should pray one for another not in a gossip way because some people go to prayer meetings just to hear the gossip they do there's always going to be people like that unfortunately but then others go because they want to really pray because they see because if part of the body you know if i have an infection in my hand the rest of my body is suffering amen and then if the infection gets worse and the rest of my body will get worse amen or if i have a wound or something that's the same thing with us collectively if part of the bride is hurting we're actually all hurting amen but then what happens is if we look at it carnally we say well that's just that church and that's their problem this is you know we're not like them but you got to recognize they're part of you you're part of them amen so we have to you know we have to look beyond boundaries and and oh that's that family you know that person was always that way you know no no don't don't look at that i mean look at you've got to look at the fact that it's the devil fighting that person amen this is a time of refreshing a time of jubilee and maybe they just haven't fully that's right you know come into that jubilee yet amen amen amen let's just let's just pray shall we gracious lord jesus father i just feel lord that's it dear lord i just pray you'll help us father when we lord this is a time of refreshing dear god and we're so glad it is a time of refreshing that sent from your presence lord it wasn't sent from some bible school it wasn't sent from even jeff even even from jeffersonville

seed sitting in that woman and father we thank you lord you didn't bring into account her formal life lord there wasn't even part of it lord her sins didn't really mean anything to you lord it didn't cause you to back up or or even even resist going there he said i need to go there father because there was one that needed liberation there oh god there's one that needed to feel the refreshing they

your hands o lord father we thank you and we praise your great name and jesus christ and lord i pray you just come down among us lord father media every need lord you see the lord the things that we

we thank you for that oh god in jesus christ's name we thank you amen amen can we sing that song that other song you wrote we're not for uh nail test let's just stand let's just sing this you chose me
