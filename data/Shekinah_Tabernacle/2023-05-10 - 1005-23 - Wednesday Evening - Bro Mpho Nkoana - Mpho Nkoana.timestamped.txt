[31:28] standing
[31:29] and we welcome each one and tonight I
[31:31] would like us to speak about Prada Med
[31:34] if you can capture it I said here
[31:37] I will I will tell you now
[31:40] get so disorganized
[31:42] and when all the time all the time you
[31:44] thought that you were organized
[31:46] my house is your dwelling Lord
[31:49] my house is your dwelling Lord
[31:53] and the the thought I want us to Take
[31:56] Along
[31:57] cleanliness
[31:59] cleanliness
[32:01] you know there's so many things happened
[32:03] around the house right
[32:05] and um but today I just want us to pick
[32:08] on just to follow the thought of
[32:10] cleaning cleanliness Ah that's the
[32:14] thought I would like us to think and to
[32:15] take along as we go along but as we go
[32:17] along I would like each one
[32:19] each one of us
[32:21] you know I have never had
[32:24] brother Heinz
[32:26] that a family
[32:29] they just leave their house dirty
[32:32] and they just go and clean at another
[32:34] man's house another family's house I've
[32:37] never heard about that
[32:38] I've seen people helping each other to
[32:40] clean houses but I've never seen a
[32:42] family just leaving a house deity
[32:46] if it happens correct me and then they
[32:48] just go and clean someone else's house
[32:52] so it means cleaning a house
[32:54] is important your house
[32:56] then you come and help me to clean mine
[32:58] is that right
[33:00] if you are coming first to me then we go
[33:02] to your house it's okay that is
[33:04] acceptable but the key message here is
[33:07] my house is your darling father
[33:10] can I keep it clean
[33:12] it's your house we understand when we
[33:15] read the word of God that
[33:16] and so many things happens around the
[33:19] house we built it
[33:20] from scratch new new house my sister
[33:23] welcome my sister did you mention your
[33:25] name and we built a new house
[33:28] even a new house
[33:30] after being built before we go in within
[33:32] it can we believe it
[33:34] brother Isaac we built a new house new
[33:37] out of the box as we say brand new
[33:42] if I was in Africa I was going to say
[33:43] brand new
[33:46] a brand new house
[33:48] that looks great and great
[33:51] before you move it before you move in
[33:55] you clean it
[33:56] how come
[33:57] what kind
[33:59] it means this thing called cleaning is
[34:01] very important
[34:03] and we also realized that
[34:06] you know after building and after doing
[34:09] all all you know decorating and after
[34:13] after doing all sorts of things and
[34:15] putting everything and allocating the
[34:17] rooms and and on a good foundation the
[34:19] house is certified and we are now living
[34:21] in the house we realize that this house
[34:24] from time to time it gets dirty
[34:27] even if it's a new house a modern house
[34:30] it accumulates debt
[34:32] as long as human beings lives in there
[34:35] it's even worse if no one lives there
[34:37] did you know that
[34:40] a house is even worse when nobody lives
[34:43] there it actually dilapidates even
[34:45] quickly have you noticed that even the
[34:48] grass they know that you are not there
[34:50] you'll just find the grass in the
[34:51] kitchen growing
[34:52] because there's no movement
[34:55] huh insects they quickly realize that
[35:00] there's no human here
[35:02] and they they start to take habitation
[35:04] in the house
[35:06] but as long as human beings are there
[35:08] even though they would love to come even
[35:10] though the grass would love to come but
[35:12] they cannot they cannot grow but the
[35:15] dust still comes through
[35:16] where does this dust come through when
[35:18] my house is insulated
[35:20] when my house is double what do we call
[35:22] those double those windows
[35:25] double glazed in Africa we don't have
[35:28] the double glazed
[35:30] double glazed
[35:33] clean in and out
[35:36] but we find that just hardly five after
[35:38] one week
[35:40] we have to clean a game
[35:42] we have to buy vacuum cleaners yeah in
[35:44] year out why
[35:48] because the aspect of cleaning
[35:51] goes together with where people dwells
[35:55] to Bath
[35:57] why don't we just bath once a week
[36:01] so tell you why don't we just part once
[36:03] a week
[36:04] and and leave it but I see that and I
[36:08] noticed that I bath every day
[36:11] some people bath twice a day
[36:14] because the aspect of cleaning being
[36:17] clean is important
[36:21] are we together
[36:22] so now
[36:24] if we are cleaning these bodies
[36:27] ah assistant we are cleaning them three
[36:30] times I don't mean you
[36:34] and now we buy what they call
[36:41] what do they call this thing of spraying
[36:43] deodorant
[36:46] hey that word is a subject of discussion
[36:49] in my house a deodorant
[36:52] you buy a deodorant a big one
[36:56] preach
[36:58] not just
[36:59] so spray three times a day
[37:02] and then we clean the house we vacuum it
[37:04] you know Sister Sister Priscilla loves a
[37:07] clean window
[37:09] clean
[37:12] things for for these physical things
[37:16] we are doing that
[37:18] and we don't really pay much more time
[37:20] attention and the focus and zealousness
[37:24] on our
[37:25] spiritual house
[37:28] isn't it true brotherheim that the Lord
[37:31] said this is his house we're living in a
[37:33] three-roomed house isn't it we you your
[37:36] soul yourself you you not this
[37:40] you're living in a three-roomed house
[37:42] it's you
[37:43] it's your soul your spirit and this
[37:46] outside man who is actually just depend
[37:48] on your soul really he depends on you if
[37:51] you leave he just lay down there is
[37:54] there three aspects of ourselves
[37:56] so we are focusing more on this outside
[37:59] man even our physical houses we've built
[38:02] a mansion
[38:03] I was telling some people that you know
[38:05] there in Somerset West in Cape Town
[38:06] there was a house even the way we care
[38:09] so much about our health and what we
[38:11] breathe and the sunlight not facing
[38:13] house
[38:14] there was a house there that could tend
[38:17] with the sun you know
[38:18] it belonged to Mike Schumacher if I'm
[38:20] not mistaken you know you know the
[38:22] raising guy it belonged to him
[38:24] he that house the first floor was
[38:26] telling you
[38:28] with the sun if the sun goes to the West
[38:30] it goes you have sunlight
[38:33] sunlight
[38:36] and because they don't want house mice
[38:38] we want sunlight one fresh air we want
[38:40] we want one to be ten one to ten our
[38:49] to our inside house do we clean it
[38:52] regularly
[38:54] remember
[38:56] the physical types there
[38:59] spiritual when the children of Israel
[39:01] left Egypt and they were traveling can
[39:04] you see yourself
[39:08] that's symbolic Journey which was real
[39:11] for them is as real to us today
[39:14] can you see yourself can you see
[39:16] yourself leaving Egypt can you picture
[39:18] yourself crossing the Red Sea
[39:20] and crossing the Red Sea it in the
[39:22] manner drinking from the Waters of Mara
[39:25] that was bitter now he's sweet can you
[39:27] can you see yourself standing on the
[39:29] border of goddess Vania before they
[39:31] cross the river
[39:33] if you can see yourself in that Journey
[39:35] that means everything that happened to
[39:37] them should happen to me and to you the
[39:40] only things that this time is more
[39:42] spiritual application
[39:44] let's look at it
[39:46] let's read
[39:48] Joshua 24.
[39:50] and I'm not going to be long hopefully
[39:52] let's read Joshua 24
[39:54] from verse 14 to system to to verse 15
[39:57] sister
[39:59] Talia
[40:05] okay otherwise I can read it okay sure
[40:09] thank you so much brothers for that
[40:11] men that
[40:13] is
[40:15] Golf Course
[40:19] now therefore fear the lord
[40:23] and serve him in sincerity and in truth
[40:26] this is Joshua talking to the people
[40:29] telling them about exactly what I'm
[40:31] telling you about the issue of the house
[40:34] listen to him and in truth
[40:37] now he says serve him in sincerity
[40:41] underline that and in truth
[40:44] put away the gods the gods which your
[40:47] fathers served on the other side of the
[40:50] flat let's pause there
[40:52] we said you see yourself going out of
[40:54] Egypt can you
[40:57] cross the Red Sea now on the other side
[41:00] of the river they were saving the Gods
[41:03] them me and you were saving the gods of
[41:07] the amorites
[41:08] we're saving the gods of the jebusides
[41:11] the side of the river are we together
[41:14] now and in Egypt and they served he the
[41:17] Lord
[41:18] on the other side of the flood and in
[41:21] Egypt and serve ye the Lord he's telling
[41:24] them leave those gods and serve ye the
[41:28] Lord next verse
[41:30] and if it if it seems evil unto you to
[41:34] save the Lord
[41:36] I don't know how possibly can this be
[41:41] if it seems evil unto you to serve the
[41:45] Lord choose you this day whom you will
[41:49] save
[41:51] decide
[41:52] whether because you see before you go
[41:54] the let's pause you need to come to a
[41:56] point of decision
[41:58] because if you don't it's going to be
[42:00] actually challenging and difficult for
[42:02] you to to continue cleaning your house
[42:05] it's going to be difficult it's going to
[42:07] be challenging just to take a broom and
[42:10] sweep
[42:11] because we have not made up your mind
[42:14] you haven't decided that today I've
[42:17] chosen to serve God it's going to be
[42:20] difficult because you have not decided
[42:22] you will still clean but we are going to
[42:25] force you
[42:26] we are going to beg you you are going to
[42:29] be reminded to pray
[42:32] because you have not really decided you
[42:35] do say that you have decided but
[42:38] you are reminded you set a reminder
[42:42] remind me
[42:44] to pray you know if I tell you I've
[42:47] always I always give this example

[43:39] limousine
[43:41] off to not even Willington Airport
[43:44] to the military airport I don't know if
[43:46] there's a military airport here then you
[43:49] are going to be chattered to go to the
[43:51] coronation of the King Charles the head
[43:55] of the United Kingdom it's addressed to
[43:58] you David Lee

[44:15] Livingston ready for you now
[44:18] what is going to happen in your mind
[44:20] you've got the tickets what will be
[44:21] happening leading to to that event
[44:24] are you I'm telling you now you can bet
[44:27] you can take me on on this one even the
[44:29] day you're going to leave the reminder
[44:30] of the watch is not going to be
[44:32] necessary
[44:34] you're going to wake up on the dot three
[44:36] hours before you leave James
[44:39] I said before and I don't want to repeat
[44:41] I don't know what kind of suit you're
[44:42] going to buy
[44:44] because that's very important
[44:47] that's the once in a lifetime Oppo
[44:50] opportunity that you can never afford to
[44:55] lose
[44:56] now here is an opportunity
[45:00] to spend eternity with God
[45:02] the only thing that is seemed to be
[45:04] disturbing is that you are sitting in
[45:06] flesh but everything is being done
[45:09] everything has been sorted and paid and
[45:12] done for you
[45:14] now the only thing is that for you
[45:17] just for a little bit longer
[45:20] persevere
[45:22] to be feathered
[45:24] just until you go
[45:26] how does that sound
[45:29] does that sound exciting
[45:31] so you don't need to be reminded to
[45:33] clean the house let's let's hear what
[45:35] Joshua told them because he can see they
[45:38] are pulling their legs man
[45:41] you know when someone is pulling their
[45:43] legs
[45:44] you you struggle to get them excited
[45:47] about the things of God but the moment
[45:49] you say hey let's go racing
[45:52] the same guy he's jump he jumps this
[45:54] high
[45:56] let's go play volleyball and beat the
[45:58] children brother Ed oh come my brother
[46:02] sorry brother but hey
[46:05] let me bring something spiritual oh yeah
[46:09] yeah
[46:09] then the will Goes Pop why
[46:13] are you are we excited enough
[46:16] now listen to Joshua
[46:18] it's not like Joshua does not love them
[46:20] Joshua was there with these people from
[46:23] day one from the day they left Egypt
[46:26] until now he's now giving them what we
[46:29] call an ultimatum an iot Mater he says
[46:33] there and he says choose you this day
[46:36] whom you will save whether you the gods
[46:39] which your father said is reminding them
[46:44] that were on the other side of the flood
[46:46] or the gods of the amorites
[46:49] and in whose land you dwell
[46:51] because you are dwelling in the land of
[46:53] the amorites right now
[46:55] because you found them there
[46:58] huh
[46:59] remember you you defeated them you took
[47:01] this land it's your land now but it's
[47:03] actually there it was there land before
[47:05] you
[47:07] now he says in whose land you dwell but
[47:10] as for me
[47:12] and my house
[47:13] we will save the Lord
[47:16] what does saving the Lord entails the
[47:19] previous verse he spoke about sincerity
[47:21] can you just go back a little bit one
[47:23] more respect
[47:24] sincerity and in truth
[47:27] is it the first time you hear this word
[47:29] even in the New Testament that if you
[47:32] Worship the Lord in spirit and in truth
[47:36] are we together so that means those are
[47:39] the elements the aspects of ensuring
[47:41] that your house is clean every single
[47:44] day
[47:45] now you sweep you clean you sweep you
[47:48] clean your vacuum every day
[47:50] in this in this house that's what I'm
[47:52] supposed to do and it's a challenge but
[47:55] it's actually if I I twist the coin it's
[47:58] not much of a challenge because he said
[48:00] while you are in that house I shall be
[48:03] with you and I will be with you would
[48:06] you like the king
[48:08] I can tend that drama again and say
[48:11] let's say you don't go to the king
[48:14] the king comes to you
[48:16] to your house
[48:20] I don't know how that house is going to
[48:21] look like
[48:24] I'm telling you
[48:26] you will even rfbf
[48:29] taranagi
[48:31] Tauranga
[48:33] all our sister churches we will call
[48:35] them to come help us to clean this house
[48:37] because the king is coming
[48:40] the king of England coming to the
[48:42] anguana house ah
[48:45] I bet this is history
[48:47] it's a serious matter
[48:50] and I'm telling you
[48:53] because it will come on newspapers even
[48:56] the king chose this young man
[48:59] and his young wife and their family
[49:04] then you'll just hear a deacon call me
[49:06] brother just tell the newspaper to write
[49:07] also who Fellowship said Shekinah
[49:10] Tabernacle
[49:13] because it's an important event are we
[49:16] together
[49:17] I'm not trying to make a joke all I'm
[49:19] trying to say is that the magnitude of
[49:22] that event
[49:23] now the King has come once to dwell on a
[49:28] daily basis in this house
[49:31] a king
[49:33] shouldn't we the least we can do
[49:35] because you can clean yourself literally
[49:37] technically me can keep myself clean I'm
[49:41] a sinner I'm not able I don't I don't
[49:43] know I'm not I don't have the capacity I
[49:45] can't overcome Satan by myself
[49:47] but the king says I will be with you and
[49:51] I will be in you inside you
[49:54] to help to clean that house disinfected
[49:57] all the time where is the Cockroach free
[50:00] house
[50:04] resembles a demo when I see it
[50:08] [Laughter]
[50:10] a fly is even worse
[50:12] I had to buy a gun for the Flies
[50:15] because when I think the brothers saw a
[50:18] vision one time and there was there was
[50:20] a moth
[50:21] there was a moth
[50:23] I don't like moths
[50:25] maybe because of that there was a month
[50:28] and that month
[50:29] he was seeing a vision and it was just
[50:31] going around so wobbling so fat and it
[50:35] still flies
[50:36] demonic spirits there are certain
[50:39] animals that that shows demonic spirits
[50:41] certain animals are more associated with
[50:43] demonic spirits we'll talk about that
[50:45] one day and others are more associated
[50:48] with the Holy Spirit you know like a
[50:50] dove
[50:52] can you just hear the word Duff a white
[50:54] one
[50:55] not an eagle
[50:57] those are animals that are associated
[50:59] lion lamp but the moment you tell me of
[51:03] a bed
[51:04] or their tortoise
[51:07] he saw such kind of things and now I
[51:10] lost my check
[51:11] so the king is coming to clean I mean to
[51:14] stay at your house you are going to do a
[51:17] magnificent job but the king is even
[51:19] here with you say hey I will be inside
[51:21] you you are going to I'm telling you
[51:23] brother and sister you're going to make
[51:24] sure that you ask the lord lord
[51:27] Solomon said give me wisdom give me the
[51:31] spirit of discernment to be sensitive
[51:33] enough to your spirit it's about being
[51:35] sensitive enough to the spirit of God
[51:37] that your spirit should be able
[51:41] to pick up anything
[51:45] we allow so much through our filter to
[51:48] come through it's not like we just say
[51:50] we want to be dirty but we are we asking
[51:53] God enough to say Lord Lord let my
[51:55] vacuum cleaner be better than the sun
[51:57] that's some someone you know that he
[51:59] knew some someone it takes even the
[52:01] smaller let my let my filter not allow
[52:04] that
[52:06] that's what we should be asking Mama
[52:07] Christine to say Lord I want to be so
[52:09] sensitive in my in myself I can't do it
[52:11] but but help me to be so sensitive to
[52:15] your spirit
[52:16] that I don't offend the spirit
[52:19] on a daily basis if you do that I'm
[52:22] telling you you're going to find that
[52:24] the cleaning of your house is going to
[52:26] be so enjoyable
[52:28] you're living in a non-reminded
[52:30] environment no one reminds you
[52:34] the spirit himself reminds you let's
[52:37] move on a bit
[52:38] and read Matthew
[52:41] 12 25. I'll read it for you quickly and
[52:45] Jesus knew their thoughts this is now
[52:47] when he found them at the at the House
[52:49] of Prayer
[52:50] in the House of Prayer he found them
[52:52] selling marketing advertising
[52:56] doing sin in the house of God
[53:00] and Jesus knew their thoughts and said
[53:02] unto them oh sorry no that's not the one
[53:04] sorry this is a different one
[53:07] you know ministers we sometimes we mix
[53:10] up scriptures but I'll tell you that
[53:12] thought but this one
[53:15] is saying
[53:16] the house divided against itself
[53:20] you you cannot be you cannot serve God
[53:24] and save more money
[53:27] at the same time and allow them to dwell
[53:29] in the same house
[53:31] as clean people cannot afford to live
[53:35] with rats
[53:37] in the house the same house we are
[53:39] living a master plan because they eat
[53:41] everything those guys
[53:42] these guys they damage everything ask
[53:45] kiratula to tell you what we did
[53:46] whenever we were living in a lifestyle
[53:49] block when we find them
[53:51] we were treating them but hey man it's
[53:53] like those things they come we were
[53:56] really really dealing with them rats
[53:58] because they destroy everywhere they
[54:00] pass so now we God cannot afford to live
[54:05] with evil spirit in this house
[54:09] which dog are we feeding more
[54:11] daily
[54:13] which one
[54:14] okay you can only know that he asked God
[54:18] to give you a sensitive spirit because
[54:20] look brothers and sisters we are here on
[54:22] Earth we are somehow connected to this
[54:24] earth although we are not of this Earth
[54:26] but we work here God found it in him to
[54:30] bring us here
[54:32] so that we can bring glory and honor to
[54:34] him and demonstrate and manifest his
[54:37] will so we are here we can't help we
[54:39] can't run away from there but while we
[54:41] are here we need a specific wisdom we
[54:43] need a specific anointing from him to
[54:47] help us how to live
[54:49] imagine I come here and I don't find no
[54:52] brothers I don't find no sisters I find
[54:54] no one no you know no one who welcomes
[54:58] me I'll be a lost man at least for the
[55:00] first two years
[55:01] trying to make friends and even so you
[55:04] need someone who knows the territory
[55:06] someone who understands the terrain of
[55:09] this place to tell you what to do how to
[55:12] do who to talk to where how am I right
[55:15] so he said he's gonna be with us now you
[55:18] need him to make sure that you you are
[55:22] so sensitive to the spirit
[55:24] they say a prophet
[55:26] I don't know why I read this
[55:28] the way he's built physically you know
[55:31] he's diaphragm you know I die from
[55:33] this there's a certain part of just
[55:35] above or below the lungs when you
[55:37] breathe it goes it regulates how you
[55:39] breathe so a prophet is diaphragm
[55:43] is is building a certain way almost I
[55:46] don't know when he breathe or what I
[55:47] don't know about he's able to be able to
[55:50] enter into the Unseen World easily by
[55:53] vision
[55:54] he's built differently
[55:56] that's how I prove it so with me and you
[55:59] need to be to have that part of God
[56:01] that's that makes us to be sensitive to
[56:04] the spirit you know there's a party
[56:06] there's a verse in the Bible that says
[56:09] you know your brother just lied to you
[56:13] after lying to you he says oh no wasn't
[56:15] I joking
[56:17] you know that verse I I've just
[56:19] paraphrased it wasn't I joking so it
[56:22] means that even to the very day-to-day
[56:24] talk
[56:25] the way we think
[56:27] the way we think about our brother our
[56:29] sister
[56:31] this is very serious
[56:33] I don't control my thoughts yes you do
[56:37] the thoughts the pastor taught us that
[56:39] the thoughts are like flying dates
[56:41] you can allow them to build a nest or
[56:44] not huh so that's like the thoughts you
[56:47] can
[56:48] Devils can never be able to build where
[56:50] the spirit of God Reigns they want the
[56:54] demons will it's like there's fire
[56:56] around you there's a certain presence
[56:58] around you that the certain Junior
[57:00] demons don't come closer to you
[57:03] you know there's Junior and senior
[57:05] demons certain Junior demons you know
[57:08] they know I can't go to this man because
[57:11] there's always a certain presence
[57:14] this house is so clean it's so clean
[57:17] that even a fly you know flies don't
[57:20] like clean places you don't know this
[57:24] a fly don't like a clean place is for
[57:27] Real they like a place where it's dirty
[57:29] if they can come into a clean Place
[57:32] they've identified something that they
[57:34] need to contaminate
[57:35] they want to contaminate it they don't
[57:37] like cleanliness that's like demons when
[57:41] they come when it's clean it's because
[57:42] they want to contaminate they prosper
[57:45] and and and and and and and and
[57:48] multiply where it's dirty
[57:51] I'm not saying we are deity brothers and
[57:53] sisters if this is the hard talk please
[57:55] understand me that the thought that I'm
[57:57] trying to bring across is that a
[57:59] continually clean Christian
[58:03] huh
[58:04] the presence of the Lord remains in that
[58:07] person's life
[58:08] and that's the whole idea why we have to
[58:11] continually make sure that we are
[58:14] clean that we are sensitive through the
[58:17] spirit otherwise this house will not be
[58:20] able to serve the purpose which it is
[58:23] made to do to save are we together
[58:26] listen to this I will read for you
[58:29] now the man of God here in the message
[58:32] called
[58:33] a blessing prophet
[58:35] preached in 1956 November 25th in the
[58:39] evening
[58:40] he says that's right coming to ask God
[58:43] for something
[58:45] and looking like a jezebel
[58:48] this is harder this is the hard saying I
[58:51] agree
[58:52] it's a hard one but it has to be hard
[58:55] because only the truth will set you free
[58:59] if I come here and just say oh no no the
[59:02] prophet sorry about what the man of God
[59:03] said no no no no that's what he said
[59:06] it has to be solved Lord give me a
[59:08] lubrication to swallow what you are
[59:10] saying so that it can build me and help
[59:13] me
[59:14] looking like adjustable coming to ask
[59:16] God something
[59:17] what we need today is a house cleaning
[59:21] I'm not I didn't make a presentation but
[59:24] I can give you this paper after after
[59:26] church
[59:27] is the house cleaning and a heart
[59:30] warming of prophets of God who will
[59:32] stand in the Pulpit yeah
[59:35] and I call the thing out
[59:37] and and tell that's right and what's
[59:40] wrong
[59:40] in the priest of gospel without
[59:42] compromising until Sinners fall on the
[59:46] floor and a weep till God sends the Holy
[59:48] Spirit to clean up their life isn't that
[59:51] awesome
[59:53] it's so great when a sinner
[59:56] because we are all sinners we have we
[59:58] have agreed at the beginning right we
[1:00:00] are only saved by grace isn't it great
[1:00:02] when we see one who who whom we used to
[1:00:05] look like come to God
[1:00:08] I think it's an exciting thing
[1:00:10] I think it's a wonderful thing if we can
[1:00:12] accept that point that is so awesome to
[1:00:15] see somebody saying brothers and sisters
[1:00:16] pray for me here
[1:00:18] sister Maggie come come pray for me
[1:00:20] myself I'll come to your house there is
[1:00:22] this issue that has been bothering me

[1:00:31] sister hey what is it and I tell you I

[1:03:37] me than all life
[1:03:40] meaning that
[1:03:41] nothing on this Earth matters Lord
[1:03:45] even life here doesn't matter
[1:03:47] your love your loving kindness it means
[1:03:50] more than life to me amen that's why
[1:03:54] it's important for us to hear these
[1:03:55] things
[1:03:56] my soul says after thee like I was in a
[1:04:00] dry land
[1:04:01] and like the heart
[1:04:03] for the water broke my soul must find
[1:04:06] the
[1:04:08] one day I preached a sermon here
[1:04:11] and I said
[1:04:12] there is a problem
[1:04:15] when
[1:04:16] you don't
[1:04:18] fast for God
[1:04:22] there's a problem
[1:04:24] and that's it there's a problem it does
[1:04:27] not mean that you are the problem no no
[1:04:28] it means there's a problem and it needs
[1:04:30] to be addressed what does test for God
[1:04:32] mean thirsting for God it means you are
[1:04:35] yearning you want more of God not
[1:04:37] talking more of having God wanting
[1:04:41] really getting desperate
[1:04:43] you know I had a desperate person
[1:04:46] A desperate person
[1:04:48] will beg you
[1:04:50] will tell you things that hey David if
[1:04:53] you can't help me man
[1:04:54] I'm finished
[1:04:56] please my man
[1:04:57] David I'll do this for you you know me
[1:04:59] for a long time it will beg you because
[1:05:02] he's desperate
[1:05:03] A desperate request
[1:05:06] is full of tears I don't care whether
[1:05:08] there's not who is listening to me I
[1:05:11] need this
[1:05:12] and this means life to me
[1:05:17] desperation will make you to get things
[1:05:20] from
[1:05:22] because you mean business
[1:05:24] so A desperate God A desperate person
[1:05:27] will make God to move to him because God
[1:05:31] can see this one
[1:05:33] is not turning back
[1:05:37] um
[1:05:38] I wanted to read this one and finish
[1:05:41] I didn't finish that part
[1:05:43] and my soul test after the like our
[1:05:46] senior dry land and like the heart for
[1:05:49] the water broke my soul must find thee
[1:05:51] or perish
[1:05:54] Tabernacle gets to that place
[1:05:57] the little isms will drop off out of the
[1:06:00] door the differences will be all settled
[1:06:03] out Christians will be Christians
[1:06:07] a Christian must be a
[1:06:09] Christian
[1:06:11] I don't know if that sings deeply
[1:06:14] a Christian meaning a Christian
[1:06:16] must not be
[1:06:18] mixed
[1:06:20] you know a mixed Christian
[1:06:24] depends where we are
[1:06:27] depends on the mood and the weather
[1:06:29] and the circumstances
[1:06:32] in the situation
[1:06:33] you know a Christian is not it's not
[1:06:36] like that a Christian is a Christian
[1:06:41] it will be a sport that will be talked
[1:06:44] of around the world when any
[1:06:45] Congregation of people will thirst for
[1:06:48] God in that manner
[1:06:50] they thy love kindness is better to me
[1:06:54] oh
[1:06:56] Lord than life
[1:06:58] I want to conclude
[1:07:01] I want to read for you again from
[1:07:03] another message called the message of
[1:07:04] the audition Church
[1:07:06] this was preached in 580609 certainly we
[1:07:10] have certainly we have that's true not
[1:07:13] to hurt you
[1:07:15] because sometimes we speak things that
[1:07:17] are
[1:07:18] hating
[1:07:22] the word of God is Not Meant to
[1:07:24] it's not only meant to comfort
[1:07:27] sometimes it meant to comfort you but
[1:07:29] hating you
[1:07:30] I don't know if I can put it correctly
[1:07:32] okay the Lord realized that this ship is
[1:07:36] is running too much around he took it
[1:07:38] and then he broke his leg
[1:07:41] Now isn't it isn't that hating
[1:07:44] but actually that is love
[1:07:48] it makes sense
[1:07:50] how can you take a sheep and break his
[1:07:52] leg
[1:07:54] is hurting but if you look at look at it
[1:07:56] with spiritual eyes look at it from from
[1:07:59] Heaven's perspective
[1:08:02] not from Earth's perspective
[1:08:04] to hit my boy is Lavo
[1:08:06] brother Ed
[1:08:09] and hitting them with a smile
[1:08:13] and
[1:08:15] daddy listens to this oh did you hear
[1:08:18] that
[1:08:19] and you say that is love
[1:08:22] now you're hitting me
[1:08:24] but actually if you go to the root of it
[1:08:26] a two dead will be it will be paining
[1:08:28] him
[1:08:31] it will be out of love
[1:08:33] right it was out of love that that
[1:08:35] Shepherd really broke that foot because
[1:08:38] after breaking it he then put
[1:08:42] what do you call a moon boot here today
[1:08:44] put a moon boot on it
[1:08:46] and I applied the balance of gilia
[1:08:49] on it
[1:08:50] after breaking himself
[1:08:53] in other words he says my boy my
[1:08:55] daughter don't don't
[1:08:58] hear I want to hear by me there's jail
[1:09:00] calls there
[1:09:01] there's hyenas there's wolves are you
[1:09:04] hearing Mrs
[1:09:05] so that's what he said
[1:09:08] and then now the prophet of God says
[1:09:11] here
[1:09:11] that's true not to hurt you but to tell
[1:09:14] you the truth we've got to clean up
[1:09:21] I'm not going to identify your
[1:09:23] uncleanliness and tell you this this no
[1:09:25] no each one of us
[1:09:27] if really we want the Rapture to come to
[1:09:30] go with the bridegroom
[1:09:32] if we really wants to if we are
[1:09:34] realizing what is happening around us
[1:09:37] we are realizing what is happening
[1:09:38] around New Zealand we are realizing the
[1:09:40] financial markets we are realizing the
[1:09:42] wars and the rumors of wars we are
[1:09:44] realizing all the earthquakes and we're
[1:09:47] realizing all the all the natural
[1:09:49] disasters we are realizing that the time
[1:09:53] that the Lord has spoke about is here
[1:09:55] and is here and now if we are realizing
[1:09:58] that if we are realizing that the love
[1:10:01] of many is growing works
[1:10:04] is diminishing if we are realizing that
[1:10:07] the age we are living in is more about
[1:10:09] me I and myself all those things and
[1:10:13] many many more the the cup of iniquity
[1:10:17] is getting full
[1:10:19] is full
[1:10:20] for the brim that is why even when they
[1:10:22] drink coffee they want it full
[1:10:24] you know dreaming out out full
[1:10:28] because we are living in that age where
[1:10:29] the cup of iniquity
[1:10:32] full everything is vomit everywhere
[1:10:35] is vomit you can you can't walk
[1:10:38] wherever you look whatever you do
[1:10:41] so how are you going to work as a
[1:10:43] brother and there's a vomit everywhere
[1:10:45] nakedness everywhere you're a sister a
[1:10:47] Son of God and you are right working
[1:10:49] right next to the vomit you need a
[1:10:52] special
[1:10:54] special inspiration
[1:10:56] and that can only come if you are really
[1:10:59] sensitive to the spirit you are really
[1:11:01] under the inspiration of God on a daily
[1:11:03] basis otherwise your you have to find
[1:11:06] yourself one day swearing yourself oh I
[1:11:08] didn't mean that sorry
[1:11:09] swearing
[1:11:13] the Bible says those things should not
[1:11:15] be heard even from us
[1:11:17] not not even them those things they
[1:11:20] should they like the likelihood
[1:11:23] the appearance of anything like that
[1:11:25] must not even be heard next to us
[1:11:29] this is just a reminder brothers and
[1:11:31] sisters
[1:11:32] go sorry go to have a Revival and tell
[1:11:36] and get all the the backs out of the
[1:11:39] bugs out of the thing before
[1:11:42] this is the prophet he says we've got to
[1:11:44] get out all the bugs out
[1:11:47] God will ever come in
[1:11:51] if we remove all those things
[1:11:54] now
[1:11:55] now it's not meant to
[1:11:57] demoralize you it's meant to let you
[1:12:00] pause and say Lord
[1:12:02] check me
[1:12:04] check me Lord because this is life and
[1:12:07] death
[1:12:09] certain decisions I take
[1:12:11] they're questionable
[1:12:13] certain certain movements that I make
[1:12:15] are questionable Lord remove my pride
[1:12:19] you know this if there's one thing that
[1:12:21] God hates
[1:12:22] if there's one thing that God hates
[1:12:25] it's a proud heart
[1:12:27] and that Spirit of a proud heart is here
[1:12:30] today in laodicea we are very proud
[1:12:33] people
[1:12:34] full of proud Pride
[1:12:37] and you check it doesn't just come boom
[1:12:40] proud don't know you know there's proud
[1:12:41] that is mature that you see this man he
[1:12:44] can't even walk properly
[1:12:45] that is that is now Pride it is maturity
[1:12:48] now how does a pride Spirit proud Spirit
[1:12:51] come to a believer
[1:12:53] sneaks in
[1:12:54] he he
[1:12:56] check it and you can only see it if you
[1:12:58] ask for that Spirit of sensitivity get
[1:13:00] the spirit of this element to see when
[1:13:03] the Devil comes closer to you Lord help
[1:13:05] me to see these things to see the demos
[1:13:07] when they come because when they come to
[1:13:09] me and you they don't come when like
[1:13:10] when they're good in unbeliever no the
[1:13:12] devil won't come to you and say hey I'm
[1:13:14] the devil
[1:13:16] today I'm visiting you he will never do
[1:13:18] that he's gonna start me something small
[1:13:20] my girl even in school something we call
[1:13:23] in English negligible
[1:13:25] something innocent
[1:13:28] and said oh and and he'll give her even
[1:13:31] a reason
[1:13:33] to say oh
[1:13:35] really
[1:13:40] no this is
[1:13:44] watch
[1:13:47] the response check the fruits check the
[1:13:49] attitude
[1:13:51] how I think of my sister
[1:13:55] or my brother's actions even if they are
[1:13:58] wrong
[1:13:59] that does not supposed to determine my
[1:14:01] attitude towards them
[1:14:03] I'm supposed to actually double the love
[1:14:06] you know that's lies that I spoke about
[1:14:09] where you put butter this side and this
[1:14:11] side
[1:14:13] yeah when the devil shows me something
[1:14:16] about I'm now supposing to apply more
[1:14:18] dosage of honey in my love for him
[1:14:21] I like that attitude I like the attitude
[1:14:24] that when someone
[1:14:26] when the devil because it's not actually
[1:14:27] your brother is the devil using the
[1:14:31] weakness of your brother or your sister
[1:14:32] to attack to make you conflict to make
[1:14:35] some a beef between you to make some
[1:14:37] it's not literally your brother that is
[1:14:39] why the Lord said forgive them for they
[1:14:41] don't know what they are doing
[1:14:42] that is why Stephen could say Lord
[1:14:45] forgive these guys
[1:14:47] they don't know they don't they are not
[1:14:49] even at Year One
[1:14:50] you know Year One we've got great great
[1:14:54] one grade two but before grade one and
[1:14:56] grade two we've got grade r
[1:14:58] we call it Reception class
[1:15:01] and we've got great RR
[1:15:04] those guys are not even at grade r
[1:15:07] they are blind
[1:15:09] the man is being killed he's being
[1:15:12] stoned he says Lord forgive them
[1:15:16] if we get to that man
[1:15:19] well the devil wants to make me think
[1:15:21] about a brother this way
[1:15:24] and I kick his tooth so far
[1:15:28] that he knows that with that he's not
[1:15:30] going to come to me even if my brother
[1:15:32] is wrong because I know if my brother is
[1:15:34] wrong it's still you devil
[1:15:37] I'm telling you how can you if you find
[1:15:39] blaming with other and the devil you
[1:15:41] know a guy who just come in the group
[1:15:43] and we find that we are fighting since
[1:15:45] he arrived here
[1:15:48] the devil must not come between me and
[1:15:51] you and then me and you are fighting now
[1:15:53] all these years who were friends but now
[1:15:55] we are fighting because we got a new
[1:15:57] visitor here why now I've got thoughts
[1:15:59] about David
[1:16:01] and David you know how the devil works
[1:16:03] this is how he works okay at least to me
[1:16:05] I don't know you you if you relate with
[1:16:08] this example you tell me
[1:16:10] you must check
[1:16:12] if the devil brings a wrong thought to
[1:16:14] your mind particularly about your
[1:16:15] brother
[1:16:16] more often than not
[1:16:20] he attacks both ways
[1:16:22] your brother could be having a similar
[1:16:24] thought or a similar a related demon
[1:16:27] could also be attacking your sister or
[1:16:28] your brother
[1:16:30] what he wants to do he wants to make to
[1:16:31] make the meeting conflict because he
[1:16:33] wants to cause something he knows if he
[1:16:35] just attack me attack me and my brother
[1:16:37] is just not caring or not not there
[1:16:39] there'll never be a conflict that's how
[1:16:41] the devil went but especially between
[1:16:43] husband and wife and especially between
[1:16:45] people that are close when he thinks
[1:16:48] about when when the devil attacks you on
[1:16:50] something he most likely check
[1:16:53] ask ask ask ask your friend what were
[1:16:55] you thinking just us expose the devil
[1:16:58] you'll find that if he's honest or he's
[1:17:00] honest you tell I was thinking that
[1:17:02] you're actually wrong about this
[1:17:03] the same thing was similar that the
[1:17:05] devil is attacking you towards him
[1:17:07] that's how he works
[1:17:09] most of more I've seen it in young
[1:17:11] people in groups I've seen it in
[1:17:12] marriages at least in my marriage I've
[1:17:14] seen it
[1:17:15] the devil attacks my wife and attacks me
[1:17:17] same thing
[1:17:19] I blame her she's blaming me of
[1:17:21] something
[1:17:23] who's wrong who's wrong none of us is
[1:17:25] wrong he's the devil
[1:17:27] so that's how he works all the time at
[1:17:29] work everywhere
[1:17:31] because it's even easier with
[1:17:33] unbelievers
[1:17:34] for us if we have got a discernment we
[1:17:37] can quickly see that ah my boss is just
[1:17:39] being attacked then you you you go above
[1:17:42] and you deal with it you you cover her
[1:17:45] with with messy you know so let's close
[1:17:48] with this
[1:17:53] um
[1:17:58] stand at the door
[1:18:01] you say you interfere with my private
[1:18:03] life this is now some of us sometimes
[1:18:08] tell the minister tell the pastor tell
[1:18:11] the deacons stop interfering in my
[1:18:13] private life
[1:18:14] there it is see
[1:18:16] well then you have a little another
[1:18:19] little door called Pride I did not even
[1:18:22] see this part
[1:18:23] oh my don't do temper with that now look
[1:18:27] brother I think is so much today all
[1:18:31] right in is your private life you say
[1:18:33] you've got no business busting in on my
[1:18:36] private life that's what you are telling
[1:18:39] Christ
[1:18:40] because there's no way in which I'm
[1:18:42] gonna come and stand here prayed up
[1:18:44] asking God Lord take everything about me
[1:18:47] aside and then I come and I touch on
[1:18:50] different things of different people how
[1:18:51] did I know
[1:18:52] how did the minister know
[1:18:55] now if I said no no no don't you touch
[1:18:58] on that private stuff
[1:19:00] or we have a more resentful Spirit a
[1:19:02] resentful attitude a slight softer
[1:19:05] resentfulness
[1:19:07] we are doing it to Christ so but this is
[1:19:10] to say hey Lord check me all the time
[1:19:13] even in my my inner inner in a bedroom
[1:19:17] check me there right are we together
[1:19:20] you've got to know business busting on
[1:19:22] your private life that's what you are
[1:19:23] telling Christ I'm talking from the word
[1:19:27] the word speaks for itself that's right
[1:19:30] this is from the message to loudisha
[1:19:33] 580609 I didn't
[1:19:36] paraphrase it I just read it for you
[1:19:39] and then in closing my brothers and
[1:19:40] sisters I want to say it is time for us
[1:19:42] to check
[1:19:44] it is time for us to
[1:19:46] take everything that disturbs us from
[1:19:48] seeing
[1:19:50] and say Lord Open My Eyes Open the Eyes
[1:19:53] of My Heart Lord
[1:19:56] you remember it was Zechariah in his
[1:19:58] house
[1:19:59] that he had been loyal and true wanting
[1:20:01] Waiting for God to give them a child and
[1:20:04] the angel Gabriel came to the house
[1:20:07] to the way
[1:20:08] to the house where did he come
[1:20:12] to the house
[1:20:14] are you with me Brothers I'm finishing
[1:20:16] this is the last quotation but be with
[1:20:19] follow me he came to the house it was a
[1:20:22] vision Mary who was who had lived clean
[1:20:25] and pure the Visionary where at that
[1:20:28] house
[1:20:29] right and waiting for a promise of God
[1:20:32] that he said that he sent an angel to
[1:20:37] right
[1:20:39] now he says the prophet here talk about
[1:20:42] running around with the world and fled
[1:20:44] with the world and then expect to see
[1:20:46] angels and have Miracles done is out of
[1:20:49] God's program
[1:20:53] you must live right clean up the house
[1:20:56] clean up your habits clean up the things
[1:20:58] of the world get rid of your cars and
[1:21:02] Wealthy Association get ready and then
[1:21:05] the angel of God can speak and say fear
[1:21:08] not it is high
[1:21:11] amen
[1:21:13] are we Amen in this I'm Amen in this I'm
[1:21:17] saying Lord if it's me please do it to
[1:21:20] me today

[1:21:42] find people who are wrong
[1:21:44] people who need help people who wants
[1:21:46] you to be sensitive to their needs
[1:21:51] when we go there to the Outreach our
[1:21:54] young people need fathers and mothers
[1:21:56] who are full of their Spirit to help
[1:21:58] them they are setting up a foundation
[1:22:00] can you think about when your house is
[1:22:03] complete it only needs cleaning and I'm
[1:22:05] still putting my Foundation I need you
[1:22:08] more you are my father and you are my

[1:22:22] but how can you support me when your
[1:22:23] house is deity
[1:22:26] can you see that it's going to be
[1:22:28] difficult how am I going to tell that
[1:22:30] child I want your house to be like this

[1:22:43] okay
[1:22:45] can you see that I'm I'm I'm setting
[1:22:47] another example
[1:22:49] how is he going to train Japan
[1:22:52] feed
[1:22:53] and how is Joven going to say
[1:22:55] Bell
[1:22:56] can you see now what generation we are
[1:22:58] creating
[1:22:59] is q1 until a crap said to his children
[1:23:04] hey stop stop working like that walk
[1:23:07] like this
[1:23:09] and the kids walk like it
[1:23:12] guys can you walk straight
[1:23:15] how Mama Like This
[1:23:18] you know a crab goes like this
[1:23:20] they said Mama we are doing exactly what
[1:23:23] you are doing I say straight
[1:23:26] so it is this way then they walk like
[1:23:29] that that crap kill the whole generation
[1:23:31] because cannot walk straight
[1:23:34] but expecting the children to walk
[1:23:37] this is for mothers and fathers you've
[1:23:39] got to take it
[1:23:40] please and uncles
[1:23:43] we belong in this journey I know our
[1:23:47] length of being in the Lord does not
[1:23:48] determine anything anyway
[1:23:50] but we are expected to be good examples
[1:23:54] if you don't have a fire at least have a
[1:23:57] candle of firemen
[1:23:59] I'm not saying you have a big ball of
[1:24:00] fire just a candle so that the little
[1:24:02] guys can light up here the little guys
[1:24:05] can want to speak to you because they
[1:24:06] find the ways of encouragement they find
[1:24:08] the ways of consolation they find the
[1:24:10] ways of Surety and Assurance they find
[1:24:12] the ways of uplifting them helping them
[1:24:15] how to deal with their problems they
[1:24:17] phone you all the time because this is
[1:24:19] something that attracts them there's an
[1:24:21] attraction on the mountain
[1:24:25] that's what our young people must find
[1:24:27] and are you young people your challenge
[1:24:29] is to find that fire
[1:24:32] the fire is not going to come to you
[1:24:33] you're sitting like this and the fire no
[1:24:35] no
[1:24:36] he was looking for you but he wants your
[1:24:38] heart to be available
[1:24:43] let's not our let's not allow our rules
[1:24:46] to head towards Sodom
[1:24:48] while we say we're going to Cana
[1:24:51] may God bless you I I pray and I'm
[1:24:54] praying that this
[1:24:56] was something to take home to chew
[1:24:59] remember one thing
[1:25:01] if there's anything wrong that I said
[1:25:02] forgive me it's just meant for me to
[1:25:06] it's not just for you
[1:25:08] it's because you are so important that
[1:25:11] God cannot afford
[1:25:13] just only to spoon feed you
[1:25:16] when it's hard there comes time when
[1:25:19] that eagle takes the Eagles igles out of
[1:25:21] that nest and fly them high in the storm
[1:25:25] so there comes times like that when they
