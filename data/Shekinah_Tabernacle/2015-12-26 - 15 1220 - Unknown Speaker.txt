the Lord a hand of praising amen hallelujah I'm so glad for that that birth of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah so it's wonderful but I believe it's it was even greater when the Lord came into my heart and he founded the bounding place in in the minds of my heart so I'll just be very sore this morning so I've written down what I what I had to say to it says because I think there's a there's quite a bit of a program amen so um yeah it's so happy to be in the house of the Lord It's just such a wonderful presence you know thank you for the wonderful choruses this morning so yeah um God has brought us um to New Zealand by his grace and by his Mercy as a family and we are just so happy and so glad that you know the Holy Spirit leads and he guides us and we've had many wonderful experiences made many wonderful people and my prayers always constantly been whatever I've done since the Lord has found that that means in my heart has always been to to find God's perfect will so brother Branham says you can um you can walk in his permissible um but he says he prays a praise His God I always want to be in God's perfect will amen and that that makes you a little bit nervous it makes you you know it makes you always a bit funny because um you will also do do do things that's a little bit funny and God opened up the door for us to eventually end up here in Wellington so by the grace of God we've had the opportunity to actually speak to a few Believers here um those that we could come in contact with families that we had an opportunity to just fill us up with it maybe at a dinner or something that we could actually expound a bit more so due to time I'm just concising the the testimony this morning and um are we so glad that we have been able to Surf with you and then also thank the almighty God for your wonderful and welcoming spirit amen it's it's really wonderful it's really glad to to meet people and and through life's journey and you you meet like you get into certain homes when you come into certain homes you realize wow the kids are just relaxed everybody's just relaxed uh the kids they the mom and dad so and you're just relax and you're coming to another home and then you realize wow it's different you know you have to just stay you don't know if the kids can touch the toys and touch this so it's just the the way things are you know and that's God sometimes uses different people in different ways amen but we're so happy that we have found a place for with a welcoming spirit amen and we love you all dearly and and and um you have obviously made us realize how much we have to be thankful for to have such wonderful brothers and sisters in New Zealand amen it took a lot of fasting and and pray um after the Lord is is spoken to my heart and and told me that it's time to return to South Africa amen and um so uh you know the wife and I um we've always been asking God what's his purpose and true life's journey God is um had a a different way in working in my life and he might have a different way in working brother John's like brother Ed different ones I'm really missing brother a brother Isaac this morning you know so there's a there's a part of the finger that's not a hand a part of the body that's not here so um oh it's just the sand and he's here oh oh she went with oh that's that's wonderful at least the whole family is there so just you know just send my regards to him as well or maybe I have to call him yeah so um it took a lot of fasting and pray saying God what's what's the purpose for bringing us here and um and then obviously saying in my mind it cannot be that um you know uh while we were only on the south island we were a bit isolated and we came here we were really glad for for the fellowship but I have learned through many experiences that the Lord has taken me through not to go against the plan of God Amen many things has happened where the Lord it wanted me to be in a particular place and not to question God no matter how ridiculous something that you do seems and um broadbandem on Wednesday night we just read a small quote of brother Branham way brother Branham says the holy spirit in the Revelation series he sees the Holy Spirit leads you and guides you and he says no matter how ridiculous it seems so so sometimes you do things that's ridiculous but you have to do it brother you have to stand on the corner and if you listen to it you just have to stand there the holy spirit said wait here and the policeman came up to him after a few minutes and said why are you still standing here maybe you want to throw himself in a car in front of a truck or something because the people are crossing the road he's got to stand on the on the corner a half an hour standing on the corner and people are crossing the road Holy Spirit said stand here so we we therefore discovered your prayers amen for the family and I as we are making our way back to South Africa um we've given a testament to a few brothers and um also believe that we've also come here by prey it's amazing how God I I've never in all my life I've never realized how strong prayer is and I'm you know I've I've you've done many things and when I came here when I heard when I said we're going back when I heard the sister says it's my prayer that we ended up here then I had made me think many times that God for a simple human God would stop the plane somewhere God would still cause a storm to rise just so did a simple human's prayer sister the Mind must pray can be answered so so you you know I I told my wife maybe brother Brennan was stupid and ridiculous he had to get out of the plane he had to walk out of the airport then he had to walk down the road they said stop maybe you we don't know but you have to do whatever the Holy Spirit leads so we covet your prayers we we ask that you just pray for us as we continue in this program's journey I mean it's really truly a Pilgrim's Journey um so I've just concise at uh you know the the the testimony this morning and I've I've put a little quote on um that I want to read I um I might be brother any well brother and he just gets it ready or while you're getting it ready while they're getting it ready I want to read something quickly from Brother branham's life so this is when he dedicated the Tabernacle the morning he got up at six he's finished with Brenham Tabernacle he built it he pulled the Tabernacle and the angel Lord appeared snatching ball away from that location and setting him down in the corner of 18 Penn Street in Jeffersonville he says and then he says oh on the Lord that once held a lollipunt aside he says it there now stood a large concrete building with a sign above it the front door Dead red Brenham Tabernacle the angel carried him inside Bill scarcely believe his eyes the building was jam-packed with people not only was every seat full but people sit in the aisles and stood against the Halls this is when he was in the vision the morning before they were dedicated at the far end of the room hungry crosses all he says here on one on on one of or one on the front of the pulpit and one on each side in the vision Bowl moved to a place behind the pool but then said oh this is this is what he said oh this is wonderful this is glorious God how good you ought to be to give me the stubborn Echo then the angel of the Lord said but this is not your Tabernacle amen so I'll just leave it there for now um I'll just want to read read a prayer that has really tossed my heart um out of the Revelation series um if the brother is ready so brother Branham admired the building he admired a wonderful building and the angel of the Lord said to him this is not your Tabernacle so you can maybe just go read it so I just want to read this one this came from the Revelation Series in the spring it's just been very heavy on my heart and um I salute brother uh uh brother Ben the pastor and I believe as I'm gonna going to read the prayer this is uh you know it's it's it's it's very difficult because you know I'm saying we're saying our last service we're saying our greetings this morning to you as we as we will be making our way back on the 25th on December um there's also been a a very heavy pull on the other side people that that um that started asking that we used to deal with churches that we used to go to people that we used to help and while coming here the Lord had a specific purpose and when we ended up in in Wellington the whole purpose of the Lord just started falling very nicely in place we realized why God had us brought here we realized and then what time is that purpose was playing itself out here God was calling the causing the pool to go back on the other side my family quite ill that side people I'm one of my my people that I used to help is to pray people we used to use our house just to for people to recover when they come from hospital and so on so we used to have a place and a purpose that you fulfill and we had to ask the Lord it came here by by Praise of God pressed us to give up everything that we had outside and he wanted us in a specific place and um uh uh you know brother Branham says you have to be in a specific place for things to happen so so you had to be here we had to be here um we had to fulfill that plan so I trust God as I'm just reading the prayer that would be my greeting um you know we don't say farewell we're not say this morning yet we are sad we are happy but um I'm I'm here to we we realize that the only thing we can do as a family and myself over the years I've seen um is just to stick to the plan of God just to stick to the purpose of God we we've really been blessed by the ministry um blessed that we could have been here and we trust that we've whatever the season that we've been here and the little calling that God has placed on our heart that somehow for the for the season that God has placed us here for the time that we've been here we could have said something or done something just to help a a pilgrim on life's journey and and as I read the prayer everything that I want to tell you is actually written in here so so heavenly father is stand Lord this is Brother Bradham spray we just love to sing those old songs they go way down deep into the inner parts of our heart and bring out the expression of our love today the Living God and as we raised our hands low this morning it was a little Memorial that hold our hands Lord as I was telling about bully Paul how did he grip onto my hand he would have fell if it hadn't been I was holding him and oh God how many times would we have fallen if you hadn't have held our hand thinking how that he what no mother is look as a little baby and how that how down through life that the roads that he had taken would have been killed long ago but there was a greater hand that could reach out where mind couldn't reach and take a hold now we're we're so grateful for that so we have kids we have children we can only do so much the next one thank you brother so glad to know Lord that when we feel our soul separating from this body that there's still a hand that we could reach out and take a hold of will guide us over the river we thank thee for these things disassurance this full assurance that we have and anchor to the soul that keeps us steady while we're walking over this journey or sailing life Solomon this assurance and anchor for the soul and we pray father that is the poet said the full on in separate brother seeing our steadiness on kill seeing it shall take heart again I'm weary I'm weary I don't have and I see a brother steady and I can take a heart in his steadiness in the Lord amen himself or take courage again and try again no they're the old sufficient God if we stumble or fall his hair his great hand is there to keep us his grace is sufficient now we pray God that we will this morning star the new year off in hymns and singing and rejoicing and knowing that God will guide us down through life's journey and over the river of death into that Promised Land our eyes look Beyond Jordan's swelling streams this morning or where the fields of clover in the fields of Evergreen is growing and we pray God that our souls will catch that vision amen and never let it Loose someday when we have to come down to that stream we see crosses that like he lies of all the robe of God will Smite that stream and will walk over without a fear granted the Lord and our souls wasn't scarce that Vision he helped us as we approach Thy word O Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit Will anoint these words we are certainly insufficient to teach them not being a teacher we know that the only way that we will be able to know it is for that great Master teacher to come and take his place off Abode in our heart and overpower our minds in such a way and our thoughts tell Will you interpret the holy scriptures to us so many times the scripture goes against what I think what we think that he will guide us he will interpret it we're solemnly depending on them and thinking of it God oh how wonderful did a loving father like that that was that that's the very birth of Eternity eternity would come down to Immortal beings and help us and it bring his word and give give it in our mouths and hearts and ears that we might hear it in love to redeem us from a curse that we had nothing to do with it coming father because it was done by the human race and we are the offsprings of that first couple and we're born in sin saved in iniquity but a just in loving God knows that we had nothing to do with it but it's made a way of Escape Away in a Manger came down and he took on that flesh a little baby in a crib amen he made a way of escape and give us the privilege of coming how glad we are we've come to Father's House the next one brother thank you we pray now that you bless our church here so I just read a whole one and this is I think the second last one we pray now that you bless our church here brother Neville we pray now pray now that you bless our church here brother Ben the bastard our gallon Pastor your humble servant we pray for our deacons and trustees so I pray for every office in the church this morning amen that you give them the greatest year that they've had granted Lord we give them long life strengthen them Lord

the Deacon I will because God lets him lead him you know amen strengthen them Lord they are your servants may they always stay Gallant in the post of Duty bless the laity the members your dear beloved children that comes to this house so that's my praise I said to you whatever is in my heart I found it in the spray and I could just relate the spray God we claim the soul and this is also now our desire God reclaim the soul of every one of them that crosses the threshold of this house we claim it for you we help us to be such ministers that will bring the word so simple and so through by the Holy Spirit they'll long to be like you so even if even if I'm not preaching even if I'm sitting at work and drinking a cup of coffee they will say there's something different about that lady the way she drinks a coffee the way she eats a food that I can draw somebody to the kingdom Lord grant it heal the sick and Afflicted that comes in and all around the world granted in every house of God finally when you're finished Lord may we enter into thy portals sit down at the welcome table of God and eat and live together through ceaseless ages so that's our prayer we are just passing through you know uh just programs um God is allotted me 17 months to come here for you he's allotted maybe a lifetime being born here and then your life ends at 75 or 70 or 50 or whatever so it's allotted you a time to come through and may may we all just find that purpose of why God has placed you here your birth you in New Zealand your time and there's a season of time just so that's also my prayer for each and everyone that's here this morning amen until then maybe have health and strength happiness it's always power and might and the blessings of the holy spirit to guide us we ask in Jesus name amen so um it's emotional for us but I I I didn't want to repeat a testimony and um that I've given is to how I've told a few of the brothers and there's a bit of a lengthy programming and all I asked for you this morning is just for my wife and the children and just to pray for us as we make our journey back um if you read further after after that poster May the angel spoke to brother Brennan

Lord you're in control of all things we just yield ourselves to you father be it those who couldn't be here today we pray especially father be their portion and we just commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we ask these things amen amen to the Luke chapter two and read from verse 7 down to verse 20. now the man just love how everything all pans together and I had no idea uh yeah just I had no idea the skit was a secret amen praise the Lord I enjoyed that and also the special as well so Luke chapter 2 verse 7 and you brought forth her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there's no room for them in the end and they were in the same country shepherds are biting in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord shine around about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for our behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you was born this day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was that um and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace and Good Will towards men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord has made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe laying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told unto them concerning this child and all that heard it wondered at those things which were told then by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them amen Lord bless his word you may you may have your seats amen I want to I want to speak about Christmas in 2015. you know it's incredible really I was it just really struck me I've been listening uh I was listening to a bit of you know brother bear and preaching white white had to be Shepherds and you know he read the same scripture here but it's a it's incredible just if you think about it where you know and and maybe if you keep your Bibles handy we'll go to Matthew Chapter 2 as well but it's incredible where here was here was the you know here was God's chosen people they were God's chosen Nation and they were they they believed that God was going to come and you know they believed the Messiah was going to be born and it wasn't a secret coming it was declared all the prophets declared It And yet when it was happening they had no idea what was going on and God bypassed who he should have spoke to he bypassed that channel and he went to Shepherds or he went to wise men in the East he didn't that's incredible let's just read here Matthew chapter two you know it's it's so to me to me it's one of the most probably the saddest the saddest portion of scripture you could read and it's the most profound the same time it's just it's just incredible how God would God would choose to do things like this so we'll go to Matthew chapter two we read from verse one and this is where the where the uh wise men the Magi have come so this is a bit after now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judah in the days of Herod the king behold came wise men from the east of Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him why would they be troubled they would they would think you know they should not be troubled at these things because these wise men they went to the logical place they went to Jerusalem that's where the temple was in Jerusalem so they went to the logical place you know they didn't go to any other place in Israel they went straight to where you would think they would know what is going on and they were troubled and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded them where Christ should be born and they said unto them in Bethlehem of Judah for thus it is written by the prophet and now Bethlehem in the land of Judah aren't not the least among princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privately called the wise men and quiet of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also and when they had heard the king they departed along the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way now we understand that the reason that Herod killed all the children two years old and younger is because by the time the wise men got there Jesus wasn't in the manger anymore but he was living in Bethlehem as a young child that's astounding where where here we have two scenes and these scenes should not have happened because God should have revealed it to this the you know why didn't the angel appear to the high priest why didn't the angel appear in the temple and tell them this night Christ the lord is born in a manger in Bethlehem why didn't he go to these people he had to you know the reason is and you can see it when the wise men they go into going to Jerusalem there's no record of them are seeing the star until they go out of the city again he was meant to be the most holy people the most holy nation the most holy Place upon the Earth Jerusalem And yet when when when those wise men were following that star from the East when they came into that place they couldn't see the sign anymore they couldn't see the star it was you could say it was obscured by the religion that was in that place it was obscured by the traditions of the scribes and Pharisees and it's amazing because he should have they should have been pointed out you know here it shouldn't have been troubled you know the scribes and Pharisees they shouldn't have been troubled it says all of Jerusalem all of it says and he was troubled in all of Jerusalem with them they were troubled what does this mean what's going on amazing isn't it you would think surely now I want to labor on this point because man doesn't change history repeats itself and what they did in his first coming this you're gonna do in a second coming and here we have a whole Christian world that is that is has major scenes in there and they're celebrating the birth of Jesus and we should celebrate the birth but we understand he was born in Spring he wasn't born in December because this 25th of December is the you know it's just the winter solstice time and we know the Romans they they took the birth of their son God and they just made it the birth of the Son of God yeah and they just change it they just change Pagan festivals they put Christian names to it too bring Christianity and paganism together so we understand he wasn't even born at this time because there's normally snow on the hills of Judea and sure Shepherds aren't going to be out in the snow amen and God runs with nature so he'll be born in Spring Lambs are born in Spring but we have come together still we still celebrate the birth of our Lord today I mean you're you're on Christmas but he was born there in the spring but it's amazing because man doesn't change as I said so if they were totally you know obscured they had no idea what was going on and God had to bypass think of it God had to bypass they had Bible schools in that day they had scholars in that day they had great Halls of learning studying the studying the Old Testament he bypassed the zealots he bypassed the herodians he bypassed the scribes and Pharisees and Sadducees he bypassed the high priest himself he bypassed kfss and all the he bypassed all these people and he came to Shepherds right amen he came to people who weren't even weren't even the ones you know he he came to these kind of people you think and that blows my mind because the very reason you know the temple was there and the high priest was there it's because the because the high priest you know stands between you know he offers the sacrifice on behalf of the people so you think surely you know this Angel's announcement because here was coming one who's going to do away at those sacrifices here was coming one that by one offering he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified amen so here was this great announcement where the blood of bulls and goats was going to be done away with and now the perfect lamb was going to come upon the Earth you'd think he would have gone there they didn't go there he went to Shepherds he went to he went to Mages in the east and we understand the reason those Magis were looking is because when Daniel and them were out in Babylon they he he taught them the wise men the scriptures and in Genesis is out of Judah says a star will arise out of Judah and so that scripture they will they were studying the heavens and they knew the Bible and they saw the star come up however it appeared maybe three joined together or a consolation however it worked and they saw that and they recognized in the scripture that a star will arise out of Judah and then they said now he must be born upon the Earth and then they begin to travel and here was you know and and here was the religious center of the world the true True Religion totally blinded to the whole thing right amazing now the angels they had to appear to the Shepherds because this is the kind of person God was going to become he wasn't can you imagine the high priest going into a Manger amen all in his dignified robes and all the things you know and he goes into this manger and there's you know manure and there's muck and there's animals and all could you imagine a high priest could you imagine those kind of people going into that place they wouldn't go into that place no sir they wouldn't want their robes all dirtied and things so God had to God had to speak to people who are willing to go into that kind of place amen and that's why he appeared you know that's why he appeared to the Shepherds that they weren't all bound up by their religion but they when they saw God you know God reveal himself and they knew that that was a lot apparent to them they acted upon what they saw and the angel LED them to where the word was born amen the angel led into where the word was born and it's a thing in this day we've had a visitation of the Angel amen amen God himself was a pit and he's led us to where the word is where the word is for this hour amen and it comes to your address because he knows that you have something in you that'll humble yourself to the word amen they the Shepherds they said well we're just at home in a in a Manger remember a Manger in those days it's like a cave cut out of a cliff yeah it's not you know it doesn't have a nice roof on it and you know how they have manger scenes in these days it wasn't that nice amen it was just a like a hole cut out of a side of a hill or a cliff and that was where the manger was here's a very king of glory being born into a place like that right has shown his godship by showing how humble he became amen so here was here was a place where the Shepherds felt at home but the religious world no no way these robes cost a lot of money I'm not getting them dirty I'm not going down here with all these animals I'm not I'm not going to this place and you'll find people today they will not humble themselves I mean to where God is they say no way God would I would never be seen with those kind of people yes they're a bunch of Fanatics Hallelujah hey yeah they just they just gone off the deep end they're just a bit crazy I'm happy this way if you want to call me whatever you want I'm happy to be this way I'm just in love with Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so here we have you know they would never have but the Shepherds were at home in that place Hallelujah and it's amazing because they they they listen to The Angel's message and they they went exactly where the angel told them to go and they found him they found him there and we've received an angel's message we've received the seventh Angel's message and he said you'll find Christ in his word Hallelujah and we have and we've humbled ourselves to the word and found him he's alive amen he's alive and well there's nothing wrong with saying I've met God sure a lot of people have said God told me do this and they shoot up a whole bunch of people that wasn't God telling them that but the devil on the news that to try and diminish the genuine there's nothing wrong with saying I've met Jesus Christ amen amen because if the apostles sure made him we have to meet him amen because he's the same in every generation and if he is the same people people are still the same you say we're more modern we're more educated there's no way we could make the same mistake as they made I'm sorry friends humanity is just exactly like they were when he came the first time so they will act the same way when he comes the second time now we understand that this that the first coming in his first coming he never said he was coming as a thief like a thief in the night and the second coming he says I come like a thief in the night and we'll read this in first Thessalonians Brother Andy touched on this but we'll go to first Thessalonians we'll read some scripture you know I was maybe this will just as we're turning to first Thessalonians chapter four you know I was thinking and this is totally a not uh I don't even know how to put this in words but you see when the angel gave the when the angel gave the message to the Shepherds then all all that Heavenly Host they just cried out they couldn't contain themselves they said Good Good Will and peace on Earth towards men you know they were saying glory to God you know there was they you know they had to cry out and praise God for what he'd done and and so in his first coming it was angels that they they they couldn't contain themselves for a Redemption had come to the Earth and then in a second coming when the lamb takes the book amen it's not just Angels crying out but John and all the redeemed in Revelations 5 they said worthy and blessings and power and honor and glory be unto the lamb for he has redeemed us back to God they couldn't contain themselves when they saw the lamb take take the book Hallelujah and I just you know ever since I've been reading this I felt the same way amen when you see uh yo you've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb and something and you cannot contain it you say glory and blessing and power and honor be out to our lord Jesus Hallelujah I mean John John couldn't hold himself back he said I heard all everyone above the Earth and the Earth under the Earth heard me say glory and blessing and honor Hallelujah and we understand that John because in that in that scripture and you're in Revelations 5 it said you have redeemed us out of every Kindred Tongan Nation so we are all part of that scene in Revelations chapter five and John because he was caught up into an eternal realm John saw himself there amen Amen brother Graham says John saw John himself and that's why he was glaring and praising God because he saw he was part of the redeemed hey Hallelujah then you see us you you see yourself part of this word yes sir amen and you recognize I've been redeemed hallelujah hallelujah it should just burst off glory and power and blessing and honor be unto the lamb you may think you're just beside yourself I know I'm just happy in the Lord as John If Heaven couldn't contain it the redeemed could not contain their their praising of God now I've always believed that Revival they had to put on flesh amen where there's the people upon the Earth and it just becomes such a you know it becomes so real amen amen that that I've been redeemed he's laid his hand upon me I belong to him I'm his property amen we're bought with a price we're not our own amen hallelujah I meant oh I just wish I could put it into words but you know when you recognize Jesus died for you amen Jesus was born that he would purchase your salvation hey Hallelujah you know people get excited in a sports event they get excited at the rugby they get excited and they shout and they paint themselves all different colors and Sub-Zero weather and they're there early I mean they're there early in the parking lot and they're getting ready Hallelujah hey we never say they're a bunch of Fanatics yeah the world does not say those guys are crazy right right they say Well they're just passionate for what they believe in steinlager's slogan for the World Cup We Believe it's on a billboard I thought we believe right right I don't believe in that I believe in this I believe Hallelujah and so the world thinks you know the world does not think that's fanaticism but if someone's just in love with God and they're happy and rejoicing about it the world just says that person's crazy yes amen and they're excited and they're enthused because Eternal things are taking place Hallelujah we know that the lamb has stepped forth to lay claim upon us I mean we know we're going in a rapture we know he's coming like a thief in the night we'll read it but it but we are not the children of Darkness that they should overtake us yes Hallelujah Glory yes first Thessalonians 4. amen now worried first Thessalonians chapter four read from verse 15. remember chapter five is a continuation of verse of chapter four it's not two different thoughts so he says for this sorry for verse 15. for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep so he's coming absolutely for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words but but as a conjunction can you know connecting what you've just read to what you're about to read but of the times and the seasons Brethren ye have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that that there the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety and they're saying peace and safety we're going to have peace remember well Jesus said no man knows the day sure true but God God laid in his word when you see these conditions as it was in days of Noah as it was the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall it be when the son of man is revealed when you see the Fig Tree put forth its blood you know summer is neither the Millennium and that specs of Israel becoming a nation so I said when you see these conditions he said look up because you know your redemption's drawing though oh Jesus Christ Hallelujah but the other times and Seasons Brethren I'm sorry for for ye yourselves know perfectly the day the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren remember he's writing to Believers he's writing to you because they believed he was writing to them but it's been 2 000 years God had seven Church changes that he had to fulfill them we're in the seventh one but ye Brethren are not in darkness that they should overtake you as a thief amen there goes all the pressure am I going to miss it you cannot miss it if God's voice is resonated in your soul that this is more than just a man from Kentucky preaching but it's God's voice Amen to this generation and you recognize he's talking about me I mean when he's talking about a woman who's the bride of Christ who's sinless and hey if the devil's bombarded you and if and if there's habits in your life that you cannot seem to just just shake off do not be discouraged amen do not be discouraged just keep confessing the word he is I can't overcome this man you can't overcome him yourself you need God to come and overcome him for you amen amen hallelujah don't settle if yo I heard was it brother brother Dwayne fear up in the Easter convention you know he said he said you know today there is the age of of peacekeeping you know we send peacekeepers and they keep the peace and everything's all happy yes yes we're not called you know the Christian world has become a bunch of peacekeepers with the devil that's right that's right amen and and his whole books and whole bookstores of how to live with your problems and how to live with your failures we're not called to be peacekeepers we're called the take back what belongs to us amen if the devil's on your case get on here amen know that he's coming to an end Hallelujah and you're Eternal yeah so I just can't just keep wrestling keep fighting yes amen amen amen don't give up Jacob wrestled all night with the angel he wrestled all night because he knew he knew that he'd get a blessing right he wrestled all night till he got his Blessing friends were called to do the same thing yes he said I'm not seeing any results just keep wrestling hey amen Hallelujah we have we have such an abundance we have the greatest we have the great yeah Moses said there's never been a word like this word he said in the Old Testament and I can say there's never been a word like this word there's never been a day like this day I mean with God who has opened his word and it's not sealed to us but we know what it says amen we know who he is you know I I was yeah I probably shared it before but when I was back in University and I was trying to uh be a witness in amongst the university Christians quite a few of them said no one can really know truth today how can you know what truth is why and it just made me sad because Jesus said and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and he's not a man that can lie so if there's truth and there's truth ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen so if he said that then how can people say well how can you know what truth is it's because they've been taught wrong yes amen amen if someone sincerely wants to know the truth God is obligated to give them that truth so you know we have such a we have we have the greatest we have the greatest word amen we have the greatest Revival amen that there's ever been amen amen where people are coming to their position in Christ amen when the devil's put under their feet amen amen Satan Satan if he oh I said it your your brother Danny Stephen said it they said if the devil is on your case if he's hounding you he's not under your feet and therefore he's out of your out of his position right amen amen the devil no listen listen friends this word the anointing we have received Christ himself being born as brother Donnie said in the manger of his heart and Christ has been birthed in every member of the Bride that gives us overcoming power against everything amen every devil in hell everything every scheme of man must be put under your feet amen hallelujah now first Thessalonians chapter five you say I'm not sure if that is really possible all things are possible to them that believe amen hallelujah this Bible is a record of exploits of faith amen and you can bring it all the way down through seven Church ages down into this end time amen where where Sons and Daughters of God have done exploits amen by the Revelation they have received yeah amen don't be a peacekeeper with the devil hey man you're called to have Eden in your home hey amen eating conditions have been have we have the right to create an atmosphere amen amen we are we are amateur creators and we have a right to create an atmosphere of heaven and our home amen the words we speak the things we do they create an atmosphere yes sir amen amen you know you yeah amen yeah I think I heard some preacher said he says it's like if you tell your wife she's the worst cook she's the most terrible person in all the Earth you'll create an atmosphere amen but if you do the other side and you're lovely you're so wonderful you know it's such a I just I'm so glad to be home you'll create an atmosphere amen what are you called to do we in our you know our homes we take for I think I said it last Sunday we take for granted what we have it becomes natural to live in a realm of peace and it's so it's so resting and you feel refreshed and you know we just take it for granted because we live in that realm right right and that's the realm we're called to live in and Satan's Eden yeah this world six thousand years he's been making as Eden hey man or seven thousand sorry if I get the master on but he's been making an Eden all the way down through and here we are living in Satan's Eden amen and we're actually veiled that's right so we're veiled to everything the devil couldn't you know try and buy you worth y amen he tried you know the devil he tries to you know you know the Solomon bride books really made this alive the devil he tries to give you things to try and win you over to him you know yo he tries to give you things if he can't give you you know he tries to give you a good job or or lots of money or some something that'll take you away from God because he's trying to win you to himself he'll give you popularity or whatever it may be social standing you know he tries to do those things to try and you know attract you he tries to distract you yes amen he tries to attract You by everything but then we just come into this world and we get born again and something in us just just we see it for what it is amen and we're veiled we're actually the brightest you know you look at something out there on the street and Once Upon a Time it used to entice you and it used to excite you and it used to be actually that was your main love of life was whatever out there but then God comes down and then you look at the same thing ensure you have memories of what you used to enjoy but now you're looking and say there's nothing in me that wants that amen hallelujah what's happened you've been veiled to that thing glory to God yeah where were we first Thessalonians chapter five hey man I'm talking about Christmas if you're wondering where I'm going now first Thessalonians chapter five he says now but ye a verse five I believe we're but yeah all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness he's telling the Believers you're not in darkness that day will not overtake you as a thief hallelujah amen I'm sure that and the church says glory to God Amen for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunk in a drunken in the night but let us but lead us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for and for a helmet the hope of salvation for God has not appointed us now now put now God has appointed me for God has not appointed me to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ so Paul is telling us quite plainly he's going to come as a thief in the night but he's not gonna you're not gonna miss your day and hour of visitation amen amen and and second Peter 3 verse 10 I'll just read it quickly but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that therein shall be burnt up so yo his first coming he never said he's coming like a thief but a second coming says I'm going to come like a thief in the night so the first coming they all should have known they shouldn't have been surprised and troubled by what was going on in those days they should have known exactly what was happening and it's incredible where you even have with the you know you just think how people can be so numb you know they can be in the temple of God they can they can worship the true and living God but yet they can be so numb to what God is doing well you look at when John you know the angel visits John's dad he's a priest in the temple and he doesn't believe the Angel's message of of his son shall prepare the way of the Lord and he struck down and he and he comes out because I think he's ministering there with the incense and he comes out to where the people are and he can't speak and then finally after John was born and they and they're saying now which you know who are we gonna you know what shall we call them and only the tradition was that the that the Father the Son receives the father's name and they say let's call him Zacharias and they gave a writing table to to to sorry Zechariah Zacharias and he wrote call him John and as soon as he did that his mouth was open and he'd be in the glorified God hallelujah you think what an incredible event and the people's sword amen and just like when Mary went and spoke to Elizabeth before she you know he was even born and said you know and then as soon as her salutation came came into Elizabeth's ears I'm gonna have Jesus he's gonna be the Messiah John left in her womb amen and then they begin to praise and glorify the Lord the spirit of God Came Upon them what Manner of Child it says one place what Manner of Child shall this be right and that they were there there in Jerusalem they saw all these things take place and yet they forgot about it amen God was trying to get their attention I'm coming my forerunners being born into the Earth and then the messiah's gonna be brought into the Earth all these things are taking place and the and the church world in the day is just like what's going on amen we wouldn't miss we wouldn't be like them speaking of the church world we are in the new test now people have changed no people never change yes that's right you know they had they had scripture they were looking for for the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel and then it says it is in Isaiah 7 14 Isaiah 9 6 front to us a child is born unto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counsel of the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and brother bam says now when when Isaiah prophesied those things about a virgin conceiving it wasn't his own thinking because it never happened before was God declaring things and then when people who had who had young you know young woman virgin children you know ladies who could have had children all the parents said that's going to be my daughter my daughter's going to bring forth amen she's going to conceive by God and she's going to bring forth the Messiah and it carried about 800 years yes that's right and then finally it had carried for 800 years and then Mary Mary she's you know you know she's going about her Daily Business and then Gabriel appears to her says fear not and begins to declared to her you shall have the promised son you shall have you shall be the Fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy hallelujah amen and now she only had her own testimony no one else had seen the angel at that time no one else was there when the angel told her what her name was how you know told her you know that she's going to marry Joseph and all these different things it was only her testimony yes and her testimony did not make her popular amen her testimony didn't make her popular Joseph it says in Matthew you know the start of Matthew he was going to put it away privately you know because how could how could you believe you imagine that you're going to get married hadn't known each other and then she comes with says honey I'm pregnant you know your heart would just drop like a stone like a lid a lead balloon how did this happen you know because normally you ask that because there's a whoever the guy did it you're going to string him up amen but then but then she said the angel Gabriel appeared to me and said you're going to have the promise you know promised Messiah and it's a he was he was he was singing because he loved her but he said he just it was just too fantastic how could it be right and so that's why he was going to put it away and then gay then the angel visited him in a dream but now so now they have a testimony but notice this did not make them popular because he was because the rumor went around she was pregnant before they are married or or she was in you know having an affair or saying before they got married and they just got married that that that that he would cover cover her up protect her from being stoned and then so now she she had a black name she had a dark name a bad reputation and now Jesus had the same bad reputation illegitimate born amen and then and then brother bear me dramatized at you on the eighth day they circumcised and they take him into the temple and he just wrapped in swaddling clothes When They Carried him into the temple all the other woman with their fine lace you know dedication dresses or whatever they had on their babies they all separated to the other side of the room that's right because they didn't want to be associated with this one and here was The Lord Of Glory now here was God's perfect lamb and coming to the temple to be dedicated right and these other ones didn't want anything to do with them amen but it's so beautiful because even in those conditions God still leads his children to find amen amen and then and then there was I think it was Simon there and I can't uh just think his name there but it's the start of start of Luke there where where they come into coming to the temples and Simon he you know the Lord had told him the Lord had told him that he shall see the Lord's Christ before he dies that's right yeah no doubt that didn't make him popular either man it's gone a bit you know he's got a bit funny and his his religion been reading the Bible too much and he's just taking a turn but God told it when God tells you something heavens and earth will pass away amen but his word will not pass away if God's commissioned you to a certain work stay true to that commission amen amen so he and then he just began to tell I'm gonna see I'm gonna see Emmanuel born I'm going to see the Lord's Christ and then so in that thing so they're in the very Temple and all the other woman there are trying to separate themselves from Mary here and in the Lord directs them straight amen and then he and he picks up the child I just love this part of this one picks up the picks up the lamb and said Lord let thy servant depart in peace amen for I've seen your you know you know I've seen the consolation of Israel and then there was blind out of the prophetess stone blind but yet she saw further than the high priest she saw further than the Bible schools she saw further than all the denominations and the Lord led her straight in that same scene amen led her straight to where the Lord was there amen hallelujah hallelujah amen God still leads his children Amen to where the word is Hallelujah I'm so glad for that God's leadership Hallelujah now he says this in um Susan Wyatt had to be Shepherds I just want to read this he says all of our schooling all their teaching and so forth was worked out uh to the worst for them it finally denied him they're very schooling that they had had for him to believe him turned around and became his most critical enemy and crucified him do you know that history repeats itself every so often it's a noted fact it could happen again right by the side of us oh you say if I'd have lived then well now I want you to know what you'd have done then look at your present State now that's right amen wow and you can see what you'd have done then because it certainly is revealing trying to believe his word and then when his word was Vindicated before their very eyes they denied the word that was made Vindication when God proved what he would do and said what he would do and proved what he would do then they'd turn around and call this man an evil spirit speak about the Lord himself which cursed them all think of what's taking place think of what caused them their training caused them not to recognize the very word made flesh in their day yes you know to me there is such a it just it just blows my mind where you think oh imagine that a whole religious system yes amen amen has been studying and claiming to look for him to come but they're very training and their knowledge and their understanding turns them against them when he does come that's incredible the yo yo John says he came to his own and his own received him not but many as received him gave them power to become the sons of God amen so he came to his own but his own didn't receive him to me it's the saddest thing it's just incredible amen and I can put it in you know I can put it the same way where if it happened back there it has happened today yes amen it sure has happened I'm sure I'm standing here this morning it has happened today amen where they're learning turn them against a very Lord of glory amen and then in the second coming they're learning in their denominational ways turn them against the Lord Of Glory wonderful amen and we can see this we can see how history repeats if you just go to Matthew 23. uh we're just going to read a portion of scripture here because Jesus is showing man we can't we can't just look at it a god of history and uh so every time I think of this it just so strikes me with brother Brown he preaches a sermon lifting him up out of History yeah and he mentions in quite a few places says what good does a god of History do to you today what good does he do he doesn't do you any good right oh he was back there in the main jar he was there with Moses oh he was there you know with Paul or irenius or Paulie couple Martin or Colombo or Luther or Wesley or you know the Pentecostal movie with brother Branham I say what good does a historical God do that's right amen you can't get warm next to a painted fire what good he doesn't do you any good sure it's good to know the testimonies and and draw from their experience of their testimonies and how they are LED yeah but if but if that is it and if you just learn yes amen if the teaching just becomes a learning and not a reality yeah where the word is actually engrafted into your soul and changes your nature what good does it do we don't want a god of History if he is the same yesterday today and forever amen well he's he is the same every way the same he's just not in his Corporal body amen says every way the same so we don't want to we don't want to say you know and that's and that's why wait let's just read this and I'll and I'll come to what I'll say so Matthew 23 verse 27 he says why aren't you scrubs and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are like unto why did sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of Dead Man's Bones and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity wow unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites because you build pardon me the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which kill the prophets and then he says fill ye up then the measure of your fathers yes see so he's just showing history is repeating itself he said oh if we're in that they would never have done that by saying your very actions proved what you would have done in that day because history just kept every time God would send a prophet God would send a deliverer they would reject his message and you know they would they would eventually kill the man and every generation had the same problem so if God now if God was if Jesus was rejected in his first coming he has been rejected in a second coming yeah amen Hallelujah now we have a we have such an amazing time to be alive and yeah we understand the scripture has told us that the Lord would come again and we see this very clearly he says in John 14 he says behold I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive it to myself that where I am not where you are but where I am you shall be also so there's this promise where God would come and receive his elected ones and we read there in first Thessalonians that the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive you know will be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air so there comes a season where this has to be fulfilled and so we understand that we are living in that season you know brother Branham you know he would you know you go to Luke 17 30 and he said yo Luke Luke chapter 17 it says it wasn't the days of Noah so shall it be when the when the son of man is revealed as it was a days of lot days of lot was Sodom and Gomorrah the world is in those conditions right it says as it shall be when the son of man is revealed well and he spoke of himself as as son of man so he's saying when the world's in this condition I'm going to be made known again I'm going to be revealed to the people amen that's what he said Remember the world is forever praising God for what he's what he's done looking forward to what he's going to do but they miss what he's doing they miss where he is presently the whole the whole world is saying oh he was born in a manger and they sing the same carols we sing and they sing and they're so thankful and we should be thankful but they just put him back in a Manger they they put him back 2000 and he died on the cross and he rose again and now we don't know what he's doing but he's coming again and they miss what he's doing if they did it in his first coming they'll do it in a second coming they'll all be trouble what does this mean what is this all about amen and here we are so without a doubt you know we you're a read here and John because the scribes and Pharisees could could identify Moses now let's go to John chapter nine I don't really want to be too long but I just wanna maybe swing this around a little bit but so John chapter nine and we're using verse 19. he says and they asked them saying is this your son no so this was a man that was born blind and then Jesus opened his eyes we're just coming halfway through the story and they asked them saying is this your son who say who say ye was born blind how then doth he now see his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself these words Spike his parents because they feared the Jews for the Jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was Christ he should be put out of the synagogue religious pressure come on the people therefore said as parents he has of age ask him then again call they the man which was blind and said unto him give God the praise we know that this man is a sinner he answered and said whether he is a sinner or no I know not one thing I know that we're as I was blind but now I see you know the whole world they say Oh Brother Bear me went off on the end it's a cult and all these different things one thing I know I was spiritually blind but now I see I was lost and now I'm found Hallelujah I know whom I have believed I know that Jesus is not a god of History to me anymore he's a living reality every day that's the one thing I know Hallelujah amen so yeah so one thing I know and then said they again to him again what did he do to thee how opened he Thine Eyes he answered them I have told you already and you did not hear wherefore would you hear it again would you also be his disciples then they reviled him and said Thou Art his disciple but we are Moses disciple right we know what God did but you know they have no idea what he's doing as for this fellow we know not from whence he is and before this Nicodemus went to him and said we we know the other teacher come from God amen because no man can do these things unless God be with them so they had to come to a point because remember they're very study of the scripture cause them to reject him their very study of the same Bible that was prophesied he would come cause them to reject him so they had to come to a point they said what are we going to do with this Jesus called the Christ they had a council and they said we must tell the people have nothing to do with them he's he's of the devil have nothing to do with this God or sorry this man because they didn't believe he was God that's right and then that's why they say that's why they said If any man confessed he was the Christ the Messiah he's cast out of the synagogue yeah amen and you can actually see it it's incredible where you you know I saw some films on you know John whitecliffe here's the first one to translate the Bible into English this is back in like the 1300s and and then and then you see John Huss who was influenced by a White Cliff and his teachings and then he was a hundred years before Luther and then Luther you know he had the same burden to translate the word into their own language and he wanted to fix they never wanted to start a new church they wanted to fix the one they were in amen they came to their own but their own received them not and you shot you see it all the way down that people come but Jesus didn't want to start a new movement yes amen he wanted to show I'm the Fulfillment of what you've been doing right right amen that's why John he wants to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that was his commission so he wanted to turn that religious system to prepare them for the way of the Lord amen amen and it came all the way down but then it always comes to a point where where they they killed all you know they didn't kill Wyclef he died of old age but they killed us at the stake and Huss prophesied in a hundred years the same man will stand your man will stand up with the same teaching and him you'll not burn and 100 years later Luther nailed us 99 thesis on the on the on the church door amen amen and then and then the Reformation was on but then it came to a point where where they actually come to conclusion these people are of the devil because they are not agreeing with what the church teaches that's right and the people become more interested in what the church teaches them what the Bible teaches right exactly I mean you see the same thing with Lonnie jenkins's testimony if you've seen it he is there with Lutheran people very early on and and actually the pastor wanted more of God and they had a discussion and their brother Lonnie said to him I you know you know I feel there's more of the Lord out there and the pastor Lutheran Pastor said I feel the same way but I can't go out you go out and whatever you find bring back and they begin you know God began to do things in the church then they had a meeting with the governing body of the Lutheran Church and they were trying to show them out of the Bible these things are in the scripture but the but the officials of the church said we're not we're not talking about this and he brought this church papers in front of the you know on the table we're talking about this what had happened the same thing they hold on to their Church teaching more than the word amen amen and this is what they did in his first coming they held on to their teaching more than the word made flesh so now in verse 30. why hearing is a marvelous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened my eyes now we know that God heareth not Sinners but if any man be a worshiper of God and doeth His will he hear he him he heareth since the world began was it not her that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of God he could do nothing and then they thrust them out of their presence and then and then Jesus comes his way amen and then he says here he says and then Jesus heard they cast them out and when they he had found him he said unto him thus thou believe on the Son of God remember Jesus felt so after he was kicked out Jesus found him amen amen when you're willing to burn every bridge and follow the lord then the Lord will find you there wonderful that's right Hallelujah he answered and said who is he Lord that I might believe on him and Jesus said unto him thou Hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee Hallelujah and he said Lord I believed and and he worshiped him amen amen hallelujah amen glory all the whole all of my family will kick me out everything he'll kick me out he won't kick you out amen just walk with the Lord whatever you do and then in John 5 verse 45 do not think that I'll accuse you to the father there is one that accuses to you even Moses and whom you trust for had ye believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me but if you believe not his writings how shall you believe my words and now saying we have we are the Disciples of Moses we have Moses as our Prophet we have Moses's words but they didn't believe they didn't truly believe what Moses was saying yes amen because if they really believe what he said they would have accepted him and that's where you just come down to rubber hits the road if people can't believe the Bible really believe it how can they believe the words of a prophet amen amen because if they really believe this they believe his word because his word comes out of this amen amen Hallelujah so now we have we're living at a time of a second coming the Lord himself has descended with a shout the prophet tells at the end of his end of his life one of the last sermons he preaches on the Rapture he says this is the divine order of the Rapture he says he shall descend with a shout and the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God and all these things and he says the message is the shout yeah and then because there has to be there's a there's a mark there's such a multitude of denominations which one is God gonna take hey man is he going to take the Catholics is he going to take the Baptist are you going to take the Jehovah's Witness which one's he gonna take amen and and everyone has their own opinion and our doctors of theology say this and our doctors of theology say this you know and then so it's all like it becomes just a discussion who's right that's not how God works that's right God sends a voice upon the Earth and he vindicates that voice to prove this is me amen he did it in the days of Moses he did in the Days of Elijah I mean he did it in the Jesus Jesus said if you can't believe me believe the works because they are they which testify of me amen amen and he Vindicated Paul even decayed the church age Messengers down on the way through amen and so people say yo if you can't believe me believe the works because they are they which testify of this amen being alive and well and so now they couldn't but here we are and so we are living in the days of the Rapture amen because he said the message is the shout so he's not making you guess where you are he's saying you're living here you've arrived here amen where the messages the shout yes sir amen so he just declares that you've received the shout there's no more shout to come you've received it yes yes hallelujah amen so he's saying that and he says the Lord will do all those things as he descends I am in and then we were talking briefly you know uh uh yo is it the Bible study we talk about second Thessalonians chapter two and then we understand that this scripture speaks of us because he says now he says now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus and by our gathering together unto him amen that you soon not be soon shaken in mind or troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means but that day shall not come except their cometh Falling Away first and there's been a falling away from from Pentecost all the way down amen there's a great falling away even today and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition who oppose us and exalted himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he is God sinneth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things now so he's saying he's saying here that there'll be a great falling away and we've seen a great falling away he said he said that this man of sin the Son of Perdition will be revealed and he's been revealed amen amen and we know where he is and we know what his daughters are doing as well I'm in the Harlot system we know what it's doing so all these things have been revealed faces now we beseech your brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him now he has come we understand he has come in word form he's present I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee he said he says he says that this mystery of iniquity death already work until he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way now to have a he now remember this is the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost is present on the Earth holding back the powers of Darkness so he gathers his elective but in order for him to be here it's not a part of him it's not a partial word amen you under yeah are you following me if it was just my arm resting on the pulpit and I was the rest of me wasn't here you could say all of brother Ben is not here that's just my arm all my toenail or my foot you know it's not it's not the whole person and then when Luther came the just shall live by faith that was God in a measure but it wasn't the full restoration you see and then God has been restoring us word all the way down and then finally when the lamb takes the book and he looses the seals and he's done that amen amen he he is taking that book he's he's revealed to us the truth of of the scripture amen he's he's revealed himself in his word what does that mean it's not just his arm here anymore amen the the seals reveal Christ oh I need to know more of Jesus just listen to the message read your Bible he's being revealed amen he's been declared brother bam says my message is to tell you that he is here amen amen in spirit form he is present so we're not looking for more of him you know we have we have all of Jesus Christ amen that's right because he is he is his word yes sir amen amen so it's not part of him here so the only way that he who now willeth will let till he be taken out of the way is that the whole person's here and we understand that Moses struck the rock twice instead of calling for water he struck the rock twice and that was a shadow of when Christ would be struck amen and he was struck once at Calvary he was crucified once at Calvary but then because Moses struck the rock twice he had to be crucified again yeah well how can you crucify someone who's not here in physical form easy you take him you take his word and you say it's the devil yeah that's right and you're actually killing its influence you're crucifying him to the people once again that's right amen and then brother man when he preaches the indictment I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ he says this could not have been done 10 years ago or 50 years ago it could only be done now because he preached it after the opening of the seals workers after the opening the seals you know Christ was fully revealed amen amen so the person all of him was there and that's the only way he could be crucified is that when he's in full manifestation Hallelujah so he said back there the word has been crucified again amen amen he came to his own but his own received him not what's this talk in Bethlehem what's all this going on yeah yeah you go to the first coming the church world had no idea what was going on shepherds in the field there are some people upon the Earth that were not bound into those things and if they were abounded in those things the voice of God called them out Amen to where he was Hallelujah there are some people in the east we've seen us rise in the east We've Come To Worship Him there's some spiritually blind people in a church someplace or physically blind people you know like Anna the prophetess stone blind physically but spiritually she was looking she was waiting Amen in the spirit of God led her a right to where Christ was yes Hallelujah and there's some there's a bride of Christ Hallelujah there's a people upon the Earth you can say I am those Shepherds I am amen I am I am Simon in the temple yes looking and waiting Lord when is this gonna happen and then God tells them this is the hour Hallelujah and then he led you right to where he is his word amen in this generation amen hallelujah Hallelujah this is where we are that's right brother amen this is where we are this is why I thank God for this Christmas amen amen I thank him for the first one because he had to be born he had to come and purchase my salvation but I thank God in the second coming yes I mean in this time when he's come again remember we'll meet him in the air he'll physically we'll meet him in the air I mean so his coming is finished when we meet him in the year but he's already come to take us away amen he's come to take us away you think yo yo we pray God we want to talk to you where are you and all these things and he's dwelling in your soul amen he's with you even in you to the end of the world yes I feel so separated from God he says I'm with you yeah amen amen I made my Abode in you Hallelujah you're a Manger like that manger was Hallelujah describe some Pharisees they would have seen no value in a Manger yes no no scriptural no scriptural you know value in that Manger but God had God inspired a man or whoever was to create that manger because God had an idea God knew this is where my son is going to be born and then the religious world may look at you and they will you know whether you like it or not you walk down the street and they look at you look at how these people are dressed look at how these women addressed the yo they're always in skirts look how these brothers are so hot why they're wearing long pants what are they doing yes and they look at you that's right and the church World puts no value upon you whatsoever that's right Hallelujah I remember God put Great Value upon you get past her in Scotland it's recently um um so he's driving to church he just crossed the road any any and he had a heart attack he just died in his car you know he just pulled over somebody just managed to pull over the photo he just died and then his good friend a Believer they're here to dream with that same pastor but a young man visited him in his dream and he said to him they think so highly of you over there amen beyond the curtain of time will you follow me that's what they said so so the pastor died and when when his friend saw him in a dream he was a young man and he had gone into Glory and then he said to the man who's who's showing the dream to well the dream I said you are thought so highly of on the other side Hallelujah and here you are and you maybe just be like that's right now the devil loves to try and feed us down with with low self-esteem and no one cares for you no one loves you and you're not important I'll tell you this you're highly thought of over there amen you're very highly thought of over there Hallelujah God put high value upon you amen hallelujah because he knew you're like the manger amen hallelujah amen hey God made you a certain way the world doesn't see any value in you but God prepared that manger amen God prepared you you know I was hearing a sermon and and when when I think it was Elijah or Elisha went to the widow woman the Gentile widow woman I mean and and and she was gonna she only had a little bit of oil and a little bit of meal and I'm gonna make their last last meal and then they were gonna eat it here and us and they were gonna die and he said to her make me a cake first for this so Lord the oil won't run out in the cruise we go you know the food won't run out brother Ram says that that woman she was of the same caliber as the prophet amen she was the same caliber as the prophet that's why God sent her to this Gentile woman amen hallelujah hallelujah amen his word has come to you he has come to you he has come to you yes sir amen he's revealed himself to you what's he doing he is seeing his caliber in you amen he is actually saying you're the same caliber as me it's not far-fetched one Hallelujah think about it and think about how Jesus said there are many widows in that day of Elijah yet God sent her over there to a gentile there are many lepers when when when the Syrian General came and got healed but yet he came and got healed so there are many people who had the need but yet God bypassed all them in the Sovereign in the sovereignty and he picked the ones who were the least likely to receive it and here you are yes amen here you are just think about it you know you have the scribes and Pharisees they thought now when the Messiah comes is gonna how it's going to be there's gonna be a letter come down from heaven he's going to step off the clouds he's going to reveal himself to the high priest here I am you know and you know it's all just going to work out a certain way and the message never came to them yes it came to Shepherds amen the message never came to Jerusalem it went to the east where some wise men were amen amen it wasn't revealed to the people of Temple that could see you know it was revealed to an old priest and it was revealed to a blind prophetess that's right Hallelujah and God history repeats itself again Hallelujah maybe I'll just close with this amen and that's why I thank God for this Christmas amen that he would in his choosing bypass everyone who thinks is eligible and and reveal himself to me Hallelujah I mean that Christ is not born in a manger he was but he's not there anymore amen the scripture says every Spirit or everyone that confesseth that Jesus has is come is come in flesh amen is of God so not has come but is come hallelujah amen you've got to confess God dwells in me I'm like the manger and Bethlehem God dwells in me yes sir Hallelujah he he he is coming flesh yes you go he doesn't say it has come he is come Hallelujah Jesus dwells in me hallelujah amen let's just let's just leave it there shall we can we have some musicians but thank God thank God we're not like Brother Bear me you know he tells the story of God's rap gift he preaches on it he says don't be the that just kept the rapping and didn't receive
