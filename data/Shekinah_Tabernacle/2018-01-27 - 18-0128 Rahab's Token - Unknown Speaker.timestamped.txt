[38:32] mean the battles won I mean so yes so
[38:36] just keep that in your prayers and be
[38:38] wonderful the heavy one there because
[38:39] for us too you know I mean let's turn to
[38:43] Matthew chapter 1 you know Matthew 1 now
[38:50] I want to just read this then we're
[38:51] going to go to Joshua chapter 2 that
[38:55] says here the book of the generation of
[38:59] Jesus Christ the Son of David the
[39:00] son of Abraham Abraham begat Isaac Isaac
[39:05] begat Jacob Jacob begat Judas and his
[39:08] brethren now notice here comes some
[39:10] woman into this and Judas begat Phares
[39:13] and Zara of tamer and Pharaohs forgot
[39:16] Israel and ester on baguette mm and mm
[39:19] baguette abinadab and a bit of their
[39:21] baguette nests on and nests on baguette
[39:22] Salman and cell member get Boas of
[39:25] Rachel that's that's Rahab and Boaz to
[39:29] get obed of ruth and obed to get Jesse
[39:33] now and this go to Joshua chapter 2 but
[39:37] I want to take I'm gonna probably I
[39:39] don't know if I'll get to both of them
[39:40] but I want to I want to speak on Rahab I
[39:43] don't want to speak on tamer this
[39:45] morning because we have such a battle of
[39:49] ourselves there's a war you know we
[39:53] fight against ourselves and what we
[39:55] foresee is our own complexes and our own
[39:58] humanity but I'm going to show you
[40:00] there's a couple of people in the
[40:01] scripture which is you and they are
[40:05] there to show you that it doesn't matter
[40:09] where you've come from what history you
[40:12] may be carrying with you the Prophet
[40:15] told us in no uncertain terms he never
[40:16] did it in the first place
[40:18] you're pure justified sinless perfect
[40:22] that's what he told us and we need to
[40:26] start believing that and so I just let's
[40:31] just read so we're not going to read the
[40:32] whole chapter just a save time I've just
[40:34] cut bits out but you can go read Joshua
[40:36] chapter 2 so this is before they go take
[40:39] Jericho's isn't Joshua the son of nun
[40:41] sent out of of of shittim two men to spy
[40:45] secretly saying go view the land even
[40:46] Jericho and they went and came into an
[40:49] harlots house named Rahab and Lodge
[40:51] there and it was told the king of
[40:54] Jericho saying behold there come men in
[40:57] hither tonight of the children of Israel
[40:59] to search out the country and the king
[41:01] of Jericho sent unto Rahab saying bring
[41:03] forth the men that had come to thee
[41:06] which are entered into thine house for
[41:08] they become to search out all the
[41:11] country
[41:13] and this is just dropping down to verse
[41:16] nine and she said unto the mean I know
[41:19] that the Lord hath given you the land
[41:21] and that your Tara has fallen upon us
[41:23] and all the inhabitants of the land
[41:25] faint because of you for we have heard
[41:27] how the Lord dried up the water of the
[41:29] Red Sea for you when you came out of
[41:31] Egypt and what you did unto the two king
[41:33] of the emirates
[41:34] that are on the other side of Jordan
[41:36] Sehun and AAG whom you oddly destroyed
[41:38] and as soon as we had heard these things
[41:41] our heart Stood melt neither did they
[41:43] remain any more courage in any men
[41:45] because of you for the Lord your God
[41:48] here is God and heaven above and earth
[41:50] beneath sea he's in control of
[41:51] everything and now therefore I pray you
[41:55] swear unto me by the Lord since I've
[41:57] showed you kindness that you will also
[42:00] show show kindness under my father's
[42:02] house and give you and give me a true
[42:04] token and that you'll save a life my
[42:07] father and my mother and my brother and
[42:08] my sisters and all that they have and
[42:10] deliver our lives from death and the men
[42:13] answered her by me our life for yours if
[42:16] ye utter not thus our business and it
[42:20] shall be when the Lord hath given us the
[42:22] land that we will deal kindly and truly
[42:24] with thee then she let down by a cord
[42:28] through the window for her house was
[42:30] upon the town wall and she dwelt upon
[42:33] the wall and beholders just dropping
[42:36] down to verse 18 and this is gonna be
[42:37] our last reading here behold when we
[42:40] come into the land thou shalt bind this
[42:42] line of scarlet thread in the window
[42:44] which their dentists lead us down by and
[42:46] thou shalt bring thy father and thy
[42:48] mother my brethren and all thy father's
[42:50] household home unto thee and it shall be
[42:53] that whosoever shall go out of the doors
[42:55] of thine house into the street his blood
[42:57] shall be upon his head and we will be
[42:58] guiltless and whosoever shall be with
[43:01] thee in the house his blood shall be on
[43:02] our on our head if any hand be upon him
[43:06] Amy may the Lord blesses word you may
[43:08] have your seats this morning now I want
[43:13] to speak so we all will understand the
[43:17] story of Rahab and how she had a short
[43:22] token we just read there she had a short
[43:25] token she
[43:27] she put that scarlet three-door
[43:29] rope you know out of a window
[43:32] every one of her family went into that
[43:34] house and when Israel came and they took
[43:36] Jericho the house it was on the top of
[43:38] the wall the walls fell down flatness
[43:40] the scripture says but the house fell
[43:43] with the wall but was still standing and
[43:45] they are all saved and Azrael took the
[43:47] city and then we know that the token we
[43:49] have today is the Holy Ghost amen at as
[43:53] the Holy Ghost is our token today and so
[43:55] we have to get ourselves in our family
[43:58] under this token but now we have a woman
[44:01] now I just want you to think about this
[44:03] you'd have gone to rehabs life now God
[44:06] is so good in this day then it doesn't
[44:08] matter where we're from what we've
[44:11] experienced in life what pains and scars
[44:14] and hurts and complex as we may carry
[44:17] now that now if you have a complex that
[44:19] hinders your walk with God you need to
[44:21] get rid of it but this but there's some
[44:23] there's some things that we may carry
[44:25] with us that we may just carry with us I
[44:28] mean I just trust this comes out the
[44:30] right way because I'm not excusing
[44:31] Heaven complexes but we this is me and
[44:36] myself I believe that if you have
[44:39] received him if you've received she
[44:42] received she was I just read this this
[44:44] is I've just been pondering this it sees
[44:47] in Rahab this isn't God's wrap gift this
[44:49] is the Prophet I'm sorry I don't have
[44:51] this in Spanish pray for more
[44:52] translation I mean I always search for
[44:55] the Spanish so harlot so Rahab the
[44:58] harlot that we're familiar with she
[45:01] being a young girl and was turned on the
[45:04] street by her Heath and father and
[45:06] mother that put her on the street
[45:08] because she was beautiful and was to
[45:10] bring and income to them on prostitution
[45:14] and yet down in this immoral girl that
[45:17] was turned on the street she had heard
[45:19] that there was a God who answered prayer
[45:21] and the first opportunity that she got
[45:24] to accept that God or something to do
[45:26] for him she did it and God spared her
[45:29] life and saved her father and mother and
[45:31] her family she fell in love with a
[45:33] general in the army of Israel we find it
[45:35] in history married this general and
[45:37] their courtship was wonderful and
[45:39] finally they settle down
[45:41] and love to Bethlehem now I just want
[45:43] you have to go into the Bible character
[45:45] she didn't say now let's all be adults
[45:49] today can we be adults if I just say
[45:51] some you know when she was a little girl
[45:53] I doubt very much she would have had in
[45:55] her mind she's gonna end up as a harlot
[45:57] this is not this wouldn't have been her
[45:59] plan but the Prophet says here that her
[46:03] parents turned her out and used her to
[46:06] get an income for for them now I just
[46:10] want to lay it real real thick for a
[46:12] little bit there's nothing of our past
[46:15] that can stop us from serving God there
[46:19] is nothing that's why God allows these
[46:21] people you know we know Jesus Jesus and
[46:23] Matthew 1 there's a natural lineage down
[46:26] from Abraham I mean down to Jesus being
[46:29] born and we understand that Jesus he was
[46:31] created in Mary's womb but God
[46:34] attributed him coming to the earth to
[46:36] these people these kinds of people God
[46:39] used to bring a faith I mean to bring
[46:42] that seed if I put it this way down from
[46:44] Abraham I meant down until it was
[46:46] finally manifested these are the kind of
[46:49] people God uses hallelujah and God is
[46:52] wanting you to know it doesn't matter
[46:54] where you're from what baggage you may
[46:56] be carrying what past you may have had
[46:59] that's irrelevant he's not worried about
[47:02] that he allows you to go through those
[47:04] things because he wasn't sure that His
[47:06] grace is so much greater they made it so
[47:09] much more powerful I mean that whatever
[47:11] you may have done so I want there to
[47:13] anchor real real real real deep because
[47:16] there's nothing we have no excuse his
[47:18] blood is greater still his atonement is
[47:21] greater still hallelujah it's greater
[47:23] than your faults and your failings and
[47:26] your past and what way you even be
[47:28] thinking at this moment it's greater
[47:30] than those things I mean but you've got
[47:33] to receive it you know if I had a
[47:36] billion trillion billion dollars here if
[47:38] I had the wealth of the world in my hand
[47:39] and I see it who wants this you'd be
[47:42] there be a punch-up in this place I mean
[47:45] a Black Friday sale in America and
[47:47] they're fighting each other and you know
[47:49] there'd be nothing compared to this
[47:52] because they even say no brother you
[47:54] haven't you say no I wanted and you
[47:56] wouldn't be judging yourself am i worthy
[47:58] to receive it you just come and receive
[48:01] it would you not you wouldn't care about
[48:03] you would never you would never come
[48:05] into the equation can I receive it you
[48:08] reach up and say it's mine and he had
[48:10] carried away and you begin to spend it
[48:12] you'd begin to use the wealth of the
[48:15] world now that's just money it's going
[48:19] to burn it's going to vaporize whatever
[48:22] is going to happen to it there will come
[48:23] a time where it's no more
[48:25] what about eternal life why is it God
[48:28] gives a free gift without money or price
[48:31] salvation is given without money or
[48:33] price the Holy Ghost is given without
[48:35] money or price you don't have to earn it
[48:38] you've just got to receive him you've
[48:40] got to receive it will you receive
[48:43] eternal life eternal life is far greater
[48:45] than the riches of the world there will
[48:48] be no more but if you have eternal life
[48:50] he still will be and you'll continue on
[48:53] hallelujah so why do we but it's the
[48:56] human at such a human condition do I
[48:59] deserve this have I entered am i smart
[49:03] enough am i great enough you gotta throw
[49:05] that aside amen and just say I receive
[49:09] it she was turned out now this is a
[49:13] messy you think about this if we could
[49:16] step in the Rahab's house before the
[49:20] spies came and we would ask her how's
[49:23] that your relationship with your parents
[49:25] I doubt it would be very good well how
[49:30] did they raise you did they treat you
[49:31] right no they turned me out on the
[49:33] street I'm keeping this up he because I
[49:35] wanted to Inc a real deep now actually
[49:37] they used me they used my body to get
[49:41] money for themselves this is what they
[49:45] did wouldn't have been a good family
[49:48] relationship that didn't stop God that
[49:52] didn't stop deliverance coming to her
[49:54] house I mean because the very ones look
[49:57] at this now they're very ones that
[49:59] turned her out at the very one she
[50:01] brought in
[50:03] think about that for a second the very
[50:05] ones that turned her out and not just
[50:06] fund your own house get a job you're old
[50:10] enough away you go no we're going to use
[50:12] you to feather our nest we're going to
[50:16] use you for our own ends
[50:18] that's what they were doing that's what
[50:20] they did and the very ones that used her
[50:22] and say abuse her and did not race her
[50:25] the right way she turned around coming
[50:29] to my house hallelujah coming to my
[50:32] house their salvation and here I have a
[50:35] touching and I ask you the question
[50:37] where did she get that rope from it was
[50:40] already in her house those are in her in
[50:43] her possession and they came a point I
[50:45] mean when she witchy this is just me I
[50:48] was driving along I fell very driving
[50:51] back from work this week I was thinking
[50:53] she has this rope I don't have a rope on
[50:56] me if I did I'd hold it I have the
[50:59] Scarlet rope I've let the spice down
[51:03] this is my deliverance this is my
[51:06] salvation this is that my deliverance
[51:09] not just for me but my house all that
[51:12] will come in this is what I need and I
[51:16] have it in my possession now I've just
[51:18] got to hang it out the window
[51:20] hallelujah she wasn't looking at herself
[51:23] and her pain and her complexes and her
[51:27] past she wasn't looking at that anymore
[51:29] her faith went into action I have the
[51:32] deliverance the whole city can be saved
[51:35] that they could fit in this place
[51:36] hallelujah and she begin to act not
[51:39] according to what she was I mean but
[51:42] according to the promise that she had
[51:44] received hallelujah the self her whole
[51:47] life was now being lived by Scarlett
[51:49] Road by faith and a short token that's
[51:53] how she lives hallelujah and that should
[51:55] be the same way we are friends it
[51:57] doesn't matter where you're from what
[51:59] complex says doesn't matter if you came
[52:01] from the worst family with the worst
[52:03] relationship with your parents whatever
[52:05] more there's no excuse hallelujah I
[52:08] trust you've received
[52:11] headed in her house do you understand me
[52:13] they didn't say call here we brought
[52:15] this with us in you put it up
[52:16] no she had it at her house she was
[52:18] leading the spies down with the very
[52:20] thing that was going to be was going to
[52:23] save her in her house think about that
[52:26] for a second and here we are you say
[52:29] well how does that work and the believer
[52:32] is a seed it's a gene seed of God and it
[52:36] can be buried under a lot of concrete it
[52:38] can be buried under a lot of pain and
[52:40] can bury under a lot of hardship and
[52:42] regret and you know mistakes and
[52:45] whatever in sin sin is just unbelief
[52:48] let's just put it out there sinners just
[52:50] unbelief in God's Word it may manifest
[52:52] in many different ways but it's just
[52:53] unbelief it can be buried in a whole
[52:55] bunch of that it doesn't matter how deep
[52:57] it is buried it must come to life I have
[53:00] a brother that sees it may grow around
[53:02] the concrete up around but eventually it
[53:03] will come forth and it will come out to
[53:05] the Prince of the Sun hallelujah don't
[53:08] begin to grow like it should
[53:10] amen doesn't matter what no don't look
[53:15] at what you've where you've been God
[53:18] allowed you to walk down that road he
[53:20] has the ability to protect you I mean if
[53:23] it was his choosing amen he would never
[53:26] have let those things happen but he
[53:27] allowed it to happen and there is a
[53:29] reason it happened and it's not in vain
[53:33] hallelujah
[53:34] it's not just you know we have to look
[53:36] at things differently we have to look at
[53:39] it very differently her past did not
[53:42] stop her from getting her family under
[53:45] this token her past did not stop her
[53:48] from receiving deliverance it did not
[53:52] stop her one bit and this is a heathen
[53:55] woman who's a prostitute some heathen
[53:59] idolatry and death a death sentence is
[54:03] over her house and it's over her city
[54:05] and everything she is is going to be
[54:07] destroyed just like this Gentile world
[54:10] will be destroyed Amen do you understand
[54:12] me
[54:13] it will be destroyed I mean don't put
[54:15] don't save up treasure on earth put
[54:17] treasure in heaven because where your
[54:19] heart is that's where your treasure will
[54:21] be also I mean your heart shall be upon
[54:24] things of here
[54:25] hallelujah so a whole world was going to
[54:27] be destroyed we read there in the
[54:29] scripture we know we know you're going
[54:32] to come take this place basically amen
[54:34] all the carriages left our men amen all
[54:37] their fortifications all of their
[54:39] ability to withstand a siege in there
[54:41] and their great things it doesn't mean
[54:42] anything anymore I mean their morale had
[54:45] gone they know they were in trouble
[54:47] they knew that they will get a loose
[54:49] amen that didn't stop her she knew or
[54:52] listened but the first thing she asked
[54:53] for when she heard we've heard a voice
[54:56] from another world we've heard a voice
[54:58] from heaven and that voice is spoken in
[55:01] this end time and that voice is calling
[55:04] and it said to this generation the
[55:06] Gentile world is coming to an end
[55:08] you're at the end of all things it's
[55:10] going to be burnt up I mean there will
[55:12] be a nuclear war upon the earth whether
[55:14] you like it or not someone's going to
[55:16] push a button then the other side will
[55:18] push another button and it's going to be
[55:20] a lot of mushroom clouds around the
[55:21] place it will be amen and that's not
[55:26] just all trying to hang a fear over the
[55:28] world it's going to happen it's going to
[55:30] happen but the Prophet tells us before
[55:33] the first bomb drops the bride is gone
[55:35] and I happen to believe that I happen to
[55:39] believe that Amen that before the first
[55:41] nuclear bomb drops a man will be on
[55:43] streets of gold will be dancing
[55:46] hallelujah and that's why he seemed a
[55:48] voice he sent a voice from heaven
[55:50] I meant to let you know the world may be
[55:53] ending friends but there's a there's a
[55:55] deliverance I mean there's a mercy I
[55:58] mean there's a way of escape I mean
[56:00] that's been declared in the same time
[56:02] hallelujah that you don't need to stay
[56:04] here and live under the fear of death
[56:06] and the fear of the world falling apart
[56:08] but you can be rejoicing
[56:10] I mean I've received a word I've
[56:12] received him he is his word you
[56:15] understand me
[56:16] this message is not you know 1,100
[56:18] sermons and and doctrine and different
[56:20] things it's a person being declared it's
[56:23] a person but Jesus Christ being made
[56:25] dong from another world he send a voice
[56:28] amen and he
[56:29] is word do you understand me hallelujah
[56:32] she say you just have to receive him
[56:35] receive that word you said I don't
[56:37] understand it just receive it just
[56:40] receive it as many as received him gave
[56:44] he power to become the sons of God as
[56:47] his in first job what does that mean I
[56:50] need to understand all things just
[56:51] receive him he will lead you and guide
[56:54] you into all truth shall we read that
[56:57] scripture let's go to John chapter 1 I
[57:03] don't have it on the overhead I'm sorry
[57:05] oh I just want to ink of this rule let's
[57:07] not make things complicated the devil
[57:10] likes to try and put scarecrows around
[57:12] to make things complicated forget about
[57:14] the complication she received she
[57:17] received messages from another place and
[57:20] they were representing the God amen that
[57:24] they were following and she received
[57:26] them and she received their word and she
[57:30] got mercy now John 1 and verse 11 know
[57:43] it says and he came unto his own this is
[57:46] Jesus and his own received him not
[57:49] but as many as received him to them gave
[57:54] he power to become the sons of God even
[57:57] to them that believe on his name so if
[58:01] you really receive him who's received
[58:04] not just he you've really received the
[58:05] word in your heart if you've really
[58:08] received him then he gives you power to
[58:11] become a son or daughter he you receive
[58:14] pass through that word to be placed as a
[58:17] son or daughter of God amen if you just
[58:20] have to receive his word that's all you
[58:23] need to do and that word has a power in
[58:25] it to make you what you are meant to be
[58:30] amen is that that's pretty simple if you
[58:33] want life receive the word if you want
[58:36] death you reject the word doesn't mean
[58:39] well I don't understand the whole thing
[58:41] though you just received you got
[58:43] have a a revelation that this message
[58:46] this is a voice from another world
[58:47] brother Branham was stand there he sees
[58:49] I'm standing in two worlds he's looking
[58:52] them at someone in the prayer line and
[58:53] but he's in another world he's in an
[58:55] eternal realm seeing seeing visions so
[58:58] I'm standing in two worlds why why is
[59:01] that he's a prophet he has access to a
[59:02] world that we don't know too much about
[59:06] amen but he's standing there and he's
[59:09] receiving a voice has been transmitted
[59:11] through him
[59:12] not just in visions in discernment but
[59:14] in a word Amen we've had a voice from
[59:18] another world
[59:18] you just got to receive him now I'm just
[59:24] gonna jump right to the e and I'm gonna
[59:25] read something but then we're gonna go
[59:26] back now he's talking about a blind
[59:31] someone who's blind we keep bumping into
[59:36] something this is the words he uses now
[59:40] the only thing who I just posed a
[59:43] question who walks among us who don't
[59:47] just look at me like what he talk about
[59:48] who walks among us every service who's
[59:51] here every sir who's here when you pray
[59:53] not doing about these four walls I mean
[59:56] but when you when you pray when you read
[59:58] your word when you listen to the message
[59:59] that quickens through your heart
[1:00:00] amen when we have prayer meeting
[1:00:02] whatever it may be who walks among us
[1:00:04] it's an eternal one hallelujah and he's
[1:00:08] coming down to influence this world
[1:00:10] amen to influence you hallelujah do you
[1:00:13] understand that
[1:00:14] we may not ever see the pillar of fire
[1:00:16] but we feel we we feel as effects I mean
[1:00:20] we feel the angels of God come around us
[1:00:22] we may never see them with our natural
[1:00:23] eyes hallelujah all of heaven friends
[1:00:29] we're not here alone in this walk I'm
[1:00:33] just going to read this now the only
[1:00:34] thing you do when you die you just
[1:00:36] change those five senses you just
[1:00:39] receive another sense and you're alive
[1:00:40] with a higher sense thousands of times
[1:00:42] higher than this in another life a life
[1:00:48] that there's no death that there's no
[1:00:50] sorrow the things you don't know nothing
[1:00:52] about now you see it plainly when you
[1:00:54] cross there you don't understand it now
[1:00:56] because you're bumping into it this is
[1:00:59] worth he's saying you're bumping into
[1:01:00] any and eternal realm you haven't got
[1:01:03] that since you say I feel a strange
[1:01:05] feeling here tonight looks to me like
[1:01:07] this I just want to cry shout or
[1:01:10] something
[1:01:10] it's the angels of the Lord amen
[1:01:14] what calls us to do these things it's
[1:01:16] it's God it's his angels it's heaven
[1:01:20] influencing this world hallelujah I say
[1:01:23] Lord I want more of it

[1:01:26] this world I'm in the blood of Jesus
[1:01:29] Christ bridges the chasm puts us back on
[1:01:32] speaking terms with God hallelujah
[1:01:35] there's no gulf between us and him
[1:01:36] anymore it's been done away with
[1:01:39] hallelujah
[1:01:40] it's the angel Lord see like somebody
[1:01:43] say you know that never did have a sense
[1:01:44] of sight well once in a while I feel
[1:01:47] something real like a feeling like
[1:01:50] warmth you say it's the sunlight what a
[1:01:54] sunlight I never did see it that I know
[1:01:56] he never did see don't know what it was
[1:01:59] see somebody over there has to tell them
[1:02:01] somebody that can see it oh my see we
[1:02:04] just change we just changed don't be
[1:02:06] afraid of death do you think nothing but
[1:02:09] a scarecrow Jesus conquered it I mean
[1:02:12] that's why he comes service after
[1:02:13] service
[1:02:14] I mean prayer after prayer he walks with
[1:02:17] you I mean not that you just be anointed
[1:02:19] but you would understand this is heaven
[1:02:21] influencing you and then the eternal one
[1:02:23] is walking with us
[1:02:25] hallelujah amen now let's go back up
[1:02:32] Rahab
[1:02:37] Rahab didn't let her old life stop her
[1:02:40] we shouldn't let our old life stop us
[1:02:43] they meant she didn't have a power in
[1:02:46] that day for her to be changed to be
[1:02:48] transformed she was just not even under
[1:02:51] the blood of bulls ago she just received
[1:02:52] a scarlet rope amen and surely had it
[1:02:56] honor and so now here she was and her
[1:02:59] whole life was changed from her life of
[1:03:02] prostitution didn't she received the
[1:03:05] messengers then she put the scarlet rope
[1:03:08] down and from that moment her whole life
[1:03:10] changed and her whole life was went from
[1:03:13] went from a life of prostitution to now
[1:03:16] I've got to get these people in and
[1:03:18] they've got to receive salvation that
[1:03:21] was a whole life now this was the whole
[1:03:23] this was her walk a man was I must get
[1:03:26] these people in whoever they are I've
[1:03:28] got to go but begin hunting the
[1:03:30] predestinated seat hallelujah and as I
[1:03:36] said God speed her family the same
[1:03:40] family that put her on the street was
[1:03:42] the same family Godspeed and God used
[1:03:44] her that they would receive salvation so
[1:03:47] the same ones that mistreated her now
[1:03:49] she turned that around
[1:03:50] not because of what had happened but
[1:03:53] because of the scarlet rope what are you
[1:03:56] looking at now she wasn't looking at
[1:03:58] herself and her reputation and what
[1:04:01] other people thought about her she's
[1:04:02] like I have this I have this rope do you
[1:04:07] follow me I just want this to anchor it
[1:04:08] in real deep your and your life will
[1:04:11] actually be a proof do you have it or
[1:04:14] not
[1:04:15] the life you live will be in evidence do
[1:04:19] you have the scarlet rope or not do you
[1:04:22] have this token this your sign we can't
[1:04:27] let anything hold us back he sees this
[1:04:33] or just we're gonna read a couple of
[1:04:34] things then I'm going to go to tamer
[1:04:40] he says many people thinks today because
[1:04:44] I belong to the church I'm safely
[1:04:47] secured don't don't you believe such
[1:04:49] nonsense win the blood shall be a token
[1:04:52] unto you the spirit now is the token
[1:04:54] unto you the life that was in the blood
[1:04:55] so you gotta have the you gotta have the
[1:04:57] life that was in the blood remember it's
[1:04:59] without money or price jesus paid it all
[1:05:02] you just have to receive him
[1:05:04] you just have to receive him he says
[1:05:10] don't you rely upon know speaking in
[1:05:13] tongues now I believe in speaking
[1:05:14] tongues know nothing else but let the
[1:05:16] token itself be dia the person of Jesus
[1:05:18] Christ his own life in you circumcised
[1:05:21] not just this that but circumcise your
[1:05:23] whole being till you and Christ are one
[1:05:25] Christ in you and his life lives out
[1:05:27] through you amen
[1:05:33] now I want to go to Moses before we go
[1:05:39] to tamer Moses was 40 years on the back
[1:05:42] side of the desert as a shepherd now we
[1:05:46] don't know exactly how long he had this
[1:05:50] Shepherds rod in his hand the one that
[1:05:52] he was going to use to deliver Egypt but
[1:05:55] normally like a writer of stuff you
[1:05:56] maybe get a piece of wood you like and
[1:05:58] you begin to maybe turn it a little bit
[1:06:00] and you make it just right to fit your
[1:06:01] hand and it becomes part of you amen
[1:06:05] it becomes part of you it's just the
[1:06:06] right height right weight whatever more
[1:06:08] so he had he had this and he begins to
[1:06:11] have a debate with God why he cannot do
[1:06:14] the job we all know the story don't we I
[1:06:17] can't speak I can't do this I can't do
[1:06:19] this you know he begins to complain and
[1:06:21] God doesn't God doesn't apologize to him
[1:06:24] sorry I called the wrong fellow I mean
[1:06:27] God when God called Moses he was trying
[1:06:31] to tell Moses now it's not about what
[1:06:33] you think you are it's what I have made
[1:06:35] you to be you got to depend upon what
[1:06:38] God has made you to be amen he with me
[1:06:42] now and the rod that he was carrying was
[1:06:45] the same rod of deliverance that he
[1:06:48] would use to deliver Israel out of Egypt
[1:06:51] and to part the Red Sea and all
[1:06:54] no thanks he was carrying it maybe years
[1:06:56] up to this point but God had to come and
[1:06:59] Commission him it's not enough just for
[1:07:02] something to sit dormant and say well
[1:07:03] I'm a believer I being even baptized in
[1:07:06] water I've done this it's going to come
[1:07:08] to life you've got to come to life
[1:07:09] hallelujah and that's what he that's the
[1:07:12] reason why we have a burning bush
[1:07:13] experience that same God that was in the
[1:07:16] burning bush is here I mean that same
[1:07:18] God that spoke to Moses is here he's the
[1:07:20] same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:22] and he wasn't talk to you and say come
[1:07:25] aside a while
[1:07:26] I want to Commission you for a job
[1:07:28] hallelujah and Moses had a lot of
[1:07:32] regrets no doubt he would have had in
[1:07:34] his mind quite a lot why didn't it go
[1:07:37] right when I killed that Egyptian I I
[1:07:40] thought I planned it right maybe I
[1:07:42] should have done it this way maybe I
[1:07:43] should have done it that way I knew I
[1:07:45] was going to be the deliverer why did it
[1:07:47] go wrong and this would have been
[1:07:49] snowballing in his head for years and in
[1:07:53] and then God comes and speaks to him in
[1:07:56] the burning bush and God has dealt with
[1:07:59] him enough now it's time for him to go
[1:08:01] into service but God didn't apologize
[1:08:04] God got angry at him who made the mouth
[1:08:06] to speak amen
[1:08:09] who made the mouth to speak who made man
[1:08:11] he begins to ask him I made your mouth
[1:08:14] Moses I made you stop leaning back on
[1:08:17] your excuses and serve me amen now this
[1:08:27] is in Romans chapter 10 for moses
[1:08:32] describeth the righteousness which is of
[1:08:34] the law that the man which doeth these
[1:08:37] things shall live by them but the
[1:08:40] righteousness which is of faith speaketh
[1:08:42] on this wise say not a mine heart who
[1:08:45] shall ascend into heaven that has been
[1:08:47] Christ down from above or who shall
[1:08:50] descend into the deep that is to bring
[1:08:52] up Christ again from the dead this is
[1:08:55] not what faces but faiths but what say
[1:08:59] that the word is nigh thee even in thy
[1:09:02] mouth and in thy heart that is the Word
[1:09:04] of Faith which we preach now let's just
[1:09:06] stop there for a
[1:09:07] so it doesn't say it's far away who's
[1:09:09] going to bring it to me faith sees I
[1:09:11] have it
[1:09:11] faith scissors of my possession they
[1:09:14] said in my mouth even in Lionheart
[1:09:16] Amen that's that that is the
[1:09:18] righteousness that is the righteousness
[1:09:21] of faith this is how it speaks it's in
[1:09:24] my possession I'm going to put it into
[1:09:26] action I'm going to not just not just
[1:09:29] hear this word but I'm going to believe
[1:09:31] it
[1:09:31] and I'm going to act upon it I'm not
[1:09:33] just going to be a hero but I'm going to
[1:09:35] be a doer
[1:09:35] I mean applying the token as a doing I
[1:09:38] mean it's not just saying a prayer and
[1:09:41] say well I've done it you put your faith
[1:09:42] into action I mean you go you you go
[1:09:45] after those ones you try to influence
[1:09:47] them towards the kingdom you say God
[1:09:50] this atmosphere of the Holy Ghost which
[1:09:51] is upon me might catch them and they may
[1:09:54] fall upon them hallelujah her whole life
[1:09:57] friends you think about this her house
[1:09:59] was a den of prostitution and then she
[1:10:02] changed it from a dinner prostitution to
[1:10:04] a House of Refuge she raped she would
[1:10:07] have had to rearrange a few things maybe
[1:10:09] open the curtains get rid of the candles
[1:10:11] whatever setup she had she had to
[1:10:13] rearrange a few things a following me
[1:10:16] her face went into action and it should
[1:10:19] be the same thing with us you know let's
[1:10:21] be honest who had some kind of faith
[1:10:24] before they came to the message I'm
[1:10:26] gonna say something real bluntly now if
[1:10:29] you are if you had a face that is
[1:10:31] country to the wood of God you're
[1:10:32] actually an idol worshiper you're
[1:10:35] actually oz worshiping Jesus no Paul
[1:10:38] said in second Thessalonians that they
[1:10:40] would that Satan would be set up in the
[1:10:42] house temple of God being worshipped as
[1:10:44] God and that's just not in the Vatican
[1:10:46] that's in every church that it takes
[1:10:48] creeds and dogmas above the Word of God
[1:10:50] and they fashion an idol so we were all
[1:10:54] a bunch of pagan idolatrous doesn't
[1:10:58] matter doesn't matter whether you like
[1:11:00] it or not that is the scripture where
[1:11:02] people take the word and they provided
[1:11:04] the word and they make it into an idol
[1:11:06] and the worshiping mat and through that
[1:11:09] Idol Satan is receiving worship above
[1:11:11] God they read your Bible so we were all
[1:11:15] idolaters we were all pagan idolatrous
[1:11:18] well I didn't know any better
[1:11:20] yeah
[1:11:21] that may be so but we were all like that
[1:11:24] and this is go another step back we're
[1:11:27] all born and sin shaped at iniquity come
[1:11:30] to the world speaking lives we were all
[1:11:32] born lost amen
[1:11:35] so we all have to come to a point where
[1:11:37] everything we once did we have to count
[1:11:39] it but dung the Apostle Paul says you
[1:11:42] gotta can your whole life your whole
[1:11:44] everything good everything bad well I
[1:11:47] did this for him I did this eunuch and
[1:11:49] all but dung you think the Apostle Paul
[1:11:51] if we went to him before he had the road
[1:11:53] to Damascus perience and we say now Paul
[1:11:55] now Saul his name was Saul now Saul you
[1:11:58] know you're working against God
[1:12:00] you know you're you're actually
[1:12:01] worshipping Satan you know that you the
[1:12:03] priests that you so admire this this
[1:12:06] Jesus the very God of the Old Testament
[1:12:07] said there of their father the devil and
[1:12:09] his works they do do you think he was
[1:12:13] saying oh really he would have got angry
[1:12:15] he would have got very angry how dare
[1:12:18] you say that about my religion
[1:12:19] howdy say that about my Bible teachers
[1:12:21] how dare you say that about my priests
[1:12:23] you're a heretic but he had attended all
[1:12:27] but done all of what he made himself to
[1:12:30] be a Pharisee of the Pharisees he had
[1:12:33] accounted all but done that he may win
[1:12:35] Christ and we have to do the same thing
[1:12:38] all of our old life you can't just say
[1:12:40] well I did this now I do this no that
[1:12:43] has to be counted but done amen are you
[1:12:46] following me it just has to be that way
[1:12:48] you have to because if you say no that
[1:12:51] was fine and now this is just a little
[1:12:52] bit bitter you'll bring a whole bunch of
[1:12:54] what you thought was fine into the
[1:12:55] better you can't do that you've got to
[1:12:58] come out of Egypt you want to call and
[1:12:59] let's see it maybe last Sunday when when
[1:13:02] Moses as parents were saying I mean
[1:13:03] you're going to be the deliverer I mean
[1:13:05] you may be raised in Pharaoh's house but
[1:13:07] you're the deliverer they would have
[1:13:09] poured into him
[1:13:10] maybe I'll Creek what I say or maybe
[1:13:11] clarified a bit more they would have
[1:13:13] poured into him you may be in Egypt but
[1:13:15] you're not meant to be in Egypt this is
[1:13:17] not your final resting place this is not
[1:13:19] your destination you'll just be here for
[1:13:21] a season don't get too attached to this
[1:13:23] world you will be gone God will call you
[1:13:26] and this season and you'll leave this
[1:13:28] place
[1:13:30] that should be what we should point to
[1:13:31] our children Prince giving us heaven is
[1:13:33] our home this is not our home we may
[1:13:36] have to have jobs in education and
[1:13:38] whatever more we build and we you know
[1:13:40] but don't dig your tits takes too deep
[1:13:43] we have to look after our families and
[1:13:45] provide and whatever more amen don't
[1:13:48] neglect those things but don't make it
[1:13:49] you're everything you're everything
[1:13:52] should be this body's going to be
[1:13:54] changed
[1:13:55] I received a short token and it's not
[1:13:58] just going to lift me above a judgement
[1:14:00] and I'm going to keep this this is going
[1:14:01] to be transformed the dead in Christ are
[1:14:03] going to rise first the same token they
[1:14:05] received as good a head has fallen upon
[1:14:07] me we should tell our children we're
[1:14:10] going to hear them and it's far greater
[1:14:13] then the best day you've ever had in
[1:14:15] this world it is far greater it's not
[1:14:18] just a wonderful day and we plan
[1:14:20] everything's nice it's far supreme to
[1:14:21] that amen
[1:14:23] time's up by 10 billion billion billion
[1:14:25] billions and that not there's anything
[1:14:27] bad in heaven but just an illustration
[1:14:29] that'll be like the worst day in heaven
[1:14:31] it's far greater than you can imagine
[1:14:34] i but i won't be able to do a whole
[1:14:36] bunch of things don't worry about what
[1:14:38] you won't be able to do I won't have a
[1:14:41] bit I won't have the devil fighting me I
[1:14:43] won't have sickness I won't have stress
[1:14:46] I won't have uncertainty I mean it's
[1:14:50] gonna be a wonderful place and that's
[1:14:52] just the minimum I mean like the
[1:14:53] smallest but heaven is a lot greater
[1:14:57] than we even really think I mean we're
[1:15:01] brother brave seed it's so sublime it's
[1:15:02] so words can't even describe it
[1:15:05] hallelujah that's what we're aiming for
[1:15:07] and we should be striving say Lord I
[1:15:12] want to rearrange my life
[1:15:14] we shouldn't our lives should be built
[1:15:18] around our walk with God not the other
[1:15:20] way around
[1:15:21] I mean because of you we should build
[1:15:24] our life can I repeat that a few times
[1:15:26] build your life around your walk with
[1:15:29] God not the other way around what a
[1:15:32] center in your life how you do your
[1:15:34] day-to-day whatever you do day-to-day
[1:15:36] whatever you may be doing build it
[1:15:39] around so if it comes in conflict with
[1:15:42] what your walk
[1:15:42] God should be then you rearrange your
[1:15:45] day amen you rearranged your day you say
[1:15:49] well that's works no you have to do
[1:15:51] something God God gave you a free moral
[1:15:54] agency this is God is not going to force
[1:15:57] us through a pipe and make us overcome
[1:16:00] amen he's relying on you to give your
[1:16:05] free moral agency over to him not just
[1:16:08] in the good times but in the hard times
[1:16:10] amen there's a truth of dying daily but
[1:16:13] first you gotta Ischl e die and be born
[1:16:16] again so it's not just in the good times
[1:16:18] it's in the times of adversity when
[1:16:21] things are hard what are you gonna chip
[1:16:23] he's gonna be a jellyfish and throw it
[1:16:24] all the way the devil doesn't take
[1:16:27] prisoners
[1:16:28] amen we have nowhere else to go I'm
[1:16:32] sorry
[1:16:33] thank you I'm not sorry heaven so
[1:16:34] wonderful just press towards heaven
[1:16:36] it'll be worth it all it'll be worth it
[1:16:39] all trust me it will be hallelujah it's
[1:16:43] so much more with now where were we yes
[1:16:48] this is faith the word is not even in
[1:16:52] thy mouth if thou shalt confess with thy
[1:16:57] mouth the Lord Jesus thou shalt believe
[1:16:58] in thine heart that the God has raised
[1:16:59] him from the dead thou shalt be saved
[1:17:01] for the heart man believeth unto
[1:17:03] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:17:04] confession is made of the salvation for
[1:17:07] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[1:17:08] on him shall not be ashamed for there is
[1:17:15] no difference between the Jew and the
[1:17:16] Greek for the same lord as over all is
[1:17:19] rich unto all that call upon him for
[1:17:21] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:17:22] the Lord shall be saved
[1:17:24] I mean and then it goes into but how can
[1:17:27] they hear on this someone has sent in
[1:17:29] how can you know you know so she
[1:17:32] received those messengers I wanna I'm
[1:17:36] running out of time but I want to read
[1:17:38] this a Gentile I hollered a streetwalker
[1:17:41] but she heard him believed she applied
[1:17:43] the token no matter how stooped you are
[1:17:45] and sin what you have done that doesn't
[1:17:48] have one thing to do with it I'm
[1:17:51] hallelujah that doesn't have one thing
[1:17:54] to do with it it doesn't matter where
[1:17:56] you're from
[1:17:56] what you've done you hear the word you

[1:18:24] him by the blood of Lamb and the word of
[1:18:27] their testimony
[1:18:27] you can't ever testimony without
[1:18:29] speaking when you come into court and

[1:18:34] begin to cross-examine you and you don't
[1:18:36] say anything whether what's that gonna
[1:18:38] do what's wrong with this person they
[1:18:41] mean to have it I thought that was the
[1:18:42] star witness in the case they won't say
[1:18:44] anything
[1:18:44] hello friends you got to pray the devil
[1:18:47] says don't don't repeat don't inter end

[1:18:56] tells cuz he just wants to hold you
[1:18:57] there is some statue we're not a bunch
[1:19:01] of did but a stone hallelujah doesn't
[1:19:04] matter how you feel but I'm not worthy
[1:19:06] no matter how stupid you are and sin
[1:19:09] what you have done that doesn't have one
[1:19:12] thing to do with it hallelujah you apply
[1:19:15] the token it doesn't matter what where
[1:19:17] your fro but the devil doesn't want us
[1:19:19] to enjoy it he doesn't want us to get
[1:19:21] into the spirit of the meeting young and
[1:19:24] old he doesn't want us to say yes this
[1:19:26] is for me
[1:19:27] even if it is stripes off your back just
[1:19:30] say Amen there's a reason it's it's done
[1:19:33] hallelujah and it's for our good I mean
[1:19:36] so I just say glory hallelujah be with
[1:19:40] me don't just whatever you do don't you
[1:19:44] say well he'll be done soon and we'll go
[1:19:45] out and we'll do it no this is the most
[1:19:48] glorious opportunity but the devil come
[1:19:51] in your mind and say no this is not for
[1:19:54] you you're too young he talks too fast
[1:19:57] he spits and sweats too much you know he
[1:20:01] does whatever you don't understand him
[1:20:04] this is for you I'm talking about I'm
[1:20:06] talking about receiving Jesus Christ
[1:20:09] lujah now you apply the token it's for
[1:20:12] you if you feel it in your heart there's
[1:20:14] something tugging brother that's us he
[1:20:16] says in some place he says if you feel
[1:20:18] that funny feeling you feel the fur
[1:20:20] that's just God trying to get your
[1:20:22] attention that it's for you if you feel
[1:20:25] in your heart that something's tugging
[1:20:27] it's for you you apply the token and I'd
[1:20:29] say that and even if you feel as dead as
[1:20:31] a post don't go by feelings we we
[1:20:34] believe it then we receive it we take
[1:20:37] him at his word and then we receive it
[1:20:39] so if even if I felt as did it as a post
[1:20:42] I'd say Amen you're calling me God Here
[1:20:46] I am I respond Here I am Lord I take you
[1:20:51] at your word you don't have Calvary for
[1:20:53] me Amen you are my sacrifice your blood
[1:20:57] is more than enough hallelujah you paid
[1:20:59] it all and Here I am that's what I would
[1:21:03] say you know the Prophet came in this
[1:21:05] day and he made it on he said it very
[1:21:08] clearly you never did it in the first
[1:21:11] place you are justified justified means
[1:21:14] it's not just you you're not just
[1:21:16] forgiving but you never did it in the
[1:21:18] first place
[1:21:18] so all the works of the flesh were not
[1:21:21] attributed to you in the beginning I
[1:21:23] mean all the works of your unbelief
[1:21:25] hallelujah they were never attributed to
[1:21:27] you hallelujah
[1:21:28] you never do it in the first place he
[1:21:31] understands we'll just being forgiven
[1:21:33] amen
[1:21:34] but there's no evidence I mean the blood
[1:21:36] destroys the evidence hallelujah it's
[1:21:39] not like he just turned to court tonight
[1:21:40] and the judge says well guilty not
[1:21:43] guilty and let's look at the evidence
[1:21:44] all not guilty but the evidence is there
[1:21:46] there's no evidence
[1:21:48] hallelujah this is what the blood does
[1:21:50] and there's well this message to be sent
[1:21:52] the Prophet a voice from another world
[1:21:55] came down through a vessel and said to
[1:21:58] you you never did it in the first place
[1:22:00] you're the sinless spotless bride of
[1:22:03] Jesus Christ and as many as received him
[1:22:05] may be power to become the sons of God
[1:22:08] even if believe on his name hallelujah
[1:22:11] there's nothing held against us Rahab
[1:22:13] wasn't worried
[1:22:18] [Applause]
[1:22:20] I'm in the scallop that's all she cared
[1:22:23] about she wasn't right or am i worthy to
[1:22:25] have this and hang it up and do whatever
[1:22:27] more how she said I have I have my
[1:22:31] deliverance and this rope was going to
[1:22:33] take me to another world I mean because
[1:22:35] she was in her house as no mice around
[1:22:38] and then a few days later I'm in the
[1:22:41] city was no more now was under Israelite
[1:22:44] control she was in another world
[1:22:46] hallelujah what do you have in your hand
[1:22:51] what is the night hang more than just a
[1:22:54] rod more than a scarlet rope I mean by
[1:22:57] God Himself and it's not in your hand
[1:22:59] it's in your heart
[1:23:00] hallelujah what do you possess you got a
[1:23:03] look at what you have I mean if we were
[1:23:06] going to war the first thing you look at
[1:23:08] is what kind of weapons do we have and
[1:23:09] can we overcome the enemy with these
[1:23:11] weapons and if we did would say let's go
[1:23:14] we're going to win hallelujah that's the
[1:23:17] same thing with us the devil wants you
[1:23:19] to think well you've just got this
[1:23:20] little buddy like a musket or bone arrow
[1:23:23] whatever more baby you got to look at it
[1:23:26] differently David had a sling and he had
[1:23:29] some stones and those were the one thing
[1:23:31] if you looked at all the weapons of
[1:23:33] Israel Saul would have had the best
[1:23:35] sword the best spear the best armor all
[1:23:37] these things and they were just said no
[1:23:39] this won't do me any good but from a
[1:23:42] cattle cattle point of view it's saying
[1:23:45] how you're gonna kill this man with the
[1:23:46] stone he's not a bear or a lion or some
[1:23:50] kind of thing this is a different enemy
[1:23:51] but he just knew I overcome this enemy I
[1:23:55] overcome this enemy this this this
[1:23:57] glides on the same category the same
[1:23:59] level Amen as these other ones and I'll
[1:24:02] use this and you just going to take with
[1:24:04] what God has given you and then he took
[1:24:06] with what God had equipped him with and
[1:24:08] he used it and he fired that rock and it
[1:24:11] went straight to the killing place and
[1:24:13] it's down the Giants hallelujah just go
[1:24:16] with what you've got
[1:24:16] you say well I can sing sing to the
[1:24:19] glory of God
[1:24:20] I can play doesn't matter how good play
[1:24:22] to the glory of God I can pray
[1:24:25] I can have it I've got a testimony I
[1:24:27] mean I understand how how how the
[1:24:29] Prophet would testify of many things and
[1:24:31] then God would come down and people
[1:24:33] would be healed and delivered because of
[1:24:36] a testimony hallelujah
[1:24:38] Mary went to Elizabeth's house and
[1:24:41] Elizabeth had not failed John jump in
[1:24:43] her womb and a testimony and then the
[1:24:46] name of Jesus Christ brought that baby
[1:24:48] to life hallelujah
[1:24:51] what are you have in your hand what do
[1:24:54] you have use what you have
[1:24:55] I fast like this other person now God
[1:24:58] made you you use what you have
[1:25:02] hallelujah now I was gonna mention this
[1:25:07] very quickly but in the book of Genesis
[1:25:12] we're not gonna read the scripture well
[1:25:16] the whole thing it's a whole chapter
[1:25:20] that's here so I don't have it in my
[1:25:22] notes now this is Genesis 38
[1:25:28] this is tamer tamer was married to Judas
[1:25:34] son but he was evil this is the
[1:25:37] scripture and God killed him and then so
[1:25:40] Judah told his other son you marry Tamar
[1:25:43] and then your children will actually be
[1:25:46] your brother's children but he wouldn't
[1:25:48] he wouldn't have children with tamer
[1:25:51] so God killed him and then so Judah said
[1:25:54] I have other sons but they're too young
[1:25:56] go back to your father's house until
[1:25:58] they're old enough and then you then you
[1:26:02] can marry one of them now there's
[1:26:04] something now let's just think at this
[1:26:06] think spiritually for a little bit
[1:26:07] there's something in the believer they
[1:26:10] must receive life they must receive this
[1:26:13] is not about natural natural life this
[1:26:16] is spirit there's a reason she's in the
[1:26:18] in that genealogy because Jesus had to
[1:26:21] come out of the tribe of Judah and so
[1:26:24] they had to be a child of Judah that
[1:26:26] would continue the line and the devil
[1:26:28] voice tries to stop the life coming a
[1:26:31] menace like Sarah was 25 years and and
[1:26:34] and i think even rebecca different ones
[1:26:36] they you know they couldn't have
[1:26:38] children right away
[1:26:38] because the devil tries to stop the life
[1:26:40] but there's something in the believer
[1:26:42] I must receive life now here she is
[1:26:46] something in her now this is just I I
[1:26:48] don't understand this I was dryers like
[1:26:50] my this is this is to me this is God
[1:26:53] just goes beyond and he allows a woman
[1:26:55] to deceive her father-in-law dresses up
[1:26:59] as a harlot allows her to receive - to
[1:27:02] deceive her father-in-law that she he
[1:27:06] basically uses her she becomes pregnant
[1:27:09] with his child and then he gives her his
[1:27:14] staff and Signet different things as a
[1:27:16] as a deposit for I think a goat or
[1:27:18] something that he is going to pay her
[1:27:21] worth for what they did and she becomes
[1:27:24] pregnant now Judah gets angry because
[1:27:28] she hears he hears that her
[1:27:30] daughter-in-law has been a harlot and so
[1:27:33] he says now we're gonna burn her now
[1:27:35] here's tamer know you just think about
[1:27:37] this obviously that's what they did in
[1:27:40] those days they burnt people who were
[1:27:43] caught like an adulterer of harlotry
[1:27:45] whatever more they burnt them but here
[1:27:47] she was something was moving in her
[1:27:49] I must receive life I must receive life
[1:27:53] and I'm not worried about the stigma or
[1:27:57] the potential penalty that may come upon
[1:28:00] me I don't care about what people will
[1:28:02] think of me yeah he followed me I don't
[1:28:05] care about what my family will think of
[1:28:07] me or what the community will think of
[1:28:09] me I'm wearing to take it I'm willing to
[1:28:11] take upon this shape that I would
[1:28:14] receive his life and I will have his
[1:28:17] child hallelujah because it's like if
[1:28:20] you see now it's gonna put brother our
[1:28:22] months 3 generations up on here hell
[1:28:24] they basically are Amanda's
[1:28:26] time-traveled or your grandad is time
[1:28:29] travel I'm not sure which one because
[1:28:31] they all look the same
[1:28:32] there's a family resemblance they
[1:28:35] following me it's uh I was gonna do it
[1:28:39] but anyway
[1:28:41] maybe next time but you see but it's
[1:28:44] more than just now with God it's more
[1:28:46] than just natural or he looks like this
[1:28:48] and this it's a nature to life and so
[1:28:52] she was willing something inna said I
[1:28:54] must receive the life of of the Father
[1:28:57] because I want to be a child in his
[1:28:59] image I mean I must receive that life
[1:29:03] that I'll produce a life that's just
[1:29:05] like his life hallelujah
[1:29:07] so she was willing to take upon the
[1:29:10] shame she's going to dress up as a
[1:29:12] harlot she played you hey I might get
[1:29:15] burnt
[1:29:15] I might get burned for this wickedness
[1:29:18] but God allowed it to happen because she
[1:29:21] was driven are you following me she was
[1:29:24] driven I must receive life I must
[1:29:27] produce this life hallelujah and it's
[1:29:30] the same thing now as everyone's kind of
[1:29:33] looking at me like this is a bit
[1:29:34] different but I want you to think about
[1:29:36] it there's something in the believer I
[1:29:38] don't care what people will think of me
[1:29:40] I don't care what people will say about
[1:29:42] me I don't care if they make fun of me
[1:29:44] if they think I'm weird or crazy or go
[1:29:47] off the deep end
[1:29:48] I must receive life I want to produce a
[1:29:51] life of God in me although bring your
[1:29:54] life into me may be produced I want to
[1:29:56] produce a child in your image hallelujah
[1:29:59] she was driven amen and she received it
[1:30:02] hallelujah amen and that's in the
[1:30:05] lineage of Jesus Christ God allowed that
[1:30:08] in there that God is saying there's
[1:30:10] something in in the Bride of Christ
[1:30:12] she must receive life she's driven
[1:30:15] you're driven people whether you
[1:30:18] understand or not and I and I'm just
[1:30:19] going to close with that thought and God
[1:30:21] allowed that to happen hallelujah
[1:30:24] that she would be in the lineage see you
[1:30:27] got to read that lineage it's not all
[1:30:29] the people all the most holy and the
[1:30:31] sacred and the greater than mouth and
[1:30:33] everybody's got it all together none of
[1:30:35] them had it together
[1:30:36] none of them had it in one piece none of
[1:30:39] them had it sorted never knew what was
[1:30:41] going on
[1:30:42] hallelujah they're just walking on in
[1:30:44] life and now the most I love them the
[1:30:47] most beaten scarred wounded complex
[1:30:51] human beings they
[1:30:53] you could imagine but God said it's this
[1:30:55] one I'm gonna use this one suddenly we
[1:30:58] are not going to use the other one that
[1:30:59] may that may be the right one to to to
[1:31:01] men's ideas I'll take the broken and the
[1:31:04] wounded and the complexed and the
[1:31:06] scarred and the hurt and will express my
[1:31:09] life through those people hallelujah and
[1:31:12] I'm one of them one of them I'm so glad
[1:31:16] that I can say I'm one of them
[1:31:17] hallelujah one of them one of them are
[1:31:21] you one of them
[1:31:22] God this is God's grace he doesn't care
[1:31:25] where you're from what you've done
[1:31:28] you could have willfully did it she
[1:31:30] willfully did it I'm not excusing yo sin
[1:31:33] but she she planned it
[1:31:34] I must have life I'm going to deceive
[1:31:37] him I know this is gonna happen and then
[1:31:40] she comes out to be burnt and then she
[1:31:44] says by the man who owns this stuff and
[1:31:46] the Signet different things I have the
[1:31:48] child and he says you are more righteous
[1:31:51] than me and God attributed his son
[1:31:57] coming to the earth through that act you
[1:32:01] think about that for a second God
[1:32:03] attributed that he knew it was going to
[1:32:05] happen he knew he knew what state tamer
[1:32:08] would be in he knew our state Rahab
[1:32:10] would be in he knew what state Ruth
[1:32:12] would be in he knew what state that that
[1:32:14] Bathsheba would be in holier he knew
[1:32:18] they'd be this way because he wanted you
[1:32:20] to know this is the kind of people I use
[1:32:23] this is the kind of people I have chosen
[1:32:25] there's the kind of people I've elected
[1:32:27] I mean this is my kind of people
[1:32:29] hallelujah that's why I say don't worry
[1:32:32] about what you've done

[1:32:36] don't worry about them they're under the
