[31:18] will you be stared by the devil this way
[31:20] that way you know and be controlled by
[31:22] something that's not the Lord hallelujah
[31:24] the Lord wants to take control amen and
[31:28] his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke
[31:31] shall be destroyed it because of the
[31:34] anointing amen because of the anointing
[31:36] of the Holy Ghost see the Holy Ghost and
[31:38] the anointing of God comes to destroy
[31:41] the enemy's works it comes to heal it
[31:43] comes to break spells to break
[31:45] witchcraft to break curses from families

[31:51] to heal from generational sicknesses and
[31:54] heal from things that has hurt you and
[31:56] and complexes and all these burdens that
[31:59] human beings pick up and carry and they
[32:02] don't need to we don't have to the
[32:04] anointing is here and let me say that
[32:07] you are anointed I want you to just say
[32:10] I am anointed
[32:11] I am anointed Hallelujah you know he
[32:15] made you hype our Kings and Priests he's
[32:17] made us Kings and Priests a priest must
[32:20] be anointed and so when you follow that
[32:23] thought every believer is Anointed
[32:26] Hallelujah
[32:30] amen
[32:32] you know I want to just now just go to 1
[32:34] Samuel chapter 16 11 to 13 and you see
[32:38] that David was anointed by the prophet
[32:40] here hallelujah and you know that you've
[32:42] been anointed by a prophet's message
[32:44] you're Anointed with an open book
[32:46] message you're Anointed with an
[32:48] unlimited release of God's word of God's
[32:52] anointing and this is an anointing that
[32:54] is so powerful that it will change your
[32:56] bodies
[32:57] this is so if you think of this
[32:59] anointing that's so powerful to change
[33:01] your bodies how much can it deliver you
[33:04] from Little complexes and headaches and
[33:06] and sicknesses and ailments and
[33:07] hindering things that God wants to break
[33:10] Cycles in your life Hallelujah God wants
[33:12] to have a powerful prayer meeting
[33:14] tonight that will change lives forever
[33:16] Hallelujah and he wants you to gain
[33:18] access to know that you've got access to
[33:20] the anointing that he's given you for
[33:22] the prayer meeting and it's not based on
[33:24] your behavior it's not based on how well
[33:27] you perform today
[33:28] I just want you to I want to clear that
[33:30] it was later on but let's clear that now
[33:31] it's not based on your performance or
[33:34] your behavior it's based on on your
[33:36] motive it's based on are you doing it
[33:38] because of Love or are you doing it
[33:40] because you want to show selfishness you
[33:42] see if you you do it because of love
[33:44] then it'll flow amen because you believe
[33:47] and there's love and it will flow in the
[33:49] spirit of God will begin to operate
[33:52] no it's not now now when you have
[33:54] condemnation and when you have doubts
[33:56] and when there's flusterations it
[33:58] hinders the power it breaks it pulls the
[34:00] fuse out
[34:01] you know that you you start getting
[34:03] condemned by your own behavior and you
[34:04] think I haven't performed today and and
[34:06] I've done these things wrong and I
[34:08] Bachelor them today or I thought that
[34:10] and I did this and that's all the devil
[34:12] wants for you to get into that state so
[34:14] that God can't use you but you see
[34:16] without when you don't when you have
[34:19] faith and when your motive is pure and
[34:22] and and and there's a pure Selfless Love
[34:25] motivating you the anointing will flow
[34:27] freely in your life and it's your it's
[34:30] the anointing that God's given you amen
[34:31] so let me just go to 1 Samuel chapter 16
[34:34] and it says and Samuel said unto Jesse I
[34:37] hear all thy children
[34:39] and he said There remaineth Yet the
[34:41] youngest and behold he keeps the sheep
[34:43] and Samuel said unto Jesse send and
[34:46] fetch him for we will not sit down until
[34:49] he comes hither
[34:50] and he sent and brought him in now he
[34:53] was Ruddy and with all of a beautiful
[34:54] continents and goodly to look to and the
[34:57] Lord said arise anoint him for this is
[35:01] he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and
[35:05] anointed him in the midst of his
[35:06] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[35:09] Upon David from that day forward
[35:12] Hallelujah and we know the results
[35:15] Hallelujah who knows the results
[35:17] that's the results of the anointing
[35:19] Hallelujah and that anointing you even
[35:22] as we heard on Sunday David longed to
[35:24] for that to be in him it was only around
[35:26] him that's in you hallelujah it's not
[35:29] just falling on you you're not just
[35:31] anointed in the spirit or In the Flesh
[35:33] you're anointed in the soul and it's

[43:04] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[43:07] the Lord your God that has dealt
[43:09] wondrously with you

[43:53] Hallelujah
[43:54] Hallelujah
[43:56] Glory
[43:59] amen
[44:04] and it shall come to pass afterwards

[44:22] to go down a little track before we go
[44:24] to prayer of the the anointing is not
[44:27] based on Election like that that's not
[44:31] based on Behavior it's not based on
[44:33] anything other than he said I'll pour it
[44:35] out on All Flesh and so there's an
[44:37] anointing that comes on false prophets
[44:38] good prophets all sorts of different
[44:41] people even Kings Hallelujah God even
[44:44] calls Cyrus his anointed you know that
[44:47] I'll read it soon God calls King Cyrus a
[44:50] Babylonian Idol worshiper has anointed
[44:52] and I thought my goodness if if God can
[44:55] call a Babylonian King has anointed how
[44:58] much more can his bride be anointed but
[45:00] she spends too much time and fear and
[45:03] broken down and condemned by her own
[45:05] conscience because she's seen a holy
[45:08] image preached in front of her and
[45:10] people hiding their true self and
[45:12] because of it she's condemned all the
[45:14] time and down but don't be
[45:16] operate living the supernatural
[45:19] Hallelujah based on how good you behave
[45:22] today it's not based on how good a year
[45:24] you had it's based on your motives it's
[45:26] based on your faith it's based on you
[45:28] believing
[45:30] Hallelujah now that doesn't mean you
[45:32] shouldn't repent when you do wrong
[45:34] Hallelujah

[46:27] your young men shall see visions
[46:30] and I believe that I believe that that
[46:32] is happening
[46:34] I believe that this is happening right
[46:35] amen amongst us hallelujah it's because
[46:38] if God is faithful right
[46:40] our daughters are prophesying our sons
[46:42] are seeing visions and and men are
[46:44] Dreaming Dreams and young men you know
[46:46] this is God speaking to us he's leading
[46:49] us because the Sons and Daughters of God
[46:51] are led by the spirit of God
[46:53] amen hallelujah and I want you to be led
[46:55] tonight in prayer Hallelujah I want you
[46:57] to be free to tap into the anointing in
[47:00] your life God's anointing is here God's
[47:03] heart is towards those requests and all
[47:05] the unsung requests that people haven't
[47:07] mentioned and the things that's going on
[47:09] in your life Hallelujah the Philistines
[47:11] are here goliaths are standing waiting
[47:14] for to be defeated although you know the
[47:16] Devil he's just waiting to be defeated
[47:18] God created an enemy that somehow keeps
[47:22] getting in the battle and he knows he's
[47:23] gonna die
[47:25] Glory he knows he's going to be defeated
[47:27] he knows it's over for him and he's
[47:29] still so proud and so stubborn that
[47:32] he'll still fight you to the end
[47:35] and I thank God even though we don't
[47:38] like it it's record Hallelujah we may
[47:40] not understand every battle we go
[47:41] through but it's for the good
[47:43] Hallelujah because God is exposing
[47:46] things in our life that has come from
[47:48] the past that's come from things that's
[47:50] been done hallelujah that he wants rid
[47:53] of because the anointing is here to
[47:55] break those things the anointing is here
[47:57] to break those habits tonight to break
[48:00] those things that's holding you down to
[48:01] break thoughts that are not meant to be
[48:03] there that have somehow attached
[48:06] themselves as a stronghold in your land
[48:07] and every time that cycle comes down and
[48:10] the Philistines set themselves an array
[48:11] to come and take your wheat Hallelujah
[48:14] God said your wheat shall be full
[48:17] Hallelujah your vets shall be full of
[48:19] wine and oil you shall be anointed your
[48:22] life shall be anointed your family shall
[48:24] be anointed your walk shall be anointed
[48:27] your church life should be anointed amen
[48:29] everything about you should be anointed
[48:32] Hallelujah
[48:34] amen
[48:36] Satan hurt not the oil and wine
[48:39] amen stop
[48:40] damning the people now we have to rise
[48:44] up above those things and discern the
[48:45] enemy
[48:46] because the enemy Hallelujah is snaky
[48:49] and snarly and slimy and he sneaks him
[48:52] tries to condemn you for thoughts that
[48:55] he put in your mind
[48:57] try to condemn you for for trapping you
[49:00] and he'd spend ages and he creates all
[49:03] these billion dollar movies to trapular
[49:07] and then you fall and then you go in the
[49:10] Trap and then he condemns you for the
[49:11] Trap that he made for you
[49:13] oh my
[49:15] don't own it
[49:16] Hallelujah for tonight you see what the
[49:19] devil wants is for you to not access
[49:21] your anointing When you pray
[49:23] for you to just go through the motion
[49:25] and have another church service another
[49:27] prayer meeting and walk out the same
[49:30] walk out and all you did was set a
[49:32] prayer but what God is calling us to do
[49:35] tonight amen is to really tap in to that
[49:39] Supernatural gift in your life amen to
[49:42] that Supernatural calling in office as a
[49:45] priest
[49:46] as a king a priesthood has Dominion
[49:50] I mean a king has dominion and a priest
[49:53] has access
[49:54] Hallelujah you're anointed to access the
[49:57] anointing in the Supernatural of God
[49:59] hallelujah
[50:04] amen
[50:07] I'm about to close
[50:08] and my people
[50:10] shall never be ashamed amen
[50:13] and also upon the servants and upon the
[50:15] handmaids in those days will I pour out
[50:17] my spirit Glory
[50:19] amen
[50:21] you know
[50:23] as condemnation looms down upon you as
[50:26] you begin to get into its a rut and you
[50:28] feel like you haven't performed or
[50:30] you've done something and there's just
[50:31] unable to to to make it right
[50:34] Hallelujah God is faithful and just to
[50:37] forgive you
[50:38] Hallelujah says if we confess our sin
[50:41] the moment it leaves your lips children
[50:44] adults
[50:45] the moment
[50:47] that it leaves your lips
[50:49] you're forgiven
[50:50] it's it's finished Hallelujah the blood
[50:53] is enough
[50:54] remaining under the anointing despite
[50:56] daily failure see this is what the Lord
[50:59] is calling us to for the gifts and
[51:01] calling of God or without repentance
[51:02] amen Jesus says that you may be the
[51:05] children of your father which is in
[51:06] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[51:09] the evil and on the good and sends rain
[51:11] on the just and on the unjust and even
[51:14] Cyrus as God's anointed
[51:17] known as God's anointed in Isaiah 45
[51:20] verse 45 it says thus saith the Lord to
[51:23] his anointed to Cyrus
[51:25] whose right hand am I holding to subdue
[51:28] Nations before him
[51:30] all right and you know how God used
[51:32] Cyrus to bring forth the restoration of
[51:34] the Jewish temple and and and bring
[51:36] forth the second temple and the building
[51:39] amen so you see God can use someone that
[51:43] hasn't performed very well
[51:44] amen I'm just showing you that that's
[51:46] not based on your performance it's not
[51:48] based on your behavior it's based on
[51:50] faith it's based on finding God's will
[51:52] it's based on finding what does God want
[51:54] with the situation Hallelujah and and
[51:57] dying to yourself we'll get to that in a
[51:59] second brother Brandon says this and
[52:01] this is the second hindering point that
[52:04] would hinder is selfishness amen
[52:07] selfishness is a very big issue because
[52:09] half the time there's no demons involved
[52:11] that you can cast out you can't cast
[52:13] yourself out amen so if there's a
[52:16] selfish nature within you it needs to be
[52:18] you need to change that you see the uh
[52:21] Paul says to the Ephesians or I think it
[52:23] says now put put off the old man in all
[52:25] his ways and put on the Lord Jesus
[52:27] Christ and begin to conduct yourself
[52:30] hallelujah amen because there's certain
[52:33] things that just requires you to change
[52:34] your habits and begin to become selfless
[52:37] Hallelujah if you want access to the
[52:40] supernatural become selfless amen get
[52:43] lost the Lord show me Lord where I'm
[52:46] selfish show me Lord the hindering
[52:48] selfishness in my life so that you can
[52:50] operate through me oh my Lord help us
[52:53] amen
[52:55] you can as brother random I think you
[52:57] said this about self-recision come up
[52:58] and get anointed with oil from all the
[53:01] preachers but unless but that's not
[53:03] going to do anything it's actually
[53:04] you've got to do the opposite
[53:06] Hallelujah he says here
[53:08] Hallelujah in God's only provided place
[53:10] of worship he says now if you get
[53:13] everything running just right it's going
[53:15] to run everything's set in order
[53:17] if there's a short in that wire that
[53:20] light won't come on
[53:22] it's talking about the power of God but
[53:24] because it's been grounded and when
[53:26] you'll take one of God's words or one of
[53:29] his places and in your own heart have
[53:31] selfish objectives
[53:34] selfish objectives it'll ground the
[53:37] power of God right there
[53:41] oh if you do it because you want to be
[53:44] smart you won't or you want to be
[53:46] different from somebody else or
[53:48] something right there it's grounded
[53:51] Hallelujah
[53:53] that's true
[53:55] right there it's grounded it'll blow the
[53:58] fuse
[53:59] you're wrong you've got to come with
[54:01] sincerity with all your heart and your
[54:03] motives and your objectives placed right
[54:06] on God
[54:08] then search for his place find where he
[54:10] said and bring it there amen hallelujah
[54:14] as I said come into God's world find
[54:17] God's mind about it see prayer is not
[54:20] changing God's mind it's not you begging
[54:22] before God that he will be have mercy
[54:25] and change his mind towards the
[54:26] situation it's now coming before God in
[54:29] worship and approaching him with
[54:31] Thanksgiving in your heart and praise
[54:33] into his courts and and when he comes he
[54:35] begins to reveal to you the very
[54:37] discernment of the of the situation and
[54:40] then you begin to speak and then you
[54:42] begin to pray and the anointing that is
[54:45] allotted to you begins to operate
[54:48] Hallelujah we all have offices there's
[54:50] places and callings in our lives and
[54:52] when you find that there is glory and
[54:54] power and authority that is attached to
[54:57] that office
[54:58] Hallelujah mothers there's an anointing
[55:01] for you
[55:02] an authority hallelujah hallelujah
[55:06] fathers there's an anointing for you
[55:08] Authority glory and power that's
[55:11] attached to that office it's a privilege
[55:13] before God Amen
[55:16] Hallelujah and all office bearers and
[55:19] all callings and Ministries and all the
[55:22] different helps and governments and
[55:24] places in the church Hallelujah when you
[55:26] find your calling when you find your
[55:28] position there's an anointing that is
[55:30] attached to it there's an authority
[55:31] that's attached to it and when you find
[55:33] that and when you begin to pray along
[55:35] those lines you'll see God answering
[55:37] your prayers you'll see Supernatural
[55:39] things happen but when you go in just a
[55:42] general and you and you pray for this
[55:44] and you're praying and you're trying to
[55:46] answer into that and doing that work in
[55:47] that Ministry and everything and you
[55:49] wonder why is it not Supernatural why is
[55:52] God not answering these things but he's
[55:53] answering them because see they've
[55:55] tapped into their office they've tapped
[55:57] into their anointing they've tapped into
[55:59] their calling an election and God is
[56:00] honoring the office amen
[56:03] Glory that's why when you go to the
[56:06] pastor God will honor the office of the
[56:08] pastor to help you to change things in
[56:11] your in your situation and discern
[56:13] situations in your life because he's
[56:15] honoring the office and there's an
[56:17] anointing that comes with the office
[56:19] amen that's why it's so important that's
[56:22] why Peter said when you make your
[56:23] calling and election sure you should
[56:26] never fall or fail meaning that you're
[56:29] you've been established and then you
[56:31] begin to pray according to those
[56:33] giftings in your life there is an
[56:35] anointing there is an attached Authority
[56:37] that goes with it
[56:39] and that's why it's important tonight
[56:42] that when we pray you know you're
[56:44] praying through that office of your own
[56:46] life you know who you are God's revealed
[56:49] to you your ministry and you begin to
[56:51] pray in that Spirit you begin to pray
[56:52] under that inspiration and God begins to
[56:55] answer your prayer and he begins to
[56:57] change the situation around you
[57:01] Hallelujah
[57:02] are you with me
[57:03] that's not too technical
[57:05] that's not that this is this is this is
[57:08] true
[57:09] dynamics of calling an election
[57:16] amen
[57:23] Hallelujah
[57:25] can we have the musicians
[57:27] we'll sing a couple of songs before we
[57:29] go to pray
[57:30] you see this anointing
[57:33] when it begins to flow you will find
[57:35] that your motive is love you will find
[57:38] that the love of God is Flowing your
[57:40] motive isn't I've got to do this because
[57:42] I've got to prove myself I've got to do
[57:44] this because I was told to do this by
[57:46] other people or I've been pressured into
[57:49] it by a culture or by a certain Church
[57:51] Spirit or the spirit of somebody else or
[57:54] mother and father Spirit but I've been
[57:56] motivated by love I love these people I
[58:00] love this I love God and I want to do
[58:02] that which is is pleasing to him my
[58:05] motive isn't because I'm going to go to
[58:07] hell if I don't do it my motive is
[58:09] because God I love him amen because I
[58:12] love him and so I'm anointed despite
[58:14] performance
[58:16] um it's based on faith and not Holiness
[58:18] amen and yet God calls Holiness he calls
[58:22] for us to Perfection and to be
[58:23] Perfection but it's his record that he's
[58:26] seeing it's not your record amen the
[58:29] Lamb's Book of Life is the Lamb's Book
[58:30] of Life not your book of life it's the
[58:33] Lamb's record that's what the lamb has
[58:35] done it's what he did in your Steve so
[58:38] that you could be perfect before God and
[58:40] when you come before him amen and you
[58:43] confess your sins and you make it right
[58:45] even tonight before we pray maybe it's
[58:48] time just to make things right before
[58:50] God so that you can pray and all he sees
[58:53] is perfection amen hallelujah we don't
[58:57] approach God tonight based on our
[58:58] performance Hallelujah the supernatural
[59:01] it's based on ceasing all selfishness
[59:03] and believing God
[59:06] Hallelujah and I just want to finish
[59:08] tonight
[59:10] Samson
[59:11] Hallelujah all his life
[59:14] everything was all wrong and out of
[59:16] cater he allowed lust to rule him and he
[59:20] allowed these spirits to come and he got
[59:22] tantalized by Philistines and and by the
[59:25] Philistine woman and it brought him down
[59:27] you see there was a lot of self involved
[59:31] and it was not really working the way it
[59:34] should and he found himself he found
[59:36] himself in a grinding meal Hallelujah
[59:39] going round and round and round
[59:41] and his eyes were plucked out but you
[59:44] can see now as the Bible said when
[59:46] Samson finally died to himself when
[59:50] selfishness was gone when selfishness
[59:52] had been died too and he was completely
[59:55] surrendered and he was helpless
[59:57] Hallelujah and and all his selfishness
[1:00:00] was gone he said let me die and to
[1:00:03] avenge mine enemies and the Bible said
[1:00:06] that Maul was killed in his death than
[1:00:09] in his life and so I want to encourage
[1:00:11] you tonight that as we pray let's stand

[1:00:28] can see the enemy come down amen Samson
[1:00:31] died physically but God is calling us to
[1:00:34] lay on the altar
[1:00:35] he's calling us to lay on the altar
[1:00:38] amen who's here tonight to say just once
