[30:22] here I pray one more time please grind
[30:24] it father in Jesus Christ they may ask
[30:26] these things amen amen so a few if
[30:31] you've got your Bibles handy I'd like to
[30:33] read a couple of portions of scripture
[30:35] if we'll go to I'd like to read from the
[30:39] book of Ephesians and chapter 6 and then
[30:41] we're going to go to first Corinthians
[30:43] chapter 14 we're going to read a portion
[30:45] of Scripture there like to tonight I'd
[30:50] like to begin a thought on battle
[30:54] tactics I want to speak on battle
[30:56] tactics and I want to go if I I won't
[31:00] finish it now but i'll pick it up some
[31:02] other time maybe on Sunday but I just
[31:05] that's that's really where I want to go
[31:07] you know battle plans battle tactics are
[31:08] in a battle and so let's just read some
[31:11] scripture here let's read so Ephesians 6
[31:14] from verse 10 and I trust this is all
[31:17] familiar with you it says finally my
[31:20] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[31:24] the power of his might put on the whole
[31:26] armor of God that you may be able to
[31:28] stand against the wiles of the devil for
[31:30] a wrestle not against flesh and blood
[31:32] but against principalities against
[31:35] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[31:37] this evil world against spiritual
[31:39] wickedness in high places and we read
[31:43] that verse 13 as well wherefore take
[31:45] unto you the whole lot of God that you
[31:47] may be able to withstand in the evil day
[31:49] and having done all to stand and then
[31:53] we'll go to first Corinthians chapter 14
[31:56] so it's amazing we've got where Paul has
[31:59] revealed things to the ephesian church
[32:01] he hasn't revealed to any other Church
[32:03] how they've been there have been
[32:04] quickened you know how they've been
[32:05] passing death unto life God's mercy has
[32:08] saved them then up there there be sealed
[32:10] into the kingdom and all these things
[32:12] but yet he says now now brethren put on
[32:15] the whole armor of God and now we're go
[32:17] to battle we're going to push the front
[32:19] the battlefronts got to go out and where
[32:21] to meet the enemy in these things so you
[32:22] know it's a yeah it's an incredible
[32:25] thing and it's all read first
[32:26] Corinthians 14 and verse 8 yes as a
[32:29] context it's his proof the trumpet give
[32:32] an uncertain sound who shall prepare
[32:35] himself to the battle I mean may the
[32:38] Lord bless us would you may you
[32:39] be seated I want to speak I want to
[32:43] begin I don't know how this is going to
[32:44] go but I want to speak about battle
[32:46] tactics now it is there's three things
[32:49] as we read there in first Corinthians 14
[32:52] it says if the trumpet gives an
[32:54] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[32:56] himself to the battle it and we read
[32:58] there in Ephesians that we have been
[33:00] armored we've been equipped for this
[33:01] battle against against the enemy and
[33:03] when we find an unseen enemy but in any
[33:06] battle there's three things you must
[33:08] know before you go into battle you must
[33:10] know what your battlefield us you must
[33:13] know you better fill the layout of the
[33:15] trainer all these things you must know
[33:17] your enemy his tactics and his weapons
[33:20] and then you must know about you and
[33:23] your tactics and your weapons if you
[33:25] don't know you're you know if you don't
[33:27] know any of those three things you're
[33:29] going to lose you to get beaten but if
[33:31] you know all those three things then you
[33:32] can prepare your forces you can train
[33:35] your men a certain way you can be
[33:36] prepared to meet and brother branham he
[33:39] speaks in the contest he speaks about
[33:41] when he was a you know wit yo when he
[33:45] was a boxer and he uses this is just now
[33:47] I know there's an old saying that people
[33:50] are an old saying that's not solely the
[33:53] people don't believe in demons in this
[33:54] day but the thing to do to my opinion is
[33:57] know your enemy and know your enemy and
[34:01] train for the contest that you're going
[34:03] to have when you meet him because you're
[34:06] going to meet him and know him no no
[34:10] what his strength 'as and then trained
[34:12] for this contest when you do meet him
[34:15] for it's one thing sure you're going to
[34:17] meet him and so you trained for the
[34:19] contest now training for a contest is
[34:22] just like a boxer his enemy he's going
[34:25] to meet out there in a contest to fight
[34:27] a real good fighter usually knows and
[34:30] studies his opponent he studies his
[34:32] licks knows where he fights for whether
[34:35] he leans forward on backwards hangs back
[34:38] fights right-handed or left-handed he
[34:40] studies all of us and then if he's a
[34:42] good smart fighter he gets him a
[34:45] sparring partner that will fight just
[34:47] like his opponent fights for he'll know
[34:49] all of his licks when he
[34:52] it's that place and I think that's a
[34:54] very good thing for a Christians to do
[34:56] that's right and now if you want to
[34:59] start training start with john three
[35:01] sixteen the golden rule which is for God
[35:03] so loved the world he gave His only
[35:04] begotten Son start right out with that
[35:07] and that'll get you on the floor and
[35:08] then train for the knockout punches
[35:11] because you're going to have to use them
[35:14] everyone knows that you've got to train
[35:16] to hit your enemy and always God uses
[35:19] his word we must remember that God uses
[35:22] his word to defeat his enemy if God
[35:24] would think or could have give us people
[35:27] anything better defeat the enemy with he
[35:29] would have done so as I always said when
[35:32] God makes a decision that's the best
[35:35] that there is he never has to alter his
[35:37] decisions so the first decision God gave
[35:40] his people the Garden of Eden to combat
[35:42] the enemy was his worth they will
[35:44] fortified with his word now so we must
[35:49] understand Sosa brother I'm saying on
[35:51] danse in town in terms we must we must
[35:53] train we must study our enemy we must
[35:56] observe how it works and we must adjust
[36:00] ourselves and and be trained then
[36:02] whenever he uses as tactics we can
[36:04] combat as tactics and combat as weapons
[36:06] because if we don't study our enemy
[36:08] something can suddenly blindside us and
[36:11] it can just be the devil giving a
[36:13] testing blow to see you know because
[36:15] when you box you don't normally just go
[36:17] for the knockout punch when you begin
[36:18] with you begin to test test your
[36:20] opponent stem and I've know I've only
[36:23] ever watch boxing I'll do a box of my
[36:24] life but you see they you know i guess
[36:26] i'm testing jabs and they test the enemy
[36:29] see how fast they are on their feet and
[36:30] how fast they can move their weight and
[36:32] all these things and they're every
[36:35] bidding could you because it's one thing
[36:36] to train but i think when you're in the
[36:38] regular and it's really happening and
[36:40] the devil many times he just he just
[36:42] gives a test punch to see and sometimes
[36:46] yeah and if you're not prepared for a
[36:48] punch it will floor you and so many
[36:51] things Christians can be blindsided by
[36:53] something it's only a test page of the
[36:55] devil and their whole life has turned
[36:58] upside down and they say how did the
[37:00] come to this what why is that because I
[37:03] haven't studied their opponent so we
[37:06] need to study our opponent yeah now our
[37:09] brother Graham says so and then but the
[37:11] first thing is we must know what our
[37:13] battlefields us and since we wrestle not
[37:16] against flesh and blood but against
[37:18] principalities spirits and things in
[37:20] high places we do not this is not a
[37:23] physical war we don't have to physically
[37:24] train an army and you know the other
[37:28] brand tells us and we can see it yo in
[37:30] the scripture that the battlefield is a
[37:33] human mind that is the mutual mutual
[37:36] meeting ground because a battleground is
[37:38] like World War one there's no man's land
[37:40] and you're reading especially in the Old
[37:42] Testament where we are where armies
[37:45] would fight that have a mutual ground
[37:46] where they would set up their troops on
[37:48] either side and and normally it's not
[37:51] given initially just and all that
[37:52] assault but you test the weaknesses of
[37:55] of your enemy and how they set up and
[37:57] you test their skill and their strength
[37:58] to see that's like Goliath he went out
[38:01] there and gave us challenge and the
[38:03] Philistines are on this side and the
[38:05] Israel was on the other side there was
[38:07] that mutual meeting place in the middle
[38:10] so you must know you must know your your
[38:13] battlefield and you must know the
[38:15] conditions of your battlefield you know
[38:18] many many armies have made mistakes
[38:19] because they've used the wrong weapon in
[38:21] the wrong place because it's not
[38:23] suitable for the battlefield you take
[38:27] you take some of the English victories
[38:28] when they had long boys back in the day
[38:30] buddy battlefield the French had their
[38:32] heavily armored horses they just got
[38:34] bogged down in the battlefield and they
[38:35] and an English one why cuz the French
[38:38] didn't didn't see what their battle food
[38:42] that what was the terrain you know and
[38:45] and because they didn't use the right
[38:46] weapon in the right place they lost your
[38:51] iron others is very may be very
[38:52] elementary but I trust I trust you it
[38:54] makes sense maybe if you don't know if
[38:58] you don't know the condition of your
[38:59] battle food you saw just a human mind
[39:01] well what makes up the human mind right
[39:03] right you know if you don't know what
[39:04] makes up the human mind it once again
[39:06] the devil just blindside you with a
[39:07] punch and then you think you're being
[39:10] led by god and you're being led by your
[39:11] feelings
[39:12] some some memory or something that's not
[39:14] according to the word and you're
[39:16] defeated and you just being dragged
[39:19] along the ground as a piece of spoil of
[39:21] war she must know what you battlefield
[39:24] us now brother Bram said here he said
[39:26] this this isn't the greatest battle ever
[39:27] fought he says now before any battle can
[39:30] be put in a raid they first have to
[39:32] choose a meeting ground or a place with
[39:34] the battles to be fought a selected
[39:36] place it is in the First World War it
[39:38] was so placed in no man's land and
[39:40] places where they fought and they've got
[39:44] to be a place selected like when Israel
[39:46] way toward the Philistines a hill on
[39:48] each side were they gathered and as we
[39:50] glide would come out call to the armies
[39:52] of Israel that's where David meet him in
[39:54] the valley when he pressed over the
[39:56] little creeks that run between the two
[39:58] hills he picked up the rocks there has
[40:00] to be a place selected a mutual ground
[40:02] and no man's land there's what brother
[40:04] brams tell him this he's saying this is
[40:07] what your mind is this is what the
[40:08] stopped 22 inches is he's actually
[40:10] calling it no man's land it's calling
[40:13] this no man's land oh it's my mind I'm
[40:15] thinking no it's no man's land yes it's
[40:19] no man it's a mutual ground what does no
[40:22] man's land neither power it doesn't
[40:25] belong to either power try mine think
[40:29] about it good you just I wish I had some
[40:31] photos of some no man's land from from
[40:33] world war one and two it's just mud
[40:36] nothing living as when the enemies come
[40:39] along because the devil has plan is to
[40:42] destroy kill maim just tear down
[40:44] whatever God is built right and some
[40:47] people's minds you go Google the song or
[40:50] you know one of Passchendaele or one of
[40:53] the great battlefields of World War one
[40:55] mud dead bodies trenches not a single
[41:00] living thing and that's what people's
[41:02] minds that's what people's minds look
[41:04] like out there in the world that's right
[41:06] it's just carnage yeah you like it or
[41:10] not that told us and we're not exempt
[41:13] from it now there's a place he says
[41:18] there's a battle front where they meet
[41:20] and test their powers where each army
[41:22] tests its strength against the other
[41:23] army a mutual meeting place
[41:26] that he says now don't miss this now
[41:28] when he says don't message it means
[41:30] means pay attention when this great
[41:32] battle started on earth there had to be
[41:34] a mutual meeting place they had to be a
[41:36] place selected for the battle to begin
[41:38] and for the bell to reach and that
[41:40] battle ground begins in the human mind
[41:42] that is where the battle starts the
[41:44] human mind was chosen for the place of
[41:46] the battle where it was begin and that
[41:48] is because that decisions are made from
[41:51] the mind the head now they never started
[41:55] it from some organization they never
[41:58] started it from some mechanical affair
[42:00] the ground never started there there for
[42:02] the organization can never never do the
[42:05] work of God because the battle grounds
[42:06] where you've only got to meet your enemy
[42:09] is in the mind you've got to make your
[42:11] choice it meets you I want this little
[42:15] girl whether it's very sick to be sure
[42:16] to lose with us now real closely
[42:18] decisions are made in the mind at the
[42:20] head that is where say can meet you and
[42:23] the decisions are because that god made
[42:26] man that way so God actually made you
[42:30] that this is no man's land God built you
[42:33] so this is no man's land and everyone
[42:36] thinks they can just do it their way now
[42:39] who are you does this land you know it's
[42:42] like pobres progress they came to a
[42:43] certain way and they they begin to walk
[42:45] along Emanuel's ground and Beulah land
[42:47] and the omega bjorlin but-but-but
[42:49] Emmanuel's ground that's God's ground as
[42:52] a scott brown or as a muddy metal field
[42:55] where it's just death and just mud
[42:58] churned up by just thinking dead dead
[43:01] things everywhere or is this actually
[43:03] God's ground where God is actually
[43:05] places you know because of a phenom ii
[43:08] takes a no man's land it becomes their
[43:10] position and the no man's land is pushed
[43:12] out when they make their advance so what
[43:18] is this life is it God's as its agents
[43:22] or was it just a big churning
[43:24] battlefield now he says this in 2nd
[43:29] Corinthians 10 for though we walk in the
[43:31] flesh we do not war after the flesh for
[43:34] the weapons of our warfare are not
[43:36] carnal
[43:37] just Leslie but mighty through God to
[43:40] the pulling down of strongholds casting
[43:41] down imaginations imaginations part of
[43:45] the mind route and everything that
[43:47] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[43:48] God and bringing into captivity every
[43:50] thought to the obedience of Christ
[43:53] because remember your mind is more than
[43:55] just that's your imagination conscious
[43:58] reasoning of fiction conscience that's
[44:01] your mind so if those blah are those are
[44:05] subject to the word of god c he says
[44:08] you're going to bring every thought
[44:09] subject to the Word of God and if it's
[44:13] not brought subject then the devil can
[44:15] come in because because one person asked
[44:18] brother Branham how do I know i'm
[44:19] thinking God's thoughts he says God's
[44:21] thoughts of the word yeah if your
[44:24] thoughts on anything if your thoughts
[44:28] are contrary to the scripture get rid of
[44:30] those thoughts and don't pay attention
[44:33] to those sorts don't feel condemned that
[44:36] you think them because at the end of the
[44:37] day this is no man's land and it's just
[44:41] a devil testing strength he puts the
[44:44] thought in your mind or something comes
[44:45] on way he's just testing strength he's
[44:48] doing a pro as he week here's he went
[44:50] there that's right as she week here week
[44:53] there right yep NFU if you actually lay
[44:57] hold of that thought and begin to ponder
[45:01] upon that thought what's happening the
[45:03] devil's digging trenches and he's
[45:05] putting in sandbags and machine-gun
[45:07] emplacements and then more to things and
[45:09] some heavily art I you know artillery
[45:11] he's he's fortifying up yeah that's
[45:13] really the strongholds that we're called
[45:15] the pull down in here yeah and then paul
[45:19] also says do not give place to the devil
[45:20] what does that mean give place you
[45:23] retreat you give ground drunken ground
[45:25] to Satan push forward Amy I mean how do
[45:28] you do that take order this would right
[45:30] no devil may try and hang around for a
[45:33] while resist the devil and he shall flee
[45:36] glory he didn't say how quickly he's
[45:38] gonna flee be going to resist them hey
[45:40] Betty resistance like a scrub and rugby
[45:41] right
[45:43] if ever the defensive scrub hey they're
[45:45] resisting yep no you take some little
[45:48] spine let your little small team against
[45:50] some big islands a team or something
[45:52] those Ford's know they're going to be
[45:53] pushed over by that big island theme of
[45:55] Theodore careful yeah actually I
[45:57] actually have to resist the scrum you
[45:58] got to actually put some forces to
[46:01] resist yeah man that's not just roll
[46:05] over and die because you're soft a man
[46:07] thank God it is work he said well he's
[46:10] not retreating just keep swinging that
[46:12] word of them I'm not feeling for a good
[46:14] buyer stripes I'm here yes my swords not
[46:17] very sharp supply bit more force
[46:19] it'll still cut his head off eventually
[46:21] menu preset menu is gonna just keep
[46:23] swinging hello just tell you any word
[46:26] you say yeah because the devil will tell
[46:28] you that's not doing any good that's
[46:29] right but it is doing good he just
[46:31] doesn't want you to know you know why
[46:33] the British were called redcoats you
[46:36] know why they're wore red coats exactly
[46:39] so so when they got wounded the people
[46:42] couldn't see the blood so here's your
[46:44] commander whatever they did going into
[46:46] battle covered in a red coat now if he
[46:49] dies or gets wounded inners it as men
[46:51] will will begin to falter but if they
[46:54] can't see the blood he just he just says
[46:55] charge on boys they'll take cars no
[46:58] charge on it's like the devil he doesn't
[47:01] want you to realize that he's wounded
[47:03] that the word is actually passing and
[47:05] chopping him
[47:07] so you just got up yes you just have to
[47:11] take this word you so don't know the
[47:13] whole Bible used in one scripture you
[47:15] when when the devil came against Jesus
[47:18] Jesus just selected from a whole arsenal
[47:20] we just picked one he just picked one
[47:22] bullet hood unless got any fire glory
[47:26] man shall not live by bread alone but
[47:27] every word that proceeds out of the
[47:29] mouth of God Moses work that would be me
[47:31] you shall not tempt the LORD thy God he
[47:34] just took he just took one thing and
[47:36] this was his big this was the big
[47:38] contest because the devil came against
[47:40] Moses Moses felt the devil came here
[47:42] Saul the prophets they felt came to give
[47:44] David a sinner and and safe intent to
[47:47] David this is when he's on the throne
[47:49] he's kicking everything and he felt so
[47:53] you're the devil's probing at people
[47:55] here to go with Jesus and Jesus just
[47:58] took the word just just one phrase you
[48:01] just took one phrase and you use it and
[48:04] it defeated Satan amen hallelujah meal
[48:07] so you know we have to we have to
[48:11] identify this is a battlefield there's
[48:14] no man's land but Roy but what are you
[48:16] doing with it you know if people are
[48:21] afraid you look at you look at you look
[48:23] at warfare real warfare that is
[48:26] victorious is not defensive No the whole
[48:30] armies army study how they can get
[48:34] inside the thought pattern will command
[48:36] structure of different armies and if
[48:38] they can actually break up actually get
[48:41] inside their plantings actually they
[48:43] plan things before the enemy can react
[48:44] to it then they have that enemy that's
[48:48] how Americans that's how although
[48:50] military's in the army I mean you're in
[48:52] the world they plan and they have their
[48:54] intelligence they know how the enemy's
[48:56] command structure works and they
[48:58] actually can identify what the enemy is
[49:01] going to do and they get with inside
[49:03] their commands into how how they think
[49:06] yeah because if you can get there before
[49:09] the enemy gets there you've got them if
[49:10] you're one step ahead so if you're
[49:12] always advancing you're one step ahead
[49:15] that's how the I know it's probably a
[49:18] lot of examples but that's
[49:19] thee you know they got a bunch of South
[49:21] Africans ins and Bob lands that were
[49:23] mercenaries from from South Africa they
[49:25] took them up to Nigeria and they drove
[49:28] out that a Muslim fanatical group there
[49:30] and how they did it as they were just
[49:33] always advancing once they engage in the
[49:37] battle they just continuously were
[49:39] advancing until they drove them out
[49:41] until they captured their headquarters
[49:42] that's how they did it so they didn't
[49:45] just fight a battle now rested and
[49:47] fighter bell now rest which is a
[49:49] constant rotation of forces and the
[49:52] enemy could build a fort yo they
[49:54] couldn't build a defensive line to hold
[49:56] the enemy back and now driven out yummy
[50:00] men may be right don't build the
[50:02] defensive line we're fortified behind
[50:05] the wood but our defenses move with us
[50:07] hey Laurie he's going to take God at His
[50:09] Word yes sir now so the the battlefield
[50:15] is the mind now I want to go into I want
[50:19] to maybe kind of do a bit of an overview
[50:21] we have our our battlefield
[50:24] intelligences prophecy because if you
[50:27] know all the enemy is going to do then
[50:28] you can combat what he's going to do and
[50:30] you can see what he's going to do just
[50:32] like the great thing when they when they
[50:34] crack the Enigma code and the second
[50:37] world war against the Nazis and when the
[50:39] Americans they they crack the Japanese
[50:41] code so when they see an intelligence
[50:44] coded messages to their different places
[50:46] they they would intercept those messages
[50:49] they knew what the enemy was doing yeah
[50:51] now we have we have in the scripture God
[50:55] just hasn't revealed himself in the
[50:57] scripture but he's fully exposed Satan
[51:00] what he's doing and so if we can see
[51:03] what Satan is doing then we can we can
[51:06] prepare ourselves member because we've
[51:08] got a training area to me that's right
[51:09] and if we can see what the enemy is
[51:11] going to do we can train ourselves that
[51:13] when he does what he says he's going to
[51:14] do we can defeat him amen but if we
[51:17] trained for the wrong kind of battle you
[51:19] know you just know she's going to be a
[51:21] big failure like what is the point of of
[51:23] training some troops to find in the
[51:25] Arctic when you send them to the jungles
[51:29] yeah what is the point of training for a
[51:31] battle that was like an azusa street or
[51:34] in Luther's day at the devil's advanced
[51:36] to hear what is the point yeah see
[51:40] you're just going to be whipped by the
[51:41] enemy right so we have to identify what
[51:45] Satan is doing and then if we identify
[51:47] that then we can combat so we're just
[51:49] going to read some scriptures if you'd
[51:52] like to turn 22 Isaiah chapter 14 and
[51:55] then I'm just going to read a couple
[51:57] more then I'm going to then we're going
[51:59] to go to Genesis now this is more just
[52:02] an overview kind of evening here so
[52:07] Isaiah 14 and brother Brown says just
[52:12] you're just as you're turning their
[52:14] brother Gramps is in the second seal he
[52:16] says now you see Satan raises those up
[52:20] what's the shrewdness of this fellow
[52:22] that we're talking about here Satan
[52:24] where we're unfolding him right here
[52:27] we're stripping them down by the
[52:29] scriptures and letting you see who he is
[52:32] and what's what is supposed to be done
[52:35] so we've actually saying now we just
[52:38] need just the devil is the most exposed
[52:40] big amen upon this earth it can't hide
[52:44] he can't hide from the Word of God right
[52:46] you can't hide an ecard I'd either and
[52:48] he works cloak and dagger he doesn't
[52:51] want to be seen but this message that we
[52:53] have received at the same time just
[52:54] exposes heads right and it works not
[52:57] just in an international level with down
[52:59] and turn enter your address and we're
[53:02] going to go down into that burst want to
[53:03] show you this here Isaiah 14 verses 12
[53:06] to 2 16 I trust this is familiar to you
[53:10] he says how thou art fallen from heaven
[53:13] o Lucifer son of the morning how they
[53:16] were cut down to the ground with Dennis
[53:18] week in the nation's for thou has seen
[53:21] in thine heart now the heart of Satan's
[53:23] being exposed the officer divine heart
[53:25] all ascend into heaven I'll exalt my
[53:27] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[53:30] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[53:32] in the sides of the north I will ascend
[53:35] above the heights of the clouds I will
[53:37] be like the Most High see saying I will
[53:40] be worshipped as
[53:41] God yet thou shall be brought down to
[53:44] hell to the sides of the pit they that
[53:46] CD an early look upon the in consider
[53:49] these saying is this the man that made
[53:51] the earth to tremble that does take the
[53:53] kingdoms and made the world as a
[53:55] wilderness and destroyed the cities
[53:58] thereof that opened not the house of as
[54:01] prisoners so Isaiah God is showing
[54:04] Isaiah this is this is Satan's motive he
[54:07] says I'm going to be God so let's also
[54:12] turn to 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 now
[54:18] remember this is prophecy what Isaiah is
[54:21] seeing is prophecy of future events and
[54:26] we can actually see that they are
[54:27] actually coming into manifestation in
[54:30] this very present day that we live in so
[54:34] now sick of this loading is to and will
[54:37] read from verses 1 to 6 it says here for
[54:40] yourselves brethren wait no I humming
[54:44] first so I'm a first this'll only think
[54:46] of this load ends now we've receipt you
[54:48] brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[54:49] Christ and by our gathering together
[54:51] unto him that you be not soon shaken in
[54:54] mind nor be troubled neither by spirit
[54:58] nor by word nor by letter as from us as
[55:01] that the day the Lord is at hand let no
[55:05] man deceive you by any means for that
[55:07] day shall not come except there be come
[55:09] a falling away first and we've seen that
[55:12] falling away and that this man of sin be
[55:14] revealed the son of perdition and he's
[55:16] been revealed who oppose us and exalted
[55:19] himself above all that is called called
[55:21] God or that is work or that is
[55:23] worshipped so that he as God sitteth in
[55:26] the temple of God showing himself that
[55:28] He is God remember he not that when I
[55:31] was yet with you I told you these things
[55:34] and now you know what withholdeth that
[55:37] he might be revealed in his time for the
[55:41] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[55:42] only he who now letteth will let until
[55:45] he be taken out of the way now this is
[55:51] paul is saying it hasn't happened yet
[55:55] you know but it shall happen yeah he
[55:57] says this that the day of the Lord it
[56:01] says that they have crisis it had he
[56:02] says let no man deceive you by any means
[56:04] that they shall not come except there
[56:06] come a falling away first and then the
[56:08] Madison be revealed being worshipped as
[56:11] God and we have the state of the
[56:14] Scriptures fulfilled so when so when
[56:17] Paul was looking into the he was looking
[56:20] 2,000 years down the road and he was
[56:22] seeing just a few verses but it's taken
[56:25] Satan two thousand years to go from just
[56:29] a mystery of iniquity working until
[56:32] full-blown now the whole world worships
[56:34] Satan and so this is if this is his as I
[56:38] said prophecy is intelligence
[56:41] battlefield intelligence and we've just
[56:43] rid of you this is this is Satan's
[56:46] intent now as i'm going to i want to be
[56:48] gone and i want to be worshipped now if
[56:52] that is if that is his plan then now
[56:57] what are his tactics to do that and
[57:02] inside eggs also read will just read one
[57:07] more revelations three we just read one
[57:09] more this because this is prophecy as
[57:11] well and it speaks for our day and i'll
[57:15] go into these things lord willing in a
[57:17] greater detail but i just want to show
[57:20] you that if this is this is Satan's plan
[57:22] then we should actually see it if we go
[57:26] through a history which actually see it
[57:27] unfolding itself that's like DJ DJ
[57:31] started with an idea they had a at a
[57:34] top-secret meeting we need to invade
[57:36] France America's during the war you know
[57:38] now we can actually take the battle back
[57:40] to Hitler back into the mainland and it
[57:42] started just with a plan a secret plan
[57:44] and then they gathered the men they did
[57:46] the training that built the barges they
[57:48] built the ship site had the supply chain
[57:50] intervention it was they were on
[57:51] Normandy Beach yeah but it all started
[57:55] just with a few million an idea and this
[57:58] profits the same thing it's just it's
[58:00] just a few words saying this is what
[58:02] Satan is going to do but now we can see
[58:05] it's gone beyond that already now so
[58:07] revelations three
[58:08] and verses 14 to 22 now this is this is
[58:11] speaking of LH as his answer and unto
[58:14] the Angel of the Church of the Lady of
[58:16] cns write these things saith the Amen
[58:17] the faithful and true witness the
[58:20] beginning of the creation of God I know
[58:22] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[58:24] hot I would that their work cold or hot
[58:27] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[58:30] neither cold or hot old speedy out of my
[58:32] mouth because they'll see us I am rich
[58:35] and increased with Goods and have need
[58:36] of nothing and now it's not that thou
[58:38] art wretched am Israel poor and blind
[58:40] and naked i counsel thee to buy Oh me
[58:43] gold tried in the fire that thou mayst
[58:45] be rich and white raiment that thou
[58:47] mayst be clothed and at the shame of thy
[58:50] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[58:52] eyes with I sell that they may see as
[58:54] many as I love i rebuke and chasten be
[58:57] jealous therefore and repent behold I
[58:59] stand at the door and knock If any man
[59:01] hear my voice and open the door I will
[59:03] come into him and will sup with him and
[59:05] he with me to him that overcometh will I
[59:07] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[59:09] as I also overcame and have sit down
[59:12] with my father and his throne he that
[59:14] has an ear let him hear what the Spirit
[59:16] says to the churches so this is prophecy
[59:18] when when John sees us he's seen two
[59:20] thousand years down the road and he's
[59:22] saying that Jesus is kicked out of of of
[59:25] the church world this is where he says I
[59:28] standard or not that's because Jesus has
[59:30] been kicked out of his own as I'm church
[59:33] yeah the church world has has kicked
[59:36] them out now so this is prophecy
[59:39] speaking of today and since Satan wants
[59:43] to be worshipped as God then he has to
[59:45] dethrone or dispose the one who's being
[59:48] worshipped and place himself because the
[59:51] devil currently pervert things so he has
[59:53] to get rid of God who was the word and
[59:56] then place himself there yeah that's
[59:58] right so now let us go to Genesis
[1:00:03] chapter 3 and i'm just going to just
[1:00:07] briefly i want to show you here how how
[1:00:14] the serpent came against eve is how it
[1:00:18] comes against an h he comes against the
[1:00:21] church
[1:00:21] he comes against the family he comes
[1:00:24] against an individual ok so these these
[1:00:29] are these are part of his tactics yep so
[1:00:35] now we'll go to rip Genesis chapter 3
[1:00:38] because remembered Genesis it means it
[1:00:41] means us everything's in its seed form
[1:00:43] so what evers plaza de genesis will grow
[1:00:47] into full maturity down at the end of
[1:00:49] all things so how how Satan how Satan
[1:00:52] attacked Eve he'll use the same method
[1:00:55] all the way down and he'll use this
[1:01:00] against you kill you he and he wasn't
[1:01:04] afraid to come against Jesus if they'll
[1:01:06] be he said you're the Son of God get
[1:01:08] yourself off the cross perform a miracle
[1:01:10] all these things he he's praising he has
[1:01:14] no respect for you right he has no
[1:01:16] respect for a family for a real dad a
[1:01:18] real mum a real daughter or son or has
[1:01:21] no respect for us Genesis 3 and verses
[1:01:27] will just read verses 1 2 3 we'll just
[1:01:31] go down to verse 5 actually now the
[1:01:34] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[1:01:37] of the field which the Lord God had made
[1:01:39] and he said unto the woman yea hath God
[1:01:41] said so we're just going to read this
[1:01:43] through they're going to break it down
[1:01:44] yea hath God said you shall not eat of
[1:01:46] every tree of the garden and the woman
[1:01:49] said unto the serpent we may eat of the
[1:01:51] fruit of the trees of the garden but the
[1:01:53] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[1:01:55] of the garden God hath said ye shall not
[1:01:57] eat of it neither you should show you
[1:02:01] touch at least you die and the woman I
[1:02:04] mean saying the serpent said unto the
[1:02:06] woman you shall surely not die for God
[1:02:09] does know that in the day ye eat thereof
[1:02:12] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[1:02:14] shall be God's knowing good and evil so
[1:02:19] this is this is the devil's method this
[1:02:22] is the devil's method I'm going to break
[1:02:24] it down now the first thing he does
[1:02:26] member member this is no man's land this
[1:02:28] is no man's land so the first thing he
[1:02:31] did is he appealed to her
[1:02:33] nning to her mind she he appealed her
[1:02:35] yea hath God said so now he's going to
[1:02:38] bring forth a reasoning did God really
[1:02:40] say that did he really did he really
[1:02:42] mean this what he said you know their
[1:02:46] Bible would have been very short those
[1:02:47] days but he could have held it up is it
[1:02:49] and that as this really means what it
[1:02:52] says and then also notice he says he
[1:02:56] says yay hath God said g.o.d if you go
[1:03:00] to Genesis 1 when God is making the
[1:03:02] creation before man comes into the
[1:03:04] picture as he isn't God created heavens
[1:03:06] and earth and God said let there be
[1:03:07] light of God said this but then when man
[1:03:10] comes into the picture says and the Lord
[1:03:11] God right now that may not mean a whole
[1:03:15] bunch but if you go back into the Hebrew
[1:03:17] that word God they're just God means
[1:03:19] Elohim the self-existing one so here's
[1:03:22] the self-existing one but then the Lord
[1:03:25] God it actually means a self existing
[1:03:28] one who expresses himself or the self
[1:03:31] existing one that I just find that
[1:03:33] actually the definition because it's
[1:03:34] quite beautiful he says so so the
[1:03:38] primary primary meaning of the name
[1:03:40] Lord's this is from Lord God as Jehovah
[1:03:42] the self-existing one literally he that
[1:03:45] is who was there for the eternal I am
[1:03:47] but however from which Jehovah or Yahweh
[1:03:50] has formed signifies also to become that
[1:03:53] is to become knowin that's pointing to a
[1:03:57] continuous and increasing
[1:03:58] self-revelation compile combining these
[1:04:01] meanings of hover we arrive at the
[1:04:03] meaning of the name Jehovah as the
[1:04:06] self-existent one who reveals himself so
[1:04:10] this Lord God is actually the self
[1:04:12] existing one who reveals himself who is
[1:04:15] he revealing himself to to his children
[1:04:17] so it means it means once he was a self
[1:04:20] existing one but then when he put people
[1:04:23] upon the earth that he could relate to
[1:04:25] and he could speak to that he can make
[1:04:27] himself known to he became the Lord God
[1:04:30] who reveals himself so he is the one who
[1:04:33] once was just just the self-existing
[1:04:36] thing you know just like if this if this
[1:04:40] pulpit was eternal you could say this is
[1:04:43] just a self existing
[1:04:44] thing it doesn't talk to you it doesn't
[1:04:46] it just exists and exist by itself but
[1:04:50] then if this pulpit had a mind and a
[1:04:52] head thoughts that have began to speak
[1:04:54] to you it would be the self-existing one
[1:04:56] that that reveals himself so you would
[1:04:59] have a relationship with this yep so now
[1:05:03] God is God as places children upon the
[1:05:05] earth and then he begins to reveal
[1:05:07] himself make himself known to Adam and
[1:05:09] Eve say he's change but then when Satan
[1:05:14] comes along he says he doesn't say yay
[1:05:16] have the lord god said so it doesn't say
[1:05:19] he has this god that has revealed
[1:05:22] himself to you that you have a
[1:05:23] relationship with as he said this he
[1:05:26] says yay had the self-existing one that
[1:05:29] doesn't speak well it's just as he just
[1:05:32] exists jay has he said so what he's
[1:05:35] actually doing as he's chained he's he's
[1:05:37] changing her reasoning one to question
[1:05:40] the word that was given by God but to to
[1:05:43] question as this God really this one who
[1:05:46] makes himself known to you or is he just
[1:05:48] a distant God so Satan came along and
[1:05:51] said basically he said God hasn't spoken
[1:05:54] to you God hasn't made himself known to
[1:05:57] you God has some distant being someplace
[1:05:59] that just exists that we just talked
[1:06:01] about this is what he's doing to eat I'm
[1:06:04] just breaking it down so he's he's
[1:06:07] throwing the question out there he's
[1:06:09] actually questioning Eve's revelation of
[1:06:11] who God is because she only knows him as
[1:06:15] this one who reveals himself your
[1:06:17] brother Graham tells us during the cool
[1:06:18] of the evening you know God would come
[1:06:20] down and as great glory and then the
[1:06:23] head speak to adam and eve and said no
[1:06:24] children have you enjoyed your day upon
[1:06:26] the earth have you enjoyed the goodness
[1:06:28] and all and that's a yes father was a
[1:06:30] beautiful that we did this and thus it
[1:06:32] was wonderful but they had a
[1:06:33] relationship but the serpent the devil
[1:06:37] is trying to twist Eve's understanding
[1:06:40] of God and change her revelation of who
[1:06:43] God is into something that that is not
[1:06:45] anymore and you could take that he was
[1:06:51] God the self-existing one in a previous
[1:06:53] age
[1:06:54] so what what what what he was doing what
[1:06:58] the devil always does and brother bear
[1:07:00] him he he he says it out of the quote on
[1:07:03] me but he says that they will let you do
[1:07:05] will let you know what God did a Moses
[1:07:07] day was perfectly well he'll he know
[1:07:09] what he didn't know as they was
[1:07:11] perfectly well he'll let you know what
[1:07:13] he did in Jesus day was perfectly well
[1:07:15] but when it comes to the promo scripture
[1:07:17] of this day all he has to do is take you
[1:07:20] from what he's doing in this day and
[1:07:21] then he can basically inject this poison
[1:07:23] doctrine to that gap because God is the
[1:07:27] IM he's the present God he's you're
[1:07:29] fooling his word today yeah that's right
[1:07:31] all Satan had to do there and and
[1:07:35] Moses's day was get the people to
[1:07:37] believe it wasn't the season and they
[1:07:39] would never have left Egypt even though
[1:07:42] he did supernatural things all these
[1:07:43] things if they just got to believe no
[1:07:46] Moses you're not the delivery this is
[1:07:47] not the time that would have set their
[1:07:51] just like we know we mussst i cometh
[1:07:54] you'll do these things the woman at the
[1:07:55] well you know the scribes and Pharisees
[1:07:58] they said no this is not the season had
[1:08:00] come to us this is not her what's
[1:08:02] happening the scribes and Pharisees who
[1:08:03] try to take the people back to a
[1:08:05] previous age you try to take the back
[1:08:07] when the season where the law was going
[1:08:10] to be fulfilled in Jesus Christ had come
[1:08:12] and the sacrifice daily sacrifice is
[1:08:15] going to be done away with it's what the
[1:08:17] serpent didn't hear yay had God said
[1:08:19] yeah this being who was of a past age
[1:08:21] but he's unfolded himself more down
[1:08:24] through me so he'll take you that it
[1:08:28] will take you back yay the god of Luther
[1:08:30] and the god of Luther's the real true
[1:08:33] and living God but we know I'm a bit
[1:08:34] more today yeah the god of azusa street
[1:08:37] we believe what happened in azusa we see
[1:08:39] gifts we see supernatural we believe in
[1:08:42] these things amen not just talk about it
[1:08:47] we've experienced that have we not
[1:08:48] everybody oh I'm not trying to take away
[1:08:51] because as soon as people say what are
[1:08:52] you questioning that no God ads on plus
[1:08:55] here you justify Lou Thursday then he
[1:08:58] added sanctification
[1:08:59] in the end of the restoration of the
[1:09:00] gifts the end of God coming and dwelling
[1:09:02] in his people he didn't take away from
[1:09:04] what happened in those four majors he
[1:09:05] just built up God is a God of addition
[1:09:09] or subtraction hey so you know but then
[1:09:12] the devil take you back yay hath God
[1:09:14] said yay had the god of Irenee acid' and
[1:09:18] all right and already I said true things
[1:09:20] but you don't want to Steve just back
[1:09:22] there you understand what I'm saying if
[1:09:25] you if you negate what's happened today
[1:09:27] and go back to a formal thing what's
[1:09:29] happened evel's taking you back
[1:09:30] somewhere else even though it's true yea
[1:09:34] hath God the self-adjusting one year's
[1:09:35] real the devil doesn't the devil he's
[1:09:38] smart if he can give you to believe
[1:09:40] there's no God that he'll tell you that
[1:09:41] if we can see how these people really
[1:09:43] believe in Jesus he doesn't say Jesus
[1:09:46] isn't real it's a yo some other Jesus
[1:09:49] has he said that's right so now so he
[1:09:56] would say preacher doesn't God to her
[1:09:58] that would have no relationship with her
[1:10:02] he gave her 99 percent truth in one
[1:10:06] percent error he just changed the
[1:10:09] scripture just one little but that's all
[1:10:12] he did he didn't say God never told you
[1:10:14] that of God never you know Sidney he
[1:10:16] said yea hath God and it just twisted a
[1:10:17] little bit and then also he white washed
[1:10:22] the consequences of going against the
[1:10:25] word he just white washed it completely
[1:10:27] so he said you won't die you surely
[1:10:29] won't die because as soon as the sooner
[1:10:32] Satan's or as soon as the serpent saw
[1:10:34] because she said some and i'll just go
[1:10:41] back to it
[1:10:45] the woman said for God doth know that in
[1:10:50] the day eater of then there are also and
[1:10:53] the serpent said no oh yes verse 3 but
[1:10:58] the fruit of the tree which is the mr.
[1:11:00] garden God hath said ye shall not even
[1:11:02] need to touch at least you die so she
[1:11:04] actually believed this God that the
[1:11:07] server was preaching to her she doesn't
[1:11:11] say yeah the Lord God has see it knows
[1:11:12] it yes God this distant God now how does
[1:11:15] this apply to you the devil will come to
[1:11:18] you tell you one you don't know God he's
[1:11:21] not interested in you he doesn't love
[1:11:23] you he's not a present help in time of
[1:11:25] trouble to he'll twist the scripture to
[1:11:28] make you believe something that's not
[1:11:30] true and three he will reason with you
[1:11:34] in your mind does the scripture really
[1:11:37] mean this does it really matter and then
[1:11:41] for he'll whitewash the consequences of
[1:11:44] just neglecting the work right because
[1:11:47] when God said that they eat though the
[1:11:49] day you'll die God is a God of his word
[1:11:51] he's a man of his word he doesn't just
[1:11:53] say something and then and then actually
[1:11:56] just kind of cotton wool little bit
[1:11:58] later sake no I don't want to offend
[1:11:59] people I don't mean that he means
[1:12:01] exactly what he said so when he said
[1:12:03] that they eat the other day that day
[1:12:04] you're gonna die he meant exactly what
[1:12:06] he said but Satan will come way and say
[1:12:08] no God's a good God he wouldn't do that
[1:12:09] to you look you're the only true people
[1:12:11] upon the earth you'll has children right
[1:12:13] there's not many believers here I'll
[1:12:17] bring it into today there's not many
[1:12:18] believers who believe this he doesn't
[1:12:20] mean that a mint but God means what he
[1:12:23] says God means exactly so just so that
[1:12:26] they were just whitewash the
[1:12:27] consequences just totally whitewash the
[1:12:31] consequences of going is the word you
[1:12:34] won't die and then and that took her
[1:12:39] away from the word to following a lie so
[1:12:44] she believed what the serpent told him
[1:12:47] she had to believe it before the actor
[1:12:49] was done so the devil rewrote the Bible
[1:12:52] I just put it today's language he
[1:12:54] rewrote the Bible or he changed no
[1:12:57] doesn't really matter how you're
[1:12:58] baptized doesn't matter what you believe
[1:12:59] doesn't matter what you do or how you
[1:13:01] dress or why you believe in three gods
[1:13:04] you can just do whatever you want that's
[1:13:06] why said God is a good god is a god of
[1:13:08] love you know he's not really that
[1:13:10] serious about things that appear to be
[1:13:13] little but Moses said it Jesus in
[1:13:17] adventure live by every word that's
[1:13:19] right not most of the word not the word
[1:13:21] that just feels good not the word that
[1:13:23] just makes you happy but every word that
[1:13:26] proceeds out of the mouth of God that's
[1:13:28] right and this so this took her away
[1:13:33] from the word the following your life
[1:13:34] and it also took her from under the
[1:13:38] protection of the word and she fell
[1:13:41] because God this word is not just a
[1:13:44] weapon it's also our defense this is a
[1:13:49] this is a defense as well because if you
[1:13:52] know like like if the devil comes along
[1:13:55] and he says he says steal this kill this
[1:14:00] person I'm just using real obvious
[1:14:02] things you can bring it down to very
[1:14:04] subtle things and and you know the devil
[1:14:07] said just kill this person is rich take
[1:14:08] his money it doesn't matter you know if
[1:14:11] there's something in you wanting that
[1:14:13] and you don't actually stand behind the
[1:14:15] Word of God you know some people they
[1:14:18] just step over there conscious they go
[1:14:20] do those things but if but if you can
[1:14:23] actually combat that say no the word
[1:14:24] says thou shalt not kill manage means I
[1:14:26] shall not murder thou shalt not steal
[1:14:28] thou shalt not covet that's your defense
[1:14:31] against what he's trying to do to you
[1:14:36] now so that took her under the
[1:14:40] protection because she all she had to do
[1:14:42] was stay behind that word that God gave
[1:14:44] her and the devil the server would never
[1:14:46] have got him and it wouldn't be standing
[1:14:49] here tonight in this condition amen so
[1:14:56] this is hell so this is the devil's
[1:14:58] tactics
[1:15:06] I just read this and maybe I'll just
[1:15:10] close with these two no I'll just I just
[1:15:12] I just close with this one this one of a
[1:15:15] trumpet gives it uncertain sound yeah
[1:15:17] the devil can he'll come in and he'll
[1:15:20] say just do this this is not really that
[1:15:23] important you don't really need to read
[1:15:25] your ball we don't really need to pray
[1:15:27] the words on you you don't really need
[1:15:29] to pray get a better job some just a
[1:15:33] place you don't really need to come to
[1:15:34] church you know really neat others of
[1:15:36] the message yea hath God said you know
[1:15:39] and what you'll do he'll get people to
[1:15:42] leave an environment where they can be
[1:15:44] with fellow Christians like precious
[1:15:45] faith and when they can grow and their
[1:15:47] children who grow in an atmosphere the
[1:15:49] Holy Spirit and he can take those people
[1:15:52] out to chase a dollar somewhere or chase
[1:15:54] something else it's not even part of
[1:15:56] God's plan but then those people who
[1:16:00] stood behind the Word of God and see
[1:16:03] what the Bible says 24 signal the
[1:16:04] assembling of ourselves together
[1:16:06] sometimes people do have to move to
[1:16:07] church all these things but sometimes
[1:16:09] it's for the wrong thing because the
[1:16:13] reasoning you know the eight people love
[1:16:16] money people want to earn big money and
[1:16:20] they wanna they won't catch the Joneses
[1:16:22] and do all kinds of things those things
[1:16:25] you know imagine if I if I came to your
[1:16:28] house and I had a big bag on my back and
[1:16:31] I was really excited I said look what
[1:16:33] I've got look what up I look at this I
[1:16:34] made it up and open the bag and it's
[1:16:38] just a bunch of pavement but to me it's
[1:16:40] the most precious thing in all the world
[1:16:41] I've been working for years and finally
[1:16:44] I have my I have my bitumen I've got my
[1:16:48] concrete look at this concrete I've got
[1:16:49] you'd look at that say you fool yeah
[1:16:53] what do you mean this is this is
[1:16:55] invaluable I walk on it people drop gum
[1:16:57] on it you know people do all kinds of
[1:17:00] things on that stuff people just drive
[1:17:01] on it now it's like man who chases gold
[1:17:05] for the wrong reason that's pavement and
[1:17:09] heaven but people give their entire
[1:17:12] lives just for little blocks of it and
[1:17:14] they cherish it may take you out of
[1:17:16] there safely
[1:17:17] then look at it they put it back and
[1:17:19] they buy more and they chase just a bit
[1:17:21] of pavement if you think some will be
[1:17:25] foolish to come and show your big bag of
[1:17:26] pavement from just off the street here
[1:17:28] look what I've got multiply that by a
[1:17:31] billion and that's how foolish our
[1:17:33] people chasing money just money that's
[1:17:37] just pavement but if you're not careful
[1:17:41] the devil trying to eat you go in that
[1:17:43] direction or just chasing pleat hey this
[1:17:47] world is pleasure man yep just move to a
[1:17:50] nicer place you can live on the beach
[1:17:51] you could just have living a holiday
[1:17:54] atmosphere all the time everything's
[1:17:56] blase and you know all these things and
[1:17:59] the devil trying to get people to go in
[1:18:01] that direction yeah that's just but
[1:18:05] we're still Christians well you got to
[1:18:08] be careful because man can think well
[1:18:12] it'll go good if it's in the word it
[1:18:15] will go good but it was the devil
[1:18:17] leading someone down some part that will
[1:18:18] not remain good and spiritually they may
[1:18:23] prosper physically but spiritually where
[1:18:25] are they where they got and if we're not
[1:18:30] careful if we're not led by the word
[1:18:31] then people can have hate the devil can
[1:18:34] give your dreams he can give you visions
[1:18:36] he can excite you and certain things but
[1:18:39] I was not in the word and that will take
[1:18:41] you somewhere else you don't want to go
[1:18:43] now I'll just close with this doesn't
[1:18:46] the trumpet gives an uncertain sound but
[1:18:48] do you know what God don't have to
[1:18:50] improve he gave his children his
[1:18:52] soldiers the very best thing that he
[1:18:54] could give them when he gives them what
[1:18:56] did he give them he give them his word
[1:18:58] at the Garden of Eden and Men was to
[1:19:01] fortify himself behind the Word of God
[1:19:02] and no devil can can get him stay in the
[1:19:06] world now the enemy spies Satan tried to
[1:19:09] find out what he could do to break into
[1:19:11] that so he knew he could just come out
[1:19:14] of bluff her so the only thing he could
[1:19:17] do was to get here on reasoning and
[1:19:20] that's what God uses today and that's
[1:19:24] what God used to fortify his churches as
[1:19:27] word and Satan comes around with
[1:19:29] reasoning power
[1:19:31] who knows that that was the loophole
[1:19:33] that was the place that people could
[1:19:35] break the easiest was a reasoning
[1:19:38] incredible this is the easiest place man
[1:19:40] can break his reasoning and we think
[1:19:42] we're cultured and we think we're
[1:19:44] intelligent and we think we're the most
[1:19:45] educated people has ever been upon the
[1:19:48] earth and Satan and the easiest thing
[1:19:50] and we're if we have all this head stuff
[1:19:53] the devil can use that and just twisted
[1:19:56] in our reasoning it's not reasonable
[1:19:58] that you live this way anymore society's
[1:20:00] moved on you know just go with the times
[1:20:03] everybody else is happy why you go in
[1:20:05] this funny way you know reasoning would
[1:20:08] say well we are wear a hood you're a
[1:20:12] herd animal and just go with the pack
[1:20:14] that's how reasoning would say and if
[1:20:18] you follow reasoning you'll go the way
[1:20:19] the world and just be nice Christians
[1:20:22] and have nice Church and have nice just
[1:20:24] nice things we don't want just nice
[1:20:26] things we don't just want nice Church
[1:20:28] well living God among us amen that's
[1:20:31] what we want maybe another why shouldn't
[1:20:34] I stretch it on mice you know educated
[1:20:37] intellectual discourses of man and just
[1:20:39] all the stuff you want the Living God
[1:20:41] amen if you would yeah we don't have him
[1:20:44] we don't have anything right that's
[1:20:46] right so so Satan knew there was a
[1:20:48] loophole dells a reasoning well you say
[1:20:50] let me just reason with you is that
[1:20:52] necessary if God said it was necessary
[1:20:55] necessary whether we have to cry and
[1:20:57] boohoo and do all this if God said that
[1:20:59] the baptists of the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:01] necessary I don't care how how heavy it
[1:21:04] is how much of the world you have to
[1:21:06] give up you're going to have to use it
[1:21:08] one of these things to stay alive the
[1:21:11] only way of survival amen I'm just going
[1:21:17] to finish there but we have some we have
[1:21:22] some musicians to come wait for a bottle
[1:21:25] will be handed
[1:21:26] but you see you know I'm going to go
[1:21:29] into these things in a greater way but
[1:21:32] if we if we can see there you just see
[1:21:34] that short but in Genesis I trust it
[1:21:37] helps this is how the devil comes you
[1:21:42] know and the devil came against brother
[1:21:44] branham winners wife was dead and then
[1:21:46] the little baby was dying you know the
[1:21:49] devil didn't say to brother ground that
[1:21:51] God isn't real he said he doesn't care
[1:21:53] for you what does that mean he's distant
[1:21:56] and he begin to apply to his reasoning
[1:22:01] and he said what have you done but you
[1:22:04] know pray for people and preach and
[1:22:06] people will be healed all these things
[1:22:08] look what you've done and this is how he
[1:22:09] repays you remember I read that quote he
[1:22:12] says he says to have the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:15] the only way of survival now by the way
[1:22:18] I'm said in that dark a he said I was
[1:22:20] about to agree with him he said I was
[1:22:24] about to Griffin but if something came
[1:22:26] up with in him said the Lord giveth and
[1:22:27] Lord taketh away blessed be the name of
[1:22:29] the Lord if he doesn't have that on the
[1:22:31] inside of him and he would have failed
[1:22:33] and would have said you're right say
[1:22:36] that God is not a good guy he doesn't
[1:22:37] care about me this is all the sham
[1:22:40] because the devil is coming to his
[1:22:43] reasoning and his reasoning sounded
[1:22:45] right because if he work for a boss and
[1:22:47] the bosses meant to be good he should
[1:22:48] reward you accordingly and if he
[1:22:51] pretends to be a good boss just takes
[1:22:52] away the things you hold most valuable
[1:22:54] he's just lying to you he's just using
[1:22:56] you since I was about to growth and when
[1:23:00] something's hit the look of the Lord
[1:23:01] taketh away he said Sharon rose honey
[1:23:05] I'll go lay on the arms of mother an
[1:23:09] hour period I thing on top of each other
[1:23:11] two different caskets and he just walked
[1:23:14] on with God my if you don't have him
[1:23:17] that's right doesn't matter what age you
[1:23:19] don't have him we we we can't that's the
[1:23:22] only way of survival is it I want to
[1:23:25] survive I don't just want to survive on
[1:23:28] a walk out here rejoicing
[1:23:30] a man I think Alexander the Great was
[1:23:32] the best general there was no I our
[1:23:34] captain defeated everything in this
