[37:14] name of Jesus Christ and may he have
[37:16] free course in our lives oh God minister
[37:18] to our hearts changes mold us oh god
[37:20] father even the Lord our blind spots in
[37:23] our lives may he take those away as well
[37:25] oh God and Father we just want to commit
[37:27] Our Lives into your hands we thank you
[37:28] dear God that uh Lord those who are sick
[37:31] in body they can still be part of the
[37:32] service law because of the streaming so
[37:34] Lord I pray you'd be with them Lord may
[37:35] you touch my family and heal them Father
[37:37] the girls and Lord anyone else who's
[37:39] unwell today I pray you'd be their
[37:40] portion Lord thank you that by your
[37:42] stripes they they are healed Lord we
[37:44] want to thank you we can claim your
[37:46] bloodstains oh God for not just for

[37:49] and may there be healing of the spirit
[37:51] too oh God as well and may may be with
[37:54] everyone dear Lord we commit Our Lives
[37:56] into your hands in Jesus Christ's name
[37:58] amen amen God bless you friends you may
[38:00] have your seats this morning I want to
[38:02] talk about
[38:03] um you know Dave and um Ben visited me
[38:05] last night and they said so what are you
[38:07] what are you preaching on tomorrow is
[38:08] your pride so we're going to talk about
[38:10] Pride today
[38:11] you know it's amazing how you know we
[38:13] read a couple of very contrasting
[38:15] scriptures there it seemed to be that
[38:16] one is describing the uh the people in
[38:19] the end time and and it's very opposite
[38:22] to what the Lord is saying to say come
[38:24] unto me all ye that uh labored heavy
[38:26] laid and I'll give you a rest take my
[38:28] yoke upon you Lord of me from meek and
[38:30] meek and lowly in heart you shall find
[38:33] rest for your soul so you know there's
[38:35] there's there's one group because of the
[38:37] spirit of the world they are proud
[38:38] blasphemers despise those that are good
[38:40] we you know read the description and I
[38:42] pray we don't fall into that category at
[38:44] all because it says having a formal of
[38:45] godliness but denying the power thereof
[38:47] you know lovers of pleasure more than
[38:49] lovers of God so these people believe in
[38:51] something they have some kind of Faith
[38:52] or religion you can say they're
[38:54] Christian whatever more so we don't want
[38:56] to fall into that kind of bracket you
[38:57] know we want to we don't want Pride to
[39:00] govern Our Lives now
[39:02] um
[39:03] uh uh brother Bram sees this and and and
[39:05] it was so Blissful you know I just put
[39:07] this message on and uh this is from
[39:08] Christianity versus idolatry and and he
[39:12] says now he says now in studying in the
[39:14] early history of the church he said
[39:15] broadbeans and hazeltines and many of
[39:17] their comments on it and I see and
[39:19] fathers and yesterday I just wound up
[39:21] with the complete life of Saint Martin
[39:22] that the Catholic Church refused to
[39:24] canonize God did that
[39:26] um of his great life and how that the
[39:28] same signs and wonders followed that man
[39:30] right down through his life how he
[39:31] raised two people from the Dead cast out
[39:33] evil spirit spoken unknown tongues seen
[39:36] visions and things and what a great man
[39:37] but yet in the very secret of his power
[39:40] was in humility before God and we find
[39:43] today that the church yet teaching its
[39:46] power and teaching the signs to follow
[39:48] the believer we find them puffed out beg
[39:51] me little you and that uh and that isn't
[39:54] like the early church you see they were
[39:56] humble they were kind to one another
[39:58] sweet and understanding and it was so
[40:01] and it's so different today and I wonder
[40:03] if a lot of this hasn't sidetracked us
[40:06] from the real kernel of the message that
[40:09] we want to Humble ourselves keep keep
[40:11] yourself the more humbly you can be the
[40:14] greater God will use you amen so brother
[40:16] Bram saying you know he wasn't saying
[40:18] the message wasn't there he wasn't
[40:19] saying that they didn't have it but he's
[40:21] wondering if all these things hadn't
[40:23] sidetracked them from the real Colonel
[40:25] of it and the colonel is actually the
[40:27] seed part it's actually where you know
[40:29] the seed is the kernel and you know the
[40:32] colonel is the you know where the life
[40:34] is you know where where the DNA of the
[40:36] plant is where everything that will ever
[40:37] grow from that plant is in that DNA it's
[40:40] the Life part of it so you know you know
[40:43] it's like the kernel is the grain or the
[40:45] seed it produces the life it's got life
[40:47] within it it has the DNA in it which can
[40:50] produce so when he's saying that you
[40:52] know it hasn't sidetracked us from the
[40:54] real kernel of the message he's asking
[40:56] the question where is come let's just
[40:59] pray this morning shall we gracious
[41:01] father we just come before you this
[41:03] morning morning Lord see Sister Martin
[41:04] Lawrence just collapse there dear God I
[41:06] pray father you touch your body father I
[41:09] pray Lord whatever's going on there Lord
[41:10] I just pray father you restore her to
[41:12] perfect health oh God we commit her into
[41:14] your hands Lord we thank you for your
[41:15] healing touch Lord in Jesus Christ amen
[41:18] amen
[41:20] amen so we see so so he so he's asking
[41:22] the question have a lot of things not
[41:25] sidetracked us from the kernel of the
[41:26] message where where the life can be
[41:28] produced and that Colonel is having
[41:30] humility with God to being able to
[41:33] Humble ourselves to the word of God
[41:35] because Jesus said I am meek and lowly I
[41:37] am humble so you've got to be in the
[41:38] same humbleness as he is Amen to be
[41:41] joined with him see it's got to be you
[41:44] know see see we can know the message we
[41:46] can know the Bible from from cover to
[41:48] cover and the you know the concordances
[41:50] and everything and know the doctrine
[41:51] just right and the church children how
[41:53] is your dress and conduct ourselves but
[41:55] yet be sidetracked from the part that
[41:57] will produce the life that's in the word
[41:58] and we want the life and the word don't
[42:01] we how's everyone today everyone
[42:02] everyone's here hello good morning
[42:04] welcome Hey man so you know we want to
[42:06] see the life live not just be you know
[42:08] we know the message is not just the
[42:10] Bible's not just something to argue
[42:11] about it's it's it's it's that God would
[42:14] put on flesh in our lives right the word
[42:16] would become material in us so now
[42:19] so he's asking that question have you
[42:21] know have we really been sidetracked and
[42:23] and I pray to God we have not been
[42:25] sidetracked from the kernel of the
[42:27] message amen that we want to Humble
[42:29] ourselves and all the Lord Jesus will
[42:30] live through us that he will manifest
[42:32] his word through US amen because now
[42:36] but yeah I'll say this now just because
[42:39] you know Salvation
[42:42] if I put it this way just because you
[42:43] may not be yoked with the Lord that his
[42:46] power doesn't manifest through you
[42:47] doesn't mean that you're not saved right
[42:50] see there's salvation but then there's
[42:51] living a Victorious Life and if we want
[42:54] to live a Victorious Life we've got to
[42:56] stay yoked with the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:57] now if you have the baptism of the Holy
[42:59] Ghost you are yoked with him right you
[43:01] are yoga with them but you've got to
[43:02] surrender yourself to him lay aside
[43:04] everything that you can be yoked to him
[43:06] because when he talks about a yoke it's
[43:08] not like he just has a yoke and he puts
[43:09] it on your shoulders then walks off like
[43:11] it's some heavy thing that bears you
[43:13] down and now you've got to carry this
[43:14] heavy big weight and you know no no the
[43:17] yoke is like too oxen pulling together
[43:18] well he's actually saying join up with
[43:21] me
[43:22] connect with me amen that it's not just
[43:24] now you walking around with some
[43:26] Grievous weight on your shoulders no he
[43:27] says his burden is light his yoke is
[43:30] easy so so that yoki's talking about is
[43:33] actually when it's like two oxen that
[43:34] are that are pulling together now in
[43:37] that team of oxen one is always stronger
[43:39] than the other one's always the lead Ox
[43:40] right so he's got to be the lead Ox in
[43:43] your life well if you're yoked with him
[43:45] he's gonna be okay we're turning here
[43:46] now we're turning okay we're plowing
[43:48] here now we're plowing now we're going
[43:49] here okay okay we're going here Lord yo
[43:51] it's going to be that kind of a life
[43:52] Lord wherever you go I'll follow
[43:54] all right man because you're going right
[43:55] with me you're not going to leave me
[43:57] alone amen amen you're right with me so
[44:00] you know
[44:01] because it is possible now this may be
[44:03] dwelling on the negative a bit uh you
[44:04] know yo but it says in Ephesians 4 and
[44:07] 30 grieve not the holy spirit of God
[44:09] whereby you're sealed into the day of
[44:11] redemption so it's possible that we can
[44:13] grief his Spirit Away
[44:15] by our conduct things we say the things
[44:17] we do we get carnal and and that does
[44:19] not mean we become unsaved but what
[44:21] happens is that the Holy Ghost is
[44:23] because he's like a dove flies up into
[44:25] the rafters waiting for us to repent
[44:27] then he comes back again because our
[44:28] Nature's got to match his nature
[44:30] righteous like brother bran would say in
[44:32] the you know the message of church and
[44:34] its condition speaking of when the Lord
[44:35] Jesus was baptized and the spirit of God
[44:38] descended upon him like a dove and you
[44:40] know you know and he brings out so
[44:41] simply that the Lord Jesus had the same
[44:43] nature as a dove because like nature
[44:47] comes to like nature he says if if the
[44:49] Lord had a nature of a wolf then the
[44:51] spirit of God would never come and Abode
[44:52] upon him like that see it's the same
[44:54] thing with us we're going to have that
[44:56] lamb nature because allow your spirit a
[44:59] nature of a dove and a lamb are very
[45:00] similar very timid kind of creatures
[45:02] they're not mean and vicious and cruel
[45:04] they're not those kind of creatures
[45:05] they're meek and lowly and so if we want
[45:08] the Lord to abide in our lives we need
[45:10] his nature
[45:11] not the nature we're born with but his
[45:13] nature amen and so you know even like
[45:16] you know because we can grieve him you
[45:18] know so so that word grieve it means to
[45:21] passively to be sad we can make the Lord
[45:23] sad remember he's not an emotionless
[45:25] being he has emotion he has feeling
[45:28] right he's going to be rejoicing more
[45:30] than us I think when we get on the other
[45:32] side because now his he has his bride
[45:34] that he's loved the apple of his eye is
[45:36] now with him for eternity he's going to
[45:38] be rejoicing Hallelujah amen just like
[45:41] we're going to be rejoicing but I think
[45:43] he's going to be happier than us
[45:45] amen because what was in his mind is now
[45:47] made flesh in front of him praise the
[45:49] Lord the same thing when he looks at you
[45:50] even right now he he rejoices all Heaven
[45:52] rejoices when one one Soul comes to him
[45:55] that's not the angels and him just
[45:56] sitting there on the throne like this no
[45:57] no he's rejoicing more hey man why
[46:01] because in his mind he saw you redeemed
[46:03] he saw you give your life to him and he
[46:05] purchased your salvation on Calvary amen
[46:08] so when it actually becomes flesh it
[46:10] makes him Rejoice how much more when the
[46:12] Lord reveal something to you and then it
[46:13] happens you're rejoiced you're not amen
[46:17] Hallelujah so now so it's possible that
[46:19] we can grieve him away you know make him
[46:22] sad you know how about how would it be
[46:23] if if you could live so close you know
[46:26] look that that you do something wrong at
[46:28] the end of the day the Lord says you
[46:30] know that made me sad what you did today
[46:32] you say Lord I'm sorry
[46:34] because we know when we're in the flesh
[46:36] hey
[46:37] Reno when we've been carnal but then we
[46:39] also know when the Lord is Abiding and
[46:41] controlling Our Lives I trust you know
[46:43] the difference between those two things
[46:44] if you don't I say Lord
[46:47] just meet God and you'll really
[46:48] understand that
[46:49] I think it's not based on circumstance
[46:51] condition what everyone else is doing
[46:52] it's based on what the Lord has done in
[46:54] your life
[46:55] amen you can be in the middle of a storm
[46:57] upside down you can have the peace of
[46:59] God that rules
[47:00] in your heart amen so now when we come
[47:04] to that place you say Lord I'm sorry
[47:05] then that sweetness when he returns
[47:07] because you know
[47:10] we have two natures
[47:12] amen
[47:13] the the believer has two natures
[47:17] the Apostle Paul would would speak about
[47:19] the struggle through
[47:21] um um in detail in Romans 7 he'd say for
[47:24] I know that in me that that's a that's
[47:26] my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to
[47:28] will is present with me but how to
[47:30] perform that which is good I find not
[47:32] for the good that I would
[47:34] um for the good that I would I do not
[47:37] but the evil which I would not that I do
[47:40] now if I do that I would not it is no
[47:43] more that I do it but sin it dwelleth in
[47:45] me I find in a law then that when I do
[47:47] good evil is present with me for I
[47:50] Delight in the law of God after the
[47:51] inward man but I see another law in my
[47:53] members warring against the law of my
[47:55] mind bringing me into captivity of the
[47:57] law of sin which is in my members o
[47:59] Richard man that I am who shall deliver
[48:01] me from the body of this death I thank
[48:04] God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so
[48:06] then with the mind I myself serve the
[48:08] law of God but with the flesh the law of
[48:10] sin so he's saying this too
[48:13] there's two laws going on one in his
[48:15] mind which is the law of God and one is
[48:16] in his members
[48:18] and so he's saying that you know when I
[48:20] want to do good I don't you know I do
[48:22] evil or you know there's definitely you
[48:23] know there's this wrestle going on but
[48:25] now I'll say this if the spirit of God
[48:27] is within you that will bring your flesh
[48:29] subject but it depends who you yield to
[48:32] you can yield to your carnal nature see
[48:34] a Believer who doesn't know God doesn't
[48:36] have the law of Christ in his mind he
[48:38] doesn't have this balance right he just
[48:40] has the carnal nature with a religious
[48:42] covering right so so there's no
[48:44] overcoming power there but someone who
[48:46] really knows God there's those two
[48:48] forces of fighting and it's what we
[48:49] yield ourselves to is who will actually
[48:51] govern our lives right so I pray that we
[48:55] just yield ourselves to the Holy Ghost
[48:56] remember his yoke is easy as burden is
[48:58] light
[48:59] Hallelujah because we want him to live
[49:01] right we want him to have complete
[49:02] control
[49:04] over every emotion every thought
[49:06] everything we do we want the Lord the
[49:08] word to have his way Amen brother bam
[49:11] says about he says then Paul said them
[49:12] with my mind and I have the mind of
[49:14] Christ you see he said I serve God with
[49:16] my mind but my flesh how did he word
[49:19] that there at the last but with the
[49:20] flesh the law of sin what is it my flesh
[49:22] says tonight you're too tired your
[49:24] throat is too sore you've been out in
[49:26] the wind all day you shall not go to
[49:27] church tonight now that's the law of the
[49:28] flesh so he's not saying as in sin as an
[49:31] evil Deeds right he's just saying your
[49:33] body says I'm too tired I can't be
[49:34] bothered you know you know I think I've
[49:36] said before quoting Donnie Reagan you
[49:38] had to drag your body into a rapture
[49:40] you drag it to prayer you drag it to
[49:43] church you drag it into the Waters of
[49:44] baptism you drag it to the altar you
[49:47] make the Holy Ghost come and dwell in
[49:48] the soul and you'll eventually drag it
[49:50] to a body change and it will thank you
[49:51] one day it'll thank you amen have a good
[49:54] talk and say thank you drag me to church
[49:56] thank you drag me there I didn't want to
[49:58] I want to sleep in I didn't want to get
[50:00] up I didn't want to listen to that I
[50:01] didn't want to open my bible but thank
[50:03] you
[50:04] I appreciate that
[50:05] amen why because the natural man I mean
[50:09] who doesn't like a lion yeah let's be
[50:12] honest I do amen but there's something
[50:15] with us saying I want to gather I want
[50:16] to worship I want to praise God I want
[50:19] to serve him today I've got 24 hours I
[50:20] want to use it for him
[50:22] amen I want to I want to use it that he
[50:24] would be glorified he says you know you
[50:27] shall not go to church tonight that's
[50:28] the law of the flesh you might as well
[50:29] call them up and tell brother Neville's
[50:31] that send the questions down and tell
[50:33] them to answer them but you see I
[50:34] promise to do it see now at the mind on
[50:37] the inside the holy spirit said you keep
[50:38] your promise but the flesh said you're
[50:40] too tired see now the flesh say now
[50:42] there's no need
[50:43] now he's coming down to younger people
[50:45] yo you know the flesh is now there's no
[50:48] need you please you pretty little thing
[50:50] you're the prettiest little thing in
[50:51] school now don't you pay any attention
[50:53] to that Holy Roller mother of yours or
[50:55] that fanatic father see you're the best
[50:57] looking girl in school you're the
[50:58] prettiest boy the best looking boy the
[51:00] best built you're the most popular there
[51:02] there is in the city you see and you
[51:04] yield your members to that and where do
[51:06] you come out the little end of the horn
[51:08] every time so you'll come to an end
[51:10] where it's going to be disaster but Paul
[51:12] said my mind wants to I mean sorry Paul
[51:14] said My Flesh wants you wants to always
[51:16] yield to that your flesh does too see
[51:18] but the law of the spirit of God in the
[51:21] heart overcomes the Flesh and makes the
[51:23] body obey what the heart says do
[51:25] hallelujah amen so it's when the Holy
[51:28] Ghost takes control it'll make the body
[51:30] yield Hallelujah
[51:32] amen now
[51:35] the Lord says he's making making mild
[51:37] and humble that's our lord Jesus now he
[51:41] wasn't a push around we understand that
[51:42] being being humble and meek is not just
[51:44] anything can push you around Any Which
[51:45] Way but he was surrendered to the word
[51:48] of God for his life
[51:49] amen he was willing to submit himself to
[51:52] what God said he should do in this life
[51:55] amen that's that's real humility
[51:58] Amen to being humble does not mean
[52:00] you're pushed around or anyone can push
[52:02] you around no true humbleness is bound
[52:03] to submit yourself to the word of God
[52:05] that it or he is always right and we are
[52:09] wrong he's always right Jesus is always
[52:11] right always right all the time doesn't
[52:13] matter how much evidence you think you
[52:15] have on your side he's always right amen
[52:18] and I believe us recognizes the word is
[52:20] always right that's right Hallelujah
[52:22] amen if we realize he is always right
[52:25] then he can lead us and and if we
[52:27] realize he's always right then Pride
[52:29] can't have its way
[52:30] now we're going to get the pride too so
[52:32] so that yoke uh in the Greek it means to
[52:35] join a coupling you know actually and it
[52:38] means literally the beam of the balance
[52:40] connecting two scales who's seen an old
[52:41] set of scales yeah so so he's saying
[52:44] that that yolk is actually the bitter
[52:45] you know the beam that connects them
[52:47] and your brother um I mean I mean the
[52:49] Bible says a false balance is is I mean
[52:52] false scales is an Abomination to the
[52:54] Lord so without that yoke to bring a
[52:57] balance how can we even discern between
[52:59] good and evil how can we actually
[53:01] actually make right judgment calls amen
[53:03] but if that balance is in our lives amen
[53:07] then then we can actually make true
[53:08] discernment
[53:10] we can give true judgment call right
[53:12] amen but but if it's not there then
[53:14] we'll just go by our feelings in our
[53:16] nature and you know whatever we want to
[53:18] agree with because of that it's our
[53:19] flesh guiding us but we don't want
[53:21] ourselves to guide us we want him to
[53:23] guide us amen says the beam of a balance
[53:25] is connecting scales of pair of balances
[53:27] which is a yoke so in the Lord so when
[53:30] the Lord is calling come unto me and
[53:32] take my yoke upon me he's not just
[53:34] calling that to that age he's speaking
[53:35] it to every age
[53:37] down Through the Ages and he's calling
[53:39] that today
[53:40] amen that that to to be coupled with him
[53:43] connected with him
[53:46] now the reason we talk about what is the
[53:48] kernel this is the kernel of the of the
[53:51] message is being living a humble life
[53:53] with God that he can live is because
[53:56] that's where the life can come forth
[53:58] because remember it says in James 4 and
[54:01] 6 but he giveth more grace wherefore he
[54:04] saith God resisteth the proud but giveth
[54:07] Grace unto the humble now that word
[54:09] Grace part of it means a Divine
[54:11] influence upon the heart and Its
[54:13] Reflection In The Life so he gives Grace
[54:15] the Divine influence Upon Our Hearts to
[54:18] manifest the word he gives that Grace
[54:20] into the humble but he actually resists
[54:22] the proud remember God is not a
[54:24] respecter of persons he does not give us
[54:26] free free passage just because we claim
[54:29] to be the elect he treats everyone the
[54:31] same
[54:32] righty treats everyone the same he's not
[54:34] a respecter of person so if pride comes
[54:36] in up in our hearts he actually comes an
[54:38] opposing Force against us
[54:40] I don't want to fight God
[54:43] you're always going to come up second
[54:44] best the devil's gonna realize one day
[54:47] he's going to come up sick and best and
[54:49] he's been defeated down Through the Ages
[54:51] no matter what he's tried to do but he
[54:52] just doesn't wise up why because of
[54:55] pride pride is blinding
[54:57] yeah the word proud or pride in the uh
[54:59] in the in the New Testament uh one of
[55:02] the definitions says it's like a smoke
[55:04] it's like something that shroud
[55:06] surrounds it blinds people can't see
[55:08] because of Pride now Pride started
[55:12] in the heart of Satan
[55:15] that's where it started let's just let's
[55:16] just go into that because you know we've
[55:18] got to realize that really in reality we
[55:20] should have no part of the devil
[55:22] no part of his attributes no part of his
[55:25] nature amen we should be totally by the
[55:27] blood of Jesus Christ free of him well
[55:29] he's on one side you're on the other
[55:31] side there's no meeting ground to
[55:33] actually have any kind of Fellowship any
[55:35] kind of discussion no we're opposing so
[55:38] all that he is I'm against and all that
[55:40] I am he's against and that's fine I
[55:42] don't mind I'm against him I'm not on
[55:44] his team I'm not carrying his water
[55:46] bottles I'm not doing anything for him
[55:48] I'm not on his team right I'm not being
[55:50] his yeah I'm not his cheerleader at all
[55:52] as well that's for sure
[55:55] amen we are totally against him so Pride
[55:58] started in the heart of Satan now if we
[56:00] go to Ezekiel 28 and 17 I just got this
[56:03] one one verse here but Ezekiel is
[56:05] actually by Vision exposing what was in
[56:07] the heart of the devil we're just going
[56:09] to take this one verse he says thine
[56:11] heart was lifted up because of thy
[56:12] Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[56:15] the reason of thy brightness I will cast
[56:17] It To The Ground I will lay thee before
[56:19] kings that they may behold thee so this
[56:24] so thy heart was lifted up that's
[56:26] actually that that's Pride
[56:28] coming in and the reason of his pride is
[56:31] begin to look at himself and look at the
[56:33] other angels and say I'm better than
[56:34] them all
[56:35] look how beautiful I am look how perfect
[56:37] I'm way better than these other guys
[56:38] here you know I'm like the top dog
[56:41] you know and God created him that that
[56:44] way
[56:44] and he wasn't with and but somehow he
[56:47] seemed to attribute his greatness with
[56:48] himself
[56:49] but his greatness was because of God
[56:51] made him thus and so a key denominator
[56:54] with pride is always points to self it
[56:57] manifests in different ways but it
[56:59] always points to self this is a key this
[57:01] is a key point and I hope we just okay
[57:03] you got to keep it in your heart you
[57:05] know when it comes to Pride it started
[57:07] in the heart of the heart of the devil
[57:08] because the devil said look how great I
[57:10] am and then because of sin that
[57:13] attribute has been injected into the
[57:14] human race and that's why you know we've
[57:16] got to realize it has no part in Us by
[57:18] the blood of Jesus Christ God can
[57:20] eradicate that thing and it stays dead
[57:22] and it's gone and there's no more Pride
[57:24] God kills Pride it's not just oh I've
[57:28] got to cope and you know you know you
[57:30] know get some coping mechanisms how to
[57:31] not appear proud no no no he just kills
[57:34] it
[57:34] right so so God kills Pride so because
[57:37] it's not meant to be part of us because
[57:39] it actually started in the heart of the
[57:41] devil
[57:42] amen so now Pride so so Pride so it was
[57:46] the pride because he started to think
[57:48] about how great he was Pride changed his
[57:50] thinking and he believed it was all
[57:52] about him it changed his whole thinking
[57:54] because there was a time because when he
[57:55] was created that Pride wasn't there
[57:58] but it seemed obviously that you know
[58:00] Angels had a kind of free moral agency
[58:01] they could think they could reason and
[58:03] then he began to reason with himself I'm
[58:05] better than this guy I'm better than
[58:07] this angel look how look how beautiful I
[58:09] am look in the mirror and maybe you know
[58:10] do some flexes and whatever more and
[58:12] look at all this and you know uh and
[58:15] then and then Pride came in because of
[58:17] who who he thought and he and he
[58:19] actually thought himself greater than he
[58:20] was
[58:22] and so Pride
[58:24] Pride this is from Mr Google said this
[58:26] pride is the mindset of self
[58:29] of being a master rather than a servant
[58:31] a focus on self and the service of self
[58:34] a pursuit of self-recognition and
[58:36] self-exaltation and a desire to control
[58:39] and use all things for self that's a
[58:42] that's a common denominator
[58:45] now
[58:46] Pride always causes trouble
[58:50] Pride it says in Proverbs
[58:53] Proverbs 13 and 10 only by Pride cometh
[58:56] contention but with the well-advised is
[58:59] wisdom
[59:00] so Pride come so my pride contention
[59:04] comes right with humility contention
[59:07] doesn't come with peace contention
[59:09] doesn't come with pride contention comes
[59:12] right
[59:13] humility doesn't bring a debate it
[59:16] doesn't bring Strife it doesn't bring
[59:18] problems but Pride brings contention
[59:20] quarrels debate and strife that's what
[59:23] Pride does it says in Proverbs 28 and 5
[59:26] he that is of a proud heart stirth up
[59:28] Strife but he that putteth is trust the
[59:31] Lord shall be made fat Hallelujah that's
[59:33] a spiritual fact that's right Hallelujah
[59:35] one day I'll have a quote you know I'll
[59:37] be this big and he pays a lot amen but
[59:39] but he's talking spiritually right just
[59:41] physically see although anyway we'll
[59:43] leave that one alone
[59:45] um
[59:46] praise a lot but heathens were proud hat
[59:48] stirs up Strife so if there's pride in
[59:49] someone Strife is stirred up they can't
[59:51] help it because it's part of their
[59:52] nature part of their fallen nature
[59:55] Proverbs 28 25 I remember if you want to
[59:57] write that down
[59:58] either there's a proud so so there's
[1:00:01] something within them they just stir up
[1:00:02] strife
[1:00:03] and now surface Strife in your life this
[1:00:05] was me I thought I was clever if there's
[1:00:07] Strife in your life it's probably not
[1:00:09] your wife it's probably Pride
[1:00:12] that one's free because because remember
[1:00:15] the common denominator in every
[1:00:17] situation in your life is you you are
[1:00:20] the common denominator you are the the
[1:00:22] one constant you're not even a variable
[1:00:24] you're the constant if you know about
[1:00:26] math equations you are the constant in
[1:00:28] the equation is U so if there's Strife
[1:00:30] around you trouble break your your
[1:00:32] separation of friendship family well oh
[1:00:35] I don't talk to this person because
[1:00:36] listen it's because of you
[1:00:39] you know so so this Strife is because of
[1:00:42] pride
[1:00:43] so we're going to be very just just do a
[1:00:46] self-examination do I actually bring do
[1:00:49] people like to be around me because of
[1:00:50] peace
[1:00:51] you know and actually leave my presence
[1:00:53] feeling better than when they came or do
[1:00:56] they actually don't really want to be
[1:00:57] around me because of you know
[1:00:59] strife
[1:01:01] because of the atmosphere that we carry
[1:01:03] what is that atmosphere is it atmosphere
[1:01:04] of the Holy Ghost which brings peace and
[1:01:06] actually refreshes them and you and you
[1:01:09] don't need to necessarily talk about the
[1:01:10] Lord you just have Fellowship just talk
[1:01:11] about anything but people walk away
[1:01:12] feeling oh so good to visit them I just
[1:01:14] enjoy spending time why because the Holy
[1:01:16] Ghost is there brother bam says it's
[1:01:18] those leaves green leaves of Fellowship
[1:01:20] that people come under rest under the
[1:01:22] shade tree and they just feel refreshed
[1:01:24] they go on so that's peace but Strife is
[1:01:26] not that kind of a way or Pride does not
[1:01:28] produce that kind of an atmosphere
[1:01:31] I mean because Pride doesn't like being
[1:01:34] told that they're wrong it doesn't like
[1:01:37] to speak about certain subjects
[1:01:39] especially when the conclusion or the
[1:01:41] thrust of the conversation is that they
[1:01:43] need to change their ways or consider
[1:01:45] others needs more than their own
[1:01:47] Pride doesn't like to talk about those
[1:01:49] kind of things now
[1:01:52] it says in First Peter 3 and 7 it says
[1:01:55] likewise your husbands dwell with them
[1:01:56] according to knowledge give honor unto
[1:01:59] the wife as unto the weaker vessel as
[1:02:01] being is together of the grace of life
[1:02:03] that your prayers be not hindered so
[1:02:06] it's actually speaking that the whole
[1:02:08] reason yo husbands prayers can be
[1:02:11] hindered is not because of their wife
[1:02:13] but because of them
[1:02:15] see Fallen man loves to blame one
[1:02:17] another what did Adam do he's fallen and
[1:02:20] you know God calls Herman even the
[1:02:22] serpent and God gets to the bottom of
[1:02:23] this thing he knows what's going on but
[1:02:25] he wants them to know he knows what's
[1:02:26] going on and then God says actually to
[1:02:29] to God says to no sorry Adam says to God
[1:02:32] the woman you gave me cause this whole
[1:02:34] trouble
[1:02:35] the woman you gave me so he didn't take
[1:02:37] responsibility he knew what he was doing
[1:02:39] he went with his eyes open Eve was
[1:02:41] deceived Adam was not
[1:02:44] but because he had such a love for his
[1:02:46] wife he opened with his eyes open
[1:02:48] allowed sin to come and take dominion
[1:02:49] over all of creation he allowed Sid to
[1:02:52] come in because he went with his eyes
[1:02:53] open but then when he fell he's saying
[1:02:55] no no it's not me it's these people it's
[1:02:57] actually God it's your fault because God
[1:02:58] the woman you gave me
[1:03:00] I was unhappy eyes alone but you're the
[1:03:03] one who brought this one and and she was
[1:03:04] part of him
[1:03:06] so we can never come to a place where we
[1:03:08] blame everyone else for our problems
[1:03:09] because the constant in the equation is
[1:03:12] you
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:15] yeah that's what I do because I don't
[1:03:16] want to do this
[1:03:18] what do you see but but honestly you
[1:03:20] know I'm preaching to myself I don't
[1:03:21] just want to get too heavy in this
[1:03:22] that's why I'm kind of bringing it kind
[1:03:23] of like this right there's a purpose but
[1:03:25] you see so you got to really think now
[1:03:27] so so we have to but Pride will never
[1:03:29] want to dwell with their wife according
[1:03:33] to knowledge
[1:03:34] now remember it says dwell with them
[1:03:36] according to knowledge so that so that
[1:03:38] means it's not just living in the same
[1:03:39] house having the last the same last name
[1:03:42] or whatever people do these days you
[1:03:44] know saying now we're husband and wife
[1:03:45] no you've got to dwell with them
[1:03:47] according to knowledge you've got to
[1:03:48] understand them but Pride will pride is
[1:03:51] in the man's heart he'll never want to
[1:03:52] come down and actually understand his
[1:03:54] wife
[1:03:55] if it if it means that he has to change
[1:03:57] according to bring a greater Unity
[1:03:59] because Pride puts a wall up
[1:04:02] pride is a defense but it's not the
[1:04:03] right defense the word of God is the
[1:04:06] right defense and if you're one there
[1:04:08] should be no wall anyway
[1:04:10] s right
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:13] so because Pride does not allow a
[1:04:15] complete connection or a complete
[1:04:17] Oneness
[1:04:18] talk about between husband and wife now
[1:04:20] or even between you and God because
[1:04:21] God's opposing you if you're proud now
[1:04:24] Strife comes because of carnality as
[1:04:26] well yeah the Apostle Paul would
[1:04:28] actually blast the Corinthian Church
[1:04:30] remember the Corinthian Church our
[1:04:31] spirit filled they had the gifts
[1:04:32] operating they had God in their midst
[1:04:34] they were saved they were Believers but
[1:04:36] they had come into a carnal mindset and
[1:04:38] he says and I Brethren could not speak
[1:04:40] unto you as spiritual but as under
[1:04:42] carnal even as unto the babes in Christ
[1:04:44] Jesus I can't even come speak to you
[1:04:46] spiritual things because of your
[1:04:47] carnality and what you're doing I I've
[1:04:49] got to come and speak to you as babies
[1:04:50] you should be up here adults mature
[1:04:53] stable in your walk but because you've
[1:04:54] actually surrendered you know actually
[1:04:56] become carnal because of fussing and
[1:04:58] stewing going on I've got to talk to you
[1:04:59] like babies we're gonna go back to the
[1:05:01] start basically you know you should be
[1:05:03] way up here but you're down here because
[1:05:04] of cardinality so being being a carnal
[1:05:07] Christian actually hinders your walk
[1:05:09] Pride will hinder everyone's walk right
[1:05:12] if if there's any Pride if there's any
[1:05:14] attribute of Satan in your life because
[1:05:15] the blood is not taking it out it will
[1:05:17] hinder your walk but God has had a
[1:05:19] cleanse us of all of his Works remember
[1:05:21] it wasn't meant to be ours in the
[1:05:23] beginning and it's not ours now
[1:05:25] Hallelujah so if you've got a proud
[1:05:27] Spirit that's actually not part of you
[1:05:29] you may think it's you but it's not you
[1:05:31] but if you can discern actually this is
[1:05:33] not me then you can get rid of it amen
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:37] amen he says I feed you with milk and
[1:05:39] not with meat for a for here and two
[1:05:41] you're not able to Bear it neither
[1:05:43] um neither yet now are you able
[1:05:46] for a year yet carnal for for whereas
[1:05:49] there is among you envying Strife
[1:05:51] divisions are you not carnal Walkers
[1:05:53] meant because there's all these troubles
[1:05:55] and carnal you know you know divisions
[1:05:57] and envy and stuff you're carnal your
[1:06:00] life is showing your kernel it even says
[1:06:02] in Proverbs or Psalms it says even a
[1:06:04] child is non-biased doings
[1:06:06] you know so our actions really show what
[1:06:08] we are to help us Lord Jesus to be
[1:06:10] yielded and humble and meek
[1:06:12] amen because carnal means to pertain to
[1:06:15] the flesh it means that you know by
[1:06:17] implication animal unregenerate carnal
[1:06:20] fleshly so it's actually walking
[1:06:22] according to this unregenerated flesh
[1:06:25] thank God we're gonna have a body change
[1:06:27] we need it
[1:06:28] Hallelujah I'm glad we're gonna be real
[1:06:30] happy when these bodies are changed amen
[1:06:32] with that with that's done away with but
[1:06:34] you see see so that's how you know we
[1:06:36] can't walk in that way
[1:06:38] because the devil may want us to have
[1:06:42] his pride but it doesn't belong to US
[1:06:44] unless we take ownership of it
[1:06:48] so man so remember just just coming back
[1:06:51] to my thought before Pride manifests
[1:06:52] itself in different ways but it's Common
[1:06:54] Thread is all about self
[1:06:56] right so so whether so so Pride must be
[1:07:00] the main so someone with pride must be
[1:07:02] the main focus whether it's through a
[1:07:04] pity party or wanting to be the main one
[1:07:07] Pride manifest in different ways now the
[1:07:10] Bible says that Mary Magdalene had um
[1:07:12] Seven Devils cast out of her by the Lord
[1:07:15] brother bran would say this
[1:07:19] he says he says everybody who's ever
[1:07:21] been free from the Devil by the power of
[1:07:23] Jesus Christ knows where they're
[1:07:25] standing no one can ever come and uh
[1:07:28] into his great divine presence ever be
[1:07:30] the same person anymore you're changed
[1:07:32] there's something happens to you oh you
[1:07:34] can stand off and and psychology and
[1:07:36] imagine this and accept that a certain
[1:07:37] thing in some theories or something like
[1:07:39] that but we don't believe in theology we
[1:07:41] believe in the power of the resurrection
[1:07:43] of Jesus Christ and when you come into
[1:07:46] His presence there is something that
[1:07:47] happens in your life that changes you
[1:07:49] and you're never the same anymore a man
[1:07:51] that's ever been in the presence of
[1:07:52] Christ so you're saying we don't believe
[1:07:54] in just changing our thinking changing
[1:07:56] our habits no it takes the resurrection
[1:07:58] power Jesus Christ to take us from
[1:08:00] sinner to Saint to transform our lives
[1:08:02] from Lost to found right to give us a
[1:08:04] new nature that's what we believe in no
[1:08:07] no he talks about Mary Magdalene so she
[1:08:09] had Seven Devils cast out of her and he
[1:08:11] says pride and envy that was two of them
[1:08:15] and she thought she was so pretty and
[1:08:17] there was no one like her what that's
[1:08:19] probably it's all about me look how
[1:08:20] great I am you know look how you know
[1:08:23] she was the end thing but when Jesus
[1:08:26] spoke and said be thou clean all that
[1:08:28] left her
[1:08:29] she become a new person she wasn't so
[1:08:32] pretty anymore in her own sight so she
[1:08:35] didn't think she was ugly but she didn't
[1:08:36] she didn't think above what she was
[1:08:38] because her main focus in life wasn't
[1:08:40] herself anymore it was him all right man
[1:08:43] but she wrapped herself in the robe of
[1:08:44] meekness and gentleness and followed the
[1:08:46] master she loved him I mean so that was
[1:08:49] the main focus in her life was him it
[1:08:51] wasn't herself because Pride went out
[1:08:52] every winner Hallelujah it should be the
[1:08:55] same thing with us when Pride leaves the
[1:08:57] main focus is not ourselves it's him
[1:08:59] I mean because ourselves are not the
[1:09:02] object of our love and affection he is
[1:09:05] amen
[1:09:07] amen now he would say and I stand at the
[1:09:10] door and knock because there's many
[1:09:11] things in the heart of man
[1:09:13] and there's many doors remember there's
[1:09:15] multiple Chambers in the heart just just
[1:09:17] physically I think there's four main
[1:09:18] Chambers I might be wrong but it's just
[1:09:20] there's another little Dory says called
[1:09:21] Pride he says oh what a horrible little
[1:09:23] black Devil's all pinned up in the heart
[1:09:25] of Pride thinking you're better than
[1:09:27] somebody else well I wouldn't see my
[1:09:28] children over there they don't dress
[1:09:30] right the people that goes there isn't
[1:09:31] in my class if the Lord Jesus in your
[1:09:34] heart we're all one class because of one
[1:09:36] Spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:09:38] Pride just feels a little it's a little
[1:09:40] complex you have
[1:09:42] so pride comes in because of complexes
[1:09:45] we'll come back to that soon but you see
[1:09:47] pride
[1:09:49] Pride is very tired very closely to an
[1:09:51] arrogant spirit and it can't be
[1:09:53] corrected when someone tries to correct
[1:09:55] it it overreacts it's a manifestation of
[1:09:58] manifestation of Pride and overreaction
[1:10:00] as a manifestation of Pride now King
[1:10:03] Ahab was too proud to be humble to
[1:10:06] Humble himself to the word of the Lord
[1:10:08] he would go down and see Neighbors maybe
[1:10:10] you know I think he just looked out his
[1:10:11] window we won't read it but you know
[1:10:13] just to dramatize it to the First Kings
[1:10:14] 21 if you want to read it later you know
[1:10:16] he looks out his window and he sees
[1:10:18] naboth's Vineyard and it's right next to
[1:10:20] his house he says I want that Vineyard
[1:10:21] but he didn't want it for a Vineyard he
[1:10:23] wanted to turn it to a garden of herbs
[1:10:25] so you want and you know and he goes the
[1:10:27] neighbor this is his name off I want to
[1:10:29] buy your Vineyard or if you don't want
[1:10:31] to sell it I'll give you another one
[1:10:32] that's better
[1:10:33] but their neighbors would say to him no
[1:10:35] it's not right
[1:10:37] for me to sell the inheritance of my
[1:10:40] father so basically he quoted the
[1:10:41] scripture saying no no it's actually
[1:10:43] against the word to do what you want me
[1:10:45] to do and I'm not willing to go against
[1:10:47] the word and you know what he did
[1:10:49] Ahab was the king
[1:10:51] went to his house he was heavy and
[1:10:53] displeased
[1:10:55] he went and laid on his bed he turned
[1:10:57] his face to the wall and would eat no
[1:10:59] bread what did he do he threw a tantrum
[1:11:01] he overreacted by a simple person saying
[1:11:05] no he threw a tantrum
[1:11:08] you know he's the king you think here's
[1:11:10] the king he's not just some lonely guy
[1:11:12] who's living in some little Hut
[1:11:13] somewhere in Israel he's the king of
[1:11:15] Israel and one of the subjects says no
[1:11:17] the word says that's wrong I'm not going
[1:11:19] to do it and instead of saying I
[1:11:21] understand that's okay
[1:11:23] peace be unto you he goes into his
[1:11:25] Palace pulls up pulls himself against
[1:11:28] the wall and starts crying having a
[1:11:30] tantrum I'm not gonna eat I'm heavy it's
[1:11:33] all displeased you know read this to the
[1:11:36] girls the picture Bible say you know
[1:11:37] Jezebel comes along what's wrong honey
[1:11:39] you know and he'd say he won't sell his
[1:11:42] Vineyard to me
[1:11:44] you know throw the Tantrum
[1:11:47] yo well what's he doing it's Pride it's
[1:11:51] Pride manifesting because isn't it
[1:11:53] amazing you think so so Ahab this is not
[1:11:56] the first time someone's ever spoke the
[1:11:57] word a lot to him you know you think
[1:11:59] after Elijah comes into the throne room
[1:12:01] and says there's not going to be rain or
[1:12:03] due till I call for it and the place
[1:12:05] dries up and in that same Elijah system
[1:12:07] come up to Mount Carmel we're gonna have
[1:12:09] a showdown who's got and then that same
[1:12:11] Elijah calls fire down from heaven
[1:12:12] consumes consumes a sacrifice and that
[1:12:15] same Elijah says now get in your chariot
[1:12:17] because it's going to be rain you better
[1:12:18] get back to your house and that same
[1:12:20] Elijah now causes the rain to come and
[1:12:23] that same Elijah runs in front of his
[1:12:24] Chariot and beats him home you would
[1:12:27] think that he would actually humble
[1:12:28] himself to the word of God
[1:12:30] but he was too proud to do it and that's
[1:12:32] why when he came and tried to buy
[1:12:34] neighbor's Vineyard he threw a tantrum
[1:12:37] when naboth said no it's an overreaction
[1:12:42] when someone is correct that tried to be
[1:12:44] corrected and they're proud they
[1:12:45] overreact oh what's the use of it all
[1:12:48] then throw it all in all these things no
[1:12:49] that's an overreaction because of pride
[1:12:54] he was too proud he overreacted and it
[1:12:57] was a bit of an adult tantrum but that
[1:13:00] tantrum that Pride resulted in his own
[1:13:02] destruction
[1:13:04] because it because Jezebel took over
[1:13:06] wrote the letters to the elders had a
[1:13:08] had a trump charge pushed up against
[1:13:09] naboth he got killed and then Elijah
[1:13:12] came back said because naboth has killed
[1:13:14] the dogs in a lick your blood you're
[1:13:16] gonna die
[1:13:17] and so don't let Pride destroy you
[1:13:19] Pride destroyed him don't their pride
[1:13:21] destroy you
[1:13:22] amen that pride is because he wasn't
[1:13:24] willing to submit himself to the word of
[1:13:26] God rather expose it and let God destroy
[1:13:29] it
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:32] praise the Lord he says in demonology
[1:13:35] now now pride is also manifested in
[1:13:37] wanting to be a big shot wanting to be
[1:13:39] front and center
[1:13:41] he says here he says now no no so this
[1:13:44] is the message demonology a religious
[1:13:45] realm no matter how much teaching you've
[1:13:47] got how you can drum That Into You God
[1:13:50] is not in big words God is in an honest
[1:13:53] heart you might stand here speak big
[1:13:55] words like I don't know what but that
[1:13:57] doesn't bring you closer to God you can
[1:13:59] stand and practice how to repeat your
[1:14:01] sermon and say these things that don't
[1:14:03] get you closer to God you can learn all
[1:14:05] the dictionary until you sleep with one
[1:14:06] that still doesn't get you closer to God
[1:14:08] a humble submitted heart and the
[1:14:10] Simplicity is what brings you to God and
[1:14:13] that's true amen a humble heart God
[1:14:14] loves no matter if you don't know your
[1:14:17] ABCs that don't make any difference just
[1:14:19] a humble heart God dwells in a humble
[1:14:21] heart not an education not in schools
[1:14:24] not in theology seminaries not in all
[1:14:26] these other different places not in big
[1:14:27] words or In classical places God dwells
[1:14:30] in the human heart and the law we can
[1:14:33] break yourself down the more simple you
[1:14:36] can become greater in the sight of God
[1:14:38] he says let me give you something I can
[1:14:41] see your fields are full of wheat out
[1:14:42] here who's in a wheat field
[1:14:44] yep a full head of wheat always bows a
[1:14:48] little old sprig sticks up here and
[1:14:50] flopping around like it knows everything
[1:14:51] so he's talking about people now right
[1:14:53] it ain't got it but but one expects some
[1:14:55] others ain't got it in the head right or
[1:14:58] rather I mean it doesn't have it in the
[1:15:00] heart a holy head will bow to the power
[1:15:03] recognize Jesus Christ as the Son of God
[1:15:05] and believe his works so so Pride will
[1:15:08] manifest saying look at me here I am I'm
[1:15:11] front and Cedar this is all about me and
[1:15:13] if and if they're not put fun and sinner
[1:15:14] then their pride is hurt and they'll
[1:15:16] pull away
[1:15:18] but someone who is humble doesn't care
[1:15:20] if they're front and center are in the
[1:15:21] back right David said I'd rather be the
[1:15:23] dormant in the house of God I'd be
[1:15:25] satisfied with that I'd rather just be
[1:15:26] the doormat you know to be you know I'll
[1:15:28] be happy just to be that part of the
[1:15:30] building
[1:15:30] not front and center see humility
[1:15:32] doesn't care where they are in the body
[1:15:34] as long as they're in the body that's
[1:15:36] how I feel anyway
[1:15:37] I don't know why I'm standing here but
[1:15:39] you know
[1:15:40] I'm just happy to be saved I'm happy to
[1:15:42] be a Christian I'm real happy to no I've
[1:15:44] got eternal life that that satisfies me
[1:15:47] I mean hey man if this is the last time
[1:15:50] I ever preached praise God
[1:15:52] I'm not a Christian because I stand here
[1:15:53] no no that's for sure
[1:15:55] amen see so so someone who's flopping
[1:15:58] around like that thinking they know
[1:16:00] everything they ain't got it in the head
[1:16:01] make them bow
[1:16:03] amen what it's Pride manifesting
[1:16:07] see the Holy Ghost comes into you
[1:16:10] to take all the away from you see
[1:16:12] people say I can't give up this I can't
[1:16:13] do this I can't do that the Holy Ghost
[1:16:15] takes the cats away I can never overcome
[1:16:17] Pride the Holy Ghost takes that away I
[1:16:20] can never actually get rid of this
[1:16:21] bitterness and unforgiveness and trouble
[1:16:23] he takes it all away see right it makes
[1:16:25] women stop cutting their hair makes them
[1:16:27] quit wearing shorts and slacks no
[1:16:28] excuses makes them quit tattling oh yes
[1:16:30] that's what it's for to make you live a
[1:16:32] holy life it'll unfollow the
[1:16:33] instructions of the Bible every time a
[1:16:35] woman say it's just too hot I have to
[1:16:37] wear these and it gives me a headache to
[1:16:39] let my hair grow but there's no excuse
[1:16:40] with the Holy Ghost it's there to make
[1:16:42] it so it'll follow the word just exactly
[1:16:44] that's what the Holy Ghost just to do is
[1:16:46] to make your man make you man turn your
[1:16:48] head from these half-naked women and
[1:16:50] quit lusting after them and the church
[1:16:51] members and that's what it's to do it'll
[1:16:54] make you quit you you smoking and
[1:16:56] drinking and wanting to be a big shot it
[1:16:59] takes that out
[1:17:00] it'll take that out of you it'll humble
[1:17:02] you when you do that it's what the Holy
[1:17:05] Ghost is for it's for a holy life that's
[1:17:07] right makes you quit gossiping makes you
[1:17:09] quit playing cards shooting craps I have
[1:17:11] no idea what the Caps whatever those are
[1:17:13] and all those
[1:17:14] um all these other things that you do
[1:17:16] around the corner it'll it'll make you
[1:17:18] quit your carrying on the way you're
[1:17:20] doing living untrue to your wife that's
[1:17:22] what I'll do that's right it'll quit you
[1:17:23] wanting to marry someone else's wife
[1:17:25] that's exactly right why it takes all
[1:17:27] those things out
[1:17:28] Amy wanting to be the big shot the main
[1:17:30] one front and center that's Pride the
[1:17:32] Holy Ghost is here to take that out but
[1:17:34] see pride doesn't manifest just in that
[1:17:36] way of wanting to be the big front and
[1:17:38] center it also manifests in a pity party
[1:17:41] amen because
[1:17:44] see see people who get a complex that no
[1:17:46] one cares no one helps no one's worried
[1:17:48] about me that's actually Pride
[1:17:50] manifesting because it's all about them
[1:17:53] right because remember that's a common
[1:17:54] denominator self
[1:17:56] look at me see pride doesn't just enter
[1:17:58] into a person
[1:18:00] to think that they're there that they're
[1:18:02] great or you know to make them think
[1:18:04] that it's all about me
[1:18:06] all about this pain and hurt you know
[1:18:08] they weren't a nurses singing and they
[1:18:10] want everyone's attention to be upon
[1:18:12] them that's Pride so someone who has a
[1:18:14] pity party hey if we've got pain in our
[1:18:16] life you should tell someone about it
[1:18:18] pray about it and let's get it done
[1:18:19] right it's actually like here take this
[1:18:21] bomb I want it out of my life take this
[1:18:24] poison away that's what pain and hurt is
[1:18:26] it's not meant to be part of you no you
[1:18:28] don't need it don't carry it around just
[1:18:30] just get rid of it
[1:18:32] let the Lord take it from me but people
[1:18:34] will actually have the same pain and
[1:18:35] hurt but they want to hold on to it
[1:18:36] because it draws attention to them they
[1:18:38] think they're important because of it
[1:18:40] what is that Pride
[1:18:44] so we don't want to be those kind of
[1:18:45] people hey
[1:18:47] amen they see pride doesn't just enter
[1:18:50] into a person because they think they're
[1:18:52] great or better it can enter them by
[1:18:54] pain or trauma
[1:18:56] now brother Brian would would um this is
[1:18:59] an in in a prayer line he's speaking to
[1:19:01] a woman
[1:19:02] he says no
[1:19:04] this isn't a and if I told you I would
[1:19:07] know that it left you because right now
[1:19:10] you're standing and it's bothering you
[1:19:11] weary and the sun's looking gloomy and
[1:19:13] everything like that so this is this
[1:19:14] person's Outlook and everything seems
[1:19:16] like a phobia
[1:19:18] and you get scared at things and it
[1:19:21] isn't normal see it isn't right standing
[1:19:23] longer and longer you just uh we just
[1:19:25] make it it just keeps just you just keep
[1:19:28] thinking like that you're wanting to get
[1:19:30] well and I'm going to ask Jesus how now
[1:19:33] to heal you I believe he will don't you
[1:19:35] sister all right you come a little
[1:19:37] closer now you've had quite a struggle
[1:19:39] in life anyhow you know what I'm
[1:19:42] speaking of there I don't have to say it
[1:19:44] because this is uh live here you see but
[1:19:47] you know what I'm speaking of and he
[1:19:48] says our heavenly father so he prays for
[1:19:50] her by your spirit looking down through
[1:19:52] the stream of time oh you're here dear
[1:19:54] Jesus you're so lovely and kind and we
[1:19:56] love you with all your I mean with all
[1:19:59] of our heart and our sister standing
[1:20:01] here has been bound by an oppression of
[1:20:03] Satan foul Spirits have tried to put
[1:20:05] Pride upon her but Thou Art here to
[1:20:08] remove this curse of the enemy for he
[1:20:10] said the last words from a sacred lips
[1:20:12] as as you were leaving the world you
[1:20:14] said these signs shall follow them and
[1:20:16] my name there's your cast out Devils
[1:20:17] help me dear God this Jewel of Faith
[1:20:19] against the enemy so he's saying because
[1:20:22] she's had quite a struggle in life it's
[1:20:25] opened a door that the and she's Bound
[1:20:27] By An oppression of Satan and these foul
[1:20:29] Spurs have tried to put Pride upon her
[1:20:32] so it's not just thinking you're the big
[1:20:34] shot you're the great you're better than
[1:20:36] these people that brings Pride it can be
[1:20:37] trauma because remember pride is a
[1:20:40] defense
[1:20:41] so here she was had had quite a struggle
[1:20:44] in life and that opened a door
[1:20:47] for that demon of Pride to step in
[1:20:50] see that's why you've got to realize
[1:20:52] Pride manifests itself in many different
[1:20:54] ways
[1:20:55] but there's underlying causes
[1:20:58] so if we've had member if we've had
[1:21:01] quite a struggle in life those things
[1:21:03] are actually made to make us better
[1:21:05] not better but it depends what we yield
[1:21:07] ourselves to it can make you bitter or
[1:21:10] it can make you better it's your choice
[1:21:12] it depends what you want it to make you
[1:21:15] you know because
[1:21:17] everything in life if you let the Lord
[1:21:19] take it can be a power in his hands
[1:21:22] like in the Old Testament there were
[1:21:25] Cities of Refuge in the in the Land
[1:21:27] There were six Cities of Refuge where
[1:21:29] someone who who accidentally killed
[1:21:31] someone saying happened they could run
[1:21:32] into that City and be safe until the
[1:21:34] until the case was was was judged right
[1:21:38] now the seventh is always a mystery it's
[1:21:40] always actually Christ himself
[1:21:42] like you know Jesus was at the at the
[1:21:45] feast in Cana there the wedding feast
[1:21:47] and and there were six water pots
[1:21:49] brought before him he was the seventh he
[1:21:51] turned all them into wine
[1:21:53] right the woman at the well she had five
[1:21:55] husbands she was living with a man she
[1:21:57] wasn't married with so six men were in
[1:21:58] her life but Jesus was the seventh which
[1:22:01] actually undid the first six right she
[1:22:03] could actually instead of living under a
[1:22:04] complex of pain and hurt trying to find
[1:22:06] love in the wrong places she found real
[1:22:08] love
[1:22:08] I meant the seventh seal is a mystery
[1:22:10] but it's Christ himself becoming one
[1:22:12] with the bride right winding up the end
[1:22:14] time plan so the seventh is always a
[1:22:16] mystery amen but you see now just like
[1:22:18] Cities of Refuge in the Old Testament
[1:22:20] they a lot of them were actually
[1:22:23] Philistine cities
[1:22:24] garrisons are the enemy enemy City so
[1:22:27] they're in the promised land but the
[1:22:29] enemy was dwelling in there but then
[1:22:30] when Joshua and the Israelites came in
[1:22:32] they became Cities of Refuge like Ramos
[1:22:34] Gilly at different places you know they
[1:22:36] were they became a City of Refuge at one
[1:22:38] time they were enemy Garrison but when
[1:22:41] God came in it became a City of Refuge
[1:22:43] so now when pain and Trauma comes in it
[1:22:45] can become a stronghold of the devil in
[1:22:47] our lives epic can become a complex
[1:22:49] Pride can come in strife and envy
[1:22:52] whatever more can come in because of
[1:22:53] pain and hurt trauma produce just like
[1:22:56] natural trauma if I had a big bruise you
[1:22:58] know something hits me on the arm and it
[1:23:00] bruised forms so the bruises formed
[1:23:02] because of that blow right and it can
[1:23:03] affect my life it can stop me using my
[1:23:06] arm properly you know whatever more but
[1:23:07] when healing comes and it can take it
[1:23:09] away
[1:23:10] amen and then when someone else is at
[1:23:12] that same kind of injury I can really
[1:23:14] enter into their burden
[1:23:15] because I've experienced the same kind
[1:23:17] of pain right but then but then if I but
[1:23:20] then after after at least me and I still
[1:23:23] have a victim mentality it can still
[1:23:24] govern my life like it's still there
[1:23:26] we're not victims we're Overcomers
[1:23:29] right we are not victims we are
[1:23:31] Overcomers right because once someone's
[1:23:33] overcome something we are victorious
[1:23:35] over it and it doesn't rule us anymore
[1:23:37] we actually can use it as a token of
[1:23:40] God's grace to show someone else so it
[1:23:43] was an enemy Garrison but then it became
[1:23:45] a City of Refuge so pain can come into
[1:23:48] our lives and the devil can come and it
[1:23:49] can become a stronghold of the enemy
[1:23:51] like the woman of the well she came to
[1:23:53] the well at that time because she wasn't
[1:23:55] welcome with the other woman to get
[1:23:56] water she was ostracized from her
[1:23:59] Village even though she lived there she
[1:24:00] wasn't allowed to to partake of you know
[1:24:03] all the things they did she wasn't
[1:24:04] welcome so that was a that would be a
[1:24:06] lot of pain in her day
[1:24:08] and she was living with this thing and
[1:24:10] probably thinking well this is just how
[1:24:11] life is going to be and she got married
[1:24:13] all those times failed everyone and then
[1:24:15] decided what's the point of saying I do
[1:24:17] let's just I live together
[1:24:19] and you know she's living under this
[1:24:21] complex and hurt and pain and then out
[1:24:23] but there she is Jesus knew she'd have
[1:24:26] those things
[1:24:27] but then the Lord comes away
[1:24:29] she recognizes this is the Messiah her
[1:24:32] life was never the same so then now
[1:24:36] Church yeah after the upper room the
[1:24:38] Holy Ghost I believe she would have been
[1:24:39] one of those there or when Philip came
[1:24:42] and preached and Peter laid hands upon
[1:24:43] they received the Holy Ghost she was one
[1:24:44] of those numbers we're going to meet her
[1:24:46] one day we can actually find out what
[1:24:48] her name is oh you're the woman at the
[1:24:49] well praise God
[1:24:51] Hallelujah your testimony help me
[1:24:55] your testimony gave me strength your
[1:24:57] test row gave me overcoming but I could
[1:24:59] draw strength from your pain yeah yeah
[1:25:01] because the Lord turned it from pain
[1:25:03] into praise Hallelujah so there she was
[1:25:06] now after the upper room and now she's
[1:25:08] filled with the Holy Ghost sainted woman
[1:25:10] transformed life and then someone else
[1:25:12] comes into the church and they're a
[1:25:13] woman at the well too
[1:25:15] maybe they've only just been married
[1:25:16] once or twice whatever all but you're
[1:25:18] trying to look for love in the wrong
[1:25:19] places all this pain and hurt no one
[1:25:21] loves men feeling rejected not accepted
[1:25:23] all these things complex is carrying in
[1:25:25] and then and then and then then they
[1:25:27] walk into the church and they see her
[1:25:29] rejoicing see people rejoicing and the
[1:25:31] first thought the devil puts into
[1:25:32] people's minds is they these people will
[1:25:34] not understand me
[1:25:36] that will not be able to relate because
[1:25:38] they were never where I was and they
[1:25:39] don't know my struggles and just try us
[1:25:41] one time
[1:25:43] have like a set of speed dating speed
[1:25:46] testimonies
[1:25:47] and actually actually hear a bit of you
[1:25:49] know so what's your story what's your
[1:25:52] story what's your story and you may
[1:25:53] realize these people are just like me
[1:25:56] Hallelujah and that woman at the well I
[1:25:59] hope that wasn't a bad joke saying speed
[1:26:00] dating but you know but yeah but
[1:26:02] actually sit down and talk to people
[1:26:04] about where did they come from
[1:26:06] and no doubt the woman who's still the
[1:26:07] woman at the well speaks the one who was
[1:26:09] the woman of the well
[1:26:11] maybe first glance saying this woman
[1:26:13] won't understand me and then she sits
[1:26:15] down and says sister let me tell you
[1:26:17] something
[1:26:18] this was my life this is where I was
[1:26:20] stuck the hurt the trauma maybe for my
[1:26:22] childhood and this what happened and
[1:26:23] this is what led me to the first man it
[1:26:25] didn't work out I was hoping that you
[1:26:26] know and I thought surely the second one
[1:26:28] I'll find peace and love but it just
[1:26:29] broke apart again and you know the cycle
[1:26:31] of pain and grief and rejection and you
[1:26:33] know but then one day I went to the well
[1:26:35] and I was actually thinking yeah it was
[1:26:37] just another day it was just another
[1:26:39] church service I was just going through
[1:26:41] the motions but there was a man at the
[1:26:42] well
[1:26:43] and and we begin to talk and here's a
[1:26:46] Jew as a Samaritan you know we had no
[1:26:47] dealings but they were going to reveal
[1:26:49] my life and speak to me and show me all
[1:26:50] I ever did and I said we know we're
[1:26:52] Messiah cometh he'll do these things he
[1:26:54] just said I'm him I ran into the city I
[1:26:56] dropped my water pump my life has never
[1:26:58] been the same
[1:26:59] Hallelujah and she could say now I can
[1:27:01] pray for you
[1:27:03] because you can say Lord Jesus I've
[1:27:04] walked in these steps I know what it's
[1:27:06] like to be in these steps that she's in
[1:27:08] and really enter into her burden
[1:27:11] and she can get set free
[1:27:13] Hallelujah
[1:27:14] amen that's that's not just you know
[1:27:17] that's reality we actually enter into
[1:27:20] one another's burdens or people who come
[1:27:22] in because we say no we've been there
[1:27:25] praise the Lord so what does it turn
[1:27:26] into it was it was a Garrison of the
[1:27:29] enemy complex is paid and hurt because
[1:27:30] of trauma but then the Lord uses that
[1:27:33] same testimony so she can enter into
[1:27:35] someone's burden it becomes a City of
[1:27:36] Refuge
[1:27:38] where that person actually run into him
[1:27:39] be safe be delivered
[1:27:41] Hallelujah just like brother bam said
[1:27:43] when his little show and Roses baby was
[1:27:45] dying you know with um TB or whatever it
[1:27:47] was and you know her eyes were crossing
[1:27:49] because of the pain you know then she
[1:27:51] passed away she was you know buried
[1:27:52] there with her mother and you know he
[1:27:54] said that every child with cross eyes
[1:27:56] that walked you know came across the
[1:27:58] platform not one of them left with the
[1:28:00] cross eyes
[1:28:01] because that pain and great trauma that
[1:28:03] that that that the prophet you know
[1:28:05] suffered the Lord used that to deliver
[1:28:08] people
[1:28:10] so but Pride will say well poor me and
[1:28:13] why did this have to happen and why does
[1:28:14] this know but when it comes into when
[1:28:16] actually turns into a real testimony
[1:28:19] you're not feeling sorry for yourself
[1:28:20] you're just glad you're not there
[1:28:21] anymore
[1:28:22] and it's not something hidden because
[1:28:24] you're delivered
[1:28:25] right if you're still kind of battling
[1:28:28] with it you want to keep it hush-hushing
[1:28:29] away but if you're really free so how
[1:28:31] I'm free I was bound by this thing but
[1:28:33] now I'm not bound by this thing I know
[1:28:35] what it's like to be delivered I know
[1:28:36] what it's like to be free I know it's
[1:28:37] like for things to consume my mind and
[1:28:39] my affections everything but now I was
[1:28:41] like to be that or cat friend that I can
[1:28:43] walk free
[1:28:44] Hallelujah so she was bound up by
[1:28:48] trouble she had quite a struggle in her
[1:28:50] life and the foul Spirits had tried to
[1:28:52] put Pride upon her so we can't let Pride
[1:28:55] come in because of pain no we should let
[1:28:58] the Lord come in because of pain
[1:29:00] Hallelujah
[1:29:02] amen
[1:29:04] hallelujah amen now
[1:29:07] Pride makes the Lord unwelcome
[1:29:10] Pride makes Jesus unwelcome
[1:29:13] Simon the Pharisee was full of pride
[1:29:16] he invited Jesus to that feast
[1:29:18] to leave him in the corner with unwashed
[1:29:20] feet unwelcome
[1:29:22] and pride made him unwelcome
[1:29:24] we don't ever want to come to a place
[1:29:26] where the Lord is actually unwelcome in
[1:29:28] our presence we never want to get to
[1:29:30] that place because humility will say
[1:29:31] Lord oh the king of glory come in come
[1:29:34] and dwell with me Lord this is why I
[1:29:35] love your presence I love you being I
[1:29:37] feel so honored you're coming to my life
[1:29:39] you come into my house you'd visit me
[1:29:41] but Pride pushes them away
[1:29:44] so we don't ever want to let Pride I
[1:29:46] don't want to be Simon the Pharisee
[1:29:48] I want to be the woman with you know
[1:29:50] that washes his feet
[1:29:52] we're real hot felt worship and praise
[1:29:54] and thanksgiving pull my whole life out
[1:29:57] see I can see some people wrestling
[1:29:59] don't wrestle just just get rid of the
[1:30:01] pride don't look at yourself look at him
[1:30:04] because she walked out of that meeting
[1:30:07] Justified
[1:30:08] by sins be forgiven they go and sin no
[1:30:11] more you know she walked out free Simon
[1:30:13] the Pharisee with his pride was just
[1:30:14] condemned all the more
[1:30:18] I would walk out free
[1:30:20] Hallelujah if you want to be yogged up
[1:30:21] with the Lord you've got to say Lord I
[1:30:23] want to be humble I want to surrender
[1:30:25] myself to your word take all myself all
[1:30:27] my pride all that I am I want to Lad all
[1:30:30] aside and give you everything I want to
[1:30:31] give up my I want to give myself away
[1:30:34] Hallelujah this is such a joy we can be
[1:30:36] yoked with the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:30:39] that we can actually get to the kernel
[1:30:41] of the message
[1:30:42] the colonel of it where the life of God
[1:30:44] can be manifested through us the word
[1:30:46] actually puts on flesh it's not just
[1:30:48] quoting quotes and throwing scriptures
[1:30:50] around but the Lord himself dwells in US
[1:30:52] manifests his word why because of a life
[1:30:55] of humility
[1:30:56] Hallelujah
[1:30:58] amen so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
[1:31:00] finish with that maybe I've just given
[1:31:01] another introduction of an introduction
[1:31:03] but
[1:31:05] Pride manifests itself in various ways
[1:31:07] the common I'm just going to give a
[1:31:09] summary
[1:31:10] the common denominator is all about self
[1:31:13] it's all about self either I'm better
[1:31:15] than everyone else
[1:31:17] I'm glad I'm not that brother or that
[1:31:18] sister or that family oh I'm glad you
[1:31:20] know it's Pro we are never even people
[1:31:23] in the world never think you're better
[1:31:24] than them
[1:31:25] never ever think you're better than
[1:31:27] anyone it's God's grace that found you
[1:31:29] it's God's grace that called you it's
[1:31:31] God's grace that keeps you it's it's all
[1:31:33] the lord it's not it's not anything we
[1:31:35] do oh you know not one of us when we get
[1:31:37] on the other side say well I did this
[1:31:39] that will never be an out near our
[1:31:41] vocabulary near our thinking will be I
[1:31:43] did this well I got here no no he got
[1:31:45] you there amen he keeps you today he'll
[1:31:48] keep you until he takes you into Glory
[1:31:49] it's his doing right but Pride says look
[1:31:52] at me and this is what I know no no we
[1:31:54] just got to dump that all out and say
[1:31:55] Lord Jesus fill me with you and you do
[1:31:58] what you want to do
[1:31:59] Hallelujah
[1:32:01] amen
[1:32:02] see you're such a valuable lesson to me
[1:32:04] the first time before I went to Papua
[1:32:06] New Guinea to do Mission work I had such
[1:32:08] a burden to share this message with
[1:32:10] people who who barely speak English at
[1:32:12] best and I was trying to work out what
[1:32:13] am I going to do what am I going to take
[1:32:15] what do you know should I take this many
[1:32:17] bibles this many books and what you know
[1:32:18] what should I take but then the Lord
[1:32:20] came down such in such a powerful way
[1:32:22] put me on my knees the prince of God did
[1:32:24] in my room I couldn't even pray anything
[1:32:26] he said not by power or by might but by
[1:32:28] my spirit save the Lord he said you go
[1:32:30] and I'll do the rest and I went he
[1:32:32] brought the people he did everything I
[1:32:34] just was there just like a bystander
[1:32:36] watching the whole thing go take place
[1:32:37] and that's how we should be let God do
[1:32:40] everything
[1:32:40] Lord I mean just and and prayer say Lord
[1:32:43] what should I be doing because it's
[1:32:45] really it's not you telling God what to
[1:32:47] do in prayer it's prayer is actually
[1:32:49] prayer changes our minds in the
[1:32:52] situation it's not you trying to change
[1:32:53] God's mind to do what you want done it's
[1:32:55] Lord thy will be done
[1:32:57] on Earth as it is in heaven
[1:32:59] amen that's how it should be do but
[1:33:01] Pride will try and dictate to God what
[1:33:03] it once done
[1:33:05] lucky some errand boy God is not out
[1:33:07] here and boy God is not some little
[1:33:09] mascot that goes does our bidding like
[1:33:11] some little you know whatever no he's
[1:33:14] the king of glory we're here to do his
[1:33:16] bidding we're here to live a life that's
[1:33:18] pleasing to him amen so we want to be
[1:33:20] meek and lowly that's the colonel of the
[1:33:23] message
[1:33:24] to live a humble life that God can live
[1:33:26] through us but prior to his points to
[1:33:29] itself it's all about me whether I'm
[1:33:31] better than this person or because of a
[1:33:33] pity party feeling sorry for myself
[1:33:34] Spirit you know it's all about me so
[1:33:37] this person didn't do this this person
[1:33:39] oh no one visits me no one sees this no
[1:33:41] one no I'm not that they didn't shake my
[1:33:43] hand all these little things but you
[1:33:44] know to have friends you must first Show
[1:33:47] Yourself friendly
[1:33:48] it's a scriptural principle yeah it's a
[1:33:50] scripture if you want to be free have
[1:33:52] friends you got to be friendly
[1:33:53] you'll never see someone who's got a big
[1:33:55] circle of friends that's unfriendly
[1:33:58] right that'll be one way to make your
[1:34:00] circle of friends lower right so you
[1:34:03] know but if it's all about me then
[1:34:05] that's pride and remember Pride brings
[1:34:07] strife
[1:34:08] so if there's Strife in your life as I
[1:34:10] said it's probably not your wife it's
[1:34:13] you
[1:34:16] but you know Pride isn't willing to
[1:34:18] actually come to a point where it's
[1:34:19] actually I need changing
[1:34:21] pride is Wise It's the other person's
[1:34:23] fault we're to say Lord Jesus change me
[1:34:26] if I'm the common problem and if I'm
[1:34:28] butting heads it's my head that's
[1:34:30] budding
[1:34:30] right so change me Lord to stop this hey
[1:34:33] someone's got to break the cycle
[1:34:36] someone's got to break the cycle of
[1:34:37] fasting and fighting and stewing and it
[1:34:39] Mars up and say Lord start with me
[1:34:42] start with me you know what Insanity
[1:34:43] Einstein said Insanity was doing the
[1:34:46] same thing over and over again expecting
[1:34:48] a different result
[1:34:50] that's Insanity so if you keep butting
[1:34:52] heads there's strife and trouble and it
[1:34:54] just oh yo you do the same thing you
[1:34:55] wreck the same way no that's got to die
[1:34:57] you've actually got to give it to the
[1:34:59] Lord for the Lord to change you take it
[1:35:01] out of you that you can that that he
[1:35:02] breaks the cycle in your life
[1:35:05] I'm glad he's a cycle breaker
[1:35:07] Hallelujah I'm glad what I've said today
[1:35:10] is not us trying to do it now it's him
[1:35:12] but you want to give it to him give your
[1:35:14] pride give everything you are say Lord
[1:35:16] just do open heart surgery on Me Lord I
[1:35:20] don't want to fulfill the the conditions
[1:35:22] of the last day being heady high-minded
[1:35:24] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:35:25] glory god incontinent false accusers
[1:35:28] fears despise of those that are good
[1:35:29] traitors I don't want to be that kind of
[1:35:31] a person Lord I want to be meek lowly
[1:35:34] surrendered that you can have your way
