[4:09] [Music]
[4:18] [Music]
[7:55] you
[7:58] [Music]
[8:04] [Music]
[8:12] good morning how's everyone doing good
[8:18] hey good to see you and good to see you
[8:22] visit us here today it's good feels
[8:27] empty in the Sunday school children
[8:29] aren't in here remember that time we
[8:32] there were not many people in the church
[8:33] and I think the Sunday school was on and
[8:35] it was half empty and then we prayed and
[8:38] during the prayer everyone came in you
[8:39] know and we were saying Lord you know we
[8:41] there's only two or three you'll be here
[8:42] we open up our eyes and half the church
[8:44] was filled up it was quite an experience
[8:47] I think people turned up to during the
[8:49] prayer in it so but hey it doesn't
[8:51] matter it's always nice to have more
[8:53] people but the it is true that the main
[8:57] thing is that the Lord is here and then
[9:00] we can we meet the Lord you know that
[9:02] can be with one person or one hundred it
[9:04] doesn't really matter and it's at some
[9:07] I'm quite sure what's the Lord that it's
[9:09] quality not quantity he's not interested
[9:12] in just gathering as much as you can and
[9:14] just making a mess of the whole thing he
[9:16] does a good job at what he does and he
[9:17] works on individuals and he does a very
[9:19] good job on us and and we just want him
[9:24] to be here this morning we're looking
[9:26] forward to what he has in store for us
[9:27] we always receive a blessing when we
[9:31] meet in his name when he says I'll be
[9:33] here when you make my name or I'll be
[9:34] there in the midst we always receive a
[9:36] blessing so we run a great expectation
[9:38] that the Lord's going to continue to
[9:40] move in our midst and bless the ministry
[9:42] this morning and let's just stand and we
[9:47] will open up and prayer and we'll invite
[9:49] the Lord to be here and let him have his

[10:10] things during the week or natural things

[10:14] have lured that we can look to the
[10:16] eternal this morning law that you've

[30:33] testimonies on their heart they would
[30:35] like to share this morning I should have
[30:38] given you a pre warning but I didn't
[30:40] sorry to think of one we can hell out we
[30:44] can have one maybe two brother Adam and
[30:51] I thought you weren't going to be here
[30:52] this morning and I was really happy when
[30:54] I heard your voice at the back singing I
[31:01] never used to just go to the Lord and
[31:04] pray before I I'd do anything you know
[31:07] and in the last couple of days there was
[31:09] a lot of things that happen in my life
[31:10] choices are choices to be made them so
[31:13] width and I prayed and I just said Lord
[31:15] your will be done and not mine
[31:18] so whatever door should close let it
[31:20] close whatever door should open you open
[31:22] it because usually I wanted the door to
[31:25] open so badly that I'll make it open you
[31:27] know because you you you just make it
[31:30] happen and and so there was three I was
[31:33] looking for a new job and it was three
[31:36] opportunities that came up and I shot
[31:38] two the three opportunities and I asked
[31:39] the Lord to to guide me and all of a
[31:41] sudden I have the fourth one coming in
[31:43] as well and and I just didn't feel good
[31:45] with it and so I prayed I said Lord you
[31:47] know your will be done so if you want me
[31:49] to go into this field I'll go into that
[31:51] field if you want me to go to the other
[31:53] one or if you want me to stay I'll stay
[31:54] but you must close the doors now and
[31:56] then he just started closing the doors
[31:58] and it is the one job to say that it's
[32:00] fine and the other one was pushing hard
[32:02] but because I didn't feel comfortable
[32:04] with it I say close it came to a place
[32:07] where I had to choose between two jobs
[32:09] in one day and I said lord please help
[32:12] me now and I went and I prayed and I was
[32:14] walking in a field in Belmont Park I
[32:16] think a walk and I just prayed I said
[32:18] Lord really your will be done because
[32:19] now I'm confused what goes Bo's need to
[32:21] answer me today and I need to give them
[32:23] answer back as well and I walked and
[32:26] long story short I went back to the Lord
[32:28] and I prayed and I went in the car and I
[32:30] emailed both of them and and so the one
[32:33] said yep we all good we want you and the
[32:35] other one said no we're sweet and that's
[32:36] just how it worked out so the Lord ended
[32:39] their battles for me and Yahoo now whose
[32:42] wolf so it's wonderful which usually I
[32:44] would have just picked the one I like
[32:46] them so yeah he still gave me what my
[32:49] heart but was my heart's desire no and
[32:52] but I didn't force it but the choice
[32:53] wasn't mine
[32:54] so yeah praise the Lord thank you good

[45:32] so god bless real mothers amen god bless
[45:37] you all now let's so we've got a Hebrews
[45:39] 12 and 1 and then we're going to go to
[45:42] the book of Genesis and I want to
[45:44] continue on from from last week but in a
[45:48] different direction I am I had to stop
[45:50] my heart last week but I thought well I
[45:52] don't know how to put it all into one
[45:54] service so here we are
[45:56] so Hebrews 12 and 1 it says wherefore
[46:01] seeing we also are compassed about with
[46:04] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[46:07] aside every weight and the sin that does
[46:09] so easily beset us and let us run with
[46:12] patience the race that is set before us
[46:14] looking unto Jesus the author and
[46:16] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[46:18] that was set before him endured the
[46:20] cross despising the shame and a set down
[46:23] at the right hand of God and now let's
[46:26] go to Genesis chapter 45 and we're going
[46:29] to go into the life of Joseph I'm here
[46:32] it's going to take the scripture ducks
[46:35] familiar to to you all about the about
[46:39] when his brothers come before him so
[46:43] Genesis 45 and one this is where Joseph
[46:46] reveals himself to his brethren says
[46:49] then Joseph could not refrain himself
[46:52] before all of them that stood by him and
[46:55] he cried cause every man to go out from
[46:57] me and there stood no man with them
[46:59] while Joseph made himself known unto his
[47:01] brethren and he wept aloud and the
[47:03] Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard
[47:05] and Joseph said unto his brethren I am
[47:08] Joseph that's my brother father yet
[47:10] loved and his brethren cannot answer him
[47:12] for they were troubled at his presence
[47:14] and Joseph said unto his brethren come
[47:17] come near to me I pray you and they came
[47:20] near and he said I'm Joseph your brother
[47:22] whom you sold into Egypt
[47:23] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[47:25] with yourselves that you sold me hither
[47:27] for God had sent me before you to
[47:29] preserve life for these two years have
[47:32] the famine been in the land and yet
[47:33] there are five years in which there
[47:35] shall neither be earring nor harvest and
[47:38] God sent me before you to preserve you a
[47:41] prosperity in the earth and to save your
[47:44] lives by great deliverance and now it
[47:48] was not you that sent me hither but God
[47:50] and he has sent me hither and he hath
[47:54] made me a father to Pharaoh and Lord of
[47:56] all's house and a ruler throughout all
[47:59] the land of Egypt I met Lord blesses
[48:02] word you may have your seats now if I
[48:05] could take a title I want to I want to
[48:07] take a I'd like take Joseph so Joseph
[48:11] going from the favorite son to the right
[48:14] hand of Pharaoh now we read their last
[48:17] yah we your last Sunday we were talking
[48:20] about let us run and there's a race we
[48:22] must run and that race has been set up
[48:24] before us so the track that we're to run
[48:26] has been laid out before us
[48:28] and Paul's admonishing us let us run our
[48:30] race with patience and so now Joseph he
[48:34] had a race to run he did not know the
[48:38] path that was going to take him but he
[48:40] was so gripped by the two dreams he had
[48:43] about his family bowing down to him and
[48:44] be him becoming the head of the tribe
[48:46] that he that was he was fixated by that
[48:49] because God spoke to him in dreams this
[48:51] is what's going to happen but he didn't
[48:53] know how is going to end up that way
[48:54] right and so now it says and if we go to
[48:58] second Corinthians 13 because pulse is
[49:02] looking unto Jesus the author and
[49:04] finisher of our faith so he monitors us
[49:06] let us run but you got to look unto the
[49:09] Lord Jesus the word in order to run so
[49:13] you can't look at your circumstances or
[49:14] what you may be going in the
[49:16] here-and-now you look under him because
[49:18] if you look under him he gives you the
[49:20] strength to run and what you look unto
[49:22] is what you become right so singing
[49:25] proteins 3 and 13 it says now just just
[49:28] going halfway through what Paul is
[49:30] speaking about but he says now and not
[49:32] as Moses which put a veil over his face
[49:35] the children of Israel could not
[49:37] steadfastly look to the end that which
[49:40] is abolished but their minds were
[49:41] blinded for unto this day remain if the
[49:44] same vail untaken away in reading of the
[49:46] Old Testament which Vail has done away
[49:48] in Christ but even unto this day when
[49:51] Moses read the Vail is upon their heart
[49:53] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[49:55] Lord the veil shall be taken away now
[49:57] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[49:59] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[50:01] but we all with open face beholding as
[50:04] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[50:06] changed into the same image from glory
[50:08] to glory even as by the Spirit of Lord
[50:11] so Paula saying what you beholding we're
[50:13] beholding the you know the glory of the
[50:16] Lord and we have changed into that same
[50:19] image from glory to glory so there's a
[50:21] transformation as we walk with God he is
[50:23] changing us or transforming us from
[50:26] glory to glory until because one time we
[50:29] had a fallen we were made in the image
[50:30] of a fallen man but then God by his
[50:33] Spirit transforms us and he makes us
[50:35] into his image Alleluia and this word
[50:38] transformed is where we get the word
[50:39] metamorphosis from there
[50:42] the Greek word Metamorpho and we know a
[50:44] metamorphosis we think of a caterpillar
[50:46] becoming a butterfly it is a
[50:48] transformation it's the same life in the
[50:50] animal but it changes from one form to
[50:52] another form but also the minute the
[50:54] word metamorphosis from the British
[50:56] dictionary it's also a complete change
[50:59] of character or appearance so it's not
[51:01] just a physical way that something has
[51:03] changed its the character or the nature
[51:06] of the person amen so now they went God
[51:08] when you meet him
[51:10] he changes you from a fallen son of Adam
[51:13] and he changes it you are metamorph you
[51:15] are transformed amen you're not reformed
[51:18] or patched up you're transform that your
[51:20] nature and everything you are has
[51:21] changed Amen that we go from me you know
[51:24] let's just go there right now let's go
[51:26] to Genesis chapter one and three because
[51:29] Joseph now I'm just going to drop it in
[51:31] right now Joseph was the favorite son he
[51:34] would have been spoiled and we'll go I
[51:37] was going to be kind of giving an
[51:38] introduction and and and his family you
[51:41] know these family traits and his family
[51:44] there was a great thirst for revenge and
[51:46] we read about it where their only sister
[51:49] was was abused by someone in the land
[51:52] and how they got even as two other
[51:55] brothers wiped out every man in the city
[51:57] and took the woman and children captive
[52:00] that was them getting revenge that was
[52:02] in the family so that trait would have
[52:04] been in Joseph but God had to change him
[52:07] that when finally he had the ability to
[52:09] get the revenge on his brethren he
[52:11] didn't wipe them out anybody gave them
[52:13] life Aliyah is the same thing with you
[52:16] and I there's a position we're running
[52:18] to well then the position were it in but
[52:21] God has to change our character change
[52:23] our nature and order for us to really
[52:25] come into that position hallelujah
[52:27] that's why it's not just a mental assent
[52:29] of an idea God's got to take you you
[52:31] know when you really meet them you know
[52:33] you've met them because your life and
[52:35] nature's been changed amen it's not a
[52:37] hot surah maybe you know it's happened
[52:39] where once your brother Graham said he
[52:41] what you're those five young guys beat
[52:43] him up he's y'all get my gun I'll shoot
[52:45] them and he loaded his gun any fight he
[52:48] was it wouldn't go off they ran off he
[52:50] put it towards the tree and every all
[52:52] five shots went off that was unarmed he
[52:54] wanted to kill them he
[52:55] oh yeah a mint but then when he met God
[52:58] I look just like the guy who killed his
[53:01] favorite dog and enough and then he
[53:04] wanted to go kill that guy as well but
[53:06] his father stopped them but then after
[53:08] he met God he did that same one to
[53:09] Christ
[53:10] holy cause his character change Lord to
[53:14] God now let's go to Genesis let's read
[53:17] from Genesis 1 hey
[53:19] but now so this so we go so Joseph goes
[53:22] from spoil favorite son right hand of
[53:25] Pharaoh where where one place he would
[53:28] have wanted revenge and that but then he
[53:30] was transformed then he gave life and
[53:33] mercy but now Adam Adam takes the
[53:36] opposite step Adam goes from this is go
[53:39] to Genesis 1 and 26 and we know in
[53:43] Genesis 1 God makes man spirit man he's
[53:46] made in them as image God as a spirit
[53:48] and God said let us make man in our
[53:52] image after our likeness and let them
[53:54] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[53:57] and over the fowl of the air and over
[53:59] the cattle and over all the earth and of
[54:01] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[54:03] the earth so man created a God created
[54:06] man in his own image and the image of
[54:08] God created he him male and female
[54:10] created he them so he made man as spirit
[54:13] male female and spirit man one being and
[54:16] they had dominion over the earth rights
[54:20] and they were they lived out that
[54:21] dominion and then in Genesis chapter 2
[54:24] when let's go to let's go to verse 7
[54:29] this is in Genesis 2 when God he didn't
[54:32] create man he formed a body for man to
[54:34] go into and so in Genesis 2 and 7 and
[54:37] the Lord God formed man of the dust of
[54:39] the ground and breathed into his
[54:40] nostrils the breath of life and man
[54:42] became a living soul and we know after
[54:44] this God took the woman out of out of
[54:47] Adam and the Neels Adam and Eve right
[54:48] there but they were the same person
[54:50] masculine and feminine so Adam was made
[54:53] in the image of God so the character and
[54:56] nature of God was an atom member and and
[55:00] God was to be a redeemer and him was to
[55:03] be a guide and him was to be a have
[55:05] dominion you know all the attributes you
[55:07] see in christ yarn go
[55:09] you see you would have seen an atom
[55:10] because he has made in his image so when
[55:13] you saw how Adam conducted himself upon
[55:15] the earth that's how God would have been
[55:16] in flesh and has attitude towards
[55:18] anything would have been the same as
[55:19] God's attitude towards anything so they
[55:22] would have been exactly you know you
[55:23] would a you saw an image of God you
[55:26] would have seen it an atom and
[55:28] everything he did now so this is now so
[55:33] then the serpent comes along the devil
[55:36] uses the serpent as a vehicle to bring
[55:38] sin into the world now the scripture
[55:40] tells us that Adam was not deceived but
[55:44] the woman was deceived in the
[55:46] transgression so Eve was was tricked
[55:49] into it she didn't understand what was
[55:51] your the magnitude of what was going on
[55:53] but then when when Adam came along and
[55:56] saw his wife had fallen he's a son of
[55:59] God he must redeem he must try and you
[56:02] know take her and lift her back into the
[56:05] place years once and because it's in him
[56:06] he can't help but he's in the nature of
[56:08] God he's made in the image of God and so
[56:10] he quickly the prophecy as quickly takes
[56:13] her to himself amen and does the same
[56:15] act the serpent did with her puts his
[56:18] life into her because God Adam knows as
[56:20] a son I'm part of God God can't lose a
[56:24] part of himself I mean because I made it
[56:27] as image I'm not a separate year I'm
[56:28] part of him I'm in his family lineage
[56:30] partly so he can't lose me so therefore
[56:33] he jumps in the breech puts his life
[56:36] into her because Adam knows if his life
[56:39] is in her God can't destroy his life
[56:40] well there's the same thing with you God
[56:43] puts his life into you amen and then
[56:45] therefore the God cannot destroy you
[56:47] hallelujah so he acts as a redeemer
[56:51] Alleluia because the scripture says in
[56:53] 1st Corinthians 6 know ye not that your
[56:56] that your bodies are members of Christ
[56:58] shall I take the members of Christ and
[57:01] make them members of a harlot God for
[57:03] but what know you not that he that is
[57:07] joined to a harlot is one body for two
[57:09] saith he shall be one flesh
[57:12] he's tongue yo so Adam joined himself
[57:14] with his wife who was deceived into
[57:16] prostitution and to adultery but because
[57:20] he was his nature was to be a redeemer
[57:22] he
[57:22] quickly did it Amen because he was
[57:25] acting as Redeemers trying to stand
[57:27] between because he knew God he knew God
[57:29] would destroy her so he quickly stood in
[57:32] the priests to try and save her and he
[57:35] did it away but then in that fall Adam
[57:38] his nature changed when he fell right
[57:42] his nature changed because when we go to
[57:44] Genesis chapter three and eight notice
[57:49] notice Adams change of character Genesis
[57:55] 3 and eight so you know it says and they
[57:58] heard the voice of God walking in the
[58:00] garden in the cool of the day and Adam
[58:03] and his wife hid themselves from the
[58:04] presence of the Lord
[58:05] amongst the trees of the garden and the
[58:07] Lord God called unto Adam and said unto
[58:09] Him where art thou and he said I heard
[58:12] thy voice in the garden and I was afraid
[58:13] because I was naked and I had myself and
[58:16] he said who told thee that was naked
[58:19] has our eaten of the tree whereof I
[58:22] commanded thee not to eat and the man
[58:24] said the woman which thou gave us to be
[58:26] with me she gave me of the tree and I
[58:29] did eat so now what's happened he took
[58:33] before the fall he took responsibility
[58:35] I'm going to because it's in me to be a
[58:38] redeemer I'm going to try and redeem my
[58:40] wife I'm taking any because it says in
[58:42] the scripture by one man sin entered
[58:44] into the world shows Adam's choosing to
[58:47] follow the sly wife to let sin come into
[58:49] the world right but then now when God
[58:52] comes down to deal with what's just
[58:53] happened what does he do he he's
[58:56] basically blaming God for the reason
[59:00] he's in this situation this is the woman
[59:03] you gave me so basically he said he's
[59:05] saying I didn't ask for for Eve to come
[59:08] out of me I didn't ask to be put into a
[59:10] deep sleep I'm asked for this woman to
[59:12] come out of me this is not my fault this
[59:14] is your fault God amen he was actually
[59:17] blaming God the one who made him this is
[59:21] man and fallen state now he was blaming
[59:23] God for the predicament he found himself
[59:25] in hallelujah this is a man who has
[59:28] fallen he was blaming the one who made
[59:32] him it is your fault
[59:34] I remember man has free moral choice
[59:36] man has a choice but because he was in
[59:40] his fallen condition he would not take
[59:42] responsibility for his choice a meant he
[59:45] was saying that this whole predicament
[59:47] was because of God and God causes that's
[59:51] why people get angry at God how dare you
[59:53] God why should this happen to me but
[59:55] their choice and a lot of it causes them
[59:58] to go down that way a mint so yeah this
[1:00:02] this is characteristics of a fallen man
[1:00:04] they will always blame someone else for
[1:00:08] their predicament now there are some
[1:00:10] things in life such as a child has been
[1:00:13] abused they are always the victim they
[1:00:15] are never responsible right taking the
[1:00:18] extreme case but the one who does it to
[1:00:20] the child will blame the child yeah they
[1:00:23] will it's their fault they did whatever
[1:00:25] and they're innocent as can be
[1:00:27] they did they did way and it caused me
[1:00:29] to do it no they yielded themselves to a
[1:00:32] demon power and they gave their will to
[1:00:35] that demon power than they did the deed
[1:00:37] Amen but it's the same thing with us
[1:00:40] than anything else when we fall into sin
[1:00:43] we have to yield our will to because
[1:00:48] we're going to fall the nature will
[1:00:49] yield our will to that and then we'll go
[1:00:51] do whatever it is Amen because our our
[1:00:53] free moral choices governed by our
[1:00:56] nature right but then now people fall
[1:01:00] into all kinds of things and they say
[1:01:01] I'm the victim
[1:01:03] 99% of time no you chose to do it but if
[1:01:07] you never actually come to the
[1:01:09] acknowledgement I chose to do this
[1:01:11] sinful B then you'll never truly repent
[1:01:13] because you're just sitting back as the
[1:01:15] victim and if you just sit back at the
[1:01:18] victim you'll never be free I mean but
[1:01:21] if you take responsibility
[1:01:22] God can step on your behalf and because
[1:01:25] there's a land that's been slit as a
[1:01:27] blood that's been shed is a life that's
[1:01:29] been given to cleanse you of whatever
[1:01:31] course you need to go down that way amen
[1:01:33] because now well we have to understand
[1:01:36] certain points we are haunted by our
[1:01:39] past I mean it was not truly dealt with
[1:01:42] it haunts us Amen because the devil
[1:01:45] knows that there come this coming a time
[1:01:47] where destruction will come he knows
[1:01:49] there's a lake of fire
[1:01:50] with his name on it he's trying to drag
[1:01:52] everyone he can there as well amen
[1:01:54] so he knows there's a time of
[1:01:56] destruction but friends we're living in
[1:01:58] a very different hour because it is the
[1:02:01] same now I'm still talking about Joseph
[1:02:03] but you take the likes of Queen Esther
[1:02:06] Esther comes to her place it's the
[1:02:10] comforter positioners Queen and when she
[1:02:12] comes to her position as Queen and she
[1:02:14] goes before the king there comes a time
[1:02:17] where the rule records are opened
[1:02:19] because the king can't sleep the book
[1:02:21] becomes open now before the book comes
[1:02:23] open Haman has already signed into law
[1:02:26] by the Kings authority that is coming a
[1:02:29] day the 13th day of the 12th month or
[1:02:31] whatever it is that all the Jews will be
[1:02:33] destroyed and no doubt all the enemies
[1:02:36] of the Jews would have said have you
[1:02:38] read this have you read this I have
[1:02:41] legal right amen you're going to die and
[1:02:45] all your stuff is going to become mine
[1:02:48] amen and the Jews would have been
[1:02:50] haunted by this because he he would come
[1:02:53] here torment as their devils I'm going
[1:02:55] to get you it's a day closer it's
[1:02:58] another day closer your end is coming
[1:03:00] they will haunted amen but then when
[1:03:03] Esther came to a position the record the
[1:03:05] book became open Alleluia
[1:03:08] surely after she came before the king
[1:03:10] for mercy for her people the book came
[1:03:12] open right and then suddenly it changed
[1:03:16] from where where it was men doing the
[1:03:18] Jews were going to be destroyed on that
[1:03:20] day now the enemies of the Jews we're
[1:03:22] going to be destroyed on that day so
[1:03:24] it's the same thing today friends that
[1:03:27] God has appointed a day where it's not
[1:03:29] the enemy getting his revenge upon you
[1:03:32] but there is a feast of Purim hallelujah
[1:03:35] that you can rise up and destroy your
[1:03:38] enemy hallelujah and we are living
[1:03:40] versus the day amen where we are living
[1:03:43] in that day I'll loo you but well how do
[1:03:46] I destroy my enemy you got to bring it
[1:03:48] to God he's already been defeated on
[1:03:50] Calvary don't let him haunt you anymore
[1:03:53] hey the the orders been sent Holly the
[1:03:56] word has come through a prophet I mean
[1:03:59] that we're now living in a very
[1:04:00] different day
[1:04:01] or one day I can revenge myself no today
[1:04:04] we're living in a feast of Purim three
[1:04:07] hallelujah amen so you've got to but so
[1:04:11] don't hold on don't say I'm the victim
[1:04:13] get us actually my sinful nature made me
[1:04:15] do this
[1:04:16] amen and if you do that now God can you
[1:04:20] can truly repent and God can free of
[1:04:22] that haunting why be haunted by the
[1:04:24] devil we meant to haunt him I mean the
[1:04:26] tables have been turned
[1:04:28] Alleluia we are we are his you know we
[1:04:32] are his torment glory to God Alleluia so

[1:04:52] made the devil may have deceived you
[1:04:54] into it because that your this pleasure
[1:04:56] and sin for just a season right but you
[1:04:59] got to say ultimately Lord I agreed with
[1:05:00] him and I went down that way yeah
[1:05:03] Alleluia amen so rise up and kill your
[1:05:07] enemy now's the time hey man hey the
[1:05:11] stalemate the time of stalemate has come

[1:05:16] been given to the bride and we should
[1:05:18] not live below our privilege Amen at us
[1:05:21] remember you think about feast of Purim
[1:05:22] comes member it's in the Jews revenge we
[1:05:25] can oh we're going to eradicate them and
[1:05:27] they would have hunted down their enemy
[1:05:29] mm legal right and they would have
[1:05:31] butchered them whatever they did taking
[1:05:32] all their possessions they wouldn't have
[1:05:34] rested till the Sun went down on that
[1:05:35] day only had once one day to do it
[1:05:39] Olu you find your enemy amen

[1:05:49] Amen just do it where we're living in
[1:05:52] the hour it must be done now this is
[1:05:57] looking unto Jesus so I'm going to Paul
[1:06:00] says let us run with patience the race
[1:06:02] it before us now look under Jesus the
[1:06:05] author and finisher of our faith now to
[1:06:06] look unto is to consider attentively to
[1:06:09] stare at a meant to discern clearly and
[1:06:15] then and then and in the Hebrew meaning
[1:06:17] is to experience right so to look under

[1:06:35] him he will transform you from glory to
[1:06:37] glory amen remember Joseph had to run
[1:06:41] from favorite son to the right hand of
[1:06:44] Pharaoh right and it was his race his
[1:06:48] his race that that he was running made
[1:06:52] the transformation right so he had a lot
[1:06:55] of bad moments in his race but that was
[1:06:57] all God there was all the disappointment
[1:07:00] all the slavery all the false
[1:07:02] accusations all the imprisonment that
[1:07:05] was God he could say I'm being
[1:07:07] transformed hallelujah that was part of
[1:07:10] his transformation and so but he was so
[1:07:14] as us in the beginning he kept looking
[1:07:15] to those two dreams he believed that was
[1:07:17] going to happen he believed was going to
[1:07:20] happen now friends have you not been
[1:07:22] called have you not heard a prophetic
[1:07:24] message in this end time

[1:07:42] this life I mean in this life we're
[1:07:45] called to have a Dominion friend lujah
[1:07:48] and our Dominion is Christ's Dominion
[1:07:50] because we joint heirs with him so if
[1:07:52] that's the case there every part of our
[1:07:55] life is part of our transformation right

[1:08:12] all ooh yeah I have disappointments
[1:08:14] along the way hallelujah I think it's

[1:08:22] his hands maybe you're sinking surely
[1:08:24] now's the time
[1:08:25] right now now some because he was the
[1:08:28] captain of the guard now's the time and
[1:08:30] it all falls apart just like this I

[1:08:33] now nothing was going wrong nothing's
[1:08:35] going out of kilter it is God
[1:08:38] ordering your steps hallelujah
[1:08:41] but you got to keep looking unto Him now
[1:08:44] brother branham use this I mean brother
[1:08:48] Andy users quote on on Wednesday as
[1:08:50] brother Brown from being led of the Holy
[1:08:52] Spirit in 56 and he says the only thing
[1:08:55] I am is God's servant and by trying to
[1:08:58] keep try to bring you to Jesus Christ
[1:09:00] through a divine gift that was given to
[1:09:02] me then maybe then something can happen
[1:09:05] I trust it will will you believe you
[1:09:07] will so he's talking to a lady I believe
[1:09:10] you will too now the first thing the
[1:09:12] lady is suffering with a tremendous
[1:09:14] nervous condition she's just on the
[1:09:16] verge of a breakdown she feels like
[1:09:19] she's about to lose her mind the reason
[1:09:21] is because of a burden
[1:09:23] she's burdened about someone she has a
[1:09:26] burden on her heart who's got a burden
[1:09:28] this morning I mean and that person is
[1:09:30] her husband and the man has got
[1:09:32] something like a stroke or something
[1:09:34] that's bothered him and she's pulled
[1:09:36] around with him until it's caused her to
[1:09:39] have a breakdown that's the truth is
[1:09:40] that right if it has raised your hand
[1:09:43] you believe now all your heart
[1:09:44] look Satan is just you feel alright now
[1:09:47] see you feel better because as soon as
[1:09:49] you accepted it that feeling left you
[1:09:52] see it's gone now that's right you see
[1:09:54] you don't feel it now do you it's gone
[1:09:56] from you that's right
[1:09:58] raise up your hand if that's the if the
[1:10:00] weary feeling is left you see because
[1:10:03] I've seen it when it left see but that's
[1:10:05] just a shadow now it won't it can't hurt
[1:10:09] you it's the devil and he won't come to
[1:10:11] you no more
[1:10:12] you'll believe it you believe that
[1:10:15] you're standing by Jesus Christ now
[1:10:17] which is a supernatural being here
[1:10:20] that'll keep him away from you all the
[1:10:22] days of your life you're going out here
[1:10:25] happy and rejoicing and rejoice in the
[1:10:28] Lord you believe that then Heavenly
[1:10:29] Father I lay hands upon this little
[1:10:31] woman I say Satan you have lied to her
[1:10:33] and keep away from her in the name of
[1:10:36] Jesus Christ you're defeated and we
[1:10:38] adjure thee by the Living God to depart
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:41] now go rejoicing lady be happy just as
[1:10:44] happy as you can be singing hymns and
[1:10:46] praising God you'll be all right amen
[1:10:48] you believe it lady thank you Jesus head
[1:10:50] of dark hands belief Amen is that right
[1:10:52] now notice he didn't say anything about
[1:10:55] the condition of her husband nothing was
[1:10:58] changed in that department so her
[1:11:00] circumstances whatever what's your
[1:11:02] spacing before she came to the meeting
[1:11:04] and what you're facing when she left
[1:11:06] were exactly the same but her joy and
[1:11:10] her peace was restored amen so so the
[1:11:13] nervous condition was gone amen and she
[1:11:16] could go rejoicing in victory I mean
[1:11:20] because many times in life God doesn't
[1:11:22] change the situation sometimes he does
[1:11:24] but sometimes he doesn't but first he
[1:11:26] wants you to overcome the situation for
[1:11:29] it that your faith will not waver based
[1:11:31] on what's around you but you can be
[1:11:33] victorious however things are going on
[1:11:35] and then God can act on your behalf
[1:11:38] because character remember is not a gift
[1:11:41] every program says character is not a
[1:11:44] gift
[1:11:45] amen character is a victory you
[1:11:48] understand so it's a victory then there
[1:11:50] has to be a battle a man if there's a
[1:11:52] battle there has been opposition and if
[1:11:55] there is a battle against an opposition
[1:11:57] you have to beat it
[1:11:58] amen there has to be a struggle you
[1:12:01] understand so it's not just given to you
[1:12:03] or here you go yeah God doesn't just
[1:12:05] push a button there you go you're made
[1:12:07] in my image everything's fight you have
[1:12:09] to overcome
[1:12:10] I mean Joseph knew he was going to be it
[1:12:12] was going to be the head of the tribe
[1:12:14] but he needed the character for that
[1:12:15] position is the same thing with the
[1:12:18] Bride of Christ we know we're cool we
[1:12:20] know reelected and then we know we're
[1:12:22] made being made
[1:12:23] Jamie God has an image of us in heaven
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:28] and he sees what you're going to become
[1:12:29] and everyday you just walking through
[1:12:31] them and he's molding you transforming
[1:12:34] you you're growing from glory to glory
[1:12:36] he knows what your going to be a be in
[1:12:38] the end hallelujah but then that that
[1:12:41] character has to be molded and shaped
[1:12:43] into you earlier because it's a victory
[1:12:49] amen so now so she now had overcoming
[1:12:52] power over her situation and she can be
[1:12:55] happy she can be in the Lord in spite of
[1:12:58] what's going on and that to me is real
[1:13:02] overcoming faith I mean because of
[1:13:04] everything's going well it's very easy
[1:13:06] to say glory hallelujah I'm having a
[1:13:08] jubilee but it takes real character and
[1:13:10] faith that your world is falling apart
[1:13:12] and you still feel the same way
[1:13:14] hallelujah and that to me is a great
[1:13:17] victory Alleluia
[1:13:19] I mean brother BAM says in the message
[1:13:23] action having reaction to an action this
[1:13:26] is on the in the family altar we think
[1:13:29] we have it hard and sometimes Trials
[1:13:31] come I think of this woman in the
[1:13:34] wheelchair and these children where you
[1:13:37] out there with heart trouble maybe did
[1:13:39] in a week from now eat up with cancer
[1:13:41] it may look awful dark but if you'll
[1:13:43] just keep coming closer to God to find
[1:13:45] out his purpose it's the angels of God
[1:13:48] ready to rejoice for a victory that God
[1:13:51] wants to give sometimes it's in disguise
[1:13:53] Minh there as soon as perhaps sitting
[1:13:56] here and think what would I do if I die
[1:13:59] tonight what if this would be the last
[1:14:01] night I'm on the earth what then it may
[1:14:04] look dark may look like you're going to
[1:14:06] die maybe you're here to be playful for
[1:14:08] your sickness and you're still a sinner
[1:14:10] you get right with God first say why did
[1:14:13] I take this I've got children at home
[1:14:15] how do you know that might be angels
[1:14:19] wings beating together trying to get you
[1:14:21] close to God so you can be a real mother
[1:14:23] or dad to those kids it looks dark like
[1:14:26] it does to the little woman but if you
[1:14:28] just take God's promise now that
[1:14:30] whatever will let him come and drink
[1:14:33] from the waters of life the Fountains of
[1:14:35] life freely
[1:14:35] drink the water freely
[1:14:37] it's for whosoever will that might be
[1:14:40] that might have been put upon you you
[1:14:44] might have done that evil
[1:14:45] you may feel condemned into your heart
[1:14:47] you Christians now as I said a while ago
[1:14:49] because something iniquity lays in your
[1:14:51] heart maybe it happened for a purpose to
[1:14:54] get you closer to God right you look at
[1:14:57] why why is this happened right that
[1:15:00] happened to me my life has been
[1:15:02] different since I seen that I thought I
[1:15:05] was just living fine but I found out
[1:15:07] that let God raised his hand one time
[1:15:10] Satan's got me we're mortal and it's
[1:15:13] just and it's just a blessing in
[1:15:15] disguise mantilla preciate a more now to
[1:15:19] know that he's loving and willing to
[1:15:21] take us back so he's saying that all the
[1:15:24] hardship and things it's God's blessing
[1:15:26] in disguise meant because God is trying
[1:15:28] to gather you closer to himself
[1:15:30] hallelujah so you know one of my
[1:15:32] favorite quotes are brother Brown you
[1:15:34] just can't lose being a Christian
[1:15:36] Alleluia just can't lose every situation
[1:15:38] life is for your good amen he knows he
[1:15:41] knows we he wants to get you hallelujah
[1:15:44] and he will use whatever means a meant
[1:15:47] because he wants to get your attention
[1:15:48] because he has to get us out of these
[1:15:50] five senses of this world and live by
[1:15:53] sense of faith Amen sealer Joseph now
[1:15:57] Joseph could see he said yo-yo opening
[1:16:00] text he said it wasn't you that sent me
[1:16:01] down here is God I mean so he could look
[1:16:04] at the whole picture of the thing
[1:16:06] because now he was actually more
[1:16:07] spiritually minded it wasn't looking at
[1:16:10] the five senses and poor me I'm now
[1:16:11] slave and all this hardship no he knew
[1:16:13] God's God caused you to send me down
[1:16:16] here hallelujah
[1:16:18] as the same thing with David he's on the
[1:16:20] run from Epsilon you know and and shamea
[1:16:23] whatever his name is
[1:16:24] you know he's crippled up guys cursing
[1:16:26] him throwing mud and rocks at him and
[1:16:28] his bodyguards you know and what if
[1:16:29] David's bodyguard says you know will I
[1:16:31] let that head of that dog stay on him
[1:16:33] you know and David says no leave him
[1:16:35] alone God told him to do that
[1:16:37] you got to read it he says God told him
[1:16:39] to do that he could see the big picture
[1:16:41] because now here he comes in the great
[1:16:43] test how's it going to react to his
[1:16:45] enemy how is he going to react to his
[1:16:48] enemy
[1:16:49] right and so he could see beyond the big
[1:16:51] picture and we know what happens he
[1:16:53] comes back into power shemales at his
[1:16:55] feet cry for mercy Alleluia
[1:16:59] now let's go to let's go to Genesis 37
[1:17:03] and to it's just read a bit now Joseph
[1:17:11] his brothers hated him he say well why
[1:17:15] are you talking about Joseph Joseph the
[1:17:17] type of Christ absolutely but you got to
[1:17:19] see yourself and you got to see yourself
[1:17:20] and Joseph Amen cos he had to be
[1:17:23] prepared to be the right hand of Pharaoh
[1:17:24] and we we have you know we have to
[1:17:28] overcome there's a there's a throne or a
[1:17:30] Dominion for you
[1:17:31] amen to them that overcomes the promise
[1:17:34] of this ace them and overcome they'll
[1:17:36] sit with me and my throne as I've sat
[1:17:38] down with my father in his throne and
[1:17:40] means that throne is a Dominion so now
[1:17:42] there's a throne for us there's a
[1:17:44] position for the overcomer right and so
[1:17:48] we have to be prepared to go into that
[1:17:50] place you know many times we read John
[1:17:53] 14 I go to prepare a place for you Jesus
[1:17:55] speaking you know of I go to prepare a
[1:17:58] place for you and if I do I'll come
[1:17:59] again receive you to myself
[1:18:00] the place is prepared but the people
[1:18:03] have to be prepared for that place and
[1:18:04] that's what this life was about now he
[1:18:07] is preparing you amen to rule and reign
[1:18:09] with him Alleluia so that's what he's
[1:18:12] doing now Genesis 37 2 says these are
[1:18:15] the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17
[1:18:19] years old was feeding the flock with his
[1:18:20] brethren in the lad was with the sons of
[1:18:23] Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah has
[1:18:26] father's wives and Joseph brought unto
[1:18:29] his father their evil report now Israel
[1:18:32] loved Joseph more than all his children
[1:18:34] because he was the son of his old age
[1:18:36] and he made him a coat of many colours
[1:18:38] and when his brethren saw that their
[1:18:40] father loved him more than all of his
[1:18:42] brethren they hated him and could not
[1:18:44] speak peaceably unto him so he was the
[1:18:48] he was obviously the favorite son and
[1:18:50] they all they couldn't even speak
[1:18:51] because oh you know just everyday get
[1:18:53] out of the tent and breakfast why they
[1:18:55] do they couldn't even speak peaceably
[1:18:56] with him they hated them that much this
[1:18:58] is God's doing it wasn't them this is
[1:19:01] God made them angry God
[1:19:02] made God made his brothers hate him
[1:19:04] right this is God's doing and so he went
[1:19:08] from that now until finally he had to be
[1:19:13] transform laboring this bar I want you
[1:19:16] to see it he had to go through
[1:19:18] metamorphosis amen to be the right hand
[1:19:21] of Pharaoh now let's go to Genesis 34
[1:19:24] let's go back a bit because I want to
[1:19:26] show you the revenge like I mentioned it
[1:19:28] but this is a family trait and his
[1:19:31] family and we know family traits
[1:19:33] sometimes it's more extreme in other
[1:19:35] members than others but it's still there
[1:19:37] yeah right so we see here in Genesis 34
[1:19:42] this is when Joseph I think he wasn't he
[1:19:45] wasn't very old and we'll read from 34
[1:19:49] one down to seven and we're just going
[1:19:52] to go read the whole chapter he's going
[1:19:53] to skip through it because I just want
[1:19:55] you to see this and and Dino the
[1:19:57] daughter of Leah which she bare unto
[1:19:59] Jacob went out to see the daughters of
[1:20:01] the land and when she Shem the son of a
[1:20:04] ham or the high white prince of the
[1:20:05] country saw her and took her and lay
[1:20:07] with her and defiled her and his soul
[1:20:09] clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob
[1:20:11] and he loved the damsel and spake kindly
[1:20:13] unto the damsel and and she come i'm
[1:20:16] spake unto his father Hamor saying get
[1:20:19] me this damsel to wife and jacob heard
[1:20:21] that he defiled Dinah his daughter now
[1:20:23] his sons were with his cattle in the
[1:20:25] field and Jacob held his peace till they
[1:20:27] will come and home or the father of
[1:20:29] Shechem we now unto Jacob to commune
[1:20:32] with him and the sons of Jacob came out
[1:20:34] of the field when they heard it and the
[1:20:36] men were grieved and they were very
[1:20:37] wroth because he had wrought folly in
[1:20:40] Israel and lying with Jacobs daughter
[1:20:42] which thing ought not to be done now
[1:20:44] they had a right to be angry they had a
[1:20:47] right to be angry didn't they right they
[1:20:49] had a right but now let's see their
[1:20:52] revenge okay sister let's drop down to
[1:20:55] verse 13 and the sons of Jacob answered
[1:20:57] chicken and ham or has his father
[1:21:00] deceitfully and said because he had to
[1:21:02] file Dinah their sister and they said
[1:21:04] unto them we cannot do this thing which
[1:21:06] is giver in marriage to give our sister
[1:21:08] to one that is uncircumcised for that
[1:21:10] were for that were a reproach unto us
[1:21:13] but in this will we consent
[1:21:16] to you if ye will be as we that every
[1:21:19] male of you be circumcised then will we
[1:21:22] give our daughters unto you and we will
[1:21:24] take your daughters to us and we will
[1:21:26] dwell with you and we will become one
[1:21:28] people but if you not hearken unto us to
[1:21:30] be circumcised then we'll take our
[1:21:32] daughter and we will be gone and their
[1:21:33] words please harm or end and and she
[1:21:36] come a harmless son and the young man
[1:21:39] deferred not to do the thing because he
[1:21:41] had the light and Jacobs daughter and he
[1:21:43] was more honourable than all the house
[1:21:45] of his father so now he wants to know
[1:21:48] they all want to get religious to try
[1:21:49] and join up and make it right okay and
[1:21:51] then we go down to verse 24 and unto
[1:21:55] hammer and other Shechem his son
[1:21:56] hearkened all went out of the gate of
[1:21:58] his City and every male was circumcised
[1:22:01] all that went out of the gate of a city
[1:22:02] and it came to pass on the third day now
[1:22:05] this is them getting their revenge when
[1:22:07] they were saw that the two sons of Jacob
[1:22:09] Simon and Levi
[1:22:10] Dinah's brethren each men took his sword
[1:22:14] and came into this upon the city boldly
[1:22:16] and slew all the males and they slew
[1:22:19] hammer and chick him his son with the
[1:22:21] edge of the sword and took Dinah out of
[1:22:22] Chekhov's house and went out and the
[1:22:24] sons of Jacob came upon this land and
[1:22:26] spoiled the city because they had
[1:22:28] defiled their sister and they took their
[1:22:30] sheep and their ox and their asses and
[1:22:32] all that was in the city and that was in
[1:22:34] the field and all their wealth and all
[1:22:35] their little ones and all their wives
[1:22:37] took they captive and spoiled them even
[1:22:39] all that was in the house well that's
[1:22:43] revenge
[1:22:44] that's a revenge isn't it now it doesn't
[1:22:48] you know he should never have done that
[1:22:50] to it to their sister sure but this is
[1:22:52] them saying we're going to get revenge
[1:22:54] not just on him the whole city I don't
[1:22:57] know how many people was but they killed
[1:22:59] all the males and took everyone else
[1:23:01] captive took all their goods now we're
[1:23:03] square that's in the family that kinda
[1:23:07] revenge's in the family
[1:23:08] now God had to take Joseph because
[1:23:13] that's in him yep
[1:23:15] that's in him he had to take Joseph and
[1:23:18] he had to take that out of him
[1:23:21] right now if you just look at things
[1:23:24] naturally you will always want revenge
[1:23:27] right if Joseph said no you actually
[1:23:30] caused me to come down here now is my
[1:23:31] chance I'm going to deal with you they
[1:23:34] all would have been wiped out I believe
[1:23:36] that's just me but because he could see
[1:23:38] God in the whole thing
[1:23:40] and so this is God's doing amen and God
[1:23:44] changed him in such a way that now
[1:23:47] instead of them because they came to him
[1:23:48] there's a famine there's nothing growing
[1:23:50] they came to him for life
[1:23:52] yeah we need grain otherwise we'll die
[1:23:54] he knew who they were he knew exactly
[1:23:58] who they were they didn't know who he
[1:24:00] was
[1:24:00] they came to the one that they hated and
[1:24:03] desperation to receive life to receive
[1:24:06] food amen
[1:24:07] and he was changed in such a way that he
[1:24:09] gave it freely because remember he gave
[1:24:12] them the grain and put their gold on the
[1:24:14] top of the sacks
[1:24:14] he gave it without manual price Amen his
[1:24:18] character had been changed him he's a
[1:24:20] perfect type of Christ the Prophet tells
[1:24:21] us so he was he's the life giver now
[1:24:24] he's in place at the right hand of
[1:24:26] Pharaoh holy just like our Lord Jesus
[1:24:29] he's at the right hand of the Majesty on
[1:24:30] high and that's not a right hand as in
[1:24:33] God as a right hand it's a place of
[1:24:34] power and authority and position
[1:24:36] hallelujah so here he was and because he
[1:24:39] was placed in that way he could give
[1:24:41] life even to those who hated him
[1:24:44] couldn't even speak peaceably to him
[1:24:46] that's how much he was changed hello
[1:24:49] friends God works through his body hello
[1:24:53] God works the life comes through the
[1:24:56] body
[1:24:56] Amen just like in the book of Acts the
[1:24:58] angel goes to Cornelius said that you're
[1:25:02] your prayers and your arms have come up
[1:25:03] before God you know the angel didn't
[1:25:05] preach eternal life to Him he said go
[1:25:07] get Peter because the life comes through
[1:25:09] the body and so he goes gets Peter God's
[1:25:11] dealing with Peter Peter comes to the
[1:25:13] Gentiles he preaches and as yet Peter
[1:25:16] spake these words the Holy Ghost fell
[1:25:18] upon them they received life so it all
[1:25:21] works through the body of Christ life is
[1:25:24] given through the body amen but now if
[1:25:27] your character see there's the thing
[1:25:29] you're yet to have the right kind of
[1:25:31] character to give the life
[1:25:34] I meant to impart eternal life to others
[1:25:37] you got to have the character to do it
[1:25:38] you following me
[1:25:40] because Joseph if he had his first
[1:25:43] character he would just wiped out his
[1:25:44] brothers will throw them in prison
[1:25:46] whatever more make them pay I'll make
[1:25:48] you pay you'll be my slaves
[1:25:49] how long was I slaved you can have to
[1:25:51] live that out but his character has
[1:25:53] changed in such a way his life
[1:25:55] hallelujah he was changed
[1:25:58] amen his his character was no longer
[1:26:02] what he once was but he went through a
[1:26:04] metamorphosis amen - finally when he
[1:26:07] came into his position he could live it
[1:26:10] out hallelujah this was all done that
[1:26:13] life would be safe would be preserved
[1:26:16] amen now God has a power to transform
[1:26:21] right
[1:26:22] God has a power to transform the devil
[1:26:25] has the power to default okay and so now
[1:26:29] I'll just read this from God's power to
[1:26:31] transform now it had to be in that way
[1:26:33] because he made it that way and he made
[1:26:36] a channel that anything that stays in
[1:26:38] his channel and the line of his work it
[1:26:40] will bring forth exactly like His Word
[1:26:42] said it would do it could not move from
[1:26:45] there if it's channel just exactly right
[1:26:47] so with everything and the trust and his
[1:26:50] own son that it would be that way then
[1:26:53] God said it's all good so I'll just rest
[1:26:55] is speaking about Adam now and each one
[1:26:57] of those seeds had the power in itself
[1:26:58] to transform itself into the species
[1:27:01] that I desired to be that's what it must
[1:27:04] be because I've given every seed
[1:27:05] transforming power to make out of itself
[1:27:08] and it's potentials now to make out of
[1:27:10] itself exactly what I wanted to be God
[1:27:13] has never changed just the same today as
[1:27:15] he was then God has determined to do
[1:27:18] something he'll do it nothing's going to
[1:27:20] stop him he'll do it now after it's all
[1:27:23] so well and said in order God felt sure
[1:27:26] now that this would be all right and
[1:27:28] then when he did then came in the enemy
[1:27:31] I'm going to so God gave the power to
[1:27:34] transform I'm going to call this fellow
[1:27:37] with power not to create again he had
[1:27:40] power to deform Satan not transform but
[1:27:43] to deform now anything deformed is
[1:27:45] taking from its original state this
[1:27:47] something that's wrong with it they see
[1:27:50] it some years ago on patrol going up
[1:27:52] through the cornfields I would think
[1:27:54] over there was a limb that blowed off of
[1:27:56] a tree and it fell over on a stalk of
[1:27:58] corn and the stalk was trying its best
[1:28:01] to get up straight like it was supposed
[1:28:03] to be but it was deformed because that
[1:28:05] something had happened and the stick was
[1:28:07] laying over it then we find a wild
[1:28:09] creeper in the field which many of you
[1:28:11] men here maybe a woman from Kentucky the
[1:28:13] woman used the hoe they're like the same
[1:28:15] as the man get out in the field with a
[1:28:17] hoe they call the old gooseneck hoe chop
[1:28:19] the creepers out if you didn't get those
[1:28:21] creepers where the corn was in the row
[1:28:23] like this then that creeper would reach
[1:28:25] over grab a hold of that corn and wrap
[1:28:27] itself around it gradually so easy so
[1:28:29] slyly and you'd hardly tell what's
[1:28:31] wrapping it was wrapping finally get
[1:28:34] stronger and stronger and it pulls the
[1:28:36] corn till it's the form pulled itself
[1:28:38] against itself wraps it around its own
[1:28:40] vine deforming it from what it was to
[1:28:43] something else
[1:28:44] yet it's corn but it's deformed corn and
[1:28:46] we are still in the image of God but
[1:28:48] some are so deformed the sons of God
[1:28:51] that walk contrary to his word and to
[1:28:53] the way that he had us and provided us
[1:28:55] to walk sitting setting something the
[1:28:59] world twists us out of the way pulls us
[1:29:01] close to it and away from that straight
[1:29:03] narrow strip that he planted us in to be
[1:29:05] sons and daughters of God sin has done
[1:29:07] this evil thing to the sons and
[1:29:09] daughters of God the deformer I know
[1:29:11] this seems rather strange to speak on
[1:29:12] this 2d form but that's what he was he
[1:29:14] deformed or perverted pervert means to
[1:29:16] be changed over made something different
[1:29:18] and deformers the same thing that has
[1:29:21] that's been brought over and deformed
[1:29:24] and made another way yet is still the
[1:29:25] same seed but it's deformed now we find
[1:29:28] out this deformer has also had the same
[1:29:30] amount of time to deform as God had to
[1:29:33] transform amen he planted the seed or
[1:29:35] never planted in the gun he had 6,000
[1:29:38] years of deforming the seed of God the
[1:29:40] Word of God to deform it to make it
[1:29:42] something different the first time Eve
[1:29:44] listened to him and God herself just on
[1:29:47] one little phrase remember first Satan
[1:29:49] quoted the scripture just as clear as it
[1:29:50] can be God has said you shall not eat
[1:29:52] every tree of the garden see so Satan
[1:29:55] has had the power to deform right but
[1:29:58] God has the power to transform
[1:30:01] right and if he has it in you now if he
[1:30:05] has it in you you are the Bride of
[1:30:06] Christ not you will be but you are right
[1:30:10] as not if you will you know you may one
[1:30:13] day become you are right and David
[1:30:15] member ----n Joseph was to become the
[1:30:17] right hand of Pharaoh that was in him
[1:30:19] before his birth
[1:30:20] God saw him in that position right David
[1:30:23] and David it was a waste to be a king
[1:30:25] that's right
[1:30:26] David was yo so Samuel was told by God
[1:30:29] go to Jesse's house my king is in his
[1:30:31] house there's a little boy he's just
[1:30:34] shepherding sheep around this is a man
[1:30:36] made after you're after God's own heart
[1:30:39] yo God so thought highly this little
[1:30:42] shepherd boy I'm going to attribute me
[1:30:45] coming in the flesh after him as the son
[1:30:48] of David so here he was the potentials
[1:30:50] were in him if follow me everything to
[1:30:53] be King was in him everything that take
[1:30:55] full dominion of the land was in him
[1:30:56] remember when he came to the throne they
[1:30:58] subdued the whole land man I mean they
[1:31:00] took the whole possession when the king
[1:31:02] came to his throne so ennum was to be it
[1:31:04] but he needed the anointing from the
[1:31:06] Prophet right and then as they happen he
[1:31:09] went through a metamorphosis
[1:31:10] I mean from a shepherd boy to being on
[1:31:13] the throne of the you know house of
[1:31:15] Israel hallelujah but you see his
[1:31:18] metamorphosis just like Joseph he was on
[1:31:20] the run I mean here's a fugitive in his
[1:31:22] own land
[1:31:23] he had hardship Amen he was on the run
[1:31:26] from Saul it tried to kill him more than
[1:31:29] once you know his own son tried to throw
[1:31:32] him off the throne all kinds of enemies
[1:31:34] without and with him but what did he
[1:31:36] keeper for him remember we're two looked
[1:31:38] unto Jesus well he look unto anointed a
[1:31:42] vindicated prophet a proven prophet a
[1:31:44] word prophet took a horn of anointing
[1:31:47] oil poured the whole thing upon his head
[1:31:49] pulled out an anointing upon that sea
[1:31:51] hallelujah brought it to life it says
[1:31:53] from that day on the Spirit of God was
[1:31:55] with him and he kept that before him
[1:31:57] hallelujah God said I'm going to be
[1:32:00] Jehovah he said I'm going to be on the
[1:32:02] throne hallelu
[1:32:04] he looked unto that Amen he looked under
[1:32:07] that hallelujah it doesn't matter where
[1:32:09] he was on the run not on the run it's
[1:32:13] not the first time kids Christ I don't
[1:32:14] be
[1:32:15] prai's about it hallelujah everybody he
[1:32:18] looked under that me hello friends he
[1:32:21] didn't ever lead he didn't ever live 100
[1:32:23] tapes to listen to you never but well
[1:32:27] maybe had some Scrolls benighted me he
[1:32:28] doesn't have what we have but he kept
[1:32:31] himself in such a way god you're gonna
[1:32:33] make me king Amy you're going to make me
[1:32:35] king he didn't know how it's going to
[1:32:37] happen maybe he thought could member he
[1:32:39] was the right hand of Saul maybe thought
[1:32:41] in his mind just like Joseph now's the
[1:32:43] time he wasn't ready
[1:32:45] yeah but then him was to be king and him
[1:32:48] was to be king of ready hallelujah so he
[1:32:51] was so that anointing brought the sea to
[1:32:53] life
[1:32:54] and he looked unto the promise looking
[1:32:57] unto Jesus I mean I mean looking under
[1:32:59] the kingship and then one day he's on
[1:33:02] the throne the crown was on his head
[1:33:04] hallelujah because he delighted himself
[1:33:07] in the Lord he encouraged himself in the
[1:33:09] Lord he didn't look at a circumstance
[1:33:11] when the times got tough he looked at
[1:33:14] him Amen when the times he didn't look
[1:33:17] at his circumstance he looked at the
[1:33:18] Lord he following me so it's the same

[1:39:34] promise of God how much more now us
[1:39:37] we're summits vindication of God being
[1:39:40] real
[1:39:41] amen there's so much evidence of a land
[1:39:43] beyond the river I mean there's so much
[1:39:45] reality and we feel the Friends of God
[1:39:48] come down as word quicken to us why has
[1:39:50] it become a reality for the God saying
[1:39:52] there's a place I have prepared you a
[1:39:55] play parlor and I bring my spirit down
[1:39:57] to show to you you're going to that
[1:39:59] place
[1:40:00] Alleluia sought that is the case what do
[1:40:02] we got to worry about there's an eternal
[1:40:05] realm that's been made there's a place
[1:40:07] in that realm for us and he's calling
[1:40:10] you because he wants you to see that's
[1:40:12] you know we're not just to be this is
[1:40:15] not the end we don't just live
[1:40:18] threescore and ten and go and just
[1:40:20] disappear but we're being prepared for a
[1:40:23] place and if we are caught up and I've
[1:40:26] been I'm on my way we have some
[1:40:28] musicians to come if we are caught up
[1:40:31] I'm on my way to heavens fair land
[1:40:34] amen and he's calling me from that
[1:40:36] eternal place hallelujah what do we got
[1:40:40] to worry what if everything else you
[1:40:42] just not even be on our radar
[1:40:45] Alleluia well we've got burden
[1:40:47] struggles just to light yourself in him
[1:40:50] just encourage yourself at him and he
[1:40:53] will fight your battle how is this going
[1:40:55] to work out I don't know but I'd like
[1:40:57] myself a new Lord you will take care of
[1:40:59] me and you'll take care of that
[1:41:01] hallelujah if David could do this if
[1:41:03] David could encouraged himself in the
[1:41:05] Lord
[1:41:05] what would he would have said to him
[1:41:06] you've called me to become King you have
[1:41:10] delivered me from the mouth of a lion
[1:41:11] and a bear Goliath was in the same
[1:41:13] bracket
[1:41:14] I've been delivered from sword as armies
[1:41:16] amen you've kept me safe I went down to
[1:41:19] the Philistine lands and I was preserved
[1:41:22] Alleluia he could he could just allied
[1:41:24] himself God you brought me this way
[1:41:27] hallelujah
[1:41:28] and in as hard as Troy was on men wanted
[1:41:30] to start because they believed they
[1:41:32] believed he was coming into power but
[1:41:34] remember it wasn't the promise was to
[1:41:36] David it became personal to David they
[1:41:39] could see it in their lives because the
[1:41:41] anointing that came upon him came upon
[1:41:43] them when they take a spear kill 800
[1:41:45] minha wherever they did it wasn't
[1:41:46] Hollywood friends I mean they literally
[1:41:49] did it one man taking a sword killing a
[1:41:51] hobo because that anointing came upon
[1:41:53] them they knew he was coming into power
[1:41:55] right but their faith forget to waver
[1:41:57] because their circumstances so they
[1:42:00] needed someone in charge you could look
[1:42:01] beyond the circumstance I mean that's
[1:42:04] why we must always look at beyond
[1:42:05] whatever is happening in life and look
[1:42:08] upon the promise God has given you
[1:42:10] amen if he promise you that you'll rule
[1:42:12] and reign with him amen
[1:42:15] whatever that path is to you and your
[1:42:17] transformation just just running just
[1:42:20] enjoy every step of the journey earlier
[1:42:23] because God wants to show himself amen
[1:42:27] does David look at David zyg leg yeah he
[1:42:31] overcame to me that was one of the
[1:42:33] biggest challenges of us of his life
[1:42:35] they know Epsilon raises up now sure
[1:42:38] maybe he should have been a bit of dad
[1:42:40] and should have dealt with the son sure
[1:42:41] but he had confidence that if God placed
[1:42:45] him upon the throne then when God's
[1:42:48] timing was right God would tell him now
[1:42:49] you get off the throne amen
[1:42:52] so he had confidence Epsilon raise up he
[1:42:54] has to run for his life sure but he
[1:42:55] knows he's going to go back it's just me
[1:42:58] because he had have confidence
[1:43:01] delivered him there he's he'll deliver
[1:43:03] him here the circumstances may be
[1:43:06] slightly different but it's just still
[1:43:07] the same the same God and we have to
[1:43:10] have the same assurance you have the
[1:43:12] same assurance if God helped me here
[1:43:14] doesn't matter namely every aspect of
[1:43:17] your life
[1:43:17] Amen if God helped me in this place will
[1:43:20] he not help you in this place a man of
[1:43:22] God if God delivered me from this you'll
[1:43:24] doesn't live to deliver me from us isn't
[1:43:27] that right when he does you just have to
[1:43:30] rest keep your mind on him amen and
[1:43:34] you'll have perfect peace Alleluia amen
