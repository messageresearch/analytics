[31:47] oh my soul and I was wonderful Luke 17 I
[31:52] saw in Luke 10 verse 17 and the seventy
[31:56] returned again with joy saying Lord even
[32:00] the Devils are subject unto us through
[32:02] thy name and he said unto them I beheld
[32:06] Satan as lightning fall from heaven
[32:08] now here's them he is his day here's the
[32:12] punchline behold I give unto you power
[32:15] to tread on serpents listen carefully
[32:17] and scorpions and over some the power of
[32:22] the enemy does is that how it reads in
[32:25] your Bible not okay let's try that again
[32:26] and over mostly the power not almost
[32:30] just a tiny but 99% over all the power
[32:36] of the enemy and nothing shall by any
[32:39] means hurt you notwithstanding in this
[32:42] rejoice nots
[32:44] he warns us that the spirits are subject
[32:48] unto you but rather rejoice because your
[32:51] names are way written and I'll just if
[33:00] we can quickly go to proverbs proverbs
[33:02] 29 proverbs 29 verse verse 2 proverbs 29
[33:11] verse 2 here we go say many of you there
[33:15] are wonderful technicians at the back of
[33:19] quicker than you listening god bless
[33:24] them when the righteous are in authority
[33:28] so in the torah it actually reads when
[33:32] the righteous are in increase the people
[33:36] rejoice but when the wicked birth
[33:38] through the people mourn you may have
[33:42] your seats tonight god bless the reading
[33:44] of his word
[33:49] god is good all the time yeah so are we
[33:59] read this Matthew seven we thought okay
[34:05] so brother Caleb Matthew 7 verse 24
[34:11] therefore whosoever hear these things of
[34:14] mine and doeth them I will liken them
[34:16] and to a wise man which built his house
[34:18] upon a rock you're very familiar with
[34:20] this and the rain descended and the
[34:22] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[34:24] upon that house and fell not but it was
[34:27] founded upon a rock amen
[34:29] and everyone that hear these things of
[34:32] mine and doeth them not shall be likened
[34:33] unto a foolish man which built his house
[34:37] upon what I'm sand who's been at the
[34:42] ocean who's been on the beach I love the
[34:44] beach
[34:44] love the beach you stand still for the
[34:48] sport in stem quiet and the waves come
[34:50] and the waves come and just he was like
[34:53] oh you beat up going and then you
[34:55] started doing this whole balancing act
[34:57] how long can I stand still for and then
[34:59] eventually it'll just fall you know it's
[35:01] just shaky it's just a key there's
[35:02] nothing nothing solid below you and and
[35:08] great was the fall of the year or so and
[35:10] the floods came and the winds blew beat
[35:12] upon the house and it fell and great was
[35:14] the fall and it came to pass when Jesus
[35:17] had ended these sayings I was I love
[35:19] this but people were astonished at his
[35:22] doctrine or he taught them as one having
[35:25] Authority and not as the scribes oh my
[35:31] oh my and what authority does he come
[35:36] and what authority and that's my little
[35:39] theme for tonight I'm bringing you
[35:41] absolutely nothing new right I love to
[35:44] find little nuggets from preachers and
[35:47] from this this pulpit here bunch of them
[35:50] and a nugget that my book I don't know
[35:52] in the Kiwi language and nugget for me
[35:54] is solid gold right gold I wanted to go
[35:58] and look at what the gold price today
[36:00] for
[36:01] I don't know 900 bucks I don't know I
[36:03] don't know what it is significant right
[36:05] and that's what I see in a nugget I
[36:07] don't see in in car terms maybe you
[36:11] would know brother James and nugget is
[36:13] you don't want to buy a nugget nugget is
[36:17] like $300 Honda not Isaac but it's a
[36:23] Honda so you make it back say we've got
[36:25] all the faith but now we'll pray we pray
[36:28] till he gets here right Authority so my
[36:33] mind a little theme here is a receiving
[36:36] authority through revelation right and
[36:38] that's exactly how I received it so I'm
[36:41] exactly I'm preaching for me I'm not
[36:43] preaching for anyone else praise the
[36:46] Lord because he was just giving me all
[36:48] this nuggets and I'm just putting it
[36:49] together and a few sometimes like I'm
[36:51] putting you know pulling some of the
[36:53] strings and getting that foot Cindy and
[36:56] I mean during all this all the messages
[37:00] has come from this book but you know
[37:03] last Wednesday was was brother Ben and
[37:05] he preached of on spiritual authority
[37:08] now unlike brother Bing I take two
[37:12] months to prepare one message and he you
[37:14] know I can just pluck it out of the air
[37:15] and and he sees oh I think Brett's is a
[37:20] Christine you asked him what's the theme
[37:21] last last window and he goes our
[37:23] spiritual authority I said sorry what no
[37:31] I showed him on my phone you know I've
[37:35] been preparing for this so the Lord the
[37:38] Lord's funny the Lord you know no he's
[37:40] got a sense of humor bath
[37:42] he's got a message for you in this hour
[37:43] the time is short time is now so two
[37:49] ears one mouth listen twice all right
[37:52] to forgive me if you have heard some of
[37:54] this before the next thing you probably
[37:57] have heard the definition of authority
[37:59] power to influence in command thought
[38:01] opinion all behavior freedom granted by
[38:05] one in authority persons in command
[38:08] specifically government local authority
[38:12] local authorities when we talk about the
[38:14] but about the police you know the local
[38:17] authorities you know the government that
[38:18] the the regional councils or they
[38:21] empower that they the source from which
[38:24] the citation is drawn so he quoted
[38:27] extensively from the Bible his sole
[38:30] authority conclusive statement or set of
[38:33] statements a decision taken as a
[38:36] president and the last thing testimony
[38:40] there's a lot of Thor identities to me
[38:42] no one can change your DNA you don't
[38:45] change your and then I love authority
[38:50] and power slightly different things to
[38:53] different things Barrow is the force by
[38:55] which one you can oblige others or to
[38:59] obey you Authority is the right to
[39:01] direct and command to be listened to or
[39:05] obeyed others obey made by others
[39:09] Authority requests power power without
[39:13] Authority is tyranny I want to stop
[39:20] there quickly and brother basil was here
[39:22] with his testimony and I was streaming
[39:25] in I was richly blessed by that and he
[39:29] had his this them anyway we hit his
[39:32] little is there's this little child back
[39:34] in South Africa but there's big old
[39:36] youth and some of you were here with my
[39:42] very first message and you remember what
[39:44] was that title
[39:45] thanks mr. Brahn among cancer thanks
[39:47] kick on answer it was the miracle before
[39:50] the miracle okay and that jumped out to
[39:53] me that jumped out to me saying wait a
[39:56] minute the miracle is that boy nothing
[40:00] wrong with it okay
[40:01] praise the Lord but wait a minute step 1
[40:04] bang you find yourself and I'm trying to
[40:07] color this in as much as I can in a
[40:09] short time as I can you are in a third
[40:12] world you are surrounded by death around
[40:16] every corner
[40:17] they are merciless do anything wrong any
[40:23] any slight movement don't put in your
[40:25] indicator and go into their Lane
[40:27] it is it is tense it is real people want
[40:32] to fight people you know what I'm
[40:34] talking about
[40:35] there's America there's Africa there's
[40:38] this not only one country that that
[40:40] experiences this right so brother basil
[40:43] is on his knees day in the middle of
[40:45] nowhere was this like I didn't hear the
[40:48] the town was it okay so I thought was
[40:51] you know Joburg ish yeah I don't want to
[40:56] have you in that situation ever but try
[41:00] and picture this this is surrounded by
[41:02] hundreds of probably thousands of people
[41:04] this is this is stir something
[41:07] significant this happen out of the one
[41:10] of the people and one of them it's
[41:13] always us versus them as always it's
[41:16] never unity and he's there on his knees
[41:21] eyes closed
[41:22] amongst all this and he's praised his
[41:26] Lord I don't know I I don't know I can't
[41:31] he opens his eyes and these his brothers
[41:34] stop just thee sorry
[41:38] hello way how can this come about and
[41:43] this isn't what I want to tie in here
[41:45] they were holding back thousands of
[41:47] people I don't know how many brothers
[41:49] were there how many sisters they were
[41:51] holding back in authority they had power
[41:55] and authority and they were holding that
[41:58] back they were not forcing it maybe they
[42:00] were pushing right Jesus there was a
[42:03] multitude of people that was pushing in
[42:05] the crowds right and we'll get to that
[42:07] one story right now but there was
[42:10] Authority it was legions of angels okay
[42:13] like like that servant just Lord open
[42:17] his eyes somebody see it is it is
[42:21] significant to do to to see the whole
[42:26] picture yes the boy made it without a
[42:30] scratch
[42:31] hallelujah that's a healing God we're
[42:34] talking about but there was a trial he
[42:38] had to walk into that
[42:40] yes his faith was tested to the maximum
[42:43] for me it would have been my maximum I
[42:46] said lord I cannot do this I don't know
[42:48] what to do the fear that you would have
[42:51] in that situation but when he opened his
[42:53] eyes and saw brother Oh what what
[42:58] confidence what what peace and love he
[43:02] would have received that that's so I
[43:05] hope you catch that I hope and brother
[43:08] basil I hope I do their justice because
[43:10] it granted me I was in that situation
[43:13] it's easy for some of our brothers to
[43:15] step into that situation if you've been
[43:16] there and that was just significant so
[43:20] please linger on that thought and I
[43:24] think one of one of the things what and
[43:27] I don't know who said this is all old
[43:30] saying say you can say you can't either
[43:32] way you right I think he was on his
[43:35] knees then he was saying I can through
[43:38] Christ because I you have the authority
[43:42] it's promised to us you can't do this
[43:46] all by yourself
[43:48] if you identify that you are thee now I
[43:54] want to talk and this is actually where
[43:56] I grab my theme from is is the moon I've
[44:00] listened to some of the sermons of the
[44:03] brothers in in in the states around the
[44:06] the Ministry of the moon and the
[44:09] authority the moon holds over that
[44:12] holding back the waters okay I quickly
[44:15] pulled some some quotes and some some
[44:17] not quite it's just how the how the
[44:20] worlds you know in the website is called
[44:24] space calm easy to remember the moon is
[44:28] the easiest celestial object to find in
[44:31] the sky when it's the Earth's only
[44:35] natural satellite hovers above us right
[44:39] and round until it seemingly disappears
[44:43] for a few nights the rhythm of the
[44:46] moon's phases has guided humanity for
[44:48] millennia for instance calendar months
[44:52] are roughly equal to the time
[44:53] takes to go from one full moon to the
[44:56] next this is quite interesting moon
[44:59] phases and the moon's orbit are
[45:01] mysteries to many for example the moon
[45:04] always shows us the same face that
[45:08] happens because it takes to 27.3 days
[45:11] both to rotate on its axis and to orbit
[45:14] there's something significant that then
[45:16] does and that number and and I'll try
[45:19] and find that if you can please have the
[45:22] Liberty we see either the moon or full
[45:24] half moon or no moon or new moon because
[45:28] the moon reflects sunlight how much of
[45:32] it we see depends on the moon's position
[45:34] in relation to the earth and the Sun and
[45:38] I put in brackets s Oh amen the moon is
[45:43] a bit more than 1/4 so 1/4 the size of
[45:47] Earth a much smaller ratio than any
[45:50] other planets and the moon so it's
[45:54] insignificant in size ok if you take a
[45:59] whole solar system what's the moon right
[46:06] this means the moon has a great effect
[46:08] on the planet and very possibly and this
[46:11] is I didn't make this up
[46:12] very possibly is what makes life on
[46:15] Earth possible directly quoted from
[46:19] space.com now coming back to my theme of
[46:24] authority how'd he get Authority how do
[46:27] you get the power pray without ceasing
[46:30] one of the things pray without ceasing
[46:34] another another thing that grabbed me or
[46:36] struck me we were talking about brother
[46:39] a month about this whole pray without
[46:41] ceasing and I was saying what what he
[46:43] sees in that and and only recently I
[46:45] thought of and again this is that this
[46:50] is all the Nuggets I grab from all the
[46:51] other sermons someone talked about
[46:53] repetitive free it could have been proud
[46:56] of that my brother branham I'm not sure
[46:58] saying that and I want to open it an
[47:02] example here so like one of my sons
[47:05] would not name the name
[47:08] we'll ask one thing tomorrow the next
[47:11] day we'll ask something else the next
[47:13] time was that his never got his mind
[47:15] fixed on something okay there's no
[47:18] balance so me as a parent I'm sitting
[47:20] there and say okay let's take an example
[47:21] I want to I want to motocross or
[47:24] motorbike helmet because I'm gonna be a
[47:26] motocross champion and you go yep okay
[47:30] I'm listening
[47:31] so how much does it cost did you do all
[47:32] that some ease and let him think about
[47:34] it let him you know whatever next week
[47:39] he comes or now I need to be a mix i
[47:41] need to be an exit so i needed me in
[47:43] excel m't i need the meat better than I
[47:44] did today and and the colorful gold
[47:47] plated B mix cuz I'm gonna be BMX
[47:50] champions I'm listening but me as a
[47:54] parent I haven't responded so are you
[47:58] now a melted motorbike or are you be a
[48:00] mixture so I didn't go and buy that
[48:03] motive like I know better okay I've got
[48:06] some wisdom because I know now I know my
[48:10] child okay I know the other one as well
[48:13] and if he's made his mind up you can bet
[48:16] your bottom dollar and we don't beat so
[48:18] we guarantee I guarantee my bottom
[48:20] dollar right that he's made up his mind
[48:24] he thinks about it he's got a thought
[48:26] process I I need that I want that I need
[48:29] that than I and I'm gonna save up for
[48:32] that and I and I leave that as well
[48:34] because I know my child he's going to
[48:37] save up it'll get the cash he'll come to
[48:38] me said dad I'm gonna buy that yes let's
[48:42] go
[48:42] the other one I give a bit of freedom in
[48:46] his thoughts together that and say what
[48:49] do you really want what do you need
[48:50] maybe I need to persuade him a bit then
[48:53] massages is his thoughts of it right now
[48:58] with that I want to get back to pray
[49:01] without ceasing
[49:03] if I pray today Lord and this and
[49:06] there's a lot of changes happening now
[49:08] around us and now in our little church
[49:09] you know people that need to move and
[49:12] people that's coming and going and you
[49:14] know we've got people up in the air and
[49:16] people out in this South Island and
[49:18] people this building how
[49:21] there's a lot that happened so we need
[49:24] to you need to get on your knees and you
[49:26] pray you pray for healing you pray for
[49:29] and and let's take an example we will
[49:31] pray for four sisters Christine's ankle
[49:33] right but we won't break tonight and
[49:35] that's it right let's repeat that trick
[49:38] but we repeat it not out of routine what
[49:42] out of love out of authority out of I've
[49:45] seen the testimony I've been in that
[49:48] situation of healing where I receive
[49:50] that I will pray until we receive that
[49:54] okay that for me is the pray without
[49:57] ceasing it doesn't need to be a new pray
[49:59] every day but pray pray and pray some
[50:03] more now
[50:06] brother Isaac touched on this and I'll
[50:08] quickly quickly glance over that again
[50:12] and again there touched me and you will
[50:15] know exactly which Suman I was I'm
[50:17] talking about there was there was
[50:21] magnificent to me ye are God's objects
[50:26] of worship look up to look upon watch
[50:30] what we do people looking into our lives
[50:33] at our lives other Christians looking at
[50:37] us message people brothers and sisters
[50:41] looking at our lives but we will flick
[50:44] what's the authority that we approach
[50:47] something I want you to think about that
[50:51] I've got a quick quote here actually to
[50:56] from brother Branham from that time it's
[51:00] a sermon his name he's a great
[51:01] contractor before he ever had a human
[51:03] being on earth he laid out the material
[51:05] like a contractor building his
[51:06] subdivision but the James even know
[51:08] about this of Marv - it was he was going
[51:12] to make man in his own image and give
[51:14] them earth to stay they were lesser gods
[51:17] than he was jesus said your laws say
[51:21] that you are gods
[51:22] that's the minion kings dominion over
[51:25] the earth he could do anything he wanted
[51:27] to and sin come in and our women brings
[51:30] child and what when he does that child
[51:33] must die
[51:34] it's exactly it's perverted birth and
[51:36] then when the new birth comes in it
[51:38] corrects that perverted birth and gives
[51:41] it eternal life through the Father Jesus
[51:43] Christ
[51:45] oh brother jesus said he that heareth my
[51:48] word he that eateth my flesh and
[51:50] drinketh my blood has eternal life he I
[51:53] will raise him up again in that last day
[51:56] amen all the father has given me will
[51:59] come to me
[51:59] nothing is lost he'll raise her up again
[52:02] in the last day death or nothing else
[52:05] can separate us in the statue of a
[52:07] perfect man but you've got genuine faith
[52:11] genuine virtue genuine knowledge genuine
[52:14] temperance genuine patience that's
[52:18] something to strive for we are pleading
[52:22] day and night lord give me wisdom give
[52:24] me patience give me that godliness that
[52:27] love I'll get to that now see you're
[52:29] moving up right now in the Newland line
[52:31] all right firstly add godliness oh my
[52:35] god leanness to be added what does
[52:37] godliness mean I looked in four or five
[52:40] dictionaries and couldn't find even even
[52:42] find what it mean finally I was then
[52:45] down at brother Jeffrey's here we found
[52:48] it in the dictionary godliness means to
[52:50] be like God after you've got faith
[52:54] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[52:58] then be like God you say I can't do that
[53:03] brother Brennan I can't do that by the
[53:04] end yes you can let me just read you a
[53:08] few other scriptures Matthew 5 verse 48
[53:13] Matthew 5 verse 48 and see if you're
[53:17] supposed to be like God you know the
[53:18] Bible says to hear God's either see so
[53:21] why all the things that's in God is in
[53:24] you Matthew 5:48 be ye perfect be ye
[53:30] therefore perfect what is that what is
[53:33] the fiction even as your father in
[53:36] heaven is perfect
[53:40] you're not argue that
[53:43] and I've heard this now recently you are
[53:46] little and I think I pronounced it right
[53:48] MSE i'ts you know messiahs little
[53:51] Messiah Christ in you the hope of glory
[53:54] and we're not living back in nineteen
[53:57] seventy sixty five we're all grown up
[54:00] now now all of a sudden we mature
[54:02] Christians okay and what the maturity is
[54:05] coming all these fruits of the spirit
[54:07] with this maturity we understand the
[54:10] authority and the power that we can we
[54:12] can speak that can come over our tongue
[54:14] and that's why he's the author and
[54:21] finisher of our faith author meaning
[54:24] authority bringing authority and that's
[54:29] why I personally me I want to be able to
[54:31] stand here just like our beloved brother
[54:34] branham didn't say you know I am waiting
[54:36] for him to come I'm waiting for him to
[54:40] come and that's why I love about our
[54:43] preachers you hear them jokingly
[54:46] referring to they've visited some place
[54:49] and then the Brotherhood that they are
[54:51] visiting that place and say oh you can
[54:53] take the Sunday sermon I would think
[54:55] I'll be able to do that I can't walk
[54:57] into that now they just think it why cuz
[54:59] they've they've got this whole
[55:01] surrendered heart they come in
[55:03] confidence because they've seen God
[55:06] coming onto the scene they've seen the
[55:08] full surrender in their lives and they
[55:11] will receive that authority as as simple
[55:13] as that they are talking from victory
[55:16] they've had the victory met they can
[55:18] come there because God is with it now I
[55:23] want to give you a bit of history and
[55:24] from the Bible I'm going to tell you
[55:27] about something recent in terms of
[55:29] brother branham's time and something now
[55:33] to make it more rebel irrelevant for the
[55:35] young ones were the people that can't
[55:37] place themselves and don't have that
[55:39] imagination to do to illustrate the
[55:41] whole scene in the Bible or maybe in
[55:44] brother branham's days give you
[55:45] something relevant now that that shows
[55:48] Authority and shows it in action and
[55:51] shows that Caleb taking his claiming his
[55:55] mountain
[55:56] in today's terms now the one in history
[56:00] I am talking about how could Caleb claim
[56:02] his mountain that God gave him his
[56:04] Mountain that is not a cry for victory
[56:08] but that is from victory
[56:10] the Lord said that's your Mountain you
[56:16] can stand on this side and say okay
[56:20] that's my Mountain but gave you mountain
[56:31] Jacob wrestling with the angel wrestling
[56:35] not letting go saying I want my blessing
[56:39] not letting go right without ceasing
[56:43] don't stop praying don't let go
[56:45] amen now I want to try and illustrate
[56:49] like I did with brother Brad dazzle I'm
[56:51] going to quickly illustrate this were
[56:54] you happy with time but the Brenham and
[56:57] the blind woman in Arkansas 16 7 years
[57:02] 17 years old and I purposely didn't
[57:04] write anything down there because I want
[57:06] to have this in my minor try and get it
[57:08] over my lips she was blind it was
[57:11] raining
[57:12] brother Brandon was trying to I think
[57:14] get into his car something after service
[57:18] all the busses lining up now I'm
[57:20] imagining thousands of people I'm back
[57:23] in nineteen fifty 54 whenever that was
[57:25] preached that's that service it was a
[57:29] normal service it was not a pray a
[57:30] healing service or anything as I
[57:32] understand it and these people were
[57:34] going home now and buses
[57:36] back then it was segregation okay and
[57:39] what was it the Jimmy Jim Crow law is it
[57:42] the Jim Crow law so no ice no blacks no
[57:46] touching no helping no nothing right and
[57:49] this is a little black blind girl
[57:51] yelling out for her dad she lost the dad
[57:54] she's blind she's been blind since she
[57:57] was 12
[57:59] brother branham years that sees that
[58:01] this is the Holy Spirit we talking about
[58:04] thousands of people and he's hearing her
[58:06] her voice that's not the only voice
[58:10] could yourself they yeah he gets in her
[58:13] way because she's running now she's
[58:15] feeling she's coming through the crowd
[58:17] and she bumps into and she's sorry man
[58:20] can I help you yes I'm looking for my
[58:22] dad we're from Mississippi or Missouri
[58:26] he sees the Missouri bus okay I can
[58:29] guide are they but the Holy Spirit
[58:34] what is what why are you here
[58:36] are you blind yes I've been blind since
[58:39] I was 12 we wanted to come here we get
[58:43] to get the healer to to be on the stage
[58:47] with the healer to touch the healer
[58:49] right now while this is going on the Jim
[58:54] Crow law didn't stop just instantly okay
[58:57] his people wanted to get him away to
[59:00] separate them okay that is not Authority
[59:04] that is power that is just something
[59:06] that's forced upon that's tyranny okay
[59:09] and here they meet and he said I don't
[59:12] care about this law yeah I follow the
[59:14] Holy Spirit okay and they talk and it's
[59:21] like okay I can't remember all the
[59:25] detail but then he said what have I tell
[59:29] you I'm brother Brennan and she grabs me
[59:34] she cannot was your face it and she
[59:36] grabs his face thank you
[59:39] she doesn't let go brother Brennan wants
[59:44] to grab a hand to get the discernment to
[59:47] make her see she doesn't want to let go
[59:50] I'm not letting go she had him on his
[59:52] lapel and on his face she was not
[59:55] letting go and she received it so you
[1:00:00] receive this I am she said to him if you
[1:00:04] take me to this and just before he said
[1:00:06] brother branham I'm brother Brennan just
[1:00:08] before that she said you take me to the
[1:00:11] healer and I'll find my daddy myself
[1:00:14] authority fight power coming into that
[1:00:19] position that's perfectly okay so now
[1:00:24] you want something recently brother
[1:00:28] brother Isaac you're not here so now I
[1:00:30] can skim that on you like you did with
[1:00:32] brother out of months playback all he
[1:00:37] did
[1:00:37] oh and this is this is this is the
[1:00:39] extent of it all I heard was the
[1:00:42] neighbors next door need to move out
[1:00:45] that's it
[1:00:46] neighbors next door we now need to move
[1:00:49] out I don't see a car next door yes they
[1:00:53] come and go
[1:00:54] we've got sister Joe moving in and
[1:00:57] there's a few movements and there's a
[1:00:58] few changes happening but the neighbors
[1:01:01] next door need to move out that is it
[1:01:04] that's it we've prayed for them he
[1:01:08] prayed that there's movement but one
[1:01:12] little rock or people fall off the
[1:01:14] mountain is that lawyer that Devils
[1:01:17] going to tell you now the mountain
[1:01:19] hasn't moved
[1:01:19] is there one little people that fall it
[1:01:21] fell off that mountain yes this movement
[1:01:25] and that's the example people building
[1:01:29] their houses trials they come they go
[1:01:31] and all this kind of thing but don't
[1:01:32] give up on your first trial in creatin
[1:01:36] get that faith get that authority man
[1:01:39] speak from me and pray without ceasing
[1:01:41] yes we are going through a lot of change
[1:01:44] now and this this this was a lovely
[1:01:49] quote from the Bible maybe you could put
[1:01:52] that up brother Caleb that is Luke 12
[1:01:55] verse 32 look Luke 12 verse 32 fear not
[1:02:01] little flock or it's your father's good
[1:02:04] pleasure to give you the kingdom so that
[1:02:07] you have give alms provide yourselves
[1:02:10] bags with wax that won't go cold a
[1:02:13] treasure in the heavens that faileth not
[1:02:16] well no thief a thief approaches neither
[1:02:19] moth ha well where your treasure is
[1:02:23] there your heart horse it means that
[1:02:26] your loins be good at about
[1:02:27] your lights burning and you yourself
[1:02:30] like unto men that wait for their Lord
[1:02:33] when he will return from the wedding
[1:02:35] that when he cometh and knocketh they
[1:02:38] may open until and to him immediately we
[1:02:43] might be a little flock in 1 1 3 George
[1:02:46] but don't think we are little light we
[1:02:50] are shining bright until I die I'm
[1:02:53] asking you this rhetorical question how
[1:02:55] can we rule with authority without him
[1:02:59] inside of me in you preparing your heart
[1:03:03] before that twinkling of an eye moment
[1:03:08] what do people see when they see you my
[1:03:12] example and I'm about to close what I
[1:03:16] wanted to say is a small example and
[1:03:20] again relevant if we walk through that
[1:03:23] or we find kids we find the kitchen
[1:03:28] normal little kitchen little basin
[1:03:31] bridge good glasses if you walk in this
[1:03:36] Sunday morning 9 o'clock what is it it's
[1:03:39] a war room amen there is fire and
[1:03:43] there's authority and this power and
[1:03:46] perfect faith that meets in that room
[1:03:48] and that flows on into this and prepare
[1:03:52] their hearts and prepare this this
[1:03:54] congregation for something big to come
[1:03:56] and I'm seeing that every Sunday and
[1:04:02] that's why once you have that example
[1:04:04] people would see you would look at you
[1:04:06] you might see brother ben not just on
[1:04:08] the sunday but have you seen him on a
[1:04:09] friday with his little t-shirt than his
[1:04:11] tracksuit pants you know looks like this
[1:04:14] man doesn't have an authority don't be
[1:04:17] fooled about that you can walk past that
[1:04:18] kitchen and looks like a kitchen that's
[1:04:20] a war room that's a warrior pray bless
[1:04:25] you brother meaning and then I want you
[1:04:27] to quickly end with this that if the
[1:04:32] difference to divine love the difference
[1:04:35] of this world and us is arguably and
[1:04:38] this is something that's recent to me
[1:04:40] and relevant
[1:04:41] I think is a massive revelation the
[1:04:45] difference between this world out there
[1:04:47] and us in here is arguably just
[1:04:49] understanding the true definition of
[1:04:52] love
[1:04:53] one of the most perverted things
[1:04:56] probably along side with music is love
[1:04:59] the understanding of love in the message
[1:05:03] of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:05:05] and forever
[1:05:06] did he ever see people you love to be
[1:05:08] around and I can genuinely say when I
[1:05:10] come here Wednesdays and Sundays Sundays
[1:05:12] I do not want to leave that's me my wife
[1:05:15] is just tugging me tug michi also don't
[1:05:17] want to leave but cheese the wise one in
[1:05:19] this relationship right I don't want to
[1:05:23] care about anything else just love to be
[1:05:26] around them because they create an
[1:05:28] atmosphere a heavenly one and you like
[1:05:31] to be around them others seem to be good
[1:05:33] people but you just had you just have to
[1:05:36] get her away once in a while you know
[1:05:38] get along with him you know what I mean
[1:05:40] and yet they seem to be good people
[1:05:42] that's not creative a man was made to be
[1:05:47] a God you know that Genesis 1 when he
[1:05:49] sees he has dominion
[1:05:51] dumain over the whole earth and he was
[1:05:53] made to be an amateur God and now he
[1:05:55] receives God he can become son of God he
[1:05:58] was made in the image God at hands got
[1:06:01] it feet and so forth therefore a man was
[1:06:04] made like him it was an amateur God but
[1:06:06] sin has blinded every fiber in his body
[1:06:09] in his mind in his heart
[1:06:10] bless the Lord O my soul bless it listen
[1:06:16] why why well I'm this way I'm that way
[1:06:20] you'll never get anywhere with God there
[1:06:22] but your heart your faith will make you
[1:06:25] believe things that your mind knows
[1:06:26] nothing about you cause down reasoning
[1:06:29] so you must be positive that brothers
[1:06:32] positive oh my goodness Oh for them poor
[1:06:36] smile only style that is positive yes
[1:06:40] just beautiful to see and you stay there
[1:06:44] until you were positive and then you're
[1:06:46] positive there's nothing like a journey
[1:06:49] if you once received that authority that
[1:06:52] fight and see in an action
[1:06:55] and stand upon the promises of God I'm
[1:06:59] not bringing you anything new receive
[1:07:02] the authority see the authority I just
[1:07:04] wanted to bring a different angle may be
[1:07:06] in love is yeah this is wonderful great
[1:07:12] to be part of this and I think now we
[1:07:15] can pray right without ceasing we've got
[1:07:20] a few prayer requests I think uh it was
[1:07:23] just brother sister Felicity that I know
[1:07:26] about brother Ben should I hand it over
[1:07:31] to you how do you want the format
[1:07:34] okay let's sing a song musicians can you

[1:07:50] five minutes to spin in the word you
[1:07:52] will you will get a nugget you will get
[1:07:56] a nugget I'm going to quickly refer to
[1:07:58] this it is from Luke 841 okay so this is
[1:08:03] slightly stir many yesterday
[1:08:08] Salani was not at home when I came home
[1:08:10] that she was gallivanting and I came
[1:08:13] home and I was in my bag getting the key
[1:08:18] and all that kind of thing now I know
[1:08:20] where the key is in the bottom of the of
[1:08:22] the bag it's one of the annoying things
[1:08:24] I need to get out because everything
[1:08:26] needs to come out to get to the key so I
[1:08:27] thought I can shortcut I'm here and then
[1:08:30] and there and okay I feel the key feel
[1:08:32] the key
[1:08:32] I rub something I think what's that like
[1:08:34] a slippy like a receipt from a thing I
[1:08:37] bought or whatever but I just chuck it
[1:08:39] back in and open the door went into the
[1:08:42] house today this morning when I when I
[1:08:47] got to work actually just before I got
[1:08:50] to work I was standing and waiting for
[1:08:53] my carpool I got out the I was packing
[1:08:57] my life that's right back in my lunch
[1:08:59] now I need to put everything back into
[1:09:01] order I check out the slippy authority I
[1:09:03] didn't want to check it away like whoa
[1:09:06] that's small writing and adorned and me
[1:09:09] like brother Ben was with his with his
[1:09:11] Bible that was that was a way that was
[1:09:14] you know couldn't find it
[1:09:16] my dad gave me a little Gideon's Bible
[1:09:19] just the New Testament in Psalms and I
[1:09:22] and I ripped the page from there and I
[1:09:26] thought Lord what have I done this is
[1:09:29] it's not nice
[1:09:31] what does this mishit I need to get from
[1:09:34] this why would I I'm not like this why
[1:09:38] did I have to rip that oh how can I open
[1:09:41] that book and that small compartment and
[1:09:43] rip a page what is slowly putting the
[1:09:48] page together there's no not enough
[1:09:50] light so I left it and I was sad I was
[1:09:52] really really honestly sad and I came to
[1:09:55] work and I looked at where the page that
[1:10:00] was ripped out and this was so my first
[1:10:02] scripture today was Luke 10 this was
[1:10:05] Luke 8 and 9 that page before well I
[1:10:09] have to read this I have to what what is
[1:10:12] it the law trying to tell me here and
[1:10:14] behold they came a man named yah it is
[1:10:18] said this is verse 41 and he was a ruler
[1:10:22] of the synagogue and he fell down at
[1:10:24] Jesus feet and besought him that he
[1:10:27] would come into his house we had only
[1:10:30] one daughter about twelve years of age
[1:10:35] and she lay in a dying and then this is
[1:10:40] quite a rough but as he went the people
[1:10:43] thronged him and that's where the story
[1:10:45] stopped I thought what is why and a
[1:10:49] woman having an issue with blood twelve
[1:10:52] years which has spent all a living upon
[1:10:56] us that physicians neither could be
[1:10:58] healed of any pain behind him and
[1:11:00] touched the border of his garment and
[1:11:02] immediately her issue of blood stones
[1:11:05] and Jesus said and now you know the
[1:11:08] story who touched me and Jesus said
[1:11:11] somebody hath touched me for I perceive
[1:11:14] that virtue has gone out of me and it
[1:11:17] carries on and when that woman saw that
[1:11:20] she has not hid
[1:11:22] she came trembling falling down before
[1:11:24] him she declared unto Him before all the
[1:11:27] people for what for she has touched him
[1:11:29] how she was healed immediately now this
[1:11:32] struck me and he said unto her daughter
[1:11:37] be of good comfort I went into the court
[1:11:41] and the concordance who got here is the
[1:11:46] is the Greek word I think and it comes
[1:11:51] from female child it comes from a
[1:11:53] descendent he was identifying her with
[1:11:57] him
[1:11:58] he sang daughter she had authority that
[1:12:02] she had faith and authority who touch
[1:12:05] that garment to know something will
[1:12:07] happen if I can only touch His garment
[1:12:09] just before that that that man was his
[1:12:13] only child where is he gone what's
[1:12:15] happened be right without ceasing she
[1:12:20] went through that crowd of a thousand it
[1:12:23] touches God that's the hem of His
[1:12:25] garment
[1:12:33] and we can we sing that some 10,000
