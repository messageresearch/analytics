[8:53] here this morning we rebuke any wrong
[8:55] spirit in the name of the lord jesus
[8:56] christ and may the holy ghost have full
[8:58] control of the service we just pray and
[9:00] commit everything to you in jesus
[9:01] wonderful name
[9:02] amen praise the lord
[9:05] so we've got two songs the two praise
[9:07] songs for you this morning the first one
[9:09] is called delight yourself in the lord
[9:12] and brother andy wrote this one as well
[9:15] his brother um
[9:17] brother ben preached the sermon one time
[9:19] and it was about
[9:20] ziglag you know how david went through
[9:22] the trouble and then but it says that
[9:24] david delighted himself in the lord this
[9:26] is when all his men were wanting to
[9:27] stone him and say oh what have you done
[9:29] you've we followed you we thought it was
[9:30] all going to work and now it's all our
[9:32] families are gone but the bible says
[9:35] that david got really upset and
[9:36] depressed and he just walked away
[9:39] sorry that's not what my bible says
[9:42] just checking
[9:44] i was waiting for someone to say amen
[9:46] [Laughter]
[9:49] no
[9:50] david delighted himself in the lord
[9:52] praise the lord
[9:54] everything's well
[9:55] and you know what happened
[9:57] everything was well
[9:58] they got back everything and so the song
[10:00] is delight yourself in the lord the
[10:02] person at the center of our faith
[10:04] delight yourself and see him face to
[10:05] face
[10:06] delight yourself and the lord regardless
[10:08] of what i see or what the enemy tries to
[10:10] take from me my heart will sing his
[10:12] praise
[10:13] as our lord descends at the end of days
[10:16] amen so that was a it was actually enjoy
[10:19] joy but i think the whole a lot of the
[10:20] band got together and um sort of put all
[10:22] the music and that together with that
[10:24] one it was quite an enjoyable experience
[10:25] building that that song
[10:27] um
[10:28] is that how we did it brother andy it
[10:29] was you got most of it and then it was
[10:31] one of those ones that was it was a very
[10:32] good time actually making yeah it was
[10:35] making that one was a lot of
[10:37] um was really good and the next one is
[10:39] called that we're going to sing is
[10:40] called mighty warrior
[10:42] and
[10:45] sometimes
[10:47] you feel like a mighty warrior
[10:49] well all the time you should actually
[10:52] so
[10:53] i think one day i must have been feeling
[10:54] like a mighty warrior so the chorus says
[10:56] i am a mighty warrior fearless in battle
[10:59] moving forward in the name of the lord
[11:01] and i descend from a line of kings
[11:04] hey it's the bible says we are kings and
[11:06] priests to god and we're children of the
[11:08] king so theoretically everyone's gone
[11:10] before me are kings so i'm like well
[11:12] that's my lineage i descend from a line
[11:14] of kings
[11:15] and i will reign for eternity
[11:18] and the
[11:19] you may think that like things like the
[11:20] second verse may be quite bold but it
[11:22] says i'll not draw back in times of
[11:24] failure though i might may fail and me
[11:27] is the unfailing god
[11:29] i'll come back bigger better harder
[11:31] wiser by the power of jesus
[11:34] i'll put forth my sword in the name of
[11:35] the lord
[11:37] my
[11:37] sword will not turn back my bow will not
[11:40] turn back my sword will not return empty
[11:42] and then the bridge is every mountain
[11:44] shall be moved in the name of the lord
[11:46] every giant that i face i'll defeat
[11:48] every weapon that is formed against me
[11:50] will not stand in him as complete
[11:52] victory
[11:53] amen

[35:24] to play before brother um
[35:26] freddie comes up
[35:28] one of them is called miracle working
[35:30] god
[35:31] and that's the god that we serve as a
[35:33] miracle working god
[35:35] and um
[35:41] i was going through actually something
[35:42] maybe can i say that dave all right
[35:48] by the way
[35:50] brother freddie and ferdi and the
[35:52] fellowship there you've had a great
[35:53] impact on my children i don't know if
[35:54] you realize that like i don't know if
[35:56] you know that hannah received the holy
[35:57] ghost at one of your conventions
[35:59] over here hannah's on the words
[36:03] [Applause]
[36:18] what
[36:19] 2018
[36:21] yeah
[36:23] so if you notice the words have been
[36:24] sort of turning over quite well that's
[36:26] been hannah banana over there
[36:28] and
[36:30] [Applause]
[36:38] and i know you've had a big impact on
[36:40] dave's life because he's been up there
[36:41] at conventions at different times and
[36:43] he's been at different phases in his
[36:44] walk and he's
[36:46] it's he knows you guys and it's you've
[36:48] had an impact on him a lot so i'm
[36:50] looking forward to him going up there
[36:51] for another another convention when he's
[36:53] in this state he's going to really enjoy
[36:54] it
[36:55] maybe
[36:59] so we we really do appreciate you
[37:01] brothers we we really do yeah you've
[37:03] made a i don't know if you know this but
[37:04] you've had a big impact on our family so
[37:06] it's really good
[37:08] um so this song the song was when you
[37:11] know we go through trials and satan
[37:13] messes with us a lot in the trial
[37:15] you know he always casts doubt and fear
[37:17] and everything at us that's his job it's
[37:19] what he's supposed to do so
[37:20] that's a good thing you should say you
[37:22] bring it on is that all you've got
[37:24] because i believe
[37:26] i believe
[37:27] we're not scared we're not we don't
[37:29] cower we stand up we say no i believe
[37:32] so i was getting a lot of that a lot of
[37:34] that i don't want to make this sound
[37:35] like i always stand up and do this
[37:37] because honestly sometimes i don't but i
[37:39] think to myself if i at least pin how i
[37:41] feel in a moment of strength into a song
[37:43] it'll be there it'll be there eternally
[37:45] then i'll just sing the song and it's
[37:46] there
[37:48] so that was what you know the devil was
[37:50] messing with me with dave like oh he's
[37:51] never going to come back in it's because
[37:52] you did this you did that and
[37:55] you know you failed and it's nev your
[37:57] christmases are never going to be nice
[37:58] because it's always going to be him with
[38:00] maybe you get some
[38:01] or
[38:02] you have some child summer and that's
[38:04] going to be messed up family just
[38:05] messing with you all the time and i say
[38:07] no man it's not going to be
[38:09] so i felt like one day i thought i'm
[38:10] going to pin my response and go to
[38:12] church the next day and sing out my
[38:14] response
[38:15] you know like when an enemy is coming at
[38:17] you and they they say they say you
[38:18] should surrender and hear our terms i
[38:20] fell like this little
[38:22] saying you send this messenger back to
[38:23] him we're never gonna surrender we're
[38:25] not accepting your turn
[38:27] and
[38:31] what's more in the morning like we're
[38:32] coming after you with everything we've

[57:59] many years have we been going
[58:02] thing is about going 17 years
[58:05] and uh listen when we started
[58:09] it the day that the lord told me to
[58:12] move on
[58:13] i was i was in brother derek's church
[58:15] and i was quite happy
[58:17] and then all of a sudden god just says
[58:20] to me it's time for you to move on
[58:23] i i didn't know what what god what what
[58:26] god wanted and i said lord god i'm from
[58:28] south africa i don't know anybody
[58:31] in new zealand and you want me to
[58:34] to move on and uh
[58:37] i remember
[58:38] the morning of the 12th of uh
[58:41] june
[58:42] 2005
[58:45] when we
[58:46] myself and doreen we walked out
[58:49] and i remember
[58:50] further telling me i'll i'll see you at
[58:52] church dad
[58:54] i says no you you won't see me at church
[58:57] and you want to know why why are we not
[58:59] going to see you at church are you
[59:01] preaching my brother
[59:02] because brother stewart that dad was at
[59:04] that time
[59:06] having fellowship together and he asked
[59:07] me are you going over to brother sam i
[59:09] said no we
[59:10] we're starting our own church today
[59:13] he looked at me and now we've been
[59:15] living together all the years and
[59:17] i never mentioned it to him not once did
[59:20] i mention
[59:21] or to anybody
[59:23] but i just knew that and i've kept it to
[59:25] myself the only person i went to speak
[59:27] to was brother derek donaldson which was
[59:29] my past at that time
[59:31] and i just went to tell him
[59:33] and i remember opening the door
[59:35] of the little hall
[59:38] can can i just give a testimony
[59:42] i remember opening the hall and
[59:46] setting the chairs i think we said about
[59:48] 30 chairs we say
[59:50] but only me my wife
[59:52] said the 30 chairs and
[59:55] i pulled out my accordion
[59:57] and our song leader i was deacon i was
[1:00:01] minister
[1:00:03] and my wife was the amen corner
[1:00:06] [Applause]
[1:00:07] amen
[1:00:10] so it all started from there all started
[1:00:13] from there
[1:00:14] and it was amazing how god just
[1:00:18] confirmed you know we would remember we
[1:00:21] got this little hall
[1:00:22] we we just a little hall on great north
[1:00:26] road and
[1:00:27] uh if you ever go down that area just
[1:00:29] look on the right side you go into the
[1:00:31] motorway you'll see a little hall there
[1:00:33] it's called the lion's hall
[1:00:36] and
[1:00:37] but i didn't know brother andy that
[1:00:40] there was a quote
[1:00:42] concerning the lion's law
[1:00:45] and uh found a quote
[1:00:48] brother branham was in south africa
[1:00:51] in durban and he
[1:00:52] that morning he was praying and he says
[1:00:55] lord this is not a church
[1:00:58] this is a hall it's used by the kiwines
[1:01:01] and it's used by the lions
[1:01:04] and
[1:01:05] but we're going to make it a church
[1:01:06] today
[1:01:08] and then i realized when i looked at the
[1:01:11] wall
[1:01:12] and i saw the lions all
[1:01:15] and that's okay with no kiwinis
[1:01:17] i said god this is this is you
[1:01:19] confirming
[1:01:21] that this is the place where you want us
[1:01:22] to start and i mentioned to brother
[1:01:25] derrick
[1:01:26] later on and he and he said to me
[1:01:27] brother freddie that in the early 80s
[1:01:30] there was a message church in that role
[1:01:33] so everything was just
[1:01:36] amen so that's why i say if god starts
[1:01:39] something
[1:01:41] amen no matter the
[1:01:44] the bad omens and the guys that's
[1:01:46] telling you it's not going to stand it's
[1:01:48] just going to be a fad
[1:01:51] it's been 10 years brother ben
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:55] and at 17 years with us brother malcolm
[1:01:57] i think it's almost 40 years
[1:02:01] malcolm
[1:02:05] amen
[1:02:08] so one of these days we're gonna have a
[1:02:10] big thing down up north there brother
[1:02:13] amen
[1:02:15] coming to celebrate with you
[1:02:19] do you want to read a quote quickly this
[1:02:20] is for the church brother ben is for you
[1:02:22] and the church brother branham says it
[1:02:25] is i be not afraid
[1:02:28] brother bland says moses had the dry
[1:02:30] stick in his hand
[1:02:32] he says in moses hand it was nothing
[1:02:35] else but the stick
[1:02:37] that he had picked up
[1:02:39] perhaps on the desert
[1:02:41] but once
[1:02:43] when that hand of faith
[1:02:45] have taken a hold of that stick
[1:02:48] it became god's judgment rod to the
[1:02:51] world
[1:02:53] that dry stick
[1:02:55] became the judgment rot
[1:02:58] remember moses stretch that rod he
[1:03:02] stretched the rod over the sea
[1:03:05] he stretched it in the air
[1:03:07] it was god's judgment rod
[1:03:11] the eject those egyptians
[1:03:13] if they ever could have got that rod
[1:03:16] from moses
[1:03:18] they would have had the israelites
[1:03:20] whipped
[1:03:21] and that is what it takes today as the
[1:03:24] rod was in moses's hand
[1:03:27] so is the name of jesus christ
[1:03:32] in the hand of your church brother ben
[1:03:36] yes sir
[1:03:38] in the hand of chicano
[1:03:40] church tabernacle
[1:03:42] so is the name
[1:03:44] of jesus christ in the church's end
[1:03:48] if the church will hold that name
[1:03:51] of jesus esteem it
[1:03:54] and honor it
[1:03:56] and quit using it in slang or so forth
[1:04:00] and use it in the power and reverence
[1:04:03] it will conquer every enemy
[1:04:07] that god has got on the earth
[1:04:10] in my name shall they cast out devils
[1:04:14] in my name they shall hands on the sick
[1:04:17] all these things
[1:04:19] in his name
[1:04:21] may god bless you church may god bless

[1:24:00] about jacob
[1:24:02] and behold i am with thee and i will

[1:24:16] you mean jacob when he was doing all his
[1:24:19] shady deals god was with him
[1:24:24] god said if you turn left

[1:24:29] when you turn right i'll be with you
[1:24:33] brother when you rob laban
[1:24:37] of his livestock god says i will be with
[1:24:41] you

[1:25:08] nightfall
[1:25:09] and now jacob was tired and he was going
[1:25:12] to have a nap
[1:25:14] and god and brother had now noticed
[1:25:17] jacob he fell into a trance
[1:25:20] god was talking to his servant
[1:25:24] his servant
[1:25:27] the man that lied the man that stole the
[1:25:30] man that connived
[1:25:33] and god now says i'm talking to my
[1:25:36] servant
[1:25:38] jacob so brother it's time that we rise
[1:25:42] up man
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:45] we rise our brother
[1:25:48] hallelujah god is not looking this
[1:25:50] morning church
[1:25:53] at your state
[1:25:55] your stake me right down there but is
[1:25:58] looking at your standing
[1:26:00] who you are
[1:26:03] ordained predestinated
[1:26:05] son of god
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:12] god was not talking to his servant
[1:26:14] because in his servant
[1:26:17] not because he was righteous
[1:26:20] but because god had made a promise
[1:26:26] and brother blam says look at the way
[1:26:28] jacob got it
[1:26:30] look at the way jacob got the promise
[1:26:35] oh my
[1:26:38] that's why i often say to the church i
[1:26:40] says if we look at the life of david
[1:26:43] what he did and how he lived
[1:26:46] would we ever have that young man as our
[1:26:49] pastor
[1:26:51] would you ever choose david as your
[1:26:54] pastor
[1:26:56] none of us would they
[1:26:59] but god
[1:27:01] god look
[1:27:02] beyond the failure frailties of of david
[1:27:07] look beyond that
[1:27:09] and he looked at david and he says as a
[1:27:11] man after my own heart
[1:27:14] a man brother of them david had a heart
[1:27:17] of confession
[1:27:20] david had a heart of beings i'm sorry
[1:27:23] that's a heart that david had
[1:27:26] hallelujah
[1:27:28] brother brother bam says he wasn't
[1:27:30] righteous
[1:27:31] but because god has made a promise
[1:27:34] he says look at the way jacob got it
[1:27:37] but god had made a promise
[1:27:40] and god had to keep it
[1:27:43] in the loins of jacob laid the blessed
[1:27:47] righteous seed
[1:27:49] that must come forth from there
[1:27:52] in jacob lied that seed as we heard last
[1:27:56] night about joseph
[1:27:58] amen son of prosperity
[1:28:00] joseph typing christ
[1:28:02] and joseph had to come from the loins of
[1:28:06] jacob
[1:28:07] and when jacob was doing all those shady
[1:28:10] deals
[1:28:12] the seed of god was in him
[1:28:15] already
[1:28:17] hallelujah
[1:28:18] and brother bam says according he says
[1:28:21] that righteous blessed righteous seed
[1:28:24] that must come from him there according
[1:28:27] to isaac his father
[1:28:30] which had been promised through abraham
[1:28:33] and in jacob's loins was the seed laying
[1:28:37] there
[1:28:40] and the prophet of god said not because
[1:28:42] he deserved it
[1:28:45] but because god had promised it
[1:28:49] not because you and i got it right
[1:28:55] not because something that you had done
[1:28:58] but god has given you that same kind of
[1:29:02] a promise
[1:29:04] unconditional
[1:29:07] not what i have done or you have done
[1:29:10] but what god has done
[1:29:13] what god has ordained me to be
[1:29:18] hallelujah
[1:29:20] so stop looking at your failures
[1:29:24] stop looking at your faults
[1:29:27] stop looking at your shortcomings
[1:29:30] look at the promise that god gave you

[1:36:22] ghost to mortify the deeds of the body
[1:36:26] you will live
[1:36:29] that scripture to me
[1:36:31] is so personal
[1:36:33] because i've been there i've been a
[1:36:35] young man
[1:36:36] i grew up amen
[1:36:39] praise the lord
[1:36:40] and i faced issues you face issues

[1:37:29] they shake you they stomp on you they
[1:37:32] twist you they throw you on your back
[1:37:35] because you desire to be delivered
[1:37:38] [Music]

[1:37:43] you desire to come to church and raise
[1:37:45] your hands

[1:37:48] become a miss the enemy will tell you
[1:37:50] you ain't got no right to lift your
[1:37:52] hands
[1:37:53] that's why many of our christians can't
[1:37:56] lift their hands
[1:37:58] because the enemy has trapped them
[1:38:00] somewhere along the way
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:06] and i went brother
[1:38:10] i wanted that power
[1:38:12] to overcome self
[1:38:15] wanted the power to overcome
[1:38:19] to be able to say no
[1:38:23] so i didn't mind them twisting my neck
[1:38:27] i didn't mind them stomping and sitting
[1:38:29] with their knee on my back
[1:38:31] i wanted power from god
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:36] develop a life of holiness
[1:38:43] and while i was crying to god god just
[1:38:45] turned my attention to
[1:38:47] romans chapter 8 13.
[1:38:51] i said god is it that easy
[1:38:55] yeah they almost busted my back
[1:38:58] you almost now you know the pentecostal
[1:39:00] people
[1:39:03] many they can turn you upside down they
[1:39:05] turn you upside down
[1:39:07] and they'll shake you or shake all that
[1:39:09] cigarettes out of your pockets brother
[1:39:12] they'll shake you
[1:39:14] all those illicit things that you keep
[1:39:16] in your pocket
[1:39:17] they'll turn you upside down and they'll
[1:39:19] shake you
[1:39:20] until all those things that matches and
[1:39:23] everything that you're trying to hide
[1:39:25] lies on the floor in front of the deacon
[1:39:29] he says now you're ready for prayer
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:34] now you really will pray
[1:39:35] [Applause]
[1:39:37] hallelujah
[1:39:39] i said to dazul yesterday when i saw the
[1:39:42] prayer line
[1:39:43] and the time that he spent in praying
[1:39:45] for those souls i says that's the way
[1:39:49] that's the way
[1:39:51] not the quick and the easy way and just
[1:39:53] no no no no i remember those years
[1:39:57] hallelujah
[1:39:58] remember those years brother
[1:40:01] when we prayed for the sick and the
[1:40:02] needy
[1:40:04] brother those
[1:40:06] there was so much power
[1:40:08] the guys coming to the altar they take
[1:40:11] their
[1:40:12] back pocket
[1:40:13] half jacks of brandy and
[1:40:15] small dog wine and brandy
[1:40:18] they come to the altar and they just
[1:40:20] start pulling they see out of their
[1:40:21] pockets and putting it at the altar
[1:40:23] man those are the days
[1:40:27] those were the days by malcolm when we
[1:40:30] we wept with them we cried with them we
[1:40:33] stayed with them
[1:40:35] until they broke through
[1:40:39] [Applause]
[1:40:46] rather you will only know
[1:40:49] the pain that guy is going through
[1:40:52] when you walk in issues
[1:40:57] many of these drugs have been on drugs
[1:40:59] you can't tell them
[1:41:00] i know what you're going through
[1:41:02] if you have not smoking the pipe within
[1:41:08] you'll only know that when you have
[1:41:11] felt the pain
[1:41:14] i spoke to all one
[1:41:17] a couple of years back i spoke to a
[1:41:18] young girl
[1:41:20] having a tremendous meetings and the
[1:41:22] power of god
[1:41:23] that you came out and
[1:41:26] normally i tell them
[1:41:28] when you give your life to the lord this
[1:41:30] and this and this and this
[1:41:32] i'm not telling them the skies will be
[1:41:34] blue
[1:41:35] i'm not telling them the birds is going
[1:41:37] to sing
[1:41:38] i'm not telling the day is going to be
[1:41:40] different tomorrow than it is now
[1:41:43] and i told this young lady what the word
[1:41:46] demands
[1:41:48] and after i spoke to our asia
[1:41:51] do you still want to give your life to
[1:41:53] the lord
[1:41:54] jesus no
[1:41:56] prices yes
[1:41:59] walked away
[1:42:02] and it was two years
[1:42:04] when i saw again
[1:42:06] but this time she was bedraggled
[1:42:10] this time you can see life is treated to
[1:42:12] mean
[1:42:14] she came to the old and she
[1:42:16] and i asked are you
[1:42:18] ready now
[1:42:21] yes
[1:42:22] [Applause]
[1:42:24] i've
[1:42:27] and they come seen in
[1:42:29] the bin and they lie at the altar
[1:42:32] and when they walk away from there you
[1:42:34] see a puddle
[1:42:36] of tears
[1:42:39] lying there
[1:42:41] that was no dry eyed confession
[1:42:45] i think we many times have too much
[1:42:47] dried eyed
[1:42:49] i think many times we don't get to get
[1:42:51] the believers to to the cross to calvary
[1:42:55] we get them rather to the message
[1:42:58] no problem with that
[1:43:00] but get them to the message after you've
[1:43:02] taken them to the cross
[1:43:05] get them then to the message after
[1:43:07] you've taken them to calvary
[1:43:10] because there's a way back to god
[1:43:13] from the dark parts of sun
[1:43:16] there's a door that is open that you can
[1:43:18] go in
[1:43:20] and cover his cross
[1:43:22] that's where you begin
[1:43:25] when you come as a sinner to jesus
[1:43:30] hallelujah
[1:43:32] and i think that's the reason why we
[1:43:34] have so much battles and young people
[1:43:35] walking away because they never met
[1:43:37] christ
[1:43:38] [Applause]
[1:43:40] they never had an experience the
[1:43:42] realities of god
[1:43:44] when god becomes real to you
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:44:02] where did i go
[1:44:04] but i want to tell you this morning
[1:44:06] church i've been there
[1:44:08] i've seen
[1:44:10] but i can tell you through this morning
[1:44:12] young people
[1:44:14] get to romans 8 13.
[1:44:17] if you live according to the flesh
[1:44:19] you're gonna die
[1:44:20] but if you buy the holy ghost morty the
[1:44:23] holy ghost mortify the deeds of the body
[1:44:27] that mortified word means kill
[1:44:31] kill it
[1:44:34] hallelujah
[1:44:36] oh my
[1:44:38] so brother braham says to this promise
[1:44:41] not because you got it right
[1:44:44] not because you had it all together
[1:44:46] brother not because of that he gave it
[1:44:48] to you on the same basis he gave jacob
[1:44:51] the promise
[1:44:53] by his grace
[1:44:55] the prophet of god says don't let nobody
[1:44:58] tell you
[1:44:59] that any kind of move in the world
[1:45:02] can ever interfere with god's great cog
[1:45:06] i read that again
[1:45:08] don't let no devil in hell tell you
[1:45:11] oh my of any kind of attack
[1:45:15] or any kind of move in the world
[1:45:18] can ever interfere
[1:45:21] with god's great cog
[1:45:23] she's moving right on brothertas
[1:45:27] amen there's nothing yet gone can
[1:45:30] nullify the prob the plan of god
[1:45:33] he says it was planned back there in the
[1:45:35] beginning
[1:45:37] your
[1:45:38] me
[1:45:39] us
[1:45:40] planned right back
[1:45:42] in the beginning
[1:45:43] so brother there is nothing nothing
[1:45:46] nothing
[1:45:47] let me tell you this morning there is
[1:45:49] nothing nothing nothing
[1:45:51] can change god's program
[1:45:54] concerning your life and my life
[1:45:57] he says it was planned back there from
[1:45:59] the beginning
[1:46:01] and there ain't a devil or enough devils
[1:46:05] can interfere
[1:46:08] with this program
[1:46:10] hallelujah
[1:46:12] so this morning i trust i'm talking to
[1:46:14] the right group this morning

[1:46:41] but if you this morning want to put your
[1:46:43] shoulder to the wagon
[1:46:45] and want to push it uphill
[1:46:48] because normally you find very few that
[1:46:50] want to push the wagon uphill
[1:46:53] but when the wagon gets up at the top
[1:46:56] everybody want to jump on for a free
[1:46:58] ride
[1:47:00] but god wants people to push the wagon
[1:47:03] [Music]
