ask them hey would you like to stop this guy going to church they would say yes will this girl go and lady go to church yes let's stop them so theoretically you fought through every devil and hell to get to church and you made it you walked in the door you're like i'm here so so we pet each other on the back in the morning we're like you're a winner you're a champion so pet each other on the back say hello to each other this morning say hello to your fellow champions let's just greet each other [Music] you're a winner john keep on winning you won you won again [Music] you won again what does it feel like to keep winning you're a winner you made it by the tears you're a winner you made it [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] praise the lord okay [Music] it's good to be here man if we don't watch it we'll let this get to our heads you know we're in the company of winners [Music] praise the lord who's excited to be here this morning amen we are going to have a fantastic time in the lord this morning [Music] he's going to bless us in ways we never thought possible because he's an almighty god amen let's um let's stand this morning and let some open in prayer heavenly father what a great privilege it is to have the honor lord to fight every devil and hell to be here to worship you lord jesus lord it's a any fight for you is a fight worth having lord and we thank you lord that through you we have the victory lord jesus because you made the first victory law which was die on the cross and pay the price for our redemption that we could be here this morning lord so we just thank you for this grand opportunity lord we wouldn't miss it for the world and we just want to invite you into our midst lord may you feel at liberty may you feel at home working amongst us lord and having your way may you take control of the songs take control of the ministry take control of the sound take control of the every heart here this morning we rebuke any wrong spirit in the name of the lord jesus christ and may the holy ghost have full control of the service we just pray and commit everything to you in jesus wonderful name amen praise the lord so we've got two songs the two praise songs for you this morning the first one is called delight yourself in the lord and brother andy wrote this one as well his brother um brother ben preached the sermon one time and it was about ziglag you know how david went through the trouble and then but it says that david delighted himself in the lord this is when all his men were wanting to stone him and say oh what have you done you've we followed you we thought it was all going to work and now it's all our families are gone but the bible says that david got really upset and depressed and he just walked away sorry that's not what my bible says just checking i was waiting for someone to say amen [Laughter] no david delighted himself in the lord praise the lord everything's well and you know what happened everything was well they got back everything and so the song is delight yourself in the lord the person at the center of our faith delight yourself and see him face to face delight yourself and the lord regardless of what i see or what the enemy tries to take from me my heart will sing his praise as our lord descends at the end of days amen so that was a it was actually enjoy joy but i think the whole a lot of the band got together and um sort of put all the music and that together with that one it was quite an enjoyable experience building that that song um is that how we did it brother andy it was you got most of it and then it was one of those ones that was it was a very good time actually making yeah it was making that one was a lot of um was really good and the next one is called that we're going to sing is called mighty warrior and sometimes you feel like a mighty warrior well all the time you should actually so i think one day i must have been feeling like a mighty warrior so the chorus says i am a mighty warrior fearless in battle moving forward in the name of the lord and i descend from a line of kings hey it's the bible says we are kings and priests to god and we're children of the king so theoretically everyone's gone before me are kings so i'm like well that's my lineage i descend from a line of kings and i will reign for eternity and the you may think that like things like the second verse may be quite bold but it says i'll not draw back in times of failure though i might may fail and me is the unfailing god i'll come back bigger better harder wiser by the power of jesus i'll put forth my sword in the name of the lord my sword will not turn back my bow will not turn back my sword will not return empty and then the bridge is every mountain shall be moved in the name of the lord every giant that i face i'll defeat every weapon that is formed against me will not stand in him as complete victory amen brother malcolm you are going to open this afternoon service in prayer and bring a greeting from the brethren up north [Music] i was looking for you for this one bro but i couldn't see you so now you got time to prepare delight yourself and the lord [Music] the person at the center of our faith delight yourself and see him face to the lord face yourself to delight yourself in the lord the person at the center of our faith delight yourself regardless of what i see or what the enemy tries to take from me my heart will sing his praise as i stand unshaken steadfast is the open door to every place i've never been before i delight myself in him [Music] the person at the center of our [Music] regardless of how i feel [Music] as our lord descends at the end of the day he gives me everything beyond all that i could ever dream i delight [Music] [Music] the person [Music] feel like [Music] yourself and see him face to face [Music] every battle i fight i'll win [Music] myself in here [Music] [Music] is [Music] myself in [Music] [Music] the person at the center of our faith delight yourself and see him face to face delight yourself in the light yourself delight yourself in the lord the person at the center of our faith delight yourself and see him face to face [Music] yourself and see him face to face still like yourself in been alone [Music] i will not fear the whole thing in jesus christ i'll always have the victory this is my hour this is [Music] i am mighty warrior fearless moving forward [Music] with jesus christ when jesus cried i'll not draw back in times of failure [Music] [Music] stronger [Music] moving forward [Music] every mountain and every mountain will be moved in the name of the lord every giant that i face i'll defeat every weapon that is [Music] in the name of [Music] every weapon that is [Music] moving forward [Music] with

[Applause] [Music] amen praise the lord amen i really enjoyed that thank you very much amen we've had some great specials here this weekend it's been really enjoyable amen the um so we've got some just two worship songs to play before brother um freddie comes up one of them is called miracle working god and that's the god that we serve as a miracle working god and um i was going through actually something maybe can i say that dave all right by the way brother freddie and ferdi and the fellowship there you've had a great impact on my children i don't know if you realize that like i don't know if you know that hannah received the holy ghost at one of your conventions over here hannah's on the words [Applause] what 2018 yeah so if you notice the words have been sort of turning over quite well that's been hannah banana over there and [Applause] and i know you've had a big impact on dave's life because he's been up there at conventions at different times and he's been at different phases in his walk and he's it's he knows you guys and it's you've had an impact on him a lot so i'm looking forward to him going up there for another another convention when he's in this state he's going to really enjoy it maybe so we we really do appreciate you brothers we we really do yeah you've made a i don't know if you know this but you've had a big impact on our family so it's really good um so this song the song was when you know we go through trials and satan messes with us a lot in the trial you know he always casts doubt and fear and everything at us that's his job it's what he's supposed to do so that's a good thing you should say you bring it on is that all you've got because i believe i believe we're not scared we're not we don't cower we stand up we say no i believe so i was getting a lot of that a lot of that i don't want to make this sound like i always stand up and do this because honestly sometimes i don't but i think to myself if i at least pin how i feel in a moment of strength into a song it'll be there it'll be there eternally then i'll just sing the song and it's there so that was what you know the devil was messing with me with dave like oh he's never going to come back in it's because you did this you did that and you know you failed and it's nev your christmases are never going to be nice because it's always going to be him with maybe you get some or you have some child summer and that's going to be messed up family just messing with you all the time and i say no man it's not going to be so i felt like one day i thought i'm going to pin my response and go to church the next day and sing out my response you know like when an enemy is coming at you and they they say they say you should surrender and hear our terms i fell like this little saying you send this messenger back to him we're never gonna surrender we're not accepting your turn and what's more in the morning like we're coming after you with everything we've got [Laughter] because that's how we roll and so the the verse says no matter what i see no matter what i hear no matter what i feel i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i look and it seems like it's broken i'll lay a hallelujah on the altar okay the other one is um be still and it's about when you you know sometimes you're in a storm and you just can't you look around you think man what's what about all this but and every storm that you go through were you you're going through one now the lord is there jesus is here waves you won't break me storm you won't shake me jesus is here all your tempest you will all be still peace be still we can just call peace in the middle of a storm amen let some stand this morning and sing [Music] no

feel honored to be part of this fellowship it's almost like our sister the sister fellowship and just amazing how god just orchestrated everything amen meeting brother ben meeting the believers it has been uh good must have been a rough ride also eh not just all rosie so there must have been some rough patches but uh through it all god has been faithful and i just want to say when when god starts something amen the purpose of god can never be defeated so we are so thankful that we can be part of this move of god and a memory this morning we just want to on behalf of the little fellowship back in auckland uh and my wife we just want to amen congratulate you brother ben and the christine and the fellowship of the church that helps the governments we want to just say god bless you richly on behalf of our little fellowship done down in auckland and uh our prayers and our wishes may god bless you the way forward amen the challenges that you would face we're just down into trying to count how many years have we been going thing is about going 17 years and uh listen when we started it the day that the lord told me to move on i was i was in brother derek's church and i was quite happy and then all of a sudden god just says to me it's time for you to move on i i didn't know what what god what what god wanted and i said lord god i'm from south africa i don't know anybody in new zealand and you want me to to move on and uh i remember the morning of the 12th of uh june 2005 when we myself and doreen we walked out and i remember further telling me i'll i'll see you at church dad i says no you you won't see me at church and you want to know why why are we not going to see you at church are you preaching my brother because brother stewart that dad was at that time having fellowship together and he asked me are you going over to brother sam i said no we we're starting our own church today he looked at me and now we've been living together all the years and i never mentioned it to him not once did i mention or to anybody but i just knew that and i've kept it to myself the only person i went to speak to was brother derek donaldson which was my past at that time and i just went to tell him and i remember opening the door of the little hall can can i just give a testimony i remember opening the hall and setting the chairs i think we said about 30 chairs we say but only me my wife said the 30 chairs and i pulled out my accordion and our song leader i was deacon i was minister and my wife was the amen corner [Applause] amen so it all started from there all started from there and it was amazing how god just confirmed you know we would remember we got this little hall we we just a little hall on great north road and uh if you ever go down that area just look on the right side you go into the motorway you'll see a little hall there it's called the lion's hall and but i didn't know brother andy that there was a quote concerning the lion's law and uh found a quote brother branham was in south africa in durban and he that morning he was praying and he says lord this is not a church this is a hall it's used by the kiwines and it's used by the lions and but we're going to make it a church today and then i realized when i looked at the wall and i saw the lions all and that's okay with no kiwinis i said god this is this is you confirming that this is the place where you want us to start and i mentioned to brother derrick later on and he and he said to me brother freddie that in the early 80s there was a message church in that role so everything was just amen so that's why i say if god starts something amen no matter the the bad omens and the guys that's telling you it's not going to stand it's just going to be a fad it's been 10 years brother ben amen and at 17 years with us brother malcolm i think it's almost 40 years malcolm amen so one of these days we're gonna have a big thing down up north there brother amen coming to celebrate with you do you want to read a quote quickly this is for the church brother ben is for you and the church brother branham says it is i be not afraid brother bland says moses had the dry stick in his hand he says in moses hand it was nothing else but the stick that he had picked up perhaps on the desert but once when that hand of faith have taken a hold of that stick it became god's judgment rod to the world that dry stick became the judgment rot remember moses stretch that rod he stretched the rod over the sea he stretched it in the air it was god's judgment rod the eject those egyptians if they ever could have got that rod from moses they would have had the israelites whipped and that is what it takes today as the rod was in moses's hand so is the name of jesus christ in the hand of your church brother ben yes sir in the hand of chicano church tabernacle so is the name of jesus christ in the church's end if the church will hold that name of jesus esteem it and honor it and quit using it in slang or so forth and use it in the power and reverence it will conquer every enemy that god has got on the earth in my name shall they cast out devils in my name they shall hands on the sick all these things in his name may god bless you church may god bless you i i tell you brother ben i i thought we had all the cream of the crop in auckland but i see you got some of them there too you really got tremendous men around you brother and brother isaac man we've got a just something about your family amen amen we remember young little anna when she was floating brother all over the show there running all around there amen and now she's a petite young lady god bless you young where's david young david amen we saw you going through your your challenging times but it was just something about you that were laid on our hearts and we thank god amen that we could have had a part amen in what god is doing in your home we really appreciate the family shannon we really appreciate you all we're just so happy to be here this morning so we just want to uh i was eyeing that door there when i walked up out of man i i can take a run a year it is just something about you know i remember remember when the lord told me to go and preach on the buses and it was in 1960 and and going onto the trains and preaching the gospel remember that first time standing in the train uh i had to preach god told me to go and preach the gospel on the train and and the guys were sitting there playing cards you know the trains back in south africa's not like the trains here guys were playing cards and guys were shooting dice and i had to go and interrupt that and talk about jesus man i was standing at the standing there and i i knew i had to and i was being i was i was putting this off for a couple of weeks now but i knew that morning and now i was traveling by train now the strain hops you know from the one station to the other and i jumped the train jumped off and i jumped the other train going that away and that particular morning i stood there fearful fear i've never preached in the train and that's why i felt right now sitting there my stomach is all knotted and you just don't get used to coming behind this pulpit just scary because you implies that you're going to be you're going to be answerable to every word that you preach from behind the school but so when i saw that door open there and i i looked i just gave one look to the deacon i knew and he directed me this way not that way but it's uh it's an honor privilege and brother brother ben you've never been to brother malcolm's have you you've been to us did they serve you lobster did they serve your lobster then you better go there brother if you haven't had lobster and cray and kai from there you better go up there because they're malcolm they serve the whole one brother we we've had some tremendous times with brother malcolm and i just said to him last night yesterday i said brother we need to get to move on we need to get this this is just beautiful having the believers together this is this is just this is amen just beautiful to be together as believers amen and the enemy knew what it did brother to bring little things in between amen and and and while we are fighting one another he's just lying back with a cigarette dropping lying on his back sunbathing while we are killing one another but may god help us amen hallelujah so uh all that is done so can we just stand to our feet as i just read a scripture what time brother ben what time do you serve lunch one one no no i'll try and stick to that i'm looking for 10 minutes just 10 minutes can we can we just turn to psalm 94 my we we had some tremendous ministries yesterday morning and last night and wow it was just uh it was just so tremendous amen and as i looked at these young men mind it was just you know you can call it holy pride every such thing is holy pride but i just felt so proud of these young men amen as they ministered the gospel of jesus christ why there's just something about when you look at your kids and your family and you look at them ministering the gospel you you just your heart just swell with pride amen and thanksgiving of what god has done so yeah i really really was blessed yesterday as i minister the word so psalm 94 we just want to read a few scriptures verse 14 from verse 14 for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance how am i that that should make us shout amen for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance but judgment shall return unto the righteous and all the upright in heart shall follow it verse 16 who will rise up for me against the evil doers or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity unless the lord had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in silence almost dwelt in silence when i said my foot slippeth thy mercy o lord held me up can we just pray father we've read your word and we are just so thankful father for the beautiful atmosphere the liberty we just feel the liberty amen that we can jump and we can run around a little bit and we want to pray this morning you know the needs we have come the third meeting lord and you have ministered to your people in a very very special way and lord i pray this morning help me just to say something that will help someone something that's relevant to the time and the age in which we are living and lord might your people be blessed the sick might be healed lord god those on the live streaming and my god listening in we just pray that even they might be blessed knowing that what has been gonna be said this morning might not be relevant to anyone here but somewhere out there lord god because otherwise you never would have given us a word like this for this morning so i just want to pray that you will take over right now and shut my lips to anything i shouldn't say but what i ought to say will you say it my god as we just surrender and heal ourselves into your hands and care in jesus precious name amen god bless you and be seated this morning and the scripture that really stood out this morning is that one in verse 16 who will rise up for me against the evil doers or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity what our time and how we are living in it is ever a time that god needs men and women to stand up amen it is right now if you see the world in the way it's going amen the rights are now wrong and the wrongs are right amen and and you can decide what you want to be today if you want to be a woman today that's your world if you want to be a man today you can chop and change if we look at the hour we are living in then god is looking for men and women amen that can call wrong wrong and that can kill right call right right amen that's uh and and i want to say this morning to you that god never made a mistake amen when he when he chose you god never made a mistake brother when he elected you amen you may show to your birth where i'm where i do come from my family tree you you can show to all your upbringing your broken home you can show to your dysfunctional family amen you can show to your broken and messed up life but i want to declare this morning god don't make mistakes and my question this morning to you after reading verse 16 the question to you are you are you the one are you the one this morning that will be able to rise up and he say this morning god here am i i am making myself available amen so you can this morning decide if you are the one am i this morning talking to the right people hallelujah so we amen so we thank god psalm 139 can i read a few verses some 139 that will explain to you this morning why god don't make mistakes psalm 139 verses 14 says for thou has possessed my reigns for you did for my inward parts you did knit me together in my mother's womb i'm reading on the amplified bible i will confess and praise you lord for you are fearful and wonderful and for the awful wonder of my birth wonderful other works and that my inner self knows right well what david was saying he says lord i praise thee because how amazing thou has made me david is saying god i'm your masterpiece the enemy might not tell you that you might this morning not say that about yourself but david says god i am fearfully and wonderfully made amen hallelujah and that word fearfully translated from the hebrew means with great reverence god with great reverence heartfelt interest and with respect that's how god has his thoughts about me and you hallelujah oh my and then the bible speaks about that word wonderful means unique set apart realizing you are the only one of his kind you are the only one of your kind when god made you brother he chucked away the mold amen only one person has got my fingerprints [Music] they reckon brother that the snowflakes not one of them are the same that's the god i serve [Applause] that's the god i serve amen hallelujah that you are unique and set apart being the only one of his kind unlike anything else you are without parallel this is who you are hallelujah amen my frame david says in verse 15 was not hidden from you when i was being formed in secret david says intricately and curiously wrought as if embroidered with various colors in the depth of the earth a region of darkness and mystery brother we never knew what went on when that baby was formed in the mother a region of darkness and mystery and god said david said god you saw my unformed substance and in your book all the days of my life were written before ever they took shape in that nothing nothing nothing nothingness god hallelujah form saw my substance hallelujah before there was a nothing nothing nothing god saw my substance unformed how can satan ever change the program of god that was designed in eternity and now he want to change the program of god in time never [Applause] never [Applause] never will the enemy defend or defeat the purpose of god your life my life brother is ordained of god me being here dazzle said this place was designed and built because his bride was going to gather you this testify of the mind and the greatness of god hallelujah oh my he says and in your book all the days of my life were written before ever they took shape when as yet there was a none of them now david looks at that whole picture and he says how precious and witty also are your thoughts to me oh god how vast of the some of them rather i tell you weekend this morning say boo devil [Applause] you can never ever change god's thoughts concerning me no matter how many times you fail no matter how many mistakes you make in life you can never ever change the mind of god concerning you hallelujah so god didn't make a mistake brother when he chose me man my life was a mess but i think that god didn't make no mistake hallelujah if i had the power you had the power amen when we saw what we look like so if we had the power many of us would want to change what we look like and who we are and our upbringing and our homes and where do we come from in the family tree but brother with your human failures and your frailties if you read the bible you'll never you won't find not one perfect person every every prophet every person that god used had human failures hallelujah so what about me and you we would change if things in our lives maybe you're comfortable with your hair or being bald or stupid not comfortable so we would want to change that amen but brother i can this morning say god found no fault with my design no fault with my design with all my failures with all my humanness god chose you [Applause] not because we have the right qualities but because of his choice [Music] brother bannon says a little quote in the infallibility of god's spoken word he says jacob was a wanderer jacob was a wanderer yet in the promise jacob was a wanderer and yet he was in the promise this guy that was a con man this guy that was a liar a rogue this guy brother and maybe we wouldn't want in the church but he was in the promise [Applause] he was in the promise brother oh my brother and and and the bible brother bam says and god was with him [Applause] he just robbed this blind daddy of his blessing of his brother of his blessing he lied he deceived his old daddy and yet god says god was with him [Music] genesis 28 15 the bible says and behold i am with you this is what god's saying about jacob and behold i am with thee and i will keep thee in all places whether thou goest for i will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee you mean jacob when he was doing all his shady deals god was with him god said if you turn left i'll be with you when you turn right i'll be with you brother when you rob laban of his livestock god says i will be with you brother blame says god protected not jacob but the seed [Applause] so here what jacob running he's just did a bad deal and he's running and yeah brother brahm says he was nightfall the bible says nightfall and now jacob was tired and he was going to have a nap and god and brother had now noticed jacob he fell into a trance god was talking to his servant his servant the man that lied the man that stole the man that connived and god now says i'm talking to my servant jacob so brother it's time that we rise up man [Music] we rise our brother hallelujah god is not looking this morning church at your state your stake me right down there but is looking at your standing who you are ordained predestinated son of god [Music] god was not talking to his servant because in his servant not because he was righteous but because god had made a promise and brother blam says look at the way jacob got it look at the way jacob got the promise oh my that's why i often say to the church i says if we look at the life of david what he did and how he lived would we ever have that young man as our pastor would you ever choose david as your pastor none of us would they but god god look beyond the failure frailties of of david look beyond that and he looked at david and he says as a man after my own heart a man brother of them david had a heart of confession david had a heart of beings i'm sorry that's a heart that david had hallelujah brother brother bam says he wasn't righteous but because god has made a promise he says look at the way jacob got it but god had made a promise and god had to keep it in the loins of jacob laid the blessed righteous seed that must come forth from there in jacob lied that seed as we heard last night about joseph amen son of prosperity joseph typing christ and joseph had to come from the loins of jacob and when jacob was doing all those shady deals the seed of god was in him already hallelujah and brother bam says according he says that righteous blessed righteous seed that must come from him there according to isaac his father which had been promised through abraham and in jacob's loins was the seed laying there and the prophet of god said not because he deserved it but because god had promised it not because you and i got it right not because something that you had done but god has given you that same kind of a promise unconditional not what i have done or you have done but what god has done what god has ordained me to be hallelujah so stop looking at your failures stop looking at your faults stop looking at your shortcomings look at the promise that god gave you you are special hallelujah oh my [Applause] i've been there brother when you want to give up i've been there when you want to take your own life i've been there when you look at your human failures and you look at the word what the word requires and you find i don't match up to this i don't match up to the word and the enemy want to keep you focused on that your rottenness your meanness you did this you did that we were brother the bible declares that we were predestinated in christ in christ that's where we were you young people you know the battles you fight i'm a pastor i know the battles our young people fight i deal with him and the enemy lies to our young people shows you to your faults and failures but let me tell you something this morning if there's ever a scratching in your heart your desire for god cherish it cherish it it's it's it's got no price that desire for god hallelujah you've been singing some tremendous songs this weekend you're a miracle we're miracles we're miracles this morning that you are here at these special meetings young man you are a miracle you sing the song about uh you cho i think you chose me or something and i was sitting there i thought god to think that you chose me to be a bearer of this light to carry the world you chose me knowing my mistakes knowing all the things that will happen i said in feeling i said on sunday as is god when god called moses to take israel out of egypt and the next destination was the promised land god did not tell moses about the bitter waters at mara he didn't tell moses about the red sea he didn't tell moses when those people mum were going to murmur he didn't tell them nothing of that sort all he said you're taking them out and you're taking them in neither did god tell me and you brother hallelujah when he wrote i you come from we normally quote that i come from god and i go back to god but the in between the in between brother hallelujah you are gonna write the detail yourself of that walk and in that walk you're gonna have some peaks and you're gonna have some lows in that walk brother you're gonna lay before god why why am i so weak but you gonna write it hallelujah it's bound to happen it's bound it is anybody that's sitting here that's an angel let your wings down because some of us are sitting here as if we are so perfect some of us are sitting here as you've never done anything wrong since we serve the lord i ain't talking to you [Applause] i'm talking to those that make mistakes i'm talking to those that want to give up i'm talking to those are the ones that sit and look at me with your angel wing spread rather you don't know while your wings your wings are going to be beaten into shape by the trials of life i'm 83 years old so you can talk to me a little bit about some roads i traveled were you unsaved i was saved i was a believer when i made some rational decisions i was a believer now i'm saying that to my shame but that was my learning curves that's how i learned don't go there don't go there don't young men don't find yourself in a very uncompromising situation steer clear stay away you can never ever the bible says sit with coals or fire in your lap and you ain't gonna get burnt you can never ever sit with butter in your lap next to a fire and it says it's not going to melt so stay clear don't see how close you can go to the edge steer clear steer clear stay away [Applause] i sat with him and i spoke to them and i worked with him steer clear stay on the safe side stay within the confines of the world brother how do you do that romans 8 13 [Music] if you live according to the flesh you're gonna die but if you allow the holy ghost allow the holy ghost to mortify the deeds of the body you will live that scripture to me is so personal because i've been there i've been a young man i grew up amen praise the lord and i faced issues you face issues you can't control your emotions [Music] how do i keep myself how do i watch that i don't get entangled by the word and i went from church to church you see the innermost tryings the innermost battles you hate yourself you say lord change my nature you hate yourself you're in the prayer line every meeting they shake you they stomp on you they twist you they throw you on your back because you desire to be delivered [Music] you desire to be free you desire to come to church and raise your hands when you have walked wrong when you've become a miss the enemy will tell you you ain't got no right to lift your hands that's why many of our christians can't lift their hands because the enemy has trapped them somewhere along the way [Applause] and i went brother i wanted that power to overcome self wanted the power to overcome to be able to say no so i didn't mind them twisting my neck i didn't mind them stomping and sitting with their knee on my back i wanted power from god [Music] develop a life of holiness and while i was crying to god god just turned my attention to romans chapter 8 13. i said god is it that easy yeah they almost busted my back you almost now you know the pentecostal people many they can turn you upside down they turn you upside down and they'll shake you or shake all that cigarettes out of your pockets brother they'll shake you all those illicit things that you keep in your pocket they'll turn you upside down and they'll shake you until all those things that matches and everything that you're trying to hide lies on the floor in front of the deacon he says now you're ready for prayer [Applause] now you really will pray [Applause] hallelujah i said to dazul yesterday when i saw the prayer line and the time that he spent in praying for those souls i says that's the way that's the way not the quick and the easy way and just no no no no i remember those years hallelujah remember those years brother when we prayed for the sick and the needy brother those there was so much power the guys coming to the altar they take their back pocket half jacks of brandy and small dog wine and brandy they come to the altar and they just start pulling they see out of their pockets and putting it at the altar man those are the days those were the days by malcolm when we we wept with them we cried with them we stayed with them until they broke through [Applause] rather you will only know the pain that guy is going through when you walk in issues many of these drugs have been on drugs you can't tell them i know what you're going through if you have not smoking the pipe within you'll only know that when you have felt the pain i spoke to all one a couple of years back i spoke to a young girl having a tremendous meetings and the power of god that you came out and normally i tell them when you give your life to the lord this and this and this and this i'm not telling them the skies will be blue i'm not telling them the birds is going to sing i'm not telling the day is going to be different tomorrow than it is now and i told this young lady what the word demands and after i spoke to our asia do you still want to give your life to the lord jesus no prices yes walked away and it was two years when i saw again but this time she was bedraggled this time you can see life is treated to mean she came to the old and she and i asked are you ready now yes [Applause] i've and they come seen in the bin and they lie at the altar and when they walk away from there you see a puddle of tears lying there that was no dry eyed confession i think we many times have too much dried eyed i think many times we don't get to get the believers to to the cross to calvary we get them rather to the message no problem with that but get them to the message after you've taken them to the cross get them then to the message after you've taken them to calvary because there's a way back to god from the dark parts of sun there's a door that is open that you can go in and cover his cross that's where you begin when you come as a sinner to jesus hallelujah and i think that's the reason why we have so much battles and young people walking away because they never met christ [Applause] they never had an experience the realities of god when god becomes real to you [Music] where did i go but i want to tell you this morning church i've been there i've seen but i can tell you through this morning young people get to romans 8 13. if you live according to the flesh you're gonna die but if you buy the holy ghost morty the holy ghost mortify the deeds of the body that mortified word means kill kill it hallelujah oh my so brother braham says to this promise not because you got it right not because you had it all together brother not because of that he gave it to you on the same basis he gave jacob the promise by his grace the prophet of god says don't let nobody tell you that any kind of move in the world can ever interfere with god's great cog i read that again don't let no devil in hell tell you oh my of any kind of attack or any kind of move in the world can ever interfere with god's great cog she's moving right on brothertas amen there's nothing yet gone can nullify the prob the plan of god he says it was planned back there in the beginning your me us planned right back in the beginning so brother there is nothing nothing nothing let me tell you this morning there is nothing nothing nothing can change god's program concerning your life and my life he says it was planned back there from the beginning and there ain't a devil or enough devils can interfere with this program hallelujah so this morning i trust i'm talking to the right group this morning but i'm talking to the esther group this morning if i perish i perish but i'm rising up this morning hallelujah rising up and you might say to me this morning brother i would like to rise up but you know i'm nothing i want to tell you this morning church in your own eyes you might have nothing much to offer but if you this morning want to put your shoulder to the wagon and want to push it uphill because normally you find very few that want to push the wagon uphill but when the wagon gets up at the top everybody want to jump on for a free ride but god wants people to push the wagon [Music] put your shoulder to the wheel here in wellington put your shoulder to the wheel and say i am not here for the ride i'm here to help [Applause] even if it means just being the doormat [Applause] and written on the doormat is welcome that's all i want to be god will bless you god bless you hallelujah oh my oh help the community where you live god don't want us to feed the multitude we just want us to bring what you have the bread and the fishes that's all they want you to bring just bring that that's all you got your voices your talents give it and you see how god can use that to feed the multitude you can see how god can use that gift brother hallelujah and let the church move on hallelujah oh my oh you're the one are you the one so you might come from a home of a bunch of drunkards drug addicts maybe your mom and your dad have told you you won't amount to nothing i i can tell you that's what they told me you won't amount to nothing that's what they told me and i felt like that nothing oh my but because of that seed because of that seed hallelujah you start moving with those kind of guys you start living that you know what andy we're talking about now you start moving with those guys because somebody told you you'll amount to nothing somebody told you you're just like your dad like your mom you're just like them so you can't amount too much and brother i tell you about something that seed hallelujah i did to defy i dared to defy what they said when i really realized what this thing is doing that they put on me you want to rock mountain nothing that's the reason why our young people don't want don't want to go and do something worthwhile study plant your potatoes young man the other day what are you going to do when you're done in this stop he said no i wanna i wanna i wanna i wanna work on the building this is man there's nothing wrong working on the building some tremendous guys working on the building but brother if you've got something here then use it go study you're going to marry one day you're going to marry one day right you young guys you're going to marry one day you know when a guy brother came to ask my daughter i sent him back three times [Applause] you parents i just want to get rid of your kids shame on you [Applause] shame on you those young men they were holy ghostballed young men and they came and they asked my daughter i looked at him i said and he was an asset i said go pray again and he came back and i said go pray again three times i've got three daughters okay and so one day my eldest daughter my pastor of that time came with this young man to my home and he uh want to speak to me and he brought my pastor and he brought his pastor to come and talk to me about my daughter you didn't want to know me then oh no sir no say this this this guy many of my kids tell me dad why is ultimate why is so weak those years i say brother you don't want to take me go back there and so this brother came and would be my pastor and his pastor and he came and his mother and uh of course i want to talk about my daughter and i i i listened to them i politely listened to them and and my pastor dared to tell me don't play so hard to get say what this guy want to come with my daughter and you my pastor want to tell me i mustn't play hard to get i'm he's a good guy he's well he's well organized he's got his own home he's a he's menacing in the church and and he's a good guy i said bro i read this child i laid on my face before god for her to be in the state and you just want to walk in here with my pastor and your pastor and your mother and your father and one try and put pressure on me yes sir yes sir yes sir don't play around when it comes to my daughters i can't handle i can't handle dads as you want to palm their daughters off i can't handle that my my my kids mustn't talk so loud 27 years old and that young man came walking into my own this young man sitting here [Music] [Applause] came walking into my home he want my daughter and i gave him a look because my son's already freddie and glenn already told him how to how to go about how to go about this whole this whole courtship thing but god you know so i and and every one of my daughters brother and i and i told him also he is he's suffering that he is today part of the family now we've got a culture back in africa called the ebola system that dowry system and i told him the day of his wedding i told him this young man he's going to pay dowry for the rest of his life and he is he's still paying after how many years 17 20 odd years still paying for the rest of his life so man we are too quick in getting or getting our daughters out of the house [Music] and then you got no idea have you ever found the pastor where this young man come from maybe not in your church another church have you ever found the pastor to find yet give a character sketch of that young man has he got the holy ghost does he pay tithes we're just so hard to get rid of our daughters and that's the reason why brother and sister my my son and my other two son-in-laws they're all ministering this gospel or ministering this gospel because i'm the watchman i was a watchman on the towers i'm a watchman on the tower so if you've got any young girls that are manageable age i tell come and amy my granddaughters i telcom and amy show me your room show me your room

son how is that look parents will never speak the truth about their sons or their daughters never talk to the pastors and hear from them and if things go wrong you've got somebody that you can go to you said he's okay you said she's okay and i'm going to tell you our sisters in our church have a bar they have a bar so high because i by the grace of god we teach them dominarity don't just grab and don't just say yes let them come and talk to me yeah no so that's just that was free that was that's that's free amen so brother let me tell you this morning no matter what your parents have told you you will amount to nothing you are different you are different to the rest of the clan and you don't have to find a hole and jump in there and hide because somebody told you you won't amount nothing
