[53:58] well and restore his health father For
[54:00] Your Glory we thank you Lord in Jesus
[54:02] Christ's name amen amen amen God bless
[54:05] your friends you may have your seats
[54:07] this morning so as I'm saying I want to
[54:09] talk about humility I think it's very
[54:10] important we um we we remember what the
[54:13] Lord spoke to us uh on Sunday
[54:16] and so Kristen and I went through the
[54:18] transcript to went back and forth to get
[54:20] what was said and the Lord said thus
[54:22] saith the Lords this is last Sunday who
[54:23] was here on Sunday who remembers this
[54:25] right so I think we should revisit this
[54:27] because we don't just want to let it go
[54:29] and say that was amazing and forget
[54:30] about it right so she says thus saith
[54:32] the Lord my word came forth in this
[54:34] place when you began if you keep humble
[54:35] before me my word will continue to come
[54:38] it will find souls and they'll find rest
[54:40] what a commission that we have amen that
[54:43] is why I have called you today
[54:46] uh to Humble thyself again before me
[54:48] there are souls that need my rest
[54:52] they you must be humble you must be
[54:54] humble before me and they shall find
[54:56] their rest I have not left
[54:59] amen so we want to keep this very much I
[55:02] think burned in our hearts they're Souls
[55:04] that need the rest of God the baptism of
[55:07] the Holy Ghost amen and I believe even
[55:09] in this room right now there's Souls
[55:10] here that I'm speaking to that need rest
[55:12] amen but it's not just enough just to
[55:15] come to church be part of a gathering we
[55:17] must know him in the power of his
[55:18] resurrection but you see the devil is
[55:21] the opposite of of humility he is proud
[55:23] he was lifted up we as we read there
[55:25] that is uh thy uh his heart was lifted
[55:28] up because of his Beauty and it's
[55:30] amazing how someone can be lifted up
[55:31] above what God has made them to be but
[55:33] we see that Satan you know he is the
[55:36] anointed cherub that covereth he was the
[55:38] actually controlled access to God to the
[55:40] other angels and you know but he got
[55:42] lifted up above what God made him
[55:44] instead of walking humility saying thank
[55:45] you Lord you've made me thus because
[55:47] really we should be satisfied with
[55:49] whatever part of the body we're of you
[55:50] know it doesn't matter if we're you know
[55:52] if I never preach another sermon in my
[55:53] life I still love the Lord you know I'm
[55:55] not a Christian because I'm a preacher
[55:57] or a pastor that's got nothing to do
[55:58] with it I'm a Christian because he found
[56:00] me redeemy buys blood-saving by his
[56:02] grace amen I just love him all the days
[56:04] of my life because he's been so good to
[56:06] me amen
[56:08] so I bet you see Satan got lifted up you
[56:10] know he was lifted up because of his
[56:12] Beauty and all these things and then his
[56:14] own because of that his own wisdom
[56:16] corrupted him where where he left his
[56:19] first estate he caused all the angels to
[56:21] fall amen and then now we find that this
[56:23] pride is not just stuck in a devil but
[56:26] it comes into human beings and it's the
[56:28] biggest problem upon the Earth is pride
[56:30] amen the reason why America is doing
[56:33] what it's doing is because of Pride I
[56:34] mean the reason China's doing what it's
[56:36] doing is because of Pride it's the
[56:38] reason that you know the whole nations
[56:39] are doing what they're doing fighting
[56:40] scrapping letting Devils control them is
[56:43] because of Pride but if we can humble
[56:45] ourselves before the hand of almighty
[56:47] God Amen we can let the Lord take
[56:49] control of Our Lives see it's amazing
[56:51] when you look at you know
[56:53] it says in First Peter 5 here likewise
[56:55] you're younger submit yourselves into
[56:56] the Elder yay all of you be subject one
[56:59] to another and be clothed with humility
[57:01] that means that humility should be your
[57:03] garment amen shouldn't be Pride or
[57:05] arrogance your self-sufficiency or you
[57:07] know we're not here to play games right
[57:09] we're not here to play political games
[57:11] with one another manipulate with
[57:12] emotions different things no we're here
[57:14] to serve the Lord amen so we've got to
[57:16] be clothed with humility for God
[57:18] resisteth the proud and giveth grace to
[57:21] the humble now if you think about your
[57:23] grace we know in the Bible in New
[57:25] Testament language it's a Divine
[57:26] influence upon the heart and Its
[57:28] Reflection on uh in the life that's what
[57:30] new testament Grace means amen so he
[57:33] gives a Divine influence upon your heart
[57:35] and it's reflected in your life if
[57:37] you're humble amen who wants a Divine
[57:39] influence of the Holy Ghost his word to
[57:41] live in you amen and it's reflected out
[57:43] of your life so it's not just a you know
[57:45] we don't just walk around saying Thank
[57:46] You Lord but there's a power that comes
[57:48] into our lives that he manifests his
[57:50] word through us you know we're not
[57:51] helpless you know you're the most
[57:53] powerful people in existence the Bride
[57:55] of Jesus Christ amen God God can take a
[57:59] person remember that same God that said
[58:00] let there be sun moon and stars and you
[58:03] know and your man's put the James Wood
[58:04] telescope out there and is marveling at
[58:06] creation you know and the universes and
[58:08] everything and you know that same power
[58:10] that said let there be sun moon and
[58:12] stars comes and dwells and redeems Sons
[58:14] and Daughters of God and that creative
[58:16] power is still in existence you know the
[58:19] devil wants to be able to create but he
[58:21] cannot create so all he can do is
[58:23] pervert because he was perverted in his
[58:25] heart in the beginning and that
[58:26] perversions come down upon human beings
[58:28] amen but we're not here to be perverted
[58:30] amen we're here to be Sons and Daughters
[58:33] of God made in the image of God that God
[58:35] can take your vocal cords and speak a
[58:37] word of life to someone and someone
[58:39] who's even dead can come back to life
[58:41] again sickness can be gone amen The
[58:43] Impossible can be manifested amen
[58:45] because God takes over a life
[58:47] oh that's for the preacher no that's for
[58:49] every man woman and child that's fully
[58:51] surrendered to God that has the baptism
[58:53] of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so God
[58:55] gives grace to the humble and this is a
[58:57] day of great grace amen where where
[59:00] Zechariah would see it as a as a vision
[59:02] of the Capstone coming down this
[59:04] shouting's Grace Grace unto it I mean so
[59:07] as Christ comes down unites himself with
[59:09] a body there's a shouting of Grace Grace
[59:10] why this magnified Grace amen this sure
[59:14] there's a lot of evil in the world Hells
[59:15] opens opened itself up upon the Earth
[59:18] but remember God is always greater than
[59:19] what what anything the devil can do so
[59:22] all of the armies of hell it's like it's
[59:23] not just a part of the armies of Hell
[59:25] have come upon the Earth all that he is
[59:27] and his reserves and his militia and his
[59:30] Home Guard every man woman and child
[59:32] well I'm talking Devils now but
[59:34] basically everyone who can bear a gun
[59:36] has come out of hell is upon the
[59:38] battlefield I mean so he's not just
[59:39] sending a little Skirmish and a little
[59:41] scouting party and some special forces
[59:43] all of his artilleries here all of his
[59:45] arm is here all of his weapons are here
[59:47] but remember greater is he that's in you
[59:49] there's he that's in the world Amen
[59:51] Grace he is in you there's that all of
[59:54] hellers Amen you know one man a woman
[59:56] with God is the majority amen we don't
[59:59] need you sure there's power and numbers
[1:00:01] of Faith being joined together and you
[1:00:03] know we understand all those things but
[1:00:05] even if you feel alone you're still the
[1:00:07] majority with God I mean Moses was one
[1:00:09] man he went down to the superpower of
[1:00:11] the age amen took a children of Israel
[1:00:13] out of Egypt amen one man did it
[1:00:15] Hallelujah now how about you and I today
[1:00:18] amen remember he was just under the
[1:00:20] blood of bulls and goats amen and yet he
[1:00:22] could create flies and fleas and bring
[1:00:24] Darkness into all kinds of things
[1:00:26] because why he was fully surrendered to
[1:00:29] God he walked in humility he was once
[1:00:31] The Prince of Egypt walking in Pride and
[1:00:33] look who I am but God humbled him 40
[1:00:36] years in the desert and when he really
[1:00:37] met guy the burning bush he realized he
[1:00:40] was nothing but it's about God takes
[1:00:42] nothing and makes it into something amen
[1:00:44] so it's very important we reckon
[1:00:46] ourselves that we are nothing
[1:00:48] now that's not enough feeling sorry pity
[1:00:51] party woe is me I'm just never going to
[1:00:54] amount to a hill of beans that's not
[1:00:55] what I'm talking about amen but it's
[1:00:57] recognizing that without him you can do
[1:01:00] nothing amen as the Lord would even say
[1:01:02] here he says I am the vine and yeah the
[1:01:04] branches he that abideth in me and I and
[1:01:07] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:01:08] for without me ye can do nothing
[1:01:12] I like that kind of scripture because I
[1:01:14] realize actually the the you know
[1:01:16] remember God proves his word
[1:01:19] we don't prove his word god proves his
[1:01:22] word we don't have to make his word be
[1:01:24] fulfilled he fulfills his word in our
[1:01:26] lives but we're going to be surrendered
[1:01:28] to his word for it to be fulfilled so
[1:01:31] without him I can do nothing that's fine
[1:01:32] because that means the life and
[1:01:34] everything's gonna come from him through
[1:01:36] me and do what and he'll do what he
[1:01:38] wants to do so that takes a lot of
[1:01:40] pressure off because you know man wants
[1:01:42] to always try and prove himself
[1:01:43] proof of his ability prove how smart he
[1:01:46] is prove how clever he is prove how
[1:01:49] eloquent he is prove how much Charisma
[1:01:51] he may have or a talent or whatever but
[1:01:53] that doesn't work with the kingdom of
[1:01:54] God no God proves his word amen God
[1:01:58] proves his word in our lives they say
[1:02:00] Lord prove your word manifest your word
[1:02:02] Lord I without you I can do nothing
[1:02:04] remember the life the life comes from
[1:02:06] the vine into the branches amen and
[1:02:08] brother Ram said that if the if the vine
[1:02:11] ever puts forth another Branch it will
[1:02:12] write another book of Acts amen because
[1:02:15] every bronzer one ever puts forth amen
[1:02:17] writes a book of Acts behind in a
[1:02:19] supernatural testimony of the word of
[1:02:21] God being manifested
[1:02:23] Hallelujah
[1:02:25] amen see says humble yourselves
[1:02:28] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[1:02:30] that he may exalt you in due time
[1:02:32] casting all your care upon him for he
[1:02:34] careth for you be sober be vigilant
[1:02:37] because your adversary the Devil is a
[1:02:38] roaring lion walking walketh about
[1:02:40] seeking whom he may devour whom resist
[1:02:44] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[1:02:46] same afflictions are accomplished in
[1:02:47] your brethren that are in the world but
[1:02:50] the God of all Grace who hath called us
[1:02:52] unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus
[1:02:55] after that ye have suffered a while make
[1:02:57] you perfect establish strengthen and
[1:03:00] settle you I like that amen you're going
[1:03:02] through an Affliction well the whole
[1:03:04] purpose after a while you're going to be
[1:03:05] made perfect you're going to be
[1:03:07] established you're going to be
[1:03:08] strengthened you're going to be settled
[1:03:09] amen so remember before something's ever
[1:03:12] established it kind of moves around a
[1:03:13] bit you know tossing turn for a
[1:03:16] reasoning worry emotion trouble but
[1:03:18] after a while you just become Rock Solid
[1:03:19] in the word of God God said it I believe
[1:03:22] it that settles it praise the Lord hey
[1:03:26] man you get strengthened I mean because
[1:03:27] you realize that your human ability
[1:03:29] cannot give you strength cannot keep you
[1:03:31] walking this walk but then God pours in
[1:03:33] his strength why because he gives grace
[1:03:35] to the humble amen then you're settled
[1:03:38] why don't you sit alone that the word is
[1:03:40] true every promise is mine amen God is a
[1:03:43] god of his word amen
[1:03:45] Hallelujah
[1:03:47] Hallelujah you see now
[1:03:49] we must fight for humility
[1:03:52] right we must we must fight for humility
[1:03:54] we're not here to fight for it because
[1:03:57] remember the whole purpose of us being
[1:03:58] here is that souls are added to the
[1:04:00] kingdom remember brother Bram told us
[1:04:02] that we should be prayerfully seeking
[1:04:04] the lost that the last one can come in
[1:04:06] that we can go home
[1:04:08] that should be our whole life subjective
[1:04:10] sure we need careers we'll have family
[1:04:13] we'll do different kind of things but
[1:04:14] underpinning all of that is Lord bring
[1:04:17] your sheep here bring your children that
[1:04:19] they can meet you they can know you they
[1:04:21] can fall in love with you that we can go
[1:04:23] home who wants to go home there's no
[1:04:25] place like home
[1:04:26] amen so you know and when I'm talking
[1:04:28] about home as heaven right we should
[1:04:30] have such a longing Lord I want to see
[1:04:32] you as you are I want to be caught up in
[1:04:34] a I want to be translated in a moment of
[1:04:36] a twinkling of an eye and see you face
[1:04:38] to face Hallelujah that should be our
[1:04:40] hearts cry more than anything else you
[1:04:43] see because there's Jude would Jude
[1:04:45] would speak about we must con earnestly
[1:04:47] contend for the faith which was once
[1:04:49] delivered unto the Saints now that's
[1:04:51] just not the just the right correct
[1:04:53] Doctrine we know that's part of it right
[1:04:55] but it's more than that we've got to
[1:04:56] contend for a walk of humility I mean a
[1:04:59] walk that we're not selfish it's not us
[1:05:01] being puffed up or Pride you know we
[1:05:03] must contend against those things I mean
[1:05:05] we must contend against any man exalting
[1:05:08] himself above another man I mean we must
[1:05:10] contend against manipulation and
[1:05:12] politics and all this nonsense that goes
[1:05:14] on we must contend against those things
[1:05:16] because if we contend for the faith
[1:05:19] we're contending for God dwelling in a
[1:05:21] people once again Amen robed in humility
[1:05:24] walking in meekness I mean amen walking
[1:05:26] according to his word
[1:05:28] Hallelujah that's what we should that's
[1:05:30] what we should be doing this morning
[1:05:33] I mean because remember a man fully
[1:05:35] surrendered to God is omnipotent right
[1:05:37] all powerful and we'll get to that but I
[1:05:38] want to build around that because you're
[1:05:40] going to realize the power that lays
[1:05:41] within you
[1:05:42] but it's not you that operates that
[1:05:44] power it's God that operates that power
[1:05:46] amen it's God that anoints his word in
[1:05:48] our lives amen but we've got to be
[1:05:50] surrendered to the Lord that whenever he
[1:05:52] wants to he can
[1:05:55] amen remember it's humility remember if
[1:05:57] God resists the prayer but gives grace
[1:05:59] to the humble right so so if we're
[1:06:01] humble then we can come boldly before us
[1:06:04] thrown in time of need right we can come
[1:06:06] bold but if we're proud thinking we've
[1:06:08] got it all together you know if someone
[1:06:10] thinks they epitomize Christianity you
[1:06:12] know one thing they don't
[1:06:14] you know it's quite simple if they think
[1:06:16] man I've made it you know I'm a I'm an
[1:06:18] adopted son of God and I can do it all
[1:06:20] myself and I know what I'm doing you
[1:06:21] know one thing they have no idea
[1:06:24] they have no idea
[1:06:26] see the Lord Jesus never exalted himself
[1:06:28] like that
[1:06:30] he was surrendered to the father
[1:06:32] right he was surrendered to the word of
[1:06:35] God he knew exactly who he was but
[1:06:38] didn't make him proud
[1:06:40] he didn't walk around saying look I made
[1:06:42] this whole thing
[1:06:44] I'm gonna wipe this off I'm gonna do
[1:06:46] what I'll do it nice is he only did what
[1:06:48] the father showed him yeah
[1:06:49] right and that was to remember we want
[1:06:52] to be like Jesus today right so that's
[1:06:55] his attitude so we should have that same
[1:06:57] attitude
[1:07:00] amen humility is to have a humble
[1:07:02] opinion of oneself
[1:07:04] a deep sense of one's moral in Brackets
[1:07:07] littleness modesty humility Lawless of
[1:07:10] lowness of Mind loneliness of mind now
[1:07:14] as I said before that doesn't mean you
[1:07:15] walk around saying I'm nothing I'm
[1:07:17] worthless worthless worse worthless
[1:07:20] there we go we got there eventually you
[1:07:23] know I'm glad someone's listening he's
[1:07:24] not speaking just right you know praise
[1:07:26] the Lord you know we shouldn't walk
[1:07:28] around thinking we're useless and we're
[1:07:30] not important we are very important to
[1:07:32] God if Jesus died on Calvary for one he
[1:07:36] would have done it all the same amen if
[1:07:38] if the Rapture was for one so this
[1:07:40] message of rapturing Faith was for one
[1:07:42] he would have had brother Bram go
[1:07:44] through all of what he went through and
[1:07:46] brother bran would have went through it
[1:07:47] gladly that the word would have come
[1:07:49] open the lamb could take the book give
[1:07:50] it to an adopted son or Son of God that
[1:07:52] could be preached to you and then
[1:07:53] manifested in your life then you go home
[1:07:55] it was just for one he would have done
[1:07:57] it all for one amen so you're very
[1:07:59] important to God I mean you're not just
[1:08:01] a number you're not just a statistic
[1:08:03] you're not just a bunch of genes walking
[1:08:05] you know your jeans as in jeans DNA you
[1:08:08] know you're not just part of the gene
[1:08:09] pool right you're thinking clothing just
[1:08:12] for a second there but let's go beyond
[1:08:13] that right I'm talking about g-e-n-e
[1:08:15] Gene right amen
[1:08:18] we're very special to God you should
[1:08:21] feel special
[1:08:22] they feel special
[1:08:24] hey man you should feel special the Lord
[1:08:25] the Lord has done all things for you
[1:08:28] and it was only for you if heaven was
[1:08:31] literally you and God he would have done
[1:08:32] it all the same
[1:08:33] that's how much value he's put upon your
[1:08:36] soul
[1:08:37] amen so so when I talk about having a
[1:08:39] you know
[1:08:40] loneliness of mind
[1:08:42] you know I can't even kind of double
[1:08:44] guessing how I reach stuff now maybe I
[1:08:46] should go back to school anyway you know
[1:08:48] don't think you're useless and you're
[1:08:51] not important
[1:08:52] but you should say no God's word is more
[1:08:55] important than me what he says is more
[1:08:58] important than what I say what he thinks
[1:09:00] is more important than my opinion how he
[1:09:02] feels is more important than I feel
[1:09:04] right that's how we should that should
[1:09:07] be how our mind should be
[1:09:10] amen because he the Lord would say uh be
[1:09:13] not called uh but be not you called
[1:09:16] Rabbi for one is your master even Christ
[1:09:19] and all ye are Brethren hey Brethren how
[1:09:22] we doing
[1:09:23] hallelujah amen and call no man your
[1:09:26] father upon the Earth for one is your
[1:09:27] father which is in heaven neither be
[1:09:29] called Masters for one is your master
[1:09:31] even Christ but he that is greatest
[1:09:33] among you shall be your servant amen
[1:09:37] whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a
[1:09:39] base and he that shall humble himself
[1:09:41] shall be exalted amen and to me this uh
[1:09:44] to be exalted uh to me what it means is
[1:09:46] that you see the word of God living in
[1:09:49] power in your life you see the character
[1:09:51] of Christ manifested in your life you
[1:09:53] see the devil under your feet Amen to me
[1:09:55] that's being exalted because because
[1:09:57] remember when Adam and Eve fell then
[1:09:59] Satan became king of the Earth right and
[1:10:01] then they became slaves to sin and then
[1:10:04] sin nature ruled amen but then when but
[1:10:06] then when someone really humbles
[1:10:08] themselves as we heard about on
[1:10:09] Wednesday about really being born again
[1:10:11] when you're willing to let your
[1:10:13] Ambitions your habits your pride your
[1:10:17] ability what you think you are
[1:10:19] everything burn on the altar when you're
[1:10:21] willing to lay yourself completely lay
[1:10:23] down I mean you're willing to surrender
[1:10:25] everything because that's the thing I
[1:10:27] think the problem is we no this okay I
[1:10:29] better be careful how I say this people
[1:10:32] can be so blessed by the anointing of
[1:10:34] God
[1:10:35] and be anointed by God but still they're
[1:10:37] not born again
[1:10:38] and they can have great experiences but
[1:10:40] they're not born again they're just
[1:10:41] anointed all those things are God
[1:10:44] that's why I'm looking forward to Camp
[1:10:46] I'm looking forward to this service I'm
[1:10:48] looking forward to every service we're
[1:10:49] going to have a look forward to every
[1:10:50] time we can pray or you know God can
[1:10:51] anoint mightily but it takes a real
[1:10:54] death
[1:10:55] for the soul to come to life it takes a
[1:10:58] real death and we and and brother Ram
[1:11:00] says even Branham Tabernacle was afraid
[1:11:02] of the new birth how about Chicago
[1:11:04] Tabernacle are we afraid of the new
[1:11:06] birth Amen to try and bypass everything
[1:11:09] but to be born again see because unless
[1:11:11] you're born again you cannot see or
[1:11:13] understand the kingdom of God I mean we
[1:11:16] must be born again it's fundamentally
[1:11:17] important but until we're willing to lay
[1:11:19] ourselves upon the Altar and die out to
[1:11:22] everything
[1:11:23] we'll get nothing
[1:11:25] you know so we want to we must be born
[1:11:29] again it's a it's an absolute must you
[1:11:31] have an experience where God changes
[1:11:33] your nature and desires amen that he
[1:11:36] changed it you see there's a change it's
[1:11:38] not just I was raising the message that
[1:11:40] means nothing that's like saying I live
[1:11:42] in a garage therefore I'm a car no
[1:11:43] you're not a car because you live in a
[1:11:45] garage right you got to be made a car to
[1:11:48] be a car right just like amen you're
[1:11:50] with me yeah see you so well I was I was
[1:11:53] raised here I was born in this church
[1:11:55] you know in a family that's got nothing
[1:11:56] to do with it you must be born again
[1:11:59] amen our our children do not become
[1:12:02] Believers just because they're raised in
[1:12:04] Christian homes sure that helps them a
[1:12:06] great big deal when they live in the
[1:12:07] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost but they
[1:12:09] must surrender themselves to the Lord
[1:12:11] and even many adults we need to have a
[1:12:14] new birth experience right it's not just
[1:12:16] well you become set in your ways that
[1:12:18] I'm a Christian now this is what I do
[1:12:19] don't just become sin in your ways let
[1:12:22] God burn out all sin nature and all
[1:12:24] those things that when Trouble Comes
[1:12:26] Grace comes out it's not fighting and
[1:12:29] fussing and and little schemes and
[1:12:30] manipulation all those things none of
[1:12:33] that comes out it's just God comes out
[1:12:34] things I mean that's what we want we
[1:12:36] don't want to have it just me and trying
[1:12:38] to have a lordship over someone control
[1:12:40] someone a certain way that's got to be
[1:12:42] gone that's that's Satan's uh what do
[1:12:45] you call it personality or or attributes
[1:12:47] and to human beings amen but we're not
[1:12:50] called to live with those things I
[1:12:52] remember but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:12:54] should exalt us over those things I mean
[1:12:56] we're placed above sin nature amen that
[1:12:59] is not just us trying to cope with
[1:13:00] problems but they're burnt out of our
[1:13:02] Lives I believe in a cleansing fire of
[1:13:04] God Amen that really burns out all
[1:13:07] unbelief all sin nature all of those
[1:13:09] complexes pains and hurts it really
[1:13:11] Burns it out halleluia and I believe his
[1:13:14] Burning Flame is present amen because
[1:13:16] where he is he is a consuming fire
[1:13:19] Hallelujah so if you want to be exalted
[1:13:21] well let God lift you up be humble
[1:13:25] if you ought to be brought down
[1:13:27] exalt yourself
[1:13:29] look at me look who I am I'm the I'm the
[1:13:32] number one here I'm the Kingpin
[1:13:34] I'm the I'm the vital ingredient in the
[1:13:37] mix no the only vital ingredient is the
[1:13:40] Lord
[1:13:40] right because whatever man puts together
[1:13:42] just like you know with I think it was
[1:13:44] Elijah Elijah or the sons of the
[1:13:45] prophets from the school the prophets
[1:13:47] you know were making a pot of food and
[1:13:49] some got some poison gourds and put it
[1:13:51] into the pot you know this is man's
[1:13:53] doing let's mix this all together it
[1:13:54] just brought forth death I mean but the
[1:13:56] one thing that cured all of that was the
[1:13:58] meal offering it was the meal that the
[1:14:00] prophet put in which is Christ put into
[1:14:02] the pot and it brought forth life it's
[1:14:04] sustained so the main part of the mix is
[1:14:06] him
[1:14:07] right if man puts any of his own ability
[1:14:09] in it just causes death that's why
[1:14:12] Nature's falling God isn't causing
[1:14:14] nature to fall apart God isn't causing
[1:14:16] all these wars and troubles and famines
[1:14:18] and sorrows and pain that's Fallen man
[1:14:21] under control of a fallen devil
[1:14:24] yeah amen so it's not you know you say
[1:14:25] well there's going to be a nuclear war
[1:14:27] that's not God's fault
[1:14:30] people you know big disasters come
[1:14:32] through I remember the Christchurch
[1:14:33] earthquake you know they call it Christ
[1:14:35] Church but it's a Godless place just
[1:14:37] like the rest of this world then the
[1:14:39] earthquake happens and people like why
[1:14:41] did God let this happen why are you
[1:14:43] suddenly blaming God are you walking
[1:14:44] with them you know what's you know why
[1:14:46] is he sounding the fault what are you
[1:14:47] doing
[1:14:48] you know but that's the only time God
[1:14:50] ever comes into the public you know
[1:14:52] conversation has been saying bad happens
[1:14:53] oh we're going to blame somebody I'm not
[1:14:55] blaming me it's this guy you know we
[1:14:58] should never be that way
[1:15:00] but we should be we should be humble and
[1:15:04] know that he's in control of all things
[1:15:05] amen no brother that makes a statement
[1:15:08] in order to stay with God stay gentle
[1:15:10] who wants to stay with God today
[1:15:12] God is gentle in order to stay with God
[1:15:14] stay with love God is love stay Meek
[1:15:17] never be self-sufficient
[1:15:20] so in other words never take a thought
[1:15:22] that is contrary to the word of God and
[1:15:24] say I'm going to think this this is the
[1:15:25] right way to do it always rely upon him
[1:15:27] never use your own mind take his
[1:15:30] thoughts we say well how do I find his
[1:15:32] thoughts
[1:15:34] you know and I could hold up the message
[1:15:37] in the same token as well I mean let his
[1:15:39] thoughts be your thoughts that's a good
[1:15:41] idea and then take them into your car
[1:15:43] you just think about okay I'm sorry I'm
[1:15:45] harping on about the world but you think
[1:15:46] about what if the U.N took this quote
[1:15:49] and see this is going to be our Charter
[1:15:51] this is going to be our Charter for the
[1:15:53] world we're going to take God's thoughts
[1:15:55] and let them become our thoughts
[1:15:58] worldwide poverty is gone
[1:16:00] war is gone basically it's like a
[1:16:02] millennium would just come in mental
[1:16:04] health gone all the trouble in the world
[1:16:07] would just go if the world just said hey
[1:16:09] God what's your thoughts I want them to
[1:16:11] become my thoughts that you would live
[1:16:13] because remember if you really take
[1:16:15] honest thoughts you can't be a proud
[1:16:16] person amen you can't be proud if you've
[1:16:19] taken on a search you cannot be but
[1:16:21] humble
[1:16:23] Hallelujah let his thoughts be your
[1:16:26] thoughts take them into your car no mind
[1:16:27] repeat them over and say oh God take all
[1:16:30] of my doubt away let my thoughts be your
[1:16:32] thoughts and you sick people I do that
[1:16:34] as we're speaking just take away Cast
[1:16:36] Away the thought of sickness take God's
[1:16:39] healing thoughts let them become your
[1:16:40] thought think upon these things the
[1:16:43] Bible said if there be any praise if
[1:16:45] there be any virtue think on these
[1:16:48] things amen if you have trouble in your
[1:16:50] mind take his thoughts you'll find that
[1:16:52] those troubled thoughts are gone you
[1:16:54] know and then now what thoughts of Peace
[1:16:56] have come in you feel unloved think on
[1:16:59] his thoughts you'll feel loved if you
[1:17:01] don't feel part of a part of a family
[1:17:03] think on his thoughts you'll feel part
[1:17:05] of a family if you're feeling worth
[1:17:07] useless you've got no ability think on
[1:17:09] his thoughts you'll feel like yes the
[1:17:11] Lord's given me ability
[1:17:12] amen hallelujah it's a it's a good
[1:17:15] prescription I think
[1:17:17] Hallelujah
[1:17:18] amen now
[1:17:21] he says let this mind be in you which
[1:17:23] was also in Christ Jesus see you got to
[1:17:25] let it in
[1:17:27] God don't God don't mug you take out
[1:17:29] your thinking put us thinking in and say
[1:17:30] here you go you know enjoy that no we've
[1:17:33] got to let him we're going to yield
[1:17:36] you know and to me it's one of the most
[1:17:37] powerful things is the ability to yield
[1:17:39] to the word of God
[1:17:41] amen you say I don't have a gift well if
[1:17:43] you've got a gift to be able to yield to
[1:17:44] the word of God that's the greatest gift
[1:17:46] because God can do whatever he wants in
[1:17:48] your life you get surrendered to him in
[1:17:49] every situation amen let this mind be in
[1:17:52] you which is also in Christ Jesus who
[1:17:54] being in the form of God thought it not
[1:17:56] robbery to be equal with God but made
[1:17:58] himself of no reputation and took upon
[1:18:00] him the form of a servant it was made in
[1:18:02] the likeness of men and being found in
[1:18:04] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[1:18:07] became obedient unto death even the
[1:18:09] death of the Cross wherefore God also
[1:18:11] hath highly exalted him and given him a
[1:18:14] name which is above every name
[1:18:17] Hallelujah so so this is our example
[1:18:20] he made himself of no reputation he was
[1:18:23] the one who made sun moon and stars
[1:18:25] became flesh he could have he could have
[1:18:27] spoken a palace into existence and be
[1:18:29] birthed in the palace you know he could
[1:18:31] have had the best he could have had the
[1:18:33] best penthouse suite in in Jerusalem
[1:18:36] you know far beyond but he said foxes
[1:18:39] have dens birds have nests but the son
[1:18:40] of man has no place to lay us here
[1:18:42] here's a homeless man
[1:18:44] they're very God who made all things was
[1:18:45] homeless because he when he robed
[1:18:48] himself in humility now we don't have to
[1:18:50] become homeless to be humble
[1:18:52] but he surrendered himself
[1:18:54] to the word of God concerning him amen
[1:18:57] he knew that he had to be mad more than
[1:18:59] any other man he knew he was the Lamb of
[1:19:01] God take away the sin of the world he
[1:19:03] knew he'd be despised and rejected of
[1:19:05] man and man acquainted with grief and
[1:19:06] sorrow he knew that was his portion but
[1:19:09] he humbled himself to it
[1:19:13] we've never had a day like he did on
[1:19:15] Calvary
[1:19:16] we've never had a day like that
[1:19:19] but he had a day like that and he knew
[1:19:21] he was going to have that day and he saw
[1:19:23] it by a vision before he stepped into it
[1:19:24] he wasn't saying I wonder how this is
[1:19:26] going to happen or what you know what's
[1:19:28] going to he knew he had to be crucified
[1:19:29] but he knew exactly how many times we've
[1:19:31] beaten all the mockings this rejection
[1:19:34] the pain the hurt any carried the sin of
[1:19:36] the world upon his shoulders no one's
[1:19:38] ever had a day like that but he had a
[1:19:40] day like that but because he but because
[1:19:42] he was humble he could submit himself to
[1:19:44] the word of God the joy that was set
[1:19:47] before him was you redeemed so he could
[1:19:49] gladly do it
[1:19:52] and how about us
[1:19:53] just be baptized right well I don't know
[1:19:56] that's not humility
[1:19:58] just dress in a modest way well I don't
[1:20:00] know where's the humility to obey the
[1:20:02] word
[1:20:03] you know we need the humility of the
[1:20:05] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:06] to fulfill amen his word just be just
[1:20:10] Place ourselves on the altar let him
[1:20:12] take control I don't know where's the
[1:20:13] humility well I was raising the message
[1:20:16] that's all very nice but there's no
[1:20:17] merit badges around here we're not the
[1:20:19] Boy Scouts Girl Scouts Cubs whatever
[1:20:21] more sea Scouts whatever Scouts we're
[1:20:23] not Scouts
[1:20:24] okay you're in the wrong place if you
[1:20:26] think this is a scat Hall it's not see
[1:20:28] it's not about merit badges it's about
[1:20:30] knowing him
[1:20:31] now if you look at Shepherds because um
[1:20:33] you know brother Arman preached on the
[1:20:35] humble king or the noble King so I was
[1:20:37] thinking about the shepherd King
[1:20:39] hallelujah amen that's my king
[1:20:42] that's my king a Shepherd has a very
[1:20:44] unglamorous job there's no glamor being
[1:20:47] a shepherd
[1:20:48] out early you think about imagine
[1:20:50] imagine waking up out in the out in the
[1:20:52] fields or even you know as as the Lord
[1:20:55] Jesus said here's the door to the
[1:20:56] Sheepfold and brother bam says that in
[1:20:58] those days there was one big Corral the
[1:21:00] Sheep came in at night and the Shepherd
[1:21:02] lay as the gate to the Sheep so imagine
[1:21:04] waking up amen and you got frost over
[1:21:07] your blanket
[1:21:08] I mean you're cold you've heard the
[1:21:10] bleeding of the sheep you haven't got
[1:21:11] much sleep but you know that's where you
[1:21:13] slept at night you slept on the job
[1:21:17] you didn't just clock out and say I'm
[1:21:18] going home you know and then complain

[1:21:29] the Wolves and the Bears and all these
[1:21:31] things it's not a glamorous job
[1:21:33] but but our lord Jesus became the lowest
[1:21:35] of the low he became the humble King
[1:21:38] amen that he would exalt a people above
[1:21:40] himself he would take a bride
[1:21:44] and he would lift her up in the end time
[1:21:46] that's why I became humble because he
[1:21:48] wanted to show Satan this is what this
[1:21:50] is what my blood will achieve this is
[1:21:52] what my life will do is I'll take a
[1:21:54] people who are born in sin bought an
[1:21:57] iniquity born lost with sin nature and
[1:22:00] I'll give my life amen that in the end
[1:22:02] time I'll wave them above you Satan and
[1:22:04] say this is what I've achieved Satan you
[1:22:07] can't take them they're in the palms of
[1:22:09] my hands they're part of me and I'll use
[1:22:11] her to give you your final blow upon the
[1:22:14] Earth
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:16] Hallelujah This Is Our God he's not
[1:22:19] proud he's not look at me and how
[1:22:21] awesome I am now he raises the people
[1:22:22] say look at my finest achievement amen
[1:22:25] you're his finest achievement this
[1:22:27] morning amen and Satan's Eden we can
[1:22:30] live in Satan's eat it and not want a
[1:22:32] single Speck of it
[1:22:33] Hallelujah all of the religion New Age
[1:22:35] nonsense the politics the atheistic
[1:22:38] ideas the science whatever it is the
[1:22:40] sport whatever it is there's nothing in
[1:22:42] it that we want because he's so changed
[1:22:45] our nature so I'm going to show you the
[1:22:47] power of my blood I mean you can live in
[1:22:49] the darkest of Ages but yet Shine Like
[1:22:51] the Sun Hallelujah
[1:22:54] that's what God has made us to be this
[1:22:55] morning amen why because of people fully
[1:22:58] surrendered to God omnipotent amen thank
[1:23:01] you God put that spoken word of Creation
[1:23:03] in the bride of Christ
[1:23:04] Hallelujah
[1:23:06] that's our Shepherd
[1:23:08] that's our Shepherd
[1:23:10] Hallelujah but you see a shepherd's
[1:23:13] message because he's the shepherd King
[1:23:14] that kind of message comes to Shepherds
[1:23:17] I mean it didn't it didn't cut it
[1:23:19] doesn't come to the the word comes to
[1:23:21] the humble I'm not just talking about
[1:23:23] having a culture of being a Christian
[1:23:25] because it's our culture now I'm saying
[1:23:27] the word The Living Word comes to the
[1:23:29] humble amen if you want the word of God
[1:23:31] to be made flesh in your life be humble
[1:23:33] that's why the Lord spoke to us last
[1:23:35] Sunday be humble thyself their souls
[1:23:38] that must come in I want to see births I
[1:23:40] want to see a lambing season Hallelujah
[1:23:43] I know we all want to see that amen do
[1:23:45] we not
[1:23:46] but you see the humble a humble message
[1:23:50] I remember because remember the greatest
[1:23:52] message that ever came to the Earth
[1:23:55] the greatest announcement of the
[1:23:57] greatest birth that could ever happen
[1:23:58] upon the Earth was given to Shepherds it
[1:24:02] wasn't given to the high priest it
[1:24:04] wasn't announced in Jerusalem and the
[1:24:07] temple and all the great schools of
[1:24:08] learning it didn't come to gamalia or
[1:24:11] whoever the rabbi the rabbis was the
[1:24:13] Angels never went there amen they went
[1:24:16] to Shepherds on the field why because it
[1:24:19] had to come to Humble Shepherds why
[1:24:21] because a God of all humility amen was
[1:24:25] born upon the earth and the only ones
[1:24:27] that could receive that King were made
[1:24:29] of the same stuff Amen to the angels
[1:24:32] came down into the promised land they
[1:24:34] couldn't they couldn't come to the high
[1:24:36] priest they couldn't come to anyone who
[1:24:37] thought they were something they came to
[1:24:39] the outcasts of society you think those
[1:24:42] Shepherds would be welcome in the temple
[1:24:44] do I have a bath first buddy you stink
[1:24:47] like your flock are you just a poor
[1:24:49] little homeless Shepherd living out on
[1:24:51] the street Leo but yet it came to Humble
[1:24:54] Shepherds amen and that and the angel
[1:24:57] said that Christ the Messiah is born
[1:24:59] upon the Earth
[1:25:01] amen and where was he born he was born
[1:25:04] in a stinking manger over a manure power
[1:25:07] with a bunch of animals a very Lord Of
[1:25:08] Glory Emmanuel became flesh and the
[1:25:12] reason it came to Shepherds is the
[1:25:13] Shepherds felt home where the Messiah
[1:25:15] was
[1:25:17] Hallelujah and it's got to be the same
[1:25:20] way today amen amen we're gonna have the
[1:25:22] same heart humility as the word that
[1:25:24] we'll feel comfortable to go where the
[1:25:26] Messiah is and the Messiah is his word
[1:25:29] amen see you'll never be able to go to
[1:25:31] the word actually to him unless you have
[1:25:33] the humble heart that he has
[1:25:35] Hallelujah so he bypassed everybody and
[1:25:39] came to Humble Shepherds why because it
[1:25:41] was a message because the god of
[1:25:43] humility was born upon the Earth
[1:25:45] amen and you see but the thing is you
[1:25:48] see what the angel told them they found
[1:25:52] amen what the angel told them they found
[1:25:54] amen the seventh angel has announced the
[1:25:57] message God has used the seventh angel
[1:25:59] in this end time to announce a message
[1:26:00] that Messiah is upon the Earth that
[1:26:03] Christ's word is upon the Earth amen
[1:26:05] Remember All That Heaven is is upon the
[1:26:07] Earth right now you may not realize it
[1:26:09] but you know the only thing that we do
[1:26:11] not have is the physical body of the
[1:26:13] Lord Jesus Christ all that he is is upon
[1:26:16] the Earth all of his power all of his
[1:26:18] anointing all of his blessings all that
[1:26:20] he has is upon the Earth but we're going
[1:26:22] to meet his physical body in the air
[1:26:24] that's what Believers believe amen
[1:26:26] Believers Believers no physical Return
[1:26:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're going
[1:26:30] to meet him in the air but his holy
[1:26:32] spirit is upon the Earth remember His
[1:26:34] holy spirit is no less power or ability
[1:26:37] just because he is not here remember the
[1:26:40] Centurion went to Jesus said my servant
[1:26:43] is sick right Jesus says I'll come into
[1:26:45] your house and pray for he says I'm not
[1:26:47] worthy for you to come under my roof
[1:26:48] just speak the word only and my servant
[1:26:51] will be well amen that is Gentile Faith
[1:26:54] because his faith realized that Jesus
[1:26:57] speaking the word wasn't exactly the
[1:26:59] same as him physically walking into the
[1:27:00] house laying his hands upon the servant
[1:27:03] and pronouncing him him well amen that
[1:27:06] is Gentile Faith that's why it's so just
[1:27:09] speak the word amen believe the word and
[1:27:11] that word will go and produce what it
[1:27:13] promised it will produce that's why we
[1:27:15] could have Maggie in the hospital in
[1:27:17] Wellington but we can speak the word in
[1:27:19] prayer amen we can speak it here and God
[1:27:21] will go perform that which he said in
[1:27:23] his word amen I believe that don't you
[1:27:25] amen that's that is Gentile faith
[1:27:29] Hallelujah
[1:27:31] amen but we're going to realize now see
[1:27:34] so what they said they'd find they found
[1:27:36] we what the seventh Angels said would
[1:27:38] find we're found Christ is alive his
[1:27:41] word is true he's here to fulfill amen
[1:27:44] the wrap-up is Plan of Redemption
[1:27:48] you see in order to be humble we must do
[1:27:51] the opposite to the devil
[1:27:52] the devil only thinks about himself
[1:27:55] he don't care about his other angels
[1:27:57] that fell with him he doesn't care about
[1:27:59] anyone he has his own ambition
[1:28:02] that's it
[1:28:04] but Jesus will pray sanctify them
[1:28:06] through thy truth Thy word is truth
[1:28:08] as thou has sent me into the world even
[1:28:11] so have I or uh even so have I also sent
[1:28:14] them into the world for their sakes I
[1:28:17] sanctify myself that they also might be
[1:28:20] Sanctified through the truth
[1:28:22] so he's saying Lord I sanctify myself
[1:28:25] for their sakes I put their needs above
[1:28:27] my need I don't put my needs above their
[1:28:30] needs see humility to be surrendered the
[1:28:32] word of God you know it's actually not
[1:28:33] for you only it's for those around you
[1:28:37] I mean that's why we should always have
[1:28:38] the heart of the Lord Jesus saying Lord
[1:28:40] I sanctify myself I'm willing to give up
[1:28:42] stuff that robs me of my time I'm
[1:28:44] willing to give up addictions and things
[1:28:46] that just rob me of my time amen for
[1:28:48] their sakes what is for their sake said
[1:28:50] God you'd come live in my life then an
[1:28:52] atmosphere of power the Holy Ghost would
[1:28:54] live around me that they would drop into
[1:28:57] it and meet the Lord Jesus amen just
[1:28:59] like brother and Paul said on Wednesday
[1:29:00] that we should lead our children into
[1:29:02] the new birth
[1:29:03] that's a responsibility of a parent to
[1:29:06] leave it's not just to say don't do this
[1:29:07] and do this and stop this instead of no
[1:29:09] we should create an atmosphere around us
[1:29:11] sure we raise them and train them sure
[1:29:13] but our whole Hearts desires Lord anoint
[1:29:16] me
[1:29:17] that they would be led into a new birth
[1:29:19] experience
[1:29:20] not just a bit of a conviction but a
[1:29:22] full death to self and be born again you
[1:29:24] don't have to receive you know it's not
[1:29:26] just receiving holy ghost in a church or
[1:29:28] at a camp you can receive it at home
[1:29:30] Hallelujah he's the same God at home he
[1:29:33] should be amen he's the same God at home
[1:29:35] because he said I'll never leave you nor
[1:29:36] forsake thee amen so that should be a
[1:29:39] harsh desire so we should really say
[1:29:40] Lord whatever's robbing me of my time
[1:29:44] get it out of me because I want to see
[1:29:46] my children know you Lord
[1:29:48] Evan's a bad attitude fussing against
[1:29:50] someone whatever it is doesn't matter
[1:29:52] what's taking up your time lord burn it
[1:29:54] out of me Lord
[1:29:56] because I want to be Sanctified for
[1:29:58] their sake
[1:29:59] I mean because our children deserve a
[1:30:02] holy ghost Revival they deserve to see a
[1:30:05] book of Acts they deserve to see every
[1:30:07] promise that God manifested in their
[1:30:09] lives that's what our children deserve
[1:30:11] amen that's their inheritance amen amen
[1:30:14] they deserve to see a father and mother
[1:30:15] that love each other I mean they're not
[1:30:17] not trying to you know sway the children
[1:30:19] against the other and all these things
[1:30:20] they deserve parents that are not
[1:30:22] selfish
[1:30:23] hey man amen this is what our children
[1:30:26] deserve amen
[1:30:28] amen so we should have this Heart Lord I
[1:30:31] sanctify for their sakes I sanctify
[1:30:33] myself
[1:30:36] yes amen
[1:30:38] Jesus said the son can do nothing of
[1:30:40] himself but what he seeth the father do
[1:30:42] for what things over he doeth their uh
[1:30:46] these all also doeth the sun likewise so
[1:30:49] he was led he was humble he is
[1:30:51] surrendered to the word of God
[1:30:53] I mean now we know that compassion is
[1:30:57] very a very misunderstood thing
[1:30:59] compassion really Bible compassion is to
[1:31:02] follow the will of God not human
[1:31:04] sympathy but compassion oh it's two
[1:31:07] different words altogether sympathy and
[1:31:08] compassion see if it wasn't Jesus sure
[1:31:11] made a rude mistake when he did that see
[1:31:13] and he's talking about when he went to
[1:31:14] the pool of Bethesda you know and
[1:31:16] there's all those sick ones there but he
[1:31:17] only went to one and healed one
[1:31:19] but why he was led by a vision to that
[1:31:22] one now that doesn't mean we don't have
[1:31:24] human sympathy we should sympathize
[1:31:26] we should have beating hearts that feel
[1:31:28] every kind of emotion right amen amen
[1:31:30] it's what you do with that emotion we
[1:31:31] know that I'm just talking about on the
[1:31:32] positive side but you see we should have
[1:31:35] human sympathy but don't we but we
[1:31:37] mustn't be led by human sympathy we must
[1:31:40] be led by the will of God
[1:31:42] amen if we uh if we are humble
[1:31:45] then I believe we will be led by Godly
[1:31:47] compassion
[1:31:49] amen but you see the danger is
[1:31:52] because the devil is no respecter of
[1:31:54] persons if he can't make you think you
[1:31:57] are useless and God can't use you he'll
[1:32:00] make your stuff shirt thinking you are
[1:32:02] the great Cog in the wheel
[1:32:04] God is the great Cog of the wheel
[1:32:07] he's the important one
[1:32:09] see
[1:32:10] he said he was talking he turned around
[1:32:12] he's talking to a brother he's who who
[1:32:14] said to him I just read a certain
[1:32:17] brother's book that told us that after
[1:32:18] we received the Holy Ghost we should
[1:32:19] seek after gifts for uh for these to use
[1:32:22] this Holy Ghost I said and become a
[1:32:25] stuffed shirt see if you notice in the
[1:32:27] Bible it's always those who are trying
[1:32:28] to get away from it that God uses as
[1:32:31] long as a man wants to do something and
[1:32:33] thinks he's got enough ability he can
[1:32:35] put the job over God can never use that
[1:32:38] man
[1:32:40] so if you never want to be used by God
[1:32:42] in your life think you can do it
[1:32:45] that's a real simple rule but if you
[1:32:48] think you can't do it then God can use
[1:32:49] you and he'll do it
[1:32:51] amen
[1:32:54] look at Moses running look at Paul
[1:32:56] running and the rest of them trying to
[1:32:57] get away from it I said don't seek
[1:32:58] nothing God has got
[1:33:01] uh God has got anything for you he'll
[1:33:03] give it to you see and just let him take
[1:33:06] care of that I said even
[1:33:08] then you get some of these times like we
[1:33:11] got have today that everybody's wanting
[1:33:13] to do this and do that and become some
[1:33:15] great person
[1:33:17] look what we got into with it you see
[1:33:20] instead of trying to be great we ought
[1:33:22] to try and uh be trying to find out how
[1:33:25] little we can get see then God can use
[1:33:27] us
[1:33:29] that's how we should be amen not trying
[1:33:31] to be some great big person
[1:33:33] but let God be the great person because
[1:33:35] he is the great person let's get
[1:33:37] everyone let's get everything into
[1:33:38] perspective he's our father he's our
[1:33:41] everything he made everything he saved
[1:33:44] us by his grace and here we are enjoying
[1:33:46] the benefits of everything he has done
[1:33:48] Holly just enjoying the goodness of God
[1:33:50] Amen so he's the great person
[1:33:53] Hallelujah
[1:33:55] amen see
[1:33:57] God wants to take you and use you as an
[1:33:59] enzyme as a banner that his blood works
[1:34:03] hey man see
[1:34:05] let me tell you brother when ye are dead
[1:34:08] and your life is hidden Christ through
[1:34:09] God and sealed by the Holy Ghost and God
[1:34:10] lifts you up in Heavenly places you'll
[1:34:13] be an enzyme that a work of God has a a
[1:34:16] work of God has been committed in you
[1:34:18] Jesus in Mark 16 these signs shall
[1:34:21] follow them that believe what kind of an
[1:34:22] enzyme is it some great stuff shirt no
[1:34:25] humility the fullness of God in Christ
[1:34:28] Jesus made him walk like a humble
[1:34:30] peasant made him wash the feet of his
[1:34:32] disciples had not a place to lay his
[1:34:34] head some of us calling ourselves
[1:34:36] Christians we go to a place uh you've
[1:34:39] got
[1:34:40] we've got to have the best there is in
[1:34:42] the country got to be guaranteed so much
[1:34:44] money we won't go the Evangelist some
[1:34:46] pastors won't go to a church unless it's
[1:34:47] high class and a big place oh my we need
[1:34:50] another experience like Paul saw when
[1:34:52] he's on the road to Damascus Paul saw
[1:34:54] that enzyme lifted up he said who are
[1:34:56] you Lord he said I'm Jesus what we need
[1:34:58] tonight is another Pillar of Fire
[1:34:59] hanging over the church again tonight
[1:35:01] I'll say this morning that people's
[1:35:03] bloated eyes would be open and could see
[1:35:06] it amen CeCe God when he does a work in
[1:35:09] our lives he makes us to walk in
[1:35:11] humility because he walked in humility
[1:35:15] amen now
[1:35:17] if you look at the power of the devil
[1:35:20] how a man who's filled with the devil
[1:35:22] can be seven times stronger than a
[1:35:24] natural man
[1:35:25] right now if Satan can give that kind of
[1:35:27] a power to a man fully surrendered to
[1:35:29] him how much more power can the Holy
[1:35:31] Spirit put on a man that's fully
[1:35:33] surrendered to him I mean to make a
[1:35:34] person in a wheelchair rise and walk to
[1:35:37] make the shadow of a man dying with
[1:35:38] cancer on a to jump to his feet
[1:35:40] screaming under the power of God for how
[1:35:42] much stronger is God than the devil now
[1:35:44] we know the devil is defeated at Calvary
[1:35:46] he's he's conquered he's done amen so so
[1:35:50] but if the devil has power how much more
[1:35:52] does God have power
[1:35:54] are you following me right now I mean
[1:35:56] we're going to realize that if we're
[1:35:57] fully surrendered to God God can move in
[1:35:59] a way we in ways that we can't even
[1:36:01] really imagine I'm just trying to put a
[1:36:03] faith in us you know God is all-powerful
[1:36:05] but he wants to step into our lives and
[1:36:06] manifest his glory amen but a man fully
[1:36:10] surrendered to God Amen is omnipotent
[1:36:13] I'm just going to come to this I was
[1:36:14] talking about it right see see the see
[1:36:16] our lord Jesus cut every obstacle from
[1:36:18] human beings amen that we might be
[1:36:21] connected like in the Garden of Eden I'm
[1:36:23] gonna I'm gonna finish soon okay so
[1:36:24] don't get too you know we're all right
[1:36:26] right so I see see man in the Garden of
[1:36:28] Eden had dominion over everything
[1:36:30] amen and God wants to restore our people
[1:36:33] back into that same condition that they
[1:36:35] have dominion over every sickness
[1:36:36] disease or death fear whatever it may be
[1:36:39] nature everything right amen BC now he
[1:36:43] our lord Jesus has already made us thus
[1:36:46] he doesn't have to come and die again
[1:36:48] for more no one by one offering for all
[1:36:51] he has perfected them that are
[1:36:53] Sanctified right amen so when Jesus died
[1:36:55] on Calvary that's all he had to do in
[1:36:57] terms of purchasing our Redemption amen
[1:37:00] it was fully paid for that day amen so
[1:37:03] now see he says now man is omnipotent so
[1:37:05] man is all-powerful that's what
[1:37:07] omnipotent means you don't believe that
[1:37:08] but he is a man fully surrendered to God
[1:37:11] as omnipotent did he not say in Mark 11
[1:37:13] 22 whatsoever things you say and don't
[1:37:16] doubt in your heart it'll come to pass
[1:37:18] you can have what you've said what
[1:37:20] happens when two omnipotents meet when
[1:37:22] God and man comes together two
[1:37:24] omnipotents Uh something's got to shake
[1:37:28] I mean we say well I made them years ago
[1:37:30] but what about today I mean when we have
[1:37:32] great needs in our midst today what
[1:37:33] about when two omnipotents meet today
[1:37:35] something's got to shake I mean hell's
[1:37:37] got to move I mean sickness has got to
[1:37:39] back up amen when two omnipotents meet I
[1:37:42] mean whatsoever you'd say with that
[1:37:44] creative power of the omnipotence of God
[1:37:46] knowing that he promised it and he said
[1:37:48] it in his word it creates a power that
[1:37:50] goes out yonder and brings things to
[1:37:52] pass things that is not and makes them
[1:37:54] as though they are because two
[1:37:55] omnipotents have met there he stands oh
[1:37:58] isn't he wonderful and you can go
[1:38:01] through the Bible and see when two
[1:38:02] omnipotents met too omnipotents met in
[1:38:04] the days of Noah Noah was lifted above
[1:38:06] the judgment to a new world two
[1:38:08] omnipotents men the days of Moses Moses
[1:38:10] took amen Israel out of Egypt right too
[1:38:13] omnipotents meant with Joshua before
[1:38:15] they crossed Jordan the wall of Jericho
[1:38:17] came tumbling down they took the land
[1:38:19] right Germany poters met when David
[1:38:22] before David fought Goliath yeah
[1:38:25] you can take it all the way through the
[1:38:26] scripture two omnipotent something's got
[1:38:28] to shake amen and it's not the Kingdom
[1:38:31] of Heaven that shakes is the kingdom of
[1:38:32] hell that shakes amen because why
[1:38:35] because there's power that comes into a
[1:38:36] human being that fulfills the word of
[1:38:39] God see we're not living with an
[1:38:40] argument friends this is not a debate an
[1:38:42] argument collection of ideas this is
[1:38:44] reality Hallelujah
[1:38:46] praise the Lord and and you say well how
[1:38:49] can we be omnipotent I need Scripture
[1:38:50] well Jesus said if thou cast believe all
[1:38:52] things are possible to him that
[1:38:53] believeth
[1:38:55] all things are possible not some things
[1:38:57] all things are possible to them that
[1:39:00] believe the Bible says if two agree on
[1:39:03] Earth concerning anything the Lord will
[1:39:04] do it we need to start agreeing with one
[1:39:06] another
[1:39:08] just be in agreement
[1:39:09] there's a need we agree one for another
[1:39:12] God's going to fulfill his word
[1:39:14] amen someone's lost in the world we're
[1:39:16] going to agree God's gonna bring them
[1:39:17] home
[1:39:18] amen because he says concerning anything
[1:39:22] that's a lot of things
[1:39:23] now you know if you really agree
[1:39:25] considering a promise that God is not a
[1:39:27] selfish thing it's not I need a mansion
[1:39:29] let's agree
[1:39:30] I need a new car no nothing like that
[1:39:33] we're talking about real things they
[1:39:34] actually matter
[1:39:35] amen but you see now a character I just
[1:39:38] gonna drop down with
[1:39:41] remember characters of Victory and not a
[1:39:43] gift
[1:39:43] so humility is not a gift it's a victory
[1:39:48] right to be humble it's a it's a victory
[1:39:50] what is it a victory it's a victory over
[1:39:53] self
[1:39:54] and what we think we are if you want to
[1:39:56] be humble you gotta this thing's got to
[1:39:58] be conquered
[1:39:59] right the only way to conquer it is
[1:40:01] place it on God's Altar and let them
[1:40:02] burn it out amen but not just die but
[1:40:05] stay dead
[1:40:06] that's the challenge we're going to stay
[1:40:08] dead under the hand of God that God can
[1:40:10] live
[1:40:10] amen so that's the only way we can
[1:40:12] really stay be humble and stay humble is
[1:40:15] that we realize that that character is a
[1:40:17] victory it's not a God just doesn't hand
[1:40:19] it out like a lolly right it's a victory
[1:40:22] there's a thing that we've gotta because
[1:40:24] a man without character can't Reign
[1:40:26] because power apart from characters say
[1:40:28] satanic but Power with character is for
[1:40:32] to rule
[1:40:33] amen now
[1:40:35] I'm just going to come down to this
[1:40:37] right
[1:40:39] we're we have afflictions in life
[1:40:42] right we have afflictions in life some
[1:40:45] do I'm glad yeah some people are honor
[1:40:46] some people are just living a if you
[1:40:48] don't have any Affliction tell me how
[1:40:49] you live and I wanna
[1:40:51] because no one no one no one signs up
[1:40:53] for punishment right
[1:40:55] anywho
[1:40:57] but notice the Apostle Paul here
[1:41:00] but we see that this treasure uh we have
[1:41:03] this treasure in Earth and vessels that
[1:41:04] the Excellency of the power may be of
[1:41:06] God and not of us we are troubled on
[1:41:08] every side yet not distressed we are
[1:41:11] perplexed but not in despair persecuted
[1:41:14] but not forsaken cast down but not
[1:41:16] destroyed amen so therefore we can have
[1:41:18] trouble on every side yet we're not
[1:41:20] distressed it's how I feel a bit
[1:41:22] distressed but you're actually not
[1:41:23] distressed I mean because your Help
[1:41:25] Cometh From The Lord amen that we can
[1:41:27] look beyond our trouble on every side
[1:41:28] say no this trouble's not going to
[1:41:30] destroy me this trouble is not going to
[1:41:33] take my faith from me amen what the
[1:41:35] world can't take away the world didn't
[1:41:37] give right this faith that I have the
[1:41:39] world didn't give it to me this love
[1:41:41] that I have the world didn't give it to
[1:41:43] me this joy that I have the love the
[1:41:45] world didn't give it to me the and the
[1:41:46] world didn't give it the world can't
[1:41:48] take it away amen we can be persecuted
[1:41:51] but that doesn't mean we're forsaken
[1:41:54] well I'm really receiving a lot of heat
[1:41:57] no but that doesn't mean you're forsaken
[1:42:00] yeah I mean hey man cast down but not
[1:42:03] destroyed who's felt cast down sometimes
[1:42:05] that doesn't mean you're destroyed
[1:42:07] Hallelujah always bearing about in the
[1:42:10] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[1:42:12] the life also of Jesus might be made
[1:42:13] manifest in our body for we which live
[1:42:16] are always delivered unto death for
[1:42:18] Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus
[1:42:20] might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:42:22] flesh so then death worketh in us but
[1:42:25] life in you we have the same Spirit of
[1:42:28] Faith so notice he's talking about these
[1:42:29] afflictions and troubles but now he
[1:42:31] comes down with a spoken word comes into
[1:42:34] manifestation manifestation we having
[1:42:37] the same Spirit of Faith according it as
[1:42:40] is written I believed and therefore have
[1:42:42] I spoken ye we also believe and
[1:42:45] therefore speak amen so the ability to
[1:42:48] speak in faith has got nothing to do
[1:42:51] with the amount of Reflections troubles
[1:42:53] distress being cast down whatever's
[1:42:55] going on in your life amen amen you're
[1:42:58] with me amen so we maybe have trouble on
[1:43:00] every side that doesn't mean this mouth
[1:43:01] can't speak the promises of God Amen we
[1:43:03] be we may be distressed we may have
[1:43:05] trouble we may have all kinds of things
[1:43:07] persecution being cast down whatever's
[1:43:10] going on that doesn't mean we can't take
[1:43:11] the word and faith and lift it before
[1:43:13] God
[1:43:14] Hallelujah
[1:43:16] amen
[1:43:19] knowing that he that he which raised up
[1:43:22] the Lord Jesus shall raise uh up us also
[1:43:25] by Jesus and shall present us with you
[1:43:27] for all things are for your sakes at the
[1:43:29] abundant grace might through the
[1:43:31] Thanksgiving of many rebound to the
[1:43:32] glory of God for this cause we faint not
[1:43:35] but though our outward man perish yet
[1:43:37] the inward man is renewed day by day for
[1:43:40] our light Affliction which is for but a
[1:43:43] moment worketh for us are more exceeding
[1:43:44] and eternal weight of Glory while we
[1:43:46] look not at the things which are seen
[1:43:50] this is what we're not looking at we're
[1:43:52] not looking at symptoms we're not
[1:43:54] looking at what we see we're not looking
[1:43:56] at whatever's going on we don't look at
[1:43:58] those things right amen amen
[1:44:01] we while we not look at while we look
[1:44:04] not at things that are seen but the
[1:44:06] things which are not seen for the things
[1:44:08] which are seen are temporal but the
[1:44:09] things which are not seen are
[1:44:11] eternal
[1:44:12] amen and if you're walking humbly that
[1:44:14] means you're not self-sufficient that
[1:44:17] man is not you trying to do the job that
[1:44:19] you are not in the equation and the
[1:44:21] ability for God to make his word come to
[1:44:23] pass but if you are walking humbly you
[1:44:26] can look beyond the eye
[1:44:28] and the me and the how of I and you know
[1:44:31] and you look at him which is the Unseen
[1:44:33] to the promises of God you look Beyond
[1:44:36] like I remember brother Ron Spencer when
[1:44:38] he was um when he was uh when he was you
[1:44:41] know three years ago when he was
[1:44:42] diagnosed diagnosed with stage four
[1:44:43] cancer and the Lord told him
[1:44:46] look beyond what you see and think
[1:44:49] beyond what you think
[1:44:51] so the Lord's telling him you've got to
[1:44:52] look Beyond this this cancer in your
[1:44:54] body and what you think the the natural
[1:44:57] thoughts about it you're gonna look
[1:44:59] Beyond those things to the promises of
[1:45:02] God
[1:45:03] amen and I believe if we're walking
[1:45:06] humbly with the Lord we know Lord
[1:45:07] everything's in your control we're never
[1:45:09] out of your care you've allowed this for
[1:45:12] a reason
[1:45:13] right and we can trust you in the storm
[1:45:16] amen
[1:45:18] Hallelujah
[1:45:21] amen
[1:45:23] praise the Lord now
[1:45:25] I'm just going to finish with this quote
[1:45:27] so I feel like we're having scramble
[1:45:28] leagues today but enjoy the scrambled
[1:45:30] eggs
[1:45:30] it says Church of the Living God here
[1:45:33] and on tape too
[1:45:34] do you know where you stand
[1:45:37] do you know that you're that you were
[1:45:39] called of God that the Holy Ghost Reigns
[1:45:41] in your heart and every word of God is
[1:45:43] real to you
[1:45:44] do you know that hey man if you walk
[1:45:46] into humility
[1:45:47] the word Reigns in your heart what it
[1:45:50] rains in you amen the Holy Ghost race
[1:45:52] because it's not you it's not my will
[1:45:53] but his will be done right oh brother
[1:45:56] how is Satan gonna stand against that
[1:45:58] how's he ever going to make that person
[1:46:00] proud how is it going to make that
[1:46:01] person arrogant how is he ever going to
[1:46:03] make that person self-sufficient
[1:46:05] amen because ultimately that's that's
[1:46:07] what the devil wants to try and do make
[1:46:09] us walk in this flesh be carnal think
[1:46:11] well this is how I think it should be in
[1:46:13] my opinion this you know this is what
[1:46:15] Mike you know and going by experience
[1:46:17] above the word of God we should always
[1:46:18] go by the word of God more than anything

[1:46:23] that from growing
[1:46:24] how's it going to keep them signs from

[1:46:36] to pieces you can't kill it right a
[1:46:38] church that's predestinated those who he
[1:46:40] foreknew he did like he did Jesus he was
[1:46:44] called those who he called he is
[1:46:46] Justified and those who he has Justified
[1:46:48] he is also glorified and now in the last
[1:46:51] days with every seed sowed everything in
[1:46:53] order the the world is uh in its order
[1:46:56] but time shaped up the church and its
[1:46:58] order the sea the evening lights the
[1:47:00] signs like he said as it was in the days
[1:47:02] of Sodom an angel of God the Holy Spirit
[1:47:04] coming down moving performing the signs
[1:47:06] that he did then Malachi 4 promised that
[1:47:08] he had sinned in the last days what he
[1:47:10] promised and we see and we see all of
[1:47:13] that right here where where amen amen

[1:47:36] that we've been bought with a price the
[1:47:38] precious blood of Jesus Christ we know
[1:47:40] we're not our own I mean we know
[1:47:41] wherever we go in life you know if we're
[1:47:43] fully surrendered to God God will lead
[1:47:45] us through right we know that it's
[1:47:47] humility that we must be robed by him
[1:47:49] and we know that we're not just saved in
[1:47:51] a haphazard way but he saved us to keep
