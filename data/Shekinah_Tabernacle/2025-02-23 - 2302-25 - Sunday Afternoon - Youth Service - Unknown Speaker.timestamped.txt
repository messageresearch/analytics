[17:04] standing I would like to say that today
[17:07] has been the best day of my life so far
[17:10] amen because you know I'm a day grown in
[17:13] the Lord
[17:14] more and you know some of you may be
[17:17] thinking you know I like how brother
[17:18] David's so positive and by the grace of
[17:21] God I'm able to be a good example and
[17:24] that's the title for our sermon today is
[17:27] being a good example amen so we can turn
[17:30] our Bibles to 2 Kings
[17:32] 9:30 and it says here and when so this
[17:37] is we're going to start off with a bad
[17:39] example of of who not to be like am mean
[17:42] this is um and it says and when Jo who
[17:45] was come to jezrael Jezebel heard of it
[17:48] and she painted her face I mean what
[17:50] absolute bad example amen you may have
[17:52] your seats and we see all the woman
[17:54] today also all painting their
[17:56] faces and
[17:59] we can see her there there she is with
[18:02] all of her her crap and brother brandham
[18:05] says brother brm says here says so you
[18:08] know there is only one woman in the
[18:10] Bible that ever painted her face and she
[18:12] never painted her face to meet God she
[18:14] painted her face to meet a man that's
[18:16] right you knew what God did for her fed
[18:19] her to the dogs you see a woman wearing
[18:22] paint you can just say good morning Miss
[18:24] dog me that's exactly what it is that's
[18:25] awful Isn't it but that's what God
[18:28] thinks about it she has just made common
[18:30] dog meat for wild dogs that's about what
[18:32] she is amen and that's what the Lord
[18:34] thinks about a bad example amen and we
[18:36] have another one we see here in Exodus
[18:40] 148 and the Lord hardened the heart of
[18:42] pharaoh king of Egypt amen and he
[18:45] pursued after the children of Israel
[18:47] amen and we know that it wasn't just
[18:48] Pharaoh running after these people it
[18:49] was all of the dudes who were with him
[18:53] amen and we go down to verse 27 and
[18:56] Moses stretched Force's hand over the
[18:58] sea and the Sea returned to his strength
[19:01] when the morning appeared and the
[19:02] Egyptians fled against it and the Lord
[19:04] overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of
[19:06] the Sea and the waters returned and
[19:08] covered the Chariots all of those people
[19:09] who followed followed pharaoh who were
[19:12] following his bad example all died and
[19:14] the horsemen and all the hosts of
[19:15] pharaoh that came into the sea after
[19:16] them there remain not so much as one of
[19:19] them amen so that's what happens when
[19:21] you follow the these bad examples and
[19:24] here's another bad example this is a
[19:26] numbers 16:32
[19:28] and the Earth opened her mouth and
[19:31] swallowed them up and their houses and
[19:34] all the men that have tamed unto Kora
[19:36] and all their gods that was cor and
[19:38] Dayan amen and we know that they were
[19:39] complaining to Moses complaining that he
[19:42] only had access to God and all these
[19:44] other things and then the Lord and they
[19:46] they were actually a bad example if we
[19:48] can go up to here we can notice he
[19:50] swallowed them up and the houses and all
[19:51] the men that abtained unto unto them so
[19:54] it wasn't just them it was also some
[19:56] other
[19:57] people and but here brother brandham we
[20:00] have some some examples brother bham
[20:03] gives us some good examples of what to
[20:04] be like
[20:06] amen and you know Christ is the example
[20:08] that we must follow
[20:10] Amen brother B says here it's proved God
[20:13] is visiting the people today God is in
[20:16] his church trying to purge the thing
[20:18] take out the leav out of it he's sending
[20:20] Messengers signs and wonders and
[20:21] miracles and everything trying to prove
[20:23] that he loves them and that he wants
[20:25] them to clean up get get rid of this
[20:27] here all this carrying on staying home
[20:30] on Wednesday night for permitting to
[20:31] look at this old silly stuff of an old
[20:33] woman from Hollywood married four or
[20:35] five different times some guys that's
[20:37] run with half the woman on the west
[20:38] coast who loves Lucy and all these
[20:41] things like that and you Christian
[20:42] people stay home to stay away from the
[20:44] house of God it chose what kind of a
[20:46] spirit is in you amen I've got it at
[20:49] home from the FBI Falls any Minister can
[20:51] get it there wants to if you only know
[20:53] the filth and the things that them
[20:56] people that you make your examples dress
[20:58] like them I mean he speaking dressing
[20:59] like dressing like these evil people
[21:01] dress like them act like them talk like
[21:02] them brother read your Bible amen talk
[21:05] like a Christian act like a Christian
[21:08] amen be like a Christian live like a
[21:11] Christian what we need today amen and I
[21:13] believe I'm looking at all of those
[21:15] people who do that amen such a
[21:18] blessing and we have another one and
[21:21] brother bam says you see a man humble
[21:23] loving good to his neighbors and a good
[21:26] citizen this is this is who we need to
[21:27] be like a good man good fellow and a
[21:31] good man and a Christian man full of
[21:32] love and humility you watch that man see
[21:35] that's right he's good charitable
[21:37] longsuffering you can talk about him
[21:39] that's uh all right he forgives
[21:41] you amen it don't make any difference to
[21:44] him there that's the real man keep your
[21:47] eye on him see that he Bears he's an
[21:49] example amen some of you may say brother
[21:52] who is that man what there he is right
[21:54] there amen good example praise God Amen
[21:59] and I have some more good example
[22:02] stories I mean I I I was once I went
[22:05] with um an Milan I stayed with arnard
[22:07] and Marion and I was staying in Arn's
[22:10] bedroom with him and he would always
[22:13] before he went to bed he would always
[22:15] pray and read his Bible and so from then
[22:17] on whenever I went home I would always
[22:20] also pray and read my Bible so brother
[22:22] ared was a very good influence on
[22:24] me amen I have another one here so this
[22:28] fellow has on a nice waterproof jacket
[22:31] and it's very cold there amen you know I
[22:33] was I was going to go hunting with Ben
[22:36] Bailey and Ben Bailey he he he doesn't
[22:38] do too much hunting so he hasn't got a
[22:41] whole lot of not as much gear as I do
[22:43] but I was sort of in the shed and he was
[22:45] getting together his the few things that
[22:47] he's got and I heard him saying to
[22:48] Sister Maggie sister Maggie um where's
[22:51] my waterproof jacket like David's one I
[22:53] me so I was a good example to him
[22:55] because when you go into the bush
[22:56] without a waterproof jacket it was
[22:57] raining you can get very cold and yeah
[23:00] so I like that amen and then now I'm
[23:04] going to move on to some bad
[23:06] examples am me we'll like these bad
[23:09] examples cuz they show us what not to do
[23:11] but here we see this dog chasing all of
[23:13] these deer I mean and I I used to have a
[23:16] dog and I had a pig dog and that was the
[23:18] um the one thing that they well one of
[23:20] the few things that they're not supposed
[23:22] to do was Chase deer and anyways I had
[23:24] this one dog and he would go chase these
[23:26] deer and I had another dog who he didn't
[23:29] really Chase deer but because my dog
[23:31] always chased deer this other dog also
[23:33] started chasing deer and together they
[23:35] disappeared chasing deer so they it was
[23:38] very bad so the one dog influenced the
[23:40] other and it was a turned to a title
[23:42] disaster so that dog was a bad example
[23:45] upon my other
[23:46] dog here we have another one amen um I I
[23:52] have a BB gun and I was driving up to
[23:55] the Oakland Convention with brother Mion
[23:56] and brother Kiri and
[23:59] um brother K is so cool he always gets
[24:01] all these cool stuff like he's got all
[24:03] his phones and all the stuff I was like
[24:05] brother K you know you should get a um a
[24:08] BB gun man things are fun brother car
[24:11] went and brought himself one and I saw
[24:13] him a while later at the um Pizza
[24:15] Factory and sister Robin was with us and
[24:17] I was at the table with them talking
[24:19] brother K was like oh you know I was
[24:21] using my baby gun and I dropped it and
[24:23] it broke and I was like ah you know this
[24:24] thing's happen Carrie you should buy
[24:26] yourself a a bigger one one that's more
[24:28] powerful and since Robin said no David
[24:31] he'll have no more toes
[24:34] but but I'm sure is very he's probably
[24:37] pretty safe with his gun but
[24:40] anyways and we have another
[24:43] one amen see these fellows you know
[24:47] what's embarrassing about these fellows
[24:48] is they're in the undes amen what an
[24:51] embarrassment and you know it's very in
[24:53] the pig hunting culture especially
[24:55] amongst all the worldly fellows a lot of
[24:57] those fellows wear little tiny shorts
[24:59] all year round and if they do it all
[25:00] year round they're so tough but they're
[25:02] not their little sissies but anyways I
[25:05] was I was very easily influenced by the
[25:08] bad example and I thought wearing little
[25:09] tiny shorts is cool so I also tried to
[25:12] wear little tiny shorts but as see and
[25:14] they were a very bad example upon me but
[25:16] it's an absolute
[25:17] disgrace
[25:19] amen we have another one
[25:21] here oh this person's falling off his
[25:23] dirt bike um I i' I've got a 450 dirt
[25:27] bike and little Abraham he like oh you
[25:30] know David I'd i' I'd like to ride your
[25:32] dirt bike and if he could he'd have to
[25:35] I'd have to hold and he'd step on it and
[25:37] he got very good at it and he could even
[25:39] do it by himself like because it's so
[25:41] high up his legs are so far off the
[25:42] ground and um he'd go over to like a
[25:45] where he could like a a ledge and step
[25:48] on the bike and then ride it and um
[25:50] brother Malachi and brother liham came
[25:52] over and they saw him riding my dirt
[25:53] bike and it was a um a coalition between
[25:57] me and Abes were a little bit bad
[25:59] examples on them because and so I was
[26:02] like you know Malachi and Liam would you
[26:04] like to ride my 450 dirt bike and of
[26:06] course the little dude sing
[26:08] ay going fast yes David please and so I
[26:12] took them we went to the paddock had to
[26:14] hold the dirt bike for brother Malachi
[26:15] to step on and brother Malachi fell off
[26:18] and almost got his leg crushed and then
[26:20] it was brother Lamb's
[26:22] turn and he fell off twice and he said
[26:25] David whenever I fall off I just throw
[26:27] myself away from the bike so it doesn't
[26:29] crush me I mean so we could have seen
[26:31] how they could have become a little bit
[26:33] hurt I mean now we have another one look
[26:38] at this fell is not reading his phone
[26:40] you know it can be very common amongst
[26:42] traies especially it's you know some
[26:45] sort of the bosses they don't never
[26:46] answer their phones so you go to call
[26:48] them at like night time and their phone
[26:49] is dead or something and you know that
[26:51] is very bad cuz we should always answer
[26:53] our phone it's you know it's always good
[26:54] to keep in contact and stuff and but
[26:57] these people never answer their phone I
[26:58] was like man I think it's cool for um I
[27:00] think I'll start not answering my phone
[27:02] either
[27:04] and thank goodness I brother andw who
[27:06] told me no David don't do that you need
[27:08] to answer your phone so here we have a
[27:09] bad example
[27:12] amen and last of
[27:15] all we have these
[27:17] fellows amen these are bad YouTube
[27:20] famous people trying to say how to get
[27:22] rich and rip people off this fellow on
[27:25] the left his one of his great po Sayes
[27:28] is whenever he buys a big he buys
[27:30] massive apartment he's a billionaire in
[27:32] the states and he says whenever first
[27:34] thing he does when he buys a big
[27:35] apartment building is he puts all the
[27:36] rent up heaps so and he's said B and
[27:39] then we have another one this fellow
[27:41] here he um he he scams a lot of people
[27:44] and so those are bad
[27:47] examples of of who to try to be like
[27:51] amen but you know I I
[27:55] trust I trust we can we can will be like
[27:59] look up to these good examples amen that
[28:01] the Lord has has given unto us and
[28:03] they're such a blessing amen and amen
[28:06] we're surrounded by them here amen amen

[35:52] very much
[35:54] M um so my little sermon is going to be
[35:59] a little different I'm going to talk
[36:01] about my testimony I'm just going to
[36:04] share a bit of my testimony uh could
[36:08] we open our Bibles to Revelations
[36:17] 1211 say I when you're
[36:24] there all right Revelations 1211 says
[36:27] just a short scripture and this it says
[36:30] and they overcame him by the blood of
[36:31] the lamb and by the word of their
[36:33] testimony and they love not their lives
[36:34] unto the death I mean you can have your
[36:40] seats so as we all know sharing your
[36:44] testimony is very
[36:45] important and I haven't done that yet so
[36:49] I thought this will be my
[36:51] opportunity um just a quick quote
[36:54] brother brandom says here says all right
[36:56] I can see her she was so happy she
[36:58] wanted to tell somebody else about it
[37:00] trouble of it is the people get saved
[37:02] today and they think well maybe I better
[37:04] keep still my neighbor don't believe in
[37:06] this uh-uh no you never really got saved
[37:09] I don't believe no sir you can't hold it
[37:12] that's right say so I I'm afraid to
[37:14] testify of healing afraid that the
[37:16] doctor won't like it but brother you if
[37:18] you got healed you'll testify about it
[37:21] don't hold it tell it that's right tell
[37:23] that out to somebody else you overcome
[37:25] by the blood of the lamb and your
[37:26] testimony that's how you
[37:28] overcome I believe that let me grab my
[37:32] notes out real
[37:34] quick okay so starting from the start I
[37:38] grew up with my
[37:41] parents brother Ed and sister Lundy very
[37:44] good parents probably the best out there
[37:46] just saying um
[37:49] but growing up Mom and Dad were a little
[37:52] different um as they say I felt the
[37:56] stress they were going through and I was
[37:59] a bit of a different baby not normal um
[38:03] but yeah just growing up Dad had a bit
[38:07] of uh he got angry very quickly bit
[38:09] anger issues and Mom don't remember much
[38:13] because she always just said wait for
[38:15] Dad to get
[38:17] home
[38:19] but I wanted but yo so at the start mom
[38:22] and dad I remember a little bit we went
[38:24] to afrian church just over the railways
[38:27] there and
[38:28] paru and all I remember is my friends
[38:33] and that from there I was actually
[38:35] talking to Mom about it the other day um
[38:38] I think it was brother
[38:41] um yaku he was one of the guys there in
[38:44] the church and we they started talking
[38:47] about I think it was baptism and he went
[38:49] to I think the higher guys in the church
[38:52] because it was like a Dutch reformed
[38:53] like the three mother churches or sister
[38:55] churches kind of mixed together
[38:58] and he went to talk to them and started
[39:00] talking to them about how they read
[39:01] their Bible and all of this and
[39:02] basically they told him that he's
[39:05] reading his Bible wrong and all this
[39:07] kind of stuff and they should stop and
[39:09] uh and then they said he's basically not
[39:11] welcome in the church anymore so then
[39:14] they moved we started doing um Friday
[39:16] night um Bible studies and I remember
[39:20] watching The Three Little Pigs every
[39:21] night we went there um as a as a young
[39:24] kid I can't remember how old I was but
[39:27] then brother Neil which was in the
[39:31] church as well went and he started his
[39:32] own church there I can't remember the
[39:36] place's name but he started a church up
[39:39] there and I think that's where they
[39:41] Rehabilitation for guys with drugs and
[39:43] addictions alcohol all that stuff and
[39:48] brother villum which his wife used to
[39:51] always cut out here so he was I grew up
[39:53] with him and he worked there so they
[39:56] used um their Hall and stuff for church
[39:59] and I remember being friends with
[40:01] brother Neil's daughter and then that
[40:03] church didn't actually last very long
[40:05] end up moving to Oakland and things like
[40:07] that skipping forward a little bit um I
[40:11] remember the first time we walk into sh
[40:15] Tabernacle buckets everywhere as a kid
[40:18] and then what I remember is wanting to
[40:21] go to the bathroom and I had to go all
[40:22] the way back to the of the of the
[40:24] warehouse climb over things and around
[40:28] this corner and that one having to walk
[40:30] a minute to get to the bathroom which
[40:33] wasn't fun
[40:36] um and yeah then obviously the day we
[40:39] were so I grew up with the Davidson
[40:41] family those of you that know them
[40:43] majority of you do um so that
[40:48] is a very old photo but we have Caleb
[40:52] Keegan me Declan and then jonan Eli so
[40:56] me Dean and Keegan with the Three Amigos
[40:59] we about I'm 2 months from apart from
[41:02] Dean and Keegan's 2 months younger than
[41:04] me so I was always the one out just it
[41:09] was always Dean and Keegan teaming up on
[41:11] me and then I was a younger guy um but
[41:15] yeah I remember them being in church and
[41:17] then we we moved over to downstairs on
[41:20] our old
[41:21] building and I remember there that's
[41:24] when I a few late years
[41:27] on um they ended up moving out of the
[41:31] church because they didn't believe
[41:32] anymore brother
[41:34] Brandon and at that time because I was
[41:36] small I didn't really understand uh why
[41:40] or you know the reason behind that they
[41:43] left um once I Grew Older I started
[41:45] asking more questions about it and kind
[41:47] of got the story but it was hard for me
[41:51] because they I mean me and Jesse me well
[41:56] me Keegan and Dean would always wrestle
[41:59] Jesse I remember that one time Jesse
[42:01] actually won all three of all three of
[42:03] us so kudos to Jesse for that one it
[42:06] won't work anymore
[42:08] [Laughter]
[42:10] um but yeah and then they left and then
[42:14] Jesse became too cool to hang out with
[42:17] me that was just a stage it's all right
[42:19] he's all good now
[42:22] um but then I became a bit of a
[42:25] loner and I kind of had to you know make
[42:28] my own friends and eventually it was
[42:30] actually good timing the enanas arrived
[42:33] and I hated k at the start it was me and
[42:36] me and mo where's
[42:38] Mo oh right there yeah me and mo were
[42:41] friends I remember the first time I met
[42:42] them we just come back from a camping
[42:45] trip in tonaki and they run down they're
[42:47] like oh are you Josh are you Josh I'm
[42:49] like yes he's like do you have your
[42:51] guitar I heard you play guitar you're
[42:52] like the guitarist of the church and I'm
[42:54] like who are these guys I have never met
[42:56] them running down know my name know I
[42:59] play guitar it just like and I just
[43:02] arrived there like we went from tanaki
[43:04] straight there for the watch Night
[43:05] Service and there we immediately clicked
[43:09] and it was my two musical buddies and
[43:12] then eventually I moved on from Mo
[43:16] um still mates bro and then K became my
[43:20] best
[43:21] friend and to this day he stands by me
[43:25] um but yeah just I think it was either
[43:28] what year did you guys come 2019 yes so
[43:32] it was the year before 2018 I turned 10
[43:36] and that's when I started thinking about
[43:38] getting
[43:39] baptized and I saw the change in my dad
[43:42] and my mom and I think that's what made
[43:44] me start thinking about it cuz I saw the
[43:47] difference from their baptism I saw the
[43:49] difference in their life the way dad
[43:51] started softening and he didn't get so
[43:54] angry very that quickly anymore and we
[43:57] started fellow fellowshipping a lot
[43:59] around the word and I started having
[44:02] thinking things and and all that you
[44:04] know and I got to understand a lot
[44:08] more
[44:09] um yeah let me
[44:12] just getting baptized oh yes I remember
[44:16] the one time it was me and Dad I think
[44:18] it was me a it was our family driving on
[44:20] the car and I was just looking outside
[44:23] it was on the way back from uh Wednesday
[44:25] night service I was like hold on Dad
[44:28] we're like the moon I was like correct
[44:30] me if I'm wrong we're like the moon and
[44:32] God's the Sun and we he his light
[44:35] reflects through us and it's his life
[44:38] it's his light that comes through us
[44:40] that we reflect the Life of Christ and
[44:42] he's like yes yes you're right and I was
[44:45] like oh Revelation nobody else knows
[44:47] about this I was like yes I was like oh
[44:49] I got to tell brother Ben and then I
[44:53] never did and later on well not too long
[44:56] after I found now he has talking talked
[44:58] about that so many times and I've just
[45:00] missed it that was a bit I was a bit
[45:02] gutted about that but you know that's
[45:04] all right anyway I don't have any photos
[45:08] unfortunately but I ended up getting
[45:10] baptized and from their life started
[45:13] changed you know started changing and I
[45:16] started thinking a lot more spiritually
[45:18] and um that's one thing that me and Dad
[45:20] have in common we like to see the
[45:22] spiritual things and the natural so that
[45:25] I really enjoy that part of it as well
[45:27] being able to you know just go out into
[45:29] nature when you're hunting you're
[45:30] listening to the birds you know maybe
[45:32] just going for a and you just see
[45:35] God and nature you know it's so
[45:37] cool um moving
[45:41] on um we there was a
[45:44] one one time me dad had to drive
[45:48] ourselves to church and I always loved
[45:50] the windy roads like the a aara road and
[45:53] Battle Hill Road I always wanted to
[45:55] drive it J
[45:58] extremely disliked it because he's got
[46:01] classic very easily so then I was oh
[46:03] it's me and Dad let's so we decided I
[46:05] think it was aara road that we drove
[46:08] Battle Hill Battle Hill and now on the
[46:11] last corner there's there's one point
[46:13] where if if those of you that have
[46:15] driven there there's one big drop going
[46:18] fur further in past past going over the
[46:21] part of the ocean and going down then
[46:23] there's a big drop on your left and on
[46:25] the right there's the bank
[46:27] and we come around this one corner and a
[46:31] toota
[46:33] pru that one um came around the corner
[46:37] at a very high speed and merely missed
[46:40] our
[46:40] car and as
[46:44] that I don't have the lyrics um on the
[46:47] slideshow but as that happened the
[46:51] lyrics of uh Casting Crown song One
[46:53] Awkward Moment play and it said one
[46:56] Awkward Moment you'll see the gospel
[46:57] come alive and it was like perfect
[47:00] timing the car passed and we like what
[47:02] happened and those lyrics come pass and
[47:04] I just started crying man I was just
[47:06] like wow this is so cool and I got to
[47:09] church and I immediately just told all
[47:11] my friends like just man this has
[47:13] happened and this all this lyrics played
[47:15] and you know I've always been a musical
[47:17] fellow um so for me that was quite
[47:21] big um and yeah what I missed as well is
[47:26] at the start my for the first two years
[47:28] of my life my granddad and my grandma
[47:31] lived here on my mom's side um and from
[47:34] there that's where I picked up the
[47:36] guitar and when I was six I think it was
[47:39] I went to go get guitar lessons but they
[47:42] said I'm too young so
[47:44] then uh I started learning ukulele
[47:48] instead and then as soon the next year
[47:50] as soon as I could I went and did guitar
[47:52] lessons immediately moved up a level
[47:54] because brother John Davidson who was
[47:56] song leader lead our church with brother
[47:58] Isaac at the time um was yeah playing he
[48:02] was playing guitar and I always because
[48:04] I grew up with him Dean was his son I
[48:07] always got to you I was always playing
[48:08] his guitar I was always learning you
[48:10] know and then I started in the band at 8
[48:13] years old I remember that and the first
[48:16] time I song Lead was when I was 10 so
[48:19] that's back in
[48:20] 2018 and I felt like it was a flop I was
[48:24] like never again in my life like song
[48:27] Lead and then later on a few years later
[48:29] brother Ben came to me and started
[48:30] talking to me and said I should song
[48:32] Lead and I was I'll pray about it about
[48:35] it in my head I was like you're nut like
[48:38] no there's no way and then eventually a
[48:41] few months passed and brother Ben asked
[48:43] me a few more times and I realized okay
[48:46] he hasn't not only asked me once but a
[48:48] few times so I was like okay I'll I'll
[48:50] try and then that first one then it was
[48:53] just the atmosphere was so nice like it
[48:57] was like the first time was at
[48:58] Icebreaker and from then I started song
[49:00] leading a lot and now I song Le I've
[49:03] been song leading for I think two years
[49:05] two years now um but yeah it was just
[49:10] yeah that's basically my testimony
[49:14] um but what I want I wanted to share
[49:17] quick thing as well um just raging camp
[49:20] that passed too um we had a youth like a
[49:24] youth night on Friday night we got to
[49:25] talk about it but
[49:28] those of you that didn't go go next year
[49:30] please it's like it's so good the the
[49:33] unity this year and the last year the
[49:36] first time we went the unity between
[49:38] everyone was just we were all so close
[49:41] it was like we were
[49:43] family and I've seen you before I
[49:45] haven't but it's like I knew you but
[49:48] what's your name again was like it it
[49:49] literally felt like I knew them from
[49:52] somewhere I can't remember where but I
[49:55] know that back before I was born in
[49:58] God's mind we were all there and it was
[50:02] yeah it was just amazing the testimonies
[50:04] that came from that camp as well um you
[50:07] heard Hannah's one about Tamar as well
[50:09] that was really cool to see see her
[50:11] there and then um a few people that um
[50:15] found their purpose their position in
[50:18] Christ a lot of people that were
[50:20] struggling with things for years months
[50:24] um and the Lord answer them and the way
[50:28] that and um there was one particular
[50:31] sister that that couldn't make it to the
[50:34] camp it was impossible for her to come
[50:37] and she prayed and we prayed through
[50:38] with her and she was there and that was
[50:41] so cool to see as well and just big
[50:43] testimonies that came from it and I want
[50:45] to encourage all of you to go and my
[50:49] prayer has been to keep that Revival
[50:51] fire going all the way October Camp then
[50:55] we start as brother Ben and and some
[50:56] other brothers have said you start on
[50:58] the plus 10 you come out on the plus 100
[51:01] 110 and then you keep building building
[51:04] and then the next Camp you're there back
[51:06] on 200 and you know just keep building
[51:09] and that's my prayer that we just that
[51:11] Revival fire keep going and then
