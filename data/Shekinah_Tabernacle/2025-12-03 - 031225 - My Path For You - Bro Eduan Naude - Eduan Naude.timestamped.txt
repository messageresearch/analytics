[28:33] Thank you, brother Fish. I think it's
[28:34] now the second time that I've I'm here
[28:37] as a first. So, as a first, Brother Fish
[28:40] has led us into some songs and some
[28:43] worship. It's awesome. I see myself as a
[28:46] privileged man.
[28:48] Thank you so much for um the privilege,
[28:50] Brother Ben, that I can be here. Um
[28:53] Josh, you can Oh, are you good there?
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. Hey,
[29:00] &gt;&gt; you want to have this? I was just trying
[29:02] to um be technical and um all of the
[29:05] above. Um
[29:09] if you want to turn your Bibles to
[29:11] Deuteronomy 5:33,
[29:16] I need Yes, please.
[29:22] Deuteronomy
[29:23] 5 verse 33.
[29:33] Thank you.
[29:41] Amen. Who's had a good day?
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Good day.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; One day closer to heaven.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Let's read, shall we? You shall walk in
[29:53] all the ways which the Lord your God
[29:55] hath commanded you, that you may live,
[29:58] and that it may be well with you, and
[30:00] that ye may prolong your days in the
[30:03] land which you shall possess.
[30:07] May the Lord add the blessing to his
[30:09] words. You may have your seats.
[30:14] Um, the Lord's worked
[30:17] um on a thought. Who likes testimonies?
[30:20] I love testimonies. I really I really do
[30:23] love testimonies and um it is it's
[30:27] unique and it's personal and it's so no
[30:30] one can take it away from you. And that
[30:32] I like it's so it's so honest and so
[30:35] true. And the Lord said um he actually
[30:39] gave me a little photo. He he brought a
[30:41] photo in remembrance of my of my yes
[30:45] here and u [clears throat] I thought um
[30:48] maybe I should share a little bit of my
[30:52] testimony and a little bit of my path
[30:54] and from there we'll we'll bring it home
[30:58] as to as to speak. So, if you would
[31:01] allow me um to uh to I guess talk a
[31:05] little bit freely and just share a
[31:07] little thought and and and in particular
[31:09] this um uh this this memory I guess and
[31:13] the path how the Lord led me to to this
[31:16] point in my life. Um yeah, if you if you
[31:20] would be so gracious. So,
[31:24] one thing um brother Isaac, he's not
[31:26] here. Um but his sermon on confidence
[31:30] was was really good. Um brother Ben, you
[31:33] said it. It was a masterpiece. I I have
[31:35] to amen. It was really good. And um
[31:39] we've got we've got confidence in this
[31:41] word. We've got confidence in where we
[31:43] where we we stand, where we at there,
[31:45] where you sitting right now. You've got
[31:47] confidence in what the Lord's done in
[31:48] your life, what he's doing right now.
[31:50] And as long as you open your heart and
[31:53] let him work in you, um you'll you'll
[31:56] have even more confidence. Now,
[32:00] this is me. That's this is what I like
[32:02] to do sometimes. Um would a little fun
[32:06] fact. How many times do you think
[32:08] Brother Isaac said the word confidence
[32:11] or confident in his sermon? Anyone want
[32:14] to take a guess? Yes, Lilia.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; 150.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; 150. Very close. So the word confidence
[32:22] was 116 times. The word confident was
[32:26] 284. So those with quick maths 364
[32:30] times he said the word confident or
[32:32] confidence including the title that I
[32:35] sneakily put in there. So almost one
[32:38] time a day for the entire year that you
[32:42] need to be confident and have confidence
[32:44] in this word. So thank you brother
[32:47] Isaac. I really enjoyed it. I started
[32:49] listening to it again and I was just it
[32:51] was really um
[32:54] uh insp um just inspired. Yes. Um prior
[32:58] to that, brother Isaac also um we we
[33:01] were talking about um his his prior
[33:03] service and he mentioned I think he was
[33:05] baptized when he was 12. Is that what he
[33:07] said? Yeah. So, and I thought, "Oh, yes.
[33:10] I think I was baptized when I was not
[33:12] baptized. I gave my heart to the Lord
[33:14] when I was 12." So with the knowledge
[33:16] that I have and the and the in the
[33:18] denomination where I was um you know I
[33:21] told him yeah no I think I was 12 as
[33:23] well. I remember I think it was 1992 and
[33:27] then I remembered there was this photo
[33:30] not a photo a little card that I had in
[33:32] my Bible of the date
[33:36] and I found it. So there is Ianodia
[33:40] where I lived in 1994. So I was 13. I
[33:45] wasn't 12 at that time and um in the in
[33:49] K is um here oh Dutch reformed K in
[33:53] Zanin and my dad was my was my counselor
[33:58] was um it just so happened that that
[34:01] there was an evening and there was a
[34:03] visiting minister and there was this tug
[34:05] of my heart and I thought I have to heed
[34:08] to this now long story short dad didn't
[34:13] I think there was a few people and he
[34:15] was uh uh running around to to sort of
[34:19] help and counsel and and pray with the
[34:21] other people. So, he didn't get around
[34:23] to me standing on the one side. But then
[34:27] afterwards when we left home, we sat
[34:30] down and I was in my room. He said, "Was
[34:32] there something that that happened? was
[34:34] it something that we, you know, and he
[34:36] came in and we sat and we actually
[34:37] filled this in at home which was which
[34:40] was for me it was special that uh we
[34:42] could do that and I thought um yeah um
[34:46] it was quite nice that I had this little
[34:48] this little thing in my Bible. So again
[34:51] with the knowledge that I had um and how
[34:54] it was presented to me this was a this
[34:57] was this was my first steps basically of
[35:00] of being a Christian. You probably can't
[35:02] read there at the top, but it says sort
[35:04] of uh this evening I've I've recognized
[35:07] or I've realized that Jesus Christ is my
[35:10] savior, my redeemer, and that he will
[35:12] forgive my sins and he will just redeem
[35:15] me from all the sins and uh he will he
[35:18] will um adopt me as his um and then he
[35:24] will never leave me nor forsake me which
[35:26] is which is awesome and I thought oh wow
[35:28] nice. Now coming back to the date 1994 I
[35:32] was 12 uh 13 sorry that means you got a
[35:36] testimony you young ones you're already
[35:38] working with your testimony you've got a
[35:40] testimony and it's powerful treasure it
[35:44] build on it protect it you know be m
[35:47] make it make it um don't hide it um be
[35:52] very um gracious what the Lord is doing
[35:55] in your life and this is this is where
[35:58] the bride starts moving. This is where
[36:01] um testimonies of the past come together
[36:03] where some of the bride at a particular
[36:07] date in their life what happens some
[36:09] events that was significant and then it
[36:13] brings you to to this present present
[36:16] hour. Now that was not the picture that
[36:20] the Lord brought to me to remembrance
[36:23] but this one was.
[36:27] Now that's that's us there as a team. I
[36:31] I did service here for Christ. Uh we
[36:34] called it DJC.
[36:36] Uh DJC. Yes. Yeah. But that was now in
[36:40] Africans for so um you were you was you
[36:44] were a servant or you you were did
[36:46] service for Jesus and uh through
[36:50] adventure through music through outreach
[36:53] in this case through drama and in this
[36:57] particular um case can you can you see
[37:00] where am I? Can can you should I should
[37:03] I make it quite obvious?
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Um
[37:07] &gt;&gt; is it or is it Josh? I thought I could
[37:10] see a little bit of both in there.
[37:11] Anyway,
[37:13] they're definitely my sons. E, so
[37:15] [snorts]
[37:16] a little bit of background. This was
[37:17] this was in 2000. This was Y2K and I I
[37:23] did service year for Christ two years.
[37:25] This was my second year. And I
[37:30] always there was always drama around me.
[37:32] I was part of the drama team. But in
[37:34] this case, they made the drama team an
[37:36] outreach team as well. And there was
[37:38] always one team that will go outreach
[37:41] outside of South Africa and in this case
[37:44] in that particular instance we are
[37:46] sitting in Amsterdam
[37:49] and the previous year was in Russia. So
[37:51] I was actually quite excited if we can
[37:53] go back to Russia but then it changed
[37:55] and went we went to Amsterdam. So um
[37:58] very very special and I treasure moments
[38:01] like this where we served. Um, a little
[38:05] bit more detail is that obviously it
[38:08] costed a lot of money to get there and
[38:10] we just you know from South Africa with
[38:12] the rand it it was always hard to get
[38:14] all the funds and just before we left we
[38:18] we prayed and we fasted and I think it
[38:20] was about three days three days and
[38:22] three nights and from memory it was the
[38:26] last day that that Kristoff our leader
[38:28] oh I don't think he's in that photo um
[38:32] he said that we made we got all the
[38:34] funds and we as a team as a collective
[38:37] we could all go um on the outreach which
[38:40] was which was awesome. So
[38:43] what I'm trying to say is from a young
[38:44] age testimonies came and and nothing
[38:48] like that could change. You know I
[38:49] remember him showing us how much do we
[38:52] owe him saying hey this is this is what
[38:54] the scripture says. Let's do this. We
[38:56] got together every time the the team ate
[38:59] and we were there at the hookie. So that
[39:01] was in Ptoria. So
[39:04] um and and I'll get now to why I'm
[39:06] pointing there. um we they would eat
[39:10] dinner and lunch and whatever and we'll
[39:12] gather together we'll and we'll pray and
[39:14] and just have our minds on this and yes
[39:17] that's the evidence of that we made it
[39:18] there um so yes so it was this this
[39:22] photo that came to remembrance and at
[39:24] that moment I how my mind works is like
[39:28] the location I map the location oh where
[39:30] was this yes this was in in um Amsterdam
[39:35] in a place called the cliff. Now there's
[39:38] the cliff. So any of you that's been in
[39:41] Amsterdam before?
[39:43] Ah, Omar is here. God bless you, Omar.
[39:46] Oh, nice. Okay, so if I say Dalan,
[39:50] that's it's a it's a little rocky place.
[39:54] This is the end. I like to say this is
[39:56] the end of the red light district
[39:58] actually. And you're looking towards the
[40:01] the red light district. So if you don't
[40:04] know what's a red light district, may
[40:06] young ones, may your parents enlighten
[40:08] you. Now there were paths to to this
[40:11] cliff uh that we could take and
[40:13] obviously we could go through the red
[40:15] light district. We try to prevent that
[40:17] as much as possible.
[40:19] It broke your heart when you walk
[40:21] through there. So the cleft was there
[40:24] for those that was a safe haven for
[40:27] people that's had a bad background
[40:30] that's not just bums but just had a
[40:32] history of of really being uh taken
[40:36] advantage of and and really abused and
[40:40] um so this was actually a very very
[40:42] special place the cliff I was actually
[40:45] very surprised when I could find that on
[40:47] on Google maps
[40:50] Now,
[40:52] the main aim, and I'll I'll go back
[40:54] here, cuz you'll see what we we're busy
[40:56] doing. Um, we're busy making some some
[40:59] lunch. We busy preparing some sandwiches
[41:02] with ham. And is it is it peanut sauce?
[41:05] What do you call in in Dutch? You had
[41:08] that special peanut butter.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; There we go. Pinda Pinda sauce or
[41:13] pindagas. Yeah. Um, which people loved.
[41:16] So that's me with the knife there with
[41:19] some with that on my on my knife. Um we
[41:23] prepared lunch and so the one
[41:26] mission was to just play some games with
[41:29] these people that didn't have place to
[41:32] go or maybe has been um abused or just
[41:36] want to get away from life. Now for us
[41:39] here's our safe haven. Here we get
[41:41] together. Here we can have fellowship.
[41:43] For them they didn't have a outcome. Oh,
[41:46] and then just across the street is that
[41:48] big church. Uh oh, I can't remember the
[41:51] name, but it's it's a massive church. Um
[41:55] there's actually a lot of churches
[41:56] around in in Amsterdam, which is which
[41:58] is amazing. Um so our mission was to sit
[42:03] and play chess, get out a board game or
[42:05] something like that, just play with
[42:06] them, just talk with them. Uh and then
[42:09] there was one of the rules was you never
[42:11] never speak about the Bible. You never
[42:14] talk about the Bible or Christendom or
[42:16] anything like that which forced you to
[42:18] be the life that forced you to be here's
[42:21] the testimony. I'm preaching the gospel
[42:23] with what you see in front of you. So
[42:28] again very special to us that that we
[42:30] could have a time like that. And then if
[42:34] I go back to that photo of the cliff you
[42:36] will see little steps going up on the
[42:38] right. And that photo of what we've been
[42:41] preparing is just past that glass. And
[42:44] by then there's there at the bottom
[42:46] there's some steps uh some a basin
[42:50] basement and we'll we'll get together
[42:52] we'll split the teams. So those that's
[42:55] at the top that's busy with um with the
[42:57] people and so we've got the other team
[42:59] that's praying for us for praying for
[43:02] the people that's busy upstairs to stand
[43:04] in the gap and give us an opportunity.
[43:07] And so so we we did this and this was uh
[43:10] two or three months that we that we
[43:12] would do this once a week or so. So very
[43:15] very special and
[43:18] yeah there I just sort of put the put
[43:20] the two together. Now rewind.
[43:24] Oh, did I miss now? Oh my I missed one
[43:28] photo. Sorry.
[43:30] Okay. There's one photo
[43:34] that is from 1999. So it was basically a
[43:37] year before this year prior this with
[43:40] this uh long a photo of taken in
[43:44] Marcelsport. Now we're back in South
[43:46] Africa and this long string of cars,
[43:48] this long convoy of cars and comies and
[43:51] utes and everything and we are on our
[43:54] way to to somewhere and in that convoy
[43:59] was none other than sister Lundy was one
[44:02] in one of those comies with me but not
[44:06] with me just with service here. And I'll
[44:11] share this for you.
[44:13] Right here at the bottom is where that
[44:15] convoy was. It's called Marcel Sport.
[44:17] It's very close to Bloom Fontaine.
[44:20] And I started thinking, ooh, Bloom
[44:22] Fontaine. That's not too far from where
[44:24] by the Arman Shantel lived. And I
[44:27] started putting all these little
[44:29] pictures together or where would they
[44:31] have been at this time. [clears throat]
[44:33] This is about December December uh 1999.
[44:37] So the second um little circle there is
[44:41] Tennison as where brother Arman grew up
[44:44] and the third one right at the top is
[44:46] Valkum was where sister Shantel was. So
[44:49] all amongst this at that very time we
[44:52] were about 120 kilometers uh apart. So
[44:57] they're highlighted there at the top
[44:58] right. So just from another n from
[45:02] another angle here's Marcus right at the
[45:05] bottom left and then tion and valkum.
[45:08] Now all of a sudden when I started
[45:09] playing with the maps I'm going oh but
[45:11] that's porch and is is sister puling not
[45:14] from porch. So I go that
[45:19] &gt;&gt; hey
[45:21] &gt;&gt; okay
[45:23] &gt;&gt; oh the previous slide.
[45:26] Oh well there we go.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[45:31] &gt;&gt; So, and that's that that's what
[45:33] triggered this thought. I I go, we are
[45:35] all from here. Tolly, you want to put up
[45:38] that little video
[45:42] and I'll show you
[45:45] what the whole aim was? No.
[45:48] So there's Valk from Tennison to Valk
[45:51] and then from Valk we've got Joberg you
[45:54] know the mile and a lot brother MO and
[45:57] then from Joberg we had Nigeria and we
[46:01] had even Nairobi and people there all
[46:05] the other way on the other side of the
[46:06] globe we've got uh family from uh from
[46:10] uh South Korea coming back and all of
[46:14] them ends up here
[46:16] here in in crazy Willington. Thank you.
[46:20] Is that all right? I've got a big head.
[46:23] So, uh yeah, we'll have to work on that.
[46:26] That's all right. It'll make it work.
[46:29] So,
[46:30] so the whole just by that I just wanted
[46:33] to show that from a from a globe and I
[46:35] wish I could just get all these little
[46:38] uh uh lines drawn that's coming from all
[46:41] walks of life, all cultures. We didn't
[46:44] know a bar of soap from each other and
[46:46] now we ended up here. Now, if we can
[46:51] flip back to that. Um, yes, thank you,
[46:54] Tia.
[46:57] If um,
[47:00] what I want to show there is the path.
[47:02] The path. Everyone's got a path.
[47:04] Everyone's the Lord's chosen a path for
[47:06] you and you are walking it. And you
[47:10] don't know sometimes why. You don't know
[47:13] sometimes when and where and how did I
[47:15] end up here? What what's the reason for
[47:18] this? It's not always negative, but like
[47:22] how the Lord physically took us and my
[47:24] path where I was still in South Africa
[47:28] where we did some outreach. I was even
[47:30] thinking about Hillbrow. So the previous
[47:32] year 1999 we did the outreach in Hilbrow
[47:35] Hillbrow Joberg Center. Joberg um you
[47:40] wake up with gunshots and people dead in
[47:43] the street and you know it was quite
[47:45] quite real. We got shot on as well. Um
[47:49] there was a we came from a church and um
[47:51] yeah so anyway but some [sighs] we we
[47:56] were there to just give a little bit of
[47:57] a light just be a little bit of hope you
[48:00] know um children that's at a at a early
[48:03] childhood center they get dropped off
[48:05] 6:00 in the morning maybe they get
[48:07] picked up that night you know it's one
[48:09] of those that and you the only little
[48:12] glimmer of hope all I did for one day I
[48:14] remember was just the the boys running
[48:17] around actually boys and girls running
[48:19] around this crash and I'll grab them and
[48:21] I'll yank them and then you know on the
[48:24] monkey bars or throw them or do
[48:27] something. I was tired. I was phys. I
[48:30] couldn't feel my arms. They just wanted
[48:32] that physical that interaction that
[48:34] touch that hey there's someone that's
[48:36] not hurting me. Here's someone that's
[48:38] loving me, you know.
[48:42] And it's um
[48:44] what we what we have is just tremendous.
[48:49] [clears throat]
[48:51] &gt;&gt; So sometimes I feel like this this is my
[48:55] life. I feel like the big old burnt
[48:58] stump, a lot of lot of ashes and
[49:00] everything around me. So there's a lot
[49:02] of uh a death that had to happen. But
[49:05] then through that all you have this this
[49:08] little green that comes out that the
[49:09] little uh a path that changes you know a
[49:12] season that changes. So from our
[49:15] physical path is obviously in our
[49:17] spiritual journey we've got the same. So
[49:19] how many times that we stop and wonder
[49:21] and ask God why did this happen? Why
[49:24] here? Why New Zealand? Why do we come
[49:27] here? you know, my thought of why we're
[49:30] coming to New Zealand and the Lords were
[49:33] were polar opposites. And um so I I
[49:36] guess he had a bit of a giggle when when
[49:38] you think, you know, oh yeah, this Ed,
[49:40] he's he's coming here to, you know, save
[49:42] the world and be a role model for
[49:44] whoever, you know, like no, this is
[49:46] where I'm going to start with your
[49:48] journey to becoming a man of God, to
[49:50] becoming a a a a husband, to become a a
[49:54] priest, a prophet, a someone that that
[49:56] that's steadfast in in the walk um of
[49:59] the Lord. So
[50:02] we all come to the same place. So we all
[50:04] come from all over the world but we come
[50:06] spiritually to the same place. That
[50:09] bride that's adorned in white that seat
[50:11] at the table that meeting in the air
[50:14] that is where we're coming um together
[50:17] [clears throat] as Christians
[50:20] as the bride as a body of believers. So
[50:22] we are you had to go on this certain
[50:25] path. You had to walk this walk. You had
[50:28] to uh cross paths with people. Maybe you
[50:32] had to uh stop maybe so that people can
[50:35] seed or sew a seed in your life, you
[50:38] know. Um you could get to a point where
[50:42] uh where he wanted he wants you uh he
[50:46] wants you to get to a to a point in your
[50:48] life where he wants you and then that
[50:51] certain character can be built and
[50:53] that's it and and you can be formed and
[50:56] developed even further.
[50:59] What what came to mind in that in that
[51:02] in that moment where of the refining and
[51:05] the and the and the character building
[51:07] and how the Lord is shaping and forming
[51:09] us through our paths and where we have
[51:12] to go for a certain reason and talk to
[51:14] people and and interact and fellowship
[51:18] is that that that Jesus was God made
[51:21] manifest and through that. So he wanted
[51:24] to he is pressing now to become that in
[51:28] us.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; He wants to be God manifest. He wants to
[51:32] manifest himself through your life.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; And bec you have to do this journey. You
[51:38] know, whether you like it or not, you
[51:40] have to go because the Lord wants you at
[51:43] a certain point in your life to be
[51:45] unique enough to be a personality and
[51:48] everything that comes together, that
[51:49] beautiful bouquet of flowers to talk to
[51:52] someone to to to to have a channel or
[51:55] opportunity to say, you know, Ed, he's
[51:58] he's he's meant to talk to this little
[52:01] Johnny at this moment in time. their
[52:03] crosswalk path at this moment in time.
[52:05] His character will be built and his and
[52:07] his life will be such a such a place and
[52:10] such a testimony that it will impact
[52:13] little Johnny no with the sisters as
[52:16] well.
[52:18] Um and brother Brandham talks about
[52:20] this. know I I I was busy with uh life
[52:25] path of life the path of life the the
[52:26] the and and it and it sort of struck me
[52:30] um I wasn't listening to it for this uh
[52:33] sermon but it was so so fitting he was
[52:36] talking about um a letter that someone
[52:39] wrote to him 22 pages very critical
[52:43] saying um didn't address him as brother
[52:45] or anything like that or just respectful
[52:47] it was just saying Brandham and he was
[52:50] talking about his grammar. He was
[52:52] talking about even the fact that he said
[52:54] that Satan couldn't heal and and it was
[52:57] just taking him on, you know. Now, look
[53:01] at the path that he has to take now. So,
[53:03] so listen now to what I'm saying in
[53:05] terms of physically and and spiritually
[53:08] the path he's taking. He's receiving
[53:09] this 22 pager and going through that.
[53:13] And he replies now and he responds
[53:17] just with two pages. And within that two
[53:20] pages he said to the best of his
[53:21] abilities he was you know scratching as
[53:23] he says and he was he was trying to to
[53:26] to incorporate and give some love. So
[53:29] he's come now from a path from 33 to
[53:32] about I think it was 62 or something
[53:34] this message that he had to take to get
[53:37] to this point
[53:39] &gt;&gt; to be able to write this letter but not
[53:42] to to to write this letter to get now a
[53:45] response back saying I we invite you
[53:49] come
[53:50] &gt;&gt; now it's changed now there was this very
[53:53] critical to oh wait a minute he's human
[53:56] he wants he's he's talking he's he's
[53:59] there's there's something in him and he
[54:02] goes and fellowships with them and they
[54:04] get they have questions they're from
[54:06] this Lutheran college and the deans got
[54:09] question and the brother asked for
[54:10] forgiveness that he had this 22 pager
[54:14] written you know and brother Brham
[54:15] forgave him immediately and said I will
[54:17] never hold this against you prayed at
[54:20] that at that college
[54:23] um and and there was a particular order
[54:26] that he told them cuz they wanted to
[54:28] have the Holy Ghost. They were asking
[54:30] this Pentecostals is jumping up and
[54:32] down. What do they have? And he said the
[54:34] Holy Ghost. Now this Lutheran, what do
[54:36] they have? And he said the Holy Ghost.
[54:38] And they they were they were now
[54:39] stunned. How? Why? How? So we want the
[54:43] Holy Ghost. And he gave them a a an
[54:46] instruction. And at that point, 40 of
[54:49] them at that time received the Holy
[54:51] Ghost right there. So that's someone
[54:56] with a sincere heart. And that's someone
[54:58] looking from this Lutheran and the
[55:00] journey that he took, the path that he
[55:02] took and the you know maybe a a
[55:05] different spirit that was on him. But
[55:07] then that sincerity came and something
[55:10] struck the heart and there was a tug and
[55:12] he said uh he's changed his mind. Please
[55:16] forgive me. Show me how can I have this
[55:20] this uh uh baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[55:24] So, and I think he said something like
[55:26] they went on to be 500 um strong that
[55:30] that was that was baptized uh uh and and
[55:33] received the Holy Ghost. So, praise the
[55:35] Lord for that.
[55:37] And just to refer back to uh a little
[55:41] story in the from the Bible
[55:44] um
[55:47] Simeon. So this is from the message I
[55:52] think expectation. Yes.
[55:56] Says yes Lord. He laid it down. So uh
[56:02] it'll color in the picture.
[56:04] That was the voice of the Holy Ghost. I
[56:06] can hear Simeon say up. Start walking.
[56:09] Where Lord? Just walk. I'll take care of
[56:12] the rest. How am I going to walk um
[56:15] after I get out of the stretcher? I
[56:17] don't know. He will take care of the
[56:19] rest. See, just start walking when he
[56:22] tells you. How am I going to get up out
[56:24] of this wheelchair? How am I going to
[56:26] get over cancer and heart trouble? How
[56:29] am I going to tell my mother if I get
[56:31] the Holy Ghost and my daddy? They belong
[56:33] in a different church.
[56:35] Just get it. He will take care of the
[56:38] rest. You see, you don't have to worry
[56:40] about that. He will take care of it. You
[56:43] How am I going to face school and my
[56:44] playmates? Don't worry. Just keep going.
[56:47] He will take care of that.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Simeon raises up and there he starts not
[56:51] knowing where's he going, just walking.
[56:54] But the Holy Ghost is directing his
[56:55] steps. Don't you believe men are led by
[56:58] the spirit of God? They that are the
[57:00] sons of God asks. Is that right? Here he
[57:04] comes not knowing where is he going, but
[57:06] he's led by the spirit of God. He moves
[57:08] over into that line of circumcision
[57:10] coming down his mother. Here he stand he
[57:13] starts walking down not knowing where's
[57:15] he going. The Holy Ghost is leading him.
[57:17] And the Holy Ghost brought him right
[57:19] straight before this little despised
[57:21] mother standing there with this baby sat
[57:24] swaddling cloth. I can hear the Holy
[57:26] Ghost say, "This is it." He reached over
[57:30] and got the baby in his arms, took it to
[57:32] Mary's arms, tears rolling down a a
[57:35] white beard, said, "Lord, let thy
[57:37] servant depart in peace according to thy
[57:40] word, for my eyes have seen thy
[57:43] salvation." That's right. the word
[57:45] spurnt out but and and that man loved
[57:48] it. The same thing today the the world
[57:52] uh spurns the baptism of the spirit and
[57:54] the works of the Holy Ghost but there's
[57:56] hungry hearts that's coming to it and
[57:59] moving to it.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Now look the same Holy Ghost not there's
[58:03] no two Holy Spirits there's only one.
[58:06] And the same Holy Spirit that gave um
[58:09] Simeon that promise is the same Holy
[58:11] Spirit that's drawn you out here
[58:14] tonight. He made you come, sister, and
[58:17] to you, sister. And you and you and you
[58:18] and all of you that's here tonight in
[58:20] Shik Shikina tabernacle. He brought you
[58:23] here. The devil would never bring you
[58:26] around a place like this. I'll guarantee
[58:28] you that the Holy Ghost brought you
[58:30] here. If you believe in divine healing,
[58:33] then the Holy Spirit brought you where
[58:35] the fountains open just like he did
[58:38] Simeon.
[58:40] You embraced God's promise like Simeon
[58:42] did.
[58:44] Now, as the musicians would come,
[58:48] that's good. I didn't want to b you too
[58:50] long and I didn't want to share too much
[58:52] of my of my testimony. I'll give you
[58:55] just little um little nuggets, you know,
[58:57] so to keep you curious.
[59:00] But now we are the ones that are
[59:03] pointing the way. We are the ones
[59:06] showing the signs. We are the ones
[59:07] throwing a pebble into the water so it
[59:10] starts rippling. Someone else is on this
[59:13] path. Someone else is on their own
[59:15] little journey that they need to get
[59:17] here and come here. And throughout your
[59:20] own life together with the Lord, they
[59:23] were ones that helped you to get where
[59:25] you are today. So now remember young
[59:28] ones and older ones. I mean brother
[59:31] Colin is young because he started now in
[59:33] the youth band. Your life is a
[59:35] testimony. It is important. No one can
[59:39] change your story. It is lifech
[59:42] changing. So go and preach the gospel
[59:46] with your life.
[59:48] Amen. And God bless you. May we have a
[59:53] time of prayer. It's definitely needed.
[59:56] Uh we are a needy people and I think uh
[1:00:01] Satan knows his days are numbered.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; So may we really enter I I really enjoy
[1:00:08] our prayer uh evenings here. I really
[1:00:11] feel like we are entering in and we we
[1:00:13] are we are leaving here victorious every
[1:00:15] time there's an answer to prayer. So let
[1:00:19] us sing a song and I'll invite um
[1:00:22] brother Ben for the fish you can come
[1:00:23] up. Um, I'll invite Brother Ben to just
[1:00:26] go through the go through the um prayer
[1:00:29] requests.

[1:04:00] Appreciate that. Looking forward to part
[1:04:02] two. Isn't it amazing, though? Look at
[1:04:05] that map. [music] God's children are
[1:04:07] all, you know, around.
[1:04:10] God God's hand is upon them all. You
[1:04:12] [music] know, when I came, I didn't even
[1:04:14] know the there was such a thing as a
[1:04:16] message when I was growing up. I went to
[1:04:18] the high school right across the road
[1:04:20] from where from a you know, the gospel
[1:04:22] tape ministry there in Gisbon, you know,
[1:04:24] where that was the mecca of the message
[1:04:26] in New Zealand. I was going to school
[1:04:27] right there. I was in Gisbon probably
[1:04:29] kicking around where the leaves were
[1:04:30] somewhere without even knowing it, you
[1:04:33] know, but God had his hand on us all and
[1:04:35] he's guided us and amen. Praise God for
[1:04:37] that. Amen. So, let's um let's just read
[1:04:39] the prayer request and um if you have a
[1:04:43] sorry, there's a bit of a loop or
[1:04:44] something going on here. Um [snorts]
[1:04:46] just want to read
[1:05:21] What I [singing] see, [music]
