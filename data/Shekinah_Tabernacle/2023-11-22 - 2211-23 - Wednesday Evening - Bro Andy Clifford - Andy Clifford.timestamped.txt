[27:59] and you know it's a prayer meeting
[28:00] tonight so we're just getting prepared
[28:03] to wage war upon the enemy amen
[28:07] hallelujah you know sometimes we get
[28:09] caught up in the human level and we're
[28:10] praying for all these people but we
[28:12] don't realize that it's Satan that's
[28:14] attacking the people and he gets away
[28:16] you say all these prayers and you pray
[28:17] and you're praying for people and people
[28:19] and things but actually the target is on
[28:22] the devil and when the target's fully on
[28:23] him and you recognize your position then
[28:26] you see results but we're also going to
[28:28] speak on a couple of things tonight that
[28:30] is going to help you unlock the
[28:32] supernatural in your life in a greater
[28:35] measure in a greater way Hallelujah by
[28:37] the Lord's
[28:39] Grace that's in the notes anyway you
[28:42] never know what the Lord might
[28:44] do you know how it goes if you pull and
[28:47] you got needs then you
[28:49] pull amen are you with me are we
[28:52] together we're together again just
[28:56] praising the Lord
[28:58] amen hallelujah I won't leave you
[29:00] standing too long but I want to speak
[29:01] tonight on a subject called wrestling
[29:04] with
[29:06] surrender wrestling with surrender come
[29:10] on Hallelujah and and I had this this
[29:13] was already in motion this was already
[29:16] um planned you know that that was
[29:18] already well uh in the uh wine seller
[29:21] getting sweeter and vintage was getting
[29:23] and then Ben finishes his sermon on
[29:26] wrestling with the angel and I thought
[29:29] Lord you definitely got some plans
[29:33] Hallelujah and so I was getting excited
[29:35] cuz Ben was just preaching all my notes
[29:37] and
[29:38] everything I thought man praise God but
[29:40] I'm just going to preach it as it was so
[29:42] as it is amen so let's just turn our
[29:45] Bibles to Mark 8: 34-35 and amen or you
[29:49] can just read it on here and when he had
[29:52] called the people unto him with his
[29:54] disciples also he said unto them
[29:57] whosoever will come after me let him or
[30:02] her deny himself or deny
[30:06] herself and take up hers or his cross
[30:09] and follow
[30:11] me for whosoever will save his life
[30:14] shall lose it but whosoever shall lose
[30:17] his life for my sake and the gospels the
[30:22] same shall save it amen you may be
[30:25] seated Hallelujah
[30:28] isn't he good to us isn't he a wonderful
[30:30] God he's just so
[30:32] faithful oh boy there's people calling
[30:35] me oh my praise God he is so faithful
[30:39] he's faithful to his word he's faithful
[30:41] in all things amen and I believe that
[30:43] tonight the subject that he's got for us
[30:46] is not just so that we can sit here Al
[30:48] loan but this subject is in is so that
[30:51] we can have an experience with him in a
[30:53] further
[30:54] surrender all of us there is no one in
[30:57] this room that doesn't need to surrender
[30:59] something oh yes and sometimes you don't
[31:02] know sometimes you don't know and
[31:04] there's a I'm we'll just get into it but
[31:06] like you know like sometimes you you're
[31:08] just going about and you're busy but
[31:10] there's things that are holding you back
[31:11] and you wonder why that you always
[31:14] struggling I was listening to why people
[31:16] so tossed about today and the prophet
[31:18] was speaking about um you know he had
[31:21] that question he was like man cuz you
[31:24] know when you get saved and I'm just
[31:25] going to speak for myself here I I can
[31:27] identify brother brandom you get so so
[31:30] so so saved that there's you're just in
[31:32] Christ and you're always rejoicing right
[31:36] and it was it was simple it happened in
[31:38] one experience for me and it can happen
[31:40] to all of you all of us and and and so
[31:44] brother brandom had this question he was
[31:45] like why are people so tossed about all
[31:48] these Pentecostal ministers and
[31:50] everything in his day struggling with
[31:52] adulteries and struggling with this and
[31:53] struggling all over the place
[31:55] high-profile low everybody that's right
[31:57] and he's like why and he asked the
[31:59] question he preached it and he said
[32:00] because the entire Christian walk is
[32:03] based upon rest but to truly and
[32:06] unequivocally enter into rest we must be
[32:10] totally surrendered and to totally
[32:12] surrender we must totally trust and to
[32:16] totally trust I'm not just talking about
[32:18] up here because every single one in this
[32:20] room unless you're not really caring
[32:21] about these things but everyone in this
[32:24] room totally trusts the Lord up here
[32:27] and in your soul but the problem is down
[32:29] in your
[32:30] subconscious that's where the problem
[32:32] lies that's where the battle lies and
[32:34] it's those little written things in your
[32:36] subconscious or experiences and things
[32:38] that you've had in your life or
[32:40] dysfunctional upbringings or
[32:41] dysfunctional masculinity or
[32:43] dysfunctional femininity and all that
[32:45] stuff that's all out there corruption
[32:47] and a lot of us have been brought up
[32:48] under those things and have been exposed
[32:50] to those things or been molested or
[32:51] we've been hurt or we've been
[32:53] broken and yet we come to the Lord and
[32:55] we've been healed and we have a glor
[32:57] glorious time but yet locked up down
[32:59] there is still that thing until God
[33:01] deals with it or until you're willing to
[33:03] let him deal with it and maybe there's
[33:05] things that you can't surrender you find
[33:07] it so hard to surrender it's because
[33:09] deep down in your subconscious there is
[33:12] a struggle to trust God as a father or
[33:16] God as a husband or maybe you're
[33:18] struggling to
[33:20] surrender to become the Bride of Jesus
[33:22] Christ there's a lot of things right
[33:24] I'll cover a few I can't promise that
[33:26] I'll cover everything but we'll just be
[33:29] obedient to the inspiration of the Holy
[33:31] Spirit are you with me Lord hallelujah
[33:34] amen you know Jesus Christ and I want to
[33:36] just I'm just going to make a
[33:39] statement Jesus Christ is totally
[33:43] trustworthy on every level amen I want
[33:47] you all to say that with me Jesus Christ
[33:50] is totally trustworthy on every
[33:55] level if you just say say that and
[33:58] believe that I don't know it sounds like
[34:00] you know like some psychological thing
[34:02] like confess and confession and
[34:03] confession but if you just speak that
[34:05] and believe that it will actually anchor
[34:07] down in your in your heart and your
[34:10] subconscious because it's it's trust and
[34:13] Ben was hitting it hard it's trust and I
[34:17] pray that tonight if there is mistrust
[34:19] down in your heart that God will heal
[34:21] you so that you can truly surrender so
[34:23] that you can stop being tied to the
[34:24] world so that you can stop struggling up
[34:26] up and down like a roller coaster
[34:29] struggling with the world looking at the
[34:31] wrong things and can't get out of it why
[34:33] cuz you're holding you're
[34:35] teed you're meant to be flying free With

[34:45] carry you right but you're tethered by
[34:48] little things that you're holding on to
[34:50] and you can be filled up and filled up
[34:52] and filled up and filled up and go have
[34:53] a glorious time at camp and it's like
[34:55] pulling pulling hard but you're still
[34:57] teed let it go you have the power to
[35:01] loose amen you have the power to bind
[35:04] amen so stand up and fight hallelujah
[35:08] it's time to get real with the devil

[35:28] the trouble and actually sitting before
[35:30] God and saying God reveal to me the
[35:31] cause of
[35:33] this that's War do you think Israel just
[35:37] willy-nilly went in there and started
[35:38] firing all their guns bombing the whole
[35:41] thing you know nuke the whole thing no
[35:43] Precision Warfare why because they got
[35:46] to get down deep into those tunnels

[36:58] been hurt Lord in many ways in my life
[37:00] but tonight I'm coming for healing and
[37:02] to surrender whatever you put on my
[37:05] heart whatever is holding me back what's
[37:06] tethering me to the
[37:09] world Matthew 11:28-30 says come unto me
[37:14] all ye that labor in a heavy laden and I
[37:18] will give you
[37:19] rest take my yoke upon you and learn of
[37:23] me for I'm meek and lowly in heart and
[37:26] you shall find rest unto your souls for
[37:29] my yoke is easy and my burden is
[37:34] light the entire Christian faith is
[37:37] based on rest your Victory is based on
[37:40] totally resting in him but to totally
[37:44] rest in him is a total trust and a total
[37:47] surrender to him and his
[37:50] kingdom and not only will you be able to
[37:52] trust him but you'll be able to trust
[37:54] his people and that's another thing
[37:56] you've got to be able to trust him in
[37:57] his bride him in his body so that you
[38:00] can be edified so that you can be healed
[38:02] so that you can be blessed so that you
[38:05] can bless he will open up your
[38:08] communication he'll be open up your
[38:13] conversation this here is to show you
[38:15] his
[38:17] position in Isaiah 62:4 to5 and remember
[38:21] as I'm reading this he's he's this
[38:24] doesn't matter what your past what
[38:25] future what you're going through right
[38:28] that's in time and that's based on
[38:30] what's happening and it's variable and
[38:32] there's Devils out there and you also
[38:34] got an old nature that you're wrestling
[38:36] to surrender right that's right so
[38:40] regardless of all that and I could the
[38:43] Bible's filled with these sort of
[38:44] promises but I just found one Thou shalt
[38:48] no more be termed
[38:51] forsaken neither shall thy land anymore
[38:54] be termed desolate
[38:57] but Thou shalt be called
[38:59] hipa and thy land
[39:02] buer I like that he's going to make it
[39:05] all beautiful inside you and he's got it
[39:08] all planned out and mapped out and we're
[39:09] all on a journey and we're at varying
[39:12] places with the Lord of what's Happening
[39:15] inside you in the Kingdom that is in you
[39:19] he's working he's busy and he's very
[39:23] trustworthy he says here for the Lord
[39:25] delighteth in thee and thy land shall be
[39:31] married for as a Young Man Marth a
[39:34] virgin this is the Lord's position this
[39:36] is what he thinks of you right shall thy
[39:38] Sons marry
[39:40] thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth
[39:42] over the bride so shall thy God Rejoice
[39:46] over thee amen hallelujah isn't he
[39:50] wonderful as the bridegroom rejoiceth
[39:53] over the bride so shall thy God Rejoice
[39:58] over thee God's rejoicing over you he
[40:01] cares about you he cares about your
[40:03] future he cares about your development
[40:06] he is is Keen on
[40:08] you he he he's interested he's
[40:11] interested in your life your outcome
[40:13] he's interested in all of the things
[40:14] about you he wants to work in your life
[40:18] Hallelujah the Lord he rejoices over you
[40:21] I mean who else would who's the greatest
[40:23] one that could Rejoice over us how King
[40:27] the creator of heavens and earth
[40:28] rejoicing over me my you get all these
[40:31] great people out there in the world they
[40:33] don't Rejoice over you all those YouTube
[40:35] stars and Twitter stars and oh man I'm
[40:37] probably sounding old but what is that
[40:39] one lock Tik Tok stars all that stuff
[40:42] they're not rejoicing over
[40:44] you H they're just
[40:47] fake fake man oh boy I won't get into
[40:52] that right
[40:54] now and you believe beli by faith like
[40:57] Abraham did and was given the Seal of
[41:01] circumcision for a confirmation of his
[41:03] faith and you believe and accept Jesus
[41:06] as your savior then God gives you the
[41:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost as a
[41:10] confirmation of your faith you say you
[41:13] believe and haven't received the Holy
[41:16] Spirit something wrong with your
[41:19] faith God circumcises the heart the
[41:22] minute the believer really comes and
[41:25] full surrender
[41:27] so if you're up and down in and out
[41:29] you're not in the holy of holies and
[41:31] your life is up and down there's your
[41:33] there's the key full
[41:37] surrender Hallelujah and if you're
[41:39] struggling to do that then get get on
[41:41] your knees and say God heal me what is
[41:45] it that's stopping me why is there an
[41:47] image inside me somewhere an idol is
[41:51] there something that I'm thinking wrong
[41:53] you know when you really get serious
[41:55] with God and you really mean and you say
[41:57] search My Heart Lord Jesus what is it it
[42:02] can be a small thing that's holding you
[42:05] back from a true baptism of the holy
[42:08] spirit because this is the key to a a
[42:11] real Christian Life is the baptism of
[42:13] the Holy
[42:15] Ghost
[42:16] unfortunately as Jesus says many are
[42:20] called but few are chosen straight As
[42:23] the gate and narrow as the way that
[42:25] leadth unto life
[42:26] but few there be that find it but I
[42:29] believe that I'm speaking to a people
[42:31] that have found it Hallelujah and God in
[42:35] his Mercy is here tonight to heal you to
[42:37] undo all of the confusion to take away
[42:39] all anything that would T you to the
[42:41] world yeah that would tether you to the
[42:44] ground that would hold you only so far
[42:47] to make you plateau in your
[42:51] faith that's it that's what God wants is
[42:55] not that bord a line
[42:57] halfway but an absolute full surrender
[43:01] to the kingdom of
[43:03] God
[43:11] Amen where are you are you totally
[43:15] surrendered and resting in
[43:19] Christ are you partially surrendered and
[43:22] open to surrender more both of those
[43:25] places a good places to be and I think
[43:28] we should be that's where we should be
[43:30] that's the place of a of a True Believer
[43:31] with the right attitude towards any
[43:33] Divine promise right amen are you
[43:36] partially surrendered and not currently
[43:38] open to surrender more you know
[43:41] sometimes we can dig our feet in the
[43:42] ground sometimes we can get a little
[43:44] stubborn sometimes we can get a little
[43:45] hurt in the church or a little hurt
[43:47] between people and then that stops you
[43:49] moving
[43:50] on and you've let your War go into a
[43:53] natural Arena but your war is not
[43:55] against flesh and blood blood as against
[43:57] spiritual wickedness in high places to
[44:00] the pulling down of
[44:01] strongholds and every High thing that
[44:03] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[44:07] Christ are you backslid into
[44:10] selfishness needing to surrender again
[44:13] and fully this time no more
[44:16] nonsense no more nonsense
[44:20] yeah I got to be careful I don't look at
[44:23] people you know CU then they might think
[44:24] I'm talking to them
[44:26] you know I always wondered you know
[44:28] brother Adrian he's a real um he's a
[44:32] real evangelist you know but also quite
[44:34] a you know he gets into the depths of
[44:36] the word but he he never looks at people
[44:38] and I thought man because he knows he he
[44:41] says things that are very raw and
[44:42] striking and sometimes you say those
[44:44] things and you're looking at you know
[44:45] you're just looking at people cuz you do
[44:48] and then they're like oh boy am I is
[44:50] that me oh man you know or are you not
[44:54] surrendered but you're still on the
[44:56] fence with God these I'm just now just
[44:58] we're just laying out some of the
[45:00] different positions that we can find
[45:01] ourselves in okay or not surrendered and
[45:05] totally against the will of God and I'm
[45:08] sure that there's probably more but in
[45:11] this
[45:12] room we're one of these amen
[45:20] hallelujah I just put this together so
[45:23] it's the graphics aren't too good but
[45:28] you're like this hot air
[45:30] balloon right and you've got all this
[45:35] joy and and you go you come to church
[45:37] and you get filled up and you and you
[45:40] you know you you're rejoicing and and
[45:42] that but you feel like sometimes I'm
[45:44] only going so far why what's stopping me
[45:47] and so I was looking at a few different
[45:50] things of what it would be that would
[45:52] could hold us on the earth that could
[45:53] just limit us to keep us going up and
[45:55] and down to keep us fighting a carnal
[45:58] battle why aren't you overcoming why are
[46:00] you still struggling with these common
[46:03] things that people of the world struggle
[46:04] with what is it what's tethering you to
[46:06] the Earth what's keeping you on the
[46:08] ground what's keeping you maybe you're
[46:10] not on the ground like I've shown here
[46:12] but you're just flying up a little
[46:14] bit and there's a few different things
[46:16] that I as I was looking into this let's
[46:19] just say you have a gondola or or a hot
[46:21] air balloon and it's Tethered to the
[46:24] ground with ropes and you want to go
[46:26] up don't put more hot air in the balloon
[46:31] or more things that will lift it
[46:33] up untie the
[46:36] tethers and you will naturally go up so
[46:40] the right thing to do is not worry about
[46:41] going up I mean hey the Lord his purpose
[46:46] is for you to go on a Rapture his
[46:47] purpose is for you to be free his
[46:50] purpose for you is to love to be
[46:52] connected to be able to associate to be
[46:55] able to integrate with all the people
[46:58] and and get on with people and be one of
[46:59] those ones that if you go you know what
[47:02] I don't know their friends from their
[47:03] enemy they're just so lovely and so nice
[47:06] all the time what is it about those
[47:08] people what has why are those people
[47:10] like that because all the tethers to the
[47:14] Earth have been broken and they they
[47:17] they they they're F flying soaring like
[47:19] an eagle with
[47:20] God so don't worry about going up the
[47:23] power of God will take us in his purpose
[47:26] let go of what's holding you
[47:29] down and if you will let go of those
[47:32] tethers believe me your whole being will
[47:35] go up naturally exactly at the pace that
[47:39] it should everything will unfold
[47:41] perfectly but you have to be willing to
[47:43] let go of what's holding you
[47:48] down and I just want to go through some
[47:50] of the
[47:51] struggles that we have with surrender
[47:54] what's tethering you I'm asking this
[47:56] question is it a fear of missing
[47:59] out
[48:01] Children I've asked children this before
[48:03] and this is what they went
[48:05] to you know what's tethering you to
[48:08] totally surrender and become
[48:13] absolutely fanatically joyous for the
[48:15] Lord not worried about what other people
[48:18] think you know like a total surrender to
[48:21] God and I ask these questions to all of
[48:24] us but specifically to to the
[48:26] children does surrender mean that all
[48:28] your fun will be taken does it mean
[48:33] that all your creative
[48:35] flare you can be this cool
[48:38] thing oh you know and Everyone likes you
[48:41] at school and Everyone likes you
[48:43] wherever you go you just call you fit in
[48:45] and you you're like a chameleon and you
[48:47] just become this at school and this at
[48:49] church and then this in the Sunday
[48:51] school and then this at church lunch and
[48:54] then this in front of your family and
[48:55] then this when your family's not
[48:58] there got seven faces seven
[49:01] personalities oh boy oh my you know will
[49:06] it will surrendering take that away
[49:10] no it'll take surrendering will take the
[49:13] falseness of it away but it won't take
[49:15] away your creative flare it won't take
[49:17] away the expression of who you really
[49:20] are but what will what it will do is
[49:22] you'll be the same you'll be like and I
[49:25] said I say this to my children cuz you
[49:27] know they go through things and they ask
[49:29] me questions and I said you know when
[49:31] you totally surrender and you totally
[49:34] untether yourself from the world and
[49:36] untether yourself from all of these
[49:37] things that you think are your Comforts
[49:40] and your who you are and all these
[49:41] things that you've got in place to try
[49:43] and be something and you just lay it all
[49:45] down and you let God reveal who you
[49:48] are and then people love you for that
[49:52] that's sustainable living you don't have
[49:55] to put put nothing on you don't have to
[49:57] change your face you remember how was I
[49:59] you know because you can get so confused
[50:01] now cuz that group of friends you're
[50:02] like this that group of friends are like
[50:03] that and all of a sudden you've got 40
[50:05] different faces to be but tonight you
[50:08] can be healed of that fear of missing
[50:10] out amen tonight you can be healed of
[50:13] that fear of not fitting inlj there's a
[50:16] fear there especially under the peer
[50:18] pressure the devil is peer pressure that
[50:22] comes from Satan to make children feel
[50:24] like they they a fear of not fitting in
[50:27] but I said to my children especially in
[50:29] the environment here and also around if
[50:32] you just let Jes if you just be the real
[50:35] you the real you yeah and let and
[50:38] totally surrender Jesus will bring out
[50:40] the real you and that real you when they
[50:44] love you for that for who you really are
[50:48] that's
[50:49] Eternal that that's not something that's
[50:51] fickle that's not something that's built
[50:52] on the Sands of of man's ideas or what
[50:55] you think of your opinions because
[50:57] remember what you think when you're this
[50:59] age and then when you start growing up
[51:00] it's all changing all the time by the
[51:03] time you're 20 you'd be crazy you'd be
[51:05] mentally
[51:07] unstable we don't want to be mentally
[51:09] unstable so even as a child as a young
[51:12] one you can totally be healed of the
[51:14] fear of missing out the fear of not
[51:16] fitting in the fear of looking like
[51:18] you're weird because you're dressing
[51:20] differently than all these other girls
[51:22] and boys and whatever you have that the
[51:24] Lord has revealed to you that is right
[51:28] and when you totally untether yourself
[51:30] you are totally free and now you're
[51:33] flying now you're unhitched from the
[51:37] control of man's ideas the control of
[51:40] what your friends think the control of
[51:42] what mommy and daddy think even because
[51:44] now you're free to actually be to
[51:47] express Christ and then you don't even
[51:50] have to worry that what you do is bad or
[51:53] wrong or good or whatever because the
[51:55] Lord is leading you you're free to be
[51:59] yourself totally unequivocally
[52:03] free
[52:05] amen
[52:13] hallelujah does surrender under the fear
[52:16] of missing out does it mean you lose
[52:18] your open
[52:21] mind you know my mom she told me when I
[52:23] became a Christian she goes she cried
[52:26] actually and I thought she was she was
[52:27] giving her life to the Lord but she was
[52:29] actually she actually cried because
[52:30] she's like my son's lost his open mind I
[52:34] thought my my mind has just come off
[52:36] from than it's ever beenen you know I've
[52:38] been the the the fullness of God and all
[52:40] these great events that's taking place
[52:42] in our generation and everything that's
[52:44] going on and my mind's become right open
[52:47] to God to the Creator you know like
[52:51] man when you totally surrender don't
[52:54] have a fear of losing your open mind or
[52:56] losing the ability you know you know do
[52:59] you lose all your Ambitions and dreams
[53:02] does do your dreams disappeared you know
[53:04] no but you surrender them you lay them
[53:07] at the foot of the cross lay them down
[53:10] don't be afraid because you see part of
[53:14] those things will be part of your you
[53:16] know if they're pure and they're real
[53:17] true um Ambitions and dreams and they're
[53:20] right You' be surprised how many of
[53:22] those are actually true and God's placed
[53:24] that desire in you but when you're
[53:26] willing to surrender it will untether
[53:29] you from you won't be held down by you
[53:32] trying to drive it you are trying to
[53:35] make it happen right we don't want to
[53:37] try and make it happen it's not in us to
[53:40] to do that what God is asking is that we
[53:43] just totally surrender that to him the
[53:45] fear of losing control of your comfort

[59:56] pasture the thief cometh not but to for
[1:00:00] to steal and to kill and to destroy I am
[1:00:03] come that they might have life and they
[1:00:06] might have it more abundantly I was like
[1:00:09] Lord why might might and you know what
[1:00:12] the answer is
[1:00:14] choices what choices are you going to
[1:00:16] make will you make choices cuz this is
[1:00:20] all your free will you can give your
[1:00:21] life and be a great Christian what was
[1:00:24] you know and go so far but there's
[1:00:26] choices that you make that keep you
[1:00:28] tethered choices not to surrender
[1:00:31] choices not to give that last thing that
[1:00:34] of over to the Lord because of some
[1:00:36] reason or some upbringing or some wrong
[1:00:38] image in your subconscious that's
[1:00:40] holding you back from truly surrendering
[1:00:43] all and I thought Lord I do not want to
[1:00:46] be in the might I'm want to be
[1:00:49] guaranteed Abundant Life I want to be
[1:00:51] guaranteed joy unspeakable and full of
[1:00:54] Glory GL I want to be guaranteed
[1:00:57] peace Shalom to you
[1:01:01] shalom in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:04] receive it receive his love because his
[1:01:08] love is what will neutralize the fear
[1:01:11] that is stopping you from surrendering
[1:01:13] whatever that creature Comfort is that
[1:01:15] is holding you back and has held you
[1:01:17] back the Lord says he will wait and he
[1:01:20] will be patient and he will wait but
[1:01:22] remember it is your choices that is
[1:01:24] stopping you from having an abundant
[1:01:26] life it is your choices that's stringing
[1:01:28] you to the world and all that happens no
[1:01:31] matter what you do you go to church week
[1:01:33] after week you go to camps you go to
[1:01:36] these great sermons all and you hear the
[1:01:39] word and great experiences but you never
[1:01:41] get any higher than that because you're
[1:01:44] tethered because you're holding on to
[1:01:46] things you're you're you're afraid to
[1:01:48] let go of what's comforting you and
[1:01:51] therefore you're not getting access to
[1:01:52] the comforter
[1:01:55] you're allowing a devil's invention to
[1:01:57] comfort you I know these sound harsh but
[1:02:01] remember everything from the Tree of
[1:02:02] knowledge comes from the devil
[1:02:05] civilization comes from the the the PO
[1:02:08] the the that that it's a result of the
[1:02:12] corruption in the Garden of Eden they
[1:02:15] corrupted by by by taking the fruit of
[1:02:18] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:02:19] and listening to the lies of the enemy
[1:02:22] and coming un his wisdom
[1:02:25] and they started listening and now
[1:02:26] they've been look at the civilizations
[1:02:28] that came from C and all the technology
[1:02:30] and everything that was here and you
[1:02:32] will let that be your comfort and it's
[1:02:36] that's the reason why your joy only goes
[1:02:39] so much and your peace is only so much
[1:02:42] and then you find yourself struggling
[1:02:44] and you find yourself battling again and
[1:02:46] you find yourself doing things that
[1:02:48] Christians don't
[1:02:50] do and you wonder why but you know why
[1:02:53] deep down
[1:02:55] we all know
[1:02:57] why if we're really sincere and really
[1:03:01] you know if we really search our life
[1:03:02] and let God search us and when the
[1:03:05] preacher is preaching you ain't
[1:03:06] pitchforking it over to the one that you
[1:03:08] know is also into or doing that or you
[1:03:10] think they're doing that or whatever but
[1:03:11] you're actually owning it and sometimes
[1:03:14] you got to own stuff that's hurt you
[1:03:16] some sometimes you got to own stuff the
[1:03:18] pastor's preaching and it's taking the
[1:03:20] hide off
[1:03:21] you you got to own that cuz that's your
[1:03:25] word that's your
[1:03:27] word hallelujah and when you own it then
[1:03:30] the Lord can deal with you oh
[1:03:32] yes Proverbs 16:9 it says a man's heart
[1:03:35] deviseth his way but the Lord directs
[1:03:39] his steps you think of a computer you
[1:03:41] know I think I've got a picture here
[1:03:43] there we go look at this good old Apple
[1:03:46] That's my kind of computer man that's
[1:03:48] what we used to play on huh it took
[1:03:51] about half an hour to load
[1:03:55] and you had about seven or eight discs
[1:03:58] and it had one game on it and it was all
[1:04:00] green green man that was real computers
[1:04:04] man those were chunky things right
[1:04:07] huh but anyway think of a computer most
[1:04:11] of us are Savvy with computers you'll
[1:04:14] understand that in a computer there's
[1:04:16] Ram which is random access memory there
[1:04:19] is a processor which is like the brain
[1:04:22] and there is uh graphics card which
[1:04:24] gives you the visuals and all of those
[1:04:27] right can be totally powerful and
[1:04:30] there's a hard drive which stores all
[1:04:31] the data right so between those things
[1:04:35] it kind of talks together and does this
[1:04:36] and then presents to you the information
[1:04:39] on the screen so you can have and you
[1:04:43] are you've got the greatest Ram you've
[1:04:46] got the greatest Graphics you've got the
[1:04:49] greatest componentry you've even got the
[1:04:51] greatest hard
[1:04:53] drive but I tell you what you can have
[1:04:55] the greatest computer that's ever been
[1:04:57] invented but if your hard drive is
[1:05:02] full of just
[1:05:05] rubbish rubbish just full information
[1:05:09] overload full your hard drive just
[1:05:12] totally full of all sorts of stuff
[1:05:14] because you just allow everything in and
[1:05:16] you just install all these stupid games
[1:05:18] and apps and everything and it just
[1:05:20] fills your thing with spy wear fry wear
[1:05:23] viruses and every where huh all that
[1:05:26] stuff filling the hard drive then and
[1:05:29] I'm talking about computers now you your
[1:05:31] hard drive get full and you can have the
[1:05:33] best everything and it's everything's
[1:05:34] clunky and it's just not working you're
[1:05:37] like why isn't it working and then you
[1:05:39] go down to the file manager you think on
[1:05:40] there and the bar's red you're like ah
[1:05:42] it's red and now you're like oh man I've
[1:05:44] done this like how many times I've done
[1:05:47] this how many times now all the stuff on
[1:05:48] there I'm struggling to delete now cuz
[1:05:52] it's all getting better oh what do you
[1:05:53] do okay you got to format that thing you
[1:05:57] got to get rid of all that spy wear fry
[1:05:58] wear app wear
[1:06:00] everything huh sorry Ando I'm taking
[1:06:03] your your little question it's like a
[1:06:06] Brahman told me off she's like stop
[1:06:08] doing that thing that brother and Pa
[1:06:10] does but I like them you know it's like
[1:06:14] when you like somebody you pick up their
[1:06:16] their their ways you know well I do
[1:06:19] anyway some people are probably more
[1:06:21] controlled but I'm just like man if I
[1:06:23] like somebody I start talking like them
[1:06:25] and oh
[1:06:29] man help me
[1:06:33] Lord
[1:06:36] okay
[1:06:38] so this the same thing with us when our
[1:06:41] hard drive gets full of all the stuff
[1:06:44] that in this world sometimes it takes
[1:06:46] you just got to hit the delete button
[1:06:47] what that's doing is it's tethering you
[1:06:49] it's bulking you up it's slowing you
[1:06:52] down all these things things are holding
[1:06:55] you on the
[1:07:00] ground this one's for the
[1:07:04] men natural
[1:07:07] masculinity verse Divine
[1:07:10] femininity oh boy that's a big phrase
[1:07:14] natural
[1:07:16] masculinity verse Divine femininity
[1:07:19] brings a hard transition for men to give
[1:07:23] up their natural manhood to take on the
[1:07:25] divine feminine role as the Bride of
[1:07:28] Jesus Christ all the boys they just
[1:07:32] magnetized to David and and and all
[1:07:34] these Great Men of the Bible but then
[1:07:37] when it comes if you say to these boys
[1:07:39] do you identify as Ruth do you identify
[1:07:42] as as Rahab and do you identify as as
[1:07:46] Deborah the boys are like what trying to
[1:07:48] make me a girl and then the men you know
[1:07:50] so we can become very masculine and we
[1:07:53] can be worldly masculine and we can fail
[1:07:55] to identify as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:07:59] but let me tell you
[1:08:01] this the only way to understand and
[1:08:04] express true masculinity I'm talking
[1:08:07] real Divine masculinity in the flesh is
[1:08:10] to embrace Divine femininity in the
[1:08:13] spirit you can only become a real
[1:08:16] man when you become a real wife and I'm
[1:08:20] talking to men and women but mainly the
[1:08:22] men right now amen because sometimes we
[1:08:24] get so Macho and stoic and I'm a man and
[1:08:28] a lot of that is just fear you're afraid
[1:08:31] your identity isn't sure and steadfast
[1:08:34] yet and we we work our we work our
[1:08:37] muscles and we become strong and tough
[1:08:39] because we want to attract but think
[1:08:42] about
[1:08:43] this true masculinity is not found in
[1:08:48] muscle it's good cuz we need to be
[1:08:51] chalous and we need to be able to help
[1:08:53] we need to be to protect it's part of
[1:08:54] being a man you know and you feel like
[1:08:57] you can
[1:09:00] protect but the hes prepared unto the
[1:09:03] day of battle but safety is of the Lord
[1:09:06] now to be to have true protection in
[1:09:08] your house is not by our muscles or our
[1:09:11] guns or our crowbars or whatever we have
[1:09:14] by our
[1:09:15] beds it's only by the Lord's Angels amen
[1:09:20] amen so I believe that a true believer's
[1:09:22] house that's that that that that that
[1:09:24] that's not a welcoming Devils into their
[1:09:26] house by whatever they're watching and
[1:09:27] doing or saying or treating however you
[1:09:30] are in your home with your family or by
[1:09:32] yourself if you're not welcoming
[1:09:35] demons because some of those tethers do
[1:09:37] that some of those tethers that we have
[1:09:40] in our lives can welcome demons and I've
[1:09:43] had people Christians come and stay at
[1:09:45] my house and you know they got demons
[1:09:48] cuz they bring demons into the house and
[1:09:49] the demons come up and try and attack
[1:09:51] they're like oh who are these people and
[1:09:52] they come up and they start trying to
[1:09:53] attack us in our and then they know
[1:09:56] they're getting a battle and then those
[1:09:57] demons they regret when that happens in
[1:10:01] your house they should have just hid
[1:10:03] themselves outside down the road and not
[1:10:05] even showed their face cuz they ended up
[1:10:07] so fast down and out of
[1:10:09] Darkness because you've got Authority
[1:10:12] you can cast Devils into outer Darkness
[1:10:15] if you know who you are amen hallelujah
[1:10:18] on but anyway these tethers and
[1:10:20] sometimes you if if the te let's say
[1:10:22] you've got those or what ever but if
[1:10:25] you're not well if your your house is is
[1:10:27] is
[1:10:28] pure then there is rings of angels
[1:10:31] around your house protecting you and
[1:10:34] Devils can try all they want they just
[1:10:36] can't get in you've got an identic
[1:10:39] condition the Lord creates a Haven for
[1:10:42] you in your home Hallelujah so that you
[1:10:45] can be a real man but let me just tell
[1:10:46] you this you need to embrace Divine
[1:10:48] femininity brothers so that you can
[1:10:51] become a real man amen you need to
[1:10:53] identify yourself as the Bride of Jesus
[1:10:55] Christ so you become a real man and a
[1:10:58] real man you know Solomon failed to
[1:11:00] surrender his desire for forbidden
[1:11:02] woman of heathen Nations he eventually
[1:11:04] pulled back and turned
[1:11:08] away from the Lord you know we don't
[1:11:11] want this to happen in our life so don't
[1:11:13] let that type of masculinity that's fake
[1:11:15] masculinity that's actually not like the
[1:11:17] masculinity that they put out there that
[1:11:19] is not real
[1:11:21] masculinity real masculinity is is is
[1:11:23] honoring to the Fe female it's actually
[1:11:27] redeeming to the female it's you real
[1:11:30] masculinity expressed brings the female
[1:11:33] to walk beside
[1:11:35] you it actually brings her up to you you
[1:11:38] you become together that's why the Lord
[1:11:40] Jesus Christ as the true masculine image
[1:11:44] you know the true husband he is your
[1:11:46] real husband woman ladies sisters he's
[1:11:50] your real husband and brothers he's your
[1:11:52] real husband you know the true masculine
[1:11:58] image
[1:12:04] Glory but if we're not you know we get
[1:12:06] caught up in these other masculine
[1:12:08] images and and and you know it can it
[1:12:11] can you know what we can get influenced
[1:12:13] by these things of the world and we can
[1:12:15] pull pull away it can help we can stop
[1:12:17] us from walking with the Lord and we can
[1:12:19] pull away pull back but the Lord has no
[1:12:22] joy in seeing his people pull
[1:12:26] back you know this action of Solomon led
[1:12:29] to the destruction of Jerusalem Paul
[1:12:32] though Paul a Jewish scholar a man of
[1:12:37] great
[1:12:38] Prestige of the highest religious order
[1:12:41] in
[1:12:42] Israel he had a lot to boast about as
[1:12:45] we've read in the Bible he was willing
[1:12:48] to surrender everything and untether
[1:12:50] himself from all his
[1:12:52] prestige all of his status in the world
[1:12:55] what his friends thought about him he
[1:12:57] was friends with the high priest huh
[1:13:00] what about you go out there and you
[1:13:01] become friends with with with great men
[1:13:04] of the earth Great Men of this
[1:13:08] world but are you willing to surrender
[1:13:11] all of that to be untethered so that you
[1:13:14] can be
[1:13:16] free this guy
[1:13:19] here does anyone ever heard of hero or
[1:13:22] no
[1:13:25] this is for the brothers because you
[1:13:27] know we can be stubborn the sisters can
[1:13:30] uh you can just enjoy the
[1:13:33] ride your turn's coming in a
[1:13:36] [Laughter]
[1:13:38] second this man Isaac actually told me
[1:13:41] about this man when we were driving one
[1:13:43] time because I must have been going down
[1:13:44] this route of conversation but this man
[1:13:47] is
[1:13:48] amazing he's got the most tenacity you
[1:13:50] could ever imagine for a worldly
[1:13:54] man so World War II you know the
[1:13:58] Japanese were against the Allies so they
[1:14:01] were the evil force obviously in their
[1:14:03] eyes they were wanting to conquer the
[1:14:05] world and so they were the goodies but
[1:14:07] as far as we're concerned they're the
[1:14:09] baddies right they were the ones that
[1:14:11] they bombed Pearl Harbor and then then
[1:14:13] they declared America declared war and
[1:14:16] they joined in with the other um baddies
[1:14:19] but anyway so this guy here was let me
[1:14:22] just read this hio
[1:14:23] trained as an intelligence officer in
[1:14:26] the Commando class of the futata and the
[1:14:28] futata Bano of the Nano school on 26th
[1:14:32] of December 1944 he was sent to lebano
[1:14:35] island in the
[1:14:36] Philippines and he was ordered now
[1:14:39] remember who ordered him it was a it was
[1:14:42] an evil man an evil
[1:14:44] directive just like your old
[1:14:47] nature just like the devil right or some
[1:14:51] corrupted influence in your life
[1:14:53] something that's tethering you right to
[1:14:55] holding you down He was ordered to do
[1:14:57] all he could to hamper enemy attacks on
[1:14:59] the island including destroying the
[1:15:00] airst strip and the peer at the harbor
[1:15:03] onoda's orders also stated that under no
[1:15:06] circumstance was he to surrender or to
[1:15:08] take his own life which the Japanese
[1:15:10] used to do and they still probably do in
[1:15:12] the samurai world but anyway this man
[1:15:16] was told by this thing Never Surrender
[1:15:19] by some evil force do not give up do not
[1:15:21] surrender you just do this evil stuff
[1:15:23] and you stay doing evil you stay
[1:15:25] Tethered to this island this is what you
[1:15:27] do until you hear further orders from me
[1:15:30] amen so so he's on this island and he's
[1:15:34] doing all the stuff he actually came
[1:15:35] under the command of other people so he
[1:15:37] couldn't carry out his thing and then
[1:15:38] the Americans took took the island all
[1:15:40] that sort of stuff but anyway the war
[1:15:42] was over and for 35 years this
[1:15:47] man rage Guerilla Warfare from his
[1:15:50] little position on the island he stayed
[1:15:54] under the orders and people they were
[1:15:55] sending Fliers and he was he killed
[1:15:57] about 20 people over the and and it
[1:16:00] wasn't until
[1:16:02] 1976 that what actually happened is that
[1:16:05] he raged all these things but in
[1:16:07] 1976 finally a man who heard about him
[1:16:12] and this guy instead of just going there
[1:16:14] and trying to be he needed a friend and
[1:16:17] so this man this this guy he went there
[1:16:20] to the island and he actually befriended
[1:16:22] this guy on not but under no
[1:16:24] circumstances was this guy going to
[1:16:26] surrender there was nothing in him to
[1:16:28] surrender anything so he just kept
[1:16:30] fighting and he keept pushing under an
[1:16:33] evil
[1:16:35] order for 35 years he kept fighting and
[1:16:39] the war was over his his whole Vision
[1:16:43] everything was wrong and he killed all
[1:16:45] these people and he brought people
[1:16:49] down until this man came who was a bit
[1:16:52] of a kind of like a hippie sort of guy
[1:16:54] from
[1:16:55] Japan and he actually went there and he
[1:16:57] said and he got to know him and he
[1:16:59] finally found out why this guy wasn't
[1:17:01] surrendering and he was cuz he's a
[1:17:03] trained army guy you know no he had
[1:17:05] shootouts with the cops he had ammo he
[1:17:07] had grenades he had everything from
[1:17:09] World War II 35 years sometimes we find
[1:17:13] ourselves bunkering ourselves into a way
[1:17:15] that we are and we're failing to
[1:17:18] surrender to the voice of God and we're
[1:17:21] holding on because some evil thing told
[1:17:23] us this thing many years ago and we're
[1:17:25] holding on and we're holding on and
[1:17:27] we're hearing messages and we're hearing
[1:17:28] things this is the way walk you in it
[1:17:30] this is the way of the Lord this is the
[1:17:32] will of the Lord this is what we Ser
[1:17:34] many people they stay hunkered down into
[1:17:36] a certain vision and they hold their
[1:17:38] ground but then it takes a friend it
[1:17:41] takes someone with love to go and find
[1:17:44] out
[1:17:45] why so this guy was raging War for all
[1:17:48] these years and no one knew why and it
[1:17:51] was that he was told never to surrender
[1:17:53] and he would not he he every time that
[1:17:55] things came and newspapers they sent
[1:17:57] them
[1:17:58] newspapers they didn't believe it they
[1:18:00] thought it was a setup because under no
[1:18:01] circumstance so you surrender under no
[1:18:04] circumstance should you change under no
[1:18:06] circumstance should you come come into a
[1:18:08] new vision to realize that that war that
[1:18:11] battle is futile cuz that Vision under
[1:18:14] that Japanese regime was finished 30 odd
[1:18:17] years ago and sometimes we're holding to
[1:18:19] a vision of years ago and our image is
[1:18:23] old it's pasted and it's not current
[1:18:26] we're holding to it but it's time to let
[1:18:28] it go it's tethering it's tethered him
[1:18:31] he was tended for 35 years in a in a
[1:18:34] state of war and he could have been at
[1:18:37] peace he could have had family he could
[1:18:40] have done all these great things and yet
[1:18:43] he was stuck and bunkered and maybe this
[1:18:46] might not be for anyone in this room but
[1:18:48] someone on that tape may be listening
[1:18:50] and if you are listening on that tape
[1:18:52] now or later on
[1:18:55] repent turn away from your wicked
[1:18:58] ways and let God bring you into the
[1:19:00] present
[1:19:02] Revelation CU it's time it's
[1:19:06] time you know and so this friend he
[1:19:08] actually found out why he was like this
[1:19:11] what orders he had followed and they
[1:19:13] brought the this was 35 years later so
[1:19:15] the general that gave him the
[1:19:17] orders they actually brought him to the
[1:19:19] island to tell him to stand down
[1:19:23] he had to be officially stood down by
[1:19:26] his
[1:19:30] General oh
[1:19:32] brothers let's not get too
[1:19:36] stubborn let's not get too dig our heels
[1:19:39] in and stay the same way but why not I
[1:19:43] embrace Divine femininity cuz to to to
[1:19:47] this this type of let's say the anoda
[1:19:51] complex
[1:19:53] can hinder us and tether us from really
[1:19:56] developing as a
[1:19:57] man we can get our feet stuck in the
[1:20:00] ground and we can have an ambition we
[1:20:02] can have a a some sort of as brother
[1:20:04] Ben's been preaching on recently you
[1:20:06] know some impression we just get a
[1:20:09] little impression and and we don't even
[1:20:11] get God to confirm it in the mouth of
[1:20:13] two or three Witnesses we just go and do
[1:20:14] it and we stick to it and we stay with
[1:20:16] it but actually it's false we're being
[1:20:18] in a
[1:20:19] NOA but it's time that we Embrace Divine
[1:20:22] femininity start identifying with Ruth
[1:20:24] start identifying with Rahab and Sarah
[1:20:26] some of those females in the Bible and
[1:20:29] start seeing him as a husband or have
[1:20:31] you been hurt by your dad have you been
[1:20:34] hurt by men in
[1:20:35] leadership and I'm talking to Brothers
[1:20:38] but I'm talking to sisters now too
[1:20:40] because being hurt by men can actually
[1:20:45] distort female image of
[1:20:48] masculinity and unfortunately because of
[1:20:50] the wars there's a lot of men that were
[1:20:53] Unfaithful and fathers you know and our
[1:20:56] grandfathers a lot of us and our fathers
[1:20:58] were broken and Shell Shocked by the war
[1:21:01] and you know sisters your image of God
[1:21:04] as a father may be corrupted by Earthly
[1:21:06] cares and
[1:21:08] failures but his image of you is
[1:21:12] perfect and he wants to heal you tonight
[1:21:14] if you're unable to really receive God
[1:21:16] as a father men women
[1:21:19] children your image of the Son of God Is
[1:21:22] Your Divine
[1:21:26] husband may be decimated by experiences
[1:21:29] with
[1:21:30] people on the world on the Earth but his
[1:21:34] thoughts and image of you as a bride is
[1:21:36] Rich with love and
[1:21:38] affection I got this this thing here was
[1:21:41] really a
[1:21:43] touching he says an 80-year old man
[1:21:45] insists every morning on bringing his
[1:21:47] wife breakfast in the nursing home and
[1:21:49] when asked why is his wife in a
[1:21:51] retirement home he he replied she has
[1:21:53] Alzheimer's disease so he was asked and
[1:21:56] this is I believe this is the
[1:21:58] man would your wife be worried if one
[1:22:01] day you didn't come and bring her
[1:22:02] breakfast and he said she doesn't
[1:22:04] remember she doesn't even know who I
[1:22:08] am she hasn't recognized me for 5
[1:22:13] years surprised the nurse asked him why
[1:22:15] do you bring your wife breakfast every
[1:22:19] morning even though she doesn't
[1:22:21] recognize you and the man smiled looked
[1:22:24] her in the eyee and said she doesn't
[1:22:26] know who I am but I know who she
[1:22:32] is you know that's like the
[1:22:34] Lord many times we've got a distorted
[1:22:38] image in our subconscious of him as
[1:22:40] husband or his father because of
[1:22:43] corrupted fathers or corrupted husbands
[1:22:45] that have hurt us or corrupted male
[1:22:48] figures in our life that have broken our
[1:22:51] spirit
[1:22:54] and you may not know him how he you
[1:22:57] should because of these things because
[1:23:00] of molestation because of of deep hurts
[1:23:03] from men filthy disgusting Beast animal
[1:23:06] men that have done horrible wicked
[1:23:11] things but that's not our Jesus and
[1:23:15] tonight if you're
[1:23:17] struggling with that image he's here to
[1:23:21] heal you because he wants you to
[1:23:23] surrender to him as husband to him as
[1:23:26] father there was a brother and he was um
[1:23:31] the brother uh there was a pastor that
[1:23:34] came over years ago and he told a story
[1:23:35] about a man in his congregation who
[1:23:37] could not receive the Holy Ghost and he
[1:23:38] was so sincere and and he went into
[1:23:42] counseling for it and the Lord by divine
[1:23:45] revelation revealed to the pastor what
[1:23:48] the problem was and he asked them he
[1:23:50] said has your dad done a really nasty
[1:23:53] thing to you when you were a child and
[1:23:55] he says yes actually and the whole
[1:23:56] memory just came back up and he actually
[1:23:58] started crying and the what it was is
[1:24:01] that he he left the hose on or he didn't
[1:24:04] he he did something that wasn't even
[1:24:06] that bad but he made a mistake his dad
[1:24:08] came home and he had the greatest new
[1:24:10] Lego truck or whatever it was in the car
[1:24:12] and he showed him the truck and he said
[1:24:15] if you didn't if you had turned that
[1:24:17] hose off I would have given you this and
[1:24:19] he had been wanting it for months and
[1:24:21] months and he fin was going to get it
[1:24:23] and his dad showed him it and said but
[1:24:25] it's not yours I'm going to give it away
[1:24:27] and he never got it and he said that
[1:24:28] complex laid in that man subconscious
[1:24:31] and he couldn't trust God as a father to
[1:24:36] be true to his promises this is how a
[1:24:39] little thing in your life can hold you
[1:24:40] back and tether you to the Earth I'm
[1:24:43] sorry that I'm going further and into
[1:24:45] our prayer time but I believe this is
[1:24:48] important see Mary when she this is now
[1:24:54] Mary she got this was a time of
[1:24:57] transition for Mary Mary she was at the
[1:25:01] tomb and she had looked in she was
[1:25:03] looking for Jesus as she had seen him
[1:25:07] she was her image of Jesus was was the
[1:25:10] Jesus of uh of the
[1:25:12] past and yet only 3 or 4 days ago she
[1:25:16] saw Jesus as another man older more worn
[1:25:19] out bigger you know and the last time
[1:25:21] she saw him he he was covered in blood
[1:25:24] and he was
[1:25:26] suffering and so her image of
[1:25:29] him was not correct until he spoke and I
[1:25:34] believe tonight you know she turned
[1:25:35] around and she saw him and she thought
[1:25:37] he was the gardener and so she was
[1:25:40] looking at the very present revelation
[1:25:43] of Jesus Christ and yet she couldn't see
[1:25:47] him but he knew
[1:25:50] her and he was willing
[1:25:52] think about this to see that she could
[1:25:55] see him right what are you looking at to
[1:25:59] see that she could see him he was
[1:26:02] willing to stop on the way taking his
[1:26:07] blood into Glory from the cross down to
[1:26:11] Hell and then back up he stopped and
[1:26:15] said I've got someone that needs me
[1:26:17] right now there is no job too small for
[1:26:22] Lord and I believe tonight the Lord is
[1:26:27] not too busy for you he's not too busy
[1:26:30] to heal you so that you can come
[1:26:33] untethered he's not too busy there's no
[1:26:35] job too minor you might think I it's
[1:26:38] just a little thing you know that I'm
[1:26:39] doing it's just a little thing that I've
[1:26:40] held on to it's just a little thing you
[1:26:42] know don't think that it's a little
[1:26:45] thing to the Lord he cares he cared
[1:26:49] enough to stop so that Mary would turn
[1:26:51] around and see
[1:26:54] and he would speak her
[1:26:56] name so that she could come into the
[1:26:59] full manifestation and know who he is
[1:27:02] and and and and and and be reassured and
[1:27:05] be healed of the pain that she was going
[1:27:10] through
[1:27:14] Hallelujah Mary had a stale image you
[1:27:17] could say of Jesus in his partial
[1:27:21] revelation
[1:27:24] but she was standing in front of him in
[1:27:26] his eternal
[1:27:28] Revelation and when he spoke to her
[1:27:31] everything came
[1:27:32] open woman with trust issues towards
[1:27:35] masculinity struggled to totally open up
[1:27:38] to the Divine male image of Christ
[1:27:41] Abused Women broken homes social phobias
[1:27:44] through failed
[1:27:47] relationships woman brought up by Broken
[1:27:49] spirited
[1:27:50] mothers that you know so sometimes it's
[1:27:54] not the experience that you go through
[1:27:56] from your own father but your mother
[1:27:58] might have gone through the same thing
[1:28:01] or worse and their complexes get brought
[1:28:05] onto you they're called learn behaviors
[1:28:07] and women many times today have been
[1:28:08] raised masculine and the role has forged
[1:28:12] to a rut in their subconscious and they
[1:28:15] struggle to come into a divine feminine
[1:28:17] role I mean I grew up around woman like
[1:28:21] that they were very Butch they were very
[1:28:25] Macho they were very able they were very
[1:28:27] able to do things they were very
[1:28:28] competent and man you say one thing
[1:28:31] about them being you know you know like
[1:28:35] uh like a misogynistic type of thing may
[1:28:36] you would be wearing it it was bad you
[1:28:39] know and and and so there was there was
[1:28:41] like a massive
[1:28:43] like it was horrible it's actually a
[1:28:46] very bad place and a lot of people have
[1:28:49] been raised that way you know my sister
[1:28:51] was raised that way man you know far out
[1:28:55] we had a lot of hardships together you
[1:28:58] know and the reason for this is war torn
[1:29:00] conditions broke masculinity and fathers
[1:29:03] a total absence of Father Figure both
[1:29:05] physically and relationally Unfaithful
[1:29:08] fatherhood and selfish fatherhood I say
[1:29:11] Brothers we cannot raise our children
[1:29:13] like
[1:29:15] that let's have the
[1:29:18] musicians and then we'll
[1:29:20] pray
[1:29:30] can you play that
[1:29:32] song I Give Myself
[1:29:50] Away
[1:29:56] oops sorry can you put it back I wasn't
[1:30:04] [Music]
[1:30:11] finished it's
[1:30:20] stand
[1:30:23] this whole sermon was just a
[1:30:25] foundation it's not not a
[1:30:29] usual but I want you to deeply think
[1:30:31] about these
[1:30:34] things listen to what the prophet
[1:30:38] says he says I've often thought how
[1:30:42] we've deprived
[1:30:44] ourselves how we've robbed God of his
[1:30:46] plan by not surrendering Our Lives
[1:30:49] completely to him if everything that we
[1:30:52] have to
[1:30:56] him how that we have disallowed his
[1:30:59] program how we've
[1:31:02] lingered May tonight if you've
[1:31:07] lingered Sarah waited 30 odd years
[1:31:10] before she got the promise how long are
[1:31:13] you lingering remember God said he will
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:17] wait and have made him to wait and wait
[1:31:20] and wait trying to find somebody that he
[1:31:23] could work through trying to find a man
[1:31:25] somewhere that he could put confidence
[1:31:27] in some man that would surrender
[1:31:30] everything and I believe tonight we can
[1:31:32] surrender everything as we sing the song
[1:31:34] and we'll go to
[1:31:36] prayer but just one more thing I'm just
[1:31:38] going to read one more
[1:31:45] quote now if a person completely
[1:31:48] surrendered to the devil will give him
[1:31:50] twice his strength what will a man
[1:31:52] completely surrendered to God do See
[1:31:54] it'll make you so weak maybe you're
[1:31:57] crippled and can't stand
[1:32:00] up that can be physically and
[1:32:02] spiritually but surrender yourself to
[1:32:05] God and New Life a new strength comes in
[1:32:10] and you go to walking
[1:32:12] away I seen little people when their
[1:32:14] little limbs wasn't hardly that big and
[1:32:16] he's talking about bones growing men and
[1:32:19] women eat up with cancer rise to the
[1:32:21] floor that hadn't stood up for months so
[1:32:24] weak they couldn't have stood up any
[1:32:28] other way but under the power of God and
[1:32:30] get up and walk around through the house
[1:32:32] praising God and get well what is it
[1:32:36] full surrender to God Amen that's what
[1:32:39] it takes a complete surrender and I just
[1:32:43] want you now as we
[1:32:45] pray if there's
[1:32:47] anything that is tethering you to this
[1:32:50] earth any fear is of what other people
[1:32:53] think or any Creature Comforts or
[1:32:56] control or finances or anything that's
[1:32:59] tethering you
[1:33:01] stubbornness seeing Jesus in a wrong way
[1:33:04] or you're you're bruised from the things
[1:33:07] that you've learn or upbringings or
[1:33:09] whatever it may be that's stopping you
[1:33:11] from surrendering and being a real bride
[1:33:14] and bringing a true wife or a true
[1:33:16] husband he's here tonight to restore
[1:33:19] true masculinity he's here tonight to to
[1:33:22] to restore true femininity not that
[1:33:25] rubbish out there they're
[1:33:26] confused they don't even know what a
