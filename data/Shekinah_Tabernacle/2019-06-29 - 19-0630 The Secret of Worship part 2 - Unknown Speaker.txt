control order and Lord we yield ourselves to your father and Jesus Christ a God bless you it's a privilege and an honor to be here and it's really good amen praise the Lord well without further ado if you can get that slideshow on and we'll thank you musicians we can turn on our Bible to second Samuel Chapter six who loves the Lord who's excited about the Lord Amen you know the Lord loves us to be excited about him you know he's a person he likes feelings he likes emotion he made them he created emotions this not pushed them down this not be disconnected from our emotions but let's have emotions towards him but higher than just any human emotion but a Holy Ghost emotion a feeling a heartfelt religion who want who loves heartfelt religion I believe that I'm amongst heartfelt religion who's thankful I'm so thankful to be a part of a group of people that have heartfelt religion amen not some man-made thing or some men directed something like that but just the holy guy a Holy Spirit amen well I know man I just need to get through about slide can you get me to slide 9 please brother oh man is that slide known maybe I didn't put it on here well you know what I'll do well just how do you blink that yes here we go okay let's just read so it says here now in second samuel chapter 6 verse 11 through 2:16 we're going to read and it says here 2nd samuel chapter 6 11 and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obed-edom that gets height three months and the Lord blessed open Edom and all his household I just want you to pay careful attention where the art represents the presence of God and the fullness of his word amongst the people right that's what it represents and so here is this man and he ends up with verse in his house what could happen oh my if the fullness of the word and the presence of God is in your house you cannot not be blessed amen if you are a child of the king hallelujah man if you're a Philistine you're gonna be in trouble you're gonna have gourds and whatever those things happen you know man oh my but when you're a child of the king and the acts in your house you're gonna have a good time and I believe that we are children of the king and the ark isn't our house or his house and we're having a good time amen hallelujah we'll just read Amen the revival started right there you know amen oh this is now an adoption revival not just any revival this is an adoption revival alleluia alleluia now just to get a context so let you sit down in a second but while we read this now to bring this why weird the way I'm angling the scripture here is is David as your eternal images your new nature your new man you know your new identity right so Dave is your new identity and McCall is your restricted old nature that is subject to politics cultures and the old nature of course is cursed by the fall so there's the two natures now we're not where this whole thing is going to be internalized inside each one of us okay so when you read that you just think about that alright and we'll go through it and it was told King David saying the Lord has blessed the house of obed-edom and all that pertain earth unto him because the Ark of God because of the Ark of God amen so David went and brought up the Ark of God from the house of Odin Edom into the City of David with Glenn amen how could you not Amen because this is the desire of God for so many years that his presence would come to Jerusalem amen hallelujah so you can see these two people very excited more but David and God were very happy about this occasion they want this is what this is what needed to happen and it was so that when they bought beer the Ark of the Lord had gone when they had there had beer the Ark of the Lord had gone six places he sacrificed opsins and fatlings and David danced before the Lord amen with all not some not 90% but everybody say all all has might Amen when I read that I thought men are that's why I always say spend all your energy on her name don't hold anything back whether it comes out of your mouth or it's inside here just spend it all amen hallelujah hallelujah amen and David was girded with a linen ephod so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet amen there's always shouting when there's a sound of a trumpet now we know in the scripture prophetically trumpets generally denotes the gospel going forth the truth going force the voice of the Lord declaring freedom for his people and war for his enemy amen and there's always shouting that goes with it amen it just goes hand in hand it's like wine and oil amen hallelujah it just goes together now second into verse 16 it says and as the Ark of the Lord came into the city of David McCall Saul's daughter and that's Keith at Saul's daughter now David thought he had finished with the enemy that conflicts men then had held him back and you know but had carried on the legacy continued a little bit down through came into his house even oh my oh my you see we thought we had we thought we had finished at all and then all of a sudden something happens in your like oh wow I haven't actually conquered that one yet it's still going you know the battle Stallone hallelujah amen the battle still on and the enemy will try and get you to the bitter end until he's cast into the lake of fire he's gonna try and get you he's trying but he can't and he's so mad because he can't because the Lord he didn't let the devil win they man no no no no hallelujah amen and so it says and as the afterworld came into the city of David McCall Saul's daughter looked through a look at me look at me look through a window okay he looked through a window now the window she looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart may the Lord adders blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord hey man well hallelujah you know I'm quite nervous actually but you know the Lord is gracious amen and I just have prayed a lot actually how the Lord will deliver this because in my heart I want to IIIi really feel of the law to to move right through all my notes this time and you know what it's like for me it's very difficult to get through your notes actually almost anyone that ministers you know they have struggles to get through all their notes you know because you there's just so much in the word and there's so much that you just get so excited about things then and you just take one scripture and it can open up everything you know but we have to now I just really feel we're just gonna do some reading Amen Alleluia so McCall inside look through the window and saw David the new nature the one that's rejoicing the one that's been to camp the one that went to the that goes to these convictions and jumps out all of a sudden while it's all on and all go then McCall sees something inside looking through what an earth are you doing you didn't do these things before this is not what you made of this is not what you were brought up like you are shamelessly uncovering yourself and I thought my when I read that I thought she just said something very he was shamelessly uncovering himself he was shamelessly uncovering his eternal self he was shamelessly uncovering what he was before the world was ever formed a man that's the oldest religion there is that who knows what the oldest religion here is does anybody know what the oldest religion mirrors now when I say religion and just two let's do some glossary when I say religion I don't mean the man controlled restricted type of religion I'm talking about the word religion as an expression of an inward faith so it's the outward works they're the fruits of an inward life that is what that's what what the word religion means I mean I know that in Christendom they've kind of diminished the word the religion to a negative thing and it can be a negative thing we can become just religious without the inner life it can be an outward shell but there's nothing on the inside but we don't want that and I don't believe we have that but we are susceptible to that and so if there's anything I say today that may seem like I'm trying it's negative or anything that's not that I'm trying to say that we've got that better it's an exposure of the enemy that will try and make us like that so it's always good to know his devices and expose him preempt him you know and we all fight it and we have our seasons sometimes I mean let me just share some of you the last time I preached this the first part I have suffered thick and thin until now and I'll probably suffer some more but but by the Lord's grace you know as you get challenged challenged so I've going around this thing the other time my shirt hanging out and I'm just man I just it was just out leaving I couldn't believe it I watched some of the videos he I can't believe it was me it was Michael looking at these windows go what the heck are you doing here but you know and I and what I was saying was you know the bet every divine expression God's Word has an appropriate reaction you know there's a reaction to his when he's looking for that he's looking for response he's looking for love he's looking for a reaction to his word because it's his thought and that's so and I'm like you know this is this and then man oh my I'd be sitting in the service and the devil is attacking trying to stop me from actually practicing what I just preached really strongly to it was hard my goodness you just have to fight you've got to push him back no matter how hard those thoughts they make you feel so negative they make you feel so down you have to push back you might not feel like pushing back in here and you might think it's hopeless to push back but just push back push the devil back because God did not let the devil win he didn't let the devil win hey man and if he has gone and taken something now you need to go into the enemy's camp and take back what he stole from you amen hallelujah amen so you see McCall now looking through saying you shamelessly uncovered yourself because now David was caught up in a thought he was caught up in such a thought his perception of what was happening there was different from shimmie eyes perception shimmie eyes perception was on man what's going on here this is they're just trying to work it all up Joe waves four six and once we've got more treasure in Jerusalem there because that thing's worth a lot of money in gold and whatever so you these different perceptions they weren't dancing around the art were they amen there was McCord perception she didn't eat she was just had her eyes off the Lord and she was looking at at the fellow believers so her perception was all I love he says having a good time Oh shamelessly uncovered but my David had a perception he perceives something great was taking place so if show me I had a perception and what he saw was such and what Joab saw was such and what McCall saw was such and what David saw was such what do you see because that same ah must come into your Jerusalem your Jerusalem is your heart when that comes into your Jerusalem the fullness of the word the manifestation of everything that God has the Adam lost and the spoken word comes in to fully give you everything that God has promised in this endtime hour before before the rapture there will be a full manifestation of the sons of God again coming to their adoption okay when that comes into your Jerusalem and I'm gonna bring this right into context right at the end you come to your full adoption and say this but when you receive the Holy Ghost you're receiving the spirit of adoption whereby you cry Abba Father there is the spirit of adoption to bring you to your adoption he's the tutor he's the teacher he's the deliverer he's the comforter because he knows that you're gonna go through some hard battles you're going to go through some really deep valleys and that you're gonna need a comforter you're gonna need a deliverer you're gonna need a teacher you're gonna need a guide through the darkest ages and the darkest times and the most perilous seas that are just going boisterous you'll need the spirit of adoption that would take you through that journey right across your life until finally you come to the heart of the earth the heart of your earth right there is where it all comes now I'll stop there with that and we'll come and revisit that later see if this works yeah here we go so sick and Samuel sucks first witnesses then David returned to bless his household and McCall the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said how glorious was the king of Israel today you know there is the Bible has sarcasm his sarcasm right here how glorious was the king of Israel today who shamelessly uncovered himself who's been through that before who's had that experience you know it might happen in the church but you just say don't care I'm going anyway I'm having a good time hey man I'm up here I don't worry about what anyone thinks I'm having a good time and then you know and you still battle a little bit there and you know you could stand in you feel like these eyes burning into your back you're watching you you never stood up before you never raised your hands before this burning in your back let's McCall telling you she's speaking come on if it you pushed it away and you do it anyway but then when you get home when you get home it gets worse what did you do you shamelessly uncovered yourself my that's what you did amen because way back when I read my book of Revelation when I read the book of Revelation I see a church I see a church having a very good time actually they're not talking they're not they're really shutting they're really praising amen you know why because the McCall never came up in the rapture only only David came in the rapture amen only that new nature comes up in the rapture Bissell curse pissed house that holds us down stays down here that's why up there they're reflecting the oldest religion in the world which is the shouting religious brother Brando I'll read the coin in a minute very good that's this here this you're what you're doing now is you know you're having this that there's an internal fight going on because you see the devil does not want us to shamelessly uncover ourselves now I'm speaking about it spiritually right I don't you know you get what I mean but it's a spiritual you're just letting the real you loose and that's the one that's connected with God do you know what happens it's like this whole snowball of glory that happens a snowball of glory oh man you can keep that one okay it's a snowball of glory because once it precipitates well that's a scientific way but once it starts or something ignites it it Kindles once it Kindles open you know and you and and you enter into something like it could be just a scripture and it just questions you and you think all of a sudden your perception of that scripture changes your perception of that promise changes that magnifies it it's greater it becomes more poignant it becomes more impressive to you and there and are we in it and it makes us more sufficiently impressed by the message of the gospel the message of Jesus Christ that we have in our midst it impresses then upon us and we see it and we perceive it more than how show me I perceive the art coming into Jerusalem more than how Joab saw the art coming into Jerusalem and there I say it more than how David saw the art coming to Jerusalem he would he was a prophet and he would have caught inspiration but we are in a higher age then David was a and we are now to perceive how that personally affects us and our life what does it mean to you the ark coming to Jerusalem five years ago I think it was we were in here and I was rejoicing because the thought of the ark coming to Wellington and raising up a church just made me so happy I was so happy and I'm still happy they've been real happy and it makes me wanna dance around this pulpit oh yeah because it's such a great thing that God would visit a land that's cursed and he would heal the land because there isn't nothing can hold God back when he wants to do something when he set his eyes upon a people when he has an Alexei din a place he's going to bless that land and he's gonna raise up a people the ark came to Wellington it's how I was dancing around you I came here really having a good time around that uh and I'm still having a good time but in the Lord opened this to me I'll share you a testimony but I'm not going to go into the details of the testimony but when I was in Vietnam I was I was actually researching worship in my room and I was having a good time and in the in while I was reading some quotes I I noticed that this it was the Prophet was speaking about a subject that went from the worship to what you know how with in revelation chapter five the lamb steps forth and takes the book and how from that one scripture now I was under inspiration at this time in it so you know when you're under inspiration in it especially as a minister you start seeing heaps of things and it all starts tying together and it's really amazing but I saw this version hustle you know and then the thought and I was like and as I was pondering over how that's caused different schools of thought right on how where the coming of the Lord and put in the context of what the coming of the Lord is and how he comes because you see if yes the Lord is coming everyone knows the Lord's coming and we know and and in some respects you know he's here so now this it's a fine line to differentiate between where he's here and he's coming and then I was thinking about now yes he's keys here spiritually and the fullness his Holy Ghost is here and His Holy Ghost as his Holy Ghost is here just like his Holy Ghost was in all the ages that he came and spoke but his Holy Ghost was just giving more now right his Holy Ghost has got all the inheritance now he just limited what they had in their different ages he limited what they had in the different times because they were coming through a process of restoration so he limited it but it was still him he just didn't help give everything he didn't open all of his book and give her the whole thing because they weren't ready for the rapture there he needed us to come if he gave him that we wouldn't even be here it would be a rapture only happen so can't give it all so he holds it back so he holds some back but he gives just enough for their age according to their revelation according to what he has purpose for them and then you have so there so yes the Lord come in the fullness of his presence right the faultless Holy Ghost come and opened the whole book and the Lord would and well the people and lead the people in the fullness of his prison so the church would come right up into his image and it would be she would be a perfect reflection of him right so that's think that's a that's the spiritual coming of the Lord the Holy Spirit and the fullness of his presence but then there's a corporal coming of the Lord you know then there is the the physical body that's up in there and I'm thinking about this right I'm going wow that's quite cool in it but and I've many times cuz I feel for I see this sign and I'm seeing the Sun I'm seeing how they kind of antagonistic and I'm praying Lord what you know and he knows very well that I've many times tried to start writing things out to balance it but it just goes like this as I spoke to change it just goes massive so wide that you can't come you cannot it's too much too much maybe some people can but not it's too much for me anyway and it just goes you know like your strings you get strings of thoughts and it just the strings just go a meter wide you know and you just can't convince I'll it because it's too much just at one scripture you know just one little verse that's like ten words goes too much for my brain and too much earlier and I see it but I can't describe it I see it and I see how it all comes together but you try and describe the head it's just too much you can't you'll miss something out you'll unbalance something and then the Lord said to me in some way it was inaudible but he said to me go back and have a look at how the ark comes to into Jerusalem before Solomon is a there's a season where the ark is in Jerusalem and a tent I'll leave that there I hope if we run can catch that maybe you can't isn't the ark comes into Jerusalem in a tent moving it can move around it's not an it's fixed corporal body yet that Solomon would build but just under that Ministry of David the app would come into Jerusalem in a tent and and when I saw that the Lord just blew it open and it just balanced the whole thing and that's why I get so excited about this because that is if you see that and you pray about it I'm not gonna go that I'm not gonna go deep that was just the testimony the Lord gave me this amazing experience how it would balance such a complex thought such a complex thing to balance because of the different and it's not really complex it's simple really when you see it like that you see I was actually very simple but man try to over explain these things that's why when a prophet preach the Seventh Seal he says stop don't try and explain it and become so spiritual and understandable it's not a doctrine to person it's a coming of the Lord and how he comes because it's so important that we realize how he comes but not just realize like I understand it but you need a heaven it needs to be real in you hello lawyer so what do you see when you see the ark coming to Jerusalem what does that type show you I know what it shows me it shows me that my King has come down in his spiritual form and he's come inside me inside this tent inside this Jerusalem the act came here so it went from just the ark coming - Ellington and me rejoicing and I realized that the ark is coming here and he's beating at the gate hallelujah and he's removing all of the things that would hinder that that's why you go for a trial that's why he's rubbing you the wrong way sometime that's why you get pruned down to a stump every now and again MA that's why because he's trying to bring up pure yes we sound purify my heart because he wants to come and live in there and his fullness of his presence but until it but around there you know this before David got in there to Jerusalem remember what was surrounding the hut it was complexes it was invalids there was false images of humanity they were surrounding it but and they what were they doing does he not remember what those those lame halt and blind people were sent there for around the walls of Jerusalem they were sent here to mock David so here's the King it's meant to be in there it's be in the heart of Jerusalem he's meant to be dinging pitch it in there in the heart of Jerusalem the land was to come to its adoption you know they've been so long since Joshua or five hundred years and then finally now they're finally getting their heads together like and that means getting rid of the heads because they're thinking too much and they're trying to roll each other or I know this and that and overthink it you know I never figure it out and trying to preach it and make it all happen but if they just died to themselves you know and and God could have just you know God raised up the king and he's so he's beating it because that land the this role needed to come to Jerusalem that's where God wants to be that's where the art needs to be it stayed in Shiloh for so long students at Shiloh is tranquil silence the hick here's the the fullness of the word the spoken word that you would speak in at all heaven and it's sitting in your Shiloh silent sitting in your Shiloh I'm usable yet but it's there because you came in the land they are led you into the land the axe stays in your shiloh stays in silence because you know but you receive the Lord the spirit of adoption crossed over the captain comes down into your life doesn't he the Holy Ghost comes down lead you comes down to bring you to adoption until finally he's at the gate of Jerusalem and he's the one that went up up the gutters he's the one that went up through the gutters that has mony and tunnels to defeat those complexes out in your life so that David could enter in he's the one the kept and the Holy Ghost the spirit of adoption he's the one that comes up into your spirit comes into your conscience comes into your reasoning comes into your affections comes into your imaginations he's the one that pushes those things back he's the one that comes up through the gutters of your life to defeat those complexes and all those things that's why you're going through these things right now that's why it's all happening that's why you're being tried through the refiners fire the full of soap is washing over you that's why you're suffering you must suffer suffering is just as important as victory actually you don't get victory without suffering and you can't learn obedience and miss you suffer even Jesus God and flesh suffer and learn can you how do you reconcile I still fully don't actually understand that but I see but the scripture says it so I'm gonna say it anyway he learned obedience through the things which he suffered and that's why you suffer as you're on a journey you've come through those of you if you haven't come into the land if there's someone in here that has not got the Holy Ghost and you are holding on to what something of your own you're holding on to your will you want to do this you want to do there you want to be this you want to be that let go and the one that made you the one that created joy the one that created satisfaction he he will come into you oh my oh then what what happens then you come into the land that's the beginning of your journey the filling of the Holy Ghost my you know those for us because I have to it now minister to those that have got the Holy Ghost who come now show you how the captain come down into your life when you got the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost was the captain right before I understand the Holy Ghost is the captain and he's ready to give you your inheritance little by little he said not everything at once even though it's in you it's that the access to it the faith to believe it the things that hold back faith to believe as or as also in you everything that Israel had and their experience in the promised land and all of their journey happens inside you this is your because jesus said the kingdom of God is not thus Jerusalem out here he said to the Pharisees it's not what you see with your eyes but it's actually within you and the king the headship when he comes into your life hallelujah he's the one that knocks on the gates of your Jerusalem he's the one the headship he's looking this desire his desire for you is that you would have access full and free blank chicks written signed in the blood of Jesus are you to write full and free access to everything that Adam lost everything that Jesus displayed everything that he displayed when he was here in the flesh he wants to give you full and free access so when the King starts to deal in your life when David starts to deal in your life he has one thing in my true Salaam ah-ha-ha that's what he's looking for but around that heart as I seen as these images at YouTube one time one image going into here can cause months years half a life of trouble for you that's why I'm big on that and it's not just you two but it's it's me tube to hey man you know the things that we see in the flesh something that someone did to us maybe our parents failed when we were young and they did something wrong and it really impacted us and it formed one of those false images around our heart and it just sat there for many years after you got the Holy Ghost and you're on cloud nine it was all good and everything was fine everything was amazing and everybody was loved there was no troubles no schism ZnO nothing you were just in your cloud nine of the Lord you didn't know those things with you you didn't know that the suffering that you would go through you didn't know that the refiner fire would come down through your life and the king would come and he would start but he will start a siege it lay siege to your Jerusalem now right now for those of you that have got the Holy Ghost and for those of you that will get the Holy Ghost there's a siege waiting or there's a siege in place any CGT who knows what a siege is amen a siege a siege for though you don't know what a seizures are seizures when the enemy comes and they set up camp riot around you're right around a city and they stay there until that city gives up surrenders or or or or dies of starvation well they eat themselves I mean it's just really that's not a pretty sight this is the case like oh my I think you said too much I think I said too much you know something's just come out and then you realize I shouldn't but there's a siege going on but it's a good seat this with our heart is under siege by the King of glory by the captain of the host - hallelujah who's coming up and he's dealing in your spiritual realm he's dealing because he wants the up he wants the fullness of the word to come out of your Shiloh out of the wrist out of silence Alleluia the Lord help me out of silence so that it can come up here to speak you know my all things are possible hallelujah hallelujah that's the context it's like 14 yeah so after you know this is David now he's he's he's awesome his perception was powerful enough the thought that he perceived you see that the app came to Jerusalem right the ark came to Jerusalem and there's all these onlookers and their perceptions are all at different places right when the word comes forth here and the Ark is like coming down to you Jerusalem there's all different perceptions theme some perceptions as where David's or some perceptions may be where you know I don't know Joab some perceptions may be wherever they are you know what you're perceiving you know what that thought is doing to you it's quite important because that thought the thought of God the thought of God right when it's spoken as God's Word right inside that word he said my words are spirit and they are life so there is life inside the word which is God's life God's life is in the word that life has got power that life that's why I was so rejoice when we was singing there is power power wonder-working power because you know that's that power was inside the thought and by God's grace ask someone see look the other day a revelation but maybe it was me I might've been talking to somebody about revelation ask for it or was itwas than Emily alter revelation you cannot only by revelation that's why we're told ask for revelation amen don't try and figure it out with your mind this is not an education house this ain't no Victoria University auditorium amen where you have to use your strength to learn hallelujah you don't have to use your strength to learn young people you don't have to use your strength to learn stop your coloring in listen I'm talking to the young people you don't they hate school a lot of them mine are there right they get used to it but they don't cause they have to make an effort they've gotta and they it's outside if they don't want to do that they want to go and play they want to go and have fun they want to get out on the field and kick the ball is that right does it do I have you the young people or they want to go and draw or play princesses right that's what they want to do they don't want to be trying to figure out maths and trying to learn English and trying to learn all these things and doing all these lines getting to teaching for getting in trouble they don't want to do that but they have to and they've got to use their mind and their intellect to try and do it but with God it is different with God he gives you he gives it to you it's yours take it he gives it to you young people when you don't understand something ask God reveal it to me law amen now he might go okay I'm gonna reveal to you right now and you get a revelation and my wall but it just might come in time it'll come in time generally you know you hear you ask God for something he's going to give it to you amen that's revelation when you get that revelation what it does as it reveals forethought and your perception of the fork I think this thing is is this doing something naughty yeah it working I hate Amy your perception of the event cuz it's an event right now we're under we're in an event and this event is there's an event taking place than here not because I'm here because we're here but because he's here and he's doing something he wants to take his bride and he wants to take her from here and do something for her for you he's coming down into your home into your heart and he's siege in your Jerusalem see Jing on a good a very good seat I like that seat and it puts pressure and that pressure reveals something that was mocking David now this is where pictures you know because these things that are surrounding Jerusalem were mocking David and you we all know that there's things in our life that just they just they just stick and every now and again it comes out and you think man that just hit the Lord you know it hurt the lawn and that's what those things are but just remember this a captain as Lang see the king is intent on getting the app from your Shiloh and bringing it from your Shiloh and bringing it to your Jerusalem so that you have fallen free access but if you don't understand that and this is just going over your head a revelation is it anybody that doesn't understand is it clear real clear amen David says this is after now he's been accused he says tomorrow all do better than that hallelujah a man that's what you need to do when you get all down you know and I'll just say this so after you know when the youth camp right and the youth man I wasn't the I wish I was it was it sounds so cool but they were jumping and dancing and singing him they were free and now my goodness they would have been battling McCall like you wouldn't believe I'm sure cuz they'd never done these things before most of them but they had to break that field of resistance they had to break those things to be free to shamelessly uncover themselves to uncover what they really are and what they really feel shamelessly not shame because the glory is snowballing and as the glory snowballs the perception of what you're going through becomes so great you can't contain yourself and all that you thought you were and you thought you would never do your doing or not doing your going amen this these things now but what happens is now after the Kemp she's waiting McCall is waiting she's gonna get you while you're having a bad day she's gonna get you while you're down on Monday morning terrible Tuesday wicked Wednesday by wicked Wednesday you need the prayer matey but right there they eat right at the darkest hour if you don't keep your eyes on Jesus amen hallelujah she starts to talk to you you know you've got a self style you've got to conduct yourself in a certain way because your peers will think you're like this think you're trying to be spiritual that's not what it is you just have to take the devil right back to that event where you were free and you have to say you think that's bad you wait til Wednesday night amen you wait til Sunday morning hallelujah I'm gonna just do whatever it takes to express my eternal self not by just doing it because it's not that when you are in that envelope of glory we'll use that word when you're in that place your perception changes and all of a sudden that makes it even greater and you just keep even worse amen hallelujah amen now I'm not advocating that everyone needs to be jumping and cartwheeling right but if you feel like you need to do but the just the fact that just needs to happen it's starting here there's no point in you're doing it all out here and it's not in here right otherwise it's just it's just a put-on it's an emotional lifting up but I'm not talking about an emotional lifting up this morning I'm speaking about our Holy Ghost lifting up by the word by your perception of the word because it's a thought inside that thought is God's life and when it's spoken and you see what is being spoken before of it has got power to take you out of that seat but power to take you out of yourself but it's what you see when it's being preached I can't really is so hard to describe this the goo snowball glory I'll let a man do that snowball glory bro hallelujah you know a snowball when I say snowball we're talking about when a snowball starts rolling it gets bigger and bigger right when you start praising and when you start worshiping when you start giving him glory when suddenly happens it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and it doesn't go away the thought is eternal and it goes past your memory you don't forget it stays in here then when someone touches that spot again look out people look out McCall she's going down amen you know McCall became fruitless because of that nature that were you allowed again I'm the same we allow to govern us or mockolate Lord that nature is fruitless can't be fruitful when that nature when she's when you listen to her don't listen to her when she starts going at you you not you need to say tomorrow I'll do better than that hey man yes sir he said don't you know I was dancing unto the Lord and he says he crossed over oh my won't he cross over he crossed over something a man he deported himself into another dimension by praise why because when you praise with real praise the Lord inhabits the praises of his real praise amen he was in the land of the promise and he lost all self styles and muck of the world he was so happy to know the ark was coming into his own City I've got another quote down here so you don't want to read that now it says here you know god looked down out of heaven and he said David you're a man after my own heart this is this is what really touches the heart of God is when someone is willing to just worship lose self style cross over hallelujah deport yourself a man one day we really got a deport a man but why not have a temporary deportation Amen hallelujah this world is stale and wicked enough you know massive leave the world leave it hallelujah Amen my David you're a man after my own heart see he had done lost all pride he had done lost all of hers yes he was married yet he was married to a king's daughter but that wasn't even considered is that saw coming back again complex limitation there was a gift inside David David had a gift inside him now catch this this is quite a big Thorpe it inside David as the whole anointing and the gift and the calling to to take everything that was promised by Joshua and make it a reality and even before he was crowned the King had already started to happen that's why things are happening here because David's coming into Jerusalem of your life that's why you're seeing but there is already happening you're seeing the inheritance that was promised by our prophet our Joshua all that stuff you know twenty years ago it would seem a possible to see it in reality now you see we're seeing it we're seeing the dawning and the inheritance coming because of the atmosphere because David is welcome because we were sick and tired of the time of Judges a man was sick and tired of the politics and sick and tired of all that he says she says politics and grudges and unforgiveness and all that stuff and all the ministerial Fighting's circulat because david can't be king under their hemisphere the only way David can be king as winning all the differences are humbled and people died to themself because he's the head Jesus is the head when Jesus is the hid not by what we say we preached it for forty years but now when it becomes your life saying it not you anointing David King with this but was this it was this your whole life anointing him King this makes a difference because in them inside him is the very calling the very anointing the very ability that's Jesus I'm talking about to inherit all the message to inherit everything to to make it a reality to take now the arc from your shiloh from a place of silence in your life and put it into your Jerusalem I'll repeat myself again that's why you're going through all these trials that's why when you fail and you say something to someone or you get into a altercation all these things happen and you realize it was wrong and all the pride and all the defenses and all of those insecurities and all those things come up because the captain is knocking he's seeing your Jerusalem because he has one intent he wants the fullness of the word he wants the arc inside the heart and that's really in the Hat but in the Jerusalem of that you know there's a heart hidden there's a heart inside the heart you know there are doors in a door amen there's a lot of doors in a heart Amen just open them all hallelujah open them all and let the King comin ah it'll help me Jesus oh my I mean I'm preaching to me too this is all of us but together we have to use wisdom amen we have to you know carry ourselves with an excellent spirit which is God's Spirit in the middle of Babylon all lowliness and meekness and loving-kindness but then our faults rub up against other people's faults and their faults rubbin all those things bring things out now you don't go in react to the person and go and try and sort something out and try to figure out what the Lord is working on you it's look at yourself and say God change me Lord Jesus I know your seed you'd my Jerusalem I know that you were getting rid of those images that have mocked you all my life and it's time hallelujah but the reasons happening is because we're in the season where adoption is coming we were coming into the adoption but before you can handle the fullness of God's word operating in your voice like it was in the time of Adam before the fall like it was when the second Adam was walking the earth like it was when brother Branham came to his adoption when he spoke it to you it must be a maturity because you can you imagine I mean even you see Elijah the Prophet and a shadow of what we receive he was a prophet of course as calling was a prophet right you don't I'm not talking about the office I'm talking about the the creative power and a man's mouth so God would as a prophet he spoke cursed over those children and it was not wrong until they were killed by a beer because there was not the character or the temperance because there was a mocking thing in his heart that winner mocked it did something and it caused all that destruction on those children now now for us to have the fullness of that where you speak in it happens that's why those mockers around the Jerusalem must be delivered by the captain and he's there he's here I know because I'm going through it all my is not easy but that's essential hallelujah we're clay he's the Potter and he's molding and he's shaping oh my Alleluia as he knowed that he was acquainted with possessor of heavens and earth and here was the Word of God coming right back among them again Alleluia and David was so happy he danced he danced as hard as he could Miriam she grabbed the tambourine and went down the bank dancing on the other side after she had come through the Red Sea and seen her enemies drowned and then she could dance in the spirit when she seen she seen the enemies they had tormented her can you imagine that those people that had worked her all her life and hurt her children probably killed some babies I don't know but enemy Wow you know one day you're gonna watch all those demons burn all the ones that have troubled you took it taken family members done all those things you know watch them but she she really she's seen yo she got caught up in the fault of you know when that happened when you can get caught up in the fall cuz there is an event that took place and it was an expression of God songs when you get caught up in it oh and there's no McCall to restrict you you were there you were there with them when they dancing the tempering you were there with them when they shouted in the walls of Jericho felt and you were there when Rahab came out hallelujah because of the anointing because of the Spirit of God in you and the thought when it's revealed to you it becomes personal to you and you see yourself in the scriptures you were there now this is where this is the essence of what I'm trying to say it's the thought of God the thought it's powerful and when you get caught up in that fall can change your life and your reaction becomes appropriate to the word to what's being expressed because it's that there is a reality there is a it's a two-way relationship it's not a one-way relationship where the preacher just preaches out and you sit there alone it's not passive this is not a passive situation that we're in no we are all up and caught up in an event right now we're caught up and it's not me it's not you it's well it has us but yet God he's like glowing the situation together cuz his thoughts are coming forth and he's looking for seeking such that would worship Him in spirit and in truth he's seeking people then it gets excited about the art coming into their life hallelujah she's seen the enemies that had told me to do did and she doesn't that's right now see after after the barrels one then the glory of the Lord comes down okay Joe 38-7 says when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy that is your eternal image because that thought and I said that last time but I'll say it again that thought was as in God's mind right in God's mind you shattered an eternity now we don't remember that because we've been somehow trapped into this cookie of time but in God's line an eternity which never began and never will in you your release all shouting joy joy sing joy and speak singing together that's what he saw you saw that now when we go in the rapture and we come up into eternity when we're back there we will remember that because it will help with us we're in a store remember has our thoughts we think something I mean it's gone think that his thoughts are eternal when he thought that and saw you that was it now you're on a journey back to that now your your your Jerusalem's being sieged so you can come back to that and we're going to leave this earth and come up into a glorious body and remember what that was is and it wasn't when we get there won't be was it'll be is it would be shouting amen hallelujah it's like a pre vision of what we're doing around the throne like now you know I mean that sounds really crazy but it's kind of happening already yet we're experienced somehow our consciousness is down here experiencing this to develop an appreciation for redemption to develop worship to to have a relationship where there is a choice amen someone said brother branham you got some of that there new kind of religion heaven you I said no I got a good dose of the old kind hey man I said I said I mean that shout it heat now he's saying this to Victor brother Brown I said I mean that shouting religion he said that's the oldest religion was ever known I said God asked job where were you when I laid the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy 10,000 years before the world was ever formed amen going to call me Holy Roller anyhow so you might as well get ready get used to it amen was I gonna say that yeah oops I think I might not say that all okay in 1956 in German Christ brother branham has his own breakthrough over McCall is you know I've always a sort of a timid sort of person haunted a timid sort of person this is a little something about myself Monday night so we can just let down our collars and talk a moment when I first seen the Full Gospel people and heard them clap their hands and I thought as a Baptist now they sure have some church members don't or dignities anyhow I thought Meyer that's horrible and then to beat it all and here got somebody on the floor and started dancing up and down on the floor oh my I just didn't understand some young ladies wanted to beat some little tin cans and things and they had a washboard and some symbols on it or on their fingers how about we go back to washboards and thimbles and tin cans a man they had a good time hallelujah hallelujah and a little blonde headed sister about so high jumped out in the floor and started dancing so I looked around and I thought my where did dancing ever come from and I was sitting there in the seat of the scornful now here is a prophet messenger sitting in the seat of the scornful not understanding but he's about honesty of course you know it's not saying nothing I was he wasn't he just said he didn't say anything he was just observing this girl dancing in his church now on the in the front you know you can imagine like this is now very different from what he's used to now McCall is getting stirred up so then I begin to rehearse in my mind then in the Bible they did dance and I thought when they danced what was it dancing was spoke off when Pharaoh was pursuing Azrael and all the enemy was drowned now he's thinking about this he's pondering these things in his mind this is what happens when you ponder the word when you start thinking about God and the thought of God the thought is coming he's getting caught up in the thought this is what we need this is what I'm preaching when Maryam picked up a tambourine and began to beat the tambourine and begin to dance and all the daughters of Israel followed her dancing I thought well there they had victory well I thought the only thing is the matter with me I just ain't got enough victory maybe in a few minutes something happens I like it when something happens don't you love it when something happens hallelujah now this might shock you when when he says here when I came back to myself so something heaven and he lost consciousness hallelujah you know sometimes you get in such a position in your McCall that you that you can't God has to take you out Sovereign Grace let's take and take you out of your consciousness to bring you up to where you need to be and I pray that today if there's anybody in here that needs that it's something to you may something happen to you hallelujah when I come to myself now I put any linear shamelessly I'm covered now cuz he's now he's like whoa what now I'm like you know like he's now reflecting the oldest religion in the book and now reflecting what it was before the world ever began what it was an eternity what was happening in the church service and glory hallelujah he now is shamelessly he was reflecting it but God took him out of himself to get Alleluia I was out there with that little girl dancing out on the phone hallelujah you have no license to dance you are free to dance amen hallelujah can you imagine an endtime word prophet that was used to open the seven seals under the leader of the Lamb of God a prophet that the dead that was called to do that a new night bride and bridegroom as now shamelessly uncovered dancing with a girl out on the floor of the church that's right just the thing that I thought I wouldn't do and I'm sure there's people thinking that right now I wouldn't do that but I can tell you now if something happened to you to you to you to you to all you you will be doing that hallelujah amen just the thing I thought that I wouldn't do hey man oh my I did and when I well I was never on a dance for my life but I guess I did it all right ha ha amen you know I want to go back to that convention again because it was just such an empowering but there were people dancing on that floor that had never danced in their life there was no smooth moves going on man it was just all limbs men we were moving something happened hallelujah something beautiful you know you could have got the dance teachers from some dance school coming in there going oh my goodness what's this but that that was beautiful because God was seeing liberty God was seeing freedom God was seeing people able after years of McCole rolling their life to express and shamelessly uncover their eternal nature that's what you are and I pray with all my heart that something would happen to cause you to come out of your Kip go beyond yourself and be able to allow God this is mercy and grace I'm so thankful for this quote and where I was never on a dance floor in my life but I guess I did it alright it what I sure felt awful good and here this is what I just like this I had a lot of victory after that can you in the Liberty now this is like this is a milestone in the prophets life and it's a milestone in our life when something happens to take us out of our self so that we can worship God the way that he wants to be worshipped and when the thought comes and we get the revelation of the foot the reaction is according to the revelation and there's a there's a continuity there is a synchronization is not really the perfect word for it but there is a dovetailing between you and him God in his bride the marriage union is in love it's these feelings heartfelt glory to God what made David so happy it was the significance it's significantly revealed he saw the significance of the arc coming back and in that the office of that gift near his life would have been so stirred to see a desire of God because God's patient why this way until man's ready I mean his heart can come to Jerusalem he would have wanted a sock in Jerusalem straight away take that city but he waits it and he watched them fuss for four hundred years and kill each other and matter and come under permissive wills and this and that and out of it and revivals death all sorts of horror he watched he just watched and waited just like he's watching and waiting and our lives for the Ark he wants it David wanted a David got caught up and now you see what's happening in your life the spirit of adoption the Holy Ghost himself that's come down into your life to lead you is intent on bringing that fullness out of silence in your life bring the fullness of the word bring the fullness of your inheritance and everything that you are promised at all of it to give you full and free access to take it from silence and bring it into your Jerusalem where it comes and clicks into place where where it can finally be fully realized and the worship can open it it's right there blessing yeah it unlocks the fullness of the blessing the real blessing that is inheritance and all of it for you and for a Christian and a lik believer it's right there tied into that this is why you're going through these things this is why it's hard but keep your eyes on Jesus when there's fear all around you keep your eyes on Jesus amen all the raging and Rolly is trying to make you forget who you have with you oh my every time the enemy comes I'll just push the babe push him back push him back keep him back push him speak take out your soul when you don't feel like it take it out anyway push him back keep him back he's gonna fight you until he's got no teeth and then he's gonna come you hallelujah and you will fight him and if the Lord tarries and you're 90 you're gonna gum him as well hallelujah and then when you leave this earth then you're there's no more devil to hurt you or try to hurt you amen just keep finding them and pushing him back keep them back you can't encourage you just push them back when the call tries to raise up and tell you not to worship or not to do this or you know you don't haven't done that for three weeks so you shouldn't do it anymore do it again hallelujah push it back not just at this with these with the priests praise how am I you see I I can you can come to the church feeling rotten you've had bad fights arguments whatever you just come back make it right push back the enemy push back the enemy my shirt still in good I hate the thought just came is your shirt hanging out what ha ha ha ha a bit of make sure I'm still in composure amen push back the enemy just keep pushing him if you don't push him he's gonna keep pushing back at you he wants you to stay back here and then crumble you down on the ground but just remember where he really is he's under here and you just keep him under there every time you praise him in God and habits the praises it's like the the Holy Ghost just comes down and pushes them down with brazen feet judgement on the devil push them down to the ground keep them down there praise the Lord give Him glory give them order and you'll have a snowball of glory a snowball of glory and it will just snowball a snowball of snowball it's all this no devil can touch you amen there'll be snow balls rolling all over the place hallelujah too big for the devil too conquer too big for him to even try hallelujah but he's so proud you'll still try you know the devil still tries to tell me there's no God sometimes and I'm like a serious what the heck come on man don't you give up seriously I mean you know I mean he just he's got like this recurring meeting his brother food he's talked about just cancel the meeting he just keeps trying you know if the devil tries hard he's working hard you know we were talking about the University you know and that thought came while we were fellowship me you know the devil is working his tricks in the universities right every but just it's speaking about the university he's working as tricks he's working hard to bring these people into a limited state of humanity to bring pull these people away from God and make them scientifically minded and and just so depressed he wants them to kill him if hear his way the university would all commit suicide yeah this is what he wants and the ones that don't know that the ones that he or use for politicians to corrupt the world even further or something right it's what he wants lucky hat and I thought smoking the brother in power the brothers if the devil's working hard and he's edit all the time why can't we be hallelujah and it's not just for the missions it's for the for yourself for your family for this church for this body of Christ and New Zealand amen we have to fight I must fight if I must reign increase my courage law amen when the bully of the of the valley comes down you just say I'm going to pummel him and I'm talking about a devil now not a person we don't want to pummel humans but if the devil comes out and demons start trying to take back the valley we could take this valley you know they're people next door we won't go but anyway you know you see we're on the winning battle men we are on the highest power team hallelujah just the thought we hit discussions about this and even the discussion don't even remember vividly dislikes you know praying under any type of anointing or any just speaking about Vic minute they got Nick Merritt they're moving out that's the Lord take this valley can take this valley we're in this thing supernatural thoughts we're dealing with spirits that hold areas and strongholds and they work like that says principalities and powers and rulers and high places there's demon powers ruling politics and holding nations down our prayers have the power to push them back and see God's children come out they do we have to take it back start on yourself then starter your and that you when your and their then start with your home and move into the local body it out spread the influence of God's glory by prayer by holding on a man however you're gifted how the Lord's gifted you it's why the Bible says make your calling and election sure give all diligence oh and if he says do that and he will he will what's the word he will categorically show you what your calling is what you're here for it might not be all of it but at least the next part the next stage of your life the next pile your calling whatever he's called you to do what he wants you to do now evil evil he will he has to because he wants you to know he doesn't want us going and middling and other spheres as much as you know there's no harm and trying something and if it doesn't work Carey I get back to the drawing board you know pray hey that one was for free and how we got there but it's tinted Roman I'll just read it romans 8 verse 12 15 it says therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh you shall die but if you live through the spirit and mortify the deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not seek the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father what does he do remember I said way back I said the Holy Ghost come spirit of adoption and we're in the season where we're coming up to the full measure of Christ you know it's not a limited revelation that he's bringing he's bringing everything is no restraint to the inheritance that he hold now he has come the spirit of adoption comes into your life to take you right through the land until you get to Jerusalem when you get to Jerusalem he gets rid of the complexes that surround you that's why we're going this works so hard then he finally you come into Jerusalem conquering the very adoption why what happens next it was second samuel 5 when they came in next the outcome that's what he wants that's the desire of God as our adoption he wants to see himself in you he wants to see the church the bride reflect him and accept these bodies but she comes right up just before the glorified state when the up comes in it's just we're right I believe it now that's as an as an on an age level dispensational e we're right there these people that are just come out of it gonna come through and it kind of bring the right up to the very spot where we're at that's why ministry ministers an entrance to pick the people but it's been paved there we're right there it's there's a siege happening it's a CJ a man you gonna let him who's who wants to let the Lord and open your heart let him deal with those complexes when they rise when you fail when you see it winners light shines on it say Lord your captors here I know coming I want to let you deal with those things that mock you but I want them to mock you anymore and I want them to to to just go and push back take my Jerusalem I want the siege to end in victory for the one that's eating not for the Jebusites that are hiding aside yeah you know I mean it goes as deep as you want it to go but the GPUs eiders are threshing that's why the angel came to do it on the threshing floor it's the threshing right pipes the devil's got against you the thing that restricts you you know when that's defeated you're going there's gonna be no restriction there's always a right purge there's something weakness in your life the devil he has this right punch really hits you sometimes you know my you know that's about to be completely removed I really believe that that will be removed as David enters as the headship the King comes down and the arc gets invited they bring me up a man and if anyone's thinking of the other things that happen between Shiloh and in the arc as a completely different subject I don't want to over but you know there's a lot that happens just before over datums house it goes to the Philistines and all that but we won't even hurt there too much that in itself as a series that's so amazing that shows all the things that's gone on in the message and all the things that's happened over the last 50 years it's all there as well but we're just dealing from open to here well from Shiloh but we're kind of missing out a big chunk of things in events that took place but the ark came from silence in your life silence the Seventh Seal silent but then it would speak has to speak has to come a time where he would speak and it would restore everything back and this is just me in fellowship but you know when he comes in as corporal body who is the cloud of witnesses that's awesome who's was them are you were them a man who's with them we are with him what is in your mouth what is in your mouth the word full and free access you'll be speaking you well I believe this I can't prove it but that we will we with him and we will work together to britt bill betty to mak speak the soggy let's it'll be quite nice you know and maybe i don't know it's just my own little supernatural fantasy about how good it's going to be but you know you should ponder on these things it's nothing wrong with pondering over how it will be how glorious it will be armor amen can i have the musicians please it's it's play um that song be still i will do the Hillsong be stall and then we're gonna do the what's them are called Isaac's be still amen while we're sitting up I'm just playing that musics playing guys want to read this quote here it says and this who knows how brother Barron talks about that baby staring into space you know who you know the story about brother Branham talks about that woman who has that lady that has that baby and she's worried about the baby steering into space I just want to read this now I'm not I'm not I'm not reading this to say that we're in this condition but I'm reading this in light of being avoiding this condition avoiding that place that people can get to that we can get to where we get so acclimatized to his glory where we get so accustomed to what we have that we lose the the zeal of his house where things become common and our reaction becomes like a steering baby but we don't want to get like that and so I just want to read this just to show you what the Prophet says he says in Louisville Kentucky a few weeks ago there a mother pecking a little baby along and she walking along there and she was shaking little toys you know saying see darling see darling then she had get something else see darling see darling the little baby just kept steering and after a while it kind of disturbed the people in the store finally she picked up a little bell that jingled she said look darling look look look Mama's darling look and the little baby just stared out and she fell across the counter and and the little and the people come to help her and they said what's the matter she said oh my little boy here not long ago said just started to steering right out in space and she said I took him to the doctor a while ago and she said he was better but he isn't said nothing will attract him nothing will attract them Syd things that bought to attract the little boy his age that doesn't attract he just sits and stares how true that is with the church today God shook every kind of a gift he can before the church and they still sit and stare looking for something else remember enjoy now don't look look forward fine don't let that be and my room for you to miss your worship don't let the future become at night but worship God but who he is be thankful for what you have and rest and and enjoy the present revelation of God otherwise you'll miss it and I'm preaching to myself my a visionary type of person where I keep looking for things and building things and making China and I and I and the board dealt with me about three years ago about it and and and see stop it you're actually missing now as you're so busy looking and building for the future you're missing mmm this is Lisa this isn't hallelujah that's right go God's going to get tired shaking gifts before you after a while we sit paralyzed that's all they see how he sees paralyzed I thought that was quite key because you know God's called us to live hey man I that's off now he's called us to walk he's called us to walk and I want to read it I want to read you a scripture he sees here is here oceans 110 that he might walk worthy of the Lord and to all pleasing being fruitful remember McCall was not fruitful he wants you to walk and to all pleasing that were pleasing as I've got a powerful meaning I can't remember I had a brother that's not him you can look it up and see all pleasing being fruitful and every good work being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all mine according to his glorious power after all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness amen that word walk means to tread all around so you see that David nature you've got to take take your land push back the enemy and Trent all around because your footsteps is position take your leg take it back take it back they hold never stop playing home because he never stops working he never stopped stealing God continues to work these tireless and so as the enemy never stops trying to so you have to take it back you wake up the night you wake up in the morning take it back the devil tries to rob you in a drink nice to put you under a lush spirit or something but in a dream take it back push back don't let him don't let those anointings reside in your mind push it out you may feel like it does nothing and you train you could come out and you feel no different it's different that just leaves a residue because when the emotion of the thought and the devil puts the newcomers and you kick it out the residue still there takes a while - unless you
