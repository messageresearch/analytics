feast to be called as your bride Lord knowing that you said many are called but few are chosen Lord and it's with great humility in our hearts Lord that we we acknowledge the divine call of God in each one of our lives Lord and we we know that we are not of this world will we live in it but we're not over we're over of a different Kingdom Lord were of your kingdom where pilgrims and we're strangers here Lord we don't we don't fit anywhere Lord but we fit in your kingdom Lord Jesus Lord we fit in the New Jerusalem we fit Lord at the wedding feast we fit and fellowship with you we fit and fellowship with each other with the Saints Lord we fit with David with Isaiah we fit with Paul we fit with Peter we quit with John we fit with lose that we fit with all the Saints through the ages law we fit with brother Branham that's where we fit Lord and we're so glad Lord that we're that were of that Kingdom Lord because that's the everlasting kingdom Lord that will never fade Lord and there's something inside of us Lord that yearns for that Lord and as we see the signs at the times happening as our around us Lord it excites our soul Lord if we one of yours it excites us Lord so I just want to pray a blessing upon the service this morning Lord me take control and we just want to commit at all to your hands bless brother bin Lourdes he's ministering properly at this point in time now just pray a blessing this is the the words that he speaks Lord may he step aside and let you continue to minister through him and give him a safe trip back home we just pray in Jesus name Amen amen praise the Lord just where you're standing I just want to read um 2nd Timothy 3 verse 1 and so second Timothy 3 verse 1 says the snow also then in the last days perilous times shall come that's all I wanted to read from that one and I want to go also just had this other scripture on my heart 2nd Timothy 3 verse 11 and they say seeing that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought we to be and all holy conversation and godliness I mean you can um take your seats this morning praise the Lord what a great atmosphere that we're in this morning amen it's it's nice to be in an atmosphere where you feel the Spirit of God because we're the Spirit of the Lord is there's Liberty we we can be free to actually just let the Lord have control not free to just do whatever we want to do essentially weak we can just let the Lord do what he wants to do because in that atmosphere we understand that our ideas and our thoughts and that uh they finite they fail all the time they fail so many times but his thoughts and his ways never failed so when we can get in an atmosphere where we can just let his thoughts and his ways have control then we are at peace and where there's someone likes to admit it or not we're all sheep we're all sheep and if I could put it in a even stronger context we're all dumb sheep you know what I mean so the more we realize that the more God can move in our life now sometimes likes that type of ourselves is where there's some great I know we made in the image of God but we're a dumb sheep and the more we acknowledge that we need a Shepherd in the more enrich their lives become and the more the more he can have control amen so I've had this thought on my heart that I've wanted to bring and I'm glad the atmosphere is like this this morning because it's this time there are a lot of ideas there's a lot of perception there's a lot of information on what's happening on in the world and some people say it's going good some people say it's going beard some people say this is the way it's gonna go this way that way that way yet God has told us there is a way that it is going that really it's for his bride that knows the way that it's actually going and and I believe I'm speaking to as bride this morning that is on a certain road that leads to the rapture that leads to eternity that's what I believe this morning that's the group that we're speaking to now if we were speaking to a different group we would probably say it this is happening all that's happening but with this group and we're a special group we're not we're the family of God we're not actually part of any other family because when it's all said and done an eternity we're going to be with the family of God it doesn't matter what country you come from what race you are nothing like that it's irrelevant what culture you're from all that it's irrelevant there's there's there's one Lord one baptism one faith is one body of Christ and that's that's who we belong to and you know all the world was like that there wouldn't be any problems here yeah but it's not okay so I wanna talk this morning now some of us not going to be very spiritual but it will be spiritual I want to make us realize that what we're living in and in this atmosphere you can catch it more it's we're not in a picnic when we're not in good times these are not good times at all whatsoever and there is not much of a future for the world as we understand it and we have to as believers settle that in our minds that it's not just going to go on forever it's not just going to happen then we can make our plans and fall and carry them out it's not going to be like that and as we see that they're approaching there's a certain way that I believe that we are commanded that we have to be as we see all these things unfolding we can't really just carry on and no let me just plan my career plan this plan that I know we always have to back that up and say but you've got to do that but you know what and I don't want to get radical here but in the book of Acts they didn't give a they didn't care did they what they had was worth more than this more than that that's what they did I sold everything they just serve God it was under that time we they didn't quite realize the day they were living in we know the day we're living in and it's and and I just want to this sermon this morning is just - it's been good for me to get together to understand we're actually in perilous time so that may seem like it's nice we're in perilous times absolutely perilous and I can't stress that enough that there is hell unfolding on earth and the error the Bride of Christ is beginning to have no seat at any table anywhere no seat at any table there's no spot for you there's no spot for me here it's becoming no spot on this earth for you and for me I don't want to sound negative but that's the facts and eventually there will be absolutely no spot for us any spot there will be as with them that's the truth I'm gonna get into this because I've got so many slides here I've got about 90 some of them are like videos are for two minutes men you're not gonna like some of it because some of it's just my head that I work things out you know some of you will you'll fall asleep in some parts but wake up and then a more interesting part is this what this isn't going bro we're not getting oh yeah thank you okay all right I want to start back here because I want to bring this in and first this is Paul as he's finished ministering in a certain place and he's going to move on and annex 20 verse 28 30 he says take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock see he's talking to all the elders and the the ministers that have been in the certain area that he's been ministering to and setting up the church and Paul has to move on and he's giving them commandment about should act what they should do because he has to leave them for he doesn't know how long any communication in those days was a lot harder than monitors now he couldn't ring all ticks or anything that was once you left it was a long way to get a message back and forth that's why we have the Bible because there were letters that were sent back and forth to the churches but he said take it unto yourselves in to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock and also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them now well Paul was there and speaking they were having great revivals there with healings the Spirit of God was falling the the kingdom of God was you could say on a high you know the the atmosphere amongst their believers would have been so good and things were happening and Paul was going around ministering in places and he was training up ministers at work that were receiving the word and going forth and and these things were happening but Paul said when I have to rideapart it's not going to stay like this Grievous wolves shall in surround not sparing the flock in other words this whole thing is going to get torn apart now if I could just put it in a natural perspective outside of saying the spiritual seed that went into the ground from a natural perspective Paul's gospel actually didn't couldn't withstand the onslaught that came on to it if you think about it just in a natural respect that would seem like it actually had so much onslaught towards that the gospel had so much onslaught that it couldn't survive the onslaught there grievious wolves that came and tore the whole thing apart didn't they now this is the manifested gospel of Jesus Christ were talking about here and it had such an answer it couldn't actually withstand the onslaught and I want to show you some of that onslaught that happened to this this gospel so sorry about some of this being smaller had to do some of them small but the bigger ones that I want you to read you can read but these that will just go to a principle of because I always like to go back this one because it's it's important this is a pivotal difference between the Bride of Christ and the Antichrist as is actually who we worship and we worship Jesus Christ which is which is God manifests in the flesh and then him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily now we know God fills everything about the fullness of God dwells in Christ and a man Christ Jesus and what's in us is Christ because that whole thing is his name as Jesus Christ so that's and yet you have this the the Antichrist spirit is saying that there are actually three different beings and you can pick which one you want to worship on either either day depending on how you feel confusion and and paganism essentially right that's the that's the Antichrist that's an antichrist spirit so if you want to find out what of what nature something is from you just have to look for this what what are they who are they worshipping because there's another scripture which I'll bring up which says that in the end times Satan will actually be in the temple of God being worshipped as He is God and now this is that this whole thing didn't come from God this three gods did not come from God that we understand it came from another God which is Satan okay so I just want to wring these ones here x2 38 you know all these scriptures but I want to read it and then read some other some of the onslaught that came the impede heceta unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost x8 16 says for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Eckstein for Yates's and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord and they then prayed they him to tarry certain days x19 5 says when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus now those are the only four examples we have in the book of Acts of baptism okay so this is how they did it based on revelation of this is who Jesus Christ is we know this but I want to let this sink in because it will be apparent later on and Colossians 3:17 says and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him so if you're gonna do anything doing in his name okay so so that's the gospel that Paul preached was this gospel now this is what they did to Paul in the end Paul was put to death our great champion of the faith came to a miserable pathetic end if you could put it that way he didn't go out like a hero and have this great funeral and they're all celebrating the world came together to celebrate this great man of God he was just put to this somewhere and life went on that's the gospel that's the gospel that's how much the world thinks of the gospel you know there's a scripture that says they wandered about in dens and in caves of the earth destitute of whom the world was not worthy that's how you know he likes to write scriptures we take all the scriptures for us on this side you know I I'm this mighty thing I'm this I'm that that describes us as well that scripture describes us - we will we're destitute in that we're left to just they were this is they were killed by animals there were all these things happen to the believer that that's our part as well of whom the world was not worthy that's that's who we are now this is from the Catholic Encyclopedia the Catholic Answers and I just want to read these things so you can see they began to be an onslaught against Paul's gospel and onslaught though grievious wolves came in and was starting to tear apart the the church and it and it was not directed by the Spirit of God and yet they were all Christian men that were coming in to help and move the kingdom of God forward for a sacrament to be valid three things have to be present the correct form the correct matter and the correct intention with baptism the correct intention is to do what the church does the correct matter is water and the correct form is baptizing and the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit unfortunately all not all religious organizations use this form in fact Jehovah's Witness sometimes use no formula at all and their baptisms and even larger group that Jesus only which is not quite us the Jesus only Pentecostals baptized in the name of Jesus as a result the baptisms of these groups are invalid thus they are not Christian but our pseudo Christian mean our pseudo means like an impersonator so in other words their idea is that essentially Paul as a person ater Christian he's an impersonator of the gospel that's exactly what this is saying this comes from the pit of hell so this is not God and yet they come in the name of the Lord they say we worship Jesus but this is not from God this is totally evil this here is that sorry about the small writing I was going to read these anyway diet G is that what it's the way this word is written it's like an older manuscript that supposedly was what the disciples taught and it was they put the date of this being written about they say it's 65 to 80 AD which actually essentially was when Paul was I think he was still alive but I think it was slightly after that that this was written but it is a they say it may be in like 150 AD but it was from around that period of time and this was information that was being put out and it talks about different ways of the death it says that it as what the disciples taught the Gentile church to do and how they said they should operate it not a lot of it sounds true some of it are just just kind of taken from the Gospels to be put together but they are saying and these they're saying this is how the this is how the disciples said that we should baptize chapter 7 seas by concerning baptism thus baptized ye having first recited all these precepts baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and running water but if they are hair snot running water baptized in some other water and if thou canst not baptize in cold and warm warm water but if there has neither poor water three times in the head and the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit but before the baptism letter mu baptized earth and him who was baptized fast previously and any others who may be able and thou shall command him who was baptized to fast two or three days so this is a material that was going around this is a grievious wolf that was coming at the gospel that's what this was yeah this is from 215 ad this man wrote this when the one being baptized goes down into the water the one baptizing come shall put his hand on him and speak to us do you believe in God the Father Almighty he is being baptized shall say I believe then having his hand opposed upon the head of the one to be baptized he shall baptize and once the initial say do you believe in Christ Jesus and he says I believe he is baptized again and he shall say do you believe in the Holy Spirit and the Holy Church and the resurrection of the flesh and the one being baptized Dean says I believe and so he has baptized the third time and that's from a book called the apostolic tradition and to15 ad okay here's another one from 216 ad it's another book someone wrote after his resurrection he promised in a pledge to its disciples that he will send him the promise of his father and lastly he commands him to be baptized and the father and in the Son and the Holy Ghost not into a nun impersonal God and indeed it's not once only but three times that we were immersed into three persons at each several mention of their names so Paul's departed now here's another one 248 ad the Lord himself told his disciples that they should baptize all peoples in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit for indeed legitimate baptism has had only in the name of the Trinity and that was a commentary on Romans that someone wrote in 248 ad it was circulating this one here is saying that this is what Paul did and this is 250 AD then Probus leaped into the water saying Jesus Christ son of God and everlasting God lead all my sons be taken away by this water and Paul said we baptize thee in the name of the Father and Son and Holy Ghost and after this he made him to receive the Eucharist the Eucharist of Christ so here's a here's a book saying that I was with Paul and this is what happened Paul baptized the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost I think that was a lie I think these people are telling lies we see some of that today there are Liars out there and Satan's got no problem telling lies to deceive people he's got he doesn't mind at all telling lies so be careful what you listen to it's a very very very most lucky chances if it's against his word of God it's a lie it is a lie we're honest so we don't think about people that tell lies the Satan lies all the time he's the father of lies I'll just do one or two more of these but I wanted to do quite a few to show you this wasn't just one person saying this this was over the years an onslaught year after year after year after year by this one that one that one that one that one it was an onslaught against the gospel and essentially until the gospel didn't survive it didn't survive now I know that's in a natural sense that I know that the seed of God was there and it did survive but what if you looked at it it just succumbed to the onslaught of these Grievous wolves okay okay let's read this one and the whole faith this is from 361 ad and the whole faith is summoned up and secured on this that a Trinity should ever be preserved as we read in the gospel go and baptize all nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost an entire and perfect there's the number of the Trinity so they're saying you've got to preserve the Trinity I'll read you one more one or two more this is from 382 ad from a man called Jerome and it was a book dialogue against the Luciferians book against Satan seeing that a man is baptized in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost becomes a temple of the Lord seeing that that when a man gets baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he becomes a temple of the Lord and that while the older boat is destroyed a new shrine is built for the Trinity how can you say that the sins can be remitted of the among the aryans without the coming of the Holy Ghost towers how is a soul purged from its former stains that was not the hole to go sorry that wasn't the one that I was going to this was from 400 AD baptism and the name of the Father and of the son of the Holy Ghost has Christ for us authority not any man whoever he may be and Christ his truth not any men we heard that before we just follow Jesus yeah you understand what I mean that's what they said back then we just follow Jesus it doesn't matter what Paul said we follow the real Authority which is Jesus it does matter what Paul said Oh Lord God we believe you the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit for the truth would not say go baptize all nations name of the Father and of the son of the Holy Spirit unless you were a Trinity last one this is from 444 ad and what need is there of many words when it is possible to refute falsehood and a few we provide that those who year by year come up for Holy Baptism Sheol carefully learn the faith set forth of Nicaea by the holy and blessed father's and initiating them as we have me in burden we baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost pronouncing each name singly so for hundreds of years there was an onslaught against the gospel of Christ the gospel of Paul for hundreds of years now keep their thought in your mind so Paul says after my departing grievious all shall enter and not sparing the flock okay now I'm going to talk a bit about I know people Bosch America a lot this is not about that but I'm going to talk about I have to talk about America because they are in Scripture the same as Rome okay so if you want to kind of look at what's happening you can you can look at Jerusalem or Israel Rome end in America because our own prophecy so you've got to see what's happening there to kind of get a picture of what's going on and this is in Revelations where it talks about the beast and I saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon now we know that that is that's America coming out of the the earth and it was like a lamb and then expect like a dragon now I love America I think it's right country I've been there a few times I really liked it as a country I think it's I think it's been a godly country I think it's been such a great place that meaning the gospel has gone forth from that place there's a reason why people always want to go there not leave their okay because it has been a great place as head it's troubles like every country but I'd probably rather live beer than a lot of other countries you understand what I mean I'm I my wife's American she doesn't like it I like it more than here but I want to show you something okay this this graph here is now the national debt I'm going to talk about this in a little bit but just get that image in your mind of the national debt and this is from nineteen it starts of nineteen forty but before that it doesn't really do a lot of stuff it had a bit of a thing in the depression but it doesn't do much stuff it's another graph of it just look at the way that things are going okay I'm going to talk soon about this this is um debt to GDP who's an accounting standard person here really this is debt to GDP the big spike you saw there was World War two they had to borrow to fund World War two and you see it went down after that because they all the men came home and they worked and they had factories and they worked and they they could move things forward and then it spiked up again we have had no war heavily had any war we had any major thing that would impact why we have to borrow Wallace but why do we have to borrow all this money why is it going up again there's been nothing supposedly happened to make it go up this is actually the UK as well this is from because the UK all these currencies are tied together it's all run by a similar thing right this was actually from the 70s but this graph is similar that most of the countries that deal in these currencies they all have the same graphs essentially right can anyone see that okay I've got to go through this because when you see the magnitude of what's happening now it makes you think about the plans you're going to be making in the future because you can see this this thing is right at our door well it's right at the door we don't have many tomorrow's we don't have many we can sometimes just tick over and we think we've got a job this is happening that setting everything's alright underneath this thing as as as almost something's almost taken over this whole thing that's what's happening I've got a few videos where people are news commentators are saying how great everything is we're an absolute financially speaking and the way the world is we're in an absolute dire straight and nobody has any solutions although we know what the solution will be right but I need to go through this the concept of fractional lending I have to go through it so we can paint a picture of what's going on right this is you know you know why not fractional lending is it's essentially it's the bank's ability to lend you money that they don't have you know one bought a house you've been lent money that to buy that house if you've got a loan that the bank did not have that's the way the system works and you have worked and sweetened and stressed to pay back money to somebody that didn't actually it didn't lend it to you essentially that's why when something falls over they can just write it off it was never there in the first place it's easier in America if you can't pay it they just kind of write it off because that no one had to really work for it they don't like you to do that but they tie you in right but that is the way that the system works I just want to see it show you the ludacris T of this and it hasn't always been like this it hasn't been this system hasn't been in place it's only been in place really since about 1900 but since the seventies that's really taken hold since the seventies but before that it wasn't the way that it is now right so here's this little graph right you can if you put a hundred thousand dollars in the bank the follow my little graph along the bank has got $100,000 cash okay now they can lend out the fractional reserve rate is you've got the whole five percent of the of what you've got and you can lend out all the rests well essentially still having that in your bank so you can lend out ninety five percent it's about the rate it may fluctuate but so they can mean doubt if they've got a hundred thousand dollar deposit they can lend out ninety five thousand dollars of that and essentially still have one hundred ninety five thousand dollars in the bank okay yeah I see it going it gets more and more confusing as you go through right so now they lent out ninety five thousand dollars and the their balance sheet in the event cuz $100,000 cash ninety five thousand dollar loan so they've got they've got assets of 195,000 they're up because they've got a loan plus they got cash in the bank okay but the Alaia bility is a hundred grand because of the one hundred thousand dollar deposit so essentially the equity is ninety five thousand but that one hundred thousand is backed by the central bank the central bank back any deposits because it's actually bare money they're using so they bet their own currency because they've made the deal with the bank so the bank can lend it out if it all doesn't work they give the bank the money and they don't they just put the money they print it they don't dig gold out and give you gold they princess how much do you need it'll be done in an hour or in these days it's more of an injection okay now the actual total at the bank is now five thousand dollars realistically speaking year because they've had a hundred than lent at ninety five they should have five thousand dollars sitting in the bank that's all their bank should have that's all you and I would have if we had 100 we lent at ninety five we'd have five thousand dollars left-- year that's their way the honor system works see and that's a sound system now let's say that the the person that was lent the ninety five thousand dollars he works and he struggles all his life the sweat and stress and he pays back back $95,000 worth interest say ten thousand dollars interests so he pays back one hundred and five thousand dollars to the bank that they didn't lend him okay now once he pays that back the bankers now got two hundred five thousand dollars in cash right now here's where this whole system is so evil right there was only ninety five thousand dollars in circulation let's just put it that way because there are 100 thousand because that was all that he was he was he was neat ninety five thousand dollars but he paid back more money than what was in circulation where did the other money come from where did it come from someone else had to borrow it and put it into the system because it wasn't there it wasn't it was not there but someone had to be linked out and he had to take some of that and use it to pay it back when you understand this concept you understand the only way the system works is if more money is lent out all the time the minute you stop lending out money the system starts to collapse that's why they have what you call a recession or a depression that's all man-made let's just pull back on the money supply put the interest rates up the money comes back in there's less money that's why people start there's less money right you don't have as much money you can't buy as much stuff everything's that's going down it's man-made it's as easy as turning off the tap and not letting as much go out when the banks stop lending the economy goes down because people are still paying back and they select to pull money out and pay back plus the interest they've got to take other people's money the money supply goes down the only way the system works this one is by putting more deep into the system you understand that's the only way that it works it's evil so now they they can now have turn or $5,000 cash they can lend out one hundred and ninety five five hundred ninety nine thousand five hundred now of money that because they can lend out ninety five percent of that so now the real total at the bank at the end of that is negative eighty nine thousand dollars you and I would have would be a negative for insolvent actually on the banks balance sheet they've got the assets of four hundred nine thousand because they've got two thousand dollars cash they've got a one hundred ninety five thousand dollar loan the liability is still only a hundred thousand so they're their actual bank balance the equity is three hundred thousand when you and I would be negative 89 yeah that's on one loan yeah this has been happening for about a hundred years almost and this happens not only on loans but this happens on a currency every dollar that's in circulation is interest charged on it every dollar every digit in your bank account and virtually most countries in the world it is interest has done it because it came invite is interest charge somebody has been making a lot of money for a long time and it's got a lot of money all the money this is staggering now like I said earlier the money is not in the bank like the bank that but the example we gave the money is not actually there there is no money it's just and I hope that no one takes the money yet there is no money there's no money and that's what one of the banks in England during the Oh 8 financial crisis there was a rumor that they they may not have any money and as soon as that rumor got out everyone goes to the bank to take their digits out of the bank where the digits own in the bank yeah so the central bank the United Kingdom central bank had to quickly come in and top up their account with just print more money top it up so guys should get their money yeah that's the way that it works you just help your buddies out but but there is no money in the banks I was reading this was an interesting article I was reading about the fires in California and one of the guys houses that burned down have quite a burn on director all his cash was on a safe in his house I thought that's strange he said now I don't trust the banks I'm not putting my own cash in the back but a safe burnt and all his money was gone but you know some people know that the system's will root and not put any money in the bank right but now like I said the only way that the system survives is by lending because you've got to keep putting money into it in order to keep sucking money out of it there's never enough money in there to pay back so you've got to keep pushing money in but got to go on as debt rights got to go on as loans it doesn't go on as is so now what are the major things that we purchase home we purchase assets for business we purchase motor vehicles and you know we get stuff on credit cards that's about the main the big four right okay with what that all goes on your credit card you know that these are means to get you know money into the system right I want to read you the scripture here before we go through it this is revelation 13:5 says I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that they will cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because they are saying I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor and blind and naked now we've never lived in such a wealthy age as this age there has never ever been so much wealth winners anyone ever had so much stuff even we complain when I was a kid I had one little plastic toy you know and I played with that thing all the time look at these guys they got baskets of these things you know where has the money come from it's been linked lint we've gotten wealthy by lending to us it's all been lent you know it's like if you will lint a whole lot of money yeah you'd go and buy things and they'd say if you were silly like that you go and buy things and live it up you think man I'm doing so good I'm so I've got so much stuff I'm doing so well I'm rich if you if you've borrowed it all you're broke you just think you're having a good time there'll be a day when you got to pay that back you're not rich and that's the way this world has been rigged and Satan's rigged it this way he's leaning it's all been linked and we've gotten wealthier and wealthier and we've gotten used to having stuff and give us more money right so now the reason why I show you this one was because the first thing the system has done as as lean is lean to all of us get him lean them as much money because we are the easy targets lean lean lean lean Linda okay and this really really took hold in the seventies women in the States especially because it's the dollar is the reserve so it's the currency that everything is traded in it's the currency right and in the 70s they went off the gold standard because it used to be backed by gold you know brother branham I don't know where I heard this from somebody in the hood from somebody else that may not be true I don't know but apparently he woke up believable once though they were seeing a train and you see that gold there is hidding there's gold in that train is heading to the Vatican I don't know how true it is but when you look at the system if we talk about the way the Federal Reserve was set up which is a which is which is what's right owned by banks not not any government and they would they they lend money to the government right that's how it happens they they lend money to the they lend money to the United States people to use you so they are using somebody else's currency it's not the America's currency right and well it was being in the early days the interest was paid back in gold can you fathom that they're printing money lending it to you and saying you pay me back in gold how long do you think it took for all the gold to to take all the gold isn't that and isn't that an awesome idea if you're when you think about the scheme I think hacker these mean think up the scheme but it's evil it's a satanic scheme now the Gold's gone it used to be back that's why in the 70s they went off the gold standard because there is no gold anyway the Gold's gone it's been spent okay but in the seventies when they went off the gold standard this this currency method the fiat currency had an opportunity to now do its thing unhindered because it's not now held back by anything else anymore right they could do its thing now the only way this thing survives is by lending so what do you think is going to happen too deep from the seventies right across the board which way is it going to go ah and that's what this graph yeah this is this is actually the house pricing index of the value of houses but when you start lending their houses people start buying you start to create demand supply and demand if people have got money they want to buy there's only two houses on the market five want to buy it but the price goes up because so that look it went along for years and years and years just normal prices yes you know because because the money supply was it couldn't be artificially inflated it was limited it was limited by the amount of winner was gold and silver by the man of gold and you had to actually work to get gold and get her in the system it was a different it couldn't be inflated like exponentially like it could and now because you can there's no limit to what you can print you see that's why these graphs show it like this this is and this is from the this is from the seventies when it was completely gone this is debt so the first thing that they that this scheme was to do you got to lend money to keep it going so the first thing you do is lend to the consumer Lind to the people get every person saddled down with it get him alone for the celina metal in them that linen net make him feel rich he's rich and this is awesome I'm rich I got a house I've got a car I've got all this this is these are this is house mortgage that the reared underneath is a mortgage home mortgages and the one on Stoppers is credit credit cards this is the way that it's gone this is this is what's made us wealthy we've been leap money this is debt all of our assets are from this and you've got to keep pumping and to keep it going this one here is business loans like to buy a big business assets Annette if you notice before the seventies fifties sixties seventies it was just ticking along in the seventies when the standard was gone completely in order to keep the system going you got to keep lending money you got to keep getting people into debt look at skyrocketed skyrocketed what's another thing people buy vehicles by motor vehicles yeah boats all those big-ticket items at the consumer buys same thing it sort of took the long from the seventies that started going up because you've got to keep this thing you got to keep feeding deep into the system to make it work I haven't missed anything here but the financial crisis of 8 was essentially the point where the consumer couldn't take on any more debt he couldn't handle the debt he just you've been settled with so much debt there comes a point where you can't pay any more you just think okay you can't extract enough out in it the whole thing started to go down and the they call up their Great Recession you know it all just started to come apart of the Seas because the consumer couldn't pay anymore couldn't couldn't pay it the death anymore I got this little picture here but it was global because their money system it's all global it was a global ordeal because if you happens in one place it has in the ripple effect and it goes around some countries were worse than others but but the the the and also the banks stopped lending the banks all stop lending and so this is what happens when the bank stopped lending and stopped putting money and this is what happens it is not enough to go around the economy starts going down that's the way that the system works that was at the United States this and here was the UK they've that little downward spike as the recession is there's gonna be turned on and off on and off this is not all wow this is going to happen we didn't see that this is on and off friends this is the way this system works and then of course people then didn't have as much money consumer spending because suddenly there wasn't an application circulation because they're not putting more in right now if you ever heard this term quantitative easing it sounds like a like a nice flash term you know quantitative easing it's like like we're going to help you out we're going to look and quantify something and then just eat it gently give it to you to help everything out this was Plan B only you know this was Plan B when was 2008 ten years ago this wasn't been happening since 2008 the Federal Reserve has been doing what they call quantitative easing you know what that means the government doesn't have enough money to fund the sinning by the people can't take anymore debt but the system needs money who can we give money to which said all the government with debt let's that pumping money and lending to the government by way of buying the government have bonds you know bonds are like I owe you see I'll give you a hundred you give me a hundred dollars log of your hundred dollar IOU and I'll pay back with interest at some point it's that's a bond it's an IOU they started buying I owe use of the government trillions of dollars of I use why cuz the consumer can't take anymore did he settle with it this this is this is since 2008 you can see the spike in here they call that total assets held by the Federal Reserve they've printed this money and bought and it's slowly settling the government with debt since 2008 you can remember that time this is in your last 10 years this has been happening just them alone has been to the tune of four trillion four and a half trillion or about three and a half it's about four and a half trillion now because this is this 115 that's a lot of debt yeah yeah forget about our countries they we will go down together because America is the global currency that it's that it's the reserve currency everything hinges around the dollar it's these people tried to think they could go in to start using Chinese dollars to buy oil and there that soon stopped you know that soon stopped that was put a stop to now the reason why I put this graph is because you can see in 2008 this is why people say well the economy's going great ad that the debt has doubled doubled all the debt that was ever there in the existence of the country in the last 10 years has doubled doubled can you fathom that and this is where we're talking 22 trillion dollars that's 22 million million that's a lot of money this whole system this is happening now this this cannot be paid back this can not be paid back anyone that tells you the economy's going good is lying to you this whole system is their purpose of it was did all the people settle with it first then you then bye-bye out this government now if you're a now look at this one here debt-to-gdp this is the United Kingdom where does it start spiking from 2008 why cuz they started they had to start settling now the government with it now and the 2008 crisis the government's could step in essentially in bailout system they about it out they needed someone to bail them out now when the next one hits who's going to bail out these governments who's gonna they don't have any money left they don't have any money that the debt to GDP was like I said to you earlier was there a big war in 2008 was there a massive croc like terms of they had to buy things they've had to fund everything they've been leaked money and in all the countries look at the spike from 2008 it just goes up like that why because they've been leaked money to keep the system going and it's now being settled upon the government there'll be a time when the government cannot pay its debts anymore and it's coming close to that time when it cannot pay its debts and that's when the big change is going to start happening in the world because we are so used to living in this rich economy it's not going to be the way that it is and we're going to have two choices we're either all live like paupers with nothing because that's what it's going to be like or there's got to be a deal made and an ear is going to be a deal made that's what this is all about as so there could be made a deal you made a deal and we can understand all this as being the beginning of the tribulation you need to understand these numbers these are not just so you can carry on tomorrow in these numbers don't exist these numbers will be worse tomorrow you can't take this back this is happening like in ten years time what are these numbers going to be if the Lord should Terry what are they going to be it's going to be unmanageable it's not going to work there's no more the last people they will bankrupt of the government's there's no one else after that until this thing takes over that's the way that it is or it's in quotes for the image she'll be Great Tribulation such as was not seen since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be this is what right but at the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape ok if you guys watch the news lately in the economic news I kind of do I don't know why but apparently we're doing really good apparently the economy is growing apparently it's the best shape it's ever been we're doing great can you roll that one please and give me some sound really sounding Oh beat on the economy roll tape I'm pleased to say that by these measures the economy looks very good the unemployment rate stands at three point nine percent near a 20-year low inflation is currently running near the FOMC's 2 percent objective this is a remarkably positive outlook indeed I was asked to the press conference last week whether these forecasts are too good to be true which I have to admit was a reasonable question let's get an answer on this one joining us Harvard economics professor Martin Feldstein I that was a remarkably positive outlook from the Fed chair do you share that positive outlook I stop there answer the equals I'll answer the question no no I do not share that positive outlook where did that money come from we as this money come from debt the consumers know better off is we eat the common man has got no less debt the government's got twice as much debt as what it has prepared before the recession these are terrible times the economy is an absolute dire straits about to fall over how can you say this but yet we feel good because now we've got a job I've got a job everything's going good you understand this is what's happening this is another one Bros this the next slide ok I just want to give you one more because this is a general the general feeling the only people that knock it out all cylinders get this US workers now seeing their highest pay increase since 2008 that's the employment Cost Index came out today 2.8 percent for the second quarter this as US consumer confidence continues we're all spending an income big-time solid in June households spend more money on restaurants accommodation really building that strong base building on what's already been an amazing economy and I think we've got some strong head so tell one's going into the rest of the year that's not true that's not true don't be fooled by don't watch this do our research and go well everything's great it's not it's the worst that's ever been now I want to read you some quotes from brother Branham here I want you to show you what's going on now the Bible said in here was the wealth of the world gold and silver this is talking about the Catholic Church and they kept it now if we're on the if we're on the gold standard Emily a broker that back then we were we're not anymore what's going to happen what's going to happen you know the rich people of this nation these big factories and whiskey men and tobacco mean and so forth like that it's not going to stand to change the currency and the Jews because they hold the bonds right you'll see that in a bit so the only thing we'll have to do is borrow it there is only one place we can borrow and when we do we'll sell our birthright out to it that's right then what are you going to do you are owned by that by it that system there's nothing else you can do no people don't think you may think I'm crazy but when my voice is silenced and death these tapes will still be playing and you recognize that what I've said has come to pass I would be the most silly person to take the stand that I have took to even against this thing I would be I would be against God I would be against everything that's God if I was wrong am I thinking am i calling the thing would be against God but I've took my stand because I see it here in the world it's God's Word the ERC being vindicated proven to be the truth and that's the interpretation that God gives us of his word God's own interpretation of his word is how he vindicates it to make it true there was bleeding something else but they thought about this right as brother Peregrine talked about it when I was listening to him the other night talking about this he said how did a fifth grade educated guy understand this how did he know this he wasn't an economist and yet he pointed all this out see this is the way that it's going to go this is how it's gonna work we are living off tax money that will be paid in 40 years from today the nation is broke we're a sedan who's got the money we haven't got it our bonds are no good we'll talk about that soon we've got to have gold who's got at the Catholic Church remember the Gold's gone who's got it the Catholic Church what would they do before these whiskey men and all these great holders and stockholders will ever give it up they won't absolutely sell out he's talking about the only way to fix it is to get rid of the dollar all together and start a new currency that's debt free but he's saying they will not do that because when you do that you essentially lose all your lose everything if they will not do that neither will the Jews that own the bonds because the bonds are hinged to the dollar right and that's why in the book River and Daniel they're the Jews made a covenant with the with the Catholic Church because they knew and this we have the dollar our bonds are not worth it our shears our things we own in the and the monetary system she is and this years and that all that these are hinged to the dollar if the dollar fails we lose all this yeah so you've got to back the dollar buy gold then our things will still stand that's the agreement that's going to be made one's got the bonds one's got the gold they've got to come to an agreement otherwise the gold holder will win the bond holder won't he's got a compromise and say okay I'll go with it but I've got some of that soon the Catholic Church then before these whiskey men and all these great holders and stockholders will ever go out they were absolutely sellout and the church will loan the nation the money and what will it do that will sell us both right straight into Catholicism that's what it's going to do that's that's the goal of the world and then them Jews this covenant he makes with Israel another one the only sensible thing to do change the currency but they won't do it under the present ministration Roman Catholic Church owns the gold of the world and that's what they do is sell out these rich men and so forth of the earth the Bible said what will they do before they lose the bran and Williams the Becker company and most of it the case the Kineo and all these other things what will they do there look see they'll take the money from Rome and then she sold her very birthright Rome backs are up yes sir she'll back it up and they're getting enough policy now getting enough around then bringing in this cabinet look at what mr. Kennedy is asking for this is back in the 60s it's getting to a point where this thing needs a bailout and when it starts to go down and the next one there is no government is going to be able to bail this thing out on the next recession if not the next one the one after that there's no source to barrel this thing out apart from true value yeah and you think even during the Dark Ages a time of penance you know listen this for you get pin it for everything it's been so much wealth accumulated and this way and even since the since the fifties the value of gold has gone from $35 an ounce to in some cases 2000 if you hold gold you've become very very wealthy over the last 60 70 years your holdings have skyrocketed this is a good one here furthermore the elec will not only be kicked by this would I only be kicked but as this move becomes the Emoji Richter to the beasts the Saints will be gone in the rapture and this little design 'full once a movement they started out in fellowship at Ephesus will become a monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world for the church system of the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant and coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap will will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby they would make a living okay now the system is still going to be the currency as we know it but most of it's all digital now you know imagine if you couldn't access your bank accounts one day life almost as you know it would stop imagine if you you couldn't then pay your phone you'd have no phone you couldn't pay your power you couldn't pay your rent life as you know it would stop very quickly if you didn't have access to digits and be able to operate in that trade it would stop very very quickly and I believe brother Graham said that we will actually be here during the start of all that you know and you can see it just happening life is not going to go on as we know it enjoyable and this is happening this is reality this will be a couple of seventy for the harlots daughters are all but gone back into here and the meantime Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds in all the paper their tenders to the dollar at the right time the harlot will destroy the present-day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold with no gold the system fails the Jews will be trapped and coming to an alliance the harlot church will take over the whole world okay now this is quite simple when you understand what's happening you can see how this could happen how did he know all of us and now I wouldn't let you know other people aren't saying this you're not saying this I want to read you this from this is a bit of a longer reading from Revelation but I want to read you this to just see that this is scriptural you know we think of the Catholic Church as a few buildings in there it's more than that and when you they're described in this passage you understand these this is more than just a few old priests with some old ladies having a service there is far more to it than this I'll just read it from this one and after these things I saw another angel this is talking about the Catholic Church come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies the merchants of the earth are waxed rich and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins that he received not of her plagues for his sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double her and double unto her double according to her works and the cup which she hath filled fill to her double how much she has glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow good for her for she saith in her heart I am a queen and no Widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong as the Lord God who judges there and the kings of the earth the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail here and lament to it for they shall see the smoke of her burning am I going along this or is that here Hey okay okay so be well here and limit for here and they shall see the smoker through burning standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city Babylon that mighty City from one hour though judgment has come and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise anymore the merchants of the earth the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls in fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner of vessels of ivory and all manner of vessels of precious wood and of brass and iron and marble and cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men that's what these guys dealing and the merchants of the earth deal with these guys with all the stuff this is not a little Church with the priests and if your old ladies this is the essentially the queen of the world of this natural world that we know doing business with the world and I believe the further up the ladder you get the more you've got to do business with these people that's what the Bible says they are dealing in everything sheep cattle probably Fonterra and somewhere has to be involved somehow you understand the magnitude of this yeah and they've got they have accumulated all the wealth the actual gold the wealth no one's really we've got stuff but in order to have use your stuff you've got to have a currency to use it and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing and saying alas that great city which was closed and fine linen in purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls for was for in one hour so great riches has come to nought and every shipmaster and all the company of ships and sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off and cry when they saw as many as trade by sea they just cried when they saw stood afar off and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto this great city and they cast the stone they hidden cry weeping wailing saying alas alas that great city wearin were made rich all that had ships by in the sea by reason of their coastlines for in one hour she is made desolate but joist over here they are hidden than you holy apostles and prophets for God has avenged you on her all the ships on the sea Greece has a mess of shipping industry that's all involved you can't tell me it's not involved if this is what the Bible says okay now this is why I want to slightly turn this a different way but I want to show you something that's happening that's puzzling for me but I let no man deceive you by any means for this Sheldon for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of self that he is God there's the scripture we read earlier so now it's saying that eventually there is going to be a time where Satan is going to be in the Church of God being worshipped as he is God eventually that's the way that this is going to happen and this is going to be a spiritual thing not a it's not going to be what do you call someone that's like an atheist it's not going to be a non-christian it's going to be a spiritual thing right well this yellow rose false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect but this is what's gonna happen and this this age I think this may be closer to home but you think there's want to go on a different track here for a minute okay because this is an interesting this puzzled me for years but I think it's starting to make sense now right if you have been following if you who's like a conspiracy theorist type person who thinks that way you know you're kind of you liked a Christian things you like I'm not sure I'm thinking something else going on here and it you kind of get drawn to things that you think hmm you'd rather kind of believe that then believe what someone else the major idea of it right I think like that because I kind of think you understand that things are not what they seem right now if you're following this there's been a main drive in this world that's been pointing out the Anakin's conspiratorial kind of way the enemy right pointing out for years this has been going on probably since the seventies but has been pointing out the evil enemy that is arising right and and they are pointing out like you talk about the New World Order and things like that right they've been pointing out this evil enemy that that is the enemy of God essentially because a lot of these people are Christian people right and they have been coming in to try and overthrow essentially everything that's godly right that's really the this really has been the the the thrust of this right and and if you look into all these when you start digging at it you see you can see evil from this perspective you can see this evil coming in now how they've gotten left and right to be left to be kind of even a right to be good i it's beyond me because it's where a righteous King has thinks both ways you know he's not going to he's going to help a person here then he wants people to work here he actually a righteous King thinks reasonably fear judgment right so left and right as nonsense has just been created to make us have to take a side right it's it's nonsense it's not justice but but in a weird sort of a way the idea has been that this whole thrust from the now they call it the leaf but it's it's not don't get me wrong it's not true right but the thrust has been they want to take out God out of everything they want to destroy the monetary system of the world so that these evil people can take over that the evil people that are and the the Freemason Illuminati kind of like their evil satanic people that that want to take over the world and an evil way and we've got to stop them and now they've taken over the news media they've taken over major corporations they've taken over Facebook if they all and all these things and they're coming in like an it's an onslaught and the Christian has got a fight against this thing if you read into it that's the DES the main thrust of this of this whole thing right and that's why I put up these these this article here say about the news the news today is so strange that it's that's out in the open that all these people for that side these ones are for that side that's not news news they're people that come and they tell you I went and talked to so this happened there that happened there that happened there they tell you the news that's supposed to be unbiased right that's what news is supposed to be but as it's come to such a deluded point to where it's depending on what opinion you want you watch this one if you want you if you're of that way of thinking you what's just one of you go that way of thinking they give you a different Pacific idea on the same you vent different slant on it and a lot of the news you read now our opinion pieces this is this person's opinion on that it's not the news on that we're not I don't like any of it because I don't go with any side because like I said earlier our we're are different people don't get sucked into all us think it sucked then we're not of all of us but yet when you look at it right from if you if you have got a bit of Christianity in you and a godly sort of outlook you start to look at this and think we've got problems we've got this evil enemy coming in and they've classed that as the left don't know how and and then when you look at the news organizations in it the majority of them are leaning left and this is in its known right and it seems like the enemy's coming in you know they're taken over everything do you understand what I'm saying right this is sort of this is the they're kind of the Christian way of thinking don't be deceived by it right and even the major the major all the media companies and all that you're all left-leaning and lifters like in New Zealand we've got labour a national we know labour is going what was left and right there sort of thing and in the States obviously as the Democrats and the Republicans Democrats being left and right and so and these people are leaning that way because they're trying to push these values of and they say it's abortion and all these sort of things and you know you're the parents don't have rights over the children the children can be their own it's you're a child of the state not a child of your parents and all these sorts of ideas right so the Christian is now saying we've got a fight against the idea cuz that's my child and I'm according to God I'm the head of that child and all these sorts of things right don't be fooled by that's been made up why no we believe it but don't get caught up in this you'll see why in a minute it's it's it's all of Satan right but just to show you that if you were thinking about it you wouldn't you would start to be worried right like companies like this is um Apple Apple the company we all give money to products okay when they make political donations their percent that they donated three three million the percentage that are donated to the Republican Party the right was 10% and the percentage they donated to the Democrats was 87 percent right so so you could you'd look at this you think well they are of you're an evil company you know they're of that that way if you're a Christian you go to and there are quite an influential company right and they hold a lot of information Facebook Facebook was even worse they gave a couple of million it'll be more than that 7% went to the Christian right which is nonsense and 91% went to their evil left okay that's a that's a biased way now that now they're gin you want people in there that actually push that way it's that's happening like that right it's happening that way like their posts they're getting since it's even there's a big there's a war happening now about this there's a war it's fighting don't get involved in it it's nonsense it's absolute nonsense and if you if you don't portray the correct I'll leave it Microsoft the same 18% to the Republicans 80% to the Democrats right so now if you're a conspiracy theorist you're looking at this and you're looking at all that control these guys have gotten yours and all these major corporations in the end you're starting to think it's this evil left ungodly evil people that are coming in to take over that's what you're thinking right and you and you're going to associate them with the monetary system this and you would order that cease evil people that are coming in to squash that Christianity I've never quite understood that because when I read my Bible it says I think seems like I mean and even from my perception of watching this over the years I'm thinking Christianity as we know it as is being beaten and yet how can it say it it's going to be this brother Brown talks about the image being there you know everyone has to take the mark and and or would they know they they will make a the church will rule and you think it doesn't look like the church is gonna be ruling anytime soon it looks like it's being defeated and liberal is what you'd call him all their articles were about you know the downfall of Christianity it's all over it's doomed you know we're winning yippee that's what's been happening right now people like this there's there's many many conspiracy like ways right and they're mainly Christian people they have been supposedly picking up what's happening in been blasting it to fight this evil thing we've gotta fight against it you know that's what that's the idea right I understand once again don't get caught no that's not happening that way not happening that way now that's why these people they thought about see Obama was supposedly left you know and and he he was this evil one that was bringing all the stuff and you know you could no longer say Merry Christmas and Walmart you had to say Happy Holidays he's getting Christ out of everything you notice he was to see they they were part of this evil group that wanted to do away with Christianity that's what was happening right that's the perception and that's what the fight was against it wasn't about who he was or anything it was against this idea right this and his fights been brewing under the surface against this idea and people are researching and thinking I can see what's happening the media's going that way the food corporations going that way the government's going that way it's all coming against our Christian values in our Christianity and they want to take over our children to make nanny States and all that sort of thing that's that's the there's a fight against there right and so when the people saw that someone like Hillary which they they think or she impersonates everything that that is she's probably a very nice person by the way I'm not going to say anything bad about people that I don't know do you know what I mean you know people just bash them best and best and she's probably quite nice you going with a bub ever dry with her she'd be quite nice she tell you some nice stories you know and I wouldn't say no I'd enjoy it you know they're still people the same as us right but now if you see that happening and you see she almost embodies everything that it was this evil darkness coming in and and if you're a Christian your prank you understand you're praying god no god no if she gets in that's gonna just take everything over they've got the media they've got the corporation's they've got all the businesses they're going to take over everything that's what's gonna happen God deliver us do you understand I should have had the photo of Trump here inter there's an N called Trump okay that was going to fight against this the whole thing I'm gonna stand up for Christian values I'm gonna be a champion of Christianity you're gonna say Merry Christmas instead of Happy Holidays I'm coming in the name of the Lord right that's what this that's what the whole election was about this man's not a Christian whatsoever whatsoever but he came out saying I'm going to fight in the name of the Lord that's what this election was about that's what it was about and that that and that's why he got all these votes because it was people that understood this supposedly understood what was happening and they said here's a man that we can back that's going to fight it because he even we're not Alex Jones Show and said I'm going to order at the Federal Reserve because they all know that this Federal Reserve is a no one knows where the money is no audit of it ever what's going on he's saying I'm gonna audit them saying all the right things yeah audit them fear the bad guys I'll do that do you understand this is what happened and all the Christians got on board they backed the heathen but then like they argue what are our options right and for all money for all money he had he had no chance of winning you know in the primary is this saying he says he walks down his elevator no he doesn't walk sorry see he stands and he goes down and he says I'm gonna run for president the next day it was the laughingstock of the world what a joke no Trump man the man that says you're fired he was a joke and he started winning winning winning winning everyone saying well he's winning he start saying all the right things now building a wall is not about I don't want people coming in that's about I don't want other cultures and religions coming in here diluting our religion and taking over because he looked at Europe he says look in Europe they're leading and I'm not political don't get me wrong I'm not saying this to back any point of view because the whole thing but he's saying look in Europe they've it and he knows and all the people that conspiracy theorists know they're doing this they're letting in all these people from these other countries they don't mind the people they don't want the religion there and they're saying in these countries now these Muslim religions all these other religions are coming in and taking over our religion that's what they don't want and he knew that he's saying I'm gonna stop that cuz I don't want all that I don't want to be flooded by non-christian immigrants then I'm going to change the culture of our country and if you're a Christian you're gonna say yeah you understand what I mean that's what you're going to say yes keep them out you're not saying don't let them come in they're saying we don't want we want Christianity preserved that's what this is about that was the whole thing don't back any of it we're not part of the Saints like I said it's that you have no seat at this table now this is this is the LA Times they had Clinton this these are their you know how many seats are going to get who's going to win the election this was up to the day before Clinton is going to get 352 and 286 these are I'm what do they call this in the there's the called certain seats but it's not like in the house it's like I can't remember the name Shannon actually wouldn't know she doesn't really follow politics even though she's an American right so here's this poll LA Times 33 and 52 to 186 another poll Clinton is going to win 323 to 197 you know these are polls a day before 302 to 235 to 74 to 190 every poll had Hillary winning Trump losing another one I think there was 228 to 164 322 to two one six okay so if you're a Christian if you're if you're if you were trying to go for this you're thinking we're going to lose you know this evil thing is going to come in and take over now this is the end of it because once they give another four years and the momentum that it's going because there have been eight years remember eight years of this momentum it's all over then what happened by some miracle you understand by miracle our champion won praise God I'm not making fun of it but I'm telling you that's what happened praise God revival broke out wow we won not we but God one to fight away this evil that's what happened and then essentially an inept way it was almost a miracle because all the lifts were like leaning that way and all the news media was saying and yet somehow or another some knight in shining armor came slashing through everything and fought and fought and fought and fought that's what happened that's why now you see videos of Trump and they the Oh heaven the super imposes hit on IRISA and haven't gone out to the WWF stage and then taking the news media like CNN and smashing them into the ground you know because he's he's this big hero that's gonna come out wipe out all the enemies you understand that's what's been happening hey that's the it was the feel amongst that the conspiracy even them guys like um Alex Jones you know he couldn't believe once they won he couldn't believe Wow and then and even guys that weren't that were very big conspiracy theorists guys were in the White House like these were guys that only had I forget the guys name he was they got him at after war because I think they couldn't take the heat from him but they were they basically very hardcore conspiracy type guys running a country now people think I can't believe this our guys are in there running the show now they're gonna get rid of all these bad guys you know you couldn't it was unbelievable that guy from Bray Bart news you know the he yes they've been a year like he he was supposedly your authority on seeing this and he was ended up in the White House and you going Wow out guys with you know the Christian people thinking wow he's gonna get rid of the Illuminati you know and then the next thing the next thing that they that he got was he gotta for his vice president was a devout Christian man Mike Pence once again probably a very very nice guy right I want to read you some of the quotes that said what the American people need is not more health care what we need is more Jesus care I believe that if we can just get more of these people with pre-existing health conditions back into churches you would see a lot of healings and many of these problems would just go away people who lead godly lives don't worry about doctors we have the Lord to take care of us he's your man yeah he's your man this is this one here is from September this year two months ago Mike Pence any time I am criticized for my belief in Jesus Christ I just breathed the prayer phrase do you do the same yes in an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network CBN Penn said the Bible says count it all joy when you endure trials of many kinds any time I'm criticized for my belief in Jesus Christ I just breathed the prayer praise this is the second most powerful man in the United States saying I'm a servant of Jesus Christ if you're a Christian you're having a revival right about now this is unbelievable you understand this is unbelievable can you play that this is that this is the primaries this is just a couple of I think this is Terry Evangelic values of love charity and faith built this nation so how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly one of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you to a large extent and Hillary Clinton you can forget about her so let me say this right up front a trump administration our Christian heritage will be cherished protected defended like you've never seen before [Applause] believe me [Applause] I believe it and you believe it and you know it you know it and that includes religious liberty remember remember now these things were said all through the primaries I come in the name of the Lord and if you look at it from that perspective you could say God one play that one I don't know what this one is both counts well next guests thought he would never vote for Donald Trump would like millions of others he did take a look the United States so help me God so help me God Donald Trump stunned the nation by becoming the 45th President of the United States his victory over Hillary Clinton sent shockwaves around the world but many who voted for Trump never thought they would Steve Strang is the CEO of charisma media like many people of faith Steve supported Trump only because Ted Cruz dropped out of the race after he personally interviewed Trump last fall Steve became part of a team of Christian leaders who backed the future president in his book God and Donald Trump Steve shares the reasons why he got behind this unlikely candidate and explores the possibility of a divine intervention involved in his election divine intervention in his election this is the idea right because this is a Christian this is God winning this is what's happening this is our Mike Pence the vice president play this one mr. vice president thanks for doing this for being here with us we appreciate it you bet David good good to have you here on the National Day of Prayer yeah what a wonderful day let me ask you about the National Day of Prayer and this White House initiative is faith initiative explain it a little bit to me exactly and also it took a year I mean it didn't come out a year ago what why why the delay on that well I think what the American people have learned in the last 15 months the people of faith all across this nation have a champion in President Donald Trump a year ago he said we were a nation of faith and he took action last year to make sure that the federal government never imposed on the religious liberty of Americans like in cases like the Little Sisters of the Poor but this year the President signed an executive order in the Rose Garden David that establishes a policy initiative within the White House that puts faith really at the center of policy development a champion of the faith it's the way it's being looked at okay so this here this here is when a lot of pastors went to the White House and then worship broke out at the White House by this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise God you know did you ever think that was possible if you're a Christian in America was that possible the enemy was coming in now they're praising God and the White House is revival Christianity is winning again that's the idea that's the that's the thrust but this is going the way it has to be like that's an order for this whole thing to come in right couldn't be the other way here here's another one they're sitting ready having a cabinet meeting and he's always prayer this is he's not gonna ask I'm ben Carson to pray which was one of the nominees that he was a surgeon um listens it was words he says at the end of his prayer so without a good ask Ben Carson you can stay if you want it because you need the prayer more than I do I think the only may be a good solid prayer and they'll be honest then is that possible something will ask you to say grace we thank you for the President and four cabinet members who are courageous who are willing to face the winds of controversy in order to provide a better future for those who come behind us we're thankful for the unity in Congress that presented an opportunity for our economy to expand so that we can fight the corrosive debt that have been destroying our future and we hope that that unity will spread even beyond party lines so that people recognize that we have a nation that is worth saving that nation's divided against themselves and not stand in this time of discord distrust and dishonesty we ask that you would give us a spirit of gratitude compassion and common sense and give us the wisdom to be able to guide this great nation in the future we ask in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit Mike I don't know Ben but I want to say that last but came from a grievious wolf this is not God this is not God this stuff is not God we've got no seat at this table no seat this here was the nutless here circulated when all the pastor's prayed for Donald Trump who laid hands on a parade from he said year pray for me this was the this is one of the men he's actually South African a missionary in America this is one of the men that I think he prayed at a different time but just roll this one I've got a few more of these that just using Lincoln has to pull away and now Steve said before we go we're gonna pray and he welcomed that I mean just welcomed that we pray in that scripture the Bible says in 1 Timothy chapter 2 and verse 1 I urge you then first of all that petitions prayers intercession the Thanksgiving be made for all people for kings and all those in authority that we may live peaceably in quiet lines and all godliness and holiness now there's a lot of people freaking out because my god they prayed in in the Oval Office separation should instead that's bogus there's no such thing as separation of church and state if there is such a thing it's means the government should not stick his nose into the church so people miss they misquote things and go you know crazy but the fact of the many the founding fathers and all about first initial presence everything was open in prayer the first mega church was in the Capitol building George Washington started that the Marine Band did the praise and worship so have we moved so far away from the founding of America that we don't even understand how our nation was founded and how that then our initial these people were people that looked to God divine providence and our current present president number 45 he understands that he realizes that he can cannot go further in what he's doing without divine intervention in his life so this is so imperative so when we were in the Oval Office we were surrounded by people of different you know Baptist they were there were there different people Pentecostal and you know majority evangelical leaders we all see things maybe a little differently but we come together with one purpose one cause to come pray for our prison we have set aside our differences in extra fact even when we met privately the leaders of some of the largest churches in Van Jellicle in America said we must pray for one another in stand with one another that is HUGE so I see the body of Christ coming together because American needs another great spiritual awakening we had one in the 1700s we had one in the 1800s we have to have one now without divine intervention it's over God has given us with President Trump a last-minute reprieve but we have a window to see this thing turned around because the enemy is so upset and what is taking place so you know understand that you see the thrust of the way this thing's going it's not God when he goes away his wife preaches I just wanted to say that and I did actually I got his statement of faith and it's the same as all the rest of him and we're baptizing the Father Son Holy Ghost it's the same grievious wolf these are Grievous wolves I'm not saying the manors but this is from Satan this whole thing is from Satan the whole thing but you know it looks so good because often wondered how's the cell like and it happened you're never gonna get that across the line with Christians they're too wise they they can see we're not gonna let this evil you know you you never would have got it across alarm with the Christians in America because really when you think about it they were the last bastion of freedom that is fighting against this whole thing the rest of us are too small to be in of any significance but it was the Christian American people that were was standing this whole thing this to me looks like it's being twisted around so they're going to be supporting it supporting the whole thing in for it we get a chance to defeat the enemy evil enemy and these are gonna be a great revival being deceived and about to sell out I've got a few more I just wanna I wanted to play a few of these just to let it sink in so this is happening like now it's probably pretty was prayed yesterday there's a there's a movement happening it doesn't include us it doesn't include the bride at all there's no place and I want to show you a few bizarre things after this this is another this he talked about Paul or white this is Donald Trump's pastor became who he apparently he called her up ten years ago I said I watch you on TV and you know can you come visit me in Trump Towers and you know they talked in there so this is his pastor is Paul or white lady I think that's significant I only know you for sixteen years but to serve with your faith leaders and to say that you always have put God first and you could challenge us and continue to challenge us as you lead us we thank you for your personal works and this I believe is a new beginning for us as we look forward we are going to see great things come thank you for you thank you for thank you pastor Jeffers yes prayer let's pray together may we yes father your word says if your people who are called by your name will humble themselves and pray and seek your face you will forgive their sins and heal their land father I thank you that we have a president president Donald Trumpkin who believes in the power of prayer we thank you for a vice president like vice president pence who works alongside of him and we thank you that the president had the wisdom to call our nation right now for a day of prayer this coming weekend father this is what we need we pray for healing for our country we pray for physical healing for those who have suffered the devastation from Hurricane Harvey father be with them provide for their needs help us to be the embodiment of Jesus Christ as we ministered to them but father we also want to pray for spiritual healing emotional healing for our country this country has been bitterly divided for decades upon decades and now you have given us a gift president Donald Trump who wants to bring healing to this country and he is bringing healing to this country and I pray that you would give him and vice president Pence the wisdom they need to truly make our country the country you want us to be we want America to be great again and we can know that American only be great if as America is good and we know we have a president who wants to make America good I pray your blessing upon him the first lady their family give them wisdom as they seek to honor you and we pray this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who came and died and rose again that we might have eternal life it's in his name that we pray amen saying a few more things right you understand this this is these are perilous times I don't think I play the sisters has passed they're preaching a woman a good-looking woman too there seems to be just attracted that way good-looking younger woman I won't play it I just wanted to show you the she's very um you seen on you see these denominational Borman preaching of the dress is usually a bit more nicer but this one's very seductive seductively dress like very tight and unusual for her even for a denominational preacher woman she's in very high heels and like that way I don't know if there's anything in it but I'm just pointing it out to you this is not God whatsoever and it's it's a it's it's a massive movement going a certain way as a perilous time I want to play this because now it's getting crazy I want to show you there you we're not part of this any of this right there's now protests on the streets left and right you know and it's the Christian Christians fighting gates the evil people this is one of their rallies that these people have play this one over the conservative group patriot prayer held its third rally injustice and lessons everybody came here for a higher cause it's not ourselves God's we're asking you to guide us to take the smarts take it to the right spot and make sure we show this country what it is to be a real American in the name of Jesus Christ amen Julie Gibson is the founder of peach so they pray before they going to have a big fight because it's justified because we're fighting against this lift communist way that's trying to pull down our country and this darkness come home we're gonna fight against it and they're the enemy over there these guys in this case they were anti far with just anti-fascism near the enemy there I've got no sound on this because there was a bit of thing but this is now you know play this one just elite just to see that says these are the bad guys you know it's all bad the guys on the the right the black of II like the the lift wing guys and the guys on the right of the Christians there's even Christian signage there you see some of them somewhere I stopped it before the big fight broke out but it they they leaned had a big punch up and I think that day the Christians won they drove back the enemy look at this one the this man is kicking a man on the ground that guy in the blue has just punched a woman over and the guy in the yellow top they're kicking a man on the ground a Christian man Jesus will judge you kicking him on the ground see this this is now that's not all right that's but and with on all these things you get it you get it right out this way this is I'm not going to any of these rallies either side because I'm not part of this you understand the bride isn't you don't have a seat and anywhere in this we don't have a seat if you can't read that I just down the bottom here just to read these these that you got a Facebook you read all the comments about you know when there's anything of this nature you know and the there's things like Lucifer lost this election in this country and now he doesn't hide anymore he's attacking us from all angles now you know cuz they're saying Lucifer's lost he's angry that's where all these Anti Fog ways are coming out and doing with us sort of stuff and everything cuz Lucifer lost Satan lost God won we've got to push the kingdom of God forward they're all part of the World Council of Churches all of these people and and this is their baptism as father son Holy Ghost see grievious wolves taking over take heed I just want to read this this I've got two more quotes and I'm done now the this quote is about the food pool and about the manifestation of the spoken word because the way that you look at this all happening it's becoming apparent if you're a believer you've got no you've got no place in this world and it's begin to become physically you don't have a place in this world it's happening real real quick this is my last quote well then it's right at the door it's taking over and you're not included in the at the table you and I are not included anywhere and that's what the squeeze is gonna be we're gonna be squeak we won't be able to do this you might be able to have this what are you gonna do what are we gonna do we won't have that and it's not something that's far off you look at these numbers you look at the Westone it's not far off that's why I say take heed it's actually this is this is reality as we not today we've got a our future is going to be somewhat different the monitors now it is the way that it's going to go it's just moving in that direction for other MCS now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along I'm gonna read it from here and then it's the thing that we've looked forward to for so long for at least maybe many as four or five years and maybe longer the third pull it's now being vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember you'll never be in a personation of there because it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existent and I have I'm one of the SATs own right at this time now it just happened so it could identify his presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and when it does when this does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost imperson anything that can be done but when the time comes when the squeeze comes then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested and the fullness of its power now a musket I want to read but all this quote now I must continue in evangelism just as I was commissioned first I must continue on therefore you've had the word and you know what to look for how to stand I must continue on and evangelism and friends of mine keep still and just keep moving on for the Arabs approaching swiftly see that we something is going to be done now you might see some little odd things happen for me nothing simple I don't mean but I mean something odd to what the regular trend because where I reached to now and the ministry I'm dropping back here watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it but it's going to be used everyone knows for a certain as the first was identified so as the second being identified and if you think real hard real close to you who are spiritual as the Bible said he he is to hear as to him that has wisdom the third is properly identify see we know where it is so the third pull is here it's so sacred I that I mustn't say much about it and he told me in the beginning let's say nothing of it you remember those years ago congregation says they mean it speaks for itself see but I've tried to explain the others I made a mistake this will this will be the thing that to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapture in faith for the going away see and I must lay quiet for just a little while now remember and it was this thing on this tape you might see a change in my ministry right away dropping back not going up dropping back we're right at the age now and it can't be can't go on any further we have to do wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes but it's already identified the years coming at Tom upon in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before it which was pagan Rome before it became when it became papal Rome see that this nation will do that revelation 13 plainly explains that the lamb came up out of the year this other beast came up out of the water thickness in multitudes of people the slam come up we there were no people the lamb represents a religion the Lamb of God and remember it spoke like a lamb but was a lamb and then after a while it received power and spoke like a dragon and exercised all the power the dragon the power of the Dragon had before him and the dragon is Rome always see don't you see it Roman denomination to mark a Protestant denomination and image to the Beast making a power that will force all Protestants like a union have to be into this Council of Churches where you won't be able to have any fellowship or well it's practically that way now you can't go to church and preach and this you have a fellowship card or some identification and now on persons like ourselves we're going to be out cut out of all that altogether that's exactly because they won't be able to do it it's tightening and when the time comes and the priest comes to a place to where you're pressed out then watch what I'm flexing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then see and it'll be absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the rydym for the church he saw all this he saw all this when we don't have a seat at any table there's gonna be a seat at the Lord's table for us and you know it's going to be worth it if you can catch what I mean a bridge won't matter then we're under an answer also this message is now under an onslaught as well and onslaught best thing about a bridge let me tell you something when the manifestation of the spoken word comes out when you need food and you can speak for me you can speak your lights on bridge is not really gonna matter dance then it's not gonna matter and this is all happening now you know I've got one more scripture I want to bring after this but these and one way I'm happy because you know that's happening the way that the Bible said it would in its exciting times but it has still perilous times the last scripture I want to give you as this because when you think about it when when the squeeze really comes on what are you gonna have and what am I gonna head hey we're going to have the Lord what else are we gonna have each other they're gonna be your only friends we're going to be what sister henna is gonna mean so much more to me the more the squeeze comes on cuz its Christ in here it's gonna mean so much more to me I say that like not that she doesn't now but that's just reality of how we work you're gonna mean a lot more to me when the squeeze is on when we don't have anything else when we've got each other inflate and the Spirit of God coming into meetings and faith rising it's gonna meet amazing time but it's only for the bride it's only for the bride everyone else is going into it the Christians are going to go into this heat long walk into it but the bride not going to walk into it we're walking out of here out of it and that's why Peter says Paul says not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so the more as you see the Day approaching I don't know about you but that's all I can see that they are approaching I can't see anything else in the news so that's that's front-page news people according to according to the prophet of God and according to his word I mean let some stand and sing turn it off let's down a thing this morning let's sing that song um we don't sing it often but that one the day of redemption is near I like that song I was just sing this and ask why they Andy to come up as I as we sing nations are breaking Israel's awakening the signs that the prophets portal Gentile days numbered with arrows and come birth return all disbursed to your own that day every day ah [Music] your redemption is promised [Music] that Jesus the Christ is our God this generation spreads God's revelation from a walk where the Apostles head from they breathe [Music] men's hearts are failing be fear your life strength back [Music] your redemption is near the diver addiction but they are predation baby [Music] be held when despair [Music] redemption is me one more time to divert addiction the day of redemption and smart [Music] be fair with the spirit come again sir I'm ball [Music] there is nothing [Music] my [Music] I'm going home [Music] ah [Music] they [Music] [Music] my god you see [Music] accepted [Music] that was by [Music] one more time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I mean this is closing prayer today Lord Jesus we thinking Lord that we have received your word in this age Lord that you had a divine purpose for it Lord to draw us to yourself Lord Jesus that the bride may meet the bridegroom you fear us for your coming Lord and on top of that Lord like a mighty Eagles gone up and can see all these things Lord and there's something in our heart that gets excited Lord as we see the Day approaching Lord a man or a woman that doesn't have this will start begin to be fearful and confused father but we can look up Lord our Redemption draws nigh thank you Lord Jesus that we haven't followed cunningly devised fables with God but we're following the pillar of fire we're following Jesus Christ Lord we're going to follow you all the way home Lord Jesus this each one here Lord bless him and they walk with you may they be victorious and they walk with you this week may bless their prayer life blessed time when they read your word may you reveal yourself to each one here greater and greater each day Lord bless each one bless your families in the unbelieving family members bless them and bring them in Lord and just be gracious to us they will keep us humble Lord we know that we're dumb sheep and you're the great ship Lord we don't want to go out look we just want to stick with you follow you Lord not think that we know anything we just follow you day by day Lord just walk sweetly and humbly with you Lord not be flustered by any of these things that are all around us where every wind of doctrine all these this turmoil or but we'll just walk in peace with you Lord Jesus and the secret place so lord I just want a committee to run to your hands and just when I said to you this morning in Jesus name Amen I mean publish or you're dismissed in Jesus name [Music] [Music]
