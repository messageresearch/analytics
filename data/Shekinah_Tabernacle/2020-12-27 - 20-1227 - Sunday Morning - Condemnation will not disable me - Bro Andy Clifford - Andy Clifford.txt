jesus we believe lord that these words that we just sung lord you are the father of creation lord the risen lamb of god you rose lord triumphant over death hell in the grave you've got the keys to death and hell and the grave and we saw that because you open the graves and many of the saints of old arose out as a first fruit of the old testament lord to show that they were buried by faith in the promised land and lord they rose because they believed and lord they pleased you with the faith that they had they believed the true report lord and they obtained a a good witness and favor with god because it's father it's possible to please you lord it's possible and that is by believing by faith and today we believe and we believe your promises today lord that we can walk with you with love and liberty lord as we've just sung oh lord we can walk with you lord oh god and we want to walk with you today we don't want to be crippled down we're going to be disabled by some lord negativity or some blockage in the human spirit because we have a provision today lord you are that provision you made a way lord that we could stay in liberty that we could stay free we don't have to be bound and if we are we don't have to stay bound we can walk free in any circumstance anywhere any place any time because of the risen lamb because there is a lamb on the throne amen that atones for our sin that is a blood that is bleed lord for our sins that we may walk in righteousness that we may operate in a fallen condition we may operate lord because we've been quickened oh lord and i pray father that today you would just speak to us lord jesus that you would administer lord that which is a burden of the holy ghost and lord i pray you take control of speaker and hearer get man out of the way lord if there's any distractions or maybe that someone's got something on their mind that is distracting them lord i pray you would grant them amnesty this morning i pray that lord these young children lord that may not want to be here lord maybe the church is just too long for them father or they just want to get out and go kick the ball and play but father i pray that today you would grant them special grace special grace lord that they could just be lord that that desire to leave the service the desire to get out and have fun we'll just be lord neutralized by your love today i pray that your love will just go down to every pew from the youngest to the oldest lord to lord neutralize their old nature because that old nature's longing for for love it's longing for acceptance it's longing for fun it's longing for entertainment it's long has got needs and lord i pray you'd meet that need with the very thing that we need and that is your love that is your presence lord i pray that you would look beyond our faults look beyond lord jesus all of the humanity this morning lord and go down and meet every need and may we hear from heaven today from the youngest to the oldest may the babies hear from heaven lord let the children let the teenagers let lord the elders lord jesus let each one of us lord and our own needs in our own way may we hear from you today lord step out of glory and into this place hallelujah and minister to our hearts lord the thing that we have need of lord that we can walk free that we could walk under a supernatural experience and have no blockages anymore well we're done with blockages we're done with hindrances we're done with limitations we're done with the devil's devices and we're not ignorant of them oh lord great things have been sown into our lives great seed and great revelation and great word and great substance lord all of the parched corn of the land and all of the great milk and honey and all of the seed that has been lord stored up for us and lord here it is and i pray lord that today you would just send quickening power to raise it into a life of fruitfulness lord i just pray lord let the seed sprout today may lord you caused the hinds to carve today hallelujah lord jesus we just want to remember brother ben as he ministers right now simultaneous to this very experience we're having here in your presence lord lord he's preaching up there and lord there's needs up there too and i pray lord that brother ben would just be so inspired today and you would just be with him lord and anoint him and you'd bless the people richly father lord let ben just lord be in such a a channel of inspiration lord that the needs of the people would be met and he would just preach down into every life and lord you would just unfold your love and lord cause a great revival to go forth in auckland i commit that service to you lord and also now i just want to commit this service into your hands where in your hands i commit the delivery into your hands i commit lord the reception into your hands may you have prayer minutes lord hallelujah when we will be careful to give you all the honor the glory and the praise and lord i ask father impact our lives now on a very personal level to enable us to walk with you in jesus christ's name amen hallelujah god bless you saints welcome to the house of the lord it's wonderful to be here who's glad to be here today amen thank you musicians it's been a lovely to you know i was just sitting in there and i was just just being blessed as soon as the piano started the presence of the lord just started wafting into the into the office and you could just feel the change because the musicians are anointed and you're anointed and each one of you has giftings each one of you has a purpose we all have a purpose we all have a place and when we're in the right atmosphere it's like a flow of river you don't have to make it flow it flows from god amen hallelujah today by the lord's grace we've been led to a thought here and i want to speak on condemnation will not disable me just think about that condemnation will not disable me and you need to believe that you need to have that in your own heart condemnation will not disable me amen guilt will not disable me shame will not disable me my mistakes my shortcomings will not disable me because my god is greater than my problems your god is greater than your problems and he sees a bigger picture than what your heart sees what your mind sees what the devil tells you amen so we're going to speak on that today and i really believe that the lord has given us a blessing amen hallelujah because it's him amen amen turn to revelation chapter one with me please and then we'll go to romans 8 1. oh my i feel his presence my goodness wow i might as well get the water ready in the towel hallelujah it is summer right does anyone believe that hallelujah my goodness my snowing in summer okay well that brings the gets the conspiracy theorists going doesn't it what are they doing to our weather oh my we won't go down that route though will we amen revelation chapter 1 verse 5 and it says here and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood hallelujah amen and romans 8 1 it says there say amen when you're there amen there is there for now and i've underlined now and if there was a powerpoint it would be bold and underlined there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated hallelujah condemnation will not disable me and you see this is a big problem that we face anyone that's got an element of sincerity in their life will struggle in some way shape or form with condemnation or maybe disablement because of something else that's related to condemnation or related to your own humanity you see it's our humanity that gets us down there's gifts in our lives there's offices there's callings major callings minor calling doesn't matter they're all callings and they all play a part in god's great scheme his great plan of redemption and see these gifts and this is where we run into the challenge right and the challenges that that gift is placed in here right and what surrounds that this and this is the problem the challenge but remember god is greater than our problems god sees a bigger picture god's not small fry you know he doesn't get he's not going to get into all entangled up and petty about a little issue in your life now before i go too much further i don't want to come across in this service because it may do but we'll try and by the lord's help stay balanced but we don't want to condone sin right grace is not a bandage for our sinfulness grace is the power to overcome that grace will look beyond the grace will go you know what i know you're in a very bad condition right now i know that you're doing all of these things but i don't want you to stay condemned i don't want you to be beaten down by a proud boastful devil huh i want you to be walking with me through it all and so do you see the lord he overlooks these well he doesn't overlook it he deals with it but he has to overlook things to deal with it and he has a program he has a schedule amen and our schedule is this one then this one then this one then this one just deal with it all lord actually i want to go to camp and i want all my problems gone i want to leave camp perfect but the law says hold on a minute no i'm going to deal with that there and i'm going to time that one and then that one and i'm going to leave that there because that's going to play a purpose seven years down the track you're going to fail there and it's going to cause a revival over there or whatever we don't understand why but he does you see we're just in the infantry amen you know we're just fighting in the on the front line hallelujah and sometimes we're fighting in the in the down at the back you know sometimes we get beaten down you know the devil comes down he just says no but you can't operate under god's supernatural because you did this you're doing this you struggle with this you're having problems with that god can't use you but i'm going to share with you yes he can god can use you he'll use you right as you are but what he's looking for is the right mental attitude he's looking for the right motive there's certain prerequisite requirements and one of them but not one of those requirements is a perfect life perfect behavior okay does everyone is everyone following amen amen i pray that the lord will liberate and enable because grace is an enabling power that is it's not subject to our behavior it's not based on our merit it's unmerited favor it's unmerited help to to enable us to operate in a supernatural experience so that we can change people's lives by the god that's inside us despite ourselves despite our humanity because we're worthless humanity all the way through and little by little we'll get deliverance of different things and we'll get mastery over the elements right adam when he was in his unfallen condition he had mastery over the elements of the earth the reason he had mastery over the elements of the earth is because he had mastery over the elements of his own earth because he wasn't fallen and therefore god couldn't trust him with that godness that power to have mastery over the elements and he could just speak and these things would happen because he could be trusted with it but the moment that he fell and became subject to the elements of his earth in a fallen condition god couldn't trust him with that power anymore amen let's go to 1 john 3 verses 19 to 24. and i ask you this question do you want god's supernatural power to flow through your uncondemned life i put that there i wrote that down do you want god's supernatural presence his unction do you want that does everyone want that do you desire that hey man well as you see even that desire makes you a candidate for it i just it's actually the more i when i see that of this thought's been with me for for quite a few years and but it just became you know things get illuminated at different seasons and and then i realized how much this theme was in the message and through the scriptures and it's amazing how god can use anyone how much more the redeemed bride now we're no different in the flesh to any of these people that god's used throughout time but it's because of the covenant of god that gives god the liberty right and when we realize now i want to get ahead of myself but when we realize that god can use us even if we fail 10 minutes ago and you just make it right you don't have to have a guilt trip you have to stay guilty for a while it's finished and he can use you because your heart is now in an atmosphere it's all about an atmosphere that's going on inside you and that even right now there might be somebody in this room that's got a negative atmosphere going on inside them because of something that's happened all you need to do right now in your is just say lord forgive me help me lord you know i i don't want to have that you all automatically can come straight back into an atmosphere where god can use and operate in your life so here in one john 3 19 to 24 it says and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart oh my life that's liberating in itself if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things he knows the bigger picture he knows what is what is your life about what is the projection of yourself what do you want in life no one wants to just struggle along and and fail all the time perhaps but we do we do we don't want to do that if you want to do that i'm not talking to those people okay those are out that's not but there is grace for those people too there's grace for everybody right but i'm addressing the people today this was a little bit further down but i'm addressing the people who actually want to please the lord who want to do right for him but struggle and they feel like they can't because they get beaten down by condemnation by guilt by fear by by these attributes of unbelief and sin which is not even their portion it's not our portion right it's not our portion that's why that body of sin was destroyed when christ went down into hell and preached to the lost it said that body of sin would be destroyed and it is destroyed and it's just hovering just behind you that old nature in a rendered state of disablement but what it wants is that wants to be enabled that wants to take over that wants to actually rule and so that your old nature teams up with the devil to try and bring you down because when you are under a condemnation when you find yourself in a state of guilt there's no faith there you can't have faith and therefore there's no supernatural there's no grace really there is grace because you're not going to hell or anything for it it just means that you're rendered useless really i'm sorry to use plain terms but and that was going to be the title was condemnation will not make me useless but i thought well it's a bit too much but you become when there's fear inside you and when there's doubts inside you and it's all not necessary it doesn't have to remain that way there is a real condemnations conviction of the spirit right and you make it right and the devil can condemn you and you can condemn you and oh my it just puts you down into a state and when you're in that state you become useless supernaturally you might be a great help in the church you might do all these good things for people and arms deeds and all of that to help people and you may be a great musician or a great this or that or whatever preacher at all but supernaturally that's the key to our victory it's faith and it's it's this is the most it's so simple it's so easy it's not hard it's all been provided for so that we can be in an atmosphere of faith in the midst of our own human dysfunction we god had to make it that way he knew that we would be struggling with this and he knew that he would have a program that little by little those things would be overcome but not all at once otherwise you would not be able by character and experience to handle what adam had before the fall right so he will little by little give you the mastery of the elements of the earth this clay and your spirit right little by little you will gain those things so it says for if our heart condemns not god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward god you see the moment that condemnation's dealt with and it can be dealt with very easily it's not a groveling thing it's not a catholic idea of you've got to do penance and go on and on and on god finally forgives you right no it's it's the law just if you just make it right right then and there the moment it's brought to your attention i was wrong i'm sorry lord forgive me condemnation guilt all the tactics of the enemy to render you useless as null and void and you are now a candidate where the supernatural can manifest in your life again whether you're three or whether you're 63 or however old right wherever we're at whatever age we're at we're free and the supernatural can operate because faith is in the vessel and that's what changes the whole atmosphere and it's little things that niggle at us and things that people do and do to us and whatever that can block up those channels but the moment those things are dealt with the moment that you put them right now god can work in your life now when you pray things start to happen hallelujah this is disabling the devil i i pray that he gets really disabled today really disabled i mean he's already disabled but let's make him any more disabled you know because his the only ability he has is lies and he lies to us he says you can't do this because of that and you can say yes i can because of the blood the blood's there amen there's a song it's called the blood is still there and it's an old good oldie and i can't sing it but it's a real good song the blood is still there who's glad for the blood still there you know it says in the opening scripture his blood cleanses us from our sins not our sin sin was dealt with at calvary in your first moment that you accepted christ but our sins plural is our behaviors as our shortcomings as our failures as all of those things that we keep doing over and over and we think the more i do it the further i get from god no it's not you can't get any further you're already connected the devil comes to you and says yo you did this and you did that so you can't do this but you can just make it right just say lord i'm sorry oh forgive me 70 times he said 70 times 7. not them if if god says 70 times 7 you can't do 490 bad things in a day i'm sure about it but even if you did 500 he'll still forgive each single one of them because he said that amen he said that so be enabled don't let fear don't let condemnation don't let guilt keep you on the ground you're an eagle you can fly hallelujah 22 it says and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments so hang on now we want to see what this means and do those things which are pleasing in this site so here as you read this we're going to get a we're going to have a devil on this shoulder an angel on that shoulder because the devil will say see you've got to keep the law you've got to keep everything that he says you've got to be perfect you've got to live right then he'll hear your prayers that's not right that's out of balance that's legalism that's that's legalism on the other side you have an angel you have the truth which says this and this underline and capital please is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another oh my it's coming right back to the greatest theme of our life and of our fellowship here love amen divine love it's all about atmosphere and love covers a multitude of sins so not only do we need to deal with condemnation in our own life but it's now to deal with condemnation or from our opinion of other people's lives you know what i mean because we can look and yes it's we can justly say there's a fail there's a fail that's wrong that's wrong right but love covers a multitude of that because when we realize that love covers a multitude of sins right the failures the mistakes the shortcomings of each other we can see the bigger picture and become just like god who's greater than our heart who's not small fry but he's big fry i'm just using colloquial terms he's big fry he sees the bigger picture he's like you know what yes but look at that and look what i've done and the devil says they're guilty god says no no they're not no because i've got my blood over them i've got a purpose for them and i need them to operate in the supernatural i need prophecies to unfold i need tongues and interpretation i need the gifts to operate i need the pastors to pass i need the dads to dad i need the monster mum supernaturally there's nothing like a good mother that knows what their children are doing behind their back and can say hey i know what you've done and then the child's like whoa how do they know that because i saw it in a vision i saw it in a dream this is a supernatural mum it's better than a natural mum that just tries to lay down the law and smack down and try and push it down but what about a prophetic mom amen what about a prophetic dad you can be and we are that because we're in a prophetic age it doesn't make us that we're prophets but we are in a prophetic age under a prophetic anointing to operate at the what's the word the very peak of god's church the very capstone of all that christ is and all the revelation of who he is to be given to his church we're not in a reforming age anymore we're not in the restoration agenda we're in a restored age under divine love it's beyond all of that now we all individually wherever we're at but the age is coming out into the rapture now we're going to be taking off the earth soon living so let's deal with condemnation not in only in ourselves now but in others as well because you see what does that provide what it does is it provides an atmosphere the moment that we get into an atmosphere of condemnation is and do not condemnation is a strong disapproval a strong disapproval i looked it up and so yeah we can strongly disapprove of behaviors in ourself and others but are we going to let that destroy the atmosphere in the church are we going to let that destroy the atmosphere and fellowship in our homes are we going to let that destroy the atmosphere and our parenting are we going to let that destroy the atmosphere in our workplace no love covers a multitude of sins for a purpose and that's why brother branhammy says when he got taken over into but beyond the curtain of time and he was shown the saints in eternity and he came back he says lay aside everything until you have perfect love lay aside everything [Music] it's just it just pales in comparison and here we see it we see you know we want favor with god we want to walk with god we want to be in a supernatural condition here it is believe on the name of his son jesus christ we know what the name is right the name is the uh it's an identity of his legacy what he stands for his inheritance and the revelation of his word that's the it's the i am right believe it's so simple and you'll be fought for that and condemnation and guilt and all these tactics of the enemy he's a leverage you know he levers off certain things that you go through he leaves off your failures and mistakes and when you're down in the dumps and you've gone through something and you just miserably done something wrong and you you're down there and then he says see god's not real god doesn't exist right there when you're negative you know when there's negativity going on inside and he just says that especially the young people anyone that's not born again you know and even people that are born again i mean he still tries it on me he still tries it i'm like are you serious come on devil honestly really mate he doesn't give up hey he doesn't give up he's a 24-hour devil but we have a 28-hour god amen he's an eternal god he's bigger than 24-hour devil amen and when we get caught up in a small fright condition in a small-minded condition then we realize that god's greater than that condemnation shall not disable me condemnation will not disable you you shall not be disabled by your failures this condemnation or you will not be disabled from your ministry from your calling from operating in a supernatural because his blood is there and you believe on the name of a son and you love and if you're struggling with love you know it may be a family trait it may be well we never know there's many hurts that happen right whatever it may be today is the day for you to really lay that down at the cross you know we don't have to have a big glorious camp meeting for this it can happen right now right when it's all warm and toasty right up in the you know we these things might come down into your very home and i don't i've got no personal ambition against anybody and whatever comes we'll just say it right and there's nothing personal but if it does come to your home then you just say lord here i am this is easy eh right no one's against anybody you know we're all in a battle right we're fighting together we're fighting the devil hallelujah amen amen so you see now this love is so important especially now you know back in the days when the lord was dealing with um you know in the lutheran days and the early reformers he was dealing with justification he was tired of people trying to earn their salvation you know the lord around luther and zwingli and all of those reformation times it was all about i'm justified by faith but their life didn't change but god was dealing with that they were probably horrible to each other i mean they probably had some good times too but there wasn't a real change in the way in that love and then as the ages moved on and as denominational tree grew and all these different things started to open up and different moves of god he was dealing in those capacities but now now he's calling his church to perfect love he's calling us to love like never before and if he's calling us to love like never before that means that there's a provision to make us love like never before he never calls of people without anointing them he never calls of people without providing and he actually comes i always you know i'm some you know i need a bible because anyone got an actual there is always a use for the paper bible you know that just doesn't work the same you know the lord has come in this generation and for all generations he's given the bible's been there and there's been portions of it revealed to different people different reformers different restorers different ministries and different moves of god each denomination they had you know most a lot of them the ones that god actually um used the leaders of you know he would give a portion but in the end time in the end time the lord would come in his fullness of his presence and he would open the whole thing and say here i'm going to provide for you the way that you can love i'm going to reveal my name and not just my name but your name actually i'm going to take you which is in this and i'm going to open you and you're going to know and you're going to be there with me and the inheritance i'm going to read it out to you every sunday every wednesday on the tapes i'm going to read my inheritance out to you and you're going to receive that by faith believing on the name of his son right this is what it's about it's not just i believe that his name is jesus that's that's just a title but believing on the name is deeper it's greater you're believing on the inheritance that he's reading out to you and he's shining his light and he's making it personal to you and some things you may not understand but you say i believe it lord reveal it to me let a transaction take place what's that that is absolving you from all your condemnation that's absolving you from all your guilt or your fear or your pain or your worry all your uncertainty or your anxiety or your depression which is a result of all of those things if anyone feels emotionally disconnected this morning there is an inheritance in here to reconnect human spirits back to their where they belong because we can disconnect and it's a that's a natural thing to happen if someone is going through consistent turmoil in their mind stress mental strain there's the reason that what happens is you go through that for too long your body says you know what i'm not liking these chemicals in the bloodstream right now all these hormones that are just so negative all the time that just flips off the switch you become disconnected it takes a while to get back but there's a grace in this room we we serve a god who can reconnect emotions amen hallelujah you know we go through trials and you might go through condemnation i'm not saying that the condom going through condemnation is fine it's what you do with it it's meant to get you to your knees it's meant to bring you straight to your knees and say lord i'm sorry i did that but if you don't and the devil beats you down and you feel like you can't even talk to god you're in a crippled state and it's in that state where he starts to get you further and further and entrenched in troubles so i just want to ask this question is there somebody in here that desires to serve god everybody desires to serve god you know there is a real just that just that little desire is all we need we can work with that little desire you know i mean there's probably you know people in here young fellas whatever i don't know and i'm not going to say what people think but there's people maybe on the stream i don't know that they've got a bigger desire for some other stuff right bigger desire for cars or a bigger desire for job work school life whatever there's a bigger desire for that than there is for god but even that little desire for god that's treasure you know there might be 99 desire for football or rugby right and one percent for god god can use that one percent and we're gonna capitalize on that one percent today so if anybody in here has got one percent only just one percent let's capitalize on that one percent you like that boy that gave us lunch he had five bars five loaves and two fishes or whatever he had and it fed five thousand people right just a tiny little thing maybe there's a thin thread left a thin thread left of desire for god today god will use that desire hallelujah amen to remove all condemnation to remove all fear to remove all the bondage and anything that holds you down so you can become a queen a king again and operate where you're meant to oh my we're eternal people right we never began and will never end in god's mind we were already there and somehow in his mind we're worshiping already in eternity okay now that's a very big thing to swallow but this is our reality right because it didn't begin so when we get there we'll we'll experience an unbeginning experience [Laughter] we'll experience something that never begun but because we began on the earth and because we were born and we started and we're going to end if we the lord tarries you see we we think of ourselves as beginning but no and so right now you may be going through stuff you may not even be wanting to listen to me you know i don't know some people now you're gonna you're shouting in heaven right now amen shouting if there's a little desire i want you to just offer that little desire that thread to god now i don't believe i believe that you know there's people in here that it's just they're just overflowing with desire to serve god right but i'm but we've got to we've got to find that thread as well because you see that thread is so important if that thread's not there there's big trouble that's the worst condition a human can ever be in is to have no desire to serve god now i'm not talking about having a child having a tantrum i don't want to serve god in one arm but if you take that child and when they're in their nice condition and they're happy they'll want to serve the lord right because they're but because the children's emotions are on their sleeve whatever's triggering that right now is just up and down and up and down and all my you know you know how it is but that thin thread let's work with that let's capitalize on that today and and the big thread in the rope three cut three quartered rope who's got a three-quarter rope a big rope lord jesus oh you just want to worship him and serve him you see that and you know you've got that right it's just such a desire such a longing there's no way that condemnation can stick to you there's no way that fear can stay on you there's no way that you can remain guilty hallelujah there's no way that you can stay disabled it's impossible to keep you disabled impossible to keep you on the ground as a natural christian impossible because you desire god oh my let's read i'm going to read this quote here it's very powerful it's one i'm actually probably you know this stood out for me one of the greatest quotes that's ever stood out for me says here and look at that little old ill-famed woman the woman at the well she recognized it she wasn't undocumented or indoctrinated i believe he was talking about she was morally wrong of course no one would endorse that you know we find ourselves maybe we're morally wrong we're doing something completely morally wrong you know and we think oh my this is just so bad i can't even go to church anymore i can't i can't be i can't operate i feel like i'm just a hypocrite god is greater than that god is greater than all sin he's greater than our heart he just wants he just said just make it right and come and follow me i'll deal with those things there's a time when that will be dealt with and you'll be humbled and all of those things will disappear but it may not be now but don't let that disable you don't let what you would class as great sin disable you just put it right with the lord you failed get back up come to church operate in your gift and your calling because god is not looking at your behavior now he wasn't looking at the woman at the wells prostitution and behaviors he knew he was going he felt a thin thread oh my there was a thread of desire over there at the well and he's and and and there was a vision in the open and said i gotta go to samaria i've gotta go there's someone there that desires me they're stuck in pornography they're stuck in sin they're stuck in some horrible multiple marriage situation and stuck somewhere and they can't get out but they want the messiah they're looking for me so he went there and he spoke to this woman he spoke to that little desire just started off talking about jacob's well and answering the questions and conversation got deeper and deeper and deeper until the word was discerning the hearts of the people the hearts of the heart of the woman and the word was going down into her heart until that desire was capitalized on until that desire became it just it just enlightened her because god can work with the thinnest thread god can work with that desire he looked beyond her faults he looked beyond the prostitution he looked beyond all the mistakes he looked beyond all the condemnation he says i am here to liberate you i am here to enable you so that you can function as a real redeemed son and daughter so that you can function woman at the well so that you can function so that you can go and share the gospel and cause revival so she she heard it brother branham says this she no one would endorse that what she was doing the laws of god condemn that she was morally wrong see god don't judge you upon what you are he judges not how big you are or how little you are he judges your heart what you want to be i've read this before but may it just sink down deeper today he judges your heart what you want to be i'm sure if i asked and sat down with each one of you and asked you what do you want to be you would say i want to be closer to god i want to i want to be happy i want to serve him i want i want to know my purpose i want to know why i'm here you know i want to meet him there would be not one sane person in this room that wouldn't want to meet the lord right really meet him and be in his presence you know we've read and listened to brother branham's testimony about beyond the curtain of time and how he couldn't even describe how wonderful it is there's not no one in here that wouldn't want to be there right children and all who wouldn't want to be there i mean i asked my children a lot you guys want to come to heaven right who doesn't i mean it's a simple question but you know who doesn't who doesn't want to meet him right that's a desire for god now there are insane people or that girl that criticized and ridiculed the prophet's ministry and then said her mother's soul could fry in hell and she wouldn't even should laugh right there's people you can cross that line so we won't lean too far on you know the other side you can cross the line but if there's a little desire just a small one because you might be clowning down with all of these failures and you think oh i'm just i'm just so worldly now i can't serve the lord anymore my mind is just filled with all that stuff just make it right with a simple prayer lord forgive me i've done all these things the moment you make it right there is nothing between you and your savior nothing all condemnations dealt with all bondage everything the prophet says see god don't judge oh he judges you what you want to be he didn't want she didn't want none of that stuff and deep down you know the things that we struggle with the things that we go through as a human being in the natural the things that bind us and bring us down we don't want that no one wants to be that way no one wants to have a struggle with for certain things no one wants to struggle with pride or struggle with lust or struggle with fear or struggle with lying no one wants to struggle with those things and you see we don't have to be condemned when we do there will come a conviction when you do it and you just make that right but don't let that disable you continue walking walk on god walk in the supernatural with him amen because you see he's got a plan the supernatural flow requires faith despite a person's overall performance it requires confidence towards god all fear and condemnation must be dealt with by grace and that's where graciousness comes in that's where the love when divine love is projected sovereign grace takes its place the grace of god the enabling power of god is able to operate it's able to supernaturally inspire it's able to birth people into the kingdom it's able to transform lives it's able because of love because there's love it's that atmosphere you want to be sticky right sticky with the love of god because you see the capstone's coming down the lord is descending upon his church divine love needs to amalgamate with divine love and the more divine love is in the church the more the capstone can really fellowship with us the more he can come down so please don't let condemnation rule you don't let condemnation disable you you know the devil's a bully the time has come to stand up to fear and condemnation when i lay down he says i fell asleep instantly and dreamed this dream i saw a man that i supposed was my father he was a great big burly man i also saw a woman who was supposed to be my mother but she didn't look like her even as the man did not look like my father the man was a very mean was very mean to his wife he had a large club with three corners on it you know when you take a log and set it up on end and hit it with an axe it makes a three cornered wedge wedge-like piece of wood firewood it was like that he would take this club and hit her with it and knock her down as she would lie there crying you know have you found yourself in that condition before where you're just beaten down by your thoughts you're beaten down by condemnation you're beaten down by your failures and you're just lying on their crime disabled unable feeling like you're just not worthy to serve the lord you see that's not our portion we don't have to remain in that condition says here he would walk around with his chest stuck out and his face was such a proud boastful look that he appeared to take great pride and satisfaction and beating up a poor little woman every time she tried to get up he would hit her i did not like what he was doing but as i considered stopping him i thought you see now this is the problem here sometimes we think but it's not what god thinks right so now here the prophet says i thought i can't tackle that man he's too big and sometimes you think your problems are too big and you're your failure is just this great thing against you right your humanity's too big god is greater than that greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world who's he that's in the world your old nature's in the world your old nature is a sinful nature but the god that's in you and the new life the new nature that's in you is greater than the nature that's behind you trying to drag you down all that condemnation all of that failure does not have to rule you i will not let condemnation disable me amen i want you to say that i will not let condemnation disable me amen there is blood there is provision for us to walk free to stay free and to live free and to set others free because when you are free you have the ability by supernatural inspiration to set others free amen is there anyone in here that doesn't want the supernatural in their life any hands anyone doesn't want the supernatural of god oh good so everybody wants the supernatural of god amen well i encourage you now from this time deal with condemnation wisely deal with guilt wisely you're not guilty you are free you are justified as if you never sinned amen there is a bleach for you that bleaches out all amen when the book came open hallelujah it was revealed who caused it all who caused it who caused it satan he's the cause he's the first cause of all of these world events that are problematic and antichrist he is the cause when this came open it revealed that you never did it in the first place it revealed the power of the blood did you notice when the seven seals were preached and seal number one was preached and this was the book coming open and you know what he preached about bleach he preached that the blood is like bleach and when your sin goes into the blood it's like it goes back to gases and cosmic light it goes back to where it came from the devil and he will take all the sins of the redeemed and all the things that they ever did and will do they're all allotted to lucifer and he's going to take them to the lake of fire so just think about that next time you make a mistake boo devil boo devil amen my sin those things that my mistakes they're on your head satan you caused that you're the one that infested the human race with all these sinful things you're the one that tempted you're the one that's in my own nature but i'm not that anymore because i was born again hallelujah if there's someone in here that needs to be born again the altar is open the altar is open if anybody i'm not looking at anybody that isn't i'm just looking at people because i like looking at people so don't think i'm looking at you for any reason you got to be careful you know people think oh no he's looking at me ben looks at me you know and i'm like what are you looking at what did i do ben gets a trajectory you know and he's like going from here to here and i'm like i'm right in his line of sight i'm like try and move over now oh mate yet but you see god has made provision for us more than enough his blood is so powerful it's so bleaching you don't have to be condemned you can operate in your ministry you can operate in your calling you can operate in supernatural there's nothing between you and your savior because of the blood because of calvary and because it's been magnified by an open book because it's all come open it's like oh god says you know right the devil's come out on the earth through television and radio and all the ether waves and the internet and all the youtube and all the sin and all the super sports stars and all of that to idolize and steal the minds of boys and girls steal their minds steal their heart from the true hero of every boy and girl which is jesus christ the lord needed something better it was no longer just suffice to have denomination it was no longer sufficient for churchianity and religion it was no longer sufficient just to believe on the cross that your sins are saved and live still live a sinful life it was no longer sufficient just to have a holy life and it's no longer sufficient just to have a supernatural life but it's only sufficient to receive the bleach to receive the fullness of the word to receive the opening of the word because you're believing on the name of the son of god you're believing on the name now who is that as a person and he's here and he's saying here's a bit for you today here's a bit for you tomorrow here's a bit for you tomorrow i'm reading now to my open book and i'm saying this is yours this is yours this is yours this is yours and as he reads it you know and then let's see and you go whoa whoa okay that that you know like am i hitting this good you want me to use this handheld thing you know as he reads open you know because he's here in the fullness of his presence we may not feel any different the more we get closer to him he will allow us to see things if we remain in condemnation you're not going to feel nothing right unless the sovereign grace overlooks that to get you out of it but he's here today to tell you you don't have to remain in it you don't have to be condemned you don't have to be guilty of nothing you don't have to have no fear no worry no uncertainty you don't have to have depression don't have to have anything nothing can all be dealt with but as he reads the open book to you it starts to expose things in your life that need to be dealt with right not to condemn you to clean you to change you to show you actually yeah you know what i'm going to the altar today i'm going to get that dealt with i'm going to slip my hand up at the prayer and say lord here i am i don't need to go to the front you can go to the front you can go wherever you like the lord is wherever you're at he's looking at your heart he's looking at the desire of your heart and you're like lord i heard something today that has it it's convicted me lord i just i'm sorry for that and lord i i believe lord this is my time for this to be dealt with in my life because you see puts it on your heart and you might have in your memory and our memory can be a big problem for us because we remember all of our problems right we remember all the things we do and then you think oh my i've got to deal with all of it and then you know you you have this whole lineup of stuff that's got to be dealt with and in your mind and the way you think is like okay i'm condemned because i can't i'm it's just weighing me down don't let it weigh you down god's dealing with those things he's got his finger of judgment on every sinful attribute in your life he's got his finger of judgment on every trait of your family that is not of god he's got his finger of judgment on every cultural misfit you know when i say a cultural misfit there there's things that we bring from every culture that's not fitting to the spirit of god it's not message it's not openly it's not heavenly it's earthly it's stuff that's been contracted by the fallen world it's misfitting he's got his finger of judgment on every single one right he's got a season when it will be dealt with so he says here every time she tried to get up he would hit her i did not like what he was doing but i considered stopping him i thought i can't tackle that man he's too big then he's supposed to be my father but down inside i knew he wasn't my father and i knew that no man had the right to treat a woman like that i went over and grabbed him by the collar and turned him around and said you have no right to strike her and when i said i love that his blood has brought us back on speaking terms remember that speaking terms that means you can speak to god and god can speak through you and you can speak under his inspiration for him and so your words become omnipotent under his inspiration when i said that my muscles grew and i looked like a giant that man saw them and he was scared of me you know you're a devil chaser you're a devil chaser he's scared of you if you just lie on the ground crying he's bigger and bigger and bigger but the moment you take a stand and you say my god is greater than this failure my god is greater than my heart he's greater than this deception he's greater than all these things that i see all the failures that have pinned me down and disabled me i'm unable today i'm gonna stand and i'm gonna say devil no longer are you going to keep me down no longer am i going to hold back no longer am i going to stay home condemned no longer am i going to down on the ground and i say satan we're through condemnation not today guilt not today fear not today you stand for it stand up against it stand up against it that's a bluff he's a bluffing bully he don't ever meet a bluffing bully they're more scared but they they cover over their fear by being a bully that's the devil he's scared the moment you stand you're bigger but if you don't he's bigger remember that so address your enemy you know we find ourselves beaten down by our own failures and rendered useless in our own self-image as a result we are often bound by a condemnation and fear which is not designed for believers to remain under we shouldn't remain under fear or remain under condemnation or remain under guilt yes they are real emotions yes they serve their purpose but not to remain under now we have to realize now the power of the blood the power of restoration the power of the blood to restore our relationship with god so that we can live in an atmosphere of faith so that now when we're in that atmosphere of faith and his love comes and we say lord you know when you're praying and his presence comes down it's building that love if you don't have that you struggle to love and you feel like you're just snowballing under all of the weight of the world and the weight of the troubles and the problems god is greater than those problems god is greater than your heart he sees the bigger picture he sees a perfect person he's not he's not gonna be you see that wasn't god with the three-sided club that was not god doing this sometimes we think god's like this you know the angry father and the loving son he's the same person he's a loving god he's a gracious god and his grace is there to equip us to keep us in fellowship we are to remain in fellowship lord forgive me i'm not gonna be subject to condemnation no more i ain't gonna let no proud boastful devil club me down and i'm sure as the heavens not gonna let him hammer down my friends and family our fellowship amen so we stand for ourselves and we stand for our families and we stand for each other amen hallelujah and you see now because of condemnation it gets dealt with because fear gets dealt with because guilt gets dealt with and all of these things get dealt with in your experience now your heart condemns you not right you don't feel condemned in your heart anymore you have confidence towards god now you can talk to him now you can't expect a visitation and i am going to encourage you today as a new year this year 2021 class of sunday 27th of december this is your homework when you pray tonight expect a visitation if there's condemnation and you've done something make it right and expect a visitation i'm preaching to myself man it's hard to pray sometimes there's a wall of devils making you need to get up you got to go do this gotta go do that not just honestly just want to sit there and go his presence is just so good that's what's going to build your relationship it's what will build your love is quality time with god you watch and then when the things go on that love will be like a buffer to buff out all the sins that you commit and the sins that each other's failures and whatever they do i mean we're not i don't see all that but you know it happens but you see what does that do that's the divine love projected over the church so that sovereign grace who loves sovereign grace sovereign grace is our friend sovereign grace is what will change lives sovereign grace is an enabling power and we need to be enabled today because condemnation fear guilt doubts all of that stuff will disable us and when we're disabled we're not lost but we're useless and i don't want to be a useless pew sitter sorry about the language but and i'm not meaning it in a very derogatory way i just mean we don't want to be useless in his body right we want to be useful it may not be a public thing but it's useful because there's something going on in my prayer time there's something going on when i'm playing that thing and when uh deborah you know there's an anointing there's an anointing because there's faith right you believe we're not up there just you know doubting we're up there believing and when we play this the more these you know you play the bass you play this drums and the piano and whatever singing preaching down the back there is an atmosphere there's a supernatural component when we're sitting there and the preacher's preaching we're not sitting there just saying i wonder he's going to say next you know like we're actually going oh lord i'm pulling on that thing i'm touching the hem of christ's garment through that gift you know there's an active if you've got a need right now paul lord meet my need right now i need speak to me about this confirm this lord i need direction you watch what will happen the minister will be pulled to that and and you just if you got you know and you'd be alert man i i get inspired you know and then i forget that i'm thinking about you know i have a question and maybe you know we go through the service and i've just had a glorious time and then bronwyn will say afterwards did you hear that did you hear that did you hear that i'm like oh no i didn't but now i get it because i've just had a good time but sometimes we've got to really focus and think okay you know you you you're listening for something and maybe you're listening for something today you know the i think brother albert preached here a while ago he says incline your ear to the lord we need to incline our air you know he wants to say something and you know that's that pull so you're not just a passive part of the service sitting down there you're actually fully engaged and active young children you can say lord speak to me speak to me i'm not too young samuel was what seven eight and the word came to him yes he was a prophet but you're in a greater age you're in the age of prophet prophetic age and eagle age he was all the way down there way way way way back and now we're here at the culmination the consummation of everything hallelujah where we are to be enabled today be enabled don't let the devil beat you down you know god's blood voids the need for condemnation now when i say that i mean prolonged condemnation because there is a god can strongly disapprove of things that we do right strongly disapprove of it but that doesn't mean that we have to stay guilty we don't have to stay in a condition of guilt or fear or worry or uncertainty does god really want to use me yes he does he'll use anybody whose heart doesn't condemn them i pondered this because i go when i first became a christian you know i was i knew the message was true but i was going into pentecostal churches and going into these denominations and looking meeting people and whatever you know and making bible studies and i and i'd see these people and they're living lives that i would consider very sinful right doing drinking and whatever but the spirit of god is using them huh and you think wow and it made me think and i thought well okay so how but do you know what it was wasn't their behavior it wasn't the fact that they know all the doctrines of the bible it was the fact that their heart was not condemning them and they had faith and they believed that god would use them and he did so how much more you think your things are wrong and oh i've slipped up today oh i just keep thinking that thing oh these memories i just try and pray and and all these filthy images come into my mind or all of these memories just press me down oh and you think oh god won't use me god will use you he wants to use you he doesn't want those things to render you useless he has provided blood for all past present and future sins in revelation 1 5 remember we read this needs a clip on today i'm going to tuck this under my collar all sins all our sins are dealt with so all of those things that you think is rendering you to a natural prayer life i'm sorry lord all the time it's not like that god is your father he's your bridegroom he loves you with unconditional love it's like you know he just wants to really operate in your life he wants to utilize the resource that he's placed within you powerful treasures are inside each one powerful treasures abraham powerful and you mate you just see you know we we know you know we see children and we think my good boys you know and they just want to play and all that stuff but you know there's treasures inside there ready to be just to come forth and we we we can't judge a book by its current stage or anything we just have to sow the seed and you sow and you sow and you sow and then the quickening power comes amen the quickening power comes to quicken what's inside to bring it out and that's the same as us but we cannot let the devil beat us down we cannot let the devil team up with that old nature that's down behind us that's always wanting to rule always wanting to come back always you know forming alliances with all sorts of demons and devils to try and win you back over to try and bring you down because you see when you are useful in the hands of god when god gets a hold of you and your channels are open he's very scared you are a real threat but you're also a real blessing to the kingdom of god and it goes beyond natural blessing it's it becomes a spiritual blessing it becomes a supernatural part of the body you are supernatural addition to the house of god just in the simplicity of all of this and i maybe this may be super elementary but i believe that we need this we need to hear i don't have to be condemned i don't have to be guilty amen you know you because if you do if you feel that way because sometimes we're living in sin or living in us we've got we're not living in it but it's just crippling us down and it's you can't find a way out you see god can look beyond that and he wants to get you back into service he wants to use you he wants you to function again and all you need to do is say lord i'm sorry forgive me now try me i just want to get into action you may find that that's the very thing that will bring your deliverance not sitting back not withdrawing not saying i'll deal with this later you'll go further back you you pull back you know the ember you take the ember out of the fire it gets cold if you take the ember out of the fire it gets cold you know and that ember just gets colder and colder and the devil gets bigger and bigger but the moment you say here's the line devil that's it and you stand and you say just like the prophet says i said he saw the devil was real big right then but something rose up and i pray that something would rise up in you whoever's struggling with these things and you say no to my mo you have no right to hit me down anymore you've got no right to have my brethren down she's not made to cry on the floor her position is the scepter's extended and she has coheir with the king hallelujah she's got the king signet amen amen full authority and power unto half the kingdom amen that's what you've got win when you're in an atmosphere it's all about an atmosphere it's all about your knowing your position and living in it your position is an atmosphere it's perfect love where perfect faith can operate that's where you'll possess what your position is right and you're up there but down here where the speaking happens on this earth to deal in the war you've got to be connected to the real reality of who you are right you are a theophany in eternity and that's the real you and when that one that's the one that when he says when you say be thou moved and cast into the ocean who's he talking to he ain't talking to that old foul nature he's not talking to this disgusting old flesh that's full of sin he's not talking to that he's not talking to that you he's talking to the real you the real you that's shouting in heaven right now the real you hallelujah that was with him when he split the red sea that was with him when the ark went through the river jordan that was with him when he stood on the boat and said peace be still that was with him up in the in the in the wilderness and the bush and the storm and he said be thou moved in and and son you shine four days we were with them we were with them that's the real you part of that great body that's the one he's saying when you say that's the one when you get aligned with that wow atmosphere our deal with your condemnation deal with your guilt you don't have to remain under it and i'm here to tell you today be enabled you don't you're not condemned you are free you are free you are free god can use anyone amen he is greater than our problems greater than our heart because your heart is deceitful above all things we read in jeremiah verses 7 17 verse 6 i think five or six he used jacob he was a supplanter he used abraham he lied he laughed at god did god just get rid of him no he used them father of the faith oh my you can see the power of the blood there because in the old testament before the blood was spilt you read about all that when the new testament i see nothing do you see anything why because the blood had been it had null and voided his condemnation he used moses who killed an egyptian outside of the season and doubted all the things of god and smote the rock and twice you know he still used them and we thought he was condemned but he didn't even got his body got carried away and we saw him on mount vernon transfiguration he was able to deal with the condemnation he used them amen god is not afraid to use a vessel that's not behaving well okay i'm i'm gonna go to some extremes here so that you realize you're in a pretty good condition you're actually well behaved you're actually good children amen we're actually quite good you know in the grand scheme of things and we think god won't use us because of this and that and i do this and i think that oh my he god's not that small fry you know he's not that low down that he can't use somebody that you know hasn't got a perfect life he's looking for a motive and he's looking for an objective he's looking for a desire what do you really want what's the real heart of your life do you really want to serve god you really want to you love him you know now i'm not condoning any activity here just remember that i think oh yeah you know i can do this it's okay it's not okay it'll be dealt with right but you've got to get into action he wants his angels he wants his messengers he wants his people reverent humble and in action he's looking for a motive that's pure he's looking for a heart that desires him he'll work with that that person might be living in an awful condition but they desire him he used nebuchadnezzar he really did use nebuchadnezzar and he's talked to him and he fellowship with him and he told him all these things he dealt with him he tried to help him right and he was an idol worshiper he was an evil king that tried to burn the three you know he did all these things but god still used them we may see him we may see him you never know you know it says all those that do the will of the father right no you just don't know so cyrus he used cyrus king cyrus the edict right he used artixy's and hazaris he used these kings to to issue fourth great edicts and great like liberations of the jewish people he spoke to them god spoke to them god operated in their lives under the blood of bulls and goats god was not afraid to have fellowship with these people on a good note to liberate people god can use you if god can use them amen so don't ever think i'm just not you know i'll get my life right then god can use me then i'll get in the ministry then i'll no if god is calling you if god if there is something happening on your heart there's a desire that's what he wants he's not looking for your perfect behavior your perfect record oh i've been so good for a week now i believe that i'm ready to go and play in the band i've been so good for a week now now i can answer that call to be a song leader now i can answer that call to go and you know i felt on my heart i should be i should share the word with the sunday school or whatever or preach the gospel and you're just waiting you're just trying to clean your life up no no he will do that and he will do it in his time in his season so deal with the condemnation deal with the guilt so you get a bit of faith in your heart so that you can operate and you can pray and god can listen and hear and it's just about fellowship where you get down in your bed and you get down in your closet down in your dining table sit down in the pew and his presence just comes down it's real simple real simple but it's very essential it's the utmost essential thing of our experience despite not despite you know on accumulatory to our salvation is fellowship with god fellowship with him where we're at he's ever present wherever you go even when you're down in a condition that you would class as hell oh my he's there psalm 139 says if i make my bed and he'll behold thou out there they'll know us my goings my thoughts everything he knows everything he it even says in that psalm he knows that when he was forming the earth this is how much god knows he says he knows all things right straight after we talk about condemnation in the scripture he says i he knows the earth the clay that your body would be made out of he knows that and when he was forming that his mind knew that that bit of clay molten rock or whatever was going to be the clay that you would be made of and he knew when your body would consume that clay out of dust out of fruits and vegetables and meat he knew that he knew what scotch fillet it was that am i doing something naughty he knew he's got it really covered he's got this whole plan covered he's got his redemption covered he's got your life covered he's made provisions so that you despite your humanity can stay in fellowship with him you can stay uncondemned you can stay guiltless who likes the idea of remaining guiltless who likes the idea of remaining fearless see when god comes to you and i was watching this cartoon last night and i was getting frustrated at the character and there because she was just doubting everything and i thought my she just needs to have an experience with god and then that moment she got an experience with god and then everything was faith again she was now talking about how good he is no matter what the circumstances you know i thought man we need that and it's that transaction that transaction that can take place in our life where we go you know because you can read your atmosphere and be a thermometer you can read your condition and you can take on that temperature but i don't believe that's our portion we've been given faith to overcome this world faith is the victory that overcomes the world right but you can't have faith if your heart's condemning you so therefore you need to believe that his blood is sufficient for my sins that what was spoken of was to enable me freedom from that so that i can have faith to overcome this world because otherwise i'll be a thermometer and i will take on the temperature faithfully faithfully read the atmosphere of greed fear lust whatever it may be read the atmosphere of hatred malice envy bitterness what's that word resentment oh my you know when i hear that word resentment i think oh that's like as that's as bad as it gets when it comes to just a resentment you know how much that cripples the atmosphere when you resent oh man if that could get any worse resentment and hatred god is greater than that you know we get ourselves in a thermometer if you're a thermometer and i believe i'm looking at thermometers but if we if we end up in a condition where we're reading the atmosphere we get guilty because of all the circumstances you're looking at it and yes it's there but they that observe lying manatees all lying vanities forsake their own mercy do you understand jonah said that now if anyone had symptoms it was jonah jonah was in the bottom of the sea in a belly of a big fish and it was probably not very didn't smell very good down there and it was probably not very nice but he was there there's not many ways there's no way out and he decided i'm gonna refuse this he if he was a thermometer he would have just laid down and became lunch because he was already lunch but faye said i'm not lunch and you don't want to be the devil's lunch we don't want to be the devil's lunch and no matter you might be getting eaten alive by the mosquitoes and plagues of this earth and all of the sinful attributes just coming at you condemning you guiltifying you and bringing you down and pressing you to the ground crying on the floor like the woman at the well probably cried every day longing for something real and then one day you know but something had to happen and jonas stood up and said no i'm not going to read this atmosphere i'm not going to read this condemnation i'm not going to read this guilt i'm not going to read my failures i'm not going to read my shortcomings i'm not going to read my family traits that are bringing me down i'm not going to read the disgusting things that are going on out there i'm not going to read all this stuff that's condemning me down i'm not going to be a thermometer faithful to my atmosphere the atmosphere can be negative and dark and black all around you i'm not going to read that anymore make that resolve in your heart resolution i'm not reading the atmosphere anymore i'm going to hope against hope i'm going to call the things that is ours so they won't and i i'm going to look silly and i'm going to testify and i'm going to sound real dumb to a natural-minded person but to a spiritual person that i'm going to be cheered on by the great cloud of witnesses come on we can see you the race is almost over we're about to go and they're all carrying around the banisters of heaven come on come on stop reading the atmosphere around you stop being thermometers now it's now time to be a thermostat it's now time to set the temperature it's now time by faith when it's 17 degrees and too cold i'm going to say no it's dirty amen and when it's 100 humidity and i can't sleep it's all sweaty and yuck it's perfect it's going to be perfect and i'm going to change that who believes they can change that who believes they can change that how when your heart condemns you not so if anyone suffered from condemnation in their hearts now i can we can all just put our hand up right now today i just want to encourage you don't stay in that condition don't stay there it was a greater thing for you you know god used rahab god used tamar samson gideon jl who knows who jl is statement her husband made a covenant with with the enemy but god used her to put a nail in the captain of the enemy's host head hallelujah god used her she was in a very bad condition was god too proud to use her no our god is willing to stoop to the lowest place and look up to the shortest man amen has has his love is boundless god can do whatever he wants and he wants to use you he wants you to operate in his kingdom despite yourself despite your failures despite all your humanity rest assured this shall be dealt with brother branham says this you know and i just wanted even this last group of people that he used the wise men you know we're just so used to that story but you realize that these men were astrologers they read the stars and they and they were magiz but they actually really wanted to meet the messiah there was a seed sown maybe through generations now this is why i'm the reason i'm saying this is that desire is a very important thing that you've got in your heart if you just just have a little desire for god that can bring an omnipotent experience in your life just a little desire that god can capitalize on that so if you find that you've got that i would be getting on my knees and crying out things thank you jesus oh thank you lord because you see many people don't have that but if you've got that today a little desire is what the magi's had the astrologers the wise men and god saw that and he granted their desire it says here you say here then brother branham do you think that god would deal with those magis the bible said in hebrews the first chapter and the first verse that god in sundry times and in diverse manners all kinds of manners he spoke unto the fathers it's also written in acts 10 35 that god is no respecter of person but he honoreth those in every nation who desire to serve him in righteousness though you be an error yet in the righteousness of the projective of your heart that you desire to serve god god will honor that amen so therefore denominations has no lines that they can sit that will stop god to any certain creed because god will look upon the motives of the human heart and there he will work from that spot isn't that powerful right and i believe god's got many categories and i believe that god will call people to their category god will call people to their calling god will call people to a tribulation god will call a bride out of it before it happens right and if you're being called to that just surrender just submit to that calling and let god call you and just oh lord let me be a magnet i just want to be magnetized to that purpose amen we don't want to put down those that are believing for a tribulation and and they have prophecies and all sorts prepare hey i'm not going to say that isn't the lord because god has people going through a tribulation a foolish virgin right he's got a he's got those people and they're preparing and they believe and their faith is to prepare so he's calling them to that and he's got people out in the world that he's using in some way shape or form calling them to a purpose but what is your purpose now if god can use those people and we look and we see the things that they do and the stuff that they allow and then god and we think oh well if god can use them and operate in a supernatural how much more you and i just as human as anyone else but with a high calling a calling to operate in a supernatural realm how much more can he use us amen what do you want to be there's a timing for deliverance the battle in the land and the importance of not rushing ahead of the battle plan in exodus 23 20 it says behold an angel i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared i will send my fear before thee and i will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come and i will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and i will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the hybrid the canaanite and the hittite from before thee now we read then we think oh my they're going to just take that land right then and there right it looks like it and yes god's made the provision for it but watch now there is a clause there's a catch it's timed it's seasonal right i will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little i will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land so you see the lord in our own life because you see they crossed the natural jordan and then a captain came down with a sword into the land to lead them in the battle right and he led them and they went to jericho and they set the bride free so she could marry that's first and foremost right is that the first and foremost in your life when the captain when you really died to yourself or maybe you need to do that or you've already done that and you've received the holy ghost who came down the captain came down into your life with an open book that's the holy ghost the holy spirit today amen do you understand do you follow that that's the holy ghost you crossed over jordan come into the promises of the father right under the prophet's ministry the ark led you across and the minister has carried on the shoulders of the ministry and you died to yourself and you're you know down to jordan you know jordan carries your sins carried the water goes to the dead sea you know that the lowest place on the earth the dead sea the saltier sea you float in it what a salt do it preserves so what is happening now when you die to yourself when you surrender absolutely everything that you know you the lord knows when you surrender he's he might you might not know all the things that's going on in your life there's still battles ahead but whatever is going on in your life right then your will yourself your ambition you as a person and you say lord i give up here i am i'm absolutely done i'm sick of living in this wilderness i'm sick of an emotional turmoil i surrender all i surrender all my entertainment i surrender all my belongings i surrender all my work i surrender my dreams my plans everything because i am through with it all and you follow the word as it opens and it takes you across you follow it and washed in baptism in the name of jesus christ it washes your sins down you got baptized in the red sea come through the wilderness now you come to jordan and all those sins that you carried get washed down where to the dead sea that's where your old nature is to stay under preservation until you receive your body change in the dead sea right that's where you've got to pre but it doesn't die it's there it's destroyed you know that we're destroyed means dormant what keeps it dormant the dead sea salty man it gets preserved in salt this is all types right it's not literal but you see your old nature's still there and it still tries to rise up it says let not sin rain in your mortal body to obey it and the lusts thereof it desires things it wants to come forth again let it not so you cross over jordan right you cross over and your old nature gets washed down and you come into the land who comes down into your land the mighty angel with the open book what for he opens and he reveals the mystery do this reveal these things go around the city seven times open the book to this person he opens the book to you why because the rahab inside you there's a rahab in each one of us that's stuck in a babylonian prison stuck but there has to come a time where that one's released now that gets done first you believe that you believe that your bright identity your identity has to be released so he breaks down your jericho walls inside you he does that that's his first thing he does he has a ceremony in your life rolls away the reproach and gilgal they called it gilgal it was a rolling it means and it's the they had the second circumcision there where they circumcised the flesh of egypt that was left for years and they they they stopped sanctifying themselves spiritually speaking and and yet now when you come into the land you get a re-cleansing it cleanses you to prepare you and then the captain comes down and comes into your life what does he do he breaks down that wall is that it no he's in the land now though the spirits in the land who likes that who says amen the spirits in the land now this land the holy ghost with an open book and that story the sword was drawn he was ready to fight the enemy he says i send an angel before thee to go before thee to send hornets and send all these things why because i'm delivered these enemies but i'm not going to just get rid of them all at once you're going to deal with these things little by little but you rest assured don't get condemned now the moment you get condemned and under condemnation you get under fear get under guilt your campaign stops right there and you stand still and i can and all those things start to come on and then you get to fasting like joshua and you get to going real serious why is there no action in my life what's going on lord i haven't grown for years i've just warmed up you oh i've just gone backwards what's going on what's happening in your heart what's happening inside there is there faith because it takes faith and then you deal with that condemnation so that faith can take its place then the captain begins to move again and the acans get destroyed and all of those golden wedges and everything starts to happen is that the end no there's another one then there's another one then there's another enemy then all of a sudden the gibeonites come and try and deceive you and you make it make a covenant with the wrong thing right like they did they deceived they they pretended they were from far away this happens to us this happens in our own land do you realize that these things happen to us we're going through these things we sometimes make the covenant with the wrong thing we think it's right but it's not right if we've done that just just surrender it to the lord now is that the end no all of a sudden you think man you know then you know what happened to israel the all of the amalekites confederated they had like five nations at them at the same time has anyone ever felt like you've had five troubles come at you at once five troubles you know you're one's enough and you get five and you think man what have i done lord how did i go get to this level where did i go wrong you ain't got wrong they didn't go well you know they made a covenant with the gibeonites but they didn't go wrong god knew he said i sent hornets he didn't take back his hornets he hasn't taken back his hornets by the way you can still have hornets you can still have pestilences for the on the enemy you can send bees and wasp to them you know i've sent bees and wasps to the enemy i sent pestilence upon him he makes me angry righteous anger have i done something again every time a man leaves that desk i'm like oh no i've done something bad he hasn't taken back what he said he's got all of these things ready to deliver your enemies and he will and he is and you just got to keep walking and you come up to those five confederate amalekites and you might fall on the ground a few times and you might get you might get stuck there for years i know that sounds bad but it does happen you might get stuck there for years at one spot israel dude says in joshua man this one here dan and they just slobbed slothed around you know they took they didn't inherit the land and it reads out the report of you know joshua is almost ready to be passed away and it reads out the status the current status and that none of them really hardly took all of their inheritance right they were still heats to take but it was too hard it was hard they had to do something oh my they had to believe but what happened was they made they made confederate with this one and they made a little covenant there what happened god says stop doing that but you see now what is that and if we bring that into our own experience you made a confederate with fear you made a confederate with condemnation guilt you made a confederate with lust you made a confederate of jealousy you made a confederate with whatever despair depression whatever these things that comes down and what do you do you stay on the ground and you sit and you lie on the ground crying and you don't move for years and all of a sudden someone preaches something and they say no you stand up now stand up and address your enemy now it's time to stand up and address your enemy you'll become big again hallelujah humble but big huh real humble but big they humble themselves shall be exalted and exalt themselves should be abased but you've got to stand against your enemy of condemnation because condemnation will not disable me it will not disable you if i let condemnation disable me i would not be doing this if i let condemnation disable me i would just sit in the pew and do nothing that's right because i do things wrong i make mistakes and i don't and i know the lord doesn't like it and i make it right i make it again does the lord go are you making too many i'm not going to forgive you now no but the lord will deal with those things but i can't make him deal with it right now i do you know he said that to israel i will drive them out when i want to drive them out when i see you're ready to handle the because you see when you get victory over that thing that's another portion of power that you have in your inheritance and you begin to be able to do something more in christ a little bit more power gets allotted or you get access to more you know like when you i shouldn't do use video games but you know the more you go through a game the more access you get to its things and powers and whatever well it's kind of you know the devils that's just the devil's perversion of the real christian because you see the more you go through the game of life that god has allotted to you and this is a better game than sitting on a stupid little plastic thing in front of a tv that just that's just boring man boring what about playing the real game this is better graphics this is far better graphics caleb i'm telling you now no man can create these graphics this is real good these eyes have got the best graphic enhanced you know technology and like virtual reality you know this is reality reality and we're walking through this and as you grow in christ he unlocks more power as that next enemy now don't get condemned because the enemy is still there don't get condemned because that family traits still pulling you down and getting you down on the ground don't be condemned by it stay in an atmosphere of faith stay in faith even though that's happening stay in faith stay in the ministry stay walking continue on continue walking because you're gonna if you get if you stay still the encampment for that enemy for that amalekite might be 10 kilometers that way in um type world yeah like it might be just over there and if you're not walking you'll never get to that encampment but it will continue condemning you condemning you condemning you because you've seen your life it's in your land but you've got to advance and you've got to walk up to those amalekites and now the trials come now the battle gets an array now it gets hot and heavy now all that stuff that was condemning you now you're facing it now you're really failing now you're really going through it now is the time now great jehovah eagle comes down and swoops down and and he crushes them with hornets and crushes them and the angel of the lord which is in you comes and he says here devil get out of here amen and everything gets destroyed and you take that portion you take that embankment you take that land now it's yours now all of a sudden your prayer life becomes you just become like you've just got more status more more more levels you know no i don't mean that people are like this or levels everyone's the same of god and there's no respect they're a person but on a inheritance level why settle for that much when the land is that much all yours and he says i'll give you this and i'll give you this and i'll give you this you see now you haven't got this part yet the devil's still squatting on that but you've got this and all the power and all the access and all the arcade that brother ben was talking about is here and here but you haven't got to that yet now there's things in this part that you haven't got to yet that you're failing at still because the enemy's squatting and you're getting condemned by that but hold on a minute who's leading the battle who is leading the battle he just the head is this one right this is part of your inheritance just ahead but you're getting condemned by it and you're not even facing it yet you need to walk so you need to get up address the enemy say devil i'm through with this condemnation i'm sick of just sitting here i'm going forward and i'm going to walk forward and all of a sudden i'm facing that now the thing that was condemning me sitting there sitting pretty they call it it's just sitting pretty in the land no no no nothing you might pray a little bit about it and it might cause a little bit of something on him but you're not facing it yet you see to face the enemy the enemy's got to surface to face that complex in your land to face that family trait that's got to surface you might go through council to face it and the pastor will sit there and talk and you'll explain a story and as you explain it you break down and you wonder why am i crying it's the holy ghost and in a pastoral ministry and in council the holy ghost brings it out it's like drawing it out of you and it's right up here in the room now this demon and the demons there that's been troubling you all your life but you're facing it now it's there it's real and the reason you got there is because you started walking and you got closer and closer to the embankment all of a sudden the captain says now and you read the urum of them or whatever you call it you read in the word it says now you know the lord he you consult the lord and you're reading and all of a sudden something illuminates with you you're like well that's actually something i've been struggling with and then you get to church and the preacher preaches exactly on that thing and you're like man i'm undone then the next monday you're calling the pastor i need a meeting i need to talk about this and you sit down and you talk about it and you go through and and the lord brings it out and you say oh my and you pray through for something and that and then all of a sudden you take it right so you've got a little bit more and then you and and now there's still stuff here squatters in your land right and they're still troubling they're still doing things that are every now and again the devil cycles around and he's cycling around these things that you haven't conquered yet and you just keep cycling around that and you just what he wants to do he doesn't want advancement he doesn't want you to advance further in your inheritance so what does he do he wants to keep you here he knows he can't take that back from you he you you've got that and your level with god and your your power with god you know jacob he wrestled with the angel and he got power with god right this is a level with god this is an experience with god where he and now he had power how much more now under the new testament can you get power with god right so this is your power with god but here which is your land and it is your inheritance and it is the opening of the word it is all yours but they're still in in your land is still some troublesome enemies and they're causing you to feel guilt when you fail at that one and fail at this one and fail at this one and and and what he wants to do is render you useless even with all the stuff you've already got can you think about that just think about that here's a person and i'm speaking to people in here that maybe you know some people are probably here and they've still got just this little bit and then it's a rapture body change here you know let's just look at it like that now this is just my own little analogy but let's say the body change is here i'm on this map yeah we're going to leave the earth so there's the body change we might some of us might be there but if you're under condemnation all the stuff that's in here that's yours is not used because you're in condemnation you've got no confidence with god so but and what's condemning you is one last little devil on this side here not in the book okay don't let me don't it's not in the word that's on your land and it's stopping your access to this part of the word right so i'm not talking about the word having enemies in it the word doesn't have no enemies in it it's your land that has the enemies in it but it's covering over that portion of your inheritance right you've got to conquer that now you need to this here this here this is still a squatter and he's just causing you that grief and he's the last one so he's going to go real hard on you he's like real angry like the devil now it says in the book of revelation that he's real angry because he knows his time is short right so he's just putting all of his effort and he's trained his eyes on us his target hears his crosshairs are on you but fear not the angel is before you amen and so the purpose of the devil is to take this last squatter that's causing you trouble and condemn you so that you still become useless and he's going to try that all the way down until one day he's all been delivered amen that's why the book came open to you here open one day open genesis serpent seed open all of the abraham open all of jacob open all of moses open all of exodus open all of deuteronomy show what the laws and all of that open all of joshua and all of samuel amen and you can see open all of the books of the kings and all you see yourself in all of it right and all those prophets and all the prophecies and you see yourself in mark matthew luke and john the lion the ox the man the eagle through to revelation 4 and you're caught up by a prophet's message up into revelation chapter 4 and you understand all of that stuff given your inheritance right through to the things that are to be through to the end it's all there right and you're getting little bits but if you get under a condemnation in your heart or a fear or whatever a weary and it's not dealt with you stay right there and then you lose that you don't lose access but it becomes they call it um i don't even know the word there's a term where or it's like a caveat you lose the access to your inheritance because there's a when you get under condemnation it places a caveat on what you've already got and it stops you from gaining anything more right what is that fear condemnation devil's tactics leveraging off your old nature does everyone understand what i mean was that a good analogy to understand what i'm talking about i'm nearly about to close by the way i'm about to close josh sorry i might do the same thing i'm about to close becca children eh i love me okay i've got one more quote if we can have the musicians please so can you play that song not today isaac are you ready not today which is the basic version you know the devil can try condemn us to a crippled state for enemies in our life that will only be dealt with later in the battle there might just be a few more stations to conquer before such a time you know so we we don't want to get condemned by enemies that aren't yet to be delivered right does everyone follow and the messiah prophet says this now when a man is converted say just like that little white button starts in his heart now that part is god god when he's born again with the spirit of god god's spirit dwells in him now as he can let that spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness don't you love that you know we sometimes think that you get the holy ghost after all that's done right but no the holy ghost comes in to begin that real internal battle that i've just been speaking about in your land inside your body right this is what he's talking about he's talking about the holy ghost coming into you like a little white button the size of that button there see just a little bit of light comes in but now you feed listen here you feed him on the word it says now as he can let that spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press god's way through him again he can become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the garden of eden don't you love that that god will create an identity condition in your life can you imagine like the paradise unfallen paradise inside you there your flesh will still be raging enemies and just dealing with the world in that way but inside is a as an ethernet condition ruling in love amen i mean who doesn't want any genetic condition inside them i mean how this is as great as it gets jesus said in mark 11 24 verily verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it in your heart but believe that you've you have what you said will come to pass you can have what you said that puts him right back supreme again it puts him right back in the condition now we're made up of light meters inside of us as cosmic light now that cosmic light is a light that they can take an x-ray with the x-ray doesn't come from the x-ray light it comes from your own light and then if that cosmic light say could be pushed to a place to with not cosmic light but eternal light god could dwell supremely to do our thinking do our walking do our talking then it's no longer the man it's god in the man this is the final quote here has and i just want to ask you this question has the lamb step forth with the bleach to you to you personal if he hasn't today is the day that you need to settle the account with god has he it's a personal contact that's a personal revelation and i ask you has he if he hasn't today is the day for you it's here but here is the mediator standing there if you just want to play okay sweet but here is the mediator standing there amen the kinsmen redeemer amen stand there with the blood that can take the vilest sinner's heart and change it the mediator is on the throne yes sir satan said but they're guilty he can say they're not that clorox was invented who knows what clorox is bleach clorox is bleach that bleach was invented or manufactured to take stain to take the coloring out of ink or any other stain they got it it'll break up so you never will find it again it goes back to gases and all the way back to cosmic light and past molecules and everything else till it turns back to the original where it come from is he your lamb i ask you this question today young and old is he your lamb has he stepped forth into your heart opened his word and said take and eat for this is my body that is given to you has he done that and has he become a lion to your enemies because when he he's your lamb but he's got to be a lion to your enemies amen you understand when he comes into your heart in such a way he becomes a lion to your enemies that a lamb to you see the lamb is on the throne the intercession is on the throne but what throne your throne he comes to sin in your heart so that intercession can happen for you personal because we're at an evil age in an age where we must rise up far above all the works of satan and the works of this flesh for we shall take a rapture please stand with me let's just sing this song not today amen does everyone know the song it's on there caleb you just put the new verse on me okay as we're singing the song i just want you to address your enemy and then we're gonna pray this is a serious hour if you want to continue on in the fight in the battle you don't want to be disabled you need to stand and say condemnation will not disable me but i shall walk on and tow the line as my god promised me a full inheritance who believes that amen he came to us jesus son of god redeeming love you paid the price my sacrifice so i say fear you try to have [Music] not today not today you will leave me now in

the mighty name of jesus i will say not today [Music] not today you will leave me now in jesus name you will leave me now in jesus name just with your head bound your eyes closed as the music plays today is a day where we can toe the line today is a day where we can say from that time i'll never be the same again not because of the preacher not because of the music but because of the word of god who's come to declare a jubilee it is jubilee time it is time that we make a stand that we will not let fear doubt pay lust envy resentment backbiting all of these evil traits find us anymore we may struggle with these things but today if there's someone in here that has drawn a light in the sand and said no more devil i want you to pray with me we're going to pray together we've sung this song and i really wanted to sing this song because we can really toe the line with the enemy say i'm not going to live a natural life no longer alone i'm gonna walk with god in my land i've got a little bit or maybe i've got a lot but there's more because i haven't had a body change yet we're somewhere along the line things where are you who are you what do you want what is your desire my desire is a rapture my desire is to leave and be part of this eternal kingdom i'm sick of this world to be right beautiful brutally honest i'm tired of this world this world's got an end this world is a fail and if anybody thinks that they're having fun you've got nothing compared to what is fun up in him this is nothing we think we're holding on to our little creature comforts our little hobbies they're nothing compared to what we're having and we're going to go there soon and so who are you eternal beings who are you who never began and will never end where are you right now in the grand scheme have you got a page of your inheritance yet maybe you haven't started but this is all yours all of it this whole inheritance is open to you not because you're anything different than any other saint of any other age but because of the time that you're living in the messes you were born under the signs that you were born under the time of the fullness of all things you just happen to be chosen to be here and i'm just going to challenge each one now wherever you're at child teenager mother father brother grandma omar whatever you may be wherever you may be here and on the tape do you understand where you are if there is only a little desire left right here draw the line and say i desire god and i'm going to let him at this moment take me and take my little thread that's left because i need to go on with god i want something real right now i'm done i'm finished i'm through with fear i'm through with condemnation i'm through with being torn between two opinions i'm torn i'm through with it i'm through with all of the ups and downs the ins and outs the left's the right i just need something real i need something real i need deliverance i need help i need grace right here this is my new year this is it this is resolution and the resolver is here the enabler is here the one that can change lives is here and he wants to take your little thread of desire that little thing that's just remaining by the skin of his teeth he wants to take that right now he wants to take that and grace it and enable you to walk on maybe you've stopped for years maybe you've been still and today's a day that condemnation is dealt with today is the day that doubt has dealt with today's the day that your heart no longer condemns you today's the day that you stand up to the proud boastful devil that's been wandering around you and every time you try and get up he beats you down with a three-sided club until you're crying on the floor unsure of who you are but today is the day toe the line draw it in the sand and say my little desire is going to be turned into a fire this little desire this little light of mine today i'm going to let it show there is grace in this room the presence of god is here to turn it all around right now right now you can say not today satan i'm not going to be crippled on the ground no longer right now i'm going to stand and right now i'm gonna let god take this desire and turn it into something beautiful i'm gonna let god i'm gonna let that little white button of light that came into me at some camp at youth camp or at wherever it was i'm gonna let or or some great moment in my life where that light came in i'm gonna let that light just push out a bit more now because i'm not condemned anymore i realize that the blood is more powerful god is greater he sees more he wants me to function i'm not going to pull back anymore i'm not going to just pull back because i'm condemned by my habits i'm going to be part of this vision because now i can move and advance to the next portion of my inheritance i'm not going to be condemned so i can never get to that thing that's troubling me i don't want it to trouble me no longer but i've got to advance towards it i've got to go forward i'm going to go forward lord oh are you with me church we've got to go forward you've got to press the battle if you don't press forward you will always be condemned by the things that are ahead of you you've got to go and take them otherwise you'll just stay crippled and useless on the floor well we can't it's not the age for stagnancy we can't stay here we are transitioning we are moving the gospel is moving the ship of zion's about to land get on board get on board as the song of old says get on board come come while it's light work while it's day it is your season it's your time to come and by the grace of god that can take this thread of desire in my life and turn it into an eden eating condition because right now if my heart's condemning me it's
