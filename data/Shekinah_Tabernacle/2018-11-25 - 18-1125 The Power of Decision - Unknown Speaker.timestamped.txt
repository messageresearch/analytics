[49:14] know that if our earthly house of this
[49:16] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[49:18] building of God a house not made with
[49:20] hands eternal in the heavens for unless
[49:23] we groan earnestly desiring to be
[49:24] clothed upon with our house which is
[49:26] from heaven if so be being clothed we
[49:28] shall not be found naked for we that are
[49:31] in this tabernacle do groan being
[49:33] burdened not for what we would be
[49:35] unclothed but clothed upon that
[49:37] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[49:39] now he that hath wrought us for the self
[49:42] same thing as God who also hath given
[49:44] unto us the earnest of the Spirit
[49:46] wherefore we are always confident
[49:49] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[49:51] the body we are absent from the Lord
[49:52] before we walk by faith not by sight
[49:56] Amen licious behaves in a word of Prayer

[50:47] in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god
[50:50] bless you or you may have your seats
[50:52] this morning I also like to thank
[50:54] brother Isaac for preaching on Sunday
[50:55] while I was up and Taronga and I just
[50:59] like to you know I heard the service and
[51:02] I want to say I'm so glad I have no
[51:03] place at that table hallelujah I'm glad
[51:06] I only have a place at the table of the
[51:07] Lord and I'd like to thank brother Andy
[51:09] for Wednesday night let's walk on the
[51:10] water hallelujah let's it's
[51:13] let's step out amen let's step out and
[51:15] walk on the water now I do speak on this
[51:18] morning about the power of the power of
[51:20] decision now this may seem a bit
[51:24] elementary but I couldn't I couldn't
[51:25] shake it off today but I want to go into
[51:27] more this just making a mental choice
[51:29] now the definition of a decision is an
[51:33] active process of deciding the moment of
[51:36] decision has come a determination that
[51:39] has arrived after consideration it's a
[51:42] report or a conclusion now that's the
[51:46] definition now every every decision has
[51:48] consequences the decisions we make even
[51:52] today will shape our future they shape
[51:55] who we are in the end shape where we
[51:57] will end up they're the decisions
[51:59] sometimes we think our decisions don't
[52:01] don't carry a lot of weight but they are
[52:03] but they do what we do today as a result
[52:06] of a decision we made years ago so who
[52:08] you are today is you made a choice maybe
[52:11] a few years ago and that decision has
[52:13] has directed you are certain a certain
[52:15] path right you know it it puts you on a
[52:19] certain trajectory of life your
[52:21] decisions like your decisions like a bow
[52:23] I mean and you're the arrow and your
[52:25] decision will fire you to a certain
[52:27] location so it depends on what your
[52:29] decision is right now you know when I
[52:34] was when I was 14 years old
[52:36] now I'm I guess I'm a nerd well I do
[52:40] science as a job so I'm a bit of a nerd
[52:41] but when I was 14 I saw a diagram of an
[52:44] atom on a blackboard in science class
[52:47] and I thought to myself that that was
[52:50] quite interesting that sent me on a
[52:52] course that I had now work in the
[52:55] science field but it was a decision it
[52:58] was a small thing but a decision
[52:59] directed my path down a certain way now
[53:02] that's just natural things now people
[53:05] are remembered for the decisions that
[53:07] they make people are remembered for
[53:09] their decisions such decisions become
[53:12] defining moments where and that is what
[53:15] people are remembered for even though
[53:17] they may do many things in life and many
[53:19] other things certain decisions that they
[53:21] make will stand out and will become
[53:23] landmarks in history as you
[53:27] you think of you know Abraham Lincoln
[53:29] you know brother Brown speaks of Abraham
[53:31] Lincoln very highly and he and he said
[53:33] that he is reading where Abraham Lincoln
[53:35] he he he got off a boat down in New
[53:37] Orleans this is this is before the Civil
[53:39] War before he became president and it's
[53:41] during the days of slavery and he's seen
[53:43] them taking great big burly colored man
[53:45] his little wife two little kitty
[53:47] screaming crying praying and they
[53:48] auctioning him off
[53:50] they had to breed him with some big a
[53:51] woman to bring forth a bigger bunch of
[53:53] healthier slaves and the little mother
[53:54] standing there and old Abraham Lincoln
[53:57] took off his hat from his head headed
[53:59] and his first he said that's wrong that
[54:01] man's a human just the same as I'm a
[54:03] human and some day I'll hit that thing
[54:05] with all I've got even if it costs my
[54:07] life he made a decision that that was
[54:09] wrong something something resonated an
[54:12] assault that that was wrong and he was
[54:15] going to fix this thing and it's
[54:17] normally what happens when when
[54:19] decisions are made it brings forth a
[54:20] character out of you right it really
[54:23] produced it or really reveals what's in
[54:25] you when you make a decision if Abraham
[54:28] Lincoln did not have the character he
[54:29] had he would have moved on like any
[54:32] other one who can done slavery but
[54:34] something in him rose up saying I'm
[54:35] gonna deal with this thing hallelujah
[54:37] and he did and it cost him his life
[54:40] hallelujah Amen this normally with great
[54:42] decisions great prices must be paid I
[54:45] mean we know the greatest decision God
[54:47] made before the foundation of the world
[54:49] with a lamb was land hallelujah for you
[54:51] and I he made a great decision how
[54:53] Redemption would come and he knew
[54:55] wouldn't be by someone else he had to
[54:56] become a man into it he had to fulfill
[54:58] the job great decisions were made I mean
[55:01] great prices were paid in great
[55:03] victories were won because of that
[55:04] decision I mean when our Lord was there
[55:06] on the Garden of Gethsemane and said not
[55:09] my will but thy will be done when to
[55:11] Calvary is a man hallelujah he made a
[55:13] great decision I mean but he wasn't
[55:16] looking at us at his present
[55:17] circumstance real decisions are made by
[55:20] faith when the word is revealed to a
[55:22] people that's when real decisions can be
[55:25] made wrong decisions are made by
[55:27] temporal looking at temporal things real
[55:29] decisions are made by with the eyes of
[55:31] faith looking at the promise of God
[55:34] hallelujah I want to be in that kind of
[55:36] category of people where I make every
[55:38] decision based on the Word of God
[55:40] by man's influence or pressure or
[55:42] culture or whatever but solely on the
[55:44] Word of God
[55:45] hallelujah that's the kind of people
[55:47] that we're built to be i mean you will
[55:50] discover as you walk with god there's a
[55:52] character and you didn't even know you
[55:54] had I mean there's a determination
[55:57] there's a grit hallelujah
[55:59] I mean you you'll you'll realize that
[56:01] you'll go through the trial you won't
[56:03] stay in the trial you go through it I
[56:05] mean because he'll lead you through it
[56:07] hallelujah I mean it's Abraham Lincoln
[56:10] made a decision that was wrong brother
[56:12] Graham said that Abraham Lincoln we're
[56:14] told that you know he never owned a book
[56:17] in his life until he was a till he was
[56:19] of age and the only books that he had
[56:21] was the was the Bible and pilgrims
[56:24] progress and that molded his character
[56:27] to make him the man he was I mean so so
[56:31] so the things that he that you look upon
[56:33] will mold your character the things you
[56:35] feed upon will mold your character if
[56:37] you feed upon the things of the world
[56:39] entertainment whatever more I mean that
[56:41] will mold you a certain way but if you
[56:43] if you're fixed on the Word of God and
[56:46] you allow that to mold your character
[56:47] that will produce the Word of God in
[56:49] your life amen and it will make you a
[56:51] certain way and you'll make the right
[56:53] decisions hallelujah John Wesley's
[57:00] mother Susanna Wesley incredible woman
[57:04] she had 17 children this is in the days
[57:08] of we didn't have the modern
[57:09] conveniences of this kind of your modern
[57:13] era but she found - you were told she
[57:17] she found two hours or more a day every
[57:19] day to pray she had 17 children often
[57:22] her file
[57:23] your husband would be off doing
[57:25] different things but she she she had she
[57:29] made a decision that she was going to
[57:31] raise her children for the Lord and she
[57:34] out of out of her 17 children two of the
[57:37] greatest men of the age were birthed
[57:39] John Wesley we know he you know he was
[57:43] the messenger to the age and he saved
[57:45] the world in a revival I mean with the
[57:48] second work of grace sanctification
[57:50] hallelujah and then also produced
[57:53] Charles Wesley
[57:54] the greatest songwriters that have
[57:55] struck the earth she made a decision
[57:58] decisions are not always easy to keep
[58:00] there's always a lot of adversity yo the
[58:06] devil doesn't want us to go have an easy
[58:08] way right to to walk with God you've got
[58:11] to make up your mind and sell out and
[58:13] you've burned every Bridge and that's it
[58:15] I'm walking with him come what may come
[58:18] what what yeah it doesn't matter what
[58:21] happens I'm walking through Lord Jesus
[58:23] I'm walking through you've got to have
[58:24] that kind of euro settle it in your soul
[58:28] hallelujah amen so so so she she made a
[58:32] decision she was going to raise her
[58:34] children I mean I know it that way
[58:38] and out of her out of her motherhood
[58:41] produced John and Charles Wesley she
[58:44] didn't have it easy all the time but
[58:46] that was her she made up her mind this
[58:48] is the way I'm going and on this is the
[58:50] way I'm going amen
[58:53] Winston Churchill he knows Winston
[58:55] Churchill Winston Churchill was the
[58:58] Prime Minister of Great Britain during
[59:00] World War two they'd come to a great
[59:03] crisis time Western Churchill he you
[59:07] know we remember him for World War two
[59:08] but he he had a lot of failures in his
[59:10] life that are not recorded you know not
[59:12] you know there aren't the things we
[59:14] normally remember him for he is the one
[59:16] who planned the glibly campaign it was a
[59:19] great failure you know we know in this
[59:22] country that you know ll national
[59:24] identities founded there on the beaches
[59:27] there of Turkey you know where the
[59:28] campaign failed of the Anzac troops he
[59:30] actually devised that campaign he had a
[59:33] lot of other failures in his life but
[59:35] when it came to his defining moment in
[59:38] life I'll go back to Abraham Lincoln
[59:39] Abraham Lincoln he didn't have a lot of
[59:42] success in his life he was you know he
[59:45] he went for public office quite a few
[59:48] times and and he didn't win he had a lot
[59:50] of hardship but we remember him for the
[59:52] Civil War
[59:53] white really remember him for the
[59:54] Gettysburg Address because his character
[59:56] was mold all the way down for that
[59:58] defining moment of time sometimes we may
[1:00:01] be just used for a short space John the
[1:00:03] Baptist was molded for 30 years for six
[1:00:06] months ministry
[1:00:07] that was his defining moment he made a
[1:00:09] decision I don't know how it came the
[1:00:12] spirit Lord hate you
[1:00:13] you know we're told the scripture says
[1:00:15] he received the Holy Ghost at his
[1:00:16] mother's womb
[1:00:17] when he was a small child the spirit
[1:00:19] drove him out into the desert to prepare
[1:00:21] him I mean for six months sometimes God
[1:00:23] will just users for a short space of
[1:00:25] time but there were years of molding and
[1:00:27] character development hallelujah that
[1:00:29] will make the right decision at the
[1:00:31] right time
[1:00:32] hallelujah was the Churchill you know
[1:00:35] you know there's the you know Great
[1:00:37] Britain its epitomized in a bulldog you
[1:00:41] know grit determination they hold on
[1:00:43] they don't let go that's the that's the
[1:00:46] character of great burden and this was
[1:00:47] epitomized in Winston Churchill he was
[1:00:51] determined we need when the you know
[1:00:53] when the Nazis just blitzkrieg their way
[1:00:55] through through France and and different
[1:00:58] countries they basically controlled them
[1:00:59] take them too long and they conquered
[1:01:01] Europe and then England was virtually
[1:01:03] just standing alone he rose up he did
[1:01:07] not say let's give him he did not say
[1:01:10] let's make peace with Hitler like his
[1:01:13] predecessors tried to do but he would go
[1:01:16] to a school in 1941 he spoke at harrods
[1:01:19] school I mean he rose school in October
[1:01:21] the 29th 1941 and this was the main part
[1:01:24] of his address to to to the school
[1:01:26] children never given never given never
[1:01:30] never never and nothing great or small
[1:01:32] large or petty never given except to
[1:01:35] convictions of Honor and good sense
[1:01:37] never yield to force never yield to
[1:01:40] apparently overwhelming might of the
[1:01:41] enemy here they were facing the might of
[1:01:44] Nazi Germany and this was how he was
[1:01:46] well never surrender we'll fight them on
[1:01:48] the beaches and the hedgerows we will
[1:01:50] never given we will never surrender and
[1:01:53] it rallied a whole nation
[1:01:55] hallelujah and really the whole nation
[1:01:57] this was how he was because he made a
[1:01:59] decision we're going to fight we're
[1:02:01] going to rise up and fight hallelujah
[1:02:03] now if that's just a natural war how
[1:02:05] much the bride of Jesus Christ do we not
[1:02:07] have a cause I mean do we not have a
[1:02:09] water fight a victory to win the rapture
[1:02:11] to take hallelujah but you've got to
[1:02:14] make a decision whose side are you going
[1:02:16] to join I mean because the devil will
[1:02:19] treats us God has no fear
[1:02:21] I'm sitting on the fence will the devil
[1:02:23] built that fence get off the fence you
[1:02:26] not some whining cat moaning to the
[1:02:27] moonlight get off it a mental s never
[1:02:32] given our decisions shaped by various
[1:02:36] things our backgrounds as we've spoken
[1:02:39] about Winston Churchill Abraham Lincoln
[1:02:41] our environment our culture our family
[1:02:43] tree our nature we're born with shapes
[1:02:46] our decisions amen
[1:02:48] but we must remember that even though so
[1:02:51] God because many times you think well
[1:02:53] I'm making a decision and it's totally
[1:02:55] neutral it's me you know you know I'm
[1:02:56] the boss of you know what I'm deciding
[1:02:58] that's actually not the case as brother
[1:03:02] Isaac I think sit on Sunday we are but
[1:03:04] dumb sheep doesn't matter if you're
[1:03:07] doesn't matter what pedicure and you
[1:03:09] still a sheep amen
[1:03:12] it doesn't matter if you you can be the
[1:03:15] head RAM of the flock you're still the
[1:03:16] Sheep holy amen so you know it's more
[1:03:21] than just our our top two inches here
[1:03:24] that makes a decision right but the
[1:03:26] decisions we make a result of an
[1:03:28] influence now when when we speak about
[1:03:33] so we must remember that even though God
[1:03:35] God has put us here on free moral agency
[1:03:38] we have the power to choose nature
[1:03:40] doesn't have a power to choose they just
[1:03:41] are governed by instinct but we have a
[1:03:43] power to choose and God put us there on
[1:03:46] that way but when we think about having
[1:03:48] free choice that has a bias in it our
[1:03:52] choices are directed by our nature so
[1:03:56] our free moral choice is directed by the
[1:03:58] nature in us it governs our choice right
[1:04:02] so we are just here a total I'm neutral
[1:04:05] I'll make any choice now your nature
[1:04:07] will guide you a certain way whether we
[1:04:10] like it or not and it's because now so
[1:04:14] and this is why man always makes the
[1:04:16] wrong choice this world is going to blow
[1:04:19] itself up because man made a wrong
[1:04:20] choice and man has continued to make a
[1:04:23] wrong choice men are born now we are
[1:04:25] born with a fallen nature that's why
[1:04:28] we've got to be born again right that's
[1:04:30] why a new birth has got to happen you've
[1:04:31] got to be not just turn over a new leaf
[1:04:33] and reform at all
[1:04:35] you know our new users coming alternate
[1:04:36] a new leaf it'll blow back right it'll
[1:04:39] blow back you'll go back into the same
[1:04:41] rut unless God comes and changes your
[1:04:43] nature you'll continue to do the same
[1:04:45] thing you've always done I mean that's
[1:04:46] why we cannot save ourselves or redeem
[1:04:49] ourselves you need a stronger power than
[1:04:51] you I mean to come into your life and
[1:04:53] change you that's why that's what has to
[1:04:56] happen amen so now it takes we are born
[1:04:59] with a fallen nature and it will always
[1:05:02] end up making the wrong decision amen
[1:05:05] our nature and us will guide us so it
[1:05:08] will panda that's why men will always
[1:05:10] pant it to the flesh they'll always be
[1:05:13] selfish ultimately they'll always look
[1:05:16] after their best interest they will look
[1:05:18] after number one that's themselves by
[1:05:20] the way right just they will do you know
[1:05:23] the you know the world says just do what
[1:05:25] makes you happy
[1:05:26] amen yo just live for the moment and
[1:05:28] that's why this marriage is falling
[1:05:31] apart family life is falling apart is
[1:05:33] because this world pandas to our first
[1:05:36] birth I mean they say just say just live
[1:05:39] for the now live for the moment I'm
[1:05:42] living for a moment right that moment is
[1:05:45] where my body has changed in a moment in
[1:05:46] a twinkling of an eye that's the moment
[1:05:48] I'm living for right that's the moment
[1:05:50] many people know and and so I trust
[1:05:53] you're living for the same moment
[1:05:54] now many people repent of things and ask
[1:05:56] for forgiveness only because they get
[1:05:59] caught right that's not real repentance
[1:06:02] that's just being busted right many
[1:06:05] people repent because they get caught
[1:06:06] that's not real repentance right that's
[1:06:09] just because they get busted you've got
[1:06:11] to do the more than just ask for
[1:06:12] forgiveness you've got to pray until you
[1:06:14] die to that desire and that God changes
[1:06:17] your nature until that desire is dead
[1:06:19] that's what has to be the way that's how
[1:06:21] you can make the right decision as the
[1:06:23] desire that take you down that road
[1:06:26] amen dies hallelujah and there is a real
[1:06:29] death nothing about natural death you've
[1:06:31] got to die to yourself that you're there
[1:06:34] your nature changes I mean God gives us
[1:06:37] a nature change hallelujah that's why
[1:06:38] we're a new creation we're not a patched
[1:06:40] up pression we are a new creation we do
[1:06:43] that the believer really does get born
[1:06:45] again it's not a catchphrase then
[1:06:48] that's all grace and they live in a big
[1:06:50] gray area that always panders to the
[1:06:52] flesh and they say well God will forgive
[1:06:53] me and they're still living the same way
[1:06:55] that's not it that's not it that's when
[1:06:58] God comes in changes your nature that
[1:07:00] the desire you had to live in the world
[1:07:02] is dead and you have no desire to do it
[1:07:04] anymore and all you want to do is live
[1:07:06] for God I know what it's like I wouldn't
[1:07:08] even have been here a few years ago you
[1:07:10] wouldn't catch me in a place like this
[1:07:12] you and catch me living the life I I'm
[1:07:14] living now I mean back you know just
[1:07:16] over 10 years ago but something happened
[1:07:18] to me and it was Jesus Christ happened
[1:07:20] to me hallelujah
[1:07:22] so now we don't want to live a life
[1:07:25] where our decisions are based on our
[1:07:27] first birth we want to live a life where
[1:07:30] our decisions are based on God's life in
[1:07:33] us according to his word right brother
[1:07:37] Bram says in the breach between the
[1:07:38] seven churches and seven seals he says
[1:07:41] now he was given a free moral agency
[1:07:42] speaking of Adam it was given to him
[1:07:44] just as we as to make a choice now Adam
[1:07:48] and Eve in the beginning there was a
[1:07:49] tree of right and wrong before them that
[1:07:51] same tree sits before each and every one
[1:07:54] of us God isn't doing for Adam and Eve
[1:07:57] you say well it's their fault
[1:07:58] no it's not their fault anymore it's
[1:08:00] your fault you can't place it on Adam
[1:08:02] now you replace it on yourself because
[1:08:05] right and wrong is hit before you you're
[1:08:07] on the same basis of Adam and Eve but
[1:08:10] you see when we are redeemed we no more
[1:08:14] want our own choice but we want his
[1:08:17] choice right that's how you know that
[1:08:20] you are redeemed you know you no longer
[1:08:21] want your own will what you want I mean
[1:08:24] you want his will what he wants and his
[1:08:27] will and what he wants is his word
[1:08:29] hallelujah ain't you glad to be redeemed
[1:08:31] I mean when you came to a place where
[1:08:33] you four footed your own will over to
[1:08:35] him and he took control hallelujah amen
[1:08:40] now Adam and Eve one of their own choice
[1:08:42] they wanted to they wanted to find out
[1:08:43] what it's like to have wisdom so they
[1:08:45] probed into it and of course death Allu
[1:08:48] you know and that's why we're in this
[1:08:51] position we're in today now let's go to
[1:08:52] Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 1 you say
[1:08:57] well how can
[1:08:59] you know how could it be that God
[1:09:02] changes your nature he has to change our
[1:09:05] nature
[1:09:07] season Hebrews 10 otherwise we're just
[1:09:10] living under the blood of bulls and
[1:09:11] goats but we don't offer them anymore
[1:09:13] right
[1:09:14] this there's greater power in the blood
[1:09:16] of Jesus Christ amen to transform any
[1:09:19] life depends on your decision though
[1:09:21] amen who are you choosing you know
[1:09:23] because many people they say they want
[1:09:24] to be like Jesus the only way can be
[1:09:26] like Jesus if Jesus is in you right you
[1:09:29] can't be Jesus okay you can't be like
[1:09:31] him and your own ability for the law
[1:09:33] having a shadow or we in Hebrews 10 and
[1:09:35] 1 for the law having a shadow of good
[1:09:37] things to come and not the ear very
[1:09:39] image of things can never with those
[1:09:41] sacrifices the blood of bulls and goats
[1:09:43] which they offered year by year
[1:09:45] continually make the comers thereunto
[1:09:46] perfect for then would they have not
[1:09:49] ceased to be offered because the that
[1:09:51] the worshiper once purged should have no
[1:09:54] more conscious of sins so if you're
[1:09:56] purged you have no more conscious of it
[1:09:58] right but in those sacrifices there is a
[1:10:02] remembrance again made of sins every
[1:10:05] year for it's not possible that the
[1:10:08] blood of bulls and of goats should take
[1:10:09] away sins now let's drop down to verse
[1:10:11] 12 but this man he's speaking about Lord
[1:10:13] Jesus after he had offered one sacrifice
[1:10:15] for sins forever sat down on the right
[1:10:18] hand of God from hits forth expecting
[1:10:20] til his enemies be made his footstool
[1:10:22] for by one offering he has perfected
[1:10:25] forever them that are sanctified we're
[1:10:28] of the Holy Ghost also as a witness to
[1:10:30] us for after that he had said before
[1:10:33] this is the Covenant I'll make with him
[1:10:35] in those days saith the Lord I'll put my
[1:10:37] laws into their hearts and in their
[1:10:38] minds will I write them hallelujah see
[1:10:42] sag now that the that the blood of bulls
[1:10:44] and goats can't purge a person it just
[1:10:46] covers up soon but the blood of Jesus
[1:10:48] Christ purges us off sin hallelujah that
[1:10:51] we have no more consciousness of sin
[1:10:54] hallelujah I'm glad he purges us I'm
[1:10:56] glad he cleanses us I mean both faith
[1:10:58] and his word he cleanses and purges us
[1:11:01] amen now our decisions as I've said will
[1:11:06] be made ultimately because of our nature
[1:11:08] and our nature as I said is governed
[1:11:13] nature is actually governed by two
[1:11:14] powers only to Satan's influence which
[1:11:19] will produce sin which is ultimately
[1:11:20] unbelief in the Word of God right you
[1:11:23] boil down sin that's not not a dull tree
[1:11:25] you know lying drinking smoking murder
[1:11:28] rape whatever it may be those are
[1:11:29] attributes of sin but the real sin is
[1:11:32] unbelief right so Satan's influence will
[1:11:35] ultimately cause unbelief in God's Word
[1:11:37] or God's influence will produce faith in
[1:11:40] the word right it's it's those two
[1:11:43] influences on our nature now those two
[1:11:47] are the two most important I'd say in
[1:11:50] terms of this is what we're going by so
[1:11:53] so I've settled that because we have to
[1:11:55] realize we're not just wandering through
[1:11:57] the world master of our own you know own
[1:12:00] destiny you know we make the choice it's
[1:12:04] the goodness of God that lead us to
[1:12:05] repentance it's his goodness no man can
[1:12:09] come to the Father but by me right all
[1:12:12] that the father has given me will come
[1:12:13] and all that come to me I'll no wise
[1:12:15] cast out so if you make it a session
[1:12:17] Lord I come to you he won't cast you out
[1:12:20] he won't say no you not welcome he'll
[1:12:22] say come in hallelujah and we should
[1:12:24] have the same kind of heart where it
[1:12:26] says in the end of the book of
[1:12:27] Revelation the Spirit of the bride say
[1:12:29] come
[1:12:29] who's ever thirst come and that's why we
[1:12:32] shouldn't be like with the protocole son
[1:12:34] and you know the other son is not happy
[1:12:36] that the protocol has returned we should
[1:12:39] be rejoicing I mean we should have our
[1:12:41] joy bells off and when we see someone
[1:12:42] come to the Lord that should be our
[1:12:44] heart come it's worth it it's a great
[1:12:46] decision
[1:12:47] you'll receive eternal life you receive
[1:12:49] walking with God in this world freedom
[1:12:51] of sin and every freedom of this flesh
[1:12:53] everything Alleluia you will it'll be
[1:12:56] worth it it is worth it now God
[1:12:59] so Satan made a decision in the
[1:13:02] beginning but before that God made his
[1:13:04] own decision hallelujah then we'll come
[1:13:07] down to us again season revelations 13
[1:13:14] and 8 that we quoted before and all that
[1:13:18] dwell upon the earth shall worship Him
[1:13:19] which is the Beast whose name was not
[1:13:21] written in the book of life of the lamb
[1:13:22] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:13:25] so before there was anything
[1:13:27] the lamb was slain in God's mind he had
[1:13:29] already made away glory I mean hidden he
[1:13:32] had made away for the names in the book
[1:13:34] and I trust you can say I'm written in
[1:13:37] that book of life
[1:13:38] that's why I've received him in the
[1:13:40] South because my name is written there
[1:13:42] hallelujah amen so now but then Satan
[1:13:46] also made his own decision he Lucifer
[1:13:49] was once the anointed cherub that
[1:13:51] covereth he was the worship leader in
[1:13:53] heaven right he was he was you could say
[1:13:57] God's right-hand man sees in Ezekiel 28
[1:14:02] from verse 11 where over the word Lord
[1:14:05] came unto me saying son of man take up a
[1:14:07] lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and
[1:14:10] say unto Him thus saith the Lord now
[1:14:12] this lamentation upon the king of Tyrus
[1:14:14] is actually speaking of the anointing
[1:14:15] upon the king right thus saith the Lord
[1:14:19] God seal us up the son full of wisdom
[1:14:21] and perfect in beauty thou has been and
[1:14:24] eat in the garden of God every precious
[1:14:25] stone was thy covering the the saddest
[1:14:29] the topes and the diamond the barrel the
[1:14:31] ox and the jasper the sapphire emerald
[1:14:33] and the carbuncle the gold the
[1:14:35] workmanship of our tablets and of our
[1:14:37] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[1:14:39] thou was created thou art the anointed
[1:14:41] cherub that covereth
[1:14:42] I have set thee so that was upon the
[1:14:45] holy mountain of God but me thou hast
[1:14:47] walked up and down in the midst of the
[1:14:49] stones of fire that was perfectly in my
[1:14:51] ways from the day they was created till
[1:14:54] iniquity was found in thee by the
[1:14:56] multitude of thy merchandise as they
[1:14:58] have filled the midst of thee with
[1:14:59] violence thou has sinned therefore all
[1:15:02] Cassy as profane out of the mountain of
[1:15:04] God and I'll destroy the Oh covering
[1:15:06] cherub from the midst of the stones of
[1:15:08] fire thy heart was lifted up because of
[1:15:10] thy beauty that was corrupted thy wisdom
[1:15:13] by reason of their brightness
[1:15:15] I will cast to the ground old lady
[1:15:19] before kings that they may behold thee
[1:15:21] thou has two Father thy sanctuaries by
[1:15:24] the multitude of their iniquities by the
[1:15:26] iniquity of thy traffic therefore I will
[1:15:28] bring for the fire from the midst of
[1:15:30] thee it shall devour thee and I will
[1:15:32] bring thee to ashes upon the earth in
[1:15:33] the sight of all them that behold thee
[1:15:35] all they that know the among the people
[1:15:38] shall be astonished at thee thou shalt
[1:15:40] be at
[1:15:40] Kirra and never shall there be anymore
[1:15:44] so God is saying that this this this
[1:15:50] this devil we fight he was once the
[1:15:53] anointed cherub that covereth but he
[1:15:56] made a decision one day based on his
[1:15:58] appearance based on what God had made
[1:16:00] him and he thought he's a bit more
[1:16:01] bitter than anyone else
[1:16:02] in heaven and then he came to a
[1:16:04] conclusion I can do this better I can
[1:16:07] make a better Kingdom right I could have
[1:16:09] a better worship and it season
[1:16:11] I'm Isaiah 14 that this one says I'll be
[1:16:15] like the Most High so I'll be God this
[1:16:17] is what he was he made a decision he
[1:16:20] made the wrong decision right
[1:16:22] God knew it would happen God wasn't
[1:16:24] surprised when there was a civil war in
[1:16:25] heaven and he was cast out he wasn't
[1:16:27] surprised he knew was going to happen
[1:16:28] but he made the wrong decision and we
[1:16:34] are under the result of that decision
[1:16:37] today this world is right God but when
[1:16:42] God makes a decision but God also made a
[1:16:44] decision and God's decision is his word
[1:16:47] right and God doesn't change his
[1:16:50] decision when God speaks forth his word
[1:16:53] he doesn't change it later he doesn't he
[1:16:57] he doesn't add you know sub-clauses and
[1:16:59] clauses and amendments to his word he
[1:17:02] just puts his word forth amen
[1:17:05] and he doesn't change it God doesn't hit
[1:17:07] yo God's thoughts you know he doesn't
[1:17:10] change his thinking like we do you know
[1:17:12] we can look at something make a decision
[1:17:14] come back later maybe we've learned some
[1:17:16] more and then we look at it again and we
[1:17:18] change our mind God doesn't change his
[1:17:19] mind
[1:17:20] I mean God is God's mind you could say
[1:17:22] is set in stone and and it it's his word
[1:17:25] I mean you see now anytime that God has
[1:17:29] ever called on the scene to make a
[1:17:30] decision when he makes a decision it has
[1:17:32] to be forever be his same decision now
[1:17:35] remember he cannot change his mind
[1:17:36] because he's perfect you believe God's
[1:17:39] perfect you believe he's infinite
[1:17:40] certainly he's infinite well if he's
[1:17:42] infant at the end he can't learn anymore
[1:17:43] now we are finite we just keep on
[1:17:46] learning and take this back and add
[1:17:47] something more and take away but God
[1:17:49] can't see he's perfect every decision is
[1:17:52] perfect so we must always remember keep
[1:17:54] your
[1:17:54] mine's and Heights on his word right
[1:17:57] amen he says now if God ever makes a
[1:18:01] decision ever called to make a decision
[1:18:03] in God's decision he being infinite he
[1:18:06] has to continually stay with that
[1:18:08] decision right so what he declares in
[1:18:11] his word he cannot change right and on
[1:18:14] the day of Pentecost the prescription
[1:18:16] was given to heal the world of sin and
[1:18:19] dr. Simon Peter stood up with his
[1:18:23] neurology degree hallelujah and and they
[1:18:27] asked him good doctor what shall we do
[1:18:28] that we can be saved we see that we've
[1:18:31] got the sin disease that we're actually
[1:18:33] born with how can we be cured and the
[1:18:35] good doctor picked up the script and he
[1:18:37] said repent to me baptize every one of
[1:18:39] you for the remission of sin and the
[1:18:41] name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:18:42] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost then
[1:18:45] they are and then he said I'll tell you
[1:18:46] how good the prescription is it's for
[1:18:48] you
[1:18:48] for your children for those that are far
[1:18:50] off even as many as the Lord our God
[1:18:52] shall call so people can be very a far
[1:18:55] off you can be a far off even sitting
[1:18:57] here your mind can be a million miles
[1:18:58] away it's good for you too hallelujah
[1:19:01] and God doesn't change his method if he
[1:19:04] saves man one yo-yo if he saves man by
[1:19:07] faith by the blood of Jesus Christ gives
[1:19:10] them the Holy Ghost by coming guys
[1:19:12] provided way he'll do it for the second
[1:19:14] man he'll do it for the third person
[1:19:15] he'll do it for everyone who will
[1:19:17] believe amen and so the problem is a lot
[1:19:20] of people are handing out there's a lot
[1:19:22] of quack doctors out there handing out
[1:19:24] the wrong script there's only one script
[1:19:26] that's the gods provided way God doesn't
[1:19:29] change his mind about his word right God
[1:19:32] doesn't change his mind
[1:19:34] amen that's why we want to make our
[1:19:36] decisions based on his word hallelujah
[1:19:39] it means that God doesn't change his
[1:19:42] word for culture doesn't change his word
[1:19:44] because men yo you know the world
[1:19:47] becomes modern society changes God
[1:19:49] doesn't change his word it has stayed
[1:19:51] the same and it will produce the same
[1:19:53] results I mean that's why we've got to
[1:19:55] have a real Bible faith that's what this
[1:19:57] Misha's has seen to do is turn our
[1:19:59] hearts back to the faith of the Apostles
[1:20:01] that we have a Bible faith I'm in a
[1:20:03] Bible doctrine I'm in a Bible Holy Ghost
[1:20:06] I'm in a Bible read am sure
[1:20:08] hallelujah a Bible salvation that's what
[1:20:10] we have hallelujah I mean it worked for
[1:20:13] me I trust this work for you hallelujah
[1:20:16] when you read the book of Acts you see
[1:20:18] how God worked there you say hallelujah
[1:20:19] I know the same God Amy does the same
[1:20:22] thing hallelujah
[1:20:25] now the Bible is made the Bible is a
[1:20:29] record of decisions the Bible is a
[1:20:32] record of decisions we we yeah I just
[1:20:35] spoke of to God's decision
[1:20:38] Satan's decision that was before there
[1:20:40] was a world and now it's come down into
[1:20:43] time Adam and Eve made their decision
[1:20:45] God knew they'd make that decision Cain
[1:20:48] and Abel had to make a decision Cain's
[1:20:53] decision was what was made upon what he
[1:20:55] mentally knew he brought he brought
[1:20:58] you're the fruit of the fields Abel by
[1:21:01] faith offered a more excellent sacrifice
[1:21:03] than that of Cain because it was
[1:21:05] revealed to him it was blood right he
[1:21:08] with me so he made the right decision
[1:21:10] and in Cain rejected God's counsel
[1:21:13] killed his brother based on a decision
[1:21:15] and that decision was based on his
[1:21:17] nature he following me right and it's
[1:21:20] all the way down through the Bible
[1:21:22] decisions have been made you may say
[1:21:25] well that's very obvious but you got to
[1:21:27] look now people made their flesh and
[1:21:30] blood like you and I Noah made a
[1:21:32] decision one day God spoke to him what
[1:21:35] is he gonna do about it right he had to
[1:21:37] respond to the call he had to respond to
[1:21:40] the vision he saw he had to put he had
[1:21:43] to put hands and feet to his faith right
[1:21:45] he couldn't just say well God's going to
[1:21:47] destroy the world and well the Arkell if
[1:21:48] God really wants us safe then he's going
[1:21:50] to build it though he had to build it he
[1:21:53] had to actually not just talk about it's
[1:21:54] very easy to talk about God right but
[1:21:57] when you actually put your hands upon
[1:21:59] the word and actually take the promise
[1:22:01] for yourself
[1:22:01] that's when criticism comes up I mean
[1:22:04] that's when the persecution rises when
[1:22:06] you put your hands on the word for
[1:22:07] yourself that's when the trouble happens
[1:22:09] they meant you're maybe before he even
[1:22:12] built the ark now this is just me he
[1:22:14] he'd begin to talk to people this world
[1:22:16] is getting wicked amen brother Noah I
[1:22:18] believe it sure is look at this have you
[1:22:20] seen the stats and all the
[1:22:21] things that's getting worse and gods
[1:22:23] gods a God of judgment amen brother Noah
[1:22:25] I believe it God told me to build an ark
[1:22:28] he starts building it then the a means
[1:22:30] God but quieter the questions start
[1:22:33] rising hey what do you mean you're the
[1:22:35] only one who's got the way of escape
[1:22:36] what do you mean that this is going to
[1:22:38] happen God's a good god he wears this
[1:22:40] rain you speak of right and in the and
[1:22:44] in the a means turn into questions fit
[1:22:45] into persecution all these things but
[1:22:47] Noah made a decision that God had showed
[1:22:51] him the way of escape and he was going
[1:22:53] to stick until they dock was built and
[1:22:55] he was going to stick with it till ever
[1:22:58] um that was going to be saved was in
[1:22:59] there right he was he made a decision
[1:23:02] I'm following this vision right he
[1:23:05] didn't have a he didn't have a favorite
[1:23:06] preacher to scream at him every whenever
[1:23:08] he downloaded me to never leave one
[1:23:09] hundred sermons he didn't have a Bible
[1:23:11] to read like we do he had a vision from
[1:23:13] God and and his decision was I'm
[1:23:16] following this decision doesn't matter
[1:23:18] who follows doesn't matter who agrees
[1:23:20] disagrees whatever more I'm following
[1:23:22] this decision amen
[1:23:24] Moses made a decision one day he was he
[1:23:29] was going to be the next king of Oh next
[1:23:31] Pharaoh he could have been the next
[1:23:33] Pharaoh but God moved in his heart his
[1:23:36] mother wrote raised him up in pharaoh's
[1:23:39] palace and I believe she would have
[1:23:41] poured into him Moses your father and I
[1:23:45] have been praying before you're born we
[1:23:48] prayed we called upon God because we saw
[1:23:50] the promise was drawing nigh that we'd
[1:23:52] go to the promised land and someone
[1:23:54] would have to become a deliverer and we
[1:23:56] prayed Lord bring him fulfill your word
[1:23:59] hallelujah and then we by faith saw you
[1:24:02] a proper child something moved in us
[1:24:04] know the Egyptians aren't going to kill
[1:24:06] you they're not going to throw you in
[1:24:08] the Nile that you'll be crocodile food
[1:24:10] and then we hit you we're to burden we
[1:24:13] put you in the sack we felt moved hey
[1:24:15] they didn't have us they just felt you
[1:24:17] gotta be moved by inspiration yeah but
[1:24:19] you'll see it's in the scripture I mean
[1:24:21] there's a you know your inspirations
[1:24:22] right you see it in the word hallelujah
[1:24:24] and then they put him in the Ark sit him
[1:24:27] down on the crocodile fish the Nile God
[1:24:29] guided him down there to Pharaoh's
[1:24:31] Palace and
[1:24:33] and then his sisters following and then
[1:24:36] you know a Pharaoh's daughter picks him
[1:24:38] up we need a nurse she comes out of the
[1:24:40] bushes I know what how convenient
[1:24:44] hallelujah don't tell me God don't know
[1:24:48] how to orchestrate things hallelujah and
[1:24:50] then and then now here's now this Prince
[1:24:52] of Egypt
[1:24:53] he's like a terrorist he's like a
[1:24:56] sleeper cell hallelujah sitting in
[1:24:58] Spiros palace and his mother's pouring
[1:25:00] into him you gonna do it
[1:25:02] you love me you gonna be the one
[1:25:04] hallelujah you see your brethren out
[1:25:07] there you're not gonna stay slaves
[1:25:09] you're the one God's gonna come I don't
[1:25:11] know how he's going to do it but he
[1:25:12] promised he's going to do it
[1:25:13] hallelujah and Farrah and then Moses had
[1:25:15] to make a decision am I gonna stay here
[1:25:17] or am I going to follow and brother
[1:25:20] Brown said Pharaoh and Moses when they
[1:25:22] looked out upon the Israelite slaves
[1:25:23] Pharaoh saw slaves Moses saw God's
[1:25:27] people and that moved in his heart
[1:25:30] something has to be done hallelujah I
[1:25:34] mean so he forsook the riches of Egypt
[1:25:36] he left the superpower of the world of
[1:25:39] that time followed Christ into the
[1:25:41] desert hallelujah esteemed let's read
[1:25:44] that let's go to Hebrews 11 let's read
[1:25:47] the shall we uh you know I've decided to
[1:25:52] follow Jesus why would you turn back why
[1:25:56] would you turn back amen let's go to
[1:25:59] Hebrews 11 23 you know I was thinking
[1:26:03] last night yo Hebrews 11 we call it the
[1:26:06] faith chapter you can also call it the
[1:26:08] decision chapter hallelujah Amen by
[1:26:12] faith Moses when he was born was hid
[1:26:14] three months of his parents because they
[1:26:16] saw he was a proper child and they were
[1:26:18] not afraid of the Kings commandment by
[1:26:20] faith Moses when he was come of years
[1:26:22] refused to be called the son of
[1:26:24] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:26:26] suffer affliction with the people of God
[1:26:28] that enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:26:30] season he made a decision esteeming the
[1:26:33] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[1:26:35] the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:26:37] respect and to recompense of the reward
[1:26:39] by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[1:26:42] the wrath of the King for he endured SC
[1:26:46] him who's invisible through faith he
[1:26:48] kept the Passover in the sprinkling of
[1:26:50] blood at least he that destroyed the
[1:26:52] firstborn should touch them I mean by
[1:26:54] faith they passed through the Red Sea as
[1:26:56] dry land which the Egyptians sa to do
[1:26:58] were drowned a minute so he esteemed
[1:27:01] this is why we read in the beginning we
[1:27:04] walk by faith and not by sight look real
[1:27:06] decisions are made by faith looking to
[1:27:09] the unseen right so Moses esteemed right
[1:27:14] he esteemed the reproach of Christ
[1:27:15] greater riches than the treasures in
[1:27:17] Egypt now human that you think but Moses
[1:27:20] you become fairer than you can just hit
[1:27:21] them free here the powder duty is God
[1:27:24] and the you know you're the Pharaoh was
[1:27:26] considered God in the nation he was the
[1:27:28] god of the nation right he could have
[1:27:31] said now you all go free and and he
[1:27:33] coulda seen tanaami before them and
[1:27:34] drove out everyone and then put them in
[1:27:36] the land he could have done it that way
[1:27:38] but we shouldn't make decisions based on
[1:27:40] our cattle understanding right we make
[1:27:42] our decisions based on the Word of God
[1:27:44] so now Moses Moses made a decision
[1:27:49] but then that but then there in in Moses
[1:27:53] day there was a another prophet called
[1:27:54] Balaam and he made the wrong decision he
[1:27:58] wanted money
[1:27:58] he loved money he sold his gift to the
[1:28:01] Moabites right and he ended up dead he
[1:28:05] ended up being an enemy of God a prophet
[1:28:07] with a true gift
[1:28:08] sold it for money he sold it he make the
[1:28:12] wrong decision but his nature was I love
[1:28:15] money I love shiny things right and so
[1:28:18] he sold out he made the wrong decision
[1:28:20] Korah and Dathan made the wrong decision
[1:28:23] they rose up against Moses you're not
[1:28:25] the only holy one in the group God
[1:28:26] speaks to us too and God swallowed them
[1:28:28] up the earth he opened the earth had
[1:28:30] swallowed them up they make the wrong
[1:28:32] decision Caleb and Joshua made the right
[1:28:34] decision hallelujah they didn't look at
[1:28:36] the enemies in the land as an obstacle
[1:28:39] they just looked them in the way you
[1:28:41] know they didn't say we can't take it
[1:28:42] because of them they said no God's given
[1:28:44] it God's given it our decision is based
[1:28:46] on the promise that we heard of Mount
[1:28:47] Sinai and if God can take us out of
[1:28:49] Egypt to Sinai he can take us in
[1:28:51] hallelujah there was the decision God's
[1:28:54] promised it
[1:28:55] we believe it let's go get it
[1:28:58] it should be the same thing with us
[1:28:59] God's promise that we believe it let's
[1:29:02] go get it I mean if he if the devil's
[1:29:04] taking your joy God's promise that you
[1:29:06] believe it
[1:29:07] go get it your peace your long-suffering
[1:29:09] but it might be the Holy Ghost amen you
[1:29:13] know your Jesus gives a parable of you
[1:29:16] know you know you asked your fathers for
[1:29:18] brandy won't give you a serpent you know
[1:29:20] all these yo as if they being evil know
[1:29:22] how to give good gifts how much more
[1:29:24] your father in heaven which will give
[1:29:26] the Holy Ghost them that ask him he goes
[1:29:29] down to that promise have you read that
[1:29:30] in the in the Gospels hallelu this way
[1:29:33] you've got ours you know make a decision
[1:29:34] Lord well and me use my life I haven't
[1:29:38] used these hands use these eyes users
[1:29:40] mouth use this body to manifest you
[1:29:42] hallelujah there should be that's the
[1:29:44] best decision amen so Caleb and Joshua
[1:29:49] made the right decision
[1:29:51] you know it's amazing we look at a many
[1:29:54] times we will look at what you know the
[1:29:56] we will look at the circumstance and we
[1:30:00] will praise God
[1:30:01] based or we won't praise and based on
[1:30:03] circumstance right we should never do
[1:30:06] that I mean we should praise God in
[1:30:09] spite of the circumstance
[1:30:10] our God our life our worship to God
[1:30:13] should be solely based on the promise
[1:30:15] not on what we see right a not on what
[1:30:19] we see but what well God's promises we
[1:30:21] read in Romans 4 Abraham made a right
[1:30:26] promise I mean it mean sorry the right
[1:30:28] decision God spoke to him leave this
[1:30:30] place and Canley he could think but
[1:30:33] there's all I know but no he made a
[1:30:35] decision I've heard the voice of God I'm
[1:30:37] following that voice he didn't have a
[1:30:39] Bible he didn't have Church to go to he
[1:30:42] was being led by the Spirit of God and
[1:30:44] he walked amen according to faith right
[1:30:47] and then he was well old up in age and
[1:30:50] it was impossible for him and Sarah to
[1:30:52] have the child did he start think you
[1:30:56] know was he quiet well one day we'll get
[1:30:58] it no he staggered not at the promise of
[1:31:00] God through unbelief but was strong in
[1:31:03] faith giving glory to God being fully
[1:31:05] persuaded that he was that what he had
[1:31:07] promised he was able to perform so
[1:31:11] Abraham for 25 years of saying
[1:31:13] hallelujah Isaac's on his way the next
[1:31:16] day hallelujah
[1:31:17] Isaac's on his way you feel any
[1:31:19] different Sarah and I feel the same
[1:31:21] hallelujah
[1:31:22] Isaac's on his way hallelujah and he was
[1:31:24] just praising God thanking him god
[1:31:26] inhabits the praise of his people I mean
[1:31:28] you want to see God move in your life
[1:31:30] begin to praise Him I mean you want to
[1:31:32] see victories happened praise them in
[1:31:34] the victory I mean give him thanks
[1:31:35] hallelujah just praise them before you
[1:31:37] see the victory that's what we're going
[1:31:39] to do we can't just sit back and say
[1:31:41] well I'll only be happy when he moves
[1:31:43] not be happy before you move wholly
[1:31:45] because you're really showing God do you
[1:31:47] take me at my word and you and you'll
[1:31:49] say yes I am
[1:31:50] by how I'm living I'm showing you I take
[1:31:52] you at your word hallelujah amen that's
[1:31:57] how we've got to beat amen Abraham
[1:31:59] praise them for 25 years and one day
[1:32:01] Sarah I think got a bit sick and tired
[1:32:03] of it I can't do the same take Haggai
[1:32:08] she made the wrong decision but God said
[1:32:12] no it's all part of my plan anyway but
[1:32:15] she had to receive a visitation Abraham
[1:32:18] had his visitation right he had had it
[1:32:21] numerous times over 25 years but then
[1:32:24] Sarah had to meet the same God that he
[1:32:26] knew and that's how it has to be in
[1:32:28] order to make the right decision you've
[1:32:30] got to meet him and he will guide your
[1:32:32] steps par lujah and then that then there
[1:32:36] on the plains of Mamre and then three
[1:32:38] men came walking hallelujah and and
[1:32:41] Abraham saw one of them and you know
[1:32:43] that one of them was God because he met
[1:32:44] him before
[1:32:45] hallelujah they began to have a
[1:32:47] conversation and that was Sarah's
[1:32:49] visitation hallelujah he followed me Amy
[1:32:53] and then she began to believe the
[1:32:55] promise but a brain for 25 years
[1:32:57] hallelujah Isaac's coming get ready get
[1:33:02] the nursery ready
[1:33:02] he's coming abre oh you you changed your
[1:33:07] name to Abraham father of Nations
[1:33:09] how convenient but where's the children
[1:33:11] they're coming many people say you made
[1:33:13] he he's been out in the Sun the old
[1:33:15] man's lost his mind and the Sun too long
[1:33:18] but he was strong I mean in faith giving
[1:33:23] glory to God
[1:33:24] fully persuaded that he was he would do
[1:33:26] what he had promised hallelujah that's
[1:33:29] why we should praise the Lord
[1:33:30] I mean before the victory comes we
[1:33:32] should just begin to go thank him he's
[1:33:34] promised that in his word who say Lord
[1:33:36] it's on its way
[1:33:37] holy the promise is on its way I mean
[1:33:40] one of the Kings I think it was
[1:33:41] Jehoshaphat the enemy came against him
[1:33:43] and the and and so so they called a
[1:33:46] prayer and a fast I think it's in
[1:33:48] seeking Chronicles and God said no I'll
[1:33:51] fight the battle you just go but I'll
[1:33:54] fight the battle and and he sent singers
[1:33:56] before singers before hallelujah and the
[1:33:59] and God said ambushment against the
[1:34:01] enemy and they didn't they didn't have
[1:34:04] to go fight that they still went out
[1:34:06] there but the singers went before the
[1:34:07] army and then when they got to the
[1:34:09] battlefield they found a lot of enemies
[1:34:11] but they're all dead
[1:34:12] hallelujah is because praise went before
[1:34:15] the army right praise went for praise
[1:34:18] and singing we're before hallelujah
[1:34:20] that's why I say you want to see your
[1:34:21] enemy defeated you just praise God you
[1:34:23] give him thanks it's more than just an
[1:34:25] emotion but from your heart Lord I
[1:34:27] believe your promise you're here to
[1:34:29] perform what I need hallelujah
[1:34:31] the enemies come against me but he will
[1:34:32] not stand hallelujah that's why you
[1:34:34] gotta get start thanking him don'tdon't
[1:34:36] doubt
[1:34:37] I've been don't doubt the promise how
[1:34:38] can this ever be say thank you for the
[1:34:40] promise Amen thank you for my children
[1:34:42] thank you for those people thank you for
[1:34:44] healing
[1:34:44] thank you for salvation that's what
[1:34:46] we're going to do you say but they are
[1:34:48] far off the Bible said the Holy Ghost is
[1:34:50] didn't that are far off hallelujah I
[1:34:53] mean and if he's given you the Holy
[1:34:55] Ghost and the promises for them to be
[1:34:57] following me the promises to you them
[1:34:59] that are afar off to your children as
[1:35:02] many as the Lord our God shall call so I
[1:35:04] think it's parents we should say thank
[1:35:05] you look I've received the Holy Ghost of
[1:35:07] promises for my children hallelujah
[1:35:10] hallelujah to God I mean those that are
[1:35:13] far off hey they can be the prodigal son
[1:35:15] made a decision he made a decision one
[1:35:18] day dad I'm sick of working here give me
[1:35:22] my inheritance now I want to lead my own
[1:35:24] life and then the father said sure do
[1:35:27] you think the father wasn't because
[1:35:29] Jesus need a certain man and a certain
[1:35:32] man had two sons so he's actually
[1:35:33] identifying actual circumstance right do
[1:35:37] you think that that father was
[1:35:38] joy sing here you go son here's your
[1:35:39] inheritance hallelujah to God go spend
[1:35:42] it no he would have been burdened you
[1:35:45] following me
[1:35:45] these are real people to me right and so
[1:35:48] he gives the inheritance he made the
[1:35:50] wrong decision but the ends of the
[1:35:52] Father now he knew his son would go that
[1:35:56] way God knows the way we go right we
[1:36:00] think we have it all together with a
[1:36:02] master of our own suing us
[1:36:03] God knows the road you'll go right he he
[1:36:06] knows what you're thinking even now
[1:36:08] hallelujah you know many times you think
[1:36:11] well though I'll just be a will to
[1:36:12] myself and I'll just keep drooling here
[1:36:13] and it's like a megaphone to heaven
[1:36:15] you know our thoughts speak louder and
[1:36:18] heaven than our words on earth right and
[1:36:20] then so now the prodigal son goes off
[1:36:22] and he spends his money with your
[1:36:24] riotous living thinking he's having a
[1:36:26] wonderful time but then he comes to
[1:36:29] himself in a pigpen
[1:36:30] and he made the right decision you
[1:36:34] following me I mean this is more than a
[1:36:36] story I mean but sometimes we have to
[1:36:38] hit rock bottom sometimes we've got to
[1:36:40] have our back maybe in a hospital bed or
[1:36:42] something for God to get yo I'm
[1:36:44] listening now hallelujah because our own
[1:36:47] stubborn fallen nature will take us a
[1:36:49] certain way and it's always the wrong
[1:36:51] way right and then so the prodigal son
[1:36:53] comes to he says and then he came to
[1:36:55] himself in the Pigpen
[1:36:56] saying my father's servants have more
[1:36:58] than this if only I just become one of
[1:37:00] his servants and all will be well and so
[1:37:02] it begins to make his way back home and
[1:37:04] it says when the father saw him afar off
[1:37:06] do you think that father wasn't praying
[1:37:09] do you think he just said well send me
[1:37:11] an email or send me a text when you
[1:37:13] arrive you know send me a selfie with no
[1:37:15] he was praised hallelujah this this
[1:37:19] father was praying and he was under
[1:37:21] expectation and one day they pray
[1:37:23] through hallelujah and they had a
[1:37:26] something settled on their souls he's
[1:37:28] coming home Johnny's coming home
[1:37:30] hallelujah and they begin to look and
[1:37:33] the father kept looking you see thank
[1:37:34] you lord my son will come thank you Lord
[1:37:36] my son will come hallelujah this is the
[1:37:39] current yes he's in the Book of Isaiah
[1:37:40] this is the coven I'll make with you
[1:37:42] that my word will not depart out of the
[1:37:44] mouth of thy seed of thy seed seed from
[1:37:46] henceforth forever hallelujah that means
[1:37:48] they've got to come back
[1:37:50] are you following me and then so he was
[1:37:52] watching then the son comes home he made
[1:37:54] the right decision
[1:37:56] hallelujah and then the father restored
[1:37:59] the son back to where he was amen
[1:38:02] because he says to his other son who was
[1:38:04] unhappy he stayed he says dad why are
[1:38:07] you having this party for you know I've
[1:38:09] been working all this time he's just
[1:38:11] been living living like the devil in the
[1:38:13] world and now you're happy he's back and
[1:38:15] as in the father hizdahr all this is
[1:38:18] yours
[1:38:18] he was once did now he's alive
[1:38:21] hallelujah
[1:38:22] amen so he came to himself and he made
[1:38:25] the right decision now the apostles were
[1:38:29] like men like us right the Bible would
[1:38:33] call them ignorant unlearned
[1:38:37] some of them couldn't sign their own
[1:38:39] name that's all right right but when the
[1:38:43] pressure came down see God God knows how
[1:38:46] to put us on the spot but he's not he's
[1:38:49] not trying to prove you wrong he's
[1:38:51] trying to prove what's in you and you
[1:38:53] can look back in life and say Lord it
[1:38:56] was your grace only that I made those
[1:38:57] choices right it's only you did it it
[1:39:01] wasn't me and what I thought of my
[1:39:03] perception my understanding it's you
[1:39:04] that kept me right and then son John
[1:39:07] chapter 6 when Jesus is having you know
[1:39:09] he starts with 5,000 he preaches a very
[1:39:12] short service and after the surface is
[1:39:14] finished under the disciples are
[1:39:16] standing next to him and he says to them
[1:39:18] as disciples will you also go away and
[1:39:21] Simon Peter answered Lord to whom shall
[1:39:23] we go thou has the words of eternal life
[1:39:26] see he couldn't he you know maybe they
[1:39:30] were suddenly say oh don't say that
[1:39:32] Jesus aw now he's going to answer right
[1:39:35] now he's going to make it clear he
[1:39:36] doesn't make it clear he just put it out
[1:39:38] there and that was it and then said now
[1:39:40] here were these ones they had to make a
[1:39:41] decision they made the right decision
[1:39:44] right because heaven was influencing
[1:39:46] them I mean to make the right decision
[1:39:49] he says and we believe in a sure that
[1:39:50] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[1:39:53] Living God hallelujah they made the
[1:39:56] right decision
[1:40:00] amen
[1:40:01] we need to look to the unseen
[1:40:03] now we read about Ruth in the beginning
[1:40:07] it's incredible he's a woman all she
[1:40:11] seemed so Naomi and her husband and two
[1:40:15] sons coming to my web prices at time
[1:40:19] happens
[1:40:19] Ruth marries one of the sons or four
[1:40:21] marries the other son and then all the
[1:40:23] men in the family die and then now his
[1:40:27] Ruth you know know me here is that
[1:40:30] there's grain back in Israel the famines
[1:40:31] end of this grain back so she's I'm
[1:40:33] gonna return something I know said I'm
[1:40:35] going with you right she made she didn't
[1:40:38] know where she was going
[1:40:39] right she didn't know where what was
[1:40:41] going to befall her in that foreign land
[1:40:43] they were enemies Israel and Moab were
[1:40:46] enemies right but room something in her
[1:40:49] said your people now remember she saw a
[1:40:51] testimony all of us are a billboard for
[1:40:54] something you are God's billboard or
[1:40:56] you're the world's billboard
[1:40:57] what are you advertising your life is a
[1:40:59] billboard you say people don't notice me
[1:41:02] people notice us what are we advertising
[1:41:04] worth with how we treat people you know
[1:41:06] how we speak to people are we friendly
[1:41:08] you know are we loving are we kind are
[1:41:11] we thoughtful right what kind of life we
[1:41:14] producing and so now she saw know him
[1:41:17] his life
[1:41:18] and all she sees his death and misery
[1:41:20] really that's all she saw and she was
[1:41:23] part of that death and misery because
[1:41:24] her husband died in now knowing he says
[1:41:26] well I'm gonna go home and something
[1:41:28] interested I'm going with you she made a
[1:41:31] clear-cut decision where you die all die
[1:41:32] she burned every Bridge where you die
[1:41:35] all die your people be my people your
[1:41:36] God will be my god she doesn't she
[1:41:39] doesn't know what she was going to
[1:41:41] hallelujah but she made she was looking
[1:41:44] something moved her to make the right
[1:41:46] decision I believe that was the Lord
[1:41:48] with all my heart I mean she made a
[1:41:51] decision based upon faith and not by
[1:41:53] what she saw her other sister-in-law
[1:41:55] looked at what she saw and went home and
[1:41:57] you don't read about her anymore
[1:41:58] but Ruth followed Naomi I mean in a
[1:42:01] sport short space of time she was no
[1:42:04] longer a widow with nothing but she was
[1:42:05] married to Boaz the mighty man of wealth
[1:42:07] and she came into the economy of Israel
[1:42:09] hallelujah Amen it's the same thing with
[1:42:12] us God calls you do you know where
[1:42:14] you're going you know when I first met
[1:42:16] the law
[1:42:16] there's a whole lot of things I didn't
[1:42:18] know hallelujah
[1:42:20] it's like Abraham God called him he
[1:42:22] didn't know the boundaries of the land
[1:42:24] he didn't know what was going to happen
[1:42:25] God just said leave thy country I'll
[1:42:27] show you another place and as God walked
[1:42:29] with him as he walked with God God
[1:42:32] unfolds the vision further right it's
[1:42:34] like us you know I meet the Lord I
[1:42:37] didn't have a great expectation for a
[1:42:39] body change I just made up my son's were
[1:42:42] washed away I became a new creature the
[1:42:44] things I once did I couldn't do because
[1:42:46] the nature of me was changed I couldn't
[1:42:48] do it anymore I didn't try and say well
[1:42:50] I've got to keep myself from things no
[1:42:51] if God takes a nature out of your desire
[1:42:53] for the world then you you're not going
[1:42:56] to want it
[1:42:57] hallelujah that's like being a kid now
[1:42:59] this is very elementary all the little
[1:43:02] children here do you love Brussels
[1:43:03] sprouts and broccoli maybe some of us
[1:43:08] still don't anyway but there comes a
[1:43:13] time I'll put it this way I say your
[1:43:15] nature changes from a child to an adult
[1:43:17] and you eat the things and you like them
[1:43:19] right but when you're kid you're I don't
[1:43:21] like this you know because your nature
[1:43:24] doesn't want it right but your nature
[1:43:26] changes and then you want it because you
[1:43:28] know it's good for you you following me
[1:43:30] that's like me with drinking or anything
[1:43:31] in the world feels the thirst in here
[1:43:34] but then it died and then then I could
[1:43:37] live in a brewery and I'll be the most
[1:43:38] sober man in the world because there's
[1:43:40] nothing in me that wants it all right
[1:43:42] you know there's not seven steps to
[1:43:44] protect yourself and overcome no God
[1:43:46] changes your nature and you overcome you
[1:43:48] can't help but overcome because he is in
[1:43:50] you greater is in you that he's in the
[1:43:52] world
[1:43:53] hallelujah isn't that right yes oh
[1:43:56] that's and that's how we should be amen
[1:43:59] Rebecca made her decision one day she's
[1:44:02] walking to the well like probably every
[1:44:04] other day or every day he's a man says
[1:44:08] can you give me a drink
[1:44:09] he's got a whole bunch of camels and
[1:44:11] something in her emergencies okay I'll
[1:44:14] give you water and I'll water your
[1:44:16] camels she has no idea this man's been
[1:44:18] praying sweating out to find character
[1:44:21] brother Brahim says and he prays Lord
[1:44:23] the maiden that comes and doesn't only
[1:44:25] give me a drink
[1:44:26] but waters my camels may she be the one
[1:44:29] I'm looking for
[1:44:30] she's looking he is looking for someone
[1:44:32] from Abraham's house a relative I don't
[1:44:37] think there was such an easy thing to do
[1:44:38] that's just me but the very one he prays
[1:44:40] and in the very answer to prayer Bakr
[1:44:42] comes walking out holy and then she
[1:44:45] doesn't know she should she doesn't know
[1:44:47] an Angels been sent to prepare her she
[1:44:51] doesn't know that an Angels being sent
[1:44:52] to prepare her heart that she'll come
[1:44:54] and marry this Isaac she has no idea
[1:44:56] about Isaac she's just living her life
[1:44:58] hallelujah and we were the same way you
[1:45:01] know we just hear this just wait and
[1:45:04] then in his Rebekah
[1:45:06] so she waters the camels gives gives um
[1:45:09] Eliezer a drink goes back to her house
[1:45:13] and then so her family says well where
[1:45:16] does the man go get him so here he comes
[1:45:18] along they sit down I began to have some
[1:45:20] fellowship where are you from I am I am
[1:45:22] Abraham's chief servant he said Oh what
[1:45:27] are you doing here he sent me on a
[1:45:28] mission I'm looking for a bride for my
[1:45:31] for for my master's son Isaac and
[1:45:34] Abraham said that his angel the angel
[1:45:36] Lord would go before him and will
[1:45:38] prepare her heart and are standing by
[1:45:40] the well and US pranks I don't know who
[1:45:41] I was looking for I said Lord the one
[1:45:43] who water it gives me water and what
[1:45:46] does my camels may she be the one and
[1:45:47] then Rebecca comes and she began to
[1:45:49] realize this is more than just me being
[1:45:52] helpful today
[1:45:52] hey you following me this is more than
[1:45:54] me just being helpful I'm actually part
[1:45:56] of a fulfilled prayer I'm part of a
[1:45:58] vision I'm actually part of the Word of
[1:46:01] God being fulfilled
[1:46:02] hallelujah it's because something moved
[1:46:04] in her eye water your camels or your
[1:46:06] thirsty or the if there's I'll help you
[1:46:08] camels drink a lot you know they don't
[1:46:10] just have a bit of a sip they drink
[1:46:12] there was a lot of work but something
[1:46:15] had moved in her I'll do it that was God
[1:46:17] guiding her decision may we be God in
[1:46:21] the same way and then now here she is
[1:46:23] she hears this and then Eliezer says
[1:46:26] well I found her I believe let's go and
[1:46:28] then as her family says you ask her
[1:46:32] something gunner says I'll go I'll go
[1:46:36] and you'd really think about it see
[1:46:39] you're going to this arranged marriage
[1:46:42] you never seen this guy you have no
[1:46:44] photos
[1:46:45] this guy just turned up and he claims to
[1:46:47] be the servant of Abraham's have you
[1:46:50] done a background check you know seem to
[1:46:53] text to someone someone may know him on
[1:46:55] Facebook somewhere you know how do you
[1:46:57] how do you know think about it she's
[1:47:00] following she's gonna jump on a camel
[1:47:02] with this guy and go to a land she
[1:47:04] doesn't know right and they say go with
[1:47:09] her now I asked you a question if one
[1:47:13] who has daughters here well I'm by the
[1:47:15] vast majority of them but what you some
[1:47:18] guy just pictures up some some some
[1:47:21] older guy and long lost lost lost
[1:47:24] relative or in those days it was okay
[1:47:27] that way my Master's son needs a wife
[1:47:30] and I came here I want to take you know
[1:47:33] and then I prayed and then this happened
[1:47:35] and you know she's the one would you
[1:47:38] scale your praise Lord go on
[1:47:39] you think naturally you wouldn't do it
[1:47:42] naturally right you do chicks you'd get
[1:47:44] on the phone you'd be finding out think
[1:47:47] about it we're we're people of like
[1:47:49] patient where we have Menem woman just
[1:47:51] like them but the decisions were move by
[1:47:53] it was God influence the decision right
[1:47:56] and I trust it's the same thing with you
[1:47:58] God calls you as he called you right
[1:48:01] more than just learning and more than
[1:48:03] just being raised in church God's got to
[1:48:05] speak to you personally I trust he's
[1:48:07] spoken to you called you and then you
[1:48:09] begin to find out it's more than just a
[1:48:10] haphazard thing but you're part of the
[1:48:12] family
[1:48:13] hallelujah cuz Rebecca was part of
[1:48:15] Isaac's family right and then so now
[1:48:17] there is a call and she was influenced
[1:48:19] by the call and you get moved by the
[1:48:21] word having an you says you mean this is
[1:48:23] Jesus in heaven I'm called to be united
[1:48:27] with him and his spirit is upon the
[1:48:29] earth finding his bride howling he
[1:48:32] seemed to serve it with all the gifts I
[1:48:33] mean to make sure she's fully furnished
[1:48:35] with everything she needs
[1:48:36] I mean to take her on her journey
[1:48:39] hallelujah amen keeping her to find out
[1:48:42] the age of the Lord is upon the earth
[1:48:44] finding his elected ones and you begin
[1:48:47] to find out I'm I'm one of them I'm one
[1:48:49] of them hallelujah so now
[1:48:55] you have to look at now I'm gonna I'm
[1:48:57] just gonna close with a little more but
[1:49:00] ask you the question what is influencing
[1:49:03] your decisions there is two powers upon
[1:49:05] the earth and they will even at a young
[1:49:08] age your decisions are being influenced
[1:49:10] right and you will find if as time goes
[1:49:13] on decisions you make even as a young
[1:49:15] person they will they will direct your
[1:49:19] path a certain way who's made decision
[1:49:21] in though young and you're still living
[1:49:22] at the result of that decision right
[1:49:25] if one every one of us did some of us
[1:49:28] said well let's move it to the other
[1:49:30] side of the world there was a decision
[1:49:31] and here you are right my dad moved from
[1:49:34] South Africa years ago he made a
[1:49:36] decision I'm gonna leave the country any
[1:49:38] and here he is I made a decision I'm
[1:49:41] going to Christchurch it seemed like
[1:49:43] such a small thing my friend said to me
[1:49:44] come studying come study go Canterbury
[1:49:47] University okay oh dude I just decided
[1:49:50] like that and there I was you know seems
[1:49:54] like small things but God you got to
[1:49:56] pray Lord guide my decisions because I
[1:49:59] do not know I can't guide myself it sees
[1:50:02] in Jeremiah he says O Lord I know it's
[1:50:05] not within man should we find that
[1:50:07] should we they put me on the spot I put
[1:50:09] myself on the spot but let's go to
[1:50:13] Jeremiah I'll find it then I'll tell you
[1:50:19] where it is it loves the Lord the
[1:50:21] sporting I'm so glad we can be guided by
[1:50:24] his by his voice I mean so here we are
[1:50:32] Jeremiah 10:23 we just close with the
[1:50:39] scripture Jeremiah 10 and 23 and
[1:50:43] Jeremiah was very much I think he's very
[1:50:46] aware of this he had a vision that the
[1:50:49] Babylonian is going to come and destroy
[1:50:50] the country and the people weren't
[1:50:53] listening to him because they won't do
[1:50:56] their own thing it sees in Jeremiah 10
[1:50:58] in 23 oh lord I know that the way of man
[1:51:00] is not in himself it is not in man that
[1:51:04] walketh to direct his steps right so
[1:51:08] Jeremiah was very honest he says Lord I
[1:51:10] know it's not within us to direct our
[1:51:11] steps it's not within us that's why we
[1:51:14] need someone else graded us to guide our
[1:51:16] decisions right to guide our path we
[1:51:19] can't just say well I'll make up my
[1:51:21] choice and this is what I want to do
[1:51:22] when he say Lord guide my decisions not
[1:51:26] my will but thy will be done that's the
[1:51:29] greatest victory you could have in life
[1:51:30] where you surrender your will to the
[1:51:32] Lord Jesus Christ the word and let him
[1:51:35] direct your steps then you'll have
[1:51:36] victory in life right but if you go your
[1:51:39] own way well I've got my life before me
[1:51:41] I'll do what I want I mean you'll end up
[1:51:43] like the protocol son
[1:51:45] amen but it's the Lord's great but you
[1:51:48] don't want to end up that way why have
[1:51:50] why why walk down a road and come back
[1:51:53] you got to carry a bunch of scars right
[1:51:56] you can't push the theory's button you
[1:51:59] can't push the erase button in here your
[1:52:01] memory remembers right it's part of you
[1:52:04] amen God gives you overcoming power of
[1:52:07] those things but you still carry them
[1:52:08] hallelujah that's like the earth the
[1:52:11] earth has great scars right
[1:52:13] you can drive along you see where where
[1:52:15] the Earth's crust is lifted up who's
[1:52:17] seen a great big cliffs and you see all
[1:52:19] the cedar must be put you know you can
[1:52:20] see the rock you know it changes color
[1:52:22] you see it's been pushed up great big
[1:52:24] massive earthquakes and things the earth
[1:52:25] carries scars right and it carries these
[1:52:29] things that still you could say within
[1:52:30] its memory one day won't carry those
[1:52:33] scars no more one day it's going to be
[1:52:35] be made new right and it's like us we're
[1:52:38] now in our memories we can still carry
[1:52:41] great emotional scars amen right we do
[1:52:45] whether we like it or not we see things
[1:52:47] we don't want to see we experience
[1:52:49] things that we never wanted to
[1:52:50] experience and we carry great scars
[1:52:52] because of them right and that's why we
[1:52:55] need a new body hello Lou that's why
[1:52:58] we're going to receive a new body right
[1:53:00] but we carry those scars and times only
[1:53:02] think lord I wish I never went that way
[1:53:04] right but you've got to come with peace
[1:53:06] with yourself Lord even in my own folly
[1:53:09] you allowed me to go that way amen but
[1:53:13] why go get the skies when you don't need
[1:53:15] them if some souvenirs you don't want to
[1:53:18] get right and scars from the world as
[1:53:21] you don't want so you've got to say Lord
[1:53:23] I want to make the right decisions right
[1:53:26] Lord guide my decisions and may make my
[1:53:29] nature be your nature I don't want to I
[1:53:33] don't want to repent just because I've
[1:53:34] done wrong I want to really repent that
[1:53:36] you don't just forgive me but you
[1:53:38] changed my nature that I don't fall back
[1:53:39] into the same sin right like I've said
[1:53:42] about the man like a man who's fallen
[1:53:43] into debt and a rich man comes and pays
[1:53:46] off the debt now that man who who wasn't
[1:53:50] it and that's been paid off he can be
[1:53:53] thankful that it's been paid but unless
[1:53:55] his nature has changed he can fall into
[1:53:57] the same debt right and that's like us
[1:54:00] the Lord justifies us we're justified by
[1:54:02] faith but we still carry the same nature
[1:54:05] right that's a start of the walk right
[1:54:07] but then he's got to cleanse us right
[1:54:09] it's got to wash us change our spirit
[1:54:11] change our desires right but then we can
[1:54:14] still fall into the same debt are you
[1:54:16] following me but then if he himself
[1:54:18] comes and dwells in us just like the
[1:54:21] spirit if the spirit of that rich man
[1:54:23] went to the winds of the man who wasn't
[1:54:25] dead that man wouldn't fall into debt
[1:54:27] again because he has the spirit of that
[1:54:28] rich man right it's the same thing with
[1:54:30] the Lord at the Spirit of God comes into
[1:54:32] us and not just only changes but now he
[1:54:35] takes control we won't fall into the
[1:54:37] same traps we do under our first birth
[1:54:40] you're following me right that's why our
[1:54:42] decisions going to be Lord take my
[1:54:44] nature and change it then it becomes
[1:54:46] your nature oh yeah not just to repent
[1:54:50] because you got caught or you did
[1:54:51] something bad you've got to do that
[1:54:52] you've got to repent when you do wrong
[1:54:54] but you got to pray until God changes
[1:54:57] your nature they don't fall into the
[1:54:58] same pitfall you did before because our
[1:55:00] nature will lead us down the wrong road
[1:55:01] as if one quite clear on their right our
[1:55:04] own human nature were born with it will
[1:55:06] lead us down the wrong road it will make
[1:55:08] us do the wrong decisions in life amen
[1:55:14] that's why you know the biggest enemy
[1:55:16] you have is yourself you know the
[1:55:18] biggest enemy the devil was defeated on
[1:55:20] Calvary right hell he doesn't have the
[1:55:23] keys to his own house anymore
[1:55:24] he's defeated and he still is defeated
[1:55:27] but the biggest enemy you have is you
[1:55:30] right you are the one that gets in the
[1:55:32] way of you right you're the one who gets
[1:55:34] in the way
[1:55:35] god you're the one who actually you know
[1:55:37] you're the one who puts the speed yeah
[1:55:40] puts the brakes on amen that's why the
[1:55:44] Lord died amen
[1:55:47] watch this of our sin ascended on high
[1:55:50] poured Becca's Holy Ghost upon people
[1:55:52] that God would come and dwell in man
[1:55:54] that his spirit would overcome this
[1:55:57] flesh hallelujah amen and said now
[1:56:01] that's why friends let's make the right
[1:56:04] decision amen
[1:56:07] this just bow heads it a word of Prayer
[1:56:09] shall we but anyone like the agreement
[1:56:11] of priests want to raise your hand to
[1:56:12] the Lord
[1:56:12] gracious father you see the hands that
[1:56:15] are raised this morning Lord I have both
[1:56:17] hands up Lord because this flesh Lord
[1:56:21] this the Lord as the Apostle Paul said
[1:56:24] in Romans 7 there's the there's the law
[1:56:26] of sin that worketh in the flesh there's
[1:56:28] also the law of life your Holy Spirit it
[1:56:31] is our wretched man that I am the things
[1:56:33] that I would do I do not the things I
[1:56:35] don't do the those are things I do
