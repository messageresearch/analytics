we just want to commit this little meeting into your hands lord may just have your way oh god have your liberty we ask please lord in jesus christ's name we committed into your hands amen amen amen oh god bless you it's good to see you out tonight um we'll just uh turn to the scripture if uh if you don't mind we've got a first samuel chapter three and uh just a reminder that um we're gonna uh so brother thaddeus burgess will be here this weekend we're gonna have a couple of services at 10 and at six uh so you're welcome to come it's good to have everyone up you know it's just one i was so blessed to hear he's doing better you know i mean we've been praying i know you've been praying it's good to see family rally around and not look at what they see but look at the promise they means just encouragement to us so god bless you um let's just read i'd like to read a couple of scriptures just from first samuel chapter three just gonna read the first two scriptures here i'm just gonna i'm gonna read this here it says and this child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see and here the lamp of god went out of the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep that the lord called samuel and he answered here am i may the lord bless his word you may you may have your seats so i want to i want to uh maybe start a subject and just see how the lord opens it up but i want to just go into first samuel here because we we understand that samuel you know the prophet samuel coming upon the scene there in uh you know in israel's history was a great junction there in the in the history of israel and we can see if you know from from samuel coming and then david then solomon then the temple being set you know that that junction there in israel's history is being lived out today because we see eli was the end of the priesthood you know and then and then samuel the prophet came upon the scene he anointed david to become king and then david's son samuel built the temple and then brother brahm said that israel had like a bit of a millennium there when when samuel built the temple so you know we are living in a time where the church ages have come to an end god has sent a prophet he's anointed an age and we're looking for a rapture and then uh you know the great yeah the your wedding supper of the lamb and then the millennium's going to set him so this these you know this story in here is being lived out again amen and so i just want to just begin to to look at these things because you know these things are not just a nice idea and how neat it is but we see in the story we're in the story we're in these great big this junction that israel goes through we're in the story and we can see how believers conducted themselves here we see how david was during this great transition time israel had never had a king before you know it said that the you know the you know the word of the lord was precious in those days there's no open vision they just had a priesthood going on so now you know things were going to change in israel's history very dramatically and very quickly and so if we can see ourselves because brother brahm says if you can see how the type lived and how they overcame we can see ourselves overcoming as well because we are we are being you know david is not just christ the rejected king but he's also us as well we're a type of david you know the scripture has compound meaning so if you see how you know the believers conducted themselves and how they overcame then we can look into that and draw strength from it and we can overcome the same way because i'm sure you can agree david was in a lot of tight spots yeah he didn't have it he didn't have it all easy he didn't have it just a you know like a red carpet rolled out here's the throne and everything went swimmingly he he went through a lot of tight spots and many people in those same conditions would have burst and failed under pressure but god did not allow david remember it was david's as god's promise to david it wasn't david's ambition that got him on the throne it wasn't david's planning that god and there god placed him there and david had confidence you know if this is all you get out of it tonight that's all perfectly well david had confidence that samuel a vindicated proven prophet of god anointed him and he anointed him to become king and therefore if he was going to be anointed king he was going to become king and he had confidence that god's anointing was going to see him through until he's sitting upon the throne he didn't have confidence in himself he didn't have confidence that maybe even the mighty warriors that rallied to him he had confidence that god had called him to become king and that saw him through great trials that saw him through the hard times and the desperate hours when he was running that saw him through amen and so i trust you can begin to see yourself in the picture now now we can see here this with with eli that you know we've had seven church ages and and it's came to a it's came to a junction in time where you know we read here in in verse 3 that the lamp of god went out in the temple and my chain reference tells me that this lamp is the menorah and the you know you know in the in the tabernacle you know you have the article in the inner court and in the inner court is the menorah that's got the seven candlesticks i know you're familiar with it and it draws oil from one one basin and so this this is a course this shows the seven church ages and it's showing now that the light of the church goes out and then as soon as the light goes out god begins to speak to samuel because the light of the church has gone out now remember we have to walk in the lightest hairs and the light so now god was actually symbolizing here church ways of doing things has come to an end i'm gonna by my word place the people how they should be because we see eli you know he was too um he was too soft on his sons i put it that way to correct them they were living in sin they were polluting the priesthood and all these things and so the church order had become polluted and so god was you know you can read earlier you know god sends a prophet to eli saying your sons are not going to take your place it's going to be done away with i'm going to raise up someone else and that one he was raising up was ministering for him in the temple already and so now eli you know so that was showing now that church ways of doing things were coming to an end and you know israel had had the priesthood for hundreds of years probably you know you know by this time they knew what the levite priesthood was they knew what the high priest was but now a king was going to come and now they had another prophet in the land because there was a scripture that had to be fulfilled in genesis 49 and verse 10 it says this so shall not depart from judah until shiloh come so there is a promise now that the scepter means the kingship the kingship's going to come into judah but when when the patriarch was blessing his sons and giving this blessing there was no king and that prophecy lingered and laid there in the scrolls for hundreds of years until finally it came the season where god says i'm going to make this become flesh is going to become a reality and we see here that god god was going to place a king over his people and there came a point where man wanted a king because they saw the failure because this is what happens if man sees the failure of something they're looking for another man to make it all better because they said to samuel your sons aren't doing the right thing give us a king like the other nations instead of depending upon the lord they were depending upon another man they wanted another man they could put their confidence in they wanted to follow another man instead of following god himself and so saul saul was not the tribe of judah we understand that he is from the tribe of benjamin but saul was the king that man wanted so he was he was the idea that israel had of a king in their mind he was he was that idea in a man you could say he was the revelation of what they thought a king should be head and shoulders above the rest big strong man to lead them into battle but that was not god's choosing god's idea of a king was a little shepherd boy totally different totally different ideas and so and we can see this in the scripture you even go into the days of jesus you know the scribes and pharisees brother baron speaks about it quite often the pharisees say the messiah is going to come out of our group and and the scribes think he'll come out of our group and he'll you know he'll come down and be brothers so and so be his forerunner because he's a great intellectual man and the messiah will come down a stairway out of heaven check the hands of the high priest here i am and you know but when the fulfillment came it was a man who was in the desert from a very young age eight years old whatever it was trained by a guy on the back side of the desert here he came he was the forerunner standing there knee deep in the jordan and mud crying behold the kingdom of god is at hand and then here comes jesus the messiah god and flesh comes he didn't come out of any organization that was god's choosing it wasn't man's choosing man would never have picked those two amen god chose very different people and so it's the same thing the same thing as today david would never have been anyone's choice to be king here's a boy he's looking after his daddy's sheep i know you know the story very well but just let it sink in a little bit here's a boy who's looking after his daddy's sheep sure he's from a great family there you know from bethlehem and you know boaz and ruth and you know all these ones down a great family of royalty he was from but he was the youngest son he didn't look like a king but yet he was god said i have a king in jesse's house and david didn't know this is what he is meant to be and he's looking after his daddy's sheep and god gave him a heart that he's a man after my own heart and god made him this way and then here you are people think the bride of christ they'll never pick us your mother just come to terms they would never man man if they looked they would think of some big super church some big super organization thing that's covered the earth and all these things it has covered the earth but not in the way they think it should cover the earth i mean it's people people that man would never pick god says this is this is my wife this is the one i've been waiting to be come upon the earth he's been waiting for you and here you are adam and eve you know he waited for them to be expressed and he could have fellowship with them and you know and here you are and then so god chooses a very different kind of people than what man chooses and so samuel now samuel began great changes in israel because he would begin to you know he was rejected we understand saul came into power but saul failed when the challenge came because if we go to let's just read a little bit let's go to first samuel chapter 17. i just want to read a few things now the great challenge came and you can see saul you know even before this you know he he he cut an oxen into pieces he sent it throughout israel see this is man this is how man applies leadership man applies leadership by pressure and he cuts up an auction and he sends it to the full corner of the of israel and says if you do not come and fight you'll become like this he put fear upon the people trying to put some physical pressure david didn't lead this way amen david didn't lead that way saul led that way because it was man's choosing this is how man's kind of leadership operated in those days by exerting a kind of pressure upon the people to conform to a certain idea god doesn't operate that way friends he's a gentleman he says here here it is and you can choose it or reject it and it gives you what you need in order to do it before he imposes anything upon you hallelujah so we see here in general uh sorry in first samuel chapter 17 we have you know david and goliath i know you're very familiar with the story but here we have if we read we'll just read verses verse from from verse four and then went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines now here comes the great challenge named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass and his griefs uh any i don't think he said he said graves griezmann brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders and the staff of his spare was like a weaver's beam and his spare head weighed 600 shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him now man when men look at me when men looked at goliath they saw a size now this is probably very elementary but i hope it helps they saw a size intimidated by its size but they weren't looking see we can either look at things through our natural eye or we can look at things through the eyes of the word and it depends if you want to succeed look at it through the eyes of the word if you want to fail look at use these two things use these five senses you're sure to fail and so they were intimidated by this big giant man but they forgot that they are a covenant people serving the living god and they forgot he was covered in judgment because his whole arm was made out of brass and that's god's divine judgment this man was a walking defeated thing because he's already gone re-judge him saying my judgment's passed and he's been found wanting and here he was making his boast amen here he was making his boast and saul and the people of israel there were looking at his size and they weren't looking at the promise of god where one will chase a thousand two chased ten thousand and they were now stuck for 40 days in this battle array and we know you know 40 years as a generation so i just wonder if i may say they were stuck there for like a generation and they couldn't they couldn't have advantage the philistines the devil just wants to hold you there he just wanted to hold them out in the field and try and wear them down a little bit it's the same thing with with the devil today friends he just wants to hold you there in a challenge and try and wear you down amen and if you look at the size of the challenge you'll fail but if you look at the promise of god amen if you start to testify quote the word you'll cut philistines plum to the walls just takes one person to take god in his word and everyone else will rally around it hallelujah so now here we have so they're stuck in this way and but they forget that there's one in the land has been anointed by the prophet when when saul was anointed saul said uh samuel told him you'll become like a new man after you prophesy with these other ones he became like a new man but never said and the spirit of god was with him from that day on but then when david he's a little boy god says this man is this boy is my king in him is to be a king and when samuel pointed the horn of oil poured it over his head and said and the spirit of god was with him from that day on so what he needed to be king was with him i'd say it was in him the qualities of of a king was in him as the same thing with us the qualities of the bride of jesus christ is in you amen what you have need of is in you hallelujah if god has become a living reality where it's not a story book but it becomes it comes a personal love letter and god is not a god of history saul had had a reputation he had built look we won this battle we won this battle and he could point back to some legacy that he had but he didn't have the present i am god and then david said i killed the bear i killed the lion god gave me them this philistine will be exactly like them he brought the god of history was the god of the present for him he wasn't he wasn't just leaning back on well god did these things for me way back when but david set god's present he didn't just talk about it he proved it because he knew it wasn't his ability that was going to kill that giant he knew it was the god in him that was going to kill the giant hallelujah it's the same thing with us the very god of david is present amen and we don't need to lean on the arm of flesh lean on the arms of god hallelujah then we can doubt down any giant amen that comes across our path but we see that saul even himself if we go to if we go further down the chapter two to verses 34 to 38 we see that saul is trying to arm david according to the weapons that he had but unfortunately that david saul's method was as judged as goliath method because we see here if we just read it a little bit we'll go from verse 34 i believe i have and david said unto saul as he begins to testify it's good to testify amen even it's just a little thing testify about it in god's economy nothing's big nothing's great it's all great amen he saved me that's great amen my my kid was a little bit sick we prayed he got healed that's great oh it doesn't matter how small we think it is to god it's all important and great so just begin to testify as david said unto saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went out after him now sorry just before we go has anyone seen you go on to youtube there's there's this footage of hunters trying to kill lions there's like four or five of them got these great big cannon kind of rifles and and they're hunting these lines and then quite a few of them the line actually nearly literally grabs one of them and they shoot it like point blank and they've got they've got bushman trackers they've got all these things and some of them nearly get killed here's a little boy he's got a sling and a stone he doesn't have a big cannon thing he doesn't have some bushman tracker with him and all these he doesn't have his buddies all his goddess he's on the back side of the farm somewhere with a sling amen right wasn't it wasn't some line that was just asleep someplace they meant this you know this line and bear they just grabbed an animal you know they were running on adrenaline they were fully awake blood was probably in their mouths amen and here he was i just killed this i killed this one he'll be the same as that one and david said unto saul thy servant has kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his bed and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them saying he has to find the armies of the living god see david put all in the same category just put the devil in the same category doesn't matter if it's a great big crisis or a little thing if god delivered you out of one thing he'll deliver you again and if he delivered you another thing he'll deliver you again and you'll and he'll anoint you to overcome something else amen amen he doesn't he doesn't do something for you then leave you the next day you can see david stepped out in faith amen he believed yeah brother brown many times he says no i don't know he'll come waiting for the angel lord to come i don't know if he'll come and he's just there and waiting but he's there in faith he had to believe he would come see same thing with us just step out in faith if it's according to the word step out in faith and watch god come upon the scene david said moreover verse 37 i'm sorry my voice david said moreover the lord hath delivered me out of the poor of the lion and now the poor of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with you now notice and saul armed david with his armor and put a helmet of brass upon his head also he armed them with a coat of mail and david girded his sword upon his armor and he has said to go for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them and david put them off him see helmet of brass saul's way of thinking was already judged by because he already said saul's not my king anymore david's my king so his very method of doing things has already been judged and failed amen and they would just and him and him and goliath were both judged whether he liked it or not and so that's why david david was a spiritual man he could see this way doesn't work i'm going to try my way because it's worked before so it's going to work again and so he took his staff in his hand and he chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine he took five stones because he knew goliath had brothers he didn't take five because he was scared he was gonna miss amen he knew if he had to kill all of his brothers him and his brothers in the same day god would allow him to kill them all amen don't be afraid see he was looking through the eyes of the word he's a covenant he's a circumcised believer standing in the promised land this devil had to die and that's all he looked at amen and then let's just go down you know david was fearless because he knew that god would deliver him he was fearless because he knew god would deliver him now let's go down to verse 48 and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew now to meet david that david hastened and he ran towards the army to meet the philistine and david put his hand his bag and took fences stone and slang it and smoked the philistine in the forehead that the stones sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth so david prevailed over the philistine with a slinger with a stone and smoked the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david therefore david ran took a stood upon the philistine drew out his sword and took his sword and drew it out to the of the sheath thereof and slew him cut off his head there with and when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled see david ran into the battle you see in the when you see the cartoons he's just standing there the bible doesn't say he stood there he ran to meet him he ran to meet the challenge he wasn't afraid he knew that this this giant was as good as dead he just wanted to see it lived out oh look he just want to see the devil he already got the revelation this one's going to be like the bear in the line amen so he ran towards his enemy friends we're not called to shrink back the devil may look big but the bigger he is the easier he is to hit amen that's why david this man's a giant he's huge i can't miss him he had i can't miss it and not only that god guided the stone to the killing place amen we have you know what we have is an incredible weapon amen that you know saul said to david you're a youth this man's been trained as a warrior from his youth so here was the goliath was you could say the apex of the philistine military machine in that day he was the elite soldier he was their champion he was the best the devil could put forward and here comes a little boy this is the best that god could put forward amen hallelujah hey man it's not how big it's the size of the fight in the dog not the size of the dog in the fight amen god so we have this confidence so i trust you can see yourself in there but because he was anointed to become king he knew whatever came his way god would cause him to overcome it amen now david we see after this things begin to change and the reason begin to change is because the kingship was coming was coming into israel and a corner was being turned you could say in their journey and we see that every you know every so often the church itself turns a corner and god we understand the book of revelation that he has four different anointings that come out in a certain time to combat the enemy we see in the you know in the first church age there we had a white horse rider the devil riding fourth and deception and a lion anointing went forth to combat that deception and then when the enemy uh became crowned and a man and then he took up a sword and began to kill the believers then the people were anointed with an ox sacrificial anointing to combat what the devil was doing and that's why when you read things like the fox's book of matters when the people saw their steak they saw where they are going to be killed they begin to rejoice and they and some of them said you don't need to bind me to the stake i'll just stand here willingly why is that because they are anointed to give their lives in such a way they are anointed to overcome the pressure of the age they were living in and then finally we come down to this age where where the church world was like it was there was saul and his army and goliath and the philistines everything was in a stalemate and the way souls were doing things that you know the church were doing things had come to its end and it couldn't overcome the enemy to to to drive out the enemy and then so god raised up god raised up brother brown he sent elijah upon the earth who came a different way to a church education way of doing things and he came in such a way now that a change was happening because remember we used to have bible schools for many years we had seminaries and god allowed those things god allowed how the lutherans were and how the methodists were and the pentecostals god allowed that system of but then they came to a point that god had in his word that those things were going to be done away with and i was going to restore a true relationship with between me and my people and so god god turned a corner where where under luther it was the intelligence of a man you know they had the printing press that many of them you take like like erasmus that that took the a greek text and put it together and william tyndale took that text and you know turned into the english these people knew many languages are smart people very educated people god used that because they had a man's intelligence but that came through into the pentecostal age but then it came to a point where god said it's going to be different now everyone's going to turn a corner and instead of a man's intelligence there's going to be an eagle anointing coming to the church amen that will combat what the enemy is doing today just like david came upon the scene he didn't he wasn't dressed how saul was dressed in battle he came a different way and so we have now what we're anointed with here at your own eagle anointing is that is said to combat the pressure that we live under every day amen because we don't live hey we have freedom of religion we have a nice country to live in but there's a pressure and there's there's an unseen force that is trying to rob you of your victory in christ there's a force trying to rob you of your joy and your love for the lord amen busyness of life brother and says it's a pressure that's in this age and if we're not careful we will look through the eyes of flesh and those things will begin to block us down but god is not will not wanting us to be bogged down with the things of life hey sure we've got to have families we have jobs we've got to do all the natural things plant potatoes do whatever you got to do but at the end of the day we should look through the eyes of the word amen everything in life we should look through the eyes of the word and say well lord is this is this pleasing to you not it's not a bunch of rules it's never been a bunch of rules to me it's lord does this please you if you're in a relationship with someone you do things to try and please them you don't always get it right but you try your best amen but it's because you're in a relationship and god you know god has entered into a relationship with his bride with you and me when he became real to me it's because he wanted to enter into a relationship with me and then i just gave myself and responded to that call and the ever since lord does this please you yes okay well no it doesn't okay that's fine yes and no equally good and then so where the church has been there's been a change he said when the fourth seal opened the eagle began to fly brother bam tells us these things so he says that the church now is anointed in a different way to it was in the past and that's why when you can go down the street and you look at things in this world you can actually see it for what it is you can actually go into the mall or whatever it is and you can see things and you can actually say that is not pleasing to my lord remember it said it become so close that even you know deceive the elect if it was po if it was possible is not possible because god has equipped us to look at this world you don't have to consciously do it there's something in you that says that it's either alarm bell saying no or there's a piece that just says yes do it amen you don't have to work it out and get all worried about it just walk with god it's a relationship honey is this fine no it's not fun okay we'll do something else is it fine a cat will just get you just relax and enjoy him walk with him amen and then and then you can see things because an eagle can see it's the only one of those four creatures that can actually get off the ground amen it can it can see above and look down and not only just look down it can look from eternity to eternity amen that's why the gospel of john is so important for our age in which we're alive and because he because he's under that same anointing to go from in the beginning was the word and the word was with god he goes from there and then the word became flesh none of the other gospels are written that way and it pertains to our day it's very important how it's written you see because it's written under that legal anointing and then so we are we are under that same anointing amen he said well you know that's the only way we can overcome in this age is because the anointing of god amen brother i'm said in perfect faith he said you jesus had faith in what he was and who he was he had faith in who he was you go listen to it and that gave him perfect faith i'm not saying it verbatim just go listen to the message he had faith in what he was and he says in order for us that perfect faith we have to have faith in what god has made us david had faith in what god had made him amen there's one bit first samuel 18. we'll just read this here and we'll go down to verse 14. remember david knew david knew he was going to become king and we could all say well of course he knew that you know he became you know we read it it's all in the past it's all happened but there are many times in his life where he's in great jeopardy and it was a hair's breath from being all over but you see david because he had confidence what god had made him he could behave himself in such a way and it says here in first samuel 18 14 and 15 and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lord was with him wherefore when saul saw that he be but he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him so he was saul saul knew that the spirit of god had departed from him and he knew that the lord was with david but how david conducted himself it made because saul was his enemy we understand that so how david conducted himself made his enemy fear him now the devil comes across your path amen and god allows it to happen and it's done because god wants to prove the power of his salvation amen that's why job you know god said to you know he had fellowship with the devil one day have you considered my servant job he's perfect he's a perfect man and job gave the lamb sacrifice and brother tells us that god job had confidence in the lamb that's why he could stand the test the way he did because he had confidence in the lamb amen so what what was happening throughout that whole trial is that god was proving the power of his provided sacrifice in job's life yeah you're following me so far so god allows the devil to come across your path because god is wanting to prove the power of the cross in your life amen because many other people have the trials you have and they fall apart and sometimes we do fall apart but there's something in it says lord pick me up and try me one more time and he says i've been waiting for you to ask me that amen that's why he's our high priest that's why he's our intermediary that's why he's our high priest our lamb he still is our lamb it's not the man that falls it's him that gets back up that's what god counts as great when a man is willing to say lord i failed try me one more time amen so david he he acted himself in such a way in the presence of his enemies that his enemies begin to fear him the devil fed jesus jesus did not bend to the devil's temptation in the wilderness he was afraid of him that's why he spent all of his energy trying to destroy him that's why he anointed the scribes and pharisees he turned the whole place against him because he fed this man never a man had spake like this man the devil knew it and jesus behaved himself in such a way because he knew for this cause i've come into the world he he believed in what god had made him and he believed in one scripture that he'd come out of the grave remember jesus sure he was the word made flesh but he's also a man and he had to believe the word like we have to believe the word because he was the perfect example of a christian amen he became like us that we could become like him so he he he endured trials he had temptations he was tempted on all points but yet without sin he didn't fall for the temptation because he had to go through that to understand what we have to go through amen he was exactly like us he had the same brother said he was tempted by a woman he's tempted by all kinds of things but yet he did not give himself to the temptation amen because he was god but he's also a man and so he he behaved himself in such a way imagine there he's in he's in pilate's judgment hall the devil's hovering around watching the proceedings why doesn't he why doesn't he answer them back why doesn't he call for ten thousand legion you know how many legions of angels why doesn't he respond he was behaving himself wisely because he knew this was the purpose this was this is what he had to fulfill at that point of his journey and the devil fed this man and then finally when he was on the cross and he and he anchored the stinger of death into him pulled it out i said no he didn't pull it i was stuck and he said no i've got him he's dead it's finally all over but then it wasn't too long the devil goes down to hell puts his feet up in his lazy boy here's a knock on the door he says finally i've got you you're here no it was the other way around and jesus took the keys of hell death and the grave off him ascended on highly captivity captive and all these things greatest week in history is going on amen death burial resurrection of jesus christ amen and so he fed he he fed him and then that same life that he fed went into the apostles and then the devil fed the apostles that's why before the book of acts you know you see one place they want to stone jesus one place they want to throw him down a cliff and all these things and and he just walks around them where were the disciples when they were wanting to kill jesus they were with him why didn't those people try and kill the disciples then because that life that eternal life wasn't in them so he was they were not a threat to the devil they were people believing on him but they weren't yet as jesus said to peter when you're converted strengthen your brethren but then when that same life went into them in the day of pentecost then they would drag before the sanhedrin then they were you know don't preach in his name anymore though beaten they just rejoiced the devil got scared of them too because they behaved themselves wisely because they believed in what god had made them amen we have to believe have confidence in what god has made us amen you know brother brahms says that the devil can't take our lives until god our purpose is done upon this earth it doesn't matter what we go through how many hospital beds we end up in or how much sickness or being destitute on the street or whatever hardship if our purpose is not is not done upon this earth the devil cannot take our lives amen david knew sure you read the psalms he cries out like you know there was great times of distress sure there was and god was using those great times to mold him into the king he was meant to be amen that's why you see david when he finally stepped on the throne he had the character sure he fell in a couple of places but he had the character to be a godly king you see after solomon there one's down they did not have the character to sit on that throne because they weren't taken through that great desert of experience amen count it all joy when the fiery trials try you try your faith it's the trying of your faith count it all joy why is that because you're being molded and you're being shaped because there's a there's a character god god is going to have a bride with perfect character he's determined to have you in such a way he was determined to have david in such a way amen but david knew he knew he had to sit upon that throne amen i trust it's become a revelation to you there's a place at the wedding supper table with your name on amen he says you'll sit in my throne as i sit in my father's throne i trust is anchored in your soul there's a place that i'm gonna sit one day and it's not under some footstool some places could be on the highest throne there is amen with your lord so god allows these things i'm going through the ringer say hallelujah everything's turns upside down it's going to be all well this is what this bible tells me david didn't matter where he was that's amazing he didn't he he could have killed saul it would have been all over he was the one trying to take his life and he let him go because he could see beyond see it's interesting saul was of a former age still a believer samuel said today you'll be with me you know he's going to die he was a believer but but under a formal light and he was david now alexander an eagle anointing he didn't try and kill saul saul tried to kill him saul tried to you'd say you bring him to today's language saul character assassinated david he had him on the run he was trying to drag him down and do all kinds of things with him david had opportunities and it would have stuck too but he knew this was once the lord's anointed amen he had respect for saul even though saul was trying to kill him and he didn't he wasn't he could have killed him you'll know the story very well but you've got to put yourself in the story you've got to put yourself there when a brother or a sister comes against you amen do you go on facebook or get on the phone and kill them or he just you know their lord they're the lords anointed amen see he had such confidence that god had anointed him to become king that didn't matter what came his way even he could have just think of it here's the he'd have a coup just wipe them all off you know take out his royal garden all these things and just go onto the throne but he waited because he knew that god in his timing would orchestrate in such a way that now saul and jonathan died and now he was going to come upon the throne eventually amen and even even after that when there was war in israel civil war going on he knew he was going to be king over the entire place amen so how do we conduct ourselves when when it's not well they said military terms it's like blue on blue when your own team is trying to kill you instead of the enemy it's someone within trying to kill you how do you conduct yourself amen you know when he was rejected king that crippled guy was spitting at him and throwing rocks and cursing him and all these things when he's fleeing the city his guard was going to pull his sword it's easy to tell the story but david said no maybe the lord told him to do that as this was an israelite brother he was maybe crippled up in his doctrine or his walk with the lord but david said no just just leave him alone because he knew he would come back into power david did you see now how do we you say well that that's such a simple scene here's a man trying to throw stones at a runaway king but david was spiritual you can see mate there's more to what more to this than meets the eye it's more than just what i see he says maybe the lord's told them to do that amen now how about you someone comes against you or something comes against you do you rise up and say get a body gun say blow that guy's head off what do you say maybe the lord's allowed him to do this maybe the lord told him to do this amen david conducted himself sure he failed we all failed he failed more than soul failed did you read what he did read what sold it he did far more worse of things than what sold it but yet he is a man after god's own heart when things are exposed i think it was at the convention i'm not sure who said it they said when nathan came to samuel after david took bathsheba it was two years after the after the fact when he went in and gave the parable of the man with all the sheep and the man with the one cheek that was two years after david had uriah died normally you know murder and all these things two years after the fact but david had a heart that when something when the lord put a finger on something he said i'm the man i'm guilty amen that is a that is the character of christ being displayed amen remember we are david scripture's got compound meaning but you see if you can see how david and i encourage you go go and read david's life sure he did some things wrong but when the challenges came and he conducted himself in such a way you see david sure he wasn't such a good dad that's why epsilon raised up and maybe he saw that from his own father here comes samuel to to have a feast with him and worship at all these things dave is not even called he's just out doing his chores here comes you know it's like imagine brother brown comes into town and you're not invited he's coming to your house having a meal and you're out doing what you're what your dad tells you to do not even considered to be important and to me that's possibly why because david saw that example that's why epsilon wasn't dealt with there wasn't the communication between dad and son as it should have been but because david david possessed his office as king in such a way that even when absalom rose up and david didn't deal with it properly because he was god's king and he was being you know he's fully possessing it wasn't like ahab ahab was king but he wasn't king he wasn't possessing the officer's king properly so jezebel could run the place you see big big difference so even when epsilon rose up god respected david's office and he took care of epsilon but david should have dealt with it properly you see and so i trust i hope there's a blessing but you should look into his life because your life he's the shadow of you remember you should see jesus christ in every scripture we see jesus christ and david but because we're in christ you should see yourself in the same word amen hallelujah i mean so look into these things friends that same god remember the spirit of god was with david from that they are but because the blood of jesus christ was not shared it was just a blood of bulls and goats the spirit of god wasn't in him like he is you and i amen and the same god that he he believed in what god made him we have to believe what god has made us that's not being proud the more you recognize what god has done for you i trust the more humble it makes you the more yielded say lord you're so merciful and gracious to me amen it doesn't it doesn't lift you up he's trying to lift you up god doesn't want us as some downtrodden woman no no real husband that loves his wife treads her down that's right he wants to lift her up and love her and make her co-equal with him in everything that's right that's what the lord wants to do with us amen you say well that's making too much of me david david didn't make himself king he wasn't trying to be king he wasn't playing royal court out with the sheep he was just being a shepherd boy but god had already made him king he's like jeremiah before you were in your mother's womb i'd ordained you to be a prophet to the nations he couldn't help being king he was ordained to be king you can't help being the bride of jesus christ you're ordained to become it amen you had to be it's in you to be it you say i have my humanity just die daily don't don't look at this thing the greatest remember brother brown said the greatest enemy i have is william branham because the devil's defeated he's been defeated for two thousand years from calvary he was defeated at calvary he's a defeated being now you just gotta defeat yourself how do you defeat yourself just yield yourself to the lord not my will but thy will be done amen can we honey can you come play the piano amen that's all we have to do look through the eyes of the word friends god's promise if he said something just lay hold of it don't be afraid to say what if it the devil says what if it doesn't work what if it doesn't work brother and says why should i worry worry has no virtue i'll believe because faith might deliver me that's what he says just believe it oh it's never been done for just believe it amen take god at his word david talk about his word i'm a circumcised believer and i'm standing in my inheritance this devil must die amen we can do the same thing hallelujah amen brother andy my voice is terrible so i'm going to call you up amen let's just stand shall we let's just pray amen and i'll just pass the um password brother andy let's pray gracious dear lord jesus father we thank you you're in control of everything father when we have supreme confidence
