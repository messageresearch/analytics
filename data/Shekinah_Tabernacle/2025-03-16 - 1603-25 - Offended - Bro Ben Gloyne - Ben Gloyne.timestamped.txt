[15:27] and Pentecost had
[15:29] arrived at our peroon party. They were

[15:37] among them. And they knew there was no
[15:41] doubt. This Holy Ghost fire, it will
[15:45] make you dance and shout. It's just my
[15:48] [Applause]
[15:50] fire. Shut up in my voice.
[15:54] This whole week goes fire. She shut up
[15:57] in my bones just like
[16:02] fire. Shot up in my bones. This whole
[16:07] go shot up in my bones. Well fell from
[16:12] his mother's belly. Born to
[16:16] prophesy the prophet
[16:19] Jeremiah would lift his voice and cry.
[16:23] Be quiet. The folks demanded, "Shut up
[16:26] and leave us alone." But he said, "How
[16:30] can you be quiet when there's fire down
[16:33] in your home?
[16:38] Shut up in
[16:41] my
[16:43] go. Shut up in my bones. Just
[16:49] like shut up in my
[16:52] bones. So we
[16:55] go. He shut up in my
[16:59] bones. And
[17:01] open upon Elijah's bones. the dead man
[17:07] resurrected and he ran back to his home.
[17:11] And when he tells the folks a story
[17:14] where you could hear him say he said, "I
[17:17] found that holy power in a deep and
[17:22] Just my

[17:25] fire. Shut up in
[17:30] my
[17:31] fire. Shut up in my
[17:37] just shut up in
[17:40] my holy go.
[17:47] Some people get
[17:49] offended because I leave and shout. They
[17:53] say too much
[17:55] emotion and too much fooling about. But
[17:59] don't tell me to be silent or to sit
[18:02] down in my pew. Good. If you felt what I

[37:44] God bless you. Amen. So, welcome
[37:46] everyone. Appreciate you being here.
[37:49] Amen. Amen.
[37:51] Hallelujah. Amen. I trust you all feel
[37:54] at home. We got lunch after service, so
[37:56] don't don't run away unless you got to
[37:57] catch a flight or you can get another
[37:59] one, but you know, I mean, but you're
[38:00] welcome for lunch afterwards. Okay? So,
[38:02] God bless you. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[38:03] You can have your seats. Um I just want
[38:05] to speak. I did um uh just just before
[38:08] we go to the scripture, I just want to
[38:09] share a bit about Samoa very very very
[38:12] briefly. We just see if this works. So
[38:14] uh this time last week I was in Apia um
[38:17] Eagle Christian Fellowship there put on
[38:18] a convention for the Pacific. It was
[38:20] really brother Ralph uh from Oakland his
[38:22] his burden and some believers and
[38:24] different ones uh came from all over. So
[38:27] um so we had brethren from from Sydney
[38:29] from Melbourne or outside of Melbourne
[38:31] Sheperton. Um brother Fie and some RFBF
[38:34] came and um he had some brothers from
[38:36] Fiji and little old me. So we had a
[38:39] blessed time. Um it was if we just Yeah.
[38:43] So this is this is a typical kind of
[38:45] after the service. There was great
[38:46] unity. You know people ask me what it
[38:48] was like. I say it was like camp. Spirit
[38:51] of God was there. Love between the
[38:52] brethren. Um it was it was such a
[38:54] blessed time. Um yeah, so uh the
[38:58] fellowship in Apia, uh brother Lu, who
[39:00] was the pastor, he went to be with the
[39:02] Lord a few years ago, so they don't have
[39:03] a pastor at the moment. So it was a real
[39:06] good boost for them, a blessing for
[39:07] them, I believe. And it was a blessing
[39:08] to um to be there. Uh what else do we
[39:11] have? Um so um this is a side note, but
[39:15] I hadn't um I hadn't been to Samoa for
[39:17] about 20 years. My parents used to live
[39:19] in American Samo, and to get to American
[39:21] Samo, you got to fly through Western
[39:23] Samo. So, one thing that hasn't changed
[39:25] is the fact you're met with a quartet
[39:27] band and there's the bass player on the
[39:28] right uh left right hand side with with
[39:31] a upside down bucket and a stick and he
[39:32] just moves the stick and changes the
[39:34] note. Um, but the thing is one thing
[39:36] that was neat to go for me, this is a
[39:38] very special trip for me because when I
[39:39] was last in Samo, I wasn't a Christian.
[39:42] I didn't know God at all. And when I was
[39:45] there, well, in American Samo, there was
[39:47] a hurricane hurricane cyclone Heather
[39:49] came through and I think where's Fish?
[39:50] He he he went to Newway to Where is he?
[39:52] He's there. Yeah, he was in Newway at
[39:54] that time helping rebuild cuz the that
[39:56] cyclone went straight over Newway,
[39:57] flattened it. It went around the south
[39:59] coast of American Samo, but where my
[40:01] parents lived there, I don't have any
[40:03] photos of it, but they lived on the um
[40:05] only real flat part of the island. It
[40:07] was like a big lava rock shelf with
[40:09] about this much dirt. And and after that
[40:11] cyclone went through, the only trees
[40:12] left standing were coconut trees. So the
[40:15] next morning after the cyclones gone
[40:17] through, big trees were you everything
[40:18] got blown over, whole, you know, houses
[40:20] got um um blown down, all those things.
[40:23] And and so the next morning I had to cut
[40:24] a path through our path through our
[40:27] driveway through all these fallen trees
[40:28] and branches uh for my dad to go see if
[40:31] his work was still there. Thankfully it
[40:32] was. But there I was not a Christian.
[40:34] Now coconut trees have coconuts, right?
[40:36] We all know this, right? If one of those
[40:39] things hits you, I think you're pretty
[40:40] much gone. This is what I thought. So
[40:41] here these things are swaying like mad.
[40:43] big, you know, gale force winds, you
[40:45] know, and um and and I'm and I'm cutting
[40:48] with a machete through these fallen
[40:49] trees and I'm looking up watching these
[40:51] coconuts going. And I got real religious
[40:55] cuz I was scared I could die. So, I
[40:56] started singing every hymn I knew from
[40:58] chapel from school. I wasn't a
[41:01] Christian. But then fast forward a few
[41:03] years, Christy and I get married. We're
[41:04] in Christ Church for the first
[41:06] earthquake there. And we begin to pray
[41:08] as the place is shaking up and down and
[41:10] the spirit of God came down. We had no
[41:11] fear.
[41:13] It pays to know him when crisis strikes.
[41:16] Amen. Because when crisis strikes,
[41:17] that's when he really steps on the on
[41:19] the forefront. So, I'm so I'm so
[41:21] thankful during that during that
[41:22] earthquake, I wasn't singing all the
[41:24] hymns I knew, trying to trying to be
[41:27] religious in times of trouble, right?
[41:29] God just stepped on the scene. So, it
[41:30] was a very special trip for me. Um,
[41:33] yeah, we had a blessed time of
[41:34] fellowship. That's all the saints there
[41:35] singing from the um church here in Apia.
[41:38] Um, yeah, but they yeah, they uh s on
[41:41] hospitality is amazing. great love. Um
[41:44] yeah, it was just a great time. Had a
[41:45] blessed time in the Lord. So, um Lord
[41:48] willing, we'll go back again. Amen. So,
[41:49] if you ever if you ever want to go on
[41:51] holiday, go there and go to church and
[41:54] support the believers. Amen. Wonderful
[41:57] group of people. So, it was a real
[41:58] blessed time. Just a great unity. It was
[42:00] so nice. Amen. So, so I don't really
[42:02] have much more to add than that. Just
[42:03] want to keep it brief. So, also, if we
[42:04] could keep in prayer, this is this is
[42:06] Pastor Sam. He's in Sydney and um he's a
[42:09] real fireball, but he's looking at
[42:11] there's a transition going on in Sydney
[42:13] with pastors and so on and um um he's
[42:15] wanting to see a see a young brother
[42:17] step up and take that position and we
[42:19] just want to keep them in prayer, keep
[42:20] up here in prayer that the Lord would
[42:22] raise up a pastor there and um yeah, we
[42:24] got brothers and sisters all around the
[42:26] world and they're just like us. They
[42:28] love the Lord just like us. They worship
[42:29] like us. They love the Lord. So, it's um
[42:32] it's a real blessing. So, yeah, um let's
[42:34] uh let's stand to our feet this morning.
[42:35] Sorry, very brief.
[42:37] Um, I'm I'm a terrible and Christine can
[42:40] say I meant to this. I'm a terrible
[42:42] photographer. Okay, so when it comes to
[42:43] these and recording stuff, I'm bad at
[42:45] this, man. So, I'm sorry there weren't
[42:47] any better kind of photos, but it was
[42:48] just it it was such a Yeah, it was a
[42:50] blessed time. Amen. So, let's read from
[42:52] Matthew. We're going to go to Matthew 26
[42:54] and verses 30 to uh 35
[43:01] here. And um I was going to apologize to
[43:03] my girls. Sorry you heard this last
[43:05] night when we're having family altar.
[43:06] We're just kind of going to get the big
[43:08] big big version of it now. Okay. But you
[43:09] already know where I'm going. So just
[43:11] enjoy it with me. Yep. Okay. I think I
[43:14] got a yes. Okay. So Matthew 26 and30.
[43:17] And when they had sung a hymn, they went
[43:19] out into the Mount of Olives. Then saith
[43:22] Jesus unto them, "All ye shall be
[43:24] offended because of me this night. For
[43:26] it is written, I will smite the
[43:28] shepherd, and the sheep of the flock
[43:29] shall be scattered abroad. But after I
[43:32] am risen again, I'll go before you into
[43:34] Galilee." Peter answered and said unto
[43:36] him, "Though all men shall be offended
[43:39] because of thee, yet I will never be
[43:41] offended." Jesus said unto him, "Verily
[43:43] I say unto thee, that this night before
[43:45] the cockcrow, thou shalt deny me
[43:47] thrice." Peter said unto him, "Though I
[43:50] should die with thee, yet I'll not deny
[43:53] thee." Likewise also said all likewise
[43:57] also said all the disciples. Amen. And
[43:59] so let's pray together this morning. If
[44:00] you ever need, you just want to slip
[44:01] your hand up to the Lord. Say, "Lord,
[44:03] remember me in this this moment of
[44:04] time." Amen. Gracious Father, we love
[44:07] you so much, Lord. You're so good to us.
[44:09] So appreciate, Lord, we can gather in
[44:11] spirit and in truth this morning. Thank
[44:13] you, Father, we can come and Lord,
[44:15] praise your great name and give you
[44:16] glory for all you've done. Thank you,
[44:18] Lord, that you're the Lord God of heaven
[44:20] and earth. And Father, we want to invite
[44:22] you to our lives this morning. speak to.
[44:24] Lord, may you anoint not just me, the
[44:26] speaker, but the hearer, Father, us here
[44:28] and those who may be watching by the way
[44:29] of the internet. Lord, may you take
[44:31] control. May you may your word touch
[44:33] lives today for your glory. May you do
[44:35] what you want to do in this service.
[44:36] Lord, we want to get ourselves out of
[44:37] the way that Lord, you have free way to
[44:39] do what you want done. Lord, have
[44:41] liberty among us, Father. We love you so
[44:43] much and thank you, Lord, in Jesus
[44:44] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God
[44:47] bless. You can have your seats. Um, I'd
[44:49] also like to thank brother Arman,
[44:51] brother Isaac, and brother Jimmy for
[44:52] standing in the holding the fort.
[44:54] Appreciate all the services and
[44:55] everything. So, so thank you very much.
[44:57] Amen. So, we're just going to speak on
[44:59] this here where um Jesus Jesus said
[45:02] about how, you know, offense would come
[45:04] and it's and it's very interesting to me
[45:07] where he says this that that you know
[45:09] there would there would be a time where
[45:11] they should all be offended. Now notice
[45:12] this offense was not going to he did not
[45:14] say because of the Romans they'd be
[45:16] offended or they would not be offended
[45:18] because of the scribes or the Pharisees
[45:20] or even their own selves. But it was the
[45:22] word himself that would bring an
[45:24] offense. But notice he's speaking to
[45:26] believers. He's not speaking to the high
[45:28] priest. He's not speaking even to Judas
[45:30] at this time. I mean he's he's speaking
[45:32] to true believers, but he's telling them
[45:34] you're going to be offended because of
[45:36] me.
[45:39] My we cannot think that the word cannot
[45:42] offend us. The reason it offends us is
[45:45] because we have in our mind how it
[45:47] should be fulfilled. We must be very
[45:50] flexible. God knows how to fulfill his
[45:52] word. I think I've all got your
[45:54] attention just now. Right? God knows how
[45:56] to fulfill his word. He interprets his
[45:58] word by bringing it to pass. So we
[46:01] should never be offended, be annoyed, be
[46:03] upset when he fulfills his word a
[46:06] different way to what we think it should
[46:08] be fulfilled by. Because I could
[46:10] guarantee you if we could, you know, if
[46:12] we could go back in time when you just
[46:14] give your life to the Lord and and and
[46:16] you're interviewed saying, "What's your
[46:18] walk with God going to be like? What are
[46:20] you going to face? What struggles you
[46:21] going to go through? What things you
[46:23] know what what demon powers going to
[46:25] come against you? All those things." I
[46:27] could probably guarantee you that all of
[46:29] our gueststimations of our Christian
[46:31] walk to this point will be vastly
[46:33] different to what he has ordained. But
[46:36] you see, the footsteps of the righteous
[46:38] are ordered of the Lord. Right? It may
[46:40] be over mountains, through valleys,
[46:42] through trials, pain, fire, flood,
[46:43] whatever it may be, through great
[46:45] anguish and suffering, but yet they're
[46:47] ordained by him. So, we must never be
[46:50] offended. Sorry, we're going to get to
[46:52] the end of this eventually, okay? So,
[46:53] let's just hold in there. And you know,
[46:55] it's not all negative, okay? But we got
[46:56] to realize we can trust our shepherd.
[46:58] Amen. He is the good shepherd. Amen.
[47:00] We're never out of his care. Even when
[47:03] things like like remember their world
[47:04] was about to turn upside down
[47:06] completely. Amen. The the very one they
[47:09] knew that was the Messiah was the
[47:10] Christ. The promise of the ages was in
[47:12] flesh right before them. And he told
[47:15] them, "You're going to be offended
[47:16] because of me." Right? So the whole
[47:18] world, you see, they never expected,
[47:20] even though he told them time and time
[47:23] again, I'm going to be crucified. I'm
[47:25] going to be delivered into the hands of
[47:26] wicked men, but I'm going to raise
[47:28] again. He told them multiple times, but
[47:29] yet it's as if because of, I know, just
[47:32] humanity, they did not grasp the purpose
[47:35] he had come to the world. Even when John
[47:37] the Baptist said, "Behold the lamb of
[47:38] God that takes away the sin of the
[47:40] world." You would think that the
[47:41] disciples of John that followed Jesus
[47:44] would have put one and one together and
[47:45] realized, well, if the Old Testament
[47:47] lamb had to give its life, that sin
[47:49] would be covered, then this lamb of God
[47:50] is going to die, too. But they didn't
[47:53] grasp it. See, but but you got to
[47:56] realize even though they didn't grasp
[47:57] it, God walked with them until they
[48:00] realized they were part of the
[48:02] resurrection. Right? So, just because we
[48:04] don't understand everything that's going
[48:05] on, I think it's good we don't
[48:07] understand. Cuz when would we actually
[48:09] walk by faith? When would we actually
[48:11] walk by trust and faith and love? Amen.
[48:14] Because if you love someone, you will I
[48:16] mean, if you love someone, you trust
[48:17] them far more than just if you trust
[48:19] them. Like a work colleague or a friend.
[48:21] You may not love that person, but you'll
[48:23] trust them to a certain degree because
[48:24] of a relationship. But if you love that
[48:26] person, you'll trust them with your very
[48:27] life. Right? And that's the reason I
[48:29] think we don't see, you know, what we're
[48:31] going to walk through necessarily, the
[48:33] details of our life and the struggles we
[48:34] face, is because he wants us to trust
[48:37] him. Amen. Brother Ron Spencer, before
[48:40] he's uh I think he's 5 years with this
[48:43] cancer he's fighting, stage four cancer
[48:45] in his body. Before before the diagnosis
[48:48] ever came his way, the Lord told him,
[48:49] "If you trust me, I'll use you like
[48:52] never
[48:53] before." I think that goes for everyone
[48:56] if we can trust him. See, we don't have
[48:58] all the answers. He knows. But are you
[49:01] trusting him? Are you walking with or
[49:03] are you offended? Because how he's
[49:05] fulfilling his word in your life, it
[49:06] doesn't fit the mold of how you think it
[49:08] should
[49:10] go. Here's a few things that the Lord
[49:12] would um told told his disciples before
[49:16] uh before what we read uh what he spoke,
[49:19] what we just read. He said, "In my
[49:22] father's house are many mansions. If it
[49:24] were not so, I would have told you. I go
[49:25] to prepare a place for you. And if I go
[49:27] and prepare a place for you, I will come
[49:29] again and receive you unto myself, that
[49:30] where I am, there ye may be also. John
[49:33] 14:21. And he that hath my commandments
[49:35] and keepeth them, he will uh he it is
[49:37] that loveth me, and he that loveth me
[49:39] shall be loved of my father, and I'll
[49:41] love him, and will manifest myself to
[49:42] him. Verse 26, but the comforter, which
[49:45] is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
[49:46] send in my name, he shall teach you all
[49:49] things and bring all things to your
[49:50] remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
[49:52] you. In John 16:13, "How be it, when he,
[49:55] the Spirit of truth, has come, he'll
[49:56] guide you into all truth, for he shall
[49:58] not speak of himself, but whatsoever he
[50:00] shall hear, uh, that shall he speak, and
[50:03] he will show you things to come." So,
[50:06] because remember, when when Jesus is
[50:08] speaking these things, Judas is already
[50:10] out of the picture. God God begins to
[50:12] speak things to the disciples at a far
[50:14] greater depth and reality
[50:17] uh when Judas has left. But then he says
[50:19] after, he says, "You're all going to be
[50:20] offended because of me." because of how
[50:22] I fulfill my word, it's going to cause
[50:24] offense. You see, the controversy is
[50:26] never the fact the word will be
[50:27] fulfilled. It's how it's fulfilled is
[50:29] always the controversy. Right? Just like
[50:32] when when the Messiah came, we could
[50:34] have gone to any any any scribe or
[50:36] Pharisee, the high priest himself, and
[50:38] we could quote to him Isaiah 53, we
[50:40] could quote to him Isaiah 9:6 and all
[50:42] the promises of the Messiah. That
[50:44] wouldn't would not have offended any of
[50:46] them because they were they were looking
[50:48] for those promises to be fulfilled. But
[50:50] then when it became a reality, they were
[50:52] offended at the fulfillment of the
[50:54] scripture. That's why they didn't
[50:55] embrace the very Messiah they are
[50:57] looking for because he never he never
[50:59] comes the way we
[51:00] expect. Like Peter would um Paul would
[51:03] say here and without controversy great
[51:05] is the mystery of godliness. God was
[51:07] manifested in the flesh, justified in
[51:08] the spirit, seen of angels, preached
[51:10] unto the Gentiles, believed on in the
[51:11] world, and received up into glory. But
[51:13] you can say, "Hold on, Paul. It was
[51:15] actually a great controversy. That's why
[51:17] they crucified him. That's why they
[51:18] rejected him because they couldn't
[51:20] reconcile how this man who seemed to
[51:22] have an illegitimate birth could be the
[51:24] very Lord of glory made flesh. How could
[51:26] God could how could God become a man yet
[51:28] his word prophesied he would become a
[51:30] man? How could this man of Galilee be
[51:32] the fulfillment the promise that that
[51:34] was given to Adam and Eve in the garden,
[51:36] the seed of the woman? How could this
[51:38] man fulfill this criteria of it? But he
[51:40] came exactly as the word said he would
[51:42] come. But how he came was controversial
[51:45] to the religious orders of the day. They
[51:48] became offended because they had it
[51:50] worked out in their mind how he would
[51:52] come. I
[51:55] trust. Don't be annoyed how God fulfills
[51:58] his word in your life. Don't be annoyed.
[52:00] See, the devil wants us to be annoyed at
[52:03] God. He wants the bride of Jesus Christ
[52:06] to be annoyed at the
[52:08] bridegroom. That's what he wants. Don't
[52:10] be annoyed at him. He say it doesn't
[52:12] seem fair. I think it like if we look at
[52:15] the grand scheme of things, I'm I have
[52:18] eternal life. So whatever comes comes
[52:21] what may good or bad it doesn't really
[52:23] matter. I have eternal life. I am a son
[52:26] of God. Amen. He has redeemed me by his
[52:28] blood. So whatever happens in life, if
[52:30] he does anything more for me, it's
[52:32] actually just a bonus. He's already done
[52:34] so much for me that I have enough to
[52:36] praise him for eternity for. Amen. He
[52:39] has done so much for me. If he never
[52:40] answers another single prayer, never
[52:42] does a single thing in my life. He's
[52:44] already done more than enough to prove
[52:46] he loves me. He cares for me. He died
[52:48] for me. He's redeemed me. He's my
[52:50] savior. He's my redeemer. He's my
[52:52] counselor. He's already done more than
[52:54] enough for me. Praise God. So, we must
[52:57] never ever get
[53:00] offended at at the path we are led down
[53:03] at the at how he fulfills his word
[53:06] because we know we're all going to take
[53:08] a
[53:09] rapture, right? And sure, we know the
[53:12] mechanics of it that this message
[53:14] produces a bride fit for the rapture. We
[53:17] know that, right? The message is the
[53:18] shout of first Thessalonians 4. That's
[53:20] not controversial to us, right? We know
[53:22] these things. But the mechanics of the
[53:25] fact of the events of the world and all
[53:28] these things, the chaos or lack of
[53:30] thereof or whatever will happen with
[53:32] world events, we don't know exactly
[53:35] what's going to h what state this
[53:37] country will be in. I'm not preaching
[53:39] doom and gloom, but you got to you got
[53:40] to realize if the world falls apart,
[53:42] don't be offended. If you lose it all,
[53:44] don't be offended. Amen. You know, if if
[53:46] it if it looks like that the very
[53:48] prayers you're praying for, it looks
[53:49] like in front of you it's going the
[53:51] opposite direction. Don't be offended.
[53:53] That's God fulfilling his word. You
[53:56] don't know what tomorrow holds. You
[53:57] don't know that tomorrow could be the
[53:58] answer. You know, what you're looking
[54:00] for in your mind and believing for could
[54:01] be right in front of you, even though
[54:02] today it's going the opposite way. So,
[54:05] don't be offended by however it's being
[54:06] fulfilled. I'm probably going to repeat
[54:08] that a lot. So, but I just I I think
[54:11] let's just trust him more.
[54:15] He says, "You think I'm supporting
[54:16] ignorance?" I'm not. I'm telling you
[54:18] there's a difference between this
[54:19] intellectual age we're living in where
[54:21] the church has been pregnantated with
[54:22] science and all these so-called figured
[54:23] out and everything. You don't figure out
[54:25] God. When them priests had God figured
[54:28] out so perfect they know how the Messiah
[54:30] was going to come, he come so different
[54:32] from what they had figured out. It
[54:34] wasn't scientific. Amen. If you think
[54:36] you can figure out God, you're wrong.
[54:39] Oh, I've got it all charted out and
[54:41] everything. It's good to study the
[54:42] message. Good to put it all together,
[54:43] but don't think just figuring it out
[54:45] gives you a right to say, "God, you owe
[54:47] me an answer." God doesn't owe us
[54:49] anything.
[54:51] This is not a democracy. He's sovereign.
[54:54] Amen. Do you ask him? Absolutely. Do you
[54:57] do you call on his name? Are there
[54:59] things that seem to be lingering that
[55:00] haven't seem to have not been answered?
[55:02] Yes. But does that make me offended? No,
[55:06] because God's timing is perfect. That's
[55:08] right. Amen. Though the though the
[55:10] answer may, you know, seem to be ting,
[55:12] it's on its way. Lord, Amen. You know,
[55:16] Mary and Martha, it was Jesus seemed to
[55:19] be 4 days late, he was right on time,
[55:21] right? They said to him, "Lord, if you'd
[55:23] only been here, you know, our brother
[55:25] would not have died." They weren't
[55:27] offended. They just didn't understand.
[55:29] But you see, he intervened, stepped, you
[55:31] know, stepped on the scene, called them
[55:33] out of the grave. Amen. because they
[55:35] were willing to say, "Lord, if you'd
[55:37] been here, he would have been, you know,
[55:38] he wouldn't have died, but Lord,
[55:39] nevertheless, Lord, at your word, we
[55:41] trust
[55:43] you." Oh my, how could this man being an
[55:47] illegitimate child, where did he go to
[55:49] school at? Where did his education come
[55:50] from? Where did he get his learning? Why
[55:53] you try to teach us you're born in
[55:55] fornications? Oh, for the goodness sake,
[55:57] see the same thing repeated again. See
[55:59] it repeat again. all their religious
[56:01] science. Religious science according to
[56:03] what the their Bible school said. That's
[56:05] the way they want it. That's the way it
[56:06] has to be or it isn't. We to be careful
[56:10] we don't put this message in a mold.
[56:12] That church has to be this way. And if
[56:14] it's not this way, it's not it's not the
[56:17] message. Every church is sovereign.
[56:20] Churches worship different. Amen. The
[56:23] the preacher will preach specific needs
[56:26] for a local body. Right. We've had a
[56:29] oneman ministry that the that his
[56:31] ministry's gone around the world. That's
[56:32] the seventh angels. So there won't be
[56:34] another man standing here that will
[56:36] preach for the entire
[56:37] world. There is a five-fold ministry,
[56:40] but it's for local needs, right? So, so
[56:43] we all sing songs different. We all
[56:45] worship different, right? We all act a
[56:47] little bit different because every
[56:49] church is sovereign. So we can't take
[56:51] the mold of this church and apply it to
[56:54] another church and say that church is
[56:55] wrong. That's right. because they're
[56:57] sovereign in themselves and and and vice
[56:59] versa. Or you can't compare a minister
[57:01] with a minister because they're all
[57:03] built differently. Thank God.
[57:04] Hallelujah. Thank God they're not all
[57:06] like me. I'll just say it like that. I'm
[57:07] glad. Right. I'm glad God is a very has
[57:10] a very diverse body. Amen. That you
[57:13] know, going to Samo, you can't sit there
[57:14] with a western white man attitude saying
[57:16] that's wrong. They're not wrong. They're
[57:18] the bride of Jesus Christ in Samoa.
[57:21] Praise God that God isn't limited to
[57:22] this stupid thing. Amen. We're a body.
[57:25] We should be able to discern one
[57:26] another, seeing the word in one another,
[57:29] right? So, we can't put God in a box.
[57:31] You can't put churches in a box. Amen.
[57:33] Though it may seem very foreign to
[57:35] us, you know, but we can't take a form
[57:39] and get offended when people don't fit
[57:41] the form of our
[57:43] idea. Okay? See, it has to be that way
[57:46] or it isn't it. Hold on.
[57:49] See, there is a there is a wait, I'm
[57:52] just going to jump down
[57:53] to jump down to this if I can find it.
[57:56] Now, he brother Ram says this in the in
[57:59] the in the latest church age book. He
[58:01] says, I want I mean later in church age.
[58:03] I want to give you a right warning here
[58:04] that's concerning the last days. It's
[58:06] because of abounding iniquity, the love
[58:07] of many will wax cold in the latest or
[58:10] last age. Self love and love for
[58:12] material things will take the place of
[58:13] the true love of God. We need to guard
[58:15] against the power of sin in these last
[58:17] days. So many are getting so hard
[58:19] because they haven't realized the effect
[58:21] of this last day spirit. So there's a
[58:24] hardness that can come in because this
[58:25] remember we got to realize this world is
[58:28] still in Lady Oia. We're not immune from
[58:31] its effects,
[58:32] right? The Holy Ghost is greater than
[58:34] than the spirit of this age. We know
[58:36] that. But we got to we got to guard
[58:38] against the hardness that the spirit,
[58:40] you know, the hardness that comes from
[58:42] the spirit of this age where where we
[58:44] get offended. This world is full of
[58:47] offended people because a lady said
[58:49] people it's everything offends
[58:51] everybody. You know that's why it's such
[58:53] a everyone tries to be PC. They don't
[58:55] want to offend anyone but by being PC
[58:57] you offend somebody. So you can't please
[59:00] everybody all the time.
[59:02] You'll always offend some people some of
[59:04] the time. Right? So we got to get over
[59:06] that and move on with life. We got to
[59:07] realize this world is full of offended
[59:09] people. You go on Facebook and all the
[59:11] social media doesn't take very long you
[59:13] found someone who's offended. And
[59:15] because they can sit as a keyboard
[59:17] warrior, they'll sit there and they'll
[59:18] vent all their offense. And does it help
[59:21] the conversation of the world? Does it
[59:22] bring people together? Does it is it
[59:24] even a sharing of ideas to try and, you
[59:26] know, see things maybe from a different
[59:28] angle? Absolutely not. Cuz they're
[59:31] offended. Oh, but I'm a believer. You're
[59:33] still a human being. We can still get
[59:36] offended. But the dangerous thing about
[59:38] you and I is we have quotes and
[59:39] scriptures to justify our offense. So it
[59:42] seems so right, but it's so wrong. So to
[59:45] never ever be
[59:46] carnal carnal see this thing you want to
[59:50] see a a weapon of mass destruction this
[59:54] with a carnal spirit
[59:56] or the message with a carnal spirit
[59:58] that's a weapon of mass destruction and
[1:00:02] it has
[1:00:04] killed nothing wrong with the word but
[1:00:07] it's that carnal spirit that people will
[1:00:09] get offended and they'll hold that
[1:00:12] against their spouse or their family or
[1:00:13] their church your people of their nation
[1:00:15] and they'll get offended and so
[1:00:16] everything they see through is through
[1:00:17] that offense and they can't see God
[1:00:19] work. They can't see him live. They
[1:00:20] can't see his word made manifest and
[1:00:22] they reject the very Messiah in front of
[1:00:24] them. We must never get to that state. I
[1:00:26] mean, we must always never be we should
[1:00:28] live above offense. Can we get offended?
[1:00:31] Yes, we can. We're human. But what do
[1:00:32] you do with that offense? Do you give it
[1:00:34] to the Lord? Do you take it to Calvary
[1:00:35] and let him change it from you? Or do
[1:00:37] you hold on to it and let it fester and
[1:00:38] become a big massive root of business in
[1:00:40] your life? What do you want it to
[1:00:42] become? Amen. It should become a trophy
[1:00:44] of God's grace on your mantle. Amen.
[1:00:47] There was here, yes, I was offended.
[1:00:48] Yes, I was hurt. It cut me very deep.
[1:00:50] But God, rich in mercy, healed me. Amen.
[1:00:53] He molded me. He shaped me. Hallelujah.
[1:00:56] That that thing doesn't bother me
[1:00:57] anymore. Why? Because he took my offense
[1:01:00] that day on Calvary. He redeemed me from
[1:01:02] being offended. Amen. That I can love
[1:01:04] the unlovable.
[1:01:07] Do you think the Lord got offended by
[1:01:09] seeing the sin you'd be born in?
[1:01:11] Did he say, "No, I can't touch those
[1:01:13] people. I'm offended." You know, do you
[1:01:15] think he even gets offended when we know
[1:01:16] when we actually willfully sin? Brother
[1:01:19] says that you can actually willfully
[1:01:21] sin. Do you think he gets
[1:01:23] offended? He looks beyond the offense.
[1:01:26] We're to be to have eagle uh I've been
[1:01:28] speaking about eagle anointing that
[1:01:30] probably this whole year. I don't know.
[1:01:31] But you know, we to have an eagle
[1:01:33] anointing to look beyond the offense. I
[1:01:35] mean, our Lord Jesus says it says the
[1:01:37] joy set before him endured the cross,
[1:01:39] despising the shame. What was that joy?
[1:01:41] You redeemed in eternity. Amen. Say he
[1:01:44] looked beyond the offense of well,
[1:01:45] they're fallen. They're broken. They're
[1:01:47] m Hey, look, we all came to this world
[1:01:49] messed up. We all were born messed up.
[1:01:52] Our first birth messed us up. Did that
[1:01:55] offend him? No. He looked beyond it.
[1:02:00] We want to be like Jesus, don't we? We
[1:02:02] want to be like Jesus. You say, "Well,
[1:02:04] you know, you say, well, but but we
[1:02:06] should know better." Of course, we
[1:02:07] should know better. You know, my family
[1:02:10] should know better. The brothers should
[1:02:11] know better. The sisters should know
[1:02:12] better. They shouldn't treat me this
[1:02:14] way. Sure. But look beyond the offense.
[1:02:17] See, perfect love must be tested. Amen.
[1:02:20] If it's broken in any place, it's not
[1:02:22] perfect love. It's just human love. But
[1:02:24] perfect love will stand the test, stand
[1:02:26] the strain, stand the pressure. It will
[1:02:28] stand. Doesn't matter what weight's put
[1:02:30] upon it. Doesn't matter what hurts put
[1:02:32] upon it. Perfect love will endure. Amen.
[1:02:34] And this is the age of perfect love.
[1:02:36] Amen. And where's that age going to
[1:02:38] where's that love going to be
[1:02:39] manifested? In you and me. Amen. In you
[1:02:42] and me. Perfect love will be displayed
[1:02:44] where where where you can take hurt and
[1:02:46] instead of holding on to it, you can
[1:02:47] give it to the Lord. Is that person
[1:02:49] changed? Possibly not. Is their attitude
[1:02:52] the same towards me? Probably. But you
[1:02:54] can still love them. Perfect love
[1:02:57] doesn't look at how you treat first.
[1:02:59] See, Jesus never came to you and said,
[1:03:02] "Look, this is what I'm going to do for
[1:03:04] you. I'm going to fix you. I'm going to
[1:03:07] pick you up. I'm going to heal you. I
[1:03:10] put my faith in your soul. I'm going to
[1:03:12] make you in my image. Do you mind if I
[1:03:14] do that? He didn't ask you. He did it
[1:03:18] before you even realized. And that's
[1:03:20] what perfect love is. Not looking for
[1:03:22] the response it gets back. It loves
[1:03:24] anyway.
[1:03:28] Well, they spit in my face. They spit in
[1:03:30] his face. What did he do? What some of
[1:03:32] the last last words that came out of
[1:03:34] those blessed lips? Father, forgive
[1:03:36] them. They don't know what they
[1:03:39] do. You say, "Well, they should have.
[1:03:41] They uh I know I've said it before, but
[1:03:43] you know, you think, well, they do know
[1:03:44] what they're doing. They planned that.
[1:03:46] They hatched the plan. They executed the
[1:03:48] plan there is on the cross, but they
[1:03:50] didn't realize who he was." See, and
[1:03:52] that's why offense comes. It's because
[1:03:54] of the
[1:03:55] humanity that God works through many
[1:03:58] times.
[1:04:04] Like you look at this here, John the
[1:04:05] Bapt, this speaks of John the Baptist,
[1:04:07] "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith
[1:04:09] your God, speak ye comfortably to
[1:04:11] Jerusalem, and cry unto her that her
[1:04:14] warfare is accomplished, that her
[1:04:15] iniquity is pardoned, for she hath
[1:04:17] received of the Lord's hand double for
[1:04:19] all her sins." The voice of him that
[1:04:21] crith in the wilderness, prepare ye the
[1:04:22] way of the Lord, make straight in the
[1:04:24] desert a highway for our God. Every
[1:04:26] valley shall be exalted, every mountain
[1:04:28] and hill shall be made low, and the
[1:04:30] crooked shall be made straight, and the
[1:04:31] rough places plain, and the glory of the
[1:04:33] Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh
[1:04:35] shall see it, for the mouth of the Lord
[1:04:38] has spoken it. So So this is the the
[1:04:41] prophecy of John the Baptist coming.
[1:04:44] Now, if you looked at the fulfillment of
[1:04:47] this, it seems very different to the
[1:04:49] prophecy. And the fact is every mountain
[1:04:52] was not literally made low and every
[1:04:55] valley made high. There's not a big
[1:04:56] geograph geographical leveling, right?
[1:05:01] And the fulfillment of it was a a
[1:05:02] fuzzyfaced preacher who don't know if he
[1:05:06] took a bath in the day of his life. Now
[1:05:08] Jesus said, "This is the greatest man
[1:05:10] that's ever been born." That's right.
[1:05:11] That's John the Baptist. He said that
[1:05:13] there's been none like him. The greatest
[1:05:15] man that's ever born outside of the
[1:05:17] Messiah was John the Baptist. This is
[1:05:19] what Jesus said, right? And here's a man
[1:05:21] never took a bath in his life eating
[1:05:23] honey and and and and and and locust
[1:05:25] camel skin clothes and he's standing
[1:05:27] there on the banks of the Jordan
[1:05:29] preaching to preaching to the um to the
[1:05:32] masses. Points out the Pharisees saying,
[1:05:33] "You generation of snakes and the axes
[1:05:36] laid to the root of the tree and all
[1:05:37] these things." And here was the
[1:05:39] fulfillment. He was the voice of one
[1:05:41] crying in the wilderness. He knew he was
[1:05:44] that cuz they asked him, "Who are you?"
[1:05:45] And Christ says, "No, I'm not even
[1:05:46] worthy to undo his sandals." Well, who
[1:05:49] are you then? I'm the voice of one
[1:05:50] crying in the wilderness. So, he knew
[1:05:53] his position in the word. Do we not know
[1:05:55] our position in the word as the bride of
[1:05:57] Jesus Christ? We do know our position,
[1:05:59] right? I pray you do. Amen. You know,
[1:06:01] we're not here haphazardly being
[1:06:02] believers. No. God before the foundation
[1:06:05] of the world ordained you to be his
[1:06:06] bride. Amen. Ordain that you're part of
[1:06:08] him. Amen. Ordain that you're the word
[1:06:10] made flesh today. Just like John the
[1:06:13] Baptist, he knew his position. But then
[1:06:15] after he pointed out the lamb of God, he
[1:06:16] says, "Now he must increase and I must
[1:06:20] decrease." He didn't know what that
[1:06:22] decrease would
[1:06:25] entail because it came to a it came to a
[1:06:28] point now where he found himself in this
[1:06:31] condition. He's in prison. And the
[1:06:34] reason he he he he ended up in prison
[1:06:36] because he preached truth. He said to um
[1:06:40] um what's his name? Herold. Yeah. Um
[1:06:43] that guy Herod, there we
[1:06:46] go. He said it's not lawful for you to
[1:06:48] have Philip's wife, Herodius. I think
[1:06:51] it's Philip's wife. I might might be
[1:06:52] wrong. Anyway, he ended up in prison
[1:06:53] because of that. And so here he is
[1:06:56] actually living out the decrease. He
[1:06:58] doesn't realize this is what it's going
[1:07:00] to be, but this is where it entails. And
[1:07:02] what happens is is he ends up in this
[1:07:05] condition. And then he sends his
[1:07:08] disciples to the Lord. Now you think
[1:07:10] about this. Here is the man that saw the
[1:07:13] spirit of God descend upon the Lord
[1:07:14] Jesus and says, "This is that. This is
[1:07:17] him. This is the lamb of God that takes
[1:07:18] away the sin of the world." He finds
[1:07:20] himself in a prison. He doesn't
[1:07:23] understand what's going on. We've all
[1:07:25] been there.
[1:07:27] You're like, "Man, God just fulfilled a
[1:07:29] big part of his word in my life." And
[1:07:31] you find yourself in a prison. You find
[1:07:33] yourself in the opposite place that you
[1:07:34] thought you'd end up in. Think, man,
[1:07:36] what is going on? Have I done wrong?
[1:07:38] Have I sinned? Have I, you know, have I?
[1:07:40] No, he didn't do anything
[1:07:42] wrong. He did not a single thing wrong,
[1:07:44] but he ended up himself in prison. How
[1:07:46] many times we can be in a prison in
[1:07:48] here? Trouble can grip us in such a way
[1:07:50] cuz we're thinking, man, this is not
[1:07:52] what I
[1:07:53] expected. But then and then and then he
[1:07:55] got to such a low point, brother said
[1:07:57] his eagle eyes dimmed
[1:07:59] over. And then he and then he um sends
[1:08:02] two
[1:08:03] disciples here Jesus. And and now John
[1:08:06] had heard in prison the works of Christ.
[1:08:08] He sent two of his disciples and said
[1:08:10] unto him, "Art thou he that should come
[1:08:12] or do we look for
[1:08:14] another?" What a question. You think of
[1:08:18] the experience that John's been through.
[1:08:20] But he's got to such a point cuz he's
[1:08:22] he's actually in his decrease. He's
[1:08:24] fulfilled this part of the scripture and
[1:08:26] he's in prison now. He's thinking, "Did
[1:08:27] I even do right? Did I even fulfill what
[1:08:30] the Lord has allotted me to do?" Now, I
[1:08:32] want to say this from the get-go. We
[1:08:34] ain't finished. No. We're taking a
[1:08:37] rapture. Amen. Right? But there'll be
[1:08:39] points in your walk you're thinking,
[1:08:40] man, have I stepped off the path
[1:08:41] somewhere? Have I done something wrong?
[1:08:43] And it's good to ask, Lord, help me,
[1:08:45] Lord. Where, you know, where am I? But
[1:08:47] nine times, 99 times out of 100, I say,
[1:08:50] you're on the you're on the path. You're
[1:08:52] walking with your shepherd, but it looks
[1:08:54] very dark. It looks very dingy. It feels
[1:08:56] like you're in a prison. And you begin
[1:08:57] to second guessess yourself. I say those
[1:09:00] times when you've turned over every
[1:09:01] stone and there's no sin. There's
[1:09:03] nothing to put right. And if there is,
[1:09:04] you put it right. Stand. Amen. Stand.
[1:09:08] It's like the Apostle Paul would say in
[1:09:09] Ephesians, you know, stand in the evil
[1:09:12] day. Put on the whole armor of God and
[1:09:14] having done all to stand, stand
[1:09:16] therefore. Amen. So, this is the evil
[1:09:18] day we're living in. So, it's not a time
[1:09:19] to quit. Not a time to second guess.
[1:09:21] Stand in the word. Amen. Find your
[1:09:23] position in the word and stand there. It
[1:09:25] doesn't matter what comes against you,
[1:09:26] you can stand because you're standing on
[1:09:28] the word of God. You're not standing on
[1:09:29] your idea. You're not standing on a
[1:09:31] feeling. You're not standing on a group.
[1:09:32] Amen. You're standing on the word alone.
[1:09:34] Amen. And if you can stand in that
[1:09:36] position, hallelujah, God's ordained you
[1:09:39] to stand. Amen. It's like he like God
[1:09:41] said to Moses, "There's a place by me."
[1:09:43] Amen. There's a place. Come stand upon
[1:09:45] the rock. I'll show you my glory.
[1:09:47] There's a place by me, friends. And
[1:09:48] there's a place by our Lord that's
[1:09:50] ordained for you to stand. Amen. So
[1:09:52] never ever begin to worry. Amen. Trouble
[1:09:54] comes your way. We should expect
[1:09:55] trouble. You know, a big part of the
[1:09:57] preaching of the first church was
[1:09:59] through great tribulation, we shall
[1:10:01] enter the kingdom of God. So, welcome to
[1:10:03] this glorious plan of redemption, but
[1:10:05] you're in for a road of trouble. But the
[1:10:10] the great Lord of glory won't leave you
[1:10:11] on that road by yourself. Amen. He
[1:10:13] allows things to come into your life cuz
[1:10:15] he wants to prove himself. I mean, the
[1:10:17] devil's such he he's so clever, he's
[1:10:20] foolish. Because if he realized that
[1:10:24] he's only God is allowing him to touch
[1:10:26] us and affect us for us to get
[1:10:29] testimonies of God's power and for God
[1:10:32] to prove his word in our lives. So the
[1:10:34] devil's actually enabling us to give us
[1:10:38] testimonies that we can worship God in a
[1:10:40] far greater way than before the trial
[1:10:43] ever struck. Hallelujah.
[1:10:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:49] See how God don't waste anything.
[1:10:52] Don't waste anything either. Don't sit
[1:10:54] in a
[1:10:55] prison saying, "Why me? Why this
[1:10:58] circumstance?" God wants to use it. God
[1:11:01] wants to use it. God wants to use John
[1:11:03] as a
[1:11:06] testimony. He wants to use us as a
[1:11:08] testimony, too. Many times we think it's
[1:11:11] preaching from the rooftops.
[1:11:14] Sometimes it's that.
[1:11:16] God, you get the glory. Whatever you
[1:11:18] want to do in my life, Lord, I'm
[1:11:20] satisfied.
[1:11:23] Then he says, "Now go tell John." Jesus
[1:11:25] answered and said unto them, "Go and
[1:11:26] show John again those things which you
[1:11:28] do hear and see. The blind receive their
[1:11:30] sight. The lame walk, the lepers are
[1:11:32] cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are
[1:11:34] raised up, the poor of the gospel preach
[1:11:35] to them, and blessed is he whosoever
[1:11:37] shall not be offended in me." So John,
[1:11:41] you're blessed if you're not offended.
[1:11:43] You may not understand what's going on,
[1:11:44] John, but if you're not offended, you're
[1:11:46] blessed.
[1:11:47] I say the same thing with you and I.
[1:11:50] Amen. This this word offended has many
[1:11:52] I'm just going to throw this in here as
[1:11:53] I it's got many different meanings, but
[1:11:56] it comes from the Greek word which we
[1:11:58] get the English word scandal from. This
[1:12:01] offended and so it means to put a
[1:12:03] stumbling block or impediment in the way
[1:12:05] upon which another may trip and fall. It
[1:12:08] means to entice to sin, to cause a
[1:12:10] person to begin to distrust and desert
[1:12:12] one whom he ought to trust and obey. How
[1:12:16] many times do we take our own life into
[1:12:18] our own hands because of offense? We get
[1:12:21] offended at God and what do we do?
[1:12:24] Subconsciously we do because we we are
[1:12:26] surprised by how things go. So what do
[1:12:28] we do? We take life into our our own
[1:12:30] hands. We forget that that's what caused
[1:12:34] us all the trouble is having life in our
[1:12:37] own hands. Like the, you know, like the
[1:12:39] disciples, they're sailing on the Sea of
[1:12:41] Galilee. They raised there. They were on
[1:12:42] that boat all their lives virtually, you
[1:12:44] know, raised up from a boy. And, you
[1:12:45] know, they're master um sailors. But the
[1:12:48] one who made the storm is in the back of
[1:12:50] the boat, but they try to take that boat
[1:12:52] in their own hands cuz they've done it
[1:12:54] before. But but what did it bring them
[1:12:56] to? Master, don't you care that we
[1:12:58] perish? Yeah. See, they got an attitude
[1:13:01] that the very Lord of glory who's asleep
[1:13:03] in the boat doesn't care if they sink or
[1:13:05] drown or whatever happens to them. He
[1:13:07] did care, but they had to wake him up to
[1:13:09] calm the storm. I mean, they had to
[1:13:11] surrender their abilities and the storm
[1:13:13] and their situation into his hands.
[1:13:15] Amen. And once they did, what did he
[1:13:17] say? Peace be still. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:19] Glory. We're going to do the same thing.
[1:13:21] Don't be offended. I think they got a
[1:13:23] bit offended at him. Don't you care?
[1:13:26] Don't you see what we're going? Aren't
[1:13:27] you, you know, are you so indifferent to
[1:13:29] this trial I'm going through? No. God
[1:13:31] knows and cares. You got to call him on
[1:13:32] the scene. You got to wake up the Lord.
[1:13:34] Wake him up in your
[1:13:36] ship. Amen.
[1:13:39] Praise the Lord. It's to be offended in
[1:13:40] one to see in another what I disapprove
[1:13:43] of and what hinders me from
[1:13:44] acknowledging his authority. To cause
[1:13:46] one to judge unfavorably or or unjustly
[1:13:49] of another. Since uh since one who
[1:13:51] stumbles or those foot gets entangled
[1:13:54] feels annoyed. I highlighted that one
[1:13:57] first. We just get annoyed. That's an
[1:13:59] offense. We can't be annoyed at how God
[1:14:02] directs our lives. The main thing is
[1:14:04] he's leading.
[1:14:06] I'm happy about that.
[1:14:09] Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, here's
[1:14:13] John. He's in prison. He gets offended.
[1:14:17] Oh, yeah. He gets upset. Doesn't
[1:14:18] understand what's going on. But you see,
[1:14:21] because it's the it's how his decrease
[1:14:23] was fulfilled is what he did not fathom
[1:14:26] would happen.
[1:14:28] Now, it's how we see God live can offend
[1:14:31] us. It's a strange thing, but believers
[1:14:34] get offended when the spirit can move.
[1:14:35] Some believers can get offended, which
[1:14:37] is not a good thing. We should be happy.
[1:14:39] We should want to see God move from
[1:14:40] front to back, left and right, touch
[1:14:42] someone's life, right? We should never
[1:14:44] be offended when things appear not the
[1:14:46] form that we think it should be in.
[1:14:48] Right? So, here comes here comes David
[1:14:50] now. Hallelujah. Here comes David now,
[1:14:53] the king of Israel. He's an adopted son
[1:14:55] of God. He's he's uh finally the ark of
[1:14:58] the covenant is coming into his city.
[1:15:00] And he begins to cut up a little bit. He
[1:15:02] gets a little bit happy. Amen. Because
[1:15:05] here's here's the ark that symbolizes
[1:15:06] his God. He's always had this hunger.
[1:15:08] Lord, I want to dwell in your house,
[1:15:09] Lord. I want to be before your courts,
[1:15:11] Lord. I want to be in your presence. And
[1:15:13] here's the ark that symbolizes the word,
[1:15:15] the presence of God that's been lost
[1:15:16] among the Philistines. It's been in the
[1:15:18] um um farm, you know, it's been away,
[1:15:21] but now it's home. So, he begins to
[1:15:23] rejoice. He begins to dance. He begins
[1:15:25] to praise praise the Lord. But the
[1:15:27] thing, his worship caused offense.
[1:15:31] Amen. It caused offense. His own wife
[1:15:34] got offended. And it's always it's
[1:15:36] always it's always those closest to us
[1:15:39] because they know our humanity.
[1:15:42] they can get offended like Jesus um I've
[1:15:44] got it here somewhere but you know he
[1:15:46] went to the oh we'll get to it soon but
[1:15:48] but you know even those in Nazareth that
[1:15:50] he was raised in that city and the
[1:15:52] people knew him they got offended at
[1:15:54] it the great Messiah came out of their
[1:15:57] their hometown they were offended
[1:15:58] because they knew they knew where he was
[1:16:00] born and they knew uh his well you know
[1:16:04] whatever steps or whatever it's called
[1:16:05] you know Mary and Joseph they they saw
[1:16:07] him as a boy but they got offended
[1:16:09] because they got caught up in the
[1:16:10] humanity. Yeah,
[1:16:13] David I mean McCall here you see see
[1:16:16] David returned after all this rejoicing
[1:16:18] in the ark coming in of dancing before
[1:16:20] the Lord in the spirit having a real
[1:16:22] jubilee service praising God then David
[1:16:25] returned to bless his household so who
[1:16:27] did he come to bless his wife he's come
[1:16:30] to share the goodness of what's just
[1:16:32] happened he's come to bless them maybe
[1:16:33] the you know I believe the anointing's
[1:16:35] still upon him and now and now here
[1:16:36] comes here comes the anointed king into
[1:16:38] the house he's here to bless But then,
[1:16:41] but then McCall says, you know, oh,
[1:16:43] you've done shamelessly. You've
[1:16:44] uncovered yourself. You've embarrassed
[1:16:46] me. You have not you have not worshiped
[1:16:48] how you've worshiped before. Well, how
[1:16:50] could you worship the same way when the
[1:16:53] art comes into your house? How can you
[1:16:55] not praise how could your praise be the
[1:16:57] same when the word becomes revealed?
[1:16:59] Amen. How can your praise be the same
[1:17:01] when you see your name in the lamb's
[1:17:03] book of life? Amen. When the message
[1:17:04] becomes a reality. When you see that the
[1:17:06] same God with the prophet is the same
[1:17:08] God with you. How can your worship stay
[1:17:10] the same? It cannot. Amen. Because
[1:17:12] revelation's coming to your soul. Amen.
[1:17:14] You realize my name's on the book and
[1:17:16] nothing can take it off. Amen. That I'm
[1:17:18] part of God. I came from God. I'm going
[1:17:20] back to God. Amen. This message is sent
[1:17:22] to catch me away. Amen. Out of the
[1:17:25] destruction of this world. How can your
[1:17:27] worship remain the same? I tell you, it
[1:17:29] cannot remain the same. It's impossible.
[1:17:31] Hallelujah. Sure. Yeah. Because from
[1:17:33] your heart, you say, "Well, I'm not a
[1:17:35] loud person." That's fine. Let the word
[1:17:38] affect you. Amen. Loud, quiet. I don't
[1:17:41] care. Be you. Be you. Be free to be you.
[1:17:45] Amen. Don't Don't be reserved because
[1:17:46] it's feel expected. And don't be loud
[1:17:48] because it's expected. None of that's
[1:17:50] expected. Amen. A freedom of worship, a
[1:17:53] freedom of religion is here. Amen. To
[1:17:55] worship God in spirit and in truth. You
[1:17:57] just be you in the sight of the Lord.
[1:18:01] Amen. So David was being David.
[1:18:06] But McCall did not like David being
[1:18:07] David because her mold, her expectation
[1:18:10] of the king was to be dignified, you
[1:18:12] know, just this as the ark went past
[1:18:14] something, you know. Oh my, let's get
[1:18:17] that away.
[1:18:21] I'm going to stop that. Okay. But but
[1:18:24] you see, she was offended. She missed
[1:18:27] the whole picture of what was happening
[1:18:29] because of the humanity that she was so
[1:18:32] focused upon. instead of celebrating.
[1:18:34] See, this is this is the big key in
[1:18:36] life. If you want to be blessed by God,
[1:18:38] be happy when he blesses others.
[1:18:41] Amen. You want to you want to prosper in
[1:18:43] the Lord, be happy when he blesses and
[1:18:46] answers other people's prayers and
[1:18:48] genuinely rally around that and you'll
[1:18:51] be blessed. If you don't want to be
[1:18:52] blessed, be like McCall.
[1:18:56] That's it. It's really that simple. Be
[1:18:58] offended when the spirit falls on
[1:19:00] someone. be annoyed when it's maybe, you
[1:19:02] know, you see some young person get free
[1:19:04] in the spirit and don't get offended at
[1:19:06] that. We should celebrate that. They
[1:19:08] deserve it. You know, I've been thinking
[1:19:10] quite often, they deserve a Holy Ghost
[1:19:12] book of Acts revival. Our young people
[1:19:15] deserve it. The old people, we all
[1:19:16] deserve it. Amen. But our young people
[1:19:17] especially, we should live such a life
[1:19:19] that doesn't cause offense. Amen. That
[1:19:21] when they see the message, they don't
[1:19:23] get it confused with your carnality.
[1:19:25] Amen. That when they see Jesus Christ,
[1:19:27] they can't say, "Well, my parents are
[1:19:28] like this, but the words like this. we
[1:19:30] should be the same and God help us that
[1:19:32] they can look beyond our humanity and
[1:19:35] our when we cuz we have ups and downs,
[1:19:37] lefts and rights and all kinds of
[1:19:38] things. But may they be able to look
[1:19:39] beyond that and may they say, "Well, you
[1:19:42] know, and look beyond that and say, I
[1:19:44] want what daddy's got. I want what
[1:19:46] mama's got. I want it in my life. It's
[1:19:48] for me. Lord, get a hold of my life and
[1:19:50] take over." Amen. Because we are God's
[1:19:53] advertising to our children. So may we
[1:19:56] not cause offense
[1:19:59] in that way because you got to realize
[1:20:01] the life of God has an
[1:20:03] effect, right? It made it made Paul or
[1:20:07] Saul become a persecutor of the church.
[1:20:10] It had an
[1:20:11] effect. God turned him around. Brother A
[1:20:14] said that that was a man under
[1:20:16] conviction. Amen. So never be offended
[1:20:19] where it looks like it's been just blown
[1:20:20] back in your face. Say thank you Lord.
[1:20:24] The word has an effect. Hallelujah. The
[1:20:26] word is rubbing. The word is scratching.
[1:20:29] The word is digging. Is The word is
[1:20:31] irritating. Amen. As long as it causes
[1:20:34] an effect. If it's just water off a
[1:20:36] duck's back, that's when you really got
[1:20:37] to pray, right? Because eventually,
[1:20:39] remember, a duck will get annoyed by
[1:20:41] water eventually.
[1:20:43] Amen. But you know, as long as the word
[1:20:45] has an effect, don't be offended by what
[1:20:48] you see.
[1:20:50] Amen. You say, "Well, it's pretty bad."
[1:20:52] Praise God.
[1:20:54] It's going backwards, is it? You look at
[1:20:57] Saul persecuting the church and
[1:20:58] everything he did. You say, "Man, that
[1:21:00] guy has just crossed the line. He's out
[1:21:02] of it." Was
[1:21:03] he? Why are we so quick to cast people
[1:21:07] away? Why do we get offended at someone
[1:21:09] who's just under
[1:21:13] conviction? Amen. Jesus would Jesus
[1:21:16] would come into it. You know, it's
[1:21:17] amazing when you look at the miracles
[1:21:18] the Lord did how many times he did
[1:21:20] something on the Sabbath day
[1:21:24] on. Praise the Lord. You know, but the
[1:21:27] thing is a religious spirit cannot
[1:21:30] stand God actually fulfilling his word.
[1:21:34] A religious spirit is one who gets the
[1:21:36] most offended.
[1:21:38] You look at America today,
[1:21:41] offended. Evangelicals, they're offended
[1:21:44] and they have pulled way off to one
[1:21:45] side. I'm neither left or right.
[1:21:48] I'm down the middle. You can't put me in
[1:21:51] those boxes. Right. I don't I don't
[1:21:54] identify with that. I identify with the
[1:21:56] word of God. I mean, and and to me, both
[1:21:58] of those are ditches. I don't like
[1:22:00] walking in ditches. I don't like walking
[1:22:03] in the gutter. Everything gets all the
[1:22:04] trash gets washed there. Let's stay down
[1:22:06] the middle of the road. You say, "Well,
[1:22:08] you might get run over." This is a
[1:22:10] oneway road up to glory. Stay in the
[1:22:13] middle. Don't get pulled by those
[1:22:15] things. It'll try and pull you, but say,
[1:22:17] "No, you you do what you want to do. I'm
[1:22:19] walking on with the Lord." But you see
[1:22:21] now they got a See, isn't it amazing?
[1:22:24] This woman was bound by by a spirit for
[1:22:26] 18 years. Who's who's younger than 18
[1:22:30] here? We got a We got a few people.
[1:22:35] Amen. Amen, brother Colin. Yes, sir. But
[1:22:37] you see, she was bound longer than you
[1:22:40] guys some of some of us have been alive.
[1:22:44] Sabbath after Sabbath, hunched over,
[1:22:46] probably got worse and worse and
[1:22:47] couldn't even bend herself up. And you
[1:22:49] know, the um you know, no doubt the um
[1:22:53] uh rabbi would have maybe read about the
[1:22:55] great miracles of God and his healing
[1:22:57] acts through the prophets and all these
[1:22:58] things. And here comes here comes this
[1:23:00] woman bowed up that couldn't even lift
[1:23:02] herself up. But but then when Jesus saw
[1:23:04] her, he called her to him. Amen. Said
[1:23:08] unto woman, thou art loose from thine
[1:23:10] infirmity. and he he laid his hands on
[1:23:12] her. Immediately she was was made
[1:23:14] straight and glorified God. Do you think
[1:23:17] that caused a revival to erupt in that
[1:23:19] synagogue? Do you think it caused the
[1:23:20] people to have a jubilation and praise
[1:23:22] the Lord? And I know you've already read
[1:23:23] the next verse. You know the answer to
[1:23:25] these questions. But you see, you know,
[1:23:27] there was not this great glory.
[1:23:30] Hallelujah. Amen. Sister Elizabeth can
[1:23:33] stand straight or whatever her name is.
[1:23:34] You know, you know, they're not bowed by
[1:23:36] this problem anymore. That they can run
[1:23:38] and leap. There was none of that. He had
[1:23:41] indignation. That's a lot of syllables.
[1:23:43] He was unhappy. He got offended. How
[1:23:46] dare you disrupt our religious service?
[1:23:53] May we be the opposite?
[1:23:56] May we not get offended?
[1:23:58] Because if you ask this leader of the
[1:24:00] synagogue before the service, "Do you
[1:24:02] want to see God fulfill his word?" He
[1:24:05] would say, "Yes, absolutely. We want to
[1:24:08] see Jehovah God again. We've heard great
[1:24:10] things. We want to see him again. And
[1:24:11] one day he will. But then Jehovah
[1:24:13] becomes, you know, God became man,
[1:24:15] right? Jehovah became flesh, Jesus
[1:24:17] Christ. And and then and he fulfills his
[1:24:20] word in his church and he got mad. He
[1:24:22] got offended. Why? Because it did not
[1:24:25] come the way he
[1:24:28] expected. Humanity is such a blinding
[1:24:31] thing. So I'm I'm kind of nearly done,
[1:24:33] but at the same time, we'll see. Now,
[1:24:35] David, David, now we often think about
[1:24:37] David. He's chosen of God. He's elected
[1:24:40] of God. In him is to be a king. And
[1:24:41] that's why he got anointed. And you
[1:24:43] know, he was, you know, in him was that
[1:24:44] kingship already. But the anointing of
[1:24:46] God had to come upon him to express that
[1:24:48] kingship. We say, "Praise God, David was
[1:24:50] chosen." We say, "Praise God. Aren't you
[1:24:52] glad you're a David?" And the church
[1:24:54] says, "Amen." Amen. We're a vindicated
[1:24:57] prophet of God poured his whole horn of
[1:24:59] anointing oil, all the strength, amen,
[1:25:01] of the of the word upon you. Amen. To
[1:25:03] express, to bring out as the bride of
[1:25:05] Jesus Christ. But now, what about his
[1:25:07] brothers?
[1:25:09] Because remember, David wasn't first in
[1:25:12] line. Samuel didn't say to Jesse, "Look,
[1:25:14] you've got a son named David. He's going
[1:25:16] to be anointed king. Bring him here."
[1:25:17] No, he said, "One of your sons." And
[1:25:20] Jesse did not even think of David. He
[1:25:22] did not even consider him. And so, the
[1:25:24] firstborn who looked like a king, even
[1:25:26] Samuel thought, "This is him." And God
[1:25:28] says, "No, it's not him." So, seven
[1:25:30] times God says, "No." And they're
[1:25:33] standing there to one side. Then finally
[1:25:35] Samuel says to Jesse, "Do you have
[1:25:36] another son?" And he's like, "Oh yeah, I
[1:25:38] actually do. Where is he?" "Oh, go get
[1:25:41] him." He's He's with the sheep. Had to
[1:25:43] go bring him in. I don't know how much
[1:25:44] time would have lagged between the call
[1:25:46] and him coming, but that doesn't matter.
[1:25:47] But then finally, he comes into the eyes
[1:25:50] of Samuel. And the Lord says, "This is
[1:25:51] him." Amen. And he takes out the
[1:25:53] anointing oil, anoints him. And the
[1:25:55] prince of God was with David from that
[1:25:56] day forward. So no doubt they would have
[1:25:58] felt the presence of God when their
[1:25:59] brother was anointed. But were they
[1:26:01] happy? They were offended. Why him? Why
[1:26:03] not
[1:26:04] me? What a foolish thing to be offended
[1:26:09] when God identifies a gift in a family.
[1:26:12] That should be the time of great
[1:26:14] rallying. That's why I say if you want
[1:26:16] to be blessed, be happy when God blesses
[1:26:17] someone else. That should be a time of
[1:26:19] celebration. Those brothers should have
[1:26:21] lifted up their brother on their
[1:26:22] shoulder saying, "Our little brother
[1:26:23] David's going to be king. God's anointed
[1:26:25] him. Praise the Lord." Amen. We're on
[1:26:27] into a different dispensation. He's
[1:26:29] going to raise him up. God said he's a
[1:26:31] man after his own heart. But they're
[1:26:36] offended. They are offended because even
[1:26:38] when David came down and he was about he
[1:26:41] was about the same kind of age when he
[1:26:42] fought
[1:26:43] Goliath, Elab the elder said, "You're
[1:26:46] just naughty. We know the naughtiness of
[1:26:48] thine heart. He was offended. He was
[1:26:51] resentful that his brother got chosen
[1:26:53] above himself." Listen, friends, we all
[1:26:56] have a different part of the body.
[1:26:58] Okay, brother Ram says it's like, you
[1:27:00] know, like playing American football,
[1:27:02] you don't tackle the man with the ball.
[1:27:05] You defend him. That's right. Right. And
[1:27:07] it doesn't matter what part of the
[1:27:09] body's packing the ball. I want to
[1:27:11] block. That's right. I want to defend
[1:27:13] that person. I want to gather them in
[1:27:15] prayer. I want to encourage them. That's
[1:27:17] why I say, friends, you can do it.
[1:27:19] You're packing the ball. All of you are
[1:27:22] packing the ball. Amen. We're all on the
[1:27:24] same team. Amen. Let's just run over the
[1:27:27] devil. Amen. Like like John Lommo did do
[1:27:29] with the English guys back at that World
[1:27:31] Cup. Let's just run run right over him.
[1:27:33] Amen. Let's not be offended at the
[1:27:35] opposition cuz they're going to lose.
[1:27:36] They've already lost. But you're packing
[1:27:38] the ball. I mean, you're packing the
[1:27:40] anointed word. Amen. So why not support
[1:27:42] one another? I mean, just say, imagine
[1:27:44] imagine one of these young men here is
[1:27:47] is literally one of the greatest
[1:27:49] ministers that will ever shake this age.
[1:27:52] What if
[1:27:54] maybe he's just a one-year-old? What if
[1:27:56] it's Ezekiel? I just use him. He's the
[1:28:00] greatest minister will ever strike this
[1:28:01] age in the five-fold ministry is him.
[1:28:03] And he literally turns millions of souls
[1:28:06] to the Lord. Oh, but it's the end of the
[1:28:08] age. And will that happen? It could.
[1:28:10] Let's not put God in a box, right? Sure,
[1:28:13] it'll be a few number, but there's 8
[1:28:14] billion on the earth, you know, of of
[1:28:17] people. But imagine that. And we see him
[1:28:19] raised up and we see him. He's naughty.
[1:28:21] He's a boy. And he starts act. But then
[1:28:23] one day, God begins to get a hold of his
[1:28:25] life. And he comes to the altar. He goes
[1:28:27] to a youth camp. He comes back changes
[1:28:29] just a difference about him. And he
[1:28:30] begins to mature and grow in the Lord
[1:28:32] like these young men have. Right. And
[1:28:34] then he begins there something in him
[1:28:36] just begins to speak and express. And
[1:28:38] he's young, but like man, where did he
[1:28:39] get that from? That's right. What will
[1:28:42] we get offended?
[1:28:43] No. We will rally around that. We will
[1:28:47] support that. Maybe one of these
[1:28:49] youngsters's greatest singers to ever
[1:28:51] strike this age, write songs like and a
[1:28:54] whole album sitting in a song service.
[1:28:55] Yeah, like brother Isaac does, you know,
[1:28:57] will we rally around that? I'm just
[1:28:59] going to point you, we should rally
[1:29:00] around gifts like that. We should
[1:29:02] support them.
[1:29:04] And now I I believe we all do, but I
[1:29:07] want to encourage you. Never get
[1:29:09] offended or resentful at someone that
[1:29:12] God has made more gifted than you.
[1:29:15] Celebrate it. That's why I celebrate all
[1:29:17] you. So, praise God. Thank you, Lord,
[1:29:19] for these gifts that God can just use
[1:29:21] and you just you just get to enjoy it.
[1:29:24] Lord, but you see, they did not they
[1:29:27] were offended that their brother that's
[1:29:29] to me that's insanity. Oh, so your
[1:29:31] brother's going to become king. Now,
[1:29:33] what does that make you part of the
[1:29:36] royal family? Where you going to move
[1:29:37] to? Jerusalem. Cuz he falls in all the
[1:29:40] palaces, all these things, and now
[1:29:41] you're going to get the benefits. Why
[1:29:42] would you be offended at that? That's
[1:29:44] right.
[1:29:46] We must not be offended at
[1:29:49] anything. Amen. You see,
[1:29:53] now the thing is people get offended
[1:29:55] because they want to keep the status
[1:29:57] quo. That's a religious spirit. Here
[1:30:01] comes this last time Jesus is at
[1:30:03] Bethany. Mary comes behind him or comes
[1:30:06] to him, anoints him with this great um
[1:30:09] you know you know with this anointing
[1:30:10] oil. And it says his disciples saw it.
[1:30:13] had indignation in their heart saying to
[1:30:15] what purpose is this waste? Now if you
[1:30:17] go read the account in the book of John
[1:30:19] that eagle anointing identifies that
[1:30:21] this this indignation came from Judas
[1:30:25] because it says that Judas said this but
[1:30:27] here in Matthew it says all the
[1:30:28] disciples said this. So where did that
[1:30:30] influence come from? Judas. Why was he
[1:30:32] offended at this? Because he was a thief
[1:30:34] and he could have took taken that money
[1:30:36] pocketed a bit of it and gave the rest
[1:30:38] to the poor. But see, Judas was offended
[1:30:40] because because God was in a time of
[1:30:43] transition. Amen. He was his earthly
[1:30:45] ministry was coming to an end. Amen.
[1:30:47] Calvary was right in front of him. Amen.
[1:30:50] Pentecost wasn't that far away where God
[1:30:52] would come and dwell in his church.
[1:30:53] There was a great there was a great time
[1:30:55] of transition. But Judas did not want
[1:30:57] the transition. Friends, we got to go
[1:31:00] beyond church anity. We're to go beyond
[1:31:03] God a prophet and long hair, long faces,
[1:31:05] long skirts. We're to go beyond those
[1:31:07] things. And we got to into the realities
[1:31:09] of God like never before. Amen. We're
[1:31:11] not here to plateau and say, "Well,
[1:31:13] that's just how it is." And and I miss
[1:31:14] the good old days. The good old days
[1:31:16] were good, but we're in the good now
[1:31:18] days. Amen. I'd rather be now than 13
[1:31:21] years ago when we started or whenever it
[1:31:23] was. You know, I'd rather be right now.
[1:31:25] Amen. That's why I'm so glad, you know,
[1:31:27] you I know I get nostalgic when I when
[1:31:29] we go to camp and I talk about our first
[1:31:31] camp, but I don't wish I was back there.
[1:31:33] I just thank God for what he did there,
[1:31:35] but I'm so thankful what he's doing
[1:31:36] today. Amen. But you see Judas, he was
[1:31:39] upset about this because he she anointed
[1:31:42] Jesus for his burial, right? So she
[1:31:45] anointed the word for what the word was
[1:31:47] about to accomplish. She didn't ask
[1:31:50] permission. She did not worry, is this
[1:31:52] going to offend? Is this going to cause
[1:31:53] trouble? Whenever the word is going to
[1:31:55] be fulfilled, it causes an offense. But
[1:31:58] are we made in such a way we cannot be
[1:32:00] offended by how the word is
[1:32:02] fulfilled? Amen. She she wrought a good
[1:32:05] work upon him. Anointed the word for his
[1:32:08] burial. And I pray our praise, our
[1:32:11] worship, our love, our lives anoints the
[1:32:14] word for what he's going to do next.
[1:32:16] What is he going to do next? The dead in
[1:32:18] Christ are going to rise and where our
[1:32:20] bodies are going to be changed. And
[1:32:22] together with him, we're caught up to
[1:32:23] meet the Lord in the air. Amen. So may
[1:32:25] our lives anoint him. Not for just what
[1:32:27] he's done, but what he's doing. What
[1:32:29] he's doing in our midst. Amen. We should
[1:32:31] be so thankful. I'm like, Lord, this is
[1:32:33] another opportunity to be in your
[1:32:34] presence as a people. This is another
[1:32:36] opportunity, God, for you to touch
[1:32:37] lives, change people. I'm so excited.
[1:32:40] You know, I come to church, I think,
[1:32:41] what are you going to do today, Lord?
[1:32:43] What are you going to do? I get excited.
[1:32:44] Amen. I'm just like, Lord, you can do
[1:32:46] anything. And that's irrespective of who
[1:32:48] stands here. Amen. I'm not saying cuz
[1:32:50] I'm here, I'm under that expectation.
[1:32:52] Wednesday, whoever is preaching, I like,
[1:32:54] Lord, you're going to speak, you're
[1:32:56] going to move, you're going to impact
[1:32:58] somebody, Lord, you're going to impact
[1:32:59] me. Lord, that when I walk out of those
[1:33:01] doors, I said, Lord, I had a bit of
[1:33:03] expectation. You just blew it out of
[1:33:05] proportion. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. But
[1:33:12] there's some people who weren't
[1:33:14] offended. We'll just go to these and
[1:33:16] then I'm just going to go to one thing.
[1:33:18] This is This is Jonathan and David.
[1:33:21] Jonathan wasn't offended.
[1:33:24] You think about it, he's embracing the
[1:33:25] man that will take his throne. He cannot
[1:33:28] become king. God has said no.
[1:33:32] But yet he doesn't get offended. He
[1:33:34] doesn't get offended by because he would
[1:33:36] looked at his father and the kingdom he
[1:33:38] be to build and not thought I can take
[1:33:40] this the next step because my father's
[1:33:42] taken at this level. I'm going to take
[1:33:43] it the next level. But when he hears
[1:33:45] that God has taken the kingdom from
[1:33:47] David, he doesn't I mean I mean sorry
[1:33:49] from Saul giving it to David. He doesn't
[1:33:50] turn against David. He says he says
[1:33:54] we're in this forever.
[1:33:56] Whatever happens, remember we're we've
[1:34:00] got a promise for our children all these
[1:34:02] things. You see, he didn't get offended.
[1:34:04] That's right. May we be like that. May
[1:34:07] we be like that if God says no. Sure you
[1:34:09] want to be something, but you can't be
[1:34:11] that. You're just a support. you're just
[1:34:13] a maybe a hidden part of the body. Maybe
[1:34:15] just for prayer or just to be a
[1:34:16] blessing, just to shake a hand, give a
[1:34:18] hug, whatever more, you know, you're not
[1:34:20] something out in the open. And we can
[1:34:22] say, Lord, I'm not offended by the
[1:34:24] position you've placed me in the body of
[1:34:26] Christ. Lord, as long as I'm in the
[1:34:28] body, I'm so happy.
[1:34:32] Hallelujah.
[1:34:33] I don't care if I'm the small toe or the
[1:34:35] or the whatever. I don't care what I am.
[1:34:37] As long as I'm part of him, I'm
[1:34:39] satisfied.
[1:34:40] Hallelujah. Jonathan was satisfied with
[1:34:42] these things. Amen. He was he was
[1:34:44] supportive. He was actually happy. You
[1:34:46] will be the next king. Amen. The Lord he
[1:34:49] what what did he do? He he went to David
[1:34:51] when David's about to go. His time of
[1:34:53] you know on the run and he strengthened
[1:34:55] and strengthened his hand in God.
[1:34:58] Hallelujah.
[1:35:00] I trust we can be like that. Amen. We're
[1:35:02] not offended when God maybe bypasses us
[1:35:04] and use someone else. We're just happy.
[1:35:07] Praise the Lord. Amen. Who's another man
[1:35:09] who is who is not offended? The Apostle
[1:35:12] Paul.
[1:35:14] He wasn't offended by how he would leave
[1:35:17] this earth. He wasn't offended when he
[1:35:20] found himself in prison. He wasn't
[1:35:22] offended when he found himself chained
[1:35:23] to a Roman. And you know, even in those
[1:35:26] terrible conditions, remember because
[1:35:27] those prisons did not have underfloor
[1:35:29] heating. They did not get three meals a
[1:35:31] day. They did not have whatever all the
[1:35:34] things that these prisons had. They were
[1:35:36] dark, dingy, ratinfested prisons. But he
[1:35:41] wasn't
[1:35:42] offended. He realized, "The Lord's
[1:35:44] called me to take this gospel to the
[1:35:47] Gentiles. Whatever the details are
[1:35:49] between me and going home and how I go
[1:35:51] home, Lord, I'm not offended."
[1:35:54] Amen.
[1:35:56] If the first church age message can be
[1:35:58] like that, how about you and I in this
[1:36:01] age? because because he was told, "We're
[1:36:04] going to cut your head off, Paul. This
[1:36:07] is your end. This is your physical end.
[1:36:08] You're going to be you're going to be
[1:36:10] killed under capital punishment. Your
[1:36:12] death is not going to be some nice thing
[1:36:14] in a big bed surrounded by saints.
[1:36:16] You're the the the last eyes you're
[1:36:18] going to see are Roman soldiers, a cruel
[1:36:19] executioner. That's the last one you're
[1:36:21] going to see." Paul, did he get
[1:36:22] offended? No. Cuz he could look beyond.
[1:36:26] He realized that axe was just a gateway
[1:36:29] to get him to where he wanted to go.
[1:36:31] Amen.
[1:36:33] Amen. I pray we can be like that.
[1:36:36] We can be like that. Amen. Say, "Well,
[1:36:39] life's not going too well." Don't be
[1:36:40] offended. This is very unexpected times.
[1:36:43] Don't be offended. Walk with God. Walk
[1:36:46] with God. I'm going to I'm going to
[1:36:49] finish this just with this quote. He
[1:36:51] says, "Now listen, I'm going to say
[1:36:52] something. Faith is unconscious." Amen.
[1:36:55] You believe it? I've learned that in the
[1:36:57] years of travel around the world and
[1:36:58] meeting people from all different walks.
[1:37:00] But faith is unconscious. you've got
[1:37:01] faith and don't even know it. That's
[1:37:03] right. Jesus Christ, no matter if he was
[1:37:05] in a storm and the gal is knocking the
[1:37:07] boat from one side to the other or
[1:37:09] you're standing uh in a face a mess of
[1:37:11] demons. If he was hanging anywhere, it
[1:37:13] never moved him. He walked right on.
[1:37:15] Just as calm as quiet as he could be.
[1:37:17] Why? He was simply unconscious of fear
[1:37:20] or anything around him. That's right.
[1:37:21] Whether it was going to happen, whether
[1:37:23] it wasn't going to happen, he knowed it
[1:37:24] was going to happen cuz God said so. He
[1:37:26] didn't say, "Oh, have I prayed through?
[1:37:28] Wonder if I fasted long enough. Wonder
[1:37:30] if I did this. He just walked right on.
[1:37:33] Here's a man who walked above a fence.
[1:37:36] Amen. He just walked right on.
[1:37:38] Unconscious. That's right. He believed
[1:37:39] that God what God said was truth. The
[1:37:42] words must be fulfilled. He knowed what
[1:37:44] his life was to fulfill them. That's
[1:37:47] right. And you're here to fulfill it,
[1:37:49] too. Just walk unconscious of fear. Walk
[1:37:52] unconscious of criticism. Walk
[1:37:54] unconscious under the world. Walk as you
[1:37:56] walk in Christ. Walk with him. not
[1:37:58] paying any attention to the right or
[1:37:59] left hand, just keep moving on. If
[1:38:01] something comes up in the church, walk
[1:38:03] with God. I mean, hallelujah. If
[1:38:04] sickness strikes you, walk with God. If
[1:38:06] the neighbor don't like you, walk with
[1:38:08] God. Just keep walking on with God.
[1:38:09] Enoch one day walked like that. You know
[1:38:11] what he done? He walked all the way home
[1:38:14] with God. Just so far up the road, he
[1:38:15] didn't want to come back anymore. Amen.

[1:38:24] with the trouble. Walk with God. Amen.
[1:38:26] Don't walk with the don't not understand

[1:38:31] within themselves. Become carnal and
[1:38:33] blame blame everyone else what's going
[1:38:35] on. That's because they're offended.
[1:38:37] Don't be offended. Walk with God. Amen.
[1:38:40] Amen. Walk with God. Doctor Doctor says
[1:38:42] you're going to die. Walk with God.
[1:38:43] Yeah. Doctor says you can't get well.

[1:38:47] That's all. For God has promised you,
[1:38:49] I'll never leave you nor forsake you.
[1:38:51] I'll be with you to the end of the
[1:38:52] world. And he took an oath by that
[1:38:55] covenant that he give you that he would
[1:38:57] confirm it. Just walk with God. Then

[1:39:26] Maybe the musicians could come. We can
[1:39:28] allow ourselves to be offended and let
[1:39:30] that offense rule our lives. Or we can
[1:39:33] take that offense that comes and give it
[1:39:35] back to the Lord and let him deal with
[1:39:38] it. So it's really our choice. But
[1:39:41] blessed is
[1:39:43] he who is not offended in me. as the
[1:39:47] Lord said to
[1:39:49] John. So God's going to fulfill his

[1:55:23] offended where you'd take me, how you'd
[1:55:26] fulfill your word in my life. Lord, I
[1:55:28] just want to just trust you. Hallelujah.
[1:55:30] Lord, gracious father, you see the hands
[1:55:32] that are raised. Lord, I've raised both
[1:55:33] my hands because, Lord, I I myself don't
[1:55:36] want to be offended, Lord. How you
[1:55:37] fulfill your word, Lord, I don't want to

[1:55:42] just want to trust you, Lord. Sure, we
[1:55:43] go through hard things and painful
[1:55:45] things and troublesome things, but Lord,
[1:55:47] we never want to ever place them upon
[1:55:49] your account, my God. Lord, that we'd
[1:55:50] come to a place where we blame you and
[1:55:52] resent you, Lord. Father, may it be the
[1:55:54] opposite, Lord. When trouble comes,
[1:55:55] unexpected turns come in life, Lord,
[1:55:57] that we trust you and just have a great
[1:55:59] joy knowing you're our shepherd, Lord.
[1:56:01] And you we're never out of your sight.
[1:56:03] We're never out of your care, my God.
[1:56:05] Father, may we trust you in every
[1:56:07] situation, Lord. Though we don't know
[1:56:09] the way, we know you know the way, Lord.
[1:56:11] You know the way forward. You know the
[1:56:13] end from the beginning, Father. Lord, as
[1:56:14] you've been in our future, as you're in
[1:56:16] our present, you've been in our future.
[1:56:17] You've seen it all, my God. So, Father,
[1:56:20] may we just walk with humble hearts,
[1:56:21] full of your grace and love, Lord, every
[1:56:24] day, Father, trusting you. Grant it,
[1:56:26] dear God. We love you, Lord. I commit
[1:56:28] everyone here into your hands, Lord.
[1:56:30] Those who may be offended, Father, for
[1:56:32] where you've brought them through, may
[1:56:33] they just let it go now in the name of
[1:56:35] Jesus Christ. Lord, if they're offended
[1:56:36] at one another, brother, sister,
[1:56:38] husband, or wife, Lord, Lord, may they
[1:56:40] let it go now, Lord. But it's not worth
[1:56:42] holding on to, Lord. We ought to let it
[1:56:43] all go, Lord. Just have hearts full of
[1:56:45] love and compassion and joy, Lord, and a
[1:56:47] peace that pass all understanding.
[1:56:49] Granted, dear God, we thank you for this
[1:56:51] service, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:56:54] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:56:58] Hallelujah. I'll turn service to you,
