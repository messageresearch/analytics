mean you know we can just always praise the Lord and every situation so we great for the we can be here this morning there's some one of these mics are going funny the ones that are going funny of the mic was Sampson on it I said it just needs the anointing to come on and we'll all work you know Samson Samson wasn't much on his own you know he was you see the old picture Bible stories and Samson's as big strong muscly men with the ability and over brother branham said it wasn't like that he was the skinny guy that he didn't look like he'll be the sort of guy that could pick up a big gate and carried out of the city or slay hundreds of men with a jawbone and actually in the natural sense he wasn't but when the anointing of God came upon him that changed everything changed everything and that's the same with us you know we don't actually have ability we're not these mighty people and ourselves they can do these great things but when the Spirit of God comes upon us when we're anointed by the Spirit of God that's when great things happen amen that some stand this morning and we'll sing a few songs to the Lord and then we're going to have a shorten damn song services on him because

of that before the few worship songs and for brother bin comes the first one we've got up as brother Anini lead the way brother and then if you've got one just when he's nearing who else's yeah I'm not friendly about understand it by and by there's a lot so I thank you for paying for the opportunity to share my testimony so we thank you for bringing us back safely from the upland and we actually had a wonderful time praise the Lord so I'm gonna background my testimony with Scripture and then I will hit the point and they conclude with the Prophet so we are privileged people my brothers and sisters I mean we should comport ourselves as such amen hallelujah hallelujah as as the elect of of the Lord so our star will first go into chapter 2 verse 6 how big we speak wisdom among them that appear at a profit yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes princess of this world that come to naught but we speak to will of God in a mystery even the hidden meat a wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which not of the princess of this world no new four hadn't known it they would they won't have crucified a lot of glory but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God that love him do you love him now look at the next verse so it's still not hanging in air but look at it it says but God had revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit such as all things yea the deep things of God amen and so I just read this quote again from the Prophet just to background what what was what to say it it says God's Way that has been made for all said after through the services of this week try to show people that there's no need or being scared the worst see need ever can put on you is fear and he knows how to play the trick but our prophet a man said there is no need to be scared about anything are you serious of why you already know it just just just undock what he said now this week I tried to prove by the scripture that the man has born again of the king of born again of the kingdom of God has nothing to fear you are absolutely sick safely secure in Jesus Christ all the father has given me he said will come to me no man can come less than Father cause the father have got to lead him up to me and me that comes to me I will no wise cast out and all know Mike I'm locked out of my father's hand normal is greater greater he is he died heard my words and believeth on him that sent me everlasting life shall not come into condemnation but has passed from life from death to life he that eateth my flesh and drinks my blood not will help burn half present-tense everlasting life our wisdom of the last day and so we know the theme of the meeting was a rise and shine for the light has come and the glory of God is risen upon thee hallelujah I'm elder brother God uses our brothers so mightily bro David and also appreciate the church in Oakland as well for the sacrifice to guide the bride together and the servant of God I gave all he has a meant to be a blessed person of bright the gutter in Oakland for the Easter weekend and so that's when he said he said I'm not here to get a blessing that will keep me to to the next convention hallelujah so I prepare my heart to receive a blessing that will keep you from here to eternity hallelujah praise the Lord Amen so so so he actually said that with the with the with the the theme of the meeting and preached on that rise and shine took us from the glory and the light of God from revelation to Genesis was mind-blowing it was indeed mind-blowing well they will see the church the church types the moon type the church right and the church has no letter of her oh sorry the moon has no light of her own so she reflects the light of the Sun amen so you don't have to be worried or scared either tomorrow no it is not your righteousness is his righteousness that is bestowed on you and I not because of our anything but His grace and mercy hallelujah so each time you woke up in the morning is time to say lord thank you for today is another day to worship you not to be sad or depressed or this or that but that would draw everything on you at any time to keep you depress give you sad I remember we got something a man much more than the world a main I will need ever can touch if we know whom we are and what God has done for us not just knowing we accept it and we act on it Alleluia okay so we've known to that well what actually hit me most was when he hit esta praise the Lord I mean we know we have read that Scripture and pictures are pitch on that Scripture my brother it was a different thing by the week Easter weekend and I go to share share with you so I said that with Esther to 16 when the Esther was invited I was taking to the king yeah to go to King's presence and guess what it was on the tenth month only seventh year so refresh on 10 7 hallelujah when he came down the king came down amen and here we are amen were taking to gospel eater King's presence hallelujah so it's not the brands presence no is a pillow fight amen he came down only to the seventh so if you move it off a man and know that that is you actually have been invited into the presence of the King because you found favor that was what happened to Esther Esther found favor there was nowhere as a liberal qualified she wasn't she was even um in slave if you like captive she was good to be she was least qualified and so you and I there's no way we could make it them better people but God which messy Amen hallelujah came down and and and invited us into his presence amen and so I saw the grace of God just first know what the next to that says Esther obtain grace and favor in his sight Amen so so I put my name there hallelujah and I obtained grace and mercy and that's why he called me hallelujah and if he so called me who is a devil that can stop me ma from living for my lord harlot everything else is is secondary he is number one hallelujah and I look forward to come to his presence to worship Him to worship he that thou found I found for with and he invited me to be his bride hallelujah glory to God and so and we know that first John 14 says that he is full of grace and truth amen and Esther a male found Grace and favor and you have you and I have found grace and favor in his presence amen how much how much more we should be so glad how much Claude ought to be a main looking for to contrast presence not to see what will happen what makes him to happen to put fire amen liquify a fire I bring mine he brings has a Mashable's has I wasn't happened they don't understand here the signal says seek Amanda Bank an austere pound Alleluia the satin hasta sad why because we're in his presence we are found her one inside hallelujah yes and so the other thing that hit me was the own salon esse about when heaven Haman had made his master plan to destroy reduce the elect of God MA and in obedience Tamiya has to prepare herself and by faith she went in now look at here the law of middest and picture that change it not I said anybody will come to the King on in fact who died amen and so the so does nature die and all men have seen good in you and I so where's our hope it was a dare situation it was a dismal situation a situation that that that it was so helpless but look at the mystery torture God hallelujah look at the mystery so that the Esther went in and then said the King or to Esther what will down Queen Esther and what is I request it shall be given D to the half of my kingdom so Esther found grace of heaven and King straight for the scepter and the heat is so well said the scepter I said stick with Leedom with gold deity hallelujah amen and Esther didn't stop that she stepped fork and Tosh the setter ma she acted a man she believed and she acted amen so if we believe we're gonna act on it versus a tight you cannot make me sad you cannot rob my blessing this this morning I'm had this money to receive the Holy Ghost to be healed amen to see what the ask for amen even if my loved ones other than the world is mine praise the Lord okay so so the work with the law what was the law King when invited who died and said that God cannot withdrawn his law so what did he do God Himself deity flesh amen I'm paid and fulfilled and law abiram said if Christ was adding less than God we are all finished there's no holy man yeah that could die for you and I know holy prophet so God himself I said God Himself came and died for me that I'll be free who is it able to hold me back hallelujah oh my soul he catch a God came down and he said of the half of my kingdom and revelatory verse which one said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne his problem said is his domain so just like essa ma was accepted so you and I by the father god deity came in flesh and pay that depth but what the devil's was caring about this or did that same dude that yesterday 10 10 years ago you have finished you pointed the cross do you what I said you point him to the cross aim that's where the victory was accomplished hallelujah amen so that's nothing they were has over you and I we are free we are free to serving we ran your school within your job when you come to church forget about who is by your left with well right duska in the spirit amen hallelujah oh man I worshipped your king what's your Redeemer he's coming soon hallelujah oh my - take us home hallelujah and then he surely sorry Robin Rezac sorry so he said he he Lazarus about resurrection right now the voice they shot the message has called you a knife individual bride call the mystery you actually part of the mystery the bride is Mitchell Christ revealed right is the peace of God revealed for you and I that mystery that we read earlier that the principles were know nothing about is being revealed in you go what is mystery that God dating we'd won a game in human flesh all things are possible so when you come here just those we create clean your mind that is sick can be healed the dead can be raised the black can see this snack can be converted and you are not a believer can be refueled feel you want that to be lovely stones hallelujah my prayer to God Lord don't let me be a dead wouldn't be Church don't be in church member make me hallelujah Oh hallelujah alright so so when the message goes we are ready to go to the feast and that's why I said 22 when the King made a feast for this for this for the Sun and better people they give excuses when the king came in to see the guests he saw there was a man which had not a wedding garment amen he dug he was his people tended to be in the message but he won't let the message go through him aha rise and shine why because our letters come and rejoice for the amount of lumbus come and the bride is making herself ready no wonder poor poor when they caught him and said poor denounce this message they now sit and Paul said and oh if you don't teach us this is your grave and poor Oh grave where so victory why for the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law what angle for a scepter oh praise the Lord hallelujah and John when he when they when when George the names of redeemed it was a desperate situation thank you for the scepter for prevailed aim and I want to end with this that's that's God listen to me I share into the rhythm braum said I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there I'm not the one that performs those things and foretells these things that happens as perfect that they are I'm only one that that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it I wasn't it wasn't what I knew it's what I just render myself to that he spoke true it is in me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message was a mystery that God unfolded God and man we look of one again you he may die we won with our Father Amy he was it he says it was it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not son of man he was the messenger first from the Son of Man the Son of man is Christ he is the one that you are feeding on finally you are not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but look at the dragon you are feeding on the infilling body ward I was not man god bless you amen praise Lord God please everyone we could stand you for hours and hours I know so I just pray that the Lord brings out what you want me to stay in this way okay I just pray that the Lord brings out what he wants to place you guys so just before the time the Satan has really just been playing on my minds of my thoughts because when I read the Bible I really struggle and I don't take much in and then I think what's wrong maybe I'm just a Mike believer coming to church I look the part and I say the right things but there's actually no life in me and so that's been something that's played at my and in the first service already actually it was the second service the first service was a blessing but in the second service the Lord just confirmed to me that I have been called and I have been chosen because it was the one with Easter and brother David said pray what you pray your hearts whoa and man there was lots that I could think of but I just prayed and I said lord I want your mind to be my mind in your words to be my ruin your life to be my life with everything in me and oh man I wish brought when an engine we have to feel so wrong to do this without them but I remember sitting I mean she said she could just in her mind's eye she saw the pillow fire you above me she just saw this fire and so she just knew from Scripture by laying on her hands the Holy Spirit can come down and she did that and it was just so wonderful it was just the Lord reconfirming to me just putting another stake in the ground way I can now turn back and say - say - no no I have been called in the power of the Lord and that service was just so strong and in the last service um and I don't want to say too much about the services because I think just everyone should watch it and just man it's just I was amazing but he was speaking about Peter and John they'd walk past the crippled man at the gate beautiful and um brother David was saying about how that crippled man can represent us spiritually or naturally as well but he talked about how he was also crippled by divorce and it's something that I faced at a young age it had happened with that and after that and it just really struck such a chord in me to see that life had started crippling me sorry and I was that couple person lying on the ground and the Lord st. brought minute Andy my Peter John to say his word and then lifted me up and made me who I would never have been without him and it was just man that was so amazing that was that means so much to me it helped eternally grateful and I want to encourage people cuz Rodman said she never thought it like they spoke to us but David did she actually think maybe something would happen because I think they'd be lots of times we speak to people and nothing ever happens but if they hadn't been diligent to the call you better commit so what he'd wanted where would we be I have so thankful and I'm a children also enjoyed it which has been really lovely it's been something that I've wondered I want the children to ain t in the church I want him to sing with I want him to listen and enjoy in order just want him to be sitting and bored so there was great to see too until last night when I just writing down my words of the testimony I really just wanted to write something for the Lord man I just I don't know how to express the joy of what he's given back and and praise him for what he's done so this is what he's given me and i just i the the poem is written in the saints of that crippled person and jesus touching that crippled person and it sees what can I say to the sinner over there a man just fitted it man just sitting feeling so alone and unaware that he is surrounded by God's angels who are just waiting for him to realize there's a God Almighty how do I show that lady looking Sofie that actually I can see where her heart hesitate with the blood has run dry from wounds that also deep where she feels like there's no reason for her life to keep when little one will you recognize the pool that you feel where it seems your world is tumbling and you can no longer steal your heart and your eyes and your feelings away from all the forbidden that you did that day Oh precious people sinners Saints young and old come to this fountain which bubbles and flows the cool and refreshing water that runs will cleanse and heal you by the power of the Sun Jesus Christ is the power and strength willing and able to rescue you from any depth no feeling too blue nor a heart so said could combat the love the Savior has this grateful physician is standing and waiting for you to take his prescribed medication that will turn all darkness to light it will remove all envy hatred anger and strife His Holy Spirit is sent to clothe you in righteousness no one could ever deserve but beloved of the king by grace He is calling you to be his queen [Applause] the other man god bless you Saints yeah so sometimes we knew you know we knew in a serving ministry that and you're sitting in church and you stir the sound this can and maybe this would just bring it to every one of you musicians as well because you're in a ministry and you serve and you always hear diligently at your point of duty you know but you never get sometimes to enter in you never get to be on on that side of of the that line you know it's hard because you go dry you know you you're you serving but you're not concentrating on the word coming over the pulpit because you're so so in your little world to make sure you deliver the mail correctly and that's just my personality that sometimes you need to rejoice as well but it's hard to rejoice when you have an instrument in your hand because you don't want to go forward to the right hand side and throw it all out of cater so you always have to hold back going to the camp I held back but when I got to the camp the Lord gave me a Liberty to actually enter in and to take that little bit of food that comes over the pulpit wonderful revelation deep things that were spoken that I've never really seen that way I mean three mighty men do with a sword and one with a bucket it was such a simple message but yet though the very revelation of that touched me so deep that I wanted to be the one with a bucket but no I took my bucket and you'll go see the service and I go and got my water and I fought my bucket so much over that it's pulled over it's just everywhere I didn't want to miss a drop but it just kept going and then some person said that there's more to come but is more but there's more and it struck me because I was having such a Jubilee that that I was having them all burn and I thought Lord am I out of caterham are now going too far to the left cuz I was jumping around and having such a good time and it struck me and I said no you know what I don't I enjoy serving the Lord I enjoy worshipping with everything in that's why I was designed I wasn't designed to worship some rack be idle I wasn't designed to worship something in the world I was designed to worship Him so why was that thing quiet me down so I stopped right there and I see the very and this is what we should do pray without ceasing I say Lord just revealed to me what you want me to do and the very next sermon rather David came in he Sisk was waste god what am i preaching a God of tomorrow or a God that's right here now and when he said that that you know this is like something holding your back it's like a safety belt and your safety belt but it's like a safety belt and you just want to push forward and even that that thought just hold you back and it just went back on and he says now worship me was all that you have and then I worship because he's worthy of it and I so if anybody says to you you cannot show you cannot jump you cannot enter in it's a lie of the devil you rebuke them we say okay you are allowed to shout you are allowed don't don't do it just because somebody else does it but if something he is just going say how to do you say it it blesses you it pleases you because it keeps you in the service your mind doesn't go away and second of all he is worthy of it so there was a much revelation I got instead of the one true revelation I got is if you're gonna worship me do it with everything you have and be true don't be both be true and I praise the Lord because I needed that feeling I needed it and and it was wonderful so young people you young children you never ever if you feel like shouting aiming and you feel like saying hallelujah and you feel like praising the Lord do not hold back we'll be blessed I promise you there okay some people that some people can missed a blessing that way don't let no one tell you how to serve the Lord it's a personal woman okay and it's a sincere I understand I understand where the thought came from and these more to it but once you can see how you yourself praise the Lord that's how I saw at the camp you praise him with everything you have still be reverent though but yeah these are ballots but if you feel like shouting shout amen amen amen I believe God asks one time where were you with them when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy amen amen mr. Lundy it's been such a blessing I just I am actually speechless of what the Lord done one thing that came to my mind when I was we were sitting at the back just to make it easier to go in and out with Daniel but to look to the front and to see everybody rejoicing and I thought man there's so many people out there that Coastie rugby games and soccer games and they are rejoicing for the sport and here this bunch of people believe it's saving the hood it's jumping up and down in screaming and shouting and praising the Lord it was such a blessing to see and to be part of that and just to like Chantal see if we can stand here for a very long time of what the Lord has revealed to each one of us and it's been just I think all of us it's been amazing and I just want to praise the Lord for the opportunity that we had and one thing I realized in all the sermons likely that I've heard him especially over the weekend the gloves are off for nothing or you just leave it all buddy just go for it with everything you have [Applause] take my turn yeah so it was a wonderful time yeah there's there's no words to describe it what struck me just from my stature I was thinking of the people that's holding up out our little congregation here when we were out there and when our sermon when the sermon came of the three mighty men of David I was thinking of this brother man we would and I would really recommend everyone go listen to that sermon including you brother and then you can you can enter into our our our burden that we have now of who's going to carry that bucket than this body we will wrestle for it the Lord is good and I was thinking about about our body and I was thinking about these reason not only the three mighty men but the position that's been taken in in all of our then the new ones that's coming and just fits like a glove and it's just beautiful brother Herman that's here and they brought a testimony you know everyone's just filling in the place and the one thing that came out of that is yes pray for this body but we were in Auckland and we've had a wonderful fellowship with people from Taranaki and Christchurch and everywhere pray for them pray for them because they get attacked they have their normal day-to-day they just the challenges that we face we need to pray for them so that they stand ground and yes the filter is off there and the filters off here as well so they will get more attacked we will get you know attacked more even the strategist you know I was thinking about who's going to be in this war in the trenches with me together I'm thinking about brother and Evie he's fighting and we need to be on our knees and be that shoot or that brother who's going to flank you know we've got brother Isaac that's so flat-footed and brother Armand can never sit still you can see it right now if you look back Amy who's you know these positions in this army of God you know we will never run out of ammunition because of that brother keeping sitting behind there and then you have this quiet ones brother and me me you know you you you don't know what they hide you don't know that that power and that that that passion and zeal they have within them if that if it comes crunch time they will leave from the front and we've seen it just now with his wonderful testimony I just want to thank you sisters as well you know imagine yourself in your position of Christ and and yes let us pray for each other but let us pray for the people out there you know the message believers just sucking on that pool and just want to take everything in you know it's all for his glory and they are in it with us and we form a part of this wonderful Bride of Christ you know we'll let it let us let us keep that in the back of our minds god bless you all morning good morning church we yeah words don't describe we standing here cannot say everything that has happened there and how we feel it we can't put into words to explain to each one of you but as our brothers sister said we had a wonderful time in Oakland we had wonderful services blessed brother David bless the open church brother Gary and his congregation to put that event together but it just brought us all from different congregations bright from all over the world brought from all over New Zealand together and United us and and that was love that what we saw was love everyone coming together everyone sharing would each other no matter which church they came from over you know they are believers and we could stand together and we had a wonderful time of fellowship afterwards for their lunches and for dinners and stuff like there were different different believers but the Word of God was so mighty the Word of God was so much if you could sit in your seat and not end up and say Amen man you were dry when you did youcould there's no one could sit on the seat with a young or old and tell me that they didn't understand feed on pull on eat and before while he was sitting there you can you could just see the presence not just flowing to the place you know on the last service brother David brother David took six services back to back he gave it all the man jumped off the stage and he prayed for people and he fell flat at the end of it he was so whipped he was so wet with perspiration we had to loosen all his clothes up and take his shoes off and water was dripping off his socks that's how much he put into it it just gave it all and what are we doing church what are we doing are we doing the same we fighting the same battle as that brothers fighting do we have our swords in our hand and our shield in the other room ready for this battle are we just sitting here we can tweak out enough yeah I'll be there just a church member we don't the church members Body of Christ we are soldiers in this army the biggest thing for me as brother name is st. as well the brother said it's not from convention to convention it's not from one place to another you know what we

praise the Lord I mean let's go to first Corinthians 13 oh here we are now let's see if I can drive this a month along if I can Palin I just can't well here we go I'm driving okay don't be scared I've been first Corinthians 13 12 and 13 and then we're going to go to revelations 8 and 1 this may be a bit different but here we are for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face then I now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth hope faith charity these three but the greatest of these is charity they mean so so it's got revelations 8 and 1 I'm just gonna you know we were Christi and I were talking through the weekend before and you know I'm gonna share some pearls you know because you got to share what's real to you what's your revelation so and I know you won't turn and rend me so you know I'm just going to share some pearls I mean so basically so we're gonna read the scripture here and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour it may seem like a strange collection of Scripture but a malicious power here to get in a word of Prayer gracious father we so glad we can look into your word and Lord you've made a life thank you lord I pray your spirit would fall on each soul Lord walking with you is not having a collection of ideas or facts Lord it's you revealing yourself to us making yourself known so lord I pray your spirit of Revelation would fall upon each chart from oldest to youngest Lord and may you accomplish that which you have purpose for the service Lord in Jesus Christ's name Lord I ask these things amen I mean god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning I'm sorry whoa no I want to talk about the Seventh Seal today but we really hear that you know they'll come a time when we are there when we know as we are knowing now that is this day that we're alive and now the Bible as we read here in revelations ain't eleven you know there was a silence witness when the Seventh Seal open feels a silence there was a time of silence now the Bible is a love letter between Christ and his bride it's not a text book it's not a newspaper it's a love leader now in order for it to be a love letter to you and I we have to be in a relationship with him and as he is the one who initiates the relationship right it's not him that will earth or Romans but God that show us mercy I mean no man seeketh God at any time but he seeks us right in the beginning when Adam and Eve fell God went hunting them right they didn't go hunting him they went hunting they may mean so it's the same thing all the way down through the ages now so an order in order to have a relationship with God God has to reveal himself to us personally right so it's not just a collection of ideas or historical facts I mean that makes us believers it's because he reveals himself to you amen just like the scribes and Pharisees they said we are Moses disciples they had Moses but you know but if they really had Moses if they really had the river nation that Moses received it was a revelation to them then they would have received Jesus because gee Moses wrote of Jesus right I mean so but to them it was just a collection of facts that was a fact that Moses was a prophet it was an established fact that what he wrote a min the first five books of the Bible were the Word of God it wasn't established fact by their culture and they received it that way it wasn't a revelation to them rights a win so when the one that Moses wrote off became flesh they rejected him because they it was not revealed to them Allu you I mean so so now the Bible says in Matthew 11 in 25 jesus said at that time jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes so he himself was saying that these things have been hidden to some but revealed to others and God is sovereign and is choosing I mean that's why I think we should be rejoicing that he would reveal himself to us he would make himself known to us see the thing is it's not that our worthiness it doesn't matter how what we consider ourselves if he has revealed himself to you just rejoice and just shout and say thank you lord I mean because that's all that matters he made himself known I mean we weren't hunting him he found us hallelujah that's all that matters in life God found me Connelly it doesn't matter where I came from I mean he knew where I was going I mean it wasn't the gutter of this world they mean but it wasn't the glory that's all we need to rejoice them he found me he became real to me he's alive to me hallelujah that means so since the Bible is a love letter I mean do you believe it I trusted it and not a textbook then it's only for those that God isn't a true love relationship worth that will actually understand what he's saying amen because it will only be his bride that will really know what he's saying it won't be the casual reader it won't be those who just flirting with them it's those that he has chosen to join himself to he is not ashamed to call you bride he is not ashamed to call you the Lambs wife amen he's not ashamed he's proud look at my hallelujah she's wonderful she spotless she's virtuous she's sinless she's made in my image hallelujah he is he is proud of you little old me absolutely hallelujah hey I can brag on Jesus I'll brag on Jesus a little bit I mean just like brother brand someone complained he said you know yo let's eat dum you brag on Jesus too much lujah I want to be in the same category at Mila's brag on him so now so the bride those who had joined to him they really know what he's saying I mean so it's like if you if you found you know you know some letters that your grandparents wrote before they got married or maybe some emails that your parents wrote you know we've gone to the modern era you know you could read those letters and you could kind of you know you could say well this is what they're saying and this is what they're meeting but you would not just say just say grandpa's writing to Grandma right you could understand what he's saying to her but only she would receive the full intent of what the leader meant I mean she because she's in a relationship with him she receives the full magnitude of what he's writing and maybe even his handwriting with changes he's changing what he's saying and in his phrases and different things she would know exactly what he's saying others may read it but you wouldn't get the full depth of what's being said like she would why because she's in a love relationship with grandpa hallelujah and it's the same thing with this place of Bible same thing with the message a mean those are in a relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ they know what he's saying they know what he's meaning amen I mean so so why you say so you may say well what's this got to do with the silence when the Seventh Seal opens well it's because the bride knows what he means I mean some people read silence and they debate about it fuss about it argue about it but the bride knows something's happening she knows why it's written this way because she's in a love relationship amen so what is God saying he's saying because Christ is the seals the seals reveal cry right but and and and the seven seals they encompass the whole world it encompasses the great and her destruction her judgment the devil's judgment and destruction it encompasses the church right it encompasses the bright and encompasses the world right because the first four we know as the as the Antichrist spirit riding forth and God sending an anointing to combat what the enemy is doing amen and we know run to the Eagle anointing in the South that's why God raised above the situation of life and we can see from eternity to eternity hallelujah amen so you know but then there's the first seal I mean which is the Jews 144,000 right the mystery of them I mean in the six seals of Great Tribulation now are we are we know and then in the seventh is Christ himself coming hallelujah right so you got to see now where do we fit because I I don't see myself in the Great Tribulation some people are in you you see there's a great move of being Preppers in this hour why because they're being anointed to prepare for the Great Tribulation that's their that's their portion I mean you were to find your portion in the scripture I mean just like Jesus he went to the synagogue he found where it says in Isaiah the spread of laws upon me and he read that scripture said this day the Scriptures fulfilled I mean so he knew exactly his portion of Scripture that he was to fulfill I mean but an angel has to come to you I mean and show you what portion of Scripture you are call to fulfill in this day that's why it's very important say Lord reveal to me my allotment in the scripture I mean unless if this message has come alive to you this message is a bridegroom call so therefore you're a lot but in the scriptures let us be glad and rejoice I mean for the marriage of the lamb has come and the bride has made herself ready hallelujah I mean because this message is a bridegroom call it's a love relationship going forth hallelujah it's not for everyone we know that amen but it's for the Bride of Christ that means we don't we don't exclude anyone first of all whosoever will let them come woo yes it's yes real simple will you come I'll come just like there's the parable of the wedding feast you know I'm not sure who who shared in the testimony but you know the invitation went out and it was those that just said y'all come you know the King said get the good and the bed go to the highways and byways the hedgerows we ever get the good in the bed if they'll say yes they're coming and they come into the door they can be very rich very poor homeless whatever I mean they're anointed they're given a new robe their feet are washed I meant so the world is washed off them they're given the robe of his righteousness they're anointed to to that any that any smell the world comes off them because they're anointed amen and they've gone to the wedding feast and they look all the same I mean after what they have to come through the door they have to say yes I'll come hallelujah RSVP hallelujah I'm iris repeat have you polio I've walked through the door Christ is the door hallelujah I've been anointed I've been robed Amen hallelujah by His righteousness I made my feet I mean wash the world's been washed off me the things that one said I can't do because my nature's been changed hallelujah Amen it's God that you have to keep yourself he changes you I mean just like when you're a yo-yo a little kid and I remember being young eat this you know something gets past you and you say no I don't like it you know you've never had it before like no I see it repeat but you know but if your natures changed you know your taste buds change as you get older the thing you ran a mile from you spiced yourself eating and the things you you know what cuz you cuz you're hungry your desires have changed it's just like the Lord the things I once did I can't do no more not because of sin here thou shalt not it's because it's in here thou shalt not my nature has been changed that I can't go to the world I can't because my I have no desire it's like a little kid who doesn't like broccoli they don't like broccoli because the desires not there for broccoli I mean better nature changes they love broccoli hallelujah I mean you know what I mean you can't you can't you can't go back amen I've heard a call I can't go back I mean I've met him that's one of the things I rejoiced about the meetings where we're brother David's preaching about Esther amen and Haman raises up and I just started shouting I mean because Haman came too late Esther had already been called she'd already receive the crown she'd already become Queen it was too late I mean his scheme came too late and the devil came too late hallelujah the devil's come too late to put them right off I'm in the devil's come to light that tell her it's not real hallelujah the devil's come too late to tell you the message is not true he's come too late to say that this is not Christ it is Jesus Christ the word hallelujah he came too late hallelujah sorry yeah hey it is what it is I'm sorry they've come the devil came too late glory anyway so you know I'm just happy I loo you so now so the bride knows something significance has have something significant is happening because is a silence what God is saying is Shh is a hush that sounds means a hushes has just come now and why because he's come he's coming to claim his own the seventh seal is a person as I said you're gonna find yourself in the seals is the fullest virgin is dealt with they go the Great Tribulation the Jews are due out they aren't worth right they receive the same Christ where we have received that's why the two witnesses go to them they witness the very same one we know they bring to Israel right so that's under the first seal the sixth seal great tribute six seals Great Tribulation I mean the church is dealt with but where are we under the seventh Christ Himself uniting with a bride amen I'm sharing some pearls hello yeah if you could just recognize that he is present more than just singing the song he is here but you know he is here I mean because every redemptive attribute of God was in Christ he is Jehovah Jireh laws provided sacrifice he's Jehovah Rapha now forgive me if I mixed these up he's Jehovah Rapha the Lord you're the Lord is your healer peace peace he's the banner he's piece jehova sholom all those redemptive names or attributes of O of God was in Jesus Christ he's also jehova shamma the Lord is prison I mean so he has to be prison is to be jehova shamma in order to be healer he has to be jehova shamma in order to be a healer and deliverer and peace I mean my peace I give unto thee it's not just something that's that separate from him it's him he gives himself to you that's why you have the peace of God that passes all understanding I mean he comes and heals you Amen cuz he's present to heal he's present to deliver here's our banner he's our strength is our refugees our rock all those things because he is jehova shamma he is present hallelujah and you recognize his present it changes the whole picture it changes everything when you recognize that his presence the member the only thing he is not as this physical body we will meet in the air but everything he is he's present right when he is when he says and we'll come to it we says behold I stand at the door and knock he is a person it's not part of a person he says I am present upon the earth knocking trying to get into the church he's present but anything hear my voice and we've heard the shot go forth I mean we've heard that midnight cry the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him hallelujah and something at me said I'll go that's really that simple will you go just like with a Rebecca I'll go here I'm going home glory because we know that the rapture is really the secret going I mean it's actually a secret catching away by the man sees us like Romeo and Juliet Romeo you know comes at night puts his ladder up whatever against the side of the house and takes Juliet away that's like that he comes like a thief in the night and he's a very good thief he doesn't stuff around he won't be on us you know you know the me he's a very good he knows what he wants I mean it's not just a smash-and-grab job he knows what he wants he wants you he's come to catch you away hallelujah but anyone who's not United with him it doesn't mean much the silence amen it's either something they'll ignore or debate or argue over but to the bride it means something she knows that he's coming like a thief in the night I'll loo you see if I could drive this again now let's go to Matthew 24 one two three we're going I'm gonna get to Rebecca Eleazar soon you know I love the Bible man I'm so amazed this convention the Scriptures so alive this word is a living word it hasn't gone stale it hasn't become common it's a living word and we are living in a different hour we're living 10 years ago Easter 10 years ago was my first ever convention and it was glorious don't get me wrong I had a Jubilee I was at the front rejoicing I didn't care about the monkeys in the back that's why it's always good sit in the front of you can don't worry about all the monkey just yeah everyone distracting you I know it's a crude way of saying it but hey I just dominate the front rows hallelujah if I could be myself because you know you're not distracted that's Here I am hallelujah doesn't matter what the others do behind me they can do what they want I'm here hallelujah anyway there that's me you know I probably would have been a soccer hooligan or something if I lived ever see anyway if I really loved sport but you know we worship the Lord now so Matthew 24 one two three and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto MC not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he set upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world so notice he's asked three questions shall these things be for the table being destroyed right and the sign of thy coming and the end of the world now Jesus answers these three questions Matthew 24 he goes on now I'm not going to I'm you know I haven't put it in here but go listen to the seal series and brother BAM shows that that Jesus speaks about the first six that he leaves off the seventh which is the coming and you'll notice when when when Jesus sososo he goes through these and then he breaks off into parables speaking of the condition of people when the Lord returns why because he's now actually opening up the seventh seal amen he's actually opening up the seventh seal so you know so he goes through the your first six but then it it appears that he omits the seventh but then he goes into parables right so he starts off saying you know and he's showing the condition that people are running their attitudes at the time of the coming of the Lord which is the seventh seal right we know the similar seals the end of time end of all things but it starts off with Christ as sealing revelations 10 they meant to unite himself with a bride hallelujah you know amen so now so so we're not going to go and but go read Matthew 24 25 so he starts with the days of Noah this is what it's going to be like when the Lord returns people married wives given a marriage all those different things until the rain came and destroyed them all right so they're people's attitudes for those caught up with life too busy there was a crank fanatic old man building a boat you know maybe that was a better sight better news but you know all these people were busy people caught up with life but there were a group preparing to leave amen and you know and then he speaks about you there'll be two in the field one will be taken one will be left to in the bid one will be taken one will be left he's talking about how the rapture will be universal I mean there'll be people asleep they'll be taken they'll be awake they'll be taken hallelujah if you're in Christ you're going if you're really in the Lord if you're sealed in I mean you are going doesn't matter you can be driving down the road you can be walking down the road you can be at work you can be asleep you can be brushing your teeth you know when the Lord calls we have to go hallelujah amen and then he speaks about the parable of the good servant that is found doing when the Lord returns but then also the evil servant I mean that loses sight of what he's commissioned to do I mean cuz blessed are they that occupied till I come until they have found it doing when he returns but then it but then he speaks about the evil servant I mean who loses sight of what he's commissioned to do he gets drunk with the rest of the world and begins to smite has fellow servants now this world is drunk right sees in Revelations 18 that the great has made the whole world drunk amen and everyone's drunk on something I mean the only sober minded serious minded people is the Bride of Christ amen I mean so the so people get drunk why because what happens these are there appears to be a delay amen but God is not slack concerning his promise as others will call slackness but is long-suffering waiting for everyone to get in waiting for all the Elector coming even waiting for the fullest version to come in I'll put it that way to everyone that would be ready amen God is not slack but some people were going to think there's a delay he delays us coming therefore they so the zeal that they came in with diminishes they keep they they they take their eyes off the goal hallelujah our goal is that we are built into the stature of the perfect man I mean that everyone who will will come and drink at the fountain I mean that God would pour his word out into flesh again I mean he would become flesh that's our goal and we'll take a rapture howl ooh yeah isn't it our goal isn't that what we're living for mums and dads and that way you want to live a life before your children I mean that they would see Christ in flesh I mean that you would be salty to them you create an atmosphere in your home I mean that they they realize that the reason we're Christians is because we love Him I mean because of what he's done for us it's not out of fear and we'll come into that soon it's not out of fear it's out of love and respect and and then Thanksgiving hallelujah amen sorry so don't don't take your eyes off the goal don't get drunk with this world don't get caught what is drinking it's something we do something in excess I mean your passions you get caught up in some hobby some selfless I mean selfish thing amen don't get caught up oh I need me time no just have a lot time hey man I need to relax just go relax in his presence we have a place to relax letting off the pressure amen get in his presence and let off the pressure amen so don't get drunk on the pleasures of this world or some some hobby or I do this to be with the Lord well how is it impacting your family don't use him Jesus is not an excuse I mean don't use him as an excuse try and put some religious wrapping over your own selfish motives amen and then he speaks about the parable of the wise and foolish virgin he's talking about thee sorry that's there I don't have a blank on me but you know he's so he's speaking about the condition that people will be at the time of us coming right then he speaks about the wise and foolish virgin now the word wise and his thoughtful so those are the Strong's it is thoughtful that is and I can't pronounce this it's saga chaos which is sa Ga see IOUs and that means having or showing keen mental discernment and good judgment this is the wise right or they are discreet which is implying a cautious character you know many times you know in the world we're carefree but then we meet the Lord we're a lot more high-strung right and some people the devil uses that against us but it's because when you really meet him you know his mercy and grace you're so thankful that he found you I mean you should I appreciate what he's done for you I mean that you don't want to do something that will hurt him you don't want to do something that will displease him right you you want to live a life now you know what will the bride knows she's not trying to earn salvation amen we're not trying to earn brownie points or anything but because of what he's done glory every because of what he's done they men he took your son up Calvary he went to was the center in your place I mean that you don't need to go I mean he took your shame in your sin and everything you're done he says I'll gladly take that upon myself I mean I will identify your sin upon me I mean I'll take it up Calvary that day hasn't he done the incredible things for us oh yeah he was he was not ashamed amen he was not you know he said for this cause I've come into the world hallelujah so so when so when people will come believe it because they don't want to hurt him in any way we become more high-strung right and the devil uses that against you or why can't you relax why can't you be carefully like you were in the world and he tries to use it against you it's because we want to live a life worthy of the gospel because of what the Lord has done for us I mean so we don't want never let the devil use your own sincerity and your own good intention you know what you know your own sincerity and and in love for God against you why no why are we that way because we're wise hallelujah God made us that way that's God's character amen glory I mean so it means a discrete implying a cautious character amen and so so they don't want it so that's what it means and it also is from the root word which is having a sensitive nature why because we're sensitive to him you know if I asked you now this is a very silly question but who wants to grieve the Holy Ghost that he flies away from you not a soul you want him close you know what it's like when he when he there and is it's such a sweetness and everything's wonderful you may be in the worst worst possible trial but this is such a sweetness in you you know it's just so wonderful when the heavenly dove comes and he rests on your shoulder and you never want that you know you just want to stay in that moment your Lord if you could just freeze me right here in this moment that I never leave your presence like this why is that because the heavenly doves there hallelujah I trust you know I you can see on your faces you know what I'm talking about I mean so so that's why we're a bit sensitive nature because were like lord I just want to live a life where you're close hallelujah he said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee but if we we can't grieve the Holy Ghost he flies up in the rafters waiting for us to get our hearts right again then you'll come back doesn't mean we have to get saved all over again you understand but we can't grieve him but we don't want to grieve him so the wise virgins have a nature that is in contrast to the foolish and that word foolish means heedless they just you know they just press right on they don't heed the warnings they're not worried amen and another reason why we may be you know why we are you could say you know seem to be more high-strung being a believer it's because we know it straight as the gate and narrow is the way we want to walk that way but the foolish they just they just go anyway broad but broad is the way that leads to destruction Amen but the wise we say Lord want to walk and step with your word amen but the thing is now the reason the wise are that way in my opinions because they have oil I mean they have Holy Ghost all that's why they have God's divine nature that's why they that's why they are wise that's why they are discreet amen that's why they do have a cautious nature glory and then he goes into the parable of the talents remember and you know we know the parable of the wise and foolish is the bridegroom call some go into the marriage some do not amen and we're married here amen and then there's the parable of the talents servants are given a different number talents some five turn and in someone and and the master says go you know he's traveling to a far country says you cease use what I've given you I'm in and and make increase on them and then he comes back and the five now has ten the two I think has four year-old you know there's an increase but the one he buries his talent because he knows that the young that is master is a very shooed very good businessman you know that that saws where he doesn't I mean rape three doesn't so in different things but it's out of fear he buries what God gave him out of fear he buried what what the master gave him it's out of fear what's happened his relationship is wrong amen I I think that Lord would rather be that servant came said good master you know I had one Helland right then I got three and then I tried to do this I lost it all I think that master would be more pleased I mean worth with that servant if he lost at all I mean that he didn't do anything amen that's why we God doesn't see us up to fail the bride is not set up to fail I mean so when God gives you a talent gives you a gift we'll have a gift of faith he doesn't give it to you he doesn't reveal his work to you that you will fail I mean he doesn't do that he gives you a gift he gives you a talent he reveals himself to you because he set you up to win he set you up to be successful he said you have to take a rapture I mean he sent you up to overcome hell death and the grave I mean he sent you up to be victorious to be an overcomer he's made you thus amen so we shouldn't be afraid you know the Lord reveals himself to us we shouldn't be afraid of what's going to happen now no the what's going to happen as these atoms are going to be changed that's what's going to happen what's gonna happen dancing on streets of gold hallelujah what's gonna happen what's the devil be kicked into the lake of fire see how long he screams before he hits the flames I don't know it says hallelujah revelations 19 rejoice amen say you know we shouldn't we shouldn't be afraid oh but what about what about no if he saved you brother Brahim season the I think it's the Lamb's Book of Life sermon I may I may get the title wrong it says God doesn't save you one day to lose you the next day god does not run his business that way I mean even if it may appear that we willfully do wrong God doesn't you know God allows us to do those things sometimes amen hallelujah God doesn't run his business said he'll save you one day lose you the next day he does not operate that way I mean he knows how many are in the Lamb's Book of Life and he sent this message to awaken you Amen that you would realize you have representation in heaven hallelujah say Amen what do we have to be afraid of Amen if God is for us as God for you who can be against you someone tell me nothing hallelujah so I think we should just be happy let's just rejoice and then he goes into the parable of thee of the dividing of the sheep and goats a great white throne judgment and that is the result they separate that way as a result of how God how they received the Word made flesh in their day I hungered you feed me I was thirsty you know you gave me some to drink I was in prison you visited me I was naked you clothed me and I said when did we do these things si much heed unto my little ones you done to me they mean why cuz these will these things all happen under the seventh seal now lo yeah I'll try and I may have to just cut this short and then we'll pick it up some other time but he sees this here and and second second Thessalonians 2 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus and by our gathering together unto Him have we gathered to help Amen that ye be not soon shaken in mind nor troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand what's he saying that there'll be things that will come and shake us trouble us in mind yeah or in spirit is it by spirit or by leader whatever it may be things will come but they no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first I should turn off the locking thing on my phone I mean and that that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition now that's already happened right who opposeth and exalteth himself or above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what was hold of that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way now he's saying that this mystery of iniquity is working right it's already there but only he but it's limited in the devil has boundaries the devil has boundaries amen only he who now letteth will let who's the one who who who allows all things God himself I mean Satan has to ask permission from your husband before he plays a single finger upon you he has to get permission amen so everything that happens in life God has allowed it and God allows it that he can reveal himself he could manifest his attributes in your life why do you think God allowed the fall because he was a savior he is a redeemer he was a guide he was peace he's a shepherd I mean he's a comforter he's a husband he's he's all these things he's a sacrifice he's a priest but he couldn't reveal those things to Adam and Eve when they're not you know you know when the sinless so the devil the devil actually did God a favor because there's a part of God you think God and his great eternal being how many crates creation the pinnacle of that creation was man and as he's creating he sees it's good this is good this is good but then finally when Adam standing there upon the earth by himself he says it's not good I mean because Adam was the manifestation of the heart of God it's not good I'm alone I mean it's not good I'm just alone in this eternity with my thoughts I mean I want I want to have a bride I would have someone I can love on if someone I can adore I mean someone I can you know reveal myself to spend time with make myself known to so he says it's not good hallelujah because that's what he wants I mean so he takes he takes Adam and now this is the Seventh Seal you see the Seventh Seal there in Genesis I mean where God puts man upon the earth then he takes a part of that man hallelujah I mean separates the feminist part of them out amen and then and then finally now Eve comes true Adam comes true and then Adam because he's named all the animals but now he sees a part of himself in flesh and he says that your bone of my bone your flesh of my flesh you'll be called woman because you came out of man hallelujah and because you came out of me didn't come out here separately like the male and female animals we came out of me holy that's why you call a woman because you came out of me hallelujah as the same thing when God and that's the seven seal and that's why Christ is descended in the amen because remember Eve didn't go to Adam and say i'm bone of your bone flesh of your flesh I'll be called woman cuz I came out of you it was the other way around hallelujah and that's why this word is called your name this message just called your name I mean that's why God himself has come down to this hour he says your bone of my bone your flesh of my flesh your life of my life your power of my power amen you are me she is him the prophets here hallelujah that's what he's declaring that's the seventh seal and that's why this message means a whole lot to you why because the second head of us come down in Word form I mean to find a word bride hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah that's why you've got to listen to what he sees about you not what the devil says about you or what your own humanity may say about you that's irrelevant I mean the only thing the only voice that matters is the voice of the seventh angel I mean that has identified a bride in this hour I mean it's not just him at God comes in behind hallelujah 50 odd years later and says she is she is my bride hallelujah that's why it's perverse it's not haphazard we it's not haphazard the convention was like it was or the camp was like it was or or today is like it was like it is it's not haphazard I mean God is wanting you to know this is me Here I am prison upon the earth I meant to draw you to myself I mean the you Endora that you are part of me hallelujah I mean little they don't humanity fade away they don't complexes go they don't plane go little Shango they roll worse than the blood of Jesus Christ don't worry about it he took care of it that day hallelujah he took care of your paths he took care of your shame he took care of your mistakes in your son I mean don't worry about it it's been painful it's been washed it's been cleansed from you hallelujah we don't need to worry I am no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God hallelujah I have been identified by a voice hallelujah amen it is what it is Amen hallelujah hallelujah amen so this he who now letteth will lit this is Christ himself and the reason I put the series he is only he he's a person it's not part of someone it's not Christ by measure it's Christ without measure amen and thing is when he who now so when he's taken away what does take now the way what does that mean when he leaves the Holy Ghost is lifting off the Gentiles amen the Holy Ghost is lifting off the Gentiles and when he leaves if you're part of him you have to leave you have to go with him if you're part of him he won't leave one who's behind hallelujah he won't leave his little ones behind he say I'm just a little little one in the faith he won't leave you behind I'm not I'm old you know I've been through a lot of things he won't leave the old behind he won't leave the young behind he's taking all that the father has given me will come they will come to mean all that come to me all no wise cast out hallelujah so I have to go amen you know imagine you know any real family you know they make a pit stop driving somewhere little Johnny's in the toilet do you think they're gonna leave Johnny behind no they will wait they may get annoyed at him but if he he's getting in the car right he's getting in the car and even sometimes we may drive off and you know I don't know if you've had it your job I wish we so-and-so yeah I don't know if we have but you know what what do you do you squeal on the brakes you turn the car around you go get the hallelujah now our Lord this gospel ship is not leaving port like that then turn around coming back everyone will get on and then the boat leaves hallelujah Amen so I don't know I just might be simple but I have to go I'm part of his word I'm part of him I'm leaving hallelujah that's why I'm not scared I'm not scared am I gonna miss it I can't miss it well does that mean you just love hip has it know I'm looking he says lift up when you see all these things upon the earth lift up your heads well you know your Redemption draweth nigh Ezra has been a nation however many years and Jesus see the generation that sees the fig tree put forth its buds then become a nation again will know will not pass away until all things be fulfilled that generation is getting old right family how can you enjoy some people getting old because they will not pass until all things be fulfilled amen doesn't the bride say even so Lord Jesus come quickly come quickly Lord glory now hallelujah amen so the seven seals in Genesis whether Bram see isn't it odd I think well I've already mentioned this one but we'll go we'll put it up anyway technology anyway revelations three twenty two twenty 2008 were there behold I stand at the door and knock I stand you read the church ages he says his part where he walks among the candlesticks he goes from Ephesus he's walking all the way to let us hear but when he comes low to see sees I'm standing here amen I finished my journey through the church ages now I'm calling people to come out to me hallelujah that's what this voice does this message is a call come out come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins come out from among them and something innocent I have to go I've heard us I've heard the master call holy like the Souris he was dead for days in the grave Jesus stood there by as gross as grave Lazarus come forth let's just had to come forth he couldn't stay do you think he wanted to go back nowhere you having you having fellowship with Peter James I mean I mean with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and you we are with the Saints you're an eternity hallelujah but he heard the Masters call he he had to he had to because he was part that voice he was connected with their voice how that's the same thing with us amen hallelujah yeah we should be the happiest people in all the world I mean we know that God uses trials to bring forth character I mean so we should even rejoice in trials when the Lord puts his finger I know is sister Chantal was saying about being the at the gate amen the reason the Lord puts us finger on our infirmities it's because not just to say how how you've got it he's here to say no this has come to an end that's why he puts his finger on on flaws of our character pains and conflict us because God is actually saying I've identified this because I want to take it from you that you don't have to carry this no more hallelujah amen that's why that's why he shows things in our life that we can say Lord this is not part of me do you think it's part of his nature to have complexes that crippled up your faith and you can't relate to people you can't enter into burdens you can't help one another do you think that's from God no amen it's from the devil God allowed it amen because he allows all things but he doesn't want us to carry it he wants us to say here Lord I'm done with this box of rattlesnakes amen that's why when the Lord puts his finger on you say Lord take it from me I'll die out here right now I'll die out to this company or die out to this pain Oh die out to my past I'll die out to this hurt I mean that my nature's change it doesn't bother me no more I mean and when the enemy tries to give it back to you there's something and you says it doesn't belong to me seyton take it back in the name of Jesus Christ it was never mind to begin with I mean you take it back and he has to take it back I mean cuz resist the devil he shall flee amen you gotta tell the devil where to go you tell Satan shut up and get out a man oh jesus didn't clown for the scribes and Pharisees those religious Devils he didn't clown he walked on he did what he was called to do I mean we should do the same thing as I said the Apostle pulled and go back to your manly try and convince him he just walked on with Lord amen now we that's coming thought my Terry I like brother arm and he's awesome can you go next one oh yes okay now God had a purpose now if you want to listen to something you listen to the seals seventh seal and then listen to Christ and mystery God revealed because brother Bernie seasoned the sim seal not you know he comes to points he says no I can't I can't say anymore but then in this service he tells you what it is amen now God had a purpose these are not sermons friends just like Jesus giving up parables it's not just a story just a you know no he's he's laying things out that we would that we would because of our love relationship we would catch what he's really saying amen now God had a purpose in a hidden mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you'll understand clearly you'll see oh I believe what is being done so this is great mysteries unfolded down to this very hour he says now God's great mystery oh it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the Angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence Jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not it's not even the Sun himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices John was even forbidden to write at sea the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet or how he will come and when he will come it's a great thing that he doesn't know we're gone next one no he has showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's great goal is and now can we say now now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and with God's help we'll see it right here this morning what God had in his mind all along and has expressed it aim it says it was a secret with God peace is no it's been revealed and every type shadow the acts of the believers is expressing this one goal that's why you can go to Genesis with Adam and Eve upon there so there's a seventh seal right there and you go down through the scripture you see the seventh seal I mean Christ bring your people to their place in position I mean in him hallelujah Amen now so every type in the Bible is revealing the coming of the Lord can you hold on for 10 minutes now I'll pick this up I just want to come to this one point okay so now let's go to let's go to the next yeah here we are so every time in the bowl is revealing the coming the Lord and we should be able to see the Seventh Seal from Genesis to Revelation so you should see yourself that's why it's when God anoints the word he shows you who you are like the mighty men like Esther like Ruth like Rahab like even David amen like the apostles I mean you can see yourself in the scripture because God is trying to get you to see this is who you are in him they were expressing you and as a shadow but you are the reality hallelujah Amen so when Christ is identified and you identifying himself then you are christ-like which the word Christian means to be christ-like there is your identification all right now and since he is our identification then we should be identified with him by living for him can we go next one now this is from the Christ mystery God revealed again as well now notice God has a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret God in His great mystery secret that he had before the wool began he got a three-fold purpose in it and now what we want to go upon this morning is what is this refold purpose now I believe by the help of God who is present heel shot to us now if he had it had the threefold purpose we want to find out what the three-fold purposes now the first thing God wanted to do was reveal himself to the people now can we go can we go next one he couldn't do it as great Jehovah God who covered all time and space and eternity he could not he was too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious now how could that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and now on and to the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that all was that and still is we go next one but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son a man that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it see he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ on the next one secondary to have preeminence and his body of believers that is his bride that he may live in people and the third fold is the restoration of you know eating and all those things but this is what this is what he wanted to do Alleluia now let's just go to Genesis 24 I just want to touch this real quick and then it they aren't going to finish then well maybe we'll pick it up next time that's what he wanted to do he wanted to reveal himself in Christ and then have preeminence and the people that he would live in them and then restore read and this is threefold that's a really the three-fold purpose of the seventh seal amen hallelujah and so now here comes and then we can see thee we can see even in Genesis 24 speaking of Rebecca and Isaac here's a seventh seal again now this is just a few but go dig amen go read your Bible I challenge you go look brother Ram says that he just hit the high points but then people come come dig down what he's saying amen now so it came to pass so this is Eliezer so Eliezer finds Isaac a bride and when the bride becomes one with Isaac then Isaac falls heir of all that Abraham has amen top of the seventh seal now it came to pass it before he was done speaking behold Rebekah came out as Eliezer praying Lord made the damsel come and give me water and water my camels the one he's looking for a bride you know you know if Isaac came out who was born of bethuel son of Milcah the wife of Nahor Abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and he went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me I pray thee drink a little of thy picture now go next one and and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink and when she was done having a drink she said I'll draw a water for my camels also until they were done drinking and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again into the well and draw water and drew for all the camels now we're gonna jump down right down into the story this is down at the end so so Eliezer by this time has met her family you know revealed that the angel Lord came before him to find the bride and Rebecca has come to a place she's realized I'm part of that prayer I'm part of the vision I'm part of the word hallelujah trust you if you found yourself part of the vision I mean whether you know when brother Aaron saw the preview of the bride I mean he was looking at you walking up and heaven robed in the righteousness of Christ hallelujah glory and they called Rebecca and said unto her because because Eleazar said don't delay yo yo I found her I'm off you know and and they called a Rebecca and said unto her wilt thou go with this man she said I'll go and they sent away Rebecca their sister and her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men and they bless Rebecca and said unto her thou art our sister be there the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gates of those who hate them and Rebecca arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took Rebecca and went his way and Isaac came from the wealth from the way of the well of Lahori for he dwelt in the South Country and Isaac went out to meditate in the field that the Eventide lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel just stopped there so here's Rebecca comes to a well right she comes to well but now she's gonna live by a different well I mean this well she's gonna live by as in the Promised Land I promised land is Christ I mean to this well that she's gonna live by as a well of living water I mean it's not a man and you know it's not just a man-made well you know I mean this well is in the promised land it's in Christ and he said that we would draw from this well I mean and we're drink the rivers of living water and we'd never thirst again so she's gonna come live by different well hallelujah it's the same thing with you and I I mean this water hasn't run out it's still sweet the word is still sweeter still refreshing and given us strength hallelujah it's still wonderful that's why the word gets richer I mean so now she's come to live by different wealth so now when she sees Isaac says she's heard about Isaac but now they're gonna meet halfway I'm in-between the tenth Sarah's tent right and and we're there they're gonna meet in the field and the Eventide amen you go look in the scripture a lot of things happen in the evening time a lot of things happen in harvest time as well hallelujah you should go look it's all speaking of this day we're in harvest time and we're in the evening time hallelujah amen I'll go into that later but you know well another time but there's a lot go go read go read and have a jubilee don't get fat on the word holy go a feast you'll enjoy it amen so that's oh here she comes she's meeting her right she's meeting her husband halfway and then when she sees him amen then she comes off a camel now we'll go to the next one okay so I just dropped the son this is the woman at the well give me the drink you know that what is ask him and he would give thee living water the woman said sir thou has nothing to draw with the well is deep from whence hast thou living water at their brethren our Father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and and his children and his cattle and jesus answered said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman said unto sir give me this water that I thirst not Heather I mean neither come hither to draw and then he begins to reveal her past and she says sir when Messiah cometh we'll know he he will do these things that Jesus said I am he a me so now he begins to reveal I mean he is the Messiah he is as well of living water she took a drink as you never thirst it again hallelujah that's exactly like you and I I mean something so let's go back down to Genesis now for she I hates it unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us how lujah lujah I mean it's the same thing with you and I God is becoming more real who is this man our Lord Jesus that comes to meet us halfway meet him and you're to meet him in here because s s because the bride is ascending you know we are ascending I mean in Revelation and in Christ we are ascending we're being lifted up hallelujah and then soon amen we're we'll be gone and so and the servant said it's my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself and the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done so now here comes here comes Rebekah amen and so she sees this man walking in the field and and and the servant points out I mean the message points out this is your husband so what she does is she veils her head as she goes to meet her head I mean because our hitch up is Christ right and the headship is here Christ is here so what so she's not just being humble putting on a veil she says he recognizing this is my head I am his body amen are we not the body of Christ upon the earth a mess why we've come to recognize amen here's her head the word is our head and we are his body hallelujah that's why she veiled herself I mean because she now she's saying well if he is my head he's the intelligence that's why we have no thought coming that's why I says let the mind that was a Christ be in you not your own mind not your own singing but his mind hallelujah and the scripture says but you have the mind of Christ hallelujah and the bride has the mind of Christ why cuz she's united with the headstone glory these are just pearls they're precious to you when you realize you've become one he's made you one with him amen so the bride so that so so this is showing now she's identifying that this man that came to meet her is her head and she is the body and showing that the bride will only recognize the headship of Jesus Christ the word amen now I think I'll leave it there because I'm going to go into something else but let's go to the very last it's got the very last slide and we'll because I I see I asked for team but I've gone far past there now the new birth is Christ it's a revelation God has revealed it to you that this great mystery and that's the new birth and now what are you going to do when you get all that group together with the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manaphy oh if the church only knew its position at will one day this is now amen this is now right then the rapture will go when it knows what it is I mean Rebecca wasn't ordained to stay in her father's house she was ordained to become the bride of Isaac to live in the promised land I mean she was ordained to be his body hallelujah and that's why we have to come to a place we recognize what we are I mean we are the body of Christ not by accident but by design just like Eve was made by design hallelujah you following me God has made us his body by design that we are who we are His Word made flesh and then as the word unites with the word amen we are the word here's the word we become one amen so only the Christ so the reason though I want to end with this is this is what the Seventh Seal I mean you go look it through at the scripture you take Adam and Eve you just take now this is just me no doubt it'll unfold cause the word has a habit of unfolding but you take Adam and Eve in the garden dominion over the earth to me that's the manifestation of the seventh seal and you take that pattern and you go through the scripture with it and you'll see whenever a woman is elevated to her position hallelujah you take Ruth you take Rahab amen you know you take Esther you take all these different ones you'll see what's that the seven seals manifesting itself again you take Rebecca amen and so these things are there that you would know this is who you are in Christ there are shadow pointing to you I mean as is only at the church only knew its position we are ears of the Father joint ears with the son hallelujah it will one day in here in the rapture will go I mean let's stand to our feet shall we where the musicians please hallelujah that we have that song in the on the projector where is of the father I mean you love the Lord
