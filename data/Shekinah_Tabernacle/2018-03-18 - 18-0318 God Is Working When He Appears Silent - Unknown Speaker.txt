Amen I mean thank you thank you musicians I mean good morning everyone it's great to have everyone here this morning just you'll feel at home amen just as you want to take your Bibles and turn to first Kings chapter one so we're going to have church lunch at the Stokes valley community hub at 12:30 we have the booking from - just a reminder that it's a library as well some of the children come if we just keep them and we're we're going to have lunch first we can eat them in and then after that we're going to have the AGM either there or here depending on time it means let's turn to first Kings chapter 1 and then we're going to go to we're going to read a scripture from Matthew 26 I heard a bit of preaching along these lines and I kind of took a bit of a thought and I wanted to expand it out it's very interesting I want to if I could title this before we read I want to preach on God is working when he appears to be silent and it's his first kings one I'm gonna read down here it says now King David was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he get no heat where for his servants said unto him let us let there be sought for my lord the king of young virgin let her stand before the king and let her cherish him and let her lie my bosom that my lord the king may get heat so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel and found Abishag Humanite and brought her to the king and the damsel was very fair and cherished the king and ministered to him but the king knew her not now we'll come back to those but see no notice now then at a Niger the son of hagath exalted himself saying I will be king and he prepared of chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him and his father had not displeased him at any time and saying why has thou done so and he was a very goodly man and his mother being be him after Absalom and he confirmed conferred with Joab the son of Zuria and abbath of the priests and they follow and they following Adonai Gaea helped them amen and know we'll go to I don't have this on the overhead but we go to Matthew 26 and we're gonna read from verse 67 and then when God appears to be silent he is working hallelujah and so Matthew 26 and we'll read from verse 69 down to verse 75 there's a very familiar piece of Scripture Peter Peter following Jesus when Jesus is on trial and Peter comes to this great trial hallelujah God knows how to shave us down God knows how to prove God knows how to mold us a man Jesus wasn't talking a whole bunch but he was working God was working amen now Peter set without the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also was with Jesus of Galilee but he denied before them all saying I know not what they'll say and when he was gone into the porch and other maid saw him and said unto him that were there this fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth and again he denied with an oath saying I know not the man and after a while came unto Him as they stood by and said to Peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech betray a thief amen Nina then began he to curse and to swear saying I know not the man and immediately the crowed and Peter remembered the words of Jesus which said unto him before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly Amen may the Lord bless his word this morning you may have your seats that seems like very different kind of Scripture but I want to just I want to just show you when God appears silent he is working and it's always in the silent times really when God is actually wanting to prove or to reveal what's really in people we read here in 1st Kings where David had become old he had been he was established in his kingdom he was on the throne he had taken the taken the fullness of of the promised land and but he had come to a point in the movement where where now he was old and now people begin to worry you know what is going to happen to our King and we see here it was not David you know it was not David that said I need someone to warn me it wasn't David that said I need some external help of man to keep me alive it was the people around him were worried that that their King had lost was losing strength that he was going to die they were begin to get worried that the word that had established the kingdom was losing its strength because it was getting old I mean this message is still is alive today as it was when it was first ministered I mean the Gospels the Bible we read is not as as strong as as strong today as we know as when God inspired man to put it on paper it has not lost strength it has not lost any of its ability to redeem to transform amen to deliver to heal a mentor set people free to give you - to give spiritual sight amen it still has the same power that it was written in and the intent that it was delivered to man that power is still here and has not gotten old out God does not get old he does not lose his strength he doesn't lose his heat he does not lose his ability amen he still as powerful and as strong as the day when he first said let there be Sun Moon and stars amen and we're so thankful this morning that he has released a path through his word Amen that God has sent his transforming power upon the earth hollowly to change people from from living in darkness into light I mean from transforming them from sinners into Saints hallelujah from taking a people that were that were united with Satan in the world having a breaking that Union and he knighted me with himself I mean that they become the bride of Jesus Christ I mean that power is still here we don't need to have prop it up we don't need to find something to give it hate I mean we don't need to make it palatable every to the world it's still powerful it still has the ability to do what he promised he will do hallelujah but these men got worried how King is not giving he's got an old we've been walking with him for a while and he's aging but they did not understand that now had come a transition period in Israel where once it was a period of war and conquest but now had come a time where it was going to go from a time of conquest and war to a time of peace I mean where the temple would be built where stones and different different materials from from outside of Israel hallelujah we are here the Bible says we are living stones we are living stones hello lively stones Peters's and the stones they quarried and the wood and much of the materials from the temple didn't come from Israel they came from Gentile places hallelujah and God has found you you may have been in some some hole someplace doesn't matter where you came from but God when he was when he saw his bride before the foundation of the world he saw you he saw you maybe you're a little finger or you're a you're a bird or a spleen or whatever part of the body you were God isn't worried what part of the body you are he knows you're the pilot body he made you to live a certain function of the body hallelujah can be an eyebrow whatever more as long as you're part of the body hallelujah I mean so God knew where you'd be and you've been healed out of some pit hallelujah just like they had to go they think warriors they're too part of a Gentile world to to cut out the stones shake them bring them back to Israel hallelujah the same thing God has done for us I mean we were not even part of the Commonwealth of God far away someplace but God knew you had to be part of the building I mean so he said he said laborers they mean to go shoo you out hallelujah he said stonemasons to hew you out I mean this this message is the master stonemason I mean God knows how to shape his building God knows how to prepare human heart hallelujah and then now we've been gathered this was the season that that that Israel was coming into it and we know we're already part of that season but certain things had to be changed in the kingdom and people spirits had to be driven out that had no place in the kingdom for in the temple was coming together there was a change in dispensation was occurring so it wasn't now as I see it David David wasn't concerned he was cold God's not concerned what kind of state you know do we worship God this is not part of it but I've been pondering this thought for a while do we worship God based on our situation or the blessings or doing worship God of who he is do you worship God because of who he is or or because the blessings he may give you or your situation why do you worship Him I worship Him because of who he is hallelujah not based on your situation while you may going through and and whatever God is dealing with you and I wouldn't I wouldn't worship Him based on that I'd won't worship Him because of who he is hallelujah and so now they brought Abhishek they found Abhishek and now Abhishek the name it actually is from it means the father of era that is a blundering this is this is this person's name so we're going to the father Veera birth - this is an error this is a human ability that that found her - to keep the King warm now man tries to prop up the word but God is really wanting to see what is in the people it wasn't the king as I've seen a few times now it wasn't the king saying I'm cold on he someone to warm me this is man trying to prop up the move of God and you say well why didn't the king say anything the king the King appeared to be silent but God was dealing because the prophesy already come that thy son Solomon will build the temple he was going to be the next king the pattern of the temple actually came to David David begin to click all the materials the gold and different things he began to click materials for the temple he wasn't when God when we when David said to Nathan it's not right I live in a palace basely and God dwells in tents and the Prophet Isis Nathan said do all that's in thine heart and then Nathan goes awake God deals them go back and tell my servant David you know I took you from being a shepherd now I've given you a great name in all the earth but you're a man of war you're a man of blood so you shall not build a temple but your son will build the temple he didn't get he didn't get angry and and and discouraged at God because he couldn't fulfill it the inspiration was there to fulfill but it wasn't this place Amen a true person of God will rejoice the inspiration maybe there but if they know they're not the person for the job they will still rejoice in it hallelujah so he was still rejoicing he was still happy even though he knew in his in his flesh he would not see the temple built because he would had to die before it happened but he was still rejoicing that it was going to happen but now there are there are certain ones that are sitting in the kingdom and the and the conditions have to be right than them now to raise up now this is from brother Johnny DeMuth from our first can be made this statement when human leadership has taken out of the way the hearts of all men are made manifest and I can say that with with women and I could say it this way about God when it appears God is not in control the hearts of all men are made manifest God is always in control when he appears to be silent he is working david was silent on this matter but God allowed it God was working because we read there that after after Abhishek had been found and she was now being used to warm the king let's said then at an idea I'll put it back up let's see then at a night of the son of hagath exalted himself so here's one sitting in the kingdom and and it's got to be dealt with now we're going to come to Peter because it's easy to say well that's that person that that person but Peter needed a shaving down there are parts of Peter that had to be done away with for him to become the spokesman of of the day of Pentecost right so we're going to bring this down to a personal level and so now a teenager was there and he was the he was the brother of of Epsilon and we know what Epsilon did he he won the hearts of Israel and there was a coup and and David had to flee the kingdom and you know those things happen but but when epsilon began to proclaim himself king I mean no before that he he himself actually prepared chariots and horsemen about fifty men going before him and so you see with with with with with family on a natural level if one part the family does something the other part of the family will do it but then an annoyed you didn't wait to try and win the hearts of the people he said no we're just going to proclaim myself King and I'm going to get people of influence around me and then I'm going to take the kingdom this way but there were people that gather - they were ones that gathered - to add an idea that had been worth David the whole time and but these ones they had to be dealt with they had to be dealt with now we read here the ones that gathered to him there was it was Joab and there was a birth of the priests these were men of influence you go read the Bible they were men of influence Joab was was they basically David's right-hand man he's a powerful man in Israel but here was a man who shed the blood he killed innocent men in a time of peace they meant he killed he settled old scores in a time of peace he because he tricked Abner who killed Joe Abe's brother he tricked Abner to come out of a city of refuge and he killed him outside the gate this is the kind of character Joab was this couldn't be this couldn't be in the kingdom at a time of peace this had to be done away with hey all following me these things had to be dealt with and and he also killed another man see he had blood on his hands and this could not continue on as Israel was turning a corner from a time of war and conquest to a time of peace now abathur you see it's a you know it's amazing when people they they are built a certain way and they'll gravitate towards certain things based on how they're made and God allows it to be that way because God is wanting to prove what's in the hearts of all men and women are you following me they meant and so now Joe a job gravitated towards Aaron idea abbath of the priests gravitated towards um towards Aaron idea now epithet a priest he is from Eli's house you'll know the prophecy of Eli's house where Eli was told prophesied to him that his two sons were going to die that his house would be cut off from the priesthood there would come a time where where they could not be proceeding be cut off forever if you go read the prophecy and so he was the last priest from Eli's line and so God God knew prophecies it everything is working to God God is working everything we think sometimes what is going on in this place what is going on in my life and God knows exactly how to tell you God knows how to allow influences in your life to deal with you God knows how to stir up the nest hallelujah even who may be just a little thing here and losing it God knows how to deal with us hallelujah because he has our best interest in mind I mean he has a he has when he thought of me before the foundation of the world he saw the character you would end up in he saw how you'd conduct yourself he saw you made it as image I mean he saw you made in his image and so he now knows because he knows the end from the beginning he knows exactly how I'm going to get them there hallelujah brother Bram said God doesn't just squish this forces through a pipe and just make us overcome and we get spat out the other side er you know overcoming Christian God knows how to use the everyday kind of life and influences of man hallelujah this world this world is actually still in God's control safety he say well Satan's on a rampage God is allowing it amen nothing is out of cater everything is going exactly how it's meant to be we don't need to worry I mean we don't need to worry abut the world just get a blood cell apart we don't need to worry amen we don't need to be concerned about it when you see Jesus said when you see the end come lift up your heads before you know your redemption draws nigh that's what he said lift up your heads hallelujah we should be I've been the happiest people in all the world sure we should be burdened for the loss that I'm done and and the merely religious out there but we should be so happy all old he said when you see these things you've opened my eyes that the prophecy you can see it material in front of you understand and you've caused me to see it you've caused me to understand where I am hallelujah and you gave me instruction when you see these things lift up your heads before you know your Redemption draweth nigh I mean our attention to what the change in this body hallelujah hallelujah so now Eli I'm so at an idea edan idea was part of Eli's house he had to be taken out of the way it's easier not to embers of the priest said the king this is now David this is David committing all judgment to Solomon as the father has committed all judgment to the son yeah and on to empathy the priest said the King get thee to an earth off unto thine own fields thou I say this is actually him speaking directly to him forgive me for thou art worthy of death but I will not at this time put me to death because thou bearest the Ark of the Lord God before David my father Solomon speaking to him and because thou has been afflicted and all were and my father was afflicted so Solomon thrust out abathur from being a priest unto the Lord that he might fulfill the word of the Lord which he spake concerning the house of Eli and Shiloh God knew God knew this had to happen man God knew whatever that would do and a time where it seems God is silent it's always such a such a troublesome time when a kingship has changed because the king has absolute authority in his realm when he speaks it has to happen I mean it's not a democracy when he speaks that is the law and that's done there's always such a such a troublesome time when a kingship has handed over but now but now they came as a type you know as I said David wasn't saying anything that he wasn't receiving heat and the people got worried how can we keep this going it's a God knew by creating what it appeared to be a vacuum what it appeared to be a vacuum God allowed it to show what is in the people yeah what does in the people now let's go to let's go to Peter for a second Peter we understand no there was no one really like Peter and you know in the in the disciples he was always the one to answer the questions he was the one who walked out upon the water it was him no now stepped out he did and he was he was the one who said if it be you Lord walking on the water let me walk out too you know and I said that even here he was built you know all the apostles were built different ways just like we're all built different ways all different kind of personalities different ages God knoweth God as a God of variety amen and he wants his people to work together in harmony and so here was Peter Peter was the one when Jesus said who do men say that I am he said you're a Jeremiah Elias or one of the prophets and then so but then Jesus said who do you say that I am it was Peter who said thou art the Christ maybe he's always the one in class to put his hand up first me meet me you know and so he was the one who answered it and then he said you're blessed art thou simon simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to thee but my father which is in heaven that must have made him feel real good or God's revealing things to me hallelujah I received revelation I'm not just caught up with the crowd has become personal it's become personal to me now there was a genuine revelation from God but the problem is there still Peters humanity was still operating as humanity was still living and he had to God had to get rid of it he didn't change Peters personality Peter was still the same man who walked on the water was the same man who who preached on the day of Pentecost he has built a certain way he didn't changing from being blusterous this rugged old fisherman to bingham you know a little scholarly guy he's still the same but God had to take his humanity and get rid of it that God could fully express himself through because a different season had come now now the living stones are coming amen John the Baptist gathered people to introduce him to their bridegroom he was the one who introduced the people to Jesus that was his ministry Alleluia sir living stones were being gathered by a voice crying in the wilderness amen and in the and then the head of the corner came to his temple and he began to gather stones even again you know when he came out of the wilderness but after being tempted by Satan he began to call Peter James a girl John he was gathering stones hallelujah he is gathering stones to the building but they had to be molded and shaped and Peter had to be molded and shaped he was the one who Jesus saw the vision of someone having a sword you know trying to defend him in the garden how many sauce do we have they said to Jesus's there'll be enough Peter packs a sword because he's not gonna let anything happened to his Lord I'll die with you he says you know this has got to be taken God's got a God's got a mold God's got a shape he's gonna he can't fit into the building that way a man he can't fit into the building that way even though he's a living you know he's a stone that's the predestinated to be in the building he can't fit that way God's got to shave him off hallelujah praise God for the shaving time hey man so now here he comes with a sword and and here comes Judas Jesus said when he was preaching he had five thousand people in a meeting he preaches about you know certain things you must eat my flesh and drink my blood unless you have no power you have no life you have no part of me and he ends up with twelve everyone forsook him and then and then Peter says to him Lord you know Jesus turns to his disciples after he's had five thousand and and their ball lifts he's only got a small group and and and Jesus looks I'm saying will you go also and Peter's will the one who said to whom shall we go we know that thou has the words of eternal life he made me thought himself that sounded pretty good he's got this character it's got to be dealt with but then Jesus said don't you know that you know what have you had the devil and there's only 12 people Jesus knew who Judas was but the opposite of the right scenario had to be presented for what was in Judas to come out amen what was then Judas had to come out what was in Peter had to come out and so now Jesus at what it appears it used to be not long before the thousands of people flocked to his meetings great healings were done supernatural was done he spoke words that no one else had spoken before thousands flocked to him but then there came a time where not many were following him anymore and no doubt maybe Judas because Judas never really believed that this was the prince of life he didn't really believe this was the Messiah it had not become personal to him and so that's why and then and he got offended at Jesus you know about how the woman came with the with the great amount of spices your alabaster box and anointed him for us for his burial and and and he was offended at it because he because he said this this woman has done great waste we could have sold us and gave the money to the poor but in the Gospel of John that that profit anointing could look beyond his words and as he as but he as a thief I mean it could go beyond what man would say oh that sounds like a good thing he wants to distribute to the poor but actually deep down in his heart he was a thief amen and so now and so he got offended of Jesus leave her alone she does a good work and he's thinking they didn't do good but she didn't do a good work she's just a waster he got offended at the Christian the Messiah correcting Judas he couldn't take the correction they thought no how can i betray him I don't know how his thought process came to that conclusion but it came to that conclusion and so now the opportunity was arisen as we know he went to the chief priests and scribes and he said now I know how you can get him and secret where there's not a whole bunch of people around and then we come to the Garden of Gethsemane and here's Peter the mighty fisherman Peter with a sword Rita defenders Lord because he even said he had a revelation thou art the Christ but at the same time he said when Jesus begin to say I have to go and you I'm gonna be placed into the hands of wicked men and be crucified Jesus said I mean Peter said to him you will not do this you will not die and here's a man who has a revelation this is the Christ manifested in the flesh and then he's actually now trying to withstand the very program of God because of his humanity amen and so now here's the Spanish says no you will not die and then actually Jesus says get behind me Satan because he actually sees the inspiration coming through that man get behind me Satan amen this must be done I'm just paraphrasing and Ed limping a little bit and then so now he's Peter in the garden I'm gonna defend my Lord I'm all gung ho pulls a sword he's a fisherman tries to tries to take the word tries to tries to defend defend the word I mean defend the resurrected one with the word and all he does is cut off someone's ear so they can't hear anymore this is him in a zeal but because the stone had to be shaved I mean they had to be shaping of the stone because this was Peter and his building and him trying to trying to defend the Lord Jesus all he did was cut one man's ear off he wasn't even aiming for his ear he's praying for his head but he was a fisherman he wasn't a swordsman amen and many people in their zeal they'll take the word and I'll try and defend it and they'll just cut someone's ear off that they can't hear but then the mass needs to come and touch their ear and heal it again that they can hear I mean we're going to be careful how we willed this weapon we're going to be real careful how we wield this thing about we're standing for truth and your master swordsman amen this does not mean to be a friendly fire kind of thing we don't wrestle against flesh and blood we don't wrestle against one another I mean we don't wrestle against flesh and blood this is not a flesh and blood affair there's a there's a warfare against demon power in high places I mean where our enemy is not one another our enemy is the devil hey man and so we don't want to we don't want to have a lot of collateral damage around the place what's the point of you know there's I don't know what it's called but they're such a when it comes to victories in warfare where the one who actually wins the battle ultimately will lose the war because they lost too many casualties we don't want to be like that we don't want to be like that we want to you know we want to get complete victory no casualties on our side all of the enemy so they meant to here's Peter now he's defending you know he's defending trying to defend the Lord he just cuts off one man's ear but then he's got to come to this point because it's amazing when you think about it Jesus told them before the crows three times I mean before the crows you'll deny me three times and he looked into the eyes of the word and he basically said in his heart I will not he's the man who knows what's going to happen he's already seen it in vision he's already seen it in vision and he Stanley saying basically no you're wrong you're wrong the word you are wrong God has to shave it off and so he comes down east and and he's following he's following the Lord there and now here come here come woman and say aren't you one of them God knows how to actually humiliate us do you know that God knows what our ash heap is like job God wants us on the a she sometimes we have to be there job is sitting on an ash heap it appears God is not speaking but God is working I mean God knows had a mold and shape our character hallelujah it's through suffering our character is moulded it's through trials it's not the rejoicing times hallelujah amen is through it's through suffering and trial that our character is molded but he wants to mold our character he wants us to be in his image hallelujah it's like in Hebrews chapter 1 it says that Jesus was the Express image of his person and that in the Greek expressed image is like an engraving tool someone's taken at all had shaped an image amen this is an engraving tool he'll take his tool in and he'll and he will mold you engrave it upon your heart amen it's not some fluffy pillow nice time I think I'm going to engrave this I'm going to carve it into you hallelujah I'm gonna carve you into my image hallelujah I'm glad he does it don't you I'm glad we don't just have the character of the world I'm glad we have christ-like character because it's him doing it it's not a learned behavior I mean it's not a learned behavior God changes our nature God changes our thinking I mean God changes our outlook on life hallelujah and so Paul Peter needed a shaving down any and he any lifts it says after the crew he remember what Jesus said his pride just took a took a knock and he wept bitterly because he said before that I'll not deny you then the pressure comes down and he denies and he swears and he gives an oath I do not know this man and now he's honors a sheep now now he's ready now he's ready to be shaped you may have heard the story many times we could hear it one more time because we can't just talk about Etta Niger and and and abathur and Joab and say well they weren't part of the next move of God therefore they had to get away with no spirits had to be taken out of the kingdom spreads had to be taken out of the kingdom and the same thing with Peter Peter could not be the one of their Pentecost to preach the first Church sermon amen if he was in that condition and so now he came unto his heir sheep he wasn't rejoicing he was weeping bitterly he was weeping bitterly and now he's in the right spot for God to mold him and God to shape him and then and then the Lord Racer X as he said he would and he's there on any and he tells them come to Galilee and then they're fishing because they just go back to what they always did and then they see Jesus now on the on the shore and then John John says to Peter it's the Lord and he jumps into the water swims towards him he doesn't know if he's forgiven he doesn't know if he's been forgiven of that Judas wouldn't hang himself Judas we don't hang himself Peter doesn't know where he is he's being molded sometimes God lets us God is silent but God is molding it appears when God appears to be silent his word is continuing on as it always has but if we try and put our own human ability into what trying to fill what we think is a void it will fail and an I just saw a void in the kingdom and it failed Joab saw a bullied in the kingdom and it failed abathur saw a void in the kingdom what he thought and it failed amen because they did not continue in the line of God's Word amen and so if we humanly put out put it we're going to put our hands to it and try and steady the shippers of where in our humanity it will fail and God wants us to trust him even when he appears to be silent because God's love for us is not like parental care where us as parents want to protect our children from all the bad that is not him his love his love is he licked of love I mean he said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated he loved before they were born he loved Jacob and he hated Esau I mean you say that's not fair I say praise God I'm a Jacob hallelujah praise God I'm a Jacob before I was even upon the earth or even a thought maybe in my parents mind God thought of me and God chose me and God loved me was an elective love and he may commit you to suffering like he did job or he may commit you to hardship like Paul law or any of the Saints down through the ages he may commit you to suffering like that but that doesn't mean God does not love you hallelujah may because God if he has chosen you before the foundation of the world like a scripture has said God does not change his mind I mean God does not say one day yes and one day no based on where you may think he may be hallelujah Amen time you know we judge things so much my time I mean people that's like the Christian walk is like Google real-time analytics things change and we're and we're just watching a graph move up and down and we think well we're doing good we're doing bad whatever more and I'm I'm you know I can take a rapture now and then the next moment how am I ever going to get there and we're up and down and God just looks through just just looks at us Amen God knows how to deal with us he has an end result in mind he's and he's determined he is that he is determined more than any person can ever be determined because he said this is going to happen and nothing's going to stop it happening amen and Peter you know Jesus knew because because after the Passover was fifty days till peanut cost I think it's about that 50 days Pentecost is 50 so now God knows I have to get Peter and shape because no one else was going to be the spokesman there on the day of Pentecost I've got to get this one in shape and I've got this amount of time Alleluia he knew half how he is going to get him his shape real quickly amen he knew how to get him in shape because he had at a predestinated moment he was going to be in an upper room and God was going to fulfill the promise of the Prophet Joel I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh and he knew exactly the 120 that would be there and he knew the one that would preach to all those ones who are mocking them they meant he knew who was going to do it and he knew I have to get the stone in the building in the right place for that to happen Alleluia that's the same with us friends you have to just keep it in mind if God has chosen you that doesn't mean we just sit back and watch the world go by amen but God as we misunderstand God's dealing with us so much I think we must understand when we're going through a trial we have an or between someone and things are going on God is willing to prove what's in you just like job and abathur and and at an idea or even Peter or Judas he's wanting to prove what is in you what is in you it's very easy I mean to say you love someone when they're good to you but how much more now when they're bad to you and divine love is not human love human love is based on condition divine love is not based on condition amen and so it's very easy oh yes we have divine love I mean one between the other well that may be all be fine when we're having a honeymoon kind of time but wait till the everyday kind of life and there's children running around and hardship comes and uncertainty arises you know now there's got to be a proof of the love you still love me now amen they used to love me now well I don't know anymore well it can't be divine love their divine love doesn't change God can't love us any more than he already does well he would he what do you mean the fullness of his love was expressed that down Calvary what God became a man to redeem himself I mean to redeem us back to God there was a fool for God so loved the world that's expression of his love that he gave his only begotten son that whoever should believe on him should not perish but have everlasting life we all know that Scripture do we know that was excellent that was God expressing his love and God sending this message in the end time that's God's love being expressed because he doesn't want you to go into a tribulation he wants you to go into a rapture why did God send Malachi for upon the earth as that a people would become rapture ready hallelujah amen so we we misunderstand God's dealings but just because God is silent it does not mean that he's not working see if I can find this Paul had another Paul had the same kind of experience he had a very powerful ministry he affected a lot of people as we know but they came a point where some of the people who had seen God manifested powerfully through Paul's life they thought he became to be a bit washed up and one of them was Dimas he sees in second Timothy demas has has forsaken me preferring you know the other pleasures of this world or something like that but brother Behrman in present stage of my ministry he sees this now I mentioned Dimas didn't forsake him and start off to nightclubs I don't imagine Dimas did that because Dimas was a spiritual man he was a great helper if he ever took the history of Dimas he was a he was a notable preacher a fine cultured man highly policy Decatur he was a smart man but why would he forsake pool that's the thing what made him do it forsake Paul I don't believe you wanted to go to a nightclub or anything but I believe it was God separating Paul but I imagine Dimas let's take some of Dimas as thoughts as I was sitting down on the hillside wondering the other day about daylight I was thinking why would Dimas want to leave that fellow why would he leave that poor little preacher and lead him to the that lead him to the Lord the man who spearheaded the revival among the Gentiles a prophet indeed no one could say but he was a prophet he was more than a prophet he was an apostle and a great and mighty apostle to the Gentiles and Dimas would have associated with Paul had fellowship and seen the Spirit of God move upon that man and why would he turn his back on such a person as that had been vindicated that he was a servant of Christ but do you notice Paul loving this a Paul said about Dimas loving this present world I don't think Dimas back slid I don't think he did that but I think he got the wrong opinion of Paul now Adiemus came out of a rich family he was wealthy and money sometimes means religion to people like they say in California if you haven't got three Cadillacs you're not spiritual so it means if you're not successful if you don't have the finest church here in the city the people won't go it's almost that way here proves to you you've got to have the finest church in the country or they say well you mean you joined up with their little bunch like that did did you know our Lord didn't have a place to lay his head did you know he only owned one coat see and he had it he isn't just the kind of a person was pushed about and he didn't have no place to lay his head but he couldn't but they couldn't have thought the same thing and did about him and now I believe Dimas saw a failing seemingly in Paul's ministry I think that he thought that the old fellow was washed up before God now he thought that our people that that would pluck out their eyes you know to give it to Paul because Paul had the thorn in the flesh we see our own lives lead us to you because he gives riding it by himself because he couldn't see very well see here was Dimas now because DeMuth because God was singing now what does some demon what does in Dimas oh looks like Paul's washed up what is he gonna do when human leadership has taken now Paul wasn't taking other way as removed off the scene but when human leadership is taking the other way the hearts of all men are made manifest so when it looks like the leadership is out of the way or when it appears to be silent like in David's day the hearts of all men are made manifest and it's the same thing today we know appears that God is silent when it appears that he is not in control God is doing it now I'm going to close with this because I want you to ponder these things God is doing it for a purpose because he's wanting to see are you here only for the good times and the shouting and the rejoicing and the screaming or are you here we can week out I'm talking about your walk with God is it just because of his blessings well because you've seen more of the scripture than maybe a lot of other people like Peter thou art the Christ is some living God blessed art thou simon barjona flesh and blood has not revealed to this to thee but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock the spiritual revelation of who Jesus Christ is I'll build my church why are you still walk what does guys want to see what's in you you say well we're the salt of the earth well God's going to prove your saltiness God's going to prove your saltiness are you just salty to people that that that are believers or you salty to the world a salty to those ones who annoy you in the world around the church God's wanting to prove the salt and listen about divine love do you love anyone I mean irrespective of how they may treat you God's going to prove it just like job job was proved well not a story of joke joke joke loved the Lord but then it was now proven Satan's him well he only loves you because everything goes fine and then God say no that's not why he serves me and now then Satan of course he doesn't believe God says well prove it basically and then so the edge of protection was taken away Satan came up to the very borderline of that he was allowed to go you know Satan can't just he's he is bound by God's Word Satan is bound by God's Word and so now he comes into the very borderline the first time he just takes everything he can he doesn't know it's his body and then now he comes up before God yo the second time and God says see job still loves me John job still serves me and then so now but the in Satan says it's because his own health hasn't gone I mean got a litte sickness strike you heal allowed to happen to see what is your faith built on as it built on because everything's going well or is it built on the fact that he is God and you're his child irrespective of condition what is your faith built upon and Jared even in all those trials and his friends coming before him and telling him he's a secret sinner and God is too big to be interested in the lives of man all these things all those things he still stood amen now what about you because if you're still where Peter was God knows had a credit situation but I'm an apostle Gardner's had a credit situation but I'm the bride God knows how to create a situation but I'm going at a rapture God knows had a credit situation but everything God knows how to cry situation to see what's in you because we have to count father's gold God is not having a having a people that's a bunch of fools gold and gold and rock and stuff all molded into one pure gold and gold represents deity in the scripture feedin gold was put on the ark in some places I mean so that deity would be beaten to cover the wood and the Aqua just humanity Alleluia and Jesus was was beaten gold he was mad above any man I mean that their deity could cover humanity that when you see the ark you don't see the wood you don't see the humanity you see the deity Alleluia and we have to come forth as gold as well amen let's have some musicians please if you want to come I want you to ponder these things are you gonna put your head to it in your humanity keep things going or he just gonna allow God be God I mean I would allow God to be God because he knows what he's doing I mean really what it boils down to is when we lose confidence and we have to put our hand to it it takes because we've lost confidence in God I'd keep my confidence of Oz you if he's brought you thus far why did he bring you this far you see the devil still what you know you go read I think I've seen it a few Sundays ago see we're go read through the Bible and see where all the believers failed and the devil will come against you in the same way in the same way everywhere he came in he came against I became against every believer he'll come against you the same way you know you gotta study your enemy you can't just think we're on some nice flowery meadow and everything's all happy and pink clouds and you know we have an enemy and the enemy studies how you use the word he studies you because he wants to dis army from your weapon see you got to study him amen I mean let's I don't know let's just stand shall we I mean How Great Thou art do you have that oh praise the Lord yep yeah how great they want this thing How Great Thou art yeah that actually I can't really read that maybe I need glasses but isn't he great we should worship Him because of who he is hey man he's the everlasting father Prince of Peace the mighty God he's our lamb he's our advocate he's our high priest he's a comforter he's a intercessor he's a mediator he's our Redeemer
