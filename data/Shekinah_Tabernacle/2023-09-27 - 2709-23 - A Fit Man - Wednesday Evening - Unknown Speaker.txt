bless those that couldn't make it this evening we pray in Jesus wonderful name amen praise the Lord God bless you all this morning thank you David thank you musicians very good I think they always get nervous when I'm sitting in the seats and whenever something goes wrong they all quite a few of them look over towards me oh no how are you all this evening you good that's good it's good to be here do you know I actually um I don't have an opening scripture I know but we got we've got scriptures but I just because I don't really want to say what it's about at the start it's just the way that it's a God I'm not trying to be like different or anything but I just tried to put one in and I didn't really get any I couldn't put any in there but but we are preaching the word of God and you know we don't like to venture out without any Authority so um um let's you can actually you can have your seats now um because I've got I've got a little thought that if I kind of I just want to tell a story and it's it's going to end up in a Bible story but I don't really want to say what it's about at the start and then that's not to try and trick you or to get you into a little place and tie you in knots or anything but it's just you know sometimes in our walk with God we sometimes actually don't quite know sometimes where we are and we just have to go by faith you know we sometimes we get the answers and we understand and we can see clearly other times we we just don't know at all or was that just me so you know brother Brandon would do this quite a bit he would talk about a story like he would dramatize Maybe um Nathaniel and Philip you know he would although there's just a small snippet in the Bible about them he would sort of take the backstory I suppose and dramatize what it would be like and maybe what the weeks before that were in the months before and how they were friends and all what they would do and then then he would wind up in the five or so verses that we hear about them but you know it's just we're not adding to the word of God we just kind of you know we're just going about it that way so so I want to just take you on a bit of a journey with with a with the character and this character is not David by the way because you all thought it was David when you saw that but he wasn't the only one that had sheep in the Old Testament he wasn't the only Shepherd um and then you'll and then I'll end up somewhere and you'll you'll know where it is are you happy tonight you're good had a good week yeah it's good to see you all here I know you all quite well so it's and I know the different things you're going through and it's I feel privileged to be up here and to be able to minister humbled but but privilege that the Lord would allow me to just speak something speak some Faith you know because we just want we want we want to speak Faith because we that's we win every battle by faith and the word of God you know we want to speak Faith to the people and and encourage one another and walk forward you know we have enough negative things in our life day by day when we come together we want to just believe in faith and move forward and be be victorious we don't want anything negative or down or you know we're not into that we're just into moving forward and we're victorious in Christ who's victorious in Christ you're all winners when you accepted Christ you won The Greatest Prize there ever was you know so your your winners before you even need to start and get you were a winner in fact when you before you were born you were a winner you already won before you were born but so that's that's my thoughts on that so so this this character here he was a just a a boy that what that was from the children of Israel so he was brought up understanding the ways of God and in his heart he had a desire for the things of God and he always did enjoy rating the the Scrolls and the law and the the Psalms you know he would he would enjoy the things of God he had a heart for God it was it wasn't foreign to him or it wasn't something of a struggle he actually genuinely enjoyed just speaking about God and hearing that the priests speak about speak the word of God and talking to his parents about the Lord and he was quite an active boy so he would like to be outside more than he would like to be inside very active do you still like to run and play sports and ride donkeys and kick around with his mates you know it was an act of one of those active kids like Reuben well probably every story doesn't matter how which line you go which generation back a thousand years you know you know and um you know and he would he that his his village was in those days just small villages but I guess it wasn't too long before you're in the countryside and he would you know when he got a bit older he would venture out and go go go out to the the countryside there and maybe go to the bottom of the hills there and walk around and go out in the morning come back in the evening and he would enjoy running too often he'd often just run this and run there and run back he just enjoyed the fresh air and and that he would even sometimes I guess when he got a bit older would Camp a note or two out there and learn to live off the land but back in those days you'd almost naturally lived off the land more than you did now but you know he would go out be by himself and just be be uh energetic I suppose you'd say and when he got a bit older he was a hard worker he was a good man he would work hard he would you know wake up in the morning and do what if it was summer he would he would reap if it was Winter he would sow he wasn't one of those foolish sons that went when the you know you can't be bothered sowing the seed when it was time to sew and Solomon talked about that the fullest son that's like that and harvest he goes begging because he couldn't be bothered getting out of bed in the cold winter morning and plowing the ground and getting it all ready for the spring and sowing the seeds you know but this this this boys who grew up to be a man he he wasn't like that and um they they got to know him as being this quite an energetic man and I can imagine maybe in the village a brother would come back after being away for maybe a few years and he would say where is where is my where is my brother and he would say oh your brothers he's out in the way out in the fields there it was may have been a shepherd and so he would want to see his brother and they would say oh let's send we'll send this we know a man that can go out there and maybe the whole day run to where he was and tell him your brother's here come back to see him so he would always get the job of doing these errands because they knew that he was he was a like an energetic a fit guy you know and they would he would get the job of doing that you know and he would run out there and tell the brother after a whole day of running he'll get there and say hey your brother's here and he wants to see you he's arrived back after years and they would all make their way back or maybe maybe that's why maybe uh maybe a woman just gave birth and the husband was out doing the same thing out shepherding and so this man will get the job of of running out there and going and getting him and bringing them back in because he knew the land quite well he knew the different areas where they were and and he loved the Lord he had a heart for God he was he was he would study in the evenings and just read the word of God and and not just do it but apply it in his own life like all of you do he was just like you you all love the Lord you read the word of God you apply it to your life and that this was he was of the same nature the same attitude I suppose you would say then one day an older man we've been older than him he came to him with a request and before he said his requests he said I want to I want to tell you why I'm going to ask you this certain thing he said I was I got into some trouble you know about 10 10 years ago when I was when I when I was working that and I ended up buying a lot of money and I had to I had to go go off to a far country and and serve the person that I owed money to and for about eight years I had to serve there and I paid this this man off what I owed him and then the time as the time went by and my debt went down and down the time came that I could make my way back back home back here and the place where we were was was and I was it was way up over the hills way way way over there outside of where we live you know it wasn't it wasn't one of our people it was way over there and he said he said on the way back I I had to work for a bit longer because I had to pay money to another one of this rich man's friends that had a camel train and he was passing through and passing through our village and I had to so I caught a ride with that Camel train they wouldn't give it to me for free I had to keep working for this man to pay his other rich man the man he worked for was a just a very selfish rich man and the other the man that had the camel train was too and he said when we were going back we on the main trail we came across a little house and there was a family there and it there were Whispers around the camel train that actually this this man there actually also owed this the man that was running the camel train he owed him some money too and and he was going to collect it on his way through but the man had nothing really to give and all he had was a a little nanny goat so he didn't have much left and you know this rich man being a selfish man just thinking about himself in his own game didn't wouldn't didn't show any Mercy to this man and just said well if that's we've got to take that you know and and this man would watch that store scenario unfold and he he saw the merciless act that the rich man did just taking this guy's it was his last goat taking it away and if he he thought to himself you know if I had a if I had a hundred dollars in my pocket I'd buy the goat off the man and give it back but he didn't have anything he was he spent his last dollar his last money he could with the camel train and so but just as he was leaving he he said to the poor man that had just been this goat being taken he said look I I don't have any money I'd love to help you I can't do anything I can't really uh get upset at this man and probably throw me off the camel train and then you know I'll be even worse but he said look as much as what I can maybe when I get back to my Village I could ask around and try and borrow a little bit of money and I'll I'll buy this goat back I'll try and talk to the man before he carries on through and I'll I'll buy this goat back and he said I'll have to borrow money to buy it but but I'll get it into kid and when it has another little kid then I'll I'll bring a kid back to you now you just felt something on his heart I want to do that for you he was a I guess a good Christian man too and just in a in a moment of compassion so he said look leave this with me I'll try and do this so he did get back and when he got back to his village where this other man lived he managed to just scrape up enough money borrowed from different people to to he's to buy this goat from the Richmond he said I want to buy this that little goat so he they agreed on a price and he bought the goat and he followed through with what he said he he put the goat to a The Nanny to a billy goat and they had this little baby this kid and he let the kid you know grow up that's why I don't like calling our kids kids because the kid is a baby goat oh it's kind of say children because I don't really like referring to our children as baby goats but I know it's the probably not the same word but that there is a kid so he this kid grew up a little bit and it was time now we thought this kid this this little kid is big enough now that it can make the journey so he went to this man he said look that's the story and I've got this kid he said if anyone has the capacity to be able to take take this kid way back up way over those mountains to this man that's you you're the one I know you're fit I know you you you go out in the hills for a few days at a time and I know you're You're Made for This you can you've done this before so I would really appreciate you know I can't give you any money for it I don't I don't have anything I I just this is you know you know me I've been struggling since I got back but I just want to bring this kid back to the man he said would you do that for me and this man being a good man he said yeah I'll do that for you I can feel the the goodness the sweetness in the moment and in the story and I think you know I feel of the Lord this is a good thing to do I I can't see anything in me that would not want to help the situation and I've got the time and so he said yeah I'll do it now this little kid was a wee bit scattery a little bit a little bit frightened you know he was it would sort of run aware but it wasn't it wasn't really tame I don't think the man really um held it a lot when it was growing up so it wasn't really used to human interaction it was a it was not wild but it was you know just used to being out with this mother out in the field so different than like a little animal that you have in your house and it's always around it gets used to humans but this one wasn't wild but it wasn't exactly used to humans you couldn't easily pet the goat but it was tame enough so so he he began his journey walked along the you know along the Plains and the man said to him I'll tell you where the house is if you just follow the main trail you'll get way up the top and around the top view and you can't miss the house it's it's around maybe a week's journey and then up around the top somewhere you'll see a you'll see the certain house there and you'll come across it if you stay on the man Trail you'll come across and you'll be able to give this go back to this man so so he made this journey walked along the planes had his goat with him and then he he gets to the bottom of these Hills and he's he's goes you know up the hills and it's he maybe stay the night there and then he would carry on a bit longer but the goat was still a wee bit flighty you know so that was it was always he'd always have to keep the goat close to him because he was worried this little thing would possibly run away so he's he's up up near the top right up right up on the Rocky Mountain Pass and it's you know we saw on his feet but saw in his hands he's used to going there but maybe not that far this is a furthest he's been he hasn't been up the top here before where is where he's going and and he just got sidetracked at one point with the viewer and looked around and then didn't realize that when he looked back this Little Goat Head sort of shot off around around the side of these rocks he said oh the little goats taken off I better go and catch this little goat before it yeah before before the thing runs away so he he walks over to where the goat was around this ledge and he starts to scale the side of the the rock face it's quite steep but goats are very good in Rocky places he starts to scale around the side to get the scope in his hands are a bit sore because he's grabbing onto the sharp rocks and the maybe old sticks that are coming out of the bank we're not talking green shoots we're talking everything goes to Thorns there and it's you know and he's trying to scale the side of this little pass and he his foot slips and he he's near the goat but as his foot slips he slips around and kicks the goat with his foot as he swings around and picks the goat and the Goat starts to Tumble down the hill now of course the goat also thinks that he's kicked the goat because he doesn't like the goat already being a scared goat anyway it's kicked this little goat in the goat the goat you know just starts tumbling down and he he starts tumbling down too and he's going down this very very Rocky Face and he's trying to stop himself and his hands are being grazed and his knees and his legs and he's he's in quite a predicament maybe when he's in that state he's saying Lord help me I'm slipping down this bank and he's just trying to grab on and the goats quite a way down below him now but goats are reasonably robust especially young ones and they can find their footing quite well and even if they fall down a bit they can sort of get back up but so this goat sort of Falls quite quickly all the way down to the bottom of this big Ravine and and but he he manages to stop himself but he's not before he's all grazed up and his knees and his hands and he's a lot of everywhere and he's he's in quite a state and he looks way way down in the in the Gully there and he sees this little goat is walking down away down in the galley and he thought oh Lord now that I've lost a little goat and you know I know my hands are so sore I can't hardly you know I can't really Traverse down this face here I have to maybe wait here for a day or two but I can't stop that that little goat will will just disappear on me Lord but I've and I'm up in the middle of nowhere I can't just turn back now so he's saying Lord just help me I'm gonna try and go and carry on and try and catch that goat you know as we all would if we're in a situation we would when we get in a situation of strife we say Lord help me help me in the situation we we maybe don't see it coming maybe two hours before that he was looking at the view then two hours later he's little over his hands down the side of a mountain past the mission he was on to for the Lord had all sort of not turned out the way he planned the goats run away and he's doing something for the Lord and he wonders this is not going as well as what I planned I was hoping I'd just walk this goat up to this man and drop the goat off and he'd be happy and I'd feel good in myself I've done a good deal and I walk back and I tell the man there but it doesn't look like it's gonna go that way because he's struggling to Now Catch the scope and so but he just wants to keep on going so he carries on after this goat and he's going up mountains and down and he's now and then he sees the goat in the distance but it's hard for him to keep up because remember he's all cut and bruised and battered and you know and he's he's and this is going for days and days and he's trying to track this little goat because he thinks well I'm here now I might as well find this thing Lord help me find the goat and he's praying every day Lord help me find this little goat I'm doing this for you Lord help me to find it I think praying every day and walking and he's no it's hard going for him it's not an easy journey and he's beginning to wonder why am I in this predicament why am I he starts to just think you know this is not as this is not how I had planned out this whole exercise you ever been in that situation this is not quite what I thought it would be and but he's saying Lord I know you're a good god you'll deliver me you'll help me find the goat and I'll get it to this man because I'm doing a good thing so you'll help me and then maybe after days and days way off in the distance he hears a little and he said praise the Lord that's it I I can hear this little goat you know and he says this little man and he he hears it again man and he he knows okay that's the goat I'm gonna praise the Lord I've found this little goat you know like once I get the goat then I have to figure out how to get back but at least I'll have the goat you know and he's his his hands are healed up a lot more now and everything's starting to go but better and he's moving a bit faster now and he's he's been been a while now so he's getting used to walking in the place and he's getting a better footing on things now but faster his hands are callousing up a bit so we can actually move a bit quicker now and he's getting closer and closer to the scope he's hearing it say then it says meh and it stops he thinks like it's odd that it stopped but I know it was over here somewhere it was just it was just around the corner there so he goes around the corner there to to see where the little where the scope was and and there it was and it was sure enough it was his goat that he was looking for but it was dead a wild dog had come just because the goat was so much so a wild dog had come and just killed it he thought God I I I almost had it I was that close to getting this little goat then I come around the corner and it's now it's dead now now I found it but now what am I going to bring a dead goat to the man and he and this is hard for me saying Lord this was this is challenging for me I've been out here for weeks and then I you know I'm trying to do you a good thing Lord and I've finally you know I've been struggling I didn't just give up when the goat ran away I didn't just go well forget it and walk back I carried on I pressed on day after day and then I get to the finally it seems like Lord you're going to bless I get to this goat and just before I get it it's dead and he's he's just he's a bit I guess downcast because he doesn't understand the situation and maybe when I started the story you wouldn't think that's the way that it would unfold and he would have been the same he he should have been at the house by now he should have been back at his village by now getting patted on the back good man but instead the the goats did he's he's there he's been out for weeks and he and he he says well I guess Lord I just have to call it quits and I didn't leave the goat here and just head back and tell the man that I failed I just I tried my best it just didn't all work out and I just failed so so I began to walk back and he vaguely remembers where he went and he can see the sun setting in certain places in you roughly the direction but you know as he's walking back he's beginning to notice that you know when I started my feet were quite soft you know but I've been out here for weeks and weeks now he looked down at his feet and he thought my feet are quite hard now they're getting sort of calluses on them no nice any and I can you know they they're not as sore as what they used to be I can I can walk a bit easier and I can I can go for a bit longer he he looks at his hands you know he thinks the same about his hands you know he said when I first hooked onto those rocks my hands were quite soft and it was painful but now I can grab onto any I'll rock my hands are quite calloused up they're quite strong now quite you know I'm building my muscles up there I'm used to it and he would even even he would have trouble finding water and being out in such a desolate place he's in Atlanta that's uninhabited no one's there it's just a desolate Wasteland but somewhere amongst there he manages to find a little bit of water here and a bit of water there and he says even this desolate waste then I can still manage to just somehow pull through I can survive in this uninhabited uninhabited place and he thinks even running around the Rocks you know I'm my footing's a lot better now I've got better skill to run around the rocks and and to do these things but but then he thought you know but but that's a small constellation because I'm still going back to my Village failure as a failure I'm walking back as a failure I couldn't achieve this thing and I'm just just heading back there and you know when he was out there many times he would cry out to God and seems like God wouldn't answer him you know just say Lord Lord and Lord give me give me a just give me a big Oasis of water yeah and he would maybe think he'd expect to go around the corner and see a big pool a big that he could go for a swimming but his daddy would find maybe just a little a little puddle that he would just manage to just sustain him for the day he'd think well it wasn't the Oasis in the desert I was hoping for Lord just give me some nice food and maybe you would be expecting to come across a date tree that would be full of dates and he'd eat to his Hearts contempt he'd find maybe a few measly little berries and everything and that would just sustain him for the day seemed like Lord are you hearing My Cries I'm asking all these things and I just I guess I'm still alive but I'm just barely alive here this is the Christian walk sometimes yeah okay then he gets home and he walks back to the village and he's he's a bit downcast because he doesn't understand to him he think he looks he thinks you know that that whole exercise was seemingly just a waste of my a waste of time I went I've been gone for a month out there and I come back and it just seemed a I should have just stayed here I was better off just staying here Lord and I was trying to go and do a good deed and it just and then he goes and sees the man that he was going to do the delivery four and the man so excited he says I'm so happy to see you you know how how was my friend did you did you get in the goat and he had to say look no sorry I didn't get him to go I and he had to relay the story of how it all just failed for him he said look sorry but I just I failed I this happened the goat ran away I spent weeks trying to find it when I found it it was dead and then now I'm back and and that was my journey and the man said hey look look it's all right he's a real Christian he said look it's all right the Lord knows it's all right you did your best the Lord knows the Lord knows just just let's just keep praising the lord it's all okay we'll just hey he said oh by the way there's the you've been gone a while but you didn't know that the the uh today is actually the day of atonement they're doing the day of atonement sacrifice today down at the at the temple so you're just in time for that so so we can go and worship God and and you know and and bring our sacrifice and have our sins forgiven and and I guess it was of a small consolation to him you know because he's still battling in himself Lord that seemed like such a pointless thing but nevertheless I'm going to go to this and praise you anyway Lord and go to the temple and praise you so they went there in the on the day of atonement the priest would kill a bullock like a cow and then in the next it would kill a sheep then then the next thing that that they bring up are two goats and and that the the priesthood cast lots and one goat they would kill as a to be the sacrificial goat and then the other goat they would let go and that was called the scapegoat and so the priest takes the one goat and and kills the one goat and they're watching this happen and then then he then he then he brings the other goat out to out amongst the people and and he lays his hands on this goat and he says the the ceremony yesterday is going to lay all the sins of the people upon this goat said then they would lay hands on the goat and put all of the sins of the people upon this goat and then the priests would pray dear God the people have come here for for Mercy Lord and forgive for forgiveness for salvation Lord and to us forgiveness of their sins and we're gonna we're we're going to lay all of their sins upon this goat Lord and we just we lay them all upon the goat Lord that that that they could be taken away from the people and put upon this goat Lord so we we do this according to your word and it was Leviticus 16 according to the word you gave to Aaron we will put our sins upon this goat and he opens his eyes and he looks around and he says now now according to the word of God we need a fit man a fit man to take this goat way way way up way over to a desolate land to a land that's uninhabited we need someone that's fit and strong to take this goat way over because we need to show that that's how far away our sins have been taken from us so he says we need a foot man well all you mean line up so all the young men line up anybody's asked the first one he says hey what see if this man will take you see were you being son yeah the first man he says oh well I've been to the bottom of the planes here I've been see those planes over there see we're at the edge I've been to there the priest says no no no this I need someone's going to take a further than that God doesn't just forgive us that we can it's still a bit there this thing's got to be gone it's got to be further than that I need something that's going to take it further than that I need someone that's a bit stronger yeah keep going but I need someone stronger the next man lines up and he says Where Are You Gonna Where Have You Been son this man says we'll see see halfway up the hill there I've been up there and camped up there the priest says no we need someone's going to take it further than that the next man says I've been to the top of that Hill I can maybe I can take this goat right at the top of that pickup the up I'll make it up there he says I they that's still our land he said this goat needs to go to a land that's uninhabited and desolate that we don't dwell in it's got to be somewhere we don't dwell it's going to be far far far away because that's where our sins are going to be taking us that's where our deliverance is going to be where our healing it's got to be absolute absolute he then he comes across the next man which is the man in our story looks at them he's ragged here hanging down hasn't had a shave for a while all his beard but he but he looks leathery his hands look tough his feet looks look like they can handle and he said to the man Where Have You Been son he said you see the top of that you see that plane I've been along there he says okay I've been halfway up the hill you see the top of that Hill I've been there and I've been way way way over the back of that into a desolate place where I where I seem like I cry out to God and there was no God way in an uninhabited land I've been way over there and the man says son you're the man we need to take this goat way way way over there you're there we need a fit man we need we need to stand here and watch and watch you take this a long way away we need to see that we need to know that there's that this word is powerful that this Blood saves it doesn't it you've gotta we need a fit we need to fit man and woman we need a we need a fit man that's going to show these people how how much the blood of Christ works how far their sins are taken from them we need to show them there's total salvation we can't just have a half an effort we need someone that's been through some things that knows had faith in the word of God that can believe in a strong and keep going no matter what they believe we need to they these people need a total salvation it can't just be a half salvation that and someone faults us we need they they need to see someone with strong faith that can that can believe in the word of God all the way total deliverance we we've got to see this thing gone this thing's got to be gone into an uninhabited land this thing that's troubling you has got to be gone we need someone that can show that the power and the blood that these sins can be taken far away with us you can be delivered we need to show healing that it's it's absolute and we often wonder Lord why do we go through all these things in our life it's because God's trying our faith to make us strong to make us to make us strong so that we can be fit men and women of Faith so that our whole walk is actually servitude Jesus said I didn't come to to be ministered to but to minister our whole walk is servitude and you wonder Lord why do I go through all these things like a seemingly pointless exercise why it's just hard for me and I've just got a struggle and struggle he's making you strong he's trying your faith you wonder why you go through things he's trying your faith he's making you strong because you need at some point somebody's going to need you to believe Amen to say this is how powerful the blood of Christ is and stay there this is how God can deliver you and not falter he says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing that this that the trial of your faith workers patience it just gets tried and you just think Lord I'm just going day after day seemingly pointless but it's giving you patience which is patiently enduring after a while you just realize I can just endure I'm just enduring I'm stronger than what I was before in Revelation it says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that you may be rich we're not talking gold monetary we're talking trying your faith so come what may you believe you believe in the word of God you believe in the power of Christ your faith is being tried that's why Peter said the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so if you're going through a few hard times at the moment that's all right amen that's because God loves you and he knows you can do it and he's trying your faith and he's going to use that your life is to serve other people and he's making you strong we're like the Elite Force we're not little Canon fodder we're the Elite Force that Can Go the Distance with the word of God I want to close off with the scripture this was going to be my opening scripture but then you'd know what I was talking about you see and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the inequities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions and all their sins putting them upon the head of the goat and they shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness or a Foot Woman Into the Wilderness so be of good courage if you're going through things it's all all right it's all alright your fit men and women and God's got a plan for you amen praise the Lord I'm just going to hand it over to brother Ben do we need to sing a song or should we just um yeah let's have the music let's just stand let's just sing a song and then we'll get brother Ben up so that we just um who knows that
