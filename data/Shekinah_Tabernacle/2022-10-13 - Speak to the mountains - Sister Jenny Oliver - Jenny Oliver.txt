why would I worry when Giants come calling my name my God is so much bigger than troubles I face why would I hunger for power or riches or fame my God is so much better than all of these things [Music] I Won't Be Shaken I won't be moved my God is faithful his promise is true I speak to the mountain it's time to move cause my God is bigger better stronger greater than you my enemy scattered cause they know the battle is done my God is stronger the victories already won [Music] he died for my Ransom and Rose up on the third day [Music] greater greater than death hell and the grace [Music] my God is faith before his promise is true I speak to the man it's time to move [Music] my God is bigger better stronger greater than you oh yes I Won't Be Shaken [Music] I won't be moved my God is faithful his promises true I'll speak to the mountain it's time to move cause my God is bigger better stronger greater than you are Hallelujah [Applause]
