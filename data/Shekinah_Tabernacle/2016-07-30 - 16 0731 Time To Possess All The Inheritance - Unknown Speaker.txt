to have you all here Amen It's always wonderful to be among the redeemed Amen To let the pressure off Hallelujah Know God's in control of everything Hallelujah Amen If you'd like to turn with me to Luke chapter 12 we got a uh verse 29 So just a reminder that the prayer meeting once again is at Puk Bay this Wednesday So I like thank you all for coming out on Wednesday night Who was blessed Wednesday night Amen It was tremendous wasn't it So amen Praise the Lord So Luke Luke 12 and verse 29 we'll read down to verse 42 He says "Now and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what you shall drink neither be of doubtful mind For all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things But rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you Fear not little flock for it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." Amen Sell that ye have and give arms Provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in heavens that faileth not Where no thief approacheth neither moth corruptth For where your treasure is there will your heart be also Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knockth they may open unto him immediately Blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching Verily I say unto you that he shall g himself and shall make them sit down to meet and shall come forth and serve them And if he shall come in the second watch or in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants And this know that if the good man of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through But ye therefore ready also for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not Amen And the Lord said no sorry verse 41 And then Peter said unto him Lord speak thou this parable unto us or even to all And the Lord said Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his Lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season Blessed is that servant whom is lord when he cometh shall find him so doing Of a truth I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all that he hath But and if that servant may say in his heart "My lord delayeth his coming," and shall begin to beat the man's men's servants and maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken the the lord of that servant will cometh in a day when he lookth not for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him aunder and shall appoint his portion with the unbelievers And now let's go to Joshua chapter 1 I'm going to read down verse verse one to verse 9 I know it's very familiar piece of scripture to to all of us but just going to read this now After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun Moses minister saying Moses my servant is dead Now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I have unto Moses From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your coast There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life As I was with Moses so shall I be with thee I'll not fail thee nor forsake thee Be strong and of good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them Only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper wheresoever thou goest This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success Have I not commanded thee Be strong and be of good courage Be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou goest Amen May the Lord bless the reading of his word You may have your seats I want to I want to try and approach a bit of a subject You know we we have very uh we have many distractions in this world But we understand that you know with this parable where Jesus would speak of parables and we heard on Wednesday night that there's uh you know the parables they they are parables or just stories to some but it's been revealed to others what they mean And as Jesus would would speak in Matthew I believe it is chapter 13 he he would he he spoke the parables to the multitudes and then the then the disciples came to him and they begin to ask him what these things mean And he and he would begin to tell them how how um he answered the the disciples came and they said why do you speak thou unto them in parables Why do you speak to them just like well these are just stories and a s went to sew and the kingdom of God is like a fisherman who casts out a net and he uses all these examples and he said it's he and he answered and he says because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom but to them it's not given but whosoever hath to him shall be given and he uh shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him it shall be taken away even that he hath And so he began to speak this way because he wanted to really see uh what the people caught You know it's not a it's not like we have to clutch at straws and try and work out things but God in his great love and mercy he causes us to understand his word I mean he causes us to understand the day and hour that we're alive in You know he causes us to understand who we are in him You know we don't when when it's anchored down in your soul that God is not a God of history that he didn't just die on the cross and raised and now he's gone someplace for 2,000 years and we're just going on But God in every age in every generation God has been dealing And he's not a distant God someplace but as Paul would say he's not far from any one of us Amen But he is dealing in in in the lives of men and women and children because he's interested in in where we want to go Amen And he's interested in in having a real relationship with us You know he doesn't just want to give us you know we don't walk by blind faith I'll put it that way We're not just blindly following some distant God But God speaks to us and he shows us in his word the way we should go And he's there to guide us every step of the way if we look for him Amen If we're not looking for him we cannot be guided And so God you know our God is a present help in time of trouble And we understand that we live in a time of trouble But you know he's not you know Christianity this message is not just well we have a form of religion and here we are on a Sunday and you know we come and we want to hear something new and now I you know it's more than that But our God is a personal God Amen You brother Brandon he would always say "He is here." And God would come down and supernaturally prove that that that the that the God that the prophet was speaking about came upon the same platform and he revealed himself to show that God is interested in every little detail It's just like when Saul was you know Saul before Samuel anointed him but you know s Saul was sent to go find some lost I think donkeys or something And it was all recorded in the Bible And then when he when he came to Samuel because he couldn't find them So he says "We'll go to Samuel and we'll and we'll give him an offering and hopefully the Lord will reveal to him where our where our donkeys are." And then so but that was all orchestrated because Samuel was to anoint Saul king And it was and then so Samuel said to Saul "Don't worry about" without him even asking him he says "Don't worry about your donkeys They've been found." say well it's such a insignificant thing but it's just to show that God is interested in even common day every everyday things Amen And that's why when you when you go forward to show that the same God that was back there is present in this generation is that when brother Bram was up in the northern British Columbia and some of the Indian people they you know a guy lost his horses and then brother says you'll find them in a certain place and he went and found them in a certain place Amen Amen You say it's such a common everyday thing but it's recorded in the word because God is interested in simple everyday things Amen because he's not a distant god someplace but he's present Amen Amen So he as I said in the very beginning well in prayer this is not a we know this is not a textbook It's not a newspaper where you just you know man has tried to learn the Bible You cannot learn the Bible It takes God to reveal it to us Amen But you know and Jesus would even say that these things are hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent but revealed to babes Amen So it's not our it's not our ability that that somehow gives us any merit to walk with God or our intelligence or our upbringing or our nationality or what languages we know That's irrelevant God you know it's not that that helps us walk with God It's God revealing himself to us and then we just give ourselves to him and we walk with him Amen That's the great secret Amen Because Paul brother Brandon he spoke of the Apostle Paul quite a lot And he would speak in a sermon called the absolute Now I'm still talking about I'm still there in Luke and Joshua I just want to lay a bit of a background Now he would he would preach a sermon called the absolute And he would go through the lives of many people in the scripture and say when they truly met God they had an absolute because it wasn't something you know someone who has an experience can never be can never be talked out of it Amen An argument is not the same as an experience And especially if your experience our experience must match God's word So if you can take your experience and take it into the scripture you know that that's God speaking to you because he's the author of the Bible And he would go into he would go into Paul's life and he would begin to say that Paul you know he was raised as we know at the feet of Galia who was one of the greatest Bible teachers of the day He knew the Bible back to front you know those you know in those days you know a a someone like Paul could quote the scripture from the start of what we call the Old Testament to the end He knew he knew the law perfectly in his mind but it wasn't it wasn't until he was on a road to Damascus and God and and in his heart he wanted to destroy these Christians because he felt that they were the enemies of of of his religion But he would begin to find out when when that same God he was persecuting the same God he read about as a pillar of fire that led Moses you know led the children of Israel you know from Egypt into the promised land that same God now met him on the road to Damascus And a bright shining light the scripture says shone down upon him And he looked up at this light and this you know cuz a voice spoke out of it and said "Saul Saul why do you persecute me?" Yeah And he looked at this light He said "And who are you Lord?" And that and that word he used was supreme one It wasn't just like a lord like an earthly lord Who are you you supreme being This this this this light this who are you He says "I'm Jesus whom you persecute." And he and he had this experience And then after that he goes to Damascus He was baptized you know and his eyes came back open And he said he went down into the into the desert and spent three years It says in the book of Galatians he spent three years to see the one he met to see that Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the Old And the same God the same God that was back there that that he would read about in the and he would study about in the in the in the Bible schools was now a God of the present And he had met that same God And so this this gave him an absolute Amen You know what an absolute is you know it's like it's like the final say It's like an umpire in a game They have the final say in the game People can argue about it They can fuss about it They can write blogs about it They can have opinion pieces in the newspaper about it But at the end of the day that umpire's decision is the absolute in the game Amen And so now we must have an absolute That's right You understand Our absolute is is the revealed word of God You understand But but if you're just learned into it you can be argued out of it And many people unfortunately have because they haven't met the God of the message They haven't met the God of the Bible Amen And and the reason that the word has been revealed in this day is that we could meet him Amen And that he can come and dwell in us Now he says in the absolute in 62 now this is just coming into the story where where Paul is standing before king agrippa and he says and a grippa was a Jew as we know and when he was standing before these kings and things God had already told him he'd stand there so he had an absolute so he told exactly the heavenly vision so what happened on the road to Damascus he said I'm not I wasn't dishonorable to it I didn't misbehave myself but he held two and was not disobedient He carried it out to the minute for it was an absolute Amen Amen Maybe let's just now we won't read it but but so so he had that experience and it became his absolute You understand Amen And that held him through every trial through every storm through every question hardship wherever he went through he had an absolute that he could rest his soul upon For it was a so he carried out to the minute for it was an absolute Now Paul was a wise servant Amen He didn't remember when he was prophesying speaking of the rapture the catching away of the bride up into heaven When he was writing that to the Thessalonians he would have believed that would have been his group We which are alive and remain he said when he wrote it down He didn't say the future generations which alive and remain He said we which are alive and remain So he was under expectation I'm going to step from this world into the next world because of what Jesus has done for me So he was under expectation But even though it seemed that there was a delay in his coming he didn't lose he didn't lose track of what he was doing because he wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision He had an absolute by meeting God on the road to Damascus He had an absolute and his whole life was was now structured around that absolute Amen But he held and was not disobedient He carried out to the minute for it was an absolute and any Christ centered life Now here we go We're going from Paul now into your lap and any Christ centered life that's your absolute now since meeting him face to face on the road to Damascus Um that meant so much to Paul Now remember he was a scholar beforehand He was a mighty man in the scriptures but he didn't have any typost but the Sanhedrin that would back him up and a diploma from a great teacher He was a great man in his field but he was waving Only thing he had his absolute would only be as strong as his organization was Yep So his absolute was based on what other people were doing That's all the stronger it could be He was working faithful to that and was taking Christians and binding them and making havoc of them and even st consented the stoning of Steven I think later in his life the reason he went to Jerusalem Amen he said that you know when the prophet told him don't go up there you know Paul for the chains and the prison await you but he knew he had to go to Rome now and this is this is in an absolute and shreports are a different service but I just want you to get he speaks about a Christ-c centered life yeah and every man or woman that's had an experience with God who's had an experience with God has met the same pillar of fire Amen Upon the sacred grounds of your heart There is no theologian no devil no nothing Paul said there's nothing present nothing future death sickness sorrow can separate us from that love of God that's in Christ Jesus It's a typost You know something happened No matter how much science raises up and says this or that or the other you're tied You and God become one He's in you and you in him At that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father in me I and you and you and me in that day when you meet him Amen You are tied to him Paul had a Christ centered life It was a different life than he once had Remember he was religious He believed in the one true living God Amen He had the he had the true word Yeah And he thought that his life was because Christ means the anointed or the anointing Yeah So he would have believed that his his his life was Christ centered But it wasn't then But it became Christ centered You see he got a because it made him different to what he what he once had He once had an educational conception but now he's got a Christ centered life an absolute No matter how much a gripple would say "You've gone crazy Paul You've lost your mind You've studied too much." He said "I am not mad." And when he got onto a gripper to such a way till he said "Thou almost persuaded me to be a Christian." He said "I wish you were only besides these and I am but these bonds." It makes you do things when you get a Christ centered life like Paul had ordinarily that you wouldn't do See here was a man who he was a man in chains But because he met he met the Lord on the road to Damascus he was the freest man in the building Amen Amen It was really the king of gripper and those that were examining him They were the one in chains That's right Amen Because they were still in their sins They were still in unbelief So the so the one who was bound was actually free and the ones who thought they are free were actually bound And how and how incredible that is if you bring it into our day When people look at you and I they think well they don't do the things that we enjoy They must have to you know they're you know they're a bunch of legalistic bound people How could they be happy I think they're just deluded in themselves But in reality we're like Paul But we're not bound by natural chains We're bound by chains of love Amen Why are you a Christian Because I love him Amen That's it Amen Hallelujah Why do you live this kind of life Because I love him Because he first loved me It's a love relationship That's right Amen I don't live this way because I fear hell That's right I don't fear this way because I'm going to go you know because I might go into a great tribulation I I live this way because I love him And if I love him I want to serve him Amen Hallelujah Because he first loved me And so Paul was the freest man there Amen And you've got to understand they want to put the shackles of the world back on you because they think it's freedom but there's no peace You know someone who's free has peace Amen I'm talking about peace in here Someone who's free is has peace but they think you're bound Amen But they're the ones who are in chains Amen And that's why that's why we got to burn this place up and find We have the key to set them free Amen So out of love and godly concern and prayer we're going to find whosoever will let them come Amen Because I wouldn't trade this life for any kind of life Bill Gates can have his billions I I'm more happy with what I've got Amen Now we read there where your treasure is there your heart will be also Jesus speaking That's very interesting This word treasure it means it means a deposit This is in the Greek It means a deposit That is wealth Literally or figuratively a treasure So it's where your depositor is It's it's where you have put your investment Amen Have you put your investment down here or have you put your investment Remember you are the investment because you've pledged yourself Amen Amen I've pledged allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all I am And so it's up to you Have Have you have you pledged your deposit down here or have you pledge your given your treasure up there Amen Where have you given it Because a because a definition of a deposit is a sum payable is the first installment on the purchase of something or as a pledge for a contract Amen So where have you where your treasure is where your deposit is that's where your heart will be Amen So I'm not building earthly treasure Sure we got to naturally look after our families all these things but my treasures are not here Amen My treasures are in heaven Because where your treasure is that's where your heart will be also And now your heart this word heart the heart is figuratively the thoughts or feelings of the mind Yeah And so where your treasure is that's where your thoughts and feelings will be There's just this word this Greek word heart here Yeah So if your if your treasures are upon this world that's where your heart is towards Amen But if your treasures are in heaven that's your heart is heavenwood Amen So wherever your treasures are that's where your heart will be Now we read in Joshua I just want to tie these things a bit together We read in Joshua that Joshua was commanded to take Israel over the river Jordan place them in their inheritance that was their place in the promised land Now so during the time when Israel was being placed in their inheritance the commission came to do so But the commission really was to be courageous to keep the whole word of God I know Chad Lamb mentioned that in a blended religion ser I just want to expand upon that thought The commission was to be courageous and the courageousness was to keep the whole word Yeah So we are commanded So we have to be courageous You understand We have to be courageous to keep the whole word Not to say "Well we believe in the Lord." Not to say "Well we we're Christians." But we have to be courageous to keep the whole word Amen Amen Not just a part of it Not just the bits that make us feel happy but the whole word of God Amen You understand And we're living in a we're living in a day and hour where the bride of Jesus Christ is receiving their full inheritance Amen We're not you know the church has has has left Egypt We're no longer in the in the wilderness Brother Ram said that the Pentecostal fathers they came to Kadesh Bara and they said "We can't take the land." And that generation had to walk around in the wilderness until that generation died off And then he then he preached a sermon about turning northward Speaking of now it's time for us to turn northward and cross Jordan And he had another sermon speaking about as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee And he would say that you know he he was you know he he had a he had a vision of a of the Bible turning over to Joshua and a big finger coming down and told him to read those verses that we read because the church had come to a place now where now the bride was coming back into its full inheritance Amen Are you all following me So the church had left the world Amen They came out of the Catholicism under Luther They came out of Egypt They've been through the desert But now there was a change in season where the people now had to be placed in their land Yeah And our land is our pos is is this is our land It's not a piece of real estate It's our position in Christ Amen You understand And so that was and because you you must understand his life brother Brandham's life is a parable of even our walk Yeah Because so he is born in the world lost and undone He was redeemed and then God molded in him shaped him and he came down to a season where now was the time for the people to take their inheritance and and he was placed as an adopted son He received the sword in his hand Amen The word of God in his hand And then now what happened is the seals were open The word was open and it was preached to the people Pardon me And so the word that came down into his hand which is this the true interpretation of this now it was now preached to the people And then so what happens is um then what happens is he came to the end of his ministry and he said I must ride this trail again I'm sorry if I'm I hope this all comes together He said I'm so basically says I'm going to have another ministry again I'll ride this trail again But we understand that David in the Psalms when he cried out "My God my God why has thou forsaken me They've pierced my hands and my feet." It wasn't David that was the one that was forsaken by God His hands and feet were never pierced But it was David was anointed by the spirit of God and he was looking at Calvary But because it was God anointing him in such a way he was speaking in first person You understand So many times in the scripture as we heard Wednesday it'll be the person will be speaking in first person but it's a prophecy for a future event So when he said "Now I must ride this trail again," it was God not speaking about brother Baram having another ministry But that same anointing that was in him now was going to write a book of acts in a people after his ministry Amen So I say God was saying now I must repeat the same this same walk That's right Amen Because to ride a trail it means you've already you've already gone down gone down that trail And so the first time that the spirit of God took a man down that trail is he brought him to adoption He placed a sword in his hand and he placed him in his position in Christ Amen You following me And so God is going to ride that trail again is that he'll take a out of the world Amen Born in sin shaped in iniquity come to world speaking lies Amen and the power of the cross will be will become a reality in them and God will birth them into the kingdom and they will walk and they may not understand everything that they've gone through but just like he went through hardship to mold them and shape them and to teach him things not because God was being mean but God was teaching him things Amen Because God had a God had a had a had an intent in his mind And God because God's intent was I'm going to take this man from Kentucky I'm going to put in him everything that Adam lost as a display Amen So he had to go through those things because he was going to put creative power in that man where he could speak a storm out of existence and a tumor the size of a grapefruit was spoken out of existence The surgeon was going to cut it out of his wife and it disappeared At the same time he was praying Amen Squirrels were created Life was given back Amen Amen A woman a woman died in a service called Mary And and brother Bram said to her son Billy Paul "Go pray for her." And he said "No I'm scared." And he just cried out "Mary." And she came back to life Amen Amen That's like that that reminds you of Jesus walking to Lazarus's tomb Lazarus come forth Amen Because it wasn't it wasn't it was the God in the man You understand It's not the man It's the God in the man He says "I'm just your brother I'm as helpless as can be." But when he comes Amen It's the same thing with you and I we walk because his life was a parable You understand And we don't understand everything that we go through But you've got to have the end result in mind And that will give you closure for everything that you've walked through in life Amen What is the end result You're placed in your position in Christ Every enem is under your feet Amen You are built into the fullness of the stature of Christ Amen So what you see in Jesus now you see in a many membered body Amen With the same nature the same character That's his end result Amen because he wants to restore dominion back to man again over sickness over everything That's the end result And a people taking a rapture Remember that's the fullness of the inheritance is the body change Yep That's the end result So you've got to keep that in mind when you go through hardship because that is what God wants to do for you Amen And that to me will give you well me personally that gives me a lot of closure because I might not understand the the individual event Why did I why did this have to happen But it's because he had an end result in mind Amen Amen Remember God doesn't just force you through a pipe and spit you out the other side and now you're overcoming You've got to learn things Your heart's going to be molded and shaped in your thinking Man man's thinking's got to be changed You know I think it was brother Andy I think someone was having a go to Yo yo your brain washed He says yeah my brain needed a wash Amen My brain needed a shot It needed a real good wash Hallelujah Hallelujah Amen Thank God for his cleansing power Amen And so and so brother Bram came to a point now where now the church has to cross Jordan and be placed in its inheritance And but the challenge was now Be strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee Amen That's the challenge And the challenge was do not turn to the left side or to the right side Yeah Meditate upon the whole whole word And if you do this then you'll be successful So he's basically saying have a Christ centered life Amen have a oh that sounds very nice have a word centered life you understand well what does that mean everything you do in life is centered around this it's not by remember your will your human will and god's will are very different things amen Paul I think I read I read in the family altar where Paul said you know he spoke about when when when I would do good evil is present Yeah And what he and and brother Bram explained that he said your body says I'm tired I can't do it I'm weary I'm busy I'm stressed Yeah That's the evil being present because your body wants to do one thing but your soul wants to do the other thing And it depends what you yield yourself to That's the way you're going to go Amen We have to drag I have to drag this guy into a rapture Amen I got to make this guy This guy brother Bram said the greatest enemy I have is William Brandham not Satan not the hordes of hell He said this flesh Now we're not schizophrenic Amen But you got to understand this guy wants to be lazy He want He doesn't want to he don't he he doesn't want to pray He doesn't want to read the Bible He doesn't want to think on things of thoughts above because he's earthly man But your soul if you're remember if you have that typos you're absolute Amen This guy and if you yield then this guy will have preeminence But depend but but it's your power of choice is up to which way you want to go I'll just read this This is the infallible word of God in 56 The plan of God is finished The atonement's made The devil is defeated The only thing we have to do is look and live Amen That sounds pretty pretty particular He says "Brother sister tonight may God of heaven help you to look and live as we pray now and bow our heads." And then he prays our heavenly father as we come to the close now of this little mixed up message as a parable But let the let the people Lord take it home with them and ponder it in their heart and knowing that we can rest assure if we're built on the material out of the Bible that every plan of our salvation comes from thus sayeth the Lord and we know we're correct and then and then Father I pray that in vindication of this that I have said that there is none other no way under heaven not another name under heaven that man must be saved only through the name of the Lord Jesus whom was the expans expansion between heavens and earth as he was expanded up there He is the mighty tower The name of the Lord is the mighty tower The righteous run into it and are safe We thank thee Father that that we have found this And we pray that you're blessed tonight Amen So the plan is it's finished The devil's defeated The plan of God is finished You just got to look and live So I said it's it's it's up to your choosing Am I going to Am I going to listen to him and his devices Remember he has a lot of shiny things Satan's got a lot of shiny things Amen God doesn't have shiny things like he does But so don't be distracted by shiny things You know one of the one of the problems if it can be called a problem in this society is we have too much We have too much We eat better than you know we we have better food than you'd say like the emperors of Rome or some great big emperor from way back when We eat way better than those kind of people What do you feel like today honey I feel like Turkish or let's make sushi or I feel like uh how about some Mexican or let's you know what do you want Um no let's go make a curry And then you go get the proper spices You get all the real authentic stuff and then you can make it They can never do those things Amen They can never just just just have a big banquet And what are we doing Well we're having we're having venison on a charcoal bri and we have this and we have you know they never ate that well Amen Amen They never ate that well But we have too much really Amen Are we better off Are we better off with all these things or we better off just with the Lord Amen Then that's and that's why we have to be careful you know because this world is so soft soaked easy Yeah But God wants us rugged Amen Amen So we can you know Paul even told Timothy endure hardness as a soldier You know so he says you got to you know you need a bit of ruggedness about you And that's the challenge Joshua said "Keep all the word that you may observe to do all the law." Yeah And that's why they had to be courageous And remember that same anointing that was upon Joshua to place the people in the land is the same anointing that is here present because remember the church the church went back into Babylon came out you know because it was buried underneath Catholicism and has come out now and in this very day and hour of the people being placed in the land Yeah This is the hour where we receive our full inheritance This is the hour for it Yeah And so now that same anointing that was back there is now present here Amen So if that is the case then the same commission that Joshua received really is passed on to you and I And you can even read about that when Joshua at the end of the book of Joshua when Joshua's about to die his last commandment to Israel is virtually the same that God gave him in in in chapter one Don't turn a left or right from the word Meditate upon the whole word of God you'll be successful because I still had more land to possess Yeah So we should never be satisfied with the walk we have You understand We should be We should be thankful we're in the land Who's in the land Who's in Christ Amen We should be thankful we're in the land but there's more land to possess There's more enemies to be driven out Amen There's more of this first human nature to be defeated Amen And we should never just plateau and say "Well now we know it all." Amen Because there's more to the word There's more to the word than just "Well now I understand just the core doctrine." Because a lot of the time we can be you know let's just go to Romans I believe it was Romans chapter 6 The time No Yes Where is it I believe it's Hebrews chapter 6 Sorry I just want you to get a hunger Brother Bram said "Pray for revelation above all things." above all things We're not here just to possess part of the inheritance Yeah we should remember the kingdom is taken The violent take the kingdom by force And that doesn't mean physically take a sword and invade a place but the violent take the kingdom of heaven by force Yeah So it's those who who remember it's just like the unjust judge the parable of the unjust judge There's a widow woman and she's been wronged and there's an unjust judge and he doesn't help her straight away So she just keeps after him all the time When are you going to avenge me When are you going to make this right And then and then the just says "Well I better do something in case she wearies me." Amen And God said you know and our God is not an unjust judge but he's giving a principle you know press in If you don't get an answer the first time press in And if you get a no say thank you Amen If you get a yes say thank you Amen Amen But don't just you know press in Amen Press in Take God You know we shouldn't just sit back Remember this world is easy I could go on the doll I could get given a house I could basically wouldn't have to leave my house I could just order my groceries you know I could order them online They can come to me you know I could that that could be my life because everything's poured out given to me But that's not that's not how it really should be Yeah Amen So don't let don't let the culture of the age the spirit of the age affect your spiritual walk Are you following me Because if we do that then we will begin to just get lazy Amen I want to take a rapture Amen Yeah And it doesn't mean you don't work your way into the rapture You understand But Paul said that I want to apprehend that which has apprehended me He's you know he speaks about So so he's saying now so what apprehended him The Lord apprehended him Lord who are you on the road to Damascus I'm Jesus whom persecuted So the Lord got a hold of him and he says many times Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ because he became a love prisoner Amen So he and if you're a prisoner in shackles you're apprehended But he said now I want to apprehend that which is apprehended me And here was a man here was a man who wrote most of the New Testament He received abundance of revelation but it didn't satisfy him He wanted more He wasn't trying to earn us He knew he was sealed into the kingdom He says "A crown of life awaits me over there." So he wasn't worried about where he's going but he wanted more of what God had for him Yeah And it should be the same thing with us There should something There should be something in us that we want to apprehend that which has apprehended us Amen Who loves to spend time with their spouse Amen Why is that Because you love them Amen Yeah You want to spend time with them You want to try and get to know them better Amen Absolutely And if that is just an earthly marriage how much more now you and the Lord Amen So it says here in Hebrews chapter 6 verse one therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go unto perfection not laying in the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards God of the doctrine of baptisms and of the laying on of hands which is praying for the sick and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment For this we will do if God permit So Paul is telling the Hebrews he says let us leave the principles of doctrine of Christ That doesn't mean throw them away He that doesn't what he mean by leave He says but let us go on from there Yeah So he's laid the foundation He's laid the principles of the doctrine Amen Yeah which is you know repentance faith towards God baptism healing laying on of hands resurrection of the dead all the all the fundamentals of the faith He says go beyond those things He doesn't say throw them away We need those things If you're not built on the foundation of faith you're you're you're only built on mental revelation Amen So he says you we have to so we need those principles but we got to go beyond those things Yeah It's just like Israel they crossed Jordan They took Jericho but let's go beyond Amen Let's take all the land Let's just not be satisfied with what we have Let's go be you know let's go beyond these things And Paul was calling the Hebrews to a greater walk with God And we are living in the same time because the Hebrews and I think I've said this before but the book of Hebrews now these these Hebrews who know Jewish believers they've come out of they've come out of Judaism I could say they've come out of denominationalism Yeah And now they've come into this new faith and Paul is constantly telling them let us go beyond the camp You know Jesus's sacrifice is greater than that of the blood of bulls and goats Him being the high priest unto like like Melisedc is greater than the Levitical priesthood Amen He's always contrasting what we have now is greater than what we had before He's always making this contrast It's because what was happening is these Hebrews that had come out of Judaism what was happening in that day is the blindness was coming upon Israel because the Gentiles were coming in Yep And you got to be careful that you don't get caught up in that blindness because the opposite is happening in this day The Gentiles are being blinded that because the Jews are going to come in very soon You understand But because there's a blindness coming upon the Gentiles you don't want to get caught up in that blindness What is part of that blindness I have it all Everything's fine Amen There should be a yearning I know we're busy We got children all those things But there should be something in here I want more of you Lord I want more of you Amen Amen Amen So that's why he always contrasted what we have now is greater than what you had under the blood of bulls and goats And then now history has repeated itself because it's very important for us that we must recognize what we have now is better than what we had than what we came out of Amen Amen Because we don't just have a partial atonement of of the word mixed with creed Amen And just learning some Bible Bible studies and these things but we now have a living God Amen That the that the pure word of God is greater than that mixed with man's ideas Amen Amen That now the power of the cross has come into its full manifestation Amen Because now the ability has been released upon the earth for people to live above sin like never before Hallelujah Amen Remember the remember the Ephesian church they aimed at becoming what we are called to become the fullness of the stature of Christ but they relaxed because of Ephesus means aimed at but relaxed So they aimed at the high calling but they relaxed Amen So they came they crossed Jordan but they didn't take the fullness of the land Yeah But now we're called we have come back History has repeated itself now where there's a people upon the earth that have crossed Jordan Amen They've taken part of the land Amen But there but now instead of shrinking back and saying "We cannot take it." There's a people upon the earth saying "Now I'm going to take it." Amen Amen Everything that God everything that God has allotted to the church has been released to us And that's why it's important when you see the opening of the seals now is because part inheritance as we heard on Wednesday was sealed up and John was told in Revelation chapter 10 seal up those things says I was about to write it So he would have written down what it was and he would have sent it to the seven churches because he was an obedient scribe but God told him seal up those things until the time of the end Yeah Now I'm in Daniel chapter 12 Daniel saw that sealed book as well And he he's asking God "When are these things going to happen?" He said "Seal up those things until the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase." Running to and fro in the Bible languages travel When in the like like this past century or past 50 years can you you say "Where do you want breakfast?" Oh let's go to let's go to Nusa for breakfast Let's go to Queensland for breakfast Where do you want dinner Let's go to Sydney Oh let's go around the world You know and people complain it takes me 48 hours to travel around the world Used to take months Amen You know this this day that that scripture is fulfilled When has knowledge increased In a short space of time there's a horse and buggy to a man up in space It wasn't that long And our cell phones our computers have more computing power than I think the the lander that put the Americans on the moon And it's just this little thing No it's just gone exponential Look up He said when these things happen he said that's the time when the when the inheritance is going to be released Amen Amen And it's been open Amen Yeah The full inheritance of the people of God has been open And so that's why there's such a contrast What we have now is greater It is more It's not taking away from what God did in past ages It's just greater than what they had And what the light that they lived in God will you know God redeem people under that light Yeah Because they're only held accountable for what they had in future ages But this is another age Amen Amen This is another time And so God has called us now because the word because the word has been opened Now is the time when the when the full inheritance everything Adam lost now has been given back to the church Okay And so that's why it's important to recognize what we have is greater than even Pentecost What we have is even greater than the first church age because the first church age remember aimed at but relaxed Amen But now we're called to aim at but become Amen Amen Amen Because this age that we live in is a lot harder age than than that time Yeah But now we have a power now God has released an anointing upon the church for us to overcome all things and to possess all things But now the commission given to us now is that we would be very courageous to keep the whole word Amen That's why it's important to to dig into these things Amen To to to delve into these things and really see what he said It's important because that's the inheritance now and it's now being distributed to you Now let's go to and also as I said now well so where your heart is where your treasure is that's where your heart will be and it's come down to a point now that man is reflecting either two worlds you're reflecting heaven you're either reflecting heaven or hell Amen And so the believer but it's where your it's where your treasure is I say "Is it on upon this earth or is it from heaven?" And so now because what's happened is God through the ages has been building up a people in his very image Yeah Are you with me And so now there's a people upon the earth that have the character of God in them The very life that was in Christ is now in you Amen And so now the believer that's been born again is reflecting heaven Amen When you walk down the street when you go to your job whatever you're doing you create an atmosphere around you Amen And some people you know some people unfortunately you go around them and you don't want to be around them because they have an atmosphere And there's some people you love to be around because they have a certain kind of atmosphere Yeah Because we're all atmosphere creators But it's up to you now It's where your treasure is That's the kind of atmosphere you'll create You with me Now I'm not going to be too much longer I just want to read one more thing now It says let's go to second Peter chapter 1 Now second Peter chapter 1 and verse one Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Pardon me Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust I was going to stop there for a little bit So he's so so Peter is speaking to a people and he's really speaking to us because we are called now that we would be partakers of the divine nature So we would be partakers of God's own nature Yeah Because remember I say this the people in ISIS embody their religion They come under the same anointing that's released through their preaching of hate and they go blow themselves up to all kinds of atrocities because they embody that religion Yeah And everyone who's ever sold themselves to what kind of religion They embody that religion And what it is is a counterfeit of the real You following me So now if if God is if Jesus Christ is the Lord he is the real true and living God then his true followers will embody him Yep That his spirit will now come and dwell in them and they will embody this Yep It's just like ISIS They they send out their words and people come under that anointing and they now live out the words in their books And that's why they murder people and do all kinds of things And so it'll be the same now for a for the true and living God that when God releases his word there'll be a people that come under the anointing and they'll embody those words And that is all really summed up in the character of the people Amen It's not in how much you know or what you think you know It's your character Has it been molded and shaped into his character That is that is that is the great thing because it's when your character is molded and shaped into his that's when you know you're possessing the land Amen Amen As you become more like him Now he says this now I just he says now having escaped the corruption that's in the world through lust and brother Bam says lust for money lust for big things lust for popularity these things are dead to the believer Amen If if if you have no desire you if you have no desire for those things you know those things should be dead Remember where your treasure is that's where your heart is Yeah We don't care a tent or a cottage Why should I care Live or die sink or drown This is the thing that I'm interested in The kingdom of God Whether I maintain my home whether I maintain my family whether I maintain whatever whatever it is let me remain let me remain Christ the hope of glory Build me up oh Lord into this Let Christ be my head Let working let working through me on my foundation of my faith that's in him Let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness work in me oh Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sink or drown denomination no denomination friend or no friend Let that work in me Let Christ's virtue his knowledge his flowing out that I might be able to teach those for God has set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists all for the perfecting and the bringing all these virtues into it to that perfection of the coming uh of the son of God Each one of these stones are material off of that one This is the material of this Each one of these virtues belonging to him and they're pouring out of him down through them And he says amen So he's saying now those virtues he's saying so the seven virtues which we will read there in second Peter he says those things flow from Christ through the ministry into the people Remember because the people embody the words that come out of whatever is being preached Amen I got to find second Peter again Okay So now and besides this giving all diligence Okay So don't be slack about it Give all diligence Remember if you want a good home be strong in the Lord If you want a good marriage be strong in the Lord If you want a good relationship with your kids be strong in the Lord And then if that is the center now everything else will live out of that She'll have a better relationship with your wife or your or your husband because you're strong in the Lord You'll be able to get alongside your kids and play with them and spend better time with them because you're strong in the Lord Because remember our kids are our disciples Yeah But a disciple is made by an example set in front of them Why do people turn to the world and they want to become the next Beyonce or the whatever next big big rock star or whatever it is because that life is projected in front of them and they behold it They say I want to be their disciple Basically without saying disciple they say I want to be that I want to be the next Kardashian or whatever kind of train wreck of a life Yeah because they see that and they want it because it's lived in front of them So if you want to make your kids disciples of the Lord remember Paul said "Follow me as I follow Christ." Yeah So because he wasn't a living example of this So if you want to make them disciples of the Lord they need to see a life lived in front of them that they want Yeah That's why so that's why I said if you're strong with if you want a better relationship with your kids be strong in the Lord Because they will see that now being lived out of you Even if they can't put their finger upon it they will actually say "I want what my parents have They may be a bunch of squares but I want what they have." Amen Because you're salty You understand Because that's how you make disciples It's anam a life lived will make a disciple Amen So now he says "Giving all diligence add to your faith virtue." Now your faith is your revealed faith in God It's not your mental faith Go listen to the statue of the perfect man sermon Whatever you do go study it And to your faith virtue Now virtue is strength Remember Jesus the Yeah The woman touched the hem of his garment He says "Virtues come out of me." So now you have strength to help others Okay And knowledge and and to virtue knowledge Now that knowledge is heavenly knowledge Knowledge of the word Yeah Godly knowledge And then temperance And to your temperance is patience And to patience godliness And to godliness brotherly kindness And to brotherly kindness charity And that is divine love Okay Now brother Bram when he preaches that sermon the statue of the perfect man and he actually calls the sermon building the living tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place the perfect man That's the real title that he calls it Okay So building the living tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place the perfect man He says that each individual is built to be built up into this And he and he ties in he ties in the virtues now with with the seven church ages So now when the when the messengers came and they released the word to the age now they were releasing that virtue to the age Yeah Because because the bride because the bride started off remember the bride is a many many membered body It started off in the beginning and now we're the final parts of that body coming in all all around the world the believers are Amen Yeah But then also individually so so collectively we are the statue of the perfect man is the bride But individually we are made in that image as well Okay Does that is that make sense Yeah And so now he so he says that with each of these messengers these virtues are released He says as and see how these virtues these building materials typed in with the church ages I mean church messengers with the church ages So he says that they're typed in there So he's saying that the the virtues were released when the messenger gave the light Yeah For for each age But remember the final age is to gather every all the truth through the first six and to release it to the people And not only that now but to bring what has been sealed in the word to to reveal it So now we have the fullness of the word now is is present upon the earth Now what does that mean It means now that we have what we need to be grown into the fullness of the statue of Christ Okay that's what we have So now living in an age now this is where I say press in and take your inheritance because now we're living in an age where what you see saw in Jesus now that same character and nature and what he did is now you're made into that same image It doesn't mean putting on a robe and walking along the shore of Galilee but that same character and nature will be in you Yeah And if you have so and if that is in you now that's why I said before if you have your character is molded and shaped more like him then to me that shows that you are taking your inheritance because remember a revelation a revelation if you have a revelation it will produce Christ's character in you Yeah remember Moses Moses and the Pharisees and I and I'll try and wind up with this We still got a bit to go but I'll maybe pick up next time Moses and the Pharisees they had the first first five books of the Bible They had the same Bible One learned it The scribes and Pharisees they learned it Moses it was a revelation on Mount Si The word came to him Moses became the meakest man in all the earth The scribes and Pharisees were proud arrogant men What was the difference One was learned the other was a revelation And he became the meakest man in all the earth because that was a characteristic of Christ being lived out in it Amen That was Christ That was Christ's character going into Moses But remember before that he was raised in Pharaoh's house He was a general in the army The royalty in Egypt in those days they were gods And you wouldn't see a man So so now here comes our god of war embodied in our general Prince Moses You know if he's embodying the God of war he's not going to be a little meek little fellow He's going to be confident He says "We're going to smite these Ethiopians We're going to deal with them and have such a persona around him." And well how did he become the meakest man in all the earth Because he met the Lord And the proof that he met the Lord is because his character was changed to become the meakest man Yeah That's what the word produced in him Amen And that is what the word will produce in you Amen And whatever measure God wants to pour it in because we all have different He's not going to make our personalities all the same Remember he's a he's a he's a like you know just like the apostles Peter was boisterous and always answered first and he was the only one who got out of the boat and did all these things Paul was more scholarly You know he's a different kind of fellow You know some of them were more prayer warriors others were fire brands but they're all part of the church because God made them all differently because God uses God God makes people that way for us to compliment one another Yeah But they all had the same kind of character because they knew the Lord and it produced that character in them And that is what I just read this This is a statue of the perfect man Now Peter he says he says uh first seven things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness I mean sorry brotherly love and brotherly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you get these virtues sealed in you Then God lives in a tabernacle called the uh called the building the living tabernacle the living God's dwelling place When a man possesses these kinds of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon them No matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God's got You might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real foundation of faith But when these virtues grow in as you added that to that then you're a living monument You're a living moving idol But you know the heathens they prostrate themselves before an idol and an imaginary god And in an imaginary way they believe that that imaginary god speaks back to them That's heathenism That's Romanism They bow before all kinds of saints and everything else They have St Cecilia house god so many different things like that They bow to that and actually believe that that in an imaginary way Now what a type of it is of the true living God When we not in an imaginary way but prostrate ourselves before a living God a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming by the living God makes a living man a living image the statue of God But what's he doing The same things that Jesus did Walking the same way he walked Doing the same things he did because he's not an imaginary thing There's a reality that proves it Amen And that's that's where we are friends Amen We're not Remember the devil will tell you it's not for you it's for another time That's a lie Everything that God has released or will release to the church is here Amen But it's our it's our time to possess all things Amen That the that Jesus dying on the cross what is the purpose that he died to to redeem us back to God That God would take this fallen nature Remember your first don't let your first birth dictate your walk with God Your first nature don't let it dictate how you walk with God Well I'm always this way and my granddad was this way and my uncle was this way and it's just in my is a strain in my family That's only with the first birth Amen Amen But the second birth the the life of God in you is more powerful than this this guy Amen But what you but what you yield yourself to that is what will be lived out And that's why God comes he puts his finger He allows circumstance to come into your life cuz he puts a finger Just say if you got a stubborn streak in your family or unforgiving streak or whatever it may you know temper whatever it is he allows things to happen because he wants to put a finger on that thing because he wants you to overcome that thing Amen Amen That's what he wants to do because he wants you to be victorious over it He does He's not condemning Remember when the when the enemy trips you up God didn't let that happen that that he you would be condemned by it God allows or lets the enemy trip you up because he wants you to get up and you to overcome that thing That's right As I've said a while ago it's just like when you're growing a garden and during the winter time there can be all kinds of weeds in that soil You don't know the weeds are there That's right You've planted your whatever you've planted And then when the temperature is right and the atmosphere is right and the and the you know there's fertilizer and you water it things begin to grow And it's only when the weed comes out then you can pull the weed out Amen And it's the same thing Now we come you know the world everyone's pretty much dormant but then now the spirit of God comes through his word and the light begins to shine and water comes out upon the soil and things come out of people that they really had no idea was in there That's right What's happening It's a weed But then it it comes out not that you'd see you're failing but it's that God wants to take it out of you Remember he knows what's in the heart of every man Amen So whenever things happen you say "Lord," and you and you completely hate yourself for it You know don't sit there condemned about it But let you remember if you It's just like this Bible if you wanted to take this Bible off me you you really need to come and ask say can I take that off you And then it's my choice if I'm going to give it to you or not If this is I'll use another book If this is a lie of the devil and I've always carried it around and and I carry it around so much that I think well it's just part of me now because it's just part of what I have Just like people's cell phones many times these days right as part of them But then if the Lord wants to take it from me first he's got to actually cause me to recognize hey this is actually this is a lie of the devil This is a bad thing But then it's up to me now Am I going to give it to him or not Amen Amen If I say no this is part of me then he's remember he's a gentleman He doesn't force anything upon you You have to be willing to give it to him Yeah And so if he if you say "No I'm going to keep on this thing." Well it's just going to sit there But why does he cause your attention to come to it because he wants to take it from you Why do why do things happen in life and that you know things come out of you that you thought were not even there or you know because you had to realize you're carrying things Amen Just like possessing the land There's squatters in the land that had to be driven out Doesn't mean the land's bad It's the squatters that are bad Amen Just like a believer doesn't mean the believer's bad There squatters there There's a first nature that has to be taken under dominion Amen Let's have some musicians come Sorry I need to I need to finish But you see that's why bad why do bad things remember all Romans 8:28 Put that on your fridge All things work together for good for those that love God and are called according to his purpose Amen Amen They work together for the good Well I don't understand why that happened It worked for my good All things That doesn't mean some things all Amen And what is the reason that that bad things happen Cuz he wants to he wants to he has an end goal in mind Remember I said in the beginning mold and shape us into his very image Amen Praise the Lord Let's just go to um let's just go to number seven I'm amazed that you love me We're called to possess all things for if you'd like to stand with me please If there's a deep remember if there's a longing in your heart there's more of God to have And if there's not a longing here you pray say "Lord give me a desire." Amen Because please do not be satisfied with what we have Do not be satisfied in your walk I'm not saying you got to get saved all over again I'm not talking about But there's more of God to have Amen Oh but people will think I'm overboard They think you're overboard anyway Just just forget about what anyone else thinks It doesn't matter Who cares You don't try and be a stumbling block How do you be a stumbling block Live in hypocrisy That's a stumbling block At least at least if people see real Christianity they might not like what you have but if trouble arises and they have a need they'll come to you cuz they know hey these people are real true blue Amen So that's you know you can't really be a stumbling block by just being what you are Amen Can we have the Do we have words Amen Let's just sing this No one knew Let's go First verse Sorry Alone I was feeling and the emptiness I tried so hard to hide Though I laughed and said my life was fine without you I was covering up the secret tears I cried Then one day someone told me of your mercy On a hill you showed on a hill called Calvary There you died and purchase my redemption When you broke sin's power and set my spirit free I'm amazed that you love [Music] me How you care through your preious blood I found pardon And my sins are washed They're all washed away All my sins are washed away Yes it's true There have been days when I failed you Lord You know the many times I've gone astray But I've learned that stronger than my weakness And your ear is open every time I pray No one else has ever cared for me like you Lord other friends could never be as close to me I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow Knowing you are everything I'll ever need I'm amazed that you love me I'm [Applause] amazed how you care Through your preious blood I found pardon And my sins are washed They're all washed away All my sins are washed [Applause] away I believe that you love me I [Applause] believe that you care Oh through your preious blood I found pardon And my sins are washed They're all washed away All my sins are washed away I'm amazed I'm amazed that you love me I'm amazed Lord how you care Oh through your preious blood I found pardon And my sins are washed They're all washed away All my sins are washed away Hallelujah Amen Who's amazed Hallelujah Amen And let's go to number 214 Joel's Army Can we do that one

When the brothers are praying in front of the the movement in the church when somebody's standing up in front and praying we'd like no movement When the spirit of the Lord comes down and he takes control in this place our parents are busy maybe and our children need to respect this They need to be steady and steadfast and being patient waiting for their parents not walking around When our when our brothers are are in praise and worship and and and you can feel the spirit here our children need to be just held close by them The only time our children are to be gone to the back or to be dismissed is when the pastor or the last person prayed and said you are dismissed in the name of the Lord Then our children should go out of the church But otherwise our children should be held close to us If they gone out to the back to the toilet if they can use the toilet by themselves that's fine But if they need assistance in the toilet parents please go with him I just want to say this from my heart because we are we are getting closer and closer Each day we come here each time we fellowship together We can see that closeness It's time to go home brothers and sisters Amen We need to be in one accord we need to be united We need to be standing together because all the people out in the front here they're doing a special job And if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have that presence or
