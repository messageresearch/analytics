[39:56] Jesus Christ and we pray amen and amen
[39:59] amen
[40:01] welcome to church
[40:04] amen it is Sunday uh just uh just a
[40:07] couple of announcements before we really
[40:09] jump into the service
[40:11] we had brother jono's birthday just a
[40:15] couple of days ago and then we had
[40:17] brother Bean's birthday yesterday and
[40:21] today is brother Malcolm's birthday so a
[40:23] lot of good people's birthday on this
[40:25] little short time of space
[40:27] so you know we are very fortunate to
[40:29] have a pastor like we have and to have
[40:31] people like jono in our in our service
[40:33] you know in our church young people
[40:35] that's just just loves the Lord you know
[40:38] it stands for for the testimony of our
[40:40] Lord Jesus Christ and then our pastor
[40:42] gets to go and bless brother Malcolm at
[40:44] East church and preachers at East Church
[40:46] which just loves the Lord just as much
[40:48] as we do so you know it's a it's a body
[40:50] work it's not it's an individual walk
[40:53] but it's a body work and if we always
[40:55] can keep our eye on each one next to us
[40:57] and just make sure we got each other you
[40:59] know and just keep each other nice and
[41:01] tight and before the Lord everything
[41:03] will be all right because the Lord will
[41:05] lead us but the body will follow amen
[41:07] it's like if you look at a head Jesus
[41:09] Christ is the head we're just a body and
[41:12] the head says to the body what to do we
[41:14] just say Lord please use me and if he
[41:17] doesn't use you it's all right he will
[41:20] still use you amen so don't worry if you
[41:22] haven't run in a while you won't pull a
[41:24] hamstring okay our Lord is very fit
[41:26] he'll make it happen up I will know it's
[41:28] not nice when you pull a muscle but when
[41:30] the Lord says go he knows he's anointing
[41:33] you for that time amen

[42:04] take a book myself so these like little
[42:07] Heroes of the Bible and little stories

[42:11] the kids if they if they can't really

[42:17] these little books but we're going to

[42:47] exercises and and Lord they might not be
[42:50] able to concentrate like the the parents

[42:56] keep them just in your presence father
[42:58] while they do these exercises and may
[43:00] there be many more of these Lord May

[44:49] because when we approach the bride of
[44:51] Christ you're not talking to any people
[44:53] you're talking to the bride and and it
[44:56] makes you a very special people because
[44:58] it doesn't put you out of out of anybody
[45:01] else it just puts you on a special class
[45:03] because there's only one Mrs Chantels in
[45:06] this place and that's my wife and I
[45:08] chosen I wanted to marry her so when
[45:10] when we talk we talk a different
[45:12] language we read between lines we we
[45:15] have a different relationship a husband
[45:18] and a wife then then me and another
[45:19] sister would have a church with me and a
[45:21] brother would have or me and my own
[45:23] brother would have there's something
[45:24] special you're one so when God talks to
[45:27] his bride the one that he loves the
[45:29] apple of his eye you need to read
[45:31] between the lines
[45:32] so so I'm just asking today as you come
[45:35] to the service read between the lines
[45:37] talk to the Lord take man out of the way
[45:40] make it a personal discussion between
[45:42] you and the law today and I promise you
[45:44] you will leave you blessed so we'll
[45:46] start there at verse 3.
[45:49] he says there
[45:51] according as his divine power so this is
[45:53] the the faithful in the knowledge of
[45:55] Christ according as his divine power
[45:58] hath given unto us all things that
[46:01] pertaineth unto life and godliness
[46:03] through the knowledge of him that called
[46:06] us into glory and virtue
[46:09] as I remember the Lord's doing the work
[46:10] here whereby we are given unto us a
[46:14] great and precious promises that these
[46:17] might yebo that by these you might be
[46:19] partakers of his divine nature amen now
[46:22] I want to say his divine nature so that
[46:25] means God has a nature that is out there
[46:28] that is that is Holy and pure and we are
[46:31] partakers of that amen
[46:33] and he gives us that ability not us
[46:36] having escaped the corruption that is in
[46:39] the world through lust amen now I would
[46:42] stop there and start preaching on that
[46:44] but we'll get back to that and besides
[46:46] this giving all diligence add to your
[46:48] faith virtue and to your virtue
[46:51] knowledge and to your knowledge
[46:53] Temperance and to your Temperance
[46:54] patience and to your patience godliness
[46:56] and to your godliness brotherly kindness
[46:58] into your brotherly kindness charity for
[47:01] these things be in you and abound that
[47:04] will make you that ye shall neither be
[47:06] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[47:08] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:11] but he that lack of these things is
[47:13] blind and cannot see afar and hath
[47:16] forgotten that he was purged from his
[47:18] old sins and we'll just leave the Lord
[47:21] bless the reading of his word Lisa's bow
[47:23] our heads One More Time Lord Jesus as
[47:25] we're gonna open this word and we
[47:27] started reading we just need you to step
[47:29] forth now Lord and we ask that you will
[47:31] just take the rest of the service for
[47:33] the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[47:36] amen you may be seated
[47:38] amen now my thought and and maybe we can
[47:43] just put this one
[47:45] sort of this is my thought for today
[47:50] the noble King
[47:55] so what we read here in in First Peter
[47:58] and when we look there and it's very
[48:00] small so don't worry about it I'm just
[48:01] going to use this as my opening slide it
[48:04] says the way by giving to you as
[48:06] exceeding great and precious promises
[48:08] that by these you may be partakers of
[48:10] the divine nature having escaped the
[48:12] corruption of this world through lust
[48:17] amen
[48:18] so we know there was two trees in the
[48:20] Garden of Eden one was the Garden of the
[48:23] tree of life and then the tree of
[48:25] knowledge of Good and Evil we know these
[48:27] two trees are there
[48:29] now I kind of pictured the second tree
[48:32] if you can see it sitting in an iPhone
[48:33] because the iPhone represents the Apple
[48:35] That Was Bitten as well I find it kind
[48:38] of funny because and and and and not as
[48:41] a coincidence because
[48:43] when we look at the tree of knowledge
[48:45] there is good and evil in there
[48:48] but it's which one we look to most of
[48:50] the time
[48:51] so we all know that when we look at at
[48:54] your state where you are currently now I
[48:57] want to talk about the life of David I
[48:59] love King David I think he was a
[49:01] righteous King and I thought he was a
[49:03] real full real-life Christian so if I
[49:05] could put myself in someone's shoes I
[49:07] can put myself in the key issues of
[49:09] David because not not I'm anointed king
[49:12] or something special but he had a heart
[49:15] of repentance he knew when to go Lord
[49:18] yeah I've done it wrong so I know I'm
[49:20] getting a bit of heat of myself but you
[49:22] know what I'm not going to stick to
[49:23] these notes I want you to get right is
[49:25] God doesn't want you to be perfect
[49:28] you can never ever ever be perfect you
[49:33] cannot out of your own ability add
[49:34] anything to this book to to Merit your
[49:38] salvation that's right so as long as you
[49:40] know that there's nothing you can do
[49:42] that can Merit your salvation there's
[49:44] nothing you can bring to the table that
[49:47] can bargain with God to get you into
[49:49] heaven it don't work that way it's
[49:52] called The Plan of Redemption and to
[49:54] redeem someone is to take them from a
[49:56] lost state
[49:57] but a state that we were from then they
[50:00] got lost and then placing them back into
[50:02] that state so you couldn't be lost to
[50:04] begin with you belonged to someone at
[50:06] the beginning and the Plan of Redemption
[50:08] is to say you belong to me but I'm gonna
[50:10] bring you back to that state so I'm
[50:14] going to redeem you to that state it's
[50:17] nothing you can do you're sitting right
[50:18] on the south and you just stand there
[50:20] and say Lord help me please okay we can
[50:24] walk every day we can fight the battle
[50:25] every day in our own ability we need to
[50:28] also walk in faith because remember
[50:30] Faith takes every Divine promise in the
[50:33] word and makes it as if it is out so so
[50:35] you have to have a Measure of Faith
[50:37] there must be something in you to say I
[50:39] believe this word there must be
[50:41] something to say Lord once more
[50:44] so so remember if we look at David's
[50:46] life David when something went wrong he
[50:48] didn't just fall on his knees and say
[50:50] that's it I'm dead
[50:52] okay he didn't just give up he said Lord
[50:54] once more yeah
[50:56] I miss that once more and we're allowed
[50:59] to do it now that doesn't condone sin at
[51:02] all don't get me wrong God hates sin he
[51:05] hates the appearance of sin he hates a
[51:07] liar he hates a backbiter he hates
[51:10] someone that's proud and arrogant he
[51:12] hates people that knows the word better
[51:14] than you and they can phrase it how many
[51:16] times over but they can't live their
[51:17] life because they don't want the life
[51:20] they want to speak the life and they
[51:22] want to judge people by their words but
[51:24] they cannot live this life
[51:26] amen so if that's not a picture of some
[51:29] of the churches today that can tell you
[51:31] everything you're doing wrong
[51:33] and even brothers and sisters in the
[51:35] chairs don't tell me what I'm doing
[51:36] wrong I know when I'm doing wrong you
[51:38] know if you have the Holy Spirit in you
[51:40] and you've stepped over the line you
[51:41] know you stepped over the line there's
[51:43] no other ways the moment you stepped
[51:45] over it you go Lord I've stepped over
[51:47] the line because that's still small
[51:48] voices within you the holy spirit in you
[51:51] is guiding you
[51:53] but you've stepped over the line now but
[51:56] what now
[51:59] so we spend time on these stupid devices
[52:03] amount of time on this devices and you
[52:05] know on your device I dare you to go
[52:07] download a app it's called the time
[52:09] tracker or or a something tracker on
[52:11] this app I did it once I was shocked I
[52:14] deleted it
[52:17] I'm sorry the truth will make you free
[52:21] okay in the Book of John I think it's
[52:24] John 8 it says that the truth will make
[52:26] you free John 8 31 go to John 8 31
[52:29] please
[52:30] all of you in your Bible readers grab
[52:33] your swords John 8 31.
[52:41] amen the truth will make you free
[52:44] so it's going to link into Peter do you
[52:48] have it up there
[52:50] or should I just go to I'll go to my
[52:52] Bible as well John 8. here we go
[52:55] and it says here in verse 31 and this is
[52:59] see now this is Jesus speaking
[53:02] so our lord Jesus is busy speaking and
[53:05] he says here
[53:07] where am I
[53:09] he says then Jesus said to those Jews
[53:12] which believed on him if ye continue in
[53:15] my word so I want you to repeat after me
[53:19] if you continue in my word so where are
[53:23] we supposed to be in his word this is
[53:27] the the King of Kings busy talking to
[53:29] Jews that believe on him and he says all
[53:31] you need to do
[53:33] stay in my word
[53:34] stay in my word
[53:37] um
[53:38] then you are my disciples indeed
[53:41] and ye shall know the truth and the
[53:43] truth shall
[53:45] make you free
[53:48] it doesn't set you free it's a process
[53:51] so the moment I believed on the Lord
[53:53] Jesus Christ either and automatically go
[53:56] holier than thou I made it I didn't
[54:00] I I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:03] but then my trials came oh yeah then my
[54:05] failings came then sin came because
[54:08] before that I didn't know what sin was
[54:10] because there was no righteousness there
[54:12] was no clean image to be held so I
[54:15] didn't know what sin is so you might be
[54:17] a young teenager you young people you
[54:20] can show me your faces don't have to
[54:21] hide you might be young and you might
[54:23] have no clue what sin is and you might
[54:25] be busy doing sin right now
[54:29] I'm telling you and you might not even
[54:31] know your instinct
[54:33] but see the Holy Ghost once you have it
[54:36] will lead you and guide you in all truth
[54:38] and then it will show you what sin is
[54:43] but if you don't know you're wrong how
[54:45] do you know you're wrong so if your dad
[54:46] never comes to you and say I'm going to
[54:47] use Joshua because I know in the
[54:49] basically go hey Josh yeah
[54:51] when you wash the car with a green
[54:52] Scarrow with a sharp side on it yeah
[54:55] it's not going to work
[54:57] but see Joss really wants to wash that
[55:00] car really clean and he saw his mom
[55:02] using the sports carer and I'm using it
[55:04] because it comes out of eyes and he's
[55:06] washing the car really clean and in his
[55:09] mind he's thinking he's doing a really
[55:10] good thing but his dad knows he's wrong
[55:13] it's a very carnal example but I want
[55:15] you to realize Josh out of the goodness
[55:18] of his heart thinks he's right
[55:20] and he's washing that car and his elbow
[55:23] is burning but the paint's going
[55:26] because he's scraping off the color code
[55:28] and his dad comes to and says bro
[55:31] stop it right there and he goes oh now
[55:34] Josh has two choices
[55:36] he can listen to his dad or he can carry
[55:38] on doing this
[55:40] are we listening to our dad
[55:43] so how do we know we're in sin if God
[55:45] doesn't touch that sin so we'll come
[55:48] back to the service now now I'm about to
[55:50] preach
[55:52] subject matter expert David
[55:55] who knows the story
[55:57] we all know this story eh oh yeah okay
[56:00] maybe we see see it different today
[56:05] David and Bathsheba
[56:08] and we'll go through the first slide
[56:09] there because I think it's it's good now
[56:11] I'll take my clicker because I need to
[56:12] go through the scriptures
[56:15] amen
[56:16] you all still with me
[56:18] now remember
[56:20] you don't know you were wrong
[56:22] until God showed you you were wrong
[56:24] just want to see if this one works
[56:28] yeah they said okay and we just read
[56:31] there and we're gonna go to second
[56:32] Samuel 11 1-5 you can grab your Bibles
[56:35] because that's very small I didn't think
[56:37] it was come out that small so I'm really
[56:38] sorry about that
[56:39] but don't worry about it we've got our
[56:41] Bibles
[56:43] and we're going to start the at verse 11
[56:45] 1-5
[56:47] so I'll just put up one to five here
[56:49] anyways because I've got all the oh no I
[56:51] can't I've got some stuff in me okay
[56:53] amen praise the Lord are you still awake
[56:57] don't worry I'm awake too
[56:59] because I started falling asleep we got
[57:01] problems and David and Bathsheba and it
[57:04] came to past well there after a year was
[57:07] expired now remember now that that Amon
[57:11] the king of Amon he started he came
[57:14] against David now so he got all the the
[57:18] people around him big armies everything
[57:20] and he besieged Jerusalem he wanted to
[57:23] take the kingdom of David
[57:25] but God was standing for him but
[57:27] realized that when this battle was
[57:29] raging on the Forefront David seen joab
[57:32] and all his troops to go and and keep
[57:34] this battle in a race okay and set the
[57:36] battle and right but David stayed at the
[57:37] back so and he came to pass that after
[57:39] years was expired at the time when kings
[57:42] go forth to battle that David sent Joe
[57:44] up and his servants with him and all
[57:47] Israel that they destroy the children of
[57:49] Ammon and beseech Rebel
[57:52] but David Terry is still in Jerusalem
[57:54] now I'm just going to preach around
[57:56] those things because I want you to
[57:57] realize this is you you're David today
[58:00] so people go to church
[58:02] you come to church
[58:04] but you stay behind at home
[58:07] it's the same battle
[58:08] see see the natural types of spiritual
[58:11] the the Manna in this Bible is not for
[58:14] you just to read the story of David but
[58:16] find yourself within the pages of David
[58:18] we are here the enemy is here they will
[58:22] don't want you to have a blessing today
[58:24] you can fall asleep you could worry
[58:26] about basketball rugby game on this
[58:28] weekend springboks lost who cares in the
[58:32] economy of God who cares
[58:34] okay did we take one step forward
[58:38] oh we didn't get to try we were robbed
[58:40] who cares so tomorrow when everything is
[58:42] done
[58:43] everything is done does the wreck became
[58:46] matter no so stay here today because
[58:50] this is for you amen this subject I
[58:52] would tell you I was sitting on my knees
[58:55] the whole of afternoon yesterday doesn't
[58:56] make me anything special to say Lord I
[58:59] just don't want to preach anything
[59:00] that's me so I do believe today with the
[59:04] confirmation of this one who read this
[59:05] morning's family altar who read it
[59:09] this is this is this is what I'm talking
[59:11] about it's this morning's family altar
[59:13] because God comes and confirms that I am
[59:15] with you I was so nervous when I woke up
[59:17] this morning the first thing I said is
[59:18] Lord I'm thinking I might not be ready
[59:21] for this one and he's saying that family
[59:23] altar thank you sister Robin and it's
[59:25] exactly where we are today
[59:27] God has this this is for someone make it
[59:29] yours amen so David stayed behind church
[59:34] was going David he just started I'm not
[59:37] impressed
[59:38] because you know what youth everyone we
[59:41] want to be entertained I can sit till 12
[59:44] o'clock at night and Google YouTube
[59:46] Snapchat and all those things but he
[59:49] wants to come to church I want to I want
[59:51] to go somewhere else
[59:53] how can you be blessed
[59:56] he says and it came to past that in the
[59:58] evening time David arose off his bed and
[1:00:01] walked upon the roof of the King's house
[1:00:04] and from the roof we saw a woman washing
[1:00:06] herself
[1:00:08] man it's small sorry
[1:00:12] and the woman was very beautiful to look
[1:00:14] upon
[1:00:16] sin is beautiful
[1:00:18] inside
[1:00:19] sin is beautiful if sin wasn't beautiful
[1:00:22] none of us would do it
[1:00:26] so brother Brandon picks it up here and
[1:00:28] he says here and I need to read it from
[1:00:30] here he says there are three things I've
[1:00:33] noticed in the reading of history that
[1:00:35] Rick's a Minister's life
[1:00:37] from the start
[1:00:38] one of them is money and the love of it
[1:00:41] the second one is popularity because he
[1:00:44] thinks he's something when he's nothing
[1:00:46] anyhow and then the next thing is woman
[1:00:48] that's right a man makes money woman
[1:00:51] popularity
[1:00:53] that's been
[1:00:54] I'm going to read it if I can sorry
[1:00:57] that that's right a man makes money
[1:01:00] woman popularity that's been the three
[1:01:02] major things that God has troubled us
[1:01:05] we are trouble with these children many
[1:01:07] of many of the other things that goes
[1:01:09] along with the two so he's not say it's
[1:01:11] not just these three
[1:01:13] he says that's the main three things
[1:01:14] that starts Wars that begins things a
[1:01:18] lot of people say oh religion is the
[1:01:19] fourth thing religion is never the
[1:01:20] fourth thing it's always about a woman
[1:01:22] money and power popularity okay they use
[1:01:26] religion as an excuse
[1:01:28] but religion don't start it my God never
[1:01:30] say though it was in the Old Testament
[1:01:32] we have to fight we have to take the
[1:01:34] land since the Lord Jesus came in my
[1:01:36] life he never said fight with your
[1:01:37] brother he said even if you're angry
[1:01:39] with your brother
[1:01:41] you have committed murder
[1:01:43] because you kill this influence
[1:01:45] okay even if you're angry with someone
[1:01:48] and you're justifiably right
[1:01:50] and he's done you 100 wrong the moment
[1:01:52] you lose your temper you cut off Grace
[1:01:54] from him
[1:01:55] for yourself
[1:01:57] and you say he's out of the blood you
[1:01:59] can't do that we don't pitch folks and
[1:02:01] services we don't come and sit here and
[1:02:03] say this is for this one and this one's
[1:02:04] this one it's for us amen amen we're
[1:02:07] still following
[1:02:09] so he says then but the main thing is
[1:02:12] that God begins to bless a brother and
[1:02:13] give him something little more or
[1:02:15] something other to help him and his
[1:02:17] people and then the man begins to think
[1:02:20] greatest battle ever thought is way
[1:02:23] in the mind that's where Satan always
[1:02:25] comes he says then the man begins to
[1:02:28] think see who I am
[1:02:30] and right then he's on the road and I'll
[1:02:33] tell you
[1:02:34] you know how to get up is to get down
[1:02:37] the Way Up Is Down amen he that humbles
[1:02:40] himself God will exalt him is that right
[1:02:42] he that exalts him God will break make
[1:02:45] him a base
[1:02:46] so now David remember he's now King and
[1:02:49] David is now sitting in a position of
[1:02:52] authority and now the very next verse it
[1:02:54] says and David sent to inquire after the
[1:02:56] woman and one said is this not beshiba
[1:02:59] the daughter of Eli
[1:03:01] the wife of Uriah the hittai
[1:03:05] now he's got two choices
[1:03:08] you always have two choices you go right
[1:03:10] or wrong there's no two other ways boys
[1:03:12] I hope you're listening
[1:03:14] you either have yes or no
[1:03:17] you have write or go
[1:03:20] when you're in between those two choices
[1:03:21] that's when the battle is on
[1:03:25] Israel was fighting an enemy but David
[1:03:28] was fighting a far greater one because
[1:03:30] the law forbid him to do that
[1:03:33] he knew well what was the Commandment of
[1:03:35] the Lord he knew well what was wrong so
[1:03:38] when he started looking at this when he
[1:03:40] saw this and and the word came back to
[1:03:42] him they said to him don't do it
[1:03:45] because this man is this woman is
[1:03:47] married
[1:03:48] then this should have gone through his
[1:03:50] head yes and you cannot tell me when you
[1:03:53] in sin and you're looking at things and
[1:03:55] you see the image on a phone on a
[1:03:58] computer I don't care what you say you
[1:04:01] see that image something inside you
[1:04:03] don't tell you uh
[1:04:06] we shouldn't be yeah
[1:04:08] come on I was there
[1:04:10] every time I open my phone young men
[1:04:12] young women and I start looking at
[1:04:15] fashion and I start looking at what the
[1:04:17] world models do and I start distracting
[1:04:19] by the things that is pleasing to the
[1:04:21] eyes and lustful to the desire I'm not
[1:04:24] sure just talking pornography and those
[1:04:26] things I'm talking something that I
[1:04:28] really want that I would place above God
[1:04:31] I would place that time above God
[1:04:33] Superstars sport cars collection
[1:04:37] anything that would consume your mind so
[1:04:40] much that would take you away from this
[1:04:42] now I'm not saying we should stay in
[1:04:44] this all day wrong and just read our
[1:04:46] Bible it's not what I'm saying don't get
[1:04:48] me wrong we live we work
[1:04:51] but if it's taking all your time from
[1:04:54] this there's no balance
[1:04:57] so if you find yourself waking up in the
[1:04:58] morning and you haven't read your Bible
[1:05:01] for a week
[1:05:02] you haven't really prayed for a week you
[1:05:05] are not communing with our Lord Jesus
[1:05:07] Christ you're here
[1:05:09] he's saying that you're busy committing
[1:05:11] adultery and these laws now the law
[1:05:14] we're not under the law but we love our
[1:05:16] Lord Jesus Christ and if I start walking
[1:05:19] away from my wife and I will use her a
[1:05:21] bit of example today and I start getting
[1:05:23] busy with all other things how's my wife
[1:05:26] going to feel
[1:05:27] true so I not because I've got a ring on
[1:05:30] my finger I should stay true to her
[1:05:33] because I've got a ring on my finger I
[1:05:35] want to stay true to her me and dad was
[1:05:37] talking about it yesterday about
[1:05:39] choosing the Lord Jesus Christ as your
[1:05:41] husband
[1:05:42] you're not you're not just marry his arm
[1:05:44] you marry the whole book
[1:05:46] okay you eat it sweet in your mouth
[1:05:48] better in your belly because some of the
[1:05:49] things that he ask you ain't always nice
[1:05:52] sin needs to come to the service who has
[1:05:54] ever lied
[1:05:56] please I want to see Hands you save a
[1:05:59] life because maybe if nobody lie I want
[1:06:01] to ask you how do you do it I've lied
[1:06:03] okay who's ever had to confess a lie
[1:06:07] okay how fun is that
[1:06:11] how fun is it is it fun say dad you know
[1:06:14] I just wrecked your car like sorry yes
[1:06:17] you told me I couldn't do it and I
[1:06:19] couldn't take it but guess what I still
[1:06:21] did it and I wrecked your car and your
[1:06:23] dad looks you in your eyes I'm just
[1:06:25] using day because he's the closest and
[1:06:26] he goes what
[1:06:28] how do you feel at that moment
[1:06:32] but now I want to ask you and this is
[1:06:34] where I'm preaching a bit
[1:06:36] if you hold that sin
[1:06:38] and you put it in your pocket and it
[1:06:40] walks with you every day
[1:06:42] the sites you visit the places you go
[1:06:45] the lies you tell all the sin you just
[1:06:48] put in your pocket and you put it in and
[1:06:50] you put it in and you put it in and you
[1:06:51] put it in and you put it in and you put
[1:06:52] it in and you get a new home and you
[1:06:56] just a Grumble bee
[1:06:58] and everybody gets close to you just
[1:06:59] want to say yeah
[1:07:01] and people talk about you like this one
[1:07:03] there and sticky fingers and because now
[1:07:06] what happens is your your body is taking
[1:07:08] up a burden that is not yours sin should
[1:07:12] not be attributed to you you should get
[1:07:14] rid of it as soon as you can because all
[1:07:17] it does it weighs you down sister Romans
[1:07:21] saying that that message this morning it
[1:07:24] steals the joy of your salvation it
[1:07:27] cannot take your salvation but it steals
[1:07:30] your joy amen that's the conclusion I
[1:07:33] had but I thought I'll just say it in
[1:07:34] right now you start becoming miserable
[1:07:37] you're you're just grumpy and all that's
[1:07:40] in you wants just to to either hurt
[1:07:43] someone or walk away from people and you
[1:07:45] find yourself sitting in a little corner
[1:07:47] and having your own pity party
[1:07:50] and this one said this about me and that
[1:07:52] one say this and I'm never good enough
[1:07:54] for this and every time I get to the
[1:07:56] front they say no it's not your turn and
[1:07:57] then and you start back biting and you
[1:07:59] start gossiping and you start just
[1:08:01] murmuring and you start being like
[1:08:03] Israel when they were in the desert
[1:08:06] you murmur you become a c spool
[1:08:09] everything inside you is like a passing
[1:08:11] saw and I know it's really hard but I
[1:08:13] want you to say it's not good to have
[1:08:16] that sin you cannot stay with that sin
[1:08:20] it's not yours it's not yours so now
[1:08:24] we'll jump a little bit ahead and David
[1:08:26] said messages and took her and so he had
[1:08:29] a choice to make the right choice
[1:08:31] thou shall not kill that's coming they
[1:08:33] also not commit adultery he's going to
[1:08:35] do it and that's it that shall not cover
[1:08:37] the neighbors
[1:08:40] he knows this
[1:08:42] and he goes and do it anyway
[1:08:46] he wasn't in a bad state
[1:08:48] he was just lifted up I'm King I got 500
[1:08:51] wives I can have one more
[1:08:54] so his his State wasn't under under
[1:08:57] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:59] he had a oops moment
[1:09:02] and oops moments happen
[1:09:05] it does
[1:09:06] don't don't worry about the oops moments
[1:09:09] it happens and it will happen very very
[1:09:11] because as long as the Lord is working
[1:09:13] with you and he's adding to your virtue
[1:09:15] Temperance until your Temperance is
[1:09:17] adding faith
[1:09:19] patience brotherly kindness you know as
[1:09:22] he's working with you as he's cleaning
[1:09:24] you out you will find some of the things
[1:09:26] that you do now is wrong and the Bible
[1:09:28] don't want you to do it and if you're a
[1:09:30] Bible reader you can find it in it I
[1:09:32] have nothing against this message
[1:09:33] because this message never came and gave
[1:09:35] me a Doctrine
[1:09:37] it just pointed me back in the word we
[1:09:39] got hotties it went back to the word and
[1:09:42] says you know what God doesn't really
[1:09:43] like this here's your example and I went
[1:09:45] oh
[1:09:46] all if God don't like it I don't like it
[1:09:48] amen and then he goes just remember when
[1:09:51] it wasn't the old though Jezebel and I
[1:09:52] can talk about Jezebel because everybody
[1:09:54] gets scared when we talk about these
[1:09:56] things but there's one woman that wore
[1:09:58] makeup in the Bible it was Jezebel yeah
[1:10:01] I'm sorry you you eat it you take it you
[1:10:03] talk to God about one woman
[1:10:05] okay and the dogs licked her blood
[1:10:08] because God hated her because she tore
[1:10:11] she tore a man of God away from God and
[1:10:14] she made him serve her Gods that's the
[1:10:16] only example I have of someone wearing
[1:10:17] makeup
[1:10:18] if you want to make weird makeup you
[1:10:21] talk to God if you don't want to wear it
[1:10:23] you talk to God I'm going to tell you
[1:10:25] what to do but I've written the word and
[1:10:28] the word says thus and I think you know
[1:10:29] what Lord even if it's an Old Testament
[1:10:33] I want the whole book
[1:10:35] amen okay
[1:10:36] so a woman cutting hair I know this is a
[1:10:38] very
[1:10:39] situation I know people that love the
[1:10:42] Lord very much
[1:10:44] that read this Bible and more devoted
[1:10:46] than a lot of us
[1:10:48] and that scripture hasn't been revealed
[1:10:49] to us and it's fine because as they walk
[1:10:53] with the Lord he's going to add he's
[1:10:55] going to add but don't stop because it
[1:10:58] grinds you don't stop because it's
[1:11:00] kicking against you don't stop whatever
[1:11:02] you do don't just shun the word take the
[1:11:04] whole word the all the new from give it
[1:11:07] to Kiva listen I cannot get you into the
[1:11:10] kingdom of God I cannot tell you what's
[1:11:11] the heart of God but I know that a
[1:11:13] Vindicated Prophet came down to this
[1:11:15] earth and he was standing in prayer
[1:11:17] lines now I've never seen such a thing
[1:11:19] in my life
[1:11:21] I've never heard any sermon in all of
[1:11:23] the denominations
[1:11:25] where a pastor stood on a pulp and said
[1:11:28] I'm waiting for him to come and then he
[1:11:30] says he's here now if you've listened to
[1:11:32] those tapes
[1:11:34] talk to me
[1:11:35] if you if you've listened to the
[1:11:37] discernment where God reveals to a
[1:11:40] person they name where they come from
[1:11:42] when they were sitting with the doctor
[1:11:44] what they have who are they praying for
[1:11:47] them and they say thus save the Lord
[1:11:49] you're healed there's more to that man
[1:11:52] just in the simple sermon that he's
[1:11:54] preaching
[1:11:55] I just want to tell you that people
[1:11:57] knock this message a lot I stand for
[1:11:59] every little bit of it and I will never
[1:12:01] ever in my life
[1:12:03] compromise with it
[1:12:06] because I'll tell you what I was David
[1:12:09] this story is me
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:13] my wife's not here now you asked my wife
[1:12:16] I was David
[1:12:22] I was
[1:12:25] and the woman conceived and said to
[1:12:27] David that I'm with child now David's
[1:12:29] got a problem
[1:12:33] David made a mistake but now he's
[1:12:36] reaping
[1:12:37] what is sowing
[1:12:40] he's now reaping what he's sowing
[1:12:43] now listen to David Now navigate to a
[1:12:45] point where he could either
[1:12:47] because remember law now
[1:12:49] says he's a date man
[1:12:52] doesn't matter if you're King the law
[1:12:54] says that woman was married
[1:12:57] to Uriah
[1:12:59] that's right so by his law it's certain
[1:13:02] death
[1:13:04] so now he tries to cover it up but you
[1:13:07] see you reap what you sow Galatians 6
[1:13:09] 7-10 be not deceived God is Not mocked
[1:13:12] for whatsoever a man soweth he shall
[1:13:14] also reapeth
[1:13:15] God's not mocked
[1:13:18] you know
[1:13:20] so Uriah comes to him he calls her eye
[1:13:22] off the battlefield and I'm just going
[1:13:24] to tell you the story and he sees to
[1:13:26] Ariah and will paraphrase a bit go read
[1:13:28] the account he says go sleep go go to
[1:13:30] your house go to your house go be with
[1:13:32] your wife
[1:13:33] just go there what does Uriah do who
[1:13:35] knows the story yeah
[1:13:36] he goes lies at the gate
[1:13:39] and he says how can I amen amen while
[1:13:43] the ark is out there can I go inside my
[1:13:46] house and wash my feet and Beam with my
[1:13:48] wife
[1:13:49] look if I was a writer I would have gone
[1:13:51] straight to my wife I love my wife I
[1:13:54] love my wife with everything in me
[1:13:55] because for me I just love my wife but
[1:13:59] see this man wasn't even a Jew he was a
[1:14:02] gentile
[1:14:02] he was a gentile and a gentile had so
[1:14:06] much love for David the king I want you
[1:14:09] to read between the life lines he had so
[1:14:11] much love for David the king our Lord
[1:14:13] Jesus Christ that he said I will not go
[1:14:15] to my wife
[1:14:19] and God ordained it because he wanted to
[1:14:22] expose sin
[1:14:24] and then again David says oh no I'm not
[1:14:26] getting anywhere here so he makes him
[1:14:27] drunk
[1:14:28] and he says now go to your wife what
[1:14:31] does Ariah do he does not go
[1:14:34] because inside of him there is something
[1:14:36] he is an honest loyal Christian
[1:14:40] you know brother Branham seek when he
[1:14:42] gets to Heaven he's going to go to Uriah
[1:14:44] and he's going to shake his hand
[1:14:48] I I've listened to and I want to maybe
[1:14:51] just say something here I've listened to
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:54] I think over 800 sermons of brother
[1:14:57] Brenner
[1:14:59] not once did he make himself God
[1:15:02] not once did he give him glory to
[1:15:04] himself
[1:15:05] and every prayer line I've heard not
[1:15:08] once that one challenge come back and
[1:15:10] said it's not true when he said in the
[1:15:12] name of our Lord Jesus Christ thus save
[1:15:14] the Lord it came to pass every time
[1:15:19] see but and I feel I just feel I just
[1:15:22] feel like I just want to say this don't
[1:15:24] don't don't criticize me don't criticize
[1:15:26] this Mission I'm going to tell you
[1:15:27] something have you gone and listened
[1:15:31] he that every year let him hear
[1:15:34] it is the lady you see on Church age
[1:15:36] it's the last Church before I came into
[1:15:39] this message I didn't even know what a
[1:15:41] church age was
[1:15:44] I didn't even know what was sin I didn't
[1:15:47] even know that sin goes all back and I
[1:15:49] knew God I knew of God
[1:15:52] I knew that he's going to punish me for
[1:15:54] my sins and then he came died and died
[1:15:56] on the cross and he took all my sins
[1:15:57] away and that's good enough Grace Grace
[1:15:59] Grace I knew that but nobody could tell
[1:16:02] me where I'm standing in time
[1:16:06] nobody could say you're in an age which
[1:16:09] is increased with goods and need of
[1:16:12] nothing naked blind and miserable and
[1:16:14] they don't know it
[1:16:18] it wasn't a Doctrine it was a voice
[1:16:22] and as long as I have breathed in this
[1:16:24] ear you either stand for something if
[1:16:26] you fall for everything but you can only
[1:16:29] go this far and God will sit but I send
[1:16:31] you a witness
[1:16:33] I'll send you a message to tell you
[1:16:35] where you are I've given you a warning
[1:16:38] I don't know if you ever listened to the
[1:16:40] sermon flashing red light
[1:16:43] I've given you a warning to say time is
[1:16:45] no more
[1:16:46] and it wasn't to line us up with a
[1:16:48] Doctrine
[1:16:50] it was telled to say read your Bible
[1:16:53] pray every day connect to me because
[1:16:56] it's only one way you're going in a
[1:16:58] rapture's you have the Holy Ghost so if
[1:17:00] you if you think you have the Holy Ghost
[1:17:02] then you're good because the Holy Ghost
[1:17:04] will take you in the rapture
[1:17:06] but the Bible gives us strict
[1:17:08] instructions how to do everything but we
[1:17:11] choose to listen to the word of man and
[1:17:14] we forget about the word of God and the
[1:17:16] word of man makes the word the doctrines
[1:17:18] of man makes the word of God to no
[1:17:20] effect it is hard I know it's hard
[1:17:23] but guess what I'm not the pastor
[1:17:24] brother Bean will pick this up and he
[1:17:26] will put all the balance on because he's
[1:17:28] the pastor I just live a life
[1:17:30] but I've seen people heal I've seen my
[1:17:33] son heal I've seen my life change I've
[1:17:36] seen its life change that's all it's
[1:17:38] life change my Dad's life changed my mom
[1:17:42] she loves the Lord she's still walking
[1:17:44] her life will change because it says no
[1:17:47] hoof shall be left behind
[1:17:49] because before this message there was no
[1:17:52] power of the Holy Ghost before this
[1:17:55] message it was a lot of anointing
[1:17:58] I want you to read between the lines a
[1:18:00] lot of anointing a lot of things that
[1:18:02] happened signs and wonders that's not
[1:18:04] where we look
[1:18:05] we don't look it says we can adulterous
[1:18:07] Nation looks after signs of Wonders we
[1:18:09] look in the word because we're married
[1:18:11] to the word I want to know everything
[1:18:13] about you Lord everything that's right
[1:18:17] everything I want to know why when it is
[1:18:20] the Gentile dispensation is going over
[1:18:22] I'm so away with my servant but praise
[1:18:24] the lord we need to change of the G-Spot
[1:18:26] a gentile dispensation when the cup of
[1:18:28] iniquity is flowing over when it's at
[1:18:31] the end where are you
[1:18:33] because I ain't going through a
[1:18:34] tribulation
[1:18:36] are you not going through a tribulation
[1:18:38] I haven't aligned my life up I'm not
[1:18:40] saying I'm not fighting these battles
[1:18:42] I'm not saying I'm not failing I'm not
[1:18:45] saying that every day God brings me to
[1:18:46] my knees and picks me up again I'm not
[1:18:48] saying that
[1:18:49] I just say I know where I'm going and I
[1:18:51] know what I believe
[1:18:53] amen it is very strong but you know what
[1:18:56] sometimes we just need to say it as it
[1:18:57] is there is no other way out that's
[1:19:00] right amen we continue
[1:19:05] so Uriah gets killed
[1:19:07] and they come back to David and they say
[1:19:09] don't worry bro your sin is covered
[1:19:12] your plan worked
[1:19:16] how many times did we lie to our moms
[1:19:18] and dads how many times did we lie to
[1:19:19] our bosses how many times did we tell a
[1:19:22] Porky
[1:19:23] and we think we got away with it how
[1:19:26] many times
[1:19:27] how many times did God tell you to do
[1:19:29] something and you just flat ignored it
[1:19:31] because of Pride or because of of your
[1:19:34] own ability or your own way of thinking
[1:19:36] you know the Pharisees and the
[1:19:38] statistics are their way of thinking and
[1:19:40] Jesus told them time and again and time
[1:19:42] and again and they just were
[1:19:45] they were blinded but they they didn't
[1:19:48] want to hear it
[1:19:50] didn't sit well with him doesn't go with
[1:19:52] their lifestyle right you know I have to
[1:19:54] kick a bit more YouTube videos off and
[1:19:56] you know maybe have to uh you know align
[1:19:59] myself a little bit more up and spend
[1:20:01] time in this thing called the word
[1:20:02] listen to the message of the hour have
[1:20:05] you ever gone through the Revelation
[1:20:06] series have you gone through the church
[1:20:09] age book
[1:20:10] I I challenge you to go do that before
[1:20:13] you speak about the prophet because it
[1:20:15] says you receive a prophet in the name
[1:20:17] of a prophet you will get a prophet's
[1:20:19] reward
[1:20:19] okay you you receive a righteous man in
[1:20:22] the name of a righteous man you'll get a
[1:20:24] righteous man's reward so there's a lot
[1:20:26] of people out there but there's only one
[1:20:27] prophet of this hour
[1:20:29] amen and he was Vindicated it wasn't
[1:20:31] just a bunch of sermons that's right
[1:20:33] okay now
[1:20:35] here we go one day Mr David docking
[1:20:39] Brother David sitting there on the
[1:20:40] throne and uh
[1:20:43] Nathan the prophet comes to him
[1:20:47] now I want to quickly tell you
[1:20:50] that by Your Word you will be judged
[1:20:52] because sister Belinda said it this
[1:20:54] morning it's the spoken word
[1:20:56] what comes out of this lips God is
[1:20:58] listening
[1:20:59] he also judge you on your own words you
[1:21:02] don't need to have
[1:21:04] a a prophet you've got one already but
[1:21:06] you need to have a prophet to tell you
[1:21:07] what is wrong God's going to judge you
[1:21:10] by your own words because the moment you
[1:21:11] speak that it will return to you because
[1:21:14] you reap what you sow
[1:21:15] and what you caused upon the water that
[1:21:17] breed you caused the deal to come back
[1:21:19] to you so if it's good bread or bad
[1:21:20] breed you're going to eat it one day
[1:21:21] you're going to receive it yeah so
[1:21:24] backbiting gossiping you know talking
[1:21:27] bad about brothers and sisters those
[1:21:29] type of things it will come back to you
[1:21:31] but I'll tell you why because God wants
[1:21:34] to expose that sin amen okay so I'm not
[1:21:37] I'm not I'm not dangling over hell don't
[1:21:39] get me wrong just hear me out God wants
[1:21:41] to expose sin that's right because he
[1:21:44] wants you sinless and blameless and he's
[1:21:47] going to help you because remember when
[1:21:49] we read second Peter he says I will add
[1:21:52] I will add I will add I will add to you
[1:21:55] and add to you so he will make you free
[1:21:57] don't worry about it but just remember
[1:22:00] when he's when he's busy talking to you
[1:22:02] not condemnation conviction there's a
[1:22:04] response
[1:22:06] so
[1:22:08] um Nathan the prophet comes out and he
[1:22:09] talks about this they were two men in
[1:22:11] one city and one was rich and the other
[1:22:14] one was very poor and he had a little ew
[1:22:16] lamb and he treated it like a daughter
[1:22:18] and he loved it so much and and then
[1:22:20] this rich man had a visitor from out of
[1:22:22] town and then he took this this ew of
[1:22:25] this little lamb of this guy and he just
[1:22:27] killed it and prepared it and gave it to
[1:22:30] the man to eat
[1:22:31] and David was angry
[1:22:33] because now Omar why would you do this
[1:22:37] but his own his own mouth says as the
[1:22:40] Lord liveth the man that have done this
[1:22:43] thing shall die
[1:22:46] surely die
[1:22:48] speaking judgment over himself not
[1:22:51] knowing what he's doing
[1:22:53] so telling you sometimes when you speak
[1:22:55] judgment and you and you speak what you
[1:22:58] know you speak be careful yeah because
[1:23:01] the way you measure you will be measured
[1:23:04] okay yeah
[1:23:05] so of course then and I'm just showing
[1:23:07] the pictures for the kids look there's
[1:23:09] pictures kids don't fall asleep
[1:23:11] that's Nathan and his pointing finger
[1:23:14] okay he's pointing finger and he says to
[1:23:17] David it's you
[1:23:20] you are that man
[1:23:23] and David has a moment where he his mind
[1:23:26] goes clear
[1:23:28] and he goes oh Lord what have I said
[1:23:30] what if I see it just now
[1:23:34] because he's the king so David is in a
[1:23:38] backslidden condition now I want to ask
[1:23:40] you something and it was with the
[1:23:42] ministers we had a bit of a chat about
[1:23:43] it but if you're backslidden
[1:23:47] does that cost you salvation
[1:23:51] no
[1:23:52] it puts you out of Fellowship
[1:23:55] but it doesn't cost you your salvation
[1:23:58] God gives you your salvation God died on
[1:24:00] the cross for all your sins he made the
[1:24:02] way that's the noble Kingdom coming to
[1:24:04] the good part don't don't fall asleep on
[1:24:06] me now I know it's hot we can maybe turn
[1:24:09] the temperature all way down if you want
[1:24:10] to brother keep being get them freezing
[1:24:12] okay
[1:24:18] there's this Noble King so David wasn't
[1:24:21] out of Fellowship
[1:24:22] wasn't wasn't out of salvation
[1:24:25] he just lost his joy and I'm going to
[1:24:27] bring it to you because that's what
[1:24:28] happened this morning there was a king
[1:24:30] such a noble King a great lover of his
[1:24:33] subjects I want you to read between the
[1:24:35] lines and one day before his God and His
[1:24:38] royalties said you know what today
[1:24:40] you'll see me for the last time in many
[1:24:42] years
[1:24:45] and he's God and His Noble said to him
[1:24:48] good King why do you say then are you
[1:24:50] going to go to some foreign country are
[1:24:52] you going to be alien there he says no
[1:24:54] I'm staying right here but I'm going
[1:24:56] amongst my subjects I'm going to become
[1:24:59] a peasant
[1:25:01] a great king
[1:25:03] is going to go lower
[1:25:05] than the lowest low we had a footwash
[1:25:08] junkie you know my foot was flunky he
[1:25:12] just he washed the feet
[1:25:14] of men that's right please read between
[1:25:17] the lines here this means a lot to me
[1:25:20] it's not it's not an emotional thing we
[1:25:22] had a great king
[1:25:25] it says I'm going to cut wood with a
[1:25:27] wood Chopper I'm going to till the
[1:25:29] ground with a toiler I'm going to work
[1:25:31] The Vineyards with the people that that
[1:25:33] prune The Vineyards I'm going to be one
[1:25:35] of them in order to get better
[1:25:37] acquainted with what they are doing
[1:25:40] because before that if you look at the
[1:25:42] life of Israel they were up and down and
[1:25:45] up and down and God came angry and and
[1:25:46] then and then angry and and then he
[1:25:48] forgave them and angry and he forgave
[1:25:50] them and and David by that account
[1:25:52] should have died God forgave him he was
[1:25:55] not under the blood of of Jesus Christ
[1:25:58] he was under the blood of bulls and
[1:25:59] goats he was under the law
[1:26:01] he was strictly on the law me and Dad
[1:26:03] told me this is actually we're really
[1:26:05] anchored he said if you're under the law
[1:26:07] you should have kept all the law Not
[1:26:09] Just the Ten Commandments I love it
[1:26:11] thanks Dad it was really a blessed me so
[1:26:13] much when you said it because I was here
[1:26:15] when you said that so if you really
[1:26:17] wanted to keep all the law you had to
[1:26:20] keep all of it but if you lost one bit
[1:26:22] of it yeah stiff there was no Grace
[1:26:25] Aiken took a Babylonian garment yeah
[1:26:29] and his whole family and his cattle and
[1:26:33] everything got destroyed because he was
[1:26:35] under the law but he is a great King
[1:26:37] David the heart of God that he loved so
[1:26:40] much yet this man finds Mercy is it fair
[1:26:44] it is because it's God's doing not yours
[1:26:47] and it's marvelous in our sight so he
[1:26:50] says and I'm going to be one of them
[1:26:51] because I love them and I want to be
[1:26:54] more acquainted to them personally is
[1:26:57] our Lord Jesus Christ personally
[1:26:59] acquainted to you this morning
[1:27:03] are you having such a relationship when
[1:27:05] some days you just sit in your bed and
[1:27:06] you start crying oh Lord
[1:27:08] where would I be if it wasn't for you
[1:27:10] hey
[1:27:13] when I was David I read the story and
[1:27:16] all I saw was our month and I'm thinking
[1:27:18] oh God I should have died in my sins
[1:27:24] one day I'll tell you my testimony
[1:27:27] I'm going to cut wood with a wood
[1:27:29] chipper I'm going to tour the ground
[1:27:30] it's just because I personally want to
[1:27:32] love them the next morning the delegates
[1:27:33] and all of the people saw him left take
[1:27:36] off his crown laid upon the throne take
[1:27:39] off his robe put on his peas and clothes
[1:27:41] and he was born in a manger
[1:27:45] and brother Branham says yeah
[1:27:48] they said to the king king we want you
[1:27:51] we love you
[1:27:52] because all that heaven knows who he is
[1:27:54] it's only us that's sitting here in time
[1:27:57] that forgets who he really is
[1:27:59] sure it's only us is sitting in this
[1:28:01] veil of mortality that actually know who
[1:28:04] he is
[1:28:05] but who all is in heaven knows the king
[1:28:07] of kings and for that time when they
[1:28:10] were silenced that silence was when he
[1:28:11] left the throne to come to us
[1:28:15] because he knew he had to come down and
[1:28:17] he had to come and get our monstrovi on
[1:28:19] this Earth and that was where God did it
[1:28:21] he changed himself from being Jehovah
[1:28:23] God and became one of us so that he
[1:28:25] might suffer
[1:28:28] then he might taste taste death that he
[1:28:31] might know what is this thing of Dave
[1:28:32] was and he take the penalty of death
[1:28:34] upon himself and he laid himself and
[1:28:36] down a crown and a robe and became one
[1:28:39] of us
[1:28:41] he washed out feet he washed feet with
[1:28:43] with the lowly he dwelt in things with
[1:28:47] the poor he slipped in the woods and in
[1:28:49] the streets and those who were on that
[1:28:52] was unprivileged he became one of us
[1:28:54] that he might understand us better and
[1:28:57] then he might understand him better yes
[1:28:59] so we can't go standy before God and say
[1:29:03] Lord you don't know
[1:29:05] he was tempted just like us
[1:29:08] okay it was everything that we went
[1:29:10] through he went through because he had
[1:29:12] to understand you
[1:29:14] Lord so David this is the heart of David
[1:29:16] this is what I want to ask you if if
[1:29:18] you're finding yourself
[1:29:20] on that side
[1:29:22] you're finding yourself
[1:29:25] lost
[1:29:27] distracted
[1:29:30] occupied
[1:29:32] is a way back
[1:29:34] you don't need to stay there
[1:29:36] and your battle is not going to get
[1:29:38] easier
[1:29:39] but the quicker you realize the way you
[1:29:41] stand yes the quicker load can bring you
[1:29:44] back up in
[1:29:45] because when he knows where you stands
[1:29:47] then you know where you stand and when
[1:29:48] you know you stand with God then God can
[1:29:50] say give it to me
[1:29:52] yes but give me your sin
[1:29:54] if you need to say sorry to a brother go
[1:29:56] say sorry
[1:29:57] if you need to say Lord I I cry out my
[1:30:00] eyes before you then you do that you do
[1:30:02] whatever you need to do to get right
[1:30:04] with God today because there ain't no
[1:30:07] time
[1:30:08] you don't need to be in a perfect State
[1:30:10] you need to be in a perfect state with
[1:30:12] him
[1:30:13] amen he knows you
[1:30:15] he knows you no matter what I tell you
[1:30:17] if you've committed adultery you talk to
[1:30:20] God
[1:30:21] committing adultery is not just man and
[1:30:24] wife
[1:30:25] it's man and wife
[1:30:27] if someone else is your your man your
[1:30:29] husband your your effort your love your
[1:30:32] fiction if there's anything else that
[1:30:34] see a fiction above him make it right
[1:30:36] today yes I'm not doing altar call I'm
[1:30:39] telling you make it right today because
[1:30:41] you don't want to hinder your walk with
[1:30:43] the Lord that's right
[1:30:44] and David said unto Nathan I've sinned
[1:30:47] against the Lord and Nathan said unto
[1:30:49] David and the Lord hath put away thy sin
[1:30:52] thou shall not die
[1:30:54] and it's only a prophet that can say
[1:30:56] that anyways because remember the law
[1:30:59] was the law but the prophet is where
[1:31:02] Grace comes through that's where where
[1:31:04] God comes and says don't worry I got you
[1:31:06] you don't need to die amen okay because
[1:31:10] now if there is a place for you that you
[1:31:13] can cross where you can come back but
[1:31:16] when it is that you're down there again
[1:31:18] in the same shape you was it goes to
[1:31:22] show that the only Fell From Grace
[1:31:24] backsliding is not lost
[1:31:27] I want someone to tell me where
[1:31:29] backsliding is lost proven in the Bible
[1:31:31] backsliding is not lost it's just out of
[1:31:35] Fellowship Israel backslid but they
[1:31:37] never lost the Covenant they lost their
[1:31:40] praise and their Joy
[1:31:43] so when you backslide there's a
[1:31:45] consequence there's a consequence if you
[1:31:47] lose your joy and you lose your praise
[1:31:49] to God you can't stand in church and
[1:31:51] lift your hands and say glory be to God
[1:31:53] you can't
[1:31:54] and every time people look at you your
[1:31:56] face looks worse for wear now I've been
[1:31:59] through a couple of Trials this last
[1:32:02] couple of weeks months okay
[1:32:04] and all that's learned is I get
[1:32:06] distracted and I lose my joy and it's
[1:32:09] all the devil can take from you he
[1:32:12] cannot take your salvation but he will
[1:32:14] take your joy he will take it because
[1:32:17] it's the only thing he can take is the
[1:32:19] joy and your praise and he wants you to
[1:32:22] praise him because all this
[1:32:24] garbage music out there and all this
[1:32:27] YouTube stuff and all this wishy-washy
[1:32:29] gospel
[1:32:31] because if you praise him in that you've
[1:32:33] given your praise to the wrong person
[1:32:34] because it said at the end time the two
[1:32:36] seats will be so very close and will
[1:32:38] deceive the very elective Force possible
[1:32:39] and Satan wanted to be as God be exalted
[1:32:42] okay so just remember Satan's desire is
[1:32:46] for your praise
[1:32:48] Satan's heart desire is to get you to
[1:32:50] praise him and not God because when he
[1:32:53] was kicked out of heaven what did he do
[1:32:56] he was the song leader
[1:32:59] so all he wants you to do is praise me
[1:33:01] get away from God so he wants to steal
[1:33:04] your praise and then when you start
[1:33:06] praising him and things go up and down
[1:33:07] because you don't stay in your word
[1:33:08] you're all just in music and all this
[1:33:10] lovely stuff and you don't you don't get
[1:33:12] some vitamins in you then you start
[1:33:14] losing your joy because you feel you
[1:33:16] keep failing you keep failing you can't
[1:33:18] overcome and it becomes harder because
[1:33:20] why you lost your joy because you're not
[1:33:23] in the word you're not in connection
[1:33:25] with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:26] amen
[1:33:28] he says but Jesus says because I love
[1:33:31] you
[1:33:31] live or die oh no so brother Branham
[1:33:34] says then I come to this church in
[1:33:36] legalism this morning legally
[1:33:39] now I want you to say brother Branham is
[1:33:41] tired in this sermon
[1:33:42] okay and he says
[1:33:45] I feel tired I've been nervous upset
[1:33:48] wondering about something before me my
[1:33:51] heart is burning even as my heart is
[1:33:53] fluttering I got a cramp a pain right
[1:33:55] this minute it's shooting back and forth
[1:33:58] whoopsie I did that right
[1:34:00] he says it's shooting back and forth up
[1:34:02] and down through here weak nervous
[1:34:04] trembling I can't hold it here my
[1:34:07] trembling catch a hold here and squeeze
[1:34:10] I got my toes squeezed up in my shoes
[1:34:12] he's nervous he's in a place where he's
[1:34:14] just worn out
[1:34:17] are you worn out
[1:34:20] this man is worn out he's standing in
[1:34:22] front of how many people say I'm tired
[1:34:26] I'm nervous I'm a wreck
[1:34:28] he says but because I love God live or
[1:34:32] die I must stand here for him
[1:34:37] amen he says use of God because you love
[1:34:40] him not because you've got to do it
[1:34:42] because you love him
[1:34:44] and then I'll close with this the
[1:34:46] musicians come up because it's not a
[1:34:47] long service but I want to I want to
[1:34:49] close with this
[1:34:50] so brother Branham talks about his wife
[1:34:54] and he says I love my wife
[1:34:57] and even if I do something wrong and I
[1:35:00] go back to meet her and I say to her I'm
[1:35:03] very sorry
[1:35:04] she will forgive me
[1:35:06] no matter what I do
[1:35:09] because that love is a different type of
[1:35:11] love
[1:35:12] he says but because I love her I don't
[1:35:15] want to do it
[1:35:17] so I want you to tell you that you don't
[1:35:19] need to sin
[1:35:22] you don't need to sin to come back to
[1:35:24] the Lord so he reveals your son like
[1:35:26] David and he tells you I forgive you to
[1:35:28] come back to you don't need to go there
[1:35:30] you can overcome it all you have to do
[1:35:33] is your core thought When sin comes in
[1:35:35] is I love Jesus
[1:35:38] so when I walk and this is how my dad
[1:35:41] told it to me when you walk to a
[1:35:42] nightclub take Jesus with you because
[1:35:45] when you get to the door you go
[1:35:48] I love Jesus okay
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:53] when that that that
[1:35:55] Ricky you know that that guy that slick
[1:35:57] with the nice hair and a cool thing
[1:36:00] I love you
[1:36:02] you're special to me you know like
[1:36:05] you're my future wife and he Woos you
[1:36:11] be careful
[1:36:13] because remember is just wooing you but
[1:36:15] Let Jesus Christ
[1:36:17] sisters lead Jesus Christ with you
[1:36:21] because if he was a true man he would
[1:36:24] have gone to your dad first
[1:36:26] and he would have walked to your dad and
[1:36:28] say you know what I like your daughter
[1:36:30] may I have a chance to get to know her
[1:36:33] better but see a Slicker comes in the
[1:36:35] back door
[1:36:37] he always wants to do it the easy way
[1:36:40] and he always comes with wooing words
[1:36:43] but it's a slicker because he was if he
[1:36:46] was real serious about you like I went
[1:36:49] to my father-in-law and was the hardest
[1:36:51] discussion I had in my life man I got
[1:36:53] dragged over the coals thanks Dad
[1:36:55] because he wanted to know if I loved his
[1:36:57] daughter
[1:36:58] but see my Approach wasn't his daughter
[1:37:00] my Approach was his dad or her dad
[1:37:03] because I knew if I got the the consent
[1:37:05] of the dad and the blessing of the dad
[1:37:08] then I can go ahead with the
[1:37:09] relationship
[1:37:11] but if the dad said no if Jesus Christ
[1:37:14] says that's not the one for you be
[1:37:16] careful yeah be careful
[1:37:19] you young men before you go to any young
[1:37:22] lady
[1:37:23] don't know why I'm saying this but I'm
[1:37:25] just gonna say it you'll be able to pray
[1:37:26] for your wife because even if y was the
[1:37:29] life of David
[1:37:31] it was one thing I did right
[1:37:33] I prayed for my wife
[1:37:35] I didn't even know God back then I knew
[1:37:38] of him but I didn't know God that's why
[1:37:40] I married my wife the second time
[1:37:42] because then I knew who's God and I knew
[1:37:45] what I made the promise to but the first
[1:37:46] time I didn't know
[1:37:49] but I did when I didn't know him go on
[1:37:52] my knees
[1:37:53] and I said a wonderful Lord Jesus
[1:37:55] I said these words I said and it kind of
[1:37:57] came back to me as well I said Lord I
[1:37:59] wanna I want a wife that can stand with
[1:38:02] me
[1:38:03] but she needs to be a bit stubborn as
[1:38:05] well
[1:38:07] I did I said look she needs to be
[1:38:11] stubborn because I'm a pushy man and I
[1:38:13] want things my way but I wanted to be my
[1:38:15] help mate I wanted to be my sounding
[1:38:17] board I wanted to when I'm when I'm
[1:38:20] wrong she tells me I'm wrong and I want
[1:38:22] a mother to my children I don't want to
[1:38:24] go that dates me for money or for my car
[1:38:27] or for my good looks
[1:38:30] oh what someone is serious about this
[1:38:36] so if David that day lucky the Lord had
[1:38:38] a plan plan with David and we know that
[1:38:40] the Plan of Redemption State still came
[1:38:42] through David and God had a plan for it
[1:38:44] but see God just David got ahead of
[1:38:47] himself
[1:38:48] don't get ahead of yourself wait on him
[1:38:51] your your first relationship is with God
[1:38:54] if it's with your mobile phone or
[1:38:56] Snapchats or messaging behind their
[1:38:59] backs and those type of things away with
[1:39:01] that stuff that's not how you get to
[1:39:03] know someone is through a message line
[1:39:05] or a date site doesn't work that way I'm
[1:39:08] against it as much as I can if you
[1:39:10] cannot talk to someone straight God
[1:39:13] talks to you straight
[1:39:14] you cannot talk to them face to face
[1:39:16] don't do these things behind their
[1:39:18] parents back stop that
[1:39:20] utter nonsense will not get you anywhere
[1:39:24] that's my service as you may do it wrong
[1:39:28] but the blood of Jesus Christ is coming
[1:39:30] then whenever you do this wrong
[1:39:32] I got you
[1:39:34] I just want you to come to me and say I
[1:39:37] was wrong
[1:39:38] I always tell my boys no matter what you
[1:39:41] do even if you ever kill someone never
[1:39:44] lie to me because even if you're 100
[1:39:47] wrong
[1:39:49] I will fight for you
[1:39:51] I will fight for you with everything in
[1:39:53] me even if I know you're wrong I will
[1:39:55] take your place and go sit in jail if I
[1:39:57] have to I don't care
[1:39:58] but never lie to me because if you lied
[1:40:01] to me
[1:40:02] I can't help you
[1:40:04] send a stone attributed to you and sin
[1:40:07] will always come out so if you keep it
[1:40:10] Satan has something against you at the
[1:40:12] day of judgment
[1:40:14] you need to put it under the blood and
[1:40:16] the only way to put sin under the blood
[1:40:19] is to confess it and move on don't dwell
[1:40:22] on it
[1:40:24] it's not your sin Satan tricked you okay
[1:40:27] but put it down
[1:40:29] it's under the blood
[1:40:31] and when you put something under the
[1:40:34] blood it's done it is finished it is
[1:40:37] finished that's why I said when he died
[1:40:39] for all sin he said it is finished
[1:40:41] you do not day pick it out of the blood
[1:40:43] it is done
[1:40:45] if my son said he was wrong and the
[1:40:47] judge came in and said what did he do I
[1:40:49] said Lord take me
[1:40:53] it was me
[1:40:55] I'll do anything for my son it was me
[1:40:58] how is the carnal man as a normal human
[1:41:00] being can I come and say I can stand
[1:41:02] like that for my son and the blood of
[1:41:03] Jesus Christ can't take your sin away
[1:41:07] why did he die for us
[1:41:10] so while we at this moment I want you to
[1:41:12] realize
[1:41:13] if you're busy living in sin if you're
[1:41:15] doing things that not of the Lord now
[1:41:18] lay it down
[1:41:20] now don't take it with you
[1:41:22] it's not yours you were tricked
[1:41:25] the day of judgment
[1:41:27] he will go back on the head of the
[1:41:29] accuser amen
[1:41:31] and we will look upon that that devil
[1:41:33] Satan we will look upon him
[1:41:36] and what will we say Church
[1:41:39] is that the man
[1:41:41] and through the whole world into sin
[1:41:43] this man
[1:41:44] because when you gave all you sent to
[1:41:46] him he can't point one finger back to
[1:41:49] you
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:52] so David forgot to do it right
[1:41:54] but you know what he repented and what
[1:41:57] happened
[1:41:58] Solomon came through him the Millennium
[1:42:00] Reign was a thousand years beautiful
[1:42:02] Millennium is coming
[1:42:04] give your sin to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:06] go in your rapture
[1:42:09] while everybody else is here going
[1:42:11] through the tribulation
[1:42:13] and it's going to be a rough tribulation
[1:42:15] I tell you now and you can see the
[1:42:16] writings on the wall you don't you don't
[1:42:18] need to be a Christian to know that this
[1:42:21] was falling apart but if you've given
[1:42:23] everything to the Lord and there's
[1:42:24] nothing left
[1:42:26] and he knows who you are you're ready
[1:42:28] for a Rapture because he will make you
[1:42:31] ready and take you up amen amen may the
[1:42:34] Lord bless this um brother Isaac if you
[1:42:36] maybe I'll just close in the word of
[1:42:38] Prayer
[1:42:39] and uh I just want you all to Bow your
[1:42:41] head
[1:42:42] just for a moment
[1:42:45] Lord Jesus every one of this brother and
[1:42:48] sisters you know my heart I love with
[1:42:50] all my heart Lord Jesus
[1:42:52] and just as a man when I look at their
[1:42:55] faces father I just see you I see your
[1:42:58] Plan of Redemption I see your grace on
[1:43:00] their life Lord
[1:43:02] it makes me happy to see these people
[1:43:05] here today Lord because they came to
[1:43:07] church they already won
[1:43:09] they could have been anyway but they
[1:43:11] chose to spend their time here with you
[1:43:13] my Lord and I asked today that this
[1:43:15] mixed up words and everything I said
[1:43:17] Lord that you would don't put the anger
[1:43:20] in it don't don't put the the Zeal in it
[1:43:23] that I have you know I Am Lord Jesus and
[1:43:25] I ask that you would just just help me
[1:43:27] as well Lord but I want you to put your
[1:43:29] love within this message
[1:43:31] and my everyone today that listen to
[1:43:33] this message Lord may you talk to them
[1:43:35] and Lord may they come before you now
[1:43:38] and I pray as well with them Lord and
[1:43:40] say Lord here I am
[1:43:43] oh Lord just take that coal of fire
[1:43:46] touch my lips Lord here I am cleanse me
[1:43:49] from all sin
[1:43:50] because Lord none of us have it all
[1:43:52] together but Lord we love you and I pray
[1:43:55] those that is weak and that's feeble and
[1:43:58] that lost the joy of their salvation I
[1:44:01] ask that you would just give it back to
[1:44:02] them in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:44:04] Christ
[1:44:05] father they that is down and out Lord or
[1:44:07] even them that's on the Mountaintop may
[1:44:09] they just grow closer to you now in the
[1:44:11] name of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray
[1:44:13] amen and amen
[1:44:16] amen

[1:45:46] will say unto God my rock why is thou
[1:45:48] forgotten me why go I mourning because
[1:45:50] of the oppression of the enemy as with a
