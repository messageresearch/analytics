[28:13] version so I would like us to read from
[28:16] from one
[28:18] version oh I've got two
[28:21] tablets okay I'll use this
[28:25] one so Hebrew
[28:28] chapter
[28:32] 8 we'll jump a few verses and go to the
[28:36] other verses just try to be as quick as
[28:39] possible Hebrews chapter 8 let's read
[28:42] verse
[28:45] one sorry I'm a little
[28:48] bit nervous because I haven't been here
[28:52] in a long time so just bear with me if
[28:55] you see that I'm
[28:58] the Bible says here verse one Hebrews
[29:02] chapter 8 now of the things which we
[29:06] have spoken this is the sum so basically
[29:10] what Paul is saying here this is the
[29:12] summation of the things that we' have
[29:13] been talking about if you read from
[29:15] verse chapter one of Hebrews and you
[29:17] just read go through with it go through
[29:19] with it you will hear and follow the
[29:22] thought process or the inspiration of
[29:25] Paul what he's trying to say God in s
[29:28] time spoke through the prophet you know
[29:30] you you'll follow he talking about the
[29:32] priesthood and the and and and the and
[29:35] the and the priest and the perfect
[29:37] sacrifice that's what the thought that
[29:39] Paul is talking about there that's the
[29:41] process so he says here in verse 8 the
[29:44] first part of that verse chapter 8 he
[29:47] says now this
[29:49] is which we have spoken this is the PS
[29:54] ah I don't know if I should say this is
[29:55] the climax this is the p the peak amen
[29:59] we have such an high priest who is set
[30:03] on the right hand of the Throne of the
[30:05] Majesty in the heavens Hallelujah then
[30:08] we will jump to verse same chapter verse
[30:11] 5
[30:12] to8 we serve unto the example and Shadow
[30:16] of heavenly things as Moses was
[30:20] admonished of God when he was about to
[30:22] make the Tabernacle for see saith he
[30:26] that th th make all things according to
[30:29] the pattern showeth to thee in the
[30:32] mountain in the mount but now had he
[30:36] obtained a more excellent Ministry by
[30:40] how much also he is the mediator of a
[30:44] better
[30:45] Covenant which was established
[30:49] upon upon better
[30:51] promises let's pray then I can let you
[30:54] see down Heavenly Father Lord you know
[30:58] that I'm incapable of ministering even
[31:02] to your children father and I'm the
[31:04] least to be to be chosen to stand here
[31:07] father but it's not about me this
[31:10] evening it's not even about my
[31:12] capabilities or my incapabilities it's
[31:16] not what I can do or what I can't do
[31:18] it's nothing to do with me Lord help me
[31:20] tonight to take that thought out of my
[31:23] mind and out of my heart and focus on
[31:26] you father just like I'm praying for the
[31:28] brothers and sisters to take the thought
[31:30] of brother Paul and who is standing in
[31:33] the front Lord and just come in the
[31:36] altar in the holy of holies with you
[31:38] tonight that will benefit us so much
[31:40] tonight if only we can find ourselves in
[31:43] your presence with all our mind our soul
[31:46] and our heart and our attitude just for
[31:49] just for a moment father that will do us
[31:51] a great benefit and I pray Lord that you
[31:54] forgive us our sins forgive us our
[31:56] iniquity Lord those things that we
[31:59] sometimes do them
[32:00] deliberately forgive us those ones
[32:02] father and and help us to to be better
[32:05] children next time to please you father
[32:08] to strive to seek to please you bless
[32:11] your people Lord I understand they're
[32:13] tired Lord and they've been doing things
[32:15] during the day we just want your
[32:17] intervention tonight just intervene Holy
[32:20] Spirit and just capture their hearts and
[32:23] their focus into your
[32:25] word that Lord you can get the glory and
[32:27] the honor take this time father we
[32:30] commit it to you come and speak the
[32:32] oracles come and change lives come and
[32:35] heal come and do as you please is our
[32:37] desire it will please us greatly as your
[32:40] bride tonight we ask these things
[32:43] thanking you Lord in the name of our
[32:45] Lord Jesus Christ and we all say amen
[32:47] amen we may take the Comforts of your
[32:50] our seats and um so let's finish up that
[32:54] part uh I want to finish uh
[32:58] verse up to verse
[33:00] 10 verse S now for in that first
[33:04] Covenant this is now the old time
[33:06] Covenant we are talking tonight about
[33:09] the New Covenant the New Covenant spoken
[33:12] in the book of Hebrews that's the
[33:14] Covenant that was made now by the Lord
[33:16] Jesus Christ for you and for me now he's
[33:19] referring here Paul for in that first
[33:22] Covenant has been for if sorry if if
[33:27] that first Covenant had been faultless
[33:30] then should no place have been sought
[33:33] for the second are we together if that
[33:36] that first Covenant of under the the
[33:40] blood of ghosts and sheep and whatever
[33:42] if that Covenant if that Covenant that
[33:45] was done that time was faultless there
[33:48] was no need then for a New Covenant
[33:51] that's what Paul is trying to say there
[33:53] uh verse eight for finding fault with
[33:55] with them he said behold the days come
[33:59] said the Lord when I will make a New
[34:03] Covenant with the house of Israel and
[34:06] with the house of Judah are you
[34:08] spiritual Israel
[34:10] tonight not according to the Covenant
[34:13] that I made with their fathers in the
[34:15] day that I look them in the day that I
[34:18] took them by the hand to lead them out
[34:20] of the land of Egypt not that
[34:23] one
[34:25] but because the they continued not in my
[34:29] Covenant and I regarded them not sayeth
[34:31] the Lord so the old covenant could not
[34:35] stand let's read verse 10 for this is
[34:37] the Covenant that I will make with the
[34:39] house of Israel after those days say the
[34:42] Lord I will put my laws into their mind
[34:47] and write them in their hearts and I
[34:50] will be to them a God yeah thank you
[34:54] Lord and they shall be to me
[34:57] a people amen hallu I believe it let's
[35:00] read the 10 and
[35:03] 12 11 and they shall not teach every man
[35:07] with his neighbor and every man his
[35:10] brother saying no know the Lord For All
[35:13] Shall know me for the least to the from
[35:16] the least to the greatest in other words
[35:19] he is going to do the job because he
[35:22] would have written his law in their
[35:24] hearts this reminds me of Ezekiel 26
[35:27] amen so now as I said brothers and
[35:30] sisters you can jump to the third to the
[35:32] third slide my brother I can do that
[35:36] sorry I can do that yeah in fact I like
[35:39] that PR thing like brother Tess this one
[35:44] so so we hear here brothers and sisters
[35:47] that there is a covenant and this
[35:49] Covenant is about
[35:51] us who understand what the Covenant
[35:55] is H
[35:57] a covenant is is sort of like an
[35:59] agreement it's it's a it's a it's called
[36:02] promises inside in in the worldly way we
[36:04] can say it's more like you can say like
[36:07] a you know you can maybe you say a will
[36:09] or say a contract or say an agreement of
[36:11] some sort you know you can have an
[36:13] agreement with someone and you you can
[36:16] have a legal contract that will bring
[36:18] the covenants that are highlighted in
[36:21] there that form the process of the
[36:23] Covenant right now the format and the
[36:26] pattern of the format I mean of the
[36:29] Covenant is designed by the parties that
[36:31] are involved in that Covenant the
[36:33] parties that are part and parcel of the
[36:34] Covenant amen I wrote here that it can
[36:38] take you know it must take both parties
[36:40] must be in agreement in a covenant there
[36:43] must be in agreement you know like a
[36:45] marriage covenant a marriage a marriage
[36:47] is like a covenant yeah I you know it's
[36:50] like a you know we we it's a love
[36:53] Covenant so now but but but but a
[36:59] covenant or a contract in the worldly in
[37:01] the Earthly way you know is time bound
[37:04] yeah it's got a time frame we know that
[37:06] our covenant is is is eternally bound
[37:09] got no time limits the time frame of our
[37:12] Eternal Covenant is eternal that's the
[37:14] time frame for for our one that you and
[37:17] me are under amen but I'm trying to give
[37:19] you a context of what actually the a
[37:22] covenant is and it is
[37:25] binding huh it is binding you don't have
[37:28] to say you can't say no no no I I don't
[37:31] want to do this or I will do this no no
[37:33] it has got the terms and conditions it
[37:36] has got um it is
[37:39] enforceable you you if you don't want to
[37:42] be bound by the Covenant or the contract
[37:45] the other party whom you are involved
[37:47] with can take you to court to enforce it
[37:51] because it's an agreement we have agreed
[37:54] that every Thursday l cost beans will
[37:57] collect the rubbish at the door of my
[38:01] house that's an agreement and we agreed
[38:04] that I will pay them every week so much
[38:07] yeah we agreed about the size of the bin
[38:11] from their end they look at those kind
[38:12] of conditions what size of the bean did
[38:15] I put today is it their Bean or not
[38:18] their Bean huh what did I put inside the
[38:21] beIN what time did they they come did
[38:23] they come this week now I look at those
[38:25] so we hold each other accountable that's
[38:28] a worldly or an Earthly agreement right
[38:32] so but with God there's a different
[38:34] Covenant it is a covenant but I'll show
[38:37] you now how it works and then also I
[38:40] wrote um you know it must give effect to
[38:43] something things must happen in in a
[38:45] covenant it cannot just be a silent
[38:47] agreement we love each other but nothing
[38:50] is a penny amen I never tell her that I
[38:53] love her I never take her out I never
[38:56] tell her she's beautiful she never tells
[38:58] me I'm strong so what kind of a covenant
[39:00] is that
[39:02] one huh oh boy is that is there a it's
[39:06] silent it cannot be silent our covenant
[39:09] with the Lord is not a silent one amen
[39:11] there are things that must take effect
[39:13] there there is things that I'll show you
[39:14] now that in that Covenant there are
[39:17] built in the Covenant there are the
[39:20] benefits of the Covenant you know when
[39:21] they give you when they give you a de of
[39:23] sale a contract of a land or a property
[39:26] they certain covenants that they write
[39:28] in there they call them covenants that
[39:30] you know there are certain boundaries
[39:32] and there certain agreements that you
[39:34] know you must allow people to pass
[39:36] through your plot if it's in the way
[39:37] that's part of the Covenant you can't
[39:39] one day come and say no even if the road
[39:42] is passing on my property no one can
[39:43] drive through no there's a covenant in
[39:45] the agreement of of sale that we must go
[39:49] through the baes yard and drive through
[39:51] there it's a public road but it's
[39:52] bailees yard you understand what I'm
[39:55] trying to say that's part of the
[39:56] Covenant so
[40:00] now um I want to read what I wrote here
[40:04] if you don't operate and live according
[40:06] to the spirit of the Covenant then you
[40:09] are in Bridge you are Bridging the
[40:12] Covenant don't be afraid I'm going to
[40:14] show you now that your part of the
[40:16] Covenant is very
[40:19] light that's that's how beautiful this
[40:22] our covenant that that we WR we write
[40:24] about here is the of this world is heavy
[40:28] we must be equal you do your part I do
[40:31] my part if you are taking the Lion Share
[40:34] of the covenantal prophets you do more
[40:38] that's building into the agreement you
[40:39] can't expect me to do more but but you
[40:43] are taking more
[40:44] profits and vice versa huh so it's heavy
[40:50] I hold you to the
[40:52] letter the Covenant although is
[40:55] unconditional our covenant is
[40:58] unconditional we have been given an
[41:00] unconditional
[41:02] Covenant it's not going to be based
[41:05] on he because he is I'm going to go
[41:08] ahead of myself because God his
[41:12] omnicient he he knows the end from the
[41:15] beginning he already saw you and knew
[41:17] you and buildt you accordingly so that
[41:19] when you are here on Earth no matter
[41:21] what the devil can do you are going to
[41:24] fulfill the conditions everything about
[41:27] the Covenant you are going to believe
[41:29] God you are going to do everything that
[41:31] he expect from you to do why because
[41:33] he'll give you a heart and a spirit to
[41:35] do that if the enemy makes you to reject
[41:38] you will do
[41:40] it because it's part of his Covenant
[41:42] this Covenant is not like the one of
[41:45] Moses and them that was faultless it was
[41:48] found wanting in other words it was not
[41:51] enough it was it was a negative of our
[41:54] covenant our Covenant is a superior
[41:58] better one it is the One That Forgives
[42:01] your sins and they remember no more with
[42:05] that one you part of that when you bring
[42:08] your sacrifice according to that
[42:10] Covenant you'll do it you'll bring the
[42:12] sacrifice every
[42:13] year right that's that was that was part
[42:16] and pzle of that Covenant every year and
[42:18] you'll inspect so even next you still
[42:21] remember I beat my wife she probably
[42:23] didn't forgive you but you said no no I
[42:25] took the sacrifice to the priest the the
[42:28] lamp was clean so do not remind me but
[42:31] with this Covenant you beat your wife
[42:33] you repent you you you repent we talk to
[42:36] you as the brothers God forgives you
[42:38] your wife remembers no
[42:40] more she forgives you completely and
[42:43] unconditionally I'm not saying Brothers
[42:45] must beat their wives I'm
[42:48] just or let's
[42:50] say let's say s the sister beat the
[42:55] brother let's say if your wife beats you
[42:58] and then she repents then you forgive
[43:00] you unconditionally after she slapped
[43:02] you she the brother forgives her with
[43:05] love
[43:06] unconditional actually this is the
[43:08] appropriate example how we offend the
[43:11] Lord Jesus Christ how we offend him and
[43:14] we repeatedly do it because of this guy
[43:18] the prophet saw a vision and every time
[43:22] one of us Sinn here on Earth you know he
[43:24] goes he goes like this almost like we
[43:26] are Rec crucifying him that's what
[43:29] that's what our sins do to him yeah but
[43:32] he still forgive you that's the pattern
[43:34] and the the type of a covenant which you
[43:37] are under it's no more an an a hand for
[43:40] a hand an eye for an eye it's no more
[43:43] under that kind of laws
[43:45] right so I wrote as well here that
[43:49] Covenant this Covenant cannot be amended
[43:52] it cannot be changed because God made it
[43:54] me and you cannot change it as and when
[43:57] we go along we can't we cannot as we
[44:00] feel this way or we feel that way or we
[44:03] think this way or no this Covenant it
[44:06] demands of us to love one another and
[44:09] there's our part and there's his part
[44:12] I'll show
[44:13] you that's why God doesn't want us to
[44:16] interfere with this Covenant rather to
[44:18] live according to it and the spirit of
[44:21] the Covenant and the provisions of the
[44:24] Covenant of the of this law of this word
[44:28] because God is eternal omnicient I I
[44:30] already spoke about that so he knew it
[44:32] from the beginning so I I've got this
[44:34] thing that I want to show you why God
[44:37] had that
[44:40] Covenant I'll show you this so I didn't
[44:44] have that notice board to lift up this
[44:47] thing like this I can ask one of the
[44:50] young people to who doesn't mind to hold
[44:53] it for you and then you can see see can
[44:56] you see nicely Dave I love you my
[45:00] brother
[45:03] so this is this is how they used to do
[45:07] agreements in the old Chinese you know
[45:09] way in the olden days and they used to
[45:12] have you know an agreement whether for
[45:15] you take your drling in or whether you
[45:17] take then we have an agreement and but
[45:19] the agreement is that when you when you
[45:20] come to fet whatever you want to fetch
[45:22] um you must bring the same receipt that
[45:24] corresponds with you so I want I want to
[45:27] show you that God and us are going to be
[45:31] the same God want me and you to be like
[45:34] exactly like him to fit because he made
[45:37] us to be Co equals so who can tell
[45:40] me where where will this this portion
[45:43] fit between these
[45:46] two why not the
[45:50] bottom but why are why are you judging
[45:52] why are you judging this one why why
[45:55] can't it be this one or maybe even this
[45:58] one how can it be this
[46:02] way this
[46:05] way how I feel like you are judging the
[46:08] other part why do you choose this
[46:11] [Music]
[46:13] one you're not judging it what I what
[46:17] what can someone tell me why are we
[46:18] choosing this one brother Andy
[46:21] [Laughter]
[46:24] predestination so so that's that's a
[46:28] powerful answer man brother in school he
[46:30] mustn't get 100 he must get 200% what
[46:34] but but what's another reason why why
[46:36] are we saying this one best is the best
[46:41] fit I feel like it can go here come on
[46:45] look look the line you see look look at
[46:47] this line look at this line can you see
[46:50] that why is it
[46:53] mag you
[46:54] don't
[46:57] so the Lord wants you to fit the way he
[47:01] saw you from the beginning from the Min
[47:04] that's how he wants to see you sorry
[47:06] from the beginning that's how he wants
[47:09] to see you that's how we say beginning
[47:11] in my
[47:15] house he wants you to come this is the
[47:18] Lord he wants to prepare you to reflect
[47:22] him so that you and him can you can fit
[47:26] exactly means to the the perfect Feit it
[47:30] means in my language to Feit exactly
[47:35] perfectly like no no no
[47:40] comma can you see that that's how the
[47:43] Lord wants you to feed and what is
[47:45] interesting about it is that I wanted to
[47:48] show you with the other one is that this
[47:51] one sorry
[47:53] Dave this one that I wanted to show you
[47:55] wanted to make a small and a big one
[47:57] because we are the smaller part but he
[47:59] wants to make us part of the bigger part
[48:02] he wants to make us part of the bigger
[48:03] hole but right now we are still in a
[48:05] smaller for format but he wants to make
[48:07] that teaspoon of the ocean in us to be
[48:10] exactly like what is in the ocean and
[48:13] the fit exactly when they test
[48:14] everything in there even the waves are
[48:17] in are in the spoon yeah you can't see
[48:19] them but they're
[48:21] there look at this one imagine if we say
[48:24] no no this one
[48:26] must must feed that's how the devil want
[48:28] us to be the devil wants to match us
[48:31] with him like this you know to force it
[48:35] and say no no this is upside this this
[48:37] must be like this you see he'll show you
[48:39] that you see this this pattern here it
[48:41] goes with this one that's the devil's
[48:44] Doctrine he show you and he will then
[48:46] give you a reasoning
[48:49] why this line is on the left you know
[48:51] when you write is on the left and then
[48:54] this is the top right right and he blind
[48:56] you not to
[48:58] see the
[49:01] because this is another seron for some
[49:03] another time you we need to be able to
[49:06] pray for the knowledge and understanding
[49:08] of the word of God to know ourselves to
[49:12] know our Lord that uhuh me our lord said
[49:16] is in A4
[49:20] format this is how our lord said a
[49:23] format it must be exactly the same no
[49:27] corners it must measure there there
[49:30] there this way you you telling the devil
[49:32] you the devil can't tell you that no
[49:34] it's 30 cm from that no no no no I my
[49:37] father in his weight how can you do that
[49:40] if you not eating the
[49:42] weight this and this and this is a
[49:45] perfect format how the Lord want this is
[49:47] exactly how God want us wants to see us
[49:51] to fit with him and his weight now thank
[49:54] you so much brother
[49:56] I love this brother if no one da just
[49:59] know that I
[50:02] love thanks man I challenge you okay
[50:06] Dave sorry let me not tell them all
[50:09] right so that is how the Lord want us to
[50:13] be there my part she's my life and
[50:16] there's the Lord okay I'm ripping up now
[50:21] God's covenant is a love
[50:24] Covenant is a love Covenant his
[50:26] components are his words his word
[50:28] sustains us his word is the one that
[50:31] gives us salv gives us salvation there's
[50:33] so many benefits the list is endless
[50:35] what I wrote there is is is just maybe a
[50:39] drop in this Covenant he promised us so
[50:41] many things he's going to fulfill them
[50:44] and he know he's going to fulfill them
[50:47] and there's another part of this
[50:49] Covenant which is my life our part of
[50:53] the Covenant must also be a love
[50:56] Covenant there's no way we are going to
[50:58] say that we love the Lord and you don't
[51:00] love my brother or you love my brother
[51:02] but you can't love the lord it's not
[51:04] going to fit in that it's not going to
[51:06] fit it's going to be a
[51:09] misfit and you completely surrendered
[51:13] Hearts eating his word on a daily basis
[51:16] praying brother Armand was preaching to
[51:18] us praying every day surrendering
[51:20] brother Tess was telling us so all these
[51:22] elements all these things are for for
[51:25] they form part and parcel of the great
[51:28] new better Covenant which you and me are
[51:32] under the question is are we playing by
[51:36] the spirit of the Covenant we are and we
[51:39] must keep on confessing believing Lord

[56:12] I weep then you
[56:15] know let me just stop come
[56:19] on Proverbs
[56:22] 3 lean not unto thy own understanding
[56:26] you see if we if we wanted understanding
[56:28] of a human being here all of us brother
[56:31] KU intellectual brother mishak
[56:34] intellectual brother fish intellectual
[56:36] Brother Andy topnotch intellectual if we
[56:39] could live with the understanding and
[56:43] bring it together here do you think we
[56:44] were going to
[56:46] agree and Sister Louise she's F don't
[56:49] look
[56:51] at imagine if all of us were going to be
[56:54] using each other's intellectualism and
[56:57] mind and understanding that's why he
[56:59] said no no lean not on that one amen
[57:02] lean on the my understanding the Holy
[57:04] Spirit lean on that one everything that
[57:06] we do we must lean on the understanding
[57:09] of the
[57:10] lord we must we must lean on his
[57:13] understanding otherwise our ideas our
[57:17] views my views will mislead
[57:20] you the views of the Lord and the Holy
[57:23] Spirit are the ones that are going to
[57:25] make us one Mind One voice when we speak
[57:29] that's why the prophet when he shot you
[57:31] know the Lord made him a prophet until
[57:32] when he shoots he was not happy it was
[57:35] like the world is finishing if you
[57:37] didn't shoot that bullet one hole 10 of
[57:39] them maybe one hole because the of what
[57:41] is
[57:43] accurate so let's finish by reading
[57:45] these two quotes and and we just go
[57:48] home God's church is to be run up by the
[57:52] baptism of the Holy Spirit then if we
[57:55] have this baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[57:57] the Holy Spirit is going to run the
[57:59] church then it doesn't take too much
[58:01] intellectual doesn't take education it
[58:04] takes the Holy Spirit that's God's
[58:06] program end of
[58:08] story amen now the church doesn't need a
[58:12] group of intellectuals the church needs
[58:14] the
[58:15] birth the church needs to be born again
