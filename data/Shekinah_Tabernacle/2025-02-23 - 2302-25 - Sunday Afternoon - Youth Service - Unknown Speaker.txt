deely father and exalt and uplift the the Believers dear heavly father dear Lord that we may all have a closer walk with thee dear Lord and dear Lord Jesus I pray that you'd really just be be our mly father thank you that you are our Lord in Jesus Christ I pray amen amen God bless you m amen you may all oh actually you may stay standing I would like to say that today has been the best day of my life so far amen because you know I'm a day grown in the Lord more and you know some of you may be thinking you know I like how brother David's so positive and by the grace of God I'm able to be a good example and that's the title for our sermon today is being a good example amen so we can turn our Bibles to 2 Kings 9:30 and it says here and when so this is we're going to start off with a bad example of of who not to be like am mean this is um and it says and when Jo who was come to jezrael Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face I mean what absolute bad example amen you may have your seats and we see all the woman today also all painting their faces and we can see her there there she is with all of her her crap and brother brandham says brother brm says here says so you know there is only one woman in the Bible that ever painted her face and she never painted her face to meet God she painted her face to meet a man that's right you knew what God did for her fed her to the dogs you see a woman wearing paint you can just say good morning Miss dog me that's exactly what it is that's awful Isn't it but that's what God thinks about it she has just made common dog meat for wild dogs that's about what she is amen and that's what the Lord thinks about a bad example amen and we have another one we see here in Exodus 148 and the Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of Egypt amen and he pursued after the children of Israel amen and we know that it wasn't just Pharaoh running after these people it was all of the dudes who were with him amen and we go down to verse 27 and Moses stretched Force's hand over the sea and the Sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptians fled against it and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the Sea and the waters returned and covered the Chariots all of those people who followed followed pharaoh who were following his bad example all died and the horsemen and all the hosts of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remain not so much as one of them amen so that's what happens when you follow the these bad examples and here's another bad example this is a numbers 16:32 and the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that have tamed unto Kora and all their gods that was cor and Dayan amen and we know that they were complaining to Moses complaining that he only had access to God and all these other things and then the Lord and they they were actually a bad example if we can go up to here we can notice he swallowed them up and the houses and all the men that abtained unto unto them so it wasn't just them it was also some other people and but here brother brandham we have some some examples brother bham gives us some good examples of what to be like amen and you know Christ is the example that we must follow Amen brother B says here it's proved God is visiting the people today God is in his church trying to purge the thing take out the leav out of it he's sending Messengers signs and wonders and miracles and everything trying to prove that he loves them and that he wants them to clean up get get rid of this here all this carrying on staying home on Wednesday night for permitting to look at this old silly stuff of an old woman from Hollywood married four or five different times some guys that's run with half the woman on the west coast who loves Lucy and all these things like that and you Christian people stay home to stay away from the house of God it chose what kind of a spirit is in you amen I've got it at home from the FBI Falls any Minister can get it there wants to if you only know the filth and the things that them people that you make your examples dress like them I mean he speaking dressing like dressing like these evil people dress like them act like them talk like them brother read your Bible amen talk like a Christian act like a Christian amen be like a Christian live like a Christian what we need today amen and I believe I'm looking at all of those people who do that amen such a blessing and we have another one and brother bam says you see a man humble loving good to his neighbors and a good citizen this is this is who we need to be like a good man good fellow and a good man and a Christian man full of love and humility you watch that man see that's right he's good charitable longsuffering you can talk about him that's uh all right he forgives you amen it don't make any difference to him there that's the real man keep your eye on him see that he Bears he's an example amen some of you may say brother who is that man what there he is right there amen good example praise God Amen and I have some more good example stories I mean I I I was once I went with um an Milan I stayed with arnard and Marion and I was staying in Arn's bedroom with him and he would always before he went to bed he would always pray and read his Bible and so from then on whenever I went home I would always also pray and read my Bible so brother ared was a very good influence on me amen I have another one here so this fellow has on a nice waterproof jacket and it's very cold there amen you know I was I was going to go hunting with Ben Bailey and Ben Bailey he he he doesn't do too much hunting so he hasn't got a whole lot of not as much gear as I do but I was sort of in the shed and he was getting together his the few things that he's got and I heard him saying to Sister Maggie sister Maggie um where's my waterproof jacket like David's one I me so I was a good example to him because when you go into the bush without a waterproof jacket it was raining you can get very cold and yeah so I like that amen and then now I'm going to move on to some bad examples am me we'll like these bad examples cuz they show us what not to do but here we see this dog chasing all of these deer I mean and I I used to have a dog and I had a pig dog and that was the um the one thing that they well one of the few things that they're not supposed to do was Chase deer and anyways I had this one dog and he would go chase these deer and I had another dog who he didn't really Chase deer but because my dog always chased deer this other dog also started chasing deer and together they disappeared chasing deer so they it was very bad so the one dog influenced the other and it was a turned to a title disaster so that dog was a bad example upon my other dog here we have another one amen um I I have a BB gun and I was driving up to the Oakland Convention with brother Mion and brother Kiri and um brother K is so cool he always gets all these cool stuff like he's got all his phones and all the stuff I was like brother K you know you should get a um a BB gun man things are fun brother car went and brought himself one and I saw him a while later at the um Pizza Factory and sister Robin was with us and I was at the table with them talking brother K was like oh you know I was using my baby gun and I dropped it and it broke and I was like ah you know this thing's happen Carrie you should buy yourself a a bigger one one that's more powerful and since Robin said no David he'll have no more toes but but I'm sure is very he's probably pretty safe with his gun but anyways and we have another one amen see these fellows you know what's embarrassing about these fellows is they're in the undes amen what an embarrassment and you know it's very in the pig hunting culture especially amongst all the worldly fellows a lot of those fellows wear little tiny shorts all year round and if they do it all year round they're so tough but they're not their little sissies but anyways I was I was very easily influenced by the bad example and I thought wearing little tiny shorts is cool so I also tried to wear little tiny shorts but as see and they were a very bad example upon me but it's an absolute disgrace amen we have another one here oh this person's falling off his dirt bike um I i' I've got a 450 dirt bike and little Abraham he like oh you know David I'd i' I'd like to ride your dirt bike and if he could he'd have to I'd have to hold and he'd step on it and he got very good at it and he could even do it by himself like because it's so high up his legs are so far off the ground and um he'd go over to like a where he could like a a ledge and step on the bike and then ride it and um brother Malachi and brother liham came over and they saw him riding my dirt bike and it was a um a coalition between me and Abes were a little bit bad examples on them because and so I was like you know Malachi and Liam would you like to ride my 450 dirt bike and of course the little dude sing ay going fast yes David please and so I took them we went to the paddock had to hold the dirt bike for brother Malachi to step on and brother Malachi fell off and almost got his leg crushed and then it was brother Lamb's turn and he fell off twice and he said David whenever I fall off I just throw myself away from the bike so it doesn't crush me I mean so we could have seen how they could have become a little bit hurt I mean now we have another one look at this fell is not reading his phone you know it can be very common amongst traies especially it's you know some sort of the bosses they don't never answer their phones so you go to call them at like night time and their phone is dead or something and you know that is very bad cuz we should always answer our phone it's you know it's always good to keep in contact and stuff and but these people never answer their phone I was like man I think it's cool for um I think I'll start not answering my phone either and thank goodness I brother andw who told me no David don't do that you need to answer your phone so here we have a bad example amen and last of all we have these fellows amen these are bad YouTube famous people trying to say how to get rich and rip people off this fellow on the left his one of his great po Sayes is whenever he buys a big he buys massive apartment he's a billionaire in the states and he says whenever first thing he does when he buys a big apartment building is he puts all the rent up heaps so and he's said B and then we have another one this fellow here he um he he scams a lot of people and so those are bad examples of of who to try to be like amen but you know I I trust I trust we can we can will be like look up to these good examples amen that the Lord has has given unto us and they're such a blessing amen and amen we're surrounded by them here amen amen so for could to have the musicians up that was that was my sermon for today but I trust that you are all truly blessed thank you amen and you know if there's any among of any of us among here that want to be a good example and then we're just going to say we're going to close service in prayer but if you just want to raise your hand to the Lord Lord and you know ask Lord but you also need to do it yourself you know the Lord gives us the strength to do it and we must go be a good example and we we can we just need to make the right choices amen so just going to close our eyes dear heavenly father dear Lord I pray that dear Lord you dear Lord you've given us the strength and the grace to be good examples dear Lord but dear Lord may we just really just be blessed in that and dear heavly father may you just really come on the scene dearly father but dear Lord we know that you are stronger than the enemy oh Lord and dear Lord that we are more than Overcomers that we are more than capable of being a good example oh Lord dear

M um so my little sermon is going to be a little different I'm going to talk about my testimony I'm just going to share a bit of my testimony uh could we open our Bibles to Revelations 1211 say I when you're there all right Revelations 1211 says just a short scripture and this it says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death I mean you can have your seats so as we all know sharing your testimony is very important and I haven't done that yet so I thought this will be my opportunity um just a quick quote brother brandom says here says all right I can see her she was so happy she wanted to tell somebody else about it trouble of it is the people get saved today and they think well maybe I better keep still my neighbor don't believe in this uh-uh no you never really got saved I don't believe no sir you can't hold it that's right say so I I'm afraid to testify of healing afraid that the doctor won't like it but brother you if you got healed you'll testify about it don't hold it tell it that's right tell that out to somebody else you overcome by the blood of the lamb and your testimony that's how you overcome I believe that let me grab my notes out real quick okay so starting from the start I grew up with my parents brother Ed and sister Lundy very good parents probably the best out there just saying um but growing up Mom and Dad were a little different um as they say I felt the stress they were going through and I was a bit of a different baby not normal um but yeah just growing up Dad had a bit of uh he got angry very quickly bit anger issues and Mom don't remember much because she always just said wait for Dad to get home but I wanted but yo so at the start mom and dad I remember a little bit we went to afrian church just over the railways there and paru and all I remember is my friends and that from there I was actually talking to Mom about it the other day um I think it was brother um yaku he was one of the guys there in the church and we they started talking about I think it was baptism and he went to I think the higher guys in the church because it was like a Dutch reformed like the three mother churches or sister churches kind of mixed together and he went to talk to them and started talking to them about how they read their Bible and all of this and basically they told him that he's reading his Bible wrong and all this kind of stuff and they should stop and uh and then they said he's basically not welcome in the church anymore so then they moved we started doing um Friday night um Bible studies and I remember watching The Three Little Pigs every night we went there um as a as a young kid I can't remember how old I was but then brother Neil which was in the church as well went and he started his own church there I can't remember the place's name but he started a church up there and I think that's where they Rehabilitation for guys with drugs and addictions alcohol all that stuff and brother villum which his wife used to always cut out here so he was I grew up with him and he worked there so they used um their Hall and stuff for church and I remember being friends with brother Neil's daughter and then that church didn't actually last very long end up moving to Oakland and things like that skipping forward a little bit um I remember the first time we walk into sh Tabernacle buckets everywhere as a kid and then what I remember is wanting to go to the bathroom and I had to go all the way back to the of the of the warehouse climb over things and around this corner and that one having to walk a minute to get to the bathroom which wasn't fun um and yeah then obviously the day we were so I grew up with the Davidson family those of you that know them majority of you do um so that is a very old photo but we have Caleb Keegan me Declan and then jonan Eli so me Dean and Keegan with the Three Amigos we about I'm 2 months from apart from Dean and Keegan's 2 months younger than me so I was always the one out just it was always Dean and Keegan teaming up on me and then I was a younger guy um but yeah I remember them being in church and then we we moved over to downstairs on our old building and I remember there that's when I a few late years on um they ended up moving out of the church because they didn't believe anymore brother Brandon and at that time because I was small I didn't really understand uh why or you know the reason behind that they left um once I Grew Older I started asking more questions about it and kind of got the story but it was hard for me because they I mean me and Jesse me well me Keegan and Dean would always wrestle Jesse I remember that one time Jesse actually won all three of all three of us so kudos to Jesse for that one it won't work anymore [Laughter] um but yeah and then they left and then Jesse became too cool to hang out with me that was just a stage it's all right he's all good now um but then I became a bit of a loner and I kind of had to you know make my own friends and eventually it was actually good timing the enanas arrived and I hated k at the start it was me and me and mo where's Mo oh right there yeah me and mo were friends I remember the first time I met them we just come back from a camping trip in tonaki and they run down they're like oh are you Josh are you Josh I'm like yes he's like do you have your guitar I heard you play guitar you're like the guitarist of the church and I'm like who are these guys I have never met them running down know my name know I play guitar it just like and I just arrived there like we went from tanaki straight there for the watch Night Service and there we immediately clicked and it was my two musical buddies and then eventually I moved on from Mo um still mates bro and then K became my best friend and to this day he stands by me um but yeah just I think it was either what year did you guys come 2019 yes so it was the year before 2018 I turned 10 and that's when I started thinking about getting baptized and I saw the change in my dad and my mom and I think that's what made me start thinking about it cuz I saw the difference from their baptism I saw the difference in their life the way dad started softening and he didn't get so angry very that quickly anymore and we started fellow fellowshipping a lot around the word and I started having thinking things and and all that you know and I got to understand a lot more um yeah let me just getting baptized oh yes I remember the one time it was me and Dad I think it was me a it was our family driving on the car and I was just looking outside it was on the way back from uh Wednesday night service I was like hold on Dad we're like the moon I was like correct me if I'm wrong we're like the moon and God's the Sun and we he his light reflects through us and it's his life it's his light that comes through us that we reflect the Life of Christ and he's like yes yes you're right and I was like oh Revelation nobody else knows about this I was like yes I was like oh I got to tell brother Ben and then I never did and later on well not too long after I found now he has talking talked about that so many times and I've just missed it that was a bit I was a bit gutted about that but you know that's all right anyway I don't have any photos unfortunately but I ended up getting baptized and from their life started changed you know started changing and I started thinking a lot more spiritually and um that's one thing that me and Dad have in common we like to see the spiritual things and the natural so that I really enjoy that part of it as well being able to you know just go out into nature when you're hunting you're listening to the birds you know maybe just going for a and you just see God and nature you know it's so cool um moving on um we there was a one one time me dad had to drive ourselves to church and I always loved the windy roads like the a aara road and Battle Hill Road I always wanted to drive it J extremely disliked it because he's got classic very easily so then I was oh it's me and Dad let's so we decided I think it was aara road that we drove Battle Hill Battle Hill and now on the last corner there's there's one point where if if those of you that have driven there there's one big drop going fur further in past past going over the part of the ocean and going down then there's a big drop on your left and on the right there's the bank and we come around this one corner and a toota pru that one um came around the corner at a very high speed and merely missed our car and as that I don't have the lyrics um on the slideshow but as that happened the lyrics of uh Casting Crown song One Awkward Moment play and it said one Awkward Moment you'll see the gospel come alive and it was like perfect timing the car passed and we like what happened and those lyrics come pass and I just started crying man I was just like wow this is so cool and I got to church and I immediately just told all my friends like just man this has happened and this all this lyrics played and you know I've always been a musical fellow um so for me that was quite big um and yeah what I missed as well is at the start my for the first two years of my life my granddad and my grandma lived here on my mom's side um and from there that's where I picked up the guitar and when I was six I think it was I went to go get guitar lessons but they said I'm too young so then uh I started learning ukulele instead and then as soon the next year as soon as I could I went and did guitar lessons immediately moved up a level because brother John Davidson who was song leader lead our church with brother Isaac at the time um was yeah playing he was playing guitar and I always because I grew up with him Dean was his son I always got to you I was always playing his guitar I was always learning you know and then I started in the band at 8 years old I remember that and the first time I song Lead was when I was 10 so that's back in 2018 and I felt like it was a flop I was like never again in my life like song Lead and then later on a few years later brother Ben came to me and started talking to me and said I should song Lead and I was I'll pray about it about it in my head I was like you're nut like no there's no way and then eventually a few months passed and brother Ben asked me a few more times and I realized okay he hasn't not only asked me once but a few times so I was like okay I'll I'll try and then that first one then it was just the atmosphere was so nice like it was like the first time was at Icebreaker and from then I started song leading a lot and now I song Le I've been song leading for I think two years two years now um but yeah it was just yeah that's basically my testimony um but what I want I wanted to share quick thing as well um just raging camp that passed too um we had a youth like a youth night on Friday night we got to talk about it but those of you that didn't go go next year please it's like it's so good the the unity this year and the last year the first time we went the unity between everyone was just we were all so close it was like we were family and I've seen you before I haven't but it's like I knew you but what's your name again was like it it literally felt like I knew them from somewhere I can't remember where but I know that back before I was born in God's mind we were all there and it was yeah it was just amazing the testimonies that came from that camp as well um you heard Hannah's one about Tamar as well that was really cool to see see her there and then um a few people that um found their purpose their position in Christ a lot of people that were struggling with things for years months um and the Lord answer them and the way that and um there was one particular sister that that couldn't make it to the camp it was impossible for her to come and she prayed and we prayed through with her and she was there and that was so cool to see as well and just big testimonies that came from it and I want to encourage all of you to go and my prayer has been to keep that Revival fire going all the way October Camp then we start as brother Ben and and some other brothers have said you start on the plus 10 you come out on the plus 100 110 and then you keep building building and then the next Camp you're there back on 200 and you know just keep building and that's my prayer that we just that Revival fire keep going and then Wednesday night was amazing it was just confirmation once again that God's still here and he's still talking to us that's my sermon let's just stand afternoon I just want to um yeah encourage you all as well share your testimony with your friends or you younger ones as well don't don't get embarrassed about your testimony because you just need to plant that little seed and may they may push you off to push it off to the side and laugh at you but if you just plant that little seed and they predestinated you'll you never know let's just bow our heads and close in a word of prayer thank you Lord that you were with us this evening Lord Jesus and Lord that you just help me Lord Jesus to share my testimony Lord and Lord I pray that and that you just encourage the rest of the people here Lord Jesus to share their testimony as well Lord
