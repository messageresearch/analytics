well amen well praise the lord if it starts clipping you just wave out okay amen hallelujah well glory to god it's good to be here tonight and i've um you know we're having a good time and i really enjoyed those songs thanks brother ed and i trust everybody here is ready to just draw from the lord and you will have your needs met tonight i believe amen who's come tonight to have their needs met by the lord amen amen who's expecting from the lord tonight hey man i just i trust that you know we're not here to entertain or we're not here to watch a show even though it might look like a show [Laughter] with the way that i carry on sometimes but i i promise myself i'll be good amen but we just want to yield to the lord and let him have his way amen um i'm excited tonight about the the burden of the word of the lord that he's placed upon our heart and i believe that we're in a a very critical hour we're in a very special hour this is an hour if you can imagine that all these thousands of years of god building up this this moment in time where time will blend with eternity and his bride will be home with him finally and that union you think oh man i've been longing for this for 40 years 20 years 10 years whatever 50. but how long has god been longing for this time of union and i think you know the heart of god the more closer we get to god in this hour the more we'll feel the very heart of god in these matters and i believe it's very important of vital importance for our spiritual health tonight and forevermore in our walk here on this earth to draw close to him draw nigh unto god and he will draw nigh unto you and and so make moves towards him amen amen hallelujah well i won't go too far down that that track we'll um we'll just come back to the word and i just trusted we could turn to john chapter 14 tonight and luke 17. amen two very familiar scriptures for us um but we'll just bring these through to our remembrance and even the subject tonight um to title the burden of of my heart and i believe the burden of of of the spirit of god tonight is how to release your victory amen who who who wants their victory to be completely released amen hallelujah no blockages no hindrances amen self deleted out of the equation so that your victory can can just manifest forth the glory of god and and and bring us we can go into a rapture together amen hallelujah amen let's just read from john chapter 14 verses 19 and 20 and and he says here jesus saying he says to his disciples yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also and at that day you shall know that i am in my father you and me and i and you amen who loves that this evening amen that you shall know that jesus is in the father and you're we're in him and he's in us so you can't get any more one with god then than this amen hallelujah and when you know that you realize man i'm really part of god's eternal plan and i'm just part of him i'm part of his family hello family of god amen who's glad to be part of the family of god who's glad to have god's holy ghost flowing through their veins hallelujah and luke 17 amen verses 20 and 21 it says here and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god shall come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say low here or low there but for behold the kingdom of god is within you amen let's pray father i just pray lord that you would take these words and lord i just want to humble myself under your mighty hand and i just pray father that you would just would express your heart tonight father i i pray lord that you would just have your way in this place and have your way go down into every room i asked father for a visitation of the pillar of fire right here lord to cause the word to come forth and and lord i pray father you send the angel of the lord into every room and every home lord to deliver to heal to restore to to lord bring skill and understanding in these matters by angelic visitation sent forth to the ears of salvation i believe i'm standing and looking at ears of salvation tonight and i believe that we know that that we are ears of salvation therefore there is angels in our rooms there's angels in our living rooms tonight to to help us to to minister to us lord and i pray lord for that visitation to be real and i pray that you would take these words and and anoint this time together lord that we could truly see breakthrough and and we could fully receive from you lord tonight have your way lord anoint speaker and hearer and lord i just pray that every hindering spirit of distraction or any busyness of life or anything lord i bind that in the name of jesus christ and i pray lord that you would just have our attention have our worship tonight and i pray lord that that we would take the fire and we would let it burn the burnable and we would take the shaking we'd take the wind and let it blow upon our garden let it blow upon our lives and and blow away the chaff lord and and let that which is glorified remain and let that which is of the kingdom of god that eternal part of us let that remain and let that be exalted tonight i pray lord that you would have your way in this place and and just lord committed into your hands in jesus name amen amen god bless you if you are standing you can be seated hallelujah amen i want to speak tonight about releasing how to release your victory or to shorten that release your victory amen hallelujah and i and i say that in in that way because ultimately it's your choice ultimately you are the the master of your own will and what you decide is the very uh absolute of what happens in your life in your victory amen as you are the ultimate decider and if you decide to let god be god and do what god only can do amen in your life he will raise up he will begin to shine within you and begin to release the victory in your life amen and i want to tell this story i want to take you through the story of david and the story of his ascent to the throne and how he was hindered by saul amen but i want you to realize that the kingdom of god we can read these old testament stories we can we can go through them and look at how wonderful it is and we can type it with the church we can type it with the age we can type it with the dispensation we can type it with the church we can type it with all these things but tonight we're going to type it with you amen and you the kingdom of god is within you amen so all of the story and everything you hear let's just encapsulate it and put it right down inside your heart because that's where it is and that's where the battle is the battle is inside you and there is a great battle going on tonight for your victory amen there is an old nature in you that wants to rise up it wants to cause trouble it will come into coalitions with the devil it's against everything that is of god but you see there is also a good seed within you there is a white dog within you and if you feed that dog and you worship god and you walk in that place of god and you're planted by the rivers of living water you see that one's going to rise up and so i want to show you here a parallel in these stories between david and saul and i don't want you to externalize that i don't even want you to put that in for anyone that you are burdened for because yes we're all burdened for people we're burdened for brethren in our church we're burdened for a family we're burdened for the lost but today i want you to be burdened for you not for other people even though it's good intentions you want everyone to be healed and you want them to be delivered you want them to be free but tonight there's enough for them and there's enough for you amen so let's not put it away to anybody else let's own this there is fire for you tonight fire to burn the dross amen there is god is here for you tonight to change things cataclysmically who knows what cataclysmic means amen hallelujah who wants cataclysmic change hallelujah amen well just let god do something in your life amen don't look at me look past me amen look at jesus because jesus is the one and he's somehow for some reason he chose man to preach the gospel and so here we are but let's not worry about the man part let's just worry about your fellowship with god tonight amen hallelujah wave if you're with me amen give me an amen of you can say amen hallelujah amen glory to god amen so you know this promised land is i want to just take this promised land tonight and and encapsulate that into our life and you know when you received the baptism of the holy ghost and the new birth and you died to yourself and you were born again and you think my you know it's going to be i'm i've arrived and in one sense you have arrived because the spirit of adoption has come down into your life and he's beginner work but then as things start to unfold in your life you realize wow there's actually a journey ahead and it's all planned by god and he's got a purpose and it's not going to be easy it's not going to be a walk in the park as they say it's going to be a challenge it's going to be a race that says in the bible in hebrews chapter 12. it says there's a race set before us and that race is a war a battle and it's been predestined and so when you submit to god he will lead you down that path and it's all for your good amen and because he knows and i'll read a quote in a second here that when you get the holy ghost and you are born again hallelujah when you've died to yourself and you've come god's provided way amen and we know that provided way you know you reject the world you get out of those things and you turn away from it you repent and you take the name of jesus christ in baptism showing that you are identified and you believe in the death burial and resurrection of our savior and that becomes personal when your faith reaches up and he receives it and he sends down the seal to circumcise your heart and begin to work you've come into the promised land the kingdom of god within you is inside you and now that kingdom of god has begun to such something's going to change because there's a new there's something burst within you and it's begin to a journey and it's not an easy journey but it's a journey he says that he which begun a good work in you amen shall continue it until the day of jesus christ hallelujah so what our lord starts within us he will continue it and there will be seasons where you think man this is barren yes there were deserts in the land did you know that the deserts in the promised land so you will have deserts there's times of desert there's times but it's a testing time it's a time to see what is really inside me and when that time comes you will see that there is a god inside you that can do miracles that can change you that can take you further just trust in him who will not leave you he will never let you go amen oh i like that trust in him who will not leave you amen hallelujah so you see when the holy ghost comes into your heart into the kingdom there is a king and he's come down but you see as the prophet says and i'll read this quote because you see it starts off in a seed form it starts off in a small form and he begins to push out he begins to push forth he begins to change things and and rearrange the house and and begin to do things that was never done before in your life and and it hurts there's valleys there's mountains there's times of trouble there's times of victory there's times of great celebration and then there's times of great heaviness and great trial but it's all part of the plan hallelujah amen but yet a seed has been sown in your life the seed of the holy ghost the seed of the word the seed of who you really are the seed of your new nature the seed of the real you the part of god that was that you know it says in the start scripture in that day you shall know and i'm talking about this day this is the day it's being given to you and i just want you to receive this tonight that in this day you hello everybody you shall know that i am in the father and the father and you're in me who am i that's just enough in that wow but then he says i'm in you hallelujah so look what comes down into you into the kingdom and it's the real you it's the real nature it's your new nature it's the it's that white dove we call it amen that one in you i'm gonna type as david amen and i want to show you that in the promised land the seed of david we're going to start it at rahab and salmon amen we're going to start that when when the mighty angel came down and he released the mystery on how to set rahab free to free her from babylonian bondage and prostitution and all those things and that seventh seal revelation came and the people caught it and they acted upon faith they acted upon the word of the message of the hour and they begin to see a pride set free and what did that bring and i'm talking about you now what did that bring when you received it what did that bring that brought you further along in your walk it began to unfold an identity of who you are hallelujah you're not just a normal just a church-goer or joining a part of god's plan you're part of god's kingdom hallelujah that's right and so you see now from that union because here comes this this rahab got set free and she married the captain of the host of israel and they their their seed lineage was the seed of david you see now that seed of david was just begin and it was just starting to work work its way through and i've written here if you can if i can just have your attention now that we've established exactly where we're going it says here it says your victory started in seed form when you were born again like the seed of david coming through the land from salmon and rahab now you thinking you look at that and you see how the devil tried everything he can to break that seed and to do man they went through some real hard times they went through some dark times and they but it came through amen who's glad it came through god always prevails amen and you might be in a situation tonight and all that's been going on maybe a good portion of your life even and you think oh my it's just going darker and darker but just remember god prevails amen remember that seed inside you is greater than all your circumstances greater than all the darkness all the pouring out of death and hell on the earth there is a seed in you that's greater and there's a promise hanging over you amen this says that he which begun the work shall continue it unto the day of jesus christ you will not have to you don't have to worry now don't you be afraid amen for joy comes in the morning amen joy in the morning a day that sow and tears shall doubtless reap enjoy amen so you shall go through these things but remember there is a seed within you amen and so i just continue this now the the seed of david coming through the land from salmon and rahab now place the kingdom within you to see now what is happening inside us as people as individuals the spirit of god has come in to us without anything held back now it's not an age of reformation it's not even it's not an age where we're destined for the church to go down again this is an age where the spirit of god shall take us home the spirit of god shall take us out of here that we shall come to the fullness of adoption to the point now the victory that gets released in you is a victory that causes you to never die amen do you realize that this is such a tremendous victory because this victory is a victory of rapture it's it's a victory that overcomes death itself now i want you to show i want to show you who's appearing in you now remember we're typing this as david it's that seed that has gone through your life and you've been through many things and i want to ask you this question soon where are you where are you you know where are you in your walk where are you in the kingdom where are you you know you need to find out where you're at it's very important it's a big question lord where am i where are we where are we at lord amen we know where it's all happening and the time is unfolding and as time unfolds god unfolds the mystery of his will he unfolds the prophecies that are ordained for each time and generation are you wisdom are you there are you dragging back are you pulling back are you still stuck in some part of your life you're where your journey's at just remember if you pull back your journey it just stays there but remember there's grace there is grace to take you further on amen there's grace to take you into the very plan of god again amen we will have times where we begin to pull back or we get distracted and we get thrown off but there is grace tonight and i want you to know that if you're in a place of darkness or you may be in a place where you feel like oh i just can't go back you can come back tonight tonight while you're hearing this even now it's not a time thing now you can enter in and come back hallelujah right into fellowship right where he's at amen amen amen this is the appearing now we know that in the prophet's ministry the son of man you know the the prophetic revelation of god was was manifested in the prophet's ministry and in all the discernment of hearts and the and the mighty works that were done within them but you see now that same appearing has to be released in a people hallelujah and so the message came and the word came just like it came to the captain and when they obeyed the word and the army of the lord got in behind the word they got under the word amen and they began to obey it it began to set the rahabs free it began to set the bride free it began to show people i'm not no prostitute in babylon no stuck behind all these old false religions i'm part of the bride hallelujah i can be set free amen hallelujah now this is the appearing of the son of man firstly in a prophet's ministry in the message as it was given but that word was released like it was to rahab to set us free and appear in our lives so that seed that life that journey of the seed of david that seed that we receive when we get born again that light within us amen that new nature that is the very essence of the appearing of the son of man in your life in my life in our lives and it begins to dawn like a day it says into peter that there will come a time and he was looking ahead to an age which you are in right now in your living room in your bedroom this is the age of the dawning of the day star hallelujah who believes me do you believe me that the day the very son of man the very the love of god is dawning in the hearts of people hallelujah amen and you see that will just continue to grow as he appears but i want to talk about things in a minute here there are hint there is another nature inside of us and this nature is called a sticky nature this nature does not want this to happen amen and when this your true self and i'm gonna label them now david and saul so whenever i talk about david and whenever i talk about saul i'm talking about your old your new nature and your old nature i'm talking about christ in you the hope of glory and i'm talking about the old nature that wants to rise up and and and cause trouble in your life and it's and it's sticky with family traits and family spirits and and habits and complexes and all these things that you thought may have been gone in your life but then all of a sudden these things start appearing again and you go why am i going through this tonight i want to talk about that i want to talk about why but i want to show you how to to to to dethrone it amen you see saul had to be dethroned amen and david would not dethrone him so here is the whole the whole concept of this thought david rises up with meekness with assurance with vision and yet he would not put himself in that position our lord jesus inside of our life coupled with our true nature and who we really are part of him amen will not force himself upon the throne he will not go past your free will amen so you are the one that has to dethrone saul hallelujah sorry oh okay robin's telling me to turn the volume down so i will there we go they're better okay amen i want to read you a quote here the prophet says this now for instances when a man gets saved the light that comes into him is about like this little white button on my shirt that's when god comes into the inner part of a man now i've abbreviated this for time's sake because this was a lot he said in between here and what i'm about to read talking about the inner workings of a man but that's not our scope tonight but now he says here further down now on the outside gates of a man this is five senses that enters to his body on the inside which is his soul the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside of his heart produces his soul which makes the atmosphere around him he has also five entrances or gates or channels then on the inside he has only one gate one entrance to go into the shekinah glory where god can enter into him and take over in the control tower and that way is through self-will whether you will to or not that's up to you but that's the only avenue that's open to the man that god can come into his heart is by self-will puts him right back like adam and eve on free moral agency again you can choose right or wrong either one you want to who wants to dethrone saul is he annoying you enough yet are you aggravated enough you know there has to come a time where he just becomes such a problem to you like he was becoming such a problem to god in the time of david that it was time to get rid of him hallelujah amen and if it was just all roses and you weren't going through nothing you would have no want you would just be like oh wow you know i'm just going to carry on like this but things get hard amen and if we ignore them they'll just stay there if we're too proud to go you know what i've got troubles am i never going for prayer because i've been in a message for 50 years you know i'm just going to say if there's any older people amen you're not out of this question you haven't gone too far where you can still get delivered amen there's still things to do otherwise you'd just be walking up out of here amen so let's not get past deliverance let's not get past you know our own things that need to be delivered out of our life because you see we have there has to come a time when we just become transparent before god to let god do what he does best amen but the ultimate decision that is made in your life is you and you need to decide of where the soul is dethroned and when you go through the troubles and soul your old nature begins to rise up against you and he sees that david's getting prosperous in the kingdom of your life and and and things start to go wrong and you begin to fail that's the time where right now even as you're hearing this word you can be delivered right now right in the presence of god in your room if you can if you can recognize it today if you can recognize what is taking place here and i'll read it in a second because the question is how to release your victory amen so he says here then on the inside he has only one gate on back there now let's go to the chat uh paragraph 19 it says now when a man is converted say just like that little white button again we're talking about starts in his heart now that part is god when he's born again with the spirit of god god's spirit dwells in him now he can let now this is the key here well there's a lot of keys actually but this is a good one now he can let that spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press god's way through him again he can become back in the same condition he was when he was in the garden of eden i don't know how that works but praise god anyway amen hallelujah oh man i wish i was at church right now and i could hear you mate hallelujah hey man amen and so you can see now i'm just creating a real foundation for this thought here of that seed that comes into you however you want to call it we can call it all these different things but ultimately it's a battle that happens within amen hallelujah i want to read you from colossians 1 27 to 29 it says to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles so this is you tonight which is christ in you the hope of glory amen hallelujah i want to talk to you about an entrance that is ministered to you amen hallelujah paul says here whom we preach hallelujah warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus so there is there is ministry and the preaching of the gospel and then and the fivefold ministry and all ministry but particularly in this case the apostolic vision and the five-fold ministry there is a great you could say power invested that god has invested for moments where you're sitting on your couch in your living room because we're in lockdown or you're sitting in a pune and there is a moment where the word is released and the presence of god comes and you get delivered and you can just run saul in that moment because it gets thrown up it gets brought out now if you sit there and you go yeah yeah oh yeah that's for them and i've passed that you're wrong you haven't passed it yes you haven't passed it because you're not perfect yet there is a work to do and so there is a moment and i'm not saying that everyone has to have a moment every time but when we get in the spirit hallelujah amen when we get in the spirit of the message and if that minister has got the burden of the spirit and he's preaching that there is an it's an event it's not just oh i've just heard some good information today oh i can see how that joins with that and i can see how that joins with that that that's that's not it that's only a portion of it to make you realize that god is so good and his word is so powerful but there's a greater measure when you get in the spirit of it and you begin to change as you're hearing the word and you begin to open your heart and you begin to enjoy it you begin to open the channels and you begin to say yes hallelujah then the deliverance can happen now this is an ordained part of the program of god amen but i just want to continue here it says we're unto also our labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily now that's paul saying that but you see the saying that we're not saint paul but the same jesus is living amongst his people the same jesus is being ministered to you tonight the same jesus gets ministered to you at every service hallelujah now how you perceive that and what you think about that will determine what you get out of it and the devil is going to come down and he's going to work with your old nature he's going to get a hold of saul in your life ain't going to begin to start twisting your thoughts you're going to begin to start trying to ruin the service and even tonight there's probably thoughts coming to people's minds right now to either distract you or to make you think something negative about somebody or something and you're missing it but you don't have to miss it because you can you can't stop the birds as we know the great proverb from flying over but you can stop them from landing and that is a duty that's been called on to the church to cast out devils and to cast down imaginations and every high thing that would exalt it so there is a war going on but you can win that battle amen because as soon as those thoughts come to you as soon as a criticism comes to you for you to criticize that minister or criticize that doctrine because it's different from your interpretation and you miss that whatever the lord is wanting to do and it throws you out of the service it throws you off the anointing but there's an anointing there is a there is a deliverance for you you can finally get rid of that thing amen you can finally get delivered from that thing that's been hounding you for 28 years 17 years whatever age however long you know what i mean but you see you have to be in the spirit to receive the moment that is being given to you it's vital and this is why the prophet says that the what bride when she knows who she is and what she stands for hallelujah and she can discern the antichrist spirit he will be powerless against her as he was as he against jesus who defeated him by the word amen and so you see you can come to that place because as soon as you see that and you know this is this this is the this is war amen this is war going on in the bride war going on for your attention war going on for your you know because you see god wants to release your victory he wants to release victory in your life amen and so we're going to go through a couple of things hallelujah do we have time i think we've got time amen pulses and i just want to continue one more thought i want you to think about honoring the word and the vessel to draw water from the wells of salvation thessalonians 5 12 and 13 it says and we beseech you that's we beg you brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake and be at peace among yourselves now i want you to not just think about that on an external sense but i want you to consider that in your own life because when you get born again and the word of god is coming to you that same word you've got to honor the word and when there's preaching coming to you and there's sermons coming to you and and you're being shown things in the word and god is speaking to you the same word that's being preached is inside you so if you despise the word that's being preached or you despise the vessel how do you think the word is going to work in your own life if you're despising it if there's a critical nature that throws you into a condition where the spirit of god cannot fellowship in your life cannot fellowship in your home you lose connection with the very life-giving source that can help you to be delivered and be changed and help the people that you're criticizing you know this you can be more effective than criticizing but actually getting in the spirit and becoming an effective part of the body hallelujah amen but i just want to i just wanted to labor on that because the question is how do we dethrone saul and i ask god that question because i see this type that we're about to go into further along and it's glorious and it shows some great things about us but i asked the question to the lord i said lord how how is saul de throne i want him to throne i don't want any complexes in my life i don't want any old nature trying to pull me down i don't want anything to be able to to pull me out of the spirit i just want to walk in the spirit hallelujah amen and being complete my victory completely released and this came was this scripture here we have to respect the ministry we have to love the ministry and i'm not saying go out of balance and go and cause a you know exalt the ministry like that it's not the man it's not the vessel it's the gift that god has placed it's an office of god hallelujah and you see when you can see god in that office you'll receive god from that office hallelujah amen so it's not the vessel per se although the vessel does have responsibility to consecrate and to yield but really ultimately if you can commune with god in the ministry you're going to get from the ministry what you need every week every sunday every wednesday amen who believes that hallelujah but the fight is because the devil knows that that is one of god's main sources for your spiritual welfare that's one of his main sources for for you to receive from him from god so the devil will do everything he can to make you carnal even while you're listening to this hallelujah do you realize that it's a battle it's a battle hallelujah if any thoughts come to you that is negative during services during sermons even in the songs or on the way to church you know the devil is trying to work he wants to throw you out because there is a portion of your inheritance ready for you to receive in the service hallelujah who believes that amen amen hallelujah i ask you this question where are you at in your kingdom hallelujah i just want to ask you that question let's go to 1 samuel 18 chapter verses 5 to 9. now remember we're going further along in the land now we were at the captain we were at the time of rahab and salmon and they had come together in marriage union and the seed obed i think it was you know that was the seed of david had begun the journey but it wasn't david yet but it was potentially david just like in your life when you get the holy ghost it may not be david yet but it's potentially david it's it's going to grow into something it's going to go into something that's going to be a big trouble for your old soul that's been troubling you now saul might be pretty happy with that gift because it gets you places and you can do things you become good at this or whatever but then one day hallelujah who's thankful for the one day when that appearing begins to start to manifest and all of a sudden saul has got a frankenstein on his hands amen sorry to call that frankenstein but you know what i mean saul's got a trouble on his hands because this gift this part of god in your life begins to form into a david amen started off his own seeds and manifestations of a lineage but one day hallelujah it became a david amen and david begin to appear in in the kingdom and i want to tell you that this is where we're at we're here now hello it's time for our king jesus because david is a type of christ to appear amongst his people but he'd like to appear in his people amen and as he begins to appear in your life that's trouble for the old nature the old nature begins to shake the old nature begins to get a bit jealous the old nature begins to cause some trouble in your life hello who's there you know who's who's seen things in their life that they thought was gone and all of a sudden you know as you know that you're maturing in god you know wow these things is becoming so great and your faith is rising in and always and all of a sudden stuff that you haven't struggled with all of a sudden you begin to struggle with again all of a sudden there's trouble in your home that wasn't there before all of a sudden there's trouble at your work that wasn't there before or trouble at your school that you thought i was above that and all of a sudden you're you're actually contending level i almost with it hello yes yes and david now i want to read from 1785 and this is as david had been brought into the kingdom now and he'd begin to appear in the kingdom he was an unknown and i'll get to that because god uses the unknown god uses david and i i just you know i could cry when i read these things about david and god begin to open it up i want to show you i pray we can get there amen hallelujah just just um let's just go amen and david went out with whatsoever saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and saul set him over the man of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people amen and also in the sight of soul service you see david was a perfect fit for the land david was a perfect fit because he was anointed to bring the inheritance he was anointed amen here i go again he was anointed to do all the will of god amen and i'm glad that there is a seed inside you that is anointed to do all the will of god to fulfill all of your inheritance everything that the enemies tried to hold it will come back and i want you to take it back hallelujah i want you to claim it lay hold of it don't give up don't give up on anything because it's all coming back it's all coming back because there is a david in your life hallelujah a real seed of god that cannot be defeated it cannot be contained hallelujah amen you try and contain the resurrection power you can't not contain it hallelujah amen i found that out the other night in my fridge even a fermenting bread life i've had a big thing over it and the whole thing burst out because there's life inside there i don't know what type of life that is but it's it's something alive and even that caused this thing to explode out that was sealed how much more the life of god even if you're strangled by your troubles saul might be having you against the wall throwing a javelin at you in your old in your life causing you to think all sorts of things and miss out on all sorts of fellowship because while you're there you just can't connect but there's a david rising up hallelujah tonight deliverance is yours amen right now praise the lord you can destroy that thing hallelujah you can dethrone that enemy hallelujah amen well god is so good to deliver these things for us let me read says here and remember david's a perfect fit that's where we got to for the kingdom my and it came to pass as they came when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistines that the woman came out of all the cities of israel singing and dancing hallelujah are you glad that as david rises in your life it brings you to a place where you can sing and dance and enjoy your your religion amen you can enjoy you know the message of the hour and go beyond just the pure warming experience to enjoying and entering in hallelujah there's a david in the land there's a real appearing of the son of man inside you says here that the woman came out of all the cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tablets with joy and with instruments and music and the woman answered one another as they prayed played and said soul has signed us thousands and david his ten thousands and saul was very roth angry and he and the saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have described but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom and i thought that was a good question amen and there has to come a time when you realize there's a real transition taking place in my journey to full adoption full adoption is your rapture it's the change of your body we're right at the very last part of that journey when you received a baptism of the holy ghost the spirit of adoption came down into your life and he's treated you and trained you and brought you through to bring you to your full adoption and we're right there but the thing is now we're at this point in the end of it all where this old nature where the devil is getting really upset because as you get higher in christ and as david rises up the devil is getting pulled out of his position the devil is getting torn out he can't do anything he's becoming slaughtered who likes that who's enjoying the fact that our dev that devil that enemy our enemy god's enemy he's being swatted he's being pulled down so he cannot function if he's still functioning in your life it's time for you to dethrone soul hallelujah it's time for soul to go you are the master of that decision god will not force it upon you but he is waiting for you to make that all sufficient decision to receive the all-sufficient grace of god oh my i just feel like jumping oh thank you jesus hallelujah if brahman can hear me can you please give me some water you know you don't think about these things amen hallelujah and a towel i've got the window open need a fan the window is open very hot in here now and the woman answered oh so you see now we have this rising up amen and here the scripture in verse 9 1 samuel 18 verse 9 it says and saul i'd david from that day so this there is a time thanks bro there's a time where as i was just saying rather loudly but i'll try and behave myself there was a time there is a time in all of our lives where a transition point happens where the the lord where your new nature where the david in you begins to overtake the soul amen now remember saul was was close to home it's close to home but he was the answer of the people's desire for a king not god's desire for a king you see god had chosen to soul for them based on what they wanted as a king so and god ascribed that to their choice because god could read their hearts and know their minds and know what they were thinking he knew what they actually wanted in their carnal understanding so he gave them that and he was a failure and he caused trouble yet he wasn't cast out of the kingdom of god there's a portion for him for when samuel was called up by the witch of endor he said that that tomorrow you shall be with me in paradise hallelujah amen isn't he wonderful amen saul to re calibrate reiterate saul is your defeated old nature which rises up and revolt just before full adoption because of david and his revelation these are just my notes david is your new nature which is the one that's incr christ and god you and him and him and you remember it's still you but it's christ in you the hope of glory that's an anticipation for you to be glorified to come into your kinship to come into dominion with christ it's a hope and glory we read that oh it's so nice christ in you the hope of glory and you go over the real depth there is a real depth inside there hallelujah that in you hallelujah it's the hope of your full victory and it's locked up in david it's locked up in that new nature that will just come meekly to the throne of your life he's not going to force you see that's not the nature of god to force the devil or force the devil will try everything he can but god inside you christ in you the hope of glory you've got to let him you see he's not going to take the throne if you don't give it he's not going to force himself upon the throne but he will take it if you allow him and you dethrone saul david is your new nature anointed to bring full adoption in your life through the divine characteristics so trusted by god it's the new nature now i hope this doesn't go over too many heads here but pre-glorified you see david is a type of your pre-glorified nature you come to your adoption but you're not in a glorified body yet you're in a place where you can speak and things will happen but yet you can still make mistakes like david and we can get into that maybe another time where david brought the ark to on on the cart and he did it wrong you see and yet the intention and the whole prophecy around it is glorious and he knew it and yet he had done it wrong so you see even that's why when and brother branham you see when god said because brother branham came to this place where he could speak and it would happen he was back in eden condition and yet pre-glorified he wasn't he still it had to be god that said now tell those squirrels now do this it was still a submission to the ultimate of god you see but when we get into our glorified state it's going to be even higher it'll be the same nature but without this soul without this flesh without this corruption amen because this corruption shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and you'll go from a pre-glorified condition which is what we're heading into just before the body change we're going into that now you will be subjected to the divine mind of god led by vision just like jesus subjected himself in that capacity as the son of man to to to be subjected to the father even though the father was in him and he was an expression of the father he subjected himself to a pre-glorified condition just like brother branham a redeemed man came to a pre-glorified condition and this is where we're going but yet you will be completely submitted to the vision of the father hallelujah for those of you that caught that you can have it that's very very good chew on it and enjoy it it's for you for those of you that didn't understand that you can listen to this again and study it out because it's a great thought but it's not something we want to dwell on too long in here but i just wanted to show you that david is that pre-glorified condition when he comes into full power in your life when soul is dethroned when all of those complexes that you struggle with is gone hallelujah david's rise was never forced israel's complete victory was hinging on the liberation and coronation of david's supreme power they couldn't access everything that joshua promised them until david was in power and david was a man after god's own heart with a beautiful vision with a vision of selfless care about people and the care of the will of god like nobody else that's the nature that god can trust he can't trust your selfish soul nature he can't trust your complexes he can't trust you when soul is ruling in your life that's why you get so defeated all the time that's why you fall all the time because saul hasn't been dethroned but it's time because david's rising even in the service david is rising you are feeding the white dog right now there's a crossover for you you can take it you can take it tonight whatever those things has been troubling you hallelujah dethrone it dethrone it stop harboring the devil and and you go oh how can he say the devil god can send devils you know that god can send evil spirits to trouble you because he wants you to dethrone the very thing that they're leveraging off i hope you caught that saw nature the devil comes to you set by god as a trial to exacerbate the soul nature in your life and you just throw it off and carry on don't do it take your opportunity call on the lord while he is near seek him while he may be found this is your time hallelujah stop basking in your soul nature and worshiping it it's not worth it for this is the season for total deliverance for an adoption give god the glory hallelujah because our david the david in our life is anointed to as a man after god's own heart to fulfill all the will of god that will is part of the inheritance to take everything that william branham's message promised all the statue of the perfect man all the fruits of the spirit all of whom you really are and all of your inheritance that adam lost the david inside you is anointed to bring that into your possession to be activated in your life to release your victory can everyone say victory amen oh my let's carry on the final blockage for david's coronation was saul and the consequent resistance of saul's house even mccall carried a negative narrative when it came to the dynamics of the pillar of fire and david's ministry of the ark coming back the ark represents the pillar of fire the the dynamics of the seventh seal the ark represents the power of god amongst the people the very the life that changes things and david was celebrating that and she criticized it she couldn't see the value oh my now that comes close to home you see because can you see the value of the seventh seal in your life can you see the value of that pillar of fire that has been given to the bride to take us through the land to take us on our journey you see the value mccall carried a negative narrative when it came to the dynamics of the pillar of fire it gets pretty close to home brothers it's not our wives it's all within so we don't want to go looking at our mccall's or our wives or our you know we can't look at that or anyone else in this matter it's all within it's all within our own kingdom it's all within our own heart it's all within their own life the kingdom of god is within you now saul fights the promotion of david here in one samuel 18 1 it says and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul and saul took him that day and wouldn't would let him go no more home to his father's house see it was all well and good at the start because david was an asset and it's the same thing in your life you think man this is going so good then all of a sudden the very christ in you the hope of your glory the hope of the glorification of your life the hope of you coming into your adoption full adoption begins to start to rev to change things around and begins to appear and you realize my now i want you to i just want you to think this don't fight back at the challenge of your own faith it's all happening within now don't reason it away tonight don't deflect the fire that's meant for you to those that you love and care about don't pitchfork your portion even if you know it will be good for others you are burdened for and praying for there's enough for them and for you so i want you to take your change receive your blessing your fire tonight i want you to just carry we're going to carry on down the story in 1 samuel 18 10 it says and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from god came upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in saul's hand now remember this this is an internal battle going on this is a battle going on and there are some people that go through this that i'm talking to tonight or maybe someone that's sitting on the table wherever you're at i guess everyone's on the on the internet tonight but where that old nature begins to give you suicidal thoughts begins to try and kill you begins to try and come at you because there is a fear or there's something going on a coalition with the devil but i want to tell you that true david he wasn't killed amen he was not killed because he was anointed to the throne he was anointed to kingship and i want to tell you in your life there is a part of you that is anointed to the throne that is anointed to kingship it cannot destroy you your own nature cannot destroy you though it may give you troubles though it may give you struggles it cannot overcome you hallelujah and every time that david was right there and that javelin was coming right at him and it probably only missed him by an inch but god got him out of there and he was an invincible part of the kingdom because there was a prophecy over his life and i want you to receive this there's a prophecy over your life as a rapture to be a king and a priest unto god to dwell with god eternally to be a tree that never goes brown that's always evergreen and planted by the lives of rivers of living water amen there's a promise over you there's a promise over you to be in victory there's a promise over you you've got the power tonight to dethrone saul hallelujah what's going on in your kingdom says here and saul cast the javelin for he said i will smite david even to the wall with it and david avoided out of his presence twice and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and was departed from saul amen there's a time where the glory that may have been helping you and just aiding you along and your and that old nature was going all right for a while like saul was and then it started causing trouble and then david started rising and then anointing of kingship left and it went on to the real part of you the real part of your life that's coming into kinship amen that part hallelujah but you see even if there's been many multiple suicide attempts the lord was still with david and he was still willing to deliver him from all of these things in his old nature that was working against him in coalition with the devil the evil spirit now you see that spirit of suicide see the lord will allow a demon to come down and stir that thing up because you see if it's hiding down in you and it's a family trait of depression or whatever it may be there has to come a time where that thing becomes exacerbated so that you can cast it down so that you can see to its end hallelujah amen so not even suicide was big enough to overcome the david coming to the throne amen not even the spirit of suicide that maybe struggling people have had in their life or have and are struggling with it it's not enough to defeat the coming king within you it's not enough to to stop you from coming to your adoption what's the time nine o'clock you're well welcome i've just got a couple more scriptures you're welcome to stand up and do a dance and sit back down if you're tired whoever's turning the cameras off is probably doing it everyone with the camera on is behaving themselves but you're allowed to dance amen hallelujah when it gets so intense the old nature even comes to the point of suicide but the lord will even allow a believer to struggle with evil spirits to ensure they dethrone saul there must be a complete dethroning of saul and complexes later after a soul is dethroned there must also be a removal of the sympathizing influence of saul's house in the kingdom within you these are learned behaviors bad habits you get yourself caught up in a group of people that are unsavory and you may have dethroned soul but those things begin to linger and you you know you've got to get rid of that stuff you've got to cast it away you've got to choose to allow david to come to the throne of your life so that he can cause you to come into your full inheritance amen hallelujah you know i'm so i'm really speaking to me as well so we're all in this together amen we pray for each other i'm tr i'm sure you pray for me oh yes hallelujah we'll go through battles but these battles are for our good hallelujah saul must be dethroned by you jesus won't do it he will take it but it must be available your free will who knows what veto means i hope you know what veto means veto is a political term in the world stage for or in any i think it's in any stage but it means two to to to to override that's too a decision is made by a certain country if there's there was i think there's five the big five countries that make decisions for the world stage i'm not going to name them all but if the if the major decision gets made on between these countries all five of them have to agree but if one of them doesn't then the whole things get annulled it cannot be done and it's an agreement so they call it veto and so the holy spirit will never override your free will at any stage of your life at any place no matter what you've previously prayed or said or agreements you've made the holy spirit will never override your free will you are the master of the discernment of your old nature and i'm telling you it's not easy to go and just throw your old nature it's not easy but that's why when i asked the lord and he gave me the ministry is a power to minister an entrance into the kingdom so there is and that that word minister in second peter is the same word for add to your faith virtue into your virtue knowledge into your knowledge temperance into your temperance godliness and are fire up until divine love it's a ministry so there is a power in you receiving ministry there's a power and though it says the foolishness of preaching it may not look like a big glorious thing it may look foolish but there is a power behind that that is there ready for you to be delivered right then and there under the sounding of the word you can cast down that old nature tonight you know i'm not just saying that in my own thing it's this is a reality but it has to come a moment when you know hallelujah you have to come to a gethsemane in these things the reason now there's a place there's a time now as david begins to come to his position the battles get a bit dirty saul becomes a bit more aggravated and you might come you might be in a season right now where you've never thought possible where you've come into such a place where there is so much troubles going on in your life don't think that you're all the way back at the start there's a reason for the season amen and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david that mccall sort of loved him and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul became david's enemy continually and we know the rest of the story we're not going to go down that path any longer i'm going to take this the i'm going to down through my closing statements i'm about to close amen i want to now go back into a path of of of looking and focusing on david now that i've shown you saul and that old nature and how you can dethrone him i want to show you why god loved david why god would choose this man in this nature it's such a glorious thing and when i show you you're going to love it i know you already love it because it's the word and it's in you already all i'm doing is reminding you of what's already inside you all i'm doing is teaching you what's already uh inside you amen we're just having fellowship together and if you can receive this then the word inside you is enjoying it and it's and david's rising up and saul's coming to an end hey man who agrees with me who agrees that this we're in a battle and this battle amen is just an array hallelujah i'm glad that the battle's in array amen hallelujah i'm not glad for the suffering and the pain and all of this things that we go through but they are necessary if they weren't how can you dethrone something that you don't even know is there oh my heck when are we go why and these are questions that i asked i said why are we going through this why is there such a battle so late in the hour why the resurfacing of issues we thought were dealt with why suicidal thoughts why evil spirits here's why i'm going to just pinch the screen of time and we're going to go right out to a dispensational level here and i want to show you a picture that the lord showed me to explain what season we're in right now who believes that the lord has come down into your land to subdue the devil amen that he's come down in such a powerful way to bring you to a place where satan is completely bound by circumstances amen where he can't operate anymore he's got no say that is the the supreme vision and goal and that's what he has done for us even you can say in the time of joshua the bible declared that god had finished and done everything that he had promised and given them all the land god's side of it was sorted now that people just had to go get it there was a big journey ahead 400 years of all sorts of struggles and troubles but they finally got it when david was king you see that's the same thing now take that and put that inside you the same captain that came down to israel and set rahab free and was with them through the whole journey is the same captain the mighty angel of revelation 10 with an open book come down into your heart to do the same thing for you and to bind satan so that he cannot operate and the vision and the goal is that you eat the word and that you begin to prophesy again to all kindreds tongues and nations and and what it does is it pulls the devil out of his position he becomes thwarted and powerless so that you can live in your victory and release your victory but now i want to show you that you are a little miniature earth and you have received the baptism of the holy ghost and the lord has come down into your life and there is an unconverted body that you are learning how to rule and reign in this time now when we go in the rapture we get a glorified body and we go into the marriage supper and we spend three and a half years in the marriage supper rejoicing while jesus in his theophany form makes himself known to the jews through the moses and elijah and the 144 000 but then after that and i love this after that the lord after the battle of armageddon and the tribulation has finished and it's all been sorted and the count settled then we and the lord come down to the earth and it's the earth is receiving the same baptism that we got the lord himself comes down to jerusalem into the heart of the earth to subdue the devil and we are with him now that's a thousand-year millennial period where there's this great awesome time of rejoicing oh and we're ruling and reigning with christ over an unconverted earth but the earth got the holy ghost got baptized by fire and you are part of the spirit because it's both male and female coming down out of the marriage supper out of heaven the baptism of the holy ghost you could say come down to the earth to jerusalem to create a millennial condition and then after that and this is where the lord showed me i just wanted to say that so i can show you this after the thousand years was finished if anyone doesn't know this you can just study the millennium after the millennium was finished a thousand years was up what happened you see all those unconverted people all those natural people that were that we were rolling and reigning over they needed to be proved there needed to come a time where all those people that were strong that were the devil was bound by circumstance but there was people there that was not of god there were people there that were all over the earth that that were actually not part of the bride or part of the elect and you see when it wouldn't it was all going well and the earth was baptized with the holy ghost and and we were rolling and reading well we will be walling and reigning with christ a thousand years and and his peace on the earth all those people no matter whether they were good or bad they were all behaved because the devil couldn't do anything but right at the end when the thousand years was finished it said that the devil would be loosed a little season and what happened when the devil was loosed was all of those people begin to rise up in the devil it proved who was in there it proved that there was there was parts of that earth that was not elect it proved that there was devil people it proved that the earth still had a soul the earth still had a soul nature that needed to be riled up it needed to be exacerbated because then because it needed to be cleansed by fire and that is the same thing as we come we've received the baptism of the holy ghost he's put peace to the earth he's given us dominion but then right at the end just before we receive our glorified body just before we get our new heaven and new earth then comes trouble sorry for that funny face but trouble trouble comes and you think oh man have i not even got the holy ghost you've got the holy ghost but it's trouble because there's a soul that needs to be dethroned there's those last things in your life that just need to be sorted out and if it's all bells and whistles and all better roses how can that ever be exposed but i want to tell you that the reason you're going through these things don't be ashamed don't be ashamed if you've had suicidal thoughts don't be ashamed if you've gone through struggles don't be ashamed if you've had lust thoughts or whatever they may be it's time to dethrone it it's the only reason you're going through is because it needs to be dethroned amen because there's a david in you that's causing you to bring full inheritance of everything that's been promised you that is actually and i'm going to say this because you already know but i like to bring things to you remember it's already in you everything is already there it's in david it's locked up in your new nature and when he comes into power he begins to express it and all those last enemies begin to be dissolved hallelujah are you with me amen i'm just gonna i'm not gonna preach anymore amen i want to finish this and i'm sorry it's gone to 9 14. but you are in your homes this i'm just cashing in on the travel time so amen travel time hallelujah hallelujah romans 6 says here knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin that word destroyed is to be put to a dormancy it's not an annihilation you see when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost it destroys the power of the enemy over you it doesn't remove the enemy you still have a fallen body that you contend with but you see it's been destroyed and then all of a sudden right at the end just before we get our new heaven and your earth just before we get our um glorified body all of a sudden there's these struggles it's because that nature needs the devil gets loosed a little seasoned just a little season it's because david is rising up so if you're going through things that you've never been through for a long time and you think my it's because david's rising up it's because the lord's appearing in your life it's because great things are happening in your life don't be ashamed to go through these things right now i'm just sharing these things with you because you will go through them because david's rising up because you're feeding the white dog because you're eating the word you're eating it and you're prophesying you're living a life hallelujah therefore david has to get stronger david rises up but now it comes a time when you have to make the decision shamelessly shamelessly sincerely be transparent in this hour this is why god has given us a church full of divine love because we can be transparent with each other we don't have to hide who we really are we don't have to hide our complexes we don't have to hide these things we can be honest and say lord i need this and go out for prayer talk about it share and pray with each other amen don't talk about each other's but talk about your own amen hallelujah confess your faults one to another pray for one another and you will be healed call the elders and get anointed with oil the same healing for your body is for your spirit because they're both subject to the fall and they both need healing amen and god's testing you to see how you rule over your own life amen hallelujah god says this about david and now this is the rest of this is all about why david and i know isaac's gonna like this because he likes david it says god says this to david i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will and one samuel oh my eyes uh one samuel 16 i think it is 11 12 and 13 it says in samuel said unto jesse i hear all thy children and he said they remaineth yet the youngest you know that word youngest if you've ever looked in the real meaning of that it means the least important the lesser the minimum yet the very success this is my words now of israel's future can you think about that the very least the very smallest the one that they thought was nothing and he probably didn't have the genetics there's even some ideas that david you know there was other he had a different mother than the others and things like that and so he was this black sheep so i've done a bit of research on the history of david and i'm just so blown away by that and it says here and he said and he says and samuel said unto jesse i know and he says he and he's yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse send him fetch him for we will not sit down until he comes here and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him this is he hallelujah and i want to tell you anoint him amen amen anoint david give him worship don't give your old new nature worship but give jesus worship give the the very jesus the christ and you anoint him give him preeminence hallelujah it says here then samuel then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to rhema says here now this is a translation of the same one samuel 16 12 and i don't know what translation it is to sorry but it was one that um it just means because the king james the language there it changed not changes it but it makes it sound different because of the way they used to talk and actually when you read it in this modern terminology you could say it says this and it talks about a king with a huge heart and a kind selfless vision think about that here's this boy that locked up inside him here's this nature in your life right don't look at what you are what you you can see yourself as what you fail at don't look at that right now look at the david inside you look at what jesus says well this is what this is what the scripture portrays here a king with a huge heart and kind selfless vision yet despised by man and exalted by god and he sent and this is the scripture that was my notes and he sent and fetched him and he was ruddy with beauty of eyes and very goodly to behold and the lord said to samuel rise and anoint david for he is good now that word beauty of eyes means he's got a beautiful vision and a man after god's own heart you see god the real you and god sees you and what's inside you the potentials is a man after god's own heart with a beautiful vision selfless caring about the bigger picture caring about the will of god that's the real you the real you you might not see that in your daily behavior you might not see that when you fail and you're down on the ground and the devil's tormenting you but that's what you really are and that's what is coming into power in your life as we speak and when you i'm not saying you haven't dethroned saul because there's many parts of our lives that have been dethroned but there's still things to follow there's still things to come to be dethroned and tonight you can dethrone them so that that beautiful vision and that beautiful countenance and that whole holistic nature of david that god trust and that god loved can come into power in your life and lead and guide you and be the very part of you so that god can give you the spoken word because the spoken word can only be given to a person where that nature is king and look what brother branham had to go through for that to happen and i don't want to put my hand up for that type of suffering and i don't think we have to go through all of that there will be some people that do that's up to the lord not up to us but that's up to god but there is a word that's been released like the captain's word release rahab there is a word that's been released through a prophet and his message to bring us to a place where we can receive that through the power of god through the dynamics of the holy ghost through the dynamics of powerful church meetings so i encourage you respect the ministry respect the five-fold ministry re receive from it and do your utmost endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit in the in the in the bonds of peace and come to church with a right attitude throw down all those old ways and negative thinking all you're doing is ruining the service for everyone but you see there's a david in you that will never do it and if you just dethrone that thing tonight don't let it don't let saul reign any longer just bring him down he's ready to come down he's ready david's ready to rise to seize the everlasting prize what's in david and this is my writing and then we're going to close a relentless pursuit of victory a secure faith in god's deliverance a heart of honor a prayer warrior a worshiper of god a powerful leader overcoming power godly perspective which could bring the ark of the covenant to jerusalem to fulfill all god's will let's close our eyes if you're with somebody then i just want you let's just all pray together and i want you not to pray for yourself in this case for some reason i don't understand why but just put your hand on someone next to you if it's appropriate and and we'll just pray for each other and just pray that we'll receive strength to let david reign in our lives lord jesus father you've i believe you gave us this thought and i know there's a lot in it lord and i pray you take up all these chopped words and and bring them together lord and i pray lord that what was for each person would be received for myself lord i really pray with all my heart that that you would father bring us all lord jesus to a place where we can really receive from you and walk in the revival that is our portion to have glorious church services to throw down the devil and all of his antics and all of the lies and all the fears and the failures and the family spirits and all of that stuff and dethrone it out of our lives lord to just thrown it out of our church the lord when the individual dethroned saul the church dethroned saul when the individual get walks in victory the church walks in victory when the individual lord is falling down the church falls down because we're a body we're together we're one family in christ and we're part of a body and yet we're individual and so i pray lord as the kingdom of god is within us i ask in jesus name for your anointing for your victory power to release the victory our victory and you are our victory oh god i pray lord send your power through every room and every life and and cause divine appointments to take place father let the angel of the lord go down into every neighborhood make appointments lord for every one of the brethren and our loved ones and whoever would hear this but also those that wouldn't hear it lord it's your word it's your glory i know you're doing things and i'm asking lord in jesus name committed order you commit all of my family to you my loved ones all the church lord just pray lord bless each one every one of us we need it lord in this last hours we know the devil is angry because he's being pulled out of his position he's losing his hold on all control of us and he's taking it out lord jesus where he can and finding ways in and finding loopholes he's just he's a he's a he's a he's a swift lord cunning worker but lord jesus father you're greater than him you're more you're more you're more intelligent than him father you have overcome the devil and lord we just call on you for that victory and i pray lord that you would reveal to each one of us in our own way how to dethrone saul when he has exacerbated when we see the real jesus christ in our lives appearing personally in our lives with substance appearing in our children with substance for them to lay their lives upon and know that god is real and know that they know that jesus christ is the living god and he's their gold hallelujah i committed to you lord i pray lord just take these things and and lord i know i just rely on you lord to make it real to every one of us in jesus christ's name we thank you lord and commit these things to you amen amen and
