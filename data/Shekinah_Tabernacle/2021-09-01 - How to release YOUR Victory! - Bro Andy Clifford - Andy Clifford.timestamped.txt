[31:41] but we just want to yield to the lord
[31:43] and let him
[31:44] have his way amen um i'm excited tonight
[31:48] about the
[31:49] the burden of the word of the lord that
[31:51] he's placed upon our heart and i believe
[31:54] that we're in a a very critical hour
[31:57] we're in a very special hour this is an
[32:01] hour if you can imagine that all these
[32:03] thousands of years of god building up
[32:06] this this moment
[32:08] in time where time will blend with
[32:10] eternity and his bride will be home with
[32:14] him finally and that union you think oh
[32:17] man i've been longing for this for 40
[32:19] years 20 years 10 years whatever 50. but
[32:23] how long has god been longing for this
[32:25] time of union and i think you know the
[32:28] heart of god the more closer we get to
[32:30] god in this hour
[32:33] the more we'll feel the very heart of
[32:35] god in these matters and i believe it's
[32:38] very important of vital importance for
[32:40] our
[32:40] spiritual health tonight and forevermore
[32:44] in our walk here on this earth to draw
[32:46] close to him
[32:48] draw nigh unto god and he will draw nigh
[32:50] unto you and and so make moves towards
[32:52] him amen amen hallelujah well i won't go
[32:57] too far down that that track we'll um
[33:00] we'll just come back to the word and i
[33:02] just trusted we could turn to
[33:04] john chapter 14
[33:07] tonight and luke 17. amen
[33:10] two very familiar scriptures for us um
[33:14] but we'll just bring these through to
[33:16] our remembrance and even the subject
[33:19] tonight

[33:21] to title the burden
[33:23] of of my heart and i believe the burden
[33:26] of of of the spirit of god tonight
[33:30] is
[33:31] how to release your victory amen

[33:38] completely released

[33:55] rapture together

[39:16] let's just encapsulate it and put it
[39:19] right down inside your heart because
[39:21] that's where it is and that's where the
[39:24] battle is the battle is inside you and
[39:26] there is a great battle going on tonight
[39:29] for your victory amen there is an old
[39:32] nature in you that wants to rise up it
[39:34] wants to cause trouble it will come into
[39:37] coalitions with the devil it's against
[39:39] everything that is of god but you see
[39:42] there is also a good seed within you
[39:45] there is a white dog within you and if
[39:47] you feed that dog and you worship god
[39:49] and you walk in that place of god and
[39:51] you're planted by the rivers of living
[39:53] water you see that one's going to rise
[39:55] up and so i want to show you here a
[39:58] parallel in these stories between david
[40:01] and saul and i don't want you to
[40:03] externalize that i don't even want you
[40:05] to put that in for anyone that you are
[40:07] burdened for because yes we're all
[40:09] burdened for people we're burdened for
[40:11] brethren in our church we're burdened
[40:13] for a family we're burdened for the lost
[40:16] but today i want you to be burdened for
[40:18] you
[40:19] not for other people even though it's
[40:21] good intentions you want everyone to be
[40:23] healed and you want them to be delivered
[40:25] you want them to be free but tonight
[40:27] there's enough for them and there's
[40:29] enough for you amen so let's not put it
[40:32] away to anybody else let's own this
[40:34] there is fire for you tonight fire to
[40:36] burn the dross amen there is god is here
[40:40] for you tonight to change things
[40:43] cataclysmically who knows what
[40:45] cataclysmic means amen hallelujah who
[40:48] wants cataclysmic change hallelujah amen
[40:52] well just let god do something in your
[40:54] life amen don't look at me look past me
[40:57] amen look at jesus because jesus is the
[40:59] one and he's somehow for some reason he
[41:03] chose man to preach the gospel and so
[41:06] here we are but let's not worry about
[41:08] the man part let's just worry about your
[41:10] fellowship with god tonight amen
[41:13] hallelujah
[41:15] wave if you're with me amen give me an
[41:18] amen of you can say amen hallelujah
[41:21] amen glory to god
[41:23] amen so you know
[41:26] this promised land is i want to just
[41:28] take this promised land tonight and and
[41:30] encapsulate that into our life and you
[41:32] know when you received the baptism of
[41:34] the holy ghost and the new birth and you
[41:36] died to yourself and you were born again
[41:38] and you think my you know it's going to
[41:40] be i'm i've arrived and in one sense you
[41:43] have arrived because the spirit of
[41:45] adoption has come down into your life
[41:48] and he's beginner work but then as
[41:50] things start to unfold in your life you
[41:52] realize wow there's actually a journey
[41:55] ahead and it's all planned by god and
[41:57] he's got a purpose and it's not going to
[41:59] be easy it's not going to be a walk in
[42:02] the park as they say it's going to be a
[42:04] challenge it's going to be a race that
[42:06] says in the bible in hebrews chapter 12.
[42:09] it says
[42:10] there's a race set before us and that
[42:12] race is a war a battle and it's been
[42:14] predestined and so when you submit to
[42:17] god he will lead you down that path and
[42:20] it's all for your good
[42:21] amen and because he knows and i'll read
[42:23] a quote in a second here that when you
[42:26] get the holy ghost and you are born
[42:28] again hallelujah when you've died to
[42:30] yourself and you've come god's provided
[42:33] way amen and we know that provided way
[42:35] you know you reject the world you get
[42:37] out of those things and you turn away
[42:39] from it you repent and you take the name
[42:41] of jesus christ in baptism showing that
[42:44] you are identified and you believe in
[42:46] the death burial and resurrection of our
[42:49] savior and that becomes personal when
[42:51] your faith reaches up and he receives it
[42:55] and he sends down the seal to circumcise
[42:58] your heart and begin to work you've come
[43:00] into the promised land the kingdom of
[43:02] god within you is inside you and now
[43:06] that kingdom of god has begun to such
[43:08] something's going to change because
[43:09] there's a new there's something burst
[43:11] within you and it's begin to a journey
[43:14] and it's not an easy journey but it's a
[43:16] journey he says that he which begun a
[43:18] good work in you amen
[43:21] shall continue it
[43:22] until the day of jesus christ hallelujah
[43:25] so what our lord starts within us he
[43:27] will continue it and there will be
[43:29] seasons where you think man this is
[43:31] barren yes there were deserts in the
[43:33] land
[43:34] did you know that
[43:36] the deserts in the promised land so you
[43:38] will have deserts
[43:40] there's times of desert there's times
[43:41] but it's a testing time it's a time to
[43:44] see what is really inside me and when
[43:47] that time comes you will see that there
[43:49] is a god inside you that can do miracles
[43:52] that can change you that can take you
[43:54] further just trust in him who will not
[43:57] leave you he will never let you go
[44:02] amen
[44:04] oh i like that trust in him who will not
[44:06] leave you
[44:07] amen
[44:09] hallelujah so you see when the holy
[44:11] ghost comes into your heart into the
[44:13] kingdom there is a king and he's come
[44:16] down but you see as the prophet says
[44:20] and i'll read this quote
[44:23] because you see it starts off in a seed
[44:25] form it starts off in a small form and
[44:27] he begins to push out
[44:29] he begins to push forth he begins to
[44:32] change things and and rearrange the
[44:34] house and and begin to do things that
[44:36] was never done before in your life and
[44:39] and it hurts
[44:41] there's valleys
[44:43] there's mountains
[44:44] there's times of trouble there's times
[44:46] of victory there's times of great
[44:49] celebration
[44:51] and then there's times of great
[44:52] heaviness and great trial but it's all
[44:55] part of the plan
[44:56] hallelujah amen but yet a seed has been
[45:00] sown in your life the seed of the holy
[45:03] ghost the seed of the word the seed of
[45:05] who you really are the seed of your new
[45:08] nature the seed of the real you the part
[45:11] of god that was that you know it says in
[45:13] the start scripture in that day you
[45:16] shall know and i'm talking about this
[45:18] day this is the day it's being given to
[45:20] you and i just want you to receive this
[45:22] tonight that in this day you
[45:25] hello everybody you shall know
[45:29] that i am in the father and the father
[45:31] and you're in me
[45:32] who am i that's just enough in that wow
[45:35] but then he says i'm in you hallelujah
[45:38] so look what comes down into you into
[45:40] the kingdom and it's the real you it's
[45:43] the real nature it's your new nature
[45:46] it's the it's that white dove we call it
[45:48] amen
[45:50] that one in you i'm gonna type as david
[45:54] amen
[45:55] and i want to show you that in the
[45:56] promised land the seed of david we're
[45:59] going to start it at
[46:02] rahab and salmon
[46:04] amen we're going to start that when when
[46:07] the mighty angel came down and he
[46:09] released the mystery on how to set rahab
[46:12] free to free her from babylonian bondage
[46:14] and prostitution and all those things
[46:17] and that seventh seal revelation came
[46:19] and the people caught it and they acted
[46:21] upon faith they acted upon the word of
[46:24] the message of the hour and they begin
[46:26] to see a pride set free and what did
[46:29] that bring and i'm talking about you now
[46:32] what did that bring when you received it
[46:34] what did that bring that brought you
[46:35] further along in your walk it began to
[46:38] unfold an identity of who you are
[46:41] hallelujah you're not just a normal just
[46:44] a church-goer or joining a part of god's
[46:47] plan you're part of god's kingdom
[46:50] hallelujah that's right and so you see
[46:53] now
[46:54] from that union because here comes this
[46:57] this rahab got set free and she married
[47:00] the captain of the host of israel and
[47:03] they their their seed lineage was the
[47:05] seed of david
[47:07] you see now that seed of david was just
[47:10] begin
[47:12] and it was just starting to work work
[47:13] its way through and i've written here
[47:16] if you can if i can just have your
[47:17] attention now that we've established
[47:20] exactly where we're going
[47:22] it says here it says your victory
[47:24] started in seed form
[47:27] when you were born again
[47:29] like the seed of david
[47:31] coming through the land
[47:33] from salmon and rahab
[47:36] now you thinking you look at that and
[47:38] you see how the devil tried everything
[47:39] he can to break that seed and to do man
[47:42] they went through some real hard times
[47:43] they went through some dark times and
[47:45] they but it came through amen who's glad
[47:47] it came through
[47:49] god always prevails amen and you might
[47:52] be in a situation tonight and all that's
[47:54] been going on maybe a good portion of
[47:56] your life even and you think oh my it's
[47:59] just going darker and darker but just
[48:01] remember god prevails amen remember that
[48:05] seed inside you is greater than all your
[48:08] circumstances greater than all the
[48:10] darkness all the pouring out of death
[48:12] and hell on the earth there is a seed in
[48:15] you that's greater and there's a promise
[48:17] hanging over you amen this says that he
[48:19] which begun the work shall continue it
[48:22] unto the day of jesus christ you will
[48:24] not have to you don't have to worry now
[48:27] don't you be afraid amen for joy comes
[48:30] in the morning amen joy in the morning a
[48:33] day that sow and tears shall doubtless
[48:35] reap enjoy amen so you shall go through
[48:38] these things but remember there is a
[48:41] seed within you amen and so i just
[48:43] continue this now the
[48:47] the seed of david coming through the
[48:48] land from salmon and rahab
[48:51] now place the kingdom
[48:53] within you
[48:54] to see now
[48:56] what is happening inside us as people as
[49:00] individuals
[49:01] the spirit of god has come in to us
[49:04] without anything held back now it's not
[49:07] an age of reformation it's not even it's
[49:11] not an age where we're destined for the
[49:13] church to go down again this is an age
[49:16] where the spirit of god shall take us
[49:18] home the spirit of god shall take us out
[49:21] of here that we shall come to the
[49:23] fullness of adoption to the point now
[49:26] the victory that gets released in you is
[49:29] a victory that causes you to never die
[49:32] amen do you realize that this is such a
[49:35] tremendous victory because this victory
[49:37] is a victory of rapture it's it's a
[49:40] victory that overcomes death itself
[49:52] now i want you to
[49:53] show i want to show you who's appearing
[49:56] in you now remember we're typing this as
[49:58] david it's that seed that has gone
[50:01] through your life and you've been
[50:02] through many things and i want to ask
[50:04] you this question soon where are you
[50:08] where are you
[50:10] you know where are you in your walk
[50:12] where are you in the kingdom
[50:14] where are you
[50:16] you know you need to find out where
[50:18] you're at
[50:19] it's very important
[50:21] it's a big question lord where am i
[50:23] where are we
[50:24] where are we at lord amen
[50:27] we know where it's all happening and the
[50:29] time is unfolding and as time unfolds
[50:32] god unfolds the mystery of his will he
[50:34] unfolds the prophecies that are ordained
[50:37] for each time and generation
[50:39] are you wisdom
[50:41] are you there
[50:42] are you dragging back are you pulling
[50:44] back are you still stuck in some part of
[50:46] your life you're where your journey's at
[50:48] just remember
[50:49] if you pull back your journey it just
[50:51] stays there but remember there's grace
[50:54] there is grace to take you
[50:56] further on amen there's grace to take
[50:59] you into the very plan of god again amen
[51:03] we will have times where we begin to
[51:05] pull back or we get distracted and we
[51:07] get thrown off but there is grace
[51:09] tonight and i want you to know that if
[51:11] you're in a place of darkness or you may
[51:13] be in a place where you feel like oh i
[51:15] just can't go back you can come back
[51:17] tonight tonight
[51:19] while you're hearing this even now it's
[51:22] not a time thing now you can enter in
[51:24] and come back
[51:26] hallelujah right into fellowship right
[51:28] where he's at amen amen
[51:32] amen
[51:34] this is the appearing
[51:36] now we know that in the prophet's
[51:38] ministry the son of man
[51:40] you know the the prophetic revelation of
[51:43] god
[51:44] was was manifested in the prophet's
[51:46] ministry and in all the discernment of
[51:48] hearts and the and the mighty works that
[51:50] were done within them
[51:52] but you see now that same appearing has
[51:55] to be released in a people hallelujah
[51:58] and so the message came and the word
[52:00] came just like it came to the captain
[52:02] and when they obeyed the word and the
[52:04] army of the lord got in behind the word
[52:06] they got under the word amen and they
[52:08] began to obey it it began to set the
[52:10] rahabs free it began to set the bride
[52:12] free it began to show people i'm not no
[52:15] prostitute in
[52:16] babylon no stuck behind all these old
[52:18] false religions i'm part of the bride
[52:21] hallelujah i can be set free amen
[52:24] hallelujah
[52:25] now
[52:27] this is the appearing of the son of man
[52:29] firstly in a prophet's ministry in the
[52:31] message as it was given but that word
[52:34] was released like it was to rahab to set
[52:37] us free and appear in our lives so that
[52:40] seed that life
[52:42] that journey of the seed of david that
[52:45] seed that we receive when we get born
[52:47] again that light within us
[52:50] amen that new nature
[52:52] that
[52:53] is the very essence
[52:55] of the appearing of the son of man in
[52:58] your life
[52:59] in my life in our lives and it begins to
[53:02] dawn like a day it says into peter
[53:05] that there will come a time and he was
[53:07] looking ahead to an age which you are in
[53:10] right now in your living room in your
[53:12] bedroom this is the age of the dawning
[53:15] of the day star
[53:17] hallelujah who believes me do you
[53:19] believe me that the day
[53:21] the very son of man the very the love of
[53:24] god is dawning in the hearts of people
[53:27] hallelujah
[53:28] amen
[53:29] and you see that will just continue to
[53:32] grow as he appears
[53:34] but i want to talk about things in a
[53:36] minute here
[53:37] there are hint there is another nature
[53:40] inside of us
[53:41] and this nature
[53:42] is called a sticky nature this nature
[53:45] does not want this to happen
[53:47] amen and when this
[53:50] your true self and i'm gonna label them
[53:53] now david and saul so whenever i talk
[53:56] about david and whenever i talk about
[53:58] saul i'm talking about your old your new
[54:01] nature and your old nature i'm talking
[54:03] about christ in you the hope of glory
[54:06] and i'm talking about the old nature
[54:09] that wants to rise up and
[54:11] and and cause trouble in your life and
[54:14] it's and it's sticky with family traits
[54:17] and family spirits and and habits and
[54:19] complexes and all these things that you
[54:22] thought may have been gone in your life
[54:23] but then all of a sudden these things
[54:26] start appearing again and you go why am
[54:28] i going through this tonight i want to
[54:30] talk about that
[54:31] i want to talk about why but i want to
[54:34] show you how to to to to dethrone it
[54:38] amen you see saul had to be dethroned
[54:43] amen and david would not dethrone him so
[54:46] here is the whole
[54:48] the whole concept of this thought
[54:51] david rises up
[54:53] with meekness with assurance with vision
[54:56] and yet he would not put himself in that
[54:59] position
[55:00] our lord jesus inside of our life
[55:03] coupled with our true nature and who we
[55:05] really are part of him amen
[55:08] will not force himself upon the throne
[55:12] he will not go past your free will
[55:15] amen so you are the one that has to
[55:18] dethrone saul
[55:22] hallelujah sorry
[55:25] oh okay robin's telling me to turn the
[55:27] volume down
[55:29] so i will
[55:35] there we go they're better
[55:39] okay
[55:41] amen i want to read you a quote here
[55:47] the prophet says this now for instances
[55:49] when a man gets saved the light that
[55:51] comes into him is about like this little
[55:54] white button on my shirt
[55:59] that's when god comes into the inner
[56:01] part of a man
[56:03] now i've abbreviated this for time's
[56:04] sake because this was a lot he said in
[56:07] between here and what i'm about to read
[56:10] talking about the inner workings of a
[56:12] man but that's not our scope tonight but
[56:14] now he says here further down
[56:16] now on the outside gates of a man this
[56:19] is five senses
[56:21] that enters to his body on the inside
[56:24] which is his soul
[56:26] the soul is the nature of the spirit
[56:28] that's on the inside of his heart
[56:31] produces his soul
[56:32] which makes the atmosphere around him he
[56:35] has also five entrances or gates or
[56:38] channels
[56:40] then on the inside he has only one gate
[56:44] one entrance to go into the shekinah
[56:46] glory
[56:47] where god can enter into him and take
[56:50] over in the control tower
[56:52] and that way is through self-will
[56:56] whether you will
[56:58] to or not
[57:00] that's up to you
[57:02] but that's
[57:03] the only
[57:05] avenue that's open to the man that god
[57:08] can come into his heart
[57:10] is by self-will
[57:12] puts him right
[57:14] back like adam and eve on free moral
[57:17] agency again
[57:19] you can choose right or wrong either one
[57:22] you want to
[57:24] who wants to dethrone saul
[57:26] is he annoying you enough yet are you
[57:29] aggravated enough
[57:30] you know there has to come a time where
[57:32] he just becomes such a problem to you
[57:35] like he was becoming such a problem to
[57:36] god in the time of david that it was
[57:39] time to get rid of him hallelujah
[57:43] amen
[57:44] and if it was just all roses and you
[57:46] weren't going through nothing you would
[57:47] have no want you would just be like oh
[57:49] wow you know i'm just going to carry on
[57:50] like this but things get hard amen and
[57:54] if we ignore them they'll just stay
[57:56] there if we're too proud to go you know
[57:58] what i've got troubles
[57:59] am i never going for prayer because i've
[58:01] been in a message for 50 years
[58:03] you know
[58:05] i'm just going to say if there's any
[58:06] older people amen you're not out of this
[58:09] question you haven't gone too far where
[58:11] you can still get delivered amen there's
[58:13] still things to do otherwise you'd just
[58:15] be walking up out of here amen so let's
[58:18] not get past deliverance let's not get
[58:20] past you know our own things that need
[58:23] to be delivered out of our life because
[58:25] you see we have there has to come a time
[58:27] when we just become transparent before
[58:29] god to let god do what he does best amen
[58:33] but the ultimate decision that is made
[58:36] in your life is you
[58:38] and you need to decide of where the soul
[58:41] is dethroned and when you go through the
[58:43] troubles and soul your old nature begins
[58:45] to rise up against you and he sees that
[58:48] david's getting prosperous in the
[58:50] kingdom of your life and
[58:52] and and things start to go wrong and you
[58:54] begin to fail
[58:55] that's the time where right now even as
[58:57] you're hearing this word you can be
[58:59] delivered
[59:00] right now
[59:02] right in the presence of god in your
[59:03] room if you can if you can recognize it
[59:06] today
[59:07] if you can recognize what is taking
[59:09] place here and i'll read it in a second
[59:11] because the question is how to release
[59:15] your victory
[59:17] amen
[59:19] so he says here
[59:22] then on the inside he has only one gate
[59:24] on back there now let's go to the chat
[59:27] uh
[59:28] paragraph 19 it says now when a man is
[59:30] converted
[59:32] say just like that little white button
[59:34] again we're talking about
[59:36] starts in his heart
[59:38] now that part is god
[59:40] when he's born again with the spirit of
[59:43] god
[59:44] god's spirit dwells in him
[59:47] now he can let now this is the key here
[59:50] well there's a lot of keys actually but
[59:51] this is a good one
[59:53] now he can let that spirit grow
[59:56] and take out all the roots of bitterness
[59:58] and press
[59:59] god's way
[1:00:01] through him again
[1:00:03] he can become back in the same condition
[1:00:06] he was
[1:00:08] when he was
[1:00:09] in the garden of eden i don't know how
[1:00:11] that works but praise god anyway amen
[1:00:14] hallelujah
[1:00:16] oh man i wish i was at church right now
[1:00:18] and i could hear you
[1:00:19] mate
[1:00:21] hallelujah
[1:00:24] hey man amen
[1:00:27] and so you can see now i'm just
[1:00:30] creating a real foundation for this
[1:00:32] thought here
[1:00:33] of that seed that comes into you however
[1:00:35] you want to call it we can call it all
[1:00:37] these different things but ultimately
[1:00:39] it's a battle that happens within amen
[1:00:42] hallelujah
[1:00:45] i want to read you from colossians 1 27
[1:00:47] to 29 it says to whom god would make
[1:00:50] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:00:53] this mystery
[1:00:55] among the gentiles so this is you
[1:00:57] tonight
[1:00:58] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:01:02] amen hallelujah i want to talk to you
[1:01:05] about an entrance that is ministered to
[1:01:08] you amen hallelujah paul says here whom
[1:01:12] we preach
[1:01:13] hallelujah
[1:01:15] warning every man and teaching every man
[1:01:18] in all wisdom that we may present every
[1:01:21] man perfect in christ jesus so there is
[1:01:24] there is ministry
[1:01:26] and the preaching of the gospel and then
[1:01:29] and the fivefold ministry
[1:01:31] and all ministry but particularly in
[1:01:33] this case the apostolic vision and the
[1:01:36] five-fold ministry
[1:01:38] there is a great
[1:01:39] you could say
[1:01:41] power invested that god has invested
[1:01:45] for moments
[1:01:47] where you're sitting on your couch in
[1:01:48] your living room because we're in
[1:01:50] lockdown or you're sitting in a pune
[1:01:53] and there is a moment where the word is
[1:01:55] released
[1:01:56] and the presence of god comes and you
[1:01:58] get delivered
[1:02:00] and you can just run saul in that moment
[1:02:02] because it gets
[1:02:03] thrown up it gets brought out
[1:02:06] now if you sit there and you go yeah
[1:02:08] yeah
[1:02:12] oh yeah that's for them and i've passed
[1:02:13] that
[1:02:14] you're wrong
[1:02:16] you haven't passed it yes
[1:02:19] you haven't passed it because you're not
[1:02:20] perfect yet there is a work to do and so
[1:02:23] there is a moment
[1:02:25] and i'm not saying that everyone has to
[1:02:27] have a moment every time but when we get
[1:02:29] in the spirit
[1:02:31] hallelujah amen when we get in the
[1:02:33] spirit of the message and if that
[1:02:36] minister has got the burden of the
[1:02:38] spirit and he's preaching that there is
[1:02:40] an it's an event it's not just oh i've
[1:02:43] just heard some good information today
[1:02:45] oh i can see how that joins with that
[1:02:47] and i can see how that joins with that
[1:02:50] that that's that's not it
[1:02:52] that's only a portion of it to make you
[1:02:55] realize that god is so good and his word
[1:02:57] is so powerful but there's a greater
[1:02:58] measure
[1:03:00] when you get in the spirit of it
[1:03:02] and you begin to change
[1:03:04] as you're hearing the word and you begin
[1:03:06] to open your heart and you begin to
[1:03:08] enjoy it you begin to open the channels
[1:03:10] and you begin to say yes
[1:03:12] hallelujah then the deliverance can
[1:03:15] happen now this is an ordained
[1:03:18] part of the program of god
[1:03:21] amen
[1:03:22] but i just want to continue here it says
[1:03:26] we're unto also our labor
[1:03:28] striving according to his working which
[1:03:31] worketh in me mightily now that's paul
[1:03:33] saying that but you see the saying that
[1:03:36] we're not saint paul but the same jesus
[1:03:38] is living amongst his people the same
[1:03:41] jesus is being ministered to you tonight
[1:03:44] the same jesus gets ministered to you at
[1:03:46] every service hallelujah
[1:03:49] now how you perceive that and what you
[1:03:52] think about that will determine what you
[1:03:54] get out of it
[1:03:56] and the devil is going to come down and
[1:03:59] he's going to work with your old nature
[1:04:02] he's going to get a hold of saul
[1:04:04] in your life
[1:04:05] ain't going to begin to start twisting
[1:04:07] your thoughts
[1:04:08] you're going to begin to start trying to
[1:04:09] ruin the service
[1:04:11] and even tonight there's probably
[1:04:13] thoughts coming to people's minds right
[1:04:15] now to either distract you or to make
[1:04:17] you think something negative about
[1:04:19] somebody or something and you're missing
[1:04:22] it
[1:04:23] but you don't have to miss it because
[1:04:25] you can you can't stop the birds as we
[1:04:27] know the great proverb from flying over
[1:04:30] but you can stop them from landing and
[1:04:33] that is a duty that's been called on to
[1:04:34] the church to cast out devils and to
[1:04:37] cast down imaginations and every high
[1:04:39] thing that would exalt it so there is a
[1:04:42] war going on but you can win that battle
[1:04:45] amen because as soon as those thoughts
[1:04:47] come to you as soon as a criticism comes
[1:04:49] to you for you to criticize that
[1:04:51] minister or criticize that doctrine
[1:04:54] because it's different from your
[1:04:55] interpretation and you miss that
[1:04:57] whatever the lord is wanting to do and
[1:05:00] it throws you out of the service it
[1:05:02] throws you off the anointing but there's
[1:05:04] an anointing there is a there is a
[1:05:06] deliverance for you you can finally get
[1:05:08] rid of that thing
[1:05:09] amen you can finally get delivered from
[1:05:12] that thing that's been hounding you for
[1:05:13] 28 years 17 years whatever age however
[1:05:17] long you know what i mean
[1:05:20] but you see
[1:05:21] you have to be in the spirit
[1:05:23] to receive the moment
[1:05:26] that is being given to you
[1:05:30] it's vital
[1:05:31] and this is why the prophet says that
[1:05:33] the what bride when she knows who she is
[1:05:36] and what she stands for
[1:05:38] hallelujah
[1:05:39] and she can discern the antichrist
[1:05:42] spirit
[1:05:43] he will be powerless against her as he
[1:05:45] was as he against jesus
[1:05:48] who defeated him by the word amen and so
[1:05:51] you see you can come to that place
[1:05:53] because as soon as you see that and you
[1:05:55] know this is this this is the this is
[1:05:57] war
[1:05:58] amen this is war going on in the bride
[1:06:02] war going on for your attention war
[1:06:04] going on for your you know because you
[1:06:07] see god wants to release your victory he
[1:06:10] wants to release victory in your life
[1:06:12] amen and so we're going to go through a
[1:06:14] couple of things hallelujah do we have
[1:06:17] time i think we've got time
[1:06:19] amen
[1:06:28] pulses
[1:06:32] and i just want to continue one more
[1:06:33] thought
[1:06:35] i want you to think about honoring the
[1:06:37] word
[1:06:38] and the vessel
[1:06:41] to draw water from the wells of
[1:06:43] salvation
[1:06:46] thessalonians 5 12 and 13 it says and we
[1:06:48] beseech you that's we beg you
[1:06:51] brethren to know them which labor among
[1:06:54] you
[1:06:55] and are over you in the lord and
[1:06:57] admonish you
[1:06:58] and to esteem them very highly
[1:07:01] in love for their work's sake
[1:07:03] and be at peace among yourselves
[1:07:07] now i want you to not just think about
[1:07:09] that on an external sense
[1:07:11] but i want you to consider that in your
[1:07:13] own life because when you get born again
[1:07:16] and the word of god is coming to you
[1:07:18] that same word you've got to honor the
[1:07:20] word
[1:07:21] and when there's preaching coming to you
[1:07:22] and there's sermons coming to you and
[1:07:24] and you're being shown things in the
[1:07:26] word and god is speaking to you
[1:07:29] the same word that's being preached is
[1:07:31] inside you so if you despise the word
[1:07:34] that's being preached or you despise the
[1:07:36] vessel
[1:07:37] how do you think the word is going to
[1:07:39] work in your own life if you're
[1:07:41] despising it
[1:07:44] if there's a critical nature that throws
[1:07:46] you into a condition where the spirit of
[1:07:48] god cannot fellowship in your life
[1:07:51] cannot fellowship in your home you lose
[1:07:53] connection with the very life-giving
[1:07:56] source that can help you to be delivered
[1:07:59] and be changed and help the people that
[1:08:01] you're criticizing
[1:08:04] you know this you can be more effective
[1:08:06] than criticizing but actually getting in
[1:08:08] the spirit and becoming an effective
[1:08:10] part of the body hallelujah amen but i
[1:08:14] just want to i just wanted to labor on
[1:08:16] that because the question is how
[1:08:19] do we dethrone saul and i ask god that
[1:08:21] question
[1:08:22] because i see this type that we're about
[1:08:24] to go into further along and it's
[1:08:27] glorious and it shows some great things
[1:08:29] about us but i asked the question to the
[1:08:31] lord i said lord
[1:08:32] how
[1:08:34] how is saul de throne i want him to
[1:08:36] throne i don't want any complexes in my
[1:08:39] life i don't want any old nature trying
[1:08:41] to pull me down
[1:08:43] i don't want anything to be able to to
[1:08:45] pull me out of the spirit i just want to
[1:08:47] walk in the spirit hallelujah amen and
[1:08:50] being complete
[1:08:51] my victory completely released
[1:08:55] and this came was this scripture here
[1:08:59] we have to respect the ministry
[1:09:01] we have to love the ministry and i'm not
[1:09:03] saying go out of balance and
[1:09:05] go and cause a you know exalt the
[1:09:08] ministry like that it's not the man it's
[1:09:10] not the vessel it's the gift that god
[1:09:12] has placed it's an office of god
[1:09:16] hallelujah and you see when you can see
[1:09:19] god in that office you'll receive god
[1:09:21] from that office
[1:09:22] hallelujah
[1:09:24] amen so it's not the vessel per se
[1:09:27] although the vessel does have
[1:09:28] responsibility to consecrate and to
[1:09:30] yield but really ultimately if you can
[1:09:34] commune with god in the ministry
[1:09:36] you're going to get from the ministry
[1:09:38] what you need every week every sunday
[1:09:40] every wednesday amen who believes that
[1:09:43] hallelujah
[1:09:45] but the fight is because the devil knows
[1:09:47] that that is one of god's main sources
[1:09:50] for your spiritual welfare
[1:09:53] that's one of his main
[1:09:55] sources for for you to receive from him
[1:09:59] from god
[1:10:00] so the devil will do everything he can
[1:10:03] to make you carnal
[1:10:04] even while you're listening to this
[1:10:07] hallelujah do you realize that
[1:10:10] it's a battle
[1:10:11] it's a battle
[1:10:13] hallelujah if any thoughts come to you
[1:10:15] that is negative during services during
[1:10:18] sermons even in the songs or on the way
[1:10:20] to church you know the devil is trying
[1:10:22] to work he wants to throw you out
[1:10:24] because there is
[1:10:27] a portion of your
[1:10:28] inheritance ready for you to receive
[1:10:31] in the service
[1:10:33] hallelujah who believes that amen
[1:10:36] amen
[1:10:38] hallelujah
[1:10:41] i ask you this question
[1:10:43] where are you at
[1:10:45] in your kingdom
[1:10:47] hallelujah
[1:10:50] i just want to ask you that question
[1:10:54] let's go to 1 samuel 18
[1:10:57] chapter verses 5 to 9.
[1:11:05] now remember we're going further along
[1:11:07] in the land now
[1:11:08] we were at the captain
[1:11:11] we were at the time of rahab and salmon
[1:11:13] and they had come together in marriage
[1:11:15] union and the seed obed i think it was
[1:11:21] you know that was the seed of david had
[1:11:23] begun the journey but it wasn't david
[1:11:25] yet
[1:11:26] but it was potentially david just like
[1:11:29] in your life when you get the holy ghost
[1:11:31] it may not be david yet
[1:11:33] but it's potentially david it's it's
[1:11:36] going to grow into something it's going
[1:11:38] to go into something that's going to be
[1:11:39] a big trouble for your old soul that's
[1:11:41] been troubling you
[1:11:43] now saul might be pretty happy with that
[1:11:44] gift because it gets you places and you
[1:11:46] can do things you become good at this or
[1:11:48] whatever but then one day hallelujah
[1:11:51] who's thankful for the one day when that
[1:11:53] appearing begins to start to manifest
[1:11:56] and all of a sudden saul has got a
[1:11:58] frankenstein on his hands amen sorry to
[1:12:01] call that frankenstein but you know what
[1:12:02] i mean saul's got a trouble on his hands
[1:12:05] because this gift this part of god in
[1:12:08] your life begins to form into a david
[1:12:10] amen started off
[1:12:13] his own seeds and
[1:12:15] manifestations of a lineage but one day
[1:12:18] hallelujah it became a david amen and
[1:12:21] david begin to appear in
[1:12:23] in the kingdom and i want to tell you
[1:12:25] that this is where we're at
[1:12:27] we're here now hello it's time for our
[1:12:31] king jesus because david is a type of
[1:12:33] christ to appear amongst his people but
[1:12:36] he'd like to appear in his people amen
[1:12:40] and as he begins to appear in your life
[1:12:44] that's trouble for the old nature
[1:12:47] the old nature begins to shake the old
[1:12:49] nature begins to get a bit jealous the
[1:12:51] old nature begins to cause some trouble
[1:12:54] in your life hello who's there you know
[1:12:57] who's who's seen things in their life
[1:13:00] that they thought was gone and all of a
[1:13:02] sudden you know as you know that you're
[1:13:05] maturing in god you know wow these
[1:13:07] things is becoming so great and your
[1:13:09] faith is rising in and always and all of
[1:13:11] a sudden stuff that you haven't
[1:13:13] struggled with all of a sudden you begin
[1:13:15] to struggle with again all of a sudden
[1:13:17] there's trouble in your home that wasn't
[1:13:19] there before all of a sudden there's
[1:13:21] trouble at your work that wasn't there
[1:13:23] before or trouble at your school that
[1:13:25] you thought i was above that and all of
[1:13:27] a sudden you're
[1:13:29] you're actually contending
[1:13:31] level i almost with it
[1:13:34] hello
[1:13:35] yes
[1:13:37] yes
[1:13:39] and david
[1:13:40] now i want to read from 1785 and this is
[1:13:43] as
[1:13:44] david had been brought into the kingdom
[1:13:46] now and he'd begin to appear in the
[1:13:48] kingdom
[1:13:49] he was an unknown and i'll get to that
[1:13:52] because god uses the unknown
[1:13:54] god uses david and i i just you know i
[1:13:57] could cry
[1:13:58] when i read these things about david and
[1:14:01] god begin to open it up i want to show
[1:14:03] you i pray we can get there amen
[1:14:06] hallelujah just just um let's just go
[1:14:09] amen and david went out with whatsoever
[1:14:12] saul sent him
[1:14:14] and behaved himself wisely and saul set
[1:14:17] him over the man of war and he was
[1:14:19] accepted in the sight of all the people
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:23] and also in the sight of soul service
[1:14:25] you see david was a perfect fit for the
[1:14:27] land david was a perfect fit because he
[1:14:29] was anointed to bring the inheritance he
[1:14:32] was anointed amen here i go again he was
[1:14:34] anointed to do all the will of god amen
[1:14:40] and i'm glad that there is a seed inside
[1:14:42] you that is anointed to do all the will
[1:14:45] of god to fulfill all of your
[1:14:48] inheritance
[1:14:50] everything that the enemies tried to
[1:14:52] hold it will come back and i want you to
[1:14:55] take it back hallelujah i want you to
[1:14:57] claim it lay hold of it don't give up
[1:14:59] don't give up on anything because it's
[1:15:01] all coming back
[1:15:04] it's all coming back because there is a
[1:15:06] david in your life hallelujah a real
[1:15:09] seed of god that cannot be defeated it
[1:15:12] cannot be contained hallelujah amen you
[1:15:15] try and contain the resurrection power
[1:15:17] you can't
[1:15:19] not contain it hallelujah
[1:15:21] amen
[1:15:22] i found that out the other night in my
[1:15:24] fridge
[1:15:25] even a fermenting bread life
[1:15:28] i've had a big thing over it and the
[1:15:29] whole thing burst out
[1:15:31] because there's life inside there i
[1:15:32] don't know what type of life that is but
[1:15:34] it's it's something alive and even that
[1:15:36] caused this thing to explode out that
[1:15:38] was sealed
[1:15:40] how much more the life of god
[1:15:45] even if you're strangled by your
[1:15:46] troubles saul might be having you
[1:15:48] against the wall throwing a javelin at
[1:15:50] you
[1:15:51] in your old in your life
[1:15:53] causing you to think all sorts of things
[1:15:55] and miss out on all sorts of fellowship
[1:15:58] because while you're there you just
[1:15:59] can't connect
[1:16:00] but there's a david rising up
[1:16:03] hallelujah tonight
[1:16:04] deliverance is yours
[1:16:06] amen right now praise the lord you can
[1:16:09] destroy that thing
[1:16:11] hallelujah
[1:16:12] you can dethrone that enemy
[1:16:15] hallelujah
[1:16:18] amen well god is so good
[1:16:21] to deliver these things for us
[1:16:23] let me read
[1:16:28] says here and
[1:16:30] remember david's a perfect fit that's
[1:16:32] where we got to for the kingdom
[1:16:36] my
[1:16:38] and it came to pass as they came
[1:16:40] when david was returned from the
[1:16:42] slaughter of the philistines
[1:16:45] that the woman came out of all the
[1:16:47] cities of israel singing and dancing
[1:16:49] hallelujah are you glad that as david
[1:16:52] rises in your life it brings you to a
[1:16:55] place where you can sing and dance and
[1:16:57] enjoy your your religion amen you can
[1:17:00] enjoy you know the message of the hour
[1:17:03] and go beyond just the pure warming
[1:17:04] experience to enjoying and entering in
[1:17:07] hallelujah
[1:17:10] there's a david in the land there's a
[1:17:12] real appearing of the son of man inside
[1:17:14] you
[1:17:21] says here
[1:17:23] that the woman came out of all the
[1:17:24] cities of israel singing and dancing to
[1:17:26] meet king saul
[1:17:28] with tablets with joy and with
[1:17:30] instruments and music and the woman
[1:17:31] answered one another as they prayed
[1:17:33] played and said soul has signed us
[1:17:36] thousands and david his ten thousands
[1:17:39] and saul was very roth angry and he and
[1:17:42] the saying displeased him
[1:17:45] and he said
[1:17:46] they have ascribed unto david ten
[1:17:48] thousands and to me they have described
[1:17:50] but thousands
[1:17:53] and what can he have
[1:17:55] more but the kingdom
[1:17:57] and i thought that was a good question
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:01] and there has to come a time when you
[1:18:03] realize there's a real transition taking
[1:18:05] place in my journey
[1:18:07] to full adoption
[1:18:09] full adoption is your rapture it's the
[1:18:11] change of your body
[1:18:12] we're right at the very last part of
[1:18:14] that journey when you received a baptism
[1:18:16] of the holy ghost the spirit of adoption
[1:18:19] came down into your life and he's
[1:18:21] treated you and trained you and brought
[1:18:23] you through to bring you to your full
[1:18:25] adoption and we're right there but the
[1:18:27] thing is now we're at this point in the
[1:18:29] end of it all where this old nature
[1:18:31] where the devil is getting really upset
[1:18:34] because as you get higher in christ and
[1:18:37] as david rises up the devil is getting
[1:18:40] pulled out of his position the devil is
[1:18:42] getting torn out he can't do anything
[1:18:45] he's becoming slaughtered who likes that
[1:18:47] who's enjoying the fact that our dev
[1:18:49] that devil that enemy our enemy god's
[1:18:51] enemy he's being swatted he's being
[1:18:54] pulled down so he cannot function if
[1:18:57] he's still functioning in your life it's
[1:18:59] time for you to dethrone soul
[1:19:02] hallelujah
[1:19:03] it's time for soul to go you are the
[1:19:06] master of that decision god will not
[1:19:08] force it upon you but he is waiting for
[1:19:11] you to make that all sufficient decision
[1:19:15] to receive the all-sufficient grace of
[1:19:19] god oh my i just feel like jumping
[1:19:22] oh thank you jesus
[1:19:24] hallelujah if brahman can hear me can
[1:19:26] you please give me some water
[1:19:30] you know you don't think about these
[1:19:31] things
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:34] hallelujah
[1:19:36] and a towel
[1:19:39] i've got the window open
[1:19:42] need a fan
[1:19:44] the window is open
[1:19:46] very hot in here
[1:19:49] now
[1:19:51] and the woman answered oh
[1:19:53] so you see now we have this rising up
[1:19:56] amen and here the scripture in verse 9 1
[1:20:00] samuel 18 verse 9 it says and saul i'd
[1:20:04] david
[1:20:05] from that day
[1:20:07] so this there is a time thanks bro
[1:20:15] there's a time
[1:20:17] where as i was just saying
[1:20:20] rather loudly
[1:20:22] but i'll try and behave myself
[1:20:25] there was a time there is a time in all
[1:20:27] of our lives where a transition point
[1:20:29] happens
[1:20:31] where the the lord
[1:20:33] where
[1:20:34] your new nature
[1:20:36] where the david
[1:20:38] in you
[1:20:39] begins to overtake the soul
[1:20:42] amen
[1:20:48] now remember saul
[1:20:50] was was close to home
[1:20:53] it's close to home but he was the answer
[1:20:55] of the people's desire for a king not
[1:20:58] god's desire for a king you see god had
[1:21:01] chosen to soul for them based on what
[1:21:03] they wanted as a king
[1:21:07] so and god ascribed that to their choice
[1:21:10] because god could read their hearts and
[1:21:11] know their minds and know what they were
[1:21:12] thinking he knew what they actually
[1:21:14] wanted in their carnal understanding so
[1:21:17] he gave them that and he was a failure
[1:21:19] and he caused trouble
[1:21:21] yet
[1:21:22] he wasn't
[1:21:24] cast out of the kingdom of
[1:21:26] god there's a portion for him
[1:21:29] for when samuel was called up by the
[1:21:31] witch of endor he said that
[1:21:33] that tomorrow you shall be with me
[1:21:35] in paradise
[1:21:40] hallelujah amen isn't he wonderful
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:46] saul
[1:21:48] to re calibrate reiterate
[1:21:51] saul is your defeated old nature
[1:21:55] which rises up and revolt
[1:21:59] just before
[1:22:01] full adoption
[1:22:03] because of david
[1:22:04] and his revelation
[1:22:06] these are just my notes
[1:22:08] david is your new nature
[1:22:12] which is the one that's incr
[1:22:14] christ and god you and him and him and
[1:22:16] you remember it's still you but it's
[1:22:18] christ in you the hope of glory that's
[1:22:21] an anticipation for you to be glorified
[1:22:23] to come into your kinship to come into
[1:22:25] dominion with christ
[1:22:29] it's a hope and glory we read that oh
[1:22:32] it's so nice christ in you the hope of
[1:22:33] glory and you go over the real depth
[1:22:36] there is a real depth inside there
[1:22:39] hallelujah that in you hallelujah it's
[1:22:42] the hope of your
[1:22:43] full victory and it's locked up in david
[1:22:47] it's locked up in that new nature that
[1:22:49] will just come meekly to the throne of
[1:22:51] your life he's not going to force
[1:22:54] you see that's not the nature of god to
[1:22:56] force the devil or force the devil will
[1:22:59] try everything he can
[1:23:01] but god
[1:23:02] inside you christ in you the hope of
[1:23:04] glory
[1:23:05] you've got to let him you see he's not
[1:23:07] going to take the throne
[1:23:10] if you don't give it
[1:23:12] he's not going to force himself upon the
[1:23:14] throne
[1:23:15] but he will take it
[1:23:17] if you allow him and you dethrone saul
[1:23:24] david is your new nature anointed to
[1:23:27] bring full adoption in your life
[1:23:31] through the divine characteristics so
[1:23:34] trusted by god
[1:23:38] it's the new nature
[1:23:41] now
[1:23:42] i hope this doesn't go over too many
[1:23:43] heads here but pre-glorified
[1:23:46] you see david is a type of your
[1:23:48] pre-glorified nature you come to your
[1:23:51] adoption but you're not in a glorified
[1:23:52] body yet you're in a place where you can
[1:23:54] speak and things will happen but yet you
[1:23:56] can still make mistakes like david and
[1:23:59] we can get into that maybe another time
[1:24:01] where david brought the ark to on on the
[1:24:04] cart and he did it wrong you see and yet
[1:24:07] the intention and the whole prophecy
[1:24:09] around it is glorious and he knew it and
[1:24:11] yet he had done it wrong so you see even
[1:24:14] that's why when and brother branham you
[1:24:17] see when god said because brother
[1:24:19] branham came to this place where he
[1:24:21] could speak and it would happen he was
[1:24:22] back in eden condition and yet
[1:24:24] pre-glorified he wasn't he still it had
[1:24:28] to be god that said now tell those
[1:24:30] squirrels now do this it was still a
[1:24:32] submission to the ultimate
[1:24:35] of god
[1:24:36] you see but when we get into our
[1:24:38] glorified state it's going to be even
[1:24:40] higher it'll be the same nature but
[1:24:43] without this soul without this flesh
[1:24:46] without this corruption amen because
[1:24:48] this corruption shall be changed in a
[1:24:51] moment in a twinkling of an eye and
[1:24:53] you'll go from a pre-glorified condition
[1:24:56] which is what we're heading into just
[1:24:58] before the body change
[1:25:00] we're going into that now you will be
[1:25:02] subjected to the divine mind of god led
[1:25:05] by vision just like jesus subjected
[1:25:08] himself in that capacity as the son of
[1:25:11] man to to to be subjected to the father
[1:25:15] even though the father was in him and he
[1:25:17] was an expression of the father he
[1:25:19] subjected himself to a pre-glorified
[1:25:22] condition just like brother branham a
[1:25:24] redeemed man came to a pre-glorified
[1:25:27] condition and this is where we're going
[1:25:30] but yet you will be completely submitted
[1:25:33] to the vision of the father
[1:25:36] hallelujah
[1:25:39] for those of you that caught that you
[1:25:40] can have it that's very very good chew
[1:25:43] on it
[1:25:44] and enjoy it
[1:25:46] it's for you
[1:25:48] for those of you that didn't understand
[1:25:50] that
[1:25:50] you can listen to this again and study
[1:25:53] it out because it's a great thought
[1:25:55] but it's not something we want to dwell
[1:25:57] on too long in here but i just wanted to
[1:25:59] show you
[1:26:00] that david is that pre-glorified
[1:26:03] condition when he comes into full power
[1:26:06] in your life when soul is dethroned when
[1:26:08] all of those complexes that you struggle
[1:26:10] with is gone
[1:26:13] hallelujah
[1:26:18] david's rise was never forced
[1:26:21] israel's complete victory was hinging on
[1:26:24] the liberation and coronation of david's
[1:26:27] supreme power
[1:26:30] they couldn't access everything that
[1:26:32] joshua promised them until david was in
[1:26:35] power
[1:26:37] and david was a man after god's own
[1:26:39] heart
[1:26:40] with a beautiful vision with a vision of
[1:26:43] selfless care about people and the care
[1:26:46] of the will of god
[1:26:47] like nobody else
[1:26:49] that's the nature that god can trust he
[1:26:52] can't trust your selfish soul nature he
[1:26:54] can't trust your complexes he can't
[1:26:56] trust you when soul is ruling in your
[1:26:58] life that's why
[1:27:00] you get so defeated all the time
[1:27:03] that's why you fall all the time because
[1:27:05] saul hasn't been dethroned
[1:27:07] but it's time because david's rising
[1:27:09] even in the service david is rising you
[1:27:12] are feeding the white dog right now
[1:27:15] there's a crossover for you you can take
[1:27:17] it you can take it tonight whatever
[1:27:20] those things has been troubling you
[1:27:23] hallelujah
[1:27:25] dethrone it dethrone it stop harboring
[1:27:29] the devil
[1:27:31] and and you go oh how can he say the
[1:27:33] devil god can send devils
[1:27:36] you know that god can send evil spirits
[1:27:40] to trouble you
[1:27:43] because he wants you to dethrone the
[1:27:45] very thing that they're leveraging off
[1:27:47] i hope you caught that
[1:27:49] saw nature
[1:27:51] the devil comes to you set by god
[1:27:55] as a trial to exacerbate the soul nature
[1:27:58] in your life and you just throw it off
[1:28:01] and carry on don't do it
[1:28:04] take your opportunity call on the lord
[1:28:06] while he is near seek him while he may
[1:28:08] be found this is your time
[1:28:11] hallelujah
[1:28:13] stop basking in your soul nature and
[1:28:15] worshiping it
[1:28:17] it's not worth it
[1:28:19] for this is the season for total
[1:28:21] deliverance for an adoption
[1:28:23] give god the glory
[1:28:26] hallelujah
[1:28:27] because our david the david in our life
[1:28:29] is anointed to as a man after god's own
[1:28:33] heart to fulfill all the will of god
[1:28:38] that will is part of the inheritance
[1:28:41] to take everything that william
[1:28:42] branham's message promised
[1:28:44] all the statue of the perfect man all
[1:28:46] the fruits of the spirit all of whom you
[1:28:48] really are
[1:28:49] and all of your inheritance that adam
[1:28:52] lost
[1:28:53] the david inside you is anointed to
[1:28:55] bring that into your possession to be
[1:28:58] activated in your life to release your
[1:29:02] victory
[1:29:03] can everyone say victory
[1:29:14] amen
[1:29:16] oh my
[1:29:17] let's carry on
[1:29:20] the final blockage for david's
[1:29:22] coronation
[1:29:24] was saul
[1:29:26] and the consequent resistance of saul's
[1:29:28] house
[1:29:29] even mccall
[1:29:31] carried a negative narrative
[1:29:33] when it came to the dynamics
[1:29:36] of the pillar of fire and david's
[1:29:37] ministry
[1:29:39] of the ark coming back the ark
[1:29:41] represents the pillar of fire the the
[1:29:43] dynamics of the seventh seal the ark
[1:29:45] represents the power of god amongst the
[1:29:47] people
[1:29:48] the very the life that changes things
[1:29:52] and david was celebrating that and she
[1:29:54] criticized it
[1:29:57] she couldn't see the value
[1:29:59] oh my
[1:30:01] now that comes close to home you see
[1:30:04] because
[1:30:05] can you see the value of the seventh
[1:30:07] seal in your life can you see the value
[1:30:10] of that pillar of fire
[1:30:12] that has been given to the bride to take
[1:30:15] us through the land to take us on our
[1:30:17] journey
[1:30:20] you see the value
[1:30:30] mccall
[1:30:32] carried a negative narrative when it
[1:30:34] came to the dynamics of the pillar of
[1:30:36] fire
[1:30:37] it gets pretty close to home
[1:30:42] brothers
[1:30:44] it's not our wives
[1:30:46] it's all within
[1:30:48] so we don't want to go looking at our
[1:30:50] mccall's or our wives or our you know we
[1:30:53] can't look at that or anyone else in
[1:30:54] this matter it's all within
[1:30:57] it's all within our own kingdom it's all
[1:30:59] within our own heart it's all within
[1:31:01] their own life the kingdom of god is
[1:31:03] within you
[1:31:05] now saul fights
[1:31:07] the promotion of david here
[1:31:09] in one samuel 18 1
[1:31:12] it says and it came to pass
[1:31:14] when he had made an end of speaking unto
[1:31:16] saul
[1:31:18] that the soul of jonathan was knit with
[1:31:20] the soul of david and jonathan loved him
[1:31:22] as his own soul
[1:31:25] and saul took him that day and wouldn't
[1:31:28] would let him go no more home to his
[1:31:30] father's house
[1:31:32] see it was all well and good at the
[1:31:34] start
[1:31:35] because david was an asset and it's the
[1:31:37] same thing in your life you think man
[1:31:39] this is going so good then all of a
[1:31:40] sudden the very christ in you the hope
[1:31:42] of your glory the hope of the
[1:31:44] glorification of your life the hope of
[1:31:47] you coming into your adoption full
[1:31:49] adoption
[1:31:50] begins to start to rev to change things
[1:31:53] around and begins to appear and you
[1:31:55] realize my
[1:31:57] now i want you to i just want you to
[1:31:58] think this don't fight back at the
[1:32:01] challenge of your own faith
[1:32:04] it's all happening within now
[1:32:06] don't reason it away tonight
[1:32:10] don't deflect
[1:32:12] the fire that's meant for you
[1:32:14] to those that you love and care about
[1:32:18] don't pitchfork your portion
[1:32:21] even if you know
[1:32:23] it will be good for others you are
[1:32:25] burdened for and praying for
[1:32:27] there's enough for them and for you
[1:32:31] so i want you to take your change
[1:32:34] receive your
[1:32:37] blessing
[1:32:38] your fire tonight
[1:32:41] i want you to just carry we're going to
[1:32:43] carry on down the story in 1 samuel 18
[1:32:45] 10 it says and it came to pass on the
[1:32:47] morrow that the evil spirit from god
[1:32:51] came upon saul
[1:32:53] and he prophesied in the midst of the
[1:32:55] house
[1:32:56] and david played with his hand as at
[1:32:58] other times and there was a javelin
[1:33:01] in saul's hand
[1:33:03] now remember this
[1:33:05] this is an internal battle going on
[1:33:08] this is a battle going on and there are
[1:33:11] some people that go through this that
[1:33:13] i'm talking to tonight or maybe someone
[1:33:15] that's sitting on the table wherever
[1:33:17] you're at i guess everyone's on the on
[1:33:18] the internet tonight but
[1:33:22] where that old nature
[1:33:24] begins to give you suicidal thoughts
[1:33:27] begins to try and kill you begins to try
[1:33:30] and come at you because there is a fear
[1:33:33] or there's something going on a
[1:33:34] coalition with the devil but i want to
[1:33:36] tell you
[1:33:37] that true david he wasn't killed
[1:33:41] amen
[1:33:42] he was not killed because he was
[1:33:43] anointed to the throne he was anointed
[1:33:46] to kingship and i want to tell you in
[1:33:48] your life there is a part of you that is
[1:33:50] anointed to the throne that is anointed
[1:33:53] to kingship it cannot destroy you your
[1:33:56] own nature cannot destroy you though it
[1:33:58] may give you troubles though it may give
[1:33:59] you struggles it cannot overcome you
[1:34:02] hallelujah and every time that david was
[1:34:05] right there and that javelin was coming
[1:34:07] right at him and it probably only missed
[1:34:09] him by an inch but god got him out of
[1:34:11] there and he was an invincible part of
[1:34:14] the kingdom because there was a prophecy
[1:34:16] over his life and i want you to receive
[1:34:18] this there's a prophecy over your life
[1:34:21] as a rapture to be a king and a priest
[1:34:23] unto god to dwell with god eternally to
[1:34:26] be a tree that never goes brown that's
[1:34:29] always evergreen and planted by the
[1:34:31] lives of rivers of living water amen
[1:34:33] there's a promise over you there's a
[1:34:35] promise over you to be in victory
[1:34:37] there's a promise over you you've got
[1:34:39] the power tonight to dethrone saul
[1:34:44] hallelujah what's going on in your
[1:34:47] kingdom
[1:34:49] says here
[1:34:50] and saul cast the javelin for he said i
[1:34:53] will smite david even to the wall with
[1:34:55] it and david avoided out of his presence
[1:34:59] twice and saul was afraid of david
[1:35:02] because the lord was with him
[1:35:06] and was departed from saul
[1:35:09] amen
[1:35:11] there's a time where the glory
[1:35:13] that may have been helping you and just
[1:35:16] aiding you along and your and that old
[1:35:18] nature was going all right for a while
[1:35:20] like saul was and then it started
[1:35:22] causing trouble and then david started
[1:35:23] rising and then anointing of kingship
[1:35:26] left and it went on to the real part of
[1:35:29] you the real part of your life that's
[1:35:31] coming into kinship amen that part
[1:35:35] hallelujah
[1:35:38] but you see
[1:35:40] even if there's been many multiple
[1:35:42] suicide attempts
[1:35:44] the lord
[1:35:45] was still with david
[1:35:47] and he was still willing to deliver him
[1:35:50] from all of these things in his old
[1:35:51] nature that was working against him in
[1:35:53] coalition with the devil the evil spirit
[1:35:56] now you see that spirit of suicide see
[1:35:59] the lord will allow a demon to come down
[1:36:02] and stir that thing up
[1:36:05] because you see if it's hiding down in
[1:36:07] you and it's a family trait of
[1:36:09] depression or whatever it may be
[1:36:11] there has to come a time where that
[1:36:13] thing becomes exacerbated so that you
[1:36:15] can cast it down so that you can see to
[1:36:18] its end hallelujah
[1:36:22] amen so not even suicide
[1:36:26] was big enough to overcome the david
[1:36:29] coming to the throne amen not even the
[1:36:32] spirit of suicide that maybe struggling
[1:36:35] people have had in their life or have
[1:36:37] and are struggling with it
[1:36:40] it's not enough to defeat the coming
[1:36:42] king within you it's not enough to to
[1:36:45] stop you from coming to your adoption
[1:36:51] what's the time nine o'clock
[1:36:54] you're well welcome i've just got a
[1:36:56] couple more scriptures you're welcome to
[1:36:58] stand up and do a dance
[1:37:00] and sit back down if you're tired
[1:37:03] whoever's turning the cameras off is
[1:37:04] probably doing it
[1:37:07] everyone with the camera on is behaving
[1:37:08] themselves but you're allowed to dance
[1:37:11] amen
[1:37:12] hallelujah when it gets so intense
[1:37:16] the old nature
[1:37:18] even comes to the point of suicide but
[1:37:20] the lord will even allow a believer
[1:37:23] to struggle with evil spirits to ensure
[1:37:26] they dethrone saul
[1:37:28] there must be a complete dethroning of
[1:37:30] saul and complexes
[1:37:32] later after a soul is dethroned there
[1:37:35] must also be a removal of the
[1:37:37] sympathizing influence
[1:37:40] of saul's house in the kingdom
[1:37:42] within you
[1:37:44] these are
[1:37:46] learned behaviors
[1:37:48] bad habits
[1:37:52] you get yourself caught up in a group of
[1:37:54] people that are unsavory
[1:37:56] and you may have dethroned soul but
[1:37:58] those things begin to linger and you you
[1:38:00] know you've got to get rid of that stuff
[1:38:03] you've got to cast it away
[1:38:06] you've got to choose to allow david to
[1:38:08] come to the throne of your life
[1:38:11] so that he can cause you to come into
[1:38:12] your full inheritance
[1:38:14] amen
[1:38:16] hallelujah you know i'm so i'm really
[1:38:19] speaking to me as well so
[1:38:21] we're all in this together amen we pray
[1:38:23] for each other i'm tr i'm sure you pray
[1:38:25] for me
[1:38:26] oh yes hallelujah we'll go through
[1:38:29] battles
[1:38:30] but these battles are for our good
[1:38:33] hallelujah
[1:38:34] saul must be dethroned by you jesus
[1:38:37] won't do it he will take it but it must
[1:38:40] be available
[1:38:43] your free will who knows what veto means
[1:38:46] i hope you know what veto means
[1:38:48] veto is a political term in the world
[1:38:51] stage for
[1:38:53] or in any i think it's in any stage but
[1:38:55] it means two to to to to override
[1:39:00] that's too a decision is made by a
[1:39:02] certain country if there's there was i
[1:39:04] think there's five
[1:39:06] the big five countries that make
[1:39:08] decisions for the world stage i'm not
[1:39:10] going to name them all
[1:39:12] but
[1:39:14] if the if the major decision gets made
[1:39:16] on between these countries all five of
[1:39:18] them have to agree
[1:39:20] but if one of them doesn't then the
[1:39:22] whole things get annulled it cannot be
[1:39:24] done and it's an agreement
[1:39:26] so they call it veto
[1:39:28] and so
[1:39:30] the holy spirit will never
[1:39:33] override
[1:39:34] your free will
[1:39:36] at any stage of your life
[1:39:39] at any place no matter what you've
[1:39:41] previously prayed or said or agreements
[1:39:43] you've made
[1:39:45] the holy spirit will never override your
[1:39:48] free will
[1:39:50] you are the master of the discernment of
[1:39:53] your old nature
[1:39:56] and i'm telling you it's not easy to go
[1:39:59] and just throw your old nature
[1:40:01] it's not easy
[1:40:03] but that's why when i asked the lord and
[1:40:05] he gave me the ministry is a power to
[1:40:09] minister an entrance
[1:40:11] into the kingdom
[1:40:13] so there is and that that word minister
[1:40:16] in second peter is the same word for add
[1:40:20] to your faith virtue into your virtue
[1:40:22] knowledge into your knowledge temperance
[1:40:23] into your temperance godliness and are
[1:40:25] fire up until
[1:40:26] divine love
[1:40:28] it's a ministry
[1:40:30] so there is a power in you receiving
[1:40:33] ministry
[1:40:34] there's a power and though it says the
[1:40:36] foolishness of preaching it may not look
[1:40:39] like a big glorious thing it may look
[1:40:41] foolish
[1:40:43] but there is a power behind that that is
[1:40:45] there ready for you to be delivered
[1:40:47] right then and there under the sounding
[1:40:49] of the word
[1:40:51] you can cast down that old nature
[1:40:53] tonight
[1:40:54] you know i'm not just saying that in my
[1:40:56] own thing it's this is a reality
[1:40:59] but it has to come a moment when you
[1:41:00] know
[1:41:02] hallelujah
[1:41:06] you have to come to a gethsemane in
[1:41:07] these things
[1:41:08] the reason
[1:41:10] now there's a place there's a time now
[1:41:12] as david begins to come to his position
[1:41:15] the battles get a bit dirty saul becomes
[1:41:18] a bit more aggravated
[1:41:20] and you might come you might be in a
[1:41:22] season right now where you've never
[1:41:24] thought possible
[1:41:25] where you've come into such a place
[1:41:26] where there is so much troubles going on
[1:41:28] in your life
[1:41:32] don't think that you're all the way back
[1:41:34] at the start there's a reason for the
[1:41:36] season amen
[1:41:38] and saul saw and knew that the lord was
[1:41:40] with david that mccall sort of loved him
[1:41:43] and saul was yet the more afraid of
[1:41:45] david and saul became david's enemy
[1:41:48] continually and we know the rest of the
[1:41:50] story we're not going to go down that
[1:41:52] path any longer i'm going to take this
[1:41:55] the i'm going to down through my closing
[1:41:57] statements i'm about to close
[1:42:00] amen
[1:42:01] i want to now go
[1:42:04] back into a path of of of looking and
[1:42:06] focusing on david now that i've shown
[1:42:09] you saul and that old nature and how you
[1:42:11] can dethrone him i want to show you why
[1:42:15] god loved david why god would choose
[1:42:19] this man in this nature it's such a
[1:42:22] glorious thing and when i show you
[1:42:23] you're going to love it
[1:42:25] i know you already love it because it's
[1:42:27] the word and it's in you already all i'm
[1:42:30] doing is reminding you of what's already
[1:42:31] inside you all i'm doing is teaching you
[1:42:34] what's already uh inside you amen we're
[1:42:36] just having fellowship together and if
[1:42:38] you can receive this then the word
[1:42:40] inside you is enjoying it and it's and
[1:42:42] david's rising up and saul's coming to
[1:42:45] an end
[1:42:46] hey man who agrees with me who agrees
[1:42:49] that this we're in a battle and this
[1:42:50] battle amen is just an array hallelujah
[1:42:54] i'm glad that the battle's in array
[1:42:56] amen
[1:42:57] hallelujah i'm not glad for the
[1:42:59] suffering and the pain and all of this
[1:43:02] things that we go through but they are
[1:43:04] necessary if they weren't how can you
[1:43:07] dethrone something that you don't even
[1:43:08] know is there oh my heck
[1:43:13] when
[1:43:14] are we go why and these are questions
[1:43:16] that i asked i said why are we going
[1:43:18] through this
[1:43:19] why is there such a battle so late in
[1:43:21] the hour
[1:43:23] why the resurfacing of issues we thought
[1:43:26] were dealt with
[1:43:28] why suicidal thoughts
[1:43:31] why evil spirits
[1:43:35] here's
[1:43:36] why i'm going to just pinch the screen
[1:43:39] of time
[1:43:40] and we're going to go right out to a
[1:43:42] dispensational level here
[1:43:45] and i want to show you a picture that
[1:43:47] the lord showed me
[1:43:48] to explain
[1:43:50] what season we're in right now
[1:43:53] who believes that the lord has come down
[1:43:55] into your land to subdue the devil
[1:43:59] amen
[1:44:00] that he's come down in such a powerful
[1:44:03] way to bring you to a place where satan
[1:44:06] is completely bound by circumstances
[1:44:09] amen where he can't operate anymore he's
[1:44:12] got no say that is the the supreme
[1:44:15] vision and goal and that's what he has
[1:44:17] done for us
[1:44:19] even you can say in the time of joshua
[1:44:23] the bible declared that god had finished
[1:44:26] and done everything that he had promised
[1:44:28] and given them all the land god's side
[1:44:30] of it was sorted
[1:44:32] now
[1:44:33] that people just had to go get it
[1:44:37] there was a big journey ahead 400 years
[1:44:39] of all sorts of struggles and troubles
[1:44:41] but they finally got it when david was
[1:44:43] king
[1:44:45] you see
[1:44:47] that's the same thing now take that and
[1:44:49] put that inside you
[1:44:51] the same captain that came down to
[1:44:53] israel and set rahab free and was with
[1:44:56] them through the whole journey is the
[1:44:58] same captain the mighty angel of
[1:45:00] revelation 10 with an open book come
[1:45:03] down into your heart
[1:45:04] to do the same thing for you and to bind
[1:45:07] satan
[1:45:08] so that he cannot operate and the vision
[1:45:11] and the goal is that you eat the word
[1:45:13] and that you begin to prophesy again to
[1:45:15] all kindreds tongues and nations and and
[1:45:18] what it does is it pulls the devil out
[1:45:20] of his position he becomes thwarted and
[1:45:23] powerless so that you can live in your
[1:45:25] victory and release your victory
[1:45:27] but now i want to show you
[1:45:30] that you
[1:45:31] are a little miniature earth
[1:45:33] and you have received the baptism of the
[1:45:35] holy ghost and the lord has come down
[1:45:38] into your life
[1:45:39] and there is an unconverted body that
[1:45:42] you are learning how to rule and reign
[1:45:45] in this time
[1:45:47] now
[1:45:48] when we go in the rapture we get a
[1:45:51] glorified body and we go into the
[1:45:53] marriage supper and we spend three and a
[1:45:56] half years in the marriage supper
[1:45:58] rejoicing while jesus in his theophany
[1:46:00] form makes himself known to the jews
[1:46:03] through the moses and elijah and the 144
[1:46:07] 000 but then after that and i love this
[1:46:10] after that the lord after the battle of
[1:46:14] armageddon and the tribulation has
[1:46:16] finished
[1:46:17] and it's all been sorted and the count
[1:46:19] settled then we
[1:46:21] and the lord come down to the earth and
[1:46:24] it's the earth is receiving the same
[1:46:27] baptism that we got
[1:46:30] the lord himself comes down to jerusalem
[1:46:33] into the heart of the earth to subdue
[1:46:35] the devil and we are with him
[1:46:38] now that's a thousand-year millennial
[1:46:41] period where there's this great awesome
[1:46:44] time of rejoicing oh and we're ruling
[1:46:47] and reigning with christ over an
[1:46:48] unconverted earth
[1:46:51] but the earth got the holy ghost got
[1:46:53] baptized by fire and you are part of the
[1:46:56] spirit
[1:46:57] because it's both male and female coming
[1:47:00] down out of the marriage supper out of
[1:47:02] heaven the baptism of the holy ghost you
[1:47:04] could say come down to the earth to
[1:47:06] jerusalem to create a millennial
[1:47:09] condition
[1:47:10] and then after that and this is where
[1:47:12] the lord showed me i just wanted to say
[1:47:13] that so i can show you this
[1:47:15] after the thousand years was finished
[1:47:18] if anyone doesn't know this you can just
[1:47:19] study the millennium
[1:47:22] after the millennium was finished a
[1:47:23] thousand years was up what happened
[1:47:26] you see all those unconverted people all
[1:47:28] those natural people that were that we
[1:47:31] were rolling and reigning over
[1:47:33] they needed to be proved
[1:47:34] there needed to come a time where all
[1:47:36] those people that were strong that were
[1:47:39] the devil was bound by circumstance but
[1:47:41] there was people there that was not of
[1:47:43] god
[1:47:44] there were people there that were all
[1:47:46] over the earth that that were actually
[1:47:48] not part of the bride or part of the
[1:47:51] elect and you see when it wouldn't it
[1:47:53] was all going well and the earth was
[1:47:55] baptized with the holy ghost and and we
[1:47:57] were rolling and reading well we will be
[1:47:59] walling and reigning with christ a
[1:48:01] thousand years and and his peace on the
[1:48:03] earth all those people no matter whether
[1:48:05] they were good or bad they were all
[1:48:07] behaved because the devil couldn't do
[1:48:08] anything but right at the end when the
[1:48:10] thousand years was finished it said that
[1:48:13] the devil would be loosed a little
[1:48:14] season
[1:48:16] and what happened when the devil was
[1:48:18] loosed was all of those people begin to
[1:48:21] rise up in the devil it proved who was
[1:48:24] in there it proved that there was there
[1:48:26] was parts of that earth that was not
[1:48:28] elect it proved that there was devil
[1:48:30] people it proved that the earth still
[1:48:32] had a soul
[1:48:34] the earth still had a soul nature that
[1:48:36] needed to be riled up it needed to be
[1:48:39] exacerbated because then because it
[1:48:42] needed to be cleansed by fire
[1:48:44] and that is the same thing as we come
[1:48:47] we've received the baptism of the holy
[1:48:49] ghost he's put peace to the earth he's
[1:48:52] given us dominion but then right at the
[1:48:54] end just before we receive our glorified
[1:48:56] body just before we get our new heaven
[1:48:59] and new earth then comes
[1:49:02] trouble
[1:49:04] sorry for that funny face but trouble
[1:49:07] trouble comes and you think oh man have
[1:49:09] i not even got the holy ghost you've got
[1:49:10] the holy ghost
[1:49:12] but it's trouble because there's a soul
[1:49:14] that needs to be dethroned there's those
[1:49:16] last things in your life that just need
[1:49:18] to be sorted out and if it's all bells
[1:49:20] and whistles
[1:49:21] and all better roses how can that ever
[1:49:24] be exposed but i want to tell you that
[1:49:26] the reason you're going through these
[1:49:27] things don't be ashamed
[1:49:29] don't be ashamed if you've had suicidal
[1:49:31] thoughts don't be ashamed if you've gone
[1:49:33] through struggles don't be ashamed if
[1:49:35] you've had lust thoughts or whatever
[1:49:37] they may be it's time to dethrone it
[1:49:40] it's the only reason you're going
[1:49:41] through is because it needs to be
[1:49:42] dethroned amen because there's a david
[1:49:45] in you that's causing you to bring full
[1:49:48] inheritance of everything that's been
[1:49:50] promised you that is actually and i'm
[1:49:52] going to say this because you already
[1:49:54] know but i like to bring things to you
[1:49:56] remember it's already in you
[1:49:58] everything
[1:49:59] is already there it's in david it's
[1:50:01] locked up in your new nature and when he
[1:50:04] comes into power he begins to express it
[1:50:07] and all those last enemies begin to be
[1:50:09] dissolved
[1:50:10] hallelujah are you with me
[1:50:12] amen i'm just gonna i'm not gonna preach
[1:50:14] anymore amen i want to finish this and
[1:50:17] i'm sorry it's gone to 9 14. but you are
[1:50:19] in your homes this i'm just cashing in
[1:50:22] on the travel time so amen
[1:50:25] travel time
[1:50:26] hallelujah
[1:50:28] hallelujah
[1:50:29] romans 6 says here knowing this that our
[1:50:32] old man is crucified with him
[1:50:35] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:50:38] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:50:42] that word destroyed is to be put to a
[1:50:45] dormancy it's not an annihilation you
[1:50:49] see when you receive the baptism of the
[1:50:50] holy ghost it destroys the power of the
[1:50:54] enemy over you
[1:50:56] it doesn't remove the enemy
[1:50:58] you still have a fallen body that you
[1:51:01] contend with
[1:51:03] but you see it's been destroyed and then
[1:51:04] all of a sudden right at the end just
[1:51:06] before we get our new heaven and your
[1:51:08] earth just before we get our um
[1:51:10] glorified body all of a sudden there's
[1:51:12] these struggles it's because that nature
[1:51:14] needs the devil gets loosed a little
[1:51:16] seasoned just a little season it's
[1:51:18] because david is rising up so if you're
[1:51:21] going through things that you've never
[1:51:23] been through for a long time and you
[1:51:25] think my
[1:51:26] it's because david's rising up it's
[1:51:28] because the lord's appearing in your
[1:51:30] life it's because great things are
[1:51:32] happening in your life don't be ashamed
[1:51:34] to go through these things right now i'm
[1:51:36] just sharing these things with you
[1:51:37] because you will go through them because
[1:51:40] david's rising up because you're feeding
[1:51:42] the white dog because you're eating the
[1:51:43] word you're eating it and you're
[1:51:45] prophesying you're living a life
[1:51:47] hallelujah
[1:51:48] therefore david has to get stronger
[1:51:50] david rises up but now it comes a time
[1:51:53] when you have to make the decision
[1:51:55] shamelessly
[1:51:57] shamelessly
[1:51:59] sincerely be transparent in this hour
[1:52:02] this is why god has given us a church
[1:52:04] full of divine love because we can be
[1:52:06] transparent with each other we don't
[1:52:07] have to hide who we really are we don't
[1:52:09] have to hide our complexes we don't have
[1:52:11] to hide these things we can be honest
[1:52:13] and say lord i need this and go out for
[1:52:15] prayer talk about it share and pray with
[1:52:17] each other
[1:52:18] amen
[1:52:20] don't talk about each other's but talk
[1:52:21] about your own
[1:52:22] amen
[1:52:25] hallelujah
[1:52:27] confess your faults one to another pray
[1:52:29] for one another and you will be healed
[1:52:31] call the elders and get anointed with
[1:52:33] oil the same healing for your body is
[1:52:35] for your spirit
[1:52:36] because they're both subject to the fall
[1:52:39] and they both need healing
[1:52:41] amen and god's testing you to see how
[1:52:43] you rule over your own life
[1:52:46] amen
[1:52:49] hallelujah
[1:52:51] god says this about david and now this
[1:52:53] is the rest of this is all about why
[1:52:55] david
[1:52:56] and i know isaac's gonna like this
[1:52:58] because he likes david
[1:53:00] it says god says this to david i have
[1:53:03] found david
[1:53:04] the son of jesse
[1:53:06] a man after my own heart which shall
[1:53:08] fulfill all my will
[1:53:11] and one samuel
[1:53:13] oh my eyes
[1:53:15] uh one samuel 16 i think it is 11 12 and
[1:53:18] 13 it says in samuel said unto jesse
[1:53:21] i hear all thy children
[1:53:24] and he said
[1:53:25] they remaineth yet the youngest
[1:53:27] you know that word youngest if you've
[1:53:28] ever looked in the real meaning of that
[1:53:31] it means the least important
[1:53:33] the lesser the minimum
[1:53:36] yet the very success this is my words
[1:53:38] now of israel's future
[1:53:41] can you think about that the very least
[1:53:44] the very smallest the one that they
[1:53:47] thought was nothing and he probably
[1:53:48] didn't have the genetics there's even
[1:53:51] some ideas that david you know there was
[1:53:53] other he had a different mother than the
[1:53:56] others and things like that and so he
[1:53:57] was this black sheep
[1:53:59] so i've done a bit of research on the
[1:54:01] history of david and
[1:54:02] i'm just so blown away by that and it
[1:54:06] says here
[1:54:07] and he said and he says and samuel said
[1:54:09] unto jesse
[1:54:10] i know and he says he and he's yet the
[1:54:12] youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep
[1:54:14] and samuel said unto jesse send him
[1:54:16] fetch him for we will not sit down until
[1:54:18] he comes here
[1:54:20] and he sent and brought him in now he
[1:54:23] was ruddy
[1:54:24] and with all of a beautiful countenance
[1:54:27] and goodly to look to
[1:54:30] and the lord said arise anoint him this
[1:54:33] is he
[1:54:34] hallelujah and i want to tell you anoint
[1:54:36] him amen
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:39] anoint david
[1:54:42] give him worship
[1:54:44] don't give your old new nature worship
[1:54:46] but give jesus worship
[1:54:48] give the the very jesus the christ and
[1:54:51] you
[1:54:51] anoint him give him preeminence
[1:54:55] hallelujah
[1:54:57] it says here
[1:54:59] then samuel then samuel took the horn of
[1:55:01] oil and anointed him in the midst of his
[1:55:03] brethren and the spirit of lord came
[1:55:05] upon david from
[1:55:08] that
[1:55:10] day forward
[1:55:12] so samuel rose up and went to rhema
[1:55:19] says here
[1:55:23] now this is a translation of the same
[1:55:25] one samuel 16 12
[1:55:28] and i don't know what translation it is
[1:55:30] to sorry but it was one that um
[1:55:37] it just means because the king james the
[1:55:39] language there it changed not changes it
[1:55:41] but it makes it
[1:55:43] sound different because of the way they
[1:55:44] used to talk and actually when you read
[1:55:47] it in this
[1:55:48] modern terminology you could say
[1:55:51] it says this and it talks about a king
[1:55:53] with a huge heart
[1:55:55] and a kind selfless vision
[1:55:59] think about that
[1:56:00] here's this boy that locked up inside
[1:56:03] him here's this nature in your life
[1:56:06] right
[1:56:07] don't look at what you are what you you
[1:56:09] can see yourself as what you fail at
[1:56:12] don't look at that right now look at the
[1:56:14] david inside you look at what jesus says
[1:56:17] well this is what this is what the
[1:56:19] scripture portrays here a king with a
[1:56:22] huge heart
[1:56:25] and kind
[1:56:26] selfless vision
[1:56:30] yet despised by man
[1:56:32] and exalted by god
[1:56:35] and he sent and this is the scripture
[1:56:37] that was my notes and he sent and
[1:56:39] fetched him
[1:56:41] and he was ruddy with beauty of eyes
[1:56:45] and very goodly to behold and the lord
[1:56:47] said to samuel rise and anoint david for
[1:56:49] he is good
[1:56:51] now that word beauty of eyes
[1:56:54] means he's got a beautiful vision
[1:56:57] and a man after god's own heart
[1:57:00] you see god the real you and god sees
[1:57:02] you and what's inside you the potentials
[1:57:05] is a man after god's own heart with a
[1:57:07] beautiful vision selfless caring about
[1:57:10] the bigger picture caring about the will
[1:57:12] of god
[1:57:13] that's the real you
[1:57:15] the real you you might not see that in
[1:57:18] your daily behavior you might not see
[1:57:20] that when you fail and you're down on
[1:57:22] the ground and the devil's tormenting
[1:57:24] you
[1:57:25] but that's what you really are and
[1:57:27] that's what is coming into power in your
[1:57:30] life as we speak
[1:57:32] and when you
[1:57:34] i'm not saying you haven't dethroned
[1:57:35] saul because there's many parts of our
[1:57:37] lives that have been dethroned but
[1:57:39] there's still things to follow
[1:57:41] there's still things to come to be
[1:57:43] dethroned and tonight you can dethrone
[1:57:45] them so that that beautiful vision and
[1:57:47] that beautiful countenance and that
[1:57:49] whole
[1:57:50] holistic nature of david that god trust
[1:57:53] and that god loved can come into power
[1:57:56] in your life
[1:57:57] and lead and guide you and be the very
[1:58:00] part of you so that god can give you the
[1:58:03] spoken word
[1:58:05] because the spoken word can only be
[1:58:07] given to a person where that nature is
[1:58:10] king
[1:58:12] and look what brother branham had to go
[1:58:14] through for that to happen and i don't
[1:58:16] want to put my hand up for that type of
[1:58:17] suffering and i don't think we have to
[1:58:18] go through all of that there will be
[1:58:20] some people that do that's up to the
[1:58:22] lord not up to us but that's up to god
[1:58:25] but there is a word that's been released
[1:58:27] like the captain's word release rahab
[1:58:30] there is a word that's been released
[1:58:32] through a prophet
[1:58:33] and his message to bring us to a place
[1:58:36] where we can receive that through the
[1:58:38] power of god through the dynamics of the
[1:58:40] holy ghost through the dynamics of
[1:58:42] powerful church meetings so i encourage
[1:58:44] you respect the ministry respect the
[1:58:47] five-fold ministry re receive from it
[1:58:50] and do your utmost endeavor to keep the
[1:58:53] unity of the spirit in the
[1:58:55] in the in the bonds of peace and come to
[1:58:58] church with a right attitude throw down
[1:59:01] all those old ways and negative thinking
[1:59:03] all you're doing is ruining the service
[1:59:05] for everyone but you see there's a david
[1:59:07] in you that will never do it
[1:59:09] and if you just dethrone that thing
[1:59:13] tonight
[1:59:14] don't let it don't let saul reign any
[1:59:16] longer
[1:59:18] just bring him down he's ready to come
[1:59:20] down he's ready
[1:59:23] david's ready to rise
[1:59:25] to seize the everlasting prize
[1:59:28] what's in david and this is my writing
[1:59:31] and then we're going to close
[1:59:33] a relentless pursuit
[1:59:35] of victory
[1:59:37] a secure faith in god's deliverance
[1:59:40] a heart of honor
[1:59:43] a prayer warrior
[1:59:45] a worshiper of god
[1:59:48] a powerful leader
[1:59:50] overcoming power
[1:59:52] godly perspective which could bring the
[1:59:55] ark of the covenant to jerusalem
[1:59:59] to fulfill all
[2:00:01] god's will
[2:00:04] let's close our eyes
[2:00:07] if you're with somebody
[2:00:10] then i just want you let's just all pray
[2:00:12] together and
[2:00:13] i want you not to pray for yourself in
[2:00:15] this case for some reason i don't
[2:00:17] understand why but
[2:00:19] just put your hand on someone next to
[2:00:20] you if it's appropriate
[2:00:22] and
[2:00:23] and we'll just pray for each other
[2:00:25] and just pray that we'll receive
[2:00:27] strength
[2:00:29] to let david reign in our lives
[2:00:32] lord jesus father you've i believe you
[2:00:35] gave us this thought and i know there's
[2:00:37] a lot in it lord and i pray you take up
[2:00:38] all these chopped words and and bring
[2:00:40] them together lord and i pray lord that
[2:00:43] what was for each person would be
[2:00:44] received for myself lord i really pray
[2:00:47] with all my heart
[2:00:49] that that you would
[2:00:51] father
[2:00:53] bring us all lord jesus to a place where
[2:00:56] we can really receive from you and walk
[2:00:59] in the revival that is our portion to
[2:01:01] have glorious church services to throw
[2:01:03] down the devil and all of his antics and
[2:01:05] all of the lies and all the fears and
[2:01:07] the failures and the family spirits and
[2:01:09] all of that stuff and dethrone it out of
[2:01:11] our lives lord to just thrown it out of
[2:01:13] our church the lord when the individual
[2:01:15] dethroned saul the church dethroned saul
[2:01:18] when the individual get walks in victory
[2:01:20] the church walks in victory when the
[2:01:22] individual lord is falling down the
[2:01:24] church falls down because we're a body
[2:01:26] we're together we're one family in
[2:01:28] christ and we're part of a body and yet
[2:01:31] we're individual
[2:01:32] and so i pray lord as the kingdom of god
[2:01:35] is within us i ask in jesus name for
[2:01:38] your anointing for your victory power to
[2:01:40] release the victory
