our lives into your hands in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean god bless you thank you about the Andy thinking musicians I mean good evening everyone I mean if you've got your arm you've got your Bibles handy let's turn to John 17 quite a lengthy scripture reading but we're just going to read most of most of John 17 from from verse 1 this is these words these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him and this is he this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do and now O Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I will I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gave us me out of the world thine they were and thou and thou gave us them me and they have kept thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee for I have given unto them the words which thou gave us me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou descend me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine a vine and thine and mine and I'm glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to the Holy Father keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that they gave us me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves I have kept I have given them my word in the Heita them because they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but there should us keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth amen may the Lord bless us would you may have your seats tonight I mean I just want to you know we're approaching the Lord's table tonight and you know we know it's more than that's not a tradition that's not something we do every so often to fulfill the duty but there's something very special when a believer makes a public declaration of who they are you know when we when we approach the table we'll go into it a bit later on but you know you are by taking the bread and taking the taking the wine which are symbolic of the Lord's body and blood you are declaring to everyone here you've become one with him and if you've become one with him your life is very different to what it once was it is not the your old life you are living a new life right it's his life and you manifesting right and so now it says here in in John 17 13 and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves now the joy that was sitting for the Lord the joy that was set before him was you redeemed right he endured the cross despising the shame and sit down the right hand of the Majesty on high because of the joy that was set before him right which was you redeemed so now he's saying that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves so his joy was you around the throne his joy was you redeemed his joy was you made in his image his joy was himself in a people right his joy was his bride I mean becoming one with him that was his joy his joy was taking people and manifesting his life through that people upon the earth his joy was having a people that out of their own free will they would gladly give themselves to him I mean that they would become loved prisoners of Jesus Christ they wouldn't do it out of Judea because of a teaching but because of a relationship that they had entered into I mean that they would do this this walk we have with God is all the relationship right and how we treat others and how we treat the Lord is really based on what we see our relationship being right if we see him as rules and as as a as they mean God that beats us down that's how we will respond back to him will respond out of fear and and you know we won't walk in confidence out of how what he's made us to be right but if he has revealed himself his love has become manifest in our lives I mean that the word he he becomes a living reality in us then we'll respond ever father my father my father where once under the slavery of sin and bondage a me but then but then he came I mean he he filled us with His Holy Spirit work right where we have received the spirit of adoption the placing of a child in the body right so where we cry Abba Father my father my father so when when that Amen comes upon the seat of God they look at God and look at themselves very differently because once we were aliens Amen from the Commonwealth of God we we were his enemy the scripture tells us but then something happened he happened the Spirit of Truth happened Amen all right and then you begin to see life very differently hallelujah it was not someone else's testimony it became your testimony it wasn't someone else's story or the Bible was just a historical book written to someone else it became a personal love letter to you hallelujah so now this is what God wanted us to have that his joy that my joy they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves hallelujah amen now he says here he has given us his word and we have kept his word a mint we have kept his word by the spirit of truth that's in us that's how the word has kept it's not by our nobility our mental gymnastics it's God's Spirit in us caused us to keep his word now we have received spiritual strength in this day right we have received strength to overcome the world the devil everything in it we have received overcoming power amen we are not a beaten-down group of people I mean the brightest victorious the bride is an overcoming group that means we have to fight there'll be a battle there'll be hard times they'll be clothes scrapes but we'll overcome I mean we're anointed to overcome I mean just as these scribes and Pharisees were anointed to doubt and reject so the disciples were anointed to receive him Amen and they overcame in their age every overcome every believer through the scripture they had something to overcome and they overcame right Caleb and Joshua overcame they overcame the doubts and evil reports of the other spies they believed that God had given them the land and that's what caused them to overcome the faith and the promised word of their day caused them to overcome right Caleb when he heard Moses preaching he knew was more than Moses speaking and was God giving him a promise and a soul was anchored on that promise amen and it became a living reality in his life because he possessed he and his inheritance he overcame the doubts he overcame the murmuring he overcame everything that was bad in the camp he just saw a promise and he was walking towards that promise Amen I believe it should be the same thing with us I mean that everything else just should just fade away we should just see the promise of God I knew when Abraham's life was written up in Romans 4 it said he staggered not at the promise of God was strong giving price I mean he was fully persuaded that God was able to perform that which he had promised Polyana has come the same with you and I but we don't worry about the situation we don't worry about the obstacles and what the enemy may be doing but God has sent as sure word of prophecy goddess into the show word from Russia I mean we know where we're going we know who we are hallelujah do you know who you are in him for you and darkness hallelujah I don't believe we're in darkness I know I'm a son of Jesus Christ I mean I know because he called me he chose me before the foundation of the world he made himself known to me I'm now a new creature in him hallelujah so I know where I came from and I know where I'm going hallelujah now it's just a walk of faith through the in-between time hallelujah say well there's a lot of them between time not according to Eternity it's just a vapor this life is a vapor and it's gone you ever seen some vapor go oh we're Decker I don't know hallelujah life is but a vapor we have eternity to enjoy and we have all God upon the earth with us now amen so we have to know and I believe we do know who we are Jesus had faith and who he was he said for this cause I've come into the world as as God's provided sacrifice he knew he was the Messiah he wasn't doubting he wasn't questioning he knew who he was right and it should be the same thing with us by our new birth a real birth I mean you know when when a baby's born life was produced I mean something happens I mean everyone involved knows about it they were there doesn't matter if it's the easiest birth of the hardest birth it's burst life comes a new life now enters the house that was once just maybe talked about maybe felt the legs kick in all these things and you know what's he or she gonna look like maybe you can get a scan to see well this is you know this is this is what they might look like but it's very different when you're actually holding that life when the life becomes a reality it becomes a very different and now this life starts living and now you're because you've got to protect this life you got to see it grow you've actually got a your life is actually dick hated to buy this little few kilos of life but even even a woman that's pregnant she walks different ways she eats different things I mean cuz he's a life in her dictating Torah watch you should eat what she should not eat why she should do what she should not do because she's waiting to protect this life that's growing and it should be the same thing with us life comes in so saying this morning the things you once did you don't do amen and the things you do I mean you never used to do what's happened a life is coming hallelujah and now you're a different person now we have been given as I said before we've been given spiritual power to overcome I mean through his word through his word that's been revealed it gives us spiritual strength to overcome this world to overcome the enemy right when he comes into our life it's the enemy that gets defeated it's no longer us I'm gonna read a couple of Scripture I want this to mean a lot say Lord me but he chose you as the scripture says I think someone said it in their blessing for for Hannah you know Jesus says that you didn't choose me I chose you and as the same through every generation we did not choose God we thought we were chasing after him actually no he was chasing after us when Adam and Eve fell in the garden they had themselves when God came down God was hunting for his children to redeem them back to where they should be and it's been all the way down through the scripture God has been hunting his children hallelujah I'm glad he chased me down I'm glad he found me and he chases us down because those want to leave us in the state maroon he wants to lift us up he wants to lift us up that we are joint heirs with him hallelujah so now we're gonna go to Ephesians chapter 2 which I did quote this morning [Music] read from verse 1 a new healthy quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins we're and in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience this is we were all this way among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others but God basically at one time we did what we wanted its own lust of the flesh lust of the mind we just did what we wanted you know the biggest problem was when someone says I will sins started with two words in heaven in the heart of Lucifer I will I will ascend I will I will rise above what I should be well God has made me to be that's where sin started two words in the mind of a angel and it's now it's upon the earth and that's the biggest problem is when we say I will no it shouldn't but the answer to that is not my will but thy will be done Jesus showed us how to overcome not my will not the desires of my flesh or my mind but his will but God who's Richard mercy and he's very Richard mercy for in his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are safe divine influence upon the heart and the reflection and the life amen we were dead now we've been quickened who's been quickened I know it's hot in here I know I've had a long day beliefs rejoice I mean listen let's be thankful you know pit yo-yo I've heard someone say well God's not deaf you don't need to shout but you can't defin him at the same time okay and he's raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus as the believers position in Christ joint is with him a minute just like the devil remember the devil was an angel now he's a fallen angel angels are servants they are not sons and daughters of God you take a royal family who has more authority with the king and queen a servant or the children of the Prince or the princess they have more I mean because they're in the family this is the bloodline continuing it's more important than a servant it's the same thing now with us we have God's children by His grace we have more authority I mean then then then even the Archangels with God because we're family we're not servants right he loves his family more than his servants and the devil was once a servant now he's a fallen servant he got fired right so now he's just a problem to the company yeah so why would he have to worry about he's raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus then in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus amen for by grace are ye saved through faith and that is not of yourselves as a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship who's being worked on hallelujah the working starts he will perfect keep working on me Lord it's like a sculpture you know that marble could feel something you would know you know when the sculptor takes a you know the chisel and the hammer and whatever more that marble would say I don't want to be hit by it it doesn't feel too good wait till you're done and then I'll show you a mirror you'll enjoy you'll enjoy what you really look like it's the same thing with us that your God takes us wirdy checks us and deals if you know you got a temper you're unforgiving you got this and this and all you shouldn't have said that you did this wrong and and what happens he's going to take his chisel his hammer hallelujah he wants to work on you amen but he's got a mirror he wants you he it was to reflect listen you I'm glad we're his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them oh I'm glad our walk has been ordained wherefore remember that you were being in times past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise without hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus you who are sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ the blood puts us back on speaking terms with God hallelujah for he is our peace we're just going to read two more I like the book of Ephesians it's hard just to read it but you know it's all good you know for he is our peace who has broken I mean sue who hath made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us so he is our pcs made both one he's made us one with himself amen having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one you man so making peace let's just keep reading down to verse 18 and that he might reconcile both undergone in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them which were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father hallelujah I mean I'm glad I'm glad that is true now the Lord chose us I believe in election I thank God for election because if there was an election then a be our merit I have nothing to give you know people say well god I've done this I've done this I've done this but then you have to give you bad you can't just give the good party see I forgot to give all the bad and all the good and try and give it to me and he says I don't want it because because our righteousness but filthy rags I'm glad it's not I'm glad it's election he chose me hallelujah and if he chose me there's a reason he chose me amen and I'm glad there's no merit of myself I mean I'm glad there's no merit of myself because otherwise it's certain IQ certain whatever whatever you know this criteria there's only one criteria you have been chosen before the foundation of the world can't we rejoice in that fact how we rejoice I believe we can amen now we read an exodus it's got Exodus 12 we won't be too much longer but now as I said before God's given us power to overcome I mean through him we will overcome this world we are more than Paul said we're more than conquerors through him that loved us Paul knew what it's like to have a bad day right he ended up in jail he got beaten he got shipwrecked he got stoned he all kinds of things happened to him be seized I'm more than a conqueror hallelujah he knew what he was talking about I mean he was under your pirogue by faith rather than all different kinds of things we said I'm more than a conqueror hallelujah and then also in his darkest moment there in thee was that the man Mateen prison river he was before he got beheaded he says he's a crown of life waiting for me that's someone that's overcoming that someone is not looking at circumstance that's someone who's loving true to the promise true to us Commission amen Exodus 12 and now it says let's read from from verse four and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of souls every man according to his eating shall ye count for your lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it from the Sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the self I mean of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and the upper doorpost of the house ruin they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat it not raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the Ferdinand parts thereof and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus show you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste this is the Lord's Passover now this was the the children of Israel he took the communion and type they left Egypt by the power of the Lamb right the blood was applied they were safe from the Death Angel but they became one with that lamb they sacrificed they became one with it as I've said I know I say it every time but you know if you took a typical house there you see a lamb and you see a people then you see a house and then the lamb gets killed and they see someone apply blood and then and then they eat the lamb then they walked out so they became one with their sacrifice they became one with the atoning blood that that was there that the death and you couldn't strike them the very life I mean the very animal that they sacrificed that kept them safe from the Death Angel they became one worth and they walked out of Egypt under the strength of that lamb by the strength of that physical food right that physical sacrifice they took that and they walked out of Egypt just like if you don't eat you're not going to be strong you're gonna wear out you to get tired right better and then if you eat junk food is not going to help you all that much you may put on some weight but you know it's not going to give you the vitamins and strength you really need but if you eat a healthy diet amen then you'll be all right hallelujah and the healthiest diet I know is the Word of God I'm in the full that's why I said you got to take the whole lamb roaster with bitter herbs even the pertinent parts there off and you got to eat it she would eat the wonderful parts of the wreck and the whatever all the nice parts of the lamb and the bad parts what you think is the bad parts but God obviously thought you-you-you need the whole word Jesus is our Passover right here's our sacrifice and so they they left Egypt under the strength of their atonement amen and now we are not eating a physical lamb but we have to become one with our sacrifice and this is very vital in this age where it goes from just the life that was there on Calvary Jesus died his blood was shed and in the life is in the blood the scripture tells us and his life was released that down Calvary and the invoker in the Upper Room received that life so they became one with their sacrifice because the life that was in the sacrifice came into them and then they're very works and the life that was in display and the Messiah was now displayed in them and that was the proof they became one with this sacrifice right there was more than just a confession it was a reality the life they lived proved they became one with him right because even the scribes and Pharisees noted that these men had been with Jesus because the same miracles the same life that was lived in the Messiah was now in his church was Balan his brightness and that was the proof they had become one with him that was the periphery use today's language that they had received Jesus into their hearts what give your heart to Jesus well that's going to have a manifestation that's good you got to give your heart to him but he's going to come receive your faith and come and live in you yes hello I'm glad he does amen so now we they became one with the lamb in the Exodus and that Exodus amen and as the as the yo the church had a spiritual exodus from the traditions of man into the Living God right they became one with their sacrifice in order to make that Exodus now in this third Exodus where people are leaving this world I mean and going into heaven you have to become one with him as well right you can't go by association or by argument or by creed you must become with the living Lord Jesus Christ I mean that his life has to come unto you amen that's how you know the blood has really been applied to your life is because his life comes unto you and live oh I'm glad that that is the case I mean and and brother Bram says the token is he that is the token that is showing that your price has been paid you're on your way amen that you're on your way it's like you know you can't go jump on an airplane with just the money you can go to the boarding counter you know or you can try and go and check in they say do you have your tickets well here's the mattings i say no you can't get on this plane you need the ticket but I have the money no you need to ticket right and it's the same thing if the life of God is in you that is your ticket to eating get on the plane or get on the gospel ship or the gospel train what do you want to talk you know whatever analogy you want that's going to go to heaven that is your the proof that you're on your way that your destination is settled because you're sealed into the kingdom that's how glorious it is isn't it wonderful maybe I should make us so relaxed in him jesus paid it all I received it all my way I'm on my way to heaven shouting I mean because he won the victory for me hallelujah glory to God now I'm glad so we have and so that's why this is just symbolic we know it doesn't literally turn into his blood and and his flesh but it's symbolic Jesus sees in John 6 that's just - and they quickly and we'll read we'll read from verse 52 or even verse 48 at John 6 I am that Bread of Life your father's deep met did eat manna in the wilderness and I did this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I'll raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is the bread that came down from heaven not as your father's did eat manna and I did he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever he's saying you have to become one with your sacrifice you have to become one where it's not you and your sacrifice but you become one right and we know that what he's meaning is you have to become one with him his life has to come in you and that that is how you live forever hallelujah you say well what what does this have to do with the communion let's go to 1st Corinthians 11 let's read from verse 2023 he says for I have received of the Lord that also which I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup which he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me so he's saying that these are these are symbolic of my body and my blood and what happens now is when you when you take of the bread and the wine the body of the Lord in in symbolic form you are giving a declaration that you have become one with him and his life is living out of you this is what you're telling everyone here you're saying I have become a Christian because he's in me right and the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God I mean this is this is why it's a rejoicing time because he paid it all he washed us he's redeemed us we're on our way to heaven shouting victory right it's wonderful but then also he gave you everything for us he chose you he chose me who was I there were billions upon the earth when he found me and the people who mean to that I mean you know you'd think in your own mind why did he pick this rich when he picked someone else who's smarter or whatever or can put his ways to get the better I don't know someone who seems more qualified but he chose me and he had a purpose for choosing me and he had a purpose for calling and choosing you hallelujah Amen see so we're giving a public declaration I've become one with my lamb hallelujah and I'm walking through life's journey by the strength of the lamb I mean I am a Christian by the strength of the lamb not by anything else but by the strength of lamb the lamb is the word he's a living word amen so we are walking through this world by the strength of the Living Word made manifest in us hallelujah for us off this go to verse 26 for us off as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home then you come not
