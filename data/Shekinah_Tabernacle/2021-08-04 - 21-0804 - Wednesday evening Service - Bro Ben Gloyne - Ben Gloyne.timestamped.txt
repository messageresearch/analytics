[3:10] at the door
[3:12] come in and and come sit in the presence
[3:14] of the almighty god
[3:16] that's why we come here is to to draw
[3:18] strength
[3:20] to uh to take everything that keeps our
[3:22] heads busy and
[3:24] satan that tells us we're not good
[3:26] enough for long enough
[3:28] comes to tell us we can't do it says
[3:31] we're never going to be able to do it
[3:34] we just come to to rebuke him in the
[3:37] name of our lord jesus christ
[3:39] we come to tell him that we've come to
[3:42] spend
[3:43] even if it's just an hour on a wednesday
[3:45] night
[3:46] we're going to spend it in the presence
[3:48] of the lord
[3:49] there's a lot of places we can spend it
[3:51] but we choose
[3:52] to come here amen you're all welcome
[3:57] and maybe if you all stand we just open
[3:59] up in a word of prayer
[4:01] but wait for everyone to come in good
[4:04] evening all
[4:05] halloween god bless you brother i love
[4:08] brother bna he's always got that smile
[4:11] and it's all right even if you don't
[4:13] smile you still smile hey
[4:15] god bless you it's encouraging i was
[4:18] thinking today
[4:20] might not be on the topic at all but i
[4:21] was thinking of the young people in our
[4:23] church
[4:24] and just how on fire they are getting
[4:27] you know there's a lot of things
[4:29] happening that that
[4:30] not a lot of people are aware of but
[4:32] they they're just starting to all
[4:34] combined now and and you know what when
[4:37] i use this firing and
[4:39] the older ones we just keep pushing and
[4:41] we keep praying and
[4:42] and all of our children keep singing and
[4:44] at least our sisters
[4:46] you all why we you just keep singing
[4:49] don't ever stop
[4:50] singing you know because god likes to be
[4:52] worshiped
[4:53] he likes to be praised and he likes to
[4:55] be put first
[4:57] so keep going you see god will bless us
[4:59] for it
[5:00] don't give up don't stop because if you
[5:02] stop you can just as well drop
[5:05] what did i say in sunday school you
[5:07] might be that little cold that fell out
[5:09] the fire
[5:10] and you feel like you're getting cold
[5:12] and you know a bit separated from the
[5:14] heat and everybody is rejoicing and you
[5:16] might not feel you're rejoicing at all
[5:18] but all you need to do is just ask the
[5:20] lord to pick you up and throw you back
[5:22] in the fire
[5:23] and the only way you do it is by
[5:24] anointing the word saying amen
[5:27] agreeing and adding your lack of fire
[5:30] amen
[5:31] let's just open in a word of prayer our
[5:34] gracious heavenly father lord
[5:36] you are worthy lord you are worthy of
[5:39] all the praise
[5:41] lord as each one of us go and we reflect
[5:44] on our lives lord and we look back
[5:46] at how we used to be a lord we might
[5:49] look at
[5:50] what we really want to be or maybe not
[5:53] want to be
[5:53] lord we know that every day in our life
[5:56] you are dealing with us lord
[6:00] lord we might not see the end result and
[6:02] it might be hurt and it might be
[6:04] a time of jubilee but lord you're
[6:07] dealing with each one of us
[6:10] lord even if we sit on the shelf and we
[6:11] feel like a little bit of dust is
[6:13] settling on us lord
[6:14] lord there's a purpose for us because
[6:16] we're on your shelf
[6:18] there's a reason you chose us and you
[6:20] brought us here lord it's because
[6:22] you chose us lord no man seeks after god
[6:25] lord
[6:26] and we thank you for it lord and i pray
[6:29] that we'll all just have a bit of a
[6:31] testimony service tonight
[6:33] if we can lord and just walk a bit with
[6:36] you and say thank you for all you've
[6:38] done in our lives how you turned us
[6:40] around
[6:41] from a certain death lord death
[6:42] eternally separated from you lord
[6:45] we were all bound that way but then
[6:48] grace
[6:49] lord unmerited grace found our way
[6:52] lord and none of us are able to
[6:55] to come to that level lord of perfection
[6:59] only you can get us there lord so we

[30:48] mum-in-law here god bless
[30:50] you love you privilege to have you with
[30:52] us thank you so much
[30:54] amen let's um just so before we go to
[30:57] the
[30:58] message the portion of the fifth seal
[30:59] we're gonna listen to i just wanted to
[31:01] uh read read it here and just
[31:05] quickly give a quick background because
[31:07] it's
[31:08] difficult to find a portion where
[31:09] brother bram covers everything
[31:11] and i hope you have listened to it all
[31:14] before you've come today
[31:15] so we're going to go to revelation 6 and
[31:17] 9 and we're going to read down to
[31:19] verse 11. i'm just going to give a brief
[31:21] overview
[31:23] um you know i got a i got a whatsapp
[31:25] message couple of photos
[31:27] from my brother moses and from whitbank
[31:29] there in south africa
[31:31] and um he's doing some outreach in a new
[31:33] area he says
[31:34] there's an old brother who just got
[31:36] baptized a few days ago
[31:38] or a week ago saying and he's gone to be
[31:40] with the lord
[31:41] so he says now we so we baptized him now
[31:43] we're going to bury him
[31:44] so i said to him the lord's timing's
[31:46] perfect
[31:48] you know so praise the lord you know
[31:49] even just that brief window hey how
[31:51] great is the grace of the lord
[31:53] amen that that soul he was ready to go
[31:55] meet him
[31:56] amen praise the lord so i trust we're
[31:58] all in that condition
[32:00] we're ready to meet him amen so
[32:03] revelation 6 and 9 it says and when he
[32:05] had opened the fifth seal
[32:07] i heard under the altar the souls of
[32:09] them that were slain for the word of god
[32:11] and for the testimony which they held
[32:13] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[32:15] how long o lord holy and true
[32:17] does that not judge and avenge our blood
[32:19] on them that dwell on the earth
[32:21] and white robes were given unto every
[32:23] one of them and it was
[32:24] said unto them that they should rest for
[32:26] yet a little season
[32:28] until their fellow servants also and
[32:29] their brethren that should be killed
[32:32] should be killed as they were should be
[32:35] fulfilled now
[32:37] just just very quickly uh if you
[32:40] remember from the first four seals
[32:42] there's a beast that says come and see
[32:44] and the fourth seal the voice of the
[32:46] fourth bc come and see
[32:47] says the anointing of the cherubim or
[32:49] the holy ghost which announces or goes
[32:51] to combat the antichrist move
[32:53] but in this fifth seal there's no beast
[32:55] to announce what the seal is so
[32:57] what this represents is actually the
[32:58] gentile time is over
[33:01] so so this is speaking now of actually
[33:04] of the jews
[33:05] right so and we can see it's the jews
[33:08] because
[33:09] there's a cry from these ones from verse
[33:12] 10
[33:12] i know sorry from verse 9 it says and
[33:15] for the test so the slain for the word
[33:16] of god and for the testimony which they
[33:18] held but
[33:19] it does not say that they have the
[33:20] testimony of jesus christ
[33:22] if you go look at revelations one the um
[33:25] john was on the other patmos for the
[33:26] testimony of jesus christ so these ones
[33:29] are there for the because of the
[33:30] testimony
[33:31] i mean for the word of god for the
[33:32] testimony which they held there's no
[33:33] record of them ever
[33:35] being a testimony for the lord jesus
[33:36] this is jews and we can see even in
[33:38] their hearts cry from verse 10
[33:40] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[33:42] how long o lord holy and true
[33:44] does thou not judge and avenge our blood
[33:45] on them that dwell on the earth this is
[33:47] crying out for revenge
[33:48] remember that's that's eye for an eye
[33:50] tooth for a tooth this is the this is a
[33:52] jewish way
[33:52] then you know jesus when he's on calvary
[33:54] said father forgive them they don't know
[33:55] what they do
[33:56] and stephen before he gave him the ghost
[33:58] when he's being stoned he says lord laid
[33:59] this not to their charge so this could
[34:01] not be christian martyrs but this is
[34:03] this is jewish people right and robes
[34:06] were given unto every one of them and it
[34:08] was said unto them that they should rest
[34:10] for a year little season until their
[34:11] fellow servants also and their brethren
[34:13] they should be killed as they were
[34:15] should be fulfilled now those ones who
[34:17] still had to be killed speaking of the
[34:18] future it speaks of 144 000
[34:21] which received the same lord jesus
[34:23] christ we know
[34:24] we go up in the rapture the lord returns
[34:26] to the jews seals them to the kingdom
[34:27] but they
[34:28] give their lives so that's that's it in
[34:31] a very small nutshell but i thought i'd
[34:32] just kind of
[34:33] throw that out there before we listen um
[34:36] but
[34:37] what i like about this just as you want
[34:39] to get the um johnny is it already go
[34:41] is the lord doesn't forget any of his
[34:44] the lord doesn't forget anyone
[34:46] that's that's in his economy and i
[34:49] happen to believe we're all part of his
[34:50] economy
[34:51] our loved ones are part of his economy
[34:54] amen those that are on our hearts want
[34:55] to see meet the lord they're in his
[34:57] economy and god doesn't forget them
[34:59] so we're gonna have confidence lord
[35:00] you're working i heard brother abraham
[35:02] say he said you know you just you just
[35:04] love that person and pray for them until
[35:05] they come into the presence of god
[35:07] oh that's a that's a good way to be so
[35:09] without further ado god bless your
[35:11] friends you may have your seats tonight
[35:13] and we're gonna just listen to a portion
[35:14] here then we're gonna have a time of
[35:15] prayer afterwards
[35:42] hi first souls under the altar
[35:47] now here's where i'm going to get some
[35:48] real
[35:51] disagrees but i just watched just a
[35:55] minute
[35:55] just see i thought that too but it
[35:58] didn't come that way we have i've always
[36:02] thought
[36:03] that these souls under the altar were
[36:06] the
[36:06] the the martyrs of the early church and
[36:09] i'm sure that
[36:11] dr uh smith and everyone says it is see
[36:14] but i thought so myself but when the
[36:17] holy spirit showed the vision to it it
[36:20] wasn't
[36:22] that isn't the soul right i said well i
[36:25] don't know about that well i just admit
[36:26] we'll find out
[36:27] no these are not the souls of the
[36:31] uh of the bride church not at all
[36:35] we thought that was a bride church
[36:37] waiting there souls are in the altar is
[36:39] he crying how long lord how long
[36:41] let me read it again now so we get it
[36:43] right and when you open the fifth seal i
[36:45] saw
[36:46] under the altar the souls of them that
[36:49] were saying
[36:50] for the word of god and for the
[36:53] testimony which they held
[36:58] the word of god and the testimony which
[37:01] say hell
[37:02] i don't don't move from there just a
[37:04] minute see and they cried how long lord
[37:07] how long
[37:07] see a holy truth does thou
[37:11] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[37:13] dwell on the earth
[37:14] and white robes are given to every one
[37:16] of them
[37:18] and it was said to them that they should
[37:20] rest yet for a little
[37:22] season until their fellow servants also
[37:26] and brethren that should be killed as
[37:29] they
[37:30] were should be fulfilled now
[37:34] for they at this time
[37:37] if you notice this
[37:40] fifth seal being opened
[37:43] [Music]
[37:45] see the church is gone
[37:48] it just can't be the soldier the early
[37:50] church right
[37:51] now please if you ever did give this
[37:53] attention now because this is a great
[37:55] conserver
[37:56] controversy so i want you to listen real
[37:58] close now if you got your
[37:59] papers and songs to write with now i
[38:02] want you to notice
[38:03] now these cannot be them souls
[38:07] because the the souls of the
[38:10] of the righteous martyred and the
[38:13] righteous people the church the bride
[38:16] has done a good so they wouldn't be
[38:19] under the altar
[38:21] they'd be in glory with the bride now
[38:24] what
[38:26] for they're gone in the rapture
[38:29] in the fourth chapter of revelations it
[38:31] was taken up
[38:33] now who are these souls that's the next
[38:36] thing
[38:37] who are they that if they're not the
[38:38] early church
[38:42] this is israel that's to be
[38:46] saved as a nation all them
[38:50] that are predestinated that's israel
[38:54] that's israel itself you say oh wait you
[38:56] say they can't oh yes they are to be
[38:58] saved
[38:59] here let's settle this man i got four or
[39:01] five scriptures i'll take one
[39:02] let's take romans just a minute and find
[39:04] out if they are let's take the book of
[39:06] romans
[39:06] and go to the 11th chapter of romans
[39:09] and we'll find out just let's just read
[39:11] it and then we'll have it by herself
[39:13] a romans 11 chapter the 25th
[39:17] and 26th verse
[39:22] now listen to paul here and paul said if
[39:25] anyone else even an angel preached any
[39:27] other gospel
[39:28] what he was to be cursed for i would
[39:32] not brethren that you should be ignorant
[39:35] of the
[39:36] mystery
[39:39] thus you should be wise in your own
[39:41] conceit
[39:45] the blindness in part
[39:49] is happened to israel until the
[39:51] fulfilling
[39:52] fullness of the gentiles become in
[39:56] the last gentile bride be brought in for
[39:58] the bride
[39:59] the blind has come to israel for that
[40:01] purpose
[40:03] and so all israel
[40:07] shall be saved as it is written
[40:10] there shall come out of zion a deliver
[40:13] and shall turn away ungodliness for
[40:17] jacob
[40:19] right now
[40:22] they are israel that's under this altar
[40:25] what israel was blinded
[40:29] for the very purpose of us being saved
[40:35] you believe that now who blinded them
[40:38] god god blinded his own children
[40:43] all right that's right amen amen no
[40:45] order of jesus standing at the cross
[40:48] them jews howling for his blood as his
[40:50] own kids
[40:51] and he was the scripture that's right
[40:54] amen
[40:54] he was he self the word and here he
[40:57] knowing
[40:58] that those people that gladly received
[41:01] him
[41:02] and that's the reason he blinded them so
[41:05] they wouldn't recognize him
[41:07] he'd come in such a humble way and
[41:09] blinded him to it that they wouldn't
[41:10] receive it
[41:11] see the scripture said they'd do it and
[41:14] he blighted it
[41:15] was blinded jesus hated them
[41:19] even so much as he said father forgive
[41:21] them they don't know what they're doing
[41:23] they were blind paul said they were
[41:26] blinded for a cause for us
[41:28] amen notice now
[41:32] i want you to watch this real close
[41:35] they were given robes
[41:38] they didn't have them they were given
[41:41] robes
[41:42] white robes each one of them now the
[41:46] saints
[41:48] now have already have one they get it
[41:51] here
[41:52] [Music]
[41:53] but there they were given robes and the
[41:56] saints already had theirs and gone on
[41:59] see see they had
[42:02] had not they see they had not
[42:06] a chance because they were blinded by
[42:09] god their own father so that the grace
[42:13] of god could be fulfilled
[42:15] so the bride could be took from the
[42:18] gentiles
[42:20] is that right let me show you a
[42:22] beautiful type here
[42:23] and joseph joseph
[42:26] the spirit man the eagle he was born
[42:29] among his brothers just like the real
[42:31] churches among the others
[42:32] and he could interpret dreams and see
[42:34] visions and arrest them haiti
[42:35] yeah his father loved him notice then he
[42:38] was out
[42:39] oused by his brother not by his father
[42:42] out by his brethren
[42:44] and was sold for almost 30 pieces of
[42:46] silver thrown into a ditch and supposed
[42:47] to be
[42:48] dead taken up and set at the right hand
[42:51] of pharaoh
[42:52] and because he was ousted
[42:56] by his brethren
[42:59] see he was given a gentile bride
[43:03] [Music]
[43:04] not of his own people through there he
[43:07] bore ephraim and manassas
[43:08] which was added into israel as
[43:12] israel blessing by crossing his hands
[43:14] from the youngest to the oldest
[43:15] to cross the blessings from the jew back
[43:18] or
[43:19] from the jew to the gentile see
[43:22] across his hands to the younger son
[43:25] which is the younger church to come in
[43:27] the the mother church stood in the sun
[43:29] she brought forth this
[43:30] baby and um in order to get him
[43:34] israel crossed his hands and the type
[43:37] and joseph them same children
[43:40] was a gentile mother
[43:43] the bride of israel back there
[43:46] become cross from the old orthodox
[43:50] over to the christian uh way
[43:53] by uh the holy spirit
[43:57] that crossed israel's hands he said god
[44:00] has crossed my hands
[44:02] he had nothing to do with it notice
[44:05] then joseph rejected by his own brethren
[44:10] his own people took a gentile bride just
[44:13] exactly what jesus done rejected
[44:17] by the jews took a gentile bride
[44:21] now let's read something here i got a
[44:23] scripture around acts
[44:25] 15
[44:28] and all this is just kind of it's what
[44:30] we're supposed to teach it anyhow
[44:34] now i believe i have this right
[44:37] read acts of 15 14
[44:40] all right i hope this is right now
[44:44] all right simon has declared
[44:47] how god let's start the 13th and after
[44:50] they had
[44:50] helped their peace james answered and i
[44:54] see what had happened that went to the
[44:55] gentiles
[44:56] see and the fuss was on because they
[44:58] were jews
[44:59] see and after they had helped their
[45:01] peace james
[45:02] answered saying man and brother hearken
[45:05] unto me
[45:07] simon that simon peter has declared how
[45:10] god at the first did visit the gentiles
[45:14] to take
[45:15] out of them a people for his
[45:18] name
[45:22] see my wife's name was broy when i
[45:25] tucker she's abram
[45:29] jesus takes his church out or his bride
[45:33] out of the gentiles it's a scripture
[45:37] type is like joseph was i noticed this
[45:40] now these souls under the altar
[45:45] uh well uh the this these um souls
[45:49] understanding now that's under the altar
[45:51] why
[45:52] they were martyred by sinful man like
[45:55] eichmann yeah see they're holding right
[45:58] on
[45:59] millions of them but they remain
[46:02] jews now remember what was it
[46:05] they were killed for the word of god's
[46:09] sake
[46:10] not for the testimony of christ did you
[46:12] understand that but remember
[46:14] the church come in also the martyrs of
[46:16] the church
[46:17] was for the word of god and the
[46:20] testimony of jesus christ
[46:21] how many was that here all right now but
[46:24] these
[46:25] didn't have the testimony of jesus
[46:27] christ for the word of god
[46:28] and for the testimony which they helped
[46:32] the jews and hitler hated them so
[46:34] tonight
[46:35] sort of stalling all the rest of the
[46:36] world
[46:38] but they stayed true to what they
[46:40] believed
[46:41] and they killed them because they were
[46:44] jews
[46:44] [Music]
[46:49] but you know martin luther king had that
[46:50] same idea too
[46:52] it's the truth he said all jews should
[46:54] be taken out their antichrist
[46:56] see but he was just under another
[46:57] dispensation didn't see it
[46:59] didn't see the word now the word truth
[47:01] comes forth
[47:03] how you go to ever blind out israel you
[47:05] can't do it
[47:07] oh how could that prophet stand up there
[47:09] and say
[47:10] you look like a unicorn israel one is
[47:12] trying to show him the worst parts of it
[47:13] he said
[47:14] why he said whoever blesses you will be
[47:16] blessed and whoever curses you will be
[47:18] cursed
[47:18] amen that's right how do you go do it
[47:22] one time they thought god would forget
[47:23] when the prophet seen that dark thing
[47:24] coming for the
[47:25] jews that man standing there and the
[47:26] word of god poured to him he said oh
[47:28] lord
[47:28] are you going to forsake your people he
[47:30] said what's that laying there by it says
[47:31] a major stick said how high is it to
[47:33] heaven
[47:35] how deep is the seed he said i can't
[47:37] just another can i neither can i
[47:40] ever forget israel sir
[47:43] he ain't going to forget her he had to
[47:45] blind his own child
[47:47] now think of that blind his own child to
[47:50] give us a chance and we turn it down
[47:53] [Music]
[47:55] now don't that make you feel about so
[47:57] little
[48:00] [Music]
[48:01] you're crawling a concrete block with a
[48:03] 10 gallon hat on and never touch it amen
[48:06] that's right that's pretty small amen
[48:10] oh man yes
[48:14] they helped for the word of god
[48:17] they were jews they had their laws they
[48:19] stayed with it
[48:20] remember last night now they stayed with
[48:23] that
[48:24] and they were jews that had the law and
[48:26] the law was the word of god
[48:28] they stayed right by that's right and
[48:30] for their testimony they held
[48:31] they were martyred and here were souls
[48:35] on the altar
[48:36] after the church had been gone now what
[48:42] they had in their blindness martyred
[48:45] their messiah and now
[48:49] they were reaping for it they realized
[48:52] that they recognized that just gone on
[48:54] they seen them when they
[48:55] come before the altar of god but now the
[48:58] grace of god
[49:00] is to them watch
[49:03] now they could not by no means
[49:08] be saints because it already be rogue
[49:12] but here they are now just souls are the
[49:15] order for the word of god and the
[49:16] testimony of the health of being god's
[49:18] people is jews
[49:19] but now watch the grace of god comes to
[49:22] them
[49:23] and jesus gives them each one a white
[49:25] robe
[49:26] [Music]
[49:29] watch pull over after the church is gone
[49:33] because they were loyal to their cause
[49:37] [Music]
[49:38] and they were blinded and they didn't
[49:40] know it
[49:43] they didn't know it they were playing
[49:45] exactly apart that got it
[49:47] ordained from the plate amen and here
[49:49] here
[49:50] john looks over and sees souls on the
[49:52] altar
[49:53] now watch he sees those souls watch what
[49:56] he calls them
[49:56] they cried lord how long watch
[50:00] just a little while longer
[50:03] let's get that israel go down right
[50:04] through the scripture
[50:06] they realized they had murdered their
[50:08] messiah see
[50:10] and they didn't know it then they
[50:11] realized they got they got murdered back
[50:13] to pay for it
[50:14] they're doing the wrong and now look
[50:17] what a thing they had to do
[50:19] see there was guilty of murder so they
[50:20] got murdered
[50:22] they they cried out his blood beyond us
[50:25] that's right
[50:27] that's right and they were blinded
[50:30] now if they hadn't been blinded god said
[50:32] let alone
[50:33] they're not worthy but then if they was
[50:36] blinded by god his grace reached down to
[50:39] them
[50:40] amen talk about amazing grace
[50:43] amen and give each one of
[50:46] them a room because all israel will be
[50:49] saved
[50:50] everyone has his names written that's
[50:52] right jesus give them robes
[50:55] like joseph did to his brethren a tithe
[50:59] look when joseph stood there and when he
[51:01] finally he made himself known
[51:03] there for the altar his own altar
[51:08] his palace is wrong hallelujah he said
[51:11] everybody leave me amen
[51:14] his wife was over in the palace where's
[51:16] the bride
[51:18] and he said to him he said don't you

[51:36] throw me out in order
[51:38] to save life
[51:41] [Applause]
[51:43] [Music]
[51:45] don't be angry with yourselves remember
[51:46] joseph said that he said don't be angry
[51:48] with yourself everything's all right now
[51:50] it's all in the word god sent me here
[51:52] ahead of you
[51:53] you know the bible said they'll say to
[51:55] him when they seek us to say uh

[51:59] about them scar
[52:01] see he said oh i got him in the house of
[52:03] my friends
[52:06] friends and then when they realized it
[52:09] them had slept 144 000.
[52:11] that bible said that they'll separate
[52:13] one house and the other
[52:14] and take days just to cry and wail and
[52:16] walk up and down the floor
[52:18] how did we do it how did we do it while
[52:21] we crucified our own messiah
[52:24] said crying like a homewood for its only
[52:26] begotten son
[52:28] hallelujah how did we do it them jews
[52:30] are they're the most religious people in
[52:32] the world

[56:45] thy brethren have yet be killed
[56:48] which means the 144 000 yet to be
[56:52] called in the tribulation 144 000 is
[56:56] called wish we had time we might get it
[56:58] tomorrow night if the lord willing
[57:00] we vote just before we get in on the
[57:01] seal see also
[57:04] now what they have to be
[57:07] martyred by the antichrist that we just
[57:09] come to and notice in his last ride
[57:11] where he
[57:11] breaks that covenant than jews down
[57:13] there in their shields see
[57:15] these jews 144 000
[57:18] is to be called out by
[57:22] the two witnesses of revelation 11.
[57:26] now remember there was to prophesy
[57:28] you've read that how many's read that
[57:30] sure we all when you're reading the
[57:31] scripture
[57:33] and they prophesy these two witnesses
[57:36] prophesy
[57:37] in the time of daniel's
[57:40] second half of the 70th week
[57:44] that is the last three and a half years
[57:46] remember how we talked to daniel 70 week
[57:48] i said we need it when i got in here
[57:50] i didn't know why but something told me
[57:52] we need it here we are
[57:55] see notice in the time of daniel i
[57:58] remember
[57:59] daniel was told that the messiah would
[58:01] come the prince
[58:02] the messiah rather and he would prophesy
[58:06] israel still had 70 weeks left and in
[58:09] the midst of the 70 weeks
[58:10] the messiah would be cut off and the
[58:14] daily sacrifice taken away
[58:16] is that right but there were still three
[58:18] and a half weeks determined
[58:20] in this block he takes the gentile bride
[58:23] now she goes up and when she goes up two
[58:26] prophets arrives
[58:28] to israel see and those souls that's
[58:31] been martyred now
[58:32] down to your real true jews down through
[58:35] there that had their name on the book
[58:36] that lived the right life and done the
[58:38] right thing
[58:39] lived judaism to the dock they were
[58:42] martyred by eichmann and many others
[58:43] honest
[58:44] people millions of them go down there
[58:46] and then germans shot them to death and
[58:48] murdered them and killed them and hung
[58:50] them on fences and burned them up and
[58:52] cremated them and everything else
[58:53] that bloodless their blood-hearted
[58:57] hungry hitler and stalling and mussolini
[59:00] and all that people
[59:01] hated them jews i think that's one of
[59:03] the one of the things just holding this
[59:05] nation together because they've already
[59:06] respected the jew amen
[59:08] amen give him a please you honor the jew
[59:11] and god
[59:12] are you now there's a bunch of jews
[59:14] renegades
[59:15] just like there's gentiles the same way
[59:17] but the real jew
[59:19] god's put his name on the book before
[59:20] the foundation of the world and here he
[59:22] was murdered down this time and
[59:24] remember think of it now how perfect
[59:25] this is right
[59:27] after that millions of slaughtered jews
[59:29] innocent people by the
[59:31] nations of the world here the scripture
[59:33] says right in this time
[59:35] that there each one under the altar
[59:37] realize what's happened and they're
[59:39] given white robes
[59:41] and they said well why can't we go back
[59:42] to the kingdom right now
[59:44] the jewish kingdoms to be said on the
[59:45] earth you know johnson the kingdom
[59:47] to be said not this is the kingdom of
[59:49] the gospel you see but the kingdom of
[59:51] jews will be preached by these these two
[59:52] prophets
[59:53] so notice the the kingdom of the earth
[59:56] here the kingdom of heaven is preached
[59:57] by the jews
[59:58] to i mean to the gentile the kingdom of
[1:00:00] your own earth just be set up in the
[1:00:02] millennium
[1:00:03] uh after the millennium of the jews now

[1:00:07] while they are preaching see before
[1:00:09] these
[1:00:10] these prophets ever rise on the scene
[1:00:13] these jews that had to die or eichmann
[1:00:15] them is each one of them that is
[1:00:17] predestinated is given by grace a white
[1:00:20] robe
[1:00:22] each one of them given a white robe
[1:00:24] notice
[1:00:25] now what happens as soon as that takes
[1:00:28] place
[1:00:28] i'm watching that clock back and i know
[1:00:30] we're we're getting late but i don't
[1:00:32] want to
[1:00:32] see uh that notion and poor fellow stand
[1:00:35] there god help you brother and i hope
[1:00:36] each one of us gives a white robe that
[1:00:38] day

[1:00:41] legs are hurting somebody worked all day
[1:00:43] i know what that is
[1:00:44] and look here and some of the poor
[1:00:46] little women stand i noticed some of
[1:00:48] these man give the women their seats and
[1:00:50] somebody else give some poor little
[1:00:51] mother with a baby and i
[1:00:52] i see all that and i'm sure he does
[1:00:55] notice
[1:00:56] but i don't want to keep you too long if
[1:00:58] i just get you to see the message that's
[1:00:59] all i want you to do see
[1:01:01] now notice these jews i have to do this
[1:01:03] in order
[1:01:04] to let you see the revelation of this
[1:01:05] seal see what it is
[1:01:07] under the altar and who they are notice
[1:01:10] in the time of daniel now the second
[1:01:13] half of the seventh week
[1:01:15] now remember messiah was to be cut off
[1:01:18] in the midst that's the middle
[1:01:20] oh what's half of seven how long did
[1:01:23] christ preach
[1:01:24] that's right wow but there is determined
[1:01:27] yet to the people
[1:01:28] what another three and a half years well
[1:01:30] during this time
[1:01:32] well see what happens is the
[1:01:35] gentile bride is selected in the seventh
[1:01:38] church he said and goes up
[1:01:41] and what it does that way all these jews
[1:01:43] is martyred along there because of
[1:01:45] blindness
[1:01:46] laying under the altar god comes over
[1:01:47] and says you see what it was now i'll
[1:01:49] give each one of you a robe
[1:01:50] they said how long lord are we going in
[1:01:52] now so no no no no
[1:01:53] your fellow man the jews has got to
[1:01:56] suffer a little bit yet
[1:01:57] they got to be martyred like you were
[1:01:59] smarter the beast has got to get down
[1:02:01] when he breaks his covenant i noticed
[1:02:04] and now notice
[1:02:05] once now just remember
[1:02:08] these prophets are to prophesy according
[1:02:11] to revelations 11. you
[1:02:13] you raise your hands you read it see and
[1:02:15] they're given power
[1:02:16] and we're going to find out who they are
[1:02:18] just in a minute willing
[1:02:19] i know who these prophets are and now
[1:02:22] the bible tells it here
[1:02:23] sure sure see now i notice in the middle
[1:02:27] of this three and a half weeks now that
[1:02:29] they're prophesying down here
[1:02:31] and the revelation sure said and they
[1:02:34] they prophesy a thousand
[1:02:38] three hundred and two score days
[1:02:43] if now the regular jewish calendar the
[1:02:45] regular
[1:02:46] time of god's calendar is exactly 30
[1:02:49] days
[1:02:50] in a month the roll encounter what makes
[1:02:52] it up right
[1:02:53] the regular calendar is 30 days a month
[1:02:55] now if you want to take 30 days and add
[1:02:58] three and a half years to it and see if
[1:02:59] 30 days
[1:02:59] you are what you got one thousand three
[1:03:02] hundred and two hundred three score days
[1:03:05] one thousand jordan three score days
[1:03:06] sixty days exactly three and one half
[1:03:09] years
[1:03:10] now you see there's no mistake for that
[1:03:12] right there it is just fits together
[1:03:13] like
[1:03:14] uh uh dovetails coming together
[1:03:17] two prophets preached for three and a
[1:03:20] half years
[1:03:22] to the jews and that is called out the
[1:03:25] 144 thousand
[1:03:27] and then notice these two prophets
[1:03:30] are exactly moses and elijah amen
[1:03:35] now look look they're look at their
[1:03:38] ministry
[1:03:39] i watch what these prophets do they have
[1:03:42] power
[1:03:43] to smite the earth or the plague as
[1:03:44] often as they will
[1:03:46] who did it moses amen they have power to
[1:03:49] shut the heavens and it rained not the
[1:03:51] day of their ministry who closed the
[1:03:52] heavens for three and a half years
[1:03:55] there you are that's them see it's see
[1:03:58] the man when he dies
[1:04:00] he doesn't change his status he doesn't
[1:04:02] change his makeup
[1:04:04] see look when when before
[1:04:07] uh when saul had backslid and there was
[1:04:10] no prophets in the land he couldn't
[1:04:12] understand what to do
[1:04:13] what to do he's up against it he's going
[1:04:15] to battle he went to the witch of endor
[1:04:17] now just a blood of bulls and goats she
[1:04:19] could do this
[1:04:20] and she called up the spirit of samuel
[1:04:23] and when samuel come
[1:04:24] up there he stood
[1:04:27] and his prophet rome not only that but
[1:04:30] he's still a prophet
[1:04:32] hallelujah he said why did you call me
[1:04:34] out of my wrist
[1:04:37] he said sin you become an enemy to god
[1:04:40] he said by this time tomorrow night
[1:04:42] you're going to fall in the battle this
[1:04:43] time tomorrow night you're with me
[1:04:46] that's exactly what happened see not
[1:04:48] only he was still a prophet
[1:04:51] that's right and these fellows are still
[1:04:54] prophets
[1:04:56] now we're going to get a little deep in
[1:04:57] that just a few minutes
[1:05:00] oh my how i love that word
[1:05:03] no wonder man shall not live by bread
[1:05:05] alone
[1:05:06] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:05:08] mouth of god
[1:05:10] these two prophets are moses elijah
[1:05:12] according to their works being
[1:05:13] re-patterned again
[1:05:15] that that has always been their ministry
[1:05:20] now notice just as they did
[1:05:23] that didn't change them remember these
[1:05:26] guys
[1:05:27] never died what's just that now don't
[1:05:30] confuse before we get away from this
[1:05:32] don't confuse elijah's
[1:05:35] fifth time ministry with his fourth time
[1:05:38] ministry
[1:05:41] i've been telling you the gentile church
[1:05:42] is looking for elijah
[1:05:45] right and here he is over with the jew
[1:05:47] remember he can't come forward that's
[1:05:49] that's
[1:05:49] enemies number he has to be five the
[1:05:51] first time he come
[1:05:53] is elijah himself next time he come he
[1:05:55] was elisha
[1:05:56] next time he come he was what john the
[1:05:58] baptist the next time he comes is for
[1:06:00] the seventh angel
[1:06:02] and the fifth time he comes he's with
[1:06:03] moses
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:07] yes sir don't confuse me
[1:06:10] five if you know your your numerals of
[1:06:13] the bible
[1:06:14] five is a number of laboring grace
[1:06:18] and that's what he's done now watch you
[1:06:20] don't know where it is was jesus a labor
[1:06:22] of grace
[1:06:24] j-e-s-u-s by
[1:06:28] l-a-b-o-r is that right
[1:06:31] labor for for love for you and if you
[1:06:33] get 10 how you come
[1:06:35] by what f-a-i-t-h
[1:06:38] amen l-a-b-o-r is that right
[1:06:41] labor is the number grace all right
[1:06:44] to the believers notice the first
[1:06:48] elijah that was him the second
[1:06:51] was elisha the third was john
[1:06:55] the fourth was the seventh angel
[1:06:58] or the last messenger to the church
[1:07:01] according to malachi
[1:07:02] 4 and revelations 10 7.
[1:07:05] now the fifth time
[1:07:08] he is a messenger to the jews to the 144
[1:07:13] thousand
[1:07:15] to the jews at the church is gone
[1:07:19] i i just feel a little funny look
[1:07:23] if some thinks i want you to get this
[1:07:26] now
[1:07:27] if some still thinks that malachi
[1:07:30] 4 to restore the people
[1:07:34] is the same thing he's going to do down
[1:07:35] there to the jews and think it's all the
[1:07:37] same
[1:07:38] let me straighten that out for you see
[1:07:41] it would be a little bit confusing
[1:07:42] of course remember in malachi 4 says to
[1:07:44] return the faith
[1:07:46] of the fathers or the children back to
[1:07:48] the father
[1:07:49] see back to the father now let me show
[1:07:51] you the difference of the ministry
[1:07:53] if he comes to return the faith of the
[1:07:56] children back to the fathers he would
[1:07:57] deny christ
[1:07:59] he go back to the law
[1:08:04] that right the fathers kept the law
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:14] when elijah and when he come
[1:08:18] to fulfill his ministry in malachi 4
[1:08:22] see as malachi 4
[1:08:25] elijah was by himself
[1:08:29] but when he come to minister to the jews
[1:08:31] of revelation 11 he has moses with him
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:44] when elisha comes of malachi 4
[1:08:47] he's by himself elijah will run not
[1:08:50] elijah moses
[1:08:52] elijah will arise but the same
[1:08:54] inspiration that said
[1:08:56] elijah will come for the last part of
[1:08:58] the church age
[1:08:59] to restore the faith of the children
[1:09:02] back to the original faith of the
[1:09:04] father's
[1:09:05] apostolic faith which you're supposed to
[1:09:06] go back and the antichrist has got them
[1:09:08] all pulled out
[1:09:09] to restore back as all the rest of
[1:09:11] scripture is blended together
[1:09:13] see amen he comes by himself
[1:09:18] but when he comes
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:28] and his first ministry couldn't take the
[1:09:30] jews and put them back to the law
[1:09:31] because
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:43] so don't have it confused it's not
[1:09:45] confusing the scripture don't lie
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:53] out there see that elijah walk out there
[1:09:55] for that first stage by himself
[1:09:57] and he's by himself then when i see it
[1:09:59] come again way over somewhere else there
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:15] me so i did notice
[1:10:18] these men are kept alive by god from
[1:10:21] their original ministry
[1:10:39] not christians they're jews crying out
[1:10:41] for
[1:10:42] for revenge um
[1:10:46] yep they're given white robes we receive
[1:10:48] a white robe now which is baptism the
[1:10:49] holy ghost
[1:10:50] why we're robbed in his righteousness
[1:10:51] now not on that side
[1:10:54] um praise the lord but it's exciting i
[1:10:57] mean
[1:10:58] you just think of someone you know when
[1:11:00] someone meets a lord
[1:11:02] it throws my heart you know you think
[1:11:04] about there's 144 000 jews

[1:11:08] crying out
[1:11:10] to know the same god that we do they
[1:11:12] don't know exactly who he is
