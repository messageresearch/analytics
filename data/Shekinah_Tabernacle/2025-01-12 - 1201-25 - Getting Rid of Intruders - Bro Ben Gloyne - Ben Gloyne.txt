========================================
[Music] am all [Music] good morning God bless you all this morning I looked over at um Brother Bruce when he walked in and I thought one day I'm going to ask him up to pray and he's going to say yes

and become a reality CU and when you comes up you'll remember oh that's right brother Isaac spoke that a while ago by inspiration you know in the Lord we're always growing it's never like it's never

the tech team everything appreciate you amen amen praise the Lord praise God let's um yeah let's just go to the scripture um so we have um couple of announcements uh bad news first because of the weather we're not having the Sunday school picnic today but we'll reschedule it when the weather is good the good news is is we have the candy floss machine I think that's good news so praise the Lord we're going to have church lunch and things but there's going to be candy floss okay if you don't like candy floss I'll take your portion that's fine but praise the Lord and also um if all the youth and I trust it's all of you uh who are going to the Youth Camp uh at White tongy weekend we will meet afterwards just we just want to make sure everyone's got a a seat to get there and home okay so see brother Ed as well but we'll gather here or something and we'll just go through that amen so praise the Lord let's um let's go on the scripture to we're going to go to 2 Corinthians chapter 10 you know it was interesting uh before Wednesday I was I was found myself looking at uh the greatest badly ever for and the conscience and different things I'm thinking why am I why am I looking at these things and then and then brother Jimmy stands up here and talks about Intruders and I thought praise the Lord I'm going to step in right behind what he has preached and I'm going to talk about getting rid of The Intruders amen because a lot of the time me sometimes we think of intruders as a a bad habit the world's G or something but no there's the greatest battle in here there Intruders get in here was try and stop God's word manifesting in our lives and those are the most subtle Intruders so we're going to have an intruder extermination amen today hallelujah praise the Lord so let's um sorry is that is that wait oh yeah one day I'll streamline this one day I'll get there amen Let's uh so 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verses 3 down to verse 5 then then as a context we're going to go to Mark chapter uh five here it says here for we for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ you've got a job to do amen take every thought bring it obedience to the to the to The Obedience of Christ to the word of God Amen so now we're going to turn to chap uh Mark chapter 5 and this is this is a very familiar story to us all it's where um Jas is uh you know his his daughter's sick he's um he's come to get Jesus they're on their way then then um then uh Jas gets word that his daughter is not uh has has died but then Jesus here well so that's the background to this so here we are and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him the woman with the blood issue touches His Garment as he's on the way to D's house he turned about in the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto him thou seeth the multitude thronging thee and saith thou who touch me and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing uh what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith has made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague while he it spake there came from from the ruler of the synagogue's house uh certain which said thy daughter da is dead why troubles thou the master any further and as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue Be not Afraid only believe amen Let's uh pray this morning if you have a need you just want to slip your hand up to the Lord and say Lord speak to my life Lord I'm here to worship you and touch my life oh God gracious father we so thankful Lord we we sung the songs of Zion Lord we believe there's victory in the camp this morning because you're among us dear God we're so thankful for that Lord we appreciate your presence Lord it's more than life to us truly Lord to be in your presence is the greatest thing and father as we've read your word this morning we ask once again Lord may you the great author of the book come in now step in and Lord anoint speaker and hearer Lord may you just take complete control of the service Lord we want to step back and what you do what Only You Can Do Lord Heal the sick and save the lost and pour out your Holy Spirit and do many Great Mighty things father raise faith in our hearts Lord only you can do that dear God so we're inviting you to say Lord Lord to to do those things we love you Lord we ask you touch those who could be here today we want to remember brother Armand Lord with a migraine at home a touches touch that take it from them Lord and anyone else who's not here who's sick and body father touch their lives as well Lord we love you Lord we thank you for this privilege to be gathered together Lord and we so we commit the service into your hands and thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can have your seats this morning so as I said about so we're going to talk about uh getting rid of intruders now Jesus would um as as Paul would say that the weapons of a Warfare are not carnal but uh But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds now brother Bram when he preaches the greatest battle ever fought he says that greatest battle is in the mind today and it's on every man woman and child this battle comes comes your way but we have we have overcoming power in this battle now uh if you have uh this battle is irrespective of if you're a Christian not a Christian feeling victory not feeling Victory doesn't matter what state you're in you're going to have this battle but brother Bram would say in Satan's Eden and and and to me I you I like this where he says now I wanted to speak to you something to bring something to Enlighten you uh to the uh Enlighten to you the promise of God for this AGC something not something that somebody else was in some other day but something them things are all right but we all refer to those things but I thought I would try uh to bring something to your mind with these scriptures I got written down here that would enlighten you to know to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy now we're all in different fields really based on the stage of life you know if if if you're not a parent you're not fighting in the field of being a parent right if you're you know if you're um if you're at school you're not fighting in the field of uh the workforce or if you're retired you're not fighting in the field of all those previous things exactly so we're all in different kind of fields so the devil but but the devil uses the same tactics in those fields now we want to we want to learn the tactics of the enemy right because we need to see how he comes in and then how so these Intruders how they get in now I'm not going to repeat uh repeat Brother Jimmy's um sermon to me that was phenomenal and if you haven't heard it you should go hear that but you see now there's different there's different inlets into the body uh into the body and into the spirit realm and there's faith and doubt which is into the soul now Intruders want to get in and affect these Realms to hinder the work of God in our lives right this is the remember the devil's job is to withstand and try and stop God's word being fulfilled right he's the accuser of the Brethren but his main his main role is to try and stop the word of God being fulfilled because he wants to he wants to usurp the word of God and take control but God is here that that ain't going to happen right he will try but we know who comes out Victorious in the end right so now so these Intruders will try and get in because brother Braham says that the that the word of God must be first received in the mind in the spirit right and then it goes down into the soul then it takes over and does what it wants to do and that's with every every Divine promise of God we we got to realize that I'm sure we're all very aware of the fact that just because we're born again doesn't mean the battle stops you know just because we the Lord Med us and we've sealed to the day of our Redemption doesn't mean the battle stops one bit no it actually gets stronger but we got to realize that there's a soldier on the battlefield of the Holy Ghost which is mightier and greater than the enemy and all he can do cuz the devil's been defeated right but the devil will try and get in he knows how we're built he knows how our our how our emotional realm Works he knows what appeals to us he knows exactly how we're made and he will exploit how we're built for his own devices to stop the word of God coming into manifestation in our lives now but the great thing is is God knows this and God knows the thing that will defeat now I just want to get from the get-go if you see see uh as we identify some Intruders the way to get rid of The Intruders to take God at his word it's very simple right it's very simple you say Lord I believe your word now God wants us to come to a place where we're not leaning on the five senses or anything of this Earth where we're when we're born that's all we know is the five senses right our emotional realm begins to develop then we know those those things right you know affection and reasoning and memory and you know affection is great you know among children I want this I want this I need this you know there's this kind of supercharges their life but there comes a point where these things should become balanced but the only way to truly balance it is when faith comes in the Holy Ghost takes over then all these things can come into the right balance right but you see we have to come to a place like Abraham did where we walk by faith alone right so it's not by reasoning it's not by affections it's not by uh conscience or imagin or memory or what we see feel smell hear whatever touch taste whatever all those things it's not those things it's faith alone now as as um Paul would write about uh Abraham he said and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but all but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he uh had being yet uncircumcised now Abraham went on a journey he had to leave everything he was used to right as as um and we're going to come back to Jas because Jas had to come to this place too and every every child of Abraham comes to this place of walking by faith alone because we we know the pattern of Abraham's life or or or his his life is a pattern of the Christian walk and I'm not going to go into that particularly this morning but you know you got to realize that we come to a point as I said about a baby they just live on the five senses but then God comes into our life we could be young could be old where we go from those things to walking by faith alone now Abra was commanded by God in Genesis 12 he said get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy father's house into a land that I will show thee so God is telling him basically leave everything you're used to leave your upbringing leave how you thought leave your culture leave your family spirit and traits and how you you know leave those things and walk by faith alone this is what he's telling him to do leave leave what you're used to and this is what the Christian Journey's got to be see we used to thinking a different way but then when you meet the Lord and the his word starts having effect in your life you start thinking a different way than how you used to I remember before I met the Lord I was lost in the world I never thought like I do now my thinking has totally changed praise the Lord to that amen I used to think the things of the world but God very rarely came into my thoughts unless I needed something from him amen so I remember when you know there was a when my parents live in American and you a cyclone came through it flattened all the um flattened all the trees where where my parents lived where they lived was like a basically a big lava shelf and it was this much soil and lava rock underneath and blew down all the trees and people lost their houses and things and you know and and and and the morning after we had to get out and and and cut a track through our driveway for my dad had to basically get on his motorbike go see if his work was still there so all the trees fell over us where these machetes and of course the wind still blowing and you know it's one thing to look at it from the inside but then you go into it and you're under all these coconut trees swaying with these big gusts and you're and you're hacking away at these Fallen branches I was thinking about God a lot then I was singing hymns that I sung at Chapel at school and you know but I never thought I never was like that normally but when I needed him I began to think on him right and then when I was at Uni I said Lord I prayed Lord I need a job and I got a job you see but other times I forgot about him and kept doing what I was doing until he got a hold of my life then he changed my thinking you see so you got to look at because an intruder will always try and diminish the word of God he'll try and see this is how you identify a an intruder he will diminish and reason away the effect of the word of God in your life amen what was the first Intruder the serpent got into the garden he was an intruder right and what did he say to Eve ye haath God said and what did he do you'll surely not die you know really really the potency of the word of God Eve is really you actually lifting it up higher than what it really is you'll actually be greater if you do this thing right so so and if an intruder comes in he'll make you think that the word isn't really as powerful and not as powerful For You especially we're identifying some Intruders I trust see this is a mind battle we all come across he comes in he comes out he tries to but but faith has got to be tested see the soldier on the battlefield in here is going to be proven in your life you're going to see as you walk with God that really this Soldier wins he really is Rambo he's a one man Victory amen but but it's got to be proven this is why God allows mind battles not to keep us oh you know you know not to keep us TR Trot and down no God wants to prove the faith he's placed in your life that's what he wants to do right so now praise the Lord and I'm glad for that aren't you you can look back in your life and you can see where God has comeing time and time again he's proven us word he's proven himself you see but the Devil comes in to try and make you think the word of God is Not powerful in your life you know the scripture can break a mind battle like that you know the word of God is is is is supreme power it's supreme power am me when Jesus and and Jesus proved it doesn't matter the condition you feel you're in relative if it'll work or not because when he was in the desert he was head fasted for 40 days he was at his weakest point but yet he didn't use his great power now we know the Lord Jesus he supreme power he made the worlds we live in he made the universe he he he's the ultimate There's No One Like Our God but yet when he was at his lowest he wanted to prove to the Christian it's not it's it's not supreme power that you can relying to overcome it is quoting the word of God Amen why because the devil tried to bring an intruder into his reasoning if thou be the Son of God prove this he's trying to see he's trying to put an intruder in there but our lord Jesus don't let an intruder Hallelujah see the see the Mind battle came to him he appealed to his flesh you're hungry you've been fasting for 40 days God's LED you out into this condition you know you can turn the picture around but he proved that the weakest of Christians by quoting the word of God will conquer the devil any place any time anywhere am mean so why do we quote our situation why don't we quote the word in our situation and take God at his word no matter what we see taste feel smile hear imagine reason whatever more why don't we just take God at his word because that's what our lord Jesus wants to do because if he did that then he will bring us into scenarios where we'll do the same thing praise the Lord aren't you glad because we're his children aren't we we're Made In His Image I me so what he went through we'll go through praise God maybe not physically crucified but you can be spiritually crucified you can be rejected you can be despised all those things but he wants to prove his faith that is placed in you it works amen but you see an intruder will put reasoning in there will try and reason away the power of the word of God and he will try and use you to diminish the faith that he's placed that God's placed in you because of oh because you say well of course Jesus could quote the word he was the word the word is made flesh today we are his sons and daughters of God are we not amen the Holy Ghost knew was not a less a Holy Ghost and what was in our lord Jesus wasn't a less a holy ghost what was in the prophet you know you see an intruder will come you see just like when Jesus told the story of the rich man in Lazarus the rich man is in hell and he cries out he sees that he he he sees Lazarus the poor man in Abraham's bosom right and then he appeals to Abraham send send Lazarus or send someone to my family who's still alive that they won't come to this place and Abraham says they have the Lord law and the prophets that is enough so Abraham knew the power of the word that they had in that day was was powerful more than enough to take people to go take them into heaven amen so can we not take God at his word that when we come into a mind battle we feel like we're failures we feel like we're far from God we feel like we can't overcome that we can take a scripture and it will break it amen I believe it many times things feel far away from God God's distance somewhere God doesn't care but then the scripture comes to mind I'll never leave thee nor forsake Thee I me it just breaks that whole thing I realize God your word is said that inres of how I feel what I'm going through Thank You Lord because your word is true no matter where I am no matter what's going on hallelujah amen an intruder will get it and and and and because it's just like uh Satan there with with with Jesus in the in the wilderness if thou be do this prove your faith right now but you see someone who doesn't have Intruders isn't looking for how the word's going to be fulfilled the three Hebrew children when they stood before Nebuchadnezzar they weren't you know they didn't say well if God delivers us now then we'll then we're not going to Bow they said we're not we're not going to be careful how we're going to answer you in this matter God can deliver us but if he doesn't we're still not going to Bow if we burn we burn if we don't we don't but we're not going to Bow so what did they do they stood there saying that we will not our worship our life will not change based on what God does our life is based on what he has said Hallelujah I trust that's the same thing with you and I friends see reasoning tries to come and say well if you're really the bride then this will happen if you're really then this will happen you say no I am the bride of Christ because his word says I'm the bride and I serve him because he uh because of who he is not what's going on in my life praise the Lord hallelujah aren't you glad for that I'm talking about the faith that's in you you got a you got a mighty warrior in the side of you I mean inside of you you may feel like a failure but he's never failed amen and he will never fail praise the Lord amen but you see now we've got to we've got to leave everything we knew and we got to walk we're got to walk into a realm of only Bel for all things are possible now you see if we go back to D just quickly I just because I feel like many times I read a scripture I just forget about it so let's just go through this now so Jas was son of Abraham right he was the son of Abraham but God allowed this trouble to come into his life because he wanted him to only Bel right we live in an age where it's it's it's really only believe is a very rare thing now I'm not talking about the song now I'm talking about a faith that's in a people because you you you if we look at the age we live in it's a it's a hybrid age it's a mixing age look at all the food that we eat I doubt any of its original seed it'd be pretty hard to find some Original Seed somewhere it's all all been hybridized it's all been mixed it's not just it's not just what it was in its pure form something's been added to it and Jesus was telling was telling Jas don't add anything just believe it's not it's not believe Plus or believe and feel it therefore it is or believe and imagine it there it is or believe and reason it no it's only belief just take God at his word it's not something mixed with it it's not something taken away from it it's only belief amen so now he had to come to this place cuz if you look at now Jas has this hope in his life he's trying to he's trying now if I go back to this and and and this is natural human being if you've got actually any emotion in you there's a way that emotional feeling Lord you can do it right and and and that's why he went to go get Jesus is because he he he knew that is you know he knew that his uh of course his daughter was sick and God God allowed him to come off the the work of man now if God wants you to go medical he'll Lead You medical that's fine right God said brother BR say It's Our obligation go to the doctor okay well some of you don't well I do amen is that okay does that mean you don't believe no I believe I've seen God heal all manner of things Hallelujah but you see now Jas had to be see what was he leaning on first he's a leader in the synagogue he's a good person the doctors can help this all this can happen God didn't use that Avenue he wanted him to walk like Abraham walked to go off the five senses go off what he can imagine and and hoping to actually have a Rock Solid Faith to only believe hallelujah amen so so so that's why Jesus said to him don't be afraid that's a big Intruder fear is a big Intruder fear is such a crippling thing thing but fear is an intruder and intruders are made to be exterminated they're not to be collected like um Jimmy had that big snake in that place you know that picture of that snake you know I'm sure everyone remembers that yes you see if you feed a snake long enough it'll get that big if it's a python right they just keep growing well I think anyway you see so fear or anything like that when when that little voice comes in and there's a fear of the unknown how's this going to happen what's going to happen to my children what's going to happen in the future the world's falling apart what's going to be you see now that can that can either take you to the Lord in faith because we see because remember in order to walk by faith alone doesn't mean that you're an ostrich and put your head in the sand that's not Faith that's actually just fear we don't walk along with blinkers on we see the trouble we see the condition of the age we see all these things and we see it more than the world does CU we can see it through the lens of the Bible we can see it through the lens into the message right but you see so so walking by faith alone does not mean you just ignore the um you ignore the conditions like ignore what you know what's going on like brother BR would say and how can I overcome he said it's like you know someone's got a Cancer and people say no no no I don't have a cancer he says yeah you got it but you got to realize the one in you has already overcome that cancer amen that's how that's how that that um that intrud doesn't get in and take control of your life is when you realize no the one in me has already conquered this thing am mean the one enemy has already conquered this mind battle he conquered it 2,000 years ago and he's still Victorious today so it doesn't matter what fear or whatever comes into my life I'm not going to feed it that it becomes so big amen like you take that snake for example when it maybe it was small it would have been in a little a little cage enclosure thing I don't know where they put snakes they should be far away that's where they should put them but you see you know but I don't know what they're kept in but you know maybe but then as it was being fed it outgrew that enclosure so begin to control more of the house that's what happens when fear or some Intruder comes in you your double mindness it starts off with one thing one Avenue of your life and you begin to doubt question well yeah can even come down to should I be eating this food should I not be everyday simple things what about this color watch you double mindness what it starts off with something small but it grows into something very big why because it's being fed no the only thing a an intruder should be fed is lead shoot the thing by the word of God Amen that y that's that's what you should do with these your fear comes in you say no my God has not given me the spirit of fear but love power and a sound mind am mean that's my that's my inheritance right hallelujah amen are we all are we all together this morning amen see you got you got to look at your thought patterns because your thought patterns will be dictated by the word of God or by Intruders right and trud is always try and come in but we have been anointed to cast them out Hallelujah so fear can come in you know then you know then then your memory God can start youo God wants to use your memory but the devil wants to use it too see your memory can either build Faith or the devil can use it to actually try and pull Faith down try and disable Faith well how does God use your use your memory to build Faith you remember what you were but then you realize you're not that person anymore amen you go back in your testimony God you delivered me here you know it says in Hebrews 11 faith is the substance of things hopeful the evidence of things unseen right so faith is a substance of things hopeful the evidence of un you know things that are not seen so you can look at now in your life you are the evidence of Things Not Seen amen it's like people say how do you know Calvary happened you weren't there no but Faith what what the blood has done in my life is evidence of Things Not Seen hallelujah how do you know the atonement happened because faith has come into my heart amen and now my life is living evidence I mean of things that are not seen you can't go back there and prove it happened right you can't go back and find the cross and whatever more all those things no but the faith in my life proves to the world that those things happen hallelujah how do you know that his blood wasn't just for your soul but for your healing cuz faith is the evidence who's been healed who God's you know God's touched you amen now you are the living evidence amen that the blood atones not just for your soul but for your healing hallelujah amen praise God hello living evidence how are you doing today amen but you see now the devil wants to try and reason these things away he wants to use your memory against you and especially of of of things that you remember when after you became a Christian he wants to use those things against you right because remember the devil wants to an intruder will get in and say it's all about performance it's all about the victory that you perceive you have I say this if you're sealed to the day of your Redemption you've got complete Victory You've Won that's why I was singing that song I'm now seated at the table I don't know I've made it I don't know how you'd break that into a line but you know I've made it Hallelujah I've received the invitation I've come to his word I'm feasting on his word there's there's a seat at this table and the reason there's a seat at this table of his word is because there's a seat at that table on the wedding supper day for me Glory hallelujah amen praise the Lord I'm getting happy but you see an intruder way try and get you to diminish or sorry rather will try and amplify memories of past failures and if you let that thing grow your confidence will go down what you perceive as you being a Victorious Christian will go down like that snake will begin to grow that will take over your whole life where where it'll your faith where you feel how can I take God at his word now because I've done all those things amen that's an intruder that ain't you that's an intruder cast it out amen the word of God is here to get rid of those things thank you Lord Jesus amen so Jas had to come to a place of only Bel and this is where we are today God is conditioning us because he wants us to only believe not believe and reason not believe and imagine not believe and feel it you see faith is not a feeling but it will bring a feeling sure it will that's why we rejoice when we sing about the power of God and what he's done for us is because there's a testimony in here and then now what does that do because faith has come in then emotion comes out right but you see as I said a while ago this world is such a hybrid World especially into the realm of religion where where especially the modern Church they they they they they put people on an emotional high and what they're doing is producing an atmosphere that if people get to that emotional High then they have faith that's not always the case you see but it's a but it's a hybrid it's a it's a hybrid faith of not only believing who's ever who's ever had God do something when you don't even feel it I said about Anisa's tongue TI I've shared that testimony many times but you Shar that tongue tie needed an operation I you know and it wasn't just a snipper was around the sides I felt dead as a post but we asked God to loose it and he did did I feel it no but did I believe it yes right and sometimes you feel like you know you could conquer all things and you're just going to walk into a Rapture and God answers prayer that way too so never never diminish feelings but don't Place feelings above Faith No do you believe it it's not do you feel it brother BR never ask anyone do you do you feel he says do you believe Jesus said Do you believe it amen yes Lord I take you at your word you're more than able to do it praise the Lord amen so that's why I just come back to only believe praise the Lord so I'm just trying to now a squatter I mean a an intruder will always try and diminish the word of God as I've said before now Abraham came to a place in his walk now this is this was not in Genesis 12 this is in Genesis 15 that he believed in the Lord and was counted to him for righteousness so he came to a to a phase where he left his five senses he left walking with his emotional realm and it was just faith alone amen now everything now with your with your emotions so I'm just trying to find the quote here everything with your emotions everything is fine as long as it agrees with the word of God right so if you imagine if you imagine being healed that agrees with the word of God if you imagine Deliverance that agrees with the word of God right if you you know if you reason while God's word is true that agrees with the word of God so you can go with those senses in that regard but if it goes against the word of God what is that reasoning well I know God can do it but can he do it for me see that's an intruder yes he's done in other people's life but I don't feel he can do it for me that's an intruder we all know what I'm talking about right we all have mind battles okay you see that's an intruder we don't have to put up with that thing dictating to us to take the word of God or not you see so if they disagree with with the word don't you listen to them now imaginations conscious memories reasons and affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it it'll you'll blow a flu right quick see if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it that's right the engine if your memory if your imaginations if your conscience anything disagrees with that what's on the inside get rid of it what do you got then you've got a solar system Hallelujah God set the stars in order said hang there till I call you amen nothing's going to move them when God can get a man in his hands till he can get his sense his conscience everything cleaned out till it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world that can poke a doubt in there that's right he came right around and say you don't feel any better your conscience has even gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts Hallelujah the outlets blow a whistle glory to God it shines out certainly just as clean and clear for the word of God to work through the power of God see that's the main thing amen so if it does so so if it agrees that's good if it disagrees get rid of it it's an intruder amen praise the Lord so I'm just trying to find what see now um Paul would say this about Abraham see because many times he said therefore it is of Faith sorry for the reading but I was going to read a bit here that it might be by Grace the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who's the father of us all and as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which are be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and not being weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither the deadness of Sarah's womb how many times do we take the word of God and our current state and it's and and and what we're really looking at is is our current state how many times do we do that you see that's an intruder see the devil wants you to look from the word to yourself right so so if we look at how we feel like we feel like we'll never overcome God's far away we can never overcome this battle we're always going to be stuck in this we just all we can imagine is this thing is going to be with me till I go home that's an intruder but you see the devil wants you to look at that but God wants us to only believe only take him at his word like Abraham he didn't consider the state of his own self he looked all he sounded old he felt old he saw Sarah she looked old she talked old she felt old all those things it was impossible but he but but you see God see all those Intruders got kicked out of Abraham's life now I'm not talking about when he got made young again but before that all those things would got kicked out because his his imagination humanly would have said you can't be young you can't have a son you you know he came to a place where he where he rolls in the sand before God laughing how can this be you see but you see from that he God God brought him on because God wanted him to be the father of faith that the children of Abraham would be the same I mean that we come to a place we don't consider what's going on around us we don't even consider what's going on in here we don't consider what's going on in our family we just take God at his word see God wants us to actually not focus on on those things like Jas Jesus told Jas don't fear only believe basically Jas don't listen to what you've just heard don't don't listen to what you feel now that you've heard your daughter is dead and you feel that hopes is gone don't imagine what you're going to find when you get to the house and all these things no just believe amen those things are just Intruders D trying to stop your daughter coming to life again amen Abraham Abraham was in the same way he had to come to a place where you know he didn't consider those things he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief you see he did not let he did not let those things dictate to him to believe or not but was strong in faith why he was giving glory to God he can't see see this is what really blows those flues out blows those Intruders out amen is when you come to a place say God I take you at your word I don't know how you're going to do it I don't know when you're going to do it but you said you can do it you said your proom Pro because we got to realize Everything Jesus died for is yours amen every promise and it's not based on your current circumstances it's not based on your condition and how you feel you're doing it's what he has said see we got to get off this platform of looking at ourselves and look only at his word hallelujah giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that he uh what he had promised he was also able to perform don't we feel that way I feel the last 2020 before God has taken me on a journey Lord I'm just more fully persuaded amen that you're more than able to do it it's like you we think of the Rapture of the Rapture of the Bride how you going to do it Lord I don't know but I'm fully persuaded there is a people alive upon the the dead the dead in Christ are going to rise by the power of God we're going to be changed and with them meet the Lord in the air how's he going to do it by his quickening power but how's he going to do it well he said he's going to do it I I'm fully persuaded a Rapture is going to happen I'm fully ated amen hallelujah he's he's more than able to perform that even in even in this time that we live in where the world has fallen apart and chaos is on every hand but we don't look at those things and consider those things we consider God's word amen and the greatest B Li for brother BR talks about a man called Peter cartright Peter cartright felt led to have a meeting in a place this is this is how this guy operated he was a revivalist in the um in in America and he was he was one who really kind of spearheaded the Second Great Awakening greater Revival that swept through swept through America pardon me he felt led to have a meeting in a place one day he went in there started what cleaning windows and getting the place ready maybe it was an old barn I I can't remember the specifics exactly but the town bully came in town bully had a six shooter on his hip and came in Peter Carr's up a up a ladder he's cleaning windows this town bully says what are you doing Peter car says we're going to have a meeting God's God's called me led me we're going to have a meeting right here and the and the bully says we don't have meetings around here shows us gun all these things you see now in in Peter cart writes hard is a faith God said we're doing this right but now but now an intruder has come in and he's a physical man but he's trying to now play to Peter cartright's emotions he's trying to bring reasoning and trying to bring fear and trying in trouble and to to try and hinder what God has said he's going to do and then and then the town bully says to Peter car right well he said you're going to have to get through me to have a meeting so Peter car says well if I got to whip you that's the next thing I got to do so gets down off his ladder takes off his coat punches the guy gets on top of him and starts socking him a few and he asks him have you had enough he says yeah I did and then that guy came into the meeting that night he got saved Hallelujah you see but because he wasn't willing for an intruder to hinder anything cuz he felt lad no God's word has told me we're having a meeting am mean if God's words told me a certain thing it's I'm going to win praise the Lord now I'm using a natural ex a natural example for a spiritual principle right cuz what are we do we just Retreat when the first sign of something triy an intruder tries to come in or do we say no God's word said I'm more than able I can do all things through Christ Jesus which strengthens me amen I can be an everyday Christian because I can do that through Jesus Christ which strengthens me I can live an overcoming life Hallelujah by Jesus Christ withr I can do that or do he withdraw say well I guess what you know I can never be have a greater victory yeah I can if you know Peter cck could do it to the Natural how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ against spiritual powers in high places he was having a meeting in another place and there was a gang of bullies gang of bullies none of the preachers wanted to preach about 30 of them I think and Peter caride do you know what he did he took off his coat he started fighting them in the meeting they came back and they got saved and none of the preachers wanted to preach that night and he got up and he took his text that the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail and they had a Revival in that place and a whole bunch of people got saved met the Lord because he was determined no I'm going to win because God has said this is true we're having a meeting in this place you take that for any promise of God do you let an intruder come in like those bullies with Peter carite try and hold it back or do you say no Satan I'm not going to accept your fear I'm not going to let this doubt rule me I'm not going to let you use my memories against me and my failes and all these things I'm going to walk with God Amen see you take the word of God and cut your way through every doubt this is how you get rid of this is how you get rid of The Intruders take the word of God and cut your way through every doubt you see sure that's it what's the next job get it done right next thing I'm going to do is get away from my doubts cut it down that's my job get all of my frustrations away if my senses tell me you feel bad the next thing to do is to cut that away how do you how do you do that you take the word of God above your feelings I know this is simple but you know you got to you got to nurse off the promise like like Abraham God came to Abraham as El Shai I think Genesis chap 17 and you know he says I'm alite means the strong Mighty God but also means the breasted God like a woman that breastfeeds her baby and God is telling Abraham Abraham all you need to do is Nurse off my promise nurse off my word and you'll get strength from that so Abraham you may have a lot of intruders of your age and how you feel and what you're hearing from Sarah and the trouble and you know it would have come to a place in their life that because Abraham believed they were going to have the child but it would become such a contentious thing month after month Sarah do you feel any different no I'm the same it would have become very contentious right but so but God came to Abraham said Abraham nurse off my promises that's all we need to do amen we've got you know it's it's at our fingertips the promises of God I think we should just take those things nurse off them and you'll find Intruders begin to scatter where'd that doubt go where' that where' that fear go where' those things those things are gone because why the the soldier on the battlefield in your mind the holy ghost is now Taken full control amen that whenever whatever something comes in it's like no I'm not looking at those troubles I'm nursing off the promise see my problems don't give me strength the promise gives me strength hallelujah amen praise the Lord but you see now s because of this's just come back to this Sarah because of Doubt tried to bring the promise a different way because of reasoning now see her reasoning wasn't God will do it in his time her reasoning was well I can't have the baby so take haar and then you can have the baby and then and then her affections would be well I've got a mother's love I've always wanted a child therefore you know I will love ishma like he's my own and then there would have been the memory of the sad Ness of of of having you know an empty cradle no child in her life and all these things so so the enemy was using those things against her and then of course that brought forth an ishma but what she needed was a visitation of the Lord what she needed was a visitation of the Lord I mean to blow out all those flu and all those things and that's what happened in Genesis Chapter 18 when God came down in flesh and began to speak to Abraham and discern her heart and all these things that was her visitation amen then after that what happened doubt turned to Faith amen all those Intruders were cast out of her life and then she received the promised son that's why it's so important you say well there's an intruder in my life what are you thinking on what are you listening to what are you feeding on Amen you want to feed on the word of God that builds Faith amen feed on the music Christian music you like you should we we should only be listening to those kind of things right feed on the good things of God and you'll see that those those those Intruders begin to scatter amen what it starts changing your thinking amen like I'm fighting a battle you've already won whatever comes my way I will overcome what does that do that takes away fear takes away reasoning Lord I'm going to overcome this because you've overcome it amen praise the Lord hallelujah we'll come we'll wind up a bit here amen now but you see now we must reach to the promise of God not through our emotions as I said Faith brings emotion but you see what happens is we're so anxious to see things done you we're so anxious to do something for God see this little lady uh is is is no doubt anxious to to live she wants to be well others are here wants to be well and then we hear about that case like the doctor the resurrection of the Dead the mighty things that our God has did then we're anxious and the thing thing of it is is we try to reach through these senses to grab a hold of something there like the like conscience you try and reach through by an emotional way so many people lots of times have misconstrued the word and I've been misunderstood by this by making alter calls I said I wasn't much on an altar call not meaning you shouldn't make an altar call but somebody get somebody by the arm and said oh brother John you know what me and you be neighbors all this time come up here to The Altar and get down what's he doing I wish I had a Blackboard here I could show you what he's doing he trying to get through his soul on affections just like you know your mom was a good lady and your father was a real Christian all these things why don't you come and serve God see he trying to work through an emotional realm you see he's maybe he's working on what a memory through the sense of a soul Oh Brother John you had a wonderful mother she died a long time ago a memory see you can't do that it's got to come down the line of free moral agency that's choice right see you yourself let the word of God you don't come because your mother was a good woman you don't come because you're a good neighbor you come because that God calls you to come and you accept him on the basis of his word that word is what means everything that word if you can get everything out of the way all conscious all senses and just let the word come and that word will produce just exactly here see what's all covered with well now you say well these conscious and senses and so forth don't have anything to do with it brother Bram certainly it does but if you let the word come in and cover it with conscience then it can't grow it'll be a formed word that's why if the word comes in but fear comes it won't grow like it should right did you ever see a grain of corn planted in the ground and let a stick fall over it it'll grow crooked any Vine even that grows up will because something has hindered it now that's what's the matter with our Pentecostal faith today is we've let too many things hinder it the faith that we've been taught the Holy Ghost that's been living in us we've let too many things look at somebody else right reasoning will make you look at someone else memory all these things will make you look at anything but the word but you see friend we live in an age where God has conditioned us to only believe amen isn't it wonderful that the W you know that the Lord is so good that when reasoning comes in you can identify it and say no that's a that's an intruder trying to reason away the word of God or the memory comes out of a past failure you say no I'm not accepting that because that's an intruded trying to hinder my faith amen or your imagination if you'll never get well if your affections on something else that you can you can you can see these things and realize no this is an intruder God has given me faith that I can only believe praise the Lord hallelujah amen now I will finish on this thing because many times we think well I need to have an absence of trouble to really only believe no God Wants You wants your faith to take control in the presence of your enemies amen he wants see see see many times he doesn't change your circumstances he changes you in the circumstance right to give you Victory right in the face of the devil amen so sometimes we think well I've got to go back and you know how you know you know how many times people you know some people will um will will hear healing lines and they'll hear you know the testimonies of the prophet and those things are good if you re if faith if you realize that same God is here right now right but the devil try and cover over with a with with affection and pervert that affection and say well if only I was back there then everything would be fine what does that do that's trying to diminish the power of God is still here to do exactly what he did in the prophet's life you following me amen but the thing is we need to like I was like I was talking to Christine about this we're driving down the hill and whenever enforce I mean whenever Intruders come in you got to realize you got to you think I didn't always think this way right when you first meet the Lord you don't think about those things right you know doubts don't control you your memories or failures don't control you all those things no it's just like the world is new I remember when I met the lord it's like the world was all new right the sunset was new the flowers were new it was amazing amen but God wants us to stay in that condition but take us through a lot of things right so now we have a testimony that the faith we have received has worked does work and will work right that soldier on the battlefield doesn't change but you see what happens many times I speak about myself very much here as we forget that Victory see it's not necessarily you know it's that not that we go by feelings and maybe I'll get this wrong but you know it's that feeling like I remember when I met the Lord I I just thought man everyone's going to believe that Jesus Christ is risen and I'm like recently I'm like Lord take me back to that take me back to that because remember God hasn't changed right God hasn't changed people haven't changed but what changes many times is our attitude amen our Outlook what's happened is an intruder's got in where we think no this word doesn't seem you know we should be careful how we share and sure we should have wisdom but we're got to realize the message that found you and transformed you will transform every son or daughter of God it doesn't matter what condition they're in doesn't matter what state they're in I was a drunk lost University student without hope but God found found me and gave me hope amen that's why I thought if you know everyone's going to believe this now why because I met him or he met me we got to remember those things Hallelujah you know you know that feeling of Lord all people need to do is get into your presence and it you fix everything who understands what I mean you you that you just that expectation Lord all they need to do is get into your presence we can be talking at the dinner table we can be in church but Lord you just need to come down and you will change that person's problem you'll fix everything you you that kind of feeling Lord you can do it Hallelujah Lord you're more than able amen Lord you're here you're present your word is true and Lord you're awesome but you see the enemy tries to come and say well but what about you and what you've been doing and look where your life has gone all these things we need to only believe we need to remember and then go back in reality maybe I'm just preaching to myself this morning but you see we got to remember those you know just that feeling now you're that attitude that you're that mindset God you can save anybody amen nothing's too hard for you no circumstances too hard see many times we you know we start off like that but then trouble comes in and and looks like the answer never comes and we begin to reason what's happening our faith is trying to be hindered by as an intruder has come in because we're looking through our five senses what we see what we hear all those things we're to come back to that place of remembering Lord You Found Me Lord you moved in power Lord you answered prayer Lord Jesus you've done many mighty things in our midst in our own lives you've done incredible things Hallelujah and then what do we do remember that and then go back to it in reality amen I'm just going to finish there but I think we need to remember see the devil wants to use our memory against us why don't we use our why don't we let God use our memory child you remember you were lost I found you remember when you were sick I healed you remember when you were in in distress I comforted you I'm still the same I haven't changed I'm still here I haven't left you I haven't forsaken you hallelujah amen so why don't we let God this morning Chase All The Intruders away maybe I haven't C you know maybe I haven't touched on them all but what you need to do is take the word of God and look how your thinking lines up with the word and what your attitude is towards every Divine promise because if your attitude comes and says well yes that's true but it's not for me that's an intruder yes he can help that person he can't help me that's an intruder yes that family sure but he can't save my family that's an intruder well I just don't have enough money or I just can't do this that's an intruder if it's anything that that that would try and put a block between you and the word of God being fulfilled that's an intruder okay so I think like we heard on Wednesday Let's Go Hunt some Intruders let's let God blow them out of our Lives amen that we can that that that faith can take control that we can only believe that we're not confessing if see see many times you think you you think about an imagination you you your feelings can be very strong failure is a very powerful feeling who's ever had you you feel like such a failure you feel like man I might as well quit what's the point in trying you know Lord why am I even here you know who's had that I've had those feelings many times it can be very real but you got to realize no the word of God is more real than that feeling what God has said about you and I is more real than that feeling what you imagine all those emotions that go on in your life you got to see we've got to take those things and cast them down every and those things try and exalt themselves against the knowledge of God that's our job and bring them into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ so bring every intruder obedient amen bring them into captivity to The Obedience of Christ the word concerning you amen let's let's have the musicians this morning but it's [Applause] um amen as brother R says in that greatest battle ever fought the Church of the Living God is ordained to cast out the devil so we're called to cast out Intruders amen get him on the Run he ain't welcome here he'll try and come in but those Intruders aren't welcome because we don't walk now God is conditioning us not to walk by how we feel or Reason see all those things we're here to walk by faith alone amen let's stand shall we this morning amen I like to sing he's a miracle working God we all good no worries amen let's um before we sing let's pray we say Lord I don't want any Intruders in my life if you've been thinking negative been thinking down thinking the promise can't be for you you're living in fear you're worried about the future all those things worried about your family that's Intruders okay say Lord I want them out [Music] [Music] Faith father so I pray dear God that Lord is Lord I've gone through a few with them this morning but I pray as we go from the service later Lord we have time may we meditate upon these things may Lord we we allow the great light of your word to shine in our hearts Lord to say Lord if there's any of these Intruders maybe fears ruling my life or maybe maybe a sarcastic attitude towards the word of God or Lord whatever it may be fear worry anxiety or any of those things dear God may we may we say Lord search us oh Lord Try Us father Lord only you as we heard a few Wednesdays ago about the heart only Lord only you really know our hearts and what's really in it so Lord May you search our hearts today father as any of these Intruders trying to our faith Lord I pray they be cast out in the name of Jesus Christ Lord as you've ordained us to walk by faith alone dear God as you told Jas fear not but only don't be afraid but only believe Lord and
