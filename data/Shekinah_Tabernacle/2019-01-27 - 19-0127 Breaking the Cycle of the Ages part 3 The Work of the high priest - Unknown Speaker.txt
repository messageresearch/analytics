amen Lord truly is a wooden blowing this morning a man what you had your seat please we have some special announcements today so we'll just invite brother Ben amen praise the Lord hallelujah I mean we could our brother could be and if you could come forward and also brother Aram and good morning start of a new year so we need to you know we're gonna we've going to make some changes with Sunday school and and also brother could be now Deacon is going to just lay out a few you know go through the how we want to conduct ourselves in the sanctuary and and and in the church and I just want to read this quote before he comes forward and this is really the thrust of the intention behind this is that so brother brown says and you know it as I'd be not afraid he sees how God is my prayer to wake up the church again to an old-fashioned all-night prayer meetings wake the people to a spiritual atmosphere it takes that to bring children into the kingdom it takes the atmosphere right this night while we're sitting here if this if this right atmosphere would take place this entire group would be refilled with the Holy Ghost every sick person would be made well it's the atmosphere that does it you can take a hint put it in an incubator and keep their atmosphere right it'll hatch out a chicken not see see because it's the atmosphere that counts and if the right atmosphere is here Eagles will be born it takes the right atmosphere so we want to you know we shouldn't take this place for granted you we know that you know and compared to the great cathedrals of the world this is nothing but God has allowed us to have this place and the landlord has given us a very good rent he's been good to us since we since we've been here and um so I believe we should treat this place with respect because we've come here not to meet with one another we have houses to go to go out the back or here to meet God well you want to have an atmosphere where he comes down you know we can't just take four groaning well we're a Christian he has to meet us no we've got to come in the right Atmos right atmosphere the right attitude so just with that in mind I brother convene if you come forward and just um lay out the good morning church I greet you in the wonderful name of our love and Savior Jesus Christ I come before you would all love today just to ask of you for the few things that we have to get right within ourselves our church is a very sacred place it's very wonderful to have a church as brother being said yeah in the valley there's a reason why we are here so there's lots of work to be done while we are here for each one of us we have gifts and we want to use those gifts we want to call on those gifts and if you have a gift and it's not being used please tap me on the shoulder and I can point you in the right direction we have people we have seniors and elders within the church group that will help you and and and get you started I had a young man Caleb come to me last week being the first service he said please use me he likes technology you'd like to help out in the back that's what we're looking for I encourage you to please come forward there's lots of little things that we need to do within the within the congregation within our church group and and we'll need that help so taking point of order we're gonna start firstly with the fire escape routes so our entrance is in the front one 1/3 George Street we come up the stairs if you need the escalator we have the keys for that we come into the sanctuary we put up a wall trying to be a bit more private so the people standing in front convening or if the past days in front already the service has started it doesn't disturb the service but if you come into the service while the service has started please be silent and take your place find a seat for yourself try not to disturb the service in any which way what that entrance coming in we have two exits out the back and using the front one as well as an exit if there's a fire alarm or any emergency that we have to leave the building we can use any of those three doors going out try to do it in an orderly fashion single-file so no one clips over each other the back staircase is quite steep even the front the stairs we don't want to run out in trip over and we'll assemble out in the front of the building next to the concrete pad where the cars are parked now or if the fire is too big if there's a fire in the place we'll cross the road and be safe but no children are to cross the road without their parents so we just want to make it safe for everyone when the service is finished and the service has been dismissed by the pastor as much as it is a dismissed by the past day it doesn't mean to say everyone needs to run out in an orderly fashion we need to be quiet the deacon standing by the door shake his hand or the brothers standing at the door shake his hand children outside if the weather is good if the way this bed will congregate behind the door but what we find it is behind the door our children are too loud so we need some assistance there with parents who's finished pray and are willing to go out the back to be with the children just to keep them quiet while the sanctuary school stays humble and peaceful while other people are praying it's very important that we do not break that atmosphere as our pastor said this morning an atmosphere is set in that atmosphere we all want to enter in and we all want to be one with God at that time so we don't not need the disturbance so please parents if your children go out please keep them quiet in the sanctuary there should be no eating no chewing of gum no slouching and sleeping so all children that are aged school-going age I should ask a few this morning please stand up praise the Lord with all your heart when the service is on as well concentrate look forward pull from the past or whatever the God is giving him to give us let us pull from that this morning let us take a next step it's a new year for us we don't want to be same like yesterday we come here to be renewed to be changed to be washed so please all look forward no one looking back no one looking at the new person that came to the church and looking around and and being distracted the distraction hinders somebody else so we need everyone to be in line this morning and we're asking only with love we're not we're not pointing fingers at anyone we're not saying or calling anyone's name we all do it at times so please help us Lord this morning let's look forward let us see what's happening in front of us let us keep our heads focused up high because the Lord is here with the blink of an eye we'll miss him we don't want to miss him this morning all right we put up a wall at the back as for that door that we go in so as we go into that door keep it quiet keep it keep it such that the sanctuary can still continue the musicians I hear the music's playing be respectful to your brother and sister that are in the sanctuary while we go out the back so children I ask you please take the instruction from mom and dad follow those instructions you will be rewarded one day I don't know what what but the Lord knows what he's got in store for you I can't tell you that so please when you don't go out the back please be quiet y'all can talk no one says you don't talk you talk but be such that you're all playing in harmony and no one's raising their voice and everyone's taking care of each other mums and dads when other parents are praying and you have to go out please make sure you keep their children out so the mom and dad can continue praying in the century because what happens the children run back to mom and dad they go out for five minutes they come back and they disturb mom or dad that's praying so please keep their children out while mom and they had a continue to pray in the front all our instruments thankful for our our musicians who come here week in and week out those are the key the instruments are the key that we have here plus their voices they come they prepare themselves they enter in they pray about it through the week they prepare their songs but we need their songs and the instruments so children pass this front row y'all are not allowed to touch any instruments in front the instruments are really expensive we're going through a whole change at the moment with the sound and things of working things are not working please do not come in front and touch any instruments these are the people that are in charge of the instruments and they will stay in charge of the instruments the back disc is well the sound disc no children is allowed at the sound disc whether your dad's there your mom's there no one's allowed thee there's only key people that are chosen to be then they got a job to do so please do not go to the sound disc and touch anything it comes to the air conditioning the TV or whatever screams we have to allow us to all be within the service do not touch anything children please all right I just want to say with all my heart I love each one of you please respect our house our sanctuary that God has given us we got a place that other people don't have we are so thankful that we could be gathered here in the mornings we can be gathered here on weightless day night if we're gonna meet with the pastor or me to the deacon this is a place that we have it's a place that's mutual it's a place that we all can come and we can speak what we want to speak and we can we can be one ourselves in this house of God so let's keep it holy I'll ask if you want one more thing parents this going to be you church starts at 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning brother man is going to come with the times for his Sunday school just now so I'll leave him to do that if you're not part of the Sunday school and you're coming as adults please at least 5 or 10 minutes earlier before the service could start let us all be prepared to enter in we don't wanna come just land ourselves here at five past 10 past him and expect to get everything that we want let us ready ourselves the time is so close the time is now if we're gonna just walk in walls out whatever we feel like it's not gonna work for us let us come in expecting each Sunday expecting each witness day that we're gonna get an answer we're gonna get breakthrough that's what we're here for we're not coming here just haphazardly to come and take a Pew and sit down do you know God is in that pew God has been sitting there this morning before you got in he's been waiting for you to come in so why are we the ones late so time is of the essence the time is now if we're going to miss it that's it we are lost we are waiting for the rapture to come what are we gonna do if we have five minutes late where's my mom where's my dad where's uncle so-and-so where's brother so-and-so he's gone we missed it let us not miss the opportunity and that's what it is the Lord has given us the opportunity to be here he's chosen each one of you by name he called you out by name not because my wife was him not because your brother was you know your sister wasn't it called you sister Maggie he called you brother Andy he called you brother David by your name he knows you he knows in your heart what you are who you are and what you have in store in your life he wants to give it to you but you need to be ready you need to be prepared right I'd like to welcome again once more them brother Paul and family my sister in the back my Berg family brother James O'Day and family welcome to our church it's a new year anything you need please call on me our pastor is here but our pastors got a bigger job if anything that is required within the church congregation and I can help you please call on me be 24/7 mind phoning on I might miss the first phone call or whatever but I will return it alright please call on me to assist you in any which way and I might call on you to assist me in certain ways so please brothers and sisters call me first before you trouble pasta for anything that is required all right each one has got a job to do so use those people that are in the positions but as I said I might call on another brother or sister to help me with certain things that I might need help with I'm not perfect so please let us join together let us hold hands together let us not look at a brother or sister with a log in the eye or splinter in the eye and think I'm better than him or he's better than me let us have a new year let us take the next step in our walk in our lives all right thank you very much for hearing me out I appreciate you with all your assistance with the children we all have children they all do different things outside especially climbing over the walls and stuff later I'm just concerned about the children so please if you see the children doing the wrong please tap them on the shoulder bring them down tell them to calm down and go to their moms or dads if they are not praying if they are praying send them to me god bless you thank you brother could be and appreciate that so now just for our cool brother arm and up so with Sunday school so we're going to we're going to change the time of Sunday school because what we want to do is we want to have the right atmosphere in here and so what we're so I've talked about the Ramona talk to brother could being about it we've spoken to the teachers and so what we want to do is we want to start Sunday school at 9:30 and it's going to go to 10:00 to 10:00 so this way everyone has 10 minutes to so everyone will be in the sanctuary before the song there even comes to the pulpit so we're all ready for the worship that's that's what we want to do and you know and in that way also you know he's not rushing and half the musicians doing up halfway through the song service and so we're all here and ready and also since since you know the Sunday School teachers they only have 20 minutes and it's that 20 months is not long to to share something the Lord's put in your heart to the to the children so what we're asking is that if you if you turn up late and everyone will turn up late eventually sometime we'll be late one time but if you turn up to church just say 9:30 five-ish can you please not send your children into the sunday school but keep them on the and the seats with you because otherwise what happens is the teacher starts then someone comes and they start they listen again someone else comes and they study this listen again and then they you know either go overtime or they can't get their lesson through so we're wanting to have it this way that the that we help our Sunday School teachers so they can deliver what the Lord's put on their hearts and yes that is that is really all I have with that so we're gonna start so this coming Sunday there's gonna be there's gonna be the first Sunday School class let's start at 9:30 and if you're here just say 9:30 five ish just keep your children with you as opposed to seeing them in the class but we're here for it's gonna be a wonderful year I mean brother oh man would you like to come and another man's a sunday-school superintendent and God bless you good morning Saints I just I just want to add to brother Bennett Ghana does push the Sunday school teacher overtime which goes into the service time which just puts everything about out of a cater so we as Sunday school people we have the responsibility to keep our timing so the teachers know about it we we did have the meeting and we all agree not that we don't want the children in the classes it's not absolutely not about it we just don't want to push everyone out and any other day we back in the same routine that's the only right while we have rules things just to keep it all tidy Sunday school starts back on the 3rd of February which is next Sunday we still have the three classes which is the lambs the Lions and the Eagles so the teacher of the Lambs and these three teachers this year would be sister Bronwyn sister Chantel and sister now me I put the names forward for the little class so god bless you thank you for for taking it again then the Lions class would be sister teareth in sister Shannon so you guys will still go fight the sword wield it and do what you do the based and then the INGOs class would be me brother either one brother Andy and sister Christine so are we gonna do that is we're just gonna alternate a bit to to get a female teacher in there as well to help the young ladies as well we've got a lot of young ladies in they so we just pulled sister Christine in and kind of put it to work so thank you sister Christine and brother either one because he he really got a burden for the young ones so you have to use their fire just keep adding it so the Sunday School ages I just want to run over I didn't make a note of it because I didn't want to miss it so the little class which with the lamps is from three years old to six years old or four but four to six right okay four to six and then the Lions the mighty Lions is seven to nine years old and then from 10 to 15 is my class the reason why I say 15 is I'll just throw it out because brother Branham CSD and I made a note of it church order in 63 he said that the the youth class is up from 10 to up to 15 so we've got a couple of members that's that's gone over 15 at 16 years old now now parents I just encourage you to maybe go and talk to your children and ask them if they do want to continue in the sunday school if they don't just let us know then they have to be part of the congregation because they know they know big people you know but if they still want to have another year with us they more than welcome our doors always open so god bless you thank you for that and yeah let's let's look forward to a wonderful year and in also the youth will still be brother Isaac and sister Shannon they all still go on with the youth Knights so I think your God bless you for it thank you very much it's a great work you guys do thank you so much amen and also whether anyone would like to have a meeting with all the musicians just quickly after church as well I mean so god bless you all right as a little brother nd I'll turn the service back over to you thank you for your time you want amen let's stand hallelujah

we're here to do worship him his name will be lifted high I mean god bless you all I mean if you'd like to take take your Bibles and let's go through the laviticus chapter 16 look at 16 in verse 11 and then we're gonna read to verse 17 and when they drop down to verse 29 so Luke is 16 time and if you turn me down a bit okay Leviticus 16 and verse 11 we're gonna read down to verse 17 it says here and Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and shall make an atonement for himself and for his house and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and he shall take a sense of full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small and it shall be bring and bring it within the veil and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat which is upon the testimony then he died not and he shall take of the blood of the Bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times then shall he killed the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the Bullock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat and he shall make an atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanliness of the children and because of the transgressions and all these sins and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goes in to make an atonement in the holy place until he come out and have made an atonement for himself and for his household and for all the congregation of Israel let's just drop down to verse 29 of the same chapter and sees here and this so feel free please to read the whole chapter but I'm just wanting to take a couple of highlights out of it and this shall be a statute for ever unto you that in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls and do no work at all whether it be be one of your own country or a stranger that sojourneth among you for on that day shall the priests make an atonement for you to cleanse you that you may be clean from all your sins before the Lord it shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you and you shall afflict your souls by a statute forever and the priest whom he shall anoint and whom he shall consecrate to minister and the priests office and his father stead shall make the atonement and shall put on the linen clothes even the holy garments and he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation and for the altar and he shall make an atonement for the priests and for all the children all the people of the congregation and this shall be an everlasting statute for you to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year he did and he did as the LORD commanded Moses I mean unless just let's just read just one more portion of Scripture sorry to keep me standing but let's go to Leviticus chapter 25 and we're gonna go to verse verse 8 of Leviticus 25 I'm going to read down to verse 13 and thou shalt number seven Sabbath's of years unto thee seven times seven years in the space of the seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto thee forty in nine years then thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the Day of Atonement show you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man under his position and you shall return every man unto his family a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you you shall not shall not so neither reap that which has grown of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of the vine and rest for it as the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase there of out of the field and the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man to his position I mean let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer gracious Heavenly Father we want to thank you Lord even for the ability to read your word Lord we just and we want to thank you Father for the faith Lord to believe your word and dear Lord as we have gathered father to worship you I just pray father that now you would take the service under your divine control father may you direct Lord the word father you Lord you open the mouth of a donkey to speak one day and so Lord you can open a closed mouth Lord closed mouth so I asked Lord you just opened my mouth that would be you your word only father and Lord may it find prepared soil of it Lord in every heart that brings forth one hundredfold and lord I pray that you just have preeminence in the service Lord may you anoint each one here and we want to thank you Father for this opportunity to be gathered in your presence Lord and we ask father for those Lord who are not here today Lord may be the apportion father in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless your you may have your seats this morning so I want to continue on on on my thought of breaking the cycle of the ages and I and I want to speak about the work of the high priest so last last Wednesday just to a very quick refresh you know I spoke on the power of the blood and how in this day the bride has been restored back to the original faith of the Apostles by the ministry of Malachi 4 and that ministry the purpose of it they would turn the hearts of the children back to their faith of the father's I mean so so so the the people in this they their faith would be turned from the Creed's and dogmas of man back to a pure Bible faith where Jesus Christ the word is worshiped and not man's ideas amen and we understand that this is not just receiving correct doctrine but it causes the believer to be transformed by the life that was in the blood of Jesus Christ which is the Holy Ghost I mean that that life would come upon you and would live in you mM would cause us to be quickened by the Word of God that the Word of God lives through you right hallelujah so now just as and and brother Brown speaks about this in the feast of the trumpets he says now I mean I mean this is my words paraphrasing me says just as the two witnesses of revelations eleven will turn the 144,000 Jews from the traditions that they have in thee and the dog one and chickens and different rituals to receiving the true atonement which was killed 2,000 years ago so the Gentile bride has been restored to the true atonement and this restoration will be capped off with the rapture of the resurrected Saints and those which are alive and remain to meet the Lord in the air Alleluia and then now in this this.h the power of the Cross is fully manifested this ages when the power of the Cross is fully manifested and this will be shown by living people being translated from this world into heaven right because the the purpose of Calvary wouldn't just be that we would be forgiven but the full purpose of Calvary would be a people would be cleansed of their sin this in nature would be purged out receive God's divine nature that be made in the image of his word and it would ultimately come like finish off cap off with a translation of the living Saints I mean because the fullness of adoption is the change of the body right so now we're living in an age because every former age if one that died in faith you know they believed that they would be that group as the Apostle Paul would write to the Thessalonians we which are alive and remain amen and speaking about the rapture cycle and no doubt when they receive that letter they thought we are there those that are alive and remaining I mean but it wasn't for them it was actually prophecy for us in this hour right but they died in Christ and they will come forth like will come forth right so every true believer from Calvary down to now they'll come forth jurors we will be changed hallelujah but now there has through you know there has to come when the fullness of Calvary is manifested in a people and this was demonstrated in the ministry of brother brand by the power of the spoken word where where storms were spoken out of existence life was created yoke answers was spoken oh yeah yeah you know we're we're of course it disappear the power of God's love was predicted people were delivered I mean there was that your power of the spoken word was manifested because God wanted to show us this is what the cross really does Amen so now so so the fullness of the power of Calvary is here right but we've got to understand as we read that the high priest had to take the blood into into the holiest of Holies and he sprinkled the blood seven times speaking the same blood was given but it was shared it was given for the believers down seven Church ages right so now the blood is extremely powerful we know that there's power in the blood to cleanse any Center I'm fully convinced there's a power in this room that not there is nothing upon the earth that cannot be healed there's nothing that cannot be restored there's no complex to great there's no hurt to deep there's no wound to Grievous I mean that that God cannot heal cannot mend and not just patch up and get rid of I am fully convinced about that there is nothing that cannot be conquered there's nothing that cannot be cleansed there's nothing at all that you can imagine or speak of I mean it God cannot fix hallelujah so now the blood is incredibly powerful I mean but we need a high priest to administer the blood right so it didn't matter if we go back into the Old Testament it didn't matter how perfect the sacrifice was you could examine the lamb it can be a perfect lamb it can be you know its grandparent great-great grandpa give a perfect perfect Lambs all the way down but without the high priest to take the blood into the Holy of Holies that was all in vain there had to be a man that was dressed a man that was anointed a man that was commissioned into the job a man that could take the blood into the Holy of Holies on behalf of the people but if yeah if we're Israelites I couldn't go in there I would die you couldn't go in there if you're not the high priest you can't go in doesn't matter house and say you were had not you were how right you were you know you could live the law to the leader and be very devout but if you were the high priest you could not take the blood on your behalf and you needed a man to be there I'm in a man to be that would take the blood in that your sins would be forgiven hallelujah this is incredibly important and I just trust if you don't get anything out of the service you'll appreciate the work of our high priest partly because at the end of the at the end of the day if we are translated from this world to the next world our testimony will my testimony will be he did it for me he did it I'm just here because I'm a beneficiary of his resurrection I'm a beneficiary of his grace it's his work he just said I'm going to be there if I'm and a piece or day me to be there I'm gonna be there and you say what about your free will I say give you a free will over to him and press into the kingdom I mean how do you know you've been redeemed you no longer once your own will you want his will that's how you know you're being redeemed so it's no longer what you want in your ambitions it's his ambition is what he wants hallelujah so I trust you can look at your life you say well I want to do my own thing you need to be redeemed I mean while this pressure and things of life not just give your life over to him give you a will over to him and he'll take care of you doesn't matter what pressure comes on I mean I'm fully persuaded I mean that this that the enemy will not defeat thus pride right that the enemy cannot defeat her we will walk out of this world not survivors not victims we will walk out as overcomers in this age by the power of the lamb by the power of the blood hallelujah so every true believer is not trusting in their own ability right but they are trusting in God given ability I mean every true believer is trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ alone amen and they see so they but they don't only talk about the blood right but they see his transforming power changing them into his word that's how you know that the Bloods been applied to you is that you are going from glory to glory right you're becoming more like his word every day now the Apostle Paul would speak in second Corinthians three said but there mine's will blind and speaking of Israel unto this day remain if the same veil and taken away in the reading in the Old Testament which Vail has done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the Vail is upon their heart now I'll say this it's not just the Jews that are veils upon the heart I mean we're all bored with that kind of unbelief Vail hallelujah but now nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord that Vail shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and we know if you look into that desperate no that just doesn't mean you do whatever you want but you're no longer a slave you become a son you know a slave to the devil anymore you've been liberated by the blood of Jesus Christ and now you're a son or daughter of God I mean but we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord I changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord so now you know that you know that the veil has been taken away from your heart amen when your eyes come open right and you know when your eyes come open I mean when you see that God is not a God of history he's not a God of tradition he's not someone else's testimony but he's your testimony I mean he becomes alive and real to you that's that's when you know your eyes are beginning to come open hallelujah because there has - God has to open our eyes take the veil out of the way that we believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him right so so there has to come a time where it's not well he was anyone can say he was but you gotta believe that he is he's the present God and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him hallelujah so now so so that's how you know the veils been taken because people say well how do I know I don't understand all things I don't understand all things either you got to walk with him as you walk with him he opens his word to you he becomes more real he becomes more alive right but but a good way to see is that you're not clouded over but you see he's there with you now hallelujah now so and and also I'll just say this down if the veil has been taken away and if we're beholding His image we're beholding his word it changes us from glory to glory should we not be looking at His Word right should we not be should we not be listening to the message so will not be prayerfully listening and reading right if we believe who believes this is God and printful and if the veil of traditions being taken out of your heart and you see him in this day I mean then reading this prayerfully Amen you are changed into the image of the word hallelujah since your I was thinking your last year you know we had that service after camp I said youth right the pantry of God's Word I mean wine you get in there right in the food food pantry you know y'all seen your mom doesn't want you writing the pantry but she'll be happy if you write God's Word I mean get in there and get out the get out the courts and the and the and the scriptures and begin to cook something I meant because you got to believe now as you're listening to it and as you're reading it is transforming you into his image there's a purpose it's not just to fill you hid with religion but as that God would make you into his image hallelujah so I mean are you right the pantry raid the pantry you know it shouldn't be in all just I just put it on your lap it should be when you go into the senior sunday-school it should be our mind actually sits in the corner and listens because you're giving the listen I trust you don't mind me saying it I mean because you know if you've had a wonderful face do you tell people about it would you say you know you just keep no you so I had this I went here is was wonderful and you just rejoice you tell people about it amen because you're full of something it's going to come out right so if you fill yourself with the word it has to come out you can't help it hallelujah so that's how it should be a meaning but then also you've got to take your place in the body I mean I saw all of you standing saying hallelujah Amen why I said take your place well now the devil one doesn't want you to take your place he's gonna fight you you're gonna fight them back as brother pretty soon you're gonna put your finger in his face and say get out of here even every bluffers Bluffs you it the same way you would have tell the devil to get lost I mean kick the devil off your Mountain kick them off your mountain take them up your position hallelujah so we should be you should be there's untapped resources well the ramp says it's untapped resources and God untapped that means it's never been seen it's never been delved into it's never been probed into you say well I trust there's some prospectors in here I mean you say well I've heard it before I read it before hear it again read it again you'll find things that you never did that you just glossed over hallelujah I dare you I double dare you hallelujah tap into it I don't want to be a living Facebook you know you are what you eat yeah you will become what you behold whether you like it or not you may think it's ridiculous to begin with but if you keep beholding the thing that's what you'll become right so what do you want to become because if you want to become this world this world has an expiry date it has no reward for you all it has is brokenness amen emptiness sadness that's all this world has that's all Hollywood has you know they pump out these music videos and all these different things and it's just people are living in a fantasy world and that's the reason they try and stay in the fantasy world because when they come into the real they're unhappy well but we're not called to live in a fantasy world being a Christian is not a fantasy world it's a reality because God is a God of reality hallelujah so we're not living in a fantasy world people are trying to become something and you know I saw this thing and I find the link but in Japan there's a term but is what happens is there's like a million they they think it's a million youth young men 16 to about 32 and they withdraw from society and they basically live in their rooms staying with their parents and they don't come out because they've if something's happened to them maybe they'd be made fun of at school or something and they withdraw and they stop going to school they stop working they stop going to university with whatever they're doing they just live in their rooms and they live off media there's like a million of them this is this is true I'll get the link it off did you show clip on BBC and I was amazed and the reason they do that is because apparently Japanese culture they see it as Japanese culture doesn't help the week you got to be strong and if you're not strong you nothing so these ones have been wounded they've been hurt you know one one of them so so what they also have is they have these people and they're called rental sisters and they're and there's this organization where these with these women get paid by the parents to be like the sister and they try and coax the young man out develop a friendship try and get him out and try and basically rehabilitate him I mean he have been rehabilitated they get jobs that become normal people once again but because of a wounding because of like one guy he said his voice was too high who's made fun of at school and he ended up like this for a couple of years now what you know why are you saying these things we're not here to withdraw and live in a fantasy world because I'm sure you could agree that is not reality that is living living through a screen as a fantasy world right be cut but because they can't cope with the pressure of normal life they become that way because that becomes their coping mechanism right but our coping mechanism is not to earth draw and become like that you say well that's in Japan no that's in New Zealand that's not just here that's here it may manifest differently but people become this I can't member what the Japanese word for us but they become like that we're not called to become like that friends we're caught to live in reality and our Lord Jesus is our coping mechanism right if you can't handle life people get strung out on drugs as I can't handle life or music or movies whatever more that becomes their addiction I say let God become your addiction let him become your coping mechanism is that I can't handle life I mean drink drink of excess of this get drunk on the Spirit of God hallelujah say well does that really happen I've experienced it I know what it's like to be drunk in the world I know what it's like to be drunk in the spirit and that is just a perversion of being drunk on the Spirit of God hallelujah amen there's a there's a young brother brother Michael Maloney who's at camp and because I shared the testimony and after the prayer line there on the last service whenever that was Sunday night or whatever it was he was for 20 minutes staggering around and he said to me afterwards he said I never knew what you mean but now I understand hallelujah because the Spirit of God struck him and he was like a drunk man hallelujah he said does that still happen absolutely it still happens I mean brother Brown says you can be drunk on the Spirit of God every day of your life until you leave this world hallelujah glory I'm glad that day hey just pass the bottle you know that's right that's why you raid the pantry right pass it around amen have you ever seen someone disappointed at a masterpiece of a meal no they get happy about it amen so you know hallelujah amen now so we are so we must believe that he is but now the problem is I'd say in this age is that brother brand will preach a sermon called spiritual amnesia in 1964 if you want to listen to a message go listen to that message his homework children will think of the tensions later if you don't do it but God listen to spiritual amnesia it'll do you good it'll do you good and he says you know he begins this brother BAM begins to speak about how the world the Christian world has got amnesia they've forgotten who they really are and and one way that you can get amnesia is be between two opinions as the word as the word right or is the world right and you and then you get between two opinions and then you begin forget who you are we're not cause to forget who we are this message once God wants you to know who you are not to forget who you are but then you would know who you are right who you are in him so brother BAM begins to speak it I just say season Jesus seed you of your father the devil and his work she'll do did you know Cain offered a good sacrifice to he is sincere built an altar knelt down and worshipped offered a sacrifice and prayed to garden of God that's all God requires for you to belong to church and have an altar and pay your tithes and go to church and live a good life if that's all he requires he was unjust to condemn Cain because he did the same thing yes sir it's exactly right but religion means a covering and you can't be covered by your own good works there's only one thing that God will accept and that's the blood of Jesus Christ that's the only covering outside of that if you say well I keep a Creed that's spiritual amnesia that's what happens now notice they forgot their word they forgot the Bible they they have forgot the promise they're trying to live in the glare of what the Methodist was what the Baptist was what somebody else was that's the promise of the day and God speaking it through his word and confirming it again and proving that it's so and they still don't believe it that spiritual amnesia it's exactly right total amnesia absolutely don't believe it at all he's a French soldier I was told a little story he says about a French soldier there's a bunch of soldiers from in the army and they had this amnesia cuz of shock on shock on battle so they were shell-shocked and they forgot who they were because the bombardment of the enemy was too great sometimes we can be bombarded right this is not a picnic we understand that with this is not a picnic beau Graham says you have one yeah you have one weak spot do you got to keep it covered and the devil is the write to that one punch hears that and and brother says you got to keep that spot covered hallelujah so now because we not have been we are built the same way as the people in the world the only difference is we have a seat of predestination in our soul right that that God quickens byers word it comes to life but we have the same spiritual realm right we have the same physical realm right the only difference is we have a soldier on the battlefield called faith in God's Word hallelujah we have the Living God on the battlefield but never will still come in he's not a gentleman right he's he's very aggressive and he's free you know he's very blatant he doesn't care what God is doing he'll still step in and just try and Rob hallelujah so now that's why we got to kick him off our mountain and so now these soldiers because of because of shell shock I mean they forgot who they were and they couldn't you know and and and the doctors and things they couldn't awaken him to realize who they were worse they're going to ascend into a sanitarium and they were they were on a train and the train stopped and one of the soldiers got out and he began to start walking and the guards just said hold on we'll just follow him and he walked he came and he looked at something and then he walked over here and he and he saw you know and eventually he came to a path and he came to a house and on that house was the old man the old man came running down embraced him and said I knew you'd come home son and as soon as the father embraced him his amnesia Brooke probably realized who his father was hallelujah and it's the same thing now if you that's why I say raid God's pantry because you may find yourself in the word but you may find yourself going down through familiar places like the soldier with amnesia he says I think I recognize this but I don't know Walker I think I recognize this but that house looks familiar I'll go have a closer look and then his father comes out white sir if you if you get into God's Word you may find yourself identified there as a believer right because that's what this Isaiah it's what you feed on is what you'll become amen brother I said and the boy he said he looked coming out of a porch was an old man with a cane and his head came out throw his arms around and said my son I know you would return they told me you were dead but I know you would return and the boy came to himself his amnesia left them he could identify who he was he knowed that was his father Oh soldier of the Cross has been shocked so me was so much trading so many shocks of denomination and creed and things of the world why don't you just step off for a few minutes and look around at the Bible might wander around and you and you might find yourself identified here in the word as a believer hallelujah and that's what we want to do you want to find ourselves in the scripture because Facebook ain't going to help you Pinterest ain't gonna help you Instagram ain't going to help you you know social media and depression is linked you know that's been proven that people who feed themselves on social media become depressed why is that because a false image isn't put in front of people and they know subconsciously they cannot it never obtain to that all the photo all the professional photos are staged it's not just hey take a pic this is cool it's all staged and there's a lot of thought goes into it and and and and they're trying to make this you know make this false impression this is how my life is but they don't show you the three hours to actually staged the photo right but then people just take it as truth and they become depressed because they can't obtain to it so this only has made me happy you're saying that makes you happy read this listen to the message you'll make you happy hallelujah it's not linked with depression hallelujah let's beat hates being proven you see the yo you're the Apostles weren't there Pentecost there Pentecost fully come God came and dwelt in them will they depressed no they are very happy they sterilized wrong people hallelujah they're rejoicing amen so it's not linked with depression now so in the Old Testament we see that the the the office of the high priest was vital I mean because he had to be the one you know so the forgiveness of the sins of Israel really hang on that one man okay on him only that was the high priest Israel could have the perfect sacrifice but without the high priest offer the sacrifice of wouldn't do any good it was the high priest that took the blood and once here to sprinkle upon the mercy seat for the sins of the people now we read those two scriptures there in Leviticus 16 and then also Leviticus 25 because on the day of atonement that we read about two things happened one was the high priest winning with the blood and and and the PTO on behalf of the people that their sins would be forgiven and number two was when the on the fiftieth after the seven Sabbath's on the fiftieth year right on the day of atonement the trumpet sound was of the Jubilee were sent out through the land so there was a cycle of Sabbath's but there came a point where that cycle was broken that everyone could return to their position because of the high priest going in with the blood that was linked with the jubilee trumpet sounding hallelujah and now we are living in a date now our lord jesus is our high priest go read the book of hebrews he is our high priest right we don't have a high priest year after the order of Aaron just a natural man but God became our high priest God became flesh hallelujah and the high priest and the Old Testament took the blood of an animal but our high priest took his own blood I mean within the Holy of Holies our high priest offered himself as a sacrifice I mean on our behalf and so now these two things are tied together where for 49 years there was a cycle of Sabbath's where people could be so young people were in slavery people had to you know sometimes sold themselves into bondage because of circumstances of life but there came a time when that cycle was broken and you see this through the law there's a there's a theme in the law where there comes a time of an end right where a cycle will will be there but it always comes to an end because God is showing us now that there will be an end of the breath there will be a breaking of the cycle of the ages wear timers no more sinners no more but it's just eternity rolling on hallelujah so now here we have here we have on this on this Jubilee year this this after the seventh year of the seventh Sabbath is that there be a day of atonement and the trumpet would sound and the purpose of that trumpet sounding is that every man would return to his possession so what he rightfully had in the beginning he would be restored right and it wasn't the man doing it but it was in though it was in the law and it had to be enforced that if a person wanted to go free on that Jubilee year they could go free right because the trouble was sounded the blood was given and it had to come into effect right if the people wanted it but if you didn't want to you know you're the law also says that if people didn't want to go free they'd go to thee you know the door of the temple amen and the priest would bore them in the air and they could never go free they belonged to their master forever but they had a choice I mean would they go free and that's why the devil he loves to try and make the world seem appealing stay with me everything will be fine and he's got a knife he's looking to stick it in you but you know it's not really that bad you having fun you're enjoying this right but because the devil doesn't want you to leave and he doesn't want you to return to your rightful position which is your position in Christ hallelujah this is the time so I'm announcing to you and I trust that you you you already see where I'm going but we're living in that time we've had seven church ages seven seven sabbaths you can say but now we've come to a time where there's time for the church a cycle of revival and death to be broken right that there would have come to an end of the church ages that God would wind up as plan with the Gentiles he would call out a bride she would return to her rightful possession in Christ amen she would go free and she would be restored Paul ouya and then the rapture will come amen so now this is where we're living so you know if we if we go to Hebrews let's go to Hebrews 10 let's just read a little bit more if you don't buy hallelujah I'm glad you know you say well you're putting all emphasis on the work of the Lord Jesus absolutely I mean because of it's not you know he he is the one who does the work right we are not our own we're bought with a price I mean we are saved by grace through faith it's a gift of God don't let these things become some some something without any power and of this absolute power in those kind of statements I mean where we see that it's not we are his workmanship hallelujah and we're depending on the work of our high priest hallelujah so Hebrews 10 and 1 we're just going to read it but here he says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged should have no more conscious of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for us not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body has thou prepared me and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure then said I lo I come and the volume of the book is written of me to do thy will o God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither had us pleasure therein which are offered by the law then he said lo I come to do thy will o God to take away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest standing daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he has perfected for them forever them that are sanctified I mean so the Apostle Paul is trying to get these Hebrews to see that the that the the blood of Jesus Christ him being our high priest is far greater than the high priest of Aaron and the blood of bulls and goats but it breaks the sin cycle right so once in your every year the high priest had to go and every year he had to take the blood I mean but it doesn't change the people that he was going in on the behalf of I mean but when our Lord Jesus ascended with his own blood amen and that sacrifice was accepted and he came back down on you know you know on to earth that that was done and it was attributed to you hallelujah when you're on the cross he was on I mean when he was on the cross you were on his mind right so now that was done for you right and then it came into your season where by faith you accepted it because it was done on your behalf as his name was announced by the angel you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins so he shall deliver them from their sins hallelujah so one offering was done and that was done on your behalf and that's why when you come and believe the word becomes a life do you believe it you see it manifesting that sacrifice manifesting in you or the power of it you're following me I mean because we don't have to go we don't have to go back to Jerusalem he doesn't have to die again it's already been done right it was done once did you know you know the disciples didn't know what was going on that was their lamb hanging between heavens and earth but it was attributed to them because they were part of him hallelujah because they were the feminist part of him and then and it was attributed to them that's why they went to the upper room in the spirit that was released out of his blood came into them and the same life lived out of them you know how high priest it's not a you know as the as the book of Hebrew said that he is touched by the feeling of our infirmities so he's not some distant high priest somewhere that doesn't understand your human condition but he became a man that he would know what it's like to be bullied he would know what it's like to be rejected he would know what it's be like to me to be made fun of you following me to be misunderstood I mean to be marked to be scoffed pressure of life to come and brother have says here though the Bible says he has tempted on all points yet without sin so he was tempted by sexual pressure everything you can name whether we don't with a right to sate or not he was tempted by it but yet without sin and and he was that way that when you come to the same battle Amen that you could say Lord Jesus you understand what it's like to be in my shoes and he says yes I know what it's like to be in your shoes I can relate to your present condition he knows what it's like to lose family right Joseph Joseph was there when he was born but when Jesus comes the age of 30 Joseph isn't in the scripture anymore why is that cuz he died he knows what it's like to lose family he knows what it's like to be hungry he knows what it's you know he knows everything you are going through or have been through he understands and he was made that way that's why he came to experience human suffering and pain that he can enter into your need remember Jesus is not a God's not a robot he's not just some statue standing there he's a living being amen and his experiences of walking upon this earth he still has those experiences in him hallelujah just like experiences of life and I don't you know I said it before but those who are learning to drive you can know all the theory you can know everything about the car you can maybe build it off the top of your head you know it that well but when you get into the driver's seat and you put the key in the ignition take off the handbrake begin to drive this is different because now you're experiencing what it's like to drive it's not theory it's experience amen and that experience doesn't leave you whether you want it to leave you sometimes or not because you did thing but you know what I mean but there's experiences that it's the same thing with him his experiences God knows all things but God had to become a man to experience what it's like to be you that he can understand what you're going through that he can relate to you know because that's why he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities because he knows what it's like to be sick he knows what it's like to have it you know go through great trials hallelujah and he still has those experiences in them you think yep you know it's like us some things we will forget but some things will still remember because God is not you know what you know what would it make you know there's no sense therefore we go through this how you are trials of life and we worship Him as a redeemer and we remember all the good and the bad that's happened to us we remember the bed we remember the good but then what good is it now but then our bodies changed and we forget all those things what was the purpose of what we just went through you say where you got the character but we worship Him on that side too when the lamb takes the book the four and twenty elders cast it crowns down and that's a representation of you says thou art worthy to redeem us back to God by your blood so they knew what it's like to be redeemed so they knew us like to be lost they know what it's like to be under the bondage of Satan and to be liberated and those people represent you you know it's not going to be when you know we're gathered around the throne and we will be and the crown I don't know how the crown is going to come out to crown them but do you think we're just going to go Bravo look it's going to be the noisiest place this place is a library computer well that's gonna be like there goes my Lords crime Oh a start worthy I'm glad he's been crowd I'm so glad I've been gathered here he's the one that relieved me he's the one the same make he shed his blood upon the earth for me or just to get a glimpse of him will be wonderful hallelujah because we know what it's like for who knows what it's like to be lost and you're wandering through world in you and you know you think you've got it all sorted out and you don't have nothing so you're just bluffing yourself it's fine let's get it yeah it'll work out yes this is gonna work and you're something around in a maze but then a light comes on and you look up and hand reaches down polarise this child come out of that place you know yes Lord deliver me from this thicket I can't get out hallelujah and you always like to be on the strong shoulders of a shepherd he carries you back to the sheepfold hallelujah amen I know what that's like and and that's why we're gonna those experiences we're gonna worship Him because of those things because you worship true worshipers out of Revelation right so you're gonna have a revelation your redeemed hasn't been revealed to you that he died for you that's more that's not mummy daddy's story someone else's story it's your story where Calvary goes from a historical event then you see he took your place there he was your son offering what's happened it's been revealed to you it's anchored in your soul you can't deny it any more than you can deny your own life hallelujah because it becomes a revelation and then now you can worship Him as your lamb as your blood sacrifice because it's been revealed he comes you says I'd die for you I redeemed you I purchase your salvation hello and then you can worship say Lord you are my salvation you're my strength and my song hallelujah amen and then and then and that's why that's why actually trials are so good because God is right in the trial he's willing to show himself and then you can look back from where you've been and yet and because what happens is God allows the devil to get on your case because God wants to reveal part of himself to you hallelujah and the eating go through great things and you can look back like at the end of the day said oh that you're lighting the beard think about your day I think you have a conversation with the Lord Lord Jesus you got me out of that car wreck I should have died there well this should have happened you know and you go back and he's like yeah we got through some things today didn't we oh yeah and then you say thank you Lord that was wonderful hallelujah because he wants to build a relationship you're following me this is our high priest he's not a separate God some place somewhere but he's down at our dress wherever we are he's there hallelujah Amen I'm glad he's that way I mean that he took on human battles that he could under he could relate to us hallelujah amen never everything now now the devil comes along and says he doesn't understand what it's like he doesn't let he'd even lived in this modern era I tell you what same devil was there as the same devil here he may have just rebranded it's the same old company doesn't matter the logo changes the slow go changes maybe the building changes the stationary changes same old company same old devil he knows so never let the devil think oh he doesn't understand you he's not interested in you no that's a lie that's a lie from the pit of hell how God is very interested in you that's why this message came your way as he wanted you to see who he is and who you are in him he's very determined that you would understand oh yeah but he does he oh but he you know he never had this problem he was tempted on all points Derek go his Oh more homework go find the scripture he was tempted on all points yet without sin and go look at the definition of wall it doesn't mean sum doesn't mean on the majority all encompassing everything everything you can imagine he was tempted that way amen that means he was tempted by a homosexual spirit amen he's tempted by those things peer pressure everything that comes against us he was tempted worse oh that's just a modern think no it's as old as old as old can be it's all here hallelujah so never let the devil think no don't believe the devil's lied that God does not understand you and God does not care because he understands and he cares he careth for you he cares for you the seals come open the word is open and and what is one of the sermons brother and preaches he cares he cares for you but then the question is do you care do you care do you care because he cares I mean what's our attitude back hallelujah it's a knell hearing is so the high priest now when the high priest came out because remember only the high priest could go into the Holy of Holies and so now when he went in with the blood all of us rayul they cared about it anyway we're waiting is he gonna be accepted was he dressed just right you know was he anointed just right remember we can't member okay just just imagine we're not Israel I mean we're not Levites we're not part of the process we don't help him get dressed whatever more we're just there we're on the grandstand it's up to him we can't help him in any way we can't put our own put we just there and here he is you see him going he's anointed his dress and maybe maybe something was standing saying is that right you know you're looking from afar off does that look right to you you know you can't do anything about it this is this is now this is perilous times cuz if he's accepted I'm accepted if he's rejected I'm rejected and if you read you know you go read the scripture not anyone could just walk into the Holy of Holies hey papa God how's it going just chilling out today so good you know not some blase kind of attitude if they went in that way they died God is not a respecter of person right so they wouldn't so he had to be anointed right dress right everything just right and they're waiting and in their silence he's been silent was he accepted I remember he winnin historically the high priest was here the book of Acts read about him then he ascended where is he he's either living to making intercession for us right but the high priest has to appear again he's following me Jesse no Rome go it's enough so so so now he has to appear so now here we are outside the courtyard you're outside the tabernacle what's happening you can't hear anything you waiting and then you see the fail come open if we're in there you know out-of-court you see a foot come through you see more cat and the Bloods been applied to the mercy seat hallelujah the blood has been applied and then we can rejoice saying he did his job Polly is anointed he win it according to the Word of God amen he applied the blood on my behalf when I could not get mercy when I could not apply the blood he applied the blood on my behalf and then other than a hill is Gimli trumpet ring supper go out there Israel hallelujah and you might be a slave you couldn't have gone around the congregation and your tabernacle and your and your in the field but then you hear a trumpet blowing I'm not going to try and imitate it being here the trumpet blasts number you're the chauffeur go forth and you can put this thing down I'm not it olia and your taskmaster couldn't stop you he had no legal right to hold you anymore you could go back to your position hallelujah you had the right to go back hallelujah and now here we are it's been seven Church ages as Jesus three two one five what is he how do we baptize what kind of God is he all tradition why cuz he's been behind the veil he's been behind the veil but then now we seen Elijah upon the earth a prophet ministry upon the earth and then now here he comes in spirit for men we're gonna meet him in the air right that's the end of the coming right but he comes down and spirit for it is little man he says now I'm waiting for someone I'm waiting for someone I'm just your brother I'm as helpless as helpless gonna be I'm waiting for the angel of the Lord and then you hear people's testimonies he didn't need to say he was there people knew he was there just such an atmosphere came into the place God came down and that same God I believe is here and God came down and he says now I take every spirit under my control for the glory of God that you would know that Jesus Christ is alive and he's present and people would come before the prophet and all of their lives are exposed name addresses sicknesses whatever it was hallelujah and he'll be standing there behind the pulpit and he would point people up he didn't say someone over here has a backache you know I could stand here and say this how it's got to the Lord the Lord telling me someone had a bad night's sleep over here oh you know better Oh someone over here's their back aches no it wasn't that way it's you you're praying for this this is why you're here you have this need this is your name I see you come from a mountainous place and names and everything go go people even receive it and then he asked the question who did they touch who did he touch who did she touch this 30 feet from me they didn't physically touch me he says they touched the high priests they touch your high priests I mean because he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities Jesus Christ is not a God of history he's not a God of our imagination he's a living being that's present and emphasizes they touch the high priest he say well what does that mean he is saying the high priest was standing there put on flesh and a redeemed son is this okay hey the high priest is in you the same Jesus it's the same Jesus in the body well I can say the high priest is in you but the high priest came down into a prophet a man in useless vocal cords to speak to people to show that he was there in spirit form hallelujah so now there's no more controversy amen what's happened the high priest has come out and he's here to declare I've applied the blood on your behalf I have redeemed you I mean I sprinkled my own blood that it's no longer a judgement seat for you it's a mercy seat I mean that you and I have mercy because I applied when you couldn't do it none of us can save another you know you know what kind of state we're born in none of us can help one another and it doesn't matter our intentions we can spend our lives we could spend a million lives trying to learn this and and go to every Bible school he's ever been and it wouldn't do us one bit of good without him applying Hesburgh because with that without his blood we're lost doesn't matter how religious we are we can quote the message word-for-word from 1947 1965 from genesis 1:1 to the amen and the end of revelation doesn't help you so without his blood being applied on your behalf you are as lost as lost can be right we are in the max that we are born into a maximum-security prison and is you can't tunnel out you can't you can't get on anyway you can't bribe the guards the devil doesn't want you out you're absolutely stuck we're born lost friends doesn't matter you can be raised in the message without a new birth you're still stuck you're still lost I mean but the reason the high priest has come out I trust us mean something to you is that he wants you to know your freedom has been bought I mean you're no longer the devil slave I remember you have been purchased by my blood you have been redeemed by my blood and the trumpet has been sounded hallelujah this gospel trumpet has been sounded that you can come to a realization was that sound and then something in you cries out the blood cries freedom hallelujah that you have now a choice you hear the gospel trumpet you have a choice will I stay or will I go now let's just weigh these two things up if I stay I'll be broken I'll be spiritually wounded I will try and find satisfaction my taskmasters will give me all kinds of things he'll give me a dead religion he'll give me drugs he'll give me YouTube to be buried into he'll give me broken relationship to broken relationship he will not give me peace so that's the state okay that is the reality doesn't matter how good it looks doesn't matter how great the Instagram posts are that's the reality why do many Hollywood stars and musicians die young because they get anointed with the spirit they're given all this fame and they're not built to handle it and they're trying to make a find an escape because their souls are tormented I don't condemn though I feel sorry for people like that because they're trapped right but Hollywood doesn't show you that side they show you the glamorous side it's not glamorous there's nothing to it nothing lasting so that's the stay okay that's the state what if I hear the trumpet and I go what's for me well let's just think is you okay I just say one thing there's eternal life there's eternal life there's a rapture there's a peace that passes all understanding you will know who you really are your identity will not ship with the sands you'll not be tossed to and fro amen you'll know who your father is I mean you'll know that your father is God himself hallelujah it's peace this joyous wiggle or full of glory remember the greatest the world offers is a perversion of the Holy Ghost it doesn't matter if it's in capsule form pill form full form music for whatever's it's just a perversion it's just a perversion and when you get hit with the Holy Ghost you may say what did I do just like in the world what happened last night I can't remember right but you have no regrets you have absolutely no regrets and you just want more of it you say you're just making this up no I've been there hallelujah and his joy is wonderful his peace that passes all understanding and it's not just a nice pie in the sky think it's a reality and when brother home came back from the curtain of time he says it's so wonderful so sublime no words can describe how great it is I mean he wasn't just painting it up right he wasn't just trying to paint it up he's saying that's how it really was it was so amazing I couldn't describe it hallelujah so there's your two decisions will you stay you say but this road has trials and hardship god that's good it's worth it it's worth it because God's developing character God's creating situations as I said that he can actually reveal himself the other devil the devil bought this fall into the world brought sin into the world and he did that that God could express himself in his fullness to his people how God could go to head him before the fall and Eve I'm your Redeemer I'm your high priest I'm your advocate I'm your sacrifice I'm your peace - they need peace before the fall do they need a high priest do they need blood why does he think that's all do they need they need a guide do they need those things know so these are there was a big part of God that was locked up he couldn't express himself and that was the reason he made man is that he'd have a relationship with you then he'd be able to express his heart to you everything he was that he would not that you would know him not intellectually but you're done by relationship right so the devil actually just opened the door that God could fully manifest himself to to us hallelujah he did God a favor I'll put it that way you're the devil with it he just loses you know the devil gets no credit you know he gets nothing he's a loser are you with me the devil's a loser everything he tries God just turns it around for God's good and and turns it around for your good hallelujah you know you have the devil had half a brain cell he would actually leave humans alone he would actually take his hands off human race because that way one they don't need God and to God can't reveal himself to them right it comes in trials in hardship that God comes down I mean it's not and everything's fine have you who's been desperate in their lives you've come to a desperate state now what you call upon God without that desperate state in that same manner no God allows it because God wants it because it's part of himself he needs you need to know who you you say well I don't like to be in a desperate state it's a good way to be it's actually a good way to be because God wants to come upon the scene now I meet you at last last Wednesday but Hannah Hannah was barren now this is not our high priest but God respects the office of a high priest Hannah was barren huh whatever Ike I don't even know the term for another wife of you know polygamy whatever anyway her rival wife I mean whatever it's called you know what I mean the man had two wives someone help me up yes take it one there we go thank you hallelujah oh my hey so the second wife she had the sons Hannah had nothing she gets desperate and she goes to the Tabernacles and Eli the high priestess death there he's back slidden he does yo he has no spiritual sight here she is crying out to God and he looks at her and says she's drunk and and and he actually rebukes her put away your wine don't come like this but here's you had this burden I must have a child desperation brings change it brings real change if you go to the right sauce that brings real change and so God God actually respected that Eli does backslidden state because he was the high priest and he said go thy way may God grant your prayer and she received at us from God and she received Samuel hallelujah now friends I'll tell you our high priest is not some fat old man who's backslidden right here's here's Jesus Christ I'm in the land of God hallelujah but if a woman can go to a backslidden high priest right and get what she needed how much more you and I when we go to our Lord Jesus how much you how much I when we go to him in our out of desperation hallelujah how God is prayer answering I'm very I'm I I'm absolutely uh uh southern poem I need to help me again but I'm sold out there's nothing he cannot answer there is nothing he cannot do a man that's yo that's what I believe hallelujah I mean so friends now if he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen should we not call upon him in our time of need you say well you probably say that every Sunday the thing is we have to start speaking we have to start really praying right because he wants to hear from you and remember it's not about your condition you say well am i worthy to to to receive what I need remember you don't come into the equation the lamb was examined if the lamb was found perfect the lamb was offered and the worshiper was accepted you're following me right and so number one it's it's the Lambs condition that mattered not the worshipers condition because the devil beats us around because we read the message we read the Bible and we and we see about how you know we we are we made into the image of the son and that's a bit intimidating yeah Kannada can I be intimidating you see how Jesus was how he conducted himself you see the life of Paul you see the life of life of God and brother Branham he said well how am I ever going to become like that he's following me and and and sometimes it can be way up here and we can you know we can think how can we ever obtain to that well number one I'll say it's not about you it's not about how you're going to get there it's his blood will get you there his word will make you this so the pressure actually goes off you you have to give yourself you got to unreservedly give yourself to his word right you can't hold anything back right but it's not you that will become us it's him if you let him do it so the pressure actually goes upon him not upon you it goes upon the blood not upon you amen why do we put why do we put pressure on ourselves why do we put all this pressure now the pressure should be upon him brother Brahim he preaches the breech he's more homework I can give you a lot I'm not coming back to this class again go listen to the breech message it's an event taking place the lamb takes the book opens the seals brother Bram ties his taking the book he says at the beautiful picture of this in the book of Ruth and you go to the Book of Ruth Ruth goes to a threshing floor she's a Moabite she has no part of the economy of God even said even sees in the law no Moabite oh no my bike can come into the congregation of Israel if have you read that so the law is actually against her but she comes to the threshing floor she sees where he laid down she had covers his feet lays down at his feet and then he wakes up there's a picture of because you're the book you're part of the book you understand whether worse is my sublime act in all the scripture the Lamb taking the book the lamb purchasing you or claiming you right so now she comes there lays down at his feet and he wakes up and then he says who are you they said she says I'm your near kinsman cover me with your with your skirt so now she goes he she cannot she cannot redeem her father-in-law I mean her her mother-in-law other Naomi remember she is now his daughter-in-law they are widows they can't give back their position whatsoever they are stuck just gleaning in the field tried to survive but yet they have a possession naomi has a possession in the land but she can't get it so they can't do it and and if Ruth put pressure on herself she said there's no way even by the scripture that I can become part of this that I can even help my mother-in-law to get back her position but she goes she doesn't look at herself the pressure goes on boys hallelujah no me says he's a near kinsman to thee go find where he lays gonna lay down there she avoids the instructions of her mother-in-law she goes there face down at his feet he wakes up she says I'm a near kinsman cover me with your skirt cover my shame come my past redeem me I'm a near kinsman the losses and their kinsmen must come and redeem us hello yeah and then now saw her cry because she couldn't help herself but her cry put Boaz into action though it may tarry it shall be hallelujah time doesn't mean anything with God oh it's been years it maybe is don't worry about time don't let your faith be anchored on situation or time or circumstance your face should be anchored on the Word of God and the Word of God alone that's what our face should be upon hallelujah and then Sanel she he he gives her six measures of barley he's the Sabbath holy gives her a promise she goes back to her mother-in-law and her mother-in-law says he will not rest until he's done what he's promised you this day oh yeah and so now but who caused that to happen I want to ask you the question who cause had to happen it was rose going to the threshing floor I mean that caused Bo acid to redeem her he say well I'm nothing no don't do you ever think you're nothing I trust this means something to you you ever think you're not worthy or you've gone too far or too long or wherever no don't worry lay down call upon him hallelujah and you know the end of the story he marries her redeems now his position restores it to her and she hurt her her first life of being a mob itís a wood Oh with nothing that's eradicated by Union with boys her life is no longer she's no longer Ruth of Moab but she's Ruth of Bethlehem I mean she is mrs. boys obviously him well ouya and now this is how high parisi it's not I know I trust does he mean I trust he's not just it's not a working relationship you and God but it's a love affair it's a love affair between you and God I mean then when we talk about high priests it's not just some office and some distant functionable this is your job description there's no he he he came to unite himself with you and he came in this day and he's present that you would understand you don't have to stay destitute you're in the stay under the slavery of sin I mean but the gospel trumpet has wrung out the blood has been applied and he steps forth why does the high priest come out from the veil as a show I applied the blood the blood has been applied hallelujah and why is this message come not that we just have Creek doctrine it's more than just Creek doctrines as the life of God has come forth Jesus Christ has stepped out of history that you would know that he has not a God that I was but he is amen and that is not not this is not a nice storybook this is reality but they know that puts into force now a restoration hallelujah where every man shall return to his position and maybe we'll leave it there until Wednesday but there's now a force this word has a force and this word has a force and it's determined I will restore my people I was thinking of those words I will restore the Lord said I will restore who's the I him the Lord said I will restore I will not you will I will I'm gonna do it I will restore everything you've lost I will restore it I will restore you to your position and me I will restore the bride to a rifle place I will and if you ever hear have you ever read those words in the scripture I will and it's God saying it it happens it's not the devil saying I will cuz it doesn't happen it comes to nothing but ashes and destruction but when God says I will it happens you can bet your soul on it it will happen hallelujah Amen god bless your friends [Applause] amen he's our high priest and shall we I mean we have a faithful high priest a merciful and faithful high priest hallelujah hallelujah glory to God I mean let's just worship the Lord shall we I mean I want to sing that song I'm amazed that you love me amen
