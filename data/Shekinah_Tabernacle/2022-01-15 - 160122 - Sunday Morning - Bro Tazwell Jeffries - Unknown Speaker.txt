awesome really [Music] you hear appreciated god bless you thank you musicians it's really i sent brother isaac a message a couple of not too long ago and i was actually i needed i wanted his number sometime back already i just never had it and i sent him a message to say thank you for the way he allowed the lord to use him at that camp in otaki just that the the way he just did the song services was just really tremendous and again this morning thank you brother isaac and musicians god bless you um i'll just if we could just read the scriptures and then we can take our seats i've got luke chapter one luke chapter one um and we'll just read some verses there um we'll just read verse 20 28 1 uh verse 28 um and this is when the angel came to mary and verse 28 says and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed are thou among women amen and then verse 30 continues and says and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and then just one verse in the book of john chapter 20 john chapter 20 verse 19 and then we can take our seats chapter 20. 19 it says here then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews so they were assembled somewhere and the bible says they were in fear or fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you may peace be unto you let's just pray one more time lord we we've read your word and lord it's all in your hands i can always say lord we want to follow your instructions follow your leadership that's what we want to do this morning so have your way in jesus name amen you may be seated this morning in the presence of almighty god i mean god richly bless you it's good to be here in wellington again and i was thinking now the other day this is like another home to us it's uh just so ah man it's like i won't forget there's a song by the end saying it always stuck with me by the edge you know i love this family of god that's what you are to us you know we might be wherever we are in different parts of new zealand but you know there's just some something special so i wanted to say thank you for that and you know we just experienced since we've got here just experience so much love from everyone i said it on on on wednesday and you know there's certain things that has happened um over our we we arrived here on monday and we're leaving tonight there are things that happened over this week you know it's just our minds laverne and myself are you know we just sometimes we try to process you know what we've experienced and what we're seeing but we just know that it is jesus christ you are reflecting him we see it in the things that you do and there are things i i wish i could just speak out but there are certain things that that we've experienced man it just makes us so emotional but we just want to say thank you and i want to say thank you to the milam's just for opening up their door to us and the strawberries they're not here and then no dear family and then there's the grain family the woodley family the all of you the brother paul and your family and you know you guys are just so so wonderful i don't like cool names out but you know it's just so so great actually when it's just before i go into the word i want to give a testimony if you you know if you're someone here maybe that thinks that the lord doesn't really or you you doubt or you question whether god is aware of you i want you to know that he knows about you he knows what you need um the last time when we came down to london to london why was it london sorry last time we came down to wellington um you know we are just transparent them open so um we came down to to wellington and um we went but the financial struggles it was a bit tough um my car wasn't working right and we couldn't come down with the car and then the lord sent someone into my home a friend that lives down the road by us and we got to talking and he said tess you're going to wellington i said yeah he said you know what take my bmw it's yours i'll fill it up with petrol and you go i don't like using people's calls but there was a need and i i seen that this was god so he gave us the car and we came down to wellington and then we had enough petrol sort of to take us home i won't mention names but we got invited out for for dinner and then after dinner the brother tells me about the des um would you mind just taking me somewhere so i found it kind of strange why was i telling you um i don't know the area i'll prefer driving with you but the brother said you know let's can you just take me somewhere so now we're in the car we fellowshipping and we're talking and and then the brothers should turn their turn they turn then i'm not taking note of what's happening and all of a sudden i find myself pulling up at the petrol station so i thought the brother wanted to buy something at the petrol at the shop and he says can you stop here by the gas station he had no idea about my situation he had no idea what we were facing at that time and then the brother filled up our vehicle with petrol and that got us home and when i when i when i thought about that i said lord you know you know us you know our lives you love us and the next person might not know what you facing but god just comes by the andy and he lays that person on your heart and so i would encourage you i mean i speak to myself as well when the lord lays someone on my heart do it amen because we don't know what the next person might be going through so i just want you to know we see jesus that's what we see and just continue to love him serve him you're an awesome bunch really you are okay i want i won't go further but i just want to say thank you thank you so much on wednesday even you know the lord the lord is just so wonderful you know certain things happened on wednesday in the meeting and the lord just just whatever i'm going to be saying today this is just the lord just impressed these things on my heart just to you know i want to be free by the being says be free so i just want to be free and i want god just to flow um you know on on wednesday you know the lord just laid something in my heart we spoke it and uh the lord dealt with individuals whether we you know you know see to whether we came out the lord really he touched our hearts and he he spoke to us and and you know it's so important that we respond to him because he's calling us up higher he wants us to grow he wants us you know there are things in our lives you know we know as human beings there are things in our lives that happens and and he wants us to just to let go and to let god and he uses his word to speak to us and you know on on wednesday you know as the burden was released and you know as we we dealt with with various situations um i i was so i was so um thankful to almighty god because you know it's so important that that the number one we respond to the word and that we are just honest honest with god and i actually came across this quote where brother branham actually says and i want to read this as an encouragement you know to those that um i mean when i say respond to the word i don't mean always coming up here for pray and i i love that and i i fully support that and but but many times even on the live stream you you find people they're sitting there and they're responding to the word they say lord i need you or maybe the word comes and says you got to make things right and whether they are wherever they are in live stream they would make things right they're responding to the word and brother brandon actually he says here in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he says you just have to get a little start meaning you start he says get your faith moving one time and god will do the rest of it and then he says if you can just get started so whether it means taking a physical step to the front and saying brother ben whoever please can you pray with me this is the situation i've got this problem i've got this struggle you taking that step take the first step once you've taken that step it's a step of faith and then god will take it and he will then help you because he's seeing that there's a honest desire in your heart to want to do right to love for him because you see that i believe the objective whenever the ministry comes and they and and they ministering to us the the the objective i believe even today the objective is to connect man to god it's you know it's it's it's it's fantastic even you know i and i i encourage my kids as well you know they they would come to me and say dad you know can you pray for me and i do that with all of my heart i i love doing it but i also encourage them and i say you know what you have direct access to the great king of kings to the lord of lords and and he he wants you to speak to him you it's so important that we speak amen so this is brother brandon actually says he says you know in the regime of the church i just talks about his desire and he says the one thing that he desires to see established is a true spiritual relationship between god and men where men become new creations in christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word amen so as you know the ministry comes and as we speak and whatever what whatever the lord has laid on my heart this morning you know the objective is just to for you just to to to build up that stronger relationship with our lord jesus christ so my title this morning by the end i've left it the same um it's it's a burden that's been in my heart and i've i think i use the title one time in another assembly not rfpf but i want to use it here this morning and the title is simply shalom to the elect lady that's the title this morning shalom to you the elect lady the lord laid on my heart to to to to encourage his people so pray for me as we just go through it and i'm lately i've noticed i like to to glide over the quotations of brother branham because it's just so awesome you know the things that that that we read and and i take a lot of these things and i i apply it to my personal life so in the message shalom so so some most of my inspiration really uh it comes from the the the shalom message and invisible union of the bride so brother branham says now my text for this morning it's an odd word and he says it is shalom he says shalom in hebrew means peace so when you say shalom you are saying peace so he says and that's what i say to the church this morning amen shalom amen and that's what i am saying to shekinah tabernacle this morning shalom he says in finnish it's called yuman rahao which means god's peace upon you now brother teaches us he says as we receive the word we become the word we know those we know those quotes and you know i grew up knowing the quotes but not putting it into practice not really seeing it in my life but as he matured me i started brother andy seeing these things in my life and as i am receiving the word i am seeing a change in my life now i say to the church shalom god's peace good morning it's a good morning we might be facing many things in life but it's a good morning god be with you receive that this morning god's peace go with you it's darkness all around us and we know that but it's a good morning amen it's a good morning amen to you christ is appearing amongst us we see it it's no longer just letter in a bible but we are seeing it in our homes we are seeing it in the church we are seeing it when we at work we are seeing it when we at uni we are seeing it in our lives so shalom peace i speak unto you in the in the in the hebrew in the lexicon that word shalom it's it's it's it's connected with a feeling of of peace we know and it's connected with a feeling of safety and as human beings you know that we we want to be safe we don't like to be in danger of stuff we want to be safe so when people use that word shalom and this is something under the hebrew lexicon it's related to safety it's related to health we want to have good health it's related to peace when we think of that word peace it just brings a good feeling we think the word peace it speaks of tranquility nothing on tranquility i'm thinking of sitting by the lake just watching the water just ripple contentment peace friendship that's what we see that makes me emotional at times to to be disappears of your friendship our relationship with god he's the peace that passes all understanding shalom walk away today saying i received peace in the greek peace tranquility exemption from rage and havoc of war peace between individuals security safety and prosperity brother branham says in the message shalom he says the world is in one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in and this was in 1964. false forward to now look around you this world is in a chaotic state and yet in all of this chaos and craziness and wokeness and what all the stuff it is brother branham says standing in the most blessed light that it ever did shine in this revealed word and what a privileged people we are to have received this light amen that in the midst of chaos and in the midst of everything that's just going crazy needs to happen we are standing and we have in our possession the most blessed light that ever did shine what a privileged people even if we just sit and we think maybe we look at our work colleagues and we look at how people are reacting they're not responding they just react you know reacting is the way i sort of understand the action is if you take your knee and you just do that and your he just the food just goes it can cause damage people just want to react and react and react but i'm grateful for the word of god that is it's come my way and has given me a peace yes you know i i we face many things in life but this is where i'm anchored in brother branham in the invisible union of the bride and that's just laying a platform he says it talks about the bride of christ and that's who you are that's who i am he says here the illustration here showing the relationship of bride to christ and then he identifies us as the elect lady so i i i want to speak to you this morning as the elect lady i want to address you this morning as the elects lady he says um the church here and this for the kids in illustration we get is the church is illustrated by a woman for those many of us know that a woman is always a type of the church because the church is considered a bride she is the bride of the lord jesus the son of god so this morning as we as as as as we're going to allow the lord to to just speak to us this morning i'm very aware that i am addressing his elects i am addressing royalty sister priscilla you're not just anything you're not just some downtrodden something but you are special in the sight of the lord you might think in your heart i am nothing but i want you to know in the lord impressed on my heart to let you know that you are special amen my new year's message is to the church elected that's who you are this morning elected in jesus christ not just the church groups but the elect and i believe this morning it makes me excited to know that i am speaking i am looking at his elects that's who you are yes we've got to believe that brother andy he says the lady of the church christ's bride that's who i'm addressing this is the handy this morning that's who i am addressing i'm addressing his elect and i include myself as part of it amen he goes on he says may i add to this woman grace may i place it in the bible he said as called the elected lady that's who you are amen that's who i am this miss christ he says the bible declares to the elect lady he says one lady amongst all the other ladies so they might have been if you want the picture in your head the high society of life many ladies out there but is chosen one lady to the elect lady one lady among all the other ladies was elected that's you that's me talking about mary he says mary was an elected woman god chose mary we read she found favor you have found you might think i haven't but i'm here to let you know you have found favor with him amen god has chose an elected lady i'm thankful that i can stand here and look at he's elected out of the greek lexicon that word elect it's it relates to being picked out it's like one in a million so there's so many people all over the world all over but god said hey that's mine isaac chosen by god i listened to brother ed's testimony yesterday and i said lord what a test chosen by god for the head elected so many other good people out there but god called you to receive this revealed word there are people and we know this right your people wrote today walking around with the bible that they don't understand they don't even see themselves in it but i am grateful to almighty god that this word has been revealed we are recipients of it we have received it brother ben and we see it in action in our lives in the greek lexicon it says that word elect means the best of its kind and that's what he thinks of you he think you are somebody the best so when you think i'm not i'm not i'm not you are the best i read it yesterday when you think you a weak weak christian his strength is made perfect in your weakness and you are chosen by him you are elected and walk away with us that i am the best of its kind amen chose me hey out of all that he could have but he chose me he chose you so when the devil comes and he definitely always wants to come and tell you you're not a christian or you're not worth it to this and that in the other you said devil shut up get away from here god has told me i'm elected god has told me i am the best i am the apple of his eye [Applause] this is real i'm not just giving you good words to excite you we're looking we look at samuel coming to to the house of jesse because god had said samuel i found me a man after my own heart so samuel comes and he's a man of god he's a he's a prophet hallelujah and yeah jesse's boys come before him and samuel standing there looks and says man this guy he looks the part but god said not him the next one comes samuel says i must be him man look at this the law says not him and one by one they come pause and i want to read the quote because it's so this is so awesome to me said joe vijayara god said i've refused them he says well he brought six of them and then samuel might have said haven't you got another one and jesse says yeah i've got the little old naughty fellow back over here herding some sheep i want to encourage us as parents not you as parents us as parents and the lord is dealing with me with these things we might look at our kids you know we want them to be where we are but we forget where we were at the edge or how we might have acted to react it at their age and we forget about the pressures of life that's not only on us but it's on them also we spoke about precious loss on wednesday i want to encourage us as parents maybe just let's taz also learn from this so jesse said yeah i've got a guy it's a lot he's naughty fellow back over here hurting some sheep but i'm sure he wouldn't look good as a king but samuel says bring him and as soon as little david with a little sheepskin coat on a little slingshot in his hand walking along toddling up like that stupid shoulder split maybe brother branham said the holy ghost shed that's my man not samuel saying that's my man the holy ghost said that's my man he knowed what was on the inside of him man looks on the outside but god he sees what's inside he looks in the heart i i really you know i i'm so burdened for us as parents especially me in the in the in sort of the stage that i am with my kids and i look back and i i see my friends and i see how when we grew up certain things happened and a lot of my friends just walked away and i said lord help me with my children lord just to be wise lord to understand to lord maybe think 18 year old thoughts and sometimes it's hard sometimes i want to where the kids are you know doing what they're doing or they're playing the music and i want to like be part of them and i try to act cool and i you know dance and go on like that and they'll say that no that's not cool and i think i'm cool but you know i just say lord help us even if we see alpha we think he's a naughty city a naughty fella god this see we as parents you know our kids they sit here in church and they're receiving the word the word is being preached into them and then and even at home you know they there are things happening in their lives and ariel i'm realizing more and more and more and more i need to pray more and more so we we we're praying for our children but you see david we see in there god said that's my man god chose him then just before i go on the enemy refers to isaiah 60 chapter 1 which says rise and shine he says darkness is gathering what's it gathering for to show the light he says that's the reason i can say shalom the light has come to you god's peace to the elected woman to the elected lady you and i john we reflecting the light of the gospel i was having some fellowship with brother matt now the other day and we were just talking and we ended up talking about our children i think sister priscilla was there in the van talking about our children and we said how it's quite interesting that we're finding people out there are making or saying things about our children that maybe we're not seeing but they seeing something and because they don't understand the word and maybe they don't know jesus they don't realize but they are seeing jesus through our children our children is reflecting but they see it as oh your child is quite respectful child's got a beautiful smile i was told one day at a place where they said one of my kids they said you know when when she comes into the room it's like the room lights up and then you realize it's not about her but it's because of jesus christ so you and i we are reflectors we carry this word and this word is light to everywhere around us we are loving we know this in times of turmoil i've i haven't been this way before it's going crazy gross darkness all around us times of distress all around us like i said on wednesday pleasure pleasure pleasure all around us and if we are not careful if we don't watch and pray that pleasure pleasure pleasure or turmoil might want to attach itself to us galatians says 5 1. was the first sermon i ever preached it says stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage so even as christians he's called us he's elected us we are his purchase possession but the bible does say that we can be pulled by our diverse lust so we need to just be watchful and be prayerful that these times of turmoil does not impact us or affect us on wednesday we heard don't sign for that box of rattlesnakes you have the ability you have the authority to say no because the enemy wants to try at times just to to hinder he tries to hinder our hawk with god but the brandon actually talks he says um you know he talks about the the three things money women in popularity and he actually says i think i was talking to brother about this he said that money was i think was one of his big things and he said that he knew that money was a problem so he says i kept a covering over it and i couldn't understand what that mean huh why you want to cover up something but then i went further in other places where he talks about it and he says he kept the blood covering before that thing so he kept the word before it i just want to just read a little bit about that you know he says i have constantly done my very best he says he's talking now about how you know we we're talking with people and maybe we might disagree on doctrine or might disagree in religious terms but he says uh you know i've constantly done my best that when i'm speaking to ben and you know and maybe ben don't agree on something he says here i want to be able to take his hand afterwards with an open and honest heart he said he says i've constantly done my very best he says when disagreeing with man in religious terms but he says no but if i couldn't take his hand afterwards he says no matter how sharp the thing might be he says i need to stall love the person not he says just say it from my lips but he says from my heart and sometimes that's so hard but you are the elect there's something that's inside of you that will help you and i've had my experiences where i couldn't there are certain people that did so bad things and i just wanted to hate them and i just i didn't want to forgive them but it took almighty god to come my way to deal with me to let me die die die so that he could live so that when i look at that person and what i do is i test myself i test myself so if i see a photo of that person i ask myself how am i reacting when i just photo because in the past when i used to see a photo of that person something just comes up so for me and i mean everyone's different for me that was a test and and so i now when i the situation that i had i can now talk to that person and there's nothing hateful in my heart i can i can talk to the person and i feel compassion i feel sorry but it wasn't an easy road to get there it took years it took many years but you see i was so honest and said lord i need you more than ever and he would be the one to help me and yes so anyway he says here so you have your argument and debates and things but he says i need to love that person we must love the person amen and if i can feel that i don't like the person there's something wrong with me but now that's okay i think and i'm happy to be corrected and smashed afterwards i think if you come to that point that i'm still realizing that there's a scratch for that person whenever i see them or i see a photo or i hear of them for the brown says there's something wrong i think that's okay because as long as you recognize that there is something wrong so that you can go and make it right that's the that's what i love about my lord jesus he comes and he highlights these things to me in my life and he tells me you're the elect you are called and tears you bright but because you are pride there's just some kind of way you'd conduct yourself you know a lady they in the olden days and the posh days you know you'd have the ladies you should drink a tea a certain way you know she'll hold the cup and and you know they have this heighty tighty conversations and they'll you know conduct themselves a certain way to society but we don't just do that you know in public in private we also conduct ourselves as sons and daughters of the most so even if we find you know that you know that thing there as long as we recognize that you know what that's an issue that needs to be dealt with we deal with it that's who we are i mean it's hard i know that but we just deal with it if we need help we have people that's willing to help because we want to grow together and why i read that is when brandon goes further he talks about jesus christ he speaks about the spirit of christ he says the spirit of christ when they were crucified him now many times we look at ourselves and we think and this people is doing me harm or these people is just crucifying me so to speak or these people are doing this and they doing all that kind of stuff to me then we forget what did he go through what did our lord jesus christ what did he experience brother branham says as they were putting the nails in his hands brother branson's yet with a heart full of love he cried father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and he says here i've come to that spot i believe that people don't know what they doing i believe it's only maturity that can say that and that can understand that maybe this person is reacting in a certain way but you understand that maybe there's a reason why father ben told us yesterday i hope it's okay he says um i do i don't eat leftover foods is it true true and i thought my goodness i could not eat leftover fruits but then you put us in perspective as to why he doesn't and then i thought brother could ben if i was in your shoes i probably also wouldn't want to eat leftover food because we understand i don't think i mentioned here i had a situation at work where this lady was just men she was pushing down and just man i don't know she was just treating me terrible she would say bad things about me and even pull me up in front of the directors and i couldn't understand because i'm not doing anything wrong and then one day she did something and i wanted to flare up i wanted to react and i said now this is nonsense i'm not gonna take this i'm a christian i'm the son of god but then the lord told me and said this wait yeah don't react respond what i want you to do tess wait 24 hours i wanted to react immediately because i mean i was ready to go the lord said wait 24 hours and i waited as hard as it was i waited 24 hours and i'm glad i did that because then when i could speak to this person i could step that anger and that reaction was gone i could speak human to human and then as i started speaking i understood why the person was reacting the way she was reacting and then i could then readjust the way i did things so that it didn't happen going forward and today we're working fantastically together so brother branham says with a heart full of love he says father forgive them and he says i believe that people don't know what they're doing so when you get faced with people coming up against you feel compassion for them say lord show me why are they going on the way they're going on i think i mean everything is okay it's also lord maybe is this something that i need to do to make right if he shows it to you you know as hard as it is make right you see the spirit of the day it's it's it's it's trying to constitute you yeah it's trying to make you walk you know we were yearning a certain sound but it's trying to make you know all how am i you know is the word really as powerful as they say it is well you know it's the the spirit of the day is trying to break us down it's trying to cause chaos in our lives because you see god has come and said i speak peace to you but the enemy doesn't want you to live in peace so he tries these various things to unsteady you try to break up families break up brotherhood but you see we are weary and we are aware of his devices i use that terminology in church ages we are able to discern and to withstand and we say lord give me discernment lord so that i can understand things and then give me wisdom on how to do what i need to do and we know that receiving the baptism of the holy ghost is of vital importance because with the baptism of the holy ghost where the brain says you will bear the fruit of the spirit and you will find yourself in love with your enemies that is a characteristic of the elect lady we conduct ourselves according to the word he says when you really find yourself talking about your enemy that you love him regardless of what they do you still love them he says if you do get stirred up and i think i mentioned this on wednesday go and pray first before you talk to him oh by the end he at all i said if you do react and you you know cause whatever you make that fire bigger god as i highlighted to you a situation that i need to look into into myself and you go and you go and pray and say lord help me help me i want to grow brother branham says temper breeds temper you know what it's like we get angry and i get angry and that person gets angry and then it just explodes and escalates so i want to i want to read this because this is the negative right he says temper breeds temp and he says then you grieve the holy spirit away from you he says the holy spirit takes its flight temper breeds temper but then he says but love breeds love so be full of love and us on the outside coming here in and and just experiencing wellington and the believers we are seeing by the ad love just continue to love because as your love projects to daniel daniel's love just projects back to me he says and you've seen people that you just love to be around and as i look at your faces i am seeing a people that we as the jeopardies we just love to be around i had a driver by the met we went somewhere and he was showing me his awesome stuff and there were times it was just quiet in the car but man i just loved sitting in the car brother matt i just loved just being with him sitting with the brothers sometimes my wife actually asked me yesterday so you know did you guys talk a lot i said no there were just times we were just sitting you know just sitting there but i like that that's it you know it's just i love being around you you're just fine for the po i looked at that photo that you took of us standing like that i just love being around you and i hope that you love being around the jeffers because we just love you you've seen people that you just love to be around they create that atmosphere he says they create that atmosphere not just by singing in churches raising their hands they create that atmosphere by the life that they love the life that you live not just in church but at home at work walking down the street the life that you love creates an atmosphere the way that they talk a friend of mine in london christian colombia i think you would have known who he is he wrote a song that says my language has changed and that is what this word has done to me my language has changed i speak peace i speak victory because i am eating the book so the way they their conversation and even it was just no conversation just sitting there because you know i know that as we're sitting there we're thinking about him we're thinking of good things creates the atmosphere so for the being yesterday we sat at the table and you sat there and i sat here and by the edge was making coffee and it was so quiet i just loved it because i was sitting in an atmosphere i was sitting with believers and i know love the same god who i love all of our loves who my children loves so i love being around you and i think cleveland we need to visit them more but then at the same time i love in cambridge i can count on my fingers how many people has been to my house we just love you he says here talking about creating the atmosphere and the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates the atmosphere so it's important think on him yeah situations problems trials it's gonna be there but instead of looking at the problem and saying oh this is so hard look at the word yes i i always i like to say this i always say you know we see the problem there yeah the problem is there but let's just look above and brother let's look at the promises of god and let's think about the promises of god let's focus on the promises of god because then we're creating an atmosphere and then that problem looks so small because we're living under a heavenly atmosphere we're living under an atmosphere that tells me all things are possible i'm living under an atmosphere that tells me there is nothing my god is greater my god is stronger lord you are higher than any other [Music] you see you reflect the light this word is being manifested in you and our brother branham says this is the light of the hour he says the word the manifested word of god so when you're walking around at school at school if you go to school or at work or at uni you bears of the light and if the word says shalom if the word says peace you receive it so today we know that gross darkness is upon the people but brother branham says yeah we are there's darkness and there's you god has allotted his word to be manifested this day it's the only light we have and god is going to let somebody manifest that word and i believe with all my heart as i'm looking at you today you are that somebody that's reflecting this word you might think i'm not but go and speak to the sin out there amen and just listen to their testimony about you listen to their testimony about you there was gideon or somebody regarded to let gideon go and listen into a dream that somebody had that spoke about it was gideon and he swore that they've given the courage amen so don't allow the devil to tell you that you are just a normal christian and just going through the motions you are the cold you are elected by him to the elected precious and cold saints of god i say to you this coming year for 2022 i say shalom god's peace over you finish off shortly the lord just laid on my heart to speak this to you and i'm speaking to myself finishing off shortly i've just got one page he talking about jesus christ he is the word and the church becomes the word and then brother branham makes the statement he says you are personally identified by him sister naomi as you're sitting here you're in church and you you know you come from canada but he has personally identified you as a daughter of the king you are his property alone amen god invisible union of the bride god is calling to the elected and brother branham says and they know it as you sit here you know that is calling as his word is coming forth you know he's telling you tess come up higher there's you've been maybe around this mountain long enough it's time to turn tess it's time to take that next step maybe you've been struggling with this thing or struggling with that guilt tears it's time to let go tears it's time just to take it and give it over to me tears i'll show you how to handle it if you need to go and handle it with that person or that person or that person give it to me tears because you're growing i want you to come up higher i want you so he's calling you and we know it he's calling the virtuous bride and that's who you are the word the last day church the elected lady that's who you are he the bridegroom he took away your shame amen if you're sitting here this morning and you have a feeling of shame you know you've done things we've all done things i had to actually talk to a family member of mine in south africa she's she's done such a lot wrong and i had to encourage her and i had to tell you know what you got to be honest with him and he will take that shame away the brandon says he took away your shame amen and he put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word so as we receive the word we allow the word to come and just to wash us and that's why sometimes when we're sitting in church and we and we hear certain things that's being said and we feel a brick in our hearts or we feel is i need to make this right i don't want it anymore it's him speaking it's him saying just come up higher that's where i want you to be it's him coming and he's washing you and then i want you to walk away with this you are standing completely justified as though you never did it in the beginning but obviously we do know that there's requirements that goes with that so i've done wrong he made a way of escape i gotta go to him and say lord forgive me i repent of my wrong he says you're you're standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now and then he says talk about a thanksgiving amen you are the pure virtuous i want you to take this you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned at the first place yeah a memory says i did that and i did that and the devil will remind me you did that and did that but as long as we make right the wrong he doesn't see it anymore the musicians can come i'll finish off with one last quote and however the lord leads you to play whatever song you go for it invisible union of the bride brother branham says you the elect lady you are his purchased possession amen you are the bride of jesus christ he says you are standing completely you never sinned at the first place god don't even know you never did it you were accused by the accuser but you see the accuser doesn't realize that within me there is something that when i do the wrong i make the mistake i sign for the rattlesnakes i stumble i fall there is something within me that just wants me to get up and to push forward amen and to make right and repent you know so many times we always think you know i've i've done my brother wrong so i'm gonna repent but i'm gonna repent to god and say lord you forgive me but many times we also have to go to the brother or go to the sister and say brother or sister i am sorry i wronged you forgive me and do we go to god and say lord help me you were accused of it by the accuser but from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god you are standing you are sitting here you are sitting here washed it's nice to be washed you come [Music] that's what he does that's what he's doing you say you're standing here washed and i'll repeat this part again where he says you are the virtuous bride of christ you are washed in the blood of christ you are precious [Music] he says precious virtuous sinless son of god standing with a pure unadulterated bright word that he washed [Music] so this morning i say to you to the elect lady don't forget that you are elected you are special you are unique you are yes and if there are things you know life you need to make right just make it i think i might have read on wednesday is just overcome that thing a few times and see how your testimony blows and blossoms because of it let us pray [Music] loving father we stand in your presence this morning but the brandon taught us lord god that we create an atmosphere by think things here we are this afternoon lord the music is play we are in an atmosphere an atmosphere father that makes us so aware of the presence of god i am thankful to know this morning lord you've called us you've appointed us you've anointed us calling us pride you're calling us virtuous [Music] and
