know in the atmosphere oh my we're blessed me hallelujah you just think these things are only in the infancy in Vietnam and so you can imagine it's not like it is here and yet there is a glory in a different angle a different way because it's a beginning of a work amen and the Lord is the Lord is moving in Vietnam amen and I just want to thank you all for being a part of this amen because we're all a part of it together and I want to thank brother Isaac taking the strain of the company and holding the fort amen and so yeah I'm very grateful because it's not easy a man like I have to say to the Brethren let's just watch can you see it all right we've got some toilet paper here that's just toilet paper money that's worth about two cents is enough to get you a drink of water brother you decided that he would utilize this resource and who tight brother age is gearing up for a fiery study so this church was the first place we went to brother Kwan [Music] [Music] [Music] well I think it's quite [Music] so that we went to another church and dom lasses a Baptist denomination and this is the first time they ever heard the message so we had one service and I got him brother Adrian got me to ministered here and share my testimony was received quite well [Music] God's love is so great he will reach [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he said this church this is the most of the church there quite a small Church in the middle just above Saigon down the south of Vietnam very nice people first time that ever heard anything more than Baptists theology so they were quiet they were quite blown away actually and they invited us back so yeah pray for these fellows I can't remember the guys name but he's actually from Indonesia the pastor there but they're quite open and so yeah just thank the Lord for that opportunity it was just that came up the guy in the midle beer with the white suit their brother Duong this brother here he he'd got us into there that's my translator fook and this was the pastor vir it's hard to see everybody but um yeah that was it went quite well and they felt connected to that with the whole thought was to connect this minister to the apostolic ministry and ye+ to get invited back you know so the Lord really undertook it was quite amazing it's hard to tell when you're not there but the atmosphere is different because they are not used to that type of preaching and they are used to a lecture you know they're used to a fable they're used to just you know laying out facts and putting things together and how good you should live and what sort of stuff so when they heard this it was all new for them but it was done in a simple way that they could they could understand it and that Minister could go man there's something more in the Bible you know amen as they're gonna continue on rifice top that by okay you can so now this is brother Adrian here we went to church and we spent three days with these guys [Music] [Music] brother Adrian was quiet he didn't really like having all these people sitting on his bed the Lord knows how to deal in our lives I didn't really mind I was quite funny actually but now we had a really good time of these with three days about six meetings a day with these guys as David Fuchs Church and there they to place the Ministry of Elijah in Scripture and to see themselves in the scripture now we're riding out to the mountains we've now traveled up tune our trend which is about 8 10 hours north of Saigon and we're going up into the absolute remotest places in Vietnam up into the mountains it costs too much to get a Texan 45 degrees Bobo's too this is the only church fully established and like getting established in the message now in Vietnam so we had a wonderful time this is ministers two days of ministers needs and in a day of the whole church it's the pastor brother Bobo very powerful atmosphere was in these places really [Music] so these guys are just coming into the third pool now just just like just walk again it's quite amazing they're having an awakening this brother here while while he was hearing the word he had a transformation in the Lord showed him that he was a caterpillar and he turned into a butterfly to fall like new birthright on the service his name as brother Jean but there was others as well but we didn't get to this was the only one he was one of the ministers that was there for the three days all the heaps of things happened in the service while we were preaching quite quite an outpouring of the Spirit actually happened in the service for all of the congregation as well and they are seeps of questions and things just the Lord really moved that was like their season now to come up another higher another level and come come right into the message right into the fullness of the word and come into that bedroom relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ you know their intimacy was into the third Paul the tenth so yeah you can carry on now yes he testified he just had an absolute amazing awakening right in the service real nice brother [Music] [Music] [Music] there are many people trying to be Christians [Music] [Music] [Music] here's a great outpouring of the Spirit the whole church just raised up and was screaming out to God they just they were calling for the fullness of God in the new birth many things happened in that place very lovely people very simple people we've never been able to but that's the first time they've actually heard third pole preaching so it's always been very elementary just you know the fundamental foundations but finally they had actually grew into the position where they could hear the word now we're in Quan Chi 12 hours a normal of not ring this is a group of ministers like our fellowship the ministers and that's David he's blind he's our translator these guys hear a lot of stuff went down in Quang I that I got you guys to pray about and now the whole church they were too scared to tell us that they were they were already baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but the Lord ordered that so that because I sensed and was directed that fear was on them so I was preaching against fear and separating from the Babylonian spirit and coming into under the headship of Christ and they got very strong evangelism basically and the church basically they were too scared to tell us that they were already baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because they thought our translator David was not baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and if they said anything he was going to tell the superiors of the denomination in the area and so they were too scared to confess so it was fear that they didn't want to lose their job you know so yeah what happened was we just felt led of the Spirit to say an issue want to get baptized three baptized don't come to the next service don't come back and this you want to be baptized because we had been there for so long their years and trying to they're not telling us that they've already been baptized and they just don't want to take that step it was like what are we doing they don't want to get baptized they've heard all those preaching and Skype studies and everything they're not taking that step but I always knew that it was fear fear was holding them back as I was preaching a preaching case fear and brother Adrian was preaching about you know the event just pure evangelism around the same thoughts and they have what heaven was because they ultimatum pushed them into a corner and they loved the word they loved studying with us they love hearing it there but there was what they got squeezed into a corner and then one of the guys gave me a message he says we do believe baptism in Jesus name and I was like what does this mean why are they saying so I text another brother in the area choir and he he I see there's this like a cello fellowship are they baptized in the name of Jesus cry and he sent me a picture of them all being baptized and about three or to two or three years ago or something and and and and so David the translator rings the muffin says are you already baptized what's going on a seesaw yeah we were because you know I was baptized Oh what so you were baptized too but they said we didn't want to say anything because we thought you were would tell on us you know so the Lord removed that spirit of fear and opened up the channel now and now they want their half of their church rebaptised because there's only half of the church got baptized rebaptised now they want the other half done when we go back there and we've got two weeks of meetings of another Bible school there to go through in time prophecy and David's church the blind brother that translates for us he there's a move happening in his church too and they're they're wanting to start Skype studies and wanting because they didn't they weren't really interested and now they are and they starting to do tape meetings with the message and things like that as well to bring them up because there just hasn't been any movement so quo and I as these things happening there now which we actually went in there we thought we were going to leave and not come back you know like it's just not happening there and something's blocked there or whatever we've been pray for it but then all of a sudden right at the end because of these turns of events and the Lord moving in a certain way it opened up vision and all of a sudden everything opened there it was like a demon lift that was holding them all down and a sphere and it just lifted off them and then there was actual dialogue and you could talk to them and they weren't scared it was amazing so yeah and then at the end of our trip we went up to Hanoi and we met sister cherry who's our translator and this was the most random you wouldn't believe scenario that we can't put into here this guy here he invited us for meetings because has has his second wife he's got two living wives and he's married to both of them his second wife she's a Christian and his first wife as a Muslim and so he we're at his Buddhist wife's place and hid but we met him down in Saigon with his Christian wife and that we had served with Malaysians had many services there and and and he would always just kind of sit around at the back so he was there and he come he we have we carry their waste think we're gonna have meetings he's going to invite people and whatever I don't know what's gonna happen but then we set the air we him and we just sit down and we and and we find out that he's got two wives and he's smoking like a bong the Lord just puts you in these random situations you like what do you do you can't just preach to these fellows you know because they're not even ready to hear what are you gonna say so we're like oh man we can't even start we were going we're gonna have to go before Genesis you know right to the beginning of everything and start from the beginning so we we we brother Adrian started just speaking to him and then it came to came out that he's not actually ready to become a Christian you know it's not really he likes Christianity listens to sermons and things like that and he reads the Bible sometimes but he's not really to give us heart completely to the Lord and that's basically where the preaching boredom so we thought what what are we doing here and then his first wife she grabs a chicken and it's squawking and whatever she just bashes it on the head cuts its head off and pulls all the feathers out starts making us lunch you know just dices the whole thing up you know the whole bird throws it in the soup but the Lord kind of impressed on us you know just let him do it let him bless the bride let him bless her let him bless you and so we had they made us a feast and we had lunch and then we just said was the later and so yeah but then we spent we had a very powerful time in henan we actually we been a lot of had a bit of fellowship was just the cherry and it was a nice time and then brother agent and myself we spent a lot of time and in fellowship and in the presence of the Lord and some amazing things have opened up in the word and also it's just that that's that's an experience it's a circumstance that you you just never really get into you know like to be caught up in such an atmosphere without any distractions where anything it was like it was just ordered of the Lord to come into the place and of you know being completely separated unto the Lord on the backside of the desert you could say which was in the middle of Hannah we in this lake here it's like this is the central center of Hanoi Isaac would love the city center it's the perfect city center it's got it's got about a four column at a walk right around this lake and then on the other side of that is just all the shops right around it and they had this big festival here oh my goodness that was yeah just absolutely crazy but this whole place was just full of people riding around this lake just walking around so we'd walk around the lake and then one guy started talking to us so I shared the gospel with him and he was pretty interested so I just told him what to do and and if the Lord you know oh you can just stop that now just lifted in the Lord's hands really open I've got his number but I must have taken it down wrong so yeah I can't even remember the guys name and then another person came up we made a few people and started witnessing for different people and just made ourselves available for the Lord so yeah that's that the Lord's done many things lots of lives would change things were established we've got more invites and the vision open in a few more places as well so you praise the Lord amen amen you can put that a secret of worship I want to speak on the secret of worship today you know the husbandman must be first partaker of the fruits and so I believe the Lord allowed me to experience this and such a way to partake of the fruit that I'm about to speak to you about and I just trust the Lord will lead us and he will inspire us amen hallelujah so if you could stand with me please and we shall read the word amen amen John 4:23 and 24 hmm it says but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship God is a spirit and they that worship Him must with emphasis and underline italics and bold must it's triple emphasis worship Him in spirit and in truth and then let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus father this is your word you have a certain desire for your bride and the service and I yield myself to you Father I pray that you would take control of every spirit all the human spirits and any other contrary spirit that would try and thwart this meeting and Lord just let the service live human control I I yield myself to you Father and I ask that you would just have your way in the service Lord I pray that you would get all the glory and all the honor of anything that has accomplished and service for it's all for your glory it's all by your grace it's all your power your mercy your grace and your compassion and Lord your grace Lord Oh father you're just so worthy of our praise and Lord Jesus I pray that you just have your way in the service I pray Lord

service and lord I pray that you would anoint speaker and hearer and I pray Lord that we would be caught up into the vision Lord Jesus that you have ordained for this moment for this hour that Lord we would not leave the service the same lord I will not leave the service the same the Lord I will be deported from one condition into another condition Oh Lord Lord my thoughts are going to be higher when I walk out of the service Lord Jesus Oh father I pray that there would be a synchronization between the expression and eternity and the reaction in the flesh I pray that they would we would be caught up into a synchronization I pray that your grace father would Lord bring forth the thought and that Lord you would come underneath the very spirits and man Oh Lord Jesus and father that Lord

hearts this morning lord and receive from the Lord or father my heart is open I just need you to deal with me lord I want to grow in your grace Lord and be aligned to my theophany Lord Jesus to be

way in the service take control of each one of us lower yields ourselves to you now and Jesus Christ's name bless your word amen amen I want to speak on the secret of worship part 1 so I don't know how far we'll get is there a clock somewhere mate this is not okay I thought there was a clock in here somewhere there was a clock out the array Oh mate we're going out of time into eternity then [Laughter] yeah amen but the hour cometh and now is when remember he now is right there but remember the church kind of went away and did its thing and the devil came in and he tried to take over everything and tried to starve out the truth try to get rid of all of those things but then God said I will restore so let me declare to you that the hour that he's speaking of now is again amen that's been restored we are right here right in the same thing right again amen and God is here lives are going to be changed this morning amen hello you just let him deal with you let him have his way Hey just open your heart open the aperture right up you know when you eyes go into the dark they adjust and the pupils go right open you know and they take in as much light as possible because there's not much light well there's a lot of light in this place right now and I want your heart to do what your pupils do amen and open right up and let the Lord deal amen don't reason don't dodge just receive Amen hallelujah because the Lord can work the Lord can deal to align us to align us because we think we're something no I don't mean about pride or anything we think we're a certain thing and we're we're thus invest and whatever and we behave that way and we live that way and we act that way and react that way and everything seems to be that way but it's not really who you really are amen you are an eternal being that was never beginning and it's that you start in the mind of God amen and that being has a certain culture a certain behavior a certain temperament a certain reaction to the word hallelujah because in eternity you reacted in a certain way to the Word of God hallelujah your thoughts were in the complete synchronization with the thoughts of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen because the bride and the bridegroom is the same Prophet declared she is him Amen hallelujah so I believe I'm looking at true worshipers that are on a journey that started in the mind of God and it's being expressed in mortal bodies for the purpose of redemption amen for the purpose to start in a certain condition crushed down by the the laws of man and under the depressions of this world and uncultured in a certain way by all the pressures of society but then God would come down with an open book to start speaking to you who you really are and if you open your heart and let him do he will actually bring you up and you will start to become just like you were before the world even began amen and and really you know we're going to be caught up in the secret of worship when I say the secret of worship this is a place that people we can all enter in the blood paid the way amen the Lord paid it in full there is no reason why we cannot be caught up into the Shekinah glory amen there's a difference now this - there's probably more but I'm going to two things right so one sometimes the glory of God just falls on the surface and everybody's affected amen and then other times there's just a few people that are affected by that glory because they are going into the glory that's been opened for them and the veils been rent and they're going in what others sit there like this and they're wondering why are they what's going on here I'm not feeling like that why is it why am I not feeling like that one person is starting to realign with their eternal image one person realizes they've got access hallelujah they got access and they can get that access anytime they want hallelujah amen and as we grow and as this identity is given as it unfolds to us and we open up and we allow it to affect us we allow the power of the thought to come into our lives the power of that thought to come down and start changing things amen these people start coming up into that place and you know someone might just say Jesus and all of a sudden power of God brings it personally a man like that guy that was you know stomping in the Attic hallelujah I like that story he just read a geography book come on [Applause] hallelujah just a geography book he was so into missus theophany hallelujah just to see how you know come on honestly hallelujah bless man there was nothing between him and her Savior hallelujah there was no cultural limitation no military way hallelu you know so many of us many of us have been been oppressed under military standards being oppressed under military upbringing or most of us because most of our parents were drafted for the wars and we've been through those things and they they got a certain leadership mentality impressed upon them and then they just did that to us it's how they did it to us but that's not like they're in the kingdom of God that military way that stalwart way is not the way of the kingdom of God when it comes to worship when it comes to connecting with our eternal nature hallelujah no we're under a restoration and so we're all in a different place we've all got different personalities we've all got different cultural inhibitions limitations and expressions and benefits the right word we'll just use benefits but the officer to limitation freedoms amen and some of them are good and some of them are not good but remember us we all come from an eternal culture we all come from a divine expression hallelujah the Lord took the bride out of the bridegroom on the cross because he wanted a lady to react to him he wanted some joy in the service he wanted when his word would be preached there would be joy coming back they would be rejoicing they would be shouting the oldest religion in the world is a shouting religion Amen I'm feeling it all over me it's a shouting religion amen / oh yeah Amen I'm gonna get ahead of myself but all the sons of God not some of them not most of them all the sons of God shouted for joy amen amen you know it and so when you become aligned to that image again you will shout for joy hallelujah it's a shouting message what did the Lord to send down to do he descended with a shout teaming and feet so that was a divine expression he descended with a shout and he's expecting one back he's expecting a appropriate reaction to that shelf hallelujah hallelujah okay let's go amen oh my lord of seeking that he's seeking such worshipers and spirit and enjoy people that have the money in the bank and can write the check amen hallelujah many times people can write the chick got no money or people go here some money and no no ability to write the check but the profits it all if we could only just unite those two forces we could only not unite these two realities we would see some good things going on hallelujah God seek her such to worship Him amen God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth now remember this there is a mandate on the devil the devil's got a word spoken over him that limits him from hurting the oil in the wine so you've got oil and you've got wine because our God came down in the evening time in the wedding time and he turned the water into wine in your life and he's turning water into wine right now if you open up the aperture if you open it up and allow him he will turn the water that's coming out of this mouth into one and I'm not just talking about some cheap wine from the bottom shelf hallelujah I'm talking about the best wine hallelujah now that wine is what's going to get you shouting me men their wines going to change your behavior that one's going to change your outlook and life then one's gonna change the way you speak you're gonna speak the truth hallelujah amen you stop behaving yourself unseemly or self style disappears all of those things then haven't you all gone hellooo you hurt not the oil and wine Satan that's what he says hurt not the oil and the wine amen because my Brides gonna come back to her image she's going to express she's going to react appropriately to the expression she's going to be in perfect harmony oh my and she's on her Road amen we're all gone that road and we may resist we may think no that's not me I'm this we may think no I've never done that so I'm never gonna do it but God has got a different idea hallelujah amen and there's a power in this room to raise you out oh yeah you know one day I'm going to the end of the sermon now one day someone's going to preach your rapture hallelujah hallelujah one day that words gonna become flesh hallelujah amen are you gonna start walking like Enoch came in when the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart I will walk like Enoch whoa hallelujah amen someone's gonna preach then unless you're gonna react in the same way it was preached you will react and the same spirit the same calibre hallelujah the same caliber of the expression of the rapture because the rapture comes from the thoughts of God the rapture comes from the mind of God and eternal reality and he in his mind when he thought of the rapture he was thinking of you because you are the rapture amen but he's just waiting waiting for people to get out of themselves to go beyond the camp of their own and inhibitions to go beyond the camp of what they think they are and start looking into the third call start going into the tenth version start spending time in the Shekinah hallelujah and let him lead hallelujah amen because that wraps are going to be preached and then is going to be a reaction brother Branham says fundamental doesn't mean too much it's the revelation of God amen it's a powerful quote it's very short but I thought well it was a lot more around it but I thought well this is just what I wanted to share their fundamental does not mean too much it's the revelation of God you can't do it on a halfway profession you can't do it on a knitted mind how many missing minds are in this message how many message theologians assessing in this message with all the knowledge knowing all the mysteries but have not loved they have not its supernatural element there are unable because they're held down by their old nature they're held down from entering that Shekinah because the moment you in today Shekinah and I don't mean just once because that's not enough it is enough to get you saved and you might go to heaven but you have a miserable life down here a man because you live under your privilege because you're privileged you're privileged to live in that place yes you come down and do work and you do things like that but you can go back into this place you can stay in this place you can live in this place you can speak from this place you can enjoy this place hallelujah and it'll get so much one of these days that it will not be hidden inside you hallelujah you can't hide it that much longer Amen hallelujah every stone will be unturned amen and if you keep crying out if you keep holding back the cry holding back the shout holding back the rejoicing the rocks will cry out for you what a shame what a shame that you will let the Rock's crier oh my when the ark cometh to Jerusalem amen if we get into it today praise the Lord might be part to her you cannot do it on a knitted mind it's impossible conceive all the things there be a good message believer oh my perfect here perfect dress perfect everything on the outside certain tie the whole lot but just a knitted mine the Lord has provided one way of worship hallelujah God's provided way of worship and the interne hallelujah and not just the end time but every time is one way for the believer where they come to put their hand on the sacrifice amen which is the name where he puts his name there's a gate that God places his name and his name is not a stationary thing his name is more than a title his name is more than what we can imagine Oh hallelujah we call him the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah and that Jesus Christ is a God that expresses himself there's a God that does things that goes places there has specific plans for specific pages for specific generations and he manifests his name as he fulfills his word he manifests his name where he fulfills his word and mirrors of people they are elected to see it and they take that gate and it puts them right through time back onto the sacrifice and they feel the life go out of him hallelujah and they realize this for them oh my the prophets you've entered he says you've got to do it on a pillar an adulterated faith by the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah you've gone beyond the camp of time you've gone beyond the natural way oh ma if you have gone beyond the natural way of this experience you can go beyond the next way hallelujah don't limit your oh my you can live above what you're living amen this is the season Saints this is your season your season to shine young people believe open your hearts give it all to him oh my don't worry about what mama thinks what daddy thinks don't worry about what friends think Oh am i is a far greater friend a far greater comfort a far greater jolly a far greater everything oh my I can't even describe it too much for the human on the English language anyway doesn't work amen so you're interred up there and you know you've touched God by the hand and you're his servant you're not afraid of nothing then perfect love manifested in your life driving out fear showing you who you are sealing your room so that no devil seed can come down into your life and start altering things because there is a reality hallelujah don't dodge the bullets don't dodge them whoever you may be let the Lord's power of his word open up react react appropriately every RIA every expression every divine expression has an appropriate reaction you can write that one down I'll send you the invoice every divine expression has an appropriate reaction the level of your reaction to that divine expression depends on your spiritual condition that's right amen and it will get so strong that gravity will not hold you on that seat when you get caught up in the power of their thoughts where it becomes reality hallelujah no gravity's gonna hold you down Amen no graves gonna hold you in the tomb hallelujah cuz there's a resurrection life that causes you to jump hallelujah it'll get so strong you'll be like Jeremiah's burning in my bones Lord hallelujah because the divine expression is coming forth and it's expressing to you oh my and it gives so much when your thoughts come into that caliber with your thoughts go beyond reasoning when you receive this word straight into the heart oh my you're not afraid of nothing being a man because you've been sealed we've come in by the new and living way home and not a new and religious way not a new and boring way Amen but a new and living way hallelujah oh my there's a change in dispensation Saints hello Mary just you know she went to determine she thought she was going to see the mercy seat between the cherubim still like the Old Testament but she turned around and she saw a person she saw the mercy seat standing in front of because the mercy seat is not a shadow anymore hallelujah oh my the person amen let me just teach this some hindrances to the secret of worship you none of us none of us can dodge this not even me none of us we're all in this together we all have this flesh and we all have come up under some sort of a restricting culture but I just I I just encourage forget the culture forget what other people think and what you think other people think and don't behave because other people behave a certain way you live before an audience of life where these are some of the hindrances it's probably lots more but we're or what our affections are acclimatized and the Bible says set your affections on things above yeah and then because your I did and your life is hid with Christ in well not on things that the earth is the purpose for that we nice you might need to go do things but it might not be going through your affections channel what you let into your affections channel entertainment games all those things as soon as you have an element of joy on something that is not of God you're leading that spirit right and just like when you are sitting here and you've got joy right now anyone that's got joy right now because of the word is getting the power of that word and one day those inhibitions that are holding you on your seat and making you quiet will be broken hallelujah Amen when this whole church is shouting every person they'll be back in the image of what it was an eternity when the victory is preached now there may be some sadness preached there may be some conviction Proops I don't think they'll be shouting because it's not appropriate that's why the balance is there there's a balance you know I think there are probably you know there are some churches that are very very exuberant and no matter what the preacher says they're just up in there shouting and doing their thing even if it's they're getting preached at and they're getting convicted and whatever it's just the mentality or a culture or whatever but there's an appropriate reaction to every divine exception and the level of your reaction depends on your spiritual condition honestly because the thought is more powerful than your old culture the thought is of Gardner before of God is more powerful anything you can hold back knows nothing can hold back amen no Roman power no Romans seals no stones in front of tombs no grave clothes of Lazarus no nothing hold back our power when the resurrection comes forth oh ma Oh hallelujah did you know that you house oh oh oh oh lord help me be careful you may be sitting here going I don't know what this is all about I understand this preaching and it's good but where are your affections what have you enjoyed lately what entertainment has gone into your spirit and soiled what entertainment what are you attuned to you know when you turn the receiver and you tune into something you know we've got a receiver in here the wise virgin has a receptacle Oh hallelujah the foolish version doesn't have the receptacle but the wires version has a receptacle to receive oil a man to receive oil now that don't tune to these other things and affections and all those others you know hey maybe you're not gonna get in trouble for it but you will have trouble for because reason we live as - you know let's just generalize it into a very general statement as there is a divine expression it's the Word of God and it's come out in these prophecies around all of us don't spread your resource of affections you know it's a resource that God's given you it's a channel in your spirit where you can enjoy things now if you might have you let's say you spread it out too much and there are things that we need to spread it out on like our children family there are good things and I'm not saying that you shouldn't do those things they're very very important but we don't want to Mar our relationship the Lord Mar that image and it can be mad and clouded over all sorts of things many things in this world is critically designed to fill it very easily and the human nature will just very quickly oh my help me Jesus oh the gravitates you know you just become acclimatized when you get acclimatized to passive entertainment instant gratification instantly pleasure by all of these stimulations of the world when you come to church your affections are so-so you spend most of the service and sometimes by the end of the service you start feeling good sometimes it's you come into church and you're so full of all these worries and Leary's and natural thinking and Oh fears and all these things and the worship service starts to move and to clear those things but you're not attuned to above because there is an expression happening an eternity there is a divine expression it's like a broadcast or casting all over this place Amen if you are spiritually fit your affections are tuned in to that broadcast and when the word goes forth your reaction comes up and as United and theophany United and re in eternity and even if the glory doesn't all fall down in the service and everyone's affect your Amen Helen oh yeah because you came by the blood you have exits the veils torn the bales raped amen it's not Satan that holds us back from a pure reaction to the word it's us old nature it's I'm gonna talk about David soon when he saw the art coming Beck and McHale and how Macau is like his old nature you know our old nature and she was looking through the window and seeing her husband shamelessly uncovering his eternal image hallelujah shamelessly he didn't care what other people thought he got caught up in the vision he got caught up in the unfailing realities and the significance of this message became so real to him oh my he couldn't stand still he got so caught up in the spirit the prophets in his arms were moving in every direction oh my us all those things happen at the conviction hallelujah I saw those things happening already Amen there was a knock coming to New Zealand hallelujah Amen the ark was coming to Jerusalem amen this Jerusalem hallelujah there was a knock coming as somebody got excited somebody realized how important it is oh my there was nothing could hold them back there were people dancing they probably never does their life because McCall got to fear hallelujah I saw Bros dancing like in I said they've never danced before near life because they were just letting it loose and I rejoiced hallelujah there wasn't there was no style there was no smooth moves it was just loose in every direction oh my goodness there's what happens when the significance of the vision becomes reality oh I bet power pulls people right out of themselves that power of the Bob will pull you out of this dimension one day and God is conditioning you to get over your makar oh my let me read that we're uh here it is I'm just gonna read these and then get on to the scripture so says I D revolution your identification is under a revolution there's the revolt happening in your and it's pulling you out of your old nature pulling you out of yourself so you're in a strait betwixt two your natural heritage and your eternal heritage even after the new birth don't think when I cuz I got the new birth this is how I am and I'm gonna be like that an eternity don't kid yourself it's not how you are you're on a journey hey man hey man hallelujah selfish motives answer in the hearts that will inhibit your experience that will inhibit if there's anybody on here in here there has an answer in DeHart something in their life that they haven't given over you are robbing yourself blind you're robbing yourself more than you could ever imagine oh my you know you I'm having a good time I'm having a really good time right now now the Lord showed me one day cuz I love having a good time I love it and I and Bin's having an absolute glory over time up here and I'm going man I wish I was having a good time like that and the Lord just spoke and I don't even know when it was maybe it was after the service or at the service you can have just a good of time you can enjoy the service just like the preacher hallelujah because the preacher is under the same inspiration the same voice of the Resurrection that is inside you the same so just let loose and meet God let go of all of the self styles all the naturals thinking all of the old ways and let the expression fully effective Amen hallelujah you have guys you'll be up here come on hallelujah it was people bashing the stage on him like they were getting caught up men oh my it was some real things going on hallelujah approaching God through a mirage of past revivals and I'll help in a minute you understand what I mean by that approaching gods through a mirage of past revivals remember the gate as his name right the way you enter into fellowship the way you put your hand on the head of the Lamb is through the unfolding it's through the interpretation of Scripture we sing the song God interprets his word by bringing it to pass when it comes to pass that is the person doing it that hung on the cross if you want to be friends if you want the cross to affect your life you've got to come his providing way you've got to come through the gate that he puts his naming and that gate is the fulfillment of scripture for your day and if you approach God and the repenter costal gate under a charismatic gate under a Baptist gate under any denominational gate you'll just have your own faith and your own anointings and your own miracles and your own world and that you imagine God to show you and you're not ripped your worship is not truly accepted because you're just a historian and the cross is just history but if you come through the gate that he places his name where he's fulfilling his word you will transcend and deport yourself out of this realm into an eternal realm where it becomes a reality and the very sacrifice becomes real to you and you're born again and now your worship can be expressed amen oh my that's acceptable with worshiping by education or knowledge read these I promise our reactions should be appropriate to the expression preached or taught okay because otherwise you know people might think oh you've got a shot every time the preacher sees that's not like it's the thought that's being preached and the union the like-mindedness be of the same mind let this mind be in you did you know set your affection and let this mind is the same word it's the same word these two scriptures they set your affection on things above and not on these earthly things and let this mind be in you has the same word Amen let it be in you now there's another mind in you and her name is McCall that's your old cultural and Habashi we'll talk about that in a minute if we've got time let me see okay we should notice an increase in our development of reaction to match our eternal theophany we should notice that the way you reacted one year ago should be different to the way you react now and then you believe that the way that you approached God the the the experience the maturity of your reaction should be different than what it was a year ago if it's not you're leading McCall rule your life you're leading your cultural and her bitching all of these things take to you and it becomes an idol because it gets between you and God imagine if David did dead and said David as a man after my own heart oh and he's looking now the father seeketh such there's a bride that when she hears that word when she hears that preaching when she has the expression and it's so great it's so great that it was exactly what he's seeking that says for you I did and your lives are hid with Christ in God that means that McCall has deep she's fruitless you know brother Branham he had this experience and he said that after he let go of them a call and he let himself loose he said I had great victory after victory oh my that's profound me that is absolutely profound and you wonder why you sit there struggling struggling and yet you believe the word you struggle cuz you're not letting go because you're not on the Kim the old way and leading that's it the Prophet said he said you know someone cannot sit I'm so selfish I've prayed I've kept the devil's and he said it don't do that see through the opposite go and be extremely and selfish and it will re did your mentality amen sometimes you've just got to do the opposite of what my call is trying to tell you not to do hello yeah and you will find yourself doing things that you thought you would never do because you get excited about your God's Word didn't he redeem you didn't he save you hallelujah didn't he send a prophet and call you out of Egypt on eagle's wings hallelujah didn't he take you through the world Earnest hallelujah didn't he bring you into the Turin River hallelujah didn't has architec you across didn't has Captain come down with a sword for you to take you give you your inheritance give me everything back to you now are you just gonna sit there and say ya know you're going to rejoicing give him what he wants oh yeah go c'mon he wants he's seeking you he doesn't want your McCall it's fruitless she got no babies she got no children no life but David got life God look down a city's a man of the viral Harvey this is the one I love this one he's not ashamed of of being rhetorical Hurley it's not ashamed of what he thinks or what Nicole looks through the windows this is like you've been so you never did this before the people never did that before why why didn't they do it before because God is restoring back the image the church is coming huh the church is coming up hallelujah McCall is losing the battle hallelujah God didn't let the devil win amen oh my hallelujah Oh a supernatural experience should become greater time and our ability to enter the secret of worship easy I'm telling you now we're just laying a looks like the whole sermon is the foundation but that's alright I was gonna just speak these things and then actually preach you know but yeah well the Lord has his own way set your affections on things above not on things of the earth for you I did and your life is hid with Christ in God oh my see that set your affection be of the same mind and let this mind be in you and Deuteronomy 16-5 now this is I'm only laying this as a foundation to show you the way in because that's the foundation it's the basis and if you had and the revelation of Jesus Christ as the baptism of the Holy Spirit and his Spirit has come in the form of a mighty angel with an open book with all of your inheritance all the past ages he had a limited inheritance for the people even the first church the book was still closed he came down but the book was closed amen there was an angel leading them and through the church ages he gave a portion a portion closed book closed book but then finally at the end he says I'm going to search my people right back and they're going to escape them mccall nature because I'm going to do an extract search hallelujah I'm going to send a prophet Elijah with it like a lawyer and he's going to ride in the edge strike search hallelujah and my spirits gonna come and it's going to search them back to the old shouting religion hallelujah it's gonna cinch them back to the service as they had an eternity oh my do you get better you ask me does everyone understand that you are being searched back all your debts are cleared all of your inhibitions are clear or a being cleared his bulldozers going on right now they're bulldozing away you're getting rid of all the trash getting rid of anything that would hold you back because God is preparing you for a rapture you know these things don't just come to a minister for no reason this is a seasons oh my the pillar of fires moving the pillar of fire is moving don't sit still don't be a person that sucks down unless the pillar fire go [Applause] oh ma you move with it hello Louie stay with him this thing's happening going on right now he's preparing you me us why do you think that convention happened an order to break McCall's tradition beer was I was talking to people and they were so shocked that the things we know because that's not how things usually operate and a whole climatic you know hey man even brother Derek Kel stands up at the pulpit he says things are different now things that suffer now that's why a year ago two years ago ever unset in this season didn't say much but now things are changing because God wants you acclimatized attuned to the frequency of his expression because one day that expression will be a rapture and you are gonna garnet you're gonna come out there to it and he's the churning of lorries he's getting rid of the coal so that you can be a turn to the rancher that is being preached to you parallely it's an eternal thought and it's worth it's worthy of Ord with shame ridicule all of that and even when you get so caught up after a while because at first you know those expressions and you just lose your those expressions do you know of course that's the talking's like she starts to tell you things oh look at you you're making a fool of yourself what do you send me look they're all looking at you they think you're just doing it because you went to the convention and now you're gonna calm down but you're not going to calm down cuz your attorney hallelujah you're not only gonna calm down you're connected to the eternal hallelujah glory to his name oh my hallelujah look the Lord chose to place his name in a certain gate and now you'll put your hand on the sacrifice now all of the inheritance the full Holy Ghost has come down on you hallelujah and he's reading you right back to your origins amen oh my David did not care what McCall for she's gonna talk and she's gonna ramble but one day she's gonna leave hallelujah ain't gonna get so she gonna be out of her place hey man hello yeah you let us stay down in the Dead Sea because that's where the Jordan River should have taken her when you crossed over and got the Holy Ghost you meet to die to those things hallelujah but we don't always die to everything we don't everything we understand and we just surrender our whole lives but then as we come under the leadership of the captain that's bringing us back to eternity he takes us on a journey and he starts to bring these things out times are changing this is a change of seasons here is a real change taking place it might not be long States when you least expect that's when oh my we caught up hey man oh look the mayor's not sacrifice to Passover which were than any of my gate which the LORD thy God giveth thee but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose two places named and there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover now just in case there's some critics the Passover was sacrificed once and for all I'm not talking about that we're not resurfacing he's already sick but it's how do we access and because you there's no point and you singing expressing reacting dancing or anything until you've had this until you have personally buy genuine faith and the name of Jesus Christ by the blood of Jesus Christ and you've come through the gate of His perfect will for this day and he opens the gate and Nick she walks for eternity and put your hand that was taken and the power of God or my grants you divine access when ever you what don't have to wait God's given you access yes you wait on the Lord for your ministry you wait on the Lord for many things but he's hungry for you and he doesn't he doesn't hurt holding you back oh the mighty angel and he descended into your land when you crossed over and he put his feet because why she's going down why are those brazen feet are pushing her right down under your feet as he descends down into your life it's my call down there she's calling she's screaming she's telling you don't do it she does not want you to have all your privilege go beyond the camp through the opposite Amen you know when I first became a Christian and the call was going wild so he was telling me many things all the cast referred you look you've always ridiculed Christianity and you've always done listen now you're praying and now you're doing vision it's like don't you look silly and all the sort of stuff and I was it battling with listening but because I was too to certain thought processes and certain frequencies going down a certain line dying in a certain way always that way and you've got to come out of it and there is a power in this room to bring you out of it there's a perilous room to take your McCall nature and do away with it hallelujah you know do you understand what I mean the mighty angel himself because it's personal when you look at the book of Revelation and you see that and you see it kept coming to the prophet and the seventh angel that's dispensational that's the age but anything that happens dispensation needs to happen it needs to be a personal experience in the book of Revelation it's a pleasure showing a dispensational truth a fulfillment but then it has to become personal the same angel that came down with an open book on the sea and upon the earth must come down into you amen man I'm not going to get to the the I'm going to do a part two and I ain't gonna get to the very meat of this but amen maybe this is just the Lord's preparing I just I pray so much Lord how do i you know you prepare and everything and it's like Lord it's just such a burden but it's not my burden it's his burden he's he's got a genius from New Zealand ideas but remember you yes you've given God three minutes but you still make the final decision on whether you D throne McCall whether you and remember whose daughter she is saw you've already thrown Saul I hope man if you haven't the thrown soil man you're in trouble those are just blatant inferiority complexes going on that are restricting your experience this she still hold on it's spirit you with me you understand he runs clear but if we walk in the harem Doucet ruses name and beard thou shalt sacrifice the Passover and even is always an evening sacrifice identify as us at the end time as well at the going down of the Sun at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt so if you haven't come this provided way you're still in Egypt no matter how much you go to church worship God and go all through and have an amazing worldwide musical experience and worship like Lucifer oh so good at worship here's the act was the Archangel of wish oh my those churches are under a big anointing alright but it's not the anointing of God my it's not the skill it doesn't have the ring it doesn't have the same except what Cain Cain's sacrifice in his worship probably looked a lot nicer than Abel's Abel's was so fundamental doesn't mean too much yes it's important but not too much it's the revelation he reveals himself in the form that he is manifesting in his page that's how he reveals himself and when you come in communion with him through that gate through that channel all of Calvary and everything he's ever done and all the promises that are in the book of Revelation hallelujah aren't you glad he raised up a light of a prophet and to walk you through the book of Revelation did you know that angel that prophet that led John through many of those pages was William Branham did you know that you know their day that was brother Branham hi oh my do you realize what this message really is um only the elect will see and you will suffer persecution for it especially yes you know Mary she received an Angels message to a mighty angel Gabriel descended down any preached I believe it I don't understand it all but God will interpret his work by bringing it to pass they man he says our beer done to me according to your word and that message hurry action oh my hallelujah and it wasn't wine react just have an awesome experience somewhere in private oh my hurry action became a public affair her reaction became apparent and every service hallelujah everyone saw what was going on inside her and she suffered she was ridiculed but the elite sorry and the electracy the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah my mind you know she received an angel and you know materialized and it's not a groan she was giving forth bringing for the natural and the ministry was growing the minister is grating the message was growing with him/her and then because the Lamb he needed to be slain for the citizens of the world he came out and he came out and he grew and he grew a ministry became great and now the increase of his government shall be no end hallelujah Amen he had a hearing friend of the bridegroom John the Baptist introduced him and disappeared ministry continued outside of her but yet it was Mary's belief you understand the ministry hey man this is the message this is what happens a mighty angel comes and he sends a prophet a prophet speaks you put your hand on again you come up into an experience and you you're like Mary you say be it unto me according to your word and all of a sudden life comes down but it doesn't need to be physical now so it grows big you know it gets to nine months it gets to full term pregnancy but you ain't needing to give birth to no life because now it's time to grow even further inside you get it you catch that the life but natural I had to come out he continued the ministry but now receive the life you're impregnated by the word and it's pros until finally rose into the full stature of the perfect man inside you when that happens when McCall has forgotten Holly and that happens inside you oh my who's walking the earth fitness hell the second coming heaven it's coming inside the heart of the believer because she's not afraid of nothing she's entered up hallelujah and something into them here and he grew out into the stature of a perfect man hallelujah oh my that's powerful what's happening what's happening right now losing composure here well you see what is he dog he's taking over oh my

of him amen holy though she receive us just as much part of you as a Potter did you know then you realize you're receiving just another part you're part of his family man oh my can I explain that is that so real and he's taking over and all those inhabitants are leaving me shaking Rahab said to the spires she said oh when we heard of all these things everyone was trembling because they knew that their time was coming and you know all of those inhabitants that hold you back most cultural limitations those natural ways of thinking oh all of it that hold you bet is leaving because there is a stature that's pushing them all out hallelujah Rufus didn't start like a white button and it just grew and push out all the frustrations push out all of the bitterness only unforgiveness hallelujah all of the cultural inhibitions everything is pushed out pushed out so you're standing there in the image of Christ a whole creation groaneth and travaileth for the manifestations of the sons of God hallelujah because creation is looking for stability when animals in the Garden of Eden was happy and then God came down into your ruptured the horrible heart what good came first n came down to a nice one how did the nice heart perfect but the second Adam came down into a Richard miss a man start off little inside the land and saw the Jebusites and broke that wall releasing your bride inside you your identity and he starts creating a Garden of Eden inside you and he gets rid of the Amalekites and the highlights and the hair tights and it finally it comes to Jerusalem Amen he's gonna hit them dead boos oh they're not gonna put you over the threshing floor anymore amen hallelujah and all those handicaps that are stuck around the edge of that Jerusalem all the time has come hello the

Jehovah then Jehovah Sakina and Jehovah Sharma and jehova rapha jehova Shaira and all these different names at every time he built an altar and it was a gate that he walked through to worship and he was accepted based on the current revelation of God now that God says in Malachi 3 verse 6 I am God and I change not and then Hebrews 13:8 assist Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever
