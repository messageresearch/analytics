[18:40] actually like
[18:41] you brothers to speak i mean
[18:44] i'm talking about the royal we as in you
[18:46] you know what i mean i mean
[18:47] so a couple of you speak maybe special
[18:50] or a testimony

[18:58] you know so that'd be good amen so we'll
[19:00] put that together
[19:02] um second timothy 1 and 12. but if
[19:04] anyone has you have any questions
[19:06] some other topics you want to go through
[19:07] of course i haven't exhausted everything
[19:09] you know from what i've been talking
[19:10] about but
[19:11] um yeah please let me know so second
[19:14] timothy 1 and 12
[19:17] saying here
[19:19] [Music]
[19:20] for the which cause i also suffer these
[19:23] things
[19:24] nevertheless i am not ashamed for i
[19:26] known whom i have believed and am
[19:28] persuaded
[19:29] that he is able to keep that which i
[19:31] have committed unto him against that day
[19:33] amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer
[19:35] this afternoon gracious lord jesus there
[19:38] is none like you how true that is lord
[19:40] if we could
[19:42] lord if we had a million lifetimes we
[19:43] would never able to find one like you
[19:46] because there's no one
[19:47] that can compare to you or god no i'm
[19:49] not even close and
[19:50] i want to thank you lord in your great
[19:52] mercy you lord came down into time lord
[19:55] to reveal yourself to us
[19:56] and thank you your spirit is still
[19:58] working in the earth lord revealing
[19:59] yourself to whom you will
[20:00] i just want to thank you for that dear
[20:02] god thank you we can walk with you we
[20:03] can know you
[20:04] lord in this hour and i just pray lord
[20:06] as we have the service this afternoon i
[20:07] pray you'll be very real be
[20:09] be very present among us oh god may you
[20:11] grant it lord jesus i want to talk to
[20:13] some
[20:13] talk about something that's very dear to
[20:14] my heart lord in jesus christ's name
[20:17] amen amen god bless you may have your
[20:19] seats this afternoon
[20:21] so i want to talk about uh brother brown
[20:23] makes a statement about
[20:25] uh meeting the lord on the sacred sands
[20:28] because there's in this day we live in
[20:31] there are many opinions and voices and
[20:33] religions
[20:34] and philosophies that are out there that
[20:37] will challenge your faith you know it's
[20:39] not just
[20:39] the devil challenging your faith well
[20:42] you know in terms of
[20:43] about being sick and different things
[20:45] but it's more you know he's going to
[20:47] challenge what you believe
[20:48] and the only way to stand in this day is
[20:51] actually you know the author you know
[20:52] him
[20:53] because if someone can explain you into
[20:55] the message someone can explain you out
[20:58] and you know and just being raised in
[21:00] church is not enough you must know him
[21:02] i know this is not foreign to anyone but
[21:04] it's very vitally
[21:05] essential you know so i want to
[21:08] um brother bam says this i don't know if
[21:11] you can read it but he says
[21:12] unbelief does not hinder god he says in
[21:14] the last days what is going to take to
[21:17] stand
[21:18] as a scriptural trained church on the
[21:21] line
[21:22] for there's going to be carnal
[21:24] impersonations rise
[21:26] even among believers there's going to be
[21:27] cattle impersonations whether we like it
[21:29] or not within every church i'm not
[21:30] pointing even looking at anyone when i
[21:32] say this
[21:33] but these believers make believers and
[21:35] unbelievers in every group
[21:38] um so that's the cardinal impersonation
[21:40] right
[21:41] so can't impersonations rise the bible
[21:43] said as janice and generous withstood
[21:45] moses so will these men of reprobate
[21:47] mind concerning the truth
[21:49] and jesus was the truth thy word is the
[21:51] truth because in the beginning was the
[21:52] word
[21:53] and the word was with god and the word
[21:55] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[21:57] the word of god
[21:58] is more powerful than a two-edged sword
[22:00] cutting to ascend
[22:01] of the bone and discern of the thoughts
[22:02] of the heart we realize
[22:04] that we're in that day to where anything
[22:07] can look so real but
[22:08] yet if it's off the scripture leave it
[22:10] alone no matter what kind of a sensation
[22:12] what results you find out of it if it
[22:14] isn't scripture stay away from it
[22:16] stay with the word he says yeah so he
[22:20] says here that this is the only thing
[22:21] that's going to stand in this day
[22:23] as a scriptural trained church now when
[22:26] i'm going to talk about a scriptural
[22:28] trained church
[22:29] i'm not on on one hand and we'll get
[22:31] into it
[22:34] it's vital that you are trained in the
[22:35] scripture that you know the word
[22:37] in here but to be scripturally trained
[22:40] you need to know how was a
[22:42] church trained originally now on the
[22:45] i don't have a picture of it but on the
[22:46] day of pentecost that's how god trained
[22:48] his church he came and dwelt in the
[22:50] church
[22:51] brotherham talks about an inside teacher
[22:53] and an outside teacher so the inside
[22:55] teacher is the holy ghost in your life
[22:56] he'll teach you the word
[22:57] but then there's the outside teacher the
[22:59] five-fold ministry which teaches you the
[23:01] word as well
[23:02] right but it takes the inside teacher to
[23:03] take that word and bring it into your
[23:05] soul and make it live
[23:07] so that's how the church was originally
[23:09] trained wasn't going through a bunch of
[23:11] theology
[23:12] but meeting the author of the book
[23:14] meeting the lord himself
[23:15] now it's because there'll be people will
[23:18] come along in every part of your life
[23:20] that will challenge you on what you
[23:21] believe
[23:22] you know i had to sit through lectures
[23:23] about evolution
[23:25] at at university i pray you had to
[23:27] endure some as well
[23:28] you know and they weren't teaching it as
[23:30] a theory it was a fact
[23:32] and they were very strong on what they
[23:34] believed and
[23:35] all the professors are very strong it's
[23:36] evolution there's nothing there's no god
[23:38] there's nothing it's just
[23:39] even the comments after class during
[23:41] class you know they were very much
[23:43] this way and so if i didn't know the
[23:46] author
[23:47] their their arguments looks very real
[23:49] looks very plausible it makes sense from
[23:51] their scientific understanding but
[23:53] what i love about this scientific
[23:55] understanding it's only a part of the
[23:56] science
[23:57] because the laws of chemistry actually
[23:59] forbid life ever forming
[24:02] i could go into that another time but
[24:03] the laws of chemistry see where they
[24:05] start
[24:06] is they start from a single cell being
[24:09] and then it evolved into me eventually
[24:10] you know humans and you know chimpanzees
[24:12] and so on but they're not willing to go
[24:14] what happened before that single cell
[24:15] being came into formation and they're
[24:18] trying to explain it by how chemistry
[24:20] works but the laws of chemistry forbid
[24:21] it happening but they never go into that
[24:23] because
[24:24] they say well it just takes billions of
[24:25] years no what they think it's just
[24:27] they have to believe it to be so so they
[24:29] have a faith as well
[24:31] right but the basic laws of chemistry
[24:33] forbid it happening but but the thing is
[24:35] if i didn't know the author it could
[24:36] sway me
[24:37] or if i didn't know the author the
[24:38] christians on campus could have said
[24:40] well there's three gods and look i'll
[24:41] show you some scripture to show it's
[24:42] true and
[24:43] you know so there's even that but if you
[24:45] know in whom you have believed
[24:46] all the reasoning of the devil could not
[24:49] take you from who you believe because
[24:50] you've met the author
[24:52] and it's very vital that you know him
[24:54] this is essential in this day
[24:56] i mean even even if you take practical
[24:58] things about finding who to marry all
[24:59] those courtship all the things we've
[25:01] talked about
[25:01] if you don't know whom you have believed
[25:03] you can be swayed to do all different
[25:04] kinds of things
[25:05] but if you know him and if he leads your
[25:07] life then you'll
[25:08] you're on a good road right so so it's
[25:11] very
[25:12] important that we're a scriptural
[25:13] trained church and it's a vital as well
[25:16] that when you listen to the who listens
[25:18] to the message anyone here
[25:19] regularly your daily diet
[25:22] you should be able to find what brother
[25:24] and preachers in the scripture
[25:26] right you've got because what the
[25:28] message did it revealed jesus christ in
[25:30] the scripture
[25:31] it's not another bible we don't have
[25:33] another he revealed what the absolute
[25:35] says
[25:36] right from genesis to revelation so you
[25:38] should it actually behooves you to check
[25:40] if i'm telling you the truth do you know
[25:42] if it's true what i say
[25:44] does anyone go check me up you should
[25:48] you should you know yeah it's actually
[25:50] your own obligation to your own soul
[25:52] to make sure if i'm off the word or on
[25:55] the word and if i'm off i want to know
[25:57] right so it's your obligation is that
[26:00] really true does he
[26:01] did he really say that and is it really
[26:02] in the scripture you know so
[26:05] amen yeah i mean that shouldn't shock
[26:07] you i mean you know wish no we should
[26:08] check because remember
[26:09] this is this is our eternal destination
[26:11] we're talking about
[26:13] right it's not just you know but if you
[26:15] if you've been like brother brown would
[26:17] say about
[26:20] now this is moses so this is where
[26:22] brother brahman speaks about being on
[26:23] the sacred stands of meeting god
[26:25] moses met god in the pillar of fire in
[26:28] the burning bush
[26:29] he met the god of creation
[26:33] once he met once he met the lord
[26:37] no one could explain it away from he was
[26:39] there
[26:40] it happened it changed his life he had
[26:42] an experience
[26:43] no one talked him into it so no one can
[26:46] talk him out of it
[26:47] right no matter what obstacle he came
[26:48] against whatever trouble he faced in
[26:50] life
[26:51] he knew he had an experience with god on
[26:53] the sacred sands
[26:55] and it's the same thing with you and i
[26:57] because the same god that met moses
[26:59] became jesus christ right so the same
[27:02] god that spoke to moses out of the
[27:03] burning bush
[27:04] is the same god that speaks to us he's
[27:06] not a different god he's the same one
[27:08] does anyone know that's true
[27:10] you can take that through the bible i'm
[27:12] saying check me out
[27:14] have your eye on me is this guy telling
[27:15] you the truth or not
[27:17] so he met but the thing is moses could
[27:19] stand there in spite of all opposition
[27:22] and he knew god would take care of him
[27:23] you know when cor and dathan came
[27:25] against him he said well
[27:27] whoever is swallowed up by the earth
[27:28] basically is you know god will prove
[27:30] whose side who's on
[27:31] and god swallowed core and nathan up
[27:33] with all those people and god was with
[27:35] him
[27:35] every step of his journey and he'll be
[27:37] the same with us he'll be
[27:39] every step of our journey as well but
[27:41] you've got to meet him on the sacred
[27:42] sands
[27:43] that's why the apostle paul could say i
[27:45] known whom i have believed
[27:47] because he met the same god that moses
[27:49] met he met the same one
[27:51] right so he knew in whom he had believed
[27:53] so and you read through the apostle
[27:54] paul's life he had a lot of opposition
[27:56] it wasn't an easy road for him
[27:58] but he knew where he was going he knew
[28:00] and who he who he have believed and no
[28:01] one could explain it from him
[28:05] this is essential right this is
[28:07] essential because if you know him
[28:09] then you're going to heaven essentially
[28:11] i mean it's pretty it's pretty simple
[28:13] christianity's not complicated you know
[28:15] if you know the author
[28:16] and he's washed all your sins away which
[28:18] he has you're on your way to heaven
[28:20] so you've got to know in whom you have
[28:21] believed now
[28:24] he says here in time tested faith
[28:25] brother sister there's a secret place
[28:27] that every believer should go on the
[28:28] backside of the desert on those sacred
[28:30] sands and no doctor of theology
[28:32] no greek or hebrew scholar no school or
[28:34] seminary they might twist you all up in
[28:36] those
[28:37] kind of things but if you've ever met
[28:39] god on those sacred sands satan can't
[28:41] put his feet on them sans you know
[28:43] you met god something real what was it
[28:45] you talked to god yourself you had
[28:47] an experience because these kind of
[28:50] people
[28:51] they're smart they have all their
[28:53] theories
[28:54] you go read into it it will tangle you
[28:57] but if you've met god on those sacred
[28:59] sounds like moses did
[29:01] those things will never actually pull
[29:03] you off the road they may
[29:04] trouble you a bit but if you know and
[29:06] whom you have believed you go back to
[29:07] that source amen you can you can stand
[29:10] the test
[29:11] right but if you haven't met him then
[29:13] you will be
[29:14] pulled off the track right so this is
[29:17] very vital now
[29:19] do i have like let's just okay i don't
[29:21] know if you can read this but i just
[29:22] want to maybe segue and then go back to
[29:25] what i'm talking about now this is this
[29:27] is a paper
[29:28] from 2000 and i believe it's 17
[29:32] and it talks about gut microbiota's
[29:35] effect on mental health
[29:37] so what's talking about is the link
[29:38] between the health of your gut and your
[29:40] brain
[29:41] and what they've what they've found is
[29:44] the health of your gut
[29:46] affects your mood right okay so i'll
[29:49] just read the abstract
[29:51] the bi-directional communication between
[29:53] the nervous system
[29:54] and gut microbiota referred to as the
[29:57] gut brain access
[29:59] has been of significant interest in
[30:01] recent years so what it means is
[30:02] basically they found out
[30:04] that your brain talks to your gut and
[30:05] your gut talks to your brain that's what
[30:07] that means
[30:08] increasing evidence has associated gut
[30:10] microbiota so what this is is what's
[30:12] growing in your gut
[30:13] okay to both gastrointestinal
[30:16] and extra gastrointestinal diseases so
[30:19] so what's going on in here will affect
[30:21] your gut health and then even
[30:23] beyond your gut
[30:26] diaspiasis and inflammation of the gut
[30:28] have been linked to several
[30:30] mental illnesses including anxiety
[30:32] depression which are prevalent in
[30:35] society today probiotics have the
[30:37] ability to restore
[30:38] normal antimicrobial balance and
[30:40] therefore have a potential role
[30:42] in the treatment and prevention of
[30:44] anxiety and depression
[30:46] and it says this review aims to discuss
[30:48] the development of gut microbiota
[30:50] the linkage of uh dies biases to anxiety
[30:53] and depression and possible applications
[30:55] of probiotics to reduce
[30:56] symptoms now what affects your gut it's
[30:59] what you eat
[31:01] right so what you eat affects your gut
[31:04] so if you're eating so this is just in
[31:05] the natural but but
[31:06] it's got a spiritual application because
[31:08] because if you naturally
[31:10] if your if your thinking is affected by
[31:13] what you eat
[31:14] naturally then so spiritually your
[31:17] thinking is
[31:18] affected by what you eat spiritually
[31:20] right so
[31:21] even they've found out things like um um
[31:25] what do you call it uh autism asperger's
[31:28] different spectrums of those kind of
[31:30] mental health areas
[31:31] it's assured as can be treated by
[31:33] improving gut health
[31:36] so now here's a question what are you
[31:40] feeding on because if you're feeding on
[31:44] just like in the natural if you're
[31:46] feeding just on junk food
[31:47] it will affect your mood because it
[31:50] affects the health of your gut and
[31:51] therefore it affects your brain
[31:53] so so they found that mental illnesses
[31:56] are linked to anxiety and depression are
[31:58] linked into
[31:59] the health of the gut right so if you're
[32:02] feeding on the wrong things
[32:03] then you will be thinking the wrong way
[32:06] you actually be thinking in a bad way we
[32:07] should be
[32:08] so anxiety always stressed and worried
[32:10] about everything
[32:11] and depression that's just from having
[32:13] bad gut health
[32:14] how much more spiritually if you're not
[32:16] feeding on the right things
[32:18] right if you're not actually feeding on
[32:19] the word because when you read the
[32:21] scriptures when you hear the message it
[32:22] should tell you you're an overcomer
[32:24] that god's grace is sufficient that
[32:26] we're made in his image we're going to
[32:27] go on a rapture you know we
[32:29] the devil's under our feet you know
[32:30] isn't well that's what i hear what you
[32:32] know when i hear it you know
[32:33] but but that guy so what does that do it
[32:35] changes my thinking that my
[32:36] thinking becomes positive i can make it
[32:39] right i'm gonna make it jesus already
[32:41] made it for me because he died of me on
[32:43] calvary i'm gonna make it because he
[32:44] made it
[32:45] i'm gonna overcome because he overcame
[32:47] right that's that's how my thinking is
[32:49] by based on what i eat but if i'm eating
[32:51] the things of the world if i'm caught up
[32:53] in the news or whatever media stuff then
[32:55] my thinking becomes negative
[32:57] and that's where worry can happen and
[32:58] what's going to happen in the future
[32:59] what's going to happen to this country
[33:01] what's going to happen to this world and
[33:02] the environment and different issues and
[33:04] stuff but it's because you feed on the
[33:06] wrong thing
[33:07] right but if you feed on the right thing
[33:09] then you become physically strong
[33:10] there's even says here that
[33:12] probiotics have the ability to restore
[33:14] the natural
[33:15] microbial balance right so eating
[33:17] something healthy or something healthy
[33:18] will actually bring you into the right
[33:20] balance that's why it's so important
[33:22] you've got to feed on the message feed
[33:24] on the bible
[33:25] right there's plenty of good ministries
[33:27] online feed on them
[33:29] right because it actually makes you
[33:31] think clearly
[33:32] it doesn't make you think carnally like
[33:34] the world it makes you think spiritually
[33:36] and brother brahm says that the holy
[33:38] ghost feeds on the word
[33:40] so if you want the whole who knows of
[33:41] the holy ghost brother ram says it's
[33:43] like
[33:43] when you when you're first born into the
[33:45] kingdom
[33:47] the holy ghost is in you like the size
[33:48] of a button
[33:51] who's heard him say that right but then
[33:53] eventually it goes from just being the
[33:54] size of a button and it begins to grow
[33:56] until it grows until it fills your whole
[33:58] being
[33:59] right but in order for something to grow
[34:01] like if i starved my children if i
[34:03] didn't feed them they're not going to
[34:04] grow
[34:04] if i don't feed myself i'm not going to
[34:06] grow either i'm going to die
[34:08] right so the same now we know the holy
[34:10] ghost can't die but if you want him to
[34:11] grow and take over your life more who
[34:13] wants more overcoming power
[34:15] who wants things that used to toss you
[34:17] about don't toss you about no more
[34:18] well the best way to overcome things is
[34:21] to feed on the word feed on the lord
[34:23] and the holy ghost in your life will
[34:24] grow and expand and then and then he
[34:26] will actually fight the battle in your
[34:28] life
[34:29] right so so but this is a big field of
[34:32] science i think it's quite interesting
[34:34] but
[34:34] um it's not my field but anyway um but
[34:37] your gut health is associated with
[34:39] mental health
[34:41] and that's what the devil the devil
[34:42] always try and cut brother and says you
[34:44] try and cut your prayer life and if he's
[34:46] cut your prayer life he says he's got
[34:47] you
[34:48] right so it's very he said he was asked
[34:50] a question how do you become a better
[34:52] stronger christian
[34:53] read your bible and pray every day who
[34:55] makes time for that
[34:58] good thing good for you you know but but
[34:59] that's how we should be
[35:01] because you know if you look at the
[35:02] olympics that's on at the moment
[35:05] they don't casually just eat whatever's
[35:06] in the fridge
[35:08] right they have a goal they want to win
[35:09] a medal they want to actually
[35:11] they want to get the gold they just
[35:12] don't want to turn up they want to win
[35:14] so down to every meal they eat and when
[35:16] they eat it and how much and so on
[35:18] that's that that's actually measured and
[35:19] everything for them
[35:20] it's not just a casual i feel like
[35:22] mcdonald's today i'll go have mcdonald's
[35:24] or i feel like pizza hut or
[35:25] i don't feel like my broccoli so i'm not
[35:26] going to eat that no no they eat what
[35:28] they're given
[35:29] because they know it does them good
[35:30] because they know they're actually built
[35:32] to win a gold
[35:34] right and and if we actually have it if
[35:35] we've met
[35:37] if we have met the lord on the on on the
[35:39] sacred sands
[35:40] we know the lord has made us to overcome
[35:43] right so he knows
[35:45] so so the lord has made us actually
[35:47] stand on the podium
[35:49] right in that in that first place
[35:52] so if he's made us that if that's our
[35:53] goal then really we should think you
[35:55] know
[35:56] our life actually every day has a
[35:59] purpose
[36:01] okay we're not just filling in time here
[36:03] hey
[36:04] you guys aren't i trust you don't feel
[36:06] that way sometimes we feel that way
[36:08] but in reality every day is important
[36:11] every day we should be working what
[36:12] towards the goal of what we want to be
[36:14] more like the lord
[36:16] so he says i believe christian
[36:21] i mean i believe friends that no man has
[36:23] right to profess christianity as a
[36:24] christian
[36:25] until he's found such a retreat they
[36:28] they may come a time when men who are
[36:30] worldly trained
[36:32] not godly scent might be able to explain
[36:34] all the supernatural away from the bible
[36:36] and they've done that
[36:37] they might be able to satisfy the carnal
[36:39] mind but that that doesn't know god that
[36:42] the days of miracles are past there's no
[36:44] such a thing as the holy ghost
[36:45] but if a man ever has had an experience
[36:48] where you met god
[36:49] all the theologians in the world could
[36:51] never take that experience away from you
[36:53] you meet god face to face and you know
[36:55] what you're talking about
[36:57] i mean like moses said that sacred
[36:58] stands in the backside of the desert
[37:00] when a man ever meets god upon them
[37:01] sacred sands of that secret place the
[37:03] retreat
[37:04] no devil in hell can ever take him take
[37:06] that away from him for he knows he's
[37:08] talked face to face with god
[37:10] they can explain anything they want to
[37:12] but you were there when it happened
[37:14] and you know what you speak of
[37:17] amen amen this is yeah i mean i mean
[37:19] this should be i trust don't look at
[37:22] your failures your or your successes
[37:25] moses had failures
[37:26] right but look at have you met the lord
[37:29] have you met the lord on the backside of
[37:30] the desert
[37:31] really have you really been in his
[37:32] presence he's talked to you you've
[37:34] talked back to him
[37:35] and he's changed your life hallelujah
[37:38] this is
[37:39] i mean this is how we should be you know
[37:41] we go from
[37:42] hearing about the lord then you meet him
[37:44] what he says in your
[37:46] what he says in his word he'll do he
[37:48] does for us
[37:49] you know that's why i read that
[37:50] scripture this morning in romans 5 where
[37:52] it says
[37:52] the love of god is shed abroad in our
[37:55] hearts by the holy ghost which is given
[37:57] unto us
[37:58] i was standing the lord was dealing with
[38:00] me i was in a spot where
[38:03] i mean i'll probably share this too many
[38:04] times but i did everything the world
[38:07] could give me
[38:08] i did it movies music
[38:11] girls drinking drugs sometimes
[38:14] everything
[38:14] i was a typical uni student i was lost
[38:16] in the world but then i heard this
[38:18] message
[38:19] and the lord began to deal with me even
[38:21] i always believed that jesus was god but
[38:23] i realized i had never met him before
[38:25] and i began to listen to messages like
[38:28] because i didn't have a church to go to
[38:29] there were churches in christchurch but
[38:30] i had no idea
[38:32] any of them but you know i just found on
[38:34] the internet
[38:36] the message so i just picked sermon
[38:37] tiles begin to listen and some were like
[38:39] the seal of god and why so many fail to
[38:42] keep the victory and hidden life of
[38:43] christ i listen to these ones
[38:45] and the lord spoke to me and i realized
[38:48] i did not
[38:49] know him that's a good place to be
[38:52] because if you know you're lost you can
[38:54] be found right so it's a very good place
[38:56] to be if
[38:57] you know if you need help you know
[38:59] there's one that can help you right but
[39:00] if you
[39:01] but if you think you're fine but you're
[39:02] not fine that's a bad place to be so
[39:04] anyway so i began to listen and i was so
[39:06] convicted i was just in my room i was
[39:08] flatting with friends that
[39:09] had no idea i had any kind of christian
[39:10] kind of inkling at all
[39:12] and i'd sit with headphones in my room
[39:14] scared they'd come in and bust me
[39:15] listening to these sermons and
[39:16] you know but i was so convicted i'd just
[39:18] be crying and
[39:20] but the thing is i didn't know what to
[39:21] do i knew i actually at
[39:24] before then i was baptized correctly but
[39:26] that was just
[39:27] uh you know but i never went to church
[39:30] never had any
[39:31] kind of you know well any any real
[39:32] church anyway but you know but then the
[39:34] lord i just said to the lord i said lord
[39:36] take everything from my life that's
[39:37] contrary to your word that you can come
[39:39] and dwell in me
[39:40] and he then he took the drinking he took
[39:42] the music he took all these things from
[39:45] me
[39:45] he took the desire out of me so it
[39:47] wasn't me having to clean my life up and
[39:49] that's the thing
[39:49] sometimes we think we have to do
[39:51] something we just have to surrender and
[39:52] he does the work
[39:54] and then i was actually and this is why
[39:56] it's so important you gotta think about
[39:57] what do you think about during the day
[39:59] because if you think ab you know the
[40:01] reality of it is if you begin to
[40:02] meditate upon the lord and his goodness
[40:04] he begins to draw near he begins to draw
[40:07] near
[40:07] and you can be in your house you can be
[40:09] driving you can be at work can be
[40:10] anywhere and the spirit of god can come
[40:12] just so real
[40:13] right down it feels like you're just
[40:14] gonna jump out of your skin
[40:16] and i was i was washing dishes i was i
[40:19] was working in a
[40:20] student hostel kitchen part-time when i
[40:22] was at uni i was just thinking about the
[40:23] lord
[40:24] and i was actually the chef was a temp
[40:26] chef there and we were talking about how
[40:28] bad the world was getting i don't know
[40:29] why we were on that conversation but
[40:31] um but then i began to think about the
[40:32] lord and and then the lord's love
[40:34] filled my heart and it wasn't a painful
[40:37] thing was like a presence just filled my
[40:38] heart
[40:39] and it was so awesome and and and but i
[40:42] realized at the moment how much i love
[40:44] him
[40:44] because how much he loved me because he
[40:46] dived me on calvary before that people
[40:48] say god loves you and god is love and
[40:50] what does that mean
[40:51] oh no yeah i thought what does that mean
[40:52] but then when when that experience
[40:54] happened
[40:55] it changed my whole life changed my
[40:57] whole life
[40:58] and there were other you know and then
[41:00] the bible became a personal book you
[41:02] know i was reading first or second peter
[41:03] which i already read and it was peter
[41:04] was writing to me
[41:06] in 2007 and it's still that same kind of
[41:08] a book you know different things
[41:09] happened but but there was
[41:11] but i believe i met the lord on the
[41:13] sacred sands
[41:15] right and no one can take that from me
[41:16] because i was there when it happened and
[41:17] actually changed my life
[41:19] so this is why this is very dear to me
[41:23] because i i was i had no church
[41:26] i i had the bible that i was reading
[41:28] when i was sober
[41:29] and i had the message that i was
[41:30] listening to sometimes and the lord
[41:32] through those two things found
[41:34] me and i was lost man i was so lost
[41:37] and so to me now if if if the lord can
[41:40] meet me
[41:41] i think he can meet anyone you know you
[41:44] can you can step onto those sacred sands
[41:46] as well and you can ha
[41:48] and if you have i trust you rejoicing
[41:50] you know but
[41:52] if you haven't i just really want to
[41:53] encourage you he's here to meet
[41:56] you know he's a living god he's not
[41:59] he's not an idea or theory and no
[42:04] no devil in hell no one with their
[42:06] reasoning or their arguments can ever
[42:08] take it from you
[42:09] and when the devil comes along and his
[42:11] argument seems so right
[42:13] there's something in he says no it's so
[42:15] wrong and he protects you from those
[42:17] things
[42:20] so what's the time
[42:26] so i'm gonna that's actually all i want
[42:28] to talk to you about
[42:29] this afternoon but i pray that if you
[42:31] don't have a hunger and thirst
[42:33] to meet him i i just had a hunger
[42:35] because i knew i didn't know him but i
[42:36] knew
[42:36] he could be met and
[42:40] i didn't i still don't know how to pray
[42:41] but i just you just mean it from your
[42:43] heart lord
[42:44] i want to meet you i want to know
[42:46] because i wanted to know my sins i
[42:48] believed my sins were forgiven but i
[42:49] wanted to know they are forgiven
[42:50] you know because he gives a stability in
[42:52] your life you know he doesn't like to
[42:54] leave
[42:54] questions hanging over you because the
[42:56] devil uses questions against you
[42:58] he might tries to make you second guess
[43:00] your salvation but the lord doesn't
[43:02] allow those things to hang there if you
[43:03] seek the lord say lord i want to know
[43:06] you know and in his time he keeps
[43:07] seeking remember it's him that him that
[43:08] knocketh
[43:10] him that knocketh it shall be opened him
[43:11] that seeketh will find
[43:13] so i just i i wanted to know
[43:17] and i was simple enough i think i still
[43:18] am that if
[43:20] if god says you can meet him then you
[43:22] can meet him
[43:23] right and if he changes people's lives
[43:25] he changes people's lives
[43:27] and i believed it was for me and i was a
[43:30] rotten i was a rotten sinner
[43:31] i was a rotten sinner but the lord
[43:34] doesn't look at where we are
[43:35] he looks at our desire that's and he put
[43:38] that desire in us and and that's what he
[43:40] looks at that's all he cares about
[43:41] he doesn't hold your past against you
[43:43] what you're going through your battles
[43:44] your failures whatever
[43:46] he doesn't hold those things against you
[43:47] all he looks is what is their desire and
[43:49] he puts that desire on us
[43:50] and he want and he says all that come to
[43:52] me i know why is cast out
[43:54] i know i love that
[43:58] because i came to him and he didn't cast
[43:59] me out hallelujah and sometimes i think
[44:02] man why'd you bother lord but
[44:03] he doesn't change his mind
[44:07] amen that's the reason today
[44:12] they don't have the experience what's
[44:14] the reason they can't say they're all
[44:16] saying who is this what is this where
[44:17] does this come from
[44:19] they don't have the answer why because
[44:20] all they know is a theology that some
[44:22] church has made
[44:23] not to know theology is life no to know
[44:26] not to know the bible is life but to
[44:28] know him is life
[44:30] to know him as your personal savior as
[44:32] the one who has filled you with his
[44:33] presence
[44:34] you were there when it happened there's
[44:36] nobody can take it away from you
[44:38] there's no one can explain it away for
[44:41] you
[44:41] when that experience happens to you you
[44:43] know who he is to me he is jesus christ
[44:46] the same yesterday today and forever
[44:50] i mean so to know him is life and
[44:53] that's why we actually gather to know
[44:56] him
[44:57] right that's why we gather that people
[45:00] would meet him
[45:01] and just walk in joy and peace for the
[45:02] rest of their days
[45:04] so i'm gonna leave it there but honestly
[45:11] how's your spiritual gut health
[45:14] i trust it's healthy i trust your
[45:16] emotions are balanced
[45:18] spiritually that you're not living on
[45:21] spiritual junk food because even
[45:22] everything we we we watch and do and see
[45:25] it has a spirit with it right
[45:29] i can this can open up a portal to hell
[45:32] or it can open up a portal to glory on
[45:35] this device
[45:37] and what comes out of here will it will
[45:39] affect me here
[45:41] and it'll affect how i think in here
[45:44] right
[45:46] so and honestly
[45:49] people you know some people think
[45:51] there's no fun in being a christian to
[45:52] me this is the most fun i ever had in my
[45:54] life
[45:55] i had a lot of fun too in the world i
[45:57] wasn't some you know but
[45:58] this is way more fun to know him and
[46:01] once you meet him i like
[46:03] the only regret i ever had is i didn't
[46:04] meet him earlier
[46:06] that's my only regret but when you meet
[46:08] him he's just a satisfying portion so
[46:10] i encourage you listen to the message
[46:14] read your bible and pray every day
[46:17] that's the secret
[46:18] because that's your source of strength
[46:20] right

[46:25] is your spiritual gut health

[46:31] probiotic called a gospel
[46:34] right that will restore all the balance
[46:36] of everything healthy

[46:42] meet him on those sacred sands

[47:40] scripture lord jesus you're the god of
[47:41] your word

[47:51] lord you haven't changed lord you met
[47:53] your children in that upper room
[47:56] and no pressure from the sadducees
[47:58] pharisees herodians from the greeks
[48:00] scholars the stoics or whatever the
[48:03] different philosophies of the day none
[48:05] of them could explain that away
[48:07] because they meet you on those sacred
[48:09] sands and lord that experience of
[48:11] meeting you lord it held them lord that
[48:14] experience you had with the apostle paul
[48:17] held him oh god no matter what trouble
[48:19] he went through what strife he had to
[48:21] endure
[48:22] he said i've known whom i have believed
[48:24] and am persuaded he's able to keep that
[48:26] which i've committed to him against that
[48:28] day and we know
[48:29] that that he committed to him was his
[48:31] own soul
[48:32] he was persuaded oh god because he had
[48:35] that meeting with you
[48:36] and lord jesus i know you're the same
[48:38] god
[48:39] right now this afternoon lord you don't
[48:41] change my god

[48:50] heart lord but you found me
[48:51] lord you lord you took me onto those
[48:53] sacred sands that day
[48:55] and you've just got sweeter and richer
[48:57] as the days have gone by from that
[48:59] moment till now

[49:02] be their experience
[49:03] lord if they haven't met you lord i pray

[49:07] puts such a hunger and a thirst in their
[49:09] lives lord until they have that
[49:12] meeting with you on those sacred sands
[49:13] that no atheist no religion
[49:16] no nothing of this world could explain
[49:19] you away from them oh god because they
[49:21] know in whom they have believed
[49:22] please may you grant it father i just
[49:24] want to pray as well that
[49:26] lord that our lord i know is a crude way
[49:29] of
[49:29] speaking about our gut health and our
[49:30] emotional health and and then applying
[49:32] it spiritually but
[49:33] lord i pray that we would examine our
[49:35] lives how was our spiritual health
[49:37] are we eating on the right things are we
[49:39] lord is it lord is it or is our mind
[49:41] full of
[49:42] unbelief and anxiety and worry and
[49:44] stress and carnal things oh lord is it
[49:46] is it full of the goodness of god and
[49:48] your riches and lord just
[49:49] lord real spiritual vitamins that
[49:51] strengthen us lord we know that the
[49:53] devil
[49:53] lord he he still has a right to come
[49:56] into our minds and give us mind battles
[49:58] but
[49:59] lord we know if our health is strong if
[50:00] our immunity and you are strong
[50:02] lord jesus lord if you are on the inside
[50:05] of the inside o god you're the one who
[50:06] fights that battle and casts them away
[50:08] so lord i just want to pray for each one
[50:10] hero god that they would know you
[50:13] lord the power of your resurrection o
[50:15] god that they would know they could
[50:16] always point back to a certain moment in
[50:18] time
[50:18] and say it was then i met him and my
[50:21] life has never been the same sure
[50:23] there's many ups and downs since meeting
[50:24] him but lord you take us through all
