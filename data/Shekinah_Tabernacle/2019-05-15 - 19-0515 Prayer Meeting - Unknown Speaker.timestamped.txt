[16:30] you've come tonight that the Lord would
[16:31] sleep over your soul this before brother
[16:34] in brings the word and leads us into
[16:36] free I just asked you know we've changed
[16:39] how we do pre meetings how we're praying
[16:40] all together I know you know for the
[16:42] little ones it can be seem a bit long
[16:44] but you know just if you could just be
[16:46] still talk to the Lord you know don't go
[16:49] out out and in and you know talk to him
[16:52] you're not too young for him to speak to
[16:54] you in an atmosphere like this so you
[16:57] know just just just be reverent and talk
[17:01] to the Lord and you'll find that the
[17:03] time doesn't take that long to go I mean
[17:06] so this just thing that just again just
[17:08] as brother it brings the brings the word
[17:11] and I'm under expectation you know we
[17:14] God as anything can happen God's here
[17:17] need to say where two or three are
[17:19] gathered in my name there I am in the
[17:20] middle so he's praising here and you
[17:22] thankful he's not just in some place I
[17:25] mean
[17:31] [Music]
[17:48] [Music]
[18:24] probably see sites
[18:28] first time for everything
[18:30] yeah I am
[18:34] thank you for coming out thank you for
[18:37] being obedient to the heavenly vision
[18:40] and thank you that I can for you
[18:43] feminine the Lord's been good to me
[18:47] it's been good to us we should always
[18:52] expect more than a box yeah and we've
[18:57] got miracles so my thought
[19:02] today is the miracle before the miracle
[19:05] and I'll start off I have no idea how to
[19:09] start after England but I'll start with
[19:15] a definition the definition of miracle
[19:18] is an extraordinary and welcome event
[19:22] there is not explicit explainable by
[19:27] natural or scientific laws and therefore
[19:31] it's attributed to a divine agency the
[19:36] miracle of rising from the grave
[19:38] synonyms net supernatural phenomenon
[19:41] mystery prodigy sign and in quotes his
[19:46] first miracle was to turn water to wine
[19:49] this this comes from from the tree of
[19:51] knowledge of good and evil good old
[19:54] Google out thee so it's not like I've
[19:56] I've altered anything here so they had
[19:59] to quote it feels like they almost given
[20:01] up on that definition like we cannot
[20:04] explain this must be divine agency and I
[20:08] said praise to praise be to God
[20:11] I quickly better better search and the
[20:15] word miracles appear 27 times in in the
[20:20] Bible I have on my phone
[20:22] miracle appears 10 times in the Bible so
[20:26] remember those numbers that this is one
[20:29] us for free I I only got it this
[20:31] afternoon and yeah I was trying to hold
[20:35] it together anyway so weird all started
[20:39] so we were up in Auckland and we were
[20:44] having a wonderful time in the
[20:46] convention and and I think some of the
[20:49] constant constant conversation went
[20:52] around or good wholesome ones and then
[20:55] there was one concerning ones as in
[20:58] where is the miracles around us why
[21:00] can't well why are we not seeing
[21:02] miracles now today eyes I went quiet i
[21:06] sat back in it that I actually don't
[21:08] know how to answer that right here and
[21:11] and and explicitly but that gave that
[21:14] that brought the thoughts and I think
[21:16] that's the Lord just placed the seed so
[21:18] I sighs just started thinking about that
[21:21] and while we were doing our little
[21:23] convention
[21:23] on the other side of the world there was
[21:25] a youth meeting on and a youth camp and
[21:29] one of the sermons mercy walked in from
[21:33] of the Doni watered the seed and that
[21:39] mercy walked in and how Merkel's
[21:42] attached through that faith keep on
[21:46] walking that's all attached right and a
[21:53] while ago I wrote a song and clearly I'm
[21:56] not finished yet call don't miss your
[21:59] Messiah there's a bit of a miracle and
[22:02] and and witness and this Dominion that
[22:04] on its own but that made me think if you
[22:08] miss your Messiah
[22:09] you miss your daily miracle right so
[22:13] that's now where I want to head there's
[22:18] a sermon that the Prophet preached if
[22:20] God be with us
[22:21] then where is all the miracles
[22:24] I'll read you judges 6 verse 24 to 27 if
[22:30] you want to read with me judges 6 verse
[22:35] 24 to 27 and an Amen if you D sounds
[22:51] like majority vote then Gibeon built an
[22:55] altar there unto the Lord and called it
[22:58] Jehovah Shalom very very very nice name
[23:02] God of peace God's peace unto this day
[23:06] it is yet in the Opera of the abyss she
[23:11] writes and it came to pass the same
[23:13] night that the Lord said unto Him take
[23:16] thy father's young Bullock even the
[23:18] second burlock of seven years old throw
[23:21] them down the altar of Baal that thy
[23:24] father hath and cuts down the grove that
[23:27] is by it and build an altar unto the
[23:29] Lord thy God upon the top of this rock
[23:32] into the ordered place and take the
[23:35] second block and offer burnt sacrifice
[23:37] with the wood of the grove which thou
[23:40] shall cut down then Gideon took 10 men
[23:42] of his servants and did as the Lord had
[23:45] said unto him and so it was because he
[23:49] feared his father's household and the
[23:51] men of the city and he could not do it
[23:54] by day but he did it by night I will
[23:58] quickly and you can have your seats
[24:00] thank you very much
[24:04] I'll quickly I'll carry on and then I'll
[24:10] get back to that so in the sermon so
[24:13] I'll do a bit of reading here which just
[24:18] highlights where we are now what I'm
[24:21] reading here is as strong as zealous as
[24:25] passionate but this is what the Prophet
[24:28] brought us and this message I feel is
[24:32] for us here today that he spoke of in
[24:36] 1960
[24:37] oh we living in a grand time immediately
[24:42] when the profit went off the scene what
[24:45] happened the Lord came on the scene as
[24:48] soon as John went off the scene the Lord
[24:51] came on the scene very strange our God
[24:54] works but he does it works in mysterious
[24:57] way that's the way the devil does so
[25:00] this is now just dropping another
[25:01] paragraph this that's the way the devil
[25:03] does it we get a little church started
[25:06] everything going well going fine
[25:09] how many preachers don't know this to be
[25:11] the truth just about the time everything
[25:14] is going right some old impostor will
[25:16] come right amongst that group and tear
[25:18] it to pieces that's right
[25:20] snatch the church right from a man if he
[25:23] can do that
[25:24] see that's the devil come in like
[25:26] grasshoppers and take take what's been
[25:28] given right so come like grasshoppers
[25:33] this is now where Gideon was surrounded
[25:36] basically and the angel of the Lord
[25:38] appeared and there was a and as he was
[25:42] saying and I think it comes down to that
[25:45] yet so I'll carry on and Gideon asked a
[25:48] question what a scriptural man that was
[25:51] that's the kind of man that God comes
[25:53] through somebody who knows Gideon said
[25:56] if God is with us if you are the
[25:59] messenger then where is the miracles
[26:01] that the Prophet told us about he knows
[26:04] he knew everywhere God went his miracles
[26:07] followed him he know that wherever God
[26:11] would be miracles would be I ask you now
[26:14] is God here tonight it's a simple law
[26:17] it's a promise it's given to us thus
[26:20] saith the Lord
[26:21] miracles are here I've had a terrible
[26:25] day today at work
[26:26] I'm here wife is lying Valentin vanities
[26:33] but there's sore throats and this just
[26:35] nothing everything in our house we're
[26:37] here right this is not me this is not
[26:41] the know Deus this is God
[26:47] and I'll carry on where's all the mighty
[26:50] miracles because we understand listen
[26:52] now scripture Gideon was in other words
[26:54] he said we understand that God is a
[26:56] great God of mighty workings he's a
[26:58] great God of miracles and if he is for
[27:01] us if he is with us if he is the same
[27:04] yesterday today and forever how where
[27:07] can I see his miracles it means it way
[27:10] I'm waiting I'm expecting there's a hope
[27:13] where is this where can I see this God
[27:16] in action where he's at
[27:18] if he is for us he's for us now that
[27:22] mighty men of valor could refer back to
[27:24] the old word and know what's right
[27:26] because he know that God is a
[27:28] supernatural being and wherever and
[27:30] supernatural being is he'll do
[27:32] supernatural signs because supernatural
[27:36] is in him you just can't get out of it
[27:39] how can you stand in the face of wind
[27:42] without being wind blowing how can you
[27:45] get in water without being wet water is
[27:47] wet that's a chemical it's wet
[27:49] yeah and when you get in water you're
[27:52] going to get wet
[27:54] expect a miracle tonight expected pray
[27:57] abundantly pray boldly pray with
[27:59] authority Lord's just given this to us
[28:03] out of grace and when you get into the
[28:07] presence of God the supernatural there's
[28:09] going to be a supernatural science and
[28:11] supranational workings of a supernatural
[28:13] God therefore he said where is the
[28:16] working where's the miracles if God be
[28:17] with us that's it glory see where God is
[28:21] miracles are we God is the sign of God
[28:24] is there okay a miracle before the
[28:28] miracle I'll refer this quickly
[28:32] okay I'll jump back I've said that
[28:37] miracle appears 27 times miracle appears
[28:41] 10 times in the Bible okay we read
[28:45] scripture that said take thy father's
[28:50] young Bullock even the second block of
[28:53] seven years okay drop down to verse 20
[29:00] drop down to verse 27 then Gideon took
[29:04] 10 men of his servants and did as the
[29:07] Lord had said unto him now they said
[29:11] there's quite a few pastors and
[29:12] preachers out there that love to take
[29:14] the numerology
[29:15] I'm Way too dumb for us but this jumped
[29:18] out to me I was saying Lord
[29:20] there must be significance in the in the
[29:22] amount brother James did the while back
[29:24] in his sermon and that I love that that
[29:27] kind of thing that kind of homework that
[29:29] they go and do but this just jumped out
[29:31] I said Lord but wake and I find this I
[29:34] was I was in the book of Acts looking at
[29:35] extant when he save and they're like
[29:37] whoa how can i that's me so that's flesh
[29:42] that's trying to put something together
[29:43] that might not be here I am looking and
[29:47] reading up on a sermon and I said oh I
[29:50] should just maybe catch up on the on the
[29:52] actual scripture and go to judges 6
[29:53] hello come back to the wood come back to
[29:59] the wood right so let's okay so back to
[30:07] our my thought from our convention and
[30:12] the youth camp there were two preachers
[30:14] from the same country okay but
[30:17] kilometres on their case miles apart
[30:20] from each other so bro brother Andrew
[30:24] Glover flies 1260 kilometers to a youth
[30:29] camp in Louisiana do I say that right
[30:33] Louisiana brother David Siler flew to us
[30:38] to Oakland 13700 kilometers to New
[30:42] Zealand Louisiana is in Central Standard
[30:46] Time I think on the and New Zealand sits
[30:50] in New Zealand Standard Time 17 hours
[30:52] apart okay on Saturday morning twinny
[30:55] April I stand corrected but this is how
[30:59] I thought it was in that sermon on
[31:02] Saturday morning 20 April u.s. time
[31:07] rather Andrew delivers our powerful
[31:10] Burrell sermon which ends with the story
[31:13] of Lazarus Lazarus come forth and
[31:18] congregation the youth they went
[31:21] ballistic it was magnificent to behold
[31:24] and please go and listen to that on even
[31:29] evilly night tabernacle brew David
[31:33] brother David silo so on the same day on
[31:38] the other side of the world he delivers
[31:41] a powerful liberal sermon he was free he
[31:45] was he was expressing himself he didn't
[31:47] have focus and he refers to the same
[31:51] exact event yeah both of them
[31:56] exclamative that Jesus didn't walk over
[31:59] and whispered at the grave he didn't say
[32:05] to Mary and Martha turn away I just want
[32:09] to you know just give me a second he
[32:13] said Lazarus come forth okay and in in
[32:19] the same way it was delivered miles
[32:22] apart now I'm just going pulling in the
[32:28] right direction we're entering into the
[32:30] same Channel
[32:31] keep on walking in the middle of the
[32:33] road
[32:36] one thing that clearly I was I've
[32:39] skipped I was a bit too in my haste but
[32:43] I'll come maybe that's how I should end
[32:46] the Prophet also said if the weakest of
[32:49] Christians get on their knees hell
[32:52] shakes I'll tell you now back in 1999 I
[32:56] was one of the weakest Christians there
[32:58] was I was ironically in service year for
[33:01] Christ and we had different names for
[33:04] that it was just in some cases it was a
[33:08] joke right but at that point we had a
[33:10] youth camp there was about thousand four
[33:12] hundred kids on the grounds
[33:13] I've told someone that we had kitchen
[33:17] duty of two hours sessions he would just
[33:19] cut cabbage for two hours or
[33:21] it was stinking hot it was not good
[33:25] right there was a fire that erupted it
[33:31] was this this was in the war pops in the
[33:34] Western Cape Province
[33:36] I cannot remember for the life of me the
[33:38] campgrounds name hopefully maybe Lundy
[33:40] can but the fire came towards the ground
[33:44] and we know all the fire storm and wind
[33:47] and how it causes its own you know path
[33:50] and trajectory and everything and we as
[33:54] meek as weak Christians stood on the
[33:58] boundary and said god save these kids
[34:01] we're here for your glory we're not here
[34:04] for any anything and any of everyone
[34:06] else I wish I had a photo the fire
[34:10] stopped at the at the white fence that's
[34:14] it
[34:14] there was I was witness I gave that yes
[34:21] that's 1999 but like I mentioned just
[34:25] now recently there's miracles happening
[34:27] here
[34:28] these testimonies as I mentioned that's
[34:30] about now it is you are testifying you
[34:33] are witnessing you are living in this
[34:35] hour
[34:37] take the take the miracles it's yours

[36:00] want to ask you if you can be liberal
[36:03] among us Lord if you can supply us with
[36:06] our needs Lord if you can make a miracle
[36:09] happen here that can only refer to
[36:12] divine agency Lord we love our Creator
[36:16] Lord and we love it that you can come
[36:18] and sit and be an individual garden next
[36:21] to each and each one of us you are
[36:24] outside of time and space and matter
[36:27] Lord so that you can provide to us
[36:30] everything we do not need to be short on
[36:35] everything Lord and I just want to be
[36:38] humbled here I want to glorify your name
[36:42] I want to come and speak to you Lord and
[36:46] hear my heart and surrender Lord
[36:49] everything I have like brother Donny
[36:52] said I want to really surrender my heart
[36:55] I don't want to come to this church
[36:57] because it's a tradition or a routine
[36:59] because I love my brethren and sister
[37:02] even so it is I want to come here
[37:05] because I have a surrendered heart oh
[37:07] Jesus
[37:07] see it Lord and discern it come as a
[37:11] tooth sharp two-edged sword Lord and
[37:14] just may we enter in tonight and give
[37:19] you everything give you all the glory
[37:21] have a wonderful time and fellowship
[37:23] Lord I want to ask that everyone pray
[37:27] now together may they enter in may they
[37:30] may they ask the creator of this
[37:33] universe to supply your needs tonight
