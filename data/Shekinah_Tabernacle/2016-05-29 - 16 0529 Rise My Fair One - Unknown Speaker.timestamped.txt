[27:16] my fair one and come away for though the
[27:18] winter is passed the rain is over and
[27:20] gone the flowers appear on the earth the
[27:23] time of the singing of the birds has
[27:24] come and the voice of the turtle which
[27:27] is the turtle love has heard in our land
[27:29] the Fig Tree put forth her green figs
[27:31] and the vines with tender grape give a
[27:33] good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and
[27:36] come away oh my Dove Thou Art In The
[27:39] Cliffs of The Rock and the secret place
[27:41] of the stairs let me see thy countenance
[27:43] let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy
[27:46] voice and thy countenance is
[27:49] comely let's go to the Book of Micah
[27:51] chapter 7 and we'll just read a couple
[27:53] of verses there verses uh 7 and
[27:56] 8
[28:04] [Music]
[28:07] now notice we read in in song of um song
[28:10] of solom he says Rise up my love my fear
[28:12] one and come
[28:14] away he says here just as a bit of a
[28:17] context therefore I will look unto the
[28:19] Lord I'll wait for the god of my
[28:22] salvation my God will hear me Rejoice
[28:26] not against me oh my enemy me when I
[28:28] fall I shall arise when I sit in
[28:30] darkness the Lord shall be a light unto
[28:34] me amen let's just let's just pray again
[28:38] father Lord we've gathered Lord to not
[28:42] just see one another but to see you in
[28:44] your word father we know your word is
[28:46] not a newspaper or a textbook it takes
[28:48] your Divine Spirit to reveal it to us
[28:51] Lord and father we pray for the spirit
[28:53] of Revelation Lord that you would come
[28:56] illuminate us Lord that we may see yes
[28:58] Lord father may you anoint speaker and
[29:00] hearer now may you have Liberty Among Us
[29:02] and father may you be glorified in
[29:04] everything said and done Lord we just
[29:06] thank you and we love you in Jesus
[29:08] Christ's name amen am amen amen you may
[29:10] have your seats so I want to I want to
[29:13] continue on
[29:14] uh on our bit of a series here from Song
[29:18] of Solomon Chapter 2 but I want to take
[29:20] a I want to take the uh just just from
[29:24] there mic and also how he says in verse
[29:26] 10
[29:27] how my beloved spake he said unto me
[29:29] rise up my love my fair one and come
[29:32] away and then in Mich care he said
[29:34] Rejoice not against me oh my enemy when
[29:36] I fall I shall arise when I sit in
[29:39] darkness the Lord shall be a light unto
[29:41] me I'm sure we can agree that this age
[29:44] is the darkest age there ever has been
[29:46] amen amen we we truly have been born
[29:48] into a very dark age but it doesn't
[29:51] necessarily matter how dark the world is
[29:53] we just need to look at the light amen
[29:56] because whenever the enemy does
[29:57] something God always raises a standard
[29:59] that is greater than what the enemy can
[30:00] ever do that's right now this word
[30:03] Darkness it it figuratively means a
[30:05] misery a destruction death an ignorance
[30:07] a sorrow or a
[30:09] wickedness and so many times we we we
[30:14] are dwelling in that kind of State in a
[30:17] in a state of darkness and I could just
[30:18] say right from the offset we were born
[30:21] in this state we were born in a dark
[30:24] state but God God's will is that we
[30:26] would not stay in that state amen amen
[30:31] now the Bible I just want to lay a few
[30:33] comments down the Bible is the unfolding
[30:36] or revealing of God's Great Plan of
[30:38] Redemption now it starts out in the in
[30:42] the garden before the fall it starts out
[30:44] with a man and a woman who are actually
[30:46] two parts of one they're actually you
[30:49] know Eve only received her name after
[30:51] the fall she was still called man you
[30:53] know she was called woman because she
[30:54] came out of man but actually they were
[30:57] the the two of them we would look at
[30:59] them say they're two separate entities
[31:00] but they were one just in two bodies so
[31:04] it starts out with a man and a woman who
[31:05] are two parts to make a hole in a
[31:07] paradise called The Garden of Eden and
[31:10] they had dominion over the Earth God
[31:12] told them subdue it expand the garden
[31:14] you know you have dominion but then
[31:16] there was also the enemy and his
[31:18] instrument the serpent there and then we
[31:21] jump to the end of the Bible and there
[31:23] is a man which is Christ Jesus and there
[31:26] is a woman the bride of Christ and the
[31:28] two parts make the whole now there's
[31:30] also the foolish virgin the 144,000 and
[31:33] all those people as well but I want to
[31:34] major just on the on the on the bride
[31:37] and the bridegroom and there's also
[31:39] Paradise restored and there's a New
[31:41] Jerusalem that's at the end of the book
[31:43] but there is one one character that was
[31:45] at the beginning that's not at the end
[31:48] amen amen the enemy the enemy is not
[31:50] there I mean when you come to the end in
[31:52] the Book of Revelation the serpent is
[31:54] not there the devil's not there the
[31:56] Beast whatever he he tries to manifest
[31:58] himself and the enemy is not there amen
[32:01] he's not there anymore because your
[32:03] enemy is done away with and destroyed in
[32:05] the Lake of Fire your enemy has done
[32:07] away with now I'm sure you can we can
[32:09] all agree this is God's doing I mean
[32:12] this is definitely not the enemy's doing
[32:14] or even you're doing this it's God's
[32:16] doing and the devil for one cannot stop
[32:19] this happening amen hallelujah he reads
[32:21] the same word you read he listens to the
[32:24] same message you've received and he
[32:26] fights it and he sees how he can try and
[32:28] get around it but there's nothing can
[32:29] stop God's purpose amen there is nothing
[32:32] that will stop God putting his enemy
[32:35] into a lake of fire and then when that
[32:37] happens the Bible says all the saints
[32:38] said hallelujah amen and they rejoiced
[32:42] Hallelujah so man now so in the
[32:45] beginning man was God over the
[32:47] Earth but man fell from his position
[32:51] amen because Adam he he adjudicated the
[32:55] throne or left the throne in order to
[32:58] try and save his wife Eve and the
[33:00] scripture tells us in in 1 Timothy 2:14
[33:03] that Adam was not deceived but the woman
[33:06] being deceived was in the transgression
[33:08] So Adam knew what he was doing am mean
[33:10] Adam knew what he was doing but he knew
[33:12] that he couldn't lose part of himself
[33:15] Hallelujah that's why he willingly
[33:17] forfeited godship over the Earth Amen to
[33:20] save part of himself hey you know save
[33:23] save Eve and then what happened is the
[33:25] devil we we we know the devil filled
[33:28] that void and took man's place and
[33:30] that's why we have suffering that's why
[33:32] we have death that's why we have all
[33:33] this Darkness over the Earth is because
[33:36] man has fallen from his position and
[33:38] Satan is now the God of this world
[33:40] that's right it says in Ephesians 2 and
[33:43] two wherein in times past you walked
[33:46] according to the course of this world
[33:49] according to the prince of the power of
[33:50] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[33:52] the children of Disobedience amen so he
[33:55] is the prince of the power of the a he
[33:57] controls nature and that's why we have
[33:59] the destruction and all the famines and
[34:00] all these terrible things because the
[34:02] devil does it now I'm talking about so
[34:06] so my subject today is from there from
[34:08] Micah I will arise there's a people in
[34:11] this day that are rising to her position
[34:14] am mean there's a people that are
[34:16] there's a bride being lifted up in this
[34:18] end time that's why he says in Song of
[34:20] Solomon Arise My Fear One my love and
[34:22] come away so there has to be a rising I
[34:25] mean there has to be a people coming
[34:27] back to where she should have been in
[34:28] the beginning and we are living in that
[34:31] time we're living in a time where the
[34:32] bride is lifted up into her position in
[34:34] Christ and we're living in the time of
[34:36] the casting down of Satan hallelujah
[34:39] we're living in that time where Satan is
[34:40] cast down and the bride is lifted up
[34:43] amen
[34:44] hallelujah now I just want to tell you
[34:47] that cuz that's where I'm going if you
[34:49] why am I reading this is where I'm going
[34:51] amen so he is the prince of the power of
[34:53] the year amen and then even we we know
[34:56] when Jesus when he was tempted by Satan
[34:58] there you know Satan showed him all the
[35:00] kingdoms of the earth and he said I'll
[35:03] give this all to you he's saying them
[35:04] I'm I'm in control I'll give these all
[35:07] to you if you just Bow Down and Worship
[35:09] me and Jesus never said no you're not in
[35:11] control of them he actually acknowledged
[35:13] yeah you are in control he was he is God
[35:16] over the Earth but then Jesus said get
[35:19] thee hence Satan for it is written Thou
[35:21] shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him
[35:24] only shall thou serve now brother brah
[35:27] says in the future
[35:29] home he says here how can I be in the
[35:32] porn shop and out of the porn shop at
[35:34] the same time see he redeemed Us by his
[35:36] blood by his Spirit he cleansed us and
[35:39] then he comes to dwell in us the church
[35:40] not the denomination now the church
[35:43] notice close now as we take this the
[35:45] place we are to dwell in he says now now
[35:48] he's speaking of the Redemption of the
[35:49] earth now the andalu and repentance that
[35:52] brought forth water baptism then Christ
[35:54] came and shed his blood upon it to
[35:56] cleanse it and to claim it and then
[35:58] comes the next the destruction of the
[36:00] world as it is now all the sin that's in
[36:03] the heavens above he's the prince of the
[36:05] power of the earth speaking of Satan he
[36:07] keeps off Wards off the blessings from
[36:09] God and there comes Thunderbolts of
[36:12] lightnings and Strikes the Earth and
[36:14] everything from Heaven cheats of ice and
[36:17] rain and typhoon storms and everything
[36:19] comes from above which is Satan the
[36:21] prince of the power of the air that's
[36:23] why when the Lord Burns this place off
[36:25] with a Holy Fire he's got to he's got to
[36:28] burn off the ATM your atmospheres as
[36:30] well cuz that's where all the devils are
[36:32] that's where Satan operates from that
[36:34] realm amen but we understand that when
[36:37] the because we you know we understand
[36:40] that if there's to be a restoration of
[36:41] Eden and there's to be a restoration of
[36:44] the man and the woman then God has to
[36:46] through the scripture now show the
[36:49] redeemed man and then show the redeemed
[36:51] woman and brother BR speaks of the
[36:53] Masterpiece how Jesus Jesus was
[36:56] reflected down through the Old Testament
[36:58] and then finally the Masterpiece God
[37:00] what God had in his mind is the perfect
[37:02] man was standing in flesh and this and
[37:04] this the Apostle Paul says he is the
[37:06] second Adam so he began to demonstrate
[37:09] everything the first Adam did and then
[37:11] there came a time where where there was
[37:14] a there was a struggle now over nature
[37:17] and now the the Victor was going to
[37:19] prove who nature really belonged to and
[37:22] he was here was the creator in flesh and
[37:24] he was asleep on the boat you know when
[37:26] they cross ing the Sea of Galilee and
[37:28] the and the devil swore that that
[37:30] finally he had the chance I'm going to
[37:32] drown him and brother BR said 10,000
[37:34] Devils God into the water and whipped it
[37:36] up and caused the storm and because the
[37:39] devil thought I'm in control of nature I
[37:41] can do it I have the power but then but
[37:44] then they woke Jesus and the son of man
[37:47] stood up and just with a few words said
[37:49] peace be still and the creation
[37:51] recognize its creator Hallelujah that
[37:53] those Devils had to had to let go of
[37:56] what they trying to do because nature
[37:58] had to obey him because he made nature
[38:00] Hallelujah and that's what he was
[38:02] proving there who does nature really
[38:04] belong to and he's saying it belongs to
[38:06] me because it obeys my voice amen
[38:09] hallelujah amen and so now Jesus
[38:12] operated out of a realm of perfect Faith
[38:14] he knew who he was amen he knew he knew
[38:18] what the scripture said that he would do
[38:20] and he could out he could operate out of
[38:21] a realm of perfect Faith cuz he had
[38:23] confidence in who he was and the prophet
[38:26] tells him perfect faith if he can live
[38:28] that way you can sure live that way amen
[38:30] amen if you recognize what God has made
[38:32] you amen it doesn't matter if you're
[38:34] feeling happy sad or glad or whatever
[38:36] about it what has God Made You what does
[38:38] this message say you are Hallelujah you
[38:40] know the prophet says he says the devil
[38:42] cast a vote against me God for me it all
[38:45] depends where you cast your vote amen
[38:48] did you do you take what the devil says
[38:50] about you or do you take What God Says
[38:51] About You amen hallelujah I'd sure take
[38:54] What God Says About Me amen whatever you
[38:57] do take what he
[38:58] says and then so Jesus had power over
[39:01] nature he had power over sickness over
[39:04] death over everything cuz he was
[39:06] demonstrating what the first Adam lost
[39:08] was being manifested in the second Adam
[39:11] amen so a man a man in the first time
[39:14] came back to its rightful position but
[39:17] that was only the restoration of the man
[39:20] there has to be a restoration of the
[39:21] woman and brother Bram tells us in the
[39:25] masterpiece he says this he so there's
[39:28] an identified Masterpiece of God in yor
[39:31] he says you
[39:32] remember when they read in the day um uh
[39:36] that day in the book he just he read
[39:38] just part of the prophecy speak you know
[39:41] you know in Luke 4 how he takes Isaiah
[39:43] this day the scriptures fulfilled left
[39:45] the rest of it for the last days we are
[39:48] supposed to take that part you see he
[39:51] wants to cut the church out just like he
[39:53] did the man the the Sun out like like he
[39:56] did the bride and the groom to be his
[39:59] bride you must be part of him not part
[40:01] of creed not part of the church not part
[40:03] of the denomination but part of him
[40:06] hewed out hewed out of any other kind of
[40:09] a form won't work you've got to be hewed
[40:11] out from the word the world cut off of
[40:14] you and just leave the word only live in
[40:17] you the great sculptor is counting on
[40:20] you willing to stand and have yourself
[40:23] shaped into the likeness of his
[40:25] requirement that his word requires in
[40:28] the last days I'll pour my spirit out
[40:30] upon All Flesh your sons and daughters
[40:32] shall prophesy Christ is the identified
[40:36] Masterpiece of the word made flesh you
[40:38] are asked to identify yourself in him by
[40:41] the same word to be the Masterpiece for
[40:44] his bride now Brethren God had a
[40:46] masterpiece then to present to the world
[40:49] now he wants a masterpiece
[40:51] today amen so he's not just a he's not
[40:54] just pointing now Jesus is the
[40:56] Masterpiece he he now wants a bride to
[40:58] be the second part of the Masterpiece
[41:01] amen amen that everything the bride did
[41:03] I mean sorry the groom did the bride
[41:05] does the life that he lives she lives
[41:07] because she's part of him amen amen so
[41:10] he is now
[41:11] looking for a bride to come to her
[41:14] position hallelujah
[41:17] amen so
[41:19] now this is what he's looking for and if
[41:23] he's looking for it he's going to give
[41:25] the ability he's going to release his
[41:26] word in the season for the bride to come
[41:29] to her
[41:30] position now so because you know the
[41:34] enemy the enemy is you know the creation
[41:39] Now this now the second Eve there has to
[41:42] be a people that raise up back to their
[41:44] rightful position that rise up above
[41:47] this present world that rise up above
[41:49] the works of the enemy that rise up
[41:52] again above their first nature that they
[41:54] were born with amen that rise up above
[41:57] Creeds and dogmas of men that rise up
[41:59] above what other people think of them
[42:01] amen they take God God has preeminence
[42:03] over them in everything that they say
[42:05] and do Hallelujah there's are people
[42:07] that are called to rise up above this
[42:09] world and stand and walk Victorious and
[42:12] you might as well say it's me Lord here
[42:13] I am amen because if he if he has caused
[42:17] that to be he gives you the ability to
[42:19] do it amen I mean he doesn't put
[42:21] something in you impose it upon you now
[42:23] you got to be the bride you got to be
[42:24] the word you got to be perfect without
[42:26] first giving you what you need am mean
[42:29] because Grace is the imparted power upon
[42:32] a person to live the word that is the
[42:34] true grace of God than Lord hallelujah
[42:37] and we have friends we have what we need
[42:39] in this hour Amen to live the word to be
[42:42] the word amen am mean you already have
[42:44] in you remember you sat in darkness once
[42:46] upon a time I mean like the woman at the
[42:48] well she sat in darkness and she could
[42:51] have read Micah 7 say rejoice not
[42:53] against me my enemy amen I shall arise
[42:57] she didn't know what she was looking for
[42:59] but she knew there was something more to
[43:00] life than what she had amen she knew it
[43:03] was more than just well we know when
[43:05] Messiah cometh she wanted more than just
[43:06] a same and then the very son of man came
[43:09] to her revealed himself and mean the
[43:12] Lord lighted upon her Hallelujah and she
[43:15] and her eyes came open she knew this was
[43:17] more than a man this was more than a
[43:19] Prophet this is more than a Healing
[43:21] Ministry me but she was pulled by the
[43:23] very presence of God Amen Hallelujah and
[43:26] she never went back to her old life she
[43:29] could not live above amen she went from
[43:31] one man to the other looking for love in
[43:32] the wrong place she couldn't break that
[43:35] cycle Jesus broke the cycle amen Just
[43:38] Let Jesus Break the cycle this power and
[43:40] this message brother says end time
[43:43] message meets end time conditions amen
[43:45] so whatever we face out in the world
[43:47] this message meets the conditions amen
[43:49] hallelujah we don't need Psychology we
[43:51] don't need m in a bookstore amen we have
[43:54] what we need Hallelujah we have what we
[43:57] need in this world Amen it is what it is
[44:01] friends I wouldn't read Purpose Driven
[44:04] Life because he's joined the Catholic
[44:06] church amen he's yoked himself up that's
[44:09] right oh but he says good things the
[44:11] serpent said a lot of good things too
[44:13] but didn't make it true am amen so we
[44:17] have the ability now there's a people
[44:20] you know we think of the Rapture and we
[44:22] always think of the body change amen but
[44:25] that's just the end of the process
[44:26] that's right the Lord the Lord descends
[44:29] he does three things as he's as as he
[44:31] descends we know these things you know
[44:33] he descends with a shout of voice and a
[44:35] trumpet amen and the and the end of that
[44:37] process is the change in these bodies
[44:40] but there comes a time where you know
[44:43] the bride I'll just put it this way the
[44:45] bride is already raptured that's right
[44:48] because the Rapture means the catching
[44:49] away you've been caught up amen and the
[44:53] now this we're still in this flesh we're
[44:55] still looking for the change of in the
[44:56] body you understand amen but the bride
[44:58] has been caught up above this world
[45:01] that's why you go back you know the
[45:03] devil always likes to point you to the
[45:05] negative things you failed here you did
[45:07] this wrong here you always fight this
[45:09] thing and you failed hey Abraham Abraham
[45:12] and Sarah failed every month until 25
[45:16] years later then they received the child
[45:17] they failed every month they couldn't
[45:19] overcome it but God in his season
[45:22] Abraham didn't look at the symptoms he
[45:23] rejoiced in the promise meant to be the
[45:26] Sons and Daughters of Abraham according
[45:28] to the faith I can't overcome this just
[45:30] look at the promise hallelujah amen look
[45:32] at the promise don't look at what you
[45:34] maybe you perceive as a failure in you
[45:37] Hallelujah am amen and then so there
[45:41] comes a time where the where the bride
[45:43] now is lifted up and the things that you
[45:47] know you just take your own life you go
[45:49] back however many years before this
[45:50] message found you before the Lord
[45:52] lighted upon you before his word came
[45:55] across your your path you fought things
[45:58] and they beat you around and you
[46:00] couldn't overcome them and you were
[46:01] struggling and you just couldn't do it
[46:04] but then one day he came amen and he
[46:07] lifted you up thank you Lord amen you
[46:09] may you may you know it's not like he
[46:11] just flicks the switch and everything's
[46:12] just 100% you overcome some things he
[46:15] just takes you this from you like this
[46:17] other things you have to wrestle with
[46:19] cuz he wants you to be victorious amen
[46:22] but you must recognize the battle may be
[46:24] long but you have the power to to defeat
[46:27] it amen you have the
[46:30] power and so now he lifts you up because
[46:33] you know I you know I go back over many
[46:35] years 10 years I didn't recognize I came
[46:37] from God went back to God I just thought
[46:39] everything was here and now one day you
[46:42] lived in that kind of state and
[46:44] everything's here and now and dollars
[46:45] and cents and station and life and how
[46:48] many friends you have how much good time
[46:49] you have and whatever whatever religion
[46:52] you think you had but then one day he
[46:54] came amen and he lifted you up
[46:56] hallelujah hallelujah you're still in
[46:58] these bodies but your mind is you're
[47:00] totally different you know your soul is
[47:02] been lifted up yes sir Hallelujah and
[47:04] the life in you now governs your life
[47:06] and you think differently now you act
[47:08] differently now things that you once
[47:10] responded to in a certain way you
[47:12] respond a totally different way why is
[47:14] that because you've been lifted upen
[47:17] hallelujah you've been lifted up amen
[47:20] above things and you see things now for
[47:22] what they
[47:23] are amen the bride has already started
[47:27] to
[47:28] rise amen I'm just telling you now the
[47:31] bride has already started to rise the
[47:33] Rapture is for the raptured hallelujah
[47:35] amen if you've been caught away amen
[47:38] hallelujah if if the voice amen this end
[47:41] time message if the voice means more to
[47:43] you than life itself amen and you and
[47:46] just there's something in you Lord I
[47:47] love you I want to live to please you
[47:50] not that I could earn anything amen but
[47:52] but I want to please you you've been
[47:54] caught up amen
[47:56] Hallelujah it is what it is am amen amen
[48:00] so now the bride is starting to make her
[48:02] Ascension and then now the time when she
[48:05] starts to ascend is the time when Satan
[48:07] begins to be cast down
[48:10] hallelujah amen amen
[48:13] now there comes a
[48:16] time and I'll show you that this is the
[48:18] time
[48:21] amen now we read in Job chapter
[48:24] 1 there was the day when the sons of God
[48:27] came to present themselves before the
[48:28] Lord and Satan came also among them oh
[48:32] thank you brother
[48:34] apprciate so there was a time when Satan
[48:37] could go up before the Lord anytime he
[48:40] wanted to
[48:42] amen but then we come down into
[48:45] Revelations chap 4 and 5 and there's a
[48:48] totally different scene amen we
[48:50] understand that John is a symbol in the
[48:52] book and he's a symbol of you amen amen
[48:55] and then so now at the end of the lady
[48:57] of in church age Revelations 4:1 behold
[49:00] the door was open in heaven and the
[49:02] first voice which I heard as it were of
[49:04] a trumpet talking with me which said
[49:06] come up hither and I will show you these
[49:09] things which must be Hereafter so John
[49:12] is lifted up into an eternal realm at
[49:14] the end of the seventh Church age and
[49:17] John is a symbol of you amen and then so
[49:20] John is lifted up into the very throne
[49:22] room of God where Satan was allowed to
[49:25] go one upon a time but then there comes
[49:27] a scene now where the lamb steps forth
[49:30] and takes the book amen and then and
[49:33] then so I'm just I'm just doing an
[49:35] overview you can go read Revelations 4
[49:37] and 5 and then so John he sees the Lord
[49:40] sitting upon the throne he sees the 4
[49:43] and20 Elders he sees the germs and the
[49:46] angels and all the redeemed amen because
[49:49] the 4 and20
[49:51] Elders in part they do represent the
[49:54] redeemed because when he takes the book
[49:57] in in Revelations 5:9 they sung a new
[49:59] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[50:01] book and to open the seals
[50:04] therefore I'm sorry and when he had
[50:06] taken the book The Four beasts and the 4
[50:08] and 20 Idols fell down before the lamb
[50:10] having every one of them Harps and
[50:11] golden vials full of odors which are the
[50:13] prayers of saints and they sung a new
[50:16] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[50:18] book and to open the seals thereof for
[50:20] thou was slain and has redeemed us to
[50:23] God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[50:25] and tongue and people and nation and
[50:27] hath made us unto our God Kings and

[54:14] recognized this wasn't Moses is doing
[54:16] this wasn't his ambition or even their
[54:18] ambition that's what God's doing and
[54:20] then knew if God took them that far
[54:22] there to the Border he can take them all
[54:24] the way

[56:32] the script for me goes into eternity you
[56:34] have an End Amen
[56:36] Hallelujah now and the fifth angel
[56:39] sounded Revelations 9:1 and I saw a star
[56:42] fall from Heaven unto the Earth and to
[56:45] him was given the key of the bottomless
[56:47] pit now this is now notice this star
[56:50] fell this is Satan opening the
[56:53] bottomless pit which has already
[56:54] happened but he fell he didn't come down
[56:57] at his own choosing but he fell that's
[56:59] right amen he fell from his position in
[57:01] heaven and fell Hallelujah but then in
[57:05] Revelations 10:1 and we'll go into these
[57:07] things uh yeah we've already covered
[57:09] these things we'll go into it later and
[57:11] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[57:14] Hallelujah this one didn't fall this one
[57:17] didn't come down against his will you
[57:19] know when someone Falls when they're
[57:21] pushed the person pushing them you know
[57:23] they have no say they've been push
[57:25] they're falling that's right it's not
[57:27] they choosing they get pushed that's
[57:28] right but if someone comes down it's
[57:30] actually well they've chosen now I'm
[57:32] here that's now I've arrived I've chosen
[57:34] to do this now Hallelujah and I saw
[57:38] another Mighty Angel come down from
[57:39] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[57:41] rainbow upon his head and his face as it
[57:44] were uh as it were the Sun and his feet
[57:47] as pillows of fire and he had in his
[57:49] hand a little book open and he set his
[57:52] right foot upon the scene his left foot
[57:54] on the earth and he cried with a loud
[57:57] voice as it were a lion Roth and when he
[57:59] had cried seven Thunders uttered their
[58:03] voices I'll come back to that soon and
[58:05] when the seven Thunders had out their
[58:07] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[58:09] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[58:11] up those things which the seven Thunders
[58:13] uttered and write them not and the angel
[58:17] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[58:20] the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[58:22] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[58:24] ever
[58:25] who created heaven and the things that
[58:26] there in are and the earth and the
[58:29] things that there in are and the Sea and
[58:31] the things that there in are that time
[58:33] should be no longer but in the days of
[58:36] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[58:38] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[58:40] should be finished as he has declared to
[58:42] his servants the prophets now so this
[58:45] Angel swore by him that created all
[58:47] things this Angel is Christ amen amen
[58:51] this is Christ coming down and he
[58:53] created all things amen amen so he's
[58:55] swearing by
[58:57] himself amen that now is the time where
[59:01] there shall be that word no longer in my
[59:03] Marin actually he says there shall be no
[59:05] more
[59:06] delay so he's swearing by himself there
[59:09] shall be no more delay I'm going to wind
[59:11] up my Plan of Redemption Hallelujah I'm
[59:14] going to bring it into Satan's kingdom
[59:15] and his works now is the time where the
[59:18] Millennium is going to come in My bride
[59:20] is going to come to her position they
[59:22] shall arise this what he's swearing by
[59:24] himself I'm going to do it amen amen and
[59:27] then Paul when he speaks in Hebrews
[59:29] about Abraham he and he's speaking about
[59:32] God giving a promise to Abraham he said
[59:34] because he could swear by no greater he
[59:36] swore by himself and at the confirmation
[59:39] of an oath there ceases all Strife in
[59:43] Hebrews so when the oath is confirmed
[59:46] all all all Strife is over rest is there
[59:50] amen so when he comes to you and he
[59:54] confirm terms to you personally this is
[59:56] my doing I'm going to make you like me
[59:59] you're made in my image amen and he
[1:00:03] confirms that to you is rest amen cuz he
[1:00:06] swore by himself he's going to do it
[1:00:09] it's actually you're his workmanship I
[1:00:11] know we probably say that you know it's
[1:00:13] such a easy thing just to Rattle off you
[1:00:15] are his workmanship the work he started
[1:00:18] he will perfect is that not what he said
[1:00:21] amen so if you are his workmanship if he
[1:00:23] is swearing by himself you're going to
[1:00:25] be made in my image all the all the uh
[1:00:29] responsibility is upon him all you have
[1:00:32] to do is yield yourself to the word cuz
[1:00:34] he's a gentleman remember he doesn't
[1:00:36] force himself upon anyone you have to be
[1:00:38] willing to yield yourself just like he
[1:00:40] says in doors in a door the prophet says
[1:00:43] open the door in your heart let him come
[1:00:46] in and he'll do it amen amen you've got
[1:00:48] to open every door just yield yourself
[1:00:50] yes sir that's right hallelujah amen so
[1:00:53] he has sworn by by himself that this is
[1:00:55] the hour where these things are going to
[1:00:57] be amen and we and we know very well
[1:01:00] that Revelations 10 this has been
[1:01:02] fulfilled yes sir Amen brother Braham
[1:01:04] said that the seventh angel quoting the
[1:01:06] scripture he says the seventh angel is
[1:01:08] on the time of the year is on the earth
[1:01:10] at the time of that coming Revelations
[1:01:12] 10:1 so he's already
[1:01:14] descended in this form amen he's already
[1:01:17] sworn by himself time shall be no longer
[1:01:20] I'm going to wind up my Plan of
[1:01:21] Redemption I'm going to make you in my
[1:01:23] image amen amen hallelujah he sworn by
[1:01:26] himself he's going to do it yes sir amen
[1:01:30] but
[1:01:31] now so if this is so then the Ascension
[1:01:35] of the Bride As I said has already begun
[1:01:38] yep and the devil is being cast down
[1:01:42] Hallelujah where once the devil had
[1:01:45] control now he is falling from his
[1:01:48] position and the bride is ascending to
[1:01:50] her rightful position as God over the
[1:01:53] Earth amen that's why that's why you can
[1:01:56] have your home and it's like heaven amen
[1:01:59] the devil tries to come and you you cast
[1:02:01] them out he has to obey you amen there's
[1:02:04] sickness you pray Hallelujah and either
[1:02:08] God delivers you like this or he gives
[1:02:10] you the faith that you can just because
[1:02:13] sometimes remember if he just does it
[1:02:14] like this all the time where's the
[1:02:17] character being built I mean where
[1:02:19] because Faith worketh
[1:02:21] patience amen so if you really have
[1:02:24] faith however God replies you'll say
[1:02:26] praise the Lord amen hallelujah that
[1:02:29] doesn't mean you have unbelief Faith
[1:02:30] worketh
[1:02:31] patience sometimes sometimes it's like
[1:02:33] this sometimes got to bear it for a
[1:02:35] little bit brother Ram had the stomach
[1:02:37] Affliction about seven times then
[1:02:40] finally end of his ministry then the
[1:02:41] Lord healed him on the wings with Snow
[1:02:43] White Dove amen it doesn't mean he was
[1:02:45] an unbeliever when he had the stomach
[1:02:48] thing
[1:02:49] hallelujah amen so now is the time but
[1:02:53] you see now
[1:02:55] the these seven Thunders that Ed their
[1:02:59] voices that John was not allowed to
[1:03:00] write they were sealed up until the time
[1:03:02] of the
[1:03:03] end so there came a time and it's
[1:03:06] already happened where these Thunders
[1:03:09] have been made known to an end time
[1:03:12] people amen because now maybe I just got
[1:03:15] to jump back of but when I say the Lord
[1:03:17] you know when the Lord shall lighten
[1:03:19] upon me I shall
[1:03:20] arise when the word is made manifest its
[1:03:23] light yeah yeah when the word is made
[1:03:26] manifested as light so when the When
[1:03:29] when when when light shines upon you
[1:03:31] when the Lord lightens upon you opens
[1:03:34] your eyes that the eyes of your
[1:03:36] understanding come open it's through the
[1:03:37] word that he does it amen it's through
[1:03:40] the word that he opens the people's eyes
[1:03:43] it is through the word we have Revival
[1:03:45] it is through the word that people begin
[1:03:48] to recognize who they are it is through
[1:03:50] the word that these things happen so
[1:03:52] there has to be a time where the the
[1:03:56] mystery that's contained in these seven
[1:03:57] Thunders has been released that the
[1:04:01] people receive something they did not
[1:04:02] have at
[1:04:03] Pentecost amen and but God is not a god
[1:04:06] of subtraction he's a god of addition
[1:04:09] amen he built upon Luther's message of
[1:04:11] justification and Wesley came along he
[1:04:13] didn't take away justification he
[1:04:15] preached sanctification and then there's
[1:04:17] the restoration of the gifts it didn't
[1:04:18] do away with anything else it just added
[1:04:20] two and then now when Christ himself the
[1:04:22] word is revealed it doesn't take away
[1:04:24] any of the other it just
[1:04:26] adds amen so it's not a taking away it's
[1:04:29] an adding to amen but the word because
[1:04:33] there's power in the word amen if the
[1:04:36] word is received into a faith faithful
[1:04:39] heart as brother Tony said your attitude
[1:04:41] towards and me being here will will it
[1:04:44] either you'll be blessed or you won't be
[1:04:46] blessed you'll be changed or you won't
[1:04:48] be changed remember the soldiers put a
[1:04:51] put a thing over jesus' eyes beat him
[1:04:53] said if thou be a prophet tell us who
[1:04:54] hit you amen so they hit Jesus but the
[1:04:57] woman with the blood issue touched the
[1:04:59] same one and she was healed and those
[1:05:01] ones were damned and all depends upon
[1:05:03] your attitude towards the word amen amen
[1:05:08] so now if this is so now brother Bon
[1:05:11] preaching in the
[1:05:13] seals I think I
[1:05:15] said I think I said uh last Sunday when
[1:05:19] the seals were opening it was unfolding
[1:05:21] to the prophet amen that's right that
[1:05:24] was that that series of services and
[1:05:26] onwards that was a happening that was
[1:05:28] the lamb taking the book and opening the
[1:05:30] seals each night he opened another seal
[1:05:32] it was it was new to the prophet like it
[1:05:34] was to the people listening it was an
[1:05:36] event taking
[1:05:37] place and then so he says he says in the
[1:05:40] third
[1:05:42] seal he says in the third seal we have
[1:05:45] denominational revivals we haven't had a
[1:05:48] real stiring no no no no sir don't think
[1:05:52] we've got revivals we haven't we've got
[1:05:54] millions and millions and millions of
[1:05:56] church members but not a Revival nowhere
[1:05:59] that's funny cuz everyone thought they
[1:06:00] had Revival in that day the bride hasn't
[1:06:02] had a Revival yet see there's been no
[1:06:07] Revival there no manifestation of God to
[1:06:10] stir the bride yet see we're looking for
[1:06:13] it it will take those seven unknown
[1:06:15] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[1:06:19] he will send it he promised it it's in
[1:06:21] the third seal and then in recognizing
[1:06:24] in your day and its message in
[1:06:26] 64 thiss afterwards what time is it
[1:06:29] brother what time is it Minister do you
[1:06:32] see the time of day and the sign you're
[1:06:34] living
[1:06:36] under amen what sign are we living under
[1:06:38] the resurrection sign amen when when
[1:06:42] when God took and maybe I'll just jump
[1:06:44] back God took a redeemed son in this day
[1:06:47] he took a member of the bride and he
[1:06:49] stepped into that redeemed son and
[1:06:51] revealed himself and showed that a
[1:06:53] redeem son amen had dominion over nature
[1:06:57] amen had dominion over death Hallelujah
[1:06:59] every every every devil in hell had to
[1:07:02] bow to what that man said amen because
[1:07:05] he was demonstrating in one man this is
[1:07:07] where the bride is coming to he had
[1:07:09] perfect dominion over nature over
[1:07:11] sickness he created you know Jesus Took
[1:07:13] bread and multiplied it he took
[1:07:15] something and then he and then he
[1:07:16] changed into something else but now God
[1:07:18] took his bride and just spoke something
[1:07:21] out of nothing squirrels all kinds of
[1:07:24] just spoke it out of nothing am
[1:07:26] Hallelujah to prove that that creative
[1:07:29] powers of vindication of this word will
[1:07:31] create the bride into his very image
[1:07:34] amen but he had Dominion to prove that
[1:07:36] the bride the many membered body around
[1:07:38] the earth will have the same Dominion
[1:07:40] amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen
[1:07:44] that's the sign we're living under the
[1:07:45] resurrection sign I'm so glad we're
[1:07:48] alive today Hallelujah can you

[1:08:42] do that they want a Great Awakening and
[1:08:46] and a Revival is an Awakening they're
[1:08:48] crying believing that they there will be
[1:08:51] awakened they're good people what is it
[1:08:54] what have they done they have not
[1:08:55] recognized The Awakening of the Bride
[1:08:57] Sea by doing by being a Christian they
[1:09:00] feel the pull of the hour but they
[1:09:02] haven't recognized what's been done
[1:09:05] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:09:07] they know something's supposed to happen
[1:09:09] see but they're looking for it way off
[1:09:12] in the future to come when it's already
[1:09:15] happened right by you remember he says
[1:09:18] it will take the seven Thunders to stir
[1:09:20] the bride and he says and recognize you
[1:09:22] day this message already happened they
[1:09:25] have missed the Awakening of the Bride
[1:09:28] why has this why has this message opened
[1:09:30] your eyes because it opens the eyes of
[1:09:33] the Bride amen hallelujah if it has
[1:09:37] opened your eyes and you couldn't leave
[1:09:39] it if you wanted to amen it means you're
[1:09:42] one of them amen amen look at the effect
[1:09:46] of the word in your life that's all you
[1:09:48] need to do the devil will show you
[1:09:49] you're a failure he only shows you
[1:09:51] negative he doesn't show you that you
[1:09:53] now you're an overcomer more than you
[1:09:55] were Hallelujah as you're growing to the
[1:09:58] very fullness and stature of Christ amen
[1:10:01] like a baby I would never give Gabriel
[1:10:04] the keys to go to the store buy some
[1:10:05] milk and come home she can't do it amen
[1:10:09] oh that's ridiculous but then some
[1:10:11] people look at themselves and say why
[1:10:12] can I not overcome these things maybe
[1:10:14] you're still in diapers that's not a bad
[1:10:17] thing as long as life is growing amen I
[1:10:21] don't I don't I don't give Gabriel a you
[1:10:24] a good box law because I don't give her
[1:10:25] a box law but you know I don't give her
[1:10:27] a smack because she falls
[1:10:29] over amen she's a baby but my life is in
[1:10:33] her Hallelujah and she's growing more
[1:10:36] and more maturing every day
[1:10:39] Hallelujah few months ago she couldn't
[1:10:41] even walk and now she can walk amen
[1:10:44] hallelujah and just so just look at your
[1:10:46] life what is happening to me go back a
[1:10:49] year well I was you know this part of me
[1:10:51] you know yeah I wasn't walking with God
[1:10:54] like I thought I could and look at you
[1:10:56] now what's happening there's life as
[1:10:59] long as there's life in the body growing
[1:11:02] that is the main thing look at that the
[1:11:04] devil never point you to that Hallelujah
[1:11:08] he'll never point you to the good things
[1:11:09] he points you to the bad yes but just
[1:11:11] look what has this word done to me
[1:11:14] that's what has it done has it
[1:11:15] transformed me has it Chang me from the
[1:11:18] person I want I'm not that person that
[1:11:20] person I don't even know that person I
[1:11:22] don't think like that person I don't act
[1:11:24] like that person may be minute as long
[1:11:27] as there's life in the
[1:11:29] body hallelujah look at what the word is
[1:11:32] doing to you because only God can do it
[1:11:35] to
[1:11:36] you amen hallelujah now a direct
[1:11:40] question questions answer
[1:11:42] 64 have the seven Thunders which equals
[1:11:45] the seven Mysteries already been
[1:11:46] revealed were they revealed in the Seven
[1:11:49] Seals but are yet but are yet not known
[1:11:52] to us as the seven Thunders yet that's
[1:11:54] the question answer no they were
[1:11:56] revealed in the Seven Seals that's what
[1:11:59] the Thunders was
[1:12:01] about Hallelujah that's right they was
[1:12:04] to reveal the seven Thunders had Ed
[1:12:05] their voices and no one could make out
[1:12:08] what it was John knew what it was but he
[1:12:10] was forbidden to write it he said but
[1:12:11] the seventh angel in the days of his
[1:12:13] sounding the seven Mysteries of the
[1:12:15] seven Thunders would be revealed and the
[1:12:18] seventh angel is the messenger to the
[1:12:20] seventh Church age which is the prophet
[1:12:24] so he's saying the seven Thunders that's
[1:12:26] what the Seven Seals were about
[1:12:28] Hallelujah so a power has been you I
[1:12:31] read all those things to show a power
[1:12:33] has been released to awaken the bride
[1:12:36] Hallelujah and if you have been awakened
[1:12:39] by this word what has happened you're
[1:12:42] arising amen you're ascending to your
[1:12:44] rightful position in him and it's his
[1:12:46] doing amen it's not you're doing amen
[1:12:50] hallelujah
[1:12:52] now I I think I've mentioned this many
[1:12:54] times but we understand when brother
[1:12:55] Baron preaches the Rapture message he
[1:12:58] goes to psalms 27 as his opening text
[1:13:02] because to me that
[1:13:04] Psalm shows the condition of the
[1:13:06] believer that's ready for the Rapture
[1:13:09] amen and
[1:13:11] so this this Psalm it speaks about the
[1:13:14] Lord is my light and my salvation of
[1:13:16] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[1:13:18] strength of my life and whom shall I be
[1:13:20] afraid when the wicked even my enemies
[1:13:23] might foes come upon me and eat up my
[1:13:25] flesh they stumbled and fell though host
[1:13:27] should encamp against me my heart shall
[1:13:29] not fear though War should rise against
[1:13:32] me in this will I be confident one thing
[1:13:35] I've desired of the Lord that I will
[1:13:37] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:13:38] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:13:41] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:13:42] inquire in his Temple for in the time of
[1:13:45] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[1:13:47] and the secret of his Tabernacle shall
[1:13:49] he hide me and he shall set me up upon a
[1:13:52] rock now if God has Quicken this word to
[1:13:55] you you cannot deny it you could not you
[1:13:58] you could not go become a Catholic or
[1:14:01] Pentecostal or what you cannot deny it
[1:14:04] because he set your feet upon a rock and
[1:14:06] it doesn't matter about all the
[1:14:08] arguments you know all the intellectual
[1:14:10] arguments on the internet when you hear
[1:14:12] the voice you know one guy said that the
[1:14:14] mystery of um um some guy in Nigeria
[1:14:18] can't remember his name uh TB Joshua he
[1:14:21] said the ministry of TB Joshua eclipses
[1:14:23] out of brother
[1:14:25] brandham okay that that's strong words
[1:14:27] because you know what eclipse means it
[1:14:28] just totally you it's totally greater
[1:14:30] okay so we go watch him in his prayer
[1:14:33] lines and then we watch that and then we
[1:14:36] watch the end of the deep course of the
[1:14:38] deep amen it's a totally different
[1:14:42] thing and when you watch when you watch
[1:14:44] the Deep call the Deep there just a
[1:14:46] presence comes into the room Hallelujah
[1:14:50] and you see one is scripture one is not
[1:14:53] yes amen so how can how can someone say
[1:14:56] no this is greater than this it's not
[1:15:00] amen but but sadly I could say if
[1:15:02] someone turns that way they're not their
[1:15:04] feet is not upon a rock yet amen but if
[1:15:07] your feet are upon that rock nothing can
[1:15:10] talk you out of it nothing can persuade
[1:15:13] you why did the Christians give their
[1:15:14] lives the little light they had in the
[1:15:16] Dark Ages amen and they could be burned
[1:15:20] they just gave themselves they rejoiced
[1:15:21] about it why cuz their feet were upon a
[1:15:24] rock hallelujah how much more the bride
[1:15:27] of Christ in this day when Jesus fully
[1:15:29] revealed himself am
[1:15:33] hallelujah amen
[1:15:35] now and now shall my head be lifted up
[1:15:38] above my enemies round about me
[1:15:40] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:15:42] sacrifices of Joy I'll sing I'll sing
[1:15:45] praises unto the Lord amen but then now
[1:15:49] you read these
[1:15:51] things and you say well well I just keep
[1:15:53] falling and stumbling I must not be in
[1:15:56] Rapture condition remember when the
[1:15:58] enemy came against me when the wickedy
[1:16:00] of my enemies my foes Came Upon me eat
[1:16:02] up my flesh they stumbled and fell not
[1:16:04] you you you didn't stumble and fall they
[1:16:06] stumbled and fell Hallelujah so you know
[1:16:10] the Devil comes along and says well you
[1:16:12] keep falling and stumbling you must not
[1:16:14] be in Rapture condition so therefore
[1:16:16] you're not one of the
[1:16:18] Bride amen that's what he always goes He
[1:16:21] the devil always goes to your
[1:16:24] identification amen that's right he
[1:16:26] never says you're not a Christian he
[1:16:27] says you're just not one of the Bride
[1:16:29] you're not going in the Rapture and he
[1:16:31] comes and says that to you cuz that's
[1:16:33] the one thing you want in life is to go
[1:16:34] on the
[1:16:35] Rapture hallelujah amen now you got to
[1:16:40] get that out of your
[1:16:41] thinking amen you're looking at the
[1:16:43] wrong thing the devil always point you
[1:16:45] to the negative and not what God has
[1:16:47] done for you already now I've already
[1:16:49] said these things I'm just going to
[1:16:50] repeat it look where he has taken you
[1:16:52] from already whose life has been changed
[1:16:55] amen who has started to rise Hallelujah
[1:16:58] doesn't matter what church you grew up
[1:17:00] in what churches you went to when this
[1:17:02] message came your way things happened I
[1:17:05] mean you begin to rise above above the
[1:17:07] world now if he has brought you this far
[1:17:10] can he not take you the rest of the way
[1:17:12] amen can he not do it am mean Caleb and
[1:17:15] Joshua they could have said that at cish
[1:17:17] by near God brought us this far can't we
[1:17:19] go the rest of the way hallelujah amen
[1:17:23] look what he's taken you see can't you
[1:17:25] have confidence that he'll take you the
[1:17:27] rest of the way now Israel left Egypt
[1:17:30] under the blood of the Lamb did they not
[1:17:32] I mean eating the lamb and the unle
[1:17:34] bread and it gave them the strength they
[1:17:36] needed to go all the way into the
[1:17:38] promised land Caleb said I was I'm as
[1:17:41] strong now as I was when I came out amen
[1:17:43] because he came out under the blood of
[1:17:45] the Lamb Hallelujah so all you need to

[1:18:01] the word this word is is is the
[1:18:04] transforming power of God that's been
[1:18:06] released upon the Earth sir as I said

[1:18:12] in brother br's Ministry you know the
[1:18:14] manifestations of the third pole that
[1:18:16] was a Vindication what he is speaking is
[1:18:19] is creative power it's not a Healing
[1:18:22] Ministry it's not even well I understand
[1:18:24] the Bible amen but of course the word
[1:18:26] has become over but there's creative
[1:18:27] power in the message to transform you
[1:18:30] and what you were into a very son and
[1:18:32] daughter of God amen amen that he would
[1:18:34] take because remember there's seed upon
[1:18:35] the Earth but light had to shine Amen in
[1:18:39] Genesis there was Darkness over it you
[1:18:42] sat in darkness amen but then God pushed
[1:18:45] back the darkness Hallelujah he said let
[1:18:47] there be light and then the water was
[1:18:48] separated then the Earth then the light
[1:18:51] struck the Earth warmed it up then the
[1:18:53] seed came forth hallelujah what it's
[1:18:55] meant to be and that's what's happened
[1:18:56] to you and I I me we were in darkness
[1:19:00] they said when the Lord lights upon me I
[1:19:01] shall arise Hallelujah and that's what
[1:19:04] we're doing and don't put it off don't
[1:19:06] put it off in the future someplace don't

[1:19:18] just because they had to evacuate dun
[1:19:20] Kirk and they lost the continent all
[1:19:21] these things the Allies didn't quit
[1:19:23] that's right amen of course they
[1:19:25] wouldn't quit they're still fighting but
[1:19:27] then some Christians say well I can't
[1:19:28] win and the enemy is expanding and I and
[1:19:31] then they just kind of want to throw up
[1:19:32] a white flag don't throw up a white flag

[1:20:14] day and he saw men being women being
[1:20:17] sold as slaves and he said I'll I'll hit
[1:20:20] this thing even if it cost me my life
[1:20:22] there's an ambition in him I want to end
[1:20:24] this man should not be in slavery
[1:20:27] anymore and it doesn't matter how many
[1:20:29] defeats he had the Civil War wasn't
[1:20:31] looking too good for the north even
[1:20:32] though it wasn't all about slavery but
[1:20:34] you understand it wasn't looking too
[1:20:35] good initially but there's something in
[1:20:37] them we're going to win this war there's
[1:20:39] enough gumption in them we're going to
[1:20:41] keep fighting Hallelujah if that's just

[1:25:12] things a voice of shout a trumpet has to
[1:25:15] happen before Jesus appears now let
[1:25:17] physically remember now shout Jesus does
[1:25:19] all them all three of them when he's
[1:25:21] descending a what is a shout it's the
[1:25:24] message going forth first the living

[1:25:29] bride he doesn't just say these things
[1:25:31] are they flower Isn't that cool no the

[1:26:00] Bible

[1:26:05] pits did they not they're all
[1:26:07] slaves but there were a couple of them
[1:26:12] that Rose above the slave mentality so
[1:26:15] that's why I've been pondering this for
[1:26:17] a
[1:26:17] while ask this question you may have
[1:26:20] come out of Egypt but has Egypt come out
[1:26:23] of you right amen right and I'm not just

[1:27:09] been risen up above all why don't we do
[1:27:12] like what the world does we're have a
[1:27:14] different Spirit we're of a different
[1:27:17] nature and it's not your your desire
[1:27:19] that made you that way it's ultimately
[1:27:20] God's desire he has put the desire in
[1:27:23] you to respond to
[1:27:24] him hallelujah thank you Jesus amen so
[1:27:28] we it is God's doing I'm just going to

[1:27:35] doing that the bride is
[1:27:38] rising Hallelujah and if it is God's
[1:27:41] doing that's why I said I said
[1:27:42] ultimately it's God's doing but we're
[1:27:45] living in an hour of the Ascension of
[1:27:47] the Bride now the devil hasn't become
[1:27:49] incarnate yet but he he has fallen
[1:27:52] amen amen because it says it says in it
[1:27:55] says in wait let's just read that
[1:27:56] Revelations chap 12 I had it on my notes

[1:28:00] there Revelations 12 and: 7 now he
[1:28:03] called the accuser of the
[1:28:05] Brethren amen but there comes a time
[1:28:08] when he's cast down as I've said and
[1:28:11] there was war in heaven this is
[1:28:13] Revelations 12:7 there was war in heaven
[1:28:16] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:28:17] the dragon and the dragon fought in his

[1:28:30] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:28:32] out into the Earth and his angels were

[1:28:36] voice saying in heaven now has come
[1:28:38] salvation and strength in the Kingdom of
[1:28:40] our God and the power of His Christ for
[1:28:42] the accuser of our Brethren is cast down
[1:28:45] which accuses them before our God day
[1:28:47] and night he has no right to accuse
[1:28:49] anymore and they overcame him this is Is
[1:28:52] You by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:28:54] word of their testimony and they love
[1:28:56] not their lives until the death
[1:28:58] therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that
