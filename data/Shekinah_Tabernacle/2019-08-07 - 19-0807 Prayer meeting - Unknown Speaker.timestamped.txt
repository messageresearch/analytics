[22:44] let's dance shall we just just want to
[22:47] take a short thought from Acts chapter
[22:50] 16 we're gonna read from from verse 16
[22:58] of x16 X chapter 16 verse 16 that came
[23:12] to pass and it came to pass as we went
[23:18] to prayer are certain damsels to
[23:19] speaking about Paul and Silas as we went
[23:22] to prayer a certain damsel possessed
[23:24] with a spirit of the divination met us
[23:28] which brought her masters much gained by
[23:31] sue saying the same followed Paul and us
[23:35] and cried saying these men are the
[23:37] servants of the Most High God which show
[23:39] unto us the way of salvation and this
[23:41] thirty many days but Paul being grief
[23:44] turned and said to the spirit I command
[23:45] thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come
[23:48] out of her and he went out the same hour
[23:50] and when her master saw that the hope of
[23:53] their gains was gone
[23:54] they caught Paul and Silas and drew them
[23:57] into the marketplace unto the rulers and
[23:59] brought them to the magistrates saying
[24:01] these men being Jews do exceedingly
[24:04] trouble our city and teach customs which
[24:08] are not lawful for us to receive neither
[24:10] to observe being Romans and the
[24:13] multitude rose up together against them
[24:15] and the magistrates rent off their
[24:17] clothes and commanded to beat them and
[24:20] when they had laid many stripes upon
[24:22] them they cast him into prison charging
[24:25] the jailer to keep them safely who
[24:28] having received such a charge thrust
[24:30] them into the inner prison and made
[24:32] their feet fast in the stocks and at
[24:35] midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang
[24:38] praises unto God and the prisoners heard
[24:41] them and suddenly there was a great
[24:43] earthquake
[24:44] so that the foundations of the prison
[24:46] were shaken and immediately notice now
[24:49] all the doors were opened and everyone's
[24:52] bands were loosed amen this bow heads in
[24:57] a word of Prayer gracious father thank
[25:00] you we can take every burden to you and
[25:01] prayer
[25:02] thank you we can see it our wings to the
[25:05] winds of faith thank you Lord you are
[25:07] the same yesterday today and forever and
[25:09] dear God just pray fathers we have this
[25:11] prayer service Lord may you come and
[25:13] take control Lord we are failures to
[25:16] begin with but Lord with you all things
[25:18] are possible father you're more than a
[25:19] conqueror Lord Lord and I just pray
[25:22] father you just come and take control of
[25:23] the service media every need hear those
[25:26] Lord who may be streaming in as well
[25:28] father's want to commit our lives into
[25:30] your hands may you forgive us of our
[25:32] sins our trespasses Lord our iniquities
[25:34] dear God and maybe just be all covered
[25:36] in your blood this night grant it father
[25:38] and not just tonight but Lord every day
[25:40] until we take a body change granted in
[25:43] Jesus Christ's name we ask
[25:44] amen amen god bless you friends you may
[25:47] have your seat so I want to talk about
[25:49] here where notice how Paul and Silas you
[25:56] know they they came to a point where
[25:59] they are in prison and many of us find
[26:04] ourselves in places where we don't want
[26:05] to be where they were once your they
[26:08] were having great great campaign and you
[26:10] know they just seen a demon cast out of
[26:12] a girl that was bound by it and you know
[26:14] the response they got wasn't exactly the
[26:16] one maybe they are looking for they
[26:17] ended up in prison and you know and and
[26:20] in the inner prison they're feeding
[26:21] stocks they're just being beaten you
[26:23] know and and we know that many times the
[26:25] world Lee yo we end up in a prison we
[26:29] end up in a prison of circumstance we
[26:31] ended up a prison in our mind with a
[26:32] mind battle law you know the devil just
[26:35] comes against us or her and humanity
[26:37] comes against us or something comes
[26:38] against us we find ourselves in a prison
[26:40] but notice that you know Paul and Silas
[26:44] they look beyond their physical
[26:46] circumstance and they prayed and sang
[26:49] praise under God and the result of us we
[26:53] know was the earthquake and all the
[26:55] doors were open and everyone's bands
[26:56] were loosed Oh No
[26:58] how powerful a believer is where we can
[27:01] go beyond our current state our physical
[27:03] state and we can begin to worship and
[27:05] pray and give praises to our God and it
[27:08] not only sets us free but it can set
[27:11] free everyone that's around us
[27:14] hallelujah brother Branham says in the
[27:16] sermon love he says now I want you to
[27:18] ask you something
[27:19] let's let our colors down just a minute
[27:21] did you ever see a person that's a good
[27:24] person you think they are nice but
[27:26] they're just something about the person
[27:27] you just don't like to be around them
[27:29] certainly you do and then you've seen
[27:31] people you just love to be around what
[27:33] is it it's that creative power that's
[27:35] upon the people that creates an
[27:37] atmosphere around them where they're at
[27:39] if they're full of love not make-belief
[27:41] but real love you can feel it you know
[27:44] that they're Christians they shake their
[27:46] hand they say you're my friend John you
[27:48] can feel it I mean because all of us
[27:50] have an atmosphere around us it can
[27:52] either be a very good atmosphere a very
[27:54] bad atmosphere everyone creates an
[27:56] atmosphere I mean we are miniature gods
[27:58] upon the earth it doesn't matter if
[27:59] you're saved or not saved amen but you
[28:01] know you know all of us create an
[28:03] atmosphere so it depends what kind of
[28:06] atmosphere you want to create and I'll
[28:08] say to create an atmosphere it's not
[28:10] turning over a new leaf it's not seven
[28:11] steps to become a better Christian but
[28:13] it's a life and you produces an
[28:15] atmosphere I mean so it's not something
[28:18] you can do in your own ability I mean
[28:20] but it's God's life and you will create
[28:22] the atmosphere or a spirit will create
[28:24] an atmosphere we all create an
[28:25] atmosphere I mean he says he says in the
[28:28] same sermon love he says he no different
[28:31] I believe in heartfelt religion I
[28:32] believe you can feel it that God gives
[28:35] you something inside of you that changes
[28:37] you it makes the atmosphere around you
[28:39] different I've tried it I know is it
[28:42] true that man created himself the
[28:44] atmosphere that he lives in and around
[28:46] you he's anointed with a spirit and I've
[28:48] seen people that you just couldn't get
[28:50] away from him you just loved him there's
[28:52] something drawing about them it's
[28:54] because they live in that atmosphere
[28:56] they live under the power of the Holy
[28:58] Ghost I mean so this so as yo so as I
[29:02] see there's a massive difference between
[29:04] trying to do better and crane atmosphere
[29:06] and really dying out and letting God
[29:09] coming in and creating atmosphere
[29:11] around you it's not mind over matter
[29:13] Amen brother Brahim speaks about the
[29:15] token he says apply it create that
[29:17] atmosphere around you that they'll just
[29:19] drop right into it see oh you are you
[29:21] are if you've got the token you create a
[29:24] spirit around you a power that when you
[29:26] walk people know that you're a Christian
[29:28] they love for you to say something to
[29:31] them they believe your word what you say
[29:32] they hold on to let's see that's it
[29:34] apply the token then walk with it claim
[29:37] your household you must do it now it's
[29:39] the evening time now we've been
[29:40] listening a long time but this is the
[29:42] evening time it's the applying time now
[29:44] the wrath will strike one of these days
[29:46] it might be too late then apply the
[29:48] token with confidence he says so he's
[29:51] saying here that the the token if you
[29:52] have the Holy Ghost there's a spirit
[29:54] there's a power around you I mean
[29:56] there's an atmosphere that is created by
[29:58] the life of God himself now here we have
[30:01] two two believers here in a prison
[30:03] there's other people in the prison maybe
[30:05] they brought before the same magistrates
[30:07] maybe they had the same experience in
[30:09] life you know they went to the same
[30:11] judgment hall you know there's nothing
[30:13] that happens to us which is common or
[30:15] uncommon to man the same thing has
[30:17] happened to us the same thing here
[30:19] things happen to the people in the world
[30:20] you know because we're all humans are
[30:22] the same presence I mean that anyone can
[30:25] end up and we can end up in as well you
[30:27] know the circumstance of life but it's
[30:29] up to you but the thing is the believer
[30:31] is different because the believer does
[30:34] not succumb amen to the prison that
[30:36] they're in the circumstance around but
[30:38] there's something in and that knows this
[30:39] is not my final destination I mean the
[30:43] Apostle Paul knew that prison was not
[30:45] his final destination he the angel of
[30:48] God came to him and said Paul you're
[30:50] going to be a witness to me in Rome
[30:52] hallelujah
[30:53] so when Paul was in that prison he knew
[30:55] this is not where that that was not his
[30:57] final resting place he knew he had to go
[31:00] to Rome hallelujah and it's the same
[31:02] thing with us friends yo God God met the
[31:05] Apostle Paul I'm in the same God that
[31:07] meet him on the road to Damascus was the
[31:09] same God that says you're gonna be a
[31:10] witness to be in Rome I trusted the same
[31:12] God that met you whenever it was as the
[31:14] same God that walks with you and the
[31:16] same God that told you you're going to
[31:18] take a body change you're going to go in
[31:19] a rapture I'm in your final destination
[31:21] friends is not the current state you
[31:24] find yourself an this is not your final
[31:27] resting place I mean but you have a
[31:29] predestinated moment I mean where your
[31:31] body's going to be changed hallelujah
[31:34] but I trust that that is more real I
[31:36] mean then your current prison you find
[31:38] yourself in hallelujah cause Paul
[31:40] realized nah I'm under a commission I'm
[31:43] going to be a witness in Rome I mean so
[31:45] therefore he could praise God hallelujah
[31:48] he could give glory Lord thank you you
[31:50] brought me to this place there's a
[31:52] reason you brought me here Lord
[31:53] hallelujah yeah it says that they prayed
[31:56] and they sing and they and they sing
[32:00] songs
[32:02] hallelujah they prayed and saying
[32:04] praises unto God now you know maybe
[32:06] maybe they saying Psalm 18 rude saying
[32:10] my distress I called upon the Lord and
[32:11] cried unto my god he heard my voice out
[32:14] of his temple and my cry came before him
[32:17] even unto his ears in the earth shook
[32:18] and trembled the foundations also of the
[32:21] hills moved and was shaken because he
[32:23] was wroth or maybe they were singing
[32:25] Psalms 104 31 the glory I'm challenged
[32:29] or forever the Lord shall rejoice and
[32:32] his works he looketh on the earth and it
[32:34] trembler he touches the hills and they
[32:36] smoke I will sing unto the Lord as long
[32:39] as I live I will sing praise to my god
[32:40] while I have my being my meditation of
[32:43] him shall be sweet I will be glad in the
[32:45] Lord hallelujah maybe they begin to sing
[32:48] those things I don't know but they begin
[32:49] to praise they begin to realize this is
[32:52] not their final resting place and I
[32:53] trust it's the same thing with you I
[32:55] mean that you can you know yeah there
[32:57] should be something anchored in your
[32:58] soul your current trial that urine
[33:01] hallelujah they are in the inner prison
[33:03] there their feet were in stocks they
[33:05] fill felt the effects of the beatings
[33:08] and the whippings amen
[33:09] that salt was very real still hallelujah
[33:12] but something in them said I'm not going
[33:14] to end up here and they begin to praise
[33:16] God and sing and pray unto Him and God
[33:18] came down and shook the place but not
[33:20] only loose them but loose everyone
[33:22] around them I mean that's why we haven't
[33:24] there's a power in the believer I mean
[33:27] to bring deliverance hallelujah that
[33:28] when we really worship God I mean when
[33:31] we enter into that channel and give them
[33:32] praise because I have eternal life it
[33:35] should give me something to be happy
[33:36] about I mean
[33:37] delivered from the jaws of the devil I
[33:39] mean God has revealed this message to me
[33:41] hallelujah I mean I'm on a rapture
[33:43] highway hallelujah holy isn't he good
[33:46] they mean so you know you know that's
[33:48] something to praise him for thank you
[33:50] for finding me seven billion whatever
[33:52] people on the earth and we're on the
[33:54] back into the world here and God finds
[33:57] me hallelujah isn't that wonderful
[34:00] power and they begin to praise and see
[34:03] that's why we got to recognize his power
[34:06] and praise I mean so it doesn't matter
[34:08] how you feeling when you walk in those
[34:09] doors you got to put that to one side
[34:11] you've got to put that to one side and
[34:13] praise You God I mean because your
[34:15] salvation isn't you know this salvation
[34:17] wasn't based on how they are feeling I
[34:19] mean they're their salvation wasn't
[34:21] based on the beatings that they had
[34:23] received I mean they were rejoicing
[34:24] because they had met God and that's what
[34:27] made the difference they met the God of
[34:29] the Bible hallelujah and they begin to
[34:31] rejoice amen and it didn't just lose
[34:33] them but it loose to all them around
[34:34] just imagine I mean that that any one of
[34:37] us could walk in these doors and we
[34:40] could have a revival in our seat
[34:41] hallelujah and maybe others maybe had
[34:44] the worst week they've ever had in their
[34:45] lives but God comes down through your
[34:48] worship and looses their bands as well
[34:50] holy and we all go free out of this
[34:52] place
[34:53] hallelujah at work there you know the
[34:57] others didn't have a clue who are these
[34:59] people talking about of Jesus who are
[35:02] these crazy fanatics you know but they
[35:04] saw the power and effect of their
[35:06] worship and they felt the power and
[35:09] effect of their worship
[35:10] maybe they'd been in maybe some of them
[35:11] been in cells many days they never heard
[35:14] this kind of cry out of a cell
[35:15] hallelujah never never felt an
[35:17] earthquake and all the doors and
[35:18] everything be loosed Amen so it's the
[35:20] same thing with us it's great power you
[35:25] carry a great power but you got to put
[35:27] it in action say Oh God
[35:29] Here I am you shed your blood upon the
[35:32] earth for me I am redeemed you've taken
[35:34] the book hallelujah hallelujah I know
[35:36] and whom I have believed I don't believe
[35:38] in a figment of my imagination but
[35:40] you're a true and living God and you
[35:41] make me make yourself real to me and
[35:43] Here I am my final destination is not
[35:46] this trough we've got to go beyond our
[35:47] mind metals I mean we're going to change
[35:50] God change my
[35:51] thinking many times we get stuck in a
[35:53] dungeon in our mind and we're just going
[35:54] around the same cycle of Oh your
[35:57] negative thoughts and negative history
[35:59] and negative things God's going to break
[36:01] that you say Lord why am I thinking this
[36:03] way hallelujah amen
[36:07] the Lord said they that keep their mind
[36:11] stayed on him will have perfect peace
[36:13] amen so if your mind is full of trouble
[36:16] I'll guarantee you one thing your mind
[36:18] is probably not stuck on the Lord but
[36:20] this is if your mind erste don't hum you
[36:22] have perfect peace hallelujah so you
[36:25] know why do we keep a prison in our mind
[36:27] when we break that cycle what do we
[36:29] break that cycle well you say well I
[36:31] wasn't there when Paul and Silas was you
[36:34] know there and everything was loosed a
[36:35] mean but the same God is present we know
[36:37] the same one here I mean why don't we
[36:39] just begin to praise them irrespective
[36:41] of how we are irrespective of how we're
[36:43] feeling irrespective of what we're going
[36:45] through what we may face tomorrow why
[36:48] not
[36:49] hallelujah there's a challenge I mean
[36:53] well I'm feeling pretty awful they felt
[36:55] pretty awful I'm having a bad day they
[36:58] had a real bad day hallelujah but God
[37:02] said to Paul no you have to be a witness
[37:04] in row so he thought no God told me to
[37:07] be a witness from I can't say and this
[37:08] prison I'm gonna get out holy just begin
[37:11] to praise God maybe didn't even know
[37:13] what was going to happen doesn't matter
[37:15] just think God come down use your
[37:17] worship to touch others hallelujah amen
[37:22] I'm gonna leave it there my friends
[37:25] that's what we can do have you ever seen
[37:27] someone rejoice in church it just
[37:29] spreads like a wildfire hallelujah and
[37:31] then and then those half spiritual just
[37:33] think man I wish I had what they were
[37:34] having hallelujah and then they find the
[37:37] bottle we passed them they begin to
[37:38] rejoice ain't mean white because it's
[37:40] white because as a power comes down
[37:41] through that worship and it begins to
[37:43] loose the bands of the people yeah
[37:44] hallelujah amen we've seen it happen I
[37:47] say Lord let's see it more I mean this
[37:50] go beyond because what the devil wants
[37:52] us to be in a dungeon he wants to keep
[37:54] us in an inner prison dark and gloomy
[37:56] and dampen rats running around in
[37:58] cockroaches and you know what evermore
[38:00] stuck in it in a prison he wants us to
[38:02] be like that amen
[38:04] and he
[38:05] try and put us there amen and he even
[38:07] may put us there but that doesn't mean
[38:10] we're meant to stay there what are you
[38:12] gonna do hallelujah
[38:13] he just got to go through the process
[38:15] maybe you know naturally think while
[38:17] they go before the magistrate then they
[38:18] get sentenced and there's the ex why did
[38:21] ammount of time and finally sentencing
[38:22] and you know whatever they didn't go
[38:24] through that process they begin to
[38:26] praise God hallelujah he interrupted the
[38:29] process
