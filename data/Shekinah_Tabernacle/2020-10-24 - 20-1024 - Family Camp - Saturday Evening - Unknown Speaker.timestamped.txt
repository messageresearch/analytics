[5:07] that's good it's good to be amongst
[5:10] people that are good
[5:12] have you ever worked with someone or
[5:14] been around someone that's negative
[5:16] and all down and
[5:20] it's not overly enjoyable and the longer
[5:22] it goes on the
[5:23] less enjoyable it becomes but praise the
[5:26] lord we are not of that sort
[5:28] because we have hope we have life you
[5:30] know a christian i've always thought a
[5:32] christian
[5:33] you you never go backwards it's like a
[5:35] thing in the world to go backwards you
[5:36] know get old and tired and this and that
[5:39] a christian does not do that because our
[5:41] spirit is alive man
[5:43] it just we just live when and every year
[5:45] we get better and we grow more that's
[5:47] that's the way that it works we don't go
[5:48] down and get negative and
[5:50] tired with life i mean look at brother
[5:52] freddie you know
[5:54] and the other brother what's our other
[5:56] brother's name the brother that's 95
[5:58] look at him you know
[6:00] you know you get old you get negative
[6:02] you get down you get like that you end
[6:03] up in a rest home and just
[6:05] your life these people are dead well
[6:07] they're alive some of them it's a sad
[6:08] situation brother adam said i'd hate to
[6:10] be crowned
[6:12] when i'm old like a crabby old man and
[6:14] that's that's the crown of my life you
[6:15] know
[6:16] but praise god we don't have to go like
[6:18] that
[6:19] and i've had an enjoyable time so far
[6:22] and
[6:22] you know what i've really enjoyed about
[6:24] these services
[6:26] is that it's all local brethren doing
[6:27] everything
[6:30] i really enjoy it i do i
[6:34] you know it's funny because we are the
[6:36] way that we are
[6:37] the grass is kind of always greener on
[6:39] the other side of the fence you know so
[6:40] we'll see ministers from here overseas
[6:42] and then they'll see in the eminence is
[6:43] here you know we think well this is
[6:44] great
[6:45] you know we could just save a whole lot
[6:46] of money and hey you guys can stay here
[6:48] you guys can stay there
[6:49] [Music]
[6:50] because there's nothing wrong with our
[6:52] guys
[6:52] [Music]
[6:53] i really enjoy the ministry you know i i
[6:56] and i'm not just saying that you know i
[6:58] really do and
[7:00] and that's a part of christianity also
[7:02] is to always be appreciative
[7:04] of what the lord's given always it
[7:06] doesn't matter if you've heard the same
[7:07] guy preach for 40 years week after week
[7:09] appreciate it every
[7:11] week always appreciate it and then the
[7:13] lord will keep blessing us when we
[7:15] when we stop appreciating it and we let
[7:16] our minds slip backwards
[7:18] that's when it all starts to go bad but
[7:20] you know it's like a marriage
[7:22] it always gets better if you put effort
[7:24] in and you always appreciate what you
[7:25] have it always gets better it's when you
[7:26] think the other way
[7:28] that it goes it goes bad who's had a
[7:31] good marriage
[7:34] and ask the question that's
[7:37] no no i mean look
[7:46] now i feel bad some people have you know
[7:47] we all have different
[7:49] we have different trials in different
[7:51] areas of our life you know i've had a
[7:52] lot of trials and testings in my life
[7:54] but marriage has not been one of them
[7:56] that's one area of my life where the
[7:57] lord has just blessed me
[7:59] day in day out and i don't it's not
[8:01] because i've done anything good or
[8:02] anything i'm
[8:03] quite a horrible guy really
[8:07] well no i can't all right i'm not too
[8:10] bad

[1:01:46] in the book of romans chapter 8 and
[1:01:49] verse
[1:01:49] 13 is just a simple scripture and then
[1:01:53] we'll go over into the book of joshua
[1:01:55] and brother adrian touched on
[1:01:58] caleb and joshua
[1:02:02] this morning so just romans chapter 8
[1:02:05] 13
[1:02:08] it says for if we live after the flesh
[1:02:12] you shall die but if you
[1:02:15] through the spirit to mortify the deeds
[1:02:18] of the body
[1:02:20] you shall live and if we could turn over
[1:02:23] to the book of joshua
[1:02:27] i love the book of joshua
[1:02:31] i see myself in the book
[1:02:35] of joshua so just joshua chapter 1
[1:02:42] and then we'll go to joshua chapter 3 as
[1:02:44] well just joshua 1.
[1:02:46] now after the death of moses the servant
[1:02:49] of the lord it came to pass that
[1:02:51] the lord spake unto joshua the son of
[1:02:54] nun moses minister saying
[1:02:56] moses my servant is dead now therefore
[1:02:59] arise
[1:03:00] go over this jordan thou and all this
[1:03:03] people
[1:03:04] and to the land which i do give to them
[1:03:06] even to the children of
[1:03:08] israel every place that the soul of your
[1:03:11] foot
[1:03:12] shall tread upon that have i given
[1:03:15] unto you as i have said unto moses
[1:03:18] from the wilderness and this lebanon
[1:03:20] even unto the great river the river
[1:03:22] euphrates
[1:03:23] all the land of the hittites and unto
[1:03:25] the great sea towards the going down of
[1:03:26] the sun
[1:03:27] shall be your coast there shall not any
[1:03:30] man be able to stand before thee
[1:03:33] all the days of my life and mother
[1:03:35] stephen milam gave me this scripture he
[1:03:37] said
[1:03:38] as i was with moses so will i be with
[1:03:42] thee
[1:03:43] i will not fail uh fail thee nor
[1:03:46] forsaken joshua chapter three
[1:03:51] let's just read the first five verses
[1:03:54] it says in joshua rose early in the
[1:03:57] morning
[1:03:58] and they removed from shittim and came
[1:04:01] to jordan he and all the children of
[1:04:03] israel
[1:04:04] and lodged there before they passed over
[1:04:07] and it came to pass after three days
[1:04:10] that the officers went through the host
[1:04:12] and they commanded the people
[1:04:14] saying when you see the ark of the
[1:04:16] covenant of the lord your god
[1:04:18] and the priest the levites bearing it
[1:04:21] then you shall remove
[1:04:23] from your place and go after it
[1:04:27] for verse 4 yet there shall be a space
[1:04:29] between you and it
[1:04:31] about two thousand cupid's by measure
[1:04:34] come not near unto it
[1:04:35] that you may know um the way by which
[1:04:39] you must go for you have not passed this
[1:04:42] way
[1:04:43] yet um year four verse five says and
[1:04:46] joshua said unto the people
[1:04:49] sanctify yourself for tomorrow
[1:04:52] the lord will do wonders among you
[1:04:57] father we've read your word lord
[1:05:00] i'm available to you the people
[1:05:04] already so lord jesus
[1:05:07] take control jesus name
[1:05:10] amen and amen amen god bless you may be
[1:05:14] seated
[1:05:15] this morning in the presence of almighty
[1:05:18] god
[1:05:21] hey man i was just thinking i i think i
[1:05:23] might have mentioned it sometime
[1:05:25] in the last camp we were here i was
[1:05:29] thinking of
[1:05:30] camps that i used to attend
[1:05:34] as a young person and it's just always
[1:05:37] been
[1:05:38] awesome experiences it was and you i'll
[1:05:41] probably
[1:05:41] speak about it on tomorrow night but it
[1:05:44] was
[1:05:44] at a camp like this
[1:05:48] where god came and it changed
[1:05:51] my life completely
[1:05:55] so i was thinking of camps and i would i
[1:05:58] remember i was i was i was at a
[1:06:00] a camp one year
[1:06:04] and uh the the the atmosphere was
[1:06:08] electrifying
[1:06:09] like it is here we we
[1:06:12] knew that god was inaudible
[1:06:16] and i remember that day ferdi was was i
[1:06:18] think you were doing the song service
[1:06:20] and
[1:06:21] and at the end of the meeting
[1:06:24] ferdi came and he says now you're going
[1:06:27] to your bungalows
[1:06:30] but be ready be
[1:06:33] under expectation because god
[1:06:37] is going to meet you in your bungalows
[1:06:41] you know a lot of times we have this
[1:06:42] perception that it's only in a gathering
[1:06:46] a church gathering where god meets you
[1:06:48] so ferdi
[1:06:50] said those words and we all went
[1:06:53] to our bungalows i ended up falling
[1:06:56] asleep in my bungalow
[1:06:58] and then round about probably the middle
[1:07:00] of the night we heard
[1:07:02] knocking on our bungalow doors and then
[1:07:05] we got up what's happening
[1:07:07] and then we heard that said god is
[1:07:09] moving
[1:07:12] amongst the sisters in the bungalows
[1:07:16] and i remember jumping out of bed
[1:07:19] getting dressed with my brother-in-law
[1:07:22] gerard
[1:07:23] the two of us and we ran to the sisters
[1:07:26] area and i remember coming
[1:07:29] as i was walking i seen it was like it
[1:07:32] was like the
[1:07:33] the way the bundles were situated was
[1:07:35] sort of like in a semi circle
[1:07:37] and i remember coming and walking and i
[1:07:39] seen
[1:07:40] people on their knees on the grass
[1:07:45] it's dark people on their knees crying
[1:07:49] out to god
[1:07:51] and i remember coming then i i stepped
[1:07:54] into an atmosphere
[1:07:56] and as i stepped in that atmosphere i
[1:07:58] just felt myself dropped
[1:08:00] to my knees and i said lord
[1:08:05] you are still the same yesterday
[1:08:09] today and forever
[1:08:12] i said lord what you did for me at that
[1:08:14] camp
[1:08:16] you can do yeah
[1:08:19] amongst the people of god
[1:08:24] [Applause]
[1:08:26] so i'm not much on titles but the title
[1:08:30] that i want to give to you today
[1:08:35] is prepare yourself
[1:08:39] today
[1:08:42] for tomorrow or later
[1:08:46] the lord will do great
[1:08:50] wonders amongst you
[1:08:54] and within you
[1:09:00] that's my title and it's not just a
[1:09:03] title
[1:09:04] i believe it's something that's going to
[1:09:06] happen and it's already happening
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:13] and what inspired me for this title
[1:09:17] and i wrote it down here i said this
[1:09:20] weekend
[1:09:22] is my weekend
[1:09:27] this camp is for
[1:09:32] me
[1:09:35] i will receive
[1:09:38] what i came for
[1:09:42] i love that song that the choir sang
[1:09:46] i won't let you go until you bless me
[1:09:51] let that be your attitude
[1:09:55] over this weekend lord i won't let you
[1:09:59] go
[1:10:01] i need a change in my life
[1:10:10] i will receive what i
[1:10:13] came for
[1:10:18] but the chris yesterday told me
[1:10:22] he says by the test
[1:10:27] i'm hungry and the word of god says
[1:10:33] blessed are they which hunger
[1:10:36] and thirst for righteousness for they
[1:10:40] shall be full that's the word of
[1:10:43] almighty god
[1:10:47] and the word of god does not lie
[1:10:51] the word of god does not fail
[1:10:56] so if you're hungry and if you thirst
[1:11:01] god is going to meet you
[1:11:04] he's going to fool you he's going to
[1:11:06] give you what you
[1:11:10] need
[1:11:15] in the message
[1:11:18] just once more lord
[1:11:22] brother branham says then samson cried
[1:11:25] out lord
[1:11:26] they poked my eyes out i know that you
[1:11:30] are god
[1:11:31] i know that you have the power to do it
[1:11:36] i know you can set me free from these
[1:11:39] fitters
[1:11:42] a lot of times we find even in message
[1:11:45] churches
[1:11:47] people walking around in fitness
[1:11:52] pounds circumstances
[1:11:55] situations he says i know
[1:11:58] you can set me free from these fitness
[1:12:01] with the premises
[1:12:02] just once more lord just once
[1:12:06] more and then he says just once
[1:12:09] more lord just once more
[1:12:13] let there be a camp meeting
[1:12:18] on the side of the hill now i'm saying
[1:12:22] my words let there be a camp meeting
[1:12:26] in the forest lakes in forest lakes
[1:12:30] in otaki
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:34] and brother branham says like there was
[1:12:36] on the hill at the up room
[1:12:40] let there come a sound from heaven
[1:12:43] like a mighty rushing wind
[1:12:48] full of the house visible
[1:12:51] evidence of the resurrected christ
[1:12:57] visible evidence you heard that quoted
[1:13:00] right
[1:13:01] i quote it visible evidence
[1:13:06] of the resurrected christ
[1:13:10] visible evidence seen in you
[1:13:13] and in me you overcoming
[1:13:19] what whatever situation
[1:13:23] you face name it whatever it is
[1:13:30] i believe that the god that we serve
[1:13:34] is awesome and i believe
[1:13:37] if you haven't yet experienced it
[1:13:41] you're going to see the visible evidence
[1:13:45] of the resurrected lord jesus christ
[1:13:49] in your individual
[1:13:52] life is that what you want
[1:13:57] because if that's what you want and you
[1:14:00] have that desire in your heart
[1:14:04] he's going to give it to you
[1:14:09] yes mother andy i believe that because
[1:14:12] i've experienced it
[1:14:13] in my i'm not just talking stuff
[1:14:15] [Applause]
[1:14:17] but yeah i'm not just saying things to
[1:14:20] make you happy
[1:14:21] or to excite you i'm speaking things
[1:14:24] that i know what i'm talking about
[1:14:28] i've experienced a loving god
[1:14:31] a loving reality a god that has taken me
[1:14:35] from wherever i was
[1:14:37] and it's taken me higher and higher and
[1:14:42] he's helped me
[1:14:44] to overcome
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:14:51] he's given me the ability to say no
[1:14:54] when i must say no
[1:14:56] [Applause]
[1:14:59] you struggle to say no he is able to
[1:15:03] help you
[1:15:05] to say no
[1:15:12] forgive me
[1:15:17] i'm just me right
[1:15:20] i'm not
[1:15:23] i'm not off ready i'm not brother ben
[1:15:27] i'm not any other minister i'm just who
[1:15:30] god made me to be
[1:15:33] and i i believe that that
[1:15:36] it's just standing in your position it
[1:15:39] doesn't matter what it is whether it's a
[1:15:41] plumber whether it's the person that
[1:15:43] greets the believers
[1:15:46] you know how powerful it is at that
[1:15:48] person at the back
[1:15:50] that welcomes the people here
[1:15:53] if that person stands at the back
[1:15:56] and we come in and he just
[1:16:00] wish you how would we enter the church
[1:16:06] so i thank the lord for my lovely
[1:16:10] [Applause]
[1:16:18] precious
[1:16:21] i love the lord it's done
[1:16:24] so much for me i cannot tell it
[1:16:31] oh jesus there's no way i am
[1:16:36] so this this text now
[1:16:40] i struggled as i was preparing this
[1:16:45] because i wasn't sure how
[1:16:49] to present it and uh
[1:16:52] i had to tell myself and this was the
[1:16:54] other thing that brother stephen milam
[1:16:56] sent me
[1:16:57] he says in the book of jeremiah don't
[1:16:59] look at the faces of people
[1:17:02] but i'm looking at your faces because i
[1:17:04] can see that you love the lord
[1:17:06] and i can see that you want more of him
[1:17:11] but i i struggled a bit um with sort of
[1:17:15] the
[1:17:16] the theme of of of of what
[1:17:19] we're going to the lord is going to uh
[1:17:20] do today
[1:17:23] but as the weeks and the days
[1:17:27] went by i see god
[1:17:30] just dropping little tidbits of
[1:17:33] consolation
[1:17:35] along the way and saying this
[1:17:38] you go ahead you go ahead
[1:17:42] and that's what i need to do tonight
[1:17:45] now in this in this um as i said i love
[1:17:48] i just love the book of joshua amen now
[1:17:53] in in the passage uh joshua one two and
[1:17:57] three
[1:17:58] um these were people
[1:18:03] that walked that were walking
[1:18:07] and they promise
[1:18:11] joshua 1 says 1 3 says
[1:18:14] every place that the soul
[1:18:17] of your foot shall tread upon that
[1:18:21] have i given unto you
[1:18:24] they were walking under a promise so as
[1:18:27] they were walking
[1:18:29] there was promises hanging over them
[1:18:34] there shall not be there shall not any
[1:18:37] man be
[1:18:38] able to stand before thee
[1:18:41] all the days of my life as
[1:18:44] i was with moses so will i be with thee
[1:18:48] i will not
[1:18:49] fail thee nor forsake me these were
[1:18:53] people walking under a promise
[1:18:57] they were walking under a promise of a
[1:18:59] new land
[1:19:01] they were walking under a promise of my
[1:19:04] inheritance
[1:19:05] is in that land
[1:19:09] and i believe you and i
[1:19:12] are no different we are a people
[1:19:17] walking under great
[1:19:20] and precious promises
[1:19:25] promises of perfection
[1:19:28] promises of adoption promises of
[1:19:32] a body change promises of spoken word
[1:19:35] reality
[1:19:45] now these people
[1:19:48] they had to so in joshua chapter 3
[1:19:52] we find them coming to
[1:19:55] a place called jordan
[1:20:00] and it's there where god places
[1:20:04] them for a season
[1:20:08] now there was a requirement
[1:20:12] on the end that they
[1:20:16] needed to do
[1:20:19] before crossing over jordan
[1:20:24] and i read it in joshua
[1:20:28] 3 5 where it says joshua
[1:20:31] said unto the people
[1:20:34] sanctify yourself
[1:20:37] for tomorrow the lord will do wonders
[1:20:42] amongst you now they had to go through a
[1:20:45] process
[1:20:46] of sanctification now
[1:20:50] sanctification it's about
[1:20:53] dedicating yourself
[1:20:57] sanctifying consecrating yourself
[1:21:00] brother branham would take it and place
[1:21:02] it with her he'd say it's like a gloss
[1:21:06] a dirty gloss that's laying
[1:21:09] somewhere in the muck and the maya
[1:21:13] maybe you want me that dirty gloss
[1:21:17] and brother platinum would take it and
[1:21:18] say it's about picking that gloss up
[1:21:22] dirty gloss cleaning it out
[1:21:28] and sitting at the side for service
[1:21:33] so brother branham identifies and he
[1:21:35] talks a little bit
[1:21:37] about sanctification
[1:21:41] and then so the promise to them was
[1:21:44] sanctify yourself for tomorrow
[1:21:49] god is going to do wonders amongst you
[1:21:54] so i just wrote here i added in another
[1:21:57] word
[1:21:58] to that scripture and forgive me for
[1:22:00] doing that but
[1:22:02] just just to put things in perspective
[1:22:04] um i wrote you i said
[1:22:06] sanctify yourself today
[1:22:10] for tomorrow now tomorrow might not be
[1:22:13] the
[1:22:14] when the sun rises might just be in the
[1:22:15] next couple of minutes
[1:22:17] it might be during this meeting
[1:22:22] for tomorrow the lord will do wonders
[1:22:25] among you
[1:22:27] so they had to do something in
[1:22:30] preparation
[1:22:31] for some wonderful things
[1:22:36] that was going to happen now i know
[1:22:41] that this message is not a message of
[1:22:43] sanctification
[1:22:45] i know that but just just allow me just
[1:22:48] to
[1:22:48] just touch a bit on this
[1:22:52] i remember a couple of years ago and i
[1:22:55] might have mentioned this at some
[1:22:56] assembly i'd preach in i remember a
[1:22:59] couple of years ago
[1:23:01] there was a brother a younger brother
[1:23:04] his family of mine
[1:23:06] a younger brother that i had an
[1:23:09] altercation with
[1:23:12] we said some things had some words
[1:23:16] and then stopped talking to each other
[1:23:21] i was living in london brother was
[1:23:23] living in south africa
[1:23:25] so not talking to each other was okay
[1:23:27] because we were far apart
[1:23:31] the lord then arranged things that i
[1:23:34] ended up visiting south africa
[1:23:38] and going to a convention
[1:23:42] in fact it was a camp it wasn't a youth
[1:23:44] camp it was a camp like this
[1:23:47] and i remember sitting in that meeting
[1:23:49] oh man i was so excited
[1:23:51] the lord's gonna do great things for me
[1:23:57] and he did but i had to do something
[1:24:00] first
[1:24:02] and i sat at the back
[1:24:09] but i was under expectation
[1:24:13] and the god moved
[1:24:17] man i see now he was dealing
[1:24:20] with individuals and i had my
[1:24:24] hands in the air and i was trying to
[1:24:26] force
[1:24:28] what i want more of you
[1:24:31] but i felt empty i just felt there was
[1:24:35] something
[1:24:37] blocking me from from
[1:24:40] breaking through
[1:24:46] it's just something awesome
[1:24:48] [Applause]
[1:24:51] but there was something stopping me
[1:24:53] [Music]
[1:24:54] from breaking through
[1:24:58] and then the lord laid on my heart
[1:25:01] in the meeting
[1:25:04] and said tez
[1:25:07] you want more of me
[1:25:11] his name is dalton daniels
[1:25:14] dalton is in the same meeting
[1:25:19] you want to move on with me you're gonna
[1:25:22] make right with dalton
[1:25:25] i said no lord
[1:25:28] it wasn't me he's the he's younger than
[1:25:32] me anyway
[1:25:34] he must come to me because i'm the
[1:25:38] senior
[1:25:42] but the lord told me this
[1:25:46] if you if you want more of me
[1:25:50] test if you really want more of me
[1:25:55] this is going to be the test to prove if
[1:25:58] you really want more of me
[1:26:01] you're going to ah what's the word
[1:26:06] you're going to even if you're gonna be
[1:26:07] standing with egg on your face
[1:26:10] you're gonna have to make right to that
[1:26:11] brother whether you think the brother
[1:26:14] did you wrong
[1:26:15] you go and make right so while everyone
[1:26:18] was just
[1:26:19] entering in i slipped out in the back
[1:26:21] and i got someone to call by the delta
[1:26:24] and my dalton came to me and i said mr
[1:26:27] dalton
[1:26:28] you know this thing between me and you
[1:26:32] i said the delton i'm sorry
[1:26:36] hallelujah i said brother dalton
[1:26:40] forgive me you know what it wasn't just
[1:26:42] words
[1:26:43] because i wanted more of god i desired
[1:26:46] so much of god
[1:26:50] i said mr dalton i'm so sorry
[1:26:54] i said valentine heaven means more to me
[1:26:57] than this little bitty stuff
[1:27:03] and then we ended up holding each other
[1:27:07] hugging each other today by the dalton
[1:27:10] is one of my best buddies
[1:27:13] in fact
[1:27:16] in fact you might even be listening to
[1:27:18] the live stream right now
[1:27:22] but you know what happened after that i
[1:27:25] came into the meeting and i was
[1:27:26] felt so light
[1:27:30] i stood i i like to sit on the edge so i
[1:27:33] stood at the edge
[1:27:34] and all i remember was i raised my hands
[1:27:39] that's what i remember when i opened up
[1:27:42] my eyes
[1:27:43] i found myself laying here at the altar
[1:27:47] and i walked out of that meeting knowing
[1:27:50] that god had taken me a level
[1:27:54] higher worth him
[1:28:03] because that is what we as christians do
[1:28:07] we go higher
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:11] we don't stand and mark time we don't
[1:28:14] stay on one place all the time
[1:28:16] but we're moving forward
[1:28:20] we need to cross over if you haven't
[1:28:23] and we need to possess what is house
[1:28:28] what is mine
[1:28:29] [Applause]
[1:28:36] i am sick and tired of the devil messing
[1:28:39] around
[1:28:40] with the children of god it's time we
[1:28:44] take a stand
[1:28:47] as the devil enough is enough
[1:29:02] i just love the lord
[1:29:06] i can't explain myself
[1:29:09] oh thank you now we know we've been
[1:29:13] taught
[1:29:13] well by the message of
[1:29:17] the message that has come our way and
[1:29:20] believers don't ever ever ever ever
[1:29:23] underfell you
[1:29:26] don't undervalue what you and i have
[1:29:31] you and i we've got something that is so
[1:29:34] precious
[1:29:36] we've got something that is more
[1:29:38] precious than
[1:29:39] gold young people
[1:29:43] don't allow the enemy to take
[1:29:46] that away from you
[1:29:50] you fight for what is yours
[1:29:58] you know he makes the state when he says
[1:30:00] ephesians parallels joshua
[1:30:03] and i'm not going to go into those
[1:30:04] things i'll leave that for for the
[1:30:05] adrian gray and porfredi and all the
[1:30:08] big shot ministers but i just want to
[1:30:11] just
[1:30:12] say that for a reason
[1:30:15] because if you look at the book of
[1:30:18] joshua and you look at the warfare
[1:30:22] it's with a sword and they're just
[1:30:24] cutting
[1:30:25] cutting and killing
[1:30:29] and if you go into the book of ephesians
[1:30:32] there's also a warfare
[1:30:36] but it's a spiritual warfare
[1:30:41] if you look in the book of joshua
[1:30:43] there's a physical armor that they had
[1:30:45] to put on
[1:30:47] in the book of ephesians this is
[1:30:49] spiritual honor
[1:30:51] if you look at the book of joshua
[1:30:53] there's a physical land
[1:30:56] that they had to go in and possess
[1:31:00] brother branham says in the message
[1:31:03] adoption number one he says
[1:31:05] now what is the land promised
[1:31:09] to the new testament believers
[1:31:13] you and me and then he answers that he
[1:31:15] says
[1:31:16] the promise is the holy spirit
[1:31:21] i believe that now he says here
[1:31:26] he says but the believers
[1:31:30] now like i like this terminology he says
[1:31:32] but the believers
[1:31:34] the caleb and joshua outfit
[1:31:38] i like it i like the caleb and joshua
[1:31:42] outfit
[1:31:43] he identifies the caleb and joshua
[1:31:46] outfit
[1:31:47] as the believer as you and me
[1:31:50] and if you go and look at caleb and
[1:31:52] joshua
[1:31:53] there the their approach the way they
[1:31:57] handle things
[1:31:59] they didn't look at the
[1:32:02] problem they looked
[1:32:07] so the problem was there they looked
[1:32:10] there at the promise
[1:32:13] of god that said you
[1:32:16] are more than able
[1:32:24] that's me i'm freddie
[1:32:27] the caleb and joshua outfit
[1:32:36] okay but the believers the caleb and
[1:32:38] joshua outfit that was
[1:32:40] going on to the promise they moved on
[1:32:43] over into the land and they took the
[1:32:46] land
[1:32:47] and settled down in the land as a
[1:32:49] possession
[1:32:51] so they went over into the land if you
[1:32:53] read the book of joshua
[1:32:54] they had to go in they sort of went into
[1:32:56] the land but they still had to fight
[1:32:58] to dispossess whatever squatters
[1:33:01] was on their land
[1:33:06] now brother branham says um they moved
[1:33:09] him over
[1:33:10] over into the land and took the land and
[1:33:13] settled down in the land as a possession
[1:33:15] and we never stop at justification and
[1:33:19] we know these things right
[1:33:20] we never stop at justification
[1:33:22] sanctification
[1:33:24] let's go on to the baptism of the holy
[1:33:27] spirit
[1:33:29] let's not stop at believing on the lord
[1:33:32] jesus christ
[1:33:33] now he's not saying don't believe in the
[1:33:35] lord jesus he says don't stop thee
[1:33:37] he says being baptized
[1:33:41] let's not stop because he
[1:33:44] cleaned us up from a life of sin
[1:33:47] now i've discovered that in my hawk as a
[1:33:51] christian and
[1:33:52] dealing with different people he said
[1:33:54] god comes
[1:33:56] and he cleanses that person up
[1:34:00] it turns their life around and then they
[1:34:03] think that's okay
[1:34:06] and then they go back off the camp
[1:34:09] and they go back to their homes but
[1:34:12] they're not seeking
[1:34:13] more of god they're not seeking the
[1:34:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:19] because you see once you get emptied out
[1:34:22] something needs to follow
[1:34:24] that void
[1:34:28] so we find many times god does something
[1:34:32] amazing
[1:34:34] but they stop there go back home
[1:34:38] and the first little floozy that comes
[1:34:41] or the first little temptation that
[1:34:44] comes they crumble
[1:34:46] and they fall
[1:34:49] it's because they never went all the way
[1:34:56] so i want to encourage you tonight
[1:35:00] i believe that this ground
[1:35:04] this campground is holy ground
[1:35:09] i believe that with all my heart
[1:35:15] i believe we surround it by angels
[1:35:22] this weekend and this forest lakes camp
[1:35:26] has been set aside for you
[1:35:30] and for me
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:34] so when you leave here on monday
[1:35:38] make sure that you've gone
[1:35:42] all the way don't just stop
[1:35:48] your ministers your brothers that can
[1:35:50] help you
[1:35:51] work with you lead you
[1:35:55] in fact i think in the holy ghost is
[1:35:57] where the band talks about
[1:35:59] ministers that has got the holy ghost
[1:36:02] he says those let them lead you go talk
[1:36:05] to them
[1:36:11] in the messenger personal experience
[1:36:12] with god what we need today
[1:36:15] is a good old-fashioned saint paul's
[1:36:16] revival and the baptism of the holy
[1:36:19] ghost
[1:36:20] like fell on the day of pentecost to
[1:36:22] bring a people
[1:36:23] back to a living faith in god
[1:36:26] again he says i believe in confessions
[1:36:30] to raise up and accept jesus
[1:36:33] that's good and i believe it's important
[1:36:37] but he says i believe we need
[1:36:40] something more than that
[1:36:46] and just one last quote before i go to
[1:36:47] my notes but the brand
[1:36:49] says here in the adoption number one he
[1:36:52] says did you notice
[1:36:53] joshua before they cross jordan
[1:36:57] joshua said go through the midst of the
[1:37:00] camp
[1:37:01] clean your clothes sanctify every one of
[1:37:04] you
[1:37:06] for within three days you'll see the
[1:37:09] glory of god
[1:37:11] then brother madam says see it is
[1:37:15] a process of getting ready to inherit
[1:37:21] the promise so there is a process
[1:37:25] that god has given us
[1:37:28] so that we can move forward
[1:37:31] and we know justification sanctification
[1:37:33] oh we know these things
[1:37:36] i just want to drop this in and this
[1:37:39] might seem like
[1:37:41] you know very low down there but i
[1:37:43] believe it's so important
[1:37:46] on the day of pentecost peter
[1:37:49] came with a prescription
[1:37:53] on what you and i need to do
[1:37:57] to receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:38:02] what did he say acts 2 38 he says repent
[1:38:07] that's a very important step
[1:38:14] repent
[1:38:16] repent means to abort and hate
[1:38:20] persons repent is about
[1:38:24] change that's going to happen in your
[1:38:28] life
[1:38:30] peter says repent be baptized in the
[1:38:34] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:38:36] for the remission of sins and you shall
[1:38:39] receive the baptism the promise of the
[1:38:42] holy ghost
[1:38:44] now there's anyone here tonight
[1:38:48] there's a pool outside
[1:38:51] but don't just go to be baptized
[1:38:54] if you haven't time step number one
[1:39:01] i do repentance
[1:39:04] i remember brother branham was was um
[1:39:07] dealing with a woman i think she was
[1:39:10] alcoholic
[1:39:12] and uh you said okay let's pray
[1:39:15] and this woman she went up the knees and
[1:39:18] she said a prayer
[1:39:20] and she got up there she said by the
[1:39:21] panel i feel good
[1:39:23] i feel i can go on now for our prophet
[1:39:26] with discernment
[1:39:28] he discerned the situation and he said
[1:39:31] ah you haven't done it right
[1:39:35] and then brother branham says let's
[1:39:38] pray again and go
[1:39:41] go go to the message and just like let's
[1:39:43] pray again
[1:39:45] let's play again
[1:39:50] and then she prayed again
[1:39:54] and then when she prayed again
[1:39:58] brother branham says she struck
[1:40:01] something
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:06] i want to encourage you today
[1:40:10] let's strike something
[1:40:14] this weekend
[1:40:15] [Applause]
[1:40:18] if you haven't struck it yet yesterday
[1:40:21] or this morning
[1:40:22] you can strike it today
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:26] don't put it off for tomorrow don't wait
[1:40:28] until tomorrow
[1:40:30] do it today
[1:40:38] now the bible says
[1:40:42] that the jordan so they were
[1:40:46] camping at the jordan they needed
[1:40:51] to go over to the other side
[1:40:54] because their possession their
[1:40:57] inheritance
[1:40:59] was on the other side let's just watch
[1:41:03] god
[1:41:05] god blesses them they read the
[1:41:07] scriptures
[1:41:09] for three days three days
[1:41:12] you let them camp at jordan
[1:41:16] now but the brandon says just talks a
[1:41:18] little about the disease and as i was
[1:41:20] with moses
[1:41:21] he says that jordan was three
[1:41:25] or four times its size
[1:41:28] he says spooky
[1:41:32] looking
[1:41:36] but joshua said god said
[1:41:40] within three days we're going over
[1:41:44] and we are going over the joshua and
[1:41:48] caleb outfit
[1:41:50] joshua seen the jordan like everyone
[1:41:53] else in the jordan
[1:41:55] but joshua didn't look at the problem
[1:41:57] brother andy
[1:41:58] he looked at the promise of god
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:07] now that jordan and i'm going to steal
[1:42:11] i i spoke on this little bit sometime
[1:42:12] back in freddy said as you inspired me
[1:42:15] i want to preach on the sermon and title
[1:42:17] it that river
[1:42:18] so let's talk about that river
[1:42:23] that river overflowing
[1:42:28] and that level was probably looking at
[1:42:30] them
[1:42:35] [Applause]
[1:42:37] you're gonna crush me
[1:42:42] and they the children of israel were
[1:42:44] probably on the other side
[1:42:46] maybe there were some unbelievers
[1:42:49] looking at the river now we know there
[1:42:52] were rocks in the river as well
[1:42:54] so maybe there was some rocks that were
[1:42:55] standing up and the river was flowing
[1:42:57] and
[1:42:58] smashing the rocks and the people that
[1:43:01] look
[1:43:02] some unbelievers or make believers would
[1:43:04] look
[1:43:05] are we going to cross that but you
[1:43:08] should god
[1:43:09] place them there for
[1:43:12] three days
[1:43:16] he placed them there for three days
[1:43:19] because he wanted them to see
[1:43:22] it's not about their abilities
[1:43:26] but it's about god and god alone
[1:43:30] [Applause]
[1:43:34] amen so the lord let them stay there for
[1:43:37] three days
[1:43:39] now we know the other side of the story
[1:43:42] well
[1:43:43] forgive me it's not a story story is
[1:43:45] fictional
[1:43:47] this is an event that happened
[1:43:50] now we know that and we go there how
[1:43:52] they overcame the jordan
[1:43:54] but before overcoming they probably
[1:43:58] stood there
[1:43:59] and the jordan was just mocking them
[1:44:05] how many of us today
[1:44:08] might be facing our jordans
[1:44:12] situations that seem so big
[1:44:16] so difficult to overcome
[1:44:20] you know last week last week
[1:44:24] we as a family we received some
[1:44:27] devastating news
[1:44:30] i've got a sister that's 37 years old
[1:44:35] and she came to us to tell us that she's
[1:44:38] been
[1:44:39] diagnosed with what they call triple
[1:44:42] negative cancer now i have no idea what
[1:44:46] that means
[1:44:49] and yes as a family we've never ever
[1:44:53] had to experience cancer
[1:44:56] in our family and yeah
[1:44:59] i'm a son of god
[1:45:03] and yet i receive that news
[1:45:08] i had one of two choices
[1:45:13] i could have just said okay
[1:45:17] mr cancer
[1:45:20] but the god inside of me
[1:45:24] is telling me that this might be
[1:45:27] your jordan that's that's telling you
[1:45:30] there's no way
[1:45:33] that you're gonna pass me
[1:45:36] now i believe my sister's healing is on
[1:45:39] the other side
[1:45:42] but that jordan right now of triple
[1:45:44] negative cancer
[1:45:47] is standing and looking us at us as a
[1:45:50] family
[1:45:52] and saying there is no way
[1:45:55] i'm gonna let you pass me
[1:46:00] but i i'm praying in my heart
[1:46:04] and i'm saying lord this is a journey
[1:46:06] that that you've placed before me
[1:46:11] i have total confidence in god
[1:46:16] yes sometimes the flesh feels
[1:46:20] the way the flesh feels
[1:46:23] but i am saying lord i don't know where
[1:46:26] this journey is going to take us as a
[1:46:27] family
[1:46:29] one thing i do know it's going to draw
[1:46:32] us closer to you
[1:46:35] but lord help me
[1:46:40] me because you know sometimes we can
[1:46:43] just do our thing
[1:46:45] and god didn't tell you to do it but you
[1:46:48] just do your thing
[1:46:50] and then you mess up and then you come
[1:46:52] back as
[1:46:53] lord away sometimes it's your own doing
[1:46:59] so we go back you see it says here
[1:47:01] joshua
[1:47:03] they overcame the jordan how did they
[1:47:06] overcome the jordan
[1:47:07] brother branham says but the branham
[1:47:09] says
[1:47:11] he overcame the jordan by putting
[1:47:14] the word first
[1:47:20] he put the word ahead of him
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:26] but the plan says watch what did what
[1:47:28] what joshua did
[1:47:30] he did he put the clergy first no he put
[1:47:34] the word first brother branham says
[1:47:38] get behind it
[1:47:43] what situation might you be facing now
[1:47:47] get behind the word
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:54] don't you try to lead the world
[1:47:59] let the word lead you
[1:48:08] you see joshua's first campaign he put
[1:48:11] first things first
[1:48:15] and that was the word of god
[1:48:19] and that is my plan of action
[1:48:23] for this triple negative cancer
[1:48:26] i am putting the word first
[1:48:31] and i'm saying lord you lead
[1:48:35] and let the word do it
[1:48:39] for you let the word
[1:48:43] do it for you
[1:48:46] see it doesn't matter who you are
[1:48:50] forgive me for saying this it doesn't
[1:48:52] matter who you are
[1:48:54] it doesn't matter even how anointed
[1:48:58] you might say you are
[1:49:01] doesn't matter how awesome the gift is
[1:49:05] in your life if you don't
[1:49:10] put the word first
[1:49:14] those things just it's just silly stuff
[1:49:20] the word is the ultimate
[1:49:24] if you put the word first
[1:49:28] he will guide you he will lead you
[1:49:31] he will show you what you need to do
[1:49:38] with your jordan
[1:49:42] put the word first
[1:49:51] now across there jordan
[1:49:55] once they've done their process of
[1:49:57] sanctification and they
[1:49:59] followed the word we find out that when
[1:50:02] they
[1:50:03] followed the instructions of the word
[1:50:06] and they went into that jordan the
[1:50:09] jordan
[1:50:10] had to be obedient
[1:50:15] the jordan had to obey
[1:50:20] and we know what happened the jordan
[1:50:22] opened up because you see
[1:50:24] they had to get over to the other side
[1:50:28] because on the other side joshua had to
[1:50:31] meet up
[1:50:32] with the captain of the host of the lord
[1:50:36] they needed to have their victory at
[1:50:39] jericho
[1:50:41] they needed to have their victory at a.i
[1:50:45] and the defeat at ai now a lot of times
[1:50:49] now i'm going to hopefully finish soon a
[1:50:51] lot of times you know with
[1:50:52] with with joshua chapter seven i think
[1:50:56] we always tend to look at a.i and we
[1:50:59] look at
[1:51:00] aiken and we look at sin in the camp
[1:51:03] which is a very important principle
[1:51:07] but the book of hosier talks about
[1:51:12] you know when when when aiken
[1:51:15] had to when they had to make things
[1:51:17] right
[1:51:19] it was done in the valley of a core
[1:51:25] and the bible says in the book of hosea
[1:51:29] chapter 2 verse 15 it calls the valley
[1:51:33] of echo a door of hope
[1:51:39] i look at that and i say why is that the
[1:51:42] door of hope
[1:51:44] and i look at it and i say lord it shows
[1:51:46] me that lord maybe we might have done
[1:51:49] things so bad so wrong
[1:51:53] but father as long as we make
[1:51:56] right the wrong
[1:52:01] we can move on in victory
[1:52:04] so i read that hosea 2 15
[1:52:08] we had caused the calls the value of
[1:52:10] acor as a door of
[1:52:12] hope tells me that yes maybe i fail god
[1:52:18] maybe i make mistakes but i can come to
[1:52:21] him
[1:52:22] and i can say lord i need victory
[1:52:25] but lord you told me i need to do this
[1:52:28] father you told me i need to do that
[1:52:31] lord i'll do it
[1:52:32] because heaven means so much more to me
[1:52:37] than this pretty silly stuff so
[1:52:45] for this children of israel
[1:52:49] sanctification was part
[1:52:53] of their process to their promise
[1:52:59] brother branham says here in the
[1:53:01] adoption series
[1:53:02] 3 he says jesus was training
[1:53:05] 12 men that through those 12 men
[1:53:09] was to take the gospel to the world and
[1:53:12] he said
[1:53:13] for their sake i sanctify myself
[1:53:17] and then brother branham goes on make
[1:53:20] yourself
[1:53:22] meaning sanctify yourself for your
[1:53:24] neighbor's sake
[1:53:27] he says for somebody else's
[1:53:30] sake now why are you at this weekend's
[1:53:34] meetings
[1:53:36] you hear for yourself obviously you want
[1:53:38] more of god
[1:53:39] but i know that many of us are here
[1:53:43] for others as well we've got a burden
[1:53:47] for our loved ones we've got a burden
[1:53:50] for our husbands for our wives for our
[1:53:53] children
[1:53:54] for our neighbors brother branham says
[1:53:59] make yourself for your neighbors sick
[1:54:02] for somebody else's sake don't use your
[1:54:05] liberty for a cloak
[1:54:07] said paul but sanctify yourself
[1:54:11] and then brother branham goes on he says
[1:54:14] behave yourself in the neighborhood
[1:54:19] so when your neighbors see you
[1:54:22] what's their testimony behave yourself
[1:54:26] in the neighborhood like a real
[1:54:29] christian auto let your communication
[1:54:34] be says if you meet your enemy
[1:54:37] sanctify yourself for your sake
[1:54:42] your enemy someone has maybe done
[1:54:45] terrible things
[1:54:46] to you sanctify yourself
[1:54:51] for his sake and i'm not just saying
[1:54:54] these things
[1:54:56] i've gone through this i needed to do it
[1:55:04] he says if you meet your enemy
[1:55:08] sanctify yourself for his sake
[1:55:11] not knowing what you might do then
[1:55:14] brother ram talks about the adoption and
[1:55:16] he says
[1:55:17] first thing after the sun was in he
[1:55:19] become a son but then we find out
[1:55:22] his behavior is what set him
[1:55:25] to adoption whether he behaved
[1:55:30] right or not
[1:55:36] now the musicians can come and i'm going
[1:55:39] to
[1:55:40] just read a couple of scriptures
[1:55:44] and then i'm going to read a quote and
[1:55:47] then we'll finish
[1:55:49] and musicians can just play something
[1:55:51] soft
[1:55:54] we know brother brandon talks about
[1:55:55] jordan and
[1:55:57] he talks about death to self
[1:56:01] he talks about
[1:56:05] dying to self and i
[1:56:08] used to sit in meetings many times as a
[1:56:11] young person
[1:56:13] and i would hear these words
[1:56:16] die to self a lot of times i just
[1:56:20] didn't understand but i must die to self
[1:56:26] the lord just told me to read a couple
[1:56:28] of scriptures
[1:56:31] today and if maybe you identify
[1:56:36] with any of the scriptures
[1:56:40] if while the scripture is read
[1:56:44] and then this something is just
[1:56:48] respond to god
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:54] i'll just read the scriptures and i read
[1:56:56] a quote
[1:56:58] now the devil
[1:57:02] has a way sometimes of trying to expose
[1:57:06] you
[1:57:07] [Music]
[1:57:09] and his objective
[1:57:12] for wanting to expose you
[1:57:15] is for all the wrong reasons
[1:57:17] [Music]
[1:57:19] he wants to show you up
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:23] but god has got a different objective
[1:57:29] when he exposes you
[1:57:32] because he wants you if he shows you
[1:57:35] certain things in your life
[1:57:38] his objective is not to show you
[1:57:43] his objective is to let you come up
[1:57:45] higher
[1:57:48] his objective is for you to come to
[1:57:51] realization
[1:57:52] of who you are
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:58] so as i'm going to read the scriptures
[1:58:00] [Music]
[1:58:02] and if the holy ghost
[1:58:05] is exposing it maybe in your life or my
[1:58:08] life
[1:58:10] it's because he wants you to come up
[1:58:13] higher
[1:58:14] that's the reason for this camp
[1:58:19] he wants you and me to walk out this on
[1:58:21] monday
[1:58:23] knowing that we had a definite
[1:58:25] experience with a supernatural
[1:58:27] god and that when something comes my way
[1:58:30] tomorrow
[1:58:32] something happened amen
[1:58:35] [Music]
[1:58:37] and that i'll be able to stand
[1:58:42] whether i'm the out alone
[1:58:45] [Music]
[1:58:47] so i want to encourage you i'm not going
[1:58:49] to work up emotions right because
[1:58:51] emotions are weak emotions is weak
[1:58:55] i've been through all of those things
[1:58:57] i've experienced
[1:59:00] but i just want you to just
[1:59:03] come to that reality with god
[1:59:07] and i want to ask you just be
[1:59:10] brutally honest
[1:59:14] just be honest that's what he wants
[1:59:18] he wants honesty
[1:59:20] [Music]
[1:59:22] i have to be honest i had to go to
[1:59:25] dalton
[1:59:27] i'm sorry just read you the scriptures
[1:59:33] and remember the reason god just told me
[1:59:35] to read the scriptures
[1:59:39] reading this in the message church
[1:59:40] people might say why are you reading
[1:59:41] this in the message church
[1:59:44] i don't know god told me to read it so
[1:59:46] i'm going to read it
[1:59:50] ephesians 4 25 says now we're going to
[1:59:53] expose
[1:59:54] spirits because these are demons
[1:59:58] it's demons and that demon can go
[2:00:04] but the venom says in the church of the
[2:00:07] living god
[2:00:09] lays the power to overcome
[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:17] i believe that authority is here
[2:00:21] today
[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:25] and if you really want to move on with
[2:00:28] god
[2:00:30] you know what you must do now i'm not
[2:00:33] saying
[2:00:34] come to the altar if you want to come
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:38] it's as the lord leads you
[2:00:42] but you allow god
[2:00:44] [Music]
[2:00:46] to deal with you
[2:00:51] don't listen to my voice
[2:00:55] listen to the voice behind my voice
[2:00:59] which is speaking to you a lot of times
[2:01:02] we talk about the young people young
[2:01:04] people young people
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:07] a lot of times the young people needs
[2:01:08] this
[2:01:10] but a lot of times us older people we
[2:01:12] need this as well
[2:01:16] ephesians 4 25 says wherefore putting
[2:01:20] away lying speak
[2:01:24] every man truth with his neighbor
[2:01:29] if there's a lion demon it can go
[2:01:36] let him that steel
[2:01:39] or stone still no more
[2:01:43] now it's not only stealing from the shop
[2:01:47] it's stealing your boss's time
[2:01:51] it's stealing from god
[2:01:56] let no corrupt communication
[2:02:00] proceed out of your mouth
[2:02:05] let nothing be done through strife
[2:02:09] or vainglory it's all about me
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:15] ii timothy 3 says for men shall be
[2:02:18] lovers of their own selves
[2:02:22] covetous boasters
[2:02:25] proud blasphemous
[2:02:28] disobedient to parents
[2:02:31] now a lot of times again we put that on
[2:02:34] the young people
[2:02:36] what about us as old and
[2:02:40] our parents how do we treat them
[2:02:46] unthankful unholy
[2:02:50] and the big thing that's happening now

[2:03:01] fierce despises of those that are good
[2:03:05] traitors heady high-minded
[2:03:08] lovers of pleasure times

[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:27] now brother branham says in the message
[2:03:28] enticing spirits and go close here
[2:03:32] now let's lay aside every weight
[2:03:38] you see you've got a template you've got
[2:03:41] something about you
[2:03:42] and makes you talk when you ought not to
[2:03:45] talk
[2:03:47] brother branham says oh god lay it
[2:03:50] there now lay it before god
[2:03:55] he says lay it there
[2:03:58] watch the fire of the altar come down
[2:04:02] and take it away that can happen today
[2:04:09] and then later after this meeting you
[2:04:11] can move on
[2:04:12] with god
[2:04:13] [Music]
[2:04:17] he says watch the
[2:04:20] love of god lick it up so lord
[2:04:25] i got a lying spirit too lord i've got
[2:04:28] this
[2:04:29] problem with pornography which is quite

[2:04:59] he wants to help you he wants to
[2:05:02] help me

[2:05:20] where you've been talking to your wife

[2:05:30] neighbor
[2:05:32] the way you've talked about people in
[2:05:35] the church
[2:05:37] but the pronunciation lay it on the
[2:05:40] altar and the fire of
[2:05:44] god will come down and
[2:05:47] take it right away
[2:05:49] [Music]
